 ### GEN3C: 3D-Informed World-Consistent Video Generation with Precise Camera   Control
**Authors**: Xuanchi Ren, Tianchang Shen, Jiahui Huang, Huan Ling, Yifan Lu, Merlin Nimier-David, Thomas Müller, Alexander Keller, Sanja Fidler, Jun Gao

**Summary**: We present GEN3C, a generative video model with precise Camera Control and temporal 3D Consistency. Prior video models already generate realistic videos, but they tend to leverage little 3D information, leading to inconsistencies, such as objects popping in and out of existence. Camera control, if implemented at all, is imprecise, because camera parameters are mere inputs to the neural network which must then infer how the video depends on the camera. In contrast, GEN3C is guided by a 3D cache: point clouds obtained by predicting the pixel-wise depth of seed images or previously generated frames. When generating the next frames, GEN3C is conditioned on the 2D renderings of the 3D cache with the new camera trajectory provided by the user. Crucially, this means that GEN3C neither has to remember what it previously generated nor does it have to infer the image structure from the camera pose. The model, instead, can focus all its generative power on previously unobserved regions, as well as advancing the scene state to the next frame. Our results demonstrate more precise camera control than prior work, as well as state-of-the-art results in sparse-view novel view synthesis, even in challenging settings such as driving scenes and monocular dynamic video. Results are best viewed in videos. Check out our webpage! https://research.nvidia.com/labs/toronto-ai/GEN3C/

**Authors**: Nianzu Yang, Pandeng Li, Liming Zhao, Yang Li, Chen-Wei Xie, Yehui Tang, Xudong Lu, Zhihang Liu, Yun Zheng, Yu Liu, Junchi Yan

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T17:59:19Z

**Summary**: Video tokenizers, which transform videos into compact latent representations, are key to video generation. Existing video tokenizers are based on the VAE architecture and follow a paradigm where an encoder compresses videos into compact latents, and a deterministic decoder reconstructs the original videos from these latents. In this paper, we propose a novel \underline{\textbf{C}}onditioned \underline{\textbf{D}}iffusion-based video \underline{\textbf{T}}okenizer entitled \textbf{\ourmethod}, which departs from previous methods by replacing the deterministic decoder with a 3D causal diffusion model. The reverse diffusion generative process of the decoder is conditioned on the latent representations derived via the encoder. With a feature caching and sampling acceleration, the framework efficiently reconstructs high-fidelity videos of arbitrary lengths. Results show that {\ourmethod} achieves state-of-the-art performance in video reconstruction tasks using just a single-step sampling. Even a smaller version of {\ourmethod} still achieves reconstruction results on par with the top two baselines. Furthermore, the latent video generation model trained using {\ourmethod} also shows superior performance.

### Online Scheduling for LLM Inference with KV Cache Constraints
**Authors**: Patrick Jaillet, Jiashuo Jiang, Chara Podimata, Zijie Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T14:43:01Z

**Summary**: Large Language Model (LLM) inference, where a trained model generates text one word at a time in response to user prompts, is a computationally intensive process requiring efficient scheduling to optimize latency and resource utilization. A key challenge in LLM inference is the management of the Key-Value (KV) cache, which reduces redundant computations but introduces memory constraints. In this work, we model LLM inference with KV cache constraints theoretically and propose novel batching and scheduling algorithms that minimize inference latency while effectively managing the KV cache's memory.   We analyze both semi-online and fully online scheduling models, and our results are threefold. First, we provide a polynomial-time algorithm that achieves exact optimality in terms of average latency in the semi-online prompt arrival model. Second, in the fully online case with a stochastic prompt arrival, we introduce an efficient online scheduling algorithm with constant regret. Third, we prove that no algorithm (deterministic or randomized) can achieve a constant competitive ratio in fully online adversarial settings. Our empirical evaluations on a public LLM inference dataset, using the Llama-70B model on A100 GPUs, show that our approach significantly outperforms benchmark algorithms used currently in practice, achieving lower latency while reducing energy consumption. Overall, our results offer a path toward more sustainable and cost-effective LLM deployment.

### StableToolBench: Towards Stable Large-Scale Benchmarking on Tool   Learning of Large Language Models
**Authors**: Zhicheng Guo, Sijie Cheng, Hao Wang, Shihao Liang, Yujia Qin, Peng Li, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun, Yang Liu

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T07:39:03Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have witnessed remarkable advancements in recent years, prompting the exploration of tool learning, which integrates LLMs with external tools to address diverse real-world challenges. Assessing the capability of LLMs to utilise tools necessitates large-scale and stable benchmarks. However, previous works relied on either hand-crafted online tools with limited scale, or large-scale real online APIs suffering from instability of API status. To address this problem, we introduce StableToolBench, a benchmark evolving from ToolBench, proposing a virtual API server and stable evaluation system. The virtual API server contains a caching system and API simulators which are complementary to alleviate the change in API status. Meanwhile, the stable evaluation system designs solvable pass and win rates using GPT-4 as the automatic evaluator to eliminate the randomness during evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate the stability of StableToolBench, and further discuss the effectiveness of API simulators, the caching system, and the evaluator system.

### Enhancing Memory Efficiency in Large Language Model Training Through   Chronos-aware Pipeline Parallelism
**Authors**: Xinyuan Lin, Chenlu Li, Zongle Huang, Chunyu Wang, Bo Xiao, Huazhong Yang, Shishi Duan, Yongpan Liu

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T04:54:50Z

**Summary**: Larger model sizes and longer sequence lengths have empowered the Large Language Model (LLM) to achieve outstanding performance across various domains. However, this progress brings significant storage capacity challenges for LLM pretraining. High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) is expensive and requires more advanced packaging technologies for capacity expansion, creating an urgent need for memory-efficient scheduling strategies. Yet, prior pipeline parallelism schedules have primarily focused on reducing bubble overhead, often neglecting memory efficiency and lacking compatibility with other memory-efficient strategies. Consequently, these methods struggle to meet the storage demands of storage capacity for next-generation LLM. This work presents ChronosPipe, a Chronos-aware pipeline parallelism for memory-efficient LLM pretraining. The core insight of ChronosPipe is to treat HBM as a fast but small 'cache,' optimizing and exploiting temporal locality within LLM pretraining to enhance HBM utilization. ChronosPipe introduces a pipeline scheduling strategy, Chronos-Pipe, to reduce the extrinsic overhead that disrupts the temporal locality of activations. Additionally, it leverages Chronos-Recomp and Chronos-Offload to efficiently harness the intrinsic temporal locality of activations and weights in Deep Neural Networks. Experiment results show that ChronosPipe can expand the trainable model size by 2.4x while maintaining comparable throughput, achieving 1.5x better than the 1F1B strategy combined with recomputation.

### InfiniSST: Simultaneous Translation of Unbounded Speech with Large   Language Model
**Authors**: Siqi Ouyang, Xi Xu, Lei Li

**Updated**: 2025-03-04T19:51:29Z

**Summary**: Simultaneous translation of unbounded streaming speech remains a challenging problem due to the need for effectively processing the history speech context and past translations so that quality and latency, including computation overhead, can be balanced. Most prior works assume pre-segmented speech, limiting their real-world applicability. In this paper, we propose InfiniSST, a novel approach that formulates SST as a multi-turn dialogue task, enabling seamless translation of unbounded speech. We construct translation trajectories and robust segments from MuST-C with multi-latency augmentation during training and develop a key-value (KV) cache management strategy to facilitate efficient inference. Experiments on MuST-C En-Es, En-De, and En-Zh demonstrate that InfiniSST reduces computation-aware latency by 0.5 to 1 second while maintaining the same translation quality compared to baselines. Ablation studies further validate the contributions of our data construction and cache management strategy. We release the code at https://github.com/LeiLiLab/InfiniSST

**Authors**: Nathan Godey, Alessio Devoto, Yu Zhao, Simone Scardapane, Pasquale Minervini, Éric de la Clergerie, Benoît Sagot

**Updated**: 2025-03-04T17:37:49Z

**Summary**: Autoregressive language models rely on a Key-Value (KV) Cache, which avoids re-computing past hidden states during generation, making it faster. As model sizes and context lengths grow, the KV Cache becomes a significant memory bottleneck, which calls for compression methods that limit its size during generation. In this paper, we discover surprising properties of Query (Q) and Key (K) vectors that allow us to efficiently approximate attention scores without computing the attention maps. We propose Q-Filters, a training-free KV Cache compression method that filters out less crucial Key-Value pairs based on a single context-agnostic projection. Contrarily to many alternatives, Q-Filters is compatible with FlashAttention, as it does not require direct access to attention weights. Experimental results in long-context settings demonstrate that Q-Filters is competitive with attention-based compression methods such as SnapKV in retrieval tasks while consistently outperforming efficient compression schemes such as Streaming-LLM in generation setups. Notably, Q-Filters achieves a 99% accuracy in the needle-in-a-haystack task with a x32 compression level while reducing the generation perplexity drop by up to 65% in text generation compared to Streaming-LLM.

### Efficient and Optimal No-Regret Caching under Partial Observation
**Authors**: Younes Ben Mazziane, Francescomaria Faticanti, Sara Alouf, Giovanni Neglia

**Updated**: 2025-03-04T16:21:33Z

**Summary**: Online learning algorithms have been successfully used to design caching policies with sublinear regret in the total number of requests, with no statistical assumption about the request sequence. Most existing algorithms involve computationally expensive operations and require knowledge of all past requests. However, this may not be feasible in practical scenarios like caching at a cellular base station. Therefore, we study the caching problem in a more restrictive setting where only a fraction of past requests are observed, and we propose a randomized caching policy with sublinear regret based on the classic online learning algorithm Follow-the-Perturbed-Leader (FPL). Our caching policy is the first to attain the asymptotically optimal regret bound while ensuring asymptotically constant amortized time complexity in the partial observability setting of requests. The experimental evaluation compares the proposed solution against classic caching policies and validates the proposed approach under synthetic and real-world request traces.

### Let the Code LLM Edit Itself When You Edit the Code
**Authors**: Zhenyu He, Jun Zhang, Shengjie Luo, Jingjing Xu, Zhi Zhang, Di He

**Updated**: 2025-03-04T13:01:07Z

**Summary**: In this work, we investigate a typical scenario in code generation where a developer edits existing code in real time and requests a code assistant, e.g., a large language model, to re-predict the next token or next line on the fly. Naively, the LLM needs to re-encode the entire KV cache to provide an accurate prediction. However, this process is computationally expensive, especially when the sequence length is long. Simply encoding the edited subsequence and integrating it to the original KV cache meets the temporal confusion problem, leading to significantly worse performance. We address this efficiency and accuracy trade-off by introducing \underline{\textbf{Positional \textbf{I}ntegrity \textbf{E}ncoding} (PIE). Building upon the rotary positional encoding, PIE first removes the rotary matrices in the Key cache that introduce temporal confusion and then reapplies the correct rotary matrices. This process ensures that positional relationships between tokens are correct and requires only a single round of matrix multiplication. We validate the effectiveness of PIE through extensive experiments on the RepoBench-C-8k dataset, utilizing DeepSeek-Coder models with 1.3B, 6.7B, and 33B parameters. Our evaluation includes three real-world coding tasks: code insertion, code deletion, and multi-place code editing. Results demonstrate that PIE reduces computational overhead by over 85% compared to the standard full recomputation approach across all model sizes and tasks while well approximating the model performance.

### Q&C: When Quantization Meets Cache in Efficient Image Generation
**Authors**: Xin Ding, Xin Li, Haotong Qin, Zhibo Chen

**Updated**: 2025-03-04T11:19:02Z

**Summary**: Quantization and cache mechanisms are typically applied individually for efficient Diffusion Transformers (DiTs), each demonstrating notable potential for acceleration. However, the promoting effect of combining the two mechanisms on efficient generation remains under-explored. Through empirical investigation, we find that the combination of quantization and cache mechanisms for DiT is not straightforward, and two key challenges lead to severe catastrophic performance degradation: (i) the sample efficacy of calibration datasets in post-training quantization (PTQ) is significantly eliminated by cache operation; (ii) the combination of the above mechanisms introduces more severe exposure bias within sampling distribution, resulting in amplified error accumulation in the image generation process. In this work, we take advantage of these two acceleration mechanisms and propose a hybrid acceleration method by tackling the above challenges, aiming to further improve the efficiency of DiTs while maintaining excellent generation capability. Concretely, a temporal-aware parallel clustering (TAP) is designed to dynamically improve the sample selection efficacy for the calibration within PTQ for different diffusion steps. A variance compensation (VC) strategy is derived to correct the sampling distribution. It mitigates exposure bias through an adaptive correction factor generation. Extensive experiments have shown that our method has accelerated DiTs by 12.7x while preserving competitive generation capability. The code will be available at https://github.com/xinding-sys/Quant-Cache.

### Energy efficiency of cache eviction algorithms for Zipf distributed   objects
**Authors**: Emese Sziklay, Tamás Jursonovics

**Updated**: 2025-03-04T11:15:47Z

**Summary**: This paper presents a summary analysis of the Least Frequently Used (LFU) and Perfect Least Frequently Used (PLFU) cache eviction algorithms on real data, transferred on Content Delivery Nettworks (CDNs), as well as on Zipf distributed samples. In light of the growing emphasis on energy efficiency in CDNs in recent years due to rising energy costs, this paper considers and discusses the total CPU time required to run a cache algorithm. The total CPU time represents a novel metric for evaluating cache performance, and it is contrasted with the conventional Cache Hit Ratio (CHR) metric. Furthermore, a new algorithm with an admission policy and the eviction strategy that of PLFU is presented. The results demonstrate that it is a simple and straightforward algorithm to implement and offers high CHR and low CPU time.

### PersonaX: A Recommendation Agent Oriented User Modeling Framework for   Long Behavior Sequence
**Authors**: Yunxiao Shi, Wujiang Xu, Zeqi Zhang, Xing Zi, Qiang Wu, Min Xu

**Updated**: 2025-03-04T08:41:40Z

**Summary**: Recommendation agents leverage large language models for user modeling LLM UM to construct textual personas guiding alignment with real users. However existing LLM UM methods struggle with long user generated content UGC due to context limitations and performance degradation. To address this sampling strategies prioritize relevance or recency are often applied yet they inevitably neglect the diverse user interests embedded within the discarded behaviors resulting in incomplete modeling and degraded profiling quality. Furthermore relevance based sampling requires real time retrieval forcing the user modeling process to operate online which introduces significant latency overhead. In this paper we propose PersonaX an agent agnostic LLM UM framework that tackles these challenges through sub behavior sequence SBS selection and offline multi persona construction. PersonaX extracts compact SBS segments offline to capture diverse user interests generating fine grained textual personas that are cached for efficient online retrieval. This approach ensures that the user persona used for prompting remains highly relevant to the current context while eliminating the need for online user modeling. For SBS selection we ensure both efficiency length less than five and high representational quality by balancing prototypicality and diversity within the sampled data. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and versatility of PersonaX in high quality user profiling. Utilizing only 30 to 50 percent of the behavioral data with a sequence length of 480 integrating PersonaX with AgentCF yields an absolute performance improvement of 3 to 11 percent while integration with Agent4Rec results in a gain of 10 to 50 percent. PersonaX as an agent agnostic framework sets a new benchmark for scalable user modeling paving the way for more accurate and efficient LLM driven recommendation agents.

### VQ-LLM: High-performance Code Generation for Vector Quantization   Augmented LLM Inference
**Authors**: Zihan Liu, Xinhao Luo, Junxian Guo, Wentao Ni, Yangjie Zhou, Yue Guan, Cong Guo, Weihao Cui, Yu Feng, Minyi Guo, Yuhao Zhu, Minjia Zhang, Jingwen Leng, Chen Jin

**Updated**: 2025-03-04T03:18:56Z

**Summary**: In this work, we design and implement VQ-LLM, an efficient fused Vector Quantization (VQ) kernel generation framework. We first introduce a software abstraction called codebook cache to optimize codebook access efficiency and support the integration of VQ with various computations. The codebook cache adaptively stores different entries across the GPU's memory hierarchy, including off-chip global memory, on-chip shared memory, and registers. Centered around the codebook cache, we design an efficient computation engine that optimizes memory traffic during computations involving codebooks. This compute engine adopts the codebook-centric dataflow and fusion optimizations. Additionally, we provide adaptive heuristics to tailor parameter selection in our optimizations to diverse VQ configurations. Our optimizations achieve an average latency reduction of 46.13% compared to unoptimized versions. Compared to existing open-source implementations, our methods decrease latency by 64.36% to 99.1%. A final comparison with state-of-the-art element-wise quantization methods like AWQ and KVQuant shows that our VQ-LLM is practically viable, achieving latencies close or even better latencies to those at equivalent bit-widths, potentially offering greater accuracy.

### TUNA: Tuning Unstable and Noisy Cloud Applications
**Authors**: Johannes Freischuetz, Konstantinos Kanellis, Brian Kroth, Shivaram Venkataraman

**Updated**: 2025-03-03T18:32:31Z

**Summary**: Autotuning plays a pivotal role in optimizing the performance of systems, particularly in large-scale cloud deployments. One of the main challenges in performing autotuning in the cloud arises from performance variability. We first investigate the extent to which noise slows autotuning and find that as little as $5\%$ noise can lead to a $2.5$x slowdown in converging to the best-performing configuration. We measure the magnitude of noise in cloud computing settings and find that while some components (CPU, disk) have almost no performance variability, there are still sources of significant variability (caches, memory). Furthermore, variability leads to autotuning finding \emph{unstable} configurations. As many as $63.3\%$ of the configurations selected as "best" during tuning can have their performance degrade by $30\%$ or more when deployed. Using this as motivation, we propose a novel approach to improve the efficiency of autotuning systems by (a) detecting and removing outlier configurations and (b) using ML-based approaches to provide a more stable \emph{true} signal of de-noised experiment results to the optimizer. The resulting system, TUNA (\underline{T}uning \underline{U}nstable and \underline{N}oisy Cloud \underline{A}pplications) enables faster convergence and robust configurations. Tuning postgres running \texttt{mssales}, an enterprise production workload, we find that TUNA can lead to $1.88$x lower running time on average with $2.58x$ lower standard deviation compared to traditional sampling methodologies.

### RefreshKV: Updating Small KV Cache During Long-form Generation
**Authors**: Fangyuan Xu, Tanya Goyal, Eunsol Choi

**Updated**: 2025-03-03T18:23:47Z

**Summary**: Generating long sequences of tokens given a long-context input is a very compute-intensive inference scenario for large language models (LLMs). One prominent inference speed-up approach is to construct a smaller key-value (KV) cache, relieving LLMs from computing attention over a long sequence of tokens. While such methods work well to generate short sequences, their performance degrades rapidly for long-form generation. Most KV compression happens once, prematurely removing tokens that can be useful later in the generation. We propose a new inference method, RefreshKV, that flexibly alternates between full context attention and attention over a subset of input tokens during generation. After each full attention step, we update the smaller KV cache based on the attention pattern over the entire input. Applying our method to off-the-shelf LLMs achieves comparable speedup to eviction-based methods while improving performance for various long-form generation tasks. Lastly, we show that continued pretraining with our inference setting brings further gains in performance.

### EliteKV: Scalable KV Cache Compression via RoPE Frequency Selection and   Joint Low-Rank Projection
**Authors**: Yuhao Zhou, Sirui Song, Boyang Liu, Zhiheng Xi, Senjie Jin, Xiaoran Fan, Zhihao Zhang, Wei Li, Xuanjing Huang

**Updated**: 2025-03-03T14:26:51Z

**Summary**: Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) enables each attention head to capture multi-frequency information along the sequence dimension and is widely applied in foundation models. However, the nonlinearity introduced by RoPE complicates optimization of the key state in the Key-Value (KV) cache for RoPE-based attention. Existing KV cache compression methods typically store key state before rotation and apply the transformation during decoding, introducing additional computational overhead. This paper introduces EliteKV, a flexible modification framework for RoPE-based models supporting variable KV cache compression ratios. EliteKV first identifies the intrinsic frequency preference of each head using RoPElite, selectively restoring linearity to certain dimensions of key within attention computation. Building on this, joint low-rank compression of key and value enables partial cache sharing. Experimental results show that with minimal uptraining on only $0.6\%$ of the original training data, RoPE-based models achieve a $75\%$ reduction in KV cache size while preserving performance within a negligible margin. Furthermore, EliteKV consistently performs well across models of different scales within the same family.

### KurTail : Kurtosis-based LLM Quantization
**Authors**: Mohammad Sadegh Akhondzadeh, Aleksandar Bojchevski, Evangelos Eleftheriou, Martino Dazzi

**Updated**: 2025-03-03T12:43:06Z

**Summary**: One of the challenges of quantizing a large language model (LLM) is the presence of outliers. Outliers often make uniform quantization schemes less effective, particularly in extreme cases such as 4-bit quantization. We introduce KurTail, a new post-training quantization (PTQ) scheme that leverages Kurtosis-based rotation to mitigate outliers in the activations of LLMs. Our method optimizes Kurtosis as a measure of tailedness. This approach enables the quantization of weights, activations, and the KV cache in 4 bits. We utilize layer-wise optimization, ensuring memory efficiency. KurTail outperforms existing quantization methods, offering a 13.3\% boost in MMLU accuracy and a 15.5\% drop in Wiki perplexity compared to QuaRot. It also outperforms SpinQuant with a 2.6\% MMLU gain and reduces perplexity by 2.9\%, all while reducing the training cost. For comparison, learning the rotation using SpinQuant for Llama3-70B requires at least four NVIDIA H100 80GB GPUs, whereas our method requires only a single GPU, making it a more accessible solution for consumer GPU.

### Performance Optimization of 3D Stencil Computation on ARM Scalable   Vector Extension
**Authors**: Hongguang Chen

**Updated**: 2025-03-03T09:38:20Z

**Summary**: Stencil computation is essential in high-performance computing, especially for large-scale tasks like liquid simulation and weather forecasting. Optimizing its performance can reduce both energy consumption and computation time, which is critical in disaster prediction. This paper explores optimization techniques for 7-point 3D stencil computation on ARM's Scalable Vector Extension (SVE), using the Roofline model and tools like Gem5 and cacti. We evaluate software optimizations such as vectorization and tiling, as well as hardware adjustments in ARM SVE vector lengths and cache configurations. The study also examines performance, power consumption, and chip area trade-offs to identify optimal configurations for ARM-based systems.

### WeightedKV: Attention Scores Weighted Key-Value Cache Merging for Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Jian Yuan, Ziwei He, Haoli Bai, Jingwen Leng, Bo Jiang

**Updated**: 2025-03-03T09:12:34Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) use key-value (KV) cache to reduce redundant computation in autoregressive generation. However, the KV cache size increases linearly during generation, leading to excessive memory usage, especially for long texts. Most KV cache compression methods evict the unimportant KV pairs to maintain a fixed cache size, which leads to the permanent loss of tokens during generation. However, singular value decomposition shows that \textit{values} do not exhibit a strong low-rank property as \textit{keys} do, suggesting that information is distributed more evenly across \textit{values}, in contrast to its more redundant distribution within \textit{keys}. Therefore, methods that evict both \textit{keys} and \textit{values} risk losing crucial information and compromise context integrity, ultimately degrading the output quality. To address this problem, we propose WeightedKV, a novel, training-free approach that discards the \textit{keys} of less important tokens, while merging their \textit{values} into neighboring tokens via a convex combination weighted by their average attention scores. In this way, the retained \textit{keys} serve as anchors that guide the generation process, while the merged \textit{values} provide a rich contextual backdrop. We assess our method on four widely used language modeling datasets, demonstrating superior performance compared to all baseline methods, particularly with a lower budget ratio.

### CacheQuant: Comprehensively Accelerated Diffusion Models
**Authors**: Xuewen Liu, Zhikai Li, Qingyi Gu

**Updated**: 2025-03-03T09:04:51Z

**Summary**: Diffusion models have gradually gained prominence in the field of image synthesis, showcasing remarkable generative capabilities. Nevertheless, the slow inference and complex networks, resulting from redundancy at both temporal and structural levels, hinder their low-latency applications in real-world scenarios. Current acceleration methods for diffusion models focus separately on temporal and structural levels. However, independent optimization at each level to further push the acceleration limits results in significant performance degradation. On the other hand, integrating optimizations at both levels can compound the acceleration effects. Unfortunately, we find that the optimizations at these two levels are not entirely orthogonal. Performing separate optimizations and then simply integrating them results in unsatisfactory performance. To tackle this issue, we propose CacheQuant, a novel training-free paradigm that comprehensively accelerates diffusion models by jointly optimizing model caching and quantization techniques. Specifically, we employ a dynamic programming approach to determine the optimal cache schedule, in which the properties of caching and quantization are carefully considered to minimize errors. Additionally, we propose decoupled error correction to further mitigate the coupled and accumulated errors step by step. Experimental results show that CacheQuant achieves a 5.18 speedup and 4 compression for Stable Diffusion on MS-COCO, with only a 0.02 loss in CLIP score.

### DCI: A Coordinated Allocation and Filling Workload-Aware Dual-Cache   Allocation GNN Inference Acceleration System
**Authors**: Yi Luo, Yaobin Wang, Qi Wang, Yingchen Song, Huan Wu, Qingfeng Wang, Jun Huang

**Updated**: 2025-03-03T08:06:55Z

**Summary**: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are powerful tools for processing graph-structured data, increasingly used for large-scale real-world graphs via sampling-based inference methods. However, inherent characteristics of neighbor sampling lead to redundant data loading during GNN inference, compounded by inefficient data transfers between host and GPU memory, resulting in slow inference and low resource utilization. Existing methods to accelerate GNN inference face several challenges: (1) low practical GPU memory utilization, (2) overlooking adjacency matrix locality, and (3) long preprocessing time. To address these challenges, we introduce DCI, an efficient workload-aware dual-cache allocation system for GNN inference acceleration. DCI allocates cache capacities for both node features and adjacency matrices based on workload patterns during the pre-sampling phase, leveraging a lightweight cache-filling algorithm to optimize data loading efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that DCI accelerates sampling and node feature loading, achieving end-to-end inference speedups of 1.18$\times$ to 11.26$\times$ compared to DGL, and 1.14$\times$ to 13.68$\times$ over RAIN, while reducing preprocessing time by 52.8\% to 98.7\%. Additionally, DCI outperforms state-of-the-art single-cache inference systems by achieving speedup of 1.08$\times$ to 1.32$\times$. We also compared DCI with DUCATI's dual-cache population strategy. Our lightweight population algorithm allows DCI to achieve nearly the same inference speed while keeping preprocessing time to less than 20\% of that required by DUCATI.

### TokenSelect: Efficient Long-Context Inference and Length Extrapolation   for LLMs via Dynamic Token-Level KV Cache Selection
**Authors**: Wei Wu, Zhuoshi Pan, Chao Wang, Liyi Chen, Yunchu Bai, Tianfu Wang, Kun Fu, Zheng Wang, Hui Xiong

**Updated**: 2025-03-03T05:49:41Z

**Summary**: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has driven growing demand for processing extended context sequences in contemporary applications. However, this progress faces two major challenges: performance degradation due to sequence lengths out-of-distribution, and excessively long inference times caused by the quadratic computational complexity of attention. These issues hinder the application of LLMs in long-context scenarios. In this paper, we propose Dynamic Token-Level KV Cache Selection (TokenSelect), a training-free method for efficient and accurate long-context inference. TokenSelect builds upon the observation of non-contiguous attention sparsity, using Query-Key dot products to measure per-head KV Cache criticality at token-level. By per-head soft voting mechanism, TokenSelect selectively involves a few critical KV cache tokens in attention calculation without sacrificing accuracy. To further accelerate TokenSelect, we design the Selection Cache based on observations of consecutive Query similarity and implemented efficient dot product kernel, significantly reducing the overhead. A comprehensive evaluation of TokenSelect demonstrates up to 23.84x speedup in attention computation and up to 2.28x acceleration in end-to-end latency, while providing superior performance compared to state-of-the-art long-context inference methods.

### Dialogue Without Limits: Constant-Sized KV Caches for Extended Responses   in LLMs
**Authors**: Ravi Ghadia, Avinash Kumar, Gaurav Jain, Prashant Nair, Poulami Das

**Updated**: 2025-03-02T18:12:50Z

**Summary**: Autoregressive Transformers rely on Key-Value (KV) caching to accelerate inference. However, the linear growth of the KV cache with context length leads to excessive memory consumption and bandwidth constraints. This bottleneck is particularly problematic in real-time applications -- such as chatbots and interactive assistants -- where low latency and high memory efficiency are critical. Existing methods drop distant tokens or compress states in a lossy manner, sacrificing accuracy by discarding vital context or introducing bias.   We propose MorphKV, an inference-time technique that maintains a constant-sized KV cache while preserving accuracy. MorphKV balances long-range dependencies and local coherence during text generation. It eliminates early-token bias while retaining high-fidelity context by adaptively ranking tokens through correlation-aware selection. Unlike heuristic retention or lossy compression, MorphKV iteratively refines the KV cache via lightweight updates guided by attention patterns of recent tokens. This approach captures inter-token correlation with greater accuracy, crucial for tasks like content creation and code generation. Our studies on long-response tasks show 52.9$\%$ memory savings and 18.2$\%$ higher accuracy on average compared to state-of-the-art prior works, enabling efficient real-world deployment.

### When Attention Sink Emerges in Language Models: An Empirical View
**Authors**: Xiangming Gu, Tianyu Pang, Chao Du, Qian Liu, Fengzhuo Zhang, Cunxiao Du, Ye Wang, Min Lin

**Updated**: 2025-03-02T14:37:53Z

**Summary**: Language Models (LMs) assign significant attention to the first token, even if it is not semantically important, which is known as attention sink. This phenomenon has been widely adopted in applications such as streaming/long context generation, KV cache optimization, inference acceleration, model quantization, and others. Despite its widespread use, a deep understanding of attention sink in LMs is still lacking. In this work, we first demonstrate that attention sinks exist universally in LMs with various inputs, even in small models. Furthermore, attention sink is observed to emerge during the LM pre-training, motivating us to investigate how optimization, data distribution, loss function, and model architecture in LM pre-training influence its emergence. We highlight that attention sink emerges after effective optimization on sufficient training data. The sink position is highly correlated with the loss function and data distribution. Most importantly, we find that attention sink acts more like key biases, storing extra attention scores, which could be non-informative and not contribute to the value computation. We also observe that this phenomenon (at least partially) stems from tokens' inner dependence on attention scores as a result of softmax normalization. After relaxing such dependence by replacing softmax attention with other attention operations, such as sigmoid attention without normalization, attention sinks do not emerge in LMs up to 1B parameters. The code is available at https://github.com/sail-sg/Attention-Sink.

### MoSFormer: Augmenting Temporal Context with Memory of Surgery for   Surgical Phase Recognition
**Authors**: Hao Ding, Xu Lian, Mathias Unberath

**Updated**: 2025-03-02T02:26:21Z

**Summary**: Surgical phase recognition from video enables various downstream applications. Transformer-based sliding window approaches have set the state-of-the-art by capturing rich spatial-temporal features. However, while transformers can theoretically handle arbitrary-length sequences, in practice they are limited by memory and compute constraints, resulting in fixed context windows that struggle with maintaining temporal consistency across lengthy surgical procedures. This often leads to fragmented predictions and limited procedure-level understanding. To address these challenges, we propose Memory of Surgery (MoS), a framework that enriches temporal modeling by incorporating both semantic interpretable long-term surgical history and short-term impressions. MoSFormer, our enhanced transformer architecture, integrates MoS using a carefully designed encoding and fusion mechanism. We further introduce step filtering to refine history representation and develop a memory caching pipeline to improve training and inference stability, mitigating shortcut learning and overfitting. MoSFormer demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks. On the Challenging BernBypass70 benchmark, it attains 88.0 video-level accuracy and phase-level metrics of 70.7 precision, 68.7 recall, and 66.3 F1 score, outperforming its baseline with 2.1 video-level accuracy and phase-level metrics of 4.6 precision, 3.6 recall, and 3.8 F1 score. Further studies confirms the individual and combined benefits of long-term and short-term memory components through ablation and counterfactual inference. Qualitative results shows improved temporal consistency. The augmented temporal context enables procedure-level understanding, paving the way for more comprehensive surgical video analysis.

### IterGen: Iterative Semantic-aware Structured LLM Generation with   Backtracking
**Authors**: Shubham Ugare, Rohan Gumaste, Tarun Suresh, Gagandeep Singh, Sasa Misailovic

**Updated**: 2025-03-02T01:39:57Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used for tasks such as natural language and code generation, but their outputs often suffer from issues like hallucination, toxicity, and incorrect results. Current libraries for structured LLM generation rely on left-to-right decoding without support for backtracking, limiting the ability to correct or refine outputs mid-generation.   To address this, we introduce IterGen, a user-friendly library for iterative, grammar-guided LLM generation that enables users to move both forward and backward within the generated output based on grammar symbols. By leveraging a symbol-to-position mapping and maintaining the key-value (KV) cache state, IterGen ensures efficient and structured generation while allowing for corrections during the process. We demonstrate IterGen's effectiveness in two important applications: reducing privacy leakage in LLM outputs and improving the accuracy of LLM-generated SQL and Vega-Lite queries.   Our code and additional resources are available at https://structuredllm.com.

### Streaming Video Question-Answering with In-context Video KV-Cache   Retrieval
**Authors**: Shangzhe Di, Zhelun Yu, Guanghao Zhang, Haoyuan Li, Tao Zhong, Hao Cheng, Bolin Li, Wanggui He, Fangxun Shu, Hao Jiang

**Updated**: 2025-03-01T15:53:33Z

**Summary**: We propose ReKV, a novel training-free approach that enables efficient streaming video question-answering (StreamingVQA), by seamlessly integrating with existing Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs). Traditional VideoQA systems struggle with long videos, as they must process entire videos before responding to queries, and repeat this process for each new question. In contrast, our approach analyzes long videos in a streaming manner, allowing for prompt responses as soon as user queries are received. Building on a common Video-LLM, we first incorporate a sliding-window attention mechanism, ensuring that input frames attend to a limited number of preceding frames, thereby reducing computational overhead. To prevent information loss, we store processed video key-value caches (KV-Caches) in RAM and disk, reloading them into GPU memory as needed. Additionally, we introduce a retrieval method that leverages an external retriever or the parameters within Video-LLMs to retrieve only query-relevant KV-Caches, ensuring both efficiency and accuracy in question answering. ReKV enables the separation of video encoding and question-answering across different processes and GPUs, significantly enhancing the efficiency of StreamingVQA. Through comprehensive experimentation, we validate the efficacy and practicality of our approach, which significantly boosts efficiency and enhances applicability over existing VideoQA models.

### Progressive Sparse Attention: Algorithm and System Co-design for   Efficient Attention in LLM Serving
**Authors**: Qihui Zhou, Peiqi Yin, Pengfei Zuo, James Cheng

**Updated**: 2025-03-01T07:56:42Z

**Summary**: Processing long contexts has become a critical capability for modern large language models (LLMs). However, serving long-context LLMs comes with significant inference costs due to the high memory overhead of the key-value (KV) cache. Existing work leverages dynamic sparse attention algorithms (DSAes) to mitigate the KV cache overhead, but these algorithms rely on top-$k$ KV cache selection, which results in a trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. A larger $k$ improves accuracy but decreases efficiency, while a smaller $k$ boosts efficiency but compromises accuracy. To overcome this trade-off, this paper presents PSA, a $\underline{P}$rogressive $\underline{S}$parse $\underline{A}$ttention mechanism that integrates algorithmic innovations with system co-design to achieve both high inference accuracy and improved efficiency in LLM serving. The PSA algorithm adaptively adjusts the KV cache budget of different tokens and layers according to their real attention weight distributions, rather than relying on a fixed budget $k$. This enables high accuracy while minimizing KV cache usage. To further enhance execution efficiency, we introduce a pipelined iteration scheme that reduces CPU-GPU interleaving and synchronization overhead during PSA computation. Additionally, we implement unified GPU memory management that optimizes PSA's memory utilization by accounting for uneven memory requirements across different model layers. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that PSA reduces KV cache usage for attention computation by up to 2.4$\times$ and 8.8$\times$, and increases end-to-end serving throughput by up to 1.4$\times$ and 2.0$\times$, compared to state-of-the-art DSAes and systems without sparse attention, respectively.

### A Unified Framework for Automated Code Transformation and Pragma   Insertion
**Authors**: Stéphane Pouget, Louis-Noël Pouchet, Jason Cong

**Updated**: 2025-03-01T05:43:19Z

**Summary**: High-level synthesis, source-to-source compilers, and various Design Space Exploration techniques for pragma insertion have significantly improved the Quality of Results of generated designs. These tools offer benefits such as reduced development time and enhanced performance. However, achieving high-quality results often requires additional manual code transformations and tiling selections, which are typically performed separately or as pre-processing steps. Although DSE techniques enable code transformation upfront, the vastness of the search space often limits the exploration of all possible code transformations, making it challenging to determine which transformations are necessary. Additionally, ensuring correctness remains challenging, especially for complex transformations and optimizations.   To tackle this obstacle, we first propose a comprehensive framework leveraging HLS compilers. Our system streamlines code transformation, pragma insertion, and tiles size selection for on-chip data caching through a unified optimization problem, aiming to enhance parallelization, particularly beneficial for computation-bound kernels. Them employing a novel Non-Linear Programming (NLP) approach, we simultaneously ascertain transformations, pragmas, and tile sizes, focusing on regular loop-based kernels. Our evaluation demonstrates that our framework adeptly identifies the appropriate transformations, including scenarios where no transformation is necessary, and inserts pragmas to achieve a favorable Quality of Results.

### FLStore: Efficient Federated Learning Storage for non-training workloads
**Authors**: Ahmad Faraz Khan, Samuel Fountain, Ahmed M. Abdelmoniem, Ali R. Butt, Ali Anwar

**Updated**: 2025-03-01T03:20:30Z

**Summary**: Federated Learning (FL) is an approach for privacy-preserving Machine Learning (ML), enabling model training across multiple clients without centralized data collection. With an aggregator server coordinating training, aggregating model updates, and storing metadata across rounds. In addition to training, a substantial part of FL systems are the non-training workloads such as scheduling, personalization, clustering, debugging, and incentivization. Most existing systems rely on the aggregator to handle non-training workloads and use cloud services for data storage. This results in high latency and increased costs as non-training workloads rely on large volumes of metadata, including weight parameters from client updates, hyperparameters, and aggregated updates across rounds, making the situation even worse. We propose FLStore, a serverless framework for efficient FL non-training workloads and storage. FLStore unifies the data and compute planes on a serverless cache, enabling locality-aware execution via tailored caching policies to reduce latency and costs. Per our evaluations, compared to cloud object store based aggregator server FLStore reduces per request average latency by 71% and costs by 92.45%, with peak improvements of 99.7% and 98.8%, respectively. Compared to an in-memory cloud cache based aggregator server, FLStore reduces average latency by 64.6% and costs by 98.83%, with peak improvements of 98.8% and 99.6%, respectively. FLStore integrates seamlessly with existing FL frameworks with minimal modifications, while also being fault-tolerant and highly scalable.

### Cache Me If You Must: Adaptive Key-Value Quantization for Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Alina Shutova, Vladimir Malinovskii, Vage Egiazarian, Denis Kuznedelev, Denis Mazur, Nikita Surkov, Ivan Ermakov, Dan Alistarh

**Updated**: 2025-02-28T18:04:52Z

**Summary**: Efficient real-world deployments of large language models (LLMs) rely on Key-Value (KV) caching for processing and generating long outputs, reducing the need for repetitive computation. For large contexts, Key-Value caches can take up tens of gigabytes of device memory, as they store vector representations for each token and layer. Recent work has shown that the cached vectors can be compressed through quantization, pruning or merging, but these techniques often compromise quality towards higher compression rates. In this work, we aim to improve Key & Value compression by exploiting two observations: 1) the inherent dependencies between keys and values across different layers, and 2) high-compression mechanisms for internal network states. We propose AQUA-KV, an adaptive quantization for Key-Value caches that relies on compact adapters to exploit existing dependencies between Keys and Values, and aims to "optimally" compress the information that cannot be predicted. AQUA-KV significantly improves compression rates, while maintaining high accuracy on state-of-the-art LLM families. On Llama 3.2 LLMs, we achieve near-lossless inference at 2-2.5 bits per value with under $1\%$ relative error in perplexity and LongBench scores. AQUA-KV is one-shot, simple, and efficient: it can be calibrated on a single GPU within 1-6 hours, even for 70B models.

### Distributed Data Access in Industrial Edge Networks
**Authors**: Theofanis P. Raptis, Andrea Passarella, Marco Conti

**Updated**: 2025-02-28T14:54:35Z

**Summary**: Wireless edge networks in smart industrial environments increasingly operate using advanced sensors and autonomous machines interacting with each other and generating huge amounts of data. Those huge amounts of data are bound to make data management (e.g., for processing, storing, computing) a big challenge. Current data management approaches, relying primarily on centralized data storage, might not be able to cope with the scalability and real time requirements of Industry 4.0 environments, while distributed solutions are increasingly being explored. In this paper, we introduce the problem of distributed data access in multi-hop wireless industrial edge deployments, whereby a set of consumer nodes needs to access data stored in a set of data cache nodes, satisfying the industrial data access delay requirements and at the same time maximizing the network lifetime. We prove that the introduced problem is computationally intractable and, after formulating the objective function, we design a two-step algorithm in order to address it. We use an open testbed with real devices for conducting an experimental investigation on the performance of the algorithm. Then, we provide two online improvements, so that the data distribution can dynamically change before the first node in the network runs out of energy. We compare the performance of the methods via simulations for different numbers of network nodes and data consumers, and we show significant lifetime prolongation and increased energy efficiency when employing the method which is using only decentralized low-power wireless communication instead of the method which is using also centralized local area wireless communication.

### Training-free and Adaptive Sparse Attention for Efficient Long Video   Generation
**Authors**: Yifei Xia, Suhan Ling, Fangcheng Fu, Yujie Wang, Huixia Li, Xuefeng Xiao, Bin Cui

**Updated**: 2025-02-28T14:11:20Z

**Summary**: Generating high-fidelity long videos with Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) is often hindered by significant latency, primarily due to the computational demands of attention mechanisms. For instance, generating an 8-second 720p video (110K tokens) with HunyuanVideo takes about 600 PFLOPs, with around 500 PFLOPs consumed by attention computations. To address this issue, we propose AdaSpa, the first Dynamic Pattern and Online Precise Search sparse attention method. Firstly, to realize the Dynamic Pattern, we introduce a blockified pattern to efficiently capture the hierarchical sparsity inherent in DiTs. This is based on our observation that sparse characteristics of DiTs exhibit hierarchical and blockified structures between and within different modalities. This blockified approach significantly reduces the complexity of attention computation while maintaining high fidelity in the generated videos. Secondly, to enable Online Precise Search, we propose the Fused LSE-Cached Search with Head-adaptive Hierarchical Block Sparse Attention. This method is motivated by our finding that DiTs' sparse pattern and LSE vary w.r.t. inputs, layers, and heads, but remain invariant across denoising steps. By leveraging this invariance across denoising steps, it adapts to the dynamic nature of DiTs and allows for precise, real-time identification of sparse indices with minimal overhead. AdaSpa is implemented as an adaptive, plug-and-play solution and can be integrated seamlessly with existing DiTs, requiring neither additional fine-tuning nor a dataset-dependent profiling. Extensive experiments validate that AdaSpa delivers substantial acceleration across various models while preserving video quality, establishing itself as a robust and scalable approach to efficient video generation.

### SelectLLM: Query-Aware Efficient Selection Algorithm for Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Kaushal Kumar Maurya, KV Aditya Srivatsa, Ekaterina Kochmar

**Updated**: 2025-02-28T13:23:56Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely adopted due to their remarkable performance across various applications, driving the accelerated development of a large number of diverse models. However, these individual LLMs show limitations in generalization and performance on complex tasks due to inherent training biases, model size constraints, and the quality or diversity of pre-training datasets. A promising direction is to efficiently harness the diverse capabilities of LLMs to overcome these individual limitations. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel LLM selection algorithm called SelectLLM, which efficiently directs input queries to the most suitable subset of LLMs from a large pool, ensuring that the selected models collectively provide accurate responses. SelectLLM employs a multi-label classifier and policy based on the classifier's predictions and confidence scores in selecting an optimal, query-aware, and lightweight subset of LLMs. Our findings indicate that the proposed model outperforms existing ensemble-based baselines and achieves competitive performance with similarly sized top-performing LLMs while maintaining efficiency. Specifically, it achieves a huge reduction in inference latency on two challenging reasoning benchmarks: 13% on GSM8K and 70% on MMLU, compared to the top-performing baseline. Also, we establish a theoretical upper bound by an Oracle with LLMs and perform an in-depth linguistic analysis to understand the performance gap between the Oracle and SelectLLM.

### Training-Free Exponential Context Extension via Cascading KV Cache
**Authors**: Jeffrey Willette, Heejun Lee, Youngwan Lee, Myeongjae Jeon, Sung Ju Hwang

**Updated**: 2025-02-28T13:08:44Z

**Summary**: The transformer's context window is vital for tasks such as few-shot learning and conditional generation as it preserves previous tokens for active memory. However, as the context lengths increase, the computational costs grow quadratically, hindering the deployment of large language models (LLMs) in real-world, long sequence scenarios. Although some recent key-value caching (KV Cache) methods offer linear inference complexity, they naively manage the stored context, prematurely evicting tokens and losing valuable information. Moreover, they lack an optimized prefill/prompt stage strategy, resulting in higher latency than even quadratic attention for realistic context sizes. In response, we introduce a novel mechanism that leverages cascading sub-cache buffers to selectively retain the most relevant tokens, enabling the model to maintain longer context histories without increasing the cache size. Our approach outperforms linear caching baselines across key benchmarks, including streaming perplexity, question answering, book summarization, and passkey retrieval, where it retains better retrieval accuracy at 1M tokens after four doublings of the cache size of 65K. Additionally, our method reduces prefill stage latency by a factor of 6.8 when compared to flash attention on 1M tokens. These innovations not only enhance the computational efficiency of LLMs but also pave the way for their effective deployment in resource-constrained environments, enabling large-scale, real-time applications with significantly reduced latency.

### Towards Reliable Vector Database Management Systems: A Software Testing   Roadmap for 2030
**Authors**: Shenao Wang, Yanjie Zhao, Yinglin Xie, Zhao Liu, Xinyi Hou, Quanchen Zou, Haoyu Wang

**Updated**: 2025-02-28T07:56:37Z

**Summary**: The rapid growth of Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI-driven applications has propelled Vector Database Management Systems (VDBMSs) into the spotlight as a critical infrastructure component. VDBMS specializes in storing, indexing, and querying dense vector embeddings, enabling advanced LLM capabilities such as retrieval-augmented generation, long-term memory, and caching mechanisms. However, the explosive adoption of VDBMS has outpaced the development of rigorous software testing methodologies tailored for these emerging systems. Unlike traditional databases optimized for structured data, VDBMS face unique testing challenges stemming from the high-dimensional nature of vector data, the fuzzy semantics in vector search, and the need to support dynamic data scaling and hybrid query processing. In this paper, we begin by conducting an empirical study of VDBMS defects and identify key challenges in test input generation, oracle definition, and test evaluation. Drawing from these insights, we propose the first comprehensive research roadmap for developing effective testing methodologies tailored to VDBMS. By addressing these challenges, the software testing community can contribute to the development of more reliable and trustworthy VDBMS, enabling the full potential of LLMs and data-intensive AI applications.

### Cache-of-Thought: Master-Apprentice Framework for Cost-Effective Vision   Language Model Inference
**Authors**: Mingyuan Wu, Jize Jiang, Haozhen Zheng, Meitang Li, Zhaoheng Li, Beitong Tian, Bo Chen, Yongjoo Park, Minjia Zhang, Chengxiang Zhai, Klara Nahrstedt

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T23:09:20Z

**Summary**: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success in a wide range of vision applications of increasing complexity and scales, yet choosing the right VLM model size involves a trade-off between response quality and cost. While smaller VLMs are cheaper to run, they typically produce responses only marginally better than random guessing on benchmarks such as MMMU.   In this paper, we propose Cache of Thought (CoT), a master apprentice framework for collaborative inference between large and small VLMs. CoT manages high quality query results from large VLMs (master) in a cache, which are then selected via a novel multi modal retrieval and in-context learning to aid the performance of small VLMs (apprentice). We extensively evaluate CoT on various widely recognized and challenging general VQA benchmarks, and show that CoT increases overall VQA performance by up to 7.7% under the same budget, and specifically boosts the performance of apprentice VLMs by up to 36.6%.

### WWW: What, When, Where to Compute-in-Memory
**Authors**: Tanvi Sharma, Mustafa Ali, Indranil Chakraborty, Kaushik Roy

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T21:50:48Z

**Summary**: Matrix multiplication is the dominant computation during Machine Learning (ML) inference. To efficiently perform such multiplication operations, Compute-in-memory (CiM) paradigms have emerged as a highly energy efficient solution. However, integrating compute in memory poses key questions, such as 1) What type of CiM to use: Given a multitude of CiM design characteristics, determining their suitability from architecture perspective is needed. 2) When to use CiM: ML inference includes workloads with a variety of memory and compute requirements, making it difficult to identify when CiM is more beneficial than standard processing cores. 3) Where to integrate CiM: Each memory level has different bandwidth and capacity, creating different data reuse opportunities for CiM integration.   To answer such questions regarding on-chip CiM integration for accelerating ML workloads, we use an analytical architecture-evaluation methodology with tailored mapping algorithm. The mapping algorithm aims to achieve highest weight reuse and reduced data movements for a given CiM prototype and workload. Our analysis considers the integration of CiM prototypes into the cache levels of a tensor-core-like architecture, and shows that CiM integrated memory improves energy efficiency by up to 3.4x and throughput by up to 15.6x compared to established baseline with INT-8 precision. We believe the proposed work provides insights into what type of CiM to use, and when and where to optimally integrate it in the cache hierarchy for efficient matrix multiplication.

### An Attempt to Catch Up with JIT Compilers: The False Lead of Optimizing   Inline Caches
**Authors**: Aurore Poirier, Erven Rohou, Manuel Serrano

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T21:42:49Z

**Summary**: Context: Just-in-Time (JIT) compilers are able to specialize the code they generate according to a continuous profiling of the running programs. This gives them an advantage when compared to Ahead-of-Time (AoT) compilers that must choose the code to generate once for all.   Inquiry: Is it possible to improve the performance of AoT compilers by adding Dynamic Binary Modification (DBM) to the executions?   Approach: We added to the Hopc AoT JavaScript compiler a new optimization based on DBM to the inline cache (IC), a classical optimization dynamic languages use to implement object property accesses efficiently.   Knowledge: Reducing the number of memory accesses as the new optimization does, does not shorten execution times on contemporary architectures.   Grounding: The DBM optimization we have implemented is fully operational on x86_64 architectures. We have conducted several experiments to evaluate its impact on performance and to study the reasons of the lack of acceleration.   Importance: The (negative) result we present in this paper sheds new light on the best strategy to be used to implement dynamic languages. It tells that the old days were removing instructions or removing memory reads always yielded to speed up is over. Nowadays, implementing sophisticated compiler optimizations is only worth the effort if the processor is not able by itself to accelerate the code. This result applies to AoT compilers as well as JIT compilers.

### Long-Context Inference with Retrieval-Augmented Speculative Decoding
**Authors**: Guanzheng Chen, Qilong Feng, Jinjie Ni, Xin Li, Michael Qizhe Shieh

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T17:59:36Z

**Summary**: The emergence of long-context large language models (LLMs) offers a promising alternative to traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for processing extensive documents. However, the computational overhead of long-context inference, particularly in managing key-value (KV) caches, presents significant efficiency challenges. While Speculative Decoding (SD) traditionally accelerates inference using smaller draft models, its effectiveness diminishes substantially in long-context scenarios due to memory-bound KV cache operations. We present Retrieval-Augmented Speculative Decoding (RAPID), which leverages RAG for both accelerating and enhancing generation quality in long-context inference. RAPID introduces the RAG drafter-a draft LLM operating on shortened retrieval contexts-to speculate on the generation of long-context target LLMs. Our approach enables a new paradigm where same-scale or even larger LLMs can serve as RAG drafters while maintaining computational efficiency. To fully leverage the potentially superior capabilities from stronger RAG drafters, we develop an inference-time knowledge transfer dynamic that enriches the target distribution by RAG. Extensive experiments on the LLaMA-3.1 and Qwen2.5 backbones demonstrate that RAPID effectively integrates the strengths of both approaches, achieving significant performance improvements (e.g., from 39.33 to 42.83 on InfiniteBench for LLaMA-3.1-8B) with more than 2x speedups. Our analyses reveal that RAPID achieves robust acceleration beyond 32K context length and demonstrates superior generation quality in real-world applications.

### EMS: Adaptive Evict-then-Merge Strategy for Head-wise KV Cache   Compression Based on Global-Local Importance
**Authors**: Yingxin Li, Ye Li, Yuan Meng, Xinzhu Ma, Zihan Geng, Shutao Xia, Zhi Wang

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T15:29:03Z

**Summary**: As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, the demand for higher quality and faster processing of long contexts across various applications is growing. KV cache is widely adopted as it stores previously generated key and value tokens, effectively reducing redundant computations during inference. However, as memory overhead becomes a significant concern, efficient compression of KV cache has gained increasing attention. Most existing methods perform compression from two perspectives: identifying important tokens and designing compression strategies. However, these approaches often produce biased distributions of important tokens due to the influence of accumulated attention scores or positional encoding. Furthermore, they overlook the sparsity and redundancy across different heads, which leads to difficulties in preserving the most effective information at the head level. To this end, we propose EMS to overcome these limitations, while achieving better KV cache compression under extreme compression ratios. Specifically, we introduce a Global-Local score that combines accumulated attention scores from both global and local KV tokens to better identify the token importance. For the compression strategy, we design an adaptive and unified Evict-then-Merge framework that accounts for the sparsity and redundancy of KV tokens across different heads. Additionally, we implement the head-wise parallel compression through a zero-class mechanism to enhance efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate our SOTA performance even under extreme compression ratios. EMS consistently achieves the lowest perplexity, improves scores by over 1.28 points across four LLMs on LongBench under a 256 cache budget, and preserves 95% retrieval accuracy with a cache budget less than 2% of the context length in the Needle-in-a-Haystack task.

**Authors**: Yuhui Xu, Zhanming Jie, Hanze Dong, Lei Wang, Xudong Lu, Aojun Zhou, Amrita Saha, Caiming Xiong, Doyen Sahoo

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T12:30:43Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized the field of natural language processing, achieving unprecedented performance across a variety of applications. However, their increased computational and memory demands present significant challenges, especially when handling long sequences. This paper focuses on the long-context scenario, addressing the inefficiencies in KV cache memory consumption during inference. Unlike existing approaches that optimize the memory based on the sequence length, we identify substantial redundancy in the channel dimension of the KV cache, as indicated by an uneven magnitude distribution and a low-rank structure in the attention weights. In response, we propose ThinK, a novel query-dependent KV cache pruning method designed to minimize attention weight loss while selectively pruning the least significant channels. Our approach not only maintains or enhances model accuracy but also achieves a reduction in KV cache memory costs by over 20% compared with vanilla KV cache eviction and quantization methods. For instance, ThinK integrated with KIVI can achieve a 2.8x reduction in peak memory usage while maintaining nearly the same quality, enabling up to a 5x increase in batch size when using a single GPU. Extensive evaluations on the LLaMA and Mistral models across various long-sequence datasets verified the efficiency of ThinK, establishing a new baseline algorithm for efficient LLM deployment without compromising performance. Our code has been made available at https://github.com/SalesforceAIResearch/ThinK.

### Persistent Sampling: Enhancing the Efficiency of Sequential Monte Carlo
**Authors**: Minas Karamanis, Uroš Seljak

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T12:15:38Z

**Summary**: Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) samplers are powerful tools for Bayesian inference but suffer from high computational costs due to their reliance on large particle ensembles for accurate estimates. We introduce persistent sampling (PS), an extension of SMC that systematically retains and reuses particles from all prior iterations to construct a growing, weighted ensemble. By leveraging multiple importance sampling and resampling from a mixture of historical distributions, PS mitigates the need for excessively large particle counts, directly addressing key limitations of SMC such as particle impoverishment and mode collapse. Crucially, PS achieves this without additional likelihood evaluations-weights for persistent particles are computed using cached likelihood values. This framework not only yields more accurate posterior approximations but also produces marginal likelihood estimates with significantly lower variance, enhancing reliability in model comparison. Furthermore, the persistent ensemble enables efficient adaptation of transition kernels by leveraging a larger, decorrelated particle pool. Experiments on high-dimensional Gaussian mixtures, hierarchical models, and non-convex targets demonstrate that PS consistently outperforms standard SMC and related variants, including recycled and waste-free SMC, achieving substantial reductions in mean squared error for posterior expectations and evidence estimates, all at reduced computational cost. PS thus establishes itself as a robust, scalable, and efficient alternative for complex Bayesian inference tasks.

### Dynamic Parallel Tree Search for Efficient LLM Reasoning
**Authors**: Yifu Ding, Wentao Jiang, Shunyu Liu, Yongcheng Jing, Jinyang Guo, Yingjie Wang, Jing Zhang, Zengmao Wang, Ziwei Liu, Bo Du, Xianglong Liu, Dacheng Tao

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T06:39:06Z

**Summary**: Tree of Thoughts (ToT) enhances Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning by structuring problem-solving as a spanning tree. However, recent methods focus on search accuracy while overlooking computational efficiency. The challenges of accelerating the ToT lie in the frequent switching of reasoning focus, and the redundant exploration of suboptimal solutions. To alleviate this dilemma, we propose Dynamic Parallel Tree Search (DPTS), a novel parallelism framework that aims to dynamically optimize the reasoning path in inference. It includes the Parallelism Streamline in the generation phase to build up a flexible and adaptive parallelism with arbitrary paths by fine-grained cache management and alignment. Meanwhile, the Search and Transition Mechanism filters potential candidates to dynamically maintain the reasoning focus on more possible solutions and have less redundancy. Experiments on Qwen-2.5 and Llama-3 with Math500 and GSM8K datasets show that DPTS significantly improves efficiency by 2-4x on average while maintaining or even surpassing existing reasoning algorithms in accuracy, making ToT-based reasoning more scalable and computationally efficient.

### Breaking the Low-Rank Dilemma of Linear Attention
**Authors**: Qihang Fan, Huaibo Huang, Ran He

**Updated**: 2025-02-27T03:22:41Z

**Summary**: The Softmax attention mechanism in Transformer models is notoriously computationally expensive, particularly due to its quadratic complexity, posing significant challenges in vision applications. In contrast, linear attention provides a far more efficient solution by reducing the complexity to linear levels. However, compared to Softmax attention, linear attention often experiences significant performance degradation. Our experiments indicate that this performance drop is due to the low-rank nature of linear attention's feature map, which hinders its ability to adequately model complex spatial information. In this paper, to break the low-rank dilemma of linear attention, we conduct rank analysis from two perspectives: the KV buffer and the output features. Consequently, we introduce Rank-Augmented Linear Attention (RALA), which rivals the performance of Softmax attention while maintaining linear complexity and high efficiency. Based on RALA, we construct the Rank-Augmented Vision Linear Transformer (RAVLT). Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAVLT achieves excellent performance across various vision tasks. Specifically, without using any additional labels, data, or supervision during training, RAVLT achieves an 84.4% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1k with only 26M parameters and 4.6G FLOPs. This result significantly surpasses previous linear attention mechanisms, fully illustrating the potential of RALA. Code will be available at https://github.com/qhfan/RALA.

### Learning Harmonized Representations for Speculative Sampling
**Authors**: Lefan Zhang, Xiaodan Wang, Yanhua Huang, Ruiwen Xu

**Updated**: 2025-02-26T11:47:58Z

**Summary**: Speculative sampling is a promising approach to accelerate the decoding stage for Large Language Models (LLMs). Recent advancements that leverage target LLM's contextual information, such as hidden states and KV cache, have shown significant practical improvements. However, these approaches suffer from inconsistent context between training and decoding. We also observe another discrepancy between the training and decoding objectives in existing speculative sampling methods. In this work, we propose a solution named HArmonized Speculative Sampling (HASS) that learns harmonized representations to address these issues. HASS accelerates the decoding stage without adding inference overhead through harmonized objective distillation and harmonized context alignment. Experiments on four LLaMA models demonstrate that HASS achieves 2.81x-4.05x wall-clock time speedup ratio averaging across three datasets, surpassing EAGLE-2 by 8%-20%. The code is available at https://github.com/HArmonizedSS/HASS.

### Faster Diffusion via Temporal Attention Decomposition
**Authors**: Haozhe Liu, Wentian Zhang, Jinheng Xie, Francesco Faccio, Mengmeng Xu, Tao Xiang, Mike Zheng Shou, Juan-Manuel Perez-Rua, Jürgen Schmidhuber

**Updated**: 2025-02-26T10:49:33Z

**Summary**: We explore the role of attention mechanism during inference in text-conditional diffusion models. Empirical observations suggest that cross-attention outputs converge to a fixed point after several inference steps. The convergence time naturally divides the entire inference process into two phases: an initial phase for planning text-oriented visual semantics, which are then translated into images in a subsequent fidelity-improving phase. Cross-attention is essential in the initial phase but almost irrelevant thereafter. However, self-attention initially plays a minor role but becomes crucial in the second phase. These findings yield a simple and training-free method known as temporally gating the attention (TGATE), which efficiently generates images by caching and reusing attention outputs at scheduled time steps. Experimental results show when widely applied to various existing text-conditional diffusion models, TGATE accelerates these models by 10%-50%. The code of TGATE is available at https://github.com/HaozheLiu-ST/T-GATE.

### From Hours to Minutes: Lossless Acceleration of Ultra Long Sequence   Generation up to 100K Tokens
**Authors**: Tong Wu, Junzhe Shen, Zixia Jia, Yuxuan Wang, Zilong Zheng

**Updated**: 2025-02-26T07:10:08Z

**Summary**: Generating ultra-long sequences with large language models (LLMs) has become increasingly crucial but remains a highly time-intensive task, particularly for sequences up to 100K tokens. While traditional speculative decoding methods exist, simply extending their generation limits fails to accelerate the process and can be detrimental. Through an in-depth analysis, we identify three major challenges hindering efficient generation: frequent model reloading, dynamic key-value (KV) management and repetitive generation. To address these issues, we introduce TOKENSWIFT, a novel framework designed to substantially accelerate the generation process of ultra-long sequences while maintaining the target model's inherent quality. Experimental results demonstrate that TOKENSWIFT achieves over 3 times speedup across models of varying scales (1.5B, 7B, 8B, 14B) and architectures (MHA, GQA). This acceleration translates to hours of time savings for ultra-long sequence generation, establishing TOKENSWIFT as a scalable and effective solution at unprecedented lengths. Code can be found at https://github.com/bigai-nlco/TokenSwift.

### AttentionPredictor: Temporal Pattern Matters for Efficient LLM Inference
**Authors**: Qingyue Yang, Jie Wang, Xing Li, Zhihai Wang, Chen Chen, Lei Chen, Xianzhi Yu, Wulong Liu, Jianye Hao, Mingxuan Yuan, Bin Li

**Updated**: 2025-02-26T02:48:22Z

**Summary**: With the development of large language models (LLMs), efficient inference through Key-Value (KV) cache compression has attracted considerable attention, especially for long-context generation. To compress the KV cache, recent methods identify critical KV tokens through heuristic ranking with attention scores. However, these methods often struggle to accurately determine critical tokens as they neglect the \textit{temporal patterns} in attention scores, resulting in a noticeable degradation in LLM performance. To address this challenge, we propose AttentionPredictor, which is the first learning-based critical token identification approach. Specifically, AttentionPredictor learns a lightweight convolution model to capture spatiotemporal patterns and predict the next-token attention score. An appealing feature of AttentionPredictor is that it accurately predicts the attention score while consuming negligible memory. Moreover, we propose a cross-token critical cache prefetching framework that hides the token estimation time overhead to accelerate the decoding stage. By retaining most of the attention information, AttentionPredictor achieves 16$\times$ KV cache compression with comparable LLM performance, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art.

### M-ANT: Efficient Low-bit Group Quantization for LLMs via Mathematically   Adaptive Numerical Type
**Authors**: Weiming Hu, Haoyan Zhang, Cong Guo, Yu Feng, Renyang Guan, Zhendong Hua, Zihan Liu, Yue Guan, Minyi Guo, Jingwen Leng

**Updated**: 2025-02-26T02:16:46Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are one of the most important killer computer applications. The recent algorithmic advancement proposes a fine-grained group-wise quantization for LLMs, which treats a small set (e.g., 64) of values in a tensor as a compression unit. It effectively preserves the model accuracy without retraining, and has become the standard approach to efficiently deploy LLMs. On the other hand, there are works that propose various adaptive data types to better adapt to different distributions and further reduce the required bit length for LLMs. In this work, our detailed analysis unveils a key finding that while different tensors exhibit similar distributions, small groups can have markedly different distributions. As such, the group-level diversity requires a new level of adaptivity for which existing adaptive data types fail to provide.   In this paper, we propose MANT, a mathematically adaptive numeric type, featuring a more flexible encoding paradigm with a wider range of data distribution and more efficient decodingcomputation fusion mechanism to address these challenges. Based on MANT, we develop a supporting framework to assign the appropriate data type for each group adaptively. Meanwhile, the dynamically generated Key-Value (KV) caches in LLMs introduce further complexity for real-time quantization. To tackle this, we propose an efficient real-time quantization mechanism. Besides, we implement a specific processing element (PE) to efficiently support MANT and incorporate a real-time quantization unit. By integrating these components into a systolic array, MANT unifies the group-wise weight and KV cache quantization and addresses the associated challenges. Our evaluation shows achieving, on average, 2.99x (up to 4.46x) speedup and 2.81x (up to 4.10x) energy reduction to the state-of-the-art LLM accelerator.

### AgileWatts: An Energy-Efficient CPU Core Idle-State Architecture for   Latency-Sensitive Server Applications

**Updated**: 2025-02-25T13:03:44Z

**Summary**: User-facing applications running in modern datacenters exhibit irregular request patterns and are implemented using a multitude of services with tight latency requirements. These characteristics render ineffective existing energy conserving techniques when processors are idle due to the long transition time from a deep idle power state (C-state). While prior works propose management techniques to mitigate this inefficiency, we tackle it at its root with AgileWatts (AW): a new deep C-state architecture optimized for datacenter server processors targeting latency-sensitive applications. AW is based on three key ideas. First, AW eliminates the latency overhead of saving/restoring the core context (i.e., micro-architectural state) when powering-off/-on the core in a deep idle power state by i) implementing medium-grained power-gates, carefully distributed across the CPU core, and ii) retaining context in the power-ungated domain. Second, AW eliminates the flush latency overhead (several tens of microseconds) of the L1/L2 caches when entering a deep idle power state by keeping L1/L2 cache content power-ungated. A minimal control logic also remains power-ungated to serve cache coherence traffic (i.e., snoops) seamlessly. AW implements sleep-mode in caches to reduce caches leakage power consumption and lowers a core voltage to the minimum operational voltage level to minimize the leakage power of the power-ungated domain. Third, using a state-of-the-art power efficient all-digital phase-locked loop (ADPLL) clock generator, AW keeps the PLL active and locked during the idle state, further cutting precious microseconds of wake-up latency at a negligible power cost. Our evaluation with an accurate simulator calibrated against an Intel Skylake server shows that AW reduces the energy consumption of Memcached by up to 71% (35% on average) with up to 1% performance degradation.

### Accelerating Graph Indexing for ANNS on Modern CPUs
**Authors**: Mengzhao Wang, Haotian Wu, Xiangyu Ke, Yunjun Gao, Yifan Zhu, Wenchao Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-02-25T11:36:43Z

**Summary**: In high-dimensional vector spaces, Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) is a key component in database and artificial intelligence infrastructures. Graph-based methods, particularly HNSW, have emerged as leading solutions among various ANNS approaches, offering an impressive trade-off between search efficiency and accuracy. Many modern vector databases utilize graph indexes as their core algorithms, benefiting from various optimizations to enhance search performance. However, the high indexing time associated with graph algorithms poses a significant challenge, especially given the increasing volume of data, query processing complexity, and dynamic index maintenance demand. This has rendered indexing time a critical performance metric for users. In this paper, we comprehensively analyze the underlying causes of the low graph indexing efficiency on modern CPUs, identifying that distance computation dominates indexing time, primarily due to high memory access latency and suboptimal arithmetic operation efficiency. We demonstrate that distance comparisons during index construction can be effectively performed using compact vector codes at an appropriate compression error. Drawing from insights gained through integrating existing compact coding methods in the graph indexing process, we propose a novel compact coding strategy, named Flash, designed explicitly for graph indexing and optimized for modern CPU architectures. By minimizing random memory accesses and maximizing the utilization of SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) instructions, Flash significantly enhances cache hit rates and arithmetic operations. Extensive experiments conducted on eight real-world datasets, ranging from ten million to one billion vectors, exhibit that Flash achieves a speedup of 10.4$\times$ to 22.9$\times$ in index construction efficiency, while maintaining or improving search performance.

**Authors**: Tianrui Zhu, Shiyi Zhang, Jiawei Shao, Yansong Tang

**Updated**: 2025-02-25T09:42:11Z

**Summary**: Background consistency remains a significant challenge in image editing tasks. Despite extensive developments, existing works still face a trade-off between maintaining similarity to the original image and generating content that aligns with the target. Here, we propose KV-Edit, a training-free approach that uses KV cache in DiTs to maintain background consistency, where background tokens are preserved rather than regenerated, eliminating the need for complex mechanisms or expensive training, ultimately generating new content that seamlessly integrates with the background within user-provided regions. We further explore the memory consumption of the KV cache during editing and optimize the space complexity to $O(1)$ using an inversion-free method. Our approach is compatible with any DiT-based generative model without additional training. Experiments demonstrate that KV-Edit significantly outperforms existing approaches in terms of both background and image quality, even surpassing training-based methods.

### KVTuner: Sensitivity-Aware Layer-wise Mixed Precision KV Cache   Quantization for Efficient and Nearly Lossless LLM Inference
**Authors**: Xing Li, Zeyu Xing, Yiming Li, Linping Qu, Hui-Ling Zhen, Wulong Liu, Yiwu Yao, Sinno Jialin Pan, Mingxuan Yuan

**Updated**: 2025-02-25T03:42:15Z

**Summary**: KV cache quantization can improve Large Language Models (LLMs) inference throughput and latency in long contexts and large batch-size scenarios while preserving LLMs effectiveness. However, current methods have three unsolved issues: overlooking layer-wise sensitivity to KV cache quantization, high overhead of online fine-grained decision-making, and low flexibility to different LLMs and constraints. Therefore, we thoroughly analyze the inherent correlation of layer-wise transformer attention patterns to KV cache quantization errors and study why key cache is more important than value cache for quantization error reduction. We further propose a simple yet effective framework KVTuner to adaptively search for the optimal hardware-friendly layer-wise KV quantization precision pairs for coarse-grained KV cache with multi-objective optimization and directly utilize the offline searched configurations during online inference. To reduce the computational cost of offline calibration, we utilize the intra-layer KV precision pair pruning and inter-layer clustering to reduce the search space. Experimental results show that we can achieve nearly lossless 3.25-bit mixed precision KV cache quantization for LLMs like Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and 4.0-bit for sensitive models like Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct on mathematical reasoning tasks. The maximum inference throughput can be improved by 38.3% compared with KV8 quantization over various context lengths. Our code and searched configurations are available at https://github.com/cmd2001/KVTuner.

**Updated**: 2025-02-24T19:48:48Z

**Summary**: Log-Structured Merge-tree-based Key-Value Store (LSM-KVS) is a foundational storage engine serving diverse modern workloads, systems, and applications. To suit varying use cases, LSM-KVS allows a vast configuration space that controls core parameters like compaction, flush, and cache sizes, each consuming a shared pool of CPU, Memory, and Storage resources. Navigating the LSM-KVS configuration space necessitates knowledge of the impact of each configuration on the expected workload and underlying hardware. Beyond expensive and time-intensive human-expert-based tuning, existing LSM-KVS tuning solutions focus on tuning with specific workload expectations while limited to a narrow subset of parameters.   This paper introduces ELMo-Tune-V2, a framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) at its foundation to demonstrate the potential of applying modern LLMs in data system optimization problems. ELMo-Tune-V2 leverages the contextual reasoning, cross-domain, and generative capabilities of LLMs to perform 1) self-navigated characterization and modeling of LSM-KVS workloads, 2) automatic tuning across a broad parameter space using cross-domain knowledge, and 3) real-time dynamic configuration adjustments for LSM-KVS. ELMo-Tune-V2 integrates three innovations: LLM-based workload synthesis for adaptive benchmark generation, feedback-driven iterative fine-tuning for configuration refinement, and real-time tuning to handle evolving workloads. Through detailed evaluation using RocksDB under several real-world applications across diverse scenarios, ELMo-Tune-V2 achieves performance improvements up to ~14X our YCSB benchmarks compared against default RocksDB configurations, and our end-to-end tests with upper-level applications, NebulaGraph and Kvrocks, demonstrate performance gains of 34% and 26%, respectively.

### MEDA: Dynamic KV Cache Allocation for Efficient Multimodal Long-Context   Inference
**Authors**: Zhongwei Wan, Hui Shen, Xin Wang, Che Liu, Zheda Mai, Mi Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-02-24T19:34:52Z

**Summary**: Long-context Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that incorporate long text-image and text-video modalities, demand substantial resources as their multimodal Key-Value (KV) caches grow with increasing input lengths, challenging inference efficiency. Existing methods for KV cache compression, in both text-only and multimodal LLMs, have neglected attention density variations across layers, thus often adopting uniform or progressive reduction strategies for layer-wise cache allocation. In this work, we propose MEDA, a dynamic layer-wise KV cache allocation method for efficient multimodal long-context inference. As its core, MEDA utilizes cross-modal attention entropy to determine the KV cache size at each MLLMs layer. Given the dynamically allocated KV cache size at each layer, MEDA also employs a KV pair selection scheme to identify which KV pairs to select and a KV pair merging strategy that merges the selected and non-selected ones to preserve information from the entire context. MEDA achieves up to 72% KV cache memory reduction and 2.82 times faster decoding speed, while maintaining or enhancing performance on various multimodal tasks in long-context settings, including multi-images and long-video scenarios. Our code is released at https://github.com/AIoT-MLSys-Lab/MEDA.

**Authors**: Penghui Yang, Cunxiao Du, Fengzhuo Zhang, Haonan Wang, Tianyu Pang, Chao Du, Bo An

**Updated**: 2025-02-24T18:53:31Z

**Summary**: Speculative decoding has become a promising technique to mitigate the high inference latency of autoregressive decoding in Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite its promise, the effective application of speculative decoding in LLMs still confronts three key challenges: the increasing memory demands of the draft model, the distribution shift between the short-training corpora and long-context inference, and inefficiencies in attention implementation. In this work, we enhance the performance of speculative decoding in long-context settings by addressing these challenges. First, we propose a memory-efficient draft model with a constant-sized Key-Value (KV) cache. Second, we introduce novel position indices for short-training data, enabling seamless adaptation from short-context training to long-context inference. Finally, we present an innovative attention aggregation method that combines fast implementations for prefix computation with standard attention for tree mask handling, effectively resolving the latency and memory inefficiencies of tree decoding. Our approach achieves strong results on various long-context tasks, including repository-level code completion, long-context summarization, and o1-like long reasoning tasks, demonstrating significant improvements in latency reduction.

**Summary**: This paper introduces GTX, a standalone main-memory write-optimized graph data system that specializes in structural and graph property updates while enabling concurrent reads and graph analytics through ACID transactions. Recent graph systems target concurrent read and write support while guaranteeing transaction semantics. However, their performance suffers from updates with real-world temporal locality over the same vertices and edges due to vertex-centric lock contentions. GTX has an adaptive delta-chain locking protocol on top of a carefully designed latch-free graph storage. It eliminates vertex-level locking contention, and adapts to real-life workloads while maintaining sequential access to the graph's adjacency lists storage. GTX's transactions further support cache-friendly block level concurrency control, and cooperative group commit and garbage collection. This combination of features ensures high update throughput and provides low-latency graph analytics. Based on experimental evaluation, in addition to not sacrificing the performance of read-heavy analytical workloads, and having competitive performance similar to state-of-the-art systems, GTX has high read-write transaction throughput. For write-heavy transactional workloads, GTX achieves up to 11x better transaction throughput than the best-performing state-of-the-art system.

### Evaluating IOMMU-Based Shared Virtual Addressing for RISC-V Embedded   Heterogeneous SoCs
**Authors**: Cyril Koenig, Enrico Zelioli, Luca Benini

**Updated**: 2025-02-24T18:26:22Z

**Summary**: Embedded heterogeneous systems-on-chip (SoCs) rely on domain-specific hardware accelerators to improve performance and energy efficiency. In particular, programmable multi-core accelerators feature a cluster of processing elements and tightly coupled scratchpad memories to balance performance, energy efficiency, and flexibility. In embedded systems running a general-purpose OS, accelerators access data via dedicated, physically addressed memory regions. This negatively impacts memory utilization and performance by requiring a copy from the virtual host address to the physical accelerator address space. Input-Output Memory Management Units (IOMMUs) overcome this limitation by allowing devices and hosts to use a shared virtual paged address space. However, resolving IO virtual addresses can be particularly costly on high-latency memory systems as it requires up to three sequential memory accesses on IOTLB miss. In this work, we present a quantitative evaluation of shared virtual addressing in RISC-V heterogeneous embedded systems. We integrate an IOMMU in an open-source heterogeneous RISC-V SoC consisting of a 64-bit host with a 32-bit accelerator cluster. We evaluated the system performance by emulating the design on FPGA and implementing compute kernels from the RajaPERF benchmark suite using heterogeneous OpenMP programming. We measure the transfers and computation time on the host and accelerators for systems with different DRAM access latencies. We first show that IO virtual address translation can account for 4.2% up to 17.6% of the accelerator's runtime for gemm (General Matrix Multiplication) at low and high memory bandwidth. Then, we show that in systems containing a last-level cache, this IO address translation cost falls to 0.4% and 0.7% under the same conditions, making shared virtual addressing and zero-copy offloading suitable for such RISC-V heterogeneous SoCs.

### SepLLM: Accelerate Large Language Models by Compressing One Segment into   One Separator
**Authors**: Guoxuan Chen, Han Shi, Jiawei Li, Yihang Gao, Xiaozhe Ren, Yimeng Chen, Xin Jiang, Zhenguo Li, Weiyang Liu, Chao Huang

**Updated**: 2025-02-24T15:42:59Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited exceptional performance across a spectrum of natural language processing tasks. However, their substantial sizes pose considerable challenges, particularly in computational demands and inference speed, due to their quadratic complexity. In this work, we have identified a key pattern: certain seemingly meaningless separator tokens (i.e., punctuations) contribute disproportionately to attention scores compared to semantically meaningful tokens. This observation suggests that information of the segments between these separator tokens can be effectively condensed into the separator tokens themselves without significant information loss. Guided by this insight, we introduce SepLLM, a plug-and-play framework that accelerates inference by compressing these segments and eliminating redundant tokens. Additionally, we implement efficient kernels for training acceleration. Experimental results across training-free, training-from-scratch, and post-training settings demonstrate SepLLM's effectiveness. Notably, using the Llama-3-8B backbone, SepLLM achieves over 50% reduction in KV cache on the GSM8K-CoT benchmark while maintaining comparable performance. Furthermore, in streaming settings, SepLLM effectively processes sequences of up to 4 million tokens or more while maintaining consistent language modeling capabilities.

### The Lottery LLM Hypothesis, Rethinking What Abilities Should LLM   Compression Preserve?
**Authors**: Zhenheng Tang, Xiang Liu, Qian Wang, Peijie Dong, Bingsheng He, Xiaowen Chu, Bo Li

**Updated**: 2025-02-24T15:39:35Z

**Summary**: Motivated by reducing the computational and storage costs of LLMs, model compression and KV cache compression have attracted much attention from researchers. However, current methods predominantly emphasize maintaining the performance of compressed LLMs, as measured by perplexity or simple accuracy on tasks of common sense knowledge QA and basic arithmetic reasoning. In this blog, we present a brief review of recent advancements in LLMs related to retrieval-augmented generation, multi-step reasoning, external tools, and computational expressivity, all of which substantially enhance LLM performance. Then, we propose a lottery LLM hypothesis suggesting that for a given LLM and task, there exists a smaller lottery LLM capable of producing the same performance as the original LLM with the assistance of multi-step reasoning and external tools. Based on the review of current progress in LLMs, we discuss and summarize the essential capabilities that the lottery LLM and KV cache compression must possess, which are currently overlooked in existing methods.

### Round Attention: A Novel Round-Level Attention Mechanism to Accelerate   LLM Inference
**Authors**: Yaohua Tang, Zhicheng Hu, Kun Cheng, Fan Mo, Qiheng Lv, Hua Wang, Zhi Chen

**Updated**: 2025-02-24T13:35:18Z

**Summary**: The increasing context window size in large language models (LLMs) has improved their ability to handle complex, long-text tasks. However, as the conversation rounds continue, it is required to store a large amount of KV cache in GPU memory, which significantly affects the efficiency and even availability of the model serving systems. This paper analyzes dialogue data from real users and discovers that the LLM inference manifests a watershed layer, after which the distribution of round-level attention shows notable similarity. We propose Round Attention, a novel round-level attention mechanism that only recalls and computes the KV cache of the most relevant rounds. The experiments show that our method saves 55\% memory usage without compromising model performance.

### CodeSwift: Accelerating LLM Inference for Efficient Code Generation
**Authors**: Qianhui Zhao, Li Zhang, Fang Liu, Xiaoli Lian, Qiaoyuanhe Meng, Ziqian Jiao, Zetong Zhou, Borui Zhang, Runlin Guo, Jia Li

**Updated**: 2025-02-24T13:30:30Z

**Summary**: Code generation is a latency-sensitive task that demands high timeliness, but the autoregressive decoding mechanism of Large Language Models (LLMs) leads to poor inference efficiency. Existing LLM inference acceleration methods mainly focus on standalone functions using only built-in components. Moreover, they treat code like natural language sequences, ignoring its unique syntax and semantic characteristics. As a result, the effectiveness of these approaches in code generation tasks remains limited and fails to align with real-world programming scenarios. To alleviate this issue, we propose CodeSwift, a simple yet highly efficient inference acceleration approach specifically designed for code generation, without comprising the quality of the output. CodeSwift constructs a multi-source datastore, providing access to both general and project-specific knowledge, facilitating the retrieval of high-quality draft sequences. Moreover, CodeSwift reduces retrieval cost by controlling retrieval timing, and enhances efficiency through parallel retrieval and a context- and LLM preference-aware cache. Experimental results show that CodeSwift can reach up to 2.53x and 2.54x speedup compared to autoregressive decoding in repository-level and standalone code generation tasks, respectively, outperforming state-of-the-art inference acceleration approaches by up to 88%.

### DBudgetKV: Dynamic Budget in KV Cache Compression for Ensuring Optimal   Performance
**Authors**: Xuanfan Ni, Liyan Xu, Chenyang Lyu, Longyue Wang, Mo Yu, Lemao Liu, Fandong Meng, Jie Zhou, Piji Li

**Updated**: 2025-02-24T06:33:39Z

**Summary**: To alleviate memory burden during inference of large language models (LLMs), numerous studies have focused on compressing the KV cache by exploring aspects such as attention sparsity. However, these techniques often require a pre-defined cache budget; as the optimal budget varies with different input lengths and task types, it limits their practical deployment accepting open-domain instructions. To address this limitation, we propose a new KV cache compression objective: to always ensure the full-cache performance regardless of specific inputs, while maximizing KV cache pruning as much as possible. To achieve this goal, we introduce a novel KV cache compression method dubbed DBudgetKV, which features an attention-based metric to signal when the remaining KV cache is unlikely to match the full-cache performance, then halting the pruning process. Empirical evaluation spanning diverse context lengths, task types, and model sizes suggests that our method achieves lossless KV pruning effectively and robustly, exceeding 25% compression ratio on average. Furthermore, our method is easy to integrate within LLM inference, not only optimizing memory space, but also showing reduced inference time compared to existing methods.

### KVCrush: Key value cache size-reduction using similarity in   head-behaviour
**Authors**: Gopi Krishna Jha, Sameh Gobriel, Liubov Talamanova, Alexander Kozlov, Nilesh Jain

**Updated**: 2025-02-24T02:57:51Z

**Summary**: Key-value (KV) caching has emerged as a crucial optimization technique for accelerating inference in large language models (LLMs). By allowing the attention operation to scale linearly rather than quadratically with the total sequence length, KV caching significantly enhances generation throughput. However, due to large context lengths in the modern LLMs, the memory footprint of the KV is a huge bottleneck for model deployment directly impacting the model's batch size, hindering its ability to deliver high-throughput. Existing research addresses this challenge using several techniques, such as discarding low-attention tokens, quantization, and matrix approximation which typically lead to a negative impact on the model accuracy.   In this paper, We propose KVCrush technology which can be combined with many KV compression technologies to improve the model accuracy at a much smaller memory. KVCrush provides an alternate representation scheme for key-value states, along with a low-overhead token pruning algorithm that accounts for the token distribution in the KV cache, which in turn allows for a a smaller footprint while maintaining the accuracy of the model. Based on our results, KVCrush reduces LongBench KV Cache size by 4x with less than 1% accuracy drop and achieves state-of-the-art average accuracy with minimal overhead, incurring less than 0.5% total inference latency. KVCrush not only outperforms the accuracy of state-of-the-art importance-based token retention schemes but is also compatible with typical practical LLM deployments using KV cache paging schemes such as vLLM and mixed precision quantization.

### BaKlaVa -- Budgeted Allocation of KV cache for Long-context Inference
**Authors**: Ahmed Burak Gulhan, Krishna Teja Chitty-Venkata, Murali Emani, Mahmut Kandemir, Venkatram Vishwanath

**Updated**: 2025-02-24T01:28:27Z

**Summary**: In Large Language Model (LLM) inference, Key-Value (KV) caches (KV-caches) are essential for reducing time complexity. However, they result in a linear increase in GPU memory as the context length grows. While recent work explores KV-cache eviction and compression policies to reduce memory usage, they often consider uniform KV-caches across all attention heads, leading to suboptimal performance. We introduce BaKlaVa, a method to allocate optimal memory for individual KV-caches across the model by estimating the importance of each KV-cache. Our empirical analysis demonstrates that not all KV-caches are equally critical for LLM performance. Using a one-time profiling approach, BaKlaVa assigns optimal memory budgets to each KV-cache. We evaluated our method on LLaMA-3-8B, and Qwen2.5-7B models, achieving up to a 70\% compression ratio while keeping baseline performance and delivering up to an order-of-magnitude accuracy improvement at higher compression levels.

### Don't Do RAG: When Cache-Augmented Generation is All You Need for   Knowledge Tasks
**Authors**: Brian J Chan, Chao-Ting Chen, Jui-Hung Cheng, Hen-Hsen Huang

**Updated**: 2025-02-23T19:48:12Z

**Summary**: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has gained traction as a powerful approach for enhancing language models by integrating external knowledge sources. However, RAG introduces challenges such as retrieval latency, potential errors in document selection, and increased system complexity. With the advent of large language models (LLMs) featuring significantly extended context windows, this paper proposes an alternative paradigm, cache-augmented generation (CAG) that bypasses real-time retrieval. Our method involves preloading all relevant resources, especially when the documents or knowledge for retrieval are of a limited and manageable size, into the LLM's extended context and caching its runtime parameters. During inference, the model utilizes these preloaded parameters to answer queries without additional retrieval steps. Comparative analyses reveal that CAG eliminates retrieval latency and minimizes retrieval errors while maintaining context relevance. Performance evaluations across multiple benchmarks highlight scenarios where long-context LLMs either outperform or complement traditional RAG pipelines. These findings suggest that, for certain applications, particularly those with a constrained knowledge base, CAG provide a streamlined and efficient alternative to RAG, achieving comparable or superior results with reduced complexity.

**Authors**: Xidong Mu, Zhaolin Wang, Yuanwei Liu

**Updated**: 2025-02-23T16:17:34Z

**Summary**: Simultaneously transmitting and reflecting surface (STARS) empowered multi-functional 6G wireless networks are investigated. Starting with the communication functionality, various types of STARS are introduced in terms of power amplification capabilities, reciprocity features, and spatial density of elements. Then, three STARS-empowered wireless sensing architectures are proposed, namely STARS-aided monostatic sensing, STARS-enabled bistatic sensing, and sensing with target-mounted STARS, where the representative benefits and application challenges are identified. Furthermore, promising applications of STARS for computing and caching functionalities are explored to improve the computation efficiency and reduce the content delivery latency. Finally, recent standardization progress for reconfigurable intelligent surfaces is presented for motivating the employment of STARS in multi-functional 6G.

### A New Construction Structure on Coded Caching with Linear   Subpacketization: Non-Half-Sum Disjoint Packing
**Authors**: Minquan Cheng, Huimei Wei, Kai Wan, Giuseppe Caire

**Updated**: 2025-02-23T11:52:45Z

**Summary**: Coded caching is a promising technique to effectively reduce peak traffic by using local caches and the multicast gains generated by these local caches. We prefer to design a coded caching scheme with the subpacketization $F$ and transmission load $R$ as small as possible since these are the key metrics for evaluating the implementation complexity and transmission efficiency of the scheme, respectively. However, most of the existing coded caching schemes have large subpacketizations which grow exponentially with the number of users $K$, and there are a few schemes with linear subpacketizations which have large transmission loads. In this paper, we focus on studying the linear subpacketization, i.e., $K=F$, coded caching scheme with low transmission load. Specifically, we first introduce a new combinatorial structure called non-half-sum disjoint packing (NHSDP) which can be used to generate a coded caching scheme with $K=F$. Then a class of new schemes is obtained by constructing NHSDP. Theoretical and numerical comparisons show that (i) compared to the existing schemes with linear subpacketization (to the number of users), the proposed scheme achieves a lower load; (ii) compared to some existing schemes with polynomial subpacketization, the proposed scheme can also achieve a lower load in some cases; (iii) compared to some existing schemes with exponential subpacketization, the proposed scheme has loads close to those of these schemes in some cases. Moreover, the new concept of NHSDP is closely related to the classical combinatorial structures such as cyclic difference packing (CDP), non-three-term arithmetic progressions (NTAP), and perfect hash family (PHF). These connections indicate that NHSDP is an important combinatorial structure in the field of combinatorial design.

### Cache Coherence Over Disaggregated Memory
**Authors**: Ruihong Wang, Jianguo Wang, Walid G. Aref

**Updated**: 2025-02-23T03:27:01Z

**Summary**: Disaggregating memory from compute offers the opportunity to better utilize stranded memory in cloud data centers. It is important to cache data in the compute nodes and maintain cache coherence across multiple compute nodes. However, the limited computing power on disaggregated memory servers makes traditional cache coherence protocols suboptimal, particularly in the case of stranded memory. This paper introduces SELCC; a Shared-Exclusive Latch Cache Coherence protocol that maintains cache coherence without imposing any computational burden on the remote memory side. It aligns the state machine of the shared-exclusive latch protocol with the MSI protocol , thereby ensuring both atomicity of data access and cache coherence with sequential consistency. SELCC embeds cache-ownership metadata directly into the RDMA latch word, enabling efficient cache ownership management via RDMA atomic operations. SELCC can serve as an abstraction layer over disaggregated memory with APIs that resemble main-memory accesses. A concurrent B-tree and three transaction concurrency control algorithms are realized using SELCC's abstraction layer. Experimental results show that SELCC significantly outperforms Remote-Procedure-Call-based protocols for cache coherence under limited remote computing power. Applications on SELCC achieve comparable or superior performance over disaggregated memory compared to competitors.

### PLDR-LLMs Learn A Generalizable Tensor Operator That Can Replace Its Own   Deep Neural Net At Inference
**Authors**: Burc Gokden

**Updated**: 2025-02-22T22:32:08Z

**Summary**: We show that Large Language Model from Power Law Decoder Representations (PLDR-LLM) is a foundational model whose deductive outputs are invariant tensors up to a small perturbation. PLDR-LLM learns a singularity condition for the deductive outputs that enable the once-inferred energy-curvature tensor $\mathbf{G}_{LM}$ to replace the deep neural network of power law graph attention (PLGA) generating the deductive outputs at inference. We demonstrate that a cache for $\mathbf{G}_{LM}$ (G-cache) and KV-cache can be implemented in a straightforward manner to improve the inference time. The invariance and generalizable nature of deductive outputs is at a very high fidelity where deductive outputs have same RMSE and determinant values up to 15 decimal places after caching, and zero-shot benchmark scores remain unchanged. Ablation studies show that learned deductive outputs have distinct loss and accuracy characteristics from models pretrained with transferred, randomly initialized or identity tensors as a constant tensor operator and an LLM with scaled-dot product attention (SDPA) is a special case of PLDR-LLM where $\mathbf{G}_{LM}$ is predefined as identity. The observed invariance characteristic introduces a novel asymmetry between training and inference phases with caching. We outline observed common characteristics of the deductive outputs for the learned singularity condition. We provide an implementation of a training and inference framework for PLDR-LLM with KV-cache and G-cache.

### Warp-centric GPU meta-meshing and fast triangulation of billion-scale   lattice structures
**Authors**: Qiang Zou, Yunzhu Gao

**Updated**: 2025-02-22T10:31:51Z

**Summary**: Lattice structures have been widely used in applications due to their superior mechanical properties. To fabricate such structures, a geometric processing step called triangulation is often employed to transform them into the STL format before sending them to 3D printers. Because lattice structures tend to have high geometric complexity, this step usually generates a large amount of triangles, a memory and compute-intensive task. This problem manifests itself clearly through large-scale lattice structures that have millions or billions of struts. To address this problem, this paper proposes to transform a lattice structure into an intermediate model called meta-mesh before undergoing real triangulation. Compared to triangular meshes, meta-meshes are very lightweight and much less compute-demanding. The meta-mesh can also work as a base mesh reusable for conveniently and efficiently triangulating lattice structures with arbitrary resolutions. A CPU+GPU asynchronous meta-meshing pipeline has been developed to efficiently generate meta-meshes from lattice structures. It shifts from the thread-centric GPU algorithm design paradigm commonly used in CAD to the recent warp-centric design paradigm to achieve high performance. This is achieved by a new data compression method, a GPU cache-aware data structure, and a workload-balanced scheduling method that can significantly reduce memory divergence and branch divergence. Experimenting with various billion-scale lattice structures, the proposed method is seen to be two orders of magnitude faster than previously achievable.

### KVLink: Accelerating Large Language Models via Efficient KV Cache Reuse
**Authors**: Jingbo Yang, Bairu Hou, Wei Wei, Yujia Bao, Shiyu Chang

**Updated**: 2025-02-21T23:34:29Z

**Summary**: We describe KVLink, an approach for efficient key-value (KV) cache reuse in large language models (LLMs). In many LLM applications, different inputs can share overlapping context, such as the same retrieved document appearing in multiple queries. However, the LLMs still need to encode the entire context for each query, leading to redundant computation. In this paper, we propose a new strategy to eliminate such inefficiency, where the KV cache of each document is precomputed independently. During inference, the KV caches of retrieved documents are concatenated, allowing the model to reuse cached representations instead of recomputing them. To mitigate the performance degradation of LLMs when using KV caches computed independently for each document, KVLink introduces three key components: adjusting positional embeddings of the KV cache at inference to match the global position after concatenation, using trainable special tokens to restore self-attention across independently encoded documents, and applying mixed-data fine-tuning to enhance performance while preserving the model's original capabilities. Experiments across 7 datasets demonstrate that KVLink improves question answering accuracy by an average of 4% over state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, by leveraging precomputed KV caches, our approach reduces time-to-first-token by up to 90% compared to standard LLM inference, making it a scalable and efficient solution for context reuse.

### Compression Barriers for Autoregressive Transformers
**Authors**: Themistoklis Haris, Krzysztof Onak

**Updated**: 2025-02-21T21:37:52Z

**Summary**: A key limitation of autoregressive Transformers is the large memory needed at inference-time to cache all previous key-value (KV) embeddings. Prior works address this by compressing the KV cache, but often assume specific structural properties of the embeddings. This raises the following natural question: Can truly sublinear space utilization be achieved without such assumptions? In this work, we answer this question in the negative. Any algorithm for attention-based token generation must use $\Theta(nd)$ space, where $n$ is the number of tokens generated so far and $d = \Omega(\log n)$ is the dimension of the KV embeddings. Our proof involves a reduction from a classic communication complexity problem and uses a randomized construction that leverages properties of projections in the spirit of the Johnson-Linderstrauss lemma. For the low-dimensional regime $d = o(\log n)$, we show that any algorithm requires $\Omega(d\cdot e^d)$ space and prove, using tight bounds on covering numbers, that SubGen, proposed by Zandieh, Han, Mirrokni and Karbasi, matches this bound. Further, we investigate how sparsity assumptions enable token generation in truly sublinear space, presenting impossibility results and proposing a new KV cache compression algorithm for sliding window attention when the value cache outside the window is unmasked. Finally, we analyze token generation's time complexity, using an indistinguishability argument to prove that no non-adaptive algorithm can compute attention online in sublinear time for all tokens.

### U-index: A Universal Indexing Framework for Matching Long Patterns
**Authors**: Lorraine A. K. Ayad, Gabriele Fici, Ragnar Groot Koerkamp, Grigorios Loukides, Rob Patro, Giulio Ermanno Pibiri, Solon P. Pissis

**Updated**: 2025-02-21T13:35:43Z

**Summary**: Text indexing is a fundamental and well-studied problem. Classic solutions either replace the original text with a compressed representation, e.g., the FM-index and its variants, or keep it uncompressed but attach some redundancy - an index - to accelerate matching. The former solutions thus retain excellent compressed space, but areslow in practice. The latter approaches, like the suffix array, instead sacrifice space for speed.   We show that efficient text indexing can be achieved using just a small extra space on top of the original text, provided that the query patterns are sufficiently long. More specifically, we develop a new indexing paradigm in which a sketch of a query pattern is first matched against a sketch of the text. Once candidate matches are retrieved, they are verified using the original text. This paradigm is thus universal in the sense that it allows us to use any solution to index the sketched text, like a suffix array, FM-index, or r-index.   We explore both the theory and the practice of this universal framework. With an extensive experimental analysis, we show that, surprisingly, universal indexes can be constructed much faster than their unsketched counterparts and take a fraction of the space, as a direct consequence of (i) having a lower bound on the length of patterns and (ii) working in sketch space. Furthermore, these data structures have the potential of retaining or even improving query time, because matching against the sketched text is faster and verifying candidates can be theoretically done in constant time per occurrence (or, in practice, by short and cache-friendly scans of the text). Finally, we discuss some important applications of this novel indexing paradigm to computational biology. We hypothesize that such indexes will be particularly effective when the queries are sufficiently long, and so demonstrate applications in long-read mapping.

### CoKV: Optimizing KV Cache Allocation via Cooperative Game
**Authors**: Qiheng Sun, Hongwei Zhang, Haocheng Xia, Jiayao Zhang, Jinfei Liu, Kui Ren

**Updated**: 2025-02-21T12:03:07Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success on various aspects of human life. However, one of the major challenges in deploying these models is the substantial memory consumption required to store key-value pairs (KV), which imposes significant resource demands. Recent research has focused on KV cache budget allocation, with several approaches proposing head-level budget distribution by evaluating the importance of individual attention heads. These methods, however, assess the importance of heads independently, overlooking their cooperative contributions within the model, which may result in a deviation from their true impact on model performance. In light of this limitation, we propose CoKV, a novel method that models the cooperation between heads in model inference as a cooperative game. By evaluating the contribution of each head within the cooperative game, CoKV can allocate the cache budget more effectively. Extensive experiments show that CoKV achieves state-of-the-art performance on the LongBench benchmark using LLama-3-8B-Instruct and Mistral-7B models.

### SVDq: 1.25-bit and 410x Key Cache Compression for LLM Attention
**Authors**: Hong Yankun, Li Xing, Zhen Hui-Ling, Yu Xianzhi, Liu Wulong, Yuan Mingxuan

**Updated**: 2025-02-21T08:55:21Z

**Summary**: For the efficient inference of Large Language Models (LLMs), the effective compression of key-value (KV) cache is essential. Three main types of KV cache compression techniques, namely sparsity, channel compression, and quantization, have been identified. This study presents SVDq, a Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) - based mixed precision quantization method for K cache. Initially, K cache is transformed into latent channels using SVD basis representations. Since the values in latent channels decay rapidly and become negligible after only a few latent channels, our method then incorporates importance-aware quantization and compression for latent channels. This enables the effective allocation of higher precision to more significant channels. Theoretically, we prove that SVDq results in quantization errors (x0.1 or even lower) that are much lower than those of per-channel key quantization in the original space. Our findings based on RULER and LongBench benchmarks demonstrate that SVDq can achieve an equivalent key cache precision as low as 1.25-bit. When combined with key sparsity, it can reach a key compression ratio of up to 410x for attention computation, all while maintaining comparable model performance. Notably, our method is nearly lossless for LongBench datasets. This indicates that SVDq enables high-precision low-bit quantization, providing a more efficient solution for KV cache compression in LLMs.

### SAAP: Spatial awareness and Association based Prefetching of Virtual   Objects in Augmented Reality at the Edge
**Authors**: Nikhil Sreekumar, Abhishek Chandra, Jon Weissman

**Updated**: 2025-02-21T04:07:00Z

**Summary**: Mobile Augmented Reality (MAR) applications face performance challenges due to their high computational demands and need for low-latency responses. Traditional approaches like on-device storage or reactive data fetching from the cloud often result in limited AR experiences or unacceptable lag. Edge caching, which caches AR objects closer to the user, provides a promising solution. However, existing edge caching approaches do not consider AR-specific features such as AR object sizes, user interactions, and physical location. This paper investigates how to further optimize edge caching by employing AR-aware prefetching techniques. We present SAAP, a Spatial Awareness and Association-based Prefetching policy specifically designed for MAR Caches. SAAP intelligently prioritizes the caching of virtual objects based on their association with other similar objects and the user's proximity to them. It also considers the recency of associations and uses a lazy fetching strategy to efficiently manage edge resources and maximize Quality of Experience (QoE).   Through extensive evaluation using both synthetic and real-world workloads, we demonstrate that SAAP significantly improves cache hit rates compared to standard caching algorithms, achieving gains ranging from 3\% to 40\% while reducing the need for on-demand data retrieval from the cloud. Further, we present an adaptive tuning algorithm that automatically tunes SAAP parameters to achieve optimal performance. Our findings demonstrate the potential of SAAP to substantially enhance the user experience in MAR applications by ensuring the timely availability of virtual objects.

### Compute Or Load KV Cache? Why Not Both?
**Authors**: Shuowei Jin, Xueshen Liu, Qingzhao Zhang, Z. Morley Mao

**Updated**: 2025-02-20T23:28:01Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in large-scale online services, enabling sophisticated applications. However, the computational overhead of generating key-value (KV) caches in the prefill stage presents a major bottleneck, particularly for long-context inputs. Prefix caching mitigates this issue by storing KV caches for reuse, reducing redundant computation. Despite its advantages, prefix caching suffers from high latency due to the limited I/O bandwidth of storage devices, constraining inference efficiency. To address this challenge, we introduce Cake, a novel KV cache loading system that optimally utilizes both computational and I/O resources in parallel. Cake employs a bidirectional scheduling strategy that dynamically balances KV cache computation and loading, ensuring efficient resource utilization. Additionally, Cake incorporates an adaptive scheduling mechanism that seamlessly integrates with non-prefix caching requests, improving system throughput and adapting to fluctuating resource availabilty. Through extensive evaluations across various hardware configurations, datasets, and storage conditions, Cake achieves on average 2.6x reduction in Time to First Token (TTFT) compared to compute-only and I/O-only methods. Our findings highlight Cake as an effective and practical solution for optimizing long-context LLM inference, bridging the gap between computation and I/O efficiency in large-scale AI deployments.

### More for Keys, Less for Values: Adaptive KV Cache Quantization
**Authors**: Mohsen Hariri, Lam Nguyen, Sixu Chen, Shaochen Zhong, Qifan Wang, Xia Hu, Xiaotian Han, Vipin Chaudhary

**Updated**: 2025-02-20T22:24:27Z

**Summary**: This paper introduces an information-aware quantization framework that adaptively compresses the key-value (KV) cache in large language models (LLMs). Although prior work has underscored the distinct roles of key and value cache during inference, our systematic analysis -- examining singular value distributions, spectral norms, and Frobenius norms -- reveals, for the first time, that key matrices consistently exhibit higher norm values and are more sensitive to quantization than value matrices. Furthermore, our theoretical analysis shows that matrices with higher spectral norms amplify quantization errors more significantly. Motivated by these insights, we propose a mixed-precision quantization strategy, KV-AdaQuant, which allocates more bit-width for keys and fewer for values since key matrices have higher norm values. With the same total KV bit budget, this approach effectively mitigates error propagation across transformer layers while achieving significant memory savings. Our extensive experiments on multiple LLMs (1B--70B) demonstrate that our mixed-precision quantization scheme maintains high model accuracy even under aggressive compression. For instance, using 4-bit for Key and 2-bit for Value achieves an accuracy of 75.2%, whereas reversing the assignment (2-bit for Key and 4-bit for Value) yields only 54.7% accuracy.

### LServe: Efficient Long-sequence LLM Serving with Unified Sparse   Attention
**Authors**: Shang Yang, Junxian Guo, Haotian Tang, Qinghao Hu, Guangxuan Xiao, Jiaming Tang, Yujun Lin, Zhijian Liu, Yao Lu, Song Han

**Updated**: 2025-02-20T18:59:52Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable potential in processing long sequences, yet efficiently serving these long-context models remains challenging due to the quadratic computational complexity of attention in the prefilling stage and the large memory footprint of the KV cache in the decoding stage. To address these issues, we introduce LServe, an efficient system that accelerates long-sequence LLM serving via hybrid sparse attention. This method unifies different hardware-friendly, structured sparsity patterns for both prefilling and decoding attention into a single framework, where computations on less important tokens are skipped block-wise. LServe demonstrates the compatibility of static and dynamic sparsity in long-context LLM attention. This design enables multiplicative speedups by combining these optimizations. Specifically, we convert half of the attention heads to nearly free streaming heads in both the prefilling and decoding stages. Additionally, we find that only a constant number of KV pages is required to preserve long-context capabilities, irrespective of context length. We then design a hierarchical KV page selection policy that dynamically prunes KV pages based on query-centric similarity. On average, LServe accelerates LLM prefilling by up to 2.9x and decoding by 1.3-2.1x over vLLM, maintaining long-context accuracy. Code is released at https://github.com/mit-han-lab/omniserve.

### Towards Economical Inference: Enabling DeepSeek's Multi-Head Latent   Attention in Any Transformer-based LLMs
**Authors**: Tao Ji, Bin Guo, Yuanbin Wu, Qipeng Guo, Lixing Shen, Zhan Chen, Xipeng Qiu, Qi Zhang, Tao Gui

**Updated**: 2025-02-20T18:50:42Z

**Summary**: Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) is an innovative architecture proposed by DeepSeek, designed to ensure efficient and economical inference by significantly compressing the Key-Value (KV) cache into a latent vector. Compared to MLA, standard LLMs employing Multi-Head Attention (MHA) and its variants such as Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) exhibit significant cost disadvantages. Enabling well-trained LLMs (e.g., Llama) to rapidly adapt to MLA without pre-training from scratch is both meaningful and challenging. This paper proposes the first data-efficient fine-tuning method for transitioning from MHA to MLA (MHA2MLA), which includes two key components: for partial-RoPE, we remove RoPE from dimensions of queries and keys that contribute less to the attention scores, for low-rank approximation, we introduce joint SVD approximations based on the pre-trained parameters of keys and values. These carefully designed strategies enable MHA2MLA to recover performance using only a small fraction (0.3% to 0.6%) of the data, significantly reducing inference costs while seamlessly integrating with compression techniques such as KV cache quantization. For example, the KV cache size of Llama2-7B is reduced by 92.19%, with only a 0.5% drop in LongBench performance.

**Authors**: Miao Tao, Yuanzhen Zhou, Haoran Xu, Zeyu He, Zhenyu Yang, Yuchang Zhang, Zhongling Su, Linning Xu, Zhenxiang Ma, Rong Fu, Hengjie Li, Xingcheng Zhang, Jidong Zhai

**Updated**: 2025-02-20T14:01:17Z

**Summary**: Rendering large-scale 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model faces significant challenges in achieving real-time, high-fidelity performance on consumer-grade devices. Fully realizing the potential of 3DGS in applications such as virtual reality (VR) requires addressing critical system-level challenges to support real-time, immersive experiences. We propose GS-Cache, an end-to-end framework that seamlessly integrates 3DGS's advanced representation with a highly optimized rendering system. GS-Cache introduces a cache-centric pipeline to eliminate redundant computations, an efficiency-aware scheduler for elastic multi-GPU rendering, and optimized CUDA kernels to overcome computational bottlenecks. This synergy between 3DGS and system design enables GS-Cache to achieve up to 5.35x performance improvement, 35% latency reduction, and 42% lower GPU memory usage, supporting 2K binocular rendering at over 120 FPS with high visual quality. By bridging the gap between 3DGS's representation power and the demands of VR systems, GS-Cache establishes a scalable and efficient framework for real-time neural rendering in immersive environments.

### PLPHP: Per-Layer Per-Head Vision Token Pruning for Efficient Large   Vision-Language Models
**Authors**: Yu Meng, Kaiyuan Li, Chenran Huang, Chen Gao, Xinlei Chen, Yong Li, Xiaoping Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-02-20T12:31:31Z

**Summary**: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a range of multimodal tasks. However, their inference efficiency is constrained by the large number of visual tokens processed during decoding. To address this challenge, we propose Per-Layer Per-Head Vision Token Pruning (PLPHP), a two-level fine-grained pruning method including Layer-Level Retention Rate Allocation and Head-Level Vision Token Pruning. Motivated by the Vision Token Re-attention phenomenon across decoder layers, we dynamically adjust token retention rates layer by layer. Layers that exhibit stronger attention to visual information preserve more vision tokens, while layers with lower vision attention are aggressively pruned. Furthermore, PLPHP applies pruning at the attention head level, enabling different heads within the same layer to independently retain critical context. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that PLPHP delivers an 18% faster decoding speed and reduces the Key-Value Cache (KV Cache) size by over 50%, all at the cost of 0.46% average performance drop, while also achieving notable performance improvements in multi-image tasks. These results highlight the effectiveness of fine-grained token pruning and contribute to advancing the efficiency and scalability of LVLMs. Our source code will be made publicly available.

### More Tokens, Lower Precision: Towards the Optimal Token-Precision   Trade-off in KV Cache Compression
**Authors**: Jiebin Zhang, Dawei Zhu, Yifan Song, Wenhao Wu, Chuqiao Kuang, Xiaoguang Li, Lifeng Shang, Qun Liu, Sujian Li

**Updated**: 2025-02-20T12:14:49Z

**Summary**: As large language models (LLMs) process increasing context windows, the memory usage of KV cache has become a critical bottleneck during inference. The mainstream KV compression methods, including KV pruning and KV quantization, primarily focus on either token or precision dimension separately. However, these works leaving the trade-off between these two orthogonal dimensions largely under-explored. In this paper, we comprehensively investigate the token-precision trade-off in KV cache compression.Experiments demonstrate that storing more tokens in the KV cache with lower precision,a strategy we term quantized pruning, can significantly enhance the long-context performance of LLMs. In-depth analysis of the token-precision trade-off across key aspects demonstrates that, quantized pruning achieves substantial improvements in retrieval-related tasks and consistently performs well across varying input lengths. Furthermore, quantized pruning demonstrates notable stability and effectiveness across different KV pruning methods, quantization strategies, and model scales. These findings offer valuable insights into optimizing KV cache compression through balanced token-precision trade-off strategies. Our code is available at https://github.com/zhzihao/QPruningKV.

### Neural Attention Search
**Authors**: Difan Deng, Marius Lindauer

**Updated**: 2025-02-20T09:03:05Z

**Summary**: We present Neural Attention Search (NAtS), a framework that automatically evaluates the importance of each token within a sequence and determines if the corresponding token can be dropped after several steps. This approach can efficiently reduce the KV cache sizes required by transformer-based models during inference and thus reduce inference costs. In this paper, we design a search space that contains three token types: (i) Global Tokens will be preserved and queried by all the following tokens. (ii) Local Tokens survive until the next global token appears. (iii) Sliding Window Tokens have an impact on the inference of a fixed size of the next following tokens. Similar to the One-Shot Neural Architecture Search approach, this token-type information can be learned jointly with the architecture weights via a learnable attention mask. Experiments on both training a new transformer from scratch and fine-tuning existing large language models show that NAtS can efficiently reduce the KV cache size required for the models while maintaining the models' performance.

**Updated**: 2025-02-20T08:00:25Z

**Summary**: We report results of magnetotransport measurements on KV$_3$Sb$_5$ thin flakes under pressure. Our zero-field electrical resistance reveals an additional anomaly emerging under pressure ($p$), marking a previously unidentified phase boundary $T^{\rm \ast}$($p$). Together with the established $T_{\rm CDW}(p)$ and $T_c(p)$, denoting the charge-density-wave transition and a superconducting transition, respectively, the temperature-pressure phase diagram of KV$_3$Sb$_5$ features a rich interplay among multiple phases. The Hall coefficient evolves reasonably smoothly when crossing the $T^{\rm \ast}$ phase boundary compared with the variation when crossing $T_{\rm CDW}$, indicating the preservation of the pristine electronic structure. The mobility spectrum analysis provides further insights into distinguishing different phases. Finally, our high-pressure quantum oscillation studies up to 31 T combined with density functional theory calculations further demonstrate that the new phase does not reconstruct the Fermi surface, confirming that the translational symmetry of the pristine metallic state is preserved.

### ParallelComp: Parallel Long-Context Compressor for Length Extrapolation
**Authors**: Jing Xiong, Jianghan Shen, Chuanyang Zheng, Zhongwei Wan, Chenyang Zhao, Chiwun Yang, Fanghua Ye, Hongxia Yang, Lingpeng Kong, Ngai Wong

**Updated**: 2025-02-20T07:10:43Z

**Summary**: Efficiently handling long contexts is crucial for large language models (LLMs). While rotary position embeddings (RoPEs) enhance length generalization, effective length extrapolation remains challenging and often requires costly fine-tuning. In contrast, recent training-free approaches suffer from the attention sink phenomenon, leading to severe performance degradation. In this paper, we introduce ParallelComp, a novel training-free method for long-context extrapolation that extends LLMs' context length from 4K to 128K while maintaining high throughput and preserving perplexity, and integrates seamlessly with Flash Attention. Our analysis offers new insights into attention biases in parallel attention mechanisms and provides practical solutions to tackle these challenges. To mitigate the attention sink issue, we propose an attention calibration strategy that reduces biases, ensuring more stable long-range attention. Additionally, we introduce a chunk eviction strategy to efficiently manage ultra-long contexts on a single A100 80GB GPU. To further enhance efficiency, we propose a parallel KV cache eviction technique, which improves chunk throughput by 1.76x, thereby achieving a 23.50x acceleration in the prefilling stage with negligible performance loss due to attention calibration. Furthermore, ParallelComp achieves 91.17% of GPT-4's performance on long-context tasks using an 8B model trained on 8K-length context, outperforming powerful closed-source models such as Claude-2 and Kimi-Chat.

### μRL: Discovering Transient Execution Vulnerabilities Using   Reinforcement Learning
**Authors**: M. Caner Tol, Kemal Derya, Berk Sunar

**Updated**: 2025-02-20T06:42:03Z

**Summary**: We propose using reinforcement learning to address the challenges of discovering microarchitectural vulnerabilities, such as Spectre and Meltdown, which exploit subtle interactions in modern processors. Traditional methods like random fuzzing fail to efficiently explore the vast instruction space and often miss vulnerabilities that manifest under specific conditions. To overcome this, we introduce an intelligent, feedback-driven approach using RL. Our RL agents interact with the processor, learning from real-time feedback to prioritize instruction sequences more likely to reveal vulnerabilities, significantly improving the efficiency of the discovery process.   We also demonstrate that RL systems adapt effectively to various microarchitectures, providing a scalable solution across processor generations. By automating the exploration process, we reduce the need for human intervention, enabling continuous learning that uncovers hidden vulnerabilities. Additionally, our approach detects subtle signals, such as timing anomalies or unusual cache behavior, that may indicate microarchitectural weaknesses. This proposal advances hardware security testing by introducing a more efficient, adaptive, and systematic framework for protecting modern processors.   When unleashed on Intel Skylake-X and Raptor Lake microarchitectures, our RL agent was indeed able to generate instruction sequences that cause significant observable byte leakages through transient execution without generating any $\mu$code assists, faults or interrupts. The newly identified leaky sequences stem from a variety of Intel instructions, e.g. including SERIALIZE, VERR/VERW, CLMUL, MMX-x87 transitions, LSL+RDSCP and LAR. These initial results give credence to the proposed approach.

### SpinQuant: LLM quantization with learned rotations
**Authors**: Zechun Liu, Changsheng Zhao, Igor Fedorov, Bilge Soran, Dhruv Choudhary, Raghuraman Krishnamoorthi, Vikas Chandra, Yuandong Tian, Tijmen Blankevoort

**Updated**: 2025-02-20T06:07:00Z

**Summary**: Post-training quantization (PTQ) techniques applied to weights, activations, and the KV cache greatly reduce memory usage, latency, and power consumption of Large Language Models (LLMs), but may lead to large quantization errors when outliers are present. Rotating activation or weight matrices helps remove outliers and benefits quantization. In this work, we identify a collection of applicable rotation parameterizations that lead to identical outputs in full-precision Transformer architectures while enhancing quantization accuracy. In addition, we find that some random rotations lead to much better quantization than others, with an up to 13 points difference in downstream zero-shot reasoning performance. As a result, we propose SpinQuant, a novel approach that incorporates learned rotation matrices for optimal quantized network accuracy. With 4-bit quantization of weight, activation, and KV-cache, SpinQuant narrows the accuracy gap on zero-shot reasoning tasks with full precision to merely 2.9 points on the LLaMA-2 7B model, surpassing LLM-QAT by 19.1 points and SmoothQuant by 25.0 points. Furthermore, SpinQuant also outperforms concurrent work QuaRot, which applies random rotations to remove outliers. In particular, for LLaMA-3 8B models that are hard to quantize, SpinQuant reduces the gap to full precision by up to 45.1% relative to QuaRot. Code is available at https://github.com/facebookresearch/SpinQuant.

**Authors**: Subhajit Chaudhury, Payel Das, Sarathkrishna Swaminathan, Georgios Kollias, Elliot Nelson, Khushbu Pahwa, Tejaswini Pedapati, Igor Melnyk, Matthew Riemer

**Updated**: 2025-02-20T05:41:15Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have yielded impressive successes on many language tasks. However, efficient processing of long contexts using LLMs remains a significant challenge. We introduce \textbf{EpMAN} -- a method for processing long contexts in an \textit{episodic memory} module while \textit{holistically attending to} semantically relevant context chunks. The output of \textit{episodic attention} is then used to reweigh the decoder's self-attention to the stored KV cache of the context during training and generation. When an LLM decoder is trained using \textbf{EpMAN}, its performance on multiple challenging single-hop long-context recall and question-answering benchmarks is found to be stronger and more robust across the range from 16k to 256k tokens than baseline decoders trained with self-attention, and popular retrieval-augmented generation frameworks.

### NDPage: Efficient Address Translation for Near-Data Processing   Architectures via Tailored Page Table
**Authors**: Qingcai Jiang, Buxin Tu, Hong An

**Updated**: 2025-02-20T03:27:00Z

**Summary**: Near-Data Processing (NDP) has been a promising architectural paradigm to address the memory wall problem for data-intensive applications. Practical implementation of NDP architectures calls for system support for better programmability, where having virtual memory (VM) is critical. Modern computing systems incorporate a 4-level page table design to support address translation in VM. However, simply adopting an existing 4-level page table in NDP systems causes significant address translation overhead because (1) NDP applications generate a lot of address translations, and (2) the limited L1 cache in NDP systems cannot cover the accesses to page table entries (PTEs). We extensively analyze the 4-level page table design in the NDP scenario and observe that (1) the memory access to page table entries is highly irregular, thus cannot benefit from the L1 cache, and (2) the last two levels of page tables are nearly fully occupied. Based on our observations, we propose NDPage, an efficient page table design tailored for NDP systems. The key mechanisms of NDPage are (1) an L1 cache bypass mechanism for PTEs that not only accelerates the memory accesses of PTEs but also prevents the pollution of PTEs in the cache system, and (2) a flattened page table design that merges the last two levels of page tables, allowing the page table to enjoy the flexibility of a 4KB page while reducing the number of PTE accesses. We evaluate NDPage using a variety of data-intensive workloads. Our evaluation shows that in a single-core NDP system, NDPage improves the end-to-end performance over the state-of-the-art address translation mechanism of 14.3\%; in 4-core and 8-core NDP systems, NDPage enhances the performance of 9.8\% and 30.5\%, respectively.

### RocketKV: Accelerating Long-Context LLM Inference via Two-Stage KV Cache   Compression
**Authors**: Payman Behnam, Yaosheng Fu, Ritchie Zhao, Po-An Tsai, Zhiding Yu, Alexey Tumanov

**Updated**: 2025-02-19T19:12:46Z

**Summary**: Transformer-based Large Language Models rely critically on KV cache to efficiently handle extended contexts during the decode phase. Yet, the size of the KV cache grows proportionally with the input length, burdening both memory bandwidth and capacity as decoding progresses. To address this challenge, we present RocketKV, a training-free KV cache compression strategy designed specifically to reduce both memory bandwidth and capacity demand of KV cache during the decode phase. RocketKV contains two consecutive stages. In the first stage, it performs coarse-grain KV cache eviction on the input sequence tokens with SnapKV++, a method improved upon SnapKV by introducing adaptive pooling size and full compatibility with grouped-query attention. In the second stage, it adopts a hybrid attention method to conduct fine-grain top-k sparse attention, approximating the attention scores by leveraging both head and sequence dimensional reductions. Combining these two stages, RocketKV achieves significant KV cache fetching bandwidth and storage savings while maintaining comparable accuracy to full KV cache attention. We show that RocketKV provides end-to-end speedup by up to 3$\times$ as well as peak memory reduction by up to 31% in the decode phase on an NVIDIA H100 GPU compared to the full KV cache baseline, while achieving negligible accuracy loss on a variety of long-context tasks.

### Value Residual Learning
**Authors**: Zhanchao Zhou, Tianyi Wu, Zhiyun Jiang, Fares Obeid, Zhenzhong Lan

**Updated**: 2025-02-19T17:53:11Z

**Summary**: While Transformer models have achieved remarkable success in various domains, the effectiveness of information propagation through deep networks remains a critical challenge. Standard hidden state residuals often fail to adequately preserve initial token-level information in deeper layers. This paper introduces ResFormer, a novel architecture that enhances information flow by incorporating value residual connections in addition to hidden state residuals. And a variant is the SVFormer, where all layers share the first layer's value embedding. Comprehensive empirical evidence demonstrates ResFormer achieves equivalent validation loss with 13.3\% fewer model parameters and 15.4\% less training data compared to Transformer, while maintaining similar memory usage and computational cost. Besides, SVFormer reduces KV cache size by nearly half with only a small performance penalty and can be integrated with other KV-efficient methods, yielding further reductions in KV cache, with performance influenced by sequence length and cumulative learning rate.

### NVR: Vector Runahead on NPUs for Sparse Memory Access
**Authors**: Hui Wang, Zhengpeng Zhao, Jing Wang, Yushu Du, Yuan Cheng, Bing Guo, He Xiao, Chenhao Ma, Xiaomeng Han, Dean You, Jiapeng Guan, Ran Wei, Dawei Yang, Zhe Jiang

**Updated**: 2025-02-19T16:54:58Z

**Summary**: Deep Neural Networks are increasingly leveraging sparsity to reduce the scaling up of model parameter size. However, reducing wall-clock time through sparsity and pruning remains challenging due to irregular memory access patterns, leading to frequent cache misses. In this paper, we present NPU Vector Runahead (NVR), a prefetching mechanism tailored for NPUs to address cache miss problems in sparse DNN workloads. Rather than optimising memory patterns with high overhead and poor portability, NVR adapts runahead execution to the unique architecture of NPUs. NVR provides a general micro-architectural solution for sparse DNN workloads without requiring compiler or algorithmic support, operating as a decoupled, speculative, lightweight hardware sub-thread alongside the NPU, with minimal hardware overhead (under 5%). NVR achieves an average 90% reduction in cache misses compared to SOTA prefetching in general-purpose processors, delivering 4x average speedup on sparse workloads versus NPUs without prefetching. Moreover, we investigate the advantages of incorporating a small cache (16KB) into the NPU combined with NVR. Our evaluation shows that expanding this modest cache delivers 5x higher performance benefits than increasing the L2 cache size by the same amount.

### The Impact of Inference Acceleration on Bias of LLMs
**Authors**: Elisabeth Kirsten, Ivan Habernal, Vedant Nanda, Muhammad Bilal Zafar

**Updated**: 2025-02-19T11:10:09Z

**Summary**: Last few years have seen unprecedented advances in capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). These advancements promise to benefit a vast array of application domains. However, due to their immense size, performing inference with LLMs is both costly and slow. Consequently, a plethora of recent work has proposed strategies to enhance inference efficiency, e.g., quantization, pruning, and caching. These acceleration strategies reduce the inference cost and latency, often by several factors, while maintaining much of the predictive performance measured via common benchmarks. In this work, we explore another critical aspect of LLM performance: demographic bias in model generations due to inference acceleration optimizations. Using a wide range of metrics, we probe bias in model outputs from a number of angles. Analysis of outputs before and after inference acceleration shows significant change in bias. Worryingly, these bias effects are complex and unpredictable. A combination of an acceleration strategy and bias type may show little bias change in one model but may lead to a large effect in another. Our results highlight a need for in-depth and case-by-case evaluation of model bias after it has been modified to accelerate inference.

**Summary**: Diffusion transformers have shown significant effectiveness in both image and video synthesis at the expense of huge computation costs. To address this problem, feature caching methods have been introduced to accelerate diffusion transformers by caching the features in previous timesteps and reusing them in the following timesteps. However, previous caching methods ignore that different tokens exhibit different sensitivities to feature caching, and feature caching on some tokens may lead to 10$\times$ more destruction to the overall generation quality compared with other tokens. In this paper, we introduce token-wise feature caching, allowing us to adaptively select the most suitable tokens for caching, and further enable us to apply different caching ratios to neural layers in different types and depths. Extensive experiments on PixArt-$\alpha$, OpenSora, and DiT demonstrate our effectiveness in both image and video generation with no requirements for training. For instance, 2.36$\times$ and 1.93$\times$ acceleration are achieved on OpenSora and PixArt-$\alpha$ with almost no drop in generation quality.

### ETS: Efficient Tree Search for Inference-Time Scaling
**Authors**: Coleman Hooper, Sehoon Kim, Suhong Moon, Kerem Dilmen, Monishwaran Maheswaran, Nicholas Lee, Michael W. Mahoney, Sophia Shao, Kurt Keutzer, Amir Gholami

**Summary**: Test-time compute scaling has emerged as a new axis along which to improve model accuracy, where additional computation is used at inference time to allow the model to think longer for more challenging problems. One promising approach for test-time compute scaling is search against a process reward model, where a model generates multiple potential candidates at each step of the search, and these partial trajectories are then scored by a separate reward model in order to guide the search process. The diversity of trajectories in the tree search process affects the accuracy of the search, since increasing diversity promotes more exploration. However, this diversity comes at a cost, as divergent trajectories have less KV sharing, which means they consume more memory and slow down the search process. Previous search methods either do not perform sufficient exploration, or else explore diverse trajectories but have high latency. We address this challenge by proposing Efficient Tree Search (ETS), which promotes KV sharing by pruning redundant trajectories while maintaining necessary diverse trajectories. ETS incorporates a linear programming cost model to promote KV cache sharing by penalizing the number of nodes retained, while incorporating a semantic coverage term into the cost model to ensure that we retain trajectories which are semantically different. We demonstrate how ETS can achieve 1.8$\times$ reduction in average KV cache size during the search process, leading to 1.4$\times$ increased throughput relative to prior state-of-the-art methods, with minimal accuracy degradation and without requiring any custom kernel implementation.

### Activation-aware Probe-Query: Effective Key-Value Retrieval for   Long-Context LLMs Inference
**Authors**: Qingfa Xiao, Jiachuan Wang, Haoyang Li, Cheng Deng, Jiaqi Tang, Shuangyin Li, Yongqi Zhang, Jun Wang, Lei Chen

**Updated**: 2025-02-19T08:50:44Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have showcased exceptional performance in long-context tasks, while facing significant inference efficiency challenges with limited GPU memory. Existing solutions first proposed the sliding-window approach to accumulate a set of historical \textbf{key-value} (KV) pairs for reuse, then further improvements selectively retain its subsets at each step. However, due to the sparse attention distribution across a long context, it is hard to identify and recall relevant KV pairs, as the attention is distracted by massive candidate pairs. Additionally, we found it promising to select representative tokens as probe-Query in each sliding window to effectively represent the entire context, which is an approach overlooked by existing methods. Thus, we propose \textbf{ActQKV}, a training-free, \textbf{Act}ivation-aware approach that dynamically determines probe-\textbf{Q}uery and leverages it to retrieve the relevant \textbf{KV} pairs for inference. Specifically, ActQKV monitors a token-level indicator, Activation Bias, within each context window, enabling the proper construction of probe-Query for retrieval at pre-filling stage. To accurately recall the relevant KV pairs and minimize the irrelevant ones, we design a dynamic KV cut-off mechanism guided by information density across layers at the decoding stage. Experiments on the Long-Bench and $\infty$ Benchmarks demonstrate its state-of-the-art performance with competitive inference quality and resource efficiency.

### FairKV: Balancing Per-Head KV Cache for Fast Multi-GPU Inference
**Authors**: Bingzhe Zhao, Ke Cheng, Aomufei Yuan, Yuxuan Tian, Ruiguang Zhong, Chengchen Hu, Tong Yang, Lian Yu

**Updated**: 2025-02-19T06:14:27Z

**Summary**: KV cache techniques in Transformer models aim to reduce redundant computations at the expense of substantially increased memory usage, making KV cache compression an important and popular research topic. Recently, state-of-the-art KV cache compression methods implement imbalanced, per-head allocation algorithms that dynamically adjust the KV cache budget for each attention head, achieving excellent performance in single-GPU scenarios. However, we observe that such imbalanced compression leads to significant load imbalance when deploying multi-GPU inference, as some GPUs become overburdened while others remain underutilized. In this paper, we propose FairKV, a method designed to ensure fair memory usage among attention heads in systems employing imbalanced KV cache compression. The core technique of FairKV is Fair-Copying, which replicates a small subset of memory-intensive attention heads across GPUs using data parallelism to mitigate load imbalance. Our experiments on popular models, including LLaMA 70b and Mistral 24b model, demonstrate that FairKV increases throughput by 1.66x compared to standard tensor parallelism inference. Our code will be released as open source upon acceptance.

 ### GEN3C: 3D-Informed World-Consistent Video Generation with Precise Camera   Control
**Authors**: Xuanchi Ren, Tianchang Shen, Jiahui Huang, Huan Ling, Yifan Lu, Merlin Nimier-David, Thomas Müller, Alexander Keller, Sanja Fidler, Jun Gao

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T18:59:50Z

**Summary**: We present GEN3C, a generative video model with precise Camera Control and temporal 3D Consistency. Prior video models already generate realistic videos, but they tend to leverage little 3D information, leading to inconsistencies, such as objects popping in and out of existence. Camera control, if implemented at all, is imprecise, because camera parameters are mere inputs to the neural network which must then infer how the video depends on the camera. In contrast, GEN3C is guided by a 3D cache: point clouds obtained by predicting the pixel-wise depth of seed images or previously generated frames. When generating the next frames, GEN3C is conditioned on the 2D renderings of the 3D cache with the new camera trajectory provided by the user. Crucially, this means that GEN3C neither has to remember what it previously generated nor does it have to infer the image structure from the camera pose. The model, instead, can focus all its generative power on previously unobserved regions, as well as advancing the scene state to the next frame. Our results demonstrate more precise camera control than prior work, as well as state-of-the-art results in sparse-view novel view synthesis, even in challenging settings such as driving scenes and monocular dynamic video. Results are best viewed in videos. Check out our webpage! https://research.nvidia.com/labs/toronto-ai/GEN3C/

**Summary**: As large language models (LLMs) become more capable and agentic, the requirement for trust in their outputs grows significantly, yet at the same time concerns have been mounting that models may learn to lie in pursuit of their goals. To address these concerns, a body of work has emerged around the notion of "honesty" in LLMs, along with interventions aimed at mitigating deceptive behaviors. However, evaluations of honesty are currently highly limited, with no benchmark combining large scale and applicability to all models. Moreover, many benchmarks claiming to measure honesty in fact simply measure accuracy--the correctness of a model's beliefs--in disguise. In this work, we introduce a large-scale human-collected dataset for measuring honesty directly, allowing us to disentangle accuracy from honesty for the first time. Across a diverse set of LLMs, we find that while larger models obtain higher accuracy on our benchmark, they do not become more honest. Surprisingly, while most frontier LLMs obtain high scores on truthfulness benchmarks, we find a substantial propensity in frontier LLMs to lie when pressured to do so, resulting in low honesty scores on our benchmark. We find that simple methods, such as representation engineering interventions, can improve honesty. These results underscore the growing need for robust evaluations and effective interventions to ensure LLMs remain trustworthy.

### Personalize Your LLM: Fake it then Align it
**Authors**: Yijing Zhang, Dyah Adila, Changho Shin, Frederic Sala

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T18:59:19Z

**Summary**: Personalizing large language models (LLMs) is essential for delivering tailored interactions that improve user experience. Many existing personalization methods require fine-tuning LLMs for each user, rendering them prohibitively expensive for widespread adoption. Although retrieval-based approaches offer a more compute-efficient alternative, they still depend on large, high-quality datasets that are not consistently available for all users. To address this challenge, we propose CHAMELEON, a scalable and efficient personalization approach that uses (1) self-generated personal preference data and (2) representation editing to enable quick and cost-effective personalization. Our experiments on various tasks, including those from the LaMP personalization benchmark, show that CHAMELEON efficiently adapts models to personal preferences, improving instruction-tuned models and outperforms two personalization baselines by an average of 40% across two model architectures.

### Process-based Self-Rewarding Language Models
**Authors**: Shimao Zhang, Xiao Liu, Xin Zhang, Junxiao Liu, Zheheng Luo, Shujian Huang, Yeyun Gong

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T18:58:44Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models have demonstrated outstanding performance across various downstream tasks and have been widely applied in multiple scenarios. Human-annotated preference data is used for training to further improve LLMs' performance, which is constrained by the upper limit of human performance. Therefore, Self-Rewarding method has been proposed, where LLMs generate training data by rewarding their own outputs. However, the existing self-rewarding paradigm is not effective in mathematical reasoning scenarios and may even lead to a decline in performance. In this work, we propose the Process-based Self-Rewarding pipeline for language models, which introduces long-thought reasoning, step-wise LLM-as-a-Judge, and step-wise preference optimization within the self-rewarding paradigm. Our new paradigm successfully enhances the performance of LLMs on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks through iterative Process-based Self-Rewarding, demonstrating the immense potential of self-rewarding to achieve LLM reasoning that may surpass human capabilities.

### Towards Understanding Distilled Reasoning Models: A Representational   Approach
**Authors**: David D. Baek, Max Tegmark

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T18:40:19Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we investigate how model distillation impacts the development of reasoning features in large language models (LLMs). To explore this, we train a crosscoder on Qwen-series models and their fine-tuned variants. Our results suggest that the crosscoder learns features corresponding to various types of reasoning, including self-reflection and computation verification. Moreover, we observe that distilled models contain unique reasoning feature directions, which could be used to steer the model into over-thinking or incisive-thinking mode. In particular, we perform analysis on four specific reasoning categories: (a) self-reflection, (b) deductive reasoning, (c) alternative reasoning, and (d) contrastive reasoning. Finally, we examine the changes in feature geometry resulting from the distillation process and find indications that larger distilled models may develop more structured representations, which correlate with enhanced distillation performance. By providing insights into how distillation modifies the model, our study contributes to enhancing the transparency and reliability of AI systems.

### CDS: Data Synthesis Method Guided by Cognitive Diagnosis Theory
**Authors**: Haokun Zhao, Jinyi Han, Jiaqing Liang, Yanghua Xiao

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T18:39:05Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant advancements, but the increasing complexity of tasks and higher performance demands highlight the need for continuous improvement. Some approaches utilize synthetic data generated by advanced LLMs based on evaluation results to train models. However, conventional evaluation methods fail to provide detailed, fine-grained profiles of LLMs, limiting their guidance for data synthesis. In this paper, we introduce the Cognitive Diagnostic Synthesis (CDS) method, which incorporates a diagnostic process inspired by Cognitive Diagnosis Theory (CDT) to refine evaluation results and characterize model profiles at the knowledge component level. Based on these diagnostics, we propose two diagnosis-synthesis strategies for weakness-targeted data synthesis. Additionally, we present an enhanced data augmentation and selection pipeline to improve the quality and diversity of synthesized data. Our experiments with several open-source models show significant improvements across multiple benchmarks, achieving up to 6.00% improvement in code generation, 13.10% in mathematical reasoning, and 5.43% in academic exams. Code and data are available on GitHub.

### Interactive Data Harmonization with LLM Agents
**Authors**: Aécio Santos, Eduardo H. M. Pena, Roque Lopez, Juliana Freire

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T18:33:41Z

**Summary**: Data harmonization is an essential task that entails integrating datasets from diverse sources. Despite years of research in this area, it remains a time-consuming and challenging task due to schema mismatches, varying terminologies, and differences in data collection methodologies. This paper presents the case for agentic data harmonization as a means to both empower experts to harmonize their data and to streamline the process. We introduce Harmonia, a system that combines LLM-based reasoning, an interactive user interface, and a library of data harmonization primitives to automate the synthesis of data harmonization pipelines. We demonstrate Harmonia in a clinical data harmonization scenario, where it helps to interactively create reusable pipelines that map datasets to a standard format. Finally, we discuss challenges and open problems, and suggest research directions for advancing our vision.

### Assessing Correctness in LLM-Based Code Generation via Uncertainty   Estimation
**Authors**: Arindam Sharma, Cristina David

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T18:24:41Z

**Summary**: In this work, we explore uncertainty estimation as a proxy for correctness in LLM-generated code. To this end, we adapt two state-of-the-art techniques from natural language generation -- one based on entropy and another on mutual information -- to the domain of code generation. Given the distinct semantic properties of code, we introduce modifications, including a semantic equivalence check based on symbolic execution. Our findings indicate a strong correlation between the uncertainty computed through these techniques and correctness, highlighting the potential of uncertainty estimation for quality assessment. Additionally, we propose a simplified version of the entropy-based method that assumes a uniform distribution over the LLM's responses, demonstrating comparable effectiveness. Using these techniques, we develop an abstention policy that prevents the model from making predictions when uncertainty is high, reducing incorrect outputs to near zero. Our evaluation on the LiveCodeBench shows that our approach significantly outperforms a baseline relying solely on LLM-reported log-probabilities.

### PARAMANU-GANITA: Can Small Math Language Models Rival with Large   Language Models on Mathematical Reasoning?
**Authors**: Mitodru Niyogi, Arnab Bhattacharya

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T18:17:28Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we study whether domain specific pretraining of small generative language models (SLM) from scratch with domain specialized tokenizer and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) instruction fine-tuning results in competitive performance on mathematical reasoning compared to LLMs? Secondly, whether this approach is environmentally sustainable, highly cost efficient? To address these research questions, we present Paramanu-Ganita, a 208 million-parameter novel decoder-only Auto Regressive SLM on mathematics. We performed pretraining from scratch on 31.5 billion tokens for 170 A100 hours using a context size of 4096 on a mixed mathematical corpus consisting of web pages, source code, textbooks, CoT templatised StackOverflow QA pairs, and mathematical lecture notes in LaTeX curated by us. We also trained a math and code specialised BPE tokenizer. We proposed and performed CoT instruction fine-tuning of Paramanu-Ganita on the MetaMathQA dataset. Our model Paramanu-Ganita, despite being 34 times smaller than the 7B LLMs, outperforms generalist LLMs by approximately 30% points, and even math-specialised LLMs by 3-23% points in GSM8K test accuracy metric. On MATH benchmark, Paramanu-Ganita outperformed the various models by 6-8% points. On benchmarks like LogiQA, MMLU (high school, college level), and competitive exams level, AGIEVAL (AQuA-RAT, SAT-Math), Paramanu-Ganita outperformed others by 1-4%. Our model is available at https://huggingface.co/gyanai/paramanu-ganita-208M-hf .

### Improving LLM Safety Alignment with Dual-Objective Optimization
**Authors**: Xuandong Zhao, Will Cai, Tianneng Shi, David Huang, Licong Lin, Song Mei, Dawn Song

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T18:01:05Z

**Summary**: Existing training-time safety alignment techniques for large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. Direct preference optimization (DPO), a widely deployed alignment method, exhibits limitations in both experimental and theoretical contexts as its loss function proves suboptimal for refusal learning. Through gradient-based analysis, we identify these shortcomings and propose an improved safety alignment that disentangles DPO objectives into two components: (1) robust refusal training, which encourages refusal even when partial unsafe generations are produced, and (2) targeted unlearning of harmful knowledge. This approach significantly increases LLM robustness against a wide range of jailbreak attacks, including prefilling, suffix, and multi-turn attacks across both in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios. Furthermore, we introduce a method to emphasize critical refusal tokens by incorporating a reward-based token-level weighting mechanism for refusal learning, which further improves the robustness against adversarial exploits. Our research also suggests that robustness to jailbreak attacks is correlated with token distribution shifts in the training process and internal representations of refusal and harmful tokens, offering valuable directions for future research in LLM safety alignment.

### Fractal Calibration for long-tailed object detection
**Authors**: Konstantinos Panagiotis Alexandridis, Ismail Elezi, Jiankang Deng, Anh Nguyen, Shan Luo

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T17:57:48Z

**Summary**: Real-world datasets follow an imbalanced distribution, which poses significant challenges in rare-category object detection. Recent studies tackle this problem by developing re-weighting and re-sampling methods, that utilise the class frequencies of the dataset. However, these techniques focus solely on the frequency statistics and ignore the distribution of the classes in image space, missing important information. In contrast to them, we propose FRActal CALibration (FRACAL): a novel post-calibration method for long-tailed object detection. FRACAL devises a logit adjustment method that utilises the fractal dimension to estimate how uniformly classes are distributed in image space. During inference, it uses the fractal dimension to inversely downweight the probabilities of uniformly spaced class predictions achieving balance in two axes: between frequent and rare categories, and between uniformly spaced and sparsely spaced classes. FRACAL is a post-processing method and it does not require any training, also it can be combined with many off-the-shelf models such as one-stage sigmoid detectors and two-stage instance segmentation models. FRACAL boosts the rare class performance by up to 8.6% and surpasses all previous methods on LVIS dataset, while showing good generalisation to other datasets such as COCO, V3Det and OpenImages. We provide the code at https://github.com/kostas1515/FRACAL.

### Effective LLM Knowledge Learning via Model Generalization
**Authors**: Mingkang Zhu, Xi Chen, Zhongdao Wang, Bei Yu, Hengshuang Zhao, Jiaya Jia

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T17:56:20Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are trained on enormous documents that contain extensive world knowledge. However, it is still not well-understood how knowledge is acquired via autoregressive pre-training. This lack of understanding greatly hinders effective knowledge learning, especially for continued pretraining on up-to-date information, as this evolving information often lacks diverse repetitions like foundational knowledge. In this paper, we focus on understanding and improving LLM knowledge learning. We found and verified that knowledge learning for LLMs can be deemed as an implicit supervised task hidden in the autoregressive pre-training objective. Our findings suggest that knowledge learning for LLMs would benefit from methods designed to improve generalization ability for supervised tasks. Based on our analysis, we propose the formatting-based data augmentation to grow in-distribution samples, which does not present the risk of altering the facts embedded in documents as text paraphrasing. We also introduce sharpness-aware minimization as an effective optimization algorithm to better improve generalization. Moreover, our analysis and method can be readily extended to instruction tuning. Extensive experiment results validate our findings and demonstrate our methods' effectiveness in both continued pre-training and instruction tuning. This paper offers new perspectives and insights to interpret and design effective strategies for LLM knowledge learning.

### A Practical Memory Injection Attack against LLM Agents
**Authors**: Shen Dong, Shaocheng Xu, Pengfei He, Yige Li, Jiliang Tang, Tianming Liu, Hui Liu, Zhen Xiang

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T17:53:24Z

**Summary**: Agents based on large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in a wide range of complex, real-world applications. However, LLM agents with a compromised memory bank may easily produce harmful outputs when the past records retrieved for demonstration are malicious. In this paper, we propose a novel Memory INJection Attack, MINJA, that enables the injection of malicious records into the memory bank by only interacting with the agent via queries and output observations. These malicious records are designed to elicit a sequence of malicious reasoning steps leading to undesirable agent actions when executing the victim user's query. Specifically, we introduce a sequence of bridging steps to link the victim query to the malicious reasoning steps. During the injection of the malicious record, we propose an indication prompt to guide the agent to autonomously generate our designed bridging steps. We also propose a progressive shortening strategy that gradually removes the indication prompt, such that the malicious record will be easily retrieved when processing the victim query comes after. Our extensive experiments across diverse agents demonstrate the effectiveness of MINJA in compromising agent memory. With minimal requirements for execution, MINJA enables any user to influence agent memory, highlighting practical risks of LLM agents.

### Developing and Utilizing a Large-Scale Cantonese Dataset for   Multi-Tasking in Large Language Models
**Authors**: Jiyue Jiang, Alfred Kar Yin Truong, Yanyu Chen, Qinghang Bao, Sheng Wang, Pengan Chen, Jiuming Wang, Lingpeng Kong, Yu Li, Chuan Wu

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T17:53:07Z

**Summary**: High-quality data resources play a crucial role in learning large language models (LLMs), particularly for low-resource languages like Cantonese. Despite having more than 85 million native speakers, Cantonese is still considered a low-resource language in the field of natural language processing (NLP) due to factors such as the dominance of Mandarin, lack of cohesion within the Cantonese-speaking community, diversity in character encoding and input methods, and the tendency of overseas Cantonese speakers to prefer using English. In addition, rich colloquial vocabulary of Cantonese, English loanwords, and code-switching characteristics add to the complexity of corpus collection and processing. To address these challenges, we collect Cantonese texts from a variety of sources, including open source corpora, Hong Kong-specific forums, Wikipedia, and Common Crawl data. We conduct rigorous data processing through language filtering, quality filtering, content filtering, and de-duplication steps, successfully constructing a high-quality Cantonese corpus of over 2 billion tokens for training large language models. We further refined the model through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on curated Cantonese tasks, enhancing its ability to handle specific applications. Upon completion of the training, the model achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on four Cantonese benchmarks. After training on our dataset, the model also exhibits improved performance on other mainstream language tasks.

### High-Energy Neutrinos by Hydrogen-rich Supernovae interacting with   low-massive Circumstellar Medium: The Case of SN 2023ixf
**Authors**: S. P. Cosentino, M. L. Pumo, S. Cherubini

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T17:51:45Z

**Summary**: In hydrogen-rich (H-rich) Supernova (SN) events, the collision between the H-rich ejecta and the Circum-Stellar Medium (CSM) can accelerate particles and produce high-energy neutrinos (HE-$\nu$, TeV-PeV) through proton-proton inelastic scattering. Despite understanding the production mechanism of these neutrinos, the lack of direct observations raises questions about particle acceleration efficiency and the involved astrophysical conditions. This study focuses on neutrino emission from H-rich SNe with low-mass CSM, such as SN 2023ixf. We developed a semi-analytical model to characterize the progenitor and CSM at the explosion time, allowing us to infer the expected neutrino flux at Earth during the SN's interaction phase. Our model shows that neutrino emission depends not only on shock velocity and CSM mass but also on the spatial matter distribution of the CSM. By analysing the bolometric light curve of SN 2023ixf beyond 100 days post-explosion, we find that its ejecta, consisting of $9\,\text{M}_{\rm \odot}$ (including $0.07\,\text{M}_{\rm \odot}$ of radioactive $^{56}$Ni) and having a kinetic energy of $1.8\,\text{foe}$, collides with a low-mass CSM of $0.06\,\text{M}_{\rm \odot}$ distributed according to a power-law density profile with an exponent of $s=2.9$. Through these parameters, we estimate that up to $4\pm1\times 10^{-2}$ muon (anti-)neutrino events could be detected by IceCube within 50 days post-explosion. Although the predicted flux ($\lesssim 3\times 10^{-9}\,\text{GeV} \, \text{cm}^{-2} \, \text{s}^{-1}$) is below current IceCube sensitivity, future telescopes like IceCube-Gen2 and KM3NeT could detect HE-$\nu$ from similar SN events.

### Beyond Matryoshka: Revisiting Sparse Coding for Adaptive Representation
**Authors**: Tiansheng Wen, Yifei Wang, Zequn Zeng, Zhong Peng, Yudi Su, Xinyang Liu, Bo Chen, Hongwei Liu, Stefanie Jegelka, Chenyu You

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T17:51:09Z

**Summary**: Many large-scale systems rely on high-quality deep representations (embeddings) to facilitate tasks like retrieval, search, and generative modeling. Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) recently emerged as a solution for adaptive embedding lengths, but it requires full model retraining and suffers from noticeable performance degradations at short lengths. In this paper, we show that sparse coding offers a compelling alternative for achieving adaptive representation with minimal overhead and higher fidelity. We propose Contrastive Sparse Representation (CSR), a method that sparsifies pre-trained embeddings into a high-dimensional but selectively activated feature space. By leveraging lightweight autoencoding and task-aware contrastive objectives, CSR preserves semantic quality while allowing flexible, cost-effective inference at different sparsity levels. Extensive experiments on image, text, and multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that CSR consistently outperforms MRL in terms of both accuracy and retrieval speed-often by large margins-while also cutting training time to a fraction of that required by MRL.

**Authors**: Yutong Wang, Jiali Zeng, Xuebo Liu, Derek F. Wong, Fandong Meng, Jie Zhou, Min Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T17:50:44Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved reasonable quality improvements in machine translation (MT). However, most current research on MT-LLMs still faces significant challenges in maintaining translation consistency and accuracy when processing entire documents. In this paper, we introduce DelTA, a Document-levEL Translation Agent designed to overcome these limitations. DelTA features a multi-level memory structure that stores information across various granularities and spans, including Proper Noun Records, Bilingual Summary, Long-Term Memory, and Short-Term Memory, which are continuously retrieved and updated by auxiliary LLM-based components. Experimental results indicate that DelTA significantly outperforms strong baselines in terms of translation consistency and quality across four open/closed-source LLMs and two representative document translation datasets, achieving an increase in consistency scores by up to 4.58 percentage points and in COMET scores by up to 3.16 points on average. DelTA employs a sentence-by-sentence translation strategy, ensuring no sentence omissions and offering a memory-efficient solution compared to the mainstream method. Furthermore, DelTA improves pronoun and context-dependent translation accuracy, and the summary component of the agent also shows promise as a tool for query-based summarization tasks. The code and data of our approach are released at https://github.com/YutongWang1216/DocMTAgent.

### ILLC: Iterative Layer-by-Layer Compression for Enhancing Structural   Faithfulness in SpArX
**Authors**: Ungsik Kim

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T17:43:49Z

**Summary**: In the field of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), argumentative XAI approaches have been proposed to represent the internal reasoning process of deep neural networks in a more transparent way by interpreting hidden nodes as arguements. However, as the number of layers increases, existing compression methods simplify all layers at once, which lead to high accumulative information loss. To compensate for this, we propose an iterative layer-by-layer compression technique in which each layer is compressed separately and the reduction error in the next layer is immediately compensated for, thereby improving the overall input-output and structural fidelity of the model. Experiments on the Breast Cancer Diagnosis dataset show that, compared to traditional compression, the method reduces input-output and structural unfaithfulness, and maintains a more consistent attack-support relationship in the Argumentative Explanation scheme. This is significant because it provides a new way to make complex MLP models more compact while still conveying their internal inference logic without distortion.

### Addressing Overprescribing Challenges: Fine-Tuning Large Language Models   for Medication Recommendation Tasks
**Authors**: Zihao Zhao, Chenxiao Fan, Chongming Gao, Fuli Feng, Xiangnan He

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T17:28:16Z

**Summary**: Medication recommendation systems have garnered attention within healthcare for their potential to deliver personalized and efficacious drug combinations based on patient's clinical data. However, existing methodologies encounter challenges in adapting to diverse Electronic Health Records (EHR) systems and effectively utilizing unstructured data, resulting in limited generalization capabilities and suboptimal performance. Recently, interest is growing in harnessing Large Language Models (LLMs) in the medical domain to support healthcare professionals and enhance patient care. Despite the emergence of medical LLMs and their promising results in tasks like medical question answering, their practical applicability in clinical settings, particularly in medication recommendation, often remains underexplored.   In this study, we evaluate both general-purpose and medical-specific LLMs for medication recommendation tasks. Our findings reveal that LLMs frequently encounter the challenge of overprescribing, leading to heightened clinical risks and diminished medication recommendation accuracy. To address this issue, we propose Language-Assisted Medication Recommendation (LAMO), which employs a parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach to tailor open-source LLMs for optimal performance in medication recommendation scenarios. LAMO leverages the wealth of clinical information within clinical notes, a resource often underutilized in traditional methodologies. As a result of our approach, LAMO outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by over 10% in internal validation accuracy. Furthermore, temporal and external validations demonstrate LAMO's robust generalization capabilities across various temporal and hospital contexts. Additionally, an out-of-distribution medication recommendation experiment demonstrates LAMO's remarkable accuracy even with medications outside the training data.

### MAS-GPT: Training LLMs to Build LLM-based Multi-Agent Systems
**Authors**: Rui Ye, Shuo Tang, Rui Ge, Yaxin Du, Zhenfei Yin, Siheng Chen, Jing Shao

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T17:27:59Z

**Summary**: LLM-based multi-agent systems (MAS) have shown significant potential in tackling diverse tasks. However, to design effective MAS, existing approaches heavily rely on manual configurations or multiple calls of advanced LLMs, resulting in inadaptability and high inference costs. In this paper, we simplify the process of building an MAS by reframing it as a generative language task, where the input is a user query and the output is a corresponding MAS. To address this novel task, we unify the representation of MAS as executable code and propose a consistency-oriented data construction pipeline to create a high-quality dataset comprising coherent and consistent query-MAS pairs. Using this dataset, we train MAS-GPT, an open-source medium-sized LLM that is capable of generating query-adaptive MAS within a single LLM inference. The generated MAS can be seamlessly applied to process user queries and deliver high-quality responses. Extensive experiments on 9 benchmarks and 5 LLMs show that the proposed MAS-GPT consistently outperforms 10+ baseline MAS methods on diverse settings, indicating MAS-GPT's high effectiveness, efficiency and strong generalization ability. Code will be available at https://github.com/rui-ye/MAS-GPT.

### Towards Trustworthy Federated Learning
**Authors**: Alina Basharat, Yijun Bian, Ping Xu, Zhi Tian

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T17:25:20Z

**Summary**: This paper develops a comprehensive framework to address three critical trustworthy challenges in federated learning (FL): robustness against Byzantine attacks, fairness, and privacy preservation. To improve the system's defense against Byzantine attacks that send malicious information to bias the system's performance, we develop a Two-sided Norm Based Screening (TNBS) mechanism, which allows the central server to crop the gradients that have the l lowest norms and h highest norms. TNBS functions as a screening tool to filter out potential malicious participants whose gradients are far from the honest ones. To promote egalitarian fairness, we adopt the q-fair federated learning (q-FFL). Furthermore, we adopt a differential privacy-based scheme to prevent raw data at local clients from being inferred by curious parties. Convergence guarantees are provided for the proposed framework under different scenarios. Experimental results on real datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework effectively improves robustness and fairness while managing the trade-off between privacy and accuracy. This work appears to be the first study that experimentally and theoretically addresses fairness, privacy, and robustness in trustworthy FL.

**Authors**: Saikat Barua, Mostafizur Rahman, Md Jafor Sadek, Rafiul Islam, Shehnaz Khaled, Md. Shohrab Hossain

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T17:11:13Z

**Summary**: The principles of automation and innovation serve as foundational elements for advancement in contemporary science and technology. Here, we introduce Pygen, an automation platform designed to empower researchers, technologists, and hobbyists to bring abstract ideas to life as core, usable software tools written in Python. Pygen leverages the immense power of autoregressive large language models to augment human creativity during the ideation, iteration, and innovation process. By combining state-of-the-art language models with open-source code generation technologies, Pygen has significantly reduced the manual overhead of tool development. From a user prompt, Pygen automatically generates Python packages for a complete workflow from concept to package generation and documentation. The findings of our work show that Pygen considerably enhances the researcher's productivity by enabling the creation of resilient, modular, and well-documented packages for various specialized purposes. We employ a prompt enhancement approach to distill the user's package description into increasingly specific and actionable. While being inherently an open-ended task, we have evaluated the generated packages and the documentation using Human Evaluation, LLM-based evaluation, and CodeBLEU, with detailed results in the results section. Furthermore, we documented our results, analyzed the limitations, and suggested strategies to alleviate them. Pygen is our vision of ethical automation, a framework that promotes inclusivity, accessibility, and collaborative development. This project marks the beginning of a large-scale effort towards creating tools where intelligent agents collaborate with humans to improve scientific and technological development substantially.   Our code and generated examples are open-sourced at [https://github.com/GitsSaikat/Pygen]

### Study of an active region prominence using spectropolarimetric data in   the He I D3 multiplet
**Authors**: S. Esteban Pozuelo, A. Asensio Ramos, J. Trujillo Bueno, R. Ramelli, F. Zeuner, M. Bianda

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T17:04:46Z

**Summary**: Prominences are cool overdensities of plasma supported by magnetic fields that levitate in the solar corona. The physical characterization of these structures is key for understanding the magnetic field in the corona. Our work attempts to shed light on the properties of prominences by using observations at high polarimetric sensitivity in the He I D3 multiplet taken with the Zurich Imaging Polarimeter-3 instrument at the Istituto ricerche solari Aldo e Cele Dacco observatory. We used the HAZEL inversion code to infer the thermodynamic and magnetic properties of an active region prominence, assuming one- and two-component models. Our observations unveil a great diversity of physical conditions in the prominence. The observed Stokes profiles are usually broad and show interesting features, which can be described assuming a two-component model. The contribution of each component and the trends inferred for some parameters vary with the distance to the solar limb. While both components have analogous properties and contribute similarly close to the limb, a major component mainly describes the properties inferred at 10-40 arcsecs away from the limb. Moreover, both components usually show significant differences in thermal broadening, which is essential for ensuring a good fit quality between observations and synthetic profiles. Summarizing, the observed region of the prominence shows line-of-sight velocities of 1-3 km/s and rather horizontal fields of 20-80 gauss. We also report hints of a twist close to a prominence foot and changes in the magnetic configuration at specific locations. Our results indicate a mainly horizontal magnetic field of a few tens of gauss in the prominence. A model of two components with different thermal broadenings and filling factors, depending on the limb distance, is crucial for providing a consistent solution across most of the observed prominence.

### Attentive Reasoning Queries: A Systematic Method for Optimizing   Instruction-Following in Large Language Models
**Authors**: Bar Karov, Dor Zohar, Yam Marcovitz

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T17:03:48Z

**Summary**: We present Attentive Reasoning Queries (ARQs), a novel structured reasoning approach that significantly improves instruction-following in Large Language Models through domain-specialized reasoning blueprints. While LLMs demonstrate remarkable capabilities across diverse tasks, they often fail to maintain adherence to complex, use-case-specific instructions during multi-turn conversations, presenting challenges for business-critical applications. ARQs address this limitation by guiding LLMs through systematic reasoning steps with targeted queries that reinstate critical instructions and facilitate intermediate reasoning throughout the completion process. In extensive testing within Parlant, our framework for reliable customer-facing agents in which ARQs were born out of necessity, they achieved a 90.2% success rate across 87 test scenarios, outperforming both Chain-of-Thought reasoning (86.1%) and direct response generation (81.5%). ARQs showed particular strength in addressing persistent failure modes like guideline re-application and hallucination prevention. Our analysis also revealed that ARQs can potentially be more computationally efficient than free-form reasoning when carefully designed. These findings demonstrate that structured reasoning approaches provide effective mechanisms for controlling how LLMs process information and make decisions in complex scenarios.

### Analogical Reasoning Inside Large Language Models: Concept Vectors and   the Limits of Abstraction
**Authors**: Gustaw Opiełka, Hannes Rosenbusch, Claire E. Stevenson

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T16:59:08Z

**Summary**: Analogical reasoning relies on conceptual abstractions, but it is unclear whether Large Language Models (LLMs) harbor such internal representations. We explore distilled representations from LLM activations and find that function vectors (FVs; Todd et al., 2024) - compact representations for in-context learning (ICL) tasks - are not invariant to simple input changes (e.g., open-ended vs. multiple-choice), suggesting they capture more than pure concepts. Using representational similarity analysis (RSA), we localize a small set of attention heads that encode invariant concept vectors (CVs) for verbal concepts like "antonym". These CVs function as feature detectors that operate independently of the final output - meaning that a model may form a correct internal representation yet still produce an incorrect output. Furthermore, CVs can be used to causally guide model behaviour. However, for more abstract concepts like "previous" and "next", we do not observe invariant linear representations, a finding we link to generalizability issues LLMs display within these domains.

### SMAC-R1: The Emergence of Intelligence in Decision-Making Tasks
**Authors**: Yue Deng, Weiyu Ma, Yuxin Fan, Ruyi Song, Yin Zhang, Haifeng Zhang, Jian Zhao

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T16:49:51Z

**Summary**: StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC) has been one of the most commonly used experimental environments in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), where the specific task is to control a set number of allied units to defeat enemy forces. Traditional MARL algorithms often require interacting with the environment for millions of steps to train a parametric model, of which the resulting policies are typically non-interpretable with weak transferability. In this paper, we introduce SMAC-R1 which is based on the Qwen2.5-7B-Base LLM distilled from DeepSeek-Coder-v2.5-236B. Similar to online reinforcement learning after behavior cloning in offline learning process, in our pipeline, agents leverage the DeepSeek LLM to generate decision tree code by providing task descriptions, and the agents are further self-reflected using feedback from the rewards provided by the environment. Based on that, we augment the generated scripts to fine-tune a small LLM, Qwen2.5-7B-Base, to distill the decision-making ability via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and enhance the script generation ability by the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm. We conduct experiments in the original 23 SMAC tasks and 10 newly-designed tasks to demonstrate that our method can produce high-quality, interpretable decision trees with minimal environmental exploration. Moreover, these scripts exhibit strong transferability, successfully applying to homogeneous SMAC environments without modification. We believe this approach offers a new direction for solving decision-making tasks and domain-specific LLM training pipelines in the future.

### CycleResearcher: Improving Automated Research via Automated Review
**Authors**: Yixuan Weng, Minjun Zhu, Guangsheng Bao, Hongbo Zhang, Jindong Wang, Yue Zhang, Linyi Yang

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T16:36:05Z

**Summary**: The automation of scientific discovery has been a long-standing goal within the research community, driven by the potential to accelerate knowledge creation. While significant progress has been made using commercial large language models (LLMs) as research assistants or idea generators, the possibility of automating the entire research process with open-source LLMs remains largely unexplored. This paper explores the feasibility of using open-source post-trained LLMs as autonomous agents capable of performing the full cycle of automated research and review, from literature review and manuscript preparation to peer review and paper refinement. Our iterative preference training framework consists of CycleResearcher, which conducts research tasks, and CycleReviewer, which simulates the peer review process, providing iterative feedback via reinforcement learning. To train these models, we develop two new datasets, Review-5k and Research-14k, reflecting real-world machine learning research and peer review dynamics. Our results demonstrate that CycleReviewer achieves promising performance with a 26.89\% reduction in mean absolute error (MAE) compared to individual human reviewers in predicting paper scores, indicating the potential of LLMs to effectively assist expert-level research evaluation. In research, the papers generated by the CycleResearcher model achieved a score of 5.36 in simulated peer reviews, showing some competitiveness in terms of simulated review scores compared to the preprint level of 5.24 from human experts, while still having room for improvement compared to the accepted paper level of 5.69. This work represents a significant step toward fully automated scientific inquiry, providing ethical safeguards and exploring AI-driven research capabilities.

### Improving Neutral Point of View Text Generation through   Parameter-Efficient Reinforcement Learning and a Small-Scale High-Quality   Dataset
**Authors**: Jessica Hoffmann, Christiane Ahlheim, Zac Yu, Aria Walfrand, Jarvis Jin, Marie Tano, Ahmad Beirami, Erin van Liemt, Nithum Thain, Hakim Sidahmed, Lucas Dixon

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T16:32:47Z

**Summary**: This paper describes the construction of a dataset and the evaluation of training methods to improve generative large language models' (LLMs) ability to answer queries on sensitive topics with a Neutral Point of View (NPOV), i.e., to provide significantly more informative, diverse and impartial answers. The dataset, the SHQ-NPOV dataset, comprises 300 high-quality, human-written quadruplets: a query on a sensitive topic, an answer, an NPOV rating, and a set of links to source texts elaborating the various points of view. The first key contribution of this paper is a new methodology to create such datasets through iterative rounds of human peer-critique and annotator training, which we release alongside the dataset. The second key contribution is the identification of a highly effective training regime for parameter-efficient reinforcement learning (PE-RL) to improve NPOV generation. We compare and extensively evaluate PE-RL and multiple baselines-including LoRA finetuning (a strong baseline), SFT and RLHF.   PE-RL not only improves on overall NPOV quality compared to the strongest baseline ($97.06\%\rightarrow 99.08\%$), but also scores much higher on features linguists identify as key to separating good answers from the best answers ($60.25\%\rightarrow 85.21\%$ for presence of supportive details, $68.74\%\rightarrow 91.43\%$ for absence of oversimplification). A qualitative analysis corroborates this. Finally, our evaluation finds no statistical differences between results on topics that appear in the training dataset and those on separated evaluation topics, which provides strong evidence that our approach to training PE-RL exhibits very effective out of topic generalization.

**Authors**: Shaina Raza, Mukund Sayeeganesh Chettiar, Matin Yousefabadi, Tahniat Khan, Marcelo Lotif

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T16:24:43Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we introduce FairSense-AI: a multimodal framework designed to detect and mitigate bias in both text and images. By leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs), FairSense-AI uncovers subtle forms of prejudice or stereotyping that can appear in content, providing users with bias scores, explanatory highlights, and automated recommendations for fairness enhancements. In addition, FairSense-AI integrates an AI risk assessment component that aligns with frameworks like the MIT AI Risk Repository and NIST AI Risk Management Framework, enabling structured identification of ethical and safety concerns. The platform is optimized for energy efficiency via techniques such as model pruning and mixed-precision computation, thereby reducing its environmental footprint. Through a series of case studies and applications, we demonstrate how FairSense-AI promotes responsible AI use by addressing both the social dimension of fairness and the pressing need for sustainability in large-scale AI deployments. https://vectorinstitute.github.io/FairSense-AI, https://pypi.org/project/fair-sense-ai/ (Sustainability , Responsible AI , Large Language Models , Vision Language Models , Ethical AI , Green AI)

### Psy-Copilot: Visual Chain of Thought for Counseling
**Authors**: Keqi Chen, Zekai Sun, Huijun Lian, Yingming Gao, Ya Li

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T16:23:15Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly popular in the field of psychological counseling. However, when human therapists work with LLMs in therapy sessions, it is hard to understand how the model gives the answers. To address this, we have constructed Psy-COT, a graph designed to visualize the thought processes of LLMs during therapy sessions. The Psy-COT graph presents semi-structured counseling conversations alongside step-by-step annotations that capture the reasoning and insights of therapists. Moreover, we have developed Psy-Copilot, which is a conversational AI assistant designed to assist human psychological therapists in their consultations. It can offer traceable psycho-information based on retrieval, including response candidates, similar dialogue sessions, related strategies, and visual traces of results. We have also built an interactive platform for AI-assisted counseling. It has an interface that displays the relevant parts of the retrieval sub-graph. The Psy-Copilot is designed not to replace psychotherapists but to foster collaboration between AI and human therapists, thereby promoting mental health development. Our code and demo are both open-sourced and available for use.

### MIRROR: A Novel Approach for the Automated Evaluation of Open-Ended   Question Generation
**Authors**: Aniket Deroy, Subhankar Maity, Sudeshna Sarkar

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T16:16:01Z

**Summary**: Automatic question generation is a critical task that involves evaluating question quality by considering factors such as engagement, pedagogical value, and the ability to stimulate critical thinking. These aspects require human-like understanding and judgment, which automated systems currently lack. However, human evaluations are costly and impractical for large-scale samples of generated questions. Therefore, we propose a novel system, MIRROR (Multi-LLM Iterative Review and Response for Optimized Rating), which leverages large language models (LLMs) to automate the evaluation process for questions generated by automated question generation systems. We experimented with several state-of-the-art LLMs, such as GPT-4, Gemini, and Llama2-70b. We observed that the scores of human evaluation metrics, namely relevance, appropriateness, novelty, complexity, and grammaticality, improved when using the feedback-based approach called MIRROR, tending to be closer to the human baseline scores. Furthermore, we observed that Pearson's correlation coefficient between GPT-4 and human experts improved when using our proposed feedback-based approach, MIRROR, compared to direct prompting for evaluation. Error analysis shows that our proposed approach, MIRROR, significantly helps to improve relevance and appropriateness.

### Generative Adversarial Networks for High-Dimensional Item Factor   Analysis: A Deep Adversarial Learning Algorithm
**Authors**: Nanyu Luo, Feng Ji

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T16:11:42Z

**Summary**: Advances in deep learning and representation learning have transformed item factor analysis (IFA) in the item response theory (IRT) literature by enabling more efficient and accurate parameter estimation. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) have been one of the most impactful techniques in modeling high-dimensional latent variables in this context. However, the limited expressiveness of the inference model based on traditional VAEs can still hinder the estimation performance. We introduce Adversarial Variational Bayes (AVB) algorithms as an improvement to VAEs for IFA with improved flexibility and accuracy. By bridging the strengths of VAEs and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), AVB incorporates an auxiliary discriminator network to reframe the estimation process as a two-player adversarial game and removes the restrictive assumption of standard normal distributions in the inference model. Theoretically, AVB can achieve similar or higher likelihood compared to VAEs. A further enhanced algorithm, Importance-weighted Adversarial Variational Bayes (IWAVB) is proposed and compared with Importance-weighted Autoencoders (IWAE). In an exploratory analysis of empirical data, IWAVB demonstrated superior expressiveness by achieving a higher likelihood compared to IWAE. In confirmatory analysis with simulated data, IWAVB achieved similar mean-square error results to IWAE while consistently achieving higher likelihoods. When latent variables followed a multimodal distribution, IWAVB outperformed IWAE. With its innovative use of GANs, IWAVB is shown to have the potential to extend IFA to handle large-scale data, facilitating the potential integration of psychometrics and multimodal data analysis.

### Exploring Code Language Models for Automated HLS-based Hardware   Generation: Benchmark, Infrastructure and Analysis
**Authors**: Jiahao Gai, Hao Mark Chen, Zhican Wang, Hongyu Zhou, Wanru Zhao, Nicholas Lane, Hongxiang Fan

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T16:07:23Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in code generation have illuminated the potential of employing large language models (LLMs) for general-purpose programming languages such as Python and C++, opening new opportunities for automating software development and enhancing programmer productivity. The potential of LLMs in software programming has sparked significant interest in exploring automated hardware generation and automation. Although preliminary endeavors have been made to adopt LLMs in generating hardware description languages (HDLs), several challenges persist in this direction. First, the volume of available HDL training data is substantially smaller compared to that for software programming languages. Second, the pre-trained LLMs, mainly tailored for software code, tend to produce HDL designs that are more error-prone. Third, the generation of HDL requires a significantly higher number of tokens compared to software programming, leading to inefficiencies in cost and energy consumption. To tackle these challenges, this paper explores leveraging LLMs to generate High-Level Synthesis (HLS)-based hardware design. Although code generation for domain-specific programming languages is not new in the literature, we aim to provide experimental results, insights, benchmarks, and evaluation infrastructure to investigate the suitability of HLS over low-level HDLs for LLM-assisted hardware design generation. To achieve this, we first finetune pre-trained models for HLS-based hardware generation, using a collected dataset with text prompts and corresponding reference HLS designs. An LLM-assisted framework is then proposed to automate end-to-end hardware code generation, which also investigates the impact of chain-of-thought and feedback loops promoting techniques on HLS-design generation. Limited by the timeframe of this research, we plan to evaluate more advanced reasoning models in the future.

### Design and Implementation of an IoT Cluster with Raspberry Pi Powered by   Solar Energy: A Theoretical Approach
**Authors**: Noel Portillo

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T15:58:24Z

**Summary**: This document presents the design and implementation of a low-power IoT server cluster, based on Raspberry Pi 3 Model B and powered by solar energy. The proposed architecture integrates Kubernetes (K3s) and Docker, providing an efficient, scalable, and high-performance computing environment. The cluster is designed to optimize energy consumption, leveraging a 200W solar panel system and a 100Ah lithium-ion battery to support continuous operation under favorable environmental conditions. Performance analysis was conducted based on theoretical inferences and data obtained from external sources, evaluating resource allocation, power consumption, and service availability. These analyses provide theoretical estimates of the system's operational feasibility under different scenarios. The results suggest that this system can serve as a viable and sustainable alternative for edge computing applications and cloud services, reducing dependence on traditional data centers. In addition to its positive impact on environmental sustainability by significantly reducing the carbon footprint, this solution also addresses economic concerns, as conventional data centers consume enormous amounts of energy, leading to increased demand on the power grid and higher operational costs.

### Reasoning to Attend: Try to Understand How <SEG> Token Works
**Authors**: Rui Qian, Xin Yin, Dejing Dou

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T15:55:51Z

**Summary**: Current Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) empowered visual grounding typically rely on $\texttt{<SEG>}$ token as a text prompt to jointly optimize the vision-language model (e.g., LLaVA) and the downstream task-specified model (\eg, SAM). However, we observe that little research has looked into how it works. In this work, we first visualize the similarity maps, which are obtained by computing the semantic similarity between the $\texttt{<SEG>}$ token and the image token embeddings derived from the last hidden layer in both the LLaVA encoder and SAM decoder. Intriguingly, we have found that a striking consistency holds in terms of activation responses in the similarity map,which reveals that what $\texttt{<SEG>}$ token contributes to is the semantic similarity within image-text pairs. Specifically, $\texttt{<SEG>}$ token, a placeholder expanded in text vocabulary, extensively queries among individual tokenized image patches to match the semantics of an object from text to the paired image while the Large Language Models (LLMs) are being fine-tuned. Upon the above findings, we present READ, which facilitates LMMs' resilient $\textbf{REA}$soning capability of where to atten$\textbf{D}$ under the guidance of highly activated points borrowed from similarity maps. Remarkably, READ features an intuitive design, Similarity as Points module (SasP), which can be seamlessly applied to $\texttt{<SEG>}$-like paradigms in a plug-and-play fashion. Also, extensive experiments have been conducted on the ReasonSeg and RefCOCO(+/g) datasets. To validate whether READ suffers from catastrophic forgetting of previous skills after fine-tuning, we further assess its generation ability on an augmented FP-RefCOCO(+/g) dataset. All codes and models are publicly available at https://github.com/rui-qian/READ.

### Measuring and identifying factors of individuals' trust in Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Edoardo Sebastiano De Duro, Giuseppe Alessandro Veltri, Hudson Golino, Massimo Stella

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T15:52:43Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) can engage in human-looking conversational exchanges. Although conversations can elicit trust between users and LLMs, scarce empirical research has examined trust formation in human-LLM contexts, beyond LLMs' trustworthiness or human trust in AI in general. Here, we introduce the Trust-In-LLMs Index (TILLMI) as a new framework to measure individuals' trust in LLMs, extending McAllister's cognitive and affective trust dimensions to LLM-human interactions. We developed TILLMI as a psychometric scale, prototyped with a novel protocol we called LLM-simulated validity. The LLM-based scale was then validated in a sample of 1,000 US respondents. Exploratory Factor Analysis identified a two-factor structure. Two items were then removed due to redundancy, yielding a final 6-item scale with a 2-factor structure. Confirmatory Factor Analysis on a separate subsample showed strong model fit ($CFI = .995$, $TLI = .991$, $RMSEA = .046$, $p_{X^2} > .05$). Convergent validity analysis revealed that trust in LLMs correlated positively with openness to experience, extraversion, and cognitive flexibility, but negatively with neuroticism. Based on these findings, we interpreted TILLMI's factors as "closeness with LLMs" (affective dimension) and "reliance on LLMs" (cognitive dimension). Younger males exhibited higher closeness with- and reliance on LLMs compared to older women. Individuals with no direct experience with LLMs exhibited lower levels of trust compared to LLMs' users. These findings offer a novel empirical foundation for measuring trust in AI-driven verbal communication, informing responsible design, and fostering balanced human-AI collaboration.

### Prompt-enhanced Network for Hateful Meme Classification
**Authors**: Junxi Liu, Yanyan Feng, Jiehai Chen, Yun Xue, Fenghuan Li

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T15:52:25Z

**Summary**: The dynamic expansion of social media has led to an inundation of hateful memes on media platforms, accentuating the growing need for efficient identification and removal. Acknowledging the constraints of conventional multimodal hateful meme classification, which heavily depends on external knowledge and poses the risk of including irrelevant or redundant content, we developed Pen -- a prompt-enhanced network framework based on the prompt learning approach. Specifically, after constructing the sequence through the prompt method and encoding it with a language model, we performed region information global extraction on the encoded sequence for multi-view perception. By capturing global information about inference instances and demonstrations, Pen facilitates category selection by fully leveraging sequence information. This approach significantly improves model classification accuracy. Additionally, to bolster the model's reasoning capabilities in the feature space, we introduced prompt-aware contrastive learning into the framework to improve the quality of sample feature distributions. Through extensive ablation experiments on two public datasets, we evaluate the effectiveness of the Pen framework, concurrently comparing it with state-of-the-art model baselines. Our research findings highlight that Pen surpasses manual prompt methods, showcasing superior generalization and classification accuracy in hateful meme classification tasks. Our code is available at https://github.com/juszzi/Pen.

### CLIP is Strong Enough to Fight Back: Test-time Counterattacks towards   Zero-shot Adversarial Robustness of CLIP
**Authors**: Songlong Xing, Zhengyu Zhao, Nicu Sebe

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T15:51:59Z

**Summary**: Despite its prevalent use in image-text matching tasks in a zero-shot manner, CLIP has been shown to be highly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations added onto images. Recent studies propose to finetune the vision encoder of CLIP with adversarial samples generated on the fly, and show improved robustness against adversarial attacks on a spectrum of downstream datasets, a property termed as zero-shot robustness. In this paper, we show that malicious perturbations that seek to maximise the classification loss lead to `falsely stable' images, and propose to leverage the pre-trained vision encoder of CLIP to counterattack such adversarial images during inference to achieve robustness. Our paradigm is simple and training-free, providing the first method to defend CLIP from adversarial attacks at test time, which is orthogonal to existing methods aiming to boost zero-shot adversarial robustness of CLIP. We conduct experiments across 16 classification datasets, and demonstrate stable and consistent gains compared to test-time defence methods adapted from existing adversarial robustness studies that do not rely on external networks, without noticeably impairing performance on clean images. We also show that our paradigm can be employed on CLIP models that have been adversarially finetuned to further enhance their robustness at test time. Our code is available \href{https://github.com/Sxing2/CLIP-Test-time-Counterattacks}{here}.

### Large language models in finance: estimating financial sentiment for   stock prediction
**Authors**: Kemal Kirtac, Guido Germano

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T15:51:25Z

**Summary**: Financial sentiment analysis has become a central tool in market forecasting, with an increasing number of academic studies incorporating sentiment measures into financial prediction models. I investigate the origins and use of sentiment measures in finance, tracing their evolution from market-based and lexicon-based approaches to advanced natural language processing techniques. The emergence of large language models has significantly improved the accuracy and depth of sentiment estimation. I examine how BERT-based models, such as RoBERTa and FinBERT, are optimized for structured sentiment classification, while GPT-based models, including GPT-4, OPT, and LLaMA, are more effective for financial text generation and real-time sentiment interpretation. A comparative analysis of bidirectional and autoregressive transformer architectures highlights their respective advantages in algorithmic trading, investor sentiment analysis, and financial decision-making. Hybrid approaches that combine classification and generative capabilities enhance predictive performance in sentiment-driven trading strategies. Findings underscore the increasing role of LLMs in financial sentiment analysis, enabling more nuanced, context-aware sentiment extraction from financial news, earnings reports, and social media data.

### Single Proxy Synthetic Control
**Authors**: Chan Park, Eric Tchetgen Tchetgen

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T15:49:40Z

**Summary**: Synthetic control methods are widely used to estimate the treatment effect on a single treated unit in time-series settings. A common approach to estimate synthetic control weights is to regress the treated unit's pre-treatment outcome and covariates' time series measurements on those of untreated units via ordinary least squares. However, this approach can perform poorly if the pre-treatment fit is not near perfect, whether the weights are normalized or not. In this paper, we introduce a single proxy synthetic control approach, which views the outcomes of untreated units as proxies of the treatment-free potential outcome of the treated unit, a perspective we leverage to construct a valid synthetic control. Under this framework, we establish an alternative identification strategy and corresponding estimation methods for synthetic controls and the treatment effect on the treated unit. Notably, unlike existing proximal synthetic control methods, which require two types of proxies for identification, ours relies on a single type of proxy, thus facilitating its practical relevance. Additionally, we adapt a conformal inference approach to perform inference about the treatment effect, obviating the need for a large number of post-treatment observations. Lastly, our framework can accommodate time-varying covariates and nonlinear models. We demonstrate the proposed approach in a simulation study and a real-world application.

### Enhancing the Accuracy and Comprehensibility in Architectural Tactics   Detection via Small Model-Augmented Prompt Engineering
**Authors**: Lingli Cao, He Zhang, Shanshan Li, Danyang Li, Yanjing Yang, Chenxing Zhong, Xin Zhou, Yue Xie

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T15:47:22Z

**Summary**: Architectural tactics (ATs), as the concrete implementation of architectural decisions in code, address non-functional requirements of software systems. Due to the implicit nature of architectural knowledge in code implementation, developers may risk inadvertently altering or removing these tactics during code modifications or optimizations. Such unintended changes can trigger architectural erosion, gradually undermining the system's original design. While many researchers have proposed machine learning-based methods to improve the accuracy of detecting ATs in code, the black-box nature and the required architectural domain knowledge pose significant challenges for developers in verifying the results. Effective verification requires not only accurate detection results but also interpretable explanations that enhance their comprehensibility. However, this is a critical gap in current research. Large language models (LLMs) can generate easily interpretable ATs detection comments if they have domain knowledge. Fine-tuning LLMs to acquire domain knowledge faces challenges such as catastrophic forgetting and hardware constraints. Thus, we propose Prmt4TD, a small model-augmented prompting framework to enhance the accuracy and comprehensibility of ATs detection. Combining fine-tuned small models with In-Context Learning can also reduce fine-tuning costs while equipping the LLM with additional domain knowledge. Prmt4TD can leverage the remarkable processing and reasoning capabilities of LLMs to generate easily interpretable ATs detection results. Our evaluation results demonstrate that Prmt4TD achieves accuracy (\emph{F1-score}) improvement of 13\%-23\% on the ATs balanced dataset and enhances the comprehensibility of the detection results.

### Psy-Insight: Explainable Multi-turn Bilingual Dataset for Mental Health   Counseling
**Authors**: Keqi Chen, Zekai Sun, Yuhua Wen, Huijun Lian, Yingming Gao, Ya Li

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T15:44:21Z

**Summary**: The in-context learning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) show great potential in mental health support. However, the lack of counseling datasets, particularly in Chinese corpora, restricts their application in this field. To address this, we constructed Psy-Insight, the first mental health-oriented explainable multi-task bilingual dataset. We collected face-to-face multi-turn counseling dialogues, which are annotated with multi-task labels and conversation process explanations. Our annotations include psychotherapy, emotion, strategy, and topic labels, as well as turn-level reasoning and session-level guidance. Psy-Insight is not only suitable for tasks such as label recognition but also meets the need for training LLMs to act as empathetic counselors through logical reasoning. Experiments show that training LLMs on Psy-Insight enables the models to not only mimic the conversation style but also understand the underlying strategies and reasoning of counseling.

### Estimating predictability of depinning dynamics by machine learning
**Authors**: Valtteri Haavisto, Marcin Mińkowski, Lasse Laurson

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T15:39:01Z

**Summary**: Predicting the future behaviour of complex systems exhibiting critical-like dynamics is often considered to be an intrinsically hard task. Here, we study the predictability of the depinning dynamics of elastic interfaces in random media driven by a slowly increasing external force, a paradigmatic complex system exhibiting critical avalanche dynamics linked to a continuous non-equilibrium depinning phase transition. To this end, we train a variety of machine learning models to infer the mapping from features of the initial relaxed line shape and the random pinning landscape to predict the sample-dependent staircase-like force-displacement curve that emerges from the depinning process. Even if for a given realization of the quenched random medium the dynamics are in principle deterministic, we find that there is an exponential decay of the predictability with the displacement of the line as it nears the depinning transition from below. Our analysis on how the related displacement scale depends on the system size and the dimensionality of the input descriptor reveals that the onset of the depinning phase transition gives rise to fundamental limits to predictability.

### Feature-Level Insights into Artificial Text Detection with Sparse   Autoencoders
**Authors**: Kristian Kuznetsov, Laida Kushnareva, Polina Druzhinina, Anton Razzhigaev, Anastasia Voznyuk, Irina Piontkovskaya, Evgeny Burnaev, Serguei Barannikov

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T15:33:52Z

**Summary**: Artificial Text Detection (ATD) is becoming increasingly important with the rise of advanced Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite numerous efforts, no single algorithm performs consistently well across different types of unseen text or guarantees effective generalization to new LLMs. Interpretability plays a crucial role in achieving this goal. In this study, we enhance ATD interpretability by using Sparse Autoencoders (SAE) to extract features from Gemma-2-2b residual stream. We identify both interpretable and efficient features, analyzing their semantics and relevance through domain- and model-specific statistics, a steering approach, and manual or LLM-based interpretation. Our methods offer valuable insights into how texts from various models differ from human-written content. We show that modern LLMs have a distinct writing style, especially in information-dense domains, even though they can produce human-like outputs with personalized prompts.

### Small but Mighty: Enhancing Time Series Forecasting with Lightweight   LLMs
**Authors**: Haoran Fan, Bin Li, Yixuan Weng, Shoujun Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T15:27:36Z

**Summary**: While LLMs have demonstrated remarkable potential in time series forecasting, their practical deployment remains constrained by excessive computational demands and memory footprints. Existing LLM-based approaches typically suffer from three critical limitations: Inefficient parameter utilization in handling numerical time series patterns; Modality misalignment between continuous temporal signals and discrete text embeddings; and Inflexibility for real-time expert knowledge integration. We present SMETimes, the first systematic investigation of sub-3B parameter SLMs for efficient and accurate time series forecasting. Our approach centers on three key innovations: A statistically-enhanced prompting mechanism that bridges numerical time series with textual semantics through descriptive statistical features; A adaptive fusion embedding architecture that aligns temporal patterns with language model token spaces through learnable parameters; And a dynamic mixture-of-experts framework enabled by SLMs' computational efficiency, adaptively combining base predictions with domain-specific models. Extensive evaluations across seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that our 3B-parameter SLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on five primary datasets while maintaining 3.8x faster training and 5.2x lower memory consumption compared to 7B-parameter LLM baselines. Notably, the proposed model exhibits better learning capabilities, achieving 12.3% lower MSE than conventional LLM. Ablation studies validate that our statistical prompting and cross-modal fusion modules respectively contribute 15.7% and 18.2% error reduction in long-horizon forecasting tasks. By redefining the efficiency-accuracy trade-off landscape, this work establishes SLMs as viable alternatives to resource-intensive LLMs for practical time series forecasting. Code and models are available at https://github.com/xiyan1234567/SMETimes.

### English K_Quantization of LLMs Does Not Disproportionately Diminish   Multilingual Performance
**Authors**: Karl Audun Borgersen

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T15:26:59Z

**Summary**: For consumer usage of locally deployed LLMs, the GGUF format and k_quantization are invaluable tools for maintaining the performance of the original model while reducing it to sizes deployable with consumer-grade hardware. The number of bits dedicated to each weight from the original model is reduced based on how important they are thought to be during model inference. This importance is arrived at through the application of an 'importance matrix'-a relatively small text document meant to be representative of the LLM's standard use-cases. In the vast majority of quants available online, this document is primarily written in English. It was therefore an open question whether performance on English language tasks was preserved through the sacrifice of multilingual performance and whether it can be preserved with alternate importance matrices. This article investigates these hypotheses by quantizing Llama3.3 70B on importance matrices written in three languages (English, Norwegian, and Malayalam) and evaluating them on the MixEval dataset in both English and Norwegian. All experiments related to k_quantization yielded non-significant results (In all cases p > 0.237) indicating that current quantization practices do not disproportionately harm multilingual performance.

**Summary**: The research in AI-based formal mathematical reasoning has shown an unstoppable growth trend. These studies have excelled in mathematical competitions like IMO and have made significant progress. This paper focuses on formal verification, an immediate application scenario of formal reasoning, and breaks it down into sub-tasks. We constructed 18k high-quality instruction-response pairs across five formal specification languages (Coq, Lean4, Dafny, ACSL, and TLA+) by distilling gpt-4o and evaluated against ten open-sourced LLMs, including recent popular DeepSeek-R1. We also fine-tuned several 7~8B small models to achieve comparable performance with Deepseek-R1-671B. Interestingly, we observed that fine-tuning with formal data also enhances mathematics, reasoning, and coding capabilities. Fine-tuned models are released at https: //huggingface.co/fm-universe.

### Protecting multimodal large language models against misleading   visualizations
**Authors**: Jonathan Tonglet, Tinne Tuytelaars, Marie-Francine Moens, Iryna Gurevych

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T15:26:45Z

**Summary**: We assess the vulnerability of multimodal large language models to misleading visualizations - charts that distort the underlying data using techniques such as truncated or inverted axes, leading readers to draw inaccurate conclusions that may support misinformation or conspiracy theories. Our analysis shows that these distortions severely harm multimodal large language models, reducing their question-answering accuracy to the level of the random baseline. To mitigate this vulnerability, we introduce six inference-time methods to improve performance of MLLMs on misleading visualizations while preserving their accuracy on non-misleading ones. The most effective approach involves (1) extracting the underlying data table and (2) using a text-only large language model to answer questions based on the table. This method improves performance on misleading visualizations by 15.4 to 19.6 percentage points.

### PowerAttention: Exponentially Scaling of Receptive Fields for Effective   Sparse Attention
**Authors**: Lida Chen, Dong Xu, Chenxin An, Xintao Wang, Yikai Zhang, Jiangjie Chen, Zujie Liang, Feng Wei, Jiaqing Liang, Yanghua Xiao, Wei Wang

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T15:24:11Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) face efficiency bottlenecks due to the quadratic complexity of the attention mechanism when processing long contexts. Sparse attention methods offer a promising solution, but existing approaches often suffer from incomplete effective context and/or require complex implementation of pipeline. We present a comprehensive analysis of sparse attention for autoregressive LLMs from the respective of receptive field, recognize the suboptimal nature of existing methods for expanding the receptive field, and introduce PowerAttention, a novel sparse attention design that facilitates effective and complete context extension through the theoretical analysis. PowerAttention achieves exponential receptive field growth in $d$-layer LLMs, allowing each output token to attend to $2^d$ tokens, ensuring completeness and continuity of the receptive field. Experiments demonstrate that PowerAttention outperforms existing static sparse attention methods by $5\sim 40\%$, especially on tasks demanding long-range dependencies like Passkey Retrieval and RULER, while maintaining a comparable time complexity to sliding window attention. Efficiency evaluations further highlight PowerAttention's superior speedup in both prefilling and decoding phases compared with dynamic sparse attentions and full attention ($3.0\times$ faster on 128K context), making it a highly effective and user-friendly solution for processing long sequences in LLMs.

### Rewarding Doubt: A Reinforcement Learning Approach to Confidence   Calibration of Large Language Models

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T15:23:16Z

**Summary**: A safe and trustworthy use of Large Language Models (LLMs) requires an accurate expression of confidence in their answers. We introduce a novel Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach for LLM calibration that fine-tunes LLMs to elicit calibrated confidence estimations in their answers to factual questions. We model the problem as a betting game where the model predicts a confidence score together with every answer, and design a reward function that penalizes both over and under-confidence. We prove that under our reward design an optimal policy would result in a perfectly calibrated confidence estimation. Our experiments demonstrate significantly improved confidence calibration and generalization to new tasks without re-training, indicating that our approach teaches a general confidence awareness. This approach enables the training of inherently calibrated LLMs.

**Authors**: Vincent Freiberger, Arthur Fleig, Erik Buchmann

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T15:22:35Z

**Summary**: Protecting online privacy requires users to engage with and comprehend website privacy policies, but many policies are difficult and tedious to read. We present the first qualitative user study on Large Language Model (LLM)-driven privacy policy assessment. To this end, we build and evaluate an LLM-based privacy policy assessment browser extension, which helps users understand the essence of a lengthy, complex privacy policy while browsing. The tool integrates a dashboard and an LLM chat. In our qualitative user study (N=22), we evaluate usability, understandability of the information our tool provides, and its impacts on awareness. While providing a comprehensible quick overview and a chat for in-depth discussion improves privacy awareness, users note issues with building trust in the tool. From our insights, we derive important design implications to guide future policy analysis tools.

### Benchmarking LLMs and LLM-based Agents in Practical Vulnerability   Detection for Code Repositories
**Authors**: Alperen Yildiz, Sin G. Teo, Yiling Lou, Yebo Feng, Chong Wang, Dinil M. Divakaran

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T15:22:24Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in software vulnerability detection, particularly on function-level benchmarks like Devign and BigVul. However, real-world detection requires interprocedural analysis, as vulnerabilities often emerge through multi-hop function calls rather than isolated functions. While repository-level benchmarks like ReposVul and VulEval introduce interprocedural context, they remain computationally expensive, lack pairwise evaluation of vulnerability fixes, and explore limited context retrieval, limiting their practicality.   We introduce JitVul, a JIT vulnerability detection benchmark linking each function to its vulnerability-introducing and fixing commits. Built from 879 CVEs spanning 91 vulnerability types, JitVul enables comprehensive evaluation of detection capabilities. Our results show that ReAct Agents, leveraging thought-action-observation and interprocedural context, perform better than LLMs in distinguishing vulnerable from benign code. While prompting strategies like Chain-of-Thought help LLMs, ReAct Agents require further refinement. Both methods show inconsistencies, either misidentifying vulnerabilities or over-analyzing security guards, indicating significant room for improvement.

### A Generative System for Robot-to-Human Handovers: from Intent Inference   to Spatial Configuration Imagery
**Authors**: Hanxin Zhang, Abdulqader Dhafer, Zhou Daniel Hao, Hongbiao Dong

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T15:13:54Z

**Summary**: We propose a novel system for robot-to-human object handover that emulates human coworker interactions. Unlike most existing studies that focus primarily on grasping strategies and motion planning, our system focus on 1. inferring human handover intents, 2. imagining spatial handover configuration. The first one integrates multimodal perception-combining visual and verbal cues-to infer human intent. The second one using a diffusion-based model to generate the handover configuration, involving the spacial relationship among robot's gripper, the object, and the human hand, thereby mimicking the cognitive process of motor imagery. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach effectively interprets human cues and achieves fluent, human-like handovers, offering a promising solution for collaborative robotics. Code, videos, and data are available at: https://i3handover.github.io.

### Causal language jumps in clinical practice guidelines for diabetes   management
**Authors**: Keling Wang, Chang Wei, Jeremy A. Labrecque

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T14:45:08Z

**Summary**: Clinical practice guidelines are designed to guide clinical practice and involve causal language. Sometimes guidelines make or require stronger causal claims than those in the references they rely on, a phenomenon we refer to as 'causal language jump'. We evaluated the strength of expressed causation in diabetes guidelines and the evidence they reference to assess the pattern of jumps. We randomly sampled 300 guideline statements from four diabetes guidelines. We rated the causation strength in the statements and the dependence on causation in recommendations supported by these statements using existing scales. Among the causal statements, the cited original studies were similarly assessed. We also assessed how well they report target trial emulation (TTE) components as a proxy for reliability. Of the sampled statements, 114 (38.0%) were causal, and 76 (66.7%) expressed strong causation. 27.2% (31/114) of causal guideline statements demonstrated a "causal language jump", and 34.9% (29/83) of guideline recommendations cannot be effectively supported. Of the 53 eligible studies for TTE rating, most did not report treatment assignment and causal contrast in detail. Our findings suggest causal language jumps were common among diabetes guidelines. While these jumps are sometimes inevitable, they should always be supported by good causal inference practices.

### Survey Respondent Surrogates? Probing Objective and Subjective Silicon   Population
**Authors**: Muzhi Zhou, Lu Yu, Xiaomin Geng, Lan Luo

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T14:44:53Z

**Summary**: Recent discussions about Large Language Models (LLMs) indicate that they have the potential to simulate human responses in social surveys and generate reliable predictions, such as those found in political polls. However, the existing findings are highly inconsistent, leaving us uncertain about the population characteristics of data generated by LLMs. In this paper, we employ repeated random sampling to create sampling distributions that identify the population parameters of silicon samples generated by GPT. Our findings show that GPT's demographic distribution aligns with the 2020 U.S. population in terms of gender and average age. However, GPT significantly overestimates the representation of the Black population and individuals with higher levels of education, even when it possesses accurate knowledge. Furthermore, GPT's point estimates for attitudinal scores are highly inconsistent and show no clear inclination toward any particular ideology. The sample response distributions exhibit a normal pattern that diverges significantly from those of human respondents. Consistent with previous studies, we find that GPT's answers are more deterministic than those of humans. We conclude by discussing the concerning implications of this biased and deterministic silicon population for making inferences about real-world populations.

**Summary**: Object affordance reasoning, the ability to infer object functionalities based on physical properties, is fundamental for task-oriented planning and activities in both humans and Artificial Intelligence (AI). This capability, required for planning and executing daily activities in a task-oriented manner, relies on commonsense knowledge of object physics and functionalities, extending beyond simple object recognition. Current computational models for affordance reasoning from perception lack generalizability, limiting their applicability in novel scenarios. Meanwhile, comprehensive Large Language Models (LLMs) with emerging reasoning capabilities are challenging to deploy on local devices for task-oriented manipulations. Here, we introduce LVIS-Aff, a large-scale dataset comprising 1,496 tasks and 119k images, designed to enhance the generalizability of affordance reasoning from perception. Utilizing this dataset, we develop Afford-X, an end-to-end trainable affordance reasoning model that incorporates Verb Attention and Bi-Fusion modules to improve multi-modal understanding. This model achieves up to a 12.1% performance improvement over the best-reported results from non-LLM methods, while also demonstrating a 1.2% enhancement compared to our previous conference paper. Additionally, it maintains a compact 187M parameter size and infers nearly 50 times faster than the GPT-4V API. Our work demonstrates the potential for efficient, generalizable affordance reasoning models that can be deployed on local devices for task-oriented manipulations. We showcase Afford-X's effectiveness in enabling task-oriented manipulations for robots across various tasks and environments, underscoring its efficiency and broad implications for advancing robotics and AI systems in real-world applications.

### VideoWorld: Exploring Knowledge Learning from Unlabeled Videos
**Authors**: Zhongwei Ren, Yunchao Wei, Xun Guo, Yao Zhao, Bingyi Kang, Jiashi Feng, Xiaojie Jin

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T14:44:18Z

**Summary**: This work explores whether a deep generative model can learn complex knowledge solely from visual input, in contrast to the prevalent focus on text-based models like large language models (LLMs). We develop VideoWorld, an auto-regressive video generation model trained on unlabeled video data, and test its knowledge acquisition abilities in video-based Go and robotic control tasks. Our experiments reveal two key findings: (1) video-only training provides sufficient information for learning knowledge, including rules, reasoning and planning capabilities, and (2) the representation of visual change is crucial for knowledge acquisition. To improve both the efficiency and efficacy of this process, we introduce the Latent Dynamics Model (LDM) as a key component of VideoWorld. Remarkably, VideoWorld reaches a 5-dan professional level in the Video-GoBench with just a 300-million-parameter model, without relying on search algorithms or reward mechanisms typical in reinforcement learning. In robotic tasks, VideoWorld effectively learns diverse control operations and generalizes across environments, approaching the performance of oracle models in CALVIN and RLBench. This study opens new avenues for knowledge acquisition from visual data, with all code, data, and models open-sourced for further research.

**Authors**: Shi Lin, Hongming Yang, Dingyang Lin, Rongchang Li, Xun Wang, Changting Lin, Wenpeng Xing, Meng Han

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T14:43:33Z

**Summary**: The rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has brought significant advancements across various tasks. However, despite these achievements, LLMs still exhibit inherent safety vulnerabilities, especially when confronted with jailbreak attacks. Existing jailbreak methods suffer from two main limitations: reliance on complicated prompt engineering and iterative optimization, which lead to low attack success rate (ASR) and attack efficiency (AE). In this work, we propose an efficient jailbreak attack method, Analyzing-based Jailbreak (ABJ), which leverages the advanced reasoning capability of LLMs to autonomously generate harmful content, revealing their underlying safety vulnerabilities during complex reasoning process. We conduct comprehensive experiments on ABJ across various open-source and closed-source LLMs. In particular, ABJ achieves high ASR (82.1% on GPT-4o-2024-11-20) with exceptional AE among all target LLMs, showcasing its remarkable attack effectiveness, transferability, and efficiency. Our findings underscore the urgent need to prioritize and improve the safety of LLMs to mitigate the risks of misuse.

### Online Scheduling for LLM Inference with KV Cache Constraints
**Authors**: Patrick Jaillet, Jiashuo Jiang, Chara Podimata, Zijie Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T14:43:01Z

**Summary**: Large Language Model (LLM) inference, where a trained model generates text one word at a time in response to user prompts, is a computationally intensive process requiring efficient scheduling to optimize latency and resource utilization. A key challenge in LLM inference is the management of the Key-Value (KV) cache, which reduces redundant computations but introduces memory constraints. In this work, we model LLM inference with KV cache constraints theoretically and propose novel batching and scheduling algorithms that minimize inference latency while effectively managing the KV cache's memory.   We analyze both semi-online and fully online scheduling models, and our results are threefold. First, we provide a polynomial-time algorithm that achieves exact optimality in terms of average latency in the semi-online prompt arrival model. Second, in the fully online case with a stochastic prompt arrival, we introduce an efficient online scheduling algorithm with constant regret. Third, we prove that no algorithm (deterministic or randomized) can achieve a constant competitive ratio in fully online adversarial settings. Our empirical evaluations on a public LLM inference dataset, using the Llama-70B model on A100 GPUs, show that our approach significantly outperforms benchmark algorithms used currently in practice, achieving lower latency while reducing energy consumption. Overall, our results offer a path toward more sustainable and cost-effective LLM deployment.

**Authors**: Alberto Purpura, Sahil Wadhwa, Jesse Zymet, Akshay Gupta, Andy Luo, Melissa Kazemi Rad, Swapnil Shinde, Mohammad Shahed Sorower

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T14:41:38Z

**Summary**: The rapid growth of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents significant privacy, security, and ethical concerns. While much research has proposed methods for defending LLM systems against misuse by malicious actors, researchers have recently complemented these efforts with an offensive approach that involves red teaming, i.e., proactively attacking LLMs with the purpose of identifying their vulnerabilities. This paper provides a concise and practical overview of the LLM red teaming literature, structured so as to describe a multi-component system end-to-end. To motivate red teaming we survey the initial safety needs of some high-profile LLMs, and then dive into the different components of a red teaming system as well as software packages for implementing them. We cover various attack methods, strategies for attack-success evaluation, metrics for assessing experiment outcomes, as well as a host of other considerations. Our survey will be useful for any reader who wants to rapidly obtain a grasp of the major red teaming concepts for their own use in practical applications.

### RIDE: Enhancing Large Language Model Alignment through Restyled   In-Context Learning Demonstration Exemplars
**Authors**: Yuncheng Hua, Lizhen Qu, Zhuang Li, Hao Xue, Flora D. Salim, Gholamreza Haffari

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T14:38:19Z

**Summary**: Alignment tuning is crucial for ensuring large language models (LLMs) behave ethically and helpfully. Current alignment approaches require high-quality annotations and significant training resources. This paper proposes a low-cost, tuning-free method using in-context learning (ICL) to enhance LLM alignment. Through an analysis of high-quality ICL demos, we identified style as a key factor influencing LLM alignment capabilities and explicitly restyled ICL exemplars based on this stylistic framework. Additionally, we combined the restyled demos to achieve a balance between the two conflicting aspects of LLM alignment--factuality and safety. We packaged the restyled examples as prompts to trigger few-shot learning, improving LLM alignment. Compared to the best baseline approach, with an average score of 5.00 as the maximum, our method achieves a maximum 0.10 increase on the Alpaca task (from 4.50 to 4.60), a 0.22 enhancement on the Just-eval benchmark (from 4.34 to 4.56), and a maximum improvement of 0.32 (from 3.53 to 3.85) on the MT-Bench dataset. We release the code and data at https://github.com/AnonymousCode-ComputerScience/RIDE.

### Human-Agent Interaction in Synthetic Social Networks: A Framework for   Studying Online Polarization
**Authors**: Tim Donkers, Jürgen Ziegler

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T14:35:51Z

**Summary**: Online social networks have dramatically altered the landscape of public discourse, creating both opportunities for enhanced civic participation and risks of deepening social divisions. Prevalent approaches to studying online polarization have been limited by a methodological disconnect: mathematical models excel at formal analysis but lack linguistic realism, while language model-based simulations capture natural discourse but often sacrifice analytical precision. This paper introduces an innovative computational framework that synthesizes these approaches by embedding formal opinion dynamics principles within LLM-based artificial agents, enabling both rigorous mathematical analysis and naturalistic social interactions. We validate our framework through comprehensive offline testing and experimental evaluation with 122 human participants engaging in a controlled social network environment. The results demonstrate our ability to systematically investigate polarization mechanisms while preserving ecological validity. Our findings reveal how polarized environments shape user perceptions and behavior: participants exposed to polarized discussions showed markedly increased sensitivity to emotional content and group affiliations, while perceiving reduced uncertainty in the agents' positions. By combining mathematical precision with natural language capabilities, our framework opens new avenues for investigating social media phenomena through controlled experimentation. This methodological advancement allows researchers to bridge the gap between theoretical models and empirical observations, offering unprecedented opportunities to study the causal mechanisms underlying online opinion dynamics.

### LDPM: Towards undersampled MRI reconstruction with MR-VAE and Latent   Diffusion Prior
**Authors**: Xingjian Tang, Jingwei Guan, Linge Li, Ran Shi, Youmei Zhang, Mengye Lyu, Li Yan

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T14:16:27Z

**Summary**: Diffusion models, as powerful generative models, have found a wide range of applications and shown great potential in solving image reconstruction problems. Some works attempted to solve MRI reconstruction with diffusion models, but these methods operate directly in pixel space, leading to higher computational costs for optimization and inference. Latent diffusion models, pre-trained on natural images with rich visual priors, are expected to solve the high computational cost problem in MRI reconstruction by operating in a lower-dimensional latent space. However, direct application to MRI reconstruction faces three key challenges: (1) absence of explicit control mechanisms for medical fidelity, (2) domain gap between natural images and MR physics, and (3) undefined data consistency in latent space. To address these challenges, a novel Latent Diffusion Prior-based undersampled MRI reconstruction (LDPM) method is proposed. Our LDPM framework addresses these challenges by: (1) a sketch-guided pipeline with a two-step reconstruction strategy, which balances perceptual quality and anatomical fidelity, (2) an MRI-optimized VAE (MR-VAE), which achieves an improvement of approximately 3.92 dB in PSNR for undersampled MRI reconstruction compared to that with SD-VAE \cite{sd}, and (3) Dual-Stage Sampler, a modified version of spaced DDPM sampler, which enforces high-fidelity reconstruction in the latent space. Experiments on the fastMRI dataset\cite{fastmri} demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed method and its robustness across various scenarios. The effectiveness of each module is also verified through ablation experiments.

### Inference for Heterogeneous Treatment Effects with Efficient Instruments   and Machine Learning
**Authors**: Cyrill Scheidegger, Zijian Guo, Peter Bühlmann

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T14:11:25Z

**Summary**: We introduce a new instrumental variable (IV) estimator for heterogeneous treatment effects in the presence of endogeneity. Our estimator is based on double/debiased machine learning (DML) and uses efficient machine learning instruments (MLIV) and kernel smoothing. We prove consistency and asymptotic normality of our estimator and also construct confidence sets that are more robust towards weak IV. Along the way, we also provide an accessible discussion of the corresponding estimator for the homogeneous treatment effect with efficient machine learning instruments. The methods are evaluated on synthetic and real datasets and an implementation is made available in the R package IVDML.

### From Sparse Dependence to Sparse Attention: Unveiling How   Chain-of-Thought Enhances Transformer Sample Efficiency
**Authors**: Kaiyue Wen, Huaqing Zhang, Hongzhou Lin, Jingzhao Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T13:57:56Z

**Summary**: Chain-of-thought (CoT) significantly enhances the reasoning performance of large language models (LLM). While current theoretical studies often attribute this improvement to increased expressiveness and computational capacity, we argue that expressiveness is not the primary limitation in the LLM regime, as current large models will fail on simple tasks. Using a parity-learning setup, we demonstrate that CoT can substantially improve sample efficiency even when the representation power is sufficient. Specifically, with CoT, a transformer can learn the function within polynomial samples, whereas without CoT, the required sample size is exponential. Additionally, we show that CoT simplifies the learning process by introducing sparse sequential dependencies among input tokens, and leads to a sparse and interpretable attention. We validate our theoretical analysis with both synthetic and real-world experiments, confirming that sparsity in attention layers is a key factor of the improvement induced by CoT.

### Learn from the Past: Language-conditioned Object Rearrangement with   Large Language Models
**Authors**: Guanqun Cao, Ryan Mckenna, Erich Graf, John Oyekan

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T13:54:04Z

**Summary**: Object manipulation for rearrangement into a specific goal state is a significant task for collaborative robots. Accurately determining object placement is a key challenge, as misalignment can increase task complexity and the risk of collisions, affecting the efficiency of the rearrangement process. Most current methods heavily rely on pre-collected datasets to train the model for predicting the goal position. As a result, these methods are restricted to specific instructions, which limits their broader applicability and generalisation. In this paper, we propose a framework of flexible language-conditioned object rearrangement based on the Large Language Model (LLM). Our approach mimics human reasoning by making use of successful past experiences as a reference to infer the best strategies to achieve a current desired goal position. Based on LLM's strong natural language comprehension and inference ability, our method generalises to handle various everyday objects and free-form language instructions in a zero-shot manner. Experimental results demonstrate that our methods can effectively execute the robotic rearrangement tasks, even those involving long sequences of orders.

### Parallelized Planning-Acting for Efficient LLM-based Multi-Agent Systems
**Authors**: Yaoru Li, Shunyu Liu, Tongya Zheng, Mingli Song

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T13:53:10Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in Large Language Model(LLM)-based Multi-Agent Systems(MAS) have demonstrated remarkable potential for tackling complex decision-making tasks. However, existing frameworks inevitably rely on serialized execution paradigms, where agents must complete sequential LLM planning before taking action. This fundamental constraint severely limits real-time responsiveness and adaptation, which is crucial in dynamic environments with ever-changing scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel parallelized planning-acting framework for LLM-based MAS, featuring a dual-thread architecture with interruptible execution to enable concurrent planning and acting. Specifically, our framework comprises two core threads:(1) a planning thread driven by a centralized memory system, maintaining synchronization of environmental states and agent communication to support dynamic decision-making; and (2) an acting thread equipped with a comprehensive skill library, enabling automated task execution through recursive decomposition. Extensive experiments on challenging Minecraft demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

### Collaborative Expert LLMs Guided Multi-Objective Molecular Optimization
**Authors**: Jiajun Yu, Yizhen Zheng, Huan Yee Koh, Shirui Pan, Tianyue Wang, Haishuai Wang

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T13:47:55Z

**Summary**: Molecular optimization is a crucial yet complex and time-intensive process that often acts as a bottleneck for drug development. Traditional methods rely heavily on trial and error, making multi-objective optimization both time-consuming and resource-intensive. Current AI-based methods have shown limited success in handling multi-objective optimization tasks, hampering their practical utilization. To address this challenge, we present MultiMol, a collaborative large language model (LLM) system designed to guide multi-objective molecular optimization. MultiMol comprises two agents, including a data-driven worker agent and a literature-guided research agent. The data-driven worker agent is a large language model being fine-tuned to learn how to generate optimized molecules considering multiple objectives, while the literature-guided research agent is responsible for searching task-related literature to find useful prior knowledge that facilitates identifying the most promising optimized candidates. In evaluations across six multi-objective optimization tasks, MultiMol significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving a 82.30% success rate, in sharp contrast to the 27.50% success rate of current strongest methods. To further validate its practical impact, we tested MultiMol on two real-world challenges. First, we enhanced the selectivity of Xanthine Amine Congener (XAC), a promiscuous ligand that binds both A1R and A2AR, successfully biasing it towards A1R. Second, we improved the bioavailability of Saquinavir, an HIV-1 protease inhibitor with known bioavailability limitations. Overall, these results indicate that MultiMol represents a highly promising approach for multi-objective molecular optimization, holding great potential to accelerate the drug development process and contribute to the advancement of pharmaceutical research.

### CURVALID: Geometrically-guided Adversarial Prompt Detection
**Authors**: Canaan Yung, Hanxun Huang, Sarah Monazam Erfani, Christopher Leckie

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T13:47:53Z

**Summary**: Adversarial prompts capable of jailbreaking large language models (LLMs) and inducing undesirable behaviours pose a significant obstacle to their safe deployment. Current mitigation strategies rely on activating built-in defence mechanisms or fine-tuning the LLMs, but the fundamental distinctions between adversarial and benign prompts are yet to be understood. In this work, we introduce CurvaLID, a novel defense framework that efficiently detects adversarial prompts by leveraging their geometric properties. It is agnostic to the type of LLM, offering a unified detection framework across diverse adversarial prompts and LLM architectures. CurvaLID builds on the geometric analysis of text prompts to uncover their underlying differences. We theoretically extend the concept of curvature via the Whewell equation into an $n$-dimensional word embedding space, enabling us to quantify local geometric properties, including semantic shifts and curvature in the underlying manifolds. Additionally, we employ Local Intrinsic Dimensionality (LID) to capture geometric features of text prompts within adversarial subspaces. Our findings reveal that adversarial prompts differ fundamentally from benign prompts in terms of their geometric characteristics. Our results demonstrate that CurvaLID delivers superior detection and rejection of adversarial queries, paving the way for safer LLM deployment.

### Enhancing Non-English Capabilities of English-Centric Large Language   Models through Deep Supervision Fine-Tuning
**Authors**: Wenshuai Huo, Xiaocheng Feng, Yichong Huang, Chengpeng Fu, Baohang Li, Yangfan Ye, Zhirui Zhang, Dandan Tu, Duyu Tang, Yunfei Lu, Hui Wang, Bing Qin

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T13:10:07Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant progress in multilingual language understanding and generation. However, due to the imbalance in training data, their capabilities in non-English languages are limited. Recent studies revealed the English-pivot multilingual mechanism of LLMs, where LLMs implicitly convert non-English queries into English ones at the bottom layers and adopt English for thinking at the middle layers. However, due to the absence of explicit supervision for cross-lingual alignment in the intermediate layers of LLMs, the internal representations during these stages may become inaccurate. In this work, we introduce a deep supervision fine-tuning method (DFT) that incorporates additional supervision in the internal layers of the model to guide its workflow. Specifically, we introduce two training objectives on different layers of LLMs: one at the bottom layers to constrain the conversion of the target language into English, and another at the middle layers to constrain reasoning in English. To effectively achieve the guiding purpose, we designed two types of supervision signals: logits and feature, which represent a stricter constraint and a relatively more relaxed guidance. Our method guides the model to not only consider the final generated result when processing non-English inputs but also ensure the accuracy of internal representations. We conducted extensive experiments on typical English-centric large models, LLaMA-2 and Gemma-2, and the results on multiple multilingual datasets show that our method significantly outperforms traditional fine-tuning methods.

### Open-Source Large Language Models as Multilingual Crowdworkers:   Synthesizing Open-Domain Dialogues in Several Languages With No Examples in   Targets and No Machine Translation
**Authors**: Ahmed Njifenjou, Virgile Sucal, Bassam Jabaian, Fabrice Lefèvre

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T12:52:14Z

**Summary**: The prevailing paradigm in the domain of Open-Domain Dialogue agents predominantly focuses on the English language, encompassing both models and datasets. Furthermore, the financial and temporal investments required for crowdsourcing such datasets for finetuning are substantial, particularly when multiple languages are involved. Fortunately, advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have unveiled a plethora of possibilities across diverse tasks. Specifically, instruction-tuning has enabled LLMs to execute tasks based on natural language instructions, occasionally surpassing the performance of human crowdworkers. Additionally, these models possess the capability to function in various languages within a single thread. Consequently, to generate new samples in different languages, we propose leveraging these capabilities to replicate the data collection process. We introduce a pipeline for generating Open-Domain Dialogue data in multiple Target Languages using LLMs, with demonstrations provided in a unique Source Language. By eschewing explicit Machine Translation in this approach, we enhance the adherence to language-specific nuances. We apply this methodology to the PersonaChat dataset. To enhance the openness of generated dialogues and mimic real life scenarii, we added the notion of speech events corresponding to the type of conversation the speakers are involved in and also that of common ground which represents the premises of a conversation.

### Visualising Policy-Reward Interplay to Inform Zeroth-Order Preference   Optimisation of Large Language Models
**Authors**: Alessio Galatolo, Zhenbang Dai, Katie Winkle, Meriem Beloucif

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T12:49:48Z

**Summary**: Fine-tuning LLMs with first-order methods like back-propagation is computationally intensive. Zeroth-Order (ZO) optimisation, using function evaluations instead of gradients, reduces memory usage but suffers from slow convergence in high-dimensional models. As a result, ZO research in LLMs has mostly focused on classification, overlooking more complex generative tasks. In this paper, we introduce ZOPrO, a novel ZO algorithm designed for \textit{Preference Optimisation} in LLMs. We begin by analysing the interplay between policy and reward models during traditional (first-order) Preference Optimisation, uncovering patterns in their relative updates. Guided by these insights, we adapt Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA) with a targeted sampling strategy to accelerate convergence. Through experiments on summarisation, machine translation, and conversational assistants, we demonstrate that our method consistently enhances reward signals while achieving convergence times comparable to first-order methods. While it falls short of some state-of-the-art methods, our work is the first to apply Zeroth-Order methods to Preference Optimisation in LLMs, going beyond classification tasks and paving the way for a largely unexplored research direction. Code and visualisations are available at https://github.com/alessioGalatolo/VisZOPrO

### Unified Mind Model: Reimagining Autonomous Agents in the LLM Era
**Authors**: Pengbo Hu, Xiang Ying

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T12:49:44Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable capabilities across domains, tasks, and languages (e.g., ChatGPT and GPT-4), reviving the research of general autonomous agents with human-like cognitive abilities.Such human-level agents require semantic comprehension and instruction-following capabilities, which exactly fall into the strengths of LLMs.Although there have been several initial attempts to build human-level agents based on LLMs, the theoretical foundation remains a challenging open problem. In this paper, we propose a novel theoretical cognitive architecture, the Unified Mind Model (UMM), which offers guidance to facilitate the rapid creation of autonomous agents with human-level cognitive abilities. Specifically, our UMM starts with the global workspace theory and further leverage LLMs to enable the agent with various cognitive abilities, such as multi-modal perception, planning, reasoning, tool use, learning, memory, reflection and motivation. Building upon UMM, we then develop an agent-building engine, MindOS, which allows users to quickly create domain-/task-specific autonomous agents without any programming effort.

### Taxation Perspectives from Large Language Models: A Case Study on   Additional Tax Penalties
**Authors**: Eunkyung Choi, Young Jin Suh, Hun Park, Wonseok Hwang

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T12:24:20Z

**Summary**: How capable are large language models (LLMs) in the domain of taxation? Although numerous studies have explored the legal domain in general, research dedicated to taxation remain scarce. Moreover, the datasets used in these studies are either simplified, failing to reflect the real-world complexities, or unavailable as open source. To address this gap, we introduce PLAT, a new benchmark designed to assess the ability of LLMs to predict the legitimacy of additional tax penalties. PLAT is constructed to evaluate LLMs' understanding of tax law, particularly in cases where resolving the issue requires more than just applying related statutes. Our experiments with six LLMs reveal that their baseline capabilities are limited, especially when dealing with conflicting issues that demand a comprehensive understanding. However, we found that enabling retrieval, self-reasoning, and discussion among multiple agents with specific role assignments, this limitation can be mitigated.

### A Survey on LLM Test-Time Compute via Search: Tasks, LLM Profiling,   Search Algorithms, and Relevant Frameworks
**Authors**: Xinzhe Li

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T12:22:23Z

**Summary**: LLM test-time compute (or LLM inference) via search has emerged as a promising research area with rapid developments. However, current frameworks often adopt distinct perspectives on three key aspects (task definition, LLM profiling, and search procedures), making direct comparisons challenging. Moreover, the search algorithms employed often diverge from standard implementations, and their specific characteristics are not thoroughly specified. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive technical review that unifies task definitions and provides modular definitions of LLM profiling and search procedures. The definitions enable precise comparisons of various LLM inference frameworks while highlighting their departures from conventional search algorithms. We also discuss the applicability, performance, and efficiency of these methods. We have updated our content to include the latest papers, and the differences between versions are highlighted in the appendix.

### Generative Diffusion Models for High Dimensional Channel Estimation
**Authors**: Xingyu Zhou, Le Liang, Jing Zhang, Peiwen Jiang, Yong Li, Shi Jin

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T12:18:57Z

**Summary**: Along with the prosperity of generative artificial intelligence (AI), its potential for solving conventional challenges in wireless communications has also surfaced. Inspired by this trend, we investigate the application of the advanced diffusion models (DMs), a representative class of generative AI models, to high dimensional wireless channel estimation. By capturing the structure of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless channels via a deep generative prior encoded by DMs, we develop a novel posterior inference method for channel reconstruction. We further adapt the proposed method to recover channel information from low-resolution quantized measurements. Additionally, to enhance the over-the-air viability, we integrate the DM with the unsupervised Stein's unbiased risk estimator to enable learning from noisy observations and circumvent the requirements for ground truth channel data that is hardly available in practice. Results reveal that the proposed estimator achieves high-fidelity channel recovery while reducing estimation latency by a factor of 10 compared to state-of-the-art schemes, facilitating real-time implementation. Moreover, our method outperforms existing estimators while reducing the pilot overhead by half, showcasing its scalability to ultra-massive antenna arrays.

### JamMa: Ultra-lightweight Local Feature Matching with Joint Mamba
**Authors**: Xiaoyong Lu, Songlin Du

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T12:12:51Z

**Summary**: Existing state-of-the-art feature matchers capture long-range dependencies with Transformers but are hindered by high spatial complexity, leading to demanding training and highlatency inference. Striking a better balance between performance and efficiency remains a challenge in feature matching. Inspired by the linear complexity O(N) of Mamba, we propose an ultra-lightweight Mamba-based matcher, named JamMa, which converges on a single GPU and achieves an impressive performance-efficiency balance in inference. To unlock the potential of Mamba for feature matching, we propose Joint Mamba with a scan-merge strategy named JEGO, which enables: (1) Joint scan of two images to achieve high-frequency mutual interaction, (2) Efficient scan with skip steps to reduce sequence length, (3) Global receptive field, and (4) Omnidirectional feature representation. With the above properties, the JEGO strategy significantly outperforms the scan-merge strategies proposed in VMamba and EVMamba in the feature matching task. Compared to attention-based sparse and semi-dense matchers, JamMa demonstrates a superior balance between performance and efficiency, delivering better performance with less than 50% of the parameters and FLOPs.

### Beyond Content Relevance: Evaluating Instruction Following in Retrieval   Models
**Authors**: Jianqun Zhou, Yuanlei Zheng, Wei Chen, Qianqian Zheng, Hui Su, Wei Zhang, Rui Meng, Xiaoyu Shen

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T12:10:57Z

**Summary**: Instruction-following capabilities in LLMs have progressed significantly, enabling more complex user interactions through detailed prompts. However, retrieval systems have not matched these advances, most of them still relies on traditional lexical and semantic matching techniques that fail to fully capture user intent. Recent efforts have introduced instruction-aware retrieval models, but these primarily focus on intrinsic content relevance, which neglects the importance of customized preferences for broader document-level attributes. This study evaluates the instruction-following capabilities of various retrieval models beyond content relevance, including LLM-based dense retrieval and reranking models. We develop InfoSearch, a novel retrieval evaluation benchmark spanning six document-level attributes: Audience, Keyword, Format, Language, Length, and Source, and introduce novel metrics -- Strict Instruction Compliance Ratio (SICR) and Weighted Instruction Sensitivity Evaluation (WISE) to accurately assess the models' responsiveness to instructions. Our findings indicate that although fine-tuning models on instruction-aware retrieval datasets and increasing model size enhance performance, most models still fall short of instruction compliance.

### RASD: Retrieval-Augmented Speculative Decoding
**Authors**: Guofeng Quan, Wenfeng Feng, Chuzhan Hao, Guochao Jiang, Yuewei Zhang, Hao Wang

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T12:10:14Z

**Summary**: Speculative decoding accelerates inference in large language models (LLMs) by generating draft tokens for target model verification. Current approaches for obtaining draft tokens rely on lightweight draft models or additional model structures to generate draft tokens and retrieve context from databases. Due to the draft model's small size and limited training data, model-based speculative decoding frequently becomes less effective in out-of-domain scenarios. Additionally, the time cost of the drafting phase results in a low upper limit on acceptance length during the verification step, limiting overall efficiency. This paper proposes RASD (Retrieval-Augmented Speculative Decoding), which adopts retrieval methods to enhance model-based speculative decoding. We introduce tree pruning and tree fusion to achieve this. Specifically, we develop a pruning method based on the draft model's probability distribution to construct the optimal retrieval tree. Second, we employ the longest prefix matching algorithm to merge the tree generated by the draft model with the retrieval tree, resulting in a unified tree for verification. Experimental results demonstrate that RASD achieves state-of-the-art inference acceleration across tasks such as DocQA, Summary, Code, and In-Domain QA. Moreover, RASD exhibits strong scalability, seamlessly integrating with various speculative decoding approaches, including both generation-based and retrieval-based methods.

### Cheap Subsampling bootstrap confidence intervals for fast and robust   inference
**Authors**: Johan Sebastian Ohlendorff, Anders Munch, Kathrine Kold Sørensen, Thomas Alexander Gerds

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T12:08:50Z

**Summary**: Bootstrapping is often applied to get confidence limits for semiparametric inference of a target parameter in the presence of nuisance parameters. Bootstrapping with replacement can be computationally expensive and problematic when cross-validation is used in the estimation algorithm due to duplicate observations in the bootstrap samples. We provide a valid, fast, easy-to-implement subsampling bootstrap method for constructing confidence intervals for asymptotically linear estimators and discuss its application to semiparametric causal inference. Our method, inspired by the Cheap Bootstrap (Lam, 2022), leverages the quantiles of a t-distribution and has the desired coverage with few bootstrap replications. We show that the method is asymptotically valid if the subsample size is chosen appropriately as a function of the sample size. We illustrate our method with data from the LEADER trial (Marso et al., 2016), obtaining confidence intervals for a longitudinal targeted minimum loss-based estimator (van der Laan and Gruber, 2012). Through a series of empirical experiments, we also explore the impact of subsample size, sample size, and the number of bootstrap repetitions on the performance of the confidence interval.

### LADDER: Self-Improving LLMs Through Recursive Problem Decomposition
**Authors**: Toby Simonds, Akira Yoshiyama

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T11:50:24Z

**Summary**: We introduce LADDER (Learning through Autonomous Difficulty-Driven Example Recursion), a framework which enables Large Language Models to autonomously improve their problem-solving capabilities through self-guided learning by recursively generating and solving progressively simpler variants of complex problems. Unlike prior approaches that require curated datasets or human feedback, LADDER leverages a model's own capabilities to generate easier question variants. We demonstrate LADDER's effectiveness in the subject of mathematical integration, improving Llama 3.2 3B's accuracy from 1% to 82% on undergraduate-level problems and enabling Qwen2.5 7B Deepseek-R1 Distilled to achieve 73% on the MIT Integration Bee qualifying examination. We also introduce TTRL (Test-Time Reinforcement Learning), where we perform reinforcement learning on variants of test problems at inference time. TTRL enables Qwen2.5 7B Deepseek-R1 Distilled to achieve a state-of-the-art score of 90% on the MIT Integration Bee qualifying examination, surpassing OpenAI o1's performance. These results show how self-directed strategic learning can achieve significant capability improvements without relying on architectural scaling or human supervision.

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T11:49:36Z

**Summary**: The rise of LLMs has deflected a growing portion of human-computer interactions towards LLM-based chatbots. The remarkable abilities of these models allow users to interact using long, diverse natural language text covering a wide range of topics and styles. Phrasing these messages is a time and effort consuming task, calling for an autocomplete solution to assist users. We introduce the task of chatbot interaction autocomplete. We present ChaI-TeA: CHat InTEraction Autocomplete; An autcomplete evaluation framework for LLM-based chatbot interactions. The framework includes a formal definition of the task, coupled with suitable datasets and metrics. We use the framework to evaluate After formally defining the task along with suitable datasets and metrics, we test 9 models on the defined auto completion task, finding that while current off-the-shelf models perform fairly, there is still much room for improvement, mainly in ranking of the generated suggestions. We provide insights for practitioners working on this task and open new research directions for researchers in the field. We release our framework to serve as a foundation for future research.

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T11:48:15Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in video generation have significantly impacted daily life for both individuals and industries. However, the leading video generation models remain closed-source, resulting in a notable performance gap between industry capabilities and those available to the public. In this report, we introduce HunyuanVideo, an innovative open-source video foundation model that demonstrates performance in video generation comparable to, or even surpassing, that of leading closed-source models. HunyuanVideo encompasses a comprehensive framework that integrates several key elements, including data curation, advanced architectural design, progressive model scaling and training, and an efficient infrastructure tailored for large-scale model training and inference. As a result, we successfully trained a video generative model with over 13 billion parameters, making it the largest among all open-source models. We conducted extensive experiments and implemented a series of targeted designs to ensure high visual quality, motion dynamics, text-video alignment, and advanced filming techniques. According to evaluations by professionals, HunyuanVideo outperforms previous state-of-the-art models, including Runway Gen-3, Luma 1.6, and three top-performing Chinese video generative models. By releasing the code for the foundation model and its applications, we aim to bridge the gap between closed-source and open-source communities. This initiative will empower individuals within the community to experiment with their ideas, fostering a more dynamic and vibrant video generation ecosystem. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/Tencent/HunyuanVideo.

### When Claims Evolve: Evaluating and Enhancing the Robustness of Embedding   Models Against Misinformation Edits
**Authors**: Jabez Magomere, Emanuele La Malfa, Manuel Tonneau, Ashkan Kazemi, Scott Hale

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T11:47:32Z

**Summary**: Online misinformation remains a critical challenge, and fact-checkers increasingly rely on embedding-based methods to retrieve relevant fact-checks. Yet, when debunked claims reappear in edited forms, the performance of these methods is unclear. In this work, we introduce a taxonomy of six common real-world misinformation edits and propose a perturbation framework that generates valid, natural claim variations. Our multi-stage retrieval evaluation reveals that standard embedding models struggle with user-introduced edits, while LLM-distilled embeddings offer improved robustness at a higher computational cost. Although a strong reranker helps mitigate some issues, it cannot fully compensate for first-stage retrieval gaps. Addressing these retrieval gaps, our train- and inference-time mitigation approaches enhance in-domain robustness by up to 17 percentage points and boost out-of-domain generalization by 10 percentage points over baseline models. Overall, our findings provide practical improvements to claim-matching systems, enabling more reliable fact-checking of evolving misinformation.

### SCott: Accelerating Diffusion Models with Stochastic Consistency   Distillation
**Authors**: Hongjian Liu, Qingsong Xie, TianXiang Ye, Zhijie Deng, Chen Chen, Shixiang Tang, Xueyang Fu, Haonan Lu, Zheng-jun Zha

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T11:39:35Z

**Summary**: The iterative sampling procedure employed by diffusion models (DMs) often leads to significant inference latency. To address this, we propose Stochastic Consistency Distillation (SCott) to enable accelerated text-to-image generation, where high-quality and diverse generations can be achieved within just 2-4 sampling steps. In contrast to vanilla consistency distillation (CD) which distills the ordinary differential equation solvers-based sampling process of a pre-trained teacher model into a student, SCott explores the possibility and validates the efficacy of integrating stochastic differential equation (SDE) solvers into CD to fully unleash the potential of the teacher. SCott is augmented with elaborate strategies to control the noise strength and sampling process of the SDE solver. An adversarial loss is further incorporated to strengthen the consistency constraints in rare sampling steps. Empirically, on the MSCOCO-2017 5K dataset with a Stable Diffusion-V1.5 teacher, SCott achieves an FID of 21.9 with 2 sampling steps, surpassing that of the 1-step InstaFlow (23.4) and the 4-step UFOGen (22.1). Moreover, SCott can yield more diverse samples than other consistency models for high-resolution image generation, with up to 16% improvement in a qualified metric.

**Authors**: Kaiwen Yan, Hongcheng Guo, Xuanqing Shi, Jingyi Xu, Yaonan Gu, Zhoujun Li

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T11:09:06Z

**Summary**: With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), the demand for robust instruction-following capabilities in code generation tasks has grown significantly. Code generation not only facilitates faster prototyping and automated testing, but also augments developer efficiency through improved maintainability and reusability of code. In this paper, we introduce CodeIF, the first benchmark specifically designed to assess the abilities of LLMs to adhere to task-oriented instructions within diverse code generation scenarios. CodeIF encompasses a broad range of tasks, including function synthesis, error debugging, algorithmic refactoring, and code explanation, thereby providing a comprehensive suite to evaluate model performance across varying complexity levels and programming domains. We conduct extensive experiments with LLMs, analyzing their strengths and limitations in meeting the demands of these tasks. The experimental results offer valuable insights into how well current models align with human instructions, as well as the extent to which they can generate consistent, maintainable, and contextually relevant code. Our findings not only underscore the critical role that instruction-following LLMs can play in modern software development, but also illuminate pathways for future research aimed at enhancing their adaptability, reliability, and overall effectiveness in automated code generation.

### Bounding Evidence and Estimating Log-Likelihood in VAE
**Authors**: Łukasz Struski, Marcin Mazur, Paweł Batorski, Przemysław Spurek, Jacek Tabor

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T11:04:58Z

**Summary**: Many crucial problems in deep learning and statistical inference are caused by a variational gap, i.e., a difference between model evidence (log-likelihood) and evidence lower bound (ELBO). In particular, in a classical VAE setting that involves training via an ELBO cost function, it is difficult to provide a robust comparison of the effects of training between models, since we do not know a log-likelihood of data (but only its lower bound). In this paper, to deal with this problem, we introduce a general and effective upper bound, which allows us to efficiently approximate the evidence of data. We provide extensive theoretical and experimental studies of our approach, including its comparison to the other state-of-the-art upper bounds, as well as its application as a tool for the evaluation of models that were trained on various lower bounds.

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T10:57:34Z

**Summary**: Understanding the structure of neural network loss surfaces, particularly the emergence of low-loss tunnels, is critical for advancing neural network theory and practice. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to directly embed loss tunnels into the loss landscape of neural networks. Exploring the properties of these loss tunnels offers new insights into their length and structure and sheds light on some common misconceptions. We then apply our approach to Bayesian neural networks, where we improve subspace inference by identifying pitfalls and proposing a more natural prior that better guides the sampling procedure.

### The Serendipity of Claude AI: Case of the 13 Low-Resource National   Languages of Mali
**Authors**: Alou Dembele, Nouhoum Souleymane Coulibaly, Michael Leventhal

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T10:55:47Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP) have improved the representation of underrepresented languages. However, most languages, including Mali's 13 official national languages, continue to be poorly supported or unsupported by automatic translation and generative AI. This situation appears to have slightly improved with certain recent LLM releases. The study evaluated Claude AI's translation performance on each of the 13 national languages of Mali. In addition to ChrF2 and BLEU scores, human evaluators assessed translation accuracy, contextual consistency, robustness to dialect variations, management of linguistic bias, adaptation to a limited corpus, and ease of understanding. The study found that Claude AI performs robustly for languages with very modest language resources and, while unable to produce understandable and coherent texts for Malian languages with minimal resources, still manages to produce results which demonstrate the ability to mimic some elements of the language.

### DrugAgent: Automating AI-aided Drug Discovery Programming through LLM   Multi-Agent Collaboration
**Authors**: Sizhe Liu, Yizhou Lu, Siyu Chen, Xiyang Hu, Jieyu Zhao, Yingzhou Lu, Yue Zhao

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T10:54:30Z

**Summary**: Recent progress in Large Language Models (LLMs) has drawn attention to their potential for accelerating drug discovery. However, a central problem remains: translating theoretical ideas into robust implementations in the highly specialized context of pharmaceutical research. This limitation prevents practitioners from making full use of the latest AI developments in drug discovery. To address this challenge, we introduce DrugAgent, a multi-agent framework that automates machine learning (ML) programming for drug discovery tasks. DrugAgent employs an LLM Planner that formulates high-level ideas and an LLM Instructor that identifies and integrates domain knowledge when implementing those ideas. We present case studies on three representative drug discovery tasks. Our results show that DrugAgent consistently outperforms leading baselines, including a relative improvement of 4.92% in ROC-AUC compared to ReAct for drug-target interaction (DTI). DrugAgent is publicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/drugagent-5C42/.

### Nonparametric efficient causal estimation of the intervention-specific   expected number of recurrent events with continuous-time targeted maximum   likelihood and highly adaptive lasso estimation
**Authors**: Helene C. W. Rytgaard, Mark J. van der Laan

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T10:47:55Z

**Summary**: Longitudinal settings involving outcome, competing risks and censoring events occurring and recurring in continuous time are common in medical research, but are often analyzed with methods that do not allow for taking post-baseline information into account. In this work, we define statistical and causal target parameters via the g-computation formula by carrying out interventions directly on the product integral representing the observed data distribution in a continuous-time counting process model framework. In recurrent events settings our target parameter identifies the expected number of recurrent events also in settings where the censoring mechanism or post-baseline treatment decisions depend on past information of post-baseline covariates such as the recurrent event process. We propose a flexible estimation procedure based on targeted maximum likelihood estimation coupled with highly adaptive lasso estimation to provide a novel approach for double robust and nonparametric inference for the considered target parameter. We illustrate the methods in a simulation study.

### Leveraging Large Language Models to Develop Heuristics for Emerging   Optimization Problems
**Authors**: Thomas Bömer, Nico Koltermann, Max Disselnmeyer, Laura Dörr, Anne Meyer

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T10:22:49Z

**Summary**: Combinatorial optimization problems often rely on heuristic algorithms to generate efficient solutions. However, the manual design of heuristics is resource-intensive and constrained by the designer's expertise. Recent advances in artificial intelligence, particularly large language models (LLMs), have demonstrated the potential to automate heuristic generation through evolutionary frameworks. Recent works focus only on well-known combinatorial optimization problems like the traveling salesman problem and online bin packing problem when designing constructive heuristics. This study investigates whether LLMs can effectively generate heuristics for niche, not yet broadly researched optimization problems, using the unit-load pre-marshalling problem as an example case. We propose the Contextual Evolution of Heuristics (CEoH) framework, an extension of the Evolution of Heuristics (EoH) framework, which incorporates problem-specific descriptions to enhance in-context learning during heuristic generation. Through computational experiments, we evaluate CEoH and EoH and compare the results. Results indicate that CEoH enables smaller LLMs to generate high-quality heuristics more consistently and even outperform larger models. Larger models demonstrate robust performance with or without contextualized prompts. The generated heuristics exhibit scalability to diverse instance configurations.

### Perturbation theory for post-Newtonian neutron stars
**Authors**: Fabian Gittins, Nils Andersson, Shanshan Yin

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T10:15:12Z

**Summary**: Neutron stars are compact, relativistic bodies that host several extremes of modern physics. An exciting development in recent years has been the opportunity to probe this exotic physics by observing compact-binary coalescences using sensitive gravitational-wave and electromagnetic instruments. To maximise the science inferred from these measurements, we require models that accurately represent the physics. In this study, we consider the post-Newtonian approximation to general relativity for the modelling of neutron-star dynamics, with a particular view to model dynamical tides at the late stages of binary inspiral. We develop the post-Newtonian perturbation equations for a non-rotating star and show that the perturbation problem is Hermitian and therefore derives from a fundamental Lagrangian. Establishing this Lagrangian system leads to a conserved symplectic product and canonical energy for the perturbations. We determine the orthogonality condition for the post-Newtonian oscillation modes, which in turn forms the foundation of a mode-sum representation often used for dynamical tides. Finally, we demonstrate that the perturbation formulation is unique.

### EnigmaToM: Improve LLMs' Theory-of-Mind Reasoning Capabilities with   Neural Knowledge Base of Entity States
**Authors**: Hainiu Xu, Siya Qi, Jiazheng Li, Yuxiang Zhou, Jinhua Du, Caroline Catmur, Yulan He

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T10:13:05Z

**Summary**: Theory-of-Mind (ToM), the ability to infer others' perceptions and mental states, is fundamental to human interaction but remains a challenging task for Large Language Models (LLMs). While existing ToM reasoning methods show promise with reasoning via perceptual perspective-taking, they often rely excessively on LLMs, reducing their efficiency and limiting their applicability to high-order ToM reasoning, which requires multi-hop reasoning about characters' beliefs. To address these issues, we present EnigmaToM, a novel neuro-symbolic framework that enhances ToM reasoning by integrating a Neural Knowledge Base of entity states (Enigma) for (1) a psychology-inspired iterative masking mechanism that facilitates accurate perspective-taking and (2) knowledge injection that elicits key entity information. Enigma generates structured representations of entity states, which construct spatial scene graphs -- leveraging spatial information as an inductive bias -- for belief tracking of various ToM orders and enhancing events with fine-grained entity state details. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks, including ToMi, HiToM, and FANToM, show that EnigmaToM significantly improves ToM reasoning across LLMs of varying sizes, particularly excelling in high-order reasoning scenarios.

### iNews: A Multimodal Dataset for Modeling Personalized Affective   Responses to News
**Authors**: Tiancheng Hu, Nigel Collier

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T10:09:53Z

**Summary**: Current approaches to emotion detection often overlook the inherent subjectivity of affective experiences, instead relying on aggregated labels that mask individual variations in emotional responses. We introduce iNews, a novel large-scale dataset explicitly capturing subjective affective responses to news headlines. Our dataset comprises annotations from 291 demographically diverse UK participants across 2,899 multimodal Facebook news posts from major UK outlets, with an average of 5.18 annotators per sample. For each post, annotators provide multifaceted labels including valence, arousal, dominance, discrete emotions, content relevance judgments, sharing likelihood, and modality importance ratings (text, image, or both). Furthermore, we collect comprehensive annotator persona information covering demographics, personality, media trust, and consumption patterns, which explain 15.2% of annotation variance - higher than existing NLP datasets. Incorporating this information yields a 7% accuracy gain in zero-shot prediction and remains beneficial even with 32-shot. iNews will enhance research in LLM personalization, subjectivity, affective computing, and individual-level behavior simulation.

### Golden Cudgel Network for Real-Time Semantic Segmentation
**Authors**: Guoyu Yang, Yuan Wang, Daming Shi, Yanzhong Wang

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T09:59:23Z

**Summary**: Recent real-time semantic segmentation models, whether single-branch or multi-branch, achieve good performance and speed. However, their speed is limited by multi-path blocks, and some depend on high-performance teacher models for training. To overcome these issues, we propose Golden Cudgel Network (GCNet). Specifically, GCNet uses vertical multi-convolutions and horizontal multi-paths for training, which are reparameterized into a single convolution for inference, optimizing both performance and speed. This design allows GCNet to self-enlarge during training and self-contract during inference, effectively becoming a "teacher model" without needing external ones. Experimental results show that GCNet outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in terms of performance and speed on the Cityscapes, CamVid, and Pascal VOC 2012 datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/gyyang23/GCNet.

### See What You Are Told: Visual Attention Sink in Large Multimodal Models
**Authors**: Seil Kang, Jinyeong Kim, Junhyeok Kim, Seong Jae Hwang

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T09:55:07Z

**Summary**: Large multimodal models (LMMs) "see" images by leveraging the attention mechanism between text and visual tokens in the transformer decoder. Ideally, these models should focus on key visual information relevant to the text token. However, recent findings indicate that LMMs have an extraordinary tendency to consistently allocate high attention weights to specific visual tokens, even when these tokens are irrelevant to the corresponding text. In this study, we investigate the property behind the appearance of these irrelevant visual tokens and examine their characteristics. Our findings show that this behavior arises due to the massive activation of certain hidden state dimensions, which resembles the attention sink found in language models. Hence, we refer to this phenomenon as the visual attention sink. In particular, our analysis reveals that removing the irrelevant visual sink tokens does not impact model performance, despite receiving high attention weights. Consequently, we recycle the attention to these tokens as surplus resources, redistributing the attention budget to enhance focus on the image. To achieve this, we introduce Visual Attention Redistribution (VAR), a method that redistributes attention in image-centric heads, which we identify as innately focusing on visual information. VAR can be seamlessly applied across different LMMs to improve performance on a wide range of tasks, including general vision-language tasks, visual hallucination tasks, and vision-centric tasks, all without the need for additional training, models, or inference steps. Experimental results demonstrate that VAR enables LMMs to process visual information more effectively by adjusting their internal attention mechanisms, offering a new direction to enhancing the multimodal capabilities of LMMs.

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T09:52:30Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) can solve an increasing number of complex reasoning tasks while making surprising mistakes in basic numerical understanding and processing (such as 9.11 > 9.9). The latter ability is essential for tackling complex arithmetic and mathematical problems and serves as a foundation for most reasoning tasks, but previous work paid little attention to it or only discussed several restricted tasks (like integer addition). In this paper, we comprehensively investigate the numerical understanding and processing ability (NUPA) of LLMs. Firstly, we introduce a benchmark covering four common numerical representations and 17 distinct numerical tasks in four major categories, resulting in 41 meaningful combinations in total. These tasks are derived from primary and secondary education curricula, encompassing nearly all everyday numerical understanding and processing scenarios, and the rules of these tasks are very simple and clear. Through the benchmark, we find that current LLMs fail frequently in many of the tasks. To study the problem, we train small models with existing and potential techniques for enhancing NUPA (such as tokenizers, PEs, and number formats), comprehensively evaluating their effectiveness using our testbed. We also finetune practical-scale LLMs on our proposed NUPA tasks and find that 1) naive finetuning can improve NUPA a lot on many but not all tasks, and 2) surprisingly, techniques designed to enhance NUPA prove ineffective for finetuning pretrained models. We further explore the impact of chain-of-thought techniques on NUPA. Our work provides a more detailed and comprehensive understanding of NUPA in LLMs. Our benchmark and code are released at https://github.com/GraphPKU/number_cookbook.

### DarwinLM: Evolutionary Structured Pruning of Large Language Models
**Authors**: Shengkun Tang, Oliver Sieberling, Eldar Kurtic, Zhiqiang Shen, Dan Alistarh

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T09:50:16Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant success across various NLP tasks. However, their massive computational costs limit their widespread use, particularly in real-time applications. Structured pruning offers an effective solution by compressing models and directly providing end-to-end speed improvements, regardless of the hardware environment. Meanwhile, different components of the model exhibit varying sensitivities towards pruning, calling for non-uniform model compression. However, a pruning method should not only identify a capable substructure, but also account for post-compression training. To this end, we propose DarwinLM, a method for training-aware structured pruning. DarwinLM builds upon an evolutionary search process, generating multiple offspring models in each generation through mutation, and selecting the fittest for survival. To assess the effect of post-training, we incorporate a lightweight, multistep training process within the offspring population, progressively increasing the number of tokens and eliminating poorly performing models in each selection stage. We validate our method through extensive experiments on Llama-2-7B, Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen-2.5-14B-Instruct, achieving state-of-the-art performance for structured pruning. For instance, DarwinLM surpasses ShearedLlama while requiring 5x less training data during post-compression training. Code is at: https://github.com/IST-DASLab/DarwinLM

### LLM as GNN: Graph Vocabulary Learning for Text-Attributed Graph   Foundation Models
**Authors**: Xi Zhu, Haochen Xue, Ziwei Zhao, Wujiang Xu, Jingyuan Huang, Minghao Guo, Qifan Wang, Kaixiong Zhou, Yongfeng Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T09:45:22Z

**Summary**: Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs), where each node is associated with text descriptions, are ubiquitous in real-world scenarios. They typically exhibit distinctive structure and domain-specific knowledge, motivating the development of a Graph Foundation Model (GFM) that generalizes across diverse graphs and tasks. Despite large efforts to integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for TAGs, existing approaches suffer from decoupled architectures with two-stage alignment, limiting their synergistic potential. Even worse, existing methods assign out-of-vocabulary (OOV) tokens to graph nodes, leading to graph-specific semantics, token explosion, and incompatibility with task-oriented prompt templates, which hinders cross-graph and cross-task transferability. To address these challenges, we propose PromptGFM, a versatile GFM for TAGs grounded in graph vocabulary learning. PromptGFM comprises two key components: (1) Graph Understanding Module, which explicitly prompts LLMs to replicate the finest GNN workflow within the text space, facilitating seamless GNN-LLM integration and elegant graph-text alignment; (2) Graph Inference Module, which establishes a language-based graph vocabulary ensuring expressiveness, transferability, and scalability, enabling readable instructions for LLM fine-tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate our superiority and transferability across diverse graphs and tasks. The code is available at this: https://github.com/agiresearch/PromptGFM.

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T18:59:23Z

**Summary**: As large language models (LLMs) become more capable and agentic, the requirement for trust in their outputs grows significantly, yet at the same time concerns have been mounting that models may learn to lie in pursuit of their goals. To address these concerns, a body of work has emerged around the notion of "honesty" in LLMs, along with interventions aimed at mitigating deceptive behaviors. However, evaluations of honesty are currently highly limited, with no benchmark combining large scale and applicability to all models. Moreover, many benchmarks claiming to measure honesty in fact simply measure accuracy--the correctness of a model's beliefs--in disguise. In this work, we introduce a large-scale human-collected dataset for measuring honesty directly, allowing us to disentangle accuracy from honesty for the first time. Across a diverse set of LLMs, we find that while larger models obtain higher accuracy on our benchmark, they do not become more honest. Surprisingly, while most frontier LLMs obtain high scores on truthfulness benchmarks, we find a substantial propensity in frontier LLMs to lie when pressured to do so, resulting in low honesty scores on our benchmark. We find that simple methods, such as representation engineering interventions, can improve honesty. These results underscore the growing need for robust evaluations and effective interventions to ensure LLMs remain trustworthy.

### Personalize Your LLM: Fake it then Align it
**Authors**: Yijing Zhang, Dyah Adila, Changho Shin, Frederic Sala

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T18:59:19Z

**Summary**: Personalizing large language models (LLMs) is essential for delivering tailored interactions that improve user experience. Many existing personalization methods require fine-tuning LLMs for each user, rendering them prohibitively expensive for widespread adoption. Although retrieval-based approaches offer a more compute-efficient alternative, they still depend on large, high-quality datasets that are not consistently available for all users. To address this challenge, we propose CHAMELEON, a scalable and efficient personalization approach that uses (1) self-generated personal preference data and (2) representation editing to enable quick and cost-effective personalization. Our experiments on various tasks, including those from the LaMP personalization benchmark, show that CHAMELEON efficiently adapts models to personal preferences, improving instruction-tuned models and outperforms two personalization baselines by an average of 40% across two model architectures.

### Process-based Self-Rewarding Language Models
**Authors**: Shimao Zhang, Xiao Liu, Xin Zhang, Junxiao Liu, Zheheng Luo, Shujian Huang, Yeyun Gong

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T18:58:44Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models have demonstrated outstanding performance across various downstream tasks and have been widely applied in multiple scenarios. Human-annotated preference data is used for training to further improve LLMs' performance, which is constrained by the upper limit of human performance. Therefore, Self-Rewarding method has been proposed, where LLMs generate training data by rewarding their own outputs. However, the existing self-rewarding paradigm is not effective in mathematical reasoning scenarios and may even lead to a decline in performance. In this work, we propose the Process-based Self-Rewarding pipeline for language models, which introduces long-thought reasoning, step-wise LLM-as-a-Judge, and step-wise preference optimization within the self-rewarding paradigm. Our new paradigm successfully enhances the performance of LLMs on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks through iterative Process-based Self-Rewarding, demonstrating the immense potential of self-rewarding to achieve LLM reasoning that may surpass human capabilities.

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T18:57:01Z

**Summary**: Visual language models (VLMs) have made significant advances in accuracy in recent years. However, their efficiency has received much less attention. This paper introduces NVILA, a family of open VLMs designed to optimize both efficiency and accuracy. Building on top of VILA, we improve its model architecture by first scaling up the spatial and temporal resolutions, and then compressing visual tokens. This "scale-then-compress" approach enables NVILA to efficiently process high-resolution images and long videos. We also conduct a systematic investigation to enhance the efficiency of NVILA throughout its entire lifecycle, from training and fine-tuning to deployment. NVILA matches or surpasses the accuracy of many leading open and proprietary VLMs across a wide range of image and video benchmarks. At the same time, it reduces training costs by 4.5X, fine-tuning memory usage by 3.4X, pre-filling latency by 1.6-2.2X, and decoding latency by 1.2-2.8X. We will soon make our code and models available to facilitate reproducibility.

### Towards Understanding Distilled Reasoning Models: A Representational   Approach
**Authors**: David D. Baek, Max Tegmark

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T18:40:19Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we investigate how model distillation impacts the development of reasoning features in large language models (LLMs). To explore this, we train a crosscoder on Qwen-series models and their fine-tuned variants. Our results suggest that the crosscoder learns features corresponding to various types of reasoning, including self-reflection and computation verification. Moreover, we observe that distilled models contain unique reasoning feature directions, which could be used to steer the model into over-thinking or incisive-thinking mode. In particular, we perform analysis on four specific reasoning categories: (a) self-reflection, (b) deductive reasoning, (c) alternative reasoning, and (d) contrastive reasoning. Finally, we examine the changes in feature geometry resulting from the distillation process and find indications that larger distilled models may develop more structured representations, which correlate with enhanced distillation performance. By providing insights into how distillation modifies the model, our study contributes to enhancing the transparency and reliability of AI systems.

### CDS: Data Synthesis Method Guided by Cognitive Diagnosis Theory
**Authors**: Haokun Zhao, Jinyi Han, Jiaqing Liang, Yanghua Xiao

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T18:39:05Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant advancements, but the increasing complexity of tasks and higher performance demands highlight the need for continuous improvement. Some approaches utilize synthetic data generated by advanced LLMs based on evaluation results to train models. However, conventional evaluation methods fail to provide detailed, fine-grained profiles of LLMs, limiting their guidance for data synthesis. In this paper, we introduce the Cognitive Diagnostic Synthesis (CDS) method, which incorporates a diagnostic process inspired by Cognitive Diagnosis Theory (CDT) to refine evaluation results and characterize model profiles at the knowledge component level. Based on these diagnostics, we propose two diagnosis-synthesis strategies for weakness-targeted data synthesis. Additionally, we present an enhanced data augmentation and selection pipeline to improve the quality and diversity of synthesized data. Our experiments with several open-source models show significant improvements across multiple benchmarks, achieving up to 6.00% improvement in code generation, 13.10% in mathematical reasoning, and 5.43% in academic exams. Code and data are available on GitHub.

### Interactive Data Harmonization with LLM Agents
**Authors**: Aécio Santos, Eduardo H. M. Pena, Roque Lopez, Juliana Freire

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T18:33:41Z

**Summary**: Data harmonization is an essential task that entails integrating datasets from diverse sources. Despite years of research in this area, it remains a time-consuming and challenging task due to schema mismatches, varying terminologies, and differences in data collection methodologies. This paper presents the case for agentic data harmonization as a means to both empower experts to harmonize their data and to streamline the process. We introduce Harmonia, a system that combines LLM-based reasoning, an interactive user interface, and a library of data harmonization primitives to automate the synthesis of data harmonization pipelines. We demonstrate Harmonia in a clinical data harmonization scenario, where it helps to interactively create reusable pipelines that map datasets to a standard format. Finally, we discuss challenges and open problems, and suggest research directions for advancing our vision.

### Assessing Correctness in LLM-Based Code Generation via Uncertainty   Estimation
**Authors**: Arindam Sharma, Cristina David

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T18:24:41Z

**Summary**: In this work, we explore uncertainty estimation as a proxy for correctness in LLM-generated code. To this end, we adapt two state-of-the-art techniques from natural language generation -- one based on entropy and another on mutual information -- to the domain of code generation. Given the distinct semantic properties of code, we introduce modifications, including a semantic equivalence check based on symbolic execution. Our findings indicate a strong correlation between the uncertainty computed through these techniques and correctness, highlighting the potential of uncertainty estimation for quality assessment. Additionally, we propose a simplified version of the entropy-based method that assumes a uniform distribution over the LLM's responses, demonstrating comparable effectiveness. Using these techniques, we develop an abstention policy that prevents the model from making predictions when uncertainty is high, reducing incorrect outputs to near zero. Our evaluation on the LiveCodeBench shows that our approach significantly outperforms a baseline relying solely on LLM-reported log-probabilities.

### PARAMANU-GANITA: Can Small Math Language Models Rival with Large   Language Models on Mathematical Reasoning?
**Authors**: Mitodru Niyogi, Arnab Bhattacharya

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T18:17:28Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we study whether domain specific pretraining of small generative language models (SLM) from scratch with domain specialized tokenizer and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) instruction fine-tuning results in competitive performance on mathematical reasoning compared to LLMs? Secondly, whether this approach is environmentally sustainable, highly cost efficient? To address these research questions, we present Paramanu-Ganita, a 208 million-parameter novel decoder-only Auto Regressive SLM on mathematics. We performed pretraining from scratch on 31.5 billion tokens for 170 A100 hours using a context size of 4096 on a mixed mathematical corpus consisting of web pages, source code, textbooks, CoT templatised StackOverflow QA pairs, and mathematical lecture notes in LaTeX curated by us. We also trained a math and code specialised BPE tokenizer. We proposed and performed CoT instruction fine-tuning of Paramanu-Ganita on the MetaMathQA dataset. Our model Paramanu-Ganita, despite being 34 times smaller than the 7B LLMs, outperforms generalist LLMs by approximately 30% points, and even math-specialised LLMs by 3-23% points in GSM8K test accuracy metric. On MATH benchmark, Paramanu-Ganita outperformed the various models by 6-8% points. On benchmarks like LogiQA, MMLU (high school, college level), and competitive exams level, AGIEVAL (AQuA-RAT, SAT-Math), Paramanu-Ganita outperformed others by 1-4%. Our model is available at https://huggingface.co/gyanai/paramanu-ganita-208M-hf .

### Improving LLM Safety Alignment with Dual-Objective Optimization
**Authors**: Xuandong Zhao, Will Cai, Tianneng Shi, David Huang, Licong Lin, Song Mei, Dawn Song

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T18:01:05Z

**Summary**: Existing training-time safety alignment techniques for large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. Direct preference optimization (DPO), a widely deployed alignment method, exhibits limitations in both experimental and theoretical contexts as its loss function proves suboptimal for refusal learning. Through gradient-based analysis, we identify these shortcomings and propose an improved safety alignment that disentangles DPO objectives into two components: (1) robust refusal training, which encourages refusal even when partial unsafe generations are produced, and (2) targeted unlearning of harmful knowledge. This approach significantly increases LLM robustness against a wide range of jailbreak attacks, including prefilling, suffix, and multi-turn attacks across both in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios. Furthermore, we introduce a method to emphasize critical refusal tokens by incorporating a reward-based token-level weighting mechanism for refusal learning, which further improves the robustness against adversarial exploits. Our research also suggests that robustness to jailbreak attacks is correlated with token distribution shifts in the training process and internal representations of refusal and harmful tokens, offering valuable directions for future research in LLM safety alignment. The code is available at https://github.com/wicai24/DOOR-Alignment

### Effective LLM Knowledge Learning via Model Generalization
**Authors**: Mingkang Zhu, Xi Chen, Zhongdao Wang, Bei Yu, Hengshuang Zhao, Jiaya Jia

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T17:56:20Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are trained on enormous documents that contain extensive world knowledge. However, it is still not well-understood how knowledge is acquired via autoregressive pre-training. This lack of understanding greatly hinders effective knowledge learning, especially for continued pretraining on up-to-date information, as this evolving information often lacks diverse repetitions like foundational knowledge. In this paper, we focus on understanding and improving LLM knowledge learning. We found and verified that knowledge learning for LLMs can be deemed as an implicit supervised task hidden in the autoregressive pre-training objective. Our findings suggest that knowledge learning for LLMs would benefit from methods designed to improve generalization ability for supervised tasks. Based on our analysis, we propose the formatting-based data augmentation to grow in-distribution samples, which does not present the risk of altering the facts embedded in documents as text paraphrasing. We also introduce sharpness-aware minimization as an effective optimization algorithm to better improve generalization. Moreover, our analysis and method can be readily extended to instruction tuning. Extensive experiment results validate our findings and demonstrate our methods' effectiveness in both continued pre-training and instruction tuning. This paper offers new perspectives and insights to interpret and design effective strategies for LLM knowledge learning.

### A Practical Memory Injection Attack against LLM Agents
**Authors**: Shen Dong, Shaocheng Xu, Pengfei He, Yige Li, Jiliang Tang, Tianming Liu, Hui Liu, Zhen Xiang

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T17:53:24Z

**Summary**: Agents based on large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in a wide range of complex, real-world applications. However, LLM agents with a compromised memory bank may easily produce harmful outputs when the past records retrieved for demonstration are malicious. In this paper, we propose a novel Memory INJection Attack, MINJA, that enables the injection of malicious records into the memory bank by only interacting with the agent via queries and output observations. These malicious records are designed to elicit a sequence of malicious reasoning steps leading to undesirable agent actions when executing the victim user's query. Specifically, we introduce a sequence of bridging steps to link the victim query to the malicious reasoning steps. During the injection of the malicious record, we propose an indication prompt to guide the agent to autonomously generate our designed bridging steps. We also propose a progressive shortening strategy that gradually removes the indication prompt, such that the malicious record will be easily retrieved when processing the victim query comes after. Our extensive experiments across diverse agents demonstrate the effectiveness of MINJA in compromising agent memory. With minimal requirements for execution, MINJA enables any user to influence agent memory, highlighting practical risks of LLM agents.

### Developing and Utilizing a Large-Scale Cantonese Dataset for   Multi-Tasking in Large Language Models
**Authors**: Jiyue Jiang, Alfred Kar Yin Truong, Yanyu Chen, Qinghang Bao, Sheng Wang, Pengan Chen, Jiuming Wang, Lingpeng Kong, Yu Li, Chuan Wu

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T17:53:07Z

**Summary**: High-quality data resources play a crucial role in learning large language models (LLMs), particularly for low-resource languages like Cantonese. Despite having more than 85 million native speakers, Cantonese is still considered a low-resource language in the field of natural language processing (NLP) due to factors such as the dominance of Mandarin, lack of cohesion within the Cantonese-speaking community, diversity in character encoding and input methods, and the tendency of overseas Cantonese speakers to prefer using English. In addition, rich colloquial vocabulary of Cantonese, English loanwords, and code-switching characteristics add to the complexity of corpus collection and processing. To address these challenges, we collect Cantonese texts from a variety of sources, including open source corpora, Hong Kong-specific forums, Wikipedia, and Common Crawl data. We conduct rigorous data processing through language filtering, quality filtering, content filtering, and de-duplication steps, successfully constructing a high-quality Cantonese corpus of over 2 billion tokens for training large language models. We further refined the model through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on curated Cantonese tasks, enhancing its ability to handle specific applications. Upon completion of the training, the model achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on four Cantonese benchmarks. After training on our dataset, the model also exhibits improved performance on other mainstream language tasks.

### DelTA: An Online Document-Level Translation Agent Based on Multi-Level   Memory
**Authors**: Yutong Wang, Jiali Zeng, Xuebo Liu, Derek F. Wong, Fandong Meng, Jie Zhou, Min Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T17:50:44Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved reasonable quality improvements in machine translation (MT). However, most current research on MT-LLMs still faces significant challenges in maintaining translation consistency and accuracy when processing entire documents. In this paper, we introduce DelTA, a Document-levEL Translation Agent designed to overcome these limitations. DelTA features a multi-level memory structure that stores information across various granularities and spans, including Proper Noun Records, Bilingual Summary, Long-Term Memory, and Short-Term Memory, which are continuously retrieved and updated by auxiliary LLM-based components. Experimental results indicate that DelTA significantly outperforms strong baselines in terms of translation consistency and quality across four open/closed-source LLMs and two representative document translation datasets, achieving an increase in consistency scores by up to 4.58 percentage points and in COMET scores by up to 3.16 points on average. DelTA employs a sentence-by-sentence translation strategy, ensuring no sentence omissions and offering a memory-efficient solution compared to the mainstream method. Furthermore, DelTA improves pronoun and context-dependent translation accuracy, and the summary component of the agent also shows promise as a tool for query-based summarization tasks. The code and data of our approach are released at https://github.com/YutongWang1216/DocMTAgent.

### Addressing Overprescribing Challenges: Fine-Tuning Large Language Models   for Medication Recommendation Tasks
**Authors**: Zihao Zhao, Chenxiao Fan, Chongming Gao, Fuli Feng, Xiangnan He

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T17:28:16Z

**Summary**: Medication recommendation systems have garnered attention within healthcare for their potential to deliver personalized and efficacious drug combinations based on patient's clinical data. However, existing methodologies encounter challenges in adapting to diverse Electronic Health Records (EHR) systems and effectively utilizing unstructured data, resulting in limited generalization capabilities and suboptimal performance. Recently, interest is growing in harnessing Large Language Models (LLMs) in the medical domain to support healthcare professionals and enhance patient care. Despite the emergence of medical LLMs and their promising results in tasks like medical question answering, their practical applicability in clinical settings, particularly in medication recommendation, often remains underexplored.   In this study, we evaluate both general-purpose and medical-specific LLMs for medication recommendation tasks. Our findings reveal that LLMs frequently encounter the challenge of overprescribing, leading to heightened clinical risks and diminished medication recommendation accuracy. To address this issue, we propose Language-Assisted Medication Recommendation (LAMO), which employs a parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach to tailor open-source LLMs for optimal performance in medication recommendation scenarios. LAMO leverages the wealth of clinical information within clinical notes, a resource often underutilized in traditional methodologies. As a result of our approach, LAMO outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by over 10% in internal validation accuracy. Furthermore, temporal and external validations demonstrate LAMO's robust generalization capabilities across various temporal and hospital contexts. Additionally, an out-of-distribution medication recommendation experiment demonstrates LAMO's remarkable accuracy even with medications outside the training data.

### MAS-GPT: Training LLMs to Build LLM-based Multi-Agent Systems
**Authors**: Rui Ye, Shuo Tang, Rui Ge, Yaxin Du, Zhenfei Yin, Siheng Chen, Jing Shao

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T17:27:59Z

**Summary**: LLM-based multi-agent systems (MAS) have shown significant potential in tackling diverse tasks. However, to design effective MAS, existing approaches heavily rely on manual configurations or multiple calls of advanced LLMs, resulting in inadaptability and high inference costs. In this paper, we simplify the process of building an MAS by reframing it as a generative language task, where the input is a user query and the output is a corresponding MAS. To address this novel task, we unify the representation of MAS as executable code and propose a consistency-oriented data construction pipeline to create a high-quality dataset comprising coherent and consistent query-MAS pairs. Using this dataset, we train MAS-GPT, an open-source medium-sized LLM that is capable of generating query-adaptive MAS within a single LLM inference. The generated MAS can be seamlessly applied to process user queries and deliver high-quality responses. Extensive experiments on 9 benchmarks and 5 LLMs show that the proposed MAS-GPT consistently outperforms 10+ baseline MAS methods on diverse settings, indicating MAS-GPT's high effectiveness, efficiency and strong generalization ability. Code will be available at https://github.com/rui-ye/MAS-GPT.

**Authors**: Saikat Barua, Mostafizur Rahman, Md Jafor Sadek, Rafiul Islam, Shehnaz Khaled, Md. Shohrab Hossain

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T17:11:13Z

**Summary**: The principles of automation and innovation serve as foundational elements for advancement in contemporary science and technology. Here, we introduce Pygen, an automation platform designed to empower researchers, technologists, and hobbyists to bring abstract ideas to life as core, usable software tools written in Python. Pygen leverages the immense power of autoregressive large language models to augment human creativity during the ideation, iteration, and innovation process. By combining state-of-the-art language models with open-source code generation technologies, Pygen has significantly reduced the manual overhead of tool development. From a user prompt, Pygen automatically generates Python packages for a complete workflow from concept to package generation and documentation. The findings of our work show that Pygen considerably enhances the researcher's productivity by enabling the creation of resilient, modular, and well-documented packages for various specialized purposes. We employ a prompt enhancement approach to distill the user's package description into increasingly specific and actionable. While being inherently an open-ended task, we have evaluated the generated packages and the documentation using Human Evaluation, LLM-based evaluation, and CodeBLEU, with detailed results in the results section.

### A modeling framework to support the electrification of private transport   in African cities: a case study of Addis Ababa
**Authors**: Jérémy Dumoulin, Dawit Gebremeskel, Kanchwodia Gashaw, Ingeborg Graabak, Noémie Jeannin, Alejandro Pena-Bello, Christophe Ballif, Nicolas Wyrsch

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T17:07:49Z

**Summary**: The electrification of road transport, as the predominant mode of transportation in Africa, represents a great opportunity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and dependence on costly fuel imports. However, it introduces major challenges for local energy infrastructures, including the deployment of charging stations and the impact on often fragile electricity grids. Despite its importance, research on electric mobility planning in Africa remains limited, while existing planning tools rely on detailed local mobility data that is often unavailable, especially for privately owned passenger vehicles. In this study, we introduce a novel framework designed to support private vehicle electrification in data-scarce regions and apply it to Addis Ababa, simulating the mobility patterns and charging needs of 100,000 electric vehicles. Our analysis indicate that these vehicles generate a daily charging demand of approximately 350 MWh and emphasize the significant influence of the charging location on the spatial and temporal distribution of this demand. Notably, charging at public places can help smooth the charging demand throughout the day, mitigating peak charging loads on the electricity grid. We also estimate charging station requirements, finding that workplace charging requires approximately one charging point per three electric vehicles, while public charging requires only one per thirty. Finally, we demonstrate that photovoltaic energy can cover a substantial share of the charging needs, emphasizing the potential for renewable energy integration. This study lays the groundwork for electric mobility planning in Addis Ababa while offering a transferable framework for other African cities.

### Attentive Reasoning Queries: A Systematic Method for Optimizing   Instruction-Following in Large Language Models
**Authors**: Bar Karov, Dor Zohar, Yam Marcovitz

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T17:03:48Z

**Summary**: We present Attentive Reasoning Queries (ARQs), a novel structured reasoning approach that significantly improves instruction-following in Large Language Models through domain-specialized reasoning blueprints. While LLMs demonstrate remarkable capabilities across diverse tasks, they often fail to maintain adherence to complex, use-case-specific instructions during multi-turn conversations, presenting challenges for business-critical applications. ARQs address this limitation by guiding LLMs through systematic reasoning steps with targeted queries that reinstate critical instructions and facilitate intermediate reasoning throughout the completion process. In extensive testing within Parlant, our framework for reliable customer-facing agents in which ARQs were born out of necessity, they achieved a 90.2% success rate across 87 test scenarios, outperforming both Chain-of-Thought reasoning (86.1%) and direct response generation (81.5%). ARQs showed particular strength in addressing persistent failure modes like guideline re-application and hallucination prevention. Our analysis also revealed that ARQs can potentially be more computationally efficient than free-form reasoning when carefully designed. These findings demonstrate that structured reasoning approaches provide effective mechanisms for controlling how LLMs process information and make decisions in complex scenarios.

### Analogical Reasoning Inside Large Language Models: Concept Vectors and   the Limits of Abstraction
**Authors**: Gustaw Opiełka, Hannes Rosenbusch, Claire E. Stevenson

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T16:59:08Z

**Summary**: Analogical reasoning relies on conceptual abstractions, but it is unclear whether Large Language Models (LLMs) harbor such internal representations. We explore distilled representations from LLM activations and find that function vectors (FVs; Todd et al., 2024) - compact representations for in-context learning (ICL) tasks - are not invariant to simple input changes (e.g., open-ended vs. multiple-choice), suggesting they capture more than pure concepts. Using representational similarity analysis (RSA), we localize a small set of attention heads that encode invariant concept vectors (CVs) for verbal concepts like "antonym". These CVs function as feature detectors that operate independently of the final output - meaning that a model may form a correct internal representation yet still produce an incorrect output. Furthermore, CVs can be used to causally guide model behaviour. However, for more abstract concepts like "previous" and "next", we do not observe invariant linear representations, a finding we link to generalizability issues LLMs display within these domains.

### SMAC-R1: The Emergence of Intelligence in Decision-Making Tasks
**Authors**: Yue Deng, Weiyu Ma, Yuxin Fan, Ruyi Song, Yin Zhang, Haifeng Zhang, Jian Zhao

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T16:49:51Z

**Summary**: StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC) has been one of the most commonly used experimental environments in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), where the specific task is to control a set number of allied units to defeat enemy forces. Traditional MARL algorithms often require interacting with the environment for millions of steps to train a parametric model, of which the resulting policies are typically non-interpretable with weak transferability. In this paper, we introduce SMAC-R1 which is based on the Qwen2.5-7B-Base LLM distilled from DeepSeek-Coder-v2.5-236B. Similar to online reinforcement learning after behavior cloning in offline learning process, in our pipeline, agents leverage the DeepSeek LLM to generate decision tree code by providing task descriptions, and the agents are further self-reflected using feedback from the rewards provided by the environment. Based on that, we augment the generated scripts to fine-tune a small LLM, Qwen2.5-7B-Base, to distill the decision-making ability via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and enhance the script generation ability by the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm. We conduct experiments in the original 23 SMAC tasks and 10 newly-designed tasks to demonstrate that our method can produce high-quality, interpretable decision trees with minimal environmental exploration. Moreover, these scripts exhibit strong transferability, successfully applying to homogeneous SMAC environments without modification. We believe this approach offers a new direction for solving decision-making tasks and domain-specific LLM training pipelines in the future.

### CycleResearcher: Improving Automated Research via Automated Review
**Authors**: Yixuan Weng, Minjun Zhu, Guangsheng Bao, Hongbo Zhang, Jindong Wang, Yue Zhang, Linyi Yang

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T16:36:05Z

**Summary**: The automation of scientific discovery has been a long-standing goal within the research community, driven by the potential to accelerate knowledge creation. While significant progress has been made using commercial large language models (LLMs) as research assistants or idea generators, the possibility of automating the entire research process with open-source LLMs remains largely unexplored. This paper explores the feasibility of using open-source post-trained LLMs as autonomous agents capable of performing the full cycle of automated research and review, from literature review and manuscript preparation to peer review and paper refinement. Our iterative preference training framework consists of CycleResearcher, which conducts research tasks, and CycleReviewer, which simulates the peer review process, providing iterative feedback via reinforcement learning. To train these models, we develop two new datasets, Review-5k and Research-14k, reflecting real-world machine learning research and peer review dynamics. Our results demonstrate that CycleReviewer achieves promising performance with a 26.89\% reduction in mean absolute error (MAE) compared to individual human reviewers in predicting paper scores, indicating the potential of LLMs to effectively assist expert-level research evaluation. In research, the papers generated by the CycleResearcher model achieved a score of 5.36 in simulated peer reviews, showing some competitiveness in terms of simulated review scores compared to the preprint level of 5.24 from human experts, while still having room for improvement compared to the accepted paper level of 5.69. This work represents a significant step toward fully automated scientific inquiry, providing ethical safeguards and exploring AI-driven research capabilities.

### Improving Neutral Point of View Text Generation through   Parameter-Efficient Reinforcement Learning and a Small-Scale High-Quality   Dataset
**Authors**: Jessica Hoffmann, Christiane Ahlheim, Zac Yu, Aria Walfrand, Jarvis Jin, Marie Tano, Ahmad Beirami, Erin van Liemt, Nithum Thain, Hakim Sidahmed, Lucas Dixon

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T16:32:47Z

**Summary**: This paper describes the construction of a dataset and the evaluation of training methods to improve generative large language models' (LLMs) ability to answer queries on sensitive topics with a Neutral Point of View (NPOV), i.e., to provide significantly more informative, diverse and impartial answers. The dataset, the SHQ-NPOV dataset, comprises 300 high-quality, human-written quadruplets: a query on a sensitive topic, an answer, an NPOV rating, and a set of links to source texts elaborating the various points of view. The first key contribution of this paper is a new methodology to create such datasets through iterative rounds of human peer-critique and annotator training, which we release alongside the dataset. The second key contribution is the identification of a highly effective training regime for parameter-efficient reinforcement learning (PE-RL) to improve NPOV generation. We compare and extensively evaluate PE-RL and multiple baselines-including LoRA finetuning (a strong baseline), SFT and RLHF.   PE-RL not only improves on overall NPOV quality compared to the strongest baseline ($97.06\%\rightarrow 99.08\%$), but also scores much higher on features linguists identify as key to separating good answers from the best answers ($60.25\%\rightarrow 85.21\%$ for presence of supportive details, $68.74\%\rightarrow 91.43\%$ for absence of oversimplification). A qualitative analysis corroborates this. Finally, our evaluation finds no statistical differences between results on topics that appear in the training dataset and those on separated evaluation topics, which provides strong evidence that our approach to training PE-RL exhibits very effective out of topic generalization.

**Authors**: Shaina Raza, Mukund Sayeeganesh Chettiar, Matin Yousefabadi, Tahniat Khan, Marcelo Lotif

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T16:24:43Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we introduce FairSense-AI: a multimodal framework designed to detect and mitigate bias in both text and images. By leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs), FairSense-AI uncovers subtle forms of prejudice or stereotyping that can appear in content, providing users with bias scores, explanatory highlights, and automated recommendations for fairness enhancements. In addition, FairSense-AI integrates an AI risk assessment component that aligns with frameworks like the MIT AI Risk Repository and NIST AI Risk Management Framework, enabling structured identification of ethical and safety concerns. The platform is optimized for energy efficiency via techniques such as model pruning and mixed-precision computation, thereby reducing its environmental footprint. Through a series of case studies and applications, we demonstrate how FairSense-AI promotes responsible AI use by addressing both the social dimension of fairness and the pressing need for sustainability in large-scale AI deployments. https://vectorinstitute.github.io/FairSense-AI, https://pypi.org/project/fair-sense-ai/ (Sustainability , Responsible AI , Large Language Models , Vision Language Models , Ethical AI , Green AI)

### Psy-Copilot: Visual Chain of Thought for Counseling
**Authors**: Keqi Chen, Zekai Sun, Huijun Lian, Yingming Gao, Ya Li

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T16:23:15Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly popular in the field of psychological counseling. However, when human therapists work with LLMs in therapy sessions, it is hard to understand how the model gives the answers. To address this, we have constructed Psy-COT, a graph designed to visualize the thought processes of LLMs during therapy sessions. The Psy-COT graph presents semi-structured counseling conversations alongside step-by-step annotations that capture the reasoning and insights of therapists. Moreover, we have developed Psy-Copilot, which is a conversational AI assistant designed to assist human psychological therapists in their consultations. It can offer traceable psycho-information based on retrieval, including response candidates, similar dialogue sessions, related strategies, and visual traces of results. We have also built an interactive platform for AI-assisted counseling. It has an interface that displays the relevant parts of the retrieval sub-graph. The Psy-Copilot is designed not to replace psychotherapists but to foster collaboration between AI and human therapists, thereby promoting mental health development. Our code and demo are both open-sourced and available for use.

### MIRROR: A Novel Approach for the Automated Evaluation of Open-Ended   Question Generation
**Authors**: Aniket Deroy, Subhankar Maity, Sudeshna Sarkar

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T16:16:01Z

**Summary**: Automatic question generation is a critical task that involves evaluating question quality by considering factors such as engagement, pedagogical value, and the ability to stimulate critical thinking. These aspects require human-like understanding and judgment, which automated systems currently lack. However, human evaluations are costly and impractical for large-scale samples of generated questions. Therefore, we propose a novel system, MIRROR (Multi-LLM Iterative Review and Response for Optimized Rating), which leverages large language models (LLMs) to automate the evaluation process for questions generated by automated question generation systems. We experimented with several state-of-the-art LLMs, such as GPT-4, Gemini, and Llama2-70b. We observed that the scores of human evaluation metrics, namely relevance, appropriateness, novelty, complexity, and grammaticality, improved when using the feedback-based approach called MIRROR, tending to be closer to the human baseline scores. Furthermore, we observed that Pearson's correlation coefficient between GPT-4 and human experts improved when using our proposed feedback-based approach, MIRROR, compared to direct prompting for evaluation. Error analysis shows that our proposed approach, MIRROR, significantly helps to improve relevance and appropriateness.

### Exploring Code Language Models for Automated HLS-based Hardware   Generation: Benchmark, Infrastructure and Analysis
**Authors**: Jiahao Gai, Hao Mark Chen, Zhican Wang, Hongyu Zhou, Wanru Zhao, Nicholas Lane, Hongxiang Fan

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T16:07:23Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in code generation have illuminated the potential of employing large language models (LLMs) for general-purpose programming languages such as Python and C++, opening new opportunities for automating software development and enhancing programmer productivity. The potential of LLMs in software programming has sparked significant interest in exploring automated hardware generation and automation. Although preliminary endeavors have been made to adopt LLMs in generating hardware description languages (HDLs), several challenges persist in this direction. First, the volume of available HDL training data is substantially smaller compared to that for software programming languages. Second, the pre-trained LLMs, mainly tailored for software code, tend to produce HDL designs that are more error-prone. Third, the generation of HDL requires a significantly higher number of tokens compared to software programming, leading to inefficiencies in cost and energy consumption. To tackle these challenges, this paper explores leveraging LLMs to generate High-Level Synthesis (HLS)-based hardware design. Although code generation for domain-specific programming languages is not new in the literature, we aim to provide experimental results, insights, benchmarks, and evaluation infrastructure to investigate the suitability of HLS over low-level HDLs for LLM-assisted hardware design generation. To achieve this, we first finetune pre-trained models for HLS-based hardware generation, using a collected dataset with text prompts and corresponding reference HLS designs. An LLM-assisted framework is then proposed to automate end-to-end hardware code generation, which also investigates the impact of chain-of-thought and feedback loops promoting techniques on HLS-design generation. Limited by the timeframe of this research, we plan to evaluate more advanced reasoning models in the future.

### Reasoning to Attend: Try to Understand How <SEG> Token Works
**Authors**: Rui Qian, Xin Yin, Dejing Dou

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T15:55:51Z

**Summary**: Current Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) empowered visual grounding typically rely on $\texttt{<SEG>}$ token as a text prompt to jointly optimize the vision-language model (e.g., LLaVA) and the downstream task-specified model (\eg, SAM). However, we observe that little research has looked into how it works. In this work, we first visualize the similarity maps, which are obtained by computing the semantic similarity between the $\texttt{<SEG>}$ token and the image token embeddings derived from the last hidden layer in both the LLaVA encoder and SAM decoder. Intriguingly, we have found that a striking consistency holds in terms of activation responses in the similarity map,which reveals that what $\texttt{<SEG>}$ token contributes to is the semantic similarity within image-text pairs. Specifically, $\texttt{<SEG>}$ token, a placeholder expanded in text vocabulary, extensively queries among individual tokenized image patches to match the semantics of an object from text to the paired image while the Large Language Models (LLMs) are being fine-tuned. Upon the above findings, we present READ, which facilitates LMMs' resilient $\textbf{REA}$soning capability of where to atten$\textbf{D}$ under the guidance of highly activated points borrowed from similarity maps. Remarkably, READ features an intuitive design, Similarity as Points module (SasP), which can be seamlessly applied to $\texttt{<SEG>}$-like paradigms in a plug-and-play fashion. Also, extensive experiments have been conducted on the ReasonSeg and RefCOCO(+/g) datasets. To validate whether READ suffers from catastrophic forgetting of previous skills after fine-tuning, we further assess its generation ability on an augmented FP-RefCOCO(+/g) dataset. All codes and models are publicly available at https://github.com/rui-qian/READ.

### Measuring and identifying factors of individuals' trust in Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Edoardo Sebastiano De Duro, Giuseppe Alessandro Veltri, Hudson Golino, Massimo Stella

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T15:52:43Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) can engage in human-looking conversational exchanges. Although conversations can elicit trust between users and LLMs, scarce empirical research has examined trust formation in human-LLM contexts, beyond LLMs' trustworthiness or human trust in AI in general. Here, we introduce the Trust-In-LLMs Index (TILLMI) as a new framework to measure individuals' trust in LLMs, extending McAllister's cognitive and affective trust dimensions to LLM-human interactions. We developed TILLMI as a psychometric scale, prototyped with a novel protocol we called LLM-simulated validity. The LLM-based scale was then validated in a sample of 1,000 US respondents. Exploratory Factor Analysis identified a two-factor structure. Two items were then removed due to redundancy, yielding a final 6-item scale with a 2-factor structure. Confirmatory Factor Analysis on a separate subsample showed strong model fit ($CFI = .995$, $TLI = .991$, $RMSEA = .046$, $p_{X^2} > .05$). Convergent validity analysis revealed that trust in LLMs correlated positively with openness to experience, extraversion, and cognitive flexibility, but negatively with neuroticism. Based on these findings, we interpreted TILLMI's factors as "closeness with LLMs" (affective dimension) and "reliance on LLMs" (cognitive dimension). Younger males exhibited higher closeness with- and reliance on LLMs compared to older women. Individuals with no direct experience with LLMs exhibited lower levels of trust compared to LLMs' users. These findings offer a novel empirical foundation for measuring trust in AI-driven verbal communication, informing responsible design, and fostering balanced human-AI collaboration.

### Large language models in finance: estimating financial sentiment for   stock prediction
**Authors**: Kemal Kirtac, Guido Germano

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T15:51:25Z

**Summary**: Financial sentiment analysis has become a central tool in market forecasting, with an increasing number of academic studies incorporating sentiment measures into financial prediction models. I investigate the origins and use of sentiment measures in finance, tracing their evolution from market-based and lexicon-based approaches to advanced natural language processing techniques. The emergence of large language models has significantly improved the accuracy and depth of sentiment estimation. I examine how BERT-based models, such as RoBERTa and FinBERT, are optimized for structured sentiment classification, while GPT-based models, including GPT-4, OPT, and LLaMA, are more effective for financial text generation and real-time sentiment interpretation. A comparative analysis of bidirectional and autoregressive transformer architectures highlights their respective advantages in algorithmic trading, investor sentiment analysis, and financial decision-making. Hybrid approaches that combine classification and generative capabilities enhance predictive performance in sentiment-driven trading strategies. Findings underscore the increasing role of LLMs in financial sentiment analysis, enabling more nuanced, context-aware sentiment extraction from financial news, earnings reports, and social media data.

### Enhancing the Accuracy and Comprehensibility in Architectural Tactics   Detection via Small Model-Augmented Prompt Engineering
**Authors**: Lingli Cao, He Zhang, Shanshan Li, Danyang Li, Yanjing Yang, Chenxing Zhong, Xin Zhou, Yue Xie

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T15:47:22Z

**Summary**: Architectural tactics (ATs), as the concrete implementation of architectural decisions in code, address non-functional requirements of software systems. Due to the implicit nature of architectural knowledge in code implementation, developers may risk inadvertently altering or removing these tactics during code modifications or optimizations. Such unintended changes can trigger architectural erosion, gradually undermining the system's original design. While many researchers have proposed machine learning-based methods to improve the accuracy of detecting ATs in code, the black-box nature and the required architectural domain knowledge pose significant challenges for developers in verifying the results. Effective verification requires not only accurate detection results but also interpretable explanations that enhance their comprehensibility. However, this is a critical gap in current research. Large language models (LLMs) can generate easily interpretable ATs detection comments if they have domain knowledge. Fine-tuning LLMs to acquire domain knowledge faces challenges such as catastrophic forgetting and hardware constraints. Thus, we propose Prmt4TD, a small model-augmented prompting framework to enhance the accuracy and comprehensibility of ATs detection. Combining fine-tuned small models with In-Context Learning can also reduce fine-tuning costs while equipping the LLM with additional domain knowledge. Prmt4TD can leverage the remarkable processing and reasoning capabilities of LLMs to generate easily interpretable ATs detection results. Our evaluation results demonstrate that Prmt4TD achieves accuracy (\emph{F1-score}) improvement of 13\%-23\% on the ATs balanced dataset and enhances the comprehensibility of the detection results.

### Psy-Insight: Explainable Multi-turn Bilingual Dataset for Mental Health   Counseling
**Authors**: Keqi Chen, Zekai Sun, Yuhua Wen, Huijun Lian, Yingming Gao, Ya Li

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T15:44:21Z

**Summary**: The in-context learning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) show great potential in mental health support. However, the lack of counseling datasets, particularly in Chinese corpora, restricts their application in this field. To address this, we constructed Psy-Insight, the first mental health-oriented explainable multi-task bilingual dataset. We collected face-to-face multi-turn counseling dialogues, which are annotated with multi-task labels and conversation process explanations. Our annotations include psychotherapy, emotion, strategy, and topic labels, as well as turn-level reasoning and session-level guidance. Psy-Insight is not only suitable for tasks such as label recognition but also meets the need for training LLMs to act as empathetic counselors through logical reasoning. Experiments show that training LLMs on Psy-Insight enables the models to not only mimic the conversation style but also understand the underlying strategies and reasoning of counseling.

### Feature-Level Insights into Artificial Text Detection with Sparse   Autoencoders
**Authors**: Kristian Kuznetsov, Laida Kushnareva, Polina Druzhinina, Anton Razzhigaev, Anastasia Voznyuk, Irina Piontkovskaya, Evgeny Burnaev, Serguei Barannikov

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T15:33:52Z

**Summary**: Artificial Text Detection (ATD) is becoming increasingly important with the rise of advanced Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite numerous efforts, no single algorithm performs consistently well across different types of unseen text or guarantees effective generalization to new LLMs. Interpretability plays a crucial role in achieving this goal. In this study, we enhance ATD interpretability by using Sparse Autoencoders (SAE) to extract features from Gemma-2-2b residual stream. We identify both interpretable and efficient features, analyzing their semantics and relevance through domain- and model-specific statistics, a steering approach, and manual or LLM-based interpretation. Our methods offer valuable insights into how texts from various models differ from human-written content. We show that modern LLMs have a distinct writing style, especially in information-dense domains, even though they can produce human-like outputs with personalized prompts.

### Small but Mighty: Enhancing Time Series Forecasting with Lightweight   LLMs
**Authors**: Haoran Fan, Bin Li, Yixuan Weng, Shoujun Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T15:27:36Z

**Summary**: While LLMs have demonstrated remarkable potential in time series forecasting, their practical deployment remains constrained by excessive computational demands and memory footprints. Existing LLM-based approaches typically suffer from three critical limitations: Inefficient parameter utilization in handling numerical time series patterns; Modality misalignment between continuous temporal signals and discrete text embeddings; and Inflexibility for real-time expert knowledge integration. We present SMETimes, the first systematic investigation of sub-3B parameter SLMs for efficient and accurate time series forecasting. Our approach centers on three key innovations: A statistically-enhanced prompting mechanism that bridges numerical time series with textual semantics through descriptive statistical features; A adaptive fusion embedding architecture that aligns temporal patterns with language model token spaces through learnable parameters; And a dynamic mixture-of-experts framework enabled by SLMs' computational efficiency, adaptively combining base predictions with domain-specific models. Extensive evaluations across seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that our 3B-parameter SLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on five primary datasets while maintaining 3.8x faster training and 5.2x lower memory consumption compared to 7B-parameter LLM baselines. Notably, the proposed model exhibits better learning capabilities, achieving 12.3% lower MSE than conventional LLM. Ablation studies validate that our statistical prompting and cross-modal fusion modules respectively contribute 15.7% and 18.2% error reduction in long-horizon forecasting tasks. By redefining the efficiency-accuracy trade-off landscape, this work establishes SLMs as viable alternatives to resource-intensive LLMs for practical time series forecasting. Code and models are available at https://github.com/xiyan1234567/SMETimes.

### English K_Quantization of LLMs Does Not Disproportionately Diminish   Multilingual Performance
**Authors**: Karl Audun Borgersen

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T15:26:59Z

**Summary**: For consumer usage of locally deployed LLMs, the GGUF format and k_quantization are invaluable tools for maintaining the performance of the original model while reducing it to sizes deployable with consumer-grade hardware. The number of bits dedicated to each weight from the original model is reduced based on how important they are thought to be during model inference. This importance is arrived at through the application of an 'importance matrix'-a relatively small text document meant to be representative of the LLM's standard use-cases. In the vast majority of quants available online, this document is primarily written in English. It was therefore an open question whether performance on English language tasks was preserved through the sacrifice of multilingual performance and whether it can be preserved with alternate importance matrices. This article investigates these hypotheses by quantizing Llama3.3 70B on importance matrices written in three languages (English, Norwegian, and Malayalam) and evaluating them on the MixEval dataset in both English and Norwegian. All experiments related to k_quantization yielded non-significant results (In all cases p > 0.237) indicating that current quantization practices do not disproportionately harm multilingual performance.

**Summary**: The research in AI-based formal mathematical reasoning has shown an unstoppable growth trend. These studies have excelled in mathematical competitions like IMO and have made significant progress. This paper focuses on formal verification, an immediate application scenario of formal reasoning, and breaks it down into sub-tasks. We constructed 18k high-quality instruction-response pairs across five formal specification languages (Coq, Lean4, Dafny, ACSL, and TLA+) by distilling gpt-4o and evaluated against ten open-sourced LLMs, including recent popular DeepSeek-R1. We also fine-tuned several 7~8B small models to achieve comparable performance with Deepseek-R1-671B. Interestingly, we observed that fine-tuning with formal data also enhances mathematics, reasoning, and coding capabilities. Fine-tuned models are released at https: //huggingface.co/fm-universe.

**Authors**: Lida Chen, Dong Xu, Chenxin An, Xintao Wang, Yikai Zhang, Jiangjie Chen, Zujie Liang, Feng Wei, Jiaqing Liang, Yanghua Xiao, Wei Wang

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T15:24:11Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) face efficiency bottlenecks due to the quadratic complexity of the attention mechanism when processing long contexts. Sparse attention methods offer a promising solution, but existing approaches often suffer from incomplete effective context and/or require complex implementation of pipeline. We present a comprehensive analysis of sparse attention for autoregressive LLMs from the respective of receptive field, recognize the suboptimal nature of existing methods for expanding the receptive field, and introduce PowerAttention, a novel sparse attention design that facilitates effective and complete context extension through the theoretical analysis. PowerAttention achieves exponential receptive field growth in $d$-layer LLMs, allowing each output token to attend to $2^d$ tokens, ensuring completeness and continuity of the receptive field. Experiments demonstrate that PowerAttention outperforms existing static sparse attention methods by $5\sim 40\%$, especially on tasks demanding long-range dependencies like Passkey Retrieval and RULER, while maintaining a comparable time complexity to sliding window attention. Efficiency evaluations further highlight PowerAttention's superior speedup in both prefilling and decoding phases compared with dynamic sparse attentions and full attention ($3.0\times$ faster on 128K context), making it a highly effective and user-friendly solution for processing long sequences in LLMs.

**Authors**: Paul Stangel, David Bani-Harouni, Chantal Pellegrini, Ege Özsoy, Kamilia Zaripova, Matthias Keicher, Nassir Navab

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T15:23:16Z

**Summary**: A safe and trustworthy use of Large Language Models (LLMs) requires an accurate expression of confidence in their answers. We introduce a novel Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach for LLM calibration that fine-tunes LLMs to elicit calibrated confidence estimations in their answers to factual questions. We model the problem as a betting game where the model predicts a confidence score together with every answer, and design a reward function that penalizes both over and under-confidence. We prove that under our reward design an optimal policy would result in a perfectly calibrated confidence estimation. Our experiments demonstrate significantly improved confidence calibration and generalization to new tasks without re-training, indicating that our approach teaches a general confidence awareness. This approach enables the training of inherently calibrated LLMs.

**Authors**: Vincent Freiberger, Arthur Fleig, Erik Buchmann

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T15:22:35Z

**Summary**: Protecting online privacy requires users to engage with and comprehend website privacy policies, but many policies are difficult and tedious to read. We present the first qualitative user study on Large Language Model (LLM)-driven privacy policy assessment. To this end, we build and evaluate an LLM-based privacy policy assessment browser extension, which helps users understand the essence of a lengthy, complex privacy policy while browsing. The tool integrates a dashboard and an LLM chat. In our qualitative user study (N=22), we evaluate usability, understandability of the information our tool provides, and its impacts on awareness. While providing a comprehensible quick overview and a chat for in-depth discussion improves privacy awareness, users note issues with building trust in the tool. From our insights, we derive important design implications to guide future policy analysis tools.

### Benchmarking LLMs and LLM-based Agents in Practical Vulnerability   Detection for Code Repositories
**Authors**: Alperen Yildiz, Sin G. Teo, Yiling Lou, Yebo Feng, Chong Wang, Dinil M. Divakaran

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T15:22:24Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in software vulnerability detection, particularly on function-level benchmarks like Devign and BigVul. However, real-world detection requires interprocedural analysis, as vulnerabilities often emerge through multi-hop function calls rather than isolated functions. While repository-level benchmarks like ReposVul and VulEval introduce interprocedural context, they remain computationally expensive, lack pairwise evaluation of vulnerability fixes, and explore limited context retrieval, limiting their practicality.   We introduce JitVul, a JIT vulnerability detection benchmark linking each function to its vulnerability-introducing and fixing commits. Built from 879 CVEs spanning 91 vulnerability types, JitVul enables comprehensive evaluation of detection capabilities. Our results show that ReAct Agents, leveraging thought-action-observation and interprocedural context, perform better than LLMs in distinguishing vulnerable from benign code. While prompting strategies like Chain-of-Thought help LLMs, ReAct Agents require further refinement. Both methods show inconsistencies, either misidentifying vulnerabilities or over-analyzing security guards, indicating significant room for improvement.

**Authors**: Francesco Pasti, Riccardo De Monte, Davide Dalle Pezze, Gian Antonio Susto, Nicola Bellotto

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T14:49:21Z

**Summary**: Detecting objects in mobile robotics is crucial for numerous applications, from autonomous navigation to inspection. However, robots often need to operate in different domains from those they were trained in, requiring them to adjust to these changes. Tiny mobile robots, subject to size, power, and computational constraints, encounter even more difficulties in running and adapting these algorithms. Such adaptability, though, is crucial for real-world deployment, where robots must operate effectively in dynamic and unpredictable settings. In this work, we introduce a novel benchmark to evaluate the continual learning capabilities of object detection systems in tiny robotic platforms. Our contributions include: (i) Tiny Robotics Object Detection~(TiROD), a comprehensive dataset collected using the onboard camera of a small mobile robot, designed to test object detectors across various domains and classes; (ii) a benchmark of different continual learning strategies on this dataset using NanoDet, a lightweight object detector. Our results highlight key challenges in developing robust and efficient continual learning strategies for object detectors in tiny robotics.

### Survey Respondent Surrogates? Probing Objective and Subjective Silicon   Population
**Authors**: Muzhi Zhou, Lu Yu, Xiaomin Geng, Lan Luo

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T14:44:53Z

**Summary**: Recent discussions about Large Language Models (LLMs) indicate that they have the potential to simulate human responses in social surveys and generate reliable predictions, such as those found in political polls. However, the existing findings are highly inconsistent, leaving us uncertain about the population characteristics of data generated by LLMs. In this paper, we employ repeated random sampling to create sampling distributions that identify the population parameters of silicon samples generated by GPT. Our findings show that GPT's demographic distribution aligns with the 2020 U.S. population in terms of gender and average age. However, GPT significantly overestimates the representation of the Black population and individuals with higher levels of education, even when it possesses accurate knowledge. Furthermore, GPT's point estimates for attitudinal scores are highly inconsistent and show no clear inclination toward any particular ideology. The sample response distributions exhibit a normal pattern that diverges significantly from those of human respondents. Consistent with previous studies, we find that GPT's answers are more deterministic than those of humans. We conclude by discussing the concerning implications of this biased and deterministic silicon population for making inferences about real-world populations.

**Authors**: Xiaomeng Zhu, Yuyang Li, Leiyao Cui, Pengfei Li, Huan-ang Gao, Yixin Zhu, Hao Zhao

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T14:44:53Z

**Summary**: Object affordance reasoning, the ability to infer object functionalities based on physical properties, is fundamental for task-oriented planning and activities in both humans and Artificial Intelligence (AI). This capability, required for planning and executing daily activities in a task-oriented manner, relies on commonsense knowledge of object physics and functionalities, extending beyond simple object recognition. Current computational models for affordance reasoning from perception lack generalizability, limiting their applicability in novel scenarios. Meanwhile, comprehensive Large Language Models (LLMs) with emerging reasoning capabilities are challenging to deploy on local devices for task-oriented manipulations. Here, we introduce LVIS-Aff, a large-scale dataset comprising 1,496 tasks and 119k images, designed to enhance the generalizability of affordance reasoning from perception. Utilizing this dataset, we develop Afford-X, an end-to-end trainable affordance reasoning model that incorporates Verb Attention and Bi-Fusion modules to improve multi-modal understanding. This model achieves up to a 12.1% performance improvement over the best-reported results from non-LLM methods, while also demonstrating a 1.2% enhancement compared to our previous conference paper. Additionally, it maintains a compact 187M parameter size and infers nearly 50 times faster than the GPT-4V API. Our work demonstrates the potential for efficient, generalizable affordance reasoning models that can be deployed on local devices for task-oriented manipulations. We showcase Afford-X's effectiveness in enabling task-oriented manipulations for robots across various tasks and environments, underscoring its efficiency and broad implications for advancing robotics and AI systems in real-world applications.

### VideoWorld: Exploring Knowledge Learning from Unlabeled Videos
**Authors**: Zhongwei Ren, Yunchao Wei, Xun Guo, Yao Zhao, Bingyi Kang, Jiashi Feng, Xiaojie Jin

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T14:44:18Z

**Summary**: This work explores whether a deep generative model can learn complex knowledge solely from visual input, in contrast to the prevalent focus on text-based models like large language models (LLMs). We develop VideoWorld, an auto-regressive video generation model trained on unlabeled video data, and test its knowledge acquisition abilities in video-based Go and robotic control tasks. Our experiments reveal two key findings: (1) video-only training provides sufficient information for learning knowledge, including rules, reasoning and planning capabilities, and (2) the representation of visual change is crucial for knowledge acquisition. To improve both the efficiency and efficacy of this process, we introduce the Latent Dynamics Model (LDM) as a key component of VideoWorld. Remarkably, VideoWorld reaches a 5-dan professional level in the Video-GoBench with just a 300-million-parameter model, without relying on search algorithms or reward mechanisms typical in reinforcement learning. In robotic tasks, VideoWorld effectively learns diverse control operations and generalizes across environments, approaching the performance of oracle models in CALVIN and RLBench. This study opens new avenues for knowledge acquisition from visual data, with all code, data, and models open-sourced for further research.

### LLMs can be Dangerous Reasoners: Analyzing-based Jailbreak Attack on   Large Language Models
**Authors**: Shi Lin, Hongming Yang, Dingyang Lin, Rongchang Li, Xun Wang, Changting Lin, Wenpeng Xing, Meng Han

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T14:43:33Z

**Summary**: The rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has brought significant advancements across various tasks. However, despite these achievements, LLMs still exhibit inherent safety vulnerabilities, especially when confronted with jailbreak attacks. Existing jailbreak methods suffer from two main limitations: reliance on complicated prompt engineering and iterative optimization, which lead to low attack success rate (ASR) and attack efficiency (AE). In this work, we propose an efficient jailbreak attack method, Analyzing-based Jailbreak (ABJ), which leverages the advanced reasoning capability of LLMs to autonomously generate harmful content, revealing their underlying safety vulnerabilities during complex reasoning process. We conduct comprehensive experiments on ABJ across various open-source and closed-source LLMs. In particular, ABJ achieves high ASR (82.1% on GPT-4o-2024-11-20) with exceptional AE among all target LLMs, showcasing its remarkable attack effectiveness, transferability, and efficiency. Our findings underscore the urgent need to prioritize and improve the safety of LLMs to mitigate the risks of misuse.

### Online Scheduling for LLM Inference with KV Cache Constraints
**Authors**: Patrick Jaillet, Jiashuo Jiang, Chara Podimata, Zijie Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T14:43:01Z

**Summary**: Large Language Model (LLM) inference, where a trained model generates text one word at a time in response to user prompts, is a computationally intensive process requiring efficient scheduling to optimize latency and resource utilization. A key challenge in LLM inference is the management of the Key-Value (KV) cache, which reduces redundant computations but introduces memory constraints. In this work, we model LLM inference with KV cache constraints theoretically and propose novel batching and scheduling algorithms that minimize inference latency while effectively managing the KV cache's memory.   We analyze both semi-online and fully online scheduling models, and our results are threefold. First, we provide a polynomial-time algorithm that achieves exact optimality in terms of average latency in the semi-online prompt arrival model. Second, in the fully online case with a stochastic prompt arrival, we introduce an efficient online scheduling algorithm with constant regret. Third, we prove that no algorithm (deterministic or randomized) can achieve a constant competitive ratio in fully online adversarial settings. Our empirical evaluations on a public LLM inference dataset, using the Llama-70B model on A100 GPUs, show that our approach significantly outperforms benchmark algorithms used currently in practice, achieving lower latency while reducing energy consumption. Overall, our results offer a path toward more sustainable and cost-effective LLM deployment.

**Authors**: Alberto Purpura, Sahil Wadhwa, Jesse Zymet, Akshay Gupta, Andy Luo, Melissa Kazemi Rad, Swapnil Shinde, Mohammad Shahed Sorower

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T14:41:38Z

**Summary**: The rapid growth of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents significant privacy, security, and ethical concerns. While much research has proposed methods for defending LLM systems against misuse by malicious actors, researchers have recently complemented these efforts with an offensive approach that involves red teaming, i.e., proactively attacking LLMs with the purpose of identifying their vulnerabilities. This paper provides a concise and practical overview of the LLM red teaming literature, structured so as to describe a multi-component system end-to-end. To motivate red teaming we survey the initial safety needs of some high-profile LLMs, and then dive into the different components of a red teaming system as well as software packages for implementing them. We cover various attack methods, strategies for attack-success evaluation, metrics for assessing experiment outcomes, as well as a host of other considerations. Our survey will be useful for any reader who wants to rapidly obtain a grasp of the major red teaming concepts for their own use in practical applications.

**Authors**: Yuncheng Hua, Lizhen Qu, Zhuang Li, Hao Xue, Flora D. Salim, Gholamreza Haffari

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T14:38:19Z

**Summary**: Alignment tuning is crucial for ensuring large language models (LLMs) behave ethically and helpfully. Current alignment approaches require high-quality annotations and significant training resources. This paper proposes a low-cost, tuning-free method using in-context learning (ICL) to enhance LLM alignment. Through an analysis of high-quality ICL demos, we identified style as a key factor influencing LLM alignment capabilities and explicitly restyled ICL exemplars based on this stylistic framework. Additionally, we combined the restyled demos to achieve a balance between the two conflicting aspects of LLM alignment--factuality and safety. We packaged the restyled examples as prompts to trigger few-shot learning, improving LLM alignment. Compared to the best baseline approach, with an average score of 5.00 as the maximum, our method achieves a maximum 0.10 increase on the Alpaca task (from 4.50 to 4.60), a 0.22 enhancement on the Just-eval benchmark (from 4.34 to 4.56), and a maximum improvement of 0.32 (from 3.53 to 3.85) on the MT-Bench dataset. We release the code and data at https://github.com/AnonymousCode-ComputerScience/RIDE.

### Human-Agent Interaction in Synthetic Social Networks: A Framework for   Studying Online Polarization
**Authors**: Tim Donkers, Jürgen Ziegler

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T14:35:51Z

**Summary**: Online social networks have dramatically altered the landscape of public discourse, creating both opportunities for enhanced civic participation and risks of deepening social divisions. Prevalent approaches to studying online polarization have been limited by a methodological disconnect: mathematical models excel at formal analysis but lack linguistic realism, while language model-based simulations capture natural discourse but often sacrifice analytical precision. This paper introduces an innovative computational framework that synthesizes these approaches by embedding formal opinion dynamics principles within LLM-based artificial agents, enabling both rigorous mathematical analysis and naturalistic social interactions. We validate our framework through comprehensive offline testing and experimental evaluation with 122 human participants engaging in a controlled social network environment. The results demonstrate our ability to systematically investigate polarization mechanisms while preserving ecological validity. Our findings reveal how polarized environments shape user perceptions and behavior: participants exposed to polarized discussions showed markedly increased sensitivity to emotional content and group affiliations, while perceiving reduced uncertainty in the agents' positions. By combining mathematical precision with natural language capabilities, our framework opens new avenues for investigating social media phenomena through controlled experimentation. This methodological advancement allows researchers to bridge the gap between theoretical models and empirical observations, offering unprecedented opportunities to study the causal mechanisms underlying online opinion dynamics.

### BHViT: Binarized Hybrid Vision Transformer
**Authors**: Tian Gao, Zhiyuan Zhang, Yu Zhang, Huajun Liu, Kaijie Yin, Chengzhong Xu, Hui Kong

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T14:25:37Z

**Summary**: Model binarization has made significant progress in enabling real-time and energy-efficient computation for convolutional neural networks (CNN), offering a potential solution to the deployment challenges faced by Vision Transformers (ViTs) on edge devices. However, due to the structural differences between CNN and Transformer architectures, simply applying binary CNN strategies to the ViT models will lead to a significant performance drop. To tackle this challenge, we propose BHViT, a binarization-friendly hybrid ViT architecture and its full binarization model with the guidance of three important observations. Initially, BHViT utilizes the local information interaction and hierarchical feature aggregation technique from coarse to fine levels to address redundant computations stemming from excessive tokens. Then, a novel module based on shift operations is proposed to enhance the performance of the binary Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) module without significantly increasing computational overhead. In addition, an innovative attention matrix binarization method based on quantization decomposition is proposed to evaluate the token's importance in the binarized attention matrix. Finally, we propose a regularization loss to address the inadequate optimization caused by the incompatibility between the weight oscillation in the binary layers and the Adam Optimizer. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm achieves SOTA performance among binary ViT methods.

### From Sparse Dependence to Sparse Attention: Unveiling How   Chain-of-Thought Enhances Transformer Sample Efficiency
**Authors**: Kaiyue Wen, Huaqing Zhang, Hongzhou Lin, Jingzhao Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T13:57:56Z

**Summary**: Chain-of-thought (CoT) significantly enhances the reasoning performance of large language models (LLM). While current theoretical studies often attribute this improvement to increased expressiveness and computational capacity, we argue that expressiveness is not the primary limitation in the LLM regime, as current large models will fail on simple tasks. Using a parity-learning setup, we demonstrate that CoT can substantially improve sample efficiency even when the representation power is sufficient. Specifically, with CoT, a transformer can learn the function within polynomial samples, whereas without CoT, the required sample size is exponential. Additionally, we show that CoT simplifies the learning process by introducing sparse sequential dependencies among input tokens, and leads to a sparse and interpretable attention. We validate our theoretical analysis with both synthetic and real-world experiments, confirming that sparsity in attention layers is a key factor of the improvement induced by CoT.

### Learn from the Past: Language-conditioned Object Rearrangement with   Large Language Models
**Authors**: Guanqun Cao, Ryan Mckenna, Erich Graf, John Oyekan

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T13:54:04Z

**Summary**: Object manipulation for rearrangement into a specific goal state is a significant task for collaborative robots. Accurately determining object placement is a key challenge, as misalignment can increase task complexity and the risk of collisions, affecting the efficiency of the rearrangement process. Most current methods heavily rely on pre-collected datasets to train the model for predicting the goal position. As a result, these methods are restricted to specific instructions, which limits their broader applicability and generalisation. In this paper, we propose a framework of flexible language-conditioned object rearrangement based on the Large Language Model (LLM). Our approach mimics human reasoning by making use of successful past experiences as a reference to infer the best strategies to achieve a current desired goal position. Based on LLM's strong natural language comprehension and inference ability, our method generalises to handle various everyday objects and free-form language instructions in a zero-shot manner. Experimental results demonstrate that our methods can effectively execute the robotic rearrangement tasks, even those involving long sequences of orders.

### Parallelized Planning-Acting for Efficient LLM-based Multi-Agent Systems
**Authors**: Yaoru Li, Shunyu Liu, Tongya Zheng, Mingli Song

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T13:53:10Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in Large Language Model(LLM)-based Multi-Agent Systems(MAS) have demonstrated remarkable potential for tackling complex decision-making tasks. However, existing frameworks inevitably rely on serialized execution paradigms, where agents must complete sequential LLM planning before taking action. This fundamental constraint severely limits real-time responsiveness and adaptation, which is crucial in dynamic environments with ever-changing scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel parallelized planning-acting framework for LLM-based MAS, featuring a dual-thread architecture with interruptible execution to enable concurrent planning and acting. Specifically, our framework comprises two core threads:(1) a planning thread driven by a centralized memory system, maintaining synchronization of environmental states and agent communication to support dynamic decision-making; and (2) an acting thread equipped with a comprehensive skill library, enabling automated task execution through recursive decomposition. Extensive experiments on challenging Minecraft demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

### Collaborative Expert LLMs Guided Multi-Objective Molecular Optimization
**Authors**: Jiajun Yu, Yizhen Zheng, Huan Yee Koh, Shirui Pan, Tianyue Wang, Haishuai Wang

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T13:47:55Z

**Summary**: Molecular optimization is a crucial yet complex and time-intensive process that often acts as a bottleneck for drug development. Traditional methods rely heavily on trial and error, making multi-objective optimization both time-consuming and resource-intensive. Current AI-based methods have shown limited success in handling multi-objective optimization tasks, hampering their practical utilization. To address this challenge, we present MultiMol, a collaborative large language model (LLM) system designed to guide multi-objective molecular optimization. MultiMol comprises two agents, including a data-driven worker agent and a literature-guided research agent. The data-driven worker agent is a large language model being fine-tuned to learn how to generate optimized molecules considering multiple objectives, while the literature-guided research agent is responsible for searching task-related literature to find useful prior knowledge that facilitates identifying the most promising optimized candidates. In evaluations across six multi-objective optimization tasks, MultiMol significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving a 82.30% success rate, in sharp contrast to the 27.50% success rate of current strongest methods. To further validate its practical impact, we tested MultiMol on two real-world challenges. First, we enhanced the selectivity of Xanthine Amine Congener (XAC), a promiscuous ligand that binds both A1R and A2AR, successfully biasing it towards A1R. Second, we improved the bioavailability of Saquinavir, an HIV-1 protease inhibitor with known bioavailability limitations. Overall, these results indicate that MultiMol represents a highly promising approach for multi-objective molecular optimization, holding great potential to accelerate the drug development process and contribute to the advancement of pharmaceutical research.

### CURVALID: Geometrically-guided Adversarial Prompt Detection
**Authors**: Canaan Yung, Hanxun Huang, Sarah Monazam Erfani, Christopher Leckie

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T13:47:53Z

**Summary**: Adversarial prompts capable of jailbreaking large language models (LLMs) and inducing undesirable behaviours pose a significant obstacle to their safe deployment. Current mitigation strategies rely on activating built-in defence mechanisms or fine-tuning the LLMs, but the fundamental distinctions between adversarial and benign prompts are yet to be understood. In this work, we introduce CurvaLID, a novel defense framework that efficiently detects adversarial prompts by leveraging their geometric properties. It is agnostic to the type of LLM, offering a unified detection framework across diverse adversarial prompts and LLM architectures. CurvaLID builds on the geometric analysis of text prompts to uncover their underlying differences. We theoretically extend the concept of curvature via the Whewell equation into an $n$-dimensional word embedding space, enabling us to quantify local geometric properties, including semantic shifts and curvature in the underlying manifolds. Additionally, we employ Local Intrinsic Dimensionality (LID) to capture geometric features of text prompts within adversarial subspaces. Our findings reveal that adversarial prompts differ fundamentally from benign prompts in terms of their geometric characteristics. Our results demonstrate that CurvaLID delivers superior detection and rejection of adversarial queries, paving the way for safer LLM deployment.

### Topo Goes Political: TDA-Based Controversy Detection in Imbalanced   Reddit Political Data
**Authors**: Arvindh Arun, Karuna K Chandra, Akshit Sinha, Balakumar Velayutham, Jashn Arora, Manish Jain, Ponnurangam Kumaraguru

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T13:46:39Z

**Summary**: The detection of controversial content in political discussions on the Internet is a critical challenge in maintaining healthy digital discourse. Unlike much of the existing literature that relies on synthetically balanced data, our work preserves the natural distribution of controversial and non-controversial posts. This real-world imbalance highlights a core challenge that needs to be addressed for practical deployment. Our study re-evaluates well-established methods for detecting controversial content. We curate our own dataset focusing on the Indian political context that preserves the natural distribution of controversial content, with only 12.9% of the posts in our dataset being controversial. This disparity reflects the true imbalance in real-world political discussions and highlights a critical limitation in the existing evaluation methods. Benchmarking on datasets that model data imbalance is vital for ensuring real-world applicability. Thus, in this work, (i) we release our dataset, with an emphasis on class imbalance, that focuses on the Indian political context, (ii) we evaluate existing methods from this domain on this dataset and demonstrate their limitations in the imbalanced setting, (iii) we introduce an intuitive metric to measure a model's robustness to class imbalance, (iv) we also incorporate ideas from the domain of Topological Data Analysis, specifically Persistent Homology, to curate features that provide richer representations of the data. Furthermore, we benchmark models trained with topological features against established baselines.

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T13:16:55Z

**Summary**: Vision-language-action models (VLAs) have shown great potential as generalist robot policies. However, these models pose urgent safety challenges during deployment, including the risk of physical harm to the environment, the robot itself, and humans. How can safety be explicitly incorporated into VLAs? In this work, we propose SafeVLA, a novel algorithm designed to integrate safety into VLAs, ensuring the protection of the environment, robot hardware and humans in real-world settings. SafeVLA effectively balances safety and task performance by employing large-scale constrained learning within simulated environments. We demonstrate that SafeVLA outperforms the current state-of-the-art method in both safety and task performance, achieving average improvements of 83.58% and 3.85%, respectively, in simulation. By prioritizing safety, our approach eliminates high-risk behaviors and reduces the upper bound of unsafe behaviors to 1/35 of that in the current state-of-the-art, thereby significantly mitigating long-tail risks. Furthermore, the learned safety constraints generalize to diverse, unseen scenarios, including multiple out-of-distribution perturbations and tasks. Our data, models and newly proposed benchmark environment are available at https://sites.google.com/view/pku-safevla.

### Enhancing Non-English Capabilities of English-Centric Large Language   Models through Deep Supervision Fine-Tuning
**Authors**: Wenshuai Huo, Xiaocheng Feng, Yichong Huang, Chengpeng Fu, Baohang Li, Yangfan Ye, Zhirui Zhang, Dandan Tu, Duyu Tang, Yunfei Lu, Hui Wang, Bing Qin

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T13:10:07Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant progress in multilingual language understanding and generation. However, due to the imbalance in training data, their capabilities in non-English languages are limited. Recent studies revealed the English-pivot multilingual mechanism of LLMs, where LLMs implicitly convert non-English queries into English ones at the bottom layers and adopt English for thinking at the middle layers. However, due to the absence of explicit supervision for cross-lingual alignment in the intermediate layers of LLMs, the internal representations during these stages may become inaccurate. In this work, we introduce a deep supervision fine-tuning method (DFT) that incorporates additional supervision in the internal layers of the model to guide its workflow. Specifically, we introduce two training objectives on different layers of LLMs: one at the bottom layers to constrain the conversion of the target language into English, and another at the middle layers to constrain reasoning in English. To effectively achieve the guiding purpose, we designed two types of supervision signals: logits and feature, which represent a stricter constraint and a relatively more relaxed guidance. Our method guides the model to not only consider the final generated result when processing non-English inputs but also ensure the accuracy of internal representations. We conducted extensive experiments on typical English-centric large models, LLaMA-2 and Gemma-2, and the results on multiple multilingual datasets show that our method significantly outperforms traditional fine-tuning methods.

### Open-Source Large Language Models as Multilingual Crowdworkers:   Synthesizing Open-Domain Dialogues in Several Languages With No Examples in   Targets and No Machine Translation
**Authors**: Ahmed Njifenjou, Virgile Sucal, Bassam Jabaian, Fabrice Lefèvre

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T12:52:14Z

**Summary**: The prevailing paradigm in the domain of Open-Domain Dialogue agents predominantly focuses on the English language, encompassing both models and datasets. Furthermore, the financial and temporal investments required for crowdsourcing such datasets for finetuning are substantial, particularly when multiple languages are involved. Fortunately, advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have unveiled a plethora of possibilities across diverse tasks. Specifically, instruction-tuning has enabled LLMs to execute tasks based on natural language instructions, occasionally surpassing the performance of human crowdworkers. Additionally, these models possess the capability to function in various languages within a single thread. Consequently, to generate new samples in different languages, we propose leveraging these capabilities to replicate the data collection process. We introduce a pipeline for generating Open-Domain Dialogue data in multiple Target Languages using LLMs, with demonstrations provided in a unique Source Language. By eschewing explicit Machine Translation in this approach, we enhance the adherence to language-specific nuances. We apply this methodology to the PersonaChat dataset. To enhance the openness of generated dialogues and mimic real life scenarii, we added the notion of speech events corresponding to the type of conversation the speakers are involved in and also that of common ground which represents the premises of a conversation.

### Visualising Policy-Reward Interplay to Inform Zeroth-Order Preference   Optimisation of Large Language Models
**Authors**: Alessio Galatolo, Zhenbang Dai, Katie Winkle, Meriem Beloucif

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T12:49:48Z

**Summary**: Fine-tuning LLMs with first-order methods like back-propagation is computationally intensive. Zeroth-Order (ZO) optimisation, using function evaluations instead of gradients, reduces memory usage but suffers from slow convergence in high-dimensional models. As a result, ZO research in LLMs has mostly focused on classification, overlooking more complex generative tasks. In this paper, we introduce ZOPrO, a novel ZO algorithm designed for \textit{Preference Optimisation} in LLMs. We begin by analysing the interplay between policy and reward models during traditional (first-order) Preference Optimisation, uncovering patterns in their relative updates. Guided by these insights, we adapt Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA) with a targeted sampling strategy to accelerate convergence. Through experiments on summarisation, machine translation, and conversational assistants, we demonstrate that our method consistently enhances reward signals while achieving convergence times comparable to first-order methods. While it falls short of some state-of-the-art methods, our work is the first to apply Zeroth-Order methods to Preference Optimisation in LLMs, going beyond classification tasks and paving the way for a largely unexplored research direction.

### Unified Mind Model: Reimagining Autonomous Agents in the LLM Era
**Authors**: Pengbo Hu, Xiang Ying

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T12:49:44Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable capabilities across domains, tasks, and languages (e.g., ChatGPT and GPT-4), reviving the research of general autonomous agents with human-like cognitive abilities.Such human-level agents require semantic comprehension and instruction-following capabilities, which exactly fall into the strengths of LLMs.Although there have been several initial attempts to build human-level agents based on LLMs, the theoretical foundation remains a challenging open problem. In this paper, we propose a novel theoretical cognitive architecture, the Unified Mind Model (UMM), which offers guidance to facilitate the rapid creation of autonomous agents with human-level cognitive abilities. Specifically, our UMM starts with the global workspace theory and further leverage LLMs to enable the agent with various cognitive abilities, such as multi-modal perception, planning, reasoning, tool use, learning, memory, reflection and motivation. Building upon UMM, we then develop an agent-building engine, MindOS, which allows users to quickly create domain-/task-specific autonomous agents without any programming effort.

### Active Learning for Deep Learning-Based Hemodynamic Parameter Estimation
**Authors**: Patryk Rygiel, Julian Suk, Kak Khee Yeung, Christoph Brune, Jelmer M. Wolterink

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T12:35:54Z

**Summary**: Hemodynamic parameters such as pressure and wall shear stress play an important role in diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment planning in cardiovascular diseases. These parameters can be accurately computed using computational fluid dynamics (CFD), but CFD is computationally intensive. Hence, deep learning methods have been adopted as a surrogate to rapidly estimate CFD outcomes. A drawback of such data-driven models is the need for time-consuming reference CFD simulations for training. In this work, we introduce an active learning framework to reduce the number of CFD simulations required for the training of surrogate models, lowering the barriers to their deployment in new applications. We propose three distinct querying strategies to determine for which unlabeled samples CFD simulations should be obtained. These querying strategies are based on geometrical variance, ensemble uncertainty, and adherence to the physics governing fluid dynamics. We benchmark these methods on velocity field estimation in synthetic coronary artery bifurcations and find that they allow for substantial reductions in annotation cost. Notably, we find that our strategies reduce the number of samples required by up to 50% and make the trained models more robust to difficult cases. Our results show that active learning is a feasible strategy to increase the potential of deep learning-based CFD surrogates.

### Taxation Perspectives from Large Language Models: A Case Study on   Additional Tax Penalties
**Authors**: Eunkyung Choi, Young Jin Suh, Hun Park, Wonseok Hwang

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T12:24:20Z

**Summary**: How capable are large language models (LLMs) in the domain of taxation? Although numerous studies have explored the legal domain in general, research dedicated to taxation remain scarce. Moreover, the datasets used in these studies are either simplified, failing to reflect the real-world complexities, or unavailable as open source. To address this gap, we introduce PLAT, a new benchmark designed to assess the ability of LLMs to predict the legitimacy of additional tax penalties. PLAT is constructed to evaluate LLMs' understanding of tax law, particularly in cases where resolving the issue requires more than just applying related statutes. Our experiments with six LLMs reveal that their baseline capabilities are limited, especially when dealing with conflicting issues that demand a comprehensive understanding. However, we found that enabling retrieval, self-reasoning, and discussion among multiple agents with specific role assignments, this limitation can be mitigated.

### A Survey on LLM Test-Time Compute via Search: Tasks, LLM Profiling,   Search Algorithms, and Relevant Frameworks
**Authors**: Xinzhe Li

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T12:22:23Z

**Summary**: LLM test-time compute (or LLM inference) via search has emerged as a promising research area with rapid developments. However, current frameworks often adopt distinct perspectives on three key aspects (task definition, LLM profiling, and search procedures), making direct comparisons challenging. Moreover, the search algorithms employed often diverge from standard implementations, and their specific characteristics are not thoroughly specified. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive technical review that unifies task definitions and provides modular definitions of LLM profiling and search procedures. The definitions enable precise comparisons of various LLM inference frameworks while highlighting their departures from conventional search algorithms. We also discuss the applicability, performance, and efficiency of these methods. We have updated our content to include the latest papers, and the differences between versions are highlighted in the appendix. For further details and ongoing updates, please refer to our GitHub repository: https://github.com/xinzhel/LLM-Agent-Survey/blob/main/search.md

### Efficient Submap-based Autonomous MAV Exploration using Visual-Inertial   SLAM Configurable for LiDARs or Depth Cameras
**Authors**: Sotiris Papatheodorou, Simon Boche, Sebastián Barbas Laina, Stefan Leutenegger

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T12:17:56Z

**Summary**: Autonomous exploration of unknown space is an essential component for the deployment of mobile robots in the real world. Safe navigation is crucial for all robotics applications and requires accurate and consistent maps of the robot's surroundings. To achieve full autonomy and allow deployment in a wide variety of environments, the robot must rely on on-board state estimation which is prone to drift over time. We propose a Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV) exploration framework based on local submaps to allow retaining global consistency by applying loop-closure corrections to the relative submap poses. To enable large-scale exploration we efficiently compute global, environment-wide frontiers from the local submap frontiers and use a sampling-based next-best-view exploration planner. Our method seamlessly supports using either a LiDAR sensor or a depth camera, making it suitable for different kinds of MAV platforms. We perform comparative evaluations in simulation against a state-of-the-art submap-based exploration framework to showcase the efficiency and reconstruction quality of our approach. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of our method to real-world MAVs, one equipped with a LiDAR and the other with a depth camera. Video available at https://youtu.be/Uf5fwmYcuq4 .

### Beyond Content Relevance: Evaluating Instruction Following in Retrieval   Models
**Authors**: Jianqun Zhou, Yuanlei Zheng, Wei Chen, Qianqian Zheng, Hui Su, Wei Zhang, Rui Meng, Xiaoyu Shen

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T12:10:57Z

**Summary**: Instruction-following capabilities in LLMs have progressed significantly, enabling more complex user interactions through detailed prompts. However, retrieval systems have not matched these advances, most of them still relies on traditional lexical and semantic matching techniques that fail to fully capture user intent. Recent efforts have introduced instruction-aware retrieval models, but these primarily focus on intrinsic content relevance, which neglects the importance of customized preferences for broader document-level attributes. This study evaluates the instruction-following capabilities of various retrieval models beyond content relevance, including LLM-based dense retrieval and reranking models. We develop InfoSearch, a novel retrieval evaluation benchmark spanning six document-level attributes: Audience, Keyword, Format, Language, Length, and Source, and introduce novel metrics -- Strict Instruction Compliance Ratio (SICR) and Weighted Instruction Sensitivity Evaluation (WISE) to accurately assess the models' responsiveness to instructions. Our findings indicate that although fine-tuning models on instruction-aware retrieval datasets and increasing model size enhance performance, most models still fall short of instruction compliance.

### RASD: Retrieval-Augmented Speculative Decoding
**Authors**: Guofeng Quan, Wenfeng Feng, Chuzhan Hao, Guochao Jiang, Yuewei Zhang, Hao Wang

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T12:10:14Z

**Summary**: Speculative decoding accelerates inference in large language models (LLMs) by generating draft tokens for target model verification. Current approaches for obtaining draft tokens rely on lightweight draft models or additional model structures to generate draft tokens and retrieve context from databases. Due to the draft model's small size and limited training data, model-based speculative decoding frequently becomes less effective in out-of-domain scenarios. Additionally, the time cost of the drafting phase results in a low upper limit on acceptance length during the verification step, limiting overall efficiency. This paper proposes RASD (Retrieval-Augmented Speculative Decoding), which adopts retrieval methods to enhance model-based speculative decoding. We introduce tree pruning and tree fusion to achieve this. Specifically, we develop a pruning method based on the draft model's probability distribution to construct the optimal retrieval tree. Second, we employ the longest prefix matching algorithm to merge the tree generated by the draft model with the retrieval tree, resulting in a unified tree for verification. Experimental results demonstrate that RASD achieves state-of-the-art inference acceleration across tasks such as DocQA, Summary, Code, and In-Domain QA. Moreover, RASD exhibits strong scalability, seamlessly integrating with various speculative decoding approaches, including both generation-based and retrieval-based methods.

### LADDER: Self-Improving LLMs Through Recursive Problem Decomposition
**Authors**: Toby Simonds, Akira Yoshiyama

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T11:50:24Z

**Summary**: We introduce LADDER (Learning through Autonomous Difficulty-Driven Example Recursion), a framework which enables Large Language Models to autonomously improve their problem-solving capabilities through self-guided learning by recursively generating and solving progressively simpler variants of complex problems. Unlike prior approaches that require curated datasets or human feedback, LADDER leverages a model's own capabilities to generate easier question variants. We demonstrate LADDER's effectiveness in the subject of mathematical integration, improving Llama 3.2 3B's accuracy from 1% to 82% on undergraduate-level problems and enabling Qwen2.5 7B Deepseek-R1 Distilled to achieve 73% on the MIT Integration Bee qualifying examination. We also introduce TTRL (Test-Time Reinforcement Learning), where we perform reinforcement learning on variants of test problems at inference time. TTRL enables Qwen2.5 7B Deepseek-R1 Distilled to achieve a state-of-the-art score of 90% on the MIT Integration Bee qualifying examination, surpassing OpenAI o1's performance. These results show how self-directed strategic learning can achieve significant capability improvements without relying on architectural scaling or human supervision.

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T11:49:36Z

**Summary**: The rise of LLMs has deflected a growing portion of human-computer interactions towards LLM-based chatbots. The remarkable abilities of these models allow users to interact using long, diverse natural language text covering a wide range of topics and styles. Phrasing these messages is a time and effort consuming task, calling for an autocomplete solution to assist users. We introduce the task of chatbot interaction autocomplete. We present ChaI-TeA: CHat InTEraction Autocomplete; An autcomplete evaluation framework for LLM-based chatbot interactions. The framework includes a formal definition of the task, coupled with suitable datasets and metrics. We use the framework to evaluate After formally defining the task along with suitable datasets and metrics, we test 9 models on the defined auto completion task, finding that while current off-the-shelf models perform fairly, there is still much room for improvement, mainly in ranking of the generated suggestions. We provide insights for practitioners working on this task and open new research directions for researchers in the field. We release our framework to serve as a foundation for future research.

### When Claims Evolve: Evaluating and Enhancing the Robustness of Embedding   Models Against Misinformation Edits
**Authors**: Jabez Magomere, Emanuele La Malfa, Manuel Tonneau, Ashkan Kazemi, Scott Hale

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T11:47:32Z

**Summary**: Online misinformation remains a critical challenge, and fact-checkers increasingly rely on embedding-based methods to retrieve relevant fact-checks. Yet, when debunked claims reappear in edited forms, the performance of these methods is unclear. In this work, we introduce a taxonomy of six common real-world misinformation edits and propose a perturbation framework that generates valid, natural claim variations. Our multi-stage retrieval evaluation reveals that standard embedding models struggle with user-introduced edits, while LLM-distilled embeddings offer improved robustness at a higher computational cost. Although a strong reranker helps mitigate some issues, it cannot fully compensate for first-stage retrieval gaps. Addressing these retrieval gaps, our train- and inference-time mitigation approaches enhance in-domain robustness by up to 17 percentage points and boost out-of-domain generalization by 10 percentage points over baseline models. Overall, our findings provide practical improvements to claim-matching systems, enabling more reliable fact-checking of evolving misinformation.

### CodeIF: Benchmarking the Instruction-Following Capabilities of Large   Language Models for Code Generation
**Authors**: Kaiwen Yan, Hongcheng Guo, Xuanqing Shi, Jingyi Xu, Yaonan Gu, Zhoujun Li

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T11:09:06Z

**Summary**: With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), the demand for robust instruction-following capabilities in code generation tasks has grown significantly. Code generation not only facilitates faster prototyping and automated testing, but also augments developer efficiency through improved maintainability and reusability of code. In this paper, we introduce CodeIF, the first benchmark specifically designed to assess the abilities of LLMs to adhere to task-oriented instructions within diverse code generation scenarios. CodeIF encompasses a broad range of tasks, including function synthesis, error debugging, algorithmic refactoring, and code explanation, thereby providing a comprehensive suite to evaluate model performance across varying complexity levels and programming domains. We conduct extensive experiments with LLMs, analyzing their strengths and limitations in meeting the demands of these tasks. The experimental results offer valuable insights into how well current models align with human instructions, as well as the extent to which they can generate consistent, maintainable, and contextually relevant code. Our findings not only underscore the critical role that instruction-following LLMs can play in modern software development, but also illuminate pathways for future research aimed at enhancing their adaptability, reliability, and overall effectiveness in automated code generation.

### The Serendipity of Claude AI: Case of the 13 Low-Resource National   Languages of Mali
**Authors**: Alou Dembele, Nouhoum Souleymane Coulibaly, Michael Leventhal

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T10:55:47Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP) have improved the representation of underrepresented languages. However, most languages, including Mali's 13 official national languages, continue to be poorly supported or unsupported by automatic translation and generative AI. This situation appears to have slightly improved with certain recent LLM releases. The study evaluated Claude AI's translation performance on each of the 13 national languages of Mali. In addition to ChrF2 and BLEU scores, human evaluators assessed translation accuracy, contextual consistency, robustness to dialect variations, management of linguistic bias, adaptation to a limited corpus, and ease of understanding. The study found that Claude AI performs robustly for languages with very modest language resources and, while unable to produce understandable and coherent texts for Malian languages with minimal resources, still manages to produce results which demonstrate the ability to mimic some elements of the language.

### DrugAgent: Automating AI-aided Drug Discovery Programming through LLM   Multi-Agent Collaboration
**Authors**: Sizhe Liu, Yizhou Lu, Siyu Chen, Xiyang Hu, Jieyu Zhao, Yingzhou Lu, Yue Zhao

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T10:54:30Z

**Summary**: Recent progress in Large Language Models (LLMs) has drawn attention to their potential for accelerating drug discovery. However, a central problem remains: translating theoretical ideas into robust implementations in the highly specialized context of pharmaceutical research. This limitation prevents practitioners from making full use of the latest AI developments in drug discovery. To address this challenge, we introduce DrugAgent, a multi-agent framework that automates machine learning (ML) programming for drug discovery tasks. DrugAgent employs an LLM Planner that formulates high-level ideas and an LLM Instructor that identifies and integrates domain knowledge when implementing those ideas. We present case studies on three representative drug discovery tasks. Our results show that DrugAgent consistently outperforms leading baselines, including a relative improvement of 4.92% in ROC-AUC compared to ReAct for drug-target interaction (DTI). DrugAgent is publicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/drugagent-5C42/.

### Leveraging Large Language Models to Develop Heuristics for Emerging   Optimization Problems
**Authors**: Thomas Bömer, Nico Koltermann, Max Disselnmeyer, Laura Dörr, Anne Meyer

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T10:22:49Z

**Summary**: Combinatorial optimization problems often rely on heuristic algorithms to generate efficient solutions. However, the manual design of heuristics is resource-intensive and constrained by the designer's expertise. Recent advances in artificial intelligence, particularly large language models (LLMs), have demonstrated the potential to automate heuristic generation through evolutionary frameworks. Recent works focus only on well-known combinatorial optimization problems like the traveling salesman problem and online bin packing problem when designing constructive heuristics. This study investigates whether LLMs can effectively generate heuristics for niche, not yet broadly researched optimization problems, using the unit-load pre-marshalling problem as an example case. We propose the Contextual Evolution of Heuristics (CEoH) framework, an extension of the Evolution of Heuristics (EoH) framework, which incorporates problem-specific descriptions to enhance in-context learning during heuristic generation. Through computational experiments, we evaluate CEoH and EoH and compare the results. Results indicate that CEoH enables smaller LLMs to generate high-quality heuristics more consistently and even outperform larger models. Larger models demonstrate robust performance with or without contextualized prompts. The generated heuristics exhibit scalability to diverse instance configurations.

### EnigmaToM: Improve LLMs' Theory-of-Mind Reasoning Capabilities with   Neural Knowledge Base of Entity States
**Authors**: Hainiu Xu, Siya Qi, Jiazheng Li, Yuxiang Zhou, Jinhua Du, Caroline Catmur, Yulan He

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T10:13:05Z

**Summary**: Theory-of-Mind (ToM), the ability to infer others' perceptions and mental states, is fundamental to human interaction but remains a challenging task for Large Language Models (LLMs). While existing ToM reasoning methods show promise with reasoning via perceptual perspective-taking, they often rely excessively on LLMs, reducing their efficiency and limiting their applicability to high-order ToM reasoning, which requires multi-hop reasoning about characters' beliefs. To address these issues, we present EnigmaToM, a novel neuro-symbolic framework that enhances ToM reasoning by integrating a Neural Knowledge Base of entity states (Enigma) for (1) a psychology-inspired iterative masking mechanism that facilitates accurate perspective-taking and (2) knowledge injection that elicits key entity information. Enigma generates structured representations of entity states, which construct spatial scene graphs -- leveraging spatial information as an inductive bias -- for belief tracking of various ToM orders and enhancing events with fine-grained entity state details. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks, including ToMi, HiToM, and FANToM, show that EnigmaToM significantly improves ToM reasoning across LLMs of varying sizes, particularly excelling in high-order reasoning scenarios.

### iNews: A Multimodal Dataset for Modeling Personalized Affective   Responses to News
**Authors**: Tiancheng Hu, Nigel Collier

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T10:09:53Z

**Summary**: Current approaches to emotion detection often overlook the inherent subjectivity of affective experiences, instead relying on aggregated labels that mask individual variations in emotional responses. We introduce iNews, a novel large-scale dataset explicitly capturing subjective affective responses to news headlines. Our dataset comprises annotations from 291 demographically diverse UK participants across 2,899 multimodal Facebook news posts from major UK outlets, with an average of 5.18 annotators per sample. For each post, annotators provide multifaceted labels including valence, arousal, dominance, discrete emotions, content relevance judgments, sharing likelihood, and modality importance ratings (text, image, or both). Furthermore, we collect comprehensive annotator persona information covering demographics, personality, media trust, and consumption patterns, which explain 15.2% of annotation variance - higher than existing NLP datasets. Incorporating this information yields a 7% accuracy gain in zero-shot prediction and remains beneficial even with 32-shot. iNews will enhance research in LLM personalization, subjectivity, affective computing, and individual-level behavior simulation.

### Number Cookbook: Number Understanding of Language Models and How to   Improve It
**Authors**: Haotong Yang, Yi Hu, Shijia Kang, Zhouchen Lin, Muhan Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T09:52:30Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) can solve an increasing number of complex reasoning tasks while making surprising mistakes in basic numerical understanding and processing (such as 9.11 > 9.9). The latter ability is essential for tackling complex arithmetic and mathematical problems and serves as a foundation for most reasoning tasks, but previous work paid little attention to it or only discussed several restricted tasks (like integer addition). In this paper, we comprehensively investigate the numerical understanding and processing ability (NUPA) of LLMs. Firstly, we introduce a benchmark covering four common numerical representations and 17 distinct numerical tasks in four major categories, resulting in 41 meaningful combinations in total. These tasks are derived from primary and secondary education curricula, encompassing nearly all everyday numerical understanding and processing scenarios, and the rules of these tasks are very simple and clear. Through the benchmark, we find that current LLMs fail frequently in many of the tasks. To study the problem, we train small models with existing and potential techniques for enhancing NUPA (such as tokenizers, PEs, and number formats), comprehensively evaluating their effectiveness using our testbed. We also finetune practical-scale LLMs on our proposed NUPA tasks and find that 1) naive finetuning can improve NUPA a lot on many but not all tasks, and 2) surprisingly, techniques designed to enhance NUPA prove ineffective for finetuning pretrained models. We further explore the impact of chain-of-thought techniques on NUPA. Our work provides a more detailed and comprehensive understanding of NUPA in LLMs. Our benchmark and code are released at https://github.com/GraphPKU/number_cookbook.

### DarwinLM: Evolutionary Structured Pruning of Large Language Models
**Authors**: Shengkun Tang, Oliver Sieberling, Eldar Kurtic, Zhiqiang Shen, Dan Alistarh

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T09:50:16Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant success across various NLP tasks. However, their massive computational costs limit their widespread use, particularly in real-time applications. Structured pruning offers an effective solution by compressing models and directly providing end-to-end speed improvements, regardless of the hardware environment. Meanwhile, different components of the model exhibit varying sensitivities towards pruning, calling for non-uniform model compression. However, a pruning method should not only identify a capable substructure, but also account for post-compression training. To this end, we propose DarwinLM, a method for training-aware structured pruning. DarwinLM builds upon an evolutionary search process, generating multiple offspring models in each generation through mutation, and selecting the fittest for survival. To assess the effect of post-training, we incorporate a lightweight, multistep training process within the offspring population, progressively increasing the number of tokens and eliminating poorly performing models in each selection stage. We validate our method through extensive experiments on Llama-2-7B, Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen-2.5-14B-Instruct, achieving state-of-the-art performance for structured pruning. For instance, DarwinLM surpasses ShearedLlama while requiring 5x less training data during post-compression training. Code is at: https://github.com/IST-DASLab/DarwinLM

**Authors**: Xi Zhu, Haochen Xue, Ziwei Zhao, Wujiang Xu, Jingyuan Huang, Minghao Guo, Qifan Wang, Kaixiong Zhou, Yongfeng Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T09:45:22Z

**Summary**: Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs), where each node is associated with text descriptions, are ubiquitous in real-world scenarios. They typically exhibit distinctive structure and domain-specific knowledge, motivating the development of a Graph Foundation Model (GFM) that generalizes across diverse graphs and tasks. Despite large efforts to integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for TAGs, existing approaches suffer from decoupled architectures with two-stage alignment, limiting their synergistic potential. Even worse, existing methods assign out-of-vocabulary (OOV) tokens to graph nodes, leading to graph-specific semantics, token explosion, and incompatibility with task-oriented prompt templates, which hinders cross-graph and cross-task transferability. To address these challenges, we propose PromptGFM, a versatile GFM for TAGs grounded in graph vocabulary learning. PromptGFM comprises two key components: (1) Graph Understanding Module, which explicitly prompts LLMs to replicate the finest GNN workflow within the text space, facilitating seamless GNN-LLM integration and elegant graph-text alignment; (2) Graph Inference Module, which establishes a language-based graph vocabulary ensuring expressiveness, transferability, and scalability, enabling readable instructions for LLM fine-tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate our superiority and transferability across diverse graphs and tasks. The code is available at this: https://github.com/agiresearch/PromptGFM.

### SEOE: A Scalable and Reliable Semantic Evaluation Framework for Open   Domain Event Detection
**Authors**: Yi-Fan Lu, Xian-Ling Mao, Tian Lan, Tong Zhang, Yu-Shi Zhu, Heyan Huang

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T09:37:05Z

**Summary**: Automatic evaluation for Open Domain Event Detection (ODED) is a highly challenging task, because ODED is characterized by a vast diversity of un-constrained output labels from various domains. Nearly all existing evaluation methods for ODED usually first construct evaluation benchmarks with limited labels and domain coverage, and then evaluate ODED methods using metrics based on token-level label matching rules. However, this kind of evaluation framework faces two issues: (1) The limited evaluation benchmarks lack representatives of the real world, making it difficult to accurately reflect the performance of various ODED methods in real-world scenarios; (2) Evaluation metrics based on token-level matching rules fail to capture semantic similarity between predictions and golden labels. To address these two problems above, we propose a scalable and reliable Semantic-level Evaluation framework for Open domain Event detection (SEOE) by constructing a more representative evaluation benchmark and introducing a semantic evaluation metric. Specifically, our proposed framework first constructs a scalable evaluation benchmark that currently includes 564 event types covering 7 major domains, with a cost-effective supplementary annotation strategy to ensure the benchmark's representativeness. The strategy also allows for the supplement of new event types and domains in the future. Then, the proposed SEOE leverages large language models (LLMs) as automatic evaluation agents to compute a semantic F1-score, incorporating fine-grained definitions of semantically similar labels to enhance the reliability of the evaluation. Extensive experiments validate the representatives of the benchmark and the reliability of the semantic evaluation metric. Existing ODED methods are thoroughly evaluated, and the error patterns of predictions are analyzed, revealing several insightful findings.

### On-Policy Self-Alignment with Fine-grained Knowledge Feedback for   Hallucination Mitigation
**Authors**: Xueru Wen, Jie Lou, Xinyu Lu, Ji Yuqiu, Xinyan Guan, Yaojie Lu, Hongyu Lin, Ben He, Xianpei Han, Debing Zhang, Le Sun

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T09:34:06Z

**Summary**: Hallucination occurs when large language models exhibit behavior that deviates from the boundaries of their knowledge during response generation. To address this critical issue, previous learning-based methods attempt to finetune models but are limited by off-policy sampling and coarse-grained feedback. In this paper, we present \textit{\b{R}einforcement \b{L}earning \b{f}or \b{H}allucination} (RLFH), an on-policy self-alignment approach that enables LLMs to actively explore their knowledge boundaries and self-correct generation behavior through fine-grained feedback signals. RLFH introduces a self-assessment framework where the policy serves as its own judge. Through this framework, responses are automatically decomposed into atomic facts and their truthfulness and informativeness are assessed against external knowledge sources. The resulting fine-grained feedback at the statement level are then converted into token-level dense reward signals. This enables online reinforcement learning to achieve precise and timely optimization without human intervention. Comprehensive evaluations on HotpotQA, SQuADv2, and Biography benchmarks validate RLFH's effectiveness in hallucination mitigation.

### Inference-Scale Complexity in ANN-SNN Conversion for High-Performance   and Low-Power Applications
**Authors**: Tong Bu, Maohua Li, Zhaofei Yu

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T09:21:26Z

**Summary**: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as a promising substitute for Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) due to their advantages of fast inference and low power consumption. However, the lack of efficient training algorithms has hindered their widespread adoption. Even efficient ANN-SNN conversion methods necessitate quantized training of ANNs to enhance the effectiveness of the conversion, incurring additional training costs. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient ANN-SNN conversion framework with only inference scale complexity. The conversion framework includes a local threshold balancing algorithm, which enables efficient calculation of the optimal thresholds and fine-grained adjustment of the threshold value by channel-wise scaling. We also introduce an effective delayed evaluation strategy to mitigate the influence of the spike propagation delays. We demonstrate the scalability of our framework in typical computer vision tasks: image classification, semantic segmentation, object detection, and video classification. Our algorithm outperforms existing methods, highlighting its practical applicability and efficiency. Moreover, we have evaluated the energy consumption of the converted SNNs, demonstrating their superior low-power advantage compared to conventional ANNs. This approach simplifies the deployment of SNNs by leveraging open-source pre-trained ANN models, enabling fast, low-power inference with negligible performance reduction. Code is available at https://github.com/putshua/Inference-scale-ANN-SNN.

### Affordably Fine-tuned LLMs Provide Better Answers to Course-specific   MCQs
**Authors**: Bianca Raimondi, Saverio Giallorenzo, Maurizio Gabbrielli

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T09:18:31Z

**Summary**: In education, the capability of generating human-like text of Large Language Models (LLMs) inspired work on how they can increase the efficiency of learning and teaching. We study the affordability of these models for educators and students by investigating how LLMs answer multiple-choice questions (MCQs) with respect to hardware constraints and refinement techniques. We explore this space by using generic pre-trained LLMs (the 7B, 13B, and 70B variants of LLaMA-2) to answer 162 undergraduate-level MCQs from a course on Programming Languages (PL) -- the MCQ dataset is a contribution of this work, which we make publicly available. Specifically, we dissect how different factors, such as using readily-available material -- (parts of) the course's textbook -- for fine-tuning and quantisation (to decrease resource usage) can change the accuracy of the responses. The main takeaway is that smaller textbook-based fine-tuned models outperform generic larger ones (whose pre-training requires conspicuous resources), making the usage of LLMs for answering MCQs resource- and material-wise affordable.

**Authors**: Yijie Chu, Ziniu Wu, Yong Yue, Eng Gee Lim, Paolo Paoletti, Xiaohui Zhu

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T09:07:13Z

**Summary**: Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs) are increasingly applied to water operations such as environmental monitoring and river-map modeling. It faces a significant challenge in achieving precise autonomous docking at ports or stations, still relying on remote human control or external positioning systems for accuracy and safety which limits the full potential of human-out-of-loop deployment for USVs.This paper introduces a novel supervised learning pipeline with the auto-labeling technique for USVs autonomous visual docking. Firstly, we designed an auto-labeling data collection pipeline that appends relative pose and image pair to the dataset. This step does not require conventional manual labeling for supervised learning. Secondly, the Neural Dock Pose Estimator (NDPE) is proposed to achieve relative dock pose prediction without the need for hand-crafted feature engineering, camera calibration, and peripheral markers. Moreover, The NDPE can accurately predict the relative dock pose in real-world water environments, facilitating the implementation of Position-Based Visual Servo (PBVS) and low-level motion controllers for efficient and autonomous docking.Experiments show that the NDPE is robust to the disturbance of the distance and the USV velocity. The effectiveness of our proposed solution is tested and validated in real-world water environments, reflecting its capability to handle real-world autonomous docking tasks.

**Authors**: T. Y. S. S Santosh, Mahmoud Aly, Oana Ichim, Matthias Grabmair

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T08:49:28Z

**Summary**: Analyzing large volumes of case law to uncover evolving legal principles, across multiple cases, on a given topic is a demanding task for legal professionals. Structured topical reports provide an effective solution by summarizing key issues, principles, and judgments, enabling comprehensive legal analysis on a particular topic. While prior works have advanced query-based individual case summarization, none have extended to automatically generating multi-case structured reports. To address this, we introduce LexGenie, an automated LLM-based pipeline designed to create structured reports using the entire body of case law on user-specified topics within the European Court of Human Rights jurisdiction. LexGenie retrieves, clusters, and organizes relevant passages by topic to generate a structured outline and cohesive content for each section. Expert evaluation confirms LexGenie's utility in producing structured reports that enhance efficient, scalable legal analysis.

### LaRA: Benchmarking Retrieval-Augmented Generation and Long-Context LLMs   -- No Silver Bullet for LC or RAG Routing
**Authors**: Kuan Li, Liwen Zhang, Yong Jiang, Pengjun Xie, Fei Huang, Shuai Wang, Minhao Cheng

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T08:48:25Z

**Summary**: Effectively incorporating external knowledge into Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for enhancing their capabilities and addressing real-world needs. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers an effective method for achieving this by retrieving the most relevant fragments into LLMs. However, the advancements in context window size for LLMs offer an alternative approach, raising the question of whether RAG remains necessary for effectively handling external knowledge. Several existing studies provide inconclusive comparisons between RAG and long-context (LC) LLMs, largely due to limitations in the benchmark designs. In this paper, we present LaRA, a novel benchmark specifically designed to rigorously compare RAG and LC LLMs. LaRA encompasses 2326 test cases across four practical QA task categories and three types of naturally occurring long texts. Through systematic evaluation of seven open-source and four proprietary LLMs, we find that the optimal choice between RAG and LC depends on a complex interplay of factors, including the model's parameter size, long-text capabilities, context length, task type, and the characteristics of the retrieved chunks. Our findings provide actionable guidelines for practitioners to effectively leverage both RAG and LC approaches in developing and deploying LLM applications.

### Real-time station monitor and stationtest pipelines for LOFAR 2.0
**Authors**: Jun Wang, M. J. Norden, P. Donker

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T08:44:45Z

**Summary**: LOFAR is a low-frequency array distributed across several European countries. Each LOFAR station contains thousands of antennas and associated electronics, making monitoring and thorough testing of those components essential to ensuring station reliability. This paper discusses various anomalies that may arise in LOFAR antennas, tile elements, modems, and summators. We also introduce two diagnostic pipelines designed to detect these anomalies: a real-time station monitoring system and an offline stationtest system. These pipelines provide valuable insights into the operational status of each antenna, issuing alerts to minimize observational disruptions while maximizing station uptime, reliability, and sensitivity. By enhancing the efficiency and stability of LOFAR stations, they also serve as a foundation for future large-scale arrays like SKA-Low. The experience gained from their development and deployment will contribute to the construction and maintenance of SKA-Low, improving monitoring and diagnostic capabilities for large-scale antenna networks. Ultimately, these systems play a crucial role in ensuring continuous observations and maintaining data integrity.

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T08:43:44Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success and have been applied across various scientific fields, including chemistry. However, many chemical tasks require the processing of visual information, which cannot be successfully handled by existing chemical LLMs. This brings a growing need for models capable of integrating multimodal information in the chemical domain. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{ChemVLM}, an open-source chemical multimodal large language model specifically designed for chemical applications. ChemVLM is trained on a carefully curated bilingual multimodal dataset that enhances its ability to understand both textual and visual chemical information, including molecular structures, reactions, and chemistry examination questions. We develop three datasets for comprehensive evaluation, tailored to Chemical Optical Character Recognition (OCR), Multimodal Chemical Reasoning (MMCR), and Multimodal Molecule Understanding tasks. We benchmark ChemVLM against a range of open-source and proprietary multimodal large language models on various tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that ChemVLM achieves competitive performance across all evaluated tasks. Our model can be found at https://huggingface.co/AI4Chem/ChemVLM-26B.

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T08:41:03Z

**Summary**: The ever-increasing volume of data has necessitated a new computing paradigm, embodied through Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Large Language Models (LLMs). Digital electronic AI computing systems, however, are gradually reaching their physical plateaus, stimulating extensive research towards next-generation AI accelerators. Photonic Neural Networks (PNNs), with their unique ability to capitalize on the interplay of multiple physical dimensions including time, wavelength, and space, have been brought forward with a credible promise for boosting computational power and energy efficiency in AI processors. In this article, we experimentally demonstrate a novel multidimensional arrayed waveguide grating router (AWGR)-based photonic AI accelerator that can execute tensor multiplications at a record-high total computational power of 262 TOPS, offering a ~24x improvement over the existing waveguide-based optical accelerators. It consists of a 16x16 AWGR that exploits the time-, wavelength- and space- division multiplexing (T-WSDM) for weight and input encoding together with an integrated Si3N4-based frequency comb for multi-wavelength generation. The photonic AI accelerator has been experimentally validated in both Fully-Connected (FC) and Convolutional NN (NNs) models, with the FC and CNN being trained for DDoS attack identification and MNIST classification, respectively. The experimental inference at 32 Gbaud achieved a Cohen's kappa score of 0.867 for DDoS detection and an accuracy of 92.14% for MNIST classification, respectively, closely matching the software performance.

### Can Frontier LLMs Replace Annotators in Biomedical Text Mining?   Analyzing Challenges and Exploring Solutions
**Authors**: Yichong Zhao, Susumu Goto

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T08:37:10Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) can perform various natural language processing (NLP) tasks through in-context learning without relying on supervised data. However, multiple previous studies have reported suboptimal performance of LLMs in biological text mining. By analyzing failure patterns in these evaluations, we identified three primary challenges for LLMs in biomedical corpora: (1) LLMs fail to learn implicit dataset-specific nuances from supervised data, (2) The common formatting requirements of discriminative tasks limit the reasoning capabilities of LLMs particularly for LLMs that lack test-time compute, and (3) LLMs struggle to adhere to annotation guidelines and match exact schemas, which hinders their ability to understand detailed annotation requirements which is essential in biomedical annotation workflow. To address these challenges, we experimented with prompt engineering techniques targeted to the above issues, and developed a pipeline that dynamically extracts instructions from annotation guidelines. Our findings show that frontier LLMs can approach or surpass the performance of state-of-the-art (SOTA) BERT-based models with minimal reliance on manually annotated data and without fine-tuning. Furthermore, we performed model distillation on a closed-source LLM, demonstrating that a BERT model trained exclusively on synthetic data annotated by LLMs can also achieve a practical performance. Based on these results, we explored the feasibility of partially replacing manual annotation with LLMs in production scenarios for biomedical text mining.

### BANet: Bilateral Aggregation Network for Mobile Stereo Matching
**Authors**: Gangwei Xu, Jiaxin Liu, Xianqi Wang, Junda Cheng, Yong Deng, Jinliang Zang, Yurui Chen, Xin Yang

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T08:33:08Z

**Summary**: State-of-the-art stereo matching methods typically use costly 3D convolutions to aggregate a full cost volume, but their computational demands make mobile deployment challenging. Directly applying 2D convolutions for cost aggregation often results in edge blurring, detail loss, and mismatches in textureless regions. Some complex operations, like deformable convolutions and iterative warping, can partially alleviate this issue; however, they are not mobile-friendly, limiting their deployment on mobile devices. In this paper, we present a novel bilateral aggregation network (BANet) for mobile stereo matching that produces high-quality results with sharp edges and fine details using only 2D convolutions. Specifically, we first separate the full cost volume into detailed and smooth volumes using a spatial attention map, then perform detailed and smooth aggregations accordingly, ultimately fusing both to obtain the final disparity map. Additionally, to accurately identify high-frequency detailed regions and low-frequency smooth/textureless regions, we propose a new scale-aware spatial attention module. Experimental results demonstrate that our BANet-2D significantly outperforms other mobile-friendly methods, achieving 35.3\% higher accuracy on the KITTI 2015 leaderboard than MobileStereoNet-2D, with faster runtime on mobile devices. The extended 3D version, BANet-3D, achieves the highest accuracy among all real-time methods on high-end GPUs. Code: \textcolor{magenta}{https://github.com/gangweiX/BANet}.

### Exploring the Potential of Large Language Models as Predictors in   Dynamic Text-Attributed Graphs
**Authors**: Runlin Lei, Jiarui Ji, Haipeng Ding, Lu Yi, Zhewei Wei, Yongchao Liu, Chuntao Hong

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T08:28:11Z

**Summary**: With the rise of large language models (LLMs), there has been growing interest in Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) for graph-based tasks. By leveraging LLMs as predictors, GFMs have demonstrated impressive generalizability across various tasks and datasets. However, existing research on LLMs as predictors has predominantly focused on static graphs, leaving their potential in dynamic graph prediction unexplored. In this work, we pioneer using LLMs for predictive tasks on dynamic graphs. We identify two key challenges: the constraints imposed by context length when processing large-scale historical data and the significant variability in domain characteristics, both of which complicate the development of a unified predictor. To address these challenges, we propose the GraphAgent-Dynamic (GAD) Framework, a multi-agent system that leverages collaborative LLMs. In contrast to using a single LLM as the predictor, GAD incorporates global and local summary agents to generate domain-specific knowledge, enhancing its transferability across domains. Additionally, knowledge reflection agents enable adaptive updates to GAD's knowledge, maintaining a unified and self-consistent architecture. In experiments, GAD demonstrates performance comparable to or even exceeds that of full-supervised graph neural networks without dataset-specific training. Finally, to enhance the task-specific performance of LLM-based predictors, we discuss potential improvements, such as dataset-specific fine-tuning to LLMs. By developing tailored strategies for different tasks, we provide new insights for the future design of LLM-based predictors.

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T08:23:04Z

**Summary**: The current generation of large language models (LLMs) is typically designed for broad, general-purpose applications, while domain-specific LLMs, especially in vertical fields like medicine, remain relatively scarce. In particular, the development of highly efficient and practical LLMs for the medical domain is challenging due to the complexity of medical knowledge and the limited availability of high-quality data. To bridge this gap, we introduce Baichuan-M1, a series of large language models specifically optimized for medical applications. Unlike traditional approaches that simply continue pretraining on existing models or apply post-training to a general base model, Baichuan-M1 is trained from scratch with a dedicated focus on enhancing medical capabilities. Our model is trained on 20 trillion tokens and incorporates a range of effective training methods that strike a balance between general capabilities and medical expertise. As a result, Baichuan-M1 not only performs strongly across general domains such as mathematics and coding but also excels in specialized medical fields. We have open-sourced Baichuan-M1-14B, a mini version of our model, which can be accessed through the following links.

### PAIR: A Novel Large Language Model-Guided Selection Strategy for   Evolutionary Algorithms
**Authors**: Shady Ali, Mahmoud Ashraf, Seif Hegazy, Fatty Salem, Hoda Mokhtar, Mohamed Medhat Gaber, Mohamed Taher Alrefaie

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T07:45:56Z

**Summary**: Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) employ random or simplistic selection methods, limiting their exploration of solution spaces and convergence to optimal solutions. The randomness in performing crossover or mutations may limit the model's ability to evolve efficiently. This paper introduces Preference-Aligned Individual Reciprocity (PAIR), a novel selection approach leveraging Large Language Models to emulate human-like mate selection, thereby introducing intelligence to the pairing process in EAs. PAIR prompts an LLM to evaluate individuals within a population based on genetic diversity, fitness level, and crossover compatibility, guiding more informed pairing decisions. We evaluated PAIR against a baseline method called LLM-driven EA (LMEA), published recently. Results indicate that PAIR significantly outperforms LMEA across various TSP instances, achieving lower optimality gaps and improved convergence. This performance is especially noticeable when combined with the flash thinking model, demonstrating increased population diversity to escape local optima. In general, PAIR provides a new strategy in the area of in-context learning for LLM-driven selection in EAs via sophisticated preference modelling, paving the way for improved solutions and further studies into LLM-guided optimization.

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T07:39:03Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have witnessed remarkable advancements in recent years, prompting the exploration of tool learning, which integrates LLMs with external tools to address diverse real-world challenges. Assessing the capability of LLMs to utilise tools necessitates large-scale and stable benchmarks. However, previous works relied on either hand-crafted online tools with limited scale, or large-scale real online APIs suffering from instability of API status. To address this problem, we introduce StableToolBench, a benchmark evolving from ToolBench, proposing a virtual API server and stable evaluation system. The virtual API server contains a caching system and API simulators which are complementary to alleviate the change in API status. Meanwhile, the stable evaluation system designs solvable pass and win rates using GPT-4 as the automatic evaluator to eliminate the randomness during evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate the stability of StableToolBench, and further discuss the effectiveness of API simulators, the caching system, and the evaluator system.

### FANS -- Formal Answer Selection for Natural Language Math Reasoning   Using Lean4
**Authors**: Jiarui Yao, Ruida Wang, Tong Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T07:34:53Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have displayed astonishing abilities in various tasks, especially in text generation, classification, question answering, etc. However, the reasoning ability of LLMs still faces many debates. The inherent ambiguity of Natural Language (NL) limits LLMs' ability to perform verifiable reasoning, making its answers lack coherence and trustworthy support. To tackle the above problems, we propose a novel framework named FANS: Formal ANswer Selection for Natural Language Math Reasoning Using Lean4. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first framework that utilizes Lean4 to enhance LLMs' NL math reasoning ability. In particular, given an NL math question and LLM-generated answers, FANS first translates it into Lean4 theorem statements. Then it tries to prove it using a Lean4 prover and verify it by Lean4. Finally, it uses the FL result to assist in answer selection. It enhances LLMs' NL math ability in providing a computer-verifiable solution for its correct answer and proposes an alternative method for answer selection beyond the reward model. Extensive experiments indicate the effectiveness of our framework. It can improve the accuracy rate of reward model enhanced LLMs in the MATH-500 dataset by at most 1.91% and AMC-23 by at most 8.33% on strong reward-model baselines. In some particular fields like number theory that Lean4 experts in, we can even select all correct solutions. The qualitative analysis also shows our framework can make NL results formally backed by Lean4 proofs. As a pioneering work in the corresponding field, we will open-source all our models and datasets to further boost the development of the field.

**Summary**: Video temporal grounding aims to localize relevant temporal boundaries in a video given a textual prompt. Recent work has focused on enabling Video LLMs to perform video temporal grounding via next-token prediction of temporal timestamps. However, accurately localizing timestamps in videos remains challenging for Video LLMs when relying solely on temporal token prediction. Our proposed TimeRefine addresses this challenge in two ways. First, instead of directly predicting the start and end timestamps, we reformulate the temporal grounding task as a temporal refining task: the model first makes rough predictions and then refines them by predicting offsets to the target segment. This refining process is repeated multiple times, through which the model progressively self-improves its temporal localization accuracy. Second, to enhance the model's temporal perception capabilities, we incorporate an auxiliary prediction head that penalizes the model more if a predicted segment deviates further from the ground truth, thus encouraging the model to make closer and more accurate predictions. Our plug-and-play method can be integrated into most LLM-based temporal grounding approaches. The experimental results demonstrate that TimeRefine achieves 3.6% and 5.0% mIoU improvements on the ActivityNet and Charades-STA datasets, respectively. Code and pretrained models will be released.

### OpenGV 2.0: Motion prior-assisted calibration and SLAM with   vehicle-mounted surround-view systems
**Authors**: Kun Huang, Yifu Wang, Si'ao Zhang, Zhirui Wang, Zhanpeng Ouyang, Zhenghua Yu, Laurent Kneip

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T07:03:15Z

**Summary**: The present paper proposes optimization-based solutions to visual SLAM with a vehicle-mounted surround-view camera system. Owing to their original use-case, such systems often only contain a single camera facing into either direction and very limited overlap between fields of view. Our novelty consist of three optimization modules targeting at practical online calibration of exterior orientations from simple two-view geometry, reliable front-end initialization of relative displacements, and accurate back-end optimization using a continuous-time trajectory model. The commonality between the proposed modules is given by the fact that all three of them exploit motion priors that are related to the inherent non-holonomic characteristics of passenger vehicle motion. In contrast to prior related art, the proposed modules furthermore excel in terms of bypassing partial unobservabilities in the transformation variables that commonly occur for Ackermann-motion. As a further contribution, the modules are built into a novel surround-view camera SLAM system that specifically targets deployment on Ackermann vehicles operating in urban environments. All modules are studied in the context of in-depth ablation studies, and the practical validity of the entire framework is supported by a successful application to challenging, large-scale publicly available online datasets. Note that upon acceptance, the entire framework is scheduled for open-source release as part of an extension of the OpenGV library.

**Authors**: Qingqing Wu, Guangji Chen, Qiaoyan Peng, Wen Chen, Yifei Yuan, Zhenqiao Cheng, Jianwu Dou, Zhiyong Zhao, Ping Li

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T07:00:50Z

**Summary**: Intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) have emerged as a transformative technology for wireless networks by improving coverage, capacity, and energy efficiency through intelligent manipulation of wireless propagation environments. This paper provides a comprehensive study on the deployment and coordination of IRSs for wireless networks. By addressing both single- and multi-reflection IRS architectures, we examine their deployment strategies across diverse scenarios, including point-to-point, point-to-multipoint, and point-to-area setups. For the single-reflection case, we highlight the trade-offs between passive and active IRS architectures in terms of beamforming gain, coverage extension, and spatial multiplexing. For the multi-reflection case, we discuss practical strategies to optimize IRS deployment and element allocation, balancing cooperative beamforming gains and path loss. The paper further discusses practical challenges in IRS implementation, including environmental conditions, system compatibility, and hardware limitations. Numerical results and field tests validate the effectiveness of IRS-aided wireless networks and demonstrate their capacity and coverage improvements. Lastly, promising research directions, including movable IRSs, near-field deployments, and network-level optimization, are outlined to guide future investigations.

### Targeted Distillation for Sentiment Analysis
**Authors**: Yice Zhang, Guangyu Xie, Jingjie Lin, Jianzhu Bao, Qianlong Wang, Xi Zeng, Ruifeng Xu

**Updated**: 2025-03-05T06:45:25Z

**Summary**: This paper presents a compact model that achieves strong sentiment analysis capabilities through targeted distillation from advanced large language models (LLMs). Our methodology decouples the distillation target into two key components: sentiment-related knowledge and task alignment. To transfer these components, we propose a two-stage distillation framework. The first stage, knowledge-driven distillation (\textsc{KnowDist}), transfers sentiment-related knowledge to enhance fundamental sentiment analysis capabilities. The second stage, in-context learning distillation (\textsc{ICLDist}), transfers task-specific prompt-following abilities to optimize task alignment. For evaluation, we introduce \textsc{SentiBench}, a comprehensive sentiment analysis benchmark comprising 3 task categories across 12 datasets. Experiments on this benchmark demonstrate that our model effectively balances model size and performance, showing strong competitiveness compared to existing small-scale LLMs.
