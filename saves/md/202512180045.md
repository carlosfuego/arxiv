 ### MemFlow: Flowing Adaptive Memory for Consistent and Efficient Long Video Narratives
**Authors**: Sihui Ji, Xi Chen, Shuai Yang, Xin Tao, Pengfei Wan, Hengshuang Zhao

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T18:59:59Z

**Summary**: The core challenge for streaming video generation is maintaining the content consistency in long context, which poses high requirement for the memory design. Most existing solutions maintain the memory by compressing historical frames with predefined strategies. However, different to-generate video chunks should refer to different historical cues, which is hard to satisfy with fixed strategies. In this work, we propose MemFlow to address this problem. Specifically, before generating the coming chunk, we dynamically update the memory bank by retrieving the most relevant historical frames with the text prompt of this chunk. This design enables narrative coherence even if new event happens or scenario switches in future frames. In addition, during generation, we only activate the most relevant tokens in the memory bank for each query in the attention layers, which effectively guarantees the generation efficiency. In this way, MemFlow achieves outstanding long-context consistency with negligible computation burden (7.9% speed reduction compared with the memory-free baseline) and keeps the compatibility with any streaming video generation model with KV cache.

**Authors**: Lanxiang Hu, Siqi Kou, Yichao Fu, Samyam Rajbhandari, Tajana Rosing, Yuxiong He, Zhijie Deng, Hao Zhang

**Summary**: Multi-token generation has emerged as a promising paradigm for accelerating transformer-based large model inference. Recent efforts primarily explore diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) for parallel decoding to reduce inference latency. To achieve AR-level generation quality, many techniques adapt AR models into dLLMs to enable parallel decoding. However, they suffer from limited speedup compared to AR models due to a pretrain-to-posttrain mismatch. Specifically, the masked data distribution in post-training deviates significantly from the real-world data distribution seen during pretraining, and dLLMs rely on bidirectional attention, which conflicts with the causal prior learned during pretraining and hinders the integration of exact KV cache reuse. To address this, we introduce Jacobi Forcing, a progressive distillation paradigm where models are trained on their own generated parallel decoding trajectories, smoothly shifting AR models into efficient parallel decoders while preserving their pretrained causal inference property. The models trained under this paradigm, Jacobi Forcing Model, achieves 3.8x wall-clock speedup on coding and math benchmarks with minimal loss in performance. Based on Jacobi Forcing Models' trajectory characteristics, we introduce multi-block decoding with rejection recycling, which enables up to 4.5x higher token acceptance count per iteration and nearly 4.0x wall-clock speedup, effectively trading additional compute for lower inference latency. Our code is available at https://github.com/hao-ai-lab/JacobiForcing.

**Authors**: Yifan Zhang, Yifeng Liu, Huizhuo Yuan, Zhen Qin, Yang Yuan, Quanquan Gu, Andrew Chi-Chih Yao

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T16:24:22Z

**Summary**: Scaling language models to handle longer input sequences typically necessitates large key-value (KV) caches, resulting in substantial memory overhead during inference. In this paper, we propose Tensor Product Attention (TPA), a novel attention mechanism that uses tensor decompositions to represent queries, keys, and values compactly, substantially shrinking the KV cache size at inference time. By factorizing these representations into contextual low-rank components and seamlessly integrating with Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE), TPA achieves improved model quality alongside memory efficiency. Based on TPA, we introduce the Tensor ProducT ATTenTion Transformer (T6), a new model architecture for sequence modeling. Through extensive empirical evaluation on language modeling tasks, we demonstrate that T6 surpasses or matches the performance of standard Transformer baselines including Multi-Head Attention (MHA), Multi-Query Attention (MQA), Grouped-Query Attention (GQA), and Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA) across various metrics, including perplexity and a range of established evaluation benchmarks. Notably, TPA's memory efficiency and computational efficiency at decoding stage enables processing longer sequences under fixed resource constraints, addressing a critical scalability challenge in modern language models.

### Hybrid Cognitive IoT with Cooperative Caching and SWIPT-EH: A Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning Framework
**Authors**: Nadia Abdolkhani, Walaa Hamouda

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T15:18:50Z

**Summary**: This paper proposes a hierarchical deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework based on the soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithm for hybrid underlay-overlay cognitive Internet of Things (CIoT) networks with simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT)-energy harvesting (EH) and cooperative caching. Unlike prior hierarchical DRL approaches that focus primarily on spectrum access or power control, our work jointly optimizes EH, hybrid access coordination, power allocation, and caching in a unified framework. The joint optimization problem is formulated as a weighted-sum multi-objective task, designed to maximize throughput and cache hit ratio while simultaneously minimizing transmission delay. In the proposed model, CIoT agents jointly optimize EH and data transmission using a learnable time switching (TS) factor. They also coordinate spectrum access under hybrid overlay-underlay paradigms and make power control and cache placement decisions while considering energy, interference, and storage constraints. Specifically, in this work, cooperative caching is used to enable overlay access, while power control is used for underlay access. A novel three-level hierarchical SAC (H-SAC) agent decomposes the mixed discrete-continuous action space into modular subproblems, improving scalability and convergence over flat DRL methods. The high-level policy adjusts the TS factor, the mid-level policy manages spectrum access coordination and cache sharing, and the low-level policy decides transmit power and caching actions for both the CIoT agent and PU content. Simulation results show that the proposed hierarchical SAC approach significantly outperforms benchmark and greedy strategies. It achieves better performance in terms of average sum rate, delay, cache hit ratio, and energy efficiency, even under channel fading and uncertain conditions.

**Authors**: Marco Dos Santos, Hugues de Saxcé, Haiming Wang, Ran Wang, Mantas Baksys, Mert Unsal, Junqi Liu, Zhengying Liu, Jia Li

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T14:04:14Z

**Summary**: We introduce the Kimina Lean Server, an open-source project designed as a high-performance verifier for reinforcement learning pipelines. Built on top of the Lean REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) maintained by the Lean FRO, our server combines server-side parallelism by managing multiple Lean processes in parallel with a Least Recently Used (LRU) caching mechanism that reuses Lean imports across requests. On the client side, a lightweight Python package enables submitting proof batches and receiving Lean feedback, including extracted tactics and tactic states.   Together, these features enable a scalable workflow for large-scale verification and data extraction. In our experiments, the Kimina Lean Server outperforms previous Lean interaction tools, achieving a 1.5 to 2 times speedup in verification time. Moreover, its improved efficiency has enabled its use in the large-scale training of state-of-the-art models such as Kimina-Prover.   We hope that our open-source project will support the neural theorem proving community and accelerate future progress by enabling efficient large-scale verification and proof data extraction.

### Adaptive Cache Pollution Control for Large Language Model Inference Workloads Using Temporal CNN-Based Prediction and Priority-Aware Replacement
**Authors**: Songze Liu, Hongkun Du, Shaowen Wang

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T07:16:10Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT and LLaMA, introduce unique memory access characteristics during inference due to frequent token sequence lookups and embedding vector retrievals. These workloads generate highly irregular and bursty access patterns, causing traditional prefetching and replacement policies to mispredict and trigger severe cache pollution, thereby degrading system performance. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an Adaptive Cache Pollution Control (ACPC) mechanism tailored for LLM inference workloads, integrating Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN)-based access prediction with a priority-aware replacement strategy. The TCN module learns temporal dependencies in token access sequences to identify potential high-reuse cache lines, while the replacement policy dynamically adjusts eviction priorities based on predicted reuse likelihood and cache occupancy. The proposed framework is implemented and evaluated on representative transformer-based inference traces, including GPT-style autoregressive decoding and embedding retrieval workloads. Experimental results demonstrate that ACPC reduces cache pollution by 41.7 percent, improves cache hit rate by 8.9 percent, and achieves a 60.0 percent reduction in L2 miss penalty, compared with state-of-the-art machine-learning-based replacement baselines. Additionally, the proposed Temporal CNN-based ACPC framework increases token generation throughput by 15.9 percent and achieves the lowest final loss of 0.21, confirming its superior efficiency and stability under complex LLM inference workloads. These results highlight ACPC's effectiveness in recognizing useful cache lines and mitigating redundant prefetches under dynamic LLM access behaviors. The proposed approach provides a scalable, learning-driven solution for optimizing memory efficiency and latency in large-scale LLM serving and inference systems.

### Astraea: A State-Aware Scheduling Engine for LLM-Powered Agents
**Authors**: Hongqiu Ni, Jiabao Zhang, Guopeng Li, Zilong Wang, Ruiqi Wu, Chi Zhang, Haisheng Tan

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T06:55:10Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed as intelligent agents. Their multi-stage workflows, which alternate between local computation and calls to external network services like Web APIs, introduce a mismatch in their execution pattern and the scheduling granularity of existing inference systems such as vLLM. Existing systems typically focus on per-segment optimization which prevents them from minimizing the end-to-end latency of the complete agentic workflow, i.e., the global Job Completion Time (JCT) over the entire request lifecycle. To address this limitation, we propose Astraea, a service engine designed to shift the optimization from local segments to the global request lifecycle. Astraea employs a state-aware, hierarchical scheduling algorithm that integrates a request's historical state with future predictions. It dynamically classifies requests by their I/O and compute intensive nature and uses an enhanced HRRN policy to balance efficiency and fairness. Astraea also implements an adaptive KV cache manager that intelligently handles the agent state during I/O waits based on the system memory pressure. Extensive experiments show that Astraea reduces average JCT by up to 25.5\% compared to baseline methods. Moreover, our approach demonstrates strong robustness and stability under high load across various model scales.

### PAT: Accelerating LLM Decoding via Prefix-Aware Attention with Resource Efficient Multi-Tile Kernel
**Authors**: Jinjun Yi, Zhixin Zhao, Yitao Hu, Ke Yan, Weiwei Sun, Hao Wang, Laiping Zhao, Yuhao Zhang, Wenxin Li, Keqiu Li

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T05:44:34Z

**Summary**: LLM serving is increasingly dominated by decode attention, which is a memory-bound operation due to massive KV cache loading from global memory. Meanwhile, real-world workloads exhibit substantial, hierarchical shared prefixes across requests (e.g., system prompts, tools/templates, RAG). Existing attention implementations fail to fully exploit prefix sharing: one-query-per-CTA execution repeatedly loads shared prefix KV cache, while one-size-fits-all tiling leaves on-chip resources idle and exacerbates bubbles for uneven KV lengths. These choices amplify memory bandwidth pressure and stall memory-bound decode attention.   This paper introduces PAT, a prefix-aware attention kernel implementation for LLM decoding that organizes execution with a pack-forward-merge paradigm. PAT packs queries by shared prefix to reduce repeated memory accesses, runs a customized multi-tile kernel to achieve high resource efficiency. It further applies practical multi-stream forwarding and KV splitting to reduce resource bubbles. The final merge performs online softmax with negligible overhead. We implement PAT as an off-the-shelf plugin for vLLM. Evaluation on both real-world and synthetic workloads shows that PAT reduces attention latency by 53.5% on average and TPOT by 17.0-93.1% under the same configurations against state-of-the-art attention kernels. PAT's source code is publicly available at https://github.com/flashserve/PAT.

### OUSAC: Optimized Guidance Scheduling with Adaptive Caching for DiT Acceleration
**Authors**: Ruitong Sun, Tianze Yang, Wei Niu, Jin Sun

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T05:11:54Z

**Summary**: Diffusion models have emerged as the dominant paradigm for high-quality image generation, yet their computational expense remains substantial due to iterative denoising. Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) significantly enhances generation quality and controllability but doubles the computation by requiring both conditional and unconditional forward passes at every timestep. We present OUSAC (Optimized gUidance Scheduling with Adaptive Caching), a framework that accelerates diffusion transformers (DiT) through systematic optimization. Our key insight is that variable guidance scales enable sparse computation: adjusting scales at certain timesteps can compensate for skipping CFG at others, enabling both fewer total sampling steps and fewer CFG steps while maintaining quality. However, variable guidance patterns introduce denoising deviations that undermine standard caching methods, which assume constant CFG scales across steps. Moreover, different transformer blocks are affected at different levels under dynamic conditions. This paper develops a two-stage approach leveraging these insights. Stage-1 employs evolutionary algorithms to jointly optimize which timesteps to skip and what guidance scale to use, eliminating up to 82% of unconditional passes. Stage-2 introduces adaptive rank allocation that tailors calibration efforts per transformer block, maintaining caching effectiveness under variable guidance. Experiments demonstrate that OUSAC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art acceleration methods, achieving 53% computational savings with 15% quality improvement on DiT-XL/2 (ImageNet 512x512), 60% savings with 16.1% improvement on PixArt-alpha (MSCOCO), and 5x speedup on FLUX while improving CLIP Score over the 50-step baseline.

### FreeKV: Boosting KV Cache Retrieval for Efficient LLM Inference
**Authors**: Guangda Liu, Chengwei Li, Zhenyu Ning, Jing Lin, Yiwu Yao, Danning Ke, Minyi Guo, Jieru Zhao

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T04:58:49Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely deployed with rapidly expanding context windows to support increasingly demanding applications. However, long contexts pose significant deployment challenges, primarily due to the KV cache whose size grows proportionally with context length. While KV cache compression methods are proposed to address this issue, KV dropping methods incur considerable accuracy loss, and KV retrieval methods suffer from significant efficiency bottlenecks. We propose FreeKV, an algorithm-system co-optimization framework to enhance KV retrieval efficiency while preserving accuracy. On the algorithm side, FreeKV introduces speculative retrieval to shift the KV selection and recall processes out of the critical path, combined with fine-grained correction to ensure accuracy. On the system side, FreeKV employs hybrid KV layouts across CPU and GPU memory to eliminate fragmented data transfers, and leverages double-buffered streamed recall to further improve efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that FreeKV achieves near-lossless accuracy across various scenarios and models, delivering up to 13$\times$ speedup compared to SOTA KV retrieval methods.

### SonicMoE: Accelerating MoE with IO and Tile-aware Optimizations
**Authors**: Wentao Guo, Mayank Mishra, Xinle Cheng, Ion Stoica, Tri Dao

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T04:39:10Z

**Summary**: Mixture of Experts (MoE) models have emerged as the de facto architecture for scaling up language models without significantly increasing the computational cost. Recent MoE models demonstrate a clear trend towards high expert granularity (smaller expert intermediate dimension) and higher sparsity (constant number of activated experts with higher number of total experts), which improve model quality per FLOP. However, fine-grained MoEs suffer from increased activation memory footprint and reduced hardware efficiency due to higher IO costs, while sparser MoEs suffer from wasted computations due to padding in Grouped GEMM kernels. In response, we propose a memory-efficient algorithm to compute the forward and backward passes of MoEs with minimal activation caching for the backward pass. We also design GPU kernels that overlap memory IO with computation benefiting all MoE architectures. Finally, we propose a novel "token rounding" method that minimizes the wasted compute due to padding in Grouped GEMM kernels. As a result, our method SonicMoE reduces activation memory by 45% and achieves a 1.86x compute throughput improvement on Hopper GPUs compared to ScatterMoE's BF16 MoE kernel for a fine-grained 7B MoE. Concretely, SonicMoE on 64 H100s achieves a training throughput of 213 billion tokens per day comparable to ScatterMoE's 225 billion tokens per day on 96 H100s for a 7B MoE model training with FSDP-2 using the lm-engine codebase. Under high MoE sparsity settings, our tile-aware token rounding algorithm yields an additional 1.16x speedup on kernel execution time compared to vanilla top-$K$ routing while maintaining similar downstream performance. We open-source all our kernels to enable faster MoE model training.

### Efficient-DLM: From Autoregressive to Diffusion Language Models, and Beyond in Speed
**Authors**: Yonggan Fu, Lexington Whalen, Zhifan Ye, Xin Dong, Shizhe Diao, Jingyu Liu, Chengyue Wu, Hao Zhang, Enze Xie, Song Han, Maksim Khadkevich, Jan Kautz, Yingyan Celine Lin, Pavlo Molchanov

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T04:12:17Z

**Summary**: Diffusion language models (dLMs) have emerged as a promising paradigm that enables parallel, non-autoregressive generation, but their learning efficiency lags behind that of autoregressive (AR) language models when trained from scratch. To this end, we study AR-to-dLM conversion to transform pretrained AR models into efficient dLMs that excel in speed while preserving AR models' task accuracy. We achieve this by identifying limitations in the attention patterns and objectives of existing AR-to-dLM methods and then proposing principles and methodologies for more effective AR-to-dLM conversion. Specifically, we first systematically compare different attention patterns and find that maintaining pretrained AR weight distributions is critical for effective AR-to-dLM conversion. As such, we introduce a continuous pretraining scheme with a block-wise attention pattern, which remains causal across blocks while enabling bidirectional modeling within each block. We find that this approach can better preserve pretrained AR models' weight distributions than fully bidirectional modeling, in addition to its known benefit of enabling KV caching, and leads to a win-win in accuracy and efficiency. Second, to mitigate the training-test gap in mask token distributions (uniform vs. highly left-to-right), we propose a position-dependent token masking strategy that assigns higher masking probabilities to later tokens during training to better mimic test-time behavior. Leveraging this framework, we conduct extensive studies of dLMs' attention patterns, training dynamics, and other design choices, providing actionable insights into scalable AR-to-dLM conversion. These studies lead to the Efficient-DLM family, which outperforms state-of-the-art AR models and dLMs, e.g., our Efficient-DLM 8B achieves +5.4%/+2.7% higher accuracy with 4.5x/2.7x higher throughput compared to Dream 7B and Qwen3 4B, respectively.

### Cooperative Caching Towards Efficient Spectrum Utilization in Cognitive-IoT Networks
**Authors**: Nadia Abdolkhani, Walaa Hamouda

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T02:49:43Z

**Summary**: In cognitive Internet of Things (CIoT) networks, efficient spectrum sharing is essential to address increasing wireless demands. This paper presents a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based approach for joint cooperative caching and spectrum access coordination in CIoT networks, enabling the CIoT agents to collaborate with primary users (PUs) by caching PU content and serving their requests, fostering mutual benefits. The proposed DRL framework jointly optimizes caching policy and spectrum access under challenging conditions. Unlike traditional cognitive radio (CR) methods, where CIoT agents vacate the spectrum for PUs, or relaying techniques, which merely support spectrum sharing, caching brings data closer to the edge, reducing latency by minimizing retrieval distance. Simulations demonstrate that our approach outperforms others in lowering latency, increasing CIoT and PU cache hit rates, and enhancing network throughput. This approach redefines spectrum sharing, offering a fresh perspective on CIoT network design and illustrating the potential of DRL-guided caching to highlight the benefits of collaboration over dynamic spectrum access scenarios, elevating CIoT performance under constrained resources.

### Hyper-Minrank: A Unified Hypergraph Characterization of Multi-Sender Index Coding
**Authors**: Ali Khalesi, Petros Elia

**Updated**: 2025-12-15T18:08:09Z

**Summary**: This work introduces a hypergraph formulation that generalizes the classical paradigm of Bar-Yossef et al. to the multi-sender index coding (MSIC) setting. Central to the model is a 4-regular side-information hypergraph G, a new adjacency representation A_G = [A_1 ... A_N], and a simple fitting criterion for sub-hypergraph validity, in the presence of specially designed hyperedges that capture both side information and cross-sender signal cancellation. This formulation establishes a tight achievability-converse equivalence for the general N-sender, K-receiver problem: every valid fitting induces a valid linear multi-sender index code, every linear code induces a valid fitting, and the optimal scalar linear broadcast length equals the hyper-minrank l**lin(G) = hyperminrank(G) = min*{A fits G} sum_{n=1}^N rank(A_n). Beyond this exact characterization, the approach yields hypergraph analogues of Haemers-type bounds on the broadcast length, including a clique-cover upper bound and a lower bound via the clique number of a carefully defined complement hypergraph. Algorithmically, we provide an exact procedure to compute hyperminrank(G), and show that in certain regimes its complexity is asymptotically better than approximate LT-CMAR solutions. The framework captures well-known settings such as embedded index coding, and applies directly to multi-sender cache-aided communications, coded computation, distributed storage, and edge/satellite systems, where hyperminrank can serve as a unified design target.

### ReFusion: A Diffusion Large Language Model with Parallel Autoregressive Decoding
**Authors**: Jia-Nan Li, Jian Guan, Wei Wu, Chongxuan Li

**Updated**: 2025-12-15T17:41:19Z

**Summary**: Autoregressive models (ARMs) are hindered by slow sequential inference. While masked diffusion models (MDMs) offer a parallel alternative, they suffer from critical drawbacks: high computational overhead from precluding Key-Value (KV) caching, and incoherent generation arising from learning dependencies over an intractable space of token combinations. To address these limitations, we introduce ReFusion, a novel masked diffusion model that achieves superior performance and efficiency by elevating parallel decoding from the token level to a higher slot level, where each slot is a fixed-length, contiguous sub-sequence. This is achieved through an iterative ``plan-and-infill'' decoding process: a diffusion-based planning step first identifies a set of weakly dependent slots, and an autoregressive infilling step then decodes these selected slots in parallel. The slot-based design simultaneously unlocks full KV cache reuse with a unified causal framework and reduces the learning complexity from the token combination space to a manageable slot-level permutation space. Extensive experiments on seven diverse benchmarks show that ReFusion not only overwhelmingly surpasses prior MDMs with 34% performance gains and an over 18$\times$ speedup on average, but also bridges the performance gap to strong ARMs while maintaining a 2.33$\times$ average speedup.

### Uncovering the Role of Initial Saliency in U-Shaped Attention Bias: Scaling Initial Token Weight for Enhanced Long-Text Processing
**Authors**: Zewen Qiang, Sendong Zhao, Haochun Wang, Bing Qin, Ting Liu

**Updated**: 2025-12-15T09:04:06Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, they often struggle with long-text sequences due to the ``lost in the middle'' phenomenon. This issue has been shown to arise from a U-shaped attention bias, where attention is disproportionately focused on the beginning and end of a text, leaving the middle section underrepresented. While previous studies have attributed this bias to position encoding, our research first identifies an additional factor: initial saliency. It means that in the attention computation for each token, tokens with higher attention weights relative to the initial token tend to receive more attention in the prediction of the next token. We further find that utilizing this property by scaling attention weight between the initial token and others improves the model's ability to process long contexts, achieving a maximum improvement of 3.6\% in MDQA dataset. Moreover, combining this approach with existing methods to reduce position encoding bias further enhances performance, achieving a maximum improvement of 3.4\% in KV-Retrieval tasks.

### CHIMERA: Adaptive Cache Injection and Semantic Anchor Prompting for Zero-shot Image Morphing with Morphing-oriented Metrics
**Authors**: Dahyeon Kye, Jeahun Sung, Mingyu Jeon, Jihyong Oh

**Updated**: 2025-12-15T08:33:55Z

**Summary**: Diffusion models exhibit remarkable generative ability, yet achieving smooth and semantically consistent image morphing remains a challenge. Existing approaches often yield abrupt transitions or over-saturated appearances due to the lack of adaptive structural and semantic alignments. We propose CHIMERA, a zero-shot diffusion-based framework that formulates morphing as a cached inversion-guided denoising process. To handle large semantic and appearance disparities, we propose Adaptive Cache Injection and Semantic Anchor Prompting. Adaptive Cache Injection (ACI) caches down, mid, and up blocks features from both inputs during DDIM inversion and re-injects them adaptively during denoising, enabling spatial and semantic alignment in depth- and time-adaptive manners and enabling natural feature fusion and smooth transitions. Semantic Anchor Prompting (SAP) leverages a vision-language model to generate a shared anchor prompt that serves as a semantic anchor, bridging dissimilar inputs and guiding the denoising process toward coherent results. Finally, we introduce the Global-Local Consistency Score (GLCS), a morphing-oriented metric that simultaneously evaluates the global harmonization of the two inputs and the smoothness of the local morphing transition. Extensive experiments and user studies show that CHIMERA achieves smoother and more semantically aligned transitions than existing methods, establishing a new state of the art in image morphing. The code and project page will be publicly released.

### SneakPeek: Future-Guided Instructional Streaming Video Generation
**Authors**: Cheeun Hong, German Barquero, Fadime Sener, Markos Georgopoulos, Edgar Schönfeld, Stefan Popov, Yuming Du, Oscar Mañas, Albert Pumarola

**Updated**: 2025-12-15T06:32:57Z

**Summary**: Instructional video generation is an emerging task that aims to synthesize coherent demonstrations of procedural activities from textual descriptions. Such capability has broad implications for content creation, education, and human-AI interaction, yet existing video diffusion models struggle to maintain temporal consistency and controllability across long sequences of multiple action steps. We introduce a pipeline for future-driven streaming instructional video generation, dubbed SneakPeek, a diffusion-based autoregressive framework designed to generate precise, stepwise instructional videos conditioned on an initial image and structured textual prompts. Our approach introduces three key innovations to enhance consistency and controllability: (1) predictive causal adaptation, where a causal model learns to perform next-frame prediction and anticipate future keyframes; (2) future-guided self-forcing with a dual-region KV caching scheme to address the exposure bias issue at inference time; (3) multi-prompt conditioning, which provides fine-grained and procedural control over multi-step instructions. Together, these components mitigate temporal drift, preserve motion consistency, and enable interactive video generation where future prompt updates dynamically influence ongoing streaming video generation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method produces temporally coherent and semantically faithful instructional videos that accurately follow complex, multi-step task descriptions.

### SliceMoE: Bit-Sliced Expert Caching under Miss-Rate Constraints for Efficient MoE Inference
**Authors**: Yuseon Choi, Sangjin Kim, Jungjun Oh, Gwangtae Park, Byeongcheol Kim, Hoi-Jun Yoo

**Updated**: 2025-12-15T05:33:07Z

**Summary**: MoE models offer efficient scaling through conditional computation, but their large parameter size and expensive expert offloading make on-device deployment challenging. Existing acceleration techniques such as prefetching or expert clustering often increase energy usage or reduce expert diversity. We present SliceMoE, an energy-efficient MoE inference framework for miss-rate-constrained deployment. SliceMoE introduces Dynamic Bit-Sliced Caching (DBSC), which caches experts at slice-level granularity and assigns precision on demand to expand effective expert capacity. To support mixed-precision experts without memory duplication, we propose Calibration-Free Asymmetric Matryoshka Quantization (AMAT), a truncation-based scheme that maintains compatibility between low-bit and high-bit slices. We further introduce Predictive Cache Warmup (PCW) to reduce early-decode cold misses by reshaping cache contents during prefill. Evaluated on DeepSeek-V2-Lite and Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B, SliceMoE reduces decode-stage energy consumption by up to 2.37x and 2.85x, respectively, and improves decode latency by up to 1.81x and 1.64x, while preserving near-high-bit accuracy. These results demonstrate that slice-level caching enables an efficient on-device MoE deployment.

### AutoRefiner: Improving Autoregressive Video Diffusion Models via Reflective Refinement Over the Stochastic Sampling Path
**Authors**: Zhengyang Yu, Akio Hayakawa, Masato Ishii, Qingtao Yu, Takashi Shibuya, Jing Zhang, Yuki Mitsufuji

**Updated**: 2025-12-15T05:13:40Z

**Summary**: Autoregressive video diffusion models (AR-VDMs) show strong promise as scalable alternatives to bidirectional VDMs, enabling real-time and interactive applications. Yet there remains room for improvement in their sample fidelity. A promising solution is inference-time alignment, which optimizes the noise space to improve sample fidelity without updating model parameters. Yet, optimization- or search-based methods are computationally impractical for AR-VDMs. Recent text-to-image (T2I) works address this via feedforward noise refiners that modulate sampled noises in a single forward pass. Can such noise refiners be extended to AR-VDMs? We identify the failure of naively extending T2I noise refiners to AR-VDMs and propose AutoRefiner-a noise refiner tailored for AR-VDMs, with two key designs: pathwise noise refinement and a reflective KV-cache. Experiments demonstrate that AutoRefiner serves as an efficient plug-in for AR-VDMs, effectively enhancing sample fidelity by refining noise along stochastic denoising paths.

**Authors**: Shengling Qin, Hao Yu, Chenxin Wu, Zheng Li, Yizhong Cao, Zhengyang Zhuge, Yuxin Zhou, Wentao Yao, Yi Zhang, Zhengheng Wang, Shuai Bai, Jianwei Zhang, Junyang Lin

**Updated**: 2025-12-15T04:45:47Z

**Summary**: This paper presents VLCache, a cache reuse framework that exploits both Key-Value (KV) cache and encoder cache from prior multimodal inputs to eliminate costly recomputation when the same multimodal inputs recur. Unlike previous heuristic approaches, we formally identify the cumulative reuse error effect and demonstrate how to minimize the non-prefix cache reuse error effectively. We further analyze the varying importance of model layers and propose a dynamic, layer-aware recomputation strategy to balance accuracy and efficiency. Experimental results show that VLCache achieves an accuracy on par with full recomputation, while requiring only 2-5% of the tokens to compute, yielding 1.2x-16x TTFT speedups. The proposed VLCache pipeline has been integrated into SGLang, enabling significantly faster inference in practical deployments.

### SCAdapter: Content-Style Disentanglement for Diffusion Style Transfer
**Authors**: Luan Thanh Trinh, Kenji Doi, Atsuki Osanai

**Updated**: 2025-12-15T04:02:14Z

**Summary**: Diffusion models have emerged as the leading approach for style transfer, yet they struggle with photo-realistic transfers, often producing painting-like results or missing detailed stylistic elements. Current methods inadequately address unwanted influence from original content styles and style reference content features. We introduce SCAdapter, a novel technique leveraging CLIP image space to effectively separate and integrate content and style features. Our key innovation systematically extracts pure content from content images and style elements from style references, ensuring authentic transfers. This approach is enhanced through three components: Controllable Style Adaptive Instance Normalization (CSAdaIN) for precise multi-style blending, KVS Injection for targeted style integration, and a style transfer consistency objective maintaining process coherence. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate SCAdapter significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both conventional and diffusion-based baselines. By eliminating DDIM inversion and inference-stage optimization, our method achieves at least $2\times$ faster inference than other diffusion-based approaches, making it both more effective and efficient for practical applications.

### RollMux: Phase-Level Multiplexing for Disaggregated RL Post-Training
**Authors**: Tianyuan Wu, Lunxi Cao, Yining Wei, Wei Gao, Yuheng Zhao, Dakai An, Shaopan Xiong, Zhiqiang Lv, Ju Huang, Siran Yang, Yinghao Yu, Jiamang Wang, Lin Qu, Wei Wang

**Updated**: 2025-12-15T02:21:28Z

**Summary**: Rollout-training disaggregation is emerging as the standard architecture for Reinforcement Learning (RL) post-training, where memory-bound rollout and compute-bound training are physically disaggregated onto purpose-built clusters to maximize hardware efficiency. However, the strict synchronization required by on-policy algorithms introduces severe dependency bubbles, forcing one cluster to idle while the dependent phase is running on the other. We present RollMux, a cluster scheduling framework that reclaims these bubbles through cross-cluster orchestration. RollMux is built on the insight that the structural idleness of one job can be effectively utilized by the active phase of another. To realize this, we introduce the co-execution group abstraction, which partitions the cluster into isolated locality domains. This abstraction enables a two-tier scheduling architecture: an inter-group scheduler that optimizes job placement using conservative stochastic planning, and an intra-group scheduler that orchestrates a provably optimal round-robin schedule. The group abstraction also imposes a residency constraint, ensuring that massive model states remain cached in host memory to enable "warm-star" context switching. We evaluate RollMux on a production-scale testbed with 328 H20 and 328 H800 GPUs. RollMux improves cost efficiency by 1.84x over standard disaggregation and 1.38x over state-of-the-art co-located baselines, all while achieving 100% SLO attainment.

**Updated**: 2025-12-14T17:45:53Z

**Summary**: Diffusion models have recently achieved remarkable success in generative tasks (e.g., image and video generation), and the demand for high-quality content (e.g., 2K/4K videos) is rapidly increasing across various domains. However, generating ultra-high-resolution videos on existing standard-resolution (e.g., 720p) platforms remains challenging due to the excessive re-training requirements and prohibitively high computational and memory costs. To this end, we introduce SUPERGEN, an efficient tile-based framework for ultra-high-resolution video generation. SUPERGEN features a novel training-free algorithmic innovation with tiling to successfully support a wide range of resolutions without additional training efforts while significantly reducing both memory footprint and computational complexity. Moreover, SUPERGEN incorporates a tile-tailored, adaptive, region-aware caching strategy that accelerates video generation by exploiting redundancy across denoising steps and spatial regions. SUPERGEN also integrates cache-guided, communication-minimized tile parallelism for enhanced throughput and minimized latency. Evaluations show that SUPERGEN maximizes performance gains while achieving high output quality across various benchmarks.

### Think, Speak, Decide: Language-Augmented Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Economic Decision-Making
**Authors**: Heyang Ma, Qirui Mi, Qipeng Yang, Zijun Fan, Bo Li, Haifeng Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-12-14T15:38:21Z

**Summary**: Economic decision-making depends not only on structured signals such as prices and taxes, but also on unstructured language, including peer dialogue and media narratives. While multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has shown promise in optimizing economic decisions, it struggles with the semantic ambiguity and contextual richness of language. We propose LAMP (Language-Augmented Multi-Agent Policy), a framework that integrates language into economic decision-making and narrows the gap to real-world settings. LAMP follows a Think-Speak-Decide pipeline: (1) Think interprets numerical observations to extract short-term shocks and long-term trends, caching high-value reasoning trajectories; (2) Speak crafts and exchanges strategic messages based on reasoning, updating beliefs by parsing peer communications; and (3) Decide fuses numerical data, reasoning, and reflections into a MARL policy to optimize language-augmented decision-making. Experiments in economic simulation show that LAMP outperforms both MARL and LLM-only baselines in cumulative return (+63.5%, +34.0%), robustness (+18.8%, +59.4%), and interpretability. These results demonstrate the potential of language-augmented policies to deliver more effective and robust economic strategies.

### Lethe: Layer- and Time-Adaptive KV Cache Pruning for Reasoning-Intensive LLM Serving
**Authors**: Hui Zeng, Daming Zhao, Pengfei Yang, WenXuan Hou, Tianyang Zheng, Hui Li, Weiye Ji, Jidong Zhai

**Updated**: 2025-12-14T14:18:27Z

**Summary**: Generative reasoning with large language models (LLMs) often involves long decoding sequences, leading to substantial memory and latency overheads from accumulating key-value (KV) caches. While existing KV compression methods primarily focus on reducing prefill memory from long input sequences, they fall short in addressing the dynamic and layer-sensitive nature of long-form generation, which is central to reasoning tasks. We propose Lethe, a dynamic KV cache management framework that introduces adaptivity along both the spatial and temporal dimensions of decoding. Along the spatial dimension, Lethe performs layerwise sparsity-aware allocation, assigning token pruning budgets to each transformer layer based on estimated attention redundancy. Along the temporal dimension, Lethe conducts multi-round token pruning during generation, driven by a Recency-Aware Selective Retention} (RASR) mechanism. RASR extends traditional recency-based heuristics by also considering token relevance derived from evolving attention patterns, enabling informed decisions about which tokens to retain or evict. Empirical results demonstrate that Lethe achieves a favorable balance between efficiency and generation quality across diverse models and tasks, increases throughput by up to 2.56x.

### Random Reshuffling for Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics
**Authors**: Luke Shaw, Peter A. Whalley

**Updated**: 2025-12-14T11:12:56Z

**Summary**: We examine the use of different randomisation policies for stochastic gradient algorithms used in sampling, based on first-order (or overdamped) Langevin dynamics, the most popular of which is known as Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics. Conventionally, this algorithm is combined with a specific stochastic gradient strategy, called Robbins-Monro. In this work, we study an alternative strategy, Random Reshuffling, and show convincingly that it leads to improved performance via: a) a proof of reduced bias in the Wasserstein metric for strongly convex, gradient Lipschitz potentials; b) an analytical demonstration of reduced bias for a Gaussian model problem; and c) an empirical demonstration of reduced bias in numerical experiments for some logistic regression problems. This is especially important since Random Reshuffling is typically more efficient due to memory access and cache reasons. Such acceleration for the Random Reshuffling policy is familiar from the optimisation literature on stochastic gradient descent.

### No Cache Left Idle: Accelerating diffusion model via Extreme-slimming Caching
**Authors**: Tingyan Wen, Haoyu Li, Yihuang Chen, Xing Zhou, Lifei Zhu, Xueqian Wang

**Updated**: 2025-12-14T09:02:18Z

**Summary**: Diffusion models achieve remarkable generative quality, but computational overhead scales with step count, model depth, and sequence length. Feature caching is effective since adjacent timesteps yield highly similar features. However, an inherent trade-off remains: aggressive timestep reuse offers large speedups but can easily cross the critical line, hurting fidelity, while block- or token-level reuse is safer but yields limited computational savings. We present X-Slim (eXtreme-Slimming Caching), a training-free, cache-based accelerator that, to our knowledge, is the first unified framework to exploit cacheable redundancy across timesteps, structure (blocks), and space (tokens). Rather than simply mixing levels, X-Slim introduces a dual-threshold controller that turns caching into a push-then-polish process: it first pushes reuse at the timestep level up to an early-warning line, then switches to lightweight block- and token-level refresh to polish the remaining redundancy, and triggers full inference once the critical line is crossed to reset accumulated error. At each level, context-aware indicators decide when and where to cache. Across diverse tasks, X-Slim advances the speed-quality frontier. On FLUX.1-dev and HunyuanVideo, it reduces latency by up to 4.97x and 3.52x with minimal perceptual loss. On DiT-XL/2, it reaches 3.13x acceleration and improves FID by 2.42 over prior methods.

**Authors**: Karthikeya KV

**Updated**: 2025-12-14T08:28:50Z

**Summary**: This research introduces a transformative framework for integrating Vision-Enhanced Large Language Models (LLMs) with advanced transformer-based architectures to tackle challenges in high-resolution image synthesis and multimodal data interpretation. The proposed model incorporates a rectified flow mechanism that connects noise and data with linear paths, enabling efficient and high-quality generation. A bidirectional tokenization strategy is employed to seamlessly merge inputs from text, image, and video modalities, fostering a unified understanding across diverse data types. By embedding spatial-temporal features and leveraging a hybrid text-image sequence modeling approach, the framework achieves unparalleled fidelity in synthesized images and coherent multimodal representations. The architecture is optimized with a noise-aware learning algorithm, addressing discrepancies in noisy data distributions and improving generative performance under varying input conditions. Rigorous evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate a 25% increase in image resolution clarity and a 20% reduction in computational requirements compared to diffusion-based methods. Furthermore, the model exhibits robust scalability and adaptability, showcasing its potential in applications like autonomous systems, creative content generation, and advanced video analysis. This work underscores the role of vision-centric LLMs in redefining capabilities in computer vision and multimodal artificial intelligence.

### NSNQuant: A Double Normalization Approach for Calibration-Free Low-Bit Vector Quantization of KV Cache
**Authors**: Donghyun Son, Euntae Choi, Sungjoo Yoo

**Updated**: 2025-12-14T08:17:35Z

**Summary**: Large Language Model (LLM) inference is typically memory-intensive, especially when processing large batch sizes and long sequences, due to the large size of key-value (KV) cache. Vector Quantization (VQ) is recently adopted to alleviate this issue, but we find that the existing approach is susceptible to distribution shift due to its reliance on calibration datasets. To address this limitation, we introduce NSNQuant, a calibration-free Vector Quantization (VQ) technique designed for low-bit compression of the KV cache. By applying a three-step transformation-1) a token-wise normalization (Normalize), 2) a channel-wise centering (Shift), and 3) a second token-wise normalization (Normalize)-with Hadamard transform, NSNQuant effectively aligns the token distribution with the standard normal distribution. This alignment enables robust, calibration-free vector quantization using a single reusable codebook. Extensive experiments show that NSNQuant consistently outperforms prior methods in both 1-bit and 2-bit settings, offering strong generalization and up to 3$\times$ throughput gain over full-precision baselines.

### Advancing Cache-Based Few-Shot Classification via Patch-Driven Relational Gated Graph Attention
**Authors**: Tasweer Ahmad, Arindam Sikdar, Sandip Pradhan, Ardhendu Behera

**Updated**: 2025-12-13T23:53:00Z

**Summary**: Few-shot image classification remains difficult under limited supervision and visual domain shift. Recent cache-based adaptation approaches (e.g., Tip-Adapter) address this challenge to some extent by learning lightweight residual adapters over frozen features, yet they still inherit CLIP's tendency to encode global, general-purpose representations that are not optimally discriminative to adapt the generalist to the specialist's domain in low-data regimes. We address this limitation with a novel patch-driven relational refinement that learns cache adapter weights from intra-image patch dependencies rather than treating an image embedding as a monolithic vector. Specifically, we introduce a relational gated graph attention network that constructs a patch graph and performs edge-aware attention to emphasize informative inter-patch interactions, producing context-enriched patch embeddings. A learnable multi-aggregation pooling then composes these into compact, task-discriminative representations that better align cache keys with the target few-shot classes. Crucially, the proposed graph refinement is used only during training to distil relational structure into the cache, incurring no additional inference cost beyond standard cache lookup. Final predictions are obtained by a residual fusion of cache similarity scores with CLIP zero-shot logits. Extensive evaluations on 11 benchmarks show consistent gains over state-of-the-art CLIP adapter and cache-based baselines while preserving zero-shot efficiency. We further validate battlefield relevance by introducing an Injured vs. Uninjured Soldier dataset for casualty recognition. It is motivated by the operational need to support triage decisions within the "platinum minutes" and the broader "golden hour" window in time-critical UAV-driven search-and-rescue and combat casualty care.

### V-Rex: Real-Time Streaming Video LLM Acceleration via Dynamic KV Cache Retrieval
**Authors**: Donghyuk Kim, Sejeong Yang, Wonjin Shin, Joo-Young Kim

**Updated**: 2025-12-13T11:02:04Z

**Summary**: Streaming video large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for real-time multimodal tasks such as video captioning, question answering, conversational agents, and augmented reality. However, these models face fundamental memory and computational challenges because their key-value (KV) caches grow substantially with continuous streaming video input. This process requires an iterative prefill stage, which is a unique feature of streaming video LLMs. Due to its iterative prefill stage, it suffers from significant limitations, including extensive computation, substantial data transfer, and degradation in accuracy. Crucially, this issue is exacerbated for edge deployment, which is the primary target for these models.   In this work, we propose V-Rex, the first software-hardware co-designed accelerator that comprehensively addresses both algorithmic and hardware bottlenecks in streaming video LLM inference. At its core, V-Rex introduces ReSV, a training-free dynamic KV cache retrieval algorithm. ReSV exploits temporal and spatial similarity-based token clustering to reduce excessive KV cache memory across video frames. To fully realize these algorithmic benefits, V-Rex offers a compact, low-latency hardware accelerator with a dynamic KV cache retrieval engine (DRE), featuring bit-level and early-exit based computing units. V-Rex achieves unprecedented real-time of 3.9-8.3 FPS and energy-efficient streaming video LLM inference on edge deployment with negligible accuracy loss. While DRE only accounts for 2.2% power and 2.0% area, the system delivers 1.9-19.7x speedup and 3.1-18.5x energy efficiency improvements over AGX Orin GPU. This work is the first to comprehensively tackle KV cache retrieval across algorithms and hardware, enabling real-time streaming video LLM inference on resource-constrained edge devices.

### CAR-CHASE: Car-Like Robot Conflict-Aware Heuristic Adaptive Search Enhancement
**Authors**: HT To, S Nguyen, NH Pham

**Updated**: 2025-12-13T08:42:18Z

**Summary**: Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) for car-like robots, addressed by algorithms such as Conflict-Based Search with Continuous Time (CL-CBS), faces significant computational challenges due to expensive kinematic heuristic calculations. Traditional heuristic caching assumes that the heuristic function depends only on the state, which is incorrect in CBS where constraints from conflict resolution make the search space context-dependent. We propose \textbf{CAR-CHASE} (Car-Like Robot Conflict-Aware Heuristic Adaptive Search Enhancement), a novel approach that combines \textbf{conflict-aware heuristic caching} -- which caches heuristic values based on both state and relevant constraint context -- with an \textbf{adaptive hybrid heuristic} that intelligently switches between fast approximate and exact computations. Our key innovations are (1) a compact \emph{conflict fingerprint} that efficiently encodes which constraints affect a state's heuristic, (2) a relevance filter using spatial, temporal, and geometric criteria, and (3) an adaptive switching strategy with theoretical quality bounds. Experimental evaluation on 480 benchmark instances with varying agent counts (10 to 30) and obstacle densities (0\% and 50\%) demonstrates a geometric mean speedup of 2.46$\times$ over the baseline CL-CBS implementation while maintaining solution optimality. The optimizations improve success rate from 77.9\% to 84.8\% (+6.9 percentage points), reduce total runtime by 70.1\%, and enable solving 33 additional instances that previously timed out. Performance gains scale with problem complexity, reaching up to 4.06$\times$ speedup for challenging 30-agent obstacle scenarios. Our techniques are general and applicable to other CBS variants.

### cMPI: Using CXL Memory Sharing for MPI One-Sided and Two-Sided Inter-Node Communications
**Authors**: Xi Wang, Bin Ma, Jongryool Kim, Byungil Koh, Hoshik Kim, Dong Li

**Updated**: 2025-12-13T06:18:18Z

**Summary**: Message Passing Interface (MPI) is a foundational programming model for high-performance computing. MPI libraries traditionally employ network interconnects (e.g., Ethernet and InfiniBand) and network protocols (e.g., TCP and RoCE) with complex software stacks for cross-node communication. We present cMPI, the first work to optimize MPI point-to-point communication (both one-sided and two-sided) using CXL memory sharing on a real CXL platform, transforming cross-node communication into memory transactions and data copies within CXL memory, bypassing traditional network protocols. We analyze performance across various interconnects and find that CXL memory sharing achieves 7.2x-8.1x lower latency than TCP-based interconnects deployed in small- and medium-scale clusters. We address challenges of CXL memory sharing for MPI communication, including data object management over the dax representation [50], cache coherence, and atomic operations. Overall, cMPI outperforms TCP over standard Ethernet NIC and high-end SmartNIC by up to 49x and 72x in latency and bandwidth, respectively, for small messages.

### GraphPerf-RT: A Graph-Driven Performance Model for Hardware-Aware Scheduling of OpenMP Codes
**Authors**: Mohammad Pivezhandi, Mahdi Banisharif, Saeed Bakhshan, Abusayeed Saifullah, Ali Jannesari

**Updated**: 2025-12-12T23:46:05Z

**Summary**: Performance prediction for OpenMP workloads on heterogeneous embedded SoCs is challenging due to complex interactions between task DAG structure, control-flow irregularity, cache   and branch behavior, and thermal dynamics; classical heuristics struggle under workload irregularity, tabular regressors discard structural information, and model-free RL risks   overheating resource-constrained devices. We introduce GraphPerf-RT, the first surrogate that unifies task DAG topology, CFG-derived code semantics, and runtime context (per-core   DVFS, thermal state, utilization) in a heterogeneous graph representation with typed edges encoding precedence, placement, and contention. Multi-task evidential heads predict   makespan, energy, cache and branch misses, and utilization with calibrated uncertainty (Normal-Inverse-Gamma), enabling risk-aware scheduling that filters low-confidence rollouts.   We validate GraphPerf-RT on three embedded ARM platforms (Jetson TX2, Jetson Orin NX, RUBIK Pi), achieving R^2 > 0.95 with well-calibrated uncertainty (ECE < 0.05). To   demonstrate end-to-end scheduling utility, we integrate the surrogate with four RL methods on Jetson TX2: single-agent model-free (SAMFRL), single-agent model-based (SAMBRL),   multi-agent model-free (MAMFRL-D3QN), and multi-agent model-based (MAMBRL-D3QN). Experiments across 5 seeds (200 episodes each) show that MAMBRL-D3QN with GraphPerf-RT as the   world model achieves 66% makespan reduction (0.97 +/- 0.35s) and 82% energy reduction (0.006 +/- 0.005J) compared to model-free baselines, demonstrating that accurate,   uncertainty-aware surrogates enable effective model-based planning on thermally constrained embedded systems.

### Multipole Attention for Efficient Long Context Reasoning
**Authors**: Coleman Hooper, Sebastian Zhao, Luca Manolache, Sehoon Kim, Michael W. Mahoney, Yakun Sophia Shao, Kurt Keutzer, Amir Gholami

**Updated**: 2025-12-12T19:51:26Z

**Summary**: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown promising accuracy improvements on complex problem-solving tasks. While these models have attained high accuracy by leveraging additional computation at test time, they need to generate long chain-of-thought reasoning in order to think before answering, which requires generating thousands of tokens. While sparse attention methods can help reduce the KV cache pressure induced by this long autoregressive reasoning, these methods can introduce errors which disrupt the reasoning process. Additionally, prior methods often pre-process the input to make it easier to identify the important prompt tokens when computing attention during generation, and this pre-processing is challenging to perform online for newly generated reasoning tokens. Our work addresses these challenges by introducing Multipole Attention, which accelerates autoregressive reasoning by only computing exact attention for the most important tokens, while maintaining approximate representations for the remaining tokens. Our method first performs clustering to group together semantically similar key vectors, and then uses the cluster centroids both to identify important key vectors and to approximate the remaining key vectors in order to retain high accuracy. We design a fast cluster update process to quickly re-cluster the input and previously generated tokens, thereby allowing for accelerating attention to the previous output tokens. We evaluate our method using emerging LRMs such as Qwen-8B, demonstrating that our approach can maintain accuracy on complex reasoning tasks even with aggressive attention sparsity settings. We also provide kernel implementations to demonstrate the practical efficiency gains from our method, achieving up to 4.5$\times$ speedup for attention in long-context reasoning applications. Our code is available at https://github.com/SqueezeAILab/MultipoleAttention.

### Hold Onto That Thought: Assessing KV Cache Compression On Reasoning
**Authors**: Minghui Liu, Aadi Palnitkar, Tahseen Rabbani, Hyunwoo Jae, Kyle Rui Sang, Dixi Yao, Shayan Shabihi, Fuheng Zhao, Tian Li, Ce Zhang, Furong Huang, Kunpeng Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-12-12T19:50:34Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on long-context tasks, but are often bottlenecked by memory constraints. Namely, the KV cache, which is used to significantly speed up attention computations, grows linearly with context length. A suite of compression algorithms has been introduced to alleviate cache growth by evicting unimportant tokens. However, several popular strategies are targeted towards the prefill phase, i.e., processing long prompt context, and their performance is rarely assessed on reasoning tasks requiring long decoding. In particular, short but complex prompts, such as those in benchmarks like GSM8K and MATH500, often benefit from multi-step reasoning and self-reflection, resulting in thinking sequences thousands of tokens long. In this work, we benchmark the performance of several popular compression strategies on long-reasoning tasks. For the non-reasoning Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, we determine that no singular strategy fits all, and that performance is heavily influenced by dataset type. However, we discover that H2O and our decoding-enabled variant of SnapKV are dominant strategies for reasoning models, indicating the utility of heavy-hitter tracking for reasoning traces. We also find that eviction strategies at low budgets can produce longer reasoning traces, revealing a tradeoff between cache size and inference costs.

### BLURR: A Boosted Low-Resource Inference for Vision-Language-Action Models
**Authors**: Xiaoyu Ma, Zhengqing Yuan, Zheyuan Zhang, Kaiwen Shi, Lichao Sun, Yanfang Ye

**Updated**: 2025-12-12T18:30:45Z

**Summary**: Vision-language-action (VLA) models enable impressive zero shot manipulation, but their inference stacks are often too heavy for responsive web demos or high frequency robot control on commodity GPUs. We present BLURR, a lightweight inference wrapper that can be plugged into existing VLA controllers without retraining or changing model checkpoints. Instantiated on the pi-zero VLA controller, BLURR keeps the original observation interfaces and accelerates control by combining an instruction prefix key value cache, mixed precision execution, and a single step rollout schedule that reduces per step computation. In our SimplerEnv based evaluation, BLURR maintains task success rates comparable to the original controller while significantly lowering effective FLOPs and wall clock latency. We also build an interactive web demo that allows users to switch between controllers and toggle inference options in real time while watching manipulation episodes. This highlights BLURR as a practical approach for deploying modern VLA policies under tight compute budgets.

### PD-Swap: Prefill-Decode Logic Swapping for End-to-End LLM Inference on Edge FPGAs via Dynamic Partial Reconfiguration
**Authors**: Yifan Zhang, Zhiheng Chen, Ye Qiao, Sitao Huang

**Updated**: 2025-12-12T13:35:09Z

**Summary**: Aggressively quantized large language models (LLMs), such as BitNet-style 1.58-bit Transformers with ternary weights, make it feasible to deploy generative AI on low-power edge FPGAs. However, as prompts grow to tens of thousands of tokens, edge hardware performance drops sharply with sequence length due to quadratic prefill cost and rapidly increasing KV-cache bandwidth demands, making inference latency of longer context length a first-order system concern. Recent studies on LLMs expose a fundamental prefill-decode asymmetry: prefill is compute-bound and dominated by dense matrix-matrix operations, whereas decoding is memory-bandwidth-bound and dominated by KV-cache traffic. A static accelerator must provision resources and a single dataflow for both regimes, leading to duplicated attention logic, underutilized fabric, and tight LUT/URAM limits that cap model size and usable context. We propose a prefill--decode disaggregated LLM accelerator, PD-Swap, that uses Dynamic Partial Reconfiguration (DPR) to time-multiplex the attention module on edge FPGAs. The core table-lookup ternary matrix multiplication and weight-buffering engines remain static, while the attention subsystem is a reconfigurable partition with two phase-specialized architectures: a compute-heavy, token-parallel prefill engine and a bandwidth-optimized, KV-cache-centric decoding engine. A roofline-inspired model and design space exploration jointly optimize reconfigurable-region size, parallelism under reconfiguration and routability constraints, and reconfiguration latency is hidden by computation latency. PD-Swap achieves up to 27~tokens/s decoding throughput, outperforming prior state-of-the-art works by 1.3x--2.1x (larger gains at longer context lengths), without extra area cost.

**Authors**: Qingxiao Sun, Tongxuan Liu, Shen Zhang, Siyu Wu, Peijun Yang, Haotian Liang, Menxin Li, Xiaolong Ma, Zhiwei Liang, Ziyi Ren, Minchao Zhang, Xinyu Liu, Ke Zhang, Depei Qian, Hailong Yang

**Updated**: 2025-12-12T12:59:38Z

**Summary**: Recommendation system delivers substantial economic benefits by providing personalized predictions. Generative recommendation (GR) integrates LLMs to enhance the understanding of long user-item sequences. Despite employing attention-based architectures, GR's workload differs markedly from that of LLM serving. GR typically processes long prompt while producing short, fixed-length outputs, yet the computational cost of each decode phase is especially high due to the large beam width. In addition, since the beam search involves a vast item space, the sorting overhead becomes particularly time-consuming. We propose xGR, a GR-oriented serving system that meets strict low-latency requirements under highconcurrency scenarios. First, xGR unifies the processing of prefill and decode phases through staged computation and separated KV cache. Second, xGR enables early sorting termination and mask-based item filtering with data structure reuse. Third, xGR reconstructs the overall pipeline to exploit multilevel overlap and multi-stream parallelism. Our experiments with real-world recommendation service datasets demonstrate that xGR achieves at least 3.49x throughput compared to the state-of-the-art baseline under strict latency constraints.

### Drinfeld associators and Kashiwara-Vergne associators in higher genera
**Authors**: Toyo Taniguchi

**Updated**: 2025-12-12T11:32:39Z

**Summary**: For $g\geq 0$, a genus $g$ Kashiwara-Vergne associator, introduced by Alekseev-Kawazumi-Kuno-Naef as a solution to the generalised KV equations in relation to the formality problem of the Goldman-Turaev Lie bialgebra on an oriented surface with a framing, is directly constructed from a genus $g$ analogue of a Drinfeld associator formulated by Gonzalez, which we call a Gonzalez-Drinfeld associator. The proof is based on Massuyeau's work in genus 0. The framing is automatically determined from the choice of a Gonzalez-Drinfeld associator, and in the case of genus 1, we show that only one particular framing is realised by our construction.

### Boosting Skeleton-based Zero-Shot Action Recognition with Training-Free Test-Time Adaptation
**Authors**: Jingmin Zhu, Anqi Zhu, Hossein Rahmani, Jun Liu, Mohammed Bennamoun, Qiuhong Ke

**Updated**: 2025-12-12T10:53:51Z

**Summary**: We introduce Skeleton-Cache, the first training-free test-time adaptation framework for skeleton-based zero-shot action recognition (SZAR), aimed at improving model generalization to unseen actions during inference. Skeleton-Cache reformulates inference as a lightweight retrieval process over a non-parametric cache that stores structured skeleton representations, combining both global and fine-grained local descriptors. To guide the fusion of descriptor-wise predictions, we leverage the semantic reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to assign class-specific importance weights. By integrating these structured descriptors with LLM-guided semantic priors, Skeleton-Cache dynamically adapts to unseen actions without any additional training or access to training data. Extensive experiments on NTU RGB+D 60/120 and PKU-MMD II demonstrate that Skeleton-Cache consistently boosts the performance of various SZAR backbones under both zero-shot and generalized zero-shot settings. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/Alchemist0754/Skeleton-Cache.

### Proving DNSSEC Correctness: A Formal Approach to Secure Domain Name Resolution
**Authors**: Qifan Zhang, Zilin Shen, Imtiaz Karim, Elisa Bertino, Zhou Li

**Updated**: 2025-12-12T10:12:06Z

**Summary**: The Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) are critical for preventing DNS spoofing, yet its specifications contain ambiguities and vulnerabilities that elude traditional "break-and-fix" approaches. A holistic, foundational security analysis of the protocol has thus remained an open problem. This paper introduces DNSSECVerif, the first framework for comprehensive, automated formal security analysis of the DNSSEC protocol suite. Built on the SAPIC+ symbolic verifier, our high-fidelity model captures protocol-level interactions, including cryptographic operations and stateful caching with fine-grained concurrency control. Using DNSSECVerif, we formally prove four of DNSSEC's core security guarantees and uncover critical ambiguities in the standards--notably, the insecure coexistence of NSEC and NSEC3. Our model also automatically rediscovers three classes of known attacks, demonstrating fundamental weaknesses in the protocol design. To bridge the model-to-reality gap, we validate our findings through targeted testing of mainstream DNS software and a large-scale measurement study of over 2.2 million open resolvers, confirming the real-world impact of these flaws. Our work provides crucial, evidence-based recommendations for hardening DNSSEC specifications and implementations.

### JoyAvatar: Real-time and Infinite Audio-Driven Avatar Generation with Autoregressive Diffusion
**Authors**: Chaochao Li, Ruikui Wang, Liangbo Zhou, Jinheng Feng, Huaishao Luo, Huan Zhang, Youzheng Wu, Xiaodong He

**Updated**: 2025-12-12T10:06:01Z

**Summary**: Existing DiT-based audio-driven avatar generation methods have achieved considerable progress, yet their broader application is constrained by limitations such as high computational overhead and the inability to synthesize long-duration videos. Autoregressive methods address this problem by applying block-wise autoregressive diffusion methods. However, these methods suffer from the problem of error accumulation and quality degradation. To address this, we propose JoyAvatar, an audio-driven autoregressive model capable of real-time inference and infinite-length video generation with the following contributions: (1) Progressive Step Bootstrapping (PSB), which allocates more denoising steps to initial frames to stabilize generation and reduce error accumulation; (2) Motion Condition Injection (MCI), enhancing temporal coherence by injecting noise-corrupted previous frames as motion condition; and (3) Unbounded RoPE via Cache-Resetting (URCR), enabling infinite-length generation through dynamic positional encoding. Our 1.3B-parameter causal model achieves 16 FPS on a single GPU and achieves competitive results in visual quality, temporal consistency, and lip synchronization.

### FilmWeaver: Weaving Consistent Multi-Shot Videos with Cache-Guided Autoregressive Diffusion
**Authors**: Xiangyang Luo, Qingyu Li, Xiaokun Liu, Wenyu Qin, Miao Yang, Meng Wang, Pengfei Wan, Di Zhang, Kun Gai, Shao-Lun Huang

**Updated**: 2025-12-12T04:34:53Z

**Summary**: Current video generation models perform well at single-shot synthesis but struggle with multi-shot videos, facing critical challenges in maintaining character and background consistency across shots and flexibly generating videos of arbitrary length and shot count. To address these limitations, we introduce \textbf{FilmWeaver}, a novel framework designed to generate consistent, multi-shot videos of arbitrary length. First, it employs an autoregressive diffusion paradigm to achieve arbitrary-length video generation. To address the challenge of consistency, our key insight is to decouple the problem into inter-shot consistency and intra-shot coherence. We achieve this through a dual-level cache mechanism: a shot memory caches keyframes from preceding shots to maintain character and scene identity, while a temporal memory retains a history of frames from the current shot to ensure smooth, continuous motion. The proposed framework allows for flexible, multi-round user interaction to create multi-shot videos. Furthermore, due to this decoupled design, our method demonstrates high versatility by supporting downstream tasks such as multi-concept injection and video extension. To facilitate the training of our consistency-aware method, we also developed a comprehensive pipeline to construct a high-quality multi-shot video dataset. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method surpasses existing approaches on metrics for both consistency and aesthetic quality, opening up new possibilities for creating more consistent, controllable, and narrative-driven video content.

### Electrical Stability of Cr2O3/\b{eta}-Ga2O3 and NiOx/\b{eta}-Ga2O3 Heterojunction Diodes
**Authors**: Yizheng Liu, Haochen Wang, Carl Peterson, Chinmoy Nath Saha, Chris G. Van de Walle, Sriram Krishnamoorthy

**Updated**: 2025-12-12T03:57:52Z

**Summary**: This work reports the electrical characteristics comparison study between Cr2O3 and NiOx based heterojunction diodes (HJD) on halide vapor phase epitaxy (HVPE) grown \b{eta}-Ga2O3 epitaxial layers. Both as-fabricated Cr2O3 and NiOx HJDs exhibited forward current density in a range of 130-150 A/cm^2 at 5 V with rectifying ratios >10^10 and a reverse leakage current density at 10^-8 A/cm^2 at -5 V. The differential specific on-resistance of Cr2O3 and NiOx HJDs was 12.01 mΩ*cm^2 and 12.05 mΩ*cm^2, respectively. Breakdown voltages of Cr2O3 HJDs ranged from 1.4-1.9 kV and 1.5-2.3 kV for NiOx HJDs. Theoretical band alignment between Cr2O3 and \b{eta}-Ga2O3 was calculated from first principles. The ambient exposed NiOx/HVPE \b{eta}-Ga2O3 HJDs forward current density degraded after 10 days while that of Cr2O3/HVPE \b{eta}-Ga2O3 HJDs remained nearly unchanged after the same amount of time. It was later confirmed that the ambient exposed sputtered NiOx sheet resistance (Rsh) degradation gave rise to the reduction of the forward current density of the NiOx based HJDs, and water (H2O) was qualitatively determined to be the agent attributed to the forward conduction degradation by measuring the Rsh of NiOx-on-sapphire reference wafer after exposing it to different environments. The Cr2O3/HVPE \b{eta}-Ga2O3 HJD also exhibited enhanced thermal stability compared to the NiOx/\b{eta}-Ga2O3 heterostructures at elevated temperatures. Interfacial nickel gallate (Ga2NiO4) phase formation expected from phase diagrams can explain the reduced thermal stability of NiOx/\b{eta}-Ga2O3 HJDs. This study indicates that Cr2O3 is a stable p-type oxide for the realization of robust multi-kV \b{eta}-Ga2O3 HJDs.

### REST: Diffusion-based Real-time End-to-end Streaming Talking Head Generation via ID-Context Caching and Asynchronous Streaming Distillation
**Authors**: Haotian Wang, Yuzhe Weng, Xinyi Yu, Jun Du, Haoran Xu, Xiaoyan Wu, Shan He, Bing Yin, Cong Liu, Qingfeng Liu

**Updated**: 2025-12-12T02:28:52Z

**Summary**: Diffusion models have significantly advanced the field of talking head generation. However, the slow inference speeds and non-autoregressive paradigms severely constrain the application of diffusion-based THG models. In this study, we propose REST, the first diffusion-based, real-time, end-to-end streaming audio-driven talking head generation framework. To support real-time end-to-end generation, a compact video latent space is first learned through high spatiotemporal VAE compression. Additionally, to enable autoregressive streaming within the compact video latent space, we introduce an ID-Context Cache mechanism, which integrates ID-Sink and Context-Cache principles to key-value caching for maintaining temporal consistency and identity coherence during long-time streaming generation. Furthermore, an Asynchronous Streaming Distillation (ASD) training strategy is proposed to mitigate error accumulation in autoregressive generation and enhance temporal consistency, which leverages a non-streaming teacher with an asynchronous noise schedule to supervise the training of the streaming student model. REST bridges the gap between autoregressive and diffusion-based approaches, demonstrating substantial value for applications requiring real-time talking head generation. Experimental results demonstrate that REST outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both generation speed and overall performance.

### CachePrune: Neural-Based Attribution Defense Against Indirect Prompt Injection Attacks
**Authors**: Rui Wang, Junda Wu, Yu Xia, Tong Yu, Ruiyi Zhang, Ryan Rossi, Subrata Mitra, Lina Yao, Julian McAuley

**Updated**: 2025-12-12T02:25:34Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are susceptible to indirect prompt injection attacks, in which the model inadvertently responds to task messages injected within the prompt context. This vulnerability stems from LLMs' inability to distinguish between data and instructions within a prompt. In this paper, we propose CachePrune, a defense method that identifies and prunes task-triggering neurons from the KV cache of the input prompt context. By pruning such neurons, we encourage the LLM to interpret the input prompt context purely as data rather than as cues for instruction following. To identify these neurons, we introduce a neural attribution mechanism guided by a preferential attribution loss, which enables effective attribution with only a few samples while preserving response quality after pruning. We further enhance the efficacy of neural attribution by leveraging an observed triggering effect inherent in the model's response generation behavior. Notably, our approach does not impose additional formatting on the prompt or introduce extra test-time LLM calls. Experiments show that CachePrune can significantly reduce attack success rates while maintaining clean response quality.

### Adaptive Soft Rolling KV Freeze with Entropy-Guided Recovery: Sublinear Memory Growth for Efficient LLM Inference
**Authors**: Adilet Metinov, Gulida M. Kudakeeva, Bolotbek uulu Nursultan, Gulnara D. Kabaeva

**Updated**: 2025-12-12T02:02:02Z

**Summary**: We present Adaptive Soft Rolling KV Freeze with Entropy-Guided Recovery (ASR-KF-EGR), a training-free inference-time framework for efficient large language model generation. Our method introduces a reversible soft-freeze mechanism that temporarily suspends key-value (KV) updates for low-importance tokens identified within a sliding attention window. Unlike eviction-based approaches that permanently discard context, ASR-KF-EGR preserves all tokens in off-GPU storage and restores them on demand. We extend the framework with sublinear freeze scheduling, where freeze duration grows sublinearly with repeated low-importance detections, preventing over-aggressive compression. Preliminary experiments on LLaMA-3 8B demonstrate 55-67% reduction in active KV cache size while maintaining generation quality and passing needle-in-haystack retrieval tests. The method is architecture-agnostic, requires no fine-tuning, and provides a practical solution for memory-constrained deployment of long-context LLMs.

### KVSwap: Disk-aware KV Cache Offloading for Long-Context On-device Inference
**Authors**: Huawei Zhang, Chunwei Xia, Zheng Wang

**Updated**: 2025-12-11T23:35:19Z

**Summary**: Language models (LMs) underpin emerging mobile and embedded AI applications like meeting and video summarization and document analysis, which often require processing multiple long-context inputs. Running an LM locally on-device improves privacy, enables offline use, and reduces cost, but long-context inference quickly hits a \emph{memory capacity wall} as the key-value (KV) cache grows linearly with context length and batch size. Existing KV-cache offloading schemes are designed to transfer cache data from GPU memory to CPU memory; however, they are not suitable for embedded and mobile systems, where the CPU and GPU (or NPU) typically share a unified memory and the non-volatile secondary storage (disk) offers limited I/O bandwidth. We present KVSwap, a software framework tailored for local devices that achieves high memory efficiency while effectively leveraging disk storage. KVSwap stores the full cache on disk, uses highly compact in-memory metadata to predict which entries to preload, overlaps computation with hardware-aware disk access, and orchestrates read patterns to match storage device characteristics. Our evaluation shows that across representative LMs and storage types, KVSwap delivers higher throughput under tight memory budgets while maintaining generation quality over existing KV cache offloading schemes.

### CXL-SpecKV: A Disaggregated FPGA Speculative KV-Cache for Datacenter LLM Serving
**Authors**: Dong Liu, Yanxuan Yu

**Updated**: 2025-12-11T15:40:36Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing tasks, but their deployment in datacenter environments faces significant challenges due to the massive memory requirements of key-value (KV) caches. During the autoregressive decoding process, KV caches consume substantial GPU memory, limiting batch sizes and overall system throughput. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{CXL-SpecKV}, a novel disaggregated KV-cache architecture that leverages Compute Express Link (CXL) interconnects and FPGA accelerators to enable efficient speculative execution and memory disaggregation. Our approach introduces three key innovations: (i) a CXL-based memory disaggregation framework that offloads KV-caches to remote FPGA memory with low latency, (ii) a speculative KV-cache prefetching mechanism that predicts and preloads future tokens' cache entries, and (iii) an FPGA-accelerated KV-cache compression and decompression engine that reduces memory bandwidth requirements by up to 4$\times$. When evaluated on state-of-the-art LLM models, CXL-SpecKV achieves up to 3.2$\times$ higher throughput compared to GPU-only baselines, while reducing memory costs by 2.8$\times$ and maintaining accuracy. Our system demonstrates that intelligent memory disaggregation combined with speculative execution can effectively address the memory wall challenge in large-scale LLM serving. Our code implementation has been open-sourced at https://github.com/FastLM/CXL-SpecKV.

### ESS: An Offload-Centric Latent-Cache Management Architecture for DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp
**Authors**: Xinhang Chen, Chao Zhang, Jiahuan He, Wei Liu, Jianming Zhang, Wenlong Zhou, Xiao Li, Pai Zeng, Shiyong Li, Yuanpan Qian, Dong Li, Zhaogeng Li

**Updated**: 2025-12-11T12:06:00Z

**Summary**: DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp introduces a sparse attention mechanism that significantly reduces inference latency in long-context scenarios. Although the overall throughput has improved greatly, the Decode-stage of PD disaggregation remains to be a major bottleneck. This bottleneck primarily stems from the conflict between linear growth of Latent-Cache with sequence length and the limited GPU memory capacity, which constrains the feasible batch-size and thereby suppresses Decode-stage throughput.   To address this challenge, we propose ESS (Extended Sparse Server), an offload-centric system design tailored for DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp. ESS selectively offloads Latent-Cache to CPU memory while preserving latency-critical components on GPU. By freeing up GPU memory, ESS effectively decoupling batch-size scaling from GPU memory constraints. This design significantly improves Decode-stage throughput, thereby reducing deployment costs in real-world settings.   Our high-fidelity simulations show that ESS delivers 69.4\% throughput improvement at 32K context length and up to 123\% throughput improvement at 128K, demonstrating its effectiveness for large-context inference workloads. These results highlight ESS as a practical and scalable solution for long-context LLM serving.

### Unlocking the Address Book: Dissecting the Sparse Semantic Structure of LLM Key-Value Caches via Sparse Autoencoders
**Authors**: Qingsen Ma, Dianyun Wang, Jiaming Lyu, Yaoye Wang, Lechen Ning, Sujie Zhu, Zhenbo Xu, Liuyu Xiang, Huining Li, Huijia Wu, Zhaofeng He

**Updated**: 2025-12-11T11:23:50Z

**Summary**: The Key-Value (KV) cache is the primary memory bottleneck in long-context Large Language Models, yet it is typically treated as an opaque numerical tensor. In this work, we propose \textbf{STA-Attention}, a framework that utilizes Top-K Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to decompose the KV cache into interpretable ``semantic atoms.'' Unlike standard $L_1$-regularized SAEs, our Top-K approach eliminates shrinkage bias, preserving the precise dot-product geometry required for attention. Our analysis uncovers a fundamental \textbf{Key-Value Asymmetry}: while Key vectors serve as highly sparse routers dominated by a ``Semantic Elbow,'' deep Value vectors carry dense content payloads requiring a larger budget. Based on this structure, we introduce a Dual-Budget Strategy that selectively preserves the most informative semantic components while filtering representational noise. Experiments on Yi-6B, Mistral-7B, Qwen2.5-32B, and others show that our semantic reconstructions maintain perplexity and zero-shot performance comparable to the original models, effectively bridging the gap between mechanistic interpretability and faithful attention modeling.

### Electric-Field-Controlled Altermagnetic Transition for Neuromorphic Computing
**Authors**: Zhiyuan Duan, Peixin Qin, Chengyan Zhong, Shaoxuan Zhang, Li Liu, Guojian Zhao, Xiaoning Wang, Hongyu Chen, Ziang Meng, Jingyu Li, Sixu Jiang, Xiaoyang Tan, Qiong Wu, Yu Liu, Zhiqi Liu

**Updated**: 2025-12-11T08:14:00Z

**Summary**: Altermagnets represent a novel magnetic phase with transformative potential for ultrafast spintronics, yet efficient control of their magnetic states remains challenging. We demonstrate an ultra-low-power electric-field control of altermagnetism in MnTe through strain-mediated coupling in MnTe/PMN-PT heterostructures with negligible Joule heating. Application of +6 kV/cm electric fields induces piezoelectric strain in PMN-PT, modulating the Néel temperature from 310 to 328 K. As a result, around the magnetic phase transition, the altermagnetic spin splitting of MnTe is reversibly switched "on" and "off" by the electric fields. Meanwhile, the piezoelectric strain generates lattice distortions and magnetic structure changes in MnTe, enabling up to 9.7% resistance modulation around the magnetic phase transition temperature. Leveraging this effect, we implement programmable resistance states in a Hopfield neuromorphic network, achieving 100% pattern recognition accuracy at <=40% noise levels. This approach establishes the electric-field control as a low-power strategy for altermagnetic manipulation while demonstrating the viability of altermagnetic materials for energy-efficient neuromorphic computing beyond conventional charge-based architectures.

### LeMiCa: Lexicographic Minimax Path Caching for Efficient Diffusion-Based Video Generation
**Authors**: Huanlin Gao, Ping Chen, Fuyuan Shi, Chao Tan, Zhaoxiang Liu, Fang Zhao, Kai Wang, Shiguo Lian

**Updated**: 2025-12-11T08:10:13Z

**Summary**: We present LeMiCa, a training-free and efficient acceleration framework for diffusion-based video generation. While existing caching strategies primarily focus on reducing local heuristic errors, they often overlook the accumulation of global errors, leading to noticeable content degradation between accelerated and original videos. To address this issue, we formulate cache scheduling as a directed graph with error-weighted edges and introduce a Lexicographic Minimax Path Optimization strategy that explicitly bounds the worst-case path error. This approach substantially improves the consistency of global content and style across generated frames. Extensive experiments on multiple text-to-video benchmarks demonstrate that LeMiCa delivers dual improvements in both inference speed and generation quality. Notably, our method achieves a 2.9x speedup on the Latte model and reaches an LPIPS score of 0.05 on Open-Sora, outperforming prior caching techniques. Importantly, these gains come with minimal perceptual quality degradation, making LeMiCa a robust and generalizable paradigm for accelerating diffusion-based video generation. We believe this approach can serve as a strong foundation for future research on efficient and reliable video synthesis. Our code is available at :https://github.com/UnicomAI/LeMiCa

### Efficient-VLN: A Training-Efficient Vision-Language Navigation Model
**Authors**: Duo Zheng, Shijia Huang, Yanyang Li, Liwei Wang

**Updated**: 2025-12-11T05:57:48Z

**Summary**: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown promising potential in Vision-Language Navigation (VLN). However, their practical development is severely hindered by the substantial training overhead. We recognize two key issues that contribute to the overhead: (1) the quadratic computational burden from processing long-horizon historical observations as massive sequences of tokens, and (2) the exploration-efficiency trade-off in DAgger, i.e., a data aggregation process of collecting agent-explored trajectories. While more exploration yields effective error-recovery trajectories for handling test-time distribution shifts, it comes at the cost of longer trajectory lengths for both training and inference. To address these challenges, we propose Efficient-VLN, a training-efficient VLN model. Specifically, to mitigate the token processing burden, we design two efficient memory mechanisms: a progressive memory that dynamically allocates more tokens to recent observations, and a learnable recursive memory that utilizes the key-value cache of learnable tokens as the memory state. Moreover, we introduce a dynamic mixed policy to balance the exploration-efficiency trade-off. Extensive experiments show that Efficient-VLN achieves state-of-the-art performance on R2R-CE (64.2% SR) and RxR-CE (67.0% SR). Critically, our model consumes merely 282 H800 GPU hours, demonstrating a dramatic reduction in training overhead compared to state-of-the-art methods.

### Physically Aware 360$^\circ$ View Generation from a Single Image using Disentangled Scene Embeddings
**Authors**: Karthikeya KV, Narendra Bandaru

**Updated**: 2025-12-11T05:20:24Z

**Summary**: We introduce Disentangled360, an innovative 3D-aware technology that integrates the advantages of direction disentangled volume rendering with single-image 360° unique view synthesis for applications in medical imaging and natural scene reconstruction. In contrast to current techniques that either oversimplify anisotropic light behavior or lack generalizability across various contexts, our framework distinctly differentiates between isotropic and anisotropic contributions inside a Gaussian Splatting backbone. We implement a dual-branch conditioning framework, one optimized for CT intensity driven scattering in volumetric data and the other for real-world RGB scenes through normalized camera embeddings. To address scale ambiguity and maintain structural realism, we present a hybrid pose agnostic anchoring method that adaptively samples scene depth and material transitions, functioning as stable pivots during scene distillation. Our design integrates preoperative radiography simulation and consumer-grade 360° rendering into a singular inference pipeline, facilitating rapid, photorealistic view synthesis with inherent directionality. Evaluations on the Mip-NeRF 360, RealEstate10K, and DeepDRR datasets indicate superior SSIM and LPIPS performance, while runtime assessments confirm its viability for interactive applications.

### Mixture of Lookup Key-Value Experts
**Authors**: Zongcheng Wang

**Updated**: 2025-12-10T15:05:55Z

**Summary**: Recent research has developed several LLM architectures suitable for inference on end-user devices, such as the Mixture of Lookup Experts (MoLE)~\parencite{jie_mixture_2025}. A key feature of MoLE is that each token id is associated with a dedicated group of experts. For a given input, only the experts corresponding to the input token id will be activated. Since the communication overhead of loading this small number of activated experts into RAM during inference is negligible, expert parameters can be offloaded to storage, making MoLE suitable for resource-constrained devices. However, MoLE's context-independent expert selection mechanism, based solely on input ids, may limit model performance. To address this, we propose the \textbf{M}ixture \textbf{o}f \textbf{L}ookup \textbf{K}ey-\textbf{V}alue Experts (\textbf{MoLKV}) model. In MoLKV, each expert is structured as a key-value pair. For a given input, the input-derived query interacts with the cached key-value experts from the current sequence, generating a context-aware expert output. This context-aware mechanism alleviates the limitation of MoLE, and experimental results demonstrate that MoLKV achieves significantly lower validation loss in small-scale evaluations.

### Not All Models Suit Expert Offloading: On Local Routing Consistency of Mixture-of-Expert Models
**Authors**: Jingcong Liang, Siyuan Wang, Miren Tian, Yitong Li, Duyu Tang, Zhongyu Wei

**Updated**: 2025-12-10T14:34:07Z

**Summary**: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) enables efficient scaling of large language models (LLMs) with sparsely activated experts during inference. To effectively deploy large MoE models on memory-constrained devices, many systems introduce *expert offloading* that caches a subset of experts in fast memory, leaving others on slow memory to run on CPU or load on demand. While some research has exploited the locality of expert activations, where consecutive tokens activate similar experts, the degree of this **local routing consistency** varies across models and remains understudied. In this paper, we propose two metrics to measure local routing consistency of MoE models: (1) **Segment Routing Best Performance (SRP)**, which evaluates how well a fixed group of experts can cover the needs of a segment of tokens, and (2) **Segment Cache Best Hit Rate (SCH)**, which measures the hit rate of an expert cache utilizing a length of future information under a cache limit. We analyze 20 MoE LLMs with diverse sizes and architectures and use toy models to verify key factors related to local routing consistency. We find a strong trade-off between local routing consistency and *local* load balance, while showing that *global* load balance can coexist with local routing consistency. Meanwhile, settings like shared experts that decrease expert combination space can lead to low local routing consistency. We further reveal that domain-specialized experts contribute more to routing consistency than vocabulary-specialized ones, and that most models balance between cache effectiveness and efficiency with cache sizes approximately twice the active experts. These findings pave the way for memory-efficient MoE design and deployment without compromising inference speed. We publish the code for replicating experiments at https://github.com/ljcleo/moe-lrc .

### Matrix-free algorithms for fast ab initio calculations on distributed CPU architectures using finite-element discretization
**Authors**: Gourab Panigrahi, Phani Motamarri

**Updated**: 2025-12-10T13:19:21Z

**Summary**: Finite-element (FE) discretisations have emerged as a powerful real-space alternative to large-scale Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT) calculations, offering systematic convergence, excellent parallel scalability, while accommodating generic boundary conditions. However, the dominant computational bottleneck in FE-based DFT arises from the repeated application of the discretised sparse Hamiltonian to large blocks of trial vectors during iterations in an iterative eigensolver. Traditional sparse matrix-vector multiplications and FE cell-matrix approaches encounter memory limitations and high data-movement overheads, particularly at higher polynomial orders, typically used in DFT calculations. To overcome these challenges, this work develops matrix-free algorithms for FE-discretised DFT that substantially accelerate these products by doing on-the-fly operations that utilize structured tensor contractions over 1D basis functions and quadrature data. A unified multilevel batched data layout that handles both real and complex-valued operators is introduced to maximise cache reuse and SIMD utilisation on Frontier (AVX2), Param Pravega (AVX512) and Fugaku (SVE). We also combine terms for optimal cache reuse, even-odd decomposition to reduce FLOP, and mixed-precision intrinsics. Extensive benchmarks show that for large multivector pseudopotential DFT calculations, the matrix-free kernels deliver 1.5-4x speedups over the state-of-the-art cell-matrix approach baselines. For all-electron DFT calculations, the matrix-free operator achieves gains of up to 5.8x due to its efficient implementation and superior arithmetic intensity. When integrated with an error-tolerant Chebyshev-filtered subspace iteration eigensolver, the matrix-free formalism yields substantial reductions in end-to-end time-to-solution using FE meshes that deliver desired accuracies in ground-state properties.

### Supporting Dynamic Agentic Workloads: How Data and Agents Interact
**Authors**: Ioana Giurgiu, Michael E. Nidd

**Updated**: 2025-12-10T11:38:59Z

**Summary**: The rise of multi-agent systems powered by large language models (LLMs) and specialized reasoning agents exposes fundamental limitations in today's data management architectures. Traditional databases and data fabrics were designed for static, well-defined workloads, whereas agentic systems exhibit dynamic, context-driven, and collaborative behaviors. Agents continuously decompose tasks, shift attention across modalities, and share intermediate results with peers - producing non-deterministic, multi-modal workloads that strain conventional query optimizers and caching mechanisms. We propose an Agent-Centric Data Fabric, a unified architecture that rethinks how data systems serve, optimize, coordinate, and learn from agentic workloads. To achieve this we exploit the concepts of attention-guided data retrieval, semantic micro-caching for context-driven agent federations, predictive data prefetching and quorum-based data serving. Together, these mechanisms enable agents to access representative data faster and more efficiently, while reducing redundant queries, data movement, and inference load across systems. By framing data systems as adaptive collaborators, instead of static executors, we outline new research directions toward behaviorally responsive data infrastructures, where caching, probing, and orchestration jointly enable efficient, context-rich data exchange among dynamic, reasoning-driven agents.

### JFR: An Efficient Jump Frontier Relaxation Strategy for Bellman-Ford
**Authors**: Xin Wang, Xi Chen

**Updated**: 2025-12-10T08:35:45Z

**Summary**: We propose JFR, a Bellman-Ford-based optimization framework leveraging frontier contraction and abstract multi-hop jump propagation to accelerate shortest-path computation while strictly preserving correctness. JFR achieves substantial reductions in relaxation operations, ranging from 25 to 99 percent, across sparse, dense, and negative-edge graphs, ensuring robust performance even under adversarial or highly connected topologies. On ultra-large graphs with up to N=20,000 nodes and 295 million edges, JFR maintains strong operational reductions and comparable or improved runtime relative to SPFA-SLF, demonstrating consistent robustness across graph size and density. Lower relaxation counts imply reduced memory-access overheads and computational effort; this normalized work reduction highlights JFR's suitability for scenarios requiring high throughput or energy-conscious operation. Future work focuses on integrating high-performance queue structures, adaptive frontier strategies, and cache-aware techniques to further reduce constant-factor overheads and fully realize JFR's practical runtime potential.

### Federated Distillation Assisted Vehicle Edge Caching Scheme Based on Lightweight DDPM
**Authors**: Xun Li, Qiong Wu, Pingyi Fan, Kezhi Wang, Wen Chen, Khaled B. Letaief

**Updated**: 2025-12-10T07:19:32Z

**Summary**: Vehicle edge caching is a promising technology that can significantly reduce the latency for vehicle users (VUs) to access content by pre-caching user-interested content at edge nodes. It is crucial to accurately predict the content that VUs are interested in without exposing their privacy. Traditional federated learning (FL) can protect user privacy by sharing models rather than raw data. However, the training of FL requires frequent model transmission, which can result in significant communication overhead. Additionally, vehicles may leave the road side unit (RSU) coverage area before training is completed, leading to training failures. To address these issues, in this letter, we propose a federated distillation-assisted vehicle edge caching scheme based on lightweight denoising diffusion probabilistic model (LDPM). The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed vehicle edge caching scheme has good robustness to variations in vehicle speed, significantly reducing communication overhead and improving cache hit percentage.

### TDC-Cache: A Trustworthy Decentralized Cooperative Caching Framework for Web3.0
**Authors**: Jinyu Chen, Long Shi, Taotao Wang, Jiaheng Wang, Wei Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-12-10T02:52:41Z

**Summary**: The rapid growth of Web3.0 is transforming the Internet from a centralized structure to decentralized, which empowers users with unprecedented self-sovereignty over their own data. However, in the context of decentralized data access within Web3.0, it is imperative to cope with efficiency concerns caused by the replication of redundant data, as well as security vulnerabilities caused by data inconsistency. To address these challenges, we develop a Trustworthy Decentralized Cooperative Caching (TDC-Cache) framework for Web3.0 to ensure efficient caching and enhance system resilience against adversarial threats. This framework features a two-layer architecture, wherein the Decentralized Oracle Network (DON) layer serves as a trusted intermediary platform for decentralized caching, bridging the contents from decentralized storage and the content requests from users. In light of the complexity of Web3.0 network topologies and data flows, we propose a Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Decentralized Caching (DRL-DC) for TDC-Cache to dynamically optimize caching strategies of distributed oracles. Furthermore, we develop a Proof of Cooperative Learning (PoCL) consensus to maintain the consistency of decentralized caching decisions within DON. Experimental results show that, compared with existing approaches, the proposed framework reduces average access latency by 20%, increases the cache hit rate by at most 18%, and improves the average success consensus rate by 10%. Overall, this paper serves as a first foray into the investigation of decentralized caching framework and strategy for Web3.0.

### Training-free Context-adaptive Attention for Efficient Long Context Modeling
**Authors**: Zeng You, Yaofo Chen, Shuhai Zhang, Zhijie Qiu, Tingyu Wu, Yingjian Li, Yaowei Wang, Mingkui Tan

**Updated**: 2025-12-10T01:54:57Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide range of natural language processing tasks. These capabilities stem primarily from the self-attention mechanism, which enables modeling of long-range dependencies. However, the quadratic complexity of self-attention with respect to sequence length poses significant computational and memory challenges, especially as sequence length extends to extremes. While various sparse attention and KV cache compression methods have been proposed to improve efficiency, they often suffer from limitations such as reliance on fixed patterns, inability to handle both prefilling and decoding stages, or the requirement for additional training. In this paper, we propose Training-free Context-adaptive Attention (TCA-Attention), a training-free sparse attention mechanism that selectively attends to only the informative tokens for efficient long-context inference. Our method consists of two lightweight phases: i) an offline calibration phase that determines head-specific sparsity budgets via a single forward pass, and ii) an online token selection phase that adaptively retains core context tokens using a lightweight redundancy metric. TCA-Attention provides a unified solution that accelerates both prefilling and decoding while reducing KV cache memory footprint, without requiring parameter updates or architectural changes. Theoretical analysis shows that our approach maintains bounded approximation error. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TCA-Attention achieves a 2.8$\times$ speedup and reduces KV cache by 61% at 128K context length while maintaining performance comparable to full attention across various benchmarks, offering a practical plug-and-play solution for efficient long-context inference.

**Updated**: 2025-12-10T00:29:21Z

**Summary**: The proliferation of 100B+ parameter Large Language Models (LLMs) with 100k+ context length support have resulted in increasing demands for on-chip memory to support large KV caches. Techniques such as StreamingLLM and SnapKV demonstrate how to control KV cache size while maintaining model accuracy. Yet, these techniques are not commonly used within industrial deployments using frameworks like vLLM or SGLang. The reason is twofold: on one hand, the static graphs and continuous batching methodology employed by these frameworks make it difficult to admit modifications to the standard multi-head attention algorithm, while on the other hand, the accuracy implications of such techniques on modern instruction-following and reasoning models are not well understood, obfuscating the need for implementing these techniques. In this paper, we explore these accuracy implications on Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and DeepSeek-R1, and develop SnapStream, a KV cache compression method that can be deployed at scale. We demonstrate the efficacy of SnapStream in a 16-way tensor-parallel deployment of DeepSeek-671B on SambaNova SN40L accelerators running at 128k context length and up to 1832 tokens per second in a real production setting. SnapStream enables $4\times$ improved on-chip memory usage and introduces minimal accuracy degradation on LongBench-v2, AIME24 and LiveCodeBench. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first implementation of sparse KV attention techniques deployed in a production inference system with static graphs and continuous batching.

### StreamingThinker: Large Language Models Can Think While Reading
**Authors**: Junlong Tong, Yingqi Fan, Anhao Zhao, Yunpu Ma, Xiaoyu Shen

**Updated**: 2025-12-09T17:34:02Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in chain of thought (CoT) reasoning. However, the current LLM reasoning paradigm initiates thinking only after the entire input is available, which introduces unnecessary latency and weakens attention to earlier information in dynamic scenarios. Inspired by human cognition of thinking while reading, we first design a \textit{\textbf{streaming thinking}} paradigm for LLMs, where reasoning unfolds in the order of input and further adjusts its depth once reading is complete. We instantiate this paradigm with \textit{StreamingThinker}, a framework that enables LLMs to think while reading through the integration of streaming CoT generation, streaming-constraint training, and streaming parallel inference. Specifically, StreamingThinker employs streaming reasoning units with quality control for CoT generation, enforces order-preserving reasoning through streaming attention masks and position encoding, and leverages parallel KV caches that decouple input encoding from reasoning generation, thereby ensuring alignment and enabling true concurrency. We evaluate StreamingThinker on the Qwen3 model family across math reasoning, logical reasoning, and context-based QA reasoning tasks. Experimental results show that the StreamingThinker preserves performance comparable to batch thinking, while yielding an 80\% reduction in token waiting before the onset of reasoning and a more than 60\% reduction in time-level latency for producing the final answer, demonstrating the effectiveness of the streaming paradigm for LLM reasoning. Code will be released at https://github.com/EIT-NLP/StreamingLLM/tree/main/StreamingThinker.

### InfiniteVL: Synergizing Linear and Sparse Attention for Highly-Efficient, Unlimited-Input Vision-Language Models
**Authors**: Hongyuan Tao, Bencheng Liao, Shaoyu Chen, Haoran Yin, Qian Zhang, Wenyu Liu, Xinggang Wang

**Updated**: 2025-12-09T17:18:32Z

**Summary**: Window attention and linear attention represent two principal strategies for mitigating the quadratic complexity and ever-growing KV cache in Vision-Language Models (VLMs). However, we observe that window-based VLMs suffer performance degradation when sequence length exceeds the window size, while linear attention underperforms on information-intensive tasks such as OCR and document understanding. To overcome these limitations, we propose InfiniteVL, a linear-complexity VLM architecture that synergizes sliding window attention (SWA) with Gated DeltaNet. For achieving competitive multimodal performance under constrained resources, we design a three-stage training strategy comprising distillation pretraining, instruction tuning, and long-sequence SFT. Remarkably, using less than 2\% of the training data required by leading VLMs, InfiniteVL not only substantially outperforms previous linear-complexity VLMs but also matches the performance of leading Transformer-based VLMs, while demonstrating effective long-term memory retention. Compared to similar-sized Transformer-based VLMs accelerated by FlashAttention-2, InfiniteVL achieves over 3.6\times inference speedup while maintaining constant latency and memory footprint. In streaming video understanding scenarios, it sustains a stable 24 FPS real-time prefill speed while preserving long-term memory cache. Code and models are available at https://github.com/hustvl/InfiniteVL.

### StarDist: A Code Generator for Distributed Graph Algorithms
**Authors**: Barenya Kumar Nandy, Rupesh Nasre

**Updated**: 2025-12-09T15:15:19Z

**Summary**: Relational data, occurring in the real world, are often structured as graphs, which provide the logical abstraction required to make analytical derivations simpler. As graphs get larger, the irregular access patterns exhibited in most graph algorithms, hamper performance. This, along with NUMA and physical memory limits, results in scaling complexities with sequential/shared memory frameworks. StarPlat's MPI backend abstracts away the programmatic complexity involved in designing optimal distributed graph algorithms. It provides an instrument for coding graph algorithms that scale over distributed memory. In this work, we provide an analysis-transformation framework that leverages general semantics associated with iterations involving nodes and their neighbors, within StarPlat, to aggregate communication. The framework scans for patterns that warrant re-ordering in neighborhood access patterns, aggregate communication, and avoid communication altogether with opportunistic caching in reduction constructs. We also architect an optimized bulk-reduction substrate using Open MPI's passive Remote Memory Access (RMA) constructs. We applied our optimization logic to StarPlat's distributed backend and outperformed d-Galois by 2.05 and DRONE by 1.44 times in Single Source Shortest Paths across several big data graphs.

### Inferring Causal Relationships to Improve Caching for Clients with Correlated Requests: Applications to VR
**Authors**: Agrim Bari, Gustavo de Veciana, Yuqi Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-12-09T14:10:41Z

**Summary**: Efficient edge caching reduces latency and alleviates backhaul congestion in modern networks. Traditional caching policies, such as Least Recently Used (LRU) and Least Frequently Used (LFU), perform well under specific request patterns. LRU excels in workloads with strong temporal locality, while LFU is effective when content popularity remains static. However, real-world client requests often exhibit correlations due to shared contexts and coordinated activities. This is particularly evident in Virtual Reality (VR) environments, where groups of clients navigate shared virtual spaces, leading to correlated content requests.   In this paper, we introduce the \textit{grouped client request model}, a generalization of the Independent Reference Model that explicitly captures different types of request correlations. Our theoretical analysis of LRU under this model reveals that the optimal causal caching policy depends on cache size: LFU is optimal for small to moderate caches, while LRU outperforms it for larger caches. To address the limitations of existing policies, we propose Least Following and Recently Used (LFRU), a novel online caching policy that dynamically infers and adapts to causal relationships in client requests to optimize evictions. LFRU prioritizes objects likely to be requested based on inferred dependencies, achieving near-optimal performance compared to the offline optimal Belady policy in structured correlation settings.   We develop VR based datasets to evaluate caching policies under realistic correlated requests. Our results show that LFRU consistently performs at least as well as LRU and LFU, outperforming LRU by up to 2.9x and LFU by up to1.9x in certain settings.

### SkipKV: Selective Skipping of KV Generation and Storage for Efficient Inference with Large Reasoning Models
**Authors**: Jiayi Tian, Seyedarmin Azizi, Yequan Zhao, Erfan Baghaei Potraghloo, Sean McPherson, Sharath Nittur Sridhar, Zhengyang Wang, Zheng Zhang, Massoud Pedram, Souvik Kundu

**Updated**: 2025-12-08T19:32:06Z

**Summary**: Large reasoning models (LRMs) often cost significant key-value (KV) cache overhead, due to their linear growth with the verbose chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning process. This costs both memory and throughput bottleneck limiting their efficient deployment. Towards reducing KV cache size during inference, we first investigate the effectiveness of existing KV cache eviction methods for CoT reasoning. Interestingly, we find that due to unstable token-wise scoring and the reduced effective KV budget caused by padding tokens, state-of-the-art (SoTA) eviction methods fail to maintain accuracy in the multi-batch setting. Additionally, these methods often generate longer sequences than the original model, as semantic-unaware token-wise eviction leads to repeated revalidation during reasoning. To address these issues, we present \textbf{SkipKV}, a \textbf{\textit{training-free}} KV compression method for selective \textit{eviction} and \textit{generation} operating at a coarse-grained sentence-level sequence removal for efficient CoT reasoning. In specific, it introduces a \textit{sentence-scoring metric} to identify and remove highly similar sentences while maintaining semantic coherence. To suppress redundant generation, SkipKV dynamically adjusts a steering vector to update the hidden activation states during inference enforcing the LRM to generate concise response. Extensive evaluations on multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of SkipKV in maintaining up to $\mathbf{26.7}\%$ improved accuracy compared to the alternatives, at a similar compression budget. Additionally, compared to SoTA, SkipKV yields up to $\mathbf{1.6}\times$ fewer generation length while improving throughput up to $\mathbf{1.7}\times$.

### Compactor: Calibrated Query-Agnostic KV Cache Compression with Approximate Leverage Scores
**Authors**: Vivek Chari, Benjamin Van Durme

**Updated**: 2025-12-08T19:02:12Z

**Summary**: Modern Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly trained to support very large context windows. We present Compactor, a training-free, query-agnostic KV compression strategy that uses approximate leverage scores to determine token importance. We show that Compactor can achieve the same performance as competing methods while retaining 20% fewer tokens in both synthetic and real-world context tasks, while being more task-robust. We further introduce a procedure for context-calibrated compression: inferring the maximum compression a given context supports before significant performance loss. Using context-calibrated compression, we show that Compactor achieves full KV performance on Longbench while reducing the KV memory burden by 68%, on average. To demonstrate the efficacy and generalizability of our approach, we apply Compactor to 27 synthetic and real-world tasks from RULER and Longbench, with models from both the Qwen 2.5 and Llama 3.1 families. Finally, we release compactor-vllm, an inference engine and suite of optimized Triton kernels designed to efficiently support the sparse, non-contiguous memory access patterns inherent to compressed KV caches. This work demonstrates that Compactor offers a practical, high-performance solution for alleviating the memory bottleneck in modern LLM deployment.

### H2EAL: Hybrid-Bonding Architecture with Hybrid Sparse Attention for Efficient Long-Context LLM Inference
**Authors**: Zizhuo Fu, Xiaotian Guo, Wenxuan Zeng, Shuzhang Zhong, Yadong Zhang, Peiyu Chen, Runsheng Wang, Le Ye, Meng Li

**Updated**: 2025-12-08T13:48:55Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in a wide range of natural language processing applications. However, the high energy and latency overhead induced by the KV cache limits the edge deployment, especially for long contexts. Emerging hybrid bonding (HB) technology has been proposed as a promising alternative to conventional near-memory processing (NMP) architectures, offering improved bandwidth efficiency and lower power consumption while exhibiting characteristics of distributed memory. In this paper, we propose H2EAL, a hybrid bonding-based accelerator with sparse attention algorithm-hardware co-design for efficient LLM inference at the edge. At the algorithm level, we propose a hybrid sparse attention scheme with static and dynamic sparsity for different heads to fully leverage the sparsity with high accuracy. At the hardware level, we co-design the hardware to support hybrid sparse attention and propose memory-compute co-placement to address the distributed memory bottleneck. Since different attention heads exhibit different sparse patterns and the attention structure often mismatches the HB architecture, we further develop a load-balancing scheduler with parallel tiled attention to address workload imbalance and optimize the mapping strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate H2EAL achieves 5.20~48.21x speedup and 6.22~73.48x energy efficiency improvement over baseline HB implementation, with a negligible average accuracy drop of 0.87% on multiple benchmarks.

### DCO: Dynamic Cache Orchestration for LLM Accelerators through Predictive Management
**Authors**: Zhongchun Zhou, Chengtao Lai, Yuhang Gu, Wei Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-12-08T08:56:10Z

**Summary**: The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) is pushing AI accelerators toward increasingly powerful and specialized designs. Instead of further complicating software development with deeply hierarchical scratchpad memories (SPMs) and their asynchronous management, we investigate the opposite point of the design spectrum: a multi-core AI accelerator equipped with a shared system-level cache and application-aware management policies, which keeps the programming effort modest. Our approach exploits dataflow information available in the software stack to guide cache replacement (including dead-block prediction), in concert with bypass decisions and mechanisms that alleviate cache thrashing.   We assess the proposal using a cycle-accurate simulator and observe substantial performance gains (up to 1.80x speedup) compared with conventional cache architectures. In addition, we build and validate an analytical model that takes into account the actual overlapping behaviors to extend the measurement results of our policies to real-world larger-scale workloads. Experiment results show that when functioning together, our bypassing and thrashing mitigation strategies can handle scenarios both with and without inter-core data sharing and achieve remarkable speedups.   Finally, we implement the design in RTL and the area of our design is $\mathbf{0.064mm^2}$ with 15nm process, which can run at 2 GHz clock frequency. Our findings explore the potential of the shared cache design to assist the development of future AI accelerator systems.

### Improving the Throughput of Diffusion-based Large Language Models via a Training-Free Confidence-Aware Calibration
**Authors**: Jucheng Shen, Gaurav Sarkar, Yeonju Ro, Sharath Nittur Sridhar, Zhangyang Wang, Aditya Akella, Souvik Kundu

**Updated**: 2025-12-08T05:15:41Z

**Summary**: We present CadLLM, a training-free method to accelerate the inference throughput of diffusion-based LLMs (dLLMs). We first investigate the dynamic nature of token unmasking confidence across blocks and steps. Based on this observation, we present a lightweight adaptive approach that controls the generation block size, step size, and threshold based on the average confidence of unmasked tokens. We further reduce softmax overhead by dynamically leveraging a subset of the vocabulary to regulate sampling breadth. CadLLM is a plug-and-play, model-agnostic method compatible with KV-cache-based dLLMs. Extensive experiments on four popular tasks demonstrate that CadLLM yields up to 2.28x throughput improvement over the state-of-the-art baseline with competitive accuracy.

### Shadow in the Cache: Unveiling and Mitigating Privacy Risks of KV-cache in LLM Inference
**Authors**: Zhifan Luo, Shuo Shao, Su Zhang, Lijing Zhou, Yuke Hu, Chenxu Zhao, Zhihao Liu, Zhan Qin

**Updated**: 2025-12-08T02:23:36Z

**Summary**: The Key-Value (KV) cache, which stores intermediate attention computations (Key and Value pairs) to avoid redundant calculations, is a fundamental mechanism for accelerating Large Language Model (LLM) inference. However, this efficiency optimization introduces significant yet underexplored privacy risks. This paper provides the first comprehensive analysis of these vulnerabilities, demonstrating that an attacker can reconstruct sensitive user inputs directly from the KV-cache. We design and implement three distinct attack vectors: a direct Inversion Attack, a more broadly applicable and potent Collision Attack, and a semantic-based Injection Attack. These methods demonstrate the practicality and severity of KV-cache privacy leakage issues. To mitigate this, we propose KV-Cloak, a novel, lightweight, and efficient defense mechanism. KV-Cloak uses a reversible matrix-based obfuscation scheme, combined with operator fusion, to secure the KV-cache. Our extensive experiments show that KV-Cloak effectively thwarts all proposed attacks, reducing reconstruction quality to random noise. Crucially, it achieves this robust security with virtually no degradation in model accuracy and minimal performance overhead, offering a practical solution for trustworthy LLM deployment.

### Leveraging KV Similarity for Online Structured Pruning in LLMs
**Authors**: Jungmin Lee, Gwangeun Byeon, Yulhwa Kim, Seokin Hong

**Updated**: 2025-12-08T01:56:27Z

**Summary**: Pruning has emerged as a promising direction for accelerating large language model (LLM) inference, yet existing approaches often suffer from instability because they rely on offline calibration data that may not generalize across inputs. In this work, we introduce Token Filtering, a lightweight online structured pruning technique that makes pruning decisions directly during inference without any calibration data. The key idea is to measure token redundancy via joint key-value similarity and skip redundant attention computations, thereby reducing inference cost while preserving critical information. To further enhance stability, we design a variance-aware fusion strategy that adaptively weights key and value similarity across heads, ensuring that informative tokens are retained even under high pruning ratios. This design introduces no additional memory overhead and provides a more reliable criterion for token importance. Extensive experiments on LLaMA-2 (7B/13B), LLaMA-3 (8B), and Mistral (7B) demonstrate that Token Filtering consistently outperforms prior structured pruning methods, preserving accuracy on commonsense reasoning benchmarks and maintaining strong performance on challenging tasks such as MMLU, even with 50% pruning.

### AutoNeural: Co-Designing Vision-Language Models for NPU Inference
**Authors**: Wei Chen, Liangmin Wu, Yunhai Hu, Zhiyuan Li, Zhiyuan Cheng, Yicheng Qian, Lingyue Zhu, Zhipeng Hu, Luoyi Liang, Qiang Tang, Zhen Liu, Han Yang

**Updated**: 2025-12-08T00:15:33Z

**Summary**: While Neural Processing Units (NPUs) offer high theoretical efficiency for edge AI, state-of-the-art Vision--Language Models (VLMs) tailored for GPUs often falter on these substrates. We attribute this hardware-model mismatch to two primary factors: the quantization brittleness of Vision Transformers (ViTs) and the I/O-bound nature of autoregressive attention mechanisms, which fail to utilize the high arithmetic throughput of NPUs. To bridge this gap, we propose AutoNeural, an NPU-native VLM architecture co-designed for integer-only inference. We replace the standard ViT encoder with a MobileNetV5-style backbone utilizing depthwise separable convolutions, which ensures bounded activation distributions for stable INT4/8/16 quantization. Complementing this, our language backbone integrates State-Space Model (SSM) principles with Transformer layers, employing efficient gated convolutions to achieve linear-time complexity. This hybrid design eliminates the heavy memory I/O overhead of Key-Value caching during generation. Our approach delivers substantial efficiency gains, reducing quantization error of vision encoder by up to 7x and end-to-end latency by 14x compared to conventional baselines. The AutoNeural also delivers 3x decoding speed and 4x longer context window than the baseline. We validate these improvements via a real-world automotive case study on the Qualcomm SA8295P SoC, demonstrating real-time performance for cockpit applications. Our results highlight that rethinking model topology specifically for NPU constraints is a prerequisite for robust multi-modal edge intelligence.

### MotionStream: Real-Time Video Generation with Interactive Motion Controls
**Authors**: Joonghyuk Shin, Zhengqi Li, Richard Zhang, Jun-Yan Zhu, Jaesik Park, Eli Shechtman, Xun Huang

**Updated**: 2025-12-08T00:05:23Z

**Summary**: Current motion-conditioned video generation methods suffer from prohibitive latency (minutes per video) and non-causal processing that prevents real-time interaction. We present MotionStream, enabling sub-second latency with up to 29 FPS streaming generation on a single GPU. Our approach begins by augmenting a text-to-video model with motion control, which generates high-quality videos that adhere to the global text prompt and local motion guidance, but does not perform inference on the fly. As such, we distill this bidirectional teacher into a causal student through Self Forcing with Distribution Matching Distillation, enabling real-time streaming inference. Several key challenges arise when generating videos of long, potentially infinite time-horizons -- (1) bridging the domain gap from training on finite length and extrapolating to infinite horizons, (2) sustaining high quality by preventing error accumulation, and (3) maintaining fast inference, without incurring growth in computational cost due to increasing context windows. A key to our approach is introducing carefully designed sliding-window causal attention, combined with attention sinks. By incorporating self-rollout with attention sinks and KV cache rolling during training, we properly simulate inference-time extrapolations with a fixed context window, enabling constant-speed generation of arbitrarily long videos. Our models achieve state-of-the-art results in motion following and video quality while being two orders of magnitude faster, uniquely enabling infinite-length streaming. With MotionStream, users can paint trajectories, control cameras, or transfer motion, and see results unfold in real-time, delivering a truly interactive experience.

### ELANA: A Simple Energy and Latency Analyzer for LLMs
**Authors**: Hung-Yueh Chiang, Bokun Wang, Diana Marculescu

**Updated**: 2025-12-07T18:43:47Z

**Summary**: The latency and power consumption of large language models (LLMs) are major constraints when serving them across a wide spectrum of hardware platforms, from mobile edge devices to cloud GPU clusters. Benchmarking is crucial for optimizing efficiency in both model deployment and next-generation model development. To address this need, we open-source a simple profiling tool, \textbf{ELANA}, for evaluating LLMs. ELANA is designed as a lightweight, academic-friendly profiler for analyzing model size, key-value (KV) cache size, prefilling latency (Time-to-first-token, TTFT), generation latency (Time-per-output-token, TPOT), and end-to-end latency (Time-to-last-token, TTLT) of LLMs on both multi-GPU and edge GPU platforms. It supports all publicly available models on Hugging Face and offers a simple command-line interface, along with optional energy consumption logging. Moreover, ELANA is fully compatible with popular Hugging Face APIs and can be easily customized or adapted to compressed or low bit-width models, making it ideal for research on efficient LLMs or for small-scale proof-of-concept studies. We release the ELANA profiling tool at: https://github.com/enyac-group/Elana.

### Spatial Retrieval Augmented Autonomous Driving
**Authors**: Xiaosong Jia, Chenhe Zhang, Yule Jiang, Songbur Wong, Zhiyuan Zhang, Chen Chen, Shaofeng Zhang, Xuanhe Zhou, Xue Yang, Junchi Yan, Yu-Gang Jiang

**Updated**: 2025-12-07T14:40:49Z

**Summary**: Existing autonomous driving systems rely on onboard sensors (cameras, LiDAR, IMU, etc) for environmental perception. However, this paradigm is limited by the drive-time perception horizon and often fails under limited view scope, occlusion or extreme conditions such as darkness and rain. In contrast, human drivers are able to recall road structure even under poor visibility. To endow models with this ``recall" ability, we propose the spatial retrieval paradigm, introducing offline retrieved geographic images as an additional input. These images are easy to obtain from offline caches (e.g, Google Maps or stored autonomous driving datasets) without requiring additional sensors, making it a plug-and-play extension for existing AD tasks.   For experiments, we first extend the nuScenes dataset with geographic images retrieved via Google Maps APIs and align the new data with ego-vehicle trajectories. We establish baselines across five core autonomous driving tasks: object detection, online mapping, occupancy prediction, end-to-end planning, and generative world modeling. Extensive experiments show that the extended modality could enhance the performance of certain tasks. We will open-source dataset curation code, data, and benchmarks for further study of this new autonomous driving paradigm.

### EVCtrl: Efficient Control Adapter for Visual Generation
**Authors**: Zixiang Yang, Yue Ma, Yinhan Zhang, Shanhui Mo, Dongrui Liu, Linfeng Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-12-07T14:21:14Z

**Summary**: Visual generation includes both image and video generation, training probabilistic models to create coherent, diverse, and semantically faithful content from scratch. While early research focused on unconditional sampling, practitioners now demand controllable generation that allows precise specification of layout, pose, motion, or style. While ControlNet grants precise spatial-temporal control, its auxiliary branch markedly increases latency and introduces redundant computation in both uncontrolled regions and denoising steps, especially for video. To address this problem, we introduce EVCtrl, a lightweight, plug-and-play control adapter that slashes overhead without retraining the model. Specifically, we propose a spatio-temporal dual caching strategy for sparse control information. For spatial redundancy, we first profile how each layer of DiT-ControlNet responds to fine-grained control, then partition the network into global and local functional zones. A locality-aware cache focuses computation on the local zones that truly need the control signal, skipping the bulk of redundant computation in global regions. For temporal redundancy, we selectively omit unnecessary denoising steps to improve efficiency. Extensive experiments on CogVideo-Controlnet, Wan2.1-Controlnet, and Flux demonstrate that our method is effective in image and video control generation without the need for training. For example, it achieves 2.16 and 2.05 times speedups on CogVideo-Controlnet and Wan2.1-Controlnet, respectively, with almost no degradation in generation quality.Codes are available in the supplementary materials.

### Head-Aware KV Cache Compression for Efficient Visual Autoregressive Modeling
**Authors**: Ziran Qin, Youru Lv, Mingbao Lin, Hang Guo, Zeren Zhang, Danping Zou, Weiyao Lin

**Updated**: 2025-12-07T12:44:02Z

**Summary**: Visual Autoregressive (VAR) models adopt a next-scale prediction paradigm, offering high-quality content generation with substantially fewer decoding steps. However, existing VAR models suffer from significant attention complexity and severe memory overhead due to the accumulation of key-value (KV) caches across scales. In this paper, we tackle this challenge by introducing KV cache compression into the next-scale generation paradigm. We begin with a crucial observation: attention heads in VAR models can be divided into two functionally distinct categories: Contextual Heads focus on maintaining semantic consistency, while Structural Heads are responsible for preserving spatial coherence. This structural divergence causes existing one-size-fits-all compression methods to perform poorly on VAR models. To address this, we propose HACK, a training-free Head-Aware KV cache Compression frameworK. HACK utilizes an offline classification scheme to separate head types, enabling it to apply pattern-specific compression strategies with asymmetric cache budgets for each category. By doing so, HACK effectively constrains the average KV cache length within a fixed budget $B$, reducing the theoretical attention complexity from $\mathcal{O}(n^4)$ to $\mathcal{O}(Bn^2)$. Extensive experiments on multiple VAR models across text-to-image and class-conditional tasks validate the effectiveness and generalizability of HACK. It achieves up to 70% KV cache compression without degrading output quality, resulting in memory savings and faster inference. For example, HACK provides a $1.75\times$ memory reduction and a $1.57\times$ speedup on Infinity-8B.

### KV-CAR: KV Cache Compression using Autoencoders and KV Reuse in Large Language Models
**Authors**: Sourjya Roy, Shrihari Sridharan, Surya Selvam, Anand Raghunathan

**Updated**: 2025-12-07T08:40:52Z

**Summary**: As Large Language Models (LLMs) scale in size and context length, the memory requirements of the key value (KV) cache have emerged as a major bottleneck during autoregressive decoding. The KV cache grows with sequence length and embedding dimension, often exceeding the memory footprint of the model itself and limiting achievable batch sizes and context windows. To address this challenge, we present KV CAR, a unified and architecture agnostic framework that significantly reduces KV cache storage while maintaining model fidelity. KV CAR combines two complementary techniques. First, a lightweight autoencoder learns compact representations of key and value tensors along the embedding dimension, compressing them before they are stored in the KV cache and restoring them upon retrieval. Second, a similarity driven reuse mechanism identifies opportunities to reuse KV tensors of specific attention heads across adjacent layers. Together, these methods reduce the dimensional and structural redundancy in KV tensors without requiring changes to the transformer architecture. Evaluations on GPT 2 and TinyLLaMA models across Wikitext, C4, PIQA, and Winogrande datasets demonstrate that KV CAR achieves up to 47.85 percent KV cache memory reduction with minimal impact on perplexity and zero shot accuracy. System level measurements on an NVIDIA A40 GPU show that the reduced KV footprint directly translates into longer sequence lengths and larger batch sizes during inference. These results highlight the effectiveness of KV CAR in enabling memory efficient LLM inference.

### Statistic-Augmented, Decoupled MoE Routing and Aggregating in Autonomous Driving
**Authors**: Wei-Bin Kou, Guangxu Zhu, Jingreng Lei, Chen Zhang, Yik-Chung Wu, Jianping Wang

**Updated**: 2025-12-07T05:28:40Z

**Summary**: Autonomous driving (AD) scenarios are inherently complex and diverse, posing significant challenges for a single deep learning model to effectively cover all possible conditions, such as varying weather, traffic densities, and road types. Large Model (LM)-Driven Mixture of Experts (MoE) paradigm offers a promising solution, where LM serves as the backbone to extract latent features while MoE serves as the downstream head to dynamically select and aggregate specialized experts to adapt to different scenarios. However, routing and aggregating in MoE face intrinsic challenges, including imprecise expert selection due to flawed routing strategy and inefficient expert aggregation leading to suboptimal prediction. To address these issues, we propose a statistic-augmented, decoupled MoE }outing and Aggregating Mechanism (MoE-RAM) driven by LM. Specifically, on the one hand, MoE-RAM enhances expert routing by incorporating statistical retrieval mechanism to match LM-extracted latent features with cached prototypical features of the most relevant experts; on the other hand, MoE-RAM adaptively reweights experts' outputs in fusion by measuring statistical distances of experts' instant features against LM-extracted latent features. Benefiting from the synergy of the statistic-augmented MoE's routing and aggregating, MoE-RAM ultimately improves the prediction performance. We take the AD semantic segmentation task as an example to assess the proposed MoE-RAM. Extensive experiments on AD datasets demonstrate the superiority of MoE-RAM compared to other MoE baselines and conventional single-model approaches.

### Solving larger Travelling Salesman Problem networks with a penalty-free Variational Quantum Algorithm
**Authors**: Daniel Goldsmith, Xing Liang, Dimitrios Makris, Hongwei Wu

**Updated**: 2025-12-06T18:21:21Z

**Summary**: The Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a well-known NP-Hard combinatorial optimisation problem, with industrial use cases such as last-mile delivery. Although TSP has been studied extensively on quantum computers, it is rare to find quantum solutions of TSP network with more than a dozen locations. In this paper, we present high quality solutions in noise-free Qiskit simulations of networks with up to twelve locations using a hybrid penalty-free, circuit-model, Variational Quantum Algorithm (VQA). Noisy qubits are also simulated. To our knowledge, this is the first successful VQA simulation of a twelve-location TSP on circuit-model devices. Multiple encoding strategies, including factorial, non-factorial, and Gray encoding are evaluated. Our formulation scales as $\mathcal{O}(nlog_2(n))$ qubits, requiring only 29 qubits for twelve locations, compared with over 100 qubits for conventional approaches scaling as $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$. Computational time is further reduced by almost two orders of magnitude through the use of Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA) gradient estimation and cost-function caching. We also introduce a novel machine-learning model, and benchmark both quantum and classical approaches against a Monte Carlo baseline. The VQA outperforms the classical machine-learning approach, and performs similarly to Monte Carlo for the small networks simulated. Additionally, the results indicate a trend toward improved performance with problem size, outlining a pathway to solving larger TSP instances on quantum devices.

### Convolution operators preserving the set of totally positive sequences
**Authors**: Olga Katkova, Anna Vishnyakova

**Updated**: 2025-12-06T15:13:02Z

**Summary**: A real sequence $(a_k)_{k=0}^\infty$ is called {\it totally positive} if all minors of the infinite Toeplitz matrix $ \left\| a_{j-i} \right\|_{i, j =0}^\infty$ are nonnegative (here $a_k=0$ for $k<0$). In this paper, which continues our earlier work \cite{kv}, we investigate the set of real sequences $(b_k)_{k=0}^\infty$ with the property that for every totally positive sequence $(a_k)_{k=0}^\infty,$ the sequense of termwise products $(a_k b_k)_{k=0}^\infty$ is also totally positive. In particular, we show that for every totally positive sequence $(a_k)_{k=0}^\infty$ the sequence $\left(a_k a^{-k (k-1)}\right)_{k=0}^\infty$ is totally positive whenever $a^2\geq 3{.}503.$ We also propose several open problems concerning convolution operators that preserve total positivity.

### Vec-LUT: Vector Table Lookup for Parallel Ultra-Low-Bit LLM Inference on Edge Devices
**Authors**: Xiangyu Li, Chengyu Yin, Weijun Wang, Jianyu Wei, Ting Cao, Yunxin Liu

**Updated**: 2025-12-06T14:14:01Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed on edge devices. To meet strict resource constraints, real-world deployment has pushed LLM quantization from 8-bit to 4-bit, 2-bit, and now 1.58-bit. Combined with lookup table (LUT)-based inference, CPUs run these ultra-low-bit LLMs even faster than NPUs, opening new opportunities for ubiquitous on-device intelligence.   However, this paper identifies that LUT-based inference underutilizes memory bandwidth during parallel inference, which is required for prefilling, test-time scaling, and other multi-token scenarios. The root cause is the scalar LUT paradigm, which performs repetitive and non-contiguous memory accesses for each token.   To solve the issue, we propose vector LUT, a new lookup paradigm that constructs a unified LUT across parallel tokens, and performs a single $1 \rightarrow N$ lookup per index. To realize it efficiently, we further introduce (1) Vector LUT-Centric Tensor Layout, and (2) Cache-Aware Streamed Lookup techniques. Evaluations on 5 edge devices across 3 LLMs show that Vec-LUT outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by up to $4.2\times$. Our implementation is integrated into llama.cpp. The code is available at https://github.com/Cipherxzc/vlut.cpp.

### EasySpec: Layer-Parallel Speculative Decoding for Efficient Multi-GPU Utilization
**Authors**: Yize Wu, Ke Gao, Ling Li, Yanjun Wu

**Updated**: 2025-12-06T08:55:13Z

**Summary**: Speculative decoding is an effective and lossless method for Large Language Model (LLM) inference acceleration. It employs a smaller model to generate a draft token sequence, which is then verified by the original base model. In multi-GPU systems, inference latency can be further reduced through tensor parallelism (TP), while the optimal TP size of the draft model is typically smaller than that of the base model, leading to GPU idling during the drafting stage. We observe that such inefficiency stems from the sequential execution of layers, which is seemingly natural but actually unnecessary. Therefore, we propose EasySpec, a layer-parallel speculation strategy that optimizes the efficiency of multi-GPU utilization. EasySpec breaks the inter-layer data dependencies in the draft model, enabling multiple layers to run simultaneously across multiple devices as 'fuzzy' speculation. After each drafting-and-verification iteration, the draft model's key-value cache is calibrated in a single forward pass, preventing long-term fuzzy-error accumulation at minimal additional latency. EasySpec is a training-free and plug-in method. We evaluated EasySpec on several mainstream open-source LLMs, using smaller versions of models from the same series as drafters. The results demonstrate that EasySpec can achieve a peak speedup of 4.17x compared to vanilla decoding, while preserving the original distributions of the base LLMs. Specifically, the drafting stage can be accelerated by up to 1.62x with a maximum speculation accuracy drop of only 7%. The code is available at https://github.com/Yize-Wu/EasySpec.

### KQ-SVD: Compressing the KV Cache with Provable Guarantees on Attention Fidelity
**Authors**: Damien Lesens, Beheshteh T. Rakhshan, Guillaume Rabusseau

**Updated**: 2025-12-05T17:51:10Z

**Summary**: The Key-Value (KV) cache is central to the efficiency of transformer-based large language models (LLMs), storing previously computed vectors to accelerate inference. Yet, as sequence length and batch size grow, the cache becomes a major memory bottleneck. Prior compression methods typically apply low-rank decomposition to keys alone or attempt to jointly embed queries and keys, but both approaches neglect that attention fundamentally depends on their inner products. In this work, we prove that such strategies are suboptimal for approximating the attention matrix. We introduce KQ-SVD, a simple and computationally efficient method that directly performs an optimal low-rank decomposition of the attention matrix via a closed-form solution. By targeting the true source of redundancy, KQ-SVD preserves attention outputs with higher fidelity under compression. Extensive evaluations on LLaMA and Mistral models demonstrate that our approach consistently delivers superior projection quality.

### Morphling: Fast, Fused, and Flexible GNN Training at Scale
**Authors**: Anubhab, Rupesh Nasre

**Updated**: 2025-12-05T16:07:38Z

**Summary**: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) present a fundamental hardware challenge by fusing irregular, memory-bound graph traversals with regular, compute-intensive dense matrix operations. While frameworks such as PyTorch Geometric (PyG) and Deep Graph Library (DGL) prioritize high-level usability, they fail to address these divergent execution characteristics. As a result, they rely on generic kernels that suffer from poor cache locality, excessive memory movement, and substantial intermediate allocations. To address these limitations, we present Morphling, a domain-specific code synthesizer designed to bridge this gap. Morphling compiles high-level GNN specifications into portable, backend-specialized implementations targeting OpenMP, CUDA, and MPI. It achieves this by instantiating a library of optimized, architecture-aware primitives tailored to each execution environment. Morphling also incorporates a runtime sparsity-aware execution engine that dynamically selects dense or sparse execution paths using input feature statistics, reducing unnecessary computation on zero-valued entries. We evaluate Morphling on eleven real-world datasets spanning diverse graph structures, feature dimensionalities, and sparsity regimes. Morphling improves per-epoch training throughput by an average of 20X on CPUs, 19X on GPUs, and 6X in distributed settings over PyG and DGL, with peak speedups reaching 66X. Morphling's memory-efficient layouts further reduce peak memory consumption by up to 15X, enabling large-scale GNN training on commodity hardware. These findings demonstrate that specialized, architecture-aware code synthesis provides an effective and scalable path toward high-performance GNN execution across diverse parallel and distributed platforms.

### Live Avatar: Streaming Real-time Audio-Driven Avatar Generation with Infinite Length

**Updated**: 2025-12-05T06:32:30Z

**Summary**: Existing diffusion-based video generation methods are fundamentally constrained by sequential computation and long-horizon inconsistency, limiting their practical adoption in real-time, streaming audio-driven avatar synthesis. We present Live Avatar, an algorithm-system co-designed framework that enables efficient, high-fidelity, and infinite-length avatar generation using a 14-billion-parameter diffusion model. Our approach introduces Timestep-forcing Pipeline Parallelism (TPP), a distributed inference paradigm that pipelines denoising steps across multiple GPUs, effectively breaking the autoregressive bottleneck and ensuring stable, low-latency real-time streaming. To further enhance temporal consistency and mitigate identity drift and color artifacts, we propose the Rolling Sink Frame Mechanism (RSFM), which maintains sequence fidelity by dynamically recalibrating appearance using a cached reference image. Additionally, we leverage Self-Forcing Distribution Matching Distillation to facilitate causal, streamable adaptation of large-scale models without sacrificing visual quality. Live Avatar demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, reaching 20 FPS end-to-end generation on 5 H800 GPUs, and, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to achieve practical, real-time, high-fidelity avatar generation at this scale. Our work establishes a new paradigm for deploying advanced diffusion models in industrial long-form video synthesis applications.

### LMCache: An Efficient KV Cache Layer for Enterprise-Scale LLM Inference
**Authors**: Yuhan Liu, Yihua Cheng, Jiayi Yao, Yuwei An, Xiaokun Chen, Shaoting Feng, Yuyang Huang, Samuel Shen, Rui Zhang, Kuntai Du, Junchen Jiang

**Updated**: 2025-12-05T04:52:54Z

**Summary**: KV cache has traditionally been stored in GPU memory to accelerate the decoding phase of large language model (LLM) inference. However, it is increasingly necessary to move KV caches outside GPU devices, to enable cache reuse across different queries and inference engines. Our real-world usage statistics confirm this trend: over time, the total KV cache stored by users has grown rapidly, far exceeding the capacity of GPU memory. Despite this need, there lacks an efficient solution for offloading and transferring KV caches. We present LMCACHE, the first and so far the most efficient open-source KV caching solution, which extracts and stores KV caches generated by modern LLM engines (vLLM and SGLang) out of the GPU memory and shares them across engines and queries. LMCACHE supports both cache offloading (prefix reuse across queries) and prefill-decode (PD) disaggregation (cross-engine/GPU cache transfer). LMCACHE's high performance and wide adoption stem from the following contributions: (1) highly optimized KV cache data movement powered by batched data movement operations, compute and I/O pipelining; (2) a modular KV cache connector component, decoupling LMCACHE from the rapid evolution of inference engines; (3) a first-class control API for flexible cache orchestration across GPU, CPU, storage, and network layers. Our evaluation shows that combining LMCACHE with vLLM achieves up to 15x improvement in throughput across workloads such as multi-round question answering and document analysis. Large-scale adoption of LMCACHE in enterprise settings provides us valuable insights, for example, fetching KV cache from remote storage has unsurprisingly benefits to prefill delay, and that context truncation, which is a widely applied technique in industry, can greatly reduce prefix cache hit ratio by half. The source code of LMCACHE is at: https://github.com/LMCache/LMCache.

### Clock2Q+: A Simple and Efficient Replacement Algorithm for Metadata Cache in VMware vSAN
**Authors**: Yiyan Zhai, Bintang Dwi Marthen, Sarath Balivada, Vamsi Sudhakar Bojji, Eric Knauft, Jitender Rohilla, Jiaqi Zuo, Quanxing Liu, Maxime Austruy, Wenguang Wang, Juncheng Yang

**Updated**: 2025-12-05T02:13:10Z

**Summary**: Cache replacement algorithms are critical building blocks of storage systems. This paper examines the characteristics of metadata caches and argues that they inherently exhibit correlated references, even when the corresponding data accesses do not contain correlated references. The presence of correlated references reduces the effectiveness of cache replacement algorithms because these references are often mistakenly categorized as hot blocks. Clock2Q+ is specifically designed for metadata caches and has been implemented in vSAN and VDFS, two flagship storage products of VMware by Broadcom. Similar to S3-FIFO, Clock2Q+ uses three queues; however, Clock2Q+ introduces a correlation window in the Small FIFO queue, where blocks in this window do not set the reference bit. This simple enhancement allows Clock2Q+ to outperform state-of-the-art replacement algorithms. Compared to S3-FIFO, the second-best performing algorithm, Clock2Q+ achieves up to a 28.5% lower miss ratio on metadata traces. Clock2Q+ possesses the essential properties required for large-scale storage systems: it has low CPU overhead on cache hits, low memory overhead, scales efficiently to multiple CPUs, and is both easy to tune and implement. Additionally, Clock2Q+ outperforms state-of-the-art cache replacement algorithms on data traces as well.

### Cloud-Native Vector Search: A Comprehensive Performance Analysis
**Authors**: Zhaoheng Li, Wei Ding, Silu Huang, Zikang Wang, Yuanjin Lin, Ke Wu, Yongjoo Park, Jianjun Chen

**Updated**: 2025-12-05T00:04:45Z

**Summary**: Vector search has been widely employed in recommender system and retrieval-augmented-generation pipelines, commonly performed with vector indexes to efficiently find similar items in large datasets. Recent growths in both data and task complexity have motivated placing vector indexes onto remote storage -- cloud-native vector search, which cloud providers have recently introduced services for. Yet, despite varying workload characteristics and various available vector index forms, providers default to using cluster-based indexes, which on paper do adapt well to differences between disk and cloud-based environment: their fetch granularities and lack of notable intra-query dependencies aligns with the large optimal fetch sizes and minimizes costly round-trips (i.e., as opposed to graph-based indexes) to remote storage, respectively.   This paper systematically studies cloud-native vector search: What and how should indexes be built and used for on-cloud vector search? We analyze bottlenecks of two common index classes, cluster and graph indexes, on remote storage, and show that despite current standardized adoption of cluster indexes on the cloud, graph indexes are favored in workloads requiring high concurrency and recall, or operating on high-dimensional data or large datatypes. We further find that on-cloud search demands significantly different indexing and search parameterizations versus on-disk search for optimal performance. Finally, we incorporate existing cloud-based caching setups into vector search and find that certain index optimizations work against caching, and study how this can be mitigated to maximize gains under various available cache sizes.

### Deep Forcing: Training-Free Long Video Generation with Deep Sink and Participative Compression
**Authors**: Jung Yi, Wooseok Jang, Paul Hyunbin Cho, Jisu Nam, Heeji Yoon, Seungryong Kim

**Updated**: 2025-12-04T18:46:44Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in autoregressive video diffusion have enabled real-time frame streaming, yet existing solutions still suffer from temporal repetition, drift, and motion deceleration. We find that naively applying StreamingLLM-style attention sinks to video diffusion leads to fidelity degradation and motion stagnation. To overcome this, we introduce Deep Forcing, which consists of two training-free mechanisms that address this without any fine-tuning. Specifically, 1) Deep Sink dedicates half of the sliding window to persistent sink tokens and re-aligns their temporal RoPE phase to the current timeline, stabilizing global context during long rollouts. 2) Participative Compression performs importance-aware KV cache pruning that preserves only tokens actively participating in recent attention while safely discarding redundant and degraded history, minimizing error accumulation under out-of-distribution length generation. Together, these components enable over 12x extrapolation (e.g. 5s-trained to 60s+ generation) with better imaging quality than LongLive, better aesthetic quality than RollingForcing, almost maintaining overall consistency, and substantial gains in dynamic degree, all while maintaining real-time generation. Our results demonstrate that training-free KV-cache management can match or exceed training-based approaches for autoregressively streaming long-video generation.

### A Survey on Diffusion Language Models
**Authors**: Tianyi Li, Mingda Chen, Bowei Guo, Zhiqiang Shen

**Updated**: 2025-12-04T17:57:10Z

**Summary**: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) are rapidly emerging as a powerful and promising alternative to the dominant autoregressive (AR) paradigm. By generating tokens in parallel through an iterative denoising process, DLMs possess inherent advantages in reducing inference latency and capturing bidirectional context, thereby enabling fine-grained control over the generation process. While achieving a several-fold speed-up, recent advancements have allowed DLMs to show performance comparable to their autoregressive counterparts, making them a compelling choice for various natural language processing tasks. In this survey, we provide a holistic overview of the current DLM landscape. We trace its evolution and relationship with other paradigms, such as autoregressive and masked language models, and cover both foundational principles and state-of-the-art models. Our work offers an up-to-date, comprehensive taxonomy and an in-depth analysis of current techniques, from pre-training strategies to advanced post-training methods. Another contribution of this survey is a thorough review of DLM inference strategies and optimizations, including improvements in decoding parallelism, caching mechanisms, and generation quality. We also highlight the latest approaches to multimodal extensions of DLMs and delineate their applications across various practical scenarios. Furthermore, our discussion addresses the limitations and challenges of DLMs, including efficiency, long-sequence handling, and infrastructure requirements, while outlining future research directions to sustain progress in this rapidly evolving field.

### KV Cache Recycling to Expand Usable Context Capacity in Low Parameter LLMs
**Authors**: Prashant Pandey

**Updated**: 2025-12-04T17:04:43Z

**Summary**: Whether attention key value (KV) states computed for one prompt for a small LLM can be reused to accelerate inference on a new similar prompt, giving an increase to the space to its context memory using an approach called token recycling. Using a standard Hugging Face setup with DialoGPT-medium (a 345M parameter GPT-2 style decoder trained on 147M Reddit exchanges, 2005 to 2017) as the testbed, we build a cache of past activations and get entries by sentence embeddings, then reuse cached past key values when the cached prompt is an exact prefix of the new input. We compare recycled vs. baseline runs on latency and output fidelity, and log reuse depth in tokens. Reproducibility requires no model modifications, cached KVs are serialized to the CPU, reloaded, and supplied to the generate function to continue decoding from the cached prefix. In tests, we observe consistent speedups when prefix overlap exists, with no material degradation in output semantics, and when overlap is absent, behavior matches baseline.

### LiteVGGT: Boosting Vanilla VGGT via Geometry-aware Cached Token Merging
**Authors**: Zhijian Shu, Cheng Lin, Tao Xie, Wei Yin, Ben Li, Zhiyuan Pu, Weize Li, Yao Yao, Xun Cao, Xiaoyang Guo, Xiao-Xiao Long

**Updated**: 2025-12-04T16:07:02Z

**Summary**: 3D vision foundation models like Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer (VGGT) have advanced greatly in geometric perception. However, it is time-consuming and memory-intensive for long sequences, limiting application to large-scale scenes beyond hundreds of images. To address this, we propose LiteVGGT, achieving up to 10x speedup and substantial memory reduction, enabling efficient processing of 1000-image scenes. We derive two key insights for 3D reconstruction: (1) tokens from local image regions have inherent geometric correlations, leading to high similarity and computational redundancy; (2) token similarity across adjacent network layers remains stable, allowing for reusable merge decisions. Guided by these, we design a simple yet efficient strategy, dubbed geometry-aware cached token merging. We analyze each token's geometric importance, optimizing anchor token selection to better preserve key information for reconstruction. We also cache and reuse merge indices across layers, substantially reducing latency with minimal accuracy impact. This strategy retains VGGT's core performance, enabling efficient fine-tuning and FP8 quantization for further gains. Extensive experiments validate LiteVGGT's effectiveness, scalability, and robustness. Project page: https://garlicba.github.io/LiteVGGT/

### Autoregressive Image Generation Needs Only a Few Lines of Cached Tokens
**Authors**: Ziran Qin, Youru Lv, Mingbao Lin, Zeren Zhang, Chanfan Gan, Tieyuan Chen, Weiyao Lin

**Updated**: 2025-12-04T14:41:21Z

**Summary**: Autoregressive (AR) visual generation has emerged as a powerful paradigm for image and multimodal synthesis, owing to its scalability and generality. However, existing AR image generation suffers from severe memory bottlenecks due to the need to cache all previously generated visual tokens during decoding, leading to both high storage requirements and low throughput. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{LineAR}, a novel, training-free progressive key-value (KV) cache compression pipeline for autoregressive image generation. By fully exploiting the intrinsic characteristics of visual attention, LineAR manages the cache at the line level using a 2D view, preserving the visual dependency regions while progressively evicting less-informative tokens that are harmless for subsequent line generation, guided by inter-line attention. LineAR enables efficient autoregressive (AR) image generation by utilizing only a few lines of cache, achieving both memory savings and throughput speedup, while maintaining or even improving generation quality. Extensive experiments across six autoregressive image generation models, including class-conditional and text-to-image generation, validate its effectiveness and generality. LineAR improves ImageNet FID from 2.77 to 2.68 and COCO FID from 23.85 to 22.86 on LlamaGen-XL and Janus-Pro-1B, while retaining only 1/6 KV cache. It also improves DPG on Lumina-mGPT-768 with just 1/8 KV cache. Additionally, LineAR achieves significant memory and throughput gains, including up to 67.61% memory reduction and 7.57x speedup on LlamaGen-XL, and 39.66% memory reduction and 5.62x speedup on Janus-Pro-7B.

 ### TimeLens: Rethinking Video Temporal Grounding with Multimodal LLMs
**Authors**: Jun Zhang, Teng Wang, Yuying Ge, Yixiao Ge, Xinhao Li, Ying Shan, Limin Wang

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T18:59:58Z

**Summary**: This paper does not introduce a novel method but instead establishes a straightforward, incremental, yet essential baseline for video temporal grounding (VTG), a core capability in video understanding. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) excel at various video understanding tasks, the recipes for optimizing them for VTG remain under-explored. In this paper, we present TimeLens, a systematic investigation into building MLLMs with strong VTG ability, along two primary dimensions: data quality and algorithmic design. We first expose critical quality issues in existing VTG benchmarks and introduce TimeLens-Bench, comprising meticulously re-annotated versions of three popular benchmarks with strict quality criteria. Our analysis reveals dramatic model re-rankings compared to legacy benchmarks, confirming the unreliability of prior evaluation standards. We also address noisy training data through an automated re-annotation pipeline, yielding TimeLens-100K, a large-scale, high-quality training dataset. Building on our data foundation, we conduct in-depth explorations of algorithmic design principles, yielding a series of meaningful insights and effective yet efficient practices. These include interleaved textual encoding for time representation, a thinking-free reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) approach as the training paradigm, and carefully designed recipes for RLVR training. These efforts culminate in TimeLens models, a family of MLLMs with state-of-the-art VTG performance among open-source models and even surpass proprietary models such as GPT-5 and Gemini-2.5-Flash. All codes, data, and models will be released to facilitate future research.

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T18:59:37Z

**Summary**: A recent study of the compact elliptical galaxy NGC 4486B using JWST-NIRSpec IFU kinematics confirmed a supermassive black hole (SMBH) of mass $M_{BH}=3.6\pm0.7\times10^8$ (~8% of the stellar mass). In addition to its double nucleus, the nuclear kinematics show pronounced asymmetries: a velocity-dispersion peak displaced by 6 pc from the galaxy center and a ~16 km/s offset in the mean stellar line-of-sight velocity near the SMBH. We examine the origin of the 12 pc double nucleus and these asymmetries and show that the observations favor an SMBH surrounded by an eccentric nuclear disk (END). END formation models require the SMBH to experience a gravitational wave (GW) recoil following a binary SMBH merger. Our orbit-superposition models contain ~50% retrograde stars at the edge of the nuclear region, in striking agreement with END-formation simulations. We infer a pre-merger mass ratio q>0.15 and a recoil kick of ~340 km/s. Our N-body simulations show that with such a kick, the SMBH returns to the center within ~30 Myr. Its flat central core is also consistent with earlier binary black hole scouring. We test two alternative mechanisms-buoyancy-driven oscillations and a pre-merger SMBH binary-but neither reproduces the observed offsets, favoring the GW-kick scenario. Our direct N-body simulations further show that a prograde SMBH binary in a rotating host can stall in a corotation resonance, delaying coalescence. Thus, although NGC 4486B is an old, relaxed galaxy near the Virgo cluster center, its SMBH appears to have merged only recently, making its nucleus a rare nearby laboratory for studying post-merger SMBH dynamics.

### Love First, Know Later: Persona-Based Romantic Compatibility Through LLM Text World Engines
**Authors**: Haoyang Shang, Zhengyang Yan, Xuan Liu

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T18:59:14Z

**Summary**: We propose Love First, Know Later: a paradigm shift in computational matching that simulates interactions first, then assesses compatibility. Instead of comparing static profiles, our framework leverages LLMs as text world engines that operate in dual capacity-as persona-driven agents following behavioral policies and as the environment modeling interaction dynamics. We formalize compatibility assessment as a reward-modeling problem: given observed matching outcomes, we learn to extract signals from simulations that predict human preferences. Our key insight is that relationships hinge on responses to critical moments-we translate this observation from relationship psychology into mathematical hypotheses, enabling effective simulation. Theoretically, we prove that as LLM policies better approximate human behavior, the induced matching converges to optimal stable matching. Empirically, we validate on speed dating data for initial chemistry and divorce prediction for long-term stability. This paradigm enables interactive, personalized matching systems where users iteratively refine their agents, unlocking future possibilities for transparent and interactive compatibility assessment.

### Native and Compact Structured Latents for 3D Generation
**Authors**: Jianfeng Xiang, Xiaoxue Chen, Sicheng Xu, Ruicheng Wang, Zelong Lv, Yu Deng, Hongyuan Zhu, Yue Dong, Hao Zhao, Nicholas Jing Yuan, Jiaolong Yang

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T18:58:28Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in 3D generative modeling have significantly improved the generation realism, yet the field is still hampered by existing representations, which struggle to capture assets with complex topologies and detailed appearance. This paper present an approach for learning a structured latent representation from native 3D data to address this challenge. At its core is a new sparse voxel structure called O-Voxel, an omni-voxel representation that encodes both geometry and appearance. O-Voxel can robustly model arbitrary topology, including open, non-manifold, and fully-enclosed surfaces, while capturing comprehensive surface attributes beyond texture color, such as physically-based rendering parameters. Based on O-Voxel, we design a Sparse Compression VAE which provides a high spatial compression rate and a compact latent space. We train large-scale flow-matching models comprising 4B parameters for 3D generation using diverse public 3D asset datasets. Despite their scale, inference remains highly efficient. Meanwhile, the geometry and material quality of our generated assets far exceed those of existing models. We believe our approach offers a significant advancement in 3D generative modeling.

### Effective-Hamiltonian reconstruction through Bloch-wave interferometry in bulk GaAs driven by strong THz fields
**Authors**: Qile Wu, Seamus D. O Hara, Joseph B. Costello, Loren N. Pfeiffer, Ken W. West, Mark S. Sherwin

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T18:57:48Z

**Summary**: Effective Hamiltonians (EHs) are powerful tools for understanding the emergent phenomena in condensed matter. Reconstructing an EH directly from experimental data is challenging due to the intricate relationship between EH parameters and observables. Complementary to ARPES, which probes surface electronic properties, bulk-sensitive techniques based on HHG and HSG have shown strong potential for EH reconstruction (EHR). We reconstruct an effective three-band electron-hole (e-h) Hamiltonian in bulk GaAs based on HSG induced by quasi-cw NIR and THz lasers. We perform polarimetry of high-order sidebands while varying the wavelength and polarization of the NIR laser and the strength of the THz field, to systematically explore the information encoded in the sidebands. Based on previous understanding of HSG in GaAs in terms of Bloch-wave interferometry (BWI), an analytic model is derived to quantitatively connect the EH parameters with the measured sideband electric fields under strong, low-frequency THz fields. Assuming that the exciton reduced mass and the parameter that defines the hole Bloch wavefunctions in GaAs are known from existing experiments, we show that the GaAs bandgap, two dephasing constants associated with two e-h species, and an EH parameter that determines the e-h reduced masses, can be simultaneously and unambiguously determined through BWI. We demonstrate that full EHR can be achieved by combining HSG measurements with absorbance spectroscopy. We find that the extracted bandgap of GaAs is about 13\,meV higher than the value inferred from previous absorbance measurements. Quantum-kinetic analysis suggests that the e-h energy in HSG may be renormalized through Fröhlich interaction that is modified by a strong THz field. We show that the energy threshold for optical-phonon emission can be suppressed by applying a strong THz field, leading to nearly constant dephasing rates.

### Spoken DialogSum: An Emotion-Rich Conversational Dataset for Spoken Dialogue Summarization
**Authors**: Yen-Ju Lu, Kunxiao Gao, Mingrui Liang, Helin Wang, Thomas Thebaud, Laureano Moro-Velazquez, Najim Dehak, Jesus Villalba

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T18:54:20Z

**Summary**: Recent audio language models can follow long conversations. However, research on emotion-aware or spoken dialogue summarization is constrained by the lack of data that links speech, summaries, and paralinguistic cues. We introduce Spoken DialogSum, the first corpus aligning raw conversational audio with factual summaries, emotion-rich summaries, and utterance-level labels for speaker age, gender, and emotion. The dataset is built in two stages: first, an LLM rewrites DialogSum scripts with Switchboard-style fillers and back-channels, then tags each utterance with emotion, pitch, and speaking rate. Second, an expressive TTS engine synthesizes speech from the tagged scripts, aligned with paralinguistic labels. Spoken DialogSum comprises 13,460 emotion-diverse dialogues, each paired with both a factual and an emotion-focused summary. The dataset is available online at https://fatfat-emosum.github.io/EmoDialog-Sum-Audio-Samples/. Baselines show that an Audio-LLM raises emotional-summary ROUGE-L by 28% relative to a cascaded ASR-LLM system, confirming the value of end-to-end speech modeling.

### Misspecification-robust amortised simulation-based inference using variational methods
**Authors**: Matthew O'Callaghan, Kaisey S. Mandel, Gerry Gilmore

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T18:48:04Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in neural density estimation have enabled powerful simulation-based inference (SBI) methods that can flexibly approximate Bayesian inference for intractable stochastic models. Although these methods have demonstrated reliable posterior estimation when the simulator accurately represents the underlying data generative process (DGP), recent work has shown that they perform poorly in the presence of model misspecification. This poses a significant issue for their use in real-world problems, due to simulators always misrepresenting the true DGP to a certain degree. In this paper, we introduce robust variational neural posterior estimation (RVNP), a method which addresses the problem of misspecification in amortised SBI by bridging the simulation-to-reality gap using variational inference and error modelling. We test RVNP on multiple benchmark tasks, including using real data from astronomy, and show that it can recover robust posterior inference in a data-driven manner without adopting hyperparameters or priors governing the misspecification influence.

### Fast and Accurate Causal Parallel Decoding using Jacobi Forcing
**Authors**: Lanxiang Hu, Siqi Kou, Yichao Fu, Samyam Rajbhandari, Tajana Rosing, Yuxiong He, Zhijie Deng, Hao Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T18:45:18Z

**Summary**: Multi-token generation has emerged as a promising paradigm for accelerating transformer-based large model inference. Recent efforts primarily explore diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) for parallel decoding to reduce inference latency. To achieve AR-level generation quality, many techniques adapt AR models into dLLMs to enable parallel decoding. However, they suffer from limited speedup compared to AR models due to a pretrain-to-posttrain mismatch. Specifically, the masked data distribution in post-training deviates significantly from the real-world data distribution seen during pretraining, and dLLMs rely on bidirectional attention, which conflicts with the causal prior learned during pretraining and hinders the integration of exact KV cache reuse. To address this, we introduce Jacobi Forcing, a progressive distillation paradigm where models are trained on their own generated parallel decoding trajectories, smoothly shifting AR models into efficient parallel decoders while preserving their pretrained causal inference property. The models trained under this paradigm, Jacobi Forcing Model, achieves 3.8x wall-clock speedup on coding and math benchmarks with minimal loss in performance. Based on Jacobi Forcing Models' trajectory characteristics, we introduce multi-block decoding with rejection recycling, which enables up to 4.5x higher token acceptance count per iteration and nearly 4.0x wall-clock speedup, effectively trading additional compute for lower inference latency. Our code is available at https://github.com/hao-ai-lab/JacobiForcing.

### VIBE: Can a VLM Read the Room?
**Authors**: Tania Chakraborty, Eylon Caplan, Dan Goldwasser

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T18:42:51Z

**Summary**: Understanding human social behavior such as recognizing emotions and the social dynamics causing them is an important and challenging problem. While LLMs have made remarkable advances, they are limited to the textual domain and cannot account for the major role that non-verbal cues play in understanding social situations. Vision Language Models (VLMs) can potentially account for this gap, however their ability to make correct inferences over such social cues has received little attention. In this paper, we explore the capabilities of VLMs at social reasoning. We identify a previously overlooked limitation in VLMs: the Visual Social-Pragmatic Inference gap. To target this gap, we propose a new task for VLMs: Visual Social-Pragmatic Inference. We construct a high quality dataset to test the abilities of a VLM for this task and benchmark the performance of several VLMs on it.

### Reconsidering Conversational Norms in LLM Chatbots for Sustainable AI
**Authors**: Ronnie de Souza Santos, Cleyton Magalhães, Italo Santos

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T18:38:11Z

**Summary**: LLM based chatbots have become central interfaces in technical, educational, and analytical domains, supporting tasks such as code reasoning, problem solving, and information exploration. As these systems scale, sustainability concerns have intensified, with most assessments focusing on model architecture, hardware efficiency, and deployment infrastructure. However, existing mitigation efforts largely overlook how user interaction practices themselves shape the energy profile of LLM based systems. In this vision paper, we argue that interaction level behavior appears to be an underexamined factor shaping the environmental impact of LLM based systems, and we present this issue across four dimensions. First, extended conversational patterns increase token production and raise the computational cost of inference. Second, expectations of instant responses limit opportunities for energy aware scheduling and workload consolidation. Third, everyday user habits contribute to cumulative operational demand in ways that are rarely quantified. Fourth, the accumulation of context affects memory requirements and reduces the efficiency of long running dialogues. Addressing these challenges requires rethinking how chatbot interactions are designed and conceptualized, and adopting perspectives that recognize sustainability as partly dependent on the conversational norms through which users engage with LLM based systems.

### Temporal Tokenization Strategies for Event Sequence Modeling with Large Language Models
**Authors**: Zefang Liu, Nam H. Nguyen, Yinzhu Quan, Shi-Xiong Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T18:35:40Z

**Summary**: Representing continuous time is a critical and under-explored challenge in modeling temporal event sequences with large language models (LLMs). Various strategies like byte-level representations or calendar tokens have been proposed. However, the optimal approach remains unclear, especially given the diverse statistical distributions of real-world event data, which range from smooth log-normal to discrete, spiky patterns. This paper presents the first empirical study of temporal tokenization for event sequences, comparing distinct encoding strategies: naive numeric strings, high-precision byte-level representations, human-semantic calendar tokens, classic uniform binning, and adaptive residual scalar quantization. We evaluate these strategies by fine-tuning LLMs on real-world datasets that exemplify these diverse distributions. Our analysis reveals that no single strategy is universally superior; instead, prediction performance depends heavily on aligning the tokenizer with the data's statistical properties, with log-based strategies excelling on skewed distributions and human-centric formats proving robust for mixed modalities.

### ModernVBERT: Towards Smaller Visual Document Retrievers
**Authors**: Paul Teiletche, Quentin Macé, Max Conti, Antonio Loison, Gautier Viaud, Pierre Colombo, Manuel Faysse

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T18:33:42Z

**Summary**: Retrieving specific information from a large corpus of documents is a prevalent industrial use case of modern AI, notably due to the popularity of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Although neural document retrieval models have historically operated exclusively in the text space, Visual Document Retrieval (VDR) models - large vision-language decoders repurposed as embedding models which directly work with page screenshots as inputs - are increasingly popular due to the performance and indexing latency gains they offer. In this work, we show that, while cost-efficient, this approach of repurposing generative models bottlenecks retrieval performance. Through controlled experiments, we revisit the entire training pipeline, and establish a principled recipe for improving visual document retrieval models. We notably measure the impact of attention masking, image resolution, modality alignment data regimes, and late interaction centered contrastive objectives which emerge as central performance factors. Building on these insights, we release ModernVBERT, a compact 250M-parameter vision-language encoder that outperforms recent models up to 10 times larger when fine-tuned on document retrieval tasks, enabling efficient inference on cheap CPU hardware and greatly reducing latency and costs while maintaining strong performance. Models, code and data are available at https://huggingface.co/ModernVBERT.

### Focus: A Streaming Concentration Architecture for Efficient Vision-Language Models
**Authors**: Chiyue Wei, Cong Guo, Junyao Zhang, Haoxuan Shan, Yifan Xu, Ziyue Zhang, Yudong Liu, Qinsi Wang, Changchun Zhou, Hai "Helen" Li, Yiran Chen

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T18:21:18Z

**Summary**: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on tasks such as video captioning and visual question answering. However, their growing scale and video-level inputs lead to significant computational and memory overhead, posing challenges for real-time deployment on hardware accelerators. While prior work attempts to reduce redundancy via token pruning or merging, these methods typically operate at coarse granularity and incur high runtime overhead due to global token-level operations. In this study, we propose Focus, a Streaming Concentration Architecture that efficiently accelerates VLM inference through progressive, fine-grained redundancy elimination. Focus introduces a multilevel concentration paradigm that hierarchically compresses vision-language inputs at three levels: (1) semantic-guided token pruning based on textual prompts, (2) spatial-temporal block-level concentration using localized comparisons, and (3) vector-level redundancy removal via motion-aware matching. All concentration steps are tightly co-designed with the architecture to support streaming-friendly, on-chip execution. Focus leverages GEMM tiling, convolution-style layout, and cross-modal attention to minimize off-chip access while enabling high throughput. Implemented as a modular unit within a systolic-array accelerator, Focus achieves a 2.4x speedup and 3.3x reduction in energy, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art accelerators in both performance and energy efficiency. Full-stack implementation of Focus is open-sourced at https://github.com/dubcyfor3/Focus.

### Analysis and Uncertainty Quantification of Thermal Transport Measurements through Bayesian Parameter Estimation
**Authors**: Jeremy Drew, Shravan Godse, Yuxing Liang, Abhishek Pathak, Jonathan A. Malen, Rachel C. Kurchin

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T18:20:51Z

**Summary**: The thermal transport community is increasingly interested in rigorous uncertainty quantification (UQ) of their measurements. In this work, we argue that Bayesian parameter estimation (BPE) represents a powerful framework for both analysis/fitting and UQ. We provide a detailed walkthrough of the technique (including code to duplicate our results) and example analysis based on measuring the thermal conductance of a gold/sapphire interface with FDTR. Comparisons are made against traditional analysis/UQ techniques adopted by the thermal transport community. Notable advantages of BPE include the interpretability of its results, including the capacity to indicate incorrect input assumptions, as well as a way to balance overall goodness of fit against prior knowledge of feasible parameter values. In some cases, incorporating this additional information can affect not only the magnitude of error bars but the inferred values themselves.

### ViRC: Enhancing Visual Interleaved Mathematical CoT with Reason Chunking
**Authors**: Lihong Wang, Liangqi Li, Weiwei Feng, Jiamin Wu, Changtao Miao, Tieru Wu, Rui Ma, Bo Zhang, Zhe Li

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T18:13:54Z

**Summary**: CoT has significantly enhanced the reasoning ability of LLMs while it faces challenges when extended to multimodal domains, particularly in mathematical tasks. Existing MLLMs typically perform textual reasoning solely from a single static mathematical image, overlooking dynamic visual acquisition during reasoning. In contrast, humans repeatedly examine visual image and employ step-by-step reasoning to prove intermediate propositions. This strategy of decomposing the problem-solving process into key logical nodes adheres to Miller's Law in cognitive science. Inspired by this insight, we propose a ViRC framework for multimodal mathematical tasks, introducing a Reason Chunking mechanism that structures multimodal mathematical CoT into consecutive Critical Reasoning Units (CRUs) to simulate human expert problem-solving patterns. CRUs ensure intra-unit textual coherence for intermediate proposition verification while integrating visual information across units to generate subsequent propositions and support structured reasoning. To this end, we present CRUX dataset by using three visual tools and four reasoning patterns to provide explicitly annotated CRUs across multiple reasoning paths for each mathematical problem. Leveraging the CRUX dataset, we propose a progressive training strategy inspired by human cognitive learning, which includes Instructional SFT, Practice SFT, and Strategic RL, aimed at further strengthening the Reason Chunking ability of the model.The resulting ViRC-7B model achieves a 18.8\% average improvement over baselines across multiple mathematical benchmarks. Code is available at https://github.com/Leon-LihongWang/ViRC.

### Understanding Sampler Stochasticity in Training Diffusion Models for RLHF
**Authors**: Jiayuan Sheng, Hanyang Zhao, Haoxian Chen, David D. Yao, Wenpin Tang

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T18:10:07Z

**Summary**: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is increasingly used to fine-tune diffusion models, but a key challenge arises from the mismatch between stochastic samplers used during training and deterministic samplers used during inference. In practice, models are fine-tuned using stochastic SDE samplers to encourage exploration, while inference typically relies on deterministic ODE samplers for efficiency and stability. This discrepancy induces a reward gap, raising concerns about whether high-quality outputs can be expected during inference. In this paper, we theoretically characterize this reward gap and provide non-vacuous bounds for general diffusion models, along with sharper convergence rates for Variance Exploding (VE) and Variance Preserving (VP) Gaussian models. Methodologically, we adopt the generalized denoising diffusion implicit models (gDDIM) framework to support arbitrarily high levels of stochasticity, preserving data marginals throughout. Empirically, our findings through large-scale experiments on text-to-image models using denoising diffusion policy optimization (DDPO) and mixed group relative policy optimization (MixGRPO) validate that reward gaps consistently narrow over training, and ODE sampling quality improves when models are updated using higher-stochasticity SDE training.

### Latent Self-Consistency for Reliable Majority-Set Selection in Short- and Long-Answer Reasoning
**Authors**: Jungsuk Oh, Jay-Yoon Lee

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T17:50:43Z

**Summary**: Probabilistic decoding in Large Language Models (LLMs) often yields inconsistent outputs, particularly on complex or long-form questions. Self-Consistency (SC) mitigates this for short-form QA by majority voting over exact strings, whereas Universal Self-Consistency (USC) and Weighted Unigram Consistency Score (WUCS) extend to long-form responses but lose accuracy on short-form benchmarks.   We introduce \textbf{Latent Self-Consistency (LSC)}, which selects the most semantically consistent response using learnable token embeddings. LSC's lightweight forward processing of summary tokens only introduces negligible runtime overhead (at most $0.9\%$) on top of standard decoding of the base LLM, and requires no changes to the model architecture.   Across 6 short-form and 5 long-form reasoning benchmarks (e.g., MATH, MMLU, TruthfulQA), LSC surpasses SC, USC, and WUCS on both short-form and long-form on average performance, while adding negligible computational overhead on vanilla inference. These results position LSC as a reliable consistency-selection method that works effectively across various answer formats. Additionally, LSC provides well-calibrated confidence estimates, maintaining low expected calibration error across both answer formats.

### Beyond Text-to-SQL: Autonomous Research-Driven Database Exploration with DAR
**Authors**: Ostap Vykhopen, Viktoria Skorik, Maxim Tereschenko, Veronika Solopova

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T17:36:09Z

**Summary**: Large language models can already query databases, yet most existing systems remain reactive: they rely on explicit user prompts and do not actively explore data. We introduce DAR (Data Agnostic Researcher), a multi-agent system that performs end-to-end database research without human-initiated queries. DAR orchestrates specialized AI agents across three layers: initialization (intent inference and metadata extraction), execution (SQL and AI-based query synthesis with iterative validation), and synthesis (report generation with built-in quality control). All reasoning is executed directly inside BigQuery using native generative AI functions, eliminating data movement and preserving data governance. On a realistic asset-incident dataset, DAR completes the full analytical task in 16 minutes, compared to 8.5 hours for a professional analyst (approximately 32x times faster), while producing useful pattern-based insights and evidence-grounded recommendations. Although human experts continue to offer deeper contextual interpretation, DAR excels at rapid exploratory analysis. Overall, this work shifts database interaction from query-driven assistance toward autonomous, research-driven exploration within cloud data warehouses.

### Asymptotic Inference for Rank Correlations
**Authors**: Marc-Oliver Pohle, Jan-Lukas Wermuth, Christian H. Weiß

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T17:19:56Z

**Summary**: Kendall's tau and Spearman's rho are widely used tools for measuring dependence. Surprisingly, when it comes to asymptotic inference for these rank correlations, some fundamental results and methods have not yet been developed, in particular for discrete random variables and in the time series case, and concerning variance estimation in general. Consequently, asymptotic confidence intervals are not available. We provide a comprehensive treatment of asymptotic inference for classical rank correlations, including Kendall's tau, Spearman's rho, Goodman-Kruskal's gamma, Kendall's tau-b, and grade correlation. We derive asymptotic distributions for both iid and time series data, resorting to asymptotic results for U-statistics, and introduce consistent variance estimators. This enables the construction of confidence intervals and tests, generalizes classical results for continuous random variables and leads to corrected versions of widely used tests of independence. We analyze the finite-sample performance of our variance estimators, confidence intervals, and tests in simulations and illustrate their use in case studies.

### Semantic-Drive: Democratizing Long-Tail Data Curation via Open-Vocabulary Grounding and Neuro-Symbolic VLM Consensus
**Authors**: Antonio Guillen-Perez

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T17:15:46Z

**Summary**: The development of robust Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) is bottlenecked by the scarcity of "Long-Tail" training data. While fleets collect petabytes of video logs, identifying rare safety-critical events (e.g., erratic jaywalking, construction diversions) remains a manual, cost-prohibitive process. Existing solutions rely on coarse metadata search, which lacks precision, or cloud-based VLMs, which are privacy-invasive and expensive. We introduce Semantic-Drive, a local-first, neuro-symbolic framework for semantic data mining. Our approach decouples perception into two stages: (1) Symbolic Grounding via a real-time open-vocabulary detector (YOLOE) to anchor attention, and (2) Cognitive Analysis via a Reasoning VLM that performs forensic scene analysis. To mitigate hallucination, we implement a "System 2" inference-time alignment strategy, utilizing a multi-model "Judge-Scout" consensus mechanism. Benchmarked on the nuScenes dataset against the Waymo Open Dataset (WOD-E2E) taxonomy, Semantic-Drive achieves a Recall of 0.966 (vs. 0.475 for CLIP) and reduces Risk Assessment Error by 40% ccompared to the best single scout models. The system runs entirely on consumer hardware (NVIDIA RTX 3090), offering a privacy-preserving alternative to the cloud.

### LLmFPCA-detect: LLM-powered Multivariate Functional PCA for Anomaly Detection in Sparse Longitudinal Texts
**Authors**: Prasanjit Dubey, Aritra Guha, Zhengyi Zhou, Qiong Wu, Xiaoming Huo, Paromita Dubey

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T17:14:10Z

**Summary**: Sparse longitudinal (SL) textual data arises when individuals generate text repeatedly over time (e.g., customer reviews, occasional social media posts, electronic medical records across visits), but the frequency and timing of observations vary across individuals. These complex textual data sets have immense potential to inform future policy and targeted recommendations. However, because SL text data lack dedicated methods and are noisy, heterogeneous, and prone to anomalies, detecting and inferring key patterns is challenging. We introduce LLmFPCA-detect, a flexible framework that pairs LLM-based text embeddings with functional data analysis to detect clusters and infer anomalies in large SL text datasets. First, LLmFPCA-detect embeds each piece of text into an application-specific numeric space using LLM prompts. Sparse multivariate functional principal component analysis (mFPCA) conducted in the numeric space forms the workhorse to recover primary population characteristics, and produces subject-level scores which, together with baseline static covariates, facilitate data segmentation, unsupervised anomaly detection and inference, and enable other downstream tasks. In particular, we leverage LLMs to perform dynamic keyword profiling guided by the data segments and anomalies discovered by LLmFPCA-detect, and we show that cluster-specific functional PC scores from LLmFPCA-detect, used as features in existing pipelines, help boost prediction performance. We support the stability of LLmFPCA-detect with experiments and evaluate it on two different applications using public datasets, Amazon customer-review trajectories, and Wikipedia talk-page comment streams, demonstrating utility across domains and outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.

### PerProb: Indirectly Evaluating Memorization in Large Language Models
**Authors**: Yihan Liao, Jacky Keung, Xiaoxue Ma, Jingyu Zhang, Yicheng Sun

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T17:10:01Z

**Summary**: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has been driven by extensive datasets that may contain sensitive information, raising serious privacy concerns. One notable threat is the Membership Inference Attack (MIA), where adversaries infer whether a specific sample was used in model training. However, the true impact of MIA on LLMs remains unclear due to inconsistent findings and the lack of standardized evaluation methods, further complicated by the undisclosed nature of many LLM training sets. To address these limitations, we propose PerProb, a unified, label-free framework for indirectly assessing LLM memorization vulnerabilities. PerProb evaluates changes in perplexity and average log probability between data generated by victim and adversary models, enabling an indirect estimation of training-induced memory. Compared with prior MIA methods that rely on member/non-member labels or internal access, PerProb is independent of model and task, and applicable in both black-box and white-box settings. Through a systematic classification of MIA into four attack patterns, we evaluate PerProb's effectiveness across five datasets, revealing varying memory behaviors and privacy risks among LLMs. Additionally, we assess mitigation strategies, including knowledge distillation, early stopping, and differential privacy, demonstrating their effectiveness in reducing data leakage. Our findings offer a practical and generalizable framework for evaluating and improving LLM privacy.

### The role of mergers and rejuvenation in the buildup of the quiescent population at cosmic noon
**Authors**: Jimi Evan Harrold, Omar Almaini, Frazer R. Pearce, Robert M. Yates, Dave Maltby, Kate Rowlands, Vivienne Wild, Maya Skarbinski, Thomas de Lisle

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T17:08:34Z

**Summary**: We investigate the quenching of galaxies using a mock observational lightcone generated from the Semi-Analytic Model (SAM) L-Galaxies, closely matched to observations from the UKIDSS Ultra Deep Survey (UDS). The sample is used to study merging, rejuvenation, and visibility times for star-forming, quiescent, and post-starburst (PSB) galaxies, to assess the impact on the build-up of the passive galaxy mass functions.   We find, for example, that a typical PSB ($M_\ast\sim10^{10}$\,M$_\odot$) at $z\approx1$ has a 15 per cent likelihood of merging and around a 25 per cent likelihood of rejuvenating within 1 Gyr of being identified. Applying these rates and timescales to the observational data, we estimate the fraction of quiescent galaxies that passed through a PSB phase. We find that $18 - 28$ per cent of the build-up in the massive end ($M_\ast>10^{10}$\,M$\,_\odot$) of the passive mass function at $1<z<2$ can be explained by PSBs, with the contribution declining to $\sim5$ per cent by $z \simeq 0.5$. Accounting for mergers and rejuvenation reduces the inferred PSB contribution by approximately a factor of two. At lower stellar masses ($M_\ast < 10^{10}$\,M$_\odot$), rapid quenching through a PSB phase explains a significantly larger fraction of the growth in the passive mass function. With a visibility time of $\sim$ 0.75 Gyr, we find that around $60-80$ per cent of low-mass passive galaxies underwent a PSB phase. Our findings provide further evidence that low- and high-mass galaxies follow different quenching pathways.

### Multi-Model Ensemble and Reservoir Computing for River Discharge Prediction in Ungauged Basins
**Authors**: Mizuki Funato, Yohei Sawada

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T17:07:02Z

**Summary**: Despite the necessity for accurate flood prediction, many regions lack sufficient river discharge observations. Although numerous models for daily river discharge prediction exist, achieving high accuracy, interpretability, and efficiency under data-scarce conditions remains a major challenge. We address this with a novel method, HYdrological Prediction with multi-model Ensemble and Reservoir computing (HYPER). Our approach applies Bayesian model averaging (BMA) to 47 "uncalibrated" catchment-based conceptual hydrological models. A reservoir computing (RC) model, a type of machine learning model, is then trained via linear regression to correct BMA output errors, a non-iterative process ensuring computational efficiency. For ungauged basins, we infer the required BMA and RC weights by mapping them to catchment attributes from gauged basins, creating a generalizable framework. Evaluated on 87 Japanese basins, in a data-rich scenario, HYPER (median Nash Sutcliffe Efficiency, NSE, of 0.59) performed comparably to a benchmark LSTM (NSE 0.64) but required only 3 % of its computational time. In a data-scarce scenario (where only ~20 % of basins are gauged), HYPER maintained robust performance (NSE 0.51) by leveraging the physical structure of the ensemble. In contrast, the LSTM's performance degraded substantially (NSE -0.61) due to data insufficiency. These results demonstrate that calibrating individual conceptual hydrological models is unnecessary when using a sufficiently large ensemble that is assembled and combined with machine-learning-based bias correction. HYPER provides a robust, efficient, and generalizable solution for discharge prediction, particularly in ungauged basins. By eliminating basin-specific calibration, HYPER offers a scalable, interpretable framework for accurate hydrological prediction in diverse data-scarce regions.

### LLM-driven Knowledge Enhancement for Multimodal Cancer Survival Prediction
**Authors**: Chenyu Zhao, Yingxue Xu, Fengtao Zhou, Yihui Wang, Hao Chen

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T17:03:56Z

**Summary**: Current multimodal survival prediction methods typically rely on pathology images (WSIs) and genomic data, both of which are high-dimensional and redundant, making it difficult to extract discriminative features from them and align different modalities. Moreover, using a simple survival follow-up label is insufficient to supervise such a complex task. To address these challenges, we propose KEMM, an LLM-driven Knowledge-Enhanced Multimodal Model for cancer survival prediction, which integrates expert reports and prognostic background knowledge. 1) Expert reports, provided by pathologists on a case-by-case basis and refined by large language model (LLM), offer succinct and clinically focused diagnostic statements. This information may typically suggest different survival outcomes. 2) Prognostic background knowledge (PBK), generated concisely by LLM, provides valuable prognostic background knowledge on different cancer types, which also enhances survival prediction. To leverage these knowledge, we introduce the knowledge-enhanced cross-modal (KECM) attention module. KECM can effectively guide the network to focus on discriminative and survival-relevant features from highly redundant modalities. Extensive experiments on five datasets demonstrate that KEMM achieves state-of-the-art performance. The code will be released upon acceptance.

**Authors**: Ruida Cheng, Tejas Sudharshan Mathai, Pritam Mukherjee, Benjamin Hou, Qingqing Zhu, Zhiyong Lu, Matthew McAuliffe, Ronald M. Summers

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T17:03:17Z

**Summary**: Segmentation of lesions on CT enables automatic measurement for clinical assessment of chronic diseases (e.g., lymphoma). Integrating large language models (LLMs) into the lesion segmentation workflow has the potential to combine imaging features with descriptions of lesion characteristics from the radiology reports. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of integrating text into the Swin-UMamba architecture for the task of lesion segmentation. The publicly available ULS23 DeepLesion dataset was used along with short-form descriptions of the findings from the reports. On the test dataset, our method achieved a high Dice score of 82.64, and a low Hausdorff distance of 6.34 pixels was obtained for lesion segmentation. The proposed Text-Swin-U/Mamba model outperformed prior approaches: 37.79% improvement over the LLM-driven LanGuideMedSeg model (p < 0.001), and surpassed the purely image-based XLSTM-UNet and nnUNet models by 2.58% and 1.01%, respectively. The dataset and code can be accessed at https://github.com/ruida/LLM-Swin-UMamba

### Towards Nepali-language LLMs: Efficient GPT training with a Nepali BPE tokenizer
**Authors**: Adarsha Shrestha, Basanta Pokharel, Binit Shrestha, Smriti Adhikari, Dinesh Gothe

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T16:53:11Z

**Summary**: Nepali, a low-resource language spoken by over 32 million people, continues to face challenges in natural language processing (NLP) due to its complex grammar, agglutinative morphology, and limited availability of high-quality corpora. Most efforts to date have centered on basic encoder architectures; they remain insufficient for Nepali-specific text generation. This study presents a GPT-2-based Nepali language model trained using several training strategies inspired by GPT-3, including optimized learning rate schedules, batch scaling, and architectural refinements. A custom 16k Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenizer was trained exclusively on Nepali text to ensure more consistent segmentation and improved input representation. The model was pretrained on a combined dataset comprising a 10.75GB cleaned NepBERTa corpus and additional web-scraped Nepali news articles. FlashAttention was integrated to reduce memory usage and stabilize training. After two epochs, the model achieved a training loss of 3.168177, a validation loss of 3.081982, and a final perplexity of 21.80, demonstrating its capability to generate coherent Nepali news-style text.

### Semiparametric inference for impulse response functions using double/debiased machine learning
**Authors**: Daniele Ballinari, Alexander Wehrli

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T16:51:35Z

**Summary**: We introduce a double/debiased machine learning estimator for the impulse response function in settings where a time series of interest is subjected to multiple discrete treatments, assigned over time, which can have a causal effect on future outcomes. The proposed estimator can rely on fully nonparametric relations between treatment and outcome variables, opening up the possibility to use flexible machine learning approaches to estimate impulse response functions. To this end, we extend the theory of double machine learning from an i.i.d. to a time series setting and show that the proposed estimator is consistent and asymptotically normally distributed at the parametric rate, allowing for semiparametric inference for dynamic effects in a time series setting. The properties of the estimator are validated numerically in finite samples by applying it to learn the impulse response function in the presence of serial dependence in both the confounder and observation innovation processes. We also illustrate the methodology empirically by applying it to the estimation of the effects of macroeconomic shocks.

### Reading Qubits with Sequential Weak Measurements: Limits of Information Extraction
**Authors**: Cesar Lema, Aleix Bou-Comas, Atithi Acharya, Vadim Oganesyan, Anirvan Sengupta

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T16:50:50Z

**Summary**: Quantum information processing and computation requires high accuracy qubit configuration readout. In many practical schemes, the initial qubit configuration has to be inferred from readout that is a time-dependent weak measurement record. However, a combination of the measurement scheme and intrinsic dynamics can end up scrambling the initial state and lose information irretrievably. Here, we study the information physics of quantum trajectories based on weak measurements in order to address the optimal achievable performance in qubit configuration readout for two realistic models of single qubit readout: (i) Model I is informationally complete, but without intrinsic dynamics; (ii) Model II is informationally incomplete weak measurements with intrinsic dynamics. We first use mutual information to characterize how much intrinsic information about the initial state is encoded in the measurement record. Using a fixed discrete time-step formulation, we compute the mutual information while varying the measurement strength, duration of measurement record, and the relative strength of intrinsic dynamics in our measurement schemes. We also exploit the emergence of continuum scaling and the Stochastic Master Equation in the weak measurement limit. We develop an asymptotic expansion in the measurement efficiency parameter to calculate mutual information, which captures qualitative and quantitative features of the numerical data. The bounds on information extraction are manifested as plateaux in mutual information, our analysis obtains these bounds and also optimal duration of measurement required to saturate them. Our results should be useful both for quantum device operation and optimization and also, possibly, for improving the performance of recent machine learning approaches for qubit and multiqubit configuration readout in current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) experiment regimes.

**Summary**: This paper introduces PolyPersona, a generative framework for synthesizing persona-conditioned survey responses across multiple domains. The framework instruction-tunes compact chat models using parameter-efficient LoRA adapters with 4-bit quantization under a resource-adaptive training setup. A dialogue-based data pipeline explicitly preserves persona cues, ensuring consistent behavioral alignment across generated responses. Using this pipeline, we construct a dataset of 3,568 synthetic survey responses spanning ten domains and 433 distinct personas, enabling controlled instruction tuning and systematic multi-domain evaluation. We evaluate the generated responses using a multi-metric evaluation suite that combines standard text generation metrics, including BLEU, ROUGE, and BERTScore, with survey-specific metrics designed to assess structural coherence, stylistic consistency, and sentiment alignment.Experimental results show that compact models such as TinyLlama 1.1B and Phi-2 achieve performance comparable to larger 7B to 8B baselines, with a highest BLEU score of 0.090 and ROUGE-1 of 0.429. These findings demonstrate that persona-conditioned fine-tuning enables small language models to generate reliable and coherent synthetic survey data. The proposed framework provides an efficient and reproducible approach for survey data generation, supporting scalable evaluation while facilitating bias analysis through transparent and open protocols.

### Agreement Between Large Language Models and Human Raters in Essay Scoring: A Research Synthesis
**Authors**: Hongli Li, Che Han Chen, Kevin Fan, Chiho Young-Johnson, Soyoung Lim, Yali Feng

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T16:33:07Z

**Summary**: Despite the growing promise of large language models (LLMs) in automatic essay scoring (AES), empirical findings regarding their reliability compared to human raters remain mixed. Following the PRISMA 2020 guidelines, we synthesized 65 published and unpublished studies from January 2022 to August 2025 that examined agreement between LLMs and human raters in AES. Across studies, reported LLM-human agreement was generally moderate to good, with agreement indices (e.g., Quadratic Weighted Kappa, Pearson correlation, and Spearman's rho) mostly ranging between 0.30 and 0.80. Substantial variability in agreement levels was observed across studies, reflecting differences in study-specific factors as well as the lack of standardized reporting practices. Implications and directions for future research are discussed.

**Summary**: The assembly and co-evolution of supermassive black holes (SMBH) and their host galaxy stellar population is a key open questions in galaxy evolution. Stellar mass ($M_\star$) and star formation rate (SFR), are inferred by modeling the spectral energy distribution (SED). For galaxies triggering SMBH activity, the active galactic nucleus (AGN) contaminates the light at all wavelengths, hampering the inference of galaxy parameters. Incomplete AGN templates can lead to systematic overestimates of the stellar mass, biasing our understanding of AGN-galaxy co-evolution. This challenge has gained further impetus with the advent of sensitive wide-area surveys with millions of luminous AGN, including by eROSITA, Euclid and LSST. We aim to estimate the accuracy and bias of AGN host galaxy parameters and improve upon existing techniques. This work makes two contributions: 1) a new SED fitting code, GRAHSP, with a flexible, empirically motivated AGN model including a power law continuum emission lines, a FeII forest and a flexible infrared torus. We verify that our model reproduces published X-ray to infrared SEDs of AGN to better than 20\% accuracy. A fully Bayesian fit with nested sampling includes uncertainties in the model and the data, making the inference highly robust. 2) we created a benchmark photometric dataset where pure quasars are merged with non-AGN pure galaxies into a hybrid (Chimera) object but with known galaxy and AGN properties. Comparing the true and retrieved $M_\star$, SFR and AGN luminosities shows that previous codes systematically over-estimate $M_\star$ and SFR by 0.5 dex with a wide scatter of 0.7 dex, at AGN luminosities above 10^44 erg/s. In contrast, GRAHSP shows no bias on $M_\star$ and SFR. GRAHSP also estimates more realistic uncertainties. GRAHSP enables characterization of the environmental conditions conducive to black hole growth. (abridged)

### PrivATE: Differentially Private Average Treatment Effect Estimation for Observational Data
**Authors**: Quan Yuan, Xiaochen Li, Linkang Du, Min Chen, Mingyang Sun, Yunjun Gao, Shibo He, Jiming Chen, Zhikun Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T16:30:07Z

**Summary**: Causal inference plays a crucial role in scientific research across multiple disciplines. Estimating causal effects, particularly the average treatment effect (ATE), from observational data has garnered significant attention. However, computing the ATE from real-world observational data poses substantial privacy risks to users. Differential privacy, which offers strict theoretical guarantees, has emerged as a standard approach for privacy-preserving data analysis. However, existing differentially private ATE estimation works rely on specific assumptions, provide limited privacy protection, or fail to offer comprehensive information protection.   To this end, we introduce PrivATE, a practical ATE estimation framework that ensures differential privacy. In fact, various scenarios require varying levels of privacy protection. For example, only test scores are generally sensitive information in education evaluation, while all types of medical record data are usually private. To accommodate different privacy requirements, we design two levels (i.e., label-level and sample-level) of privacy protection in PrivATE. By deriving an adaptive matching limit, PrivATE effectively balances noise-induced error and matching error, leading to a more accurate estimate of ATE. Our evaluation validates the effectiveness of PrivATE. PrivATE outperforms the baselines on all datasets and privacy budgets.

**Authors**: Nguyen Tien Dong, Minh-Anh Nguyen, Thanh Dat Hoang, Nguyen Tuan Ngoc, Dao Xuan Quang Minh, Phan Phi Hai, Nguyen Thi Ngoc Anh, Dang Van Tu, Binh Vu

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T16:28:32Z

**Summary**: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has enabled new possibilities for applying artificial intelligence within the legal domain. Nonetheless, the complexity, hierarchical organization, and frequent revisions of Vietnamese legislation pose considerable challenges for evaluating how well these models interpret and utilize legal knowledge. To address this gap, Vietnamese Legal Benchmark (VLegal-Bench) is introduced, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to systematically assess LLMs on Vietnamese legal tasks. Informed by Bloom's cognitive taxonomy, VLegal-Bench encompasses multiple levels of legal understanding through tasks designed to reflect practical usage scenarios. The benchmark comprises 10,450 samples generated through a rigorous annotation pipeline, where legal experts label and cross-validate each instance using our annotation system to ensure every sample is grounded in authoritative legal documents and mirrors real-world legal assistant workflows, including general legal questions and answers, retrieval-augmented generation, multi-step reasoning, and scenario-based problem solving tailored to Vietnamese law. By providing a standardized, transparent, and cognitively informed evaluation framework, VLegal-Bench establishes a solid foundation for assessing LLM performance in Vietnamese legal contexts and supports the development of more reliable, interpretable, and ethically aligned AI-assisted legal systems.

### Tensor Product Attention Is All You Need
**Authors**: Yifan Zhang, Yifeng Liu, Huizhuo Yuan, Zhen Qin, Yang Yuan, Quanquan Gu, Andrew Chi-Chih Yao

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T16:24:22Z

**Summary**: Scaling language models to handle longer input sequences typically necessitates large key-value (KV) caches, resulting in substantial memory overhead during inference. In this paper, we propose Tensor Product Attention (TPA), a novel attention mechanism that uses tensor decompositions to represent queries, keys, and values compactly, substantially shrinking the KV cache size at inference time. By factorizing these representations into contextual low-rank components and seamlessly integrating with Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE), TPA achieves improved model quality alongside memory efficiency. Based on TPA, we introduce the Tensor ProducT ATTenTion Transformer (T6), a new model architecture for sequence modeling. Through extensive empirical evaluation on language modeling tasks, we demonstrate that T6 surpasses or matches the performance of standard Transformer baselines including Multi-Head Attention (MHA), Multi-Query Attention (MQA), Grouped-Query Attention (GQA), and Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA) across various metrics, including perplexity and a range of established evaluation benchmarks. Notably, TPA's memory efficiency and computational efficiency at decoding stage enables processing longer sequences under fixed resource constraints, addressing a critical scalability challenge in modern language models.

### The Impact of Spectroscopic Redshift Errors on Cosmological Measurements
**Authors**: Shengyu He, Jiaxi Yu, Antoine Rocher, Daniel Forero-Sánchez, Jean-Paul Kneib, Cheng Zhao, Etienne Burtin, Jiamin Hou

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T16:21:04Z

**Summary**: Spectroscopic redshift errors, including redshift uncertainty and catastrophic failures, can bias cosmological measurements from galaxy redshift surveys at sub-percent level. In this work, we investigate their impact on the full-shape analysis using contaminated mock catalogs. We find that redshift uncertainty introduces a scale-dependent damping effect on the power spectrum, which is absorbed by counterterms in clustering model, keeping parameter biases below $5\%$. Catastrophic failures suppress the power spectrum amplitude by an approximately constant factor that scales with the catastrophic rate $f_c$. While this effect is negligible for DESI galaxy populations ($f_c=1\%$), the slitless-like errors, combining redshift uncertainty with $f_c=5\%$ catastrophics, introduce significant biases in cosmological constraints. In this case, we observe $6\%$ to $16\%$ shifts ($\sim2.2σ$ level) in estimating the fractional growth rate $df\equiv f/f^{\rm{fid}}$ and the log primordial amplitude $\ln(10^{10} A_{s})$. Applying the correction factor $(1-f_c)^2$ on the galaxy power spectrum mitigates the bias but weakens the parameter constraints due to new degeneracies. Alternatively, fixing $f_c$ to its expected value restores the constraining power with a modest bias of $1.0σ$. Our results indicate that for space-based slitless surveys such as \textit{Euclid}, at minimum accurate estimation of $f_c$ and its incorporation into the clustering model are essential to get unbiased cosmological inference. Extending to evolving dark energy and massive neutrino cosmologies, redshift errors do not bias the dark energy properties parametrized by $w_0$ and $w_a$, but can degrade constraints on the summed neutrino mass $\sum m_ν$ by up to 80% in the worst case.

### A Graph-Based Forensic Framework for Inferring Hardware Noise of Cloud Quantum Backend
**Authors**: Subrata Das, Archisman Ghosh, Swaroop Ghosh

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T16:17:04Z

**Summary**: Cloud quantum platforms give users access to many backends with different qubit technologies, coupling layouts, and noise levels. The execution of a circuit, however, depends on internal allocation and routing policies that are not observable to the user. A provider may redirect jobs to more error-prone regions to conserve resources, balance load or for other opaque reasons, causing degradation in fidelity while still presenting stale or averaged calibration data. This lack of transparency creates a security gap: users cannot verify whether their circuits were executed on the hardware for which they were charged. Forensic methods that infer backend behavior from user-visible artifacts are therefore becoming essential. In this work, we introduce a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based forensic framework that predicts per-qubit and per-qubit link error rates of an unseen backend using only topology information and aggregated features extracted from transpiled circuits. We construct a dataset from several IBM 27-qubit devices, merge static calibration features with dynamic transpilation features and train separate GNN regressors for one- and two-qubit errors. At inference time, the model operates without access to calibration data from the target backend and reconstructs a complete error map from the features available to the user. Our results on the target backend show accurate recovery of backend error rate, with an average mismatch of approximately 22% for single-qubit errors and 18% for qubit-link errors. The model also exhibits strong ranking agreement, with the ordering induced by predicted error values closely matching that of the actual calibration errors, as reflected by high Spearman correlation. The framework consistently identifies weak links and high-noise qubits and remains robust under realistic temporal noise drift.

### CAPRMIL: Context-Aware Patch Representations for Multiple Instance Learning
**Authors**: Andreas Lolos, Theofilos Christodoulou, Aris L. Moustakas, Stergios Christodoulidis, Maria Vakalopoulou

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T16:16:45Z

**Summary**: In computational pathology, weak supervision has become the standard for deep learning due to the gigapixel scale of WSIs and the scarcity of pixel-level annotations, with Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) established as the principal framework for slide-level model training. In this paper, we introduce a novel setting for MIL methods, inspired by proceedings in Neural Partial Differential Equation (PDE) Solvers. Instead of relying on complex attention-based aggregation, we propose an efficient, aggregator-agnostic framework that removes the complexity of correlation learning from the MIL aggregator. CAPRMIL produces rich context-aware patch embeddings that promote effective correlation learning on downstream tasks. By projecting patch features -- extracted using a frozen patch encoder -- into a small set of global context/morphology-aware tokens and utilizing multi-head self-attention, CAPRMIL injects global context with linear computational complexity with respect to the bag size. Paired with a simple Mean MIL aggregator, CAPRMIL matches state-of-the-art slide-level performance across multiple public pathology benchmarks, while reducing the total number of trainable parameters by 48%-92.8% versus SOTA MILs, lowering FLOPs during inference by 52%-99%, and ranking among the best models on GPU memory efficiency and training time. Our results indicate that learning rich, context-aware instance representations before aggregation is an effective and scalable alternative to complex pooling for whole-slide analysis.

### Neural-Network Closures for Complex-Shaped Particles in the Force-Coupling Method
**Authors**: Marco Laudato

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T16:09:35Z

**Summary**: A data-driven surrogate framework to accelerate particle-resolved modelling of quasi-dilute suspensions of rigid, non-spherical particles in Stokes flow is introduced. A regularized-Stokeslet boundary element method (BEM) is implemented to compute hydrodynamic responses in canonical linear flows, focusing on the particle stresslet and angular velocity for spheroids, and additionally the chiral thrust for helicoidal particles. For spheroids, the BEM solver is validated against available analytical benchmarks (Faxen-type relations for the stresslet and Jeffery's theory for rotation), and parameter choices for surface discretization and regularization are selected through systematic convergence studies. For helicoidal particles, where no analytical solutions exist, accuracy is quantified via Richardson-style self-convergence, complemented by tests of linearity, frame objectivity, and chirality-dependent symmetries. The resulting datasets are used to train a neural-operator surrogate that maps local flow descriptors and particle configuration to the corresponding stresslet, rotation, and thrust at negligible evaluation cost. Across independent test sets spanning random orientations and flow types, the surrogate achieves median relative errors below 1% for the deviatoric stresslet (95th percentile below 3%) and comparable accuracy for angular velocity and thrust. The combination of validated BEM generation and fast inference provides a practical route to coupling complex particle shapes into mesoscale solvers such as the force-coupling method, enabling large-ensemble studies of microstructure and suspension rheology.

### VersatileFFN: Achieving Parameter Efficiency in LLMs via Adaptive Wide-and-Deep Reuse
**Authors**: Ying Nie, Kai Han, Hongguang Li, Hang Zhou, Tianyu Guo, Enhua Wu, Xinghao Chen, Yunhe Wang

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T16:08:23Z

**Summary**: The rapid scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs) has achieved remarkable performance, but it also leads to prohibitive memory costs. Existing parameter-efficient approaches such as pruning and quantization mainly compress pretrained models without enhancing architectural capacity, thereby hitting the representational ceiling of the base model. In this work, we propose VersatileFFN, a novel feed-forward network (FFN) that enables flexible reuse of parameters in both width and depth dimensions within a fixed parameter budget. Inspired by the dual-process theory of cognition, VersatileFFN comprises two adaptive pathways: a width-versatile path that generates a mixture of sub-experts from a single shared FFN, mimicking sparse expert routing without increasing parameters, and a depth-versatile path that recursively applies the same FFN to emulate deeper processing for complex tokens. A difficulty-aware gating dynamically balances the two pathways, steering "easy" tokens through the efficient width-wise route and allocating deeper iterative refinement to "hard" tokens. Crucially, both pathways reuse the same parameters, so all additional capacity comes from computation rather than memory. Experiments across diverse benchmarks and model scales demonstrate the effectiveness of the method. The code will be available at https://github.com/huawei-noah/noah-research/tree/master/VersatileFFN.

### Non-Resolution Reasoning (NRR): A Computational Framework for Contextual Identity and Ambiguity Preservation
**Authors**: Kei Saito

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T16:05:40Z

**Summary**: Current artificial intelligence systems, despite remarkable capabilities in text generation and pattern recognition, exhibit a fundamental architectural limitation: they resolve ambiguity prematurely. This premature semantic collapse -- the tendency to collapse multiple valid interpretations into a single output -- stems from classical identity assumptions embedded in standard neural architectures. We propose Non-Resolution Reasoning (NRR), a computational framework that treats ambiguity retention as a valid reasoning mode rather than a defect to be eliminated. NRR introduces three core principles: (1) Non-Identity (A $\ne$ A) -- the same symbol refers to different entities across contexts; (2) Approximate Identity (A $\approx$ A) -- entities share partial structural overlap without being identical; and (3) Non-Resolution -- conflicting interpretations can coexist without forced convergence. We formalize these principles through three architectural components: Multi-Vector Embeddings for context-dependent representation, Non-Collapsing Attention for parallel interpretation retention, and Contextual Identity Tracking (CIT) for maintaining A $\ne$ A across inference. We demonstrate NRR's advantages through case studies in paradox handling, creative generation, and context-dependent reasoning. Crucially, we provide a minimal empirical validation on a synthetic context-shift task where an NRR-lite model achieves 90.9% out-of-distribution accuracy compared to 9.1% for standard architectures, demonstrating that ambiguity preservation enables structural generalization. NRR challenges the assumption that meaning must collapse to be useful, offering a foundation for AI systems capable of sophisticated ambiguity handling and creative reasoning. The question is not whether AI should resolve ambiguity, but when, how, and under whose control.

### Dynamic Learning Rate Scheduling based on Loss Changes Leads to Faster Convergence
**Authors**: Shreyas Subramanian, Bala Krishnamoorthy, Pranav Murthy

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T16:03:52Z

**Summary**: Despite significant advances in optimizers for training, most research works use common scheduler choices like Cosine or exponential decay. In this paper, we study \emph{GreedyLR}, a novel scheduler that adaptively adjusts the learning rate during training based on the current loss. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed scheduler, we conduct experiments on several NLP, CV, and LLM tasks with up to $7B$ parameters, including both fine-tuning and pre-training experiments. The results show that our approach outperforms several state-of-the-art schedulers in terms of accuracy, speed, and convergence. We also provide a theoretical analysis of the GreedyLR algorithm, including a proof of convergence and derivation of the optimal scaling factor $F$ that maximizes the convergence rate, along with experiments to show robustness of the algorithm to realistic noisy landscapes. Our scheduler is easy to implement, computationally efficient, and could be considered a good default scheduler for training.

### Exploring Network-Knowledge Graph Duality: A Case Study in Agentic Supply Chain Risk Analysis
**Authors**: Evan Heus, Rick Bookstaber, Dhruv Sharma

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T15:50:12Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with the complex, multi-modal, and network-native data underlying financial risk. Standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) oversimplifies relationships, while specialist models are costly and static. We address this gap with an LLM-centric agent framework for supply chain risk analysis. Our core contribution is to exploit the inherent duality between networks and knowledge graphs (KG). We treat the supply chain network as a KG, allowing us to use structural network science principles for retrieval. A graph traverser, guided by network centrality scores, efficiently extracts the most economically salient risk paths. An agentic architecture orchestrates this graph retrieval alongside data from numerical factor tables and news streams. Crucially, it employs novel ``context shells'' -- descriptive templates that embed raw figures in natural language -- to make quantitative data fully intelligible to the LLM. This lightweight approach enables the model to generate concise, explainable, and context-rich risk narratives in real-time without costly fine-tuning or a dedicated graph database.

### Detection of CO$_2$, CO, and H$_2$O in the atmosphere of the warm sub-Saturn HAT-P-12b

Ray, E. F. van Dishoeck

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T15:48:08Z

**Summary**: The chemical composition of warm gas giant exoplanet atmospheres (with Teq < 1000 K) is not well known due to the lack of observational constraints. HAT-P-12 b is a warm, sub-Saturn-mass transiting exoplanet that is ideal for transmission spectroscopy. One transit of HAT-P-12 b was observed with JWST NIRSpec in the 2.87--5.10 $μ$m range with a resolving power of $\sim$1000. The JWST data are combined with archival observations from HST WFC3 covering the 1.1--1.7 $μ$m range. The data were analysed using two data reduction pipelines and two atmospheric retrieval tools. Atmospheric simulations using chemical forward models were performed. CO2, CO, and H2O are detected at 12.2, 4.1, and 6.0 $σ$ confidence, respectively. Their volume mixing ratios are consistent with an atmosphere of $\sim10\times$ solar metallicity and production of CO2 by photochemistry. CH4 is not detected and seems to be lacking, which could be due to a high intrinsic temperature with strong vertical mixing or other phenomena. SO2 is also not detected and its production seems limited by low upper atmosphere temperatures ($\sim$500 K at $P<10^{-3}$ bar derived from one-dimensional retrievals), insufficient to produce it in detectable quantities ($\gtrsim$ 800 K required according to photochemical models). Retrievals indicate the presence of clouds between 2 and 269 mbar. This study points towards an atmosphere for HAT-P-12 b that could be enriched in carbon and oxygen with respect to its host star. When including the production of CO2 via photochemistry, an atmospheric metallicity that is close to Saturn's can explain the observations. Metallicities inferred for other gas giant exoplanets based on their CO2 mixing ratios may need to account for its photochemical production pathways. This may impact studies on mass-metallicity trends and links between exoplanet atmospheres, interiors, and formation history.

### RepoTransBench: A Real-World Multilingual Benchmark for Repository-Level Code Translation
**Authors**: Yanli Wang, Yanlin Wang, Suiquan Wang, Daya Guo, Jiachi Chen, John Grundy, Xilin Liu, Yuchi Ma, Mingzhi Mao, Hongyu Zhang, Zibin Zheng

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T15:45:13Z

**Summary**: Repository-level code translation refers to translating an entire code repository from one programming language to another while preserving the functionality of the source repository. Many benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate the performance of such code translators. However, previous benchmarks mostly provide fine-grained samples, focusing at either code snippet, function, or file-level code translation. Such benchmarks do not accurately reflect real-world demands, where entire repositories often need to be translated, involving longer code length and more complex functionalities. To address this gap, we propose a new benchmark, named RepoTransBench, which is a real-world multilingual repository-level code translation benchmark featuring 1,897 real-world repository samples across 13 language pairs with automatically executable test suites. Besides, we introduce RepoTransAgent, a general agent framework to perform repository-level code translation. We evaluate both our benchmark's challenges and agent's effectiveness using several methods and backbone LLMs, revealing that repository-level translation remains challenging, where the best-performing method achieves only a 32.8% success rate. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that translation difficulty varies significantly by language pair direction, with dynamic-to-static language translation being much more challenging than the reverse direction (achieving below 10% vs. static-to-dynamic at 45-63%). Finally, we conduct a detailed error analysis and highlight current LLMs' deficiencies in repository-level code translation, which could provide a reference for further improvements. We provide the code and data at https://github.com/DeepSoftwareAnalytics/RepoTransBench.

### Linguists should learn to love speech-based deep learning models

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T15:42:22Z

**Summary**: Futrell and Mahowald present a useful framework bridging technology-oriented deep learning systems and explanation-oriented linguistic theories. Unfortunately, the target article's focus on generative text-based LLMs fundamentally limits fruitful interactions with linguistics, as many interesting questions on human language fall outside what is captured by written text. We argue that audio-based deep learning models can and should play a crucial role.

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T15:40:44Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in transforming recommender systems from implicit behavioral pattern matching to explicit intent reasoning. While RecGPT-V1 successfully pioneered this paradigm by integrating LLM-based reasoning into user interest mining and item tag prediction, it suffers from four fundamental limitations: (1) computational inefficiency and cognitive redundancy across multiple reasoning routes; (2) insufficient explanation diversity in fixed-template generation; (3) limited generalization under supervised learning paradigms; and (4) simplistic outcome-focused evaluation that fails to match human standards.   To address these challenges, we present RecGPT-V2 with four key innovations. First, a Hierarchical Multi-Agent System restructures intent reasoning through coordinated collaboration, eliminating cognitive duplication while enabling diverse intent coverage. Combined with Hybrid Representation Inference that compresses user-behavior contexts, our framework reduces GPU consumption by 60% and improves exclusive recall from 9.39% to 10.99%. Second, a Meta-Prompting framework dynamically generates contextually adaptive prompts, improving explanation diversity by +7.3%. Third, constrained reinforcement learning mitigates multi-reward conflicts, achieving +24.1% improvement in tag prediction and +13.0% in explanation acceptance. Fourth, an Agent-as-a-Judge framework decomposes assessment into multi-step reasoning, improving human preference alignment.

**Authors**: Teodor Poncu, Ioana Pintilie, Marius Dragoi, Dragos Tantaru, Florin Brad

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T15:36:29Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) typically excel at coding tasks involving high-level programming languages, as opposed to lower-level programming languages, such as assembly. We propose a synthetic data generation method named C-ing Clearly, which leverages the corresponding C code to enhance an LLM's understanding of assembly. By fine-tuning on data generated through our method, we demonstrate improved LLM performance for binary code summarization and vulnerability detection. Our approach demonstrates consistent gains across different LLM families and model sizes.

### Decision-making with possibilistic inferential models
**Authors**: Ryan Martin, Shih-Ni Prim, Jonathan Williams

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T15:33:57Z

**Summary**: Inferential models (IMs) are data-dependent, imprecise-probabilistic structures designed to quantify uncertainty about unknowns. As the name suggests, the focus has been on uncertainty quantification for inference and on its reliability properties in that context. Focusing on a likelihood-based possibilistic IM formulation, the present paper develops a corresponding framework for decision making, and investigates the decision-theoretic implications of the IM's reliability guarantees. Here we show that the possibilistic IM's assessment of an action's quality, defined by a simple Choquet integral, tends not be too optimistic compared to that of an oracle. This ensures that the IM tends not to favor actions that the oracle doesn't also favor, hence the IM is also reliable for decision making. We also establish a complementary, large-sample efficiency result that says the IM's reliability isn't achieved by being grossly conservative. In the special case of equivariant statistical models, further connections can be made between the IM's and Bayesian's recommended actions, from which certain optimality conclusions can be drawn.

### BridgeNet: A Dataset of Graph-based Bridge Structural Models for Machine Learning Applications
**Authors**: Lazlo Bleker, Mustafa Cem Güneş, Pierluigi D'Acunto

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T15:30:06Z

**Summary**: Machine learning (ML) is increasingly used in structural engineering and design, yet its broader adoption is hampered by the lack of openly accessible datasets of structural systems. We introduce BridgeNet, a publicly available graph-based dataset of 20,000 form-found bridge structures aimed at enabling Graph ML and multi-modal learning in the context of conceptual structural design. Each datapoint consists of (i) a pin-jointed equilibrium wireframe model generated with the Combinatorial Equilibrium Modeling (CEM) form-finding method, (ii) a volumetric 3D mesh obtained through force-informed materialization, and (iii) rendered images from two canonical camera angles. The resulting dataset is modality-rich and application-agnostic, supporting tasks such as CEM-specific edge classification and parameter inference, surrogate modeling of form-finding, cross-modal reconstruction between graphs, meshes and images, and generative structural design. BridgeNet addresses a key bottleneck in data-driven applications for structural engineering and design by providing a dataset that facilitates the development of new ML-based approaches for equilibrium bridge structures.

### Causal Secondary Analysis of Linked Data in the Presence of Mismatch Error
**Authors**: Martin Slawski

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T15:25:08Z

**Summary**: The increased prevalence of observational data and the need to integrate information from multiple sources are critical challenges in contemporary data analysis. Record linkage is a widely used tool for combining datasets in the absence of unique identifiers. The presence of linkage errors such as mismatched records, however, often hampers the analysis of data sets obtained in this way. This issue is more difficult to address in secondary analysis settings, where linkage and subsequent analysis are performed separately, and analysts have limited information about linkage quality. In this paper, we investigate the estimation of average treatment effects in the conventional potential outcome-based causal inference framework under linkage uncertainty. To mitigate the bias that would be incurred with naive analyses, we propose an approach based on estimating equations that treats the unknown match status indicators as missing data. Leveraging a variant of the Expectation-Maximization algorithm, these indicators are imputed based on a corresponding two-component mixture model. The approach is amenable to asymptotic inference. Simulation studies and a case study highlight the importance of accounting for linkage uncertainty and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

### PushGen: Push Notifications Generation with LLM
**Authors**: Shifu Bie, Jiangxia Cao, Zixiao Luo, Yichuan Zou, Lei Liang, Lu Zhang, Linxun Chen, Zhaojie Liu, Xuanping Li, Guorui Zhou, Kaiqiao Zhan, Kun Gai

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T15:23:28Z

**Summary**: We present PushGen, an automated framework for generating high-quality push notifications comparable to human-crafted content. With the rise of generative models, there is growing interest in leveraging LLMs for push content generation. Although LLMs make content generation straightforward and cost-effective, maintaining stylistic control and reliable quality assessment remains challenging, as both directly impact user engagement. To address these issues, PushGen combines two key components: (1) a controllable category prompt technique to guide LLM outputs toward desired styles, and (2) a reward model that ranks and selects generated candidates. Extensive offline and online experiments demonstrate its effectiveness, which has been deployed in large-scale industrial applications, serving hundreds of millions of users daily.

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T15:17:11Z

**Summary**: We present deep ALMA Band 7 observations of the [OIII] $88μ$m line and underlying dust continuum emission in four UV-bright, gravitationally lensed (magnification $μ= 1.4-3.8$), JWST-selected galaxies at $z = 8.5 - 10.3$, with observed magnitudes $-22.5 \lesssim M_\mathrm{UV} \lesssim -20.5$. [OIII] $88μ$m is confidently detected in UNCOVER-10646 at $z=8.5080 \pm 0.0011$ ($15σ$) and DHZ1 at $z=9.3113 \pm 0.0005$ ($6σ$), with both being intrinsically luminous systems [$L_\mathrm{[OIII]} = (1.1 - 1.6) \times 10^9$ $L_\odot$] that follow the local [OIII]-SFR relation. [OIII] $88μ$m remains undetected in the two $z>10$ targets, including in the $z=10.07$ X-ray AGN UHZ1, where we obtain a deep limit of $L_\mathrm{[OIII]} < 6 \times 10^7$ $L_\odot$. Dust emission is not detected in any individual source nor in a stack ($<3σ$). The high S/N [OIII] $88μ$m detection in UNCOVER-10646 uniquely reveals an additional broad component ($\mathrm{FWHM} = 1366_{-329}^{+473}$ $\mathrm{km/s}$; $Δ\mathrm{BIC}\approx20$) indicative of an ionized outflow. We infer a high outflow rate of $\dot{M}_\mathrm{out} = 128_{-46}^{+80}$ $M_\odot\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$, corresponding to a mass loading factor $η= \dot{M}_\mathrm{out}/\mathrm{SFR} = 2.9_{-1.0}^{+1.8}$ that is broadly consistent with theoretical predictions and JWST-based studies of ionized outflows at high redshift. While high-resolution ALMA follow-up is required to confirm the outflow, this first systematic study at $z>8$ highlights the unique diagnostic power of [OIII] $88μ$m in characterizing galaxies in the early Universe.

### Anomalous shift in scattering from topological nodal-ring semimetals
**Authors**: Runze Li, Chaoxi Cui, Ying Liu, Zhi-Ming Yu, Shengyuan A. Yang

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T15:15:22Z

**Summary**: An electron beam may experience an anomalous spatial shift during an interface scattering process. Here, we investigate this phenomenon for reflection from mirror-symmetry-protected nodal-ring semimetals, which are characterized by an integer topological charge $χ_h$. We show that the shift is generally enhanced by the presence of nodal rings, and the ring's geometry can be inferred from the profile of shift vectors in the interface momentum plane. Importantly, the anomalous shift encodes the topological information of the ring, where the circulation of the shift vector field $κ_s$ over a semicircle is governed by the topological charge, with a simple relationship: $κ_s=-2πχ_h$. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the shift and its circulation reflect distinct features of topological phase transitions of the charged rings. This study uncovers a novel physical signature of topological nodal rings and positions anomalous scattering shifts as a powerful tool for probing topological band structures.

### SASQ: Static Activation Scaling for Quantization-Aware Training in Large Language Models
**Authors**: Shizhuo Mao, Song Chen, Yi Kang

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T15:12:34Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) excel at natural language tasks but face deployment challenges due to their growing size outpacing GPU memory advancements. Model quantization mitigates this issue by lowering weight and activation precision, but existing solutions face fundamental trade-offs: dynamic quantization incurs high computational overhead and poses deployment challenges on edge devices, while static quantization sacrifices accuracy. Existing approaches of quantization-aware training (QAT) further suffer from weight training costs. We propose SASQ: a lightweight QAT framework specifically tailored for activation quantization factors. SASQ exclusively optimizes only the quantization factors (without changing pre-trained weights), enabling static inference with high accuracy while maintaining deployment efficiency. SASQ adaptively truncates some outliers, thereby reducing the difficulty of quantization while preserving the distributional characteristics of the activations. SASQ not only surpasses existing SOTA quantization schemes but also outperforms the corresponding FP16 models. On LLaMA2-7B, it achieves 5.2% lower perplexity than QuaRot and 4.7% lower perplexity than the FP16 model on WikiText2.

### Model-First Reasoning LLM Agents: Reducing Hallucinations through Explicit Problem Modeling
**Authors**: Annu Rana, Gaurav Kumar

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T15:07:36Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with complex multi-step planning tasks, showing high rates of constraint violations and inconsistent solutions. Existing strategies such as Chain-of-Thought and ReAct rely on implicit state tracking and lack an explicit problem representation. Inspired by classical AI planning, we propose Model-First Reasoning (MFR), a two-phase paradigm in which the LLM first constructs an explicit model of the problem, defining entities, state variables, actions, and constraints, before generating a solution plan. Across multiple planning domains, including medical scheduling, route planning, resource allocation, logic puzzles, and procedural synthesis, MFR reduces constraint violations and improves solution quality compared to Chain-of-Thought and ReAct. Ablation studies show that the explicit modeling phase is critical for these gains. Our results suggest that many LLM planning failures stem from representational deficiencies rather than reasoning limitations, highlighting explicit modeling as a key component for robust and interpretable AI agents. All prompts, evaluation procedures, and task datasets are documented to facilitate reproducibility.

### CMB delensing with deep learning
**Authors**: Shulei Ni, Yichao Li, Xin Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T14:58:06Z

**Summary**: The cosmic microwave background (CMB) stands as a pivotal source for studying weak gravitational lensing. While the lensed CMB aids in constraining cosmological parameters, it simultaneously smooths the original CMB's features. The angular power spectrum of the unlensed CMB showcases sharper acoustic peaks and more pronounced damping tails, enhancing the precision of inferring cosmological parameters that influence these aspects. Although delensing diminishes the $B$-mode power spectrum, it facilitates the pursuit of primordial gravitational waves and enables a lower variance reconstruction of lensing and additional sources of secondary CMB anisotropies. In this work, we explore the potential of deep learning techniques, specifically the U-Net++ algorithm, to play a pivotal role in CMB delensing. We analyze three fields, namely $T$, $Q$, and $U$ sky maps, present the angular power spectra of the CMB delensed $TT$, $EE$, $BB$, and $TE$, and compare them with the unlensed CMB angular power spectra. Our findings reveal that the angular power spectrum of the lensed CMB, processed by U-Net++, closely aligns with that of the unlensed CMB. Thus, U-Net++ based CMB delensing proves to be effective in mitigating the impacts of weak gravitational lensing, paving the way for enhancing the CMB delensing power spectrum in forthcoming CMB experiments. The code utilized for this analysis is available on GitHub.

### Inference on the attractor spaces via functional approximation
**Authors**: Massimo Franchi, Paolo Paruolo

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T14:37:50Z

**Summary**: This paper discusses semiparametric inference on hypotheses on the cointegration and the attractor spaces for $I(1)$ linear processes with moderately large cross-sectional dimension. The approach is based on empirical canonical correlations and functional approximation of Brownian motions, and it can be applied both to the whole system and or to any set of linear combinations of it. The hypotheses of interest are cast in terms of the number of stochastic trends in specified subsystems, and inference is based either on selection criteria or on sequences of tests. This paper derives the limit distribution of these tests in the special one-dimensional case, and discusses asymptotic properties of the derived inference criteria for hypotheses on the attractor space for sequentially diverging sample size and number of basis elements in the functional approximation. Finite sample properties are analyzed via a Monte Carlo study and an empirical illustration on exchange rates is provided.

### Immutable Explainability: Fuzzy Logic and Blockchain for Verifiable Affective AI
**Authors**: Marcelo Fransoy, Alejandro Hossian, Hernán Merlino

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T14:36:24Z

**Summary**: Affective artificial intelligence has made substantial advances in recent years; yet two critical issues persist, particularly in sensitive applications. First, these systems frequently operate as 'black boxes', leaving their decision-making processes opaque. Second, audit logs often lack reliability, as the entity operating the system may alter them. In this work, we introduce the concept of Immutable Explainability, an architecture designed to address both challenges simultaneously. Our approach combines an interpretable inference engine - implemented through fuzzy logic to produce a transparent trace of each decision - with a cryptographic anchoring mechanism that records this trace on a blockchain, ensuring that it is tamper-evident and independently verifiable. To validate the approach, we implemented a heuristic pipeline integrating lexical and prosodic analysis within an explicit Mamdani-type multimodal fusion engine. Each inference generates an auditable record that is subsequently anchored on a public blockchain (Sepolia Testnet). We evaluated the system using the Spanish MEACorpus 2023, employing both the original corpus transcriptions and those generated by Whisper. The results show that our fuzzy-fusion approach outperforms baseline methods (linear and unimodal fusion). Beyond these quantitative outcomes, our primary objective is to establish a foundation for affective AI systems that offer transparent explanations, trustworthy audit trails, and greater user control over personal data.

### Reasoning-Style Poisoning of LLM Agents via Stealthy Style Transfer: Process-Level Attacks and Runtime Monitoring in RSV Space
**Authors**: Xingfu Zhou, Pengfei Wang

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T14:34:10Z

**Summary**: Large Language Model (LLM) agents relying on external retrieval are increasingly deployed in high-stakes environments. While existing adversarial attacks primarily focus on content falsification or instruction injection, we identify a novel, process-oriented attack surface: the agent's reasoning style. We propose Reasoning-Style Poisoning (RSP), a paradigm that manipulates how agents process information rather than what they process. We introduce Generative Style Injection (GSI), an attack method that rewrites retrieved documents into pathological tones--specifically "analysis paralysis" or "cognitive haste"--without altering underlying facts or using explicit triggers. To quantify these shifts, we develop the Reasoning Style Vector (RSV), a metric tracking Verification depth, Self-confidence, and Attention focus. Experiments on HotpotQA and FEVER using ReAct, Reflection, and Tree of Thoughts (ToT) architectures reveal that GSI significantly degrades performance. It increases reasoning steps by up to 4.4 times or induces premature errors, successfully bypassing state-of-the-art content filters. Finally, we propose RSP-M, a lightweight runtime monitor that calculates RSV metrics in real-time and triggers alerts when values exceed safety thresholds. Our work demonstrates that reasoning style is a distinct, exploitable vulnerability, necessitating process-level defenses beyond static content analysis.

### Seismology modeling agent: A smart assistant for geophysical researchers
**Authors**: Yukun Ren, Siwei Yu, Kai Chen, Jianwei Ma

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T14:18:26Z

**Summary**: To address the steep learning curve and reliance on complex manual file editing and command-line operations in the traditional workflow of the mainstream open-source seismic wave simulation software SPECFEM, this paper proposes an intelligent, interactive workflow powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). We introduce the first Model Context Protocol (MCP) server suite for SPECFEM (supporting 2D, 3D Cartesian, and 3D Globe versions), which decomposes the entire simulation process into discrete, agent-executable tools spanning from parameter generation and mesh partitioning to solver execution and visualization. This approach enables a paradigm shift from file-driven to intent-driven conversational interactions. The framework supports both fully automated execution and human-in-the-loop collaboration, allowing researchers to guide simulation strategies in real time and retain scientific decision-making authority while significantly reducing tedious low-level operations. Validated through multiple case studies, the workflow operates seamlessly in both autonomous and interactive modes, yielding high-fidelity results consistent with standard baselines. As the first application of MCP technology to computational seismology, this study significantly lowers the entry barrier, enhances reproducibility, and offers a promising avenue for advancing computational geophysics toward AI-assisted and automated scientific research. The complete source code is available at https://github.com/RenYukun1563/specfem-mcp.

### Effect of Document Packing on the Latent Multi-Hop Reasoning Capabilities of Large Language Models
**Authors**: Gabriele Prato, Shagun Sodhani, Alessandro Sordoni, Sarath Chandar

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T14:16:23Z

**Summary**: The standard practice for training large language models involves packing multiple documents together to optimize computational efficiency. However, the impact of this process on the models' capabilities remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we investigate how different document-packing strategies influence the latent multi-hop reasoning abilities of LLMs. Our findings indicate that packing can improve model performance compared to training on individual documents, at the expense of more compute. To further understand the underlying mechanisms, we conduct an ablation study, identifying key factors that explain the advantages of packing. Ultimately, our research deepens the understanding of LLM training dynamics and provides practical insights for optimizing model development.

### TempoPFN: Synthetic Pre-training of Linear RNNs for Zero-shot Time Series Forecasting
**Authors**: Vladyslav Moroshan, Julien Siems, Arber Zela, Timur Carstensen, Frank Hutter

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T14:12:31Z

**Summary**: Foundation models for zero-shot time series forecasting face challenges in efficient long-horizon prediction and reproducibility, with existing synthetic-only approaches underperforming on challenging benchmarks. This paper presents TempoPFN, a univariate time series foundation model based on linear Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) pre-trained exclusively on synthetic data. The model uses a GatedDeltaProduct architecture with state-weaving for fully parallelizable training across sequence lengths, eliminating the need for windowing or summarization techniques while maintaining robust temporal state-tracking. Our comprehensive synthetic data pipeline unifies diverse generators, including stochastic differential equations, Gaussian processes, and audio synthesis, with novel augmentations. In zero-shot evaluations on the Gift-Eval, fev-bench and Chronos-ZS benchmarks, TempoPFN achieves top-tier competitive performance, outperforming all existing synthetic-only approaches and surpassing the majority of models trained on real-world data, while being more efficient than existing baselines by leveraging fully parallelizable training and inference. We open-source our complete data generation pipeline and training code, providing a reproducible foundation for future research.

### MSTN: Fast and Efficient Multivariate Time Series Prediction Model
**Authors**: Sumit S Shevtekar, Chandresh K Maurya

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T14:06:33Z

**Summary**: Real-world time series often exhibit strong non-stationarity, complex nonlinear dynamics, and behaviour expressed across multiple temporal scales, from rapid local fluctuations to slow-evolving long-range trends. However, many contemporary architectures impose rigid, fixed-scale structural priors -- such as patch-based tokenization, predefined receptive fields, or frozen backbone encoders -- which can over-regularize temporal dynamics and limit adaptability to abrupt high-magnitude events. To handle this, we introduce the \emph{Multi-scale Temporal Network} (MSTN), a hybrid neural architecture grounded in an \emph{Early Temporal Aggregation} principle. MSTN integrates three complementary components: (i) a multi-scale convolutional encoder that captures fine-grained local structure; (ii) a sequence modeling module that learns long-range dependencies through either recurrent or attention-based mechanisms; and (iii) a self-gated fusion stage incorporating squeeze-excitation and multi-head attention to dynamically modulate cross-scale representations. This design enables MSTN to flexibly model temporal patterns spanning milliseconds to extended horizons, while avoiding the computational burden typically associated with long-context models. Across extensive benchmarks covering forecasting, imputation, classification, and cross-dataset generalization, MSTN consistently delivers state-of-the-art performance, outperforming recent leading approaches including TIME-LLM, HiMTM, SOFTS, LLM4TS, TimesNet, and PatchTST, and establishing new best results on 24 out of 32 datasets. Despite its strong performance, MSTN remains lightweight and supports fast inference, making it well suited for deployment on edge devices and resource-constrained environments.

### PortAgent: LLM-driven Vehicle Dispatching Agent for Port Terminals
**Authors**: Jia Hu, Junqi Li, Weimeng Lin, Peng Jia, Yuxiong Ji, Jintao Lai

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T14:04:50Z

**Summary**: Vehicle Dispatching Systems (VDSs) are critical to the operational efficiency of Automated Container Terminals (ACTs). However, their widespread commercialization is hindered due to their low transferability across diverse terminals. This transferability challenge stems from three limitations: high reliance on port operational specialists, a high demand for terminal-specific data, and time-consuming manual deployment processes. Leveraging the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs), this paper proposes PortAgent, an LLM-driven vehicle dispatching agent that fully automates the VDS transferring workflow. It bears three features: (1) no need for port operations specialists; (2) low need of data; and (3) fast deployment. Specifically, specialist dependency is eliminated by the Virtual Expert Team (VET). The VET collaborates with four virtual experts, including a Knowledge Retriever, Modeler, Coder, and Debugger, to emulate a human expert team for the VDS transferring workflow. These experts specialize in the domain of terminal VDS via a few-shot example learning approach. Through this approach, the experts are able to learn VDS-domain knowledge from a few VDS examples. These examples are retrieved via a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mechanism, mitigating the high demand for terminal-specific data. Furthermore, an automatic VDS design workflow is established among these experts to avoid extra manual interventions. In this workflow, a self-correction loop inspired by the LLM Reflexion framework is created

### Training Multi-Image Vision Agents via End2End Reinforcement Learning
**Authors**: Chengqi Dong, Chuhuai Yue, Hang He, Rongge Mao, Fenghe Tang, S Kevin Zhou, Zekun Xu, Xiaohan Wang, Jiajun Chai, Wei Lin, Guojun Yin

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T14:00:19Z

**Summary**: Recent VLM-based agents aim to replicate OpenAI O3's ``thinking with images" via tool use, but most open-source methods limit input to a single image, falling short on real-world multi-image QA tasks. To address this, we propose IMAgent, an open-source vision agent trained via end-to-end reinforcement learning dedicated for complex multi-image tasks. By leveraging a multi-agent system, we generate challenging and visually-rich multi-image QA pairs to fully activate the tool-use potential of the base VLM. Through manual verification, we obtain MIFG-QA, comprising 10k samples for training and evaluation. With deeper reasoning steps, VLMs may increasingly ignore visual inputs. We therefore develop two specialized tools for visual reflection and confirmation, allowing the model to proactively reallocate its attention to image content during inference. Benefiting from our well-designed action-trajectory two-level mask strategy, IMAgent achieves stable tool use behavior via pure RL training without requiring costly supervised fine-tuning data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IMAgent maintains strong performance on existing single-image benchmarks while achieving substantial improvements on our proposed multi-image dataset, with our analysis providing actionable insights for the research community. Codes and data will be released soon.

### Bar ages derived for the first time in nearby galaxies: Insights on secular evolution from the TIMER sample

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T13:56:09Z

**Summary**: Once galaxies settle their discs and become self-gravitating, stellar bars can form, driving the subsequent evolution of their host galaxy. Determining the ages of bars can therefore shed light on the epoch of the onset of secular evolution. In this work, we apply the first broadly applicable methodology to derive bar ages to a sample of 20 nearby galaxies. The method is based on the co-eval build-up of nuclear structures and bars and involves using IFS data from the MUSE instrument on VLT to disentangle the SFH of the nuclear disc from the background population. This allows us to derive the formation epoch of the nuclear disc and, thus, of the bar. We estimate the bar formation epoch of nearby galaxies - mostly from the TIMER survey-, creating the largest sample of galaxies with known bar ages to date. We find bar formation epochs between 1 and 13 Gyr ago, illustrating how disc-settling and bar formation are processes that first took place in the early Universe and are still taking place in some galaxies. We infer the bar fraction over cosmological time with our sample, finding remarkable agreement with that obtained from direct studies of galaxies at high redshifts. Additionally, for the first time, we can investigate secular evolution processes taking into account the ages of bars. Our results agree with the scenario in which bars aid the quenching of the host galaxy, with galaxies hosting older bars tending to be more "quenched". We also find that older bars tend to be longer, stronger, and host larger nuclear discs. Furthermore, we find evidence of the nuclear disc stellar mass build-up over time. On the other hand, we find no evidence of downsizing playing a role in bar formation, since we find that bar age is independent of galaxy stellar mass. With the means to estimate bar ages, we can begin to understand better when and how bars shape the observed properties of disc galaxies.

### Unsupervised Learning of Density Estimates with Topological Optimization
**Authors**: Sunia Tanweer, Firas A. Khasawneh

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T13:48:24Z

**Summary**: Kernel density estimation is a key component of a wide variety of algorithms in machine learning, Bayesian inference, stochastic dynamics and signal processing. However, the unsupervised density estimation technique requires tuning a crucial hyperparameter: the kernel bandwidth. The choice of bandwidth is critical as it controls the bias-variance trade-off by over- or under-smoothing the topological features. Topological data analysis provides methods to mathematically quantify topological characteristics, such as connected components, loops, voids et cetera, even in high dimensions where visualization of density estimates is impossible. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised learning approach using a topology-based loss function for the automated and unsupervised selection of the optimal bandwidth and benchmark it against classical techniques -- demonstrating its potential across different dimensions.

### Janus: Disaggregating Attention and Experts for Scalable MoE Inference
**Authors**: Zhexiang Zhang, Ye Wang, Xiangyu Wang, Yumiao Zhao, Jingzhe Jiang, Qizhen Weng, Shaohuai Shi, Yin Chen, Minchen Yu

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T13:46:33Z

**Summary**: Large Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model inference is challenging due to high resource demands and dynamic workloads. Existing solutions often deploy the entire model as a single monolithic unit, which applies a unified resource configuration to both attention and expert modules despite their different requirements, leading to limited scalability and resource inefficiency. In this paper, we propose Janus, a scalable MoE inference system that disaggregates attention and experts on separate GPU sub-clusters, enabling each module to be managed and scaled independently. Janus incorporates three key designs for efficient, disaggregated MoE inference. First, it proposes an adaptive two-phase communication scheme that exploits intra- and inter-node bandwidth hierarchies for low-latency data exchange. Second, motivated by the memory-bound nature of MoE modules, Janus introduces a lightweight scheduler and implements it as a GPU kernel to balance the number of activated experts across GPUs at minimal overhead, thereby reducing inference latency. Third, Janus performs fine-grained resource management to dynamically adjust expert placement and independently scale attention and MoE resources to improve overall efficiency. Evaluation shows Janus achieves up to 3.9 higher perGPU throughput than state-of-the-art systems while meeting per-token latency requirements.

### Massive Editing for Large Language Models Based on Dynamic Weight Generation
**Authors**: Wentao Wan, Qiqing Lao, Zhiwei Xie, Hefeng Wu, Runnan Lin, Liang Lin, Keze Wang

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T13:32:55Z

**Summary**: Knowledge Editing (KE) is a field that studies how to modify some knowledge in Large Language Models (LLMs) at a low cost (compared to pre-training). Currently, performing large-scale edits on LLMs while ensuring the Reliability, Generality, and Locality metrics of the edits remain a challenge. This paper proposes a Massive editing approach for LLMs based on dynamic weight Generation (MeG). Our MeG involves attaching a dynamic weight neuron to specific layers of the LLMs and using a diffusion model to conditionally generate the weights of this neuron based on the input query required for the knowledge. This allows the use of adding a single dynamic weight neuron to achieve the goal of large-scale knowledge editing. Experiments show that our MeG can significantly improve the performance of large-scale KE in terms of Reliability, Generality, and Locality metrics compared to existing knowledge editing methods, particularly with a high percentage point increase in the absolute value index for the Locality metric, demonstrating the advantages of our proposed method.

### RePo: Language Models with Context Re-Positioning
**Authors**: Huayang Li, Tianyu Zhao, Richard Sproat

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T13:30:30Z

**Summary**: In-context learning is fundamental to modern Large Language Models (LLMs); however, prevailing architectures impose a rigid and fixed contextual structure by assigning linear or constant positional indices. Drawing on Cognitive Load Theory (CLT), we argue that this uninformative structure increases extraneous cognitive load, consuming finite working memory capacity that should be allocated to deep reasoning and attention allocation. To address this, we propose RePo, a novel mechanism that reduces extraneous load via context re-positioning. Unlike standard approaches, RePo utilizes a differentiable module, $f_φ$, to assign token positions that capture contextual dependencies, rather than replying on pre-defined integer range. By continually pre-training on the OLMo-2 1B backbone, we demonstrate that RePo significantly enhances performance on tasks involving noisy contexts, structured data, and longer context length, while maintaining competitive performance on general short-context tasks. Detailed analysis reveals that RePo successfully allocate higher attention to distant but relevant information, assign positions in dense and non-linear space, and capture the intrinsic structure of the input context. Our code is available at https://github.com/SakanaAI/repo.

### HQ-DM: Single Hadamard Transformation-Based Quantization-Aware Training for Low-Bit Diffusion Models
**Authors**: Shizhuo Mao, Hongtao Zou, Qihu Xie, Song Chen, Yi Kang

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T13:29:08Z

**Summary**: Diffusion models have demonstrated significant applications in the field of image generation. However, their high computational and memory costs pose challenges for deployment. Model quantization has emerged as a promising solution to reduce storage overhead and accelerate inference. Nevertheless, existing quantization methods for diffusion models struggle to mitigate outliers in activation matrices during inference, leading to substantial performance degradation under low-bit quantization scenarios. To address this, we propose HQ-DM, a novel Quantization-Aware Training framework that applies Single Hadamard Transformation to activation matrices. This approach effectively reduces activation outliers while preserving model performance under quantization. Compared to traditional Double Hadamard Transformation, our proposed scheme offers distinct advantages by seamlessly supporting INT convolution operations while preventing the amplification of weight outliers. For conditional generation on the ImageNet 256x256 dataset using the LDM-4 model, our W4A4 and W4A3 quantization schemes improve the Inception Score by 12.8% and 467.73%, respectively, over the existing state-of-the-art method.

### Efficient Inference in First Passage Time Models
**Authors**: Sicheng Liu, Alexander Fengler, Michael J. Frank, Matthew T. Harrison

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T13:18:14Z

**Summary**: First passage time models describe the time it takes for a random process to exit a region of interest and are widely used across various scientific fields. Fast and accurate numerical methods for computing the likelihood function in these models are essential for efficient statistical inference of model parameters. Specifically, in computational cognitive neuroscience, generalized drift diffusion models (GDDMs) are an important class of first passage time models that describe the latent psychological processes underlying simple decision-making scenarios. GDDMs model the joint distribution over choices and response times as the first hitting time of a one-dimensional stochastic differential equation (SDE) to possibly time-varying upper and lower boundaries. They are widely applied to extract parameters associated with distinct cognitive and neural mechanisms. However, current likelihood computation methods struggle in common application scenarios in which drift rates dynamically vary within trials as a function of exogenous covariates (e.g., brain activity in specific regions or visual fixations). In this work, we propose a fast and flexible algorithm for computing the likelihood function of GDDMs based on a large class of SDEs satisfying the Cherkasov condition. Our method divides each trial into discrete stages, employs fast analytical results to compute stage-wise densities, and integrates these to compute the overall trial-wise likelihood. Numerical examples demonstrate that our method not only yields accurate likelihood evaluations for efficient statistical inference, but also considerably outperforms existing approaches in terms of speed.

### Tree Matching Networks for Natural Language Inference: Parameter-Efficient Semantic Understanding via Dependency Parse Trees
**Authors**: Jason Lunder

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T13:04:50Z

**Summary**: In creating sentence embeddings for Natural Language Inference (NLI) tasks, using transformer-based models like BERT leads to high accuracy, but require hundreds of millions of parameters. These models take in sentences as a sequence of tokens, and learn to encode the meaning of the sequence into embeddings such that those embeddings can be used reliably for NLI tasks. Essentially, every word is considered against every other word in the sequence, and the transformer model is able to determine the relationships between them, entirely from scratch. However, a model that accepts explicit linguistic structures like dependency parse trees may be able to leverage prior encoded information about these relationships, without having to learn them from scratch, thus improving learning efficiency. To investigate this, we adapt Graph Matching Networks (GMN) to operate on dependency parse trees, creating Tree Matching Networks (TMN). We compare TMN to a BERT based model on the SNLI entailment task and on the SemEval similarity task. TMN is able to achieve significantly better results with a significantly reduced memory footprint and much less training time than the BERT based model on the SNLI task, while both models struggled to preform well on the SemEval. Explicit structural representations significantly outperform sequence-based models at comparable scales, but current aggregation methods limit scalability. We propose multi-headed attention aggregation to address this limitation.

**Summary**: Climate adaptation is vital for the sustainability and sometimes the mere survival of our urban areas. However, small cities often struggle with limited personnel resources and integrating vast amounts of data from multiple sources for a comprehensive analysis. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a multi-layered system combining specialized LLMs, satellite imagery analysis and a knowledge base to aid in developing effective climate adaptation strategies.

### High Volume Rate 3D Ultrasound Reconstruction with Diffusion Models
**Authors**: Tristan S. W. Stevens, Oisín Nolan, Oudom Somphone, Jean-Luc Robert, Ruud J. G. van Sloun

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T12:54:31Z

**Summary**: Three-dimensional ultrasound enables real-time volumetric visualization of anatomical structures. Unlike traditional 2D ultrasound, 3D imaging reduces reliance on precise probe orientation, potentially making ultrasound more accessible to clinicians with varying levels of experience and improving automated measurements and post-exam analysis. However, achieving both high volume rates and high image quality remains a significant challenge. While 3D diverging waves can provide high volume rates, they suffer from limited tissue harmonic generation and increased multipath effects, which degrade image quality. One compromise is to retain focus in elevation while leveraging unfocused diverging waves in the lateral direction to reduce the number of transmissions per elevation plane. Reaching the volume rates achieved by full 3D diverging waves, however, requires dramatically undersampling the number of elevation planes. Subsequently, to render the full volume, simple interpolation techniques are applied. This paper introduces a novel approach to 3D ultrasound reconstruction from a reduced set of elevation planes by employing diffusion models (DMs) to achieve increased spatial and temporal resolution. We compare both traditional and supervised deep learning-based interpolation methods on a 3D cardiac ultrasound dataset. Our results show that DM-based reconstruction consistently outperforms the baselines in image quality and downstream task performance. Additionally, we accelerate inference by leveraging the temporal consistency inherent to ultrasound sequences. Finally, we explore the robustness of the proposed method by exploiting the probabilistic nature of diffusion posterior sampling to quantify reconstruction uncertainty and demonstrate improved recall on out-of-distribution data with synthetic anomalies under strong subsampling.

### LTA-thinker: Latent Thought-Augmented Training Framework for Large Language Models on Complex Reasoning
**Authors**: Jiaqi Wang, Binquan Ji, Haibo Luo, Yiyang Qi, Ruiting Li, Huiyan Wang, Yuantao Han, Cangyi Yang, jiaxu Zhang, Feiliang Ren

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T12:50:26Z

**Summary**: Complex Reasoning in Large Language Models can be dynamically optimized using Test-Time Scaling (TTS) to mitigate Overthinking. Methods such as Coconut, SoftCoT and its variant are effective in continuous latent space inference, the core bottleneck still lies in the efficient generation and utilization of high-quality Latent Thought. Drawing from the theory of SoftCoT++ that a larger variance in the generated Latent Thought distribution more closely approximates the golden truth distribution, we propose a Latent Thought-Augmented Training Framework--LTA-Thinker, which improves distributional variance and enhances reasoning performance from two perspectives. First, LTA-Thinker constructs a Latent Thought generation architecture based on a learnable prior. This architecture aims to increase the variance distribution of generated Latent Thought Vectors in order to simplify the overall structure and raise the performance ceiling. Second, LTA-Thinker introduces a distribution-based directional optimization paradigm that jointly constrains both distribution locality and distribution scale. This mechanism improves information efficiency and computational cost through a multi-objective co-training strategy, which combines standard Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) loss with two novel losses: Semantic Alignment Loss, which utilizes KL divergence to ensure that the Latent Thought is highly relevant to the semantics of the question; Reasoning Focus Loss, which utilizes a contrastive learning mechanism to guide the model to focus on the most critical reasoning steps. Experiments show that LTA-thinker achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among various baselines and demonstrates a higher performance ceiling and better scaling effects.

### Unified Semantic Transformer for 3D Scene Understanding
**Authors**: Sebastian Koch, Johanna Wald, Hide Matsuki, Pedro Hermosilla, Timo Ropinski, Federico Tombari

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T12:49:35Z

**Summary**: Holistic 3D scene understanding involves capturing and parsing unstructured 3D environments. Due to the inherent complexity of the real world, existing models have predominantly been developed and limited to be task-specific. We introduce UNITE, a Unified Semantic Transformer for 3D scene understanding, a novel feed-forward neural network that unifies a diverse set of 3D semantic tasks within a single model. Our model operates on unseen scenes in a fully end-to-end manner and only takes a few seconds to infer the full 3D semantic geometry. Our approach is capable of directly predicting multiple semantic attributes, including 3D scene segmentation, instance embeddings, open-vocabulary features, as well as affordance and articulations, solely from RGB images. The method is trained using a combination of 2D distillation, heavily relying on self-supervision and leverages novel multi-view losses designed to ensure 3D view consistency. We demonstrate that UNITE achieves state-of-the-art performance on several different semantic tasks and even outperforms task-specific models, in many cases, surpassing methods that operate on ground truth 3D geometry.

### Causal Structure Learning for Dynamical Systems with Theoretical Score Analysis
**Authors**: Nicholas Tagliapietra, Katharina Ensinger, Christoph Zimmer, Osman Mian

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T12:41:22Z

**Summary**: Real world systems evolve in continuous-time according to their underlying causal relationships, yet their dynamics are often unknown. Existing approaches to learning such dynamics typically either discretize time -- leading to poor performance on irregularly sampled data -- or ignore the underlying causality. We propose CaDyT, a novel method for causal discovery on dynamical systems addressing both these challenges. In contrast to state-of-the-art causal discovery methods that model the problem using discrete-time Dynamic Bayesian networks, our formulation is grounded in Difference-based causal models, which allow milder assumptions for modeling the continuous nature of the system. CaDyT leverages exact Gaussian Process inference for modeling the continuous-time dynamics which is more aligned with the underlying dynamical process. We propose a practical instantiation that identifies the causal structure via a greedy search guided by the Algorithmic Markov Condition and Minimum Description Length principle. Our experiments show that CaDyT outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both regularly and irregularly-sampled data, discovering causal networks closer to the true underlying dynamics.

### TiCard: Deployable EXPLAIN-only Residual Learning for Cardinality Estimation
**Authors**: Qizhi Wang

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T12:35:11Z

**Summary**: Cardinality estimation is a key bottleneck for cost-based query optimization, yet deployable improvements remain difficult: classical estimators miss correlations, while learned estimators often require workload-specific training pipelines and invasive integration into the optimizer. This paper presents TiCard, a low intrusion, correction-based framework that augments (rather than replaces) a database's native estimator. TiCard learns multiplicative residual corrections using EXPLAIN-only features, and uses EXPLAIN ANALYZE only for offline labels. We study two practical instantiations: (i) a Gradient Boosting Regressor for sub-millisecond inference, and (ii) TabPFN, an in-context tabular foundation model that adapts by refreshing a small reference set without gradient retraining. On TiDB with TPCH and the Join Order Benchmark, in a low-trace setting (263 executions total; 157 used for learning), TiCard improves operator-level tail accuracy substantially: P90 Q-error drops from 312.85 (native) to 13.69 (TiCard-GBR), and P99 drops from 37,974.37 to 3,416.50 (TiCard-TabPFN), while a join-only policy preserves near-perfect median behavior. We position TiCard as an AI4DB building block focused on deployability: explicit scope, conservative integration policies, and an integration roadmap from offline correction to in-optimizer use.

### Signature-Informed Selection Detection: A Novel Method for Multi-Locus Temporal Population Genetic Model with Recombination
**Authors**: Ritabrata Dutta, Yuehao Xu, Sherman Khoo, Francesca Basini, Andreas Futschik

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T12:32:37Z

**Summary**: In population genetics, there is often interest in inferring selection coefficients. This task becomes more challenging if multiple linked selected loci are considered simultaneously. For such a situation, we propose a novel generalized Bayesian framework where we compute a scoring rule posterior for the selection coefficients in multi-locus temporal population genetics models. As we consider trajectories of allele frequencies over time as our data, we choose to use a signature kernel scoring rule - a kernel scoring rule defined for high-dimensional time-series data using iterated path integrals of a path (called signatures). We can compute an unbiased estimate of the signature kernel score using model simulations. This enables us to sample asymptotically from the signature kernel scoring rule posterior of the selection coefficients using pseudo-marginal MCMC-type algorithms. Through a simulation study, we were able to show the inferential efficacy of our method compared to existing benchmark methods for two and three selected locus scenarios under the standard Wright-Fisher model with recombination and selection. We also consider a negative frequency-dependent selection model for one and two locus scenarios, and also joint inference of selection coefficients and initial haplotype frequencies under the standard Wright-Fisher model. Finally, we illustrate the application of our inferential method for two real-life dataset. More specifically, we consider a data set on Yeast, as well as data from an Evolve and Resequence (E\&R) experiment on {\em Drosophila simulans}.

### RTR-GS: 3D Gaussian Splatting for Inverse Rendering with Radiance Transfer and Reflection
**Authors**: Yongyang Zhou, Fang-Lue Zhang, Zichen Wang, Lei Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T12:25:15Z

**Summary**: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated impressive capabilities in novel view synthesis. However, rendering reflective objects remains a significant challenge, particularly in inverse rendering and relighting. We introduce RTR-GS, a novel inverse rendering framework capable of robustly rendering objects with arbitrary reflectance properties, decomposing BRDF and lighting, and delivering credible relighting results. Given a collection of multi-view images, our method effectively recovers geometric structure through a hybrid rendering model that combines forward rendering for radiance transfer with deferred rendering for reflections. This approach successfully separates high-frequency and low-frequency appearances, mitigating floating artifacts caused by spherical harmonic overfitting when handling high-frequency details. We further refine BRDF and lighting decomposition using an additional physically-based deferred rendering branch. Experimental results show that our method enhances novel view synthesis, normal estimation, decomposition, and relighting while maintaining efficient training inference process.

### KD-PINN: Knowledge-Distilled PINNs for ultra-low-latency real-time neural PDE solvers
**Authors**: Karim Bounja, Lahcen Laayouni, Abdeljalil Sakat

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T12:23:00Z

**Summary**: This work introduces Knowledge-Distilled Physics-Informed Neural Networks (KD-PINN), a framework that transfers the predictive accuracy of a high-capacity teacher model to a compact student through a continuous adaptation of the Kullback-Leibler divergence. In order to confirm its generality for various dynamics and dimensionalities, the framework is evaluated on a representative set of partial differential equations (PDEs). Across the considered benchmarks, the student model achieves inference speedups ranging from x4.8 (Navier-Stokes) to x6.9 (Burgers), while preserving accuracy. Accuracy is improved by on the order of 1% when the model is properly tuned. The distillation process also revealed a regularizing effect. With an average inference latency of 5.3 ms on CPU, the distilled models enter the ultra-low-latency real-time regime defined by sub-10 ms performance. Finally, this study examines how knowledge distillation reduces inference latency in PINNs, to contribute to the development of accurate ultra-low-latency neural PDE solvers.

### MindForge: Empowering Embodied Agents with Theory of Mind for Lifelong Cultural Learning
**Authors**: Mircea Lică, Ojas Shirekar, Baptiste Colle, Chirag Raman

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T12:21:25Z

**Summary**: Embodied agents powered by large language models (LLMs), such as Voyager, promise open-ended competence in worlds such as Minecraft. However, when powered by open-weight LLMs they still falter on elementary tasks after domain-specific fine-tuning. We propose MindForge, a generative-agent framework for cultural lifelong learning through explicit perspective taking. We introduce three key innovations: (1) a structured theory of mind representation linking percepts, beliefs, desires, and actions; (2) natural inter-agent communication; and (3) a multi-component memory system. Following the cultural learning framework, we test MindForge in both instructive and collaborative settings within Minecraft. In an instructive setting with GPT-4, MindForge agents powered by open-weight LLMs significantly outperform their Voyager counterparts in basic tasks yielding $3\times$ more tech-tree milestones and collecting $2.3\times$ more unique items than the Voyager baseline. Furthermore, in fully \textit{collaborative} settings, we find that the performance of two underachieving agents improves with more communication rounds, echoing the Condorcet Jury Theorem. MindForge agents demonstrate sophisticated behaviors, including expert-novice knowledge transfer, collaborative problem solving, and adaptation to out-of-distribution tasks through accumulated cultural experiences.

### Dwarf galaxies in the MATLAS Survey: Hubble Space Telescope observations of nuclear star clusters
**Authors**: Mélina Poulain, Francine R. Marleau, Pierre-Alain Duc, Rubén Sánchez-Janssen, Patrick R. Durrell, Sanjaya Paudel, Rebecca Habas, Oliver Müller, Sungsoon Lim, Nick Heesters, Jérémy Fensch

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T12:16:24Z

**Summary**: In dwarf galaxies, nuclear star clusters (NSCs) are believed to primarily form from the migration and merger of globular clusters (GCs), with a possible contribution from in-situ star-forming activity triggered by gas infall. We present the study of NSCs in 41 MATLAS survey dwarf galaxies including ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs), as part of a large follow-up imaging program with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) using the F606W and F814W filters. The sample is biased towards low-surface brightness and large dwarfs, i.e., UDG-like galaxies, and includes two galaxies with a double nucleus, 13 newly identified nucleated dwarfs thanks to HST's high spatial resolution, and five candidate ultra-compact dwarf progenitors. We modeled the NSCs with a Sérsic profile and derived their structural properties and photometry. We find the NSC Sérsic index to increase with the luminosity and stellar mass, while no obvious trend is seen on the effective radius and ellipticity. The faint NSCs tend to have a constant color profile, whereas the bright ones have a bluer center, suggesting that the most massive NSCs in our sample might have experienced a mixed formation scenario, including in-situ star formation. A significant portion of our NSCs tend to be more massive than for other galaxy samples of similar stellar mass, which could be due to some dwarfs ongoing tidal disruption or an initial formation of massive NSCs from multiple GC mergers and in-situ star forming activity. More observations of resolved NSC are needed to be able to infer their formation scenario from the structural properties and photometry in dwarfs.

### One Battle After Another: Probing LLMs' Limits on Multi-Turn Instruction Following with a Benchmark Evolving Framework
**Authors**: Qi Jia, Ye Shen, Xiujie Song, Kaiwei Zhang, Shibo Wang, Dun Pei, Xiangyang Zhu, Guangtao Zhai

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T12:11:36Z

**Summary**: Evaluating LLMs' instruction-following ability in multi-topic dialogues is essential yet challenging. Existing benchmarks are limited to a fixed number of turns, susceptible to saturation and failing to account for users' interactive experience. In this work, we propose a novel framework backed by a three-layer tracking mechanism and a query synthesis agent to mimic sequential user behaviors. Incorporating Flow Theory, we introduce process-centric metrics and terminate a conversational evaluation only upon exhausting user patience. Upon this framework, we present EvolIF, an evolving benchmark covering 12 constraint groups. Results indicate that GPT-5 excels, sustaining 14 turns with 66.40% robustness. It outperforms Gemini-3.0-Pro by a margin of 5.59%, while other models trail behind. Resources are available at https://github.com/JiaQiSJTU/EvolvingInstructionFollowing.

### DART: Difficulty-Adaptive Reasoning Truncation for Efficient Large Language Models
**Authors**: Ruofan Zhang, Bin Xia, Zhen Cheng, Cairen Jian, Minglun Yang, Ngai Wong, Yuan Cheng

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T12:09:10Z

**Summary**: Adaptive reasoning is essential for aligning the computational effort of large language models (LLMs) with the intrinsic difficulty of problems. Current chain-of-thought methods boost reasoning ability but indiscriminately generate long explanations, leading to evident inefficiency. However, existing reinforcement learning approaches to adaptive thinking remain unstable and heavily reward-dependent. Here we propose \textbf{DART}, a supervised \textbf{D}ifficulty-\textbf{A}daptive \textbf{R}easoning \textbf{T}runcation framework that adjusts thinking length according to problem difficulty. By distilling concise reasoning patterns from stronger models, interpolating them into a continuum of reasoning styles, and curating optimal training data that balances correctness and compactness, DART learns when to ``stop thinking''. Across multiple mathematical benchmarks, experimental results demonstrate its remarkable efficiency while preserving or improving accuracy, achieving a significant 81.2\% reasoning truncation (DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B on GSM8K dataset) with 5.33$\times$ computational acceleration. DART provides a stable and general paradigm for efficient reasoning, advancing the development of adaptive intelligence in LLMs.

### Implicit Bias and Invariance: How Hopfield Networks Efficiently Learn Graph Orbits
**Authors**: Michael Murray, Tenzin Chan, Kedar Karhadker, Christopher J. Hillar

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T12:06:58Z

**Summary**: Many learning problems involve symmetries, and while invariance can be built into neural architectures, it can also emerge implicitly when training on group-structured data. We study this phenomenon in classical Hopfield networks and show they can infer the full isomorphism class of a graph from a small random sample. Our results reveal that: (i) graph isomorphism classes can be represented within a three-dimensional invariant subspace, (ii) using gradient descent to minimize energy flow (MEF) has an implicit bias toward norm-efficient solutions, which underpins a polynomial sample complexity bound for learning isomorphism classes, and (iii) across multiple learning rules, parameters converge toward the invariant subspace as sample sizes grow. Together, these findings highlight a unifying mechanism for generalization in Hopfield networks: a bias toward norm efficiency in learning drives the emergence of approximate invariance under group-structured data.

### The Cost of Adaptation under Differential Privacy: Optimal Adaptive Federated Density Estimation
**Authors**: T. Tony Cai, Abhinav Chakraborty, Lasse Vuursteen

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T12:06:16Z

**Summary**: Privacy-preserving data analysis has become a central challenge in modern statistics. At the same time, a long-standing goal in statistics is the development of adaptive procedures -- methods that achieve near-optimal performance across diverse function classes without prior knowledge of underlying smoothness or complexity. While adaptation is often achievable at no extra cost in the classical non-private setting, this naturally raises a fundamental question: to what extent is adaptation still possible under privacy constraints?   We address this question in the context of density estimation under federated differential privacy (FDP), a framework that encompasses both central and local DP models. We establish sharp results that characterize the cost of adaptation under FDP for both global and pointwise estimation, revealing fundamental differences from the non-private case. We then propose an adaptive FDP estimator that achieves explicit performance guarantees by introducing a new noise mechanism, enabling one-shot adaptation via post-processing. This approach strictly improves upon existing adaptive DP methods. Finally, we develop new lower bound techniques that capture the limits of adaptive inference under privacy and may be of independent interest beyond this problem.   Our findings reveal a sharp contrast between private and non-private settings. For global estimation, where adaptation can be achieved for free in the classical non-private setting, we prove that under FDP an intrinsic adaptation cost is unavoidable. For pointwise estimation, where a logarithmic penalty is already known to arise in the non-private setting, we show that FDP introduces an additional logarithmic factor, thereby compounding the cost of adaptation. Taken together, these results provide the first rigorous characterization of the adaptive privacy-accuracy trade-off.

### Vector Prism: Animating Vector Graphics by Stratifying Semantic Structure
**Authors**: Jooyeol Yun, Jaegul Choo

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T12:03:46Z

**Summary**: Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) are central to modern web design, and the demand to animate them continues to grow as web environments become increasingly dynamic. Yet automating the animation of vector graphics remains challenging for vision-language models (VLMs) despite recent progress in code generation and motion planning. VLMs routinely mis-handle SVGs, since visually coherent parts are often fragmented into low-level shapes that offer little guidance of which elements should move together. In this paper, we introduce a framework that recovers the semantic structure required for reliable SVG animation and reveals the missing layer that current VLM systems overlook. This is achieved through a statistical aggregation of multiple weak part predictions, allowing the system to stably infer semantics from noisy predictions. By reorganizing SVGs into semantic groups, our approach enables VLMs to produce animations with far greater coherence. Our experiments demonstrate substantial gains over existing approaches, suggesting that semantic recovery is the key step that unlocks robust SVG animation and supports more interpretable interactions between VLMs and vector graphics.

### Step-Tagging: Toward controlling the generation of Language Reasoning Models through step monitoring
**Authors**: Yannis Belkhiter, Seshu Tirupathi, Giulio Zizzo, John D. Kelleher

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T12:01:16Z

**Summary**: The field of Language Reasoning Models (LRMs) has been very active over the past few years with advances in training and inference techniques enabling LRMs to reason longer, and more accurately. However, a growing body of studies show that LRMs are still inefficient, over-generating verification and reflection steps. To address this challenge, we introduce the Step-Tagging framework, a lightweight sentence-classifier enabling real-time annotation of the type of reasoning steps that an LRM is generating. To monitor reasoning behaviors, we introduced ReasonType: a novel taxonomy of reasoning steps. Building on this framework, we demonstrated that online monitoring of the count of specific steps can produce effective interpretable early stopping criteria of LRM inferences. We evaluate the Step-tagging framework on three open-source reasoning models across standard benchmark datasets: MATH500, GSM8K, AIME and non-mathematical tasks (GPQA and MMLU-Pro). We achieve 20 to 50\% token reduction while maintaining comparable accuracy to standard generation, with largest gains observed on more computation-heavy tasks. This work offers a novel way to increase control over the generation of LRMs, and a new tool to study behaviors of LRMs.

### ARCADE: Adaptive Robot Control with Online Changepoint-Aware Bayesian Dynamics Learning
**Authors**: Rishabh Dev Yadav, Avirup Das, Hongyu Song, Samuel Kaski, Wei Pan

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T11:57:42Z

**Summary**: Real-world robots must operate under evolving dynamics caused by changing operating conditions, external disturbances, and unmodeled effects. These may appear as gradual drifts, transient fluctuations, or abrupt shifts, demanding real-time adaptation that is robust to short-term variation yet responsive to lasting change. We propose a framework for modeling the nonlinear dynamics of robotic systems that can be updated in real time from streaming data. The method decouples representation learning from online adaptation, using latent representations learned offline to support online closed-form Bayesian updates. To handle evolving conditions, we introduce a changepoint-aware mechanism with a latent variable inferred from data likelihoods that indicates continuity or shift. When continuity is likely, evidence accumulates to refine predictions; when a shift is detected, past information is tempered to enable rapid re-learning. This maintains calibrated uncertainty and supports probabilistic reasoning about transient, gradual, or structural change. We prove that the adaptive regret of the framework grows only logarithmically in time and linearly with the number of shifts, competitive with an oracle that knows timings of shift. We validate on cartpole simulations and real quadrotor flights with swinging payloads and mid-flight drops, showing improved predictive accuracy, faster recovery, and more accurate closed-loop tracking than relevant baselines.

### Exploring Logistic Functions as Robust Alternatives to Hill Functions in Genetic Network Modeling
**Authors**: Belgacem Ismail

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T11:45:38Z

**Summary**: Gene regulatory networks exhibit sigmoidal dynamics traditionally modeled using Hill functions. When Hill coefficients are non-integer values--ubiquitous in experimental fitting--these functions lose differentiability at low expression, creating singularities that compromise numerical stability and impede control applications. We present a systematic framework replacing Hill functions with logistic functions: increasing for activation, decreasing for repression. Logistic functions preserve sigmoidal characteristics while offering key advantages: infinite differentiability, closed-form derivatives simplifying Jacobians, invertible forms enabling feedback linearization, and built-in basal expression. We prove existence and uniqueness with explicit Lipschitz bounds, guaranteeing unique solutions and boundedness. Parameter estimation with biologically motivated thresholds demonstrated in case studies: genetic oscillators, positive autoregulation in E. coli, two-gene chaotic networks. Simulations with experimental parameters show: logistic models allow noise escape from low-expression traps via basal, while Hill models trap irreversibly--relevant to gal operon and bistables. Logistic functions respond to absolute concentrations rather than logarithmic fold changes, aligning with molecule count-based decisions. Control advantages: controllability at zero (missing in Hill), seamless MPC integration, superior stability. Logit extensions enable network inference from scRNA-seq data, using concavity for convergence and handling dropouts. Applications: immunology, hematopoiesis with delays, environmental systems. The framework advances modeling for synthetic biology, therapeutic interventions, metabolic engineering, and genome-scale analysis.

### The EEPAS Model Revisited: Statistical Formalism and a High-Performance, Reproducible Open-Source Framework
**Authors**: Szu-Chi Chung, Chien-Hong Cho, Strong Wen

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T11:38:54Z

**Summary**: While short-term models such as the Short-Term Earthquake Probability (STEP) and Epidemic-Type Aftershock Sequence (ETAS) are well established and supported by open-source software, medium- to long-term models, notably the Every Earthquake a Precursor According to Scale (EEPAS) and Proximity to Past Earthquakes (PPE), remain under-documented and largely inaccessible. Despite outperforming time-invariant models in regional studies, their mathematical foundations are often insufficiently formalized. This study addresses these gaps by formally deriving the EEPAS and PPE models within the framework of inhomogeneous Poisson point processes and clarifying the connection between empirical $Ψ$-scaling regressions and likelihood-based inference. We introduce a fully automated, open-source Python implementation of EEPAS that combines analytical modeling with Numba JIT acceleration, NumPy vectorization, and joblib parallelization, all configured via modular JSON files for usability and reproducibility. Integration with pyCSEP enables standardized evaluation and comparison. When applied to the Italy HORUS dataset, our system reproduces published results within one hour using identical initialization settings. It also provides a comprehensive pipeline from raw catalog to parameter estimation, achieving improved log-likelihoods and passing strict consistency tests without manual $Ψ$ identification. We position our framework as part of a growing open-source ecosystem for seismological research that spans the full workflow from data acquisition to forecast evaluation. Our framework fills a key gap in this ecosystem by providing robust tools for medium- to long-term statistical modeling of earthquake catalogs, which is an essential but underserved component in probabilistic seismic forecasting.

### A Bayesian latent Gaussian conditional autoregressive copula model for analyzing spatially-varying trends in rainfall
**Authors**: Sayan Bhowmik, Arnab Hazra

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T11:27:19Z

**Summary**: Assessing the availability of rainfall water plays a crucial role in rainfed agriculture. Given the substantial proportion of agricultural practices in India being rainfed and considering the potential trends in rainfall amounts across years due to climate change, we build a statistical model for analyzing monsoon total rainfall data for 34 meteorological subdivisions of mainland India available for 1951-2014. Here, we model the marginal distributions using a gamma regression model and the dependence through a Gaussian conditional autoregressive (CAR) copula model. Due to the natural variation in the monsoon total rainfall received across various dry through wet regions of the country, we allow the parameters of the marginal distributions to be spatially varying, under a latent Gaussian model framework. The neighborhood structure of the regions determines the dependence structure of both the likelihood and the prior layers, where we explore both CAR and intrinsic CAR structures for the priors. The proposed methodology also effectively imputes the missing data. We use the Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms to draw Bayesian inferences. In simulation studies, the proposed model outperforms several competitors that do not allow a dependence structure at the data or prior layers. Implementing the proposed method for the Indian areal rainfall dataset, we draw inferences about the model parameters and discuss the potential effect of climate change on rainfall across India. While the assessment of the impact of climate change on rainfall motivates our study, the proposed methodology can be easily adapted to other contexts dealing with non-Gaussian non-stationary areal datasets where data from single or multiple temporal covariates are also available, and it is appropriate to assume their coefficients to be spatially varying.

### Improving the Accuracy of Amortized Model Comparison with Self-Consistency
**Authors**: Šimon Kucharský, Aayush Mishra, Daniel Habermann, Stefan T. Radev, Paul-Christian Bürkner

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T11:25:40Z

**Summary**: Amortized Bayesian inference (ABI) offers fast, scalable approximations to posterior densities by training neural surrogates on data simulated from the statistical model. However, ABI methods are highly sensitive to model misspecification: when observed data fall outside the training distribution (generative scope of the statistical models), neural surrogates can behave unpredictably. This makes it a challenge in a model comparison setting, where multiple statistical models are considered, of which at least some are misspecified. Recent work on self-consistency (SC) provides a promising remedy to this issue, accessible even for empirical data (without ground-truth labels). In this work, we investigate how SC can improve amortized model comparison conceptualized in four different ways. Across two synthetic and two real-world case studies, we find that approaches for model comparison that estimate marginal likelihoods through approximate parameter posteriors consistently outperform methods that directly approximate model evidence or posterior model probabilities. SC training improves robustness when the likelihood is available, even under severe model misspecification. The benefits of SC for methods without access of analytic likelihoods are more limited and inconsistent. Our results suggest practical guidance for reliable amortized Bayesian model comparison: prefer parameter posterior-based methods and augment them with SC training on empirical datasets to mitigate extrapolation bias under model misspecification.

### Inflation Attitudes of Large Language Models
**Authors**: Nikoleta Anesti, Edward Hill, Andreas Joseph

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T11:21:46Z

**Summary**: This paper investigates the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically GPT-3.5-turbo (GPT), to form inflation perceptions and expectations based on macroeconomic price signals. We compare the LLM's output to household survey data and official statistics, mimicking the information set and demographic characteristics of the Bank of England's Inflation Attitudes Survey (IAS). Our quasi-experimental design exploits the timing of GPT's training cut-off in September 2021 which means it has no knowledge of the subsequent UK inflation surge. We find that GPT tracks aggregate survey projections and official statistics at short horizons. At a disaggregated level, GPT replicates key empirical regularities of households' inflation perceptions, particularly for income, housing tenure, and social class. A novel Shapley value decomposition of LLM outputs suited for the synthetic survey setting provides well-defined insights into the drivers of model outputs linked to prompt content. We find that GPT demonstrates a heightened sensitivity to food inflation information similar to that of human respondents. However, we also find that it lacks a consistent model of consumer price inflation. More generally, our approach could be used to evaluate the behaviour of LLMs for use in the social sciences, to compare different models, or to assist in survey design.

### A Threshold-Triggered Deep Q-Network-Based Framework for Self-Healing in Autonomic Software-Defined IIoT-Edge Networks
**Authors**: Agrippina Mwangi, León Navarro-Hilfiker, Lukasz Brewka, Mikkel Gryning, Elena Fumagalli, Madeleine Gibescu

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T11:11:37Z

**Summary**: Stochastic disruptions such as flash events arising from benign traffic bursts and switch thermal fluctuations are major contributors to intermittent service degradation in software-defined industrial networks. These events violate IEC~61850-derived quality-of-service requirements and user-defined service-level agreements, hindering the reliable and timely delivery of control, monitoring, and best-effort traffic in IEC~61400-25-compliant wind power plants. Failure to maintain these requirements often results in delayed or lost control signals, reduced operational efficiency, and increased risk of wind turbine generator downtime.   To address these challenges, this study proposes a threshold-triggered Deep Q-Network self-healing agent that autonomically detects, analyzes, and mitigates network disruptions while adapting routing behavior and resource allocation in real time. The proposed agent was trained, validated, and tested on an emulated tri-clustered switch network deployed in a cloud-based proof-of-concept testbed.   Simulation results show that the proposed agent improves disruption recovery performance by 53.84% compared to a baseline shortest-path and load-balanced routing approach and outperforms state-of-the-art methods, including the Adaptive Network-based Fuzzy Inference System by 13.1% and the Deep Q-Network and traffic prediction-based routing optimization method by 21.5%, in a super-spine leaf data-plane architecture.   Additionally, the agent maintains switch thermal stability by proactively initiating external rack cooling when required. These findings highlight the potential of deep reinforcement learning in building resilience in software-defined industrial networks deployed in mission-critical, time-sensitive application scenarios.

### Efficient Adaptive Rejection Sampling for Accelerating Speculative Decoding in Large Language Models
**Authors**: Chendong Sun, mingmin Chen, Lei Xu

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T11:09:35Z

**Summary**: Speculative Decoding is a prominent technique for accelerating the autoregressive inference of large language models (LLMs) by employing a fast draft model to propose candidate token sequences and a large target model to verify them in parallel. However, its core component -- the rejection sampling mechanism -- relies on a fixed, context-independent random threshold. This leads to a significant "random rejection" problem in high-uncertainty generation scenarios, where plausible candidate tokens are frequently rejected due to random chance, undermining inference efficiency. This paper introduces Efficient Adaptive Rejection Sampling (EARS), a novel method that dynamically adjusts the acceptance threshold by incorporating the target model's own predictive uncertainty, measured as 1 - max(P_target). By introducing a tolerance term proportional to this uncertainty, EARS intelligently relaxes the acceptance criterion when the model is uncertain, effectively reducing random rejections while maintaining strict standards when the model is confident. Experiments on creative writing and open-domain QA tasks demonstrate that EARS significantly enhances the efficiency of speculative decoding, achieving up to an 18.12% increase in throughput with a negligible 0.84% accuracy drop on the GSM8K benchmark. The method requires no modifications to model architectures and can be seamlessly integrated into existing speculative decoding frameworks.

 ### TimeLens: Rethinking Video Temporal Grounding with Multimodal LLMs
**Authors**: Jun Zhang, Teng Wang, Yuying Ge, Yixiao Ge, Xinhao Li, Ying Shan, Limin Wang

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T18:59:58Z

**Summary**: This paper does not introduce a novel method but instead establishes a straightforward, incremental, yet essential baseline for video temporal grounding (VTG), a core capability in video understanding. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) excel at various video understanding tasks, the recipes for optimizing them for VTG remain under-explored. In this paper, we present TimeLens, a systematic investigation into building MLLMs with strong VTG ability, along two primary dimensions: data quality and algorithmic design. We first expose critical quality issues in existing VTG benchmarks and introduce TimeLens-Bench, comprising meticulously re-annotated versions of three popular benchmarks with strict quality criteria. Our analysis reveals dramatic model re-rankings compared to legacy benchmarks, confirming the unreliability of prior evaluation standards. We also address noisy training data through an automated re-annotation pipeline, yielding TimeLens-100K, a large-scale, high-quality training dataset. Building on our data foundation, we conduct in-depth explorations of algorithmic design principles, yielding a series of meaningful insights and effective yet efficient practices. These include interleaved textual encoding for time representation, a thinking-free reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) approach as the training paradigm, and carefully designed recipes for RLVR training. These efforts culminate in TimeLens models, a family of MLLMs with state-of-the-art VTG performance among open-source models and even surpass proprietary models such as GPT-5 and Gemini-2.5-Flash. All codes, data, and models will be released to facilitate future research.

### Love First, Know Later: Persona-Based Romantic Compatibility Through LLM Text World Engines
**Authors**: Haoyang Shang, Zhengyang Yan, Xuan Liu

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T18:59:14Z

**Summary**: We propose Love First, Know Later: a paradigm shift in computational matching that simulates interactions first, then assesses compatibility. Instead of comparing static profiles, our framework leverages LLMs as text world engines that operate in dual capacity-as persona-driven agents following behavioral policies and as the environment modeling interaction dynamics. We formalize compatibility assessment as a reward-modeling problem: given observed matching outcomes, we learn to extract signals from simulations that predict human preferences. Our key insight is that relationships hinge on responses to critical moments-we translate this observation from relationship psychology into mathematical hypotheses, enabling effective simulation. Theoretically, we prove that as LLM policies better approximate human behavior, the induced matching converges to optimal stable matching. Empirically, we validate on speed dating data for initial chemistry and divorce prediction for long-term stability. This paradigm enables interactive, personalized matching systems where users iteratively refine their agents, unlocking future possibilities for transparent and interactive compatibility assessment.

### Spoken DialogSum: An Emotion-Rich Conversational Dataset for Spoken Dialogue Summarization
**Authors**: Yen-Ju Lu, Kunxiao Gao, Mingrui Liang, Helin Wang, Thomas Thebaud, Laureano Moro-Velazquez, Najim Dehak, Jesus Villalba

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T18:54:20Z

**Summary**: Recent audio language models can follow long conversations. However, research on emotion-aware or spoken dialogue summarization is constrained by the lack of data that links speech, summaries, and paralinguistic cues. We introduce Spoken DialogSum, the first corpus aligning raw conversational audio with factual summaries, emotion-rich summaries, and utterance-level labels for speaker age, gender, and emotion. The dataset is built in two stages: first, an LLM rewrites DialogSum scripts with Switchboard-style fillers and back-channels, then tags each utterance with emotion, pitch, and speaking rate. Second, an expressive TTS engine synthesizes speech from the tagged scripts, aligned with paralinguistic labels. Spoken DialogSum comprises 13,460 emotion-diverse dialogues, each paired with both a factual and an emotion-focused summary. The dataset is available online at https://fatfat-emosum.github.io/EmoDialog-Sum-Audio-Samples/. Baselines show that an Audio-LLM raises emotional-summary ROUGE-L by 28% relative to a cascaded ASR-LLM system, confirming the value of end-to-end speech modeling.

### VIBE: Can a VLM Read the Room?
**Authors**: Tania Chakraborty, Eylon Caplan, Dan Goldwasser

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T18:42:51Z

**Summary**: Understanding human social behavior such as recognizing emotions and the social dynamics causing them is an important and challenging problem. While LLMs have made remarkable advances, they are limited to the textual domain and cannot account for the major role that non-verbal cues play in understanding social situations. Vision Language Models (VLMs) can potentially account for this gap, however their ability to make correct inferences over such social cues has received little attention. In this paper, we explore the capabilities of VLMs at social reasoning. We identify a previously overlooked limitation in VLMs: the Visual Social-Pragmatic Inference gap. To target this gap, we propose a new task for VLMs: Visual Social-Pragmatic Inference. We construct a high quality dataset to test the abilities of a VLM for this task and benchmark the performance of several VLMs on it.

### Reconsidering Conversational Norms in LLM Chatbots for Sustainable AI
**Authors**: Ronnie de Souza Santos, Cleyton Magalhães, Italo Santos

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T18:38:11Z

**Summary**: LLM based chatbots have become central interfaces in technical, educational, and analytical domains, supporting tasks such as code reasoning, problem solving, and information exploration. As these systems scale, sustainability concerns have intensified, with most assessments focusing on model architecture, hardware efficiency, and deployment infrastructure. However, existing mitigation efforts largely overlook how user interaction practices themselves shape the energy profile of LLM based systems. In this vision paper, we argue that interaction level behavior appears to be an underexamined factor shaping the environmental impact of LLM based systems, and we present this issue across four dimensions. First, extended conversational patterns increase token production and raise the computational cost of inference. Second, expectations of instant responses limit opportunities for energy aware scheduling and workload consolidation. Third, everyday user habits contribute to cumulative operational demand in ways that are rarely quantified. Fourth, the accumulation of context affects memory requirements and reduces the efficiency of long running dialogues. Addressing these challenges requires rethinking how chatbot interactions are designed and conceptualized, and adopting perspectives that recognize sustainability as partly dependent on the conversational norms through which users engage with LLM based systems.

### COMMA: A Communicative Multimodal Multi-Agent Benchmark
**Authors**: Timothy Ossowski, Danyal Maqbool, Jixuan Chen, Zefan Cai, Tyler Bradshaw, Junjie Hu

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T18:36:40Z

**Summary**: The rapid advances of multimodal agents built on large foundation models have largely overlooked their potential for language-based communication between agents in collaborative tasks. This oversight presents a critical gap in understanding their effectiveness in real-world deployments, particularly when communicating with humans. Existing agentic benchmarks fail to address key aspects of inter-agent communication and collaboration, particularly in scenarios where agents have unequal access to information and must work together to achieve tasks beyond the scope of individual capabilities. To fill this gap, we introduce COMMA: a novel puzzle benchmark designed to evaluate the collaborative performance of multimodal multi-agent systems through language communication. Our benchmark features a variety of multimodal puzzles, providing a comprehensive evaluation across four key categories of agentic capability in a communicative collaboration setting. Our findings reveal surprising weaknesses in state-of-the-art models, including strong proprietary models like GPT-4o and reasoning models like o4-mini. Many chain of thought reasoning models such as R1-Onevision and LLaVA-CoT struggle to outperform even a random baseline in agent-agent collaboration, indicating a potential growth area in their communication abilities.

### Temporal Tokenization Strategies for Event Sequence Modeling with Large Language Models
**Authors**: Zefang Liu, Nam H. Nguyen, Yinzhu Quan, Shi-Xiong Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T18:35:40Z

**Summary**: Representing continuous time is a critical and under-explored challenge in modeling temporal event sequences with large language models (LLMs). Various strategies like byte-level representations or calendar tokens have been proposed. However, the optimal approach remains unclear, especially given the diverse statistical distributions of real-world event data, which range from smooth log-normal to discrete, spiky patterns. This paper presents the first empirical study of temporal tokenization for event sequences, comparing distinct encoding strategies: naive numeric strings, high-precision byte-level representations, human-semantic calendar tokens, classic uniform binning, and adaptive residual scalar quantization. We evaluate these strategies by fine-tuning LLMs on real-world datasets that exemplify these diverse distributions. Our analysis reveals that no single strategy is universally superior; instead, prediction performance depends heavily on aligning the tokenizer with the data's statistical properties, with log-based strategies excelling on skewed distributions and human-centric formats proving robust for mixed modalities.

### EVOLVE-VLA: Test-Time Training from Environment Feedback for Vision-Language-Action Models
**Authors**: Zechen Bai, Chen Gao, Mike Zheng Shou

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T18:26:38Z

**Summary**: Achieving truly adaptive embodied intelligence requires agents that learn not just by imitating static demonstrations, but by continuously improving through environmental interaction, which is akin to how humans master skills through practice. Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have advanced robotic manipulation by leveraging large language models, yet remain fundamentally limited by Supervised Finetuning (SFT): requiring hundreds of demonstrations per task, rigidly memorizing trajectories, and failing to adapt when deployment conditions deviate from training. We introduce EVOLVE-VLA, a test-time training framework enabling VLAs to continuously adapt through environment interaction with minimal or zero task-specific demonstrations. The key technical challenge is replacing oracle reward signals (unavailable at test time) with autonomous feedback. We address this through a learned progress estimator providing dense feedback, and critically, we design our framework to ``tame'' this inherently noisy signal via two mechanisms: (1) an accumulative progress estimation mechanism smoothing noisy point-wise estimates, and (2) a progressive horizon extension strategy enabling gradual policy evolution. EVOLVE-VLA achieves substantial gains: +8.6\% on long-horizon tasks, +22.0\% in 1-shot learning, and enables cross-task generalization -- achieving 20.8\% success on unseen tasks without task-specific demonstrations training (vs. 0\% for pure SFT). Qualitative analysis reveals emergent capabilities absent in demonstrations, including error recovery and novel strategies. This work represents a critical step toward VLAs that truly learn and adapt, moving beyond static imitation toward continuous self-improvements.

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T18:21:18Z

**Summary**: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on tasks such as video captioning and visual question answering. However, their growing scale and video-level inputs lead to significant computational and memory overhead, posing challenges for real-time deployment on hardware accelerators. While prior work attempts to reduce redundancy via token pruning or merging, these methods typically operate at coarse granularity and incur high runtime overhead due to global token-level operations. In this study, we propose Focus, a Streaming Concentration Architecture that efficiently accelerates VLM inference through progressive, fine-grained redundancy elimination. Focus introduces a multilevel concentration paradigm that hierarchically compresses vision-language inputs at three levels: (1) semantic-guided token pruning based on textual prompts, (2) spatial-temporal block-level concentration using localized comparisons, and (3) vector-level redundancy removal via motion-aware matching. All concentration steps are tightly co-designed with the architecture to support streaming-friendly, on-chip execution. Focus leverages GEMM tiling, convolution-style layout, and cross-modal attention to minimize off-chip access while enabling high throughput. Implemented as a modular unit within a systolic-array accelerator, Focus achieves a 2.4x speedup and 3.3x reduction in energy, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art accelerators in both performance and energy efficiency. Full-stack implementation of Focus is open-sourced at https://github.com/dubcyfor3/Focus.

### ViRC: Enhancing Visual Interleaved Mathematical CoT with Reason Chunking
**Authors**: Lihong Wang, Liangqi Li, Weiwei Feng, Jiamin Wu, Changtao Miao, Tieru Wu, Rui Ma, Bo Zhang, Zhe Li

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T18:13:54Z

**Summary**: CoT has significantly enhanced the reasoning ability of LLMs while it faces challenges when extended to multimodal domains, particularly in mathematical tasks. Existing MLLMs typically perform textual reasoning solely from a single static mathematical image, overlooking dynamic visual acquisition during reasoning. In contrast, humans repeatedly examine visual image and employ step-by-step reasoning to prove intermediate propositions. This strategy of decomposing the problem-solving process into key logical nodes adheres to Miller's Law in cognitive science. Inspired by this insight, we propose a ViRC framework for multimodal mathematical tasks, introducing a Reason Chunking mechanism that structures multimodal mathematical CoT into consecutive Critical Reasoning Units (CRUs) to simulate human expert problem-solving patterns. CRUs ensure intra-unit textual coherence for intermediate proposition verification while integrating visual information across units to generate subsequent propositions and support structured reasoning. To this end, we present CRUX dataset by using three visual tools and four reasoning patterns to provide explicitly annotated CRUs across multiple reasoning paths for each mathematical problem. Leveraging the CRUX dataset, we propose a progressive training strategy inspired by human cognitive learning, which includes Instructional SFT, Practice SFT, and Strategic RL, aimed at further strengthening the Reason Chunking ability of the model.The resulting ViRC-7B model achieves a 18.8\% average improvement over baselines across multiple mathematical benchmarks. Code is available at https://github.com/Leon-LihongWang/ViRC.

### Latent Self-Consistency for Reliable Majority-Set Selection in Short- and Long-Answer Reasoning
**Authors**: Jungsuk Oh, Jay-Yoon Lee

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T17:50:43Z

**Summary**: Probabilistic decoding in Large Language Models (LLMs) often yields inconsistent outputs, particularly on complex or long-form questions. Self-Consistency (SC) mitigates this for short-form QA by majority voting over exact strings, whereas Universal Self-Consistency (USC) and Weighted Unigram Consistency Score (WUCS) extend to long-form responses but lose accuracy on short-form benchmarks.   We introduce \textbf{Latent Self-Consistency (LSC)}, which selects the most semantically consistent response using learnable token embeddings. LSC's lightweight forward processing of summary tokens only introduces negligible runtime overhead (at most $0.9\%$) on top of standard decoding of the base LLM, and requires no changes to the model architecture.   Across 6 short-form and 5 long-form reasoning benchmarks (e.g., MATH, MMLU, TruthfulQA), LSC surpasses SC, USC, and WUCS on both short-form and long-form on average performance, while adding negligible computational overhead on vanilla inference. These results position LSC as a reliable consistency-selection method that works effectively across various answer formats. Additionally, LSC provides well-calibrated confidence estimates, maintaining low expected calibration error across both answer formats.

### PruneX: A Hierarchical Communication-Efficient System for Distributed CNN Training with Structured Pruning
**Authors**: Alireza Olama, Andreas Lundell, Izzat El Hajj, Johan Lilius, Jerker Björkqvist

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T17:43:53Z

**Summary**: Inter-node communication bandwidth increasingly constrains distributed training at scale on multi-node GPU clusters. While compact models are the ultimate deployment target, conventional pruning-aware distributed training systems typically fail to reduce communication overhead because unstructured sparsity cannot be efficiently exploited by highly optimized dense collective primitives. We present PruneX, a distributed data-parallel training system that co-designs pruning algorithms with cluster hierarchy to reduce inter-node bandwidth usage. PruneX introduces the Hierarchical Structured ADMM (H-SADMM) algorithm, which enforces node-level structured sparsity before inter-node synchronization, enabling dynamic buffer compaction that eliminates both zero-valued transmissions and indexing overhead. The system adopts a leader-follower execution model with separated intra-node and inter-node process groups, performing dense collectives on compacted tensors over bandwidth-limited links while confining full synchronization to high-bandwidth intra-node interconnects. Evaluation on ResNet architectures across 64 GPUs demonstrates that PruneX reduces inter-node communication volume by approximately 60% and achieves 6.75x strong scaling speedup, outperforming the dense baseline (5.81x) and Top-K gradient compression (3.71x) on the Puhti supercomputer at CSC - IT Center for Science (Finland).

### MoT: A Model-Driven Low-Code Approach for Simplifying Cloud-of-Things Application Development
**Authors**: Cristiano Welter, Kleinner Farias

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T17:21:54Z

**Summary**: The integration of cloud computing and the Internet of Things (IoT) is essential for scalable, intelligent systems. However, developing cloud-of-things (CoT) applications remains challenging. It requires significant technical expertise and lacks standardized, model-driven methodologies. Current approaches fail to ensure interoperability, automation, and efficiency. This study introduces the Model of Things (MoT), a model-based approach that incorporates low-code principles to simplify CoT development. MoT reduces technical barriers by providing a custom UML profile designed for IoT and cloud services. To evaluate MoT, we conducted a case study and a Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) questionnaire. The results confirmed MoT's feasibility, demonstrating that it streamlines CoT application development and deployment. Users found MoT accessible, even with limited IoT experience, and reported high perceived ease of use and usefulness. Qualitative feedback highlighted MoT's ability to reduce complexity and speed up development. MoT offers a promising, model-driven solution for CoT application development. By lowering entry barriers and promoting automation, it enhances both efficiency and flexibility. This study represents a step toward a more user-friendly framework, enabling broader adoption of CoT technologies.

### LLmFPCA-detect: LLM-powered Multivariate Functional PCA for Anomaly Detection in Sparse Longitudinal Texts
**Authors**: Prasanjit Dubey, Aritra Guha, Zhengyi Zhou, Qiong Wu, Xiaoming Huo, Paromita Dubey

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T17:14:10Z

**Summary**: Sparse longitudinal (SL) textual data arises when individuals generate text repeatedly over time (e.g., customer reviews, occasional social media posts, electronic medical records across visits), but the frequency and timing of observations vary across individuals. These complex textual data sets have immense potential to inform future policy and targeted recommendations. However, because SL text data lack dedicated methods and are noisy, heterogeneous, and prone to anomalies, detecting and inferring key patterns is challenging. We introduce LLmFPCA-detect, a flexible framework that pairs LLM-based text embeddings with functional data analysis to detect clusters and infer anomalies in large SL text datasets. First, LLmFPCA-detect embeds each piece of text into an application-specific numeric space using LLM prompts. Sparse multivariate functional principal component analysis (mFPCA) conducted in the numeric space forms the workhorse to recover primary population characteristics, and produces subject-level scores which, together with baseline static covariates, facilitate data segmentation, unsupervised anomaly detection and inference, and enable other downstream tasks. In particular, we leverage LLMs to perform dynamic keyword profiling guided by the data segments and anomalies discovered by LLmFPCA-detect, and we show that cluster-specific functional PC scores from LLmFPCA-detect, used as features in existing pipelines, help boost prediction performance. We support the stability of LLmFPCA-detect with experiments and evaluate it on two different applications using public datasets, Amazon customer-review trajectories, and Wikipedia talk-page comment streams, demonstrating utility across domains and outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.

### PerProb: Indirectly Evaluating Memorization in Large Language Models
**Authors**: Yihan Liao, Jacky Keung, Xiaoxue Ma, Jingyu Zhang, Yicheng Sun

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T17:10:01Z

**Summary**: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has been driven by extensive datasets that may contain sensitive information, raising serious privacy concerns. One notable threat is the Membership Inference Attack (MIA), where adversaries infer whether a specific sample was used in model training. However, the true impact of MIA on LLMs remains unclear due to inconsistent findings and the lack of standardized evaluation methods, further complicated by the undisclosed nature of many LLM training sets. To address these limitations, we propose PerProb, a unified, label-free framework for indirectly assessing LLM memorization vulnerabilities. PerProb evaluates changes in perplexity and average log probability between data generated by victim and adversary models, enabling an indirect estimation of training-induced memory. Compared with prior MIA methods that rely on member/non-member labels or internal access, PerProb is independent of model and task, and applicable in both black-box and white-box settings. Through a systematic classification of MIA into four attack patterns, we evaluate PerProb's effectiveness across five datasets, revealing varying memory behaviors and privacy risks among LLMs. Additionally, we assess mitigation strategies, including knowledge distillation, early stopping, and differential privacy, demonstrating their effectiveness in reducing data leakage. Our findings offer a practical and generalizable framework for evaluating and improving LLM privacy.

### LLM-driven Knowledge Enhancement for Multimodal Cancer Survival Prediction
**Authors**: Chenyu Zhao, Yingxue Xu, Fengtao Zhou, Yihui Wang, Hao Chen

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T17:03:56Z

**Summary**: Current multimodal survival prediction methods typically rely on pathology images (WSIs) and genomic data, both of which are high-dimensional and redundant, making it difficult to extract discriminative features from them and align different modalities. Moreover, using a simple survival follow-up label is insufficient to supervise such a complex task. To address these challenges, we propose KEMM, an LLM-driven Knowledge-Enhanced Multimodal Model for cancer survival prediction, which integrates expert reports and prognostic background knowledge. 1) Expert reports, provided by pathologists on a case-by-case basis and refined by large language model (LLM), offer succinct and clinically focused diagnostic statements. This information may typically suggest different survival outcomes. 2) Prognostic background knowledge (PBK), generated concisely by LLM, provides valuable prognostic background knowledge on different cancer types, which also enhances survival prediction. To leverage these knowledge, we introduce the knowledge-enhanced cross-modal (KECM) attention module. KECM can effectively guide the network to focus on discriminative and survival-relevant features from highly redundant modalities. Extensive experiments on five datasets demonstrate that KEMM achieves state-of-the-art performance. The code will be released upon acceptance.

**Authors**: Ruida Cheng, Tejas Sudharshan Mathai, Pritam Mukherjee, Benjamin Hou, Qingqing Zhu, Zhiyong Lu, Matthew McAuliffe, Ronald M. Summers

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T17:03:17Z

**Summary**: Segmentation of lesions on CT enables automatic measurement for clinical assessment of chronic diseases (e.g., lymphoma). Integrating large language models (LLMs) into the lesion segmentation workflow has the potential to combine imaging features with descriptions of lesion characteristics from the radiology reports. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of integrating text into the Swin-UMamba architecture for the task of lesion segmentation. The publicly available ULS23 DeepLesion dataset was used along with short-form descriptions of the findings from the reports. On the test dataset, our method achieved a high Dice score of 82.64, and a low Hausdorff distance of 6.34 pixels was obtained for lesion segmentation. The proposed Text-Swin-U/Mamba model outperformed prior approaches: 37.79% improvement over the LLM-driven LanGuideMedSeg model (p < 0.001), and surpassed the purely image-based XLSTM-UNet and nnUNet models by 2.58% and 1.01%, respectively.

### Towards Nepali-language LLMs: Efficient GPT training with a Nepali BPE tokenizer
**Authors**: Adarsha Shrestha, Basanta Pokharel, Binit Shrestha, Smriti Adhikari, Dinesh Gothe

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T16:53:11Z

**Summary**: Nepali, a low-resource language spoken by over 32 million people, continues to face challenges in natural language processing (NLP) due to its complex grammar, agglutinative morphology, and limited availability of high-quality corpora. Most efforts to date have centered on basic encoder architectures; they remain insufficient for Nepali-specific text generation. This study presents a GPT-2-based Nepali language model trained using several training strategies inspired by GPT-3, including optimized learning rate schedules, batch scaling, and architectural refinements. A custom 16k Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenizer was trained exclusively on Nepali text to ensure more consistent segmentation and improved input representation. The model was pretrained on a combined dataset comprising a 10.75GB cleaned NepBERTa corpus and additional web-scraped Nepali news articles. FlashAttention was integrated to reduce memory usage and stabilize training. After two epochs, the model achieved a training loss of 3.168177, a validation loss of 3.081982, and a final perplexity of 21.80, demonstrating its capability to generate coherent Nepali news-style text.

**Authors**: Tejaswani Dash, Gautam Datla, Anudeep Vurity, Tazeem Ahmad, Mohd Adnan, Saima Rafi, Saisha Patro, Saina Patro

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T16:33:59Z

**Summary**: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of mortality worldwide, underscoring the need for reliable and efficient predictive tools that support early intervention. Traditional diagnostic approaches rely on handcrafted features and clinician expertise, while machine learning methods improve reproducibility but often struggle to generalize across noisy and heterogeneous clinical data. In this work, we propose Residual GRU with Multi-Head Self-Attention, a compact deep learning architecture designed for tabular clinical records. The model integrates residual bidirectional gated recurrent units for sequential modeling of feature columns, a channel reweighting block, and multi-head self-attention pooling with a learnable classification token to capture global context. We evaluate the model on the UCI Heart Disease dataset using 5-fold stratified cross-validation and compare it against classical methods such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines, as well as modern deep learning baselines including DeepMLP, convolutional networks, recurrent networks, and Transformers. The proposed model achieves an accuracy of 0.861, macro-F1 of 0.860, ROC-AUC of 0.908, and PR-AUC of 0.904, outperforming all baselines. Ablation studies confirm the individual contributions of residual recurrence, channel gating, and attention pooling. t-SNE visualizations further indicate that the learned embeddings exhibit clearer separation between disease and non-disease classes compared to raw features. These results demonstrate that lightweight hybrid recurrent and attention-based architectures provide a strong balance between accuracy and efficiency for clinical risk prediction, supporting deployment in resource-constrained healthcare settings.

### Polypersona: Persona-Grounded LLM for Synthetic Survey Responses
**Authors**: Tejaswani Dash, Dinesh Karri, Anudeep Vurity, Gautam Datla, Tazeem Ahmad, Saima Rafi, Rohith Tangudu

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T16:33:23Z

**Summary**: This paper introduces PolyPersona, a generative framework for synthesizing persona-conditioned survey responses across multiple domains. The framework instruction-tunes compact chat models using parameter-efficient LoRA adapters with 4-bit quantization under a resource-adaptive training setup. A dialogue-based data pipeline explicitly preserves persona cues, ensuring consistent behavioral alignment across generated responses. Using this pipeline, we construct a dataset of 3,568 synthetic survey responses spanning ten domains and 433 distinct personas, enabling controlled instruction tuning and systematic multi-domain evaluation. We evaluate the generated responses using a multi-metric evaluation suite that combines standard text generation metrics, including BLEU, ROUGE, and BERTScore, with survey-specific metrics designed to assess structural coherence, stylistic consistency, and sentiment alignment.Experimental results show that compact models such as TinyLlama 1.1B and Phi-2 achieve performance comparable to larger 7B to 8B baselines, with a highest BLEU score of 0.090 and ROUGE-1 of 0.429. These findings demonstrate that persona-conditioned fine-tuning enables small language models to generate reliable and coherent synthetic survey data. The proposed framework provides an efficient and reproducible approach for survey data generation, supporting scalable evaluation while facilitating bias analysis through transparent and open protocols.

### Agreement Between Large Language Models and Human Raters in Essay Scoring: A Research Synthesis
**Authors**: Hongli Li, Che Han Chen, Kevin Fan, Chiho Young-Johnson, Soyoung Lim, Yali Feng

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T16:33:07Z

**Summary**: Despite the growing promise of large language models (LLMs) in automatic essay scoring (AES), empirical findings regarding their reliability compared to human raters remain mixed. Following the PRISMA 2020 guidelines, we synthesized 65 published and unpublished studies from January 2022 to August 2025 that examined agreement between LLMs and human raters in AES. Across studies, reported LLM-human agreement was generally moderate to good, with agreement indices (e.g., Quadratic Weighted Kappa, Pearson correlation, and Spearman's rho) mostly ranging between 0.30 and 0.80. Substantial variability in agreement levels was observed across studies, reflecting differences in study-specific factors as well as the lack of standardized reporting practices. Implications and directions for future research are discussed.

**Authors**: Nguyen Tien Dong, Minh-Anh Nguyen, Thanh Dat Hoang, Nguyen Tuan Ngoc, Dao Xuan Quang Minh, Phan Phi Hai, Nguyen Thi Ngoc Anh, Dang Van Tu, Binh Vu

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T16:28:32Z

**Summary**: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has enabled new possibilities for applying artificial intelligence within the legal domain. Nonetheless, the complexity, hierarchical organization, and frequent revisions of Vietnamese legislation pose considerable challenges for evaluating how well these models interpret and utilize legal knowledge. To address this gap, Vietnamese Legal Benchmark (VLegal-Bench) is introduced, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to systematically assess LLMs on Vietnamese legal tasks. Informed by Bloom's cognitive taxonomy, VLegal-Bench encompasses multiple levels of legal understanding through tasks designed to reflect practical usage scenarios. The benchmark comprises 10,450 samples generated through a rigorous annotation pipeline, where legal experts label and cross-validate each instance using our annotation system to ensure every sample is grounded in authoritative legal documents and mirrors real-world legal assistant workflows, including general legal questions and answers, retrieval-augmented generation, multi-step reasoning, and scenario-based problem solving tailored to Vietnamese law. By providing a standardized, transparent, and cognitively informed evaluation framework, VLegal-Bench establishes a solid foundation for assessing LLM performance in Vietnamese legal contexts and supports the development of more reliable, interpretable, and ethically aligned AI-assisted legal systems.

### VersatileFFN: Achieving Parameter Efficiency in LLMs via Adaptive Wide-and-Deep Reuse
**Authors**: Ying Nie, Kai Han, Hongguang Li, Hang Zhou, Tianyu Guo, Enhua Wu, Xinghao Chen, Yunhe Wang

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T16:08:23Z

**Summary**: The rapid scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs) has achieved remarkable performance, but it also leads to prohibitive memory costs. Existing parameter-efficient approaches such as pruning and quantization mainly compress pretrained models without enhancing architectural capacity, thereby hitting the representational ceiling of the base model. In this work, we propose VersatileFFN, a novel feed-forward network (FFN) that enables flexible reuse of parameters in both width and depth dimensions within a fixed parameter budget. Inspired by the dual-process theory of cognition, VersatileFFN comprises two adaptive pathways: a width-versatile path that generates a mixture of sub-experts from a single shared FFN, mimicking sparse expert routing without increasing parameters, and a depth-versatile path that recursively applies the same FFN to emulate deeper processing for complex tokens. A difficulty-aware gating dynamically balances the two pathways, steering "easy" tokens through the efficient width-wise route and allocating deeper iterative refinement to "hard" tokens. Crucially, both pathways reuse the same parameters, so all additional capacity comes from computation rather than memory. Experiments across diverse benchmarks and model scales demonstrate the effectiveness of the method. The code will be available at https://github.com/huawei-noah/noah-research/tree/master/VersatileFFN.

### Dynamic Learning Rate Scheduling based on Loss Changes Leads to Faster Convergence
**Authors**: Shreyas Subramanian, Bala Krishnamoorthy, Pranav Murthy

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T16:03:52Z

**Summary**: Despite significant advances in optimizers for training, most research works use common scheduler choices like Cosine or exponential decay. In this paper, we study \emph{GreedyLR}, a novel scheduler that adaptively adjusts the learning rate during training based on the current loss. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed scheduler, we conduct experiments on several NLP, CV, and LLM tasks with up to $7B$ parameters, including both fine-tuning and pre-training experiments. The results show that our approach outperforms several state-of-the-art schedulers in terms of accuracy, speed, and convergence. We also provide a theoretical analysis of the GreedyLR algorithm, including a proof of convergence and derivation of the optimal scaling factor $F$ that maximizes the convergence rate, along with experiments to show robustness of the algorithm to realistic noisy landscapes. Our scheduler is easy to implement, computationally efficient, and could be considered a good default scheduler for training.

### Exploring Network-Knowledge Graph Duality: A Case Study in Agentic Supply Chain Risk Analysis
**Authors**: Evan Heus, Rick Bookstaber, Dhruv Sharma

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T15:50:12Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with the complex, multi-modal, and network-native data underlying financial risk. Standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) oversimplifies relationships, while specialist models are costly and static. We address this gap with an LLM-centric agent framework for supply chain risk analysis. Our core contribution is to exploit the inherent duality between networks and knowledge graphs (KG). We treat the supply chain network as a KG, allowing us to use structural network science principles for retrieval. A graph traverser, guided by network centrality scores, efficiently extracts the most economically salient risk paths. An agentic architecture orchestrates this graph retrieval alongside data from numerical factor tables and news streams. Crucially, it employs novel ``context shells'' -- descriptive templates that embed raw figures in natural language -- to make quantitative data fully intelligible to the LLM. This lightweight approach enables the model to generate concise, explainable, and context-rich risk narratives in real-time without costly fine-tuning or a dedicated graph database.

### RepoTransBench: A Real-World Multilingual Benchmark for Repository-Level Code Translation
**Authors**: Yanli Wang, Yanlin Wang, Suiquan Wang, Daya Guo, Jiachi Chen, John Grundy, Xilin Liu, Yuchi Ma, Mingzhi Mao, Hongyu Zhang, Zibin Zheng

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T15:45:13Z

**Summary**: Repository-level code translation refers to translating an entire code repository from one programming language to another while preserving the functionality of the source repository. Many benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate the performance of such code translators. However, previous benchmarks mostly provide fine-grained samples, focusing at either code snippet, function, or file-level code translation. Such benchmarks do not accurately reflect real-world demands, where entire repositories often need to be translated, involving longer code length and more complex functionalities. To address this gap, we propose a new benchmark, named RepoTransBench, which is a real-world multilingual repository-level code translation benchmark featuring 1,897 real-world repository samples across 13 language pairs with automatically executable test suites. Besides, we introduce RepoTransAgent, a general agent framework to perform repository-level code translation. We evaluate both our benchmark's challenges and agent's effectiveness using several methods and backbone LLMs, revealing that repository-level translation remains challenging, where the best-performing method achieves only a 32.8% success rate. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that translation difficulty varies significantly by language pair direction, with dynamic-to-static language translation being much more challenging than the reverse direction (achieving below 10% vs. static-to-dynamic at 45-63%). Finally, we conduct a detailed error analysis and highlight current LLMs' deficiencies in repository-level code translation, which could provide a reference for further improvements. We provide the code and data at https://github.com/DeepSoftwareAnalytics/RepoTransBench.

### Linguists should learn to love speech-based deep learning models
**Authors**: Marianne de Heer Kloots, Paul Boersma, Willem Zuidema

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T15:42:22Z

**Summary**: Futrell and Mahowald present a useful framework bridging technology-oriented deep learning systems and explanation-oriented linguistic theories. Unfortunately, the target article's focus on generative text-based LLMs fundamentally limits fruitful interactions with linguistics, as many interesting questions on human language fall outside what is captured by written text. We argue that audio-based deep learning models can and should play a crucial role.

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T15:40:44Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in transforming recommender systems from implicit behavioral pattern matching to explicit intent reasoning. While RecGPT-V1 successfully pioneered this paradigm by integrating LLM-based reasoning into user interest mining and item tag prediction, it suffers from four fundamental limitations: (1) computational inefficiency and cognitive redundancy across multiple reasoning routes; (2) insufficient explanation diversity in fixed-template generation; (3) limited generalization under supervised learning paradigms; and (4) simplistic outcome-focused evaluation that fails to match human standards.   To address these challenges, we present RecGPT-V2 with four key innovations. First, a Hierarchical Multi-Agent System restructures intent reasoning through coordinated collaboration, eliminating cognitive duplication while enabling diverse intent coverage. Combined with Hybrid Representation Inference that compresses user-behavior contexts, our framework reduces GPU consumption by 60% and improves exclusive recall from 9.39% to 10.99%. Second, a Meta-Prompting framework dynamically generates contextually adaptive prompts, improving explanation diversity by +7.3%. Third, constrained reinforcement learning mitigates multi-reward conflicts, achieving +24.1% improvement in tag prediction and +13.0% in explanation acceptance.

**Authors**: Teodor Poncu, Ioana Pintilie, Marius Dragoi, Dragos Tantaru, Florin Brad

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T15:36:29Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) typically excel at coding tasks involving high-level programming languages, as opposed to lower-level programming languages, such as assembly. We propose a synthetic data generation method named C-ing Clearly, which leverages the corresponding C code to enhance an LLM's understanding of assembly. By fine-tuning on data generated through our method, we demonstrate improved LLM performance for binary code summarization and vulnerability detection. Our approach demonstrates consistent gains across different LLM families and model sizes.

### Reputation-Based Leader Election under Partial Synchrony: Towards a Protocol-Independent Abstraction with Enhanced Guarantees
**Authors**: Xuyang Liu, Zijian Zhang, Zhen Li, Jiahang Sun, Jiamou Liu, Peng Jiang

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T15:33:42Z

**Summary**: Leader election serves a well-defined role in leader-based Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) protocols. Existing reputation-based leader election frameworks for partially synchronous BFTs suffer from either protocol-specific proofs, narrow applicability, or unbounded recovery after network stabilization, leaving an open problem. This paper presents a novel protocol-independent abstraction formalizing generic correctness properties and effectiveness guarantees for leader election under partial synchrony, enabling protocol-independent analysis and design. Building on this, we design the Sliding Window Leader Election (SWLE) mechanism. SWLE dynamically adjusts leader nominations via consensus-behavior-based reputation scores, enforcing Byzantine-cost amplification. We demonstrate SWLE introduces minimal extra overhead to the base protocol and prove it satisfies all abstraction properties and provides superior effectiveness. We show, with a 16-server deployment across 4 different regions in northern China, SWLE achieves up to 4.2x higher throughput, 75% lower latency and 27% Byzantine leader frequency compared to the state-of-the-art solution under common Byzantine faults, while maintaining efficiency in fault-free scenarios.

Keane, Hanruo Liu, Hongen Liao, Ningli Wang, Huiqi Li

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T15:33:08Z

**Summary**: Current retinal foundation models remain constrained by curated research datasets that lack authentic clinical context, and require extensive task-specific optimization for each application, limiting their deployment efficiency in low-resource settings. Here, we show that these barriers can be overcome by building clinical native intelligence directly from real-world medical practice. Our key insight is that large-scale telemedicine programs, where expert centers provide remote consultations across distributed facilities, represent a natural reservoir for learning clinical image interpretation. We present ReVision, a retinal foundation model that learns from the natural alignment between 485,980 color fundus photographs and their corresponding diagnostic reports, accumulated through a decade-long telemedicine program spanning 162 medical institutions across China. Through extensive evaluation across 27 ophthalmic benchmarks, we demonstrate that ReVison enables deployment efficiency with minimal local resources. Without any task-specific training, ReVision achieves zero-shot disease detection with an average AUROC of 0.946 across 12 public benchmarks and 0.952 on 3 independent clinical cohorts. When minimal adaptation is feasible, ReVision matches extensively fine-tuned alternatives while requiring orders of magnitude fewer trainable parameters and labeled examples. The learned representations also transfer effectively to new clinical sites, imaging domains, imaging modalities, and systemic health prediction tasks. In a prospective reader study with 33 ophthalmologists, ReVision's zero-shot assistance improved diagnostic accuracy by 14.8% across all experience levels. These results demonstrate that clinical native intelligence can be directly extracted from clinical archives without any further annotation to build medical AI systems suited to various low-resource settings.

**Authors**: Shifu Bie, Jiangxia Cao, Zixiao Luo, Yichuan Zou, Lei Liang, Lu Zhang, Linxun Chen, Zhaojie Liu, Xuanping Li, Guorui Zhou, Kaiqiao Zhan, Kun Gai

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T15:23:28Z

**Summary**: We present PushGen, an automated framework for generating high-quality push notifications comparable to human-crafted content. With the rise of generative models, there is growing interest in leveraging LLMs for push content generation. Although LLMs make content generation straightforward and cost-effective, maintaining stylistic control and reliable quality assessment remains challenging, as both directly impact user engagement. To address these issues, PushGen combines two key components: (1) a controllable category prompt technique to guide LLM outputs toward desired styles, and (2) a reward model that ranks and selects generated candidates. Extensive offline and online experiments demonstrate its effectiveness, which has been deployed in large-scale industrial applications, serving hundreds of millions of users daily.

### SASQ: Static Activation Scaling for Quantization-Aware Training in Large Language Models
**Authors**: Shizhuo Mao, Song Chen, Yi Kang

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T15:12:34Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) excel at natural language tasks but face deployment challenges due to their growing size outpacing GPU memory advancements. Model quantization mitigates this issue by lowering weight and activation precision, but existing solutions face fundamental trade-offs: dynamic quantization incurs high computational overhead and poses deployment challenges on edge devices, while static quantization sacrifices accuracy. Existing approaches of quantization-aware training (QAT) further suffer from weight training costs. We propose SASQ: a lightweight QAT framework specifically tailored for activation quantization factors. SASQ exclusively optimizes only the quantization factors (without changing pre-trained weights), enabling static inference with high accuracy while maintaining deployment efficiency. SASQ adaptively truncates some outliers, thereby reducing the difficulty of quantization while preserving the distributional characteristics of the activations. SASQ not only surpasses existing SOTA quantization schemes but also outperforms the corresponding FP16 models. On LLaMA2-7B, it achieves 5.2% lower perplexity than QuaRot and 4.7% lower perplexity than the FP16 model on WikiText2.

### Model-First Reasoning LLM Agents: Reducing Hallucinations through Explicit Problem Modeling
**Authors**: Annu Rana, Gaurav Kumar

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T15:07:36Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with complex multi-step planning tasks, showing high rates of constraint violations and inconsistent solutions. Existing strategies such as Chain-of-Thought and ReAct rely on implicit state tracking and lack an explicit problem representation. Inspired by classical AI planning, we propose Model-First Reasoning (MFR), a two-phase paradigm in which the LLM first constructs an explicit model of the problem, defining entities, state variables, actions, and constraints, before generating a solution plan. Across multiple planning domains, including medical scheduling, route planning, resource allocation, logic puzzles, and procedural synthesis, MFR reduces constraint violations and improves solution quality compared to Chain-of-Thought and ReAct. Ablation studies show that the explicit modeling phase is critical for these gains. Our results suggest that many LLM planning failures stem from representational deficiencies rather than reasoning limitations, highlighting explicit modeling as a key component for robust and interpretable AI agents. All prompts, evaluation procedures, and task datasets are documented to facilitate reproducibility.

### Aligning Security Compliance and DevOps: A Longitudinal Study
**Authors**: Fabiola Moyón, Florian Angermeir, Daniel Mendez, Tony Gorschek, Markus Voggenreiter, Pierre-Louis Bonvin

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T14:43:14Z

**Summary**: Companies adopt agile methodologies and DevOps to facilitate efficient development and deployment of software-intensive products. This, in turn, introduces challenges in relation to security standard compliance traditionally following a more linear workflow. This is especially a challenge for the engineering of products and services associated with critical infrastructures. To support companies in their transition towards DevOps, this paper presents an adaptation of DevOps according to security regulations and standards. We report on our longitudinal study at Siemens AG, consisting of several individual sub-studies in the inception, validation, and initial adoption of our framework based on RefA as well as the implications for practice. RefA is a prescriptive model of a security compliant DevOps lifecycle based on the IEC 62443-4-1 standard. The overall framework is aimed at professionals, not only security experts, being able to use it on implementing DevOps processes while remaining compliant with security norms. We demonstrate how RefA facilitates the transfer of security compliance knowledge to product development teams. This knowledge transfer supports the agility aim of ensuring that cross-functional teams have all the skills needed to deliver the compliant products.

### Reasoning-Style Poisoning of LLM Agents via Stealthy Style Transfer: Process-Level Attacks and Runtime Monitoring in RSV Space
**Authors**: Xingfu Zhou, Pengfei Wang

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T14:34:10Z

**Summary**: Large Language Model (LLM) agents relying on external retrieval are increasingly deployed in high-stakes environments. While existing adversarial attacks primarily focus on content falsification or instruction injection, we identify a novel, process-oriented attack surface: the agent's reasoning style. We propose Reasoning-Style Poisoning (RSP), a paradigm that manipulates how agents process information rather than what they process. We introduce Generative Style Injection (GSI), an attack method that rewrites retrieved documents into pathological tones--specifically "analysis paralysis" or "cognitive haste"--without altering underlying facts or using explicit triggers. To quantify these shifts, we develop the Reasoning Style Vector (RSV), a metric tracking Verification depth, Self-confidence, and Attention focus. Experiments on HotpotQA and FEVER using ReAct, Reflection, and Tree of Thoughts (ToT) architectures reveal that GSI significantly degrades performance. It increases reasoning steps by up to 4.4 times or induces premature errors, successfully bypassing state-of-the-art content filters. Finally, we propose RSP-M, a lightweight runtime monitor that calculates RSV metrics in real-time and triggers alerts when values exceed safety thresholds. Our work demonstrates that reasoning style is a distinct, exploitable vulnerability, necessitating process-level defenses beyond static content analysis.

### Seismology modeling agent: A smart assistant for geophysical researchers
**Authors**: Yukun Ren, Siwei Yu, Kai Chen, Jianwei Ma

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T14:18:26Z

**Summary**: To address the steep learning curve and reliance on complex manual file editing and command-line operations in the traditional workflow of the mainstream open-source seismic wave simulation software SPECFEM, this paper proposes an intelligent, interactive workflow powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). We introduce the first Model Context Protocol (MCP) server suite for SPECFEM (supporting 2D, 3D Cartesian, and 3D Globe versions), which decomposes the entire simulation process into discrete, agent-executable tools spanning from parameter generation and mesh partitioning to solver execution and visualization. This approach enables a paradigm shift from file-driven to intent-driven conversational interactions. The framework supports both fully automated execution and human-in-the-loop collaboration, allowing researchers to guide simulation strategies in real time and retain scientific decision-making authority while significantly reducing tedious low-level operations. Validated through multiple case studies, the workflow operates seamlessly in both autonomous and interactive modes, yielding high-fidelity results consistent with standard baselines. As the first application of MCP technology to computational seismology, this study significantly lowers the entry barrier, enhances reproducibility, and offers a promising avenue for advancing computational geophysics toward AI-assisted and automated scientific research.

### Effect of Document Packing on the Latent Multi-Hop Reasoning Capabilities of Large Language Models
**Authors**: Gabriele Prato, Shagun Sodhani, Alessandro Sordoni, Sarath Chandar

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T14:16:23Z

**Summary**: The standard practice for training large language models involves packing multiple documents together to optimize computational efficiency. However, the impact of this process on the models' capabilities remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we investigate how different document-packing strategies influence the latent multi-hop reasoning abilities of LLMs. Our findings indicate that packing can improve model performance compared to training on individual documents, at the expense of more compute. To further understand the underlying mechanisms, we conduct an ablation study, identifying key factors that explain the advantages of packing. Ultimately, our research deepens the understanding of LLM training dynamics and provides practical insights for optimizing model development.

### MSTN: Fast and Efficient Multivariate Time Series Prediction Model
**Authors**: Sumit S Shevtekar, Chandresh K Maurya

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T14:06:33Z

**Summary**: Real-world time series often exhibit strong non-stationarity, complex nonlinear dynamics, and behaviour expressed across multiple temporal scales, from rapid local fluctuations to slow-evolving long-range trends. However, many contemporary architectures impose rigid, fixed-scale structural priors -- such as patch-based tokenization, predefined receptive fields, or frozen backbone encoders -- which can over-regularize temporal dynamics and limit adaptability to abrupt high-magnitude events. To handle this, we introduce the \emph{Multi-scale Temporal Network} (MSTN), a hybrid neural architecture grounded in an \emph{Early Temporal Aggregation} principle. MSTN integrates three complementary components: (i) a multi-scale convolutional encoder that captures fine-grained local structure; (ii) a sequence modeling module that learns long-range dependencies through either recurrent or attention-based mechanisms; and (iii) a self-gated fusion stage incorporating squeeze-excitation and multi-head attention to dynamically modulate cross-scale representations. This design enables MSTN to flexibly model temporal patterns spanning milliseconds to extended horizons, while avoiding the computational burden typically associated with long-context models. Across extensive benchmarks covering forecasting, imputation, classification, and cross-dataset generalization, MSTN consistently delivers state-of-the-art performance, outperforming recent leading approaches including TIME-LLM, HiMTM, SOFTS, LLM4TS, TimesNet, and PatchTST, and establishing new best results on 24 out of 32 datasets. Despite its strong performance, MSTN remains lightweight and supports fast inference, making it well suited for deployment on edge devices and resource-constrained environments.

### PortAgent: LLM-driven Vehicle Dispatching Agent for Port Terminals
**Authors**: Jia Hu, Junqi Li, Weimeng Lin, Peng Jia, Yuxiong Ji, Jintao Lai

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T14:04:50Z

**Summary**: Vehicle Dispatching Systems (VDSs) are critical to the operational efficiency of Automated Container Terminals (ACTs). However, their widespread commercialization is hindered due to their low transferability across diverse terminals. This transferability challenge stems from three limitations: high reliance on port operational specialists, a high demand for terminal-specific data, and time-consuming manual deployment processes. Leveraging the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs), this paper proposes PortAgent, an LLM-driven vehicle dispatching agent that fully automates the VDS transferring workflow. It bears three features: (1) no need for port operations specialists; (2) low need of data; and (3) fast deployment. Specifically, specialist dependency is eliminated by the Virtual Expert Team (VET). The VET collaborates with four virtual experts, including a Knowledge Retriever, Modeler, Coder, and Debugger, to emulate a human expert team for the VDS transferring workflow. These experts specialize in the domain of terminal VDS via a few-shot example learning approach. Through this approach, the experts are able to learn VDS-domain knowledge from a few VDS examples. These examples are retrieved via a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mechanism, mitigating the high demand for terminal-specific data. Furthermore, an automatic VDS design workflow is established among these experts to avoid extra manual interventions. In this workflow, a self-correction loop inspired by the LLM Reflexion framework is created

### Synthetic Data Pipelines for Adaptive, Mission-Ready Militarized Humanoids
**Authors**: Mohammed Ayman Habib, Aldo Petruzzelli

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T13:54:34Z

**Summary**: Omnia presents a synthetic data driven pipeline to accelerate the training, validation, and deployment readiness of militarized humanoids. The approach converts first-person spatial observations captured from point-of-view recordings, smart glasses, augmented reality headsets, and spatial browsing workflows into scalable, mission-specific synthetic datasets for humanoid autonomy. By generating large volumes of high-fidelity simulated scenarios and pairing them with automated labeling and model training, the pipeline enables rapid iteration on perception, navigation, and decision-making capabilities without the cost, risk, or time constraints of extensive field trials. The resulting datasets can be tuned quickly for new operational environments and threat conditions, supporting both baseline humanoid performance and advanced subsystems such as multimodal sensing, counter-detection survivability, and CBRNE-relevant reconnaissance behaviors. This work targets faster development cycles and improved robustness in complex, contested settings by exposing humanoid systems to broad scenario diversity early in the development process.

### GRAFT: Grid-Aware Load Forecasting with Multi-Source Textual Alignment and Fusion
**Authors**: Fangzhou Lin, Guoshun He, Zhenyu Guo, Zhe Huang, Jinsong Tao

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T13:38:22Z

**Summary**: Electric load is simultaneously affected across multiple time scales by exogenous factors such as weather and calendar rhythms, sudden events, and policies. Therefore, this paper proposes GRAFT (GRid-Aware Forecasting with Text), which modifies and improves STanHOP to better support grid-aware forecasting and multi-source textual interventions. Specifically, GRAFT strictly aligns daily-aggregated news, social media, and policy texts with half-hour load, and realizes text-guided fusion to specific time positions via cross-attention during both training and rolling forecasting. In addition, GRAFT provides a plug-and-play external-memory interface to accommodate different information sources in real-world deployment. We construct and release a unified aligned benchmark covering 2019--2021 for five Australian states (half-hour load, daily-aligned weather/calendar variables, and three categories of external texts), and conduct systematic, reproducible evaluations at three scales -- hourly, daily, and monthly -- under a unified protocol for comparison across regions, external sources, and time scales. Experimental results show that GRAFT significantly outperforms strong baselines and reaches or surpasses the state of the art across multiple regions and forecasting horizons. Moreover, the model is robust in event-driven scenarios and enables temporal localization and source-level interpretation of text-to-load effects through attention read-out. We release the benchmark, preprocessing scripts, and forecasting results to facilitate standardized empirical evaluation and reproducibility in power grid load forecasting.

### Massive Editing for Large Language Models Based on Dynamic Weight Generation
**Authors**: Wentao Wan, Qiqing Lao, Zhiwei Xie, Hefeng Wu, Runnan Lin, Liang Lin, Keze Wang

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T13:32:55Z

**Summary**: Knowledge Editing (KE) is a field that studies how to modify some knowledge in Large Language Models (LLMs) at a low cost (compared to pre-training). Currently, performing large-scale edits on LLMs while ensuring the Reliability, Generality, and Locality metrics of the edits remain a challenge. This paper proposes a Massive editing approach for LLMs based on dynamic weight Generation (MeG). Our MeG involves attaching a dynamic weight neuron to specific layers of the LLMs and using a diffusion model to conditionally generate the weights of this neuron based on the input query required for the knowledge. This allows the use of adding a single dynamic weight neuron to achieve the goal of large-scale knowledge editing. Experiments show that our MeG can significantly improve the performance of large-scale KE in terms of Reliability, Generality, and Locality metrics compared to existing knowledge editing methods, particularly with a high percentage point increase in the absolute value index for the Locality metric, demonstrating the advantages of our proposed method.

### Terahertz Signal Coverage Enhancement in Hall Scenarios Based on Single-Hop and Dual-Hop Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces
**Authors**: Ben Chen, Zhangdui Zhong, Ke Guan, Danping He, Yiran Wang, Jianwen Ding, Qi Luo

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T13:32:40Z

**Summary**: Terahertz (THz) communication offers ultra-high data rates and has emerged as a promising technology for future wireless networks. However, the inherently high free-space path loss of THz waves significantly limits the coverage range of THz communication systems. Therefore, extending the effective coverage area is a key challenge for the practical deployment of THz networks. Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), which can dynamically manipulate electromagnetic wave propagation, provide a solution to enhance THz coverage. To investigate multi-RIS deployment scenarios, this work integrates an antenna array-based RIS model into the ray-tracing simulation platform. Using an indoor hall as a representative case study, the enhancement effects of single-hop and dual-hop RIS configurations on indoor signal coverage are evaluated under various deployment schemes. The developed framework offers valuable insights and design references for optimizing RIS-assisted indoor THz communication and coverage estimation.

### RePo: Language Models with Context Re-Positioning
**Authors**: Huayang Li, Tianyu Zhao, Richard Sproat

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T13:30:30Z

**Summary**: In-context learning is fundamental to modern Large Language Models (LLMs); however, prevailing architectures impose a rigid and fixed contextual structure by assigning linear or constant positional indices. Drawing on Cognitive Load Theory (CLT), we argue that this uninformative structure increases extraneous cognitive load, consuming finite working memory capacity that should be allocated to deep reasoning and attention allocation. To address this, we propose RePo, a novel mechanism that reduces extraneous load via context re-positioning. Unlike standard approaches, RePo utilizes a differentiable module, $f_φ$, to assign token positions that capture contextual dependencies, rather than replying on pre-defined integer range. By continually pre-training on the OLMo-2 1B backbone, we demonstrate that RePo significantly enhances performance on tasks involving noisy contexts, structured data, and longer context length, while maintaining competitive performance on general short-context tasks. Detailed analysis reveals that RePo successfully allocate higher attention to distant but relevant information, assign positions in dense and non-linear space, and capture the intrinsic structure of the input context.

### HQ-DM: Single Hadamard Transformation-Based Quantization-Aware Training for Low-Bit Diffusion Models
**Authors**: Shizhuo Mao, Hongtao Zou, Qihu Xie, Song Chen, Yi Kang

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T13:29:08Z

**Summary**: Diffusion models have demonstrated significant applications in the field of image generation. However, their high computational and memory costs pose challenges for deployment. Model quantization has emerged as a promising solution to reduce storage overhead and accelerate inference. Nevertheless, existing quantization methods for diffusion models struggle to mitigate outliers in activation matrices during inference, leading to substantial performance degradation under low-bit quantization scenarios. To address this, we propose HQ-DM, a novel Quantization-Aware Training framework that applies Single Hadamard Transformation to activation matrices. This approach effectively reduces activation outliers while preserving model performance under quantization. Compared to traditional Double Hadamard Transformation, our proposed scheme offers distinct advantages by seamlessly supporting INT convolution operations while preventing the amplification of weight outliers. For conditional generation on the ImageNet 256x256 dataset using the LDM-4 model, our W4A4 and W4A3 quantization schemes improve the Inception Score by 12.8% and 467.73%, respectively, over the existing state-of-the-art method.

### Towards Real Time Control of Water Engineering with Nonlinear Hyperbolic Partial Differential Equations
**Authors**: Fabio DiFonzo, Michael Holst, Morteza Kimiaei, Vyacheslav Kungurtsev, Songqiang Qiu

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T13:26:34Z

**Summary**: This paper examines aspirational requirements for software addressing mixed-integer optimization problems constrained by the nonlinear Shallow Water partial differential equations (PDEs), motivated by applications such as river-flow management in hydropower cascades. Realistic deployment of such software would require the simultaneous treatment of nonlinear and potentially non-smooth PDE dynamics, limited theoretical guarantees on the existence and regularity of control-to-state mappings under varying boundary conditions, and computational performance compatible with operational decision-making. In addition, practical settings motivate consideration of uncertainty arising from forecasts of demand, inflows, and environmental conditions. At present, the theoretical foundations, numerical optimization methods, and large-scale scientific computing tools required to address these challenges in a unified and tractable manner remain the subject of ongoing research across the associated research communities. Rather than proposing a complete solution, this work uses the problem as a case study to identify and organize the mathematical, algorithmic, and computational components that would be necessary for its realization. The resulting framework highlights open challenges and intermediate research directions, and may inform both more circumscribed related problems and the design of future large-scale collaborative efforts aimed at addressing such objectives.

### Security analysis of orthogonal state attack on a high-speed quantum key distribution system
**Authors**: Jialei Su, Jialin Chen, Fengyu Lu, Zihao Chen, Junxuan Liu, Deyong He, Shuang Wang, Anqi Huang

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T12:46:50Z

**Summary**: High-speed quantum key distribution (QKD) systems have achieved repetition frequencies above gigahertz through advanced technologies and devices, laying an important foundation for the deployment of high-key-rate QKD system. Although these advanced systems may introduce potential loopholes, an eavesdropper Eve is challenging to exploit them by performing the intercept-resend attacks due to the limited time window under high repetition frequency. However, here, we propose a security analysis model of orthogonal state attacks that do not require intercept-resend operation on the key rate of a QKD system. Under this framework, we propose a muted attack and experimentally verify the feasibility of the attack using a 1 GHz single-photon avalanche detector (SPAD). By sending hundreds of photons each time, Eve can mute Bob's SPADs to control the overall detection response of the QKD receiver, allowing her to learn nearly all the keys. Furthermore, we use this security model to simulate the overestimated key rates of the QKD system under orthogonal state attacks, including both the muted attack and the dead-time attack. This work theoretically and experimentally shows a timely case of the security vulnerability in the high-speed QKD system.

### Temporal interference stimulation for deep brain neuromodulation in humans
**Authors**: Pierre Vassiliadis, Elena Beanato, Maximilian J. Wessel, Friedhelm C. Hummel

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T12:38:11Z

**Summary**: For decades, focal non-invasive neuromodulation of deep brain regions has not been possible because of the steep depth-focality trade-off of conventional non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) or classical transcranial electric stimulation (tES). Deep brain stimulation has therefore largely relied on invasive approaches in clinical populations, requiring surgery. Transcranial Temporal Interference Stimulation (tTIS) has recently emerged as a promising method to overcome this challenge and allows for the first time focal non-invasive electrical deep brain stimulation. The method, which was first validated through computational modeling and rodent work, has now been successfully translated to humans to target deep brain regions such as the hippocampus or striatum. In this Perspective, we present current evidence for tTIS-based neuromodulation, underlying mechanisms and discuss future developments of this promising technology. More specifically, we highlight key opportunities and challenges for fundamental neuroscience as well as for the design of new interventions in neuropsychiatric disorders. We also discuss the status of understanding and challenges regarding the basic mechanisms of action of tTIS and possible lines of technological innovation to optimize stimulation, in particular in terms of intensity and focality. Overall, we suggest that following the first proof-of-concepts, an important multidisciplinary research effort is now required to further validate the use of tTIS in multiple applications, understand its underlying principles and optimize the technology in the view of a wider scientific and clinical deployment.

### TiCard: Deployable EXPLAIN-only Residual Learning for Cardinality Estimation
**Authors**: Qizhi Wang

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T12:35:11Z

**Summary**: Cardinality estimation is a key bottleneck for cost-based query optimization, yet deployable improvements remain difficult: classical estimators miss correlations, while learned estimators often require workload-specific training pipelines and invasive integration into the optimizer. This paper presents TiCard, a low intrusion, correction-based framework that augments (rather than replaces) a database's native estimator. TiCard learns multiplicative residual corrections using EXPLAIN-only features, and uses EXPLAIN ANALYZE only for offline labels. We study two practical instantiations: (i) a Gradient Boosting Regressor for sub-millisecond inference, and (ii) TabPFN, an in-context tabular foundation model that adapts by refreshing a small reference set without gradient retraining. On TiDB with TPCH and the Join Order Benchmark, in a low-trace setting (263 executions total; 157 used for learning), TiCard improves operator-level tail accuracy substantially: P90 Q-error drops from 312.85 (native) to 13.69 (TiCard-GBR), and P99 drops from 37,974.37 to 3,416.50 (TiCard-TabPFN), while a join-only policy preserves near-perfect median behavior. We position TiCard as an AI4DB building block focused on deployability: explicit scope, conservative integration policies, and an integration roadmap from offline correction to in-optimizer use.

### Sparse OFDM Design for Interference and Ambiguity Mitigation in Multi-Static ISAC
**Authors**: Navid Amani, Priyanka Maity, Musa Furkan Keskin, Henk Wymeersch

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T12:34:40Z

**Summary**: The sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks promises the integration of radar-like sensing capabilities into communication infrastructure. In this paper, we investigate a multi-static sensing framework where half-duplex base stations (BSs) are assigned as either transmitter or sensing receiver nodes. We propose a randomized sparse resource allocation scheme based on orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) waveform design tailored for the multi-static scenario to simultaneously mitigate inter-BS interference (IBI) and sensing ambiguities. The waveform design also ensures robustness against inter-symbol interference (ISI) and intercarrier interference (ICI) via a judicious choice of subcarrier spacing according to the deployment of BSs. The potential ambiguity caused by sparse signaling is addressed through controlled irregularity in both time and frequency domains, with a negligible noise floor elevation. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and resilience of the proposed design in the presence of multiple targets and clutter.

### User Localization and Channel Estimation for Pinching-Antenna Systems (PASS)
**Authors**: Xiaoxia Xu, Xidong Mu, Yuanwei Liu, Hong Xing, Arumugam Nallanathan

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T12:27:58Z

**Summary**: This letter proposes a novel user localization and channel estimation framework for pinching-antenna systems (PASS), where pinching antennas are grouped into subarrays on each waveguide to cooperatively estimate user/scatterer locations, thus reconstructing channels. Both single-waveguide (SW) and multi-waveguide (MW) structures are considered. SW consists of multiple alternatingly activated subarrays, while MW deploys one subarray on each waveguide to enable concurrent subarray measurements. For the 2D scenarios with a fixed user/scatter height, an orthogonal matching pursuit-based geometry-consistent localization (OMP-GCL) algorithm is proposed, which leverages inter-subarray geometric relationships and compressed sensing for precise estimation. Theoretical analysis on Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) demonstrates that: 1) The estimation accuracy can be improved by increasing the geometric diversity through multi-subarray deployment; and 2) SW provides a limited geometric diversity within a $180^\circ$ half space and leads to angle ambiguity, while MW enables full-space observations and reduces overheads. The OMP-GCL algorithm is further extended to 3D scenarios, where user and scatter heights are also estimated. Numerical results validate the theoretical analysis, and verify that MW achieves centimeter- and decimeter-level localization accuracy in 2D and 3D scenarios with only three waveguides.

### Fine-Tuning of Neural Network Approximate MPC without Retraining via Bayesian Optimization
**Authors**: Henrik Hose, Paul Brunzema, Alexander von Rohr, Alexander Gräfe, Angela P. Schoellig, Sebastian Trimpe

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T12:24:08Z

**Summary**: Approximate model-predictive control (AMPC) aims to imitate an MPC's behavior with a neural network, removing the need to solve an expensive optimization problem at runtime. However, during deployment, the parameters of the underlying MPC must usually be fine-tuned. This often renders AMPC impractical as it requires repeatedly generating a new dataset and retraining the neural network. Recent work addresses this problem by adapting AMPC without retraining using approximated sensitivities of the MPC's optimization problem. Currently, this adaption must be done by hand, which is labor-intensive and can be unintuitive for high-dimensional systems. To solve this issue, we propose using Bayesian optimization to tune the parameters of AMPC policies based on experimental data. By combining model-based control with direct and local learning, our approach achieves superior performance to nominal AMPC on hardware, with minimal experimentation. This allows automatic and data-efficient adaptation of AMPC to new system instances and fine-tuning to cost functions that are difficult to directly implement in MPC. We demonstrate the proposed method in hardware experiments for the swing-up maneuver on an inverted cartpole and yaw control of an under-actuated balancing unicycle robot, a challenging control problem.

### MindForge: Empowering Embodied Agents with Theory of Mind for Lifelong Cultural Learning
**Authors**: Mircea Lică, Ojas Shirekar, Baptiste Colle, Chirag Raman

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T12:21:25Z

**Summary**: Embodied agents powered by large language models (LLMs), such as Voyager, promise open-ended competence in worlds such as Minecraft. However, when powered by open-weight LLMs they still falter on elementary tasks after domain-specific fine-tuning. We propose MindForge, a generative-agent framework for cultural lifelong learning through explicit perspective taking. We introduce three key innovations: (1) a structured theory of mind representation linking percepts, beliefs, desires, and actions; (2) natural inter-agent communication; and (3) a multi-component memory system. Following the cultural learning framework, we test MindForge in both instructive and collaborative settings within Minecraft. In an instructive setting with GPT-4, MindForge agents powered by open-weight LLMs significantly outperform their Voyager counterparts in basic tasks yielding $3\times$ more tech-tree milestones and collecting $2.3\times$ more unique items than the Voyager baseline. Furthermore, in fully \textit{collaborative} settings, we find that the performance of two underachieving agents improves with more communication rounds, echoing the Condorcet Jury Theorem. MindForge agents demonstrate sophisticated behaviors, including expert-novice knowledge transfer, collaborative problem solving, and adaptation to out-of-distribution tasks through accumulated cultural experiences.

### One Battle After Another: Probing LLMs' Limits on Multi-Turn Instruction Following with a Benchmark Evolving Framework
**Authors**: Qi Jia, Ye Shen, Xiujie Song, Kaiwei Zhang, Shibo Wang, Dun Pei, Xiangyang Zhu, Guangtao Zhai

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T12:11:36Z

**Summary**: Evaluating LLMs' instruction-following ability in multi-topic dialogues is essential yet challenging. Existing benchmarks are limited to a fixed number of turns, susceptible to saturation and failing to account for users' interactive experience. In this work, we propose a novel framework backed by a three-layer tracking mechanism and a query synthesis agent to mimic sequential user behaviors. Incorporating Flow Theory, we introduce process-centric metrics and terminate a conversational evaluation only upon exhausting user patience. Upon this framework, we present EvolIF, an evolving benchmark covering 12 constraint groups. Results indicate that GPT-5 excels, sustaining 14 turns with 66.40% robustness. It outperforms Gemini-3.0-Pro by a margin of 5.59%, while other models trail behind. Resources are available at https://github.com/JiaQiSJTU/EvolvingInstructionFollowing.

### DART: Difficulty-Adaptive Reasoning Truncation for Efficient Large Language Models
**Authors**: Ruofan Zhang, Bin Xia, Zhen Cheng, Cairen Jian, Minglun Yang, Ngai Wong, Yuan Cheng

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T12:09:10Z

**Summary**: Adaptive reasoning is essential for aligning the computational effort of large language models (LLMs) with the intrinsic difficulty of problems. Current chain-of-thought methods boost reasoning ability but indiscriminately generate long explanations, leading to evident inefficiency. However, existing reinforcement learning approaches to adaptive thinking remain unstable and heavily reward-dependent. Here we propose \textbf{DART}, a supervised \textbf{D}ifficulty-\textbf{A}daptive \textbf{R}easoning \textbf{T}runcation framework that adjusts thinking length according to problem difficulty. By distilling concise reasoning patterns from stronger models, interpolating them into a continuum of reasoning styles, and curating optimal training data that balances correctness and compactness, DART learns when to ``stop thinking''. Across multiple mathematical benchmarks, experimental results demonstrate its remarkable efficiency while preserving or improving accuracy, achieving a significant 81.2\% reasoning truncation (DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B on GSM8K dataset) with 5.33$\times$ computational acceleration. DART provides a stable and general paradigm for efficient reasoning, advancing the development of adaptive intelligence in LLMs.

### FUSION: Forecast-Embedded Agent Scheduling with Service Incentive Optimization over Distributed Air-Ground Edge Networks
**Authors**: Houyi Qi, Minghui Liwang, Seyyedali Hosseinalipour, Liqun Fu, Sai Zou, Xianbin Wang, Wei Ni, Yiguang Hong

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T11:41:39Z

**Summary**: We investigate a forecasting-driven, incentive-compatible service provisioning framework for distributed air-ground integrated edge networks under human-machine coexistence. We consider hybrid players where the computing capacity of edge servers (ESs) are augmented by vehicular-UAV agent pairs (AgPs) that can be proactively dispatched to overloaded hotspots. Unique key challenges should be addressed: highly uncertain spatio-temporal workloads, spatio-temporal coupling between road traffic and UAV capacity, forecast-driven contracting risks, and heterogeneous quality-of-service (QoS) requirements of human users (HuUs) and machine users (MaUs). To cope with these issues, we propose FUSION, a two-stage framework that tightly couples service demand prediction, agent deployment, and task scheduling. In the offline stage, a Pro-LNN module performs intelligent multi-step spatio-temporal demand forecasting at distributed ESs, whose outputs are exploited by an enhanced ant colony optimization-based routing scheme (eACO-VRP) and an auction-based incentive-compatible contracting mechanism (Off-AIC^2), to jointly determine ES-AgP contracts and pre-planned service routes. In the online stage, we formulate congestion-aware task scheduling as an potential game among HuUs, MaUs, and heterogeneous ES/UAV providers, and devise a potential-guided best-response dynamics (PG-BR) algorithm that provably converges to a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world traces show that FUSION significantly improves social welfare, latency, resource utilization, and robustness compared with state-of-the-art baselines.

### Inflation Attitudes of Large Language Models
**Authors**: Nikoleta Anesti, Edward Hill, Andreas Joseph

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T11:21:46Z

**Summary**: This paper investigates the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically GPT-3.5-turbo (GPT), to form inflation perceptions and expectations based on macroeconomic price signals. We compare the LLM's output to household survey data and official statistics, mimicking the information set and demographic characteristics of the Bank of England's Inflation Attitudes Survey (IAS). Our quasi-experimental design exploits the timing of GPT's training cut-off in September 2021 which means it has no knowledge of the subsequent UK inflation surge. We find that GPT tracks aggregate survey projections and official statistics at short horizons. At a disaggregated level, GPT replicates key empirical regularities of households' inflation perceptions, particularly for income, housing tenure, and social class. A novel Shapley value decomposition of LLM outputs suited for the synthetic survey setting provides well-defined insights into the drivers of model outputs linked to prompt content. We find that GPT demonstrates a heightened sensitivity to food inflation information similar to that of human respondents. However, we also find that it lacks a consistent model of consumer price inflation. More generally, our approach could be used to evaluate the behaviour of LLMs for use in the social sciences, to compare different models, or to assist in survey design.

### Efficient Adaptive Rejection Sampling for Accelerating Speculative Decoding in Large Language Models
**Authors**: Chendong Sun, mingmin Chen, Lei Xu

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T11:09:35Z

**Summary**: Speculative Decoding is a prominent technique for accelerating the autoregressive inference of large language models (LLMs) by employing a fast draft model to propose candidate token sequences and a large target model to verify them in parallel. However, its core component -- the rejection sampling mechanism -- relies on a fixed, context-independent random threshold. This leads to a significant "random rejection" problem in high-uncertainty generation scenarios, where plausible candidate tokens are frequently rejected due to random chance, undermining inference efficiency. This paper introduces Efficient Adaptive Rejection Sampling (EARS), a novel method that dynamically adjusts the acceptance threshold by incorporating the target model's own predictive uncertainty, measured as 1 - max(P_target). By introducing a tolerance term proportional to this uncertainty, EARS intelligently relaxes the acceptance criterion when the model is uncertain, effectively reducing random rejections while maintaining strict standards when the model is confident. Experiments on creative writing and open-domain QA tasks demonstrate that EARS significantly enhances the efficiency of speculative decoding, achieving up to an 18.12% increase in throughput with a negligible 0.84% accuracy drop on the GSM8K benchmark. The method requires no modifications to model architectures and can be seamlessly integrated into existing speculative decoding frameworks.

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T11:04:41Z

**Summary**: This work proposes GLM-TTS, a production-level TTS system designed for efficiency, controllability, and high-fidelity speech generation. GLM-TTS follows a two-stage architecture, consisting of a text-to-token autoregressive model and a token-to-waveform diffusion model. With only 100k hours of training data, GLM-TTS achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple open-source benchmarks. To meet production requirements, GLM-TTS improves speech quality through an optimized speech tokenizer with fundamental frequency constraints and a GRPO-based multi-reward reinforcement learning framework that jointly optimizes pronunciation, speaker similarity, and expressive prosody. In parallel, the system enables efficient and controllable deployment via parameter-efficient LoRA-based voice customization and a hybrid phoneme-text input scheme that provides precise pronunciation control. Our code is available at https://github.com/zai-org/GLM-TTS. Real-time speech synthesis demos are provided via Z.ai (audio.z.ai), the Zhipu Qingyan app/web (chatglm.cn).

### Leveraging LLMs for Collaborative Ontology Engineering in Parkinson Disease Monitoring and Alerting
**Authors**: Georgios Bouchouras, Dimitrios Doumanas, Andreas Soularidis, Konstantinos Kotis, George A. Vouros

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T10:58:26Z

**Summary**: This paper explores the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the engineering of a Parkinson's Disease (PD) monitoring and alerting ontology through four key methodologies: One Shot (OS) prompt techniques, Chain of Thought (CoT) prompts, X-HCOME, and SimX-HCOME+. The primary objective is to determine whether LLMs alone can create comprehensive ontologies and, if not, whether human-LLM collaboration can achieve this goal. Consequently, the paper assesses the effectiveness of LLMs in automated ontology development and the enhancement achieved through human-LLM collaboration.   Initial ontology generation was performed using One Shot (OS) and Chain of Thought (CoT) prompts, demonstrating the capability of LLMs to autonomously construct ontologies for PD monitoring and alerting. However, these outputs were not comprehensive and required substantial human refinement to enhance their completeness and accuracy.   X-HCOME, a hybrid ontology engineering approach that combines human expertise with LLM capabilities, showed significant improvements in ontology comprehensiveness. This methodology resulted in ontologies that are very similar to those constructed by experts.   Further experimentation with SimX-HCOME+, another hybrid methodology emphasizing continuous human supervision and iterative refinement, highlighted the importance of ongoing human involvement. This approach led to the creation of more comprehensive and accurate ontologies.   Overall, the paper underscores the potential of human-LLM collaboration in advancing ontology engineering, particularly in complex domains like PD. The results suggest promising directions for future research, including the development of specialized GPT models for ontology construction.

### Robust Design for Multi-Antenna LEO Satellite Communications with Fractional Delay and Doppler Shifts: An RSMA-OTFS Approach
**Authors**: Yunnuo Xu, Yumeng Zhang, Yijie Mao, Bruno Clerck, Yun Hee Kim, Yujun Li

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T10:56:28Z

**Summary**: Low-Earth-orbit (LEO) satellite communication systems face challenges due to high satellite mobility, which hinders the reliable acquisition of instantaneous channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) and subsequently degrades multi-user transmission performance. This paper investigates a downlink multi-user multi-antenna system, and tackles the above challenges by introducing orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation and rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) transmission. Specifically, OTFS enables stable characterization of time-varying channels by representing them in the delay-Doppler domain. However, realistic propagation introduces various inter-symbol and inter-user interference due to non-orthogonal yet practical rectangular pulse shaping, fractional delays, Doppler shifts, and imperfect (statistical) CSIT. In this context, RSMA offers promising robustness for interference mitigation and CSIT imperfections, and hence is integrated with OTFS to provide a comprehensive solution. A compact cross-domain input-output relationship for RSMA-OTFS is established, and an ergodic sum-rate maximization problem is formulated and solved using a weighted minimum mean-square-error based alternating optimization algorithm that does not depend on channel sparsity. Simulation results reveal that the considered practical propagation effects significantly degrade performance if unaddressed. Furthermore, the RSMA-OTFS scheme demonstrates improved ergodic sum-rate and robustness against CSIT uncertainty across various user deployments and CSIT qualities.

### SPARQL-LLM: Real-Time SPARQL Query Generation from Natural Language Questions
**Authors**: Panayiotis Smeros, Vincent Emonet, Ruijie Wang, Ana-Claudia Sima, Tarcisio Mendes de Farias

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T10:39:46Z

**Summary**: The advent of large language models is contributing to the emergence of novel approaches that promise to better tackle the challenge of generating structured queries, such as SPARQL queries, from natural language. However, these new approaches mostly focus on response accuracy over a single source while ignoring other evaluation criteria, such as federated query capability over distributed data stores, as well as runtime and cost to generate SPARQL queries. Consequently, they are often not production-ready or easy to deploy over (potentially federated) knowledge graphs with good accuracy. To mitigate these issues, in this paper, we extend our previous work and describe and systematically evaluate SPARQL-LLM, an open-source and triplestore-agnostic approach, powered by lightweight metadata, that generates SPARQL queries from natural language text. First, we describe its architecture, which consists of dedicated components for metadata indexing, prompt building, and query generation and execution. Then, we evaluate it based on a state-of-the-art challenge with multilingual questions, and a collection of questions from three of the most prevalent knowledge graphs within the field of bioinformatics. Our results demonstrate a substantial increase of 24% in the F1 Score on the state-of-the-art challenge, adaptability to high-resource languages such as English and Spanish, as well as ability to form complex and federated bioinformatics queries. Furthermore, we show that SPARQL-LLM is up to 36x faster than other systems participating in the challenge, while costing a maximum of $0.01 per question, making it suitable for real-time, low-cost text-to-SPARQL applications. One such application deployed over real-world decentralized knowledge graphs can be found at https://www.expasy.org/chat.

### Cog-RAG: Cognitive-Inspired Dual-Hypergraph with Theme Alignment Retrieval-Augmented Generation
**Authors**: Hao Hu, Yifan Feng, Ruoxue Li, Rundong Xue, Xingliang Hou, Zhiqiang Tian, Yue Gao, Shaoyi Du

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T10:39:35Z

**Summary**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances the response quality and domain-specific performance of large language models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge to combat hallucinations. In recent research, graph structures have been integrated into RAG to enhance the capture of semantic relations between entities. However, it primarily focuses on low-order pairwise entity relations, limiting the high-order associations among multiple entities. Hypergraph-enhanced approaches address this limitation by modeling multi-entity interactions via hyperedges, but they are typically constrained to inter-chunk entity-level representations, overlooking the global thematic organization and alignment across chunks. Drawing inspiration from the top-down cognitive process of human reasoning, we propose a theme-aligned dual-hypergraph RAG framework (Cog-RAG) that uses a theme hypergraph to capture inter-chunk thematic structure and an entity hypergraph to model high-order semantic relations. Furthermore, we design a cognitive-inspired two-stage retrieval strategy that first activates query-relevant thematic content from the theme hypergraph, and then guides fine-grained recall and diffusion in the entity hypergraph, achieving semantic alignment and consistent generation from global themes to local details. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that Cog-RAG significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art baseline approaches.

### Language Self-Play For Data-Free Training
**Authors**: Jakub Grudzien Kuba, Mengting Gu, Qi Ma, Yuandong Tian, Vijai Mohan, Jason Chen

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T10:22:20Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced rapidly in recent years, driven by scale, abundant high-quality training data, and reinforcement learning. Yet this progress faces a fundamental bottleneck: the need for ever more data from which models can continue to learn. In this work, we propose a reinforcement learning approach that removes this dependency by enabling models to improve without additional data. Our method leverages a game-theoretic framework of self-play, where a model's capabilities are cast as performance in a competitive game and stronger policies emerge by having the model play against itself-a process we call Language Self-Play (LSP). Experiments with Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct on instruction-following, mathematics, and coding benchmarks show that pretrained models can be effectively improved with self-play alone.

### MindDrive: A Vision-Language-Action Model for Autonomous Driving via Online Reinforcement Learning
**Authors**: Haoyu Fu, Diankun Zhang, Zongchuang Zhao, Jianfeng Cui, Hongwei Xie, Bing Wang, Guang Chen, Dingkang Liang, Xiang Bai

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T10:16:04Z

**Summary**: Current Vision-Language-Action (VLA) paradigms in autonomous driving primarily rely on Imitation Learning (IL), which introduces inherent challenges such as distribution shift and causal confusion. Online Reinforcement Learning offers a promising pathway to address these issues through trial-and-error learning. However, applying online reinforcement learning to VLA models in autonomous driving is hindered by inefficient exploration in continuous action spaces. To overcome this limitation, we propose MindDrive, a VLA framework comprising a large language model (LLM) with two distinct sets of LoRA parameters. The one LLM serves as a Decision Expert for scenario reasoning and driving decision-making, while the other acts as an Action Expert that dynamically maps linguistic decisions into feasible trajectories. By feeding trajectory-level rewards back into the reasoning space, MindDrive enables trial-and-error learning over a finite set of discrete linguistic driving decisions, instead of operating directly in a continuous action space. This approach effectively balances optimal decision-making in complex scenarios, human-like driving behavior, and efficient exploration in online reinforcement learning. Using the lightweight Qwen-0.5B LLM, MindDrive achieves Driving Score (DS) of 78.04 and Success Rate (SR) of 55.09% on the challenging Bench2Drive benchmark. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to demonstrate the effectiveness of online reinforcement learning for the VLA model in autonomous driving.

### Integrated Wind Farm Design: Optimizing Turbine Placement and Cable Routing with Wake Effects
**Authors**: Jaap Pedersen, Niels Lindner, Daniel Rehfeldt, Thorsten Koch

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T10:15:34Z

**Summary**: An accelerated deployment of renewable energy sources is crucial for a successful transformation of the current energy system, with wind energy playing a key role in this transition. This study addresses the integrated wind farm layout and cable routing problem, a challenging nonlinear optimization problem. We model this problem as an extended version of the quota Steiner tree problem (QSTP), optimizing turbine placement and network connectivity simultaneously to meet specified expansion targets. Our proposed approach accounts for the wake effect $-$ a region of reduced wind speed induced by each installed turbine $-$ and enforces minimum spacing between turbines. We introduce an exact solution framework in terms of the novel quota Steiner tree problem with interference (QSTPI). By leveraging an interference-based splitting strategy, we develop an advanced solver capable of tackling large-scale problem instances. The presented approach outperforms generic state-of-the-art mixed integer programming solvers on our dataset by up to two orders of magnitude. Further, we present a hop-constrained variant of the QSTPI to handle cable capacities in the context of radial topologies. Moreover, we demonstrate that our integrated method significantly reduces the costs in contrast to a sequential approach. Thus, we provide a planning tool that enhances existing planning methodologies for supporting a faster and cost-efficient expansion of wind energy.

### MentraSuite: Post-Training Large Language Models for Mental Health Reasoning and Assessment
**Authors**: Mengxi Xiao, Kailai Yang, Pengde Zhao, Enze Zhang, Ziyan Kuang, Zhiwei Liu, Weiguang Han, Shu Liao, Lianting Huang, Jinpeng Hu, Min Peng, Qianqian Xie, Sophia Ananiadou

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T10:08:59Z

**Summary**: Mental health disorders affect hundreds of millions globally, and the Web now serves as a primary medium for accessing support, information, and assessment. Large language models (LLMs) offer scalable and accessible assistance, yet their deployment in mental-health settings remains risky when their reasoning is incomplete, inconsistent, or ungrounded. Existing psychological LLMs emphasize emotional understanding or knowledge recall but overlook the step-wise, clinically aligned reasoning required for appraisal, diagnosis, intervention planning, abstraction, and verification. To address these issues, we introduce MentraSuite, a unified framework for advancing reliable mental-health reasoning. We propose MentraBench, a comprehensive benchmark spanning five core reasoning aspects, six tasks, and 13 datasets, evaluating both task performance and reasoning quality across five dimensions: conciseness, coherence, hallucination avoidance, task understanding, and internal consistency. We further present Mindora, a post-trained model optimized through a hybrid SFT-RL framework with an inconsistency-detection reward to enforce faithful and coherent reasoning. To support training, we construct high-quality trajectories using a novel reasoning trajectory generation strategy, that strategically filters difficult samples and applies a structured, consistency-oriented rewriting process to produce concise, readable, and well-balanced trajectories. Across 20 evaluated LLMs, Mindora achieves the highest average performance on MentraBench and shows remarkable performances in reasoning reliability, demonstrating its effectiveness for complex mental-health scenarios.

### Enhancing Visual Programming for Visual Reasoning via Probabilistic Graphs
**Authors**: Wentao Wan, Kaiyu Wu, Qingyang Ma, Nan Kang, Yunjie Chen, Liang Lin, Keze Wang

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T10:07:40Z

**Summary**: Recently, Visual Programming (VP) based on large language models (LLMs) has rapidly developed and demonstrated significant potential in complex Visual Reasoning (VR) tasks. Previous works to enhance VP have primarily focused on improving the quality of LLM-generated visual programs. However, they have neglected to optimize the VP-invoked pre-trained models, which serve as modules for the visual sub-tasks decomposed from the targeted tasks by VP. The difficulty is that there are only final labels of targeted VR tasks rather than labels of sub-tasks. Besides, the non-differentiable nature of VP impedes the direct use of efficient gradient-based optimization methods to leverage final labels for end-to-end learning of the entire VP framework. To overcome these issues, we propose EVPG, a method to Enhance Visual Programming for visual reasoning via Probabilistic Graphs. Specifically, we creatively build a directed probabilistic graph according to the variable dependency relationships during the VP executing process, which reconstructs the non-differentiable VP executing process into a differentiable exact probability inference process on this directed probabilistic graph. As a result, this enables the VP framework to utilize the final labels for efficient, gradient-based optimization in end-to-end supervised learning on targeted VR tasks. Extensive and comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of our EVPG, showing significant performance improvements for VP on three classical complex VR tasks: GQA, NLVRv2, and Open Images.

### TEMP: A Memory Efficient Physical-aware Tensor Partition-Mapping Framework on Wafer-scale Chips
**Authors**: Huizheng Wang, Taiquan Wei, Zichuan Wang, Dingcheng Jiang, Qize Yang, Jiaxin Liu, Jingxiang Hou, Chao Li, Jinyi Deng, Yang Hu, Shouyi Yin

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T10:06:47Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) demand significant memory and computation resources. Wafer-scale chips (WSCs) provide high computation power and die-to-die (D2D) bandwidth but face a unique trade-off between on-chip memory and compute resources due to limited wafer area. Therefore, tensor parallelism strategies for wafer should leverage communication advantages while maintaining memory efficiency to maximize WSC performance. However, existing approaches fail to address these challenges.   To address these challenges, we propose the tensor stream partition paradigm (TSPP), which reveals an opportunity to leverage WSCs' abundant communication bandwidth to alleviate stringent on-chip memory constraints. However, the 2D mesh topology of WSCs lacks long-distance and flexible interconnects, leading to three challenges: 1) severe tail latency, 2) prohibitive D2D traffic contention, and 3) intractable search time for optimal design.   We present TEMP, a framework for LLM training on WSCs that leverages topology-aware tensor-stream partition, traffic-conscious mapping, and dual-level wafer solving to overcome hardware constraints and parallelism challenges. These integrated approaches optimize memory efficiency and throughput, unlocking TSPP's full potential on WSCs. Evaluations show TEMP achieves 1.7x average throughput improvement over state-of-the-art LLM training systems across various models.

### From Context to EDUs: Faithful and Structured Context Compression via Elementary Discourse Unit Decomposition
**Authors**: Yiqing Zhou, Yu Lei, Shuzheng Si, Qingyan Sun, Wei Wang, Yifei Wu, Hao Wen, Gang Chen, Fanchao Qi, Maosong Sun

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T09:52:58Z

**Summary**: Managing extensive context remains a critical bottleneck for Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly in applications like long-document question answering and autonomous agents where lengthy inputs incur high computational costs and introduce noise. Existing compression techniques often disrupt local coherence through discrete token removal or rely on implicit latent encoding that suffers from positional bias and incompatibility with closed-source APIs. To address these limitations, we introduce the EDU-based Context Compressor, a novel explicit compression framework designed to preserve both global structure and fine-grained details. Our approach reformulates context compression as a structure-then-select process. First, our LingoEDU transforms linear text into a structural relation tree of Elementary Discourse Units (EDUs) which are anchored strictly to source indices to eliminate hallucination. Second, a lightweight ranking module selects query-relevant sub-trees for linearization. To rigorously evaluate structural understanding, we release StructBench, a manually annotated dataset of 248 diverse documents. Empirical results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art structural prediction accuracy and significantly outperforms frontier LLMs while reducing costs. Furthermore, our structure-aware compression substantially enhances performance across downstream tasks ranging from long-context tasks to complex Deep Search scenarios.

### Two CFG Nahuatl for automatic corpora expansion
**Authors**: Juan-José Guzmán-Landa, Juan-Manuel Torres-Moreno, Miguel Figueroa-Saavedra, Ligia Quintana-Torres, Graham Ranger Martha-Lorena Avendaño-Garrido

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T09:49:31Z

**Summary**: The aim of this article is to introduce two Context-Free Grammars (CFG) for Nawatl Corpora expansion. Nawatl is an Amerindian language (it is a National Language of Mexico) of the $π$-language type, i.e. a language with few digital resources. For this reason the corpora available for the learning of Large Language Models (LLMs) are virtually non-existent, posing a significant challenge. The goal is to produce a substantial number of syntactically valid artificial Nawatl sentences and thereby to expand the corpora for the purpose of learning non contextual embeddings. For this objective, we introduce two new Nawatl CFGs and use them in generative mode. Using these grammars, it is possible to expand Nawatl corpus significantly and subsequently to use it to learn embeddings and to evaluate their relevance in a sentences semantic similarity task. The results show an improvement compared to the results obtained using only the original corpus without artificial expansion, and also demonstrate that economic embeddings often perform better than some LLMs.

### Can AI Understand What We Cannot Say? Measuring Multilevel Alignment Through Abortion Stigma Across Cognitive, Interpersonal, and Structural Levels
**Authors**: Anika Sharma, Malavika Mampally, Chidaksh Ravuru, Kandyce Brennan, Neil Gaikwad

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T09:48:59Z

**Summary**: As large language models increasingly mediate stigmatized health decisions, their capacity to genuinely understand complex psychological and physiological phenomena remains poorly evaluated. Can AI understand what we cannot say? We investigate whether LLMs coherently represent abortion stigma across the cognitive, interpersonal, and structural levels where it operates. We systematically tested 627 demographically diverse personas across five leading LLMs using the validated Individual Level Abortion Stigma Scale (ILAS). Our multilevel analysis examined whether models coherently represent stigma at the cognitive level (self-judgment), interpersonal level (anticipated judgment and isolation), and structural level (community condemnation and disclosure patterns), as well as overall stigma. Models fail tests of genuine understanding across all levels. They overestimate interpersonal stigma while underestimating cognitive stigma, assume uniform community condemnation, introduce demographic biases absent from human validation data, miss the empirically validated stigma-secrecy relationship, and contradict themselves within theoretical constructs. These patterns reveal that current alignment approaches ensure appropriate language but not coherent multilevel understanding. This work provides empirical evidence that current LLMs lack coherent multilevel understanding of psychological and physiological constructs. AI safety in high-stakes contexts demands new approaches to design (multilevel coherence), evaluation (continuous auditing), governance and regulation (mandatory audits, accountability, deployment restrictions), and AI literacy in domains where understanding what people cannot say determines whether support helps or harms.

### Ladder Up, Memory Down: Low-Cost Fine-Tuning With Side Nets
**Authors**: Estelle Zheng, Nathan Cerisara, Sébastien Warichet, Emmanuel Helbert, Christophe Cerisara

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T09:47:34Z

**Summary**: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) is often limited by the memory available on commodity GPUs. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods such as QLoRA reduce the number of trainable parameters, yet still incur high memory usage induced by the backward pass in the full model. We revisit Ladder Side Tuning (LST), a rarely explored PEFT technique that adds a lightweight side network, and show that it matches QLoRA's compute scaling slope while cutting peak memory by 50\%. Across different downstream benchmarks spanning natural language understanding, mathematical and LLM-critic tasks, LST has competitive performance with QLoRA's accuracy on average while being much more memory-efficient. This efficiency enables fine-tuning of 7B-parameter models on a single 12 GB consumer GPU with 2k-token contexts, requiring no gradient checkpointing\textemdash conditions under which QLoRA exhausts memory. Beyond memory efficiency, we also establish scaling laws showing that LST scales similarly to QLoRA. We exploit Ladder's architectural flexibility by introducing xLadder, a depth-extended variant that increases effective depth via cross-connections and shortens chain-of-thought (CoT) at fixed parameter count. Ladder is strong when memory is the bottleneck; xLadder builds on this by enabling deeper reasoning without additional memory overhead.

### Advanced Black-Box Tuning of Large Language Models with Limited API Calls
**Authors**: Zhikang Xie, Weilin Wan, Peizhu Gong, Weizhong Zhang, Cheng Jin

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T09:47:31Z

**Summary**: Black-box tuning is an emerging paradigm for adapting large language models (LLMs) to better achieve desired behaviors, particularly when direct access to model parameters is unavailable. Current strategies, however, often present a dilemma of suboptimal extremes: either separately train a small proxy model and then use it to shift the predictions of the foundation model, offering notable efficiency but often yielding limited improvement; or making API calls in each tuning iteration to the foundation model, which entails prohibitive computational costs. Therefore, we propose a novel advanced black-box tuning method for LLMs with limited API calls. Our core strategy involves training a Gaussian Process (GP) surrogate model with "LogitMap Pairs" derived from querying the foundation model on a minimal but highly informative training subset. This surrogate can approximate the outputs of the foundation model to guide the training of the proxy model, thereby effectively reducing the need for direct queries to the foundation model. Extensive experiments verify that our approach elevates pre-trained language model accuracy from 55.92% to 86.85%, reducing the frequency of API queries to merely 1.38%. This significantly outperforms offline approaches that operate entirely without API access. Notably, our method also achieves comparable or superior accuracy to query-intensive approaches, while significantly reducing API costs. This offers a robust and high-efficiency paradigm for language model adaptation.

### Numerical optimization of aviation decarbonization scenarios: balancing traffic and emissions with maturing energy carriers and aircraft technology
**Authors**: Ian Costa-Alves, Nicolas Gourdain, François Gallard, Anne Gazaix, Yri Amandine Kambiri, Thierry Druot

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T09:42:49Z

**Summary**: Despite being considered a hard-to-abate sector, aviation's emissions will play an important role in long-term climate mitigation of transportation. The introduction of low-carbon energy carriers and the deployment of new aircraft in the current fleet are modeled as technology-centered decarbonization policies, while supply constraints in targeted market segments are modeled as demand-side policies. Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) are used to estimate trend-mitigation traffic demand and to limit the sectoral consumption of electricity and biomass. Mitigation scenarios are formulated as optimization problems, and three applications are demonstrated: no-policy baselines, single-policy optimization, and scenario-robust policies. Results show that the choice of energy carrier is highly dependent on assumptions regarding aircraft technology and the background energy system. Across all SSP-based scenarios, emissions peak by around 2040, but achieving alignment with the Paris Agreement requires either targeted demand management or additional low-carbon energy supply. The use of gradient-based optimization within a multidisciplinary framework enables the efficient resolution of these nonlinear, high-dimensional problems while reducing implementation effort.

### PentestEval: Benchmarking LLM-based Penetration Testing with Modular and Stage-Level Design
**Authors**: Ruozhao Yang, Mingfei Cheng, Gelei Deng, Tianwei Zhang, Junjie Wang, Xiaofei Xie

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T09:37:21Z

**Summary**: Penetration testing is essential for assessing and strengthening system security against real-world threats, yet traditional workflows remain highly manual, expertise-intensive, and difficult to scale. Although recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising opportunities for automation, existing applications rely on simplistic prompting without task decomposition or domain adaptation, resulting in unreliable black-box behavior and limited insight into model capabilities across penetration testing stages. To address this gap, we introduce PentestEval, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LLMs across six decomposed penetration testing stages: Information Collection, Weakness Gathering and Filtering, Attack Decision-Making, Exploit Generation and Revision. PentestEval integrates expert-annotated ground truth with a fully automated evaluation pipeline across 346 tasks covering all stages in 12 realistic vulnerable scenarios. Our stage-level evaluation of 9 widely used LLMs reveals generally weak performance and distinct limitations across the stages of penetration-testing workflow. End-to-end pipelines reach only 31% success rate, and existing LLM-powered systems such as PentestGPT, PentestAgent, and VulnBot exhibit similar limitations, with autonomous agents failing almost entirely. These findings highlight that autonomous penetration testing demands stronger structured reasoning, where modularization enhances each individual stage and improves overall performance. PentestEval provides the foundational benchmark needed for future research on fine-grained, stage-level evaluation, paving the way toward more reliable LLM-based automation.

### Georeferencing complex relative locality descriptions with large language models
**Authors**: Aneesha Fernando, Surangika Ranathunga, Kristin Stock, Raj Prasanna, Christopher B. Jones

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T09:27:02Z

**Summary**: Georeferencing text documents has typically relied on either gazetteer-based methods to assign geographic coordinates to place names, or on language modelling approaches that associate textual terms with geographic locations. However, many location descriptions specify positions relatively with spatial relationships, making geocoding based solely on place names or geo-indicative words inaccurate. This issue frequently arises in biological specimen collection records, where locations are often described through narratives rather than coordinates if they pre-date GPS. Accurate georeferencing is vital for biodiversity studies, yet the process remains labour-intensive, leading to a demand for automated georeferencing solutions. This paper explores the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to georeference complex locality descriptions automatically, focusing on the biodiversity collections domain. We first identified effective prompting patterns, then fine-tuned an LLM using Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA) on biodiversity datasets from multiple regions and languages. Our approach outperforms existing baselines with an average, across datasets, of 65% of records within a 10 km radius, for a fixed amount of training data. The best results (New York state) were 85% within 10km and 67% within 1km. The selected LLM performs well for lengthy, complex descriptions, highlighting its potential for georeferencing intricate locality descriptions.

### Pace: Physics-Aware Attentive Temporal Convolutional Network for Battery Health Estimation
**Authors**: Sara Sameer, Wei Zhang, Dhivya Dharshini Kannan, Xin Lou, Yulin Gao, Terence Goh, Qingyu Yan

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T09:17:10Z

**Summary**: Batteries are critical components in modern energy systems such as electric vehicles and power grid energy storage. Effective battery health management is essential for battery system safety, cost-efficiency, and sustainability. In this paper, we propose Pace, a physics-aware attentive temporal convolutional network for battery health estimation. Pace integrates raw sensor measurements with battery physics features derived from the equivalent circuit model. We develop three battery-specific modules, including dilated temporal blocks for efficient temporal encoding, chunked attention blocks for context modeling, and a dual-head output block for fusing short- and long-term battery degradation patterns. Together, the modules enable Pace to predict battery health accurately and efficiently in various battery usage conditions. In a large public dataset, Pace performs much better than existing models, achieving an average performance improvement of 6.5 and 2.0x compared to two best-performing baseline models. We further demonstrate its practical viability with a real-time edge deployment on a Raspberry Pi. These results establish Pace as a practical and high-performance solution for battery health analytics.

### Estimating problem difficulty without ground truth using Large Language Model comparisons
**Authors**: Marthe Ballon, Andres Algaba, Brecht Verbeken, Vincent Ginis

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T09:13:56Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in the finetuning of large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved their performance on established benchmarks, emphasizing the need for increasingly difficult, synthetic data. A key step in this data generation pipeline is a method for estimating problem difficulty. Current approaches, such as human calibration or performance-based scoring, fail to generalize to out-of-distribution problems, i.e. problems currently unsolvable by humans and LLMs, because they are not scalable, time-consuming, and ground truth dependent. Therefore, we propose a new method for estimating problem difficulty, LLM compare, that addresses these limitations. An LLM performs pairwise difficulty comparisons, and then Bradley-Terry scores are computed based on the outcomes. To validate our method, we first propose a conceptual framework that positions existing approaches on three orthogonal planes--construction, scale and dependence--identifying which quadrants a measure needs to occupy to score out-of-distribution problems. LLM compare naturally occupies all desirable quadrants as the first measure that is continuous and dynamic, model-agnostic and independent of ground truth information. As a second validation, we show that LLM compare demonstrates strong alignment with human annotations: Pearson $r \geq 0.80$ for $n=1876$. Thirdly, we show that LLM compare is robust to hallucinations, with less than $6\%$ degradation in Pearson correlation for $10\%$ noise injection. Our work represents a significant step towards replacing time-consuming human annotations and synthetic data generation, and will be an important driver for curriculum design, model evaluation, and AI-assisted research ideation.

### A LoRA-Based Approach to Fine-Tuning LLMs for Educational Guidance in Resource-Constrained Settings
**Authors**: Md Millat Hosen

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T08:49:26Z

**Summary**: The current study describes a cost-effective method for adapting large language models (LLMs) for academic advising with study-abroad contexts in mind and for application in low-resource methods for acculturation. With the Mistral-7B-Instruct model applied with a Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) method and a 4-bit quantization method, the model underwent training in two distinct stages related to this study's purpose to enhance domain specificity while maintaining computational efficiency. In Phase 1, the model was conditioned with a synthetic dataset via the Gemini Pro API, and in Phase 2, it was trained with manually curated datasets from the StudyAbroadGPT project to achieve enhanced, contextualized responses. Technical innovations entailed memory-efficient quantization, parameter-efficient adaptation, and continuous training analytics via Weights & Biases. After training, this study demonstrated a reduction in training loss by 52.7%, 92% accuracy in domain-specific recommendations, achieved 95% markdown-based formatting support, and a median run-rate of 100 samples per second on off-the-shelf GPU equipment. These findings support the effective application of instruction-tuned LLMs within educational advisers, especially in low-resource institutional scenarios. Limitations included decreased generalizability and the application of a synthetically generated dataset, but this framework is scalable for adding new multilingual-augmented and real-time academic advising processes. Future directions may include plans for the integration of retrieval-augmented generation, applying dynamic quantization routines, and connecting to real-time academic databases to increase adaptability and accuracy.

### Location-Robust Cost-Preserving Blended Pricing for Multi-Campus AI Data Centers
**Authors**: Qi He

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T08:47:00Z

**Summary**: Large-scale AI data center portfolios procure identical SKUs across geographically heterogeneous campuses, yet finance and operations require a single system-level 'world price' per SKU for budgeting and planning. A common practice is deployment-weighted blending of campus prices, which preserves total cost but can trigger Simpson-type aggregation failures: heterogeneous location mixes can reverse SKU rankings and distort decision signals.   I formalize cost-preserving blended pricing under location heterogeneity and propose two practical operators that reconcile accounting identity with ranking robustness and production implementability. A two-way fixed-effects operator separates global SKU effects from campus effects and restores exact cost preservation via scalar normalization, providing interpretable decomposition and smoothing under mild missingness. A convex common-weight operator computes a single set of campus weights under accounting constraints to enforce a location-robust benchmark and prevent dominance reversals; I also provide feasibility diagnostics and a slack-based fallback for extreme mix conditions. Simulations and an AI data center OPEX illustration show substantial reductions in ranking violations relative to naive blending while maintaining cost accuracy, with scalable distributed implementation.

### Fracture Morphology Classification: Local Multiclass Modeling for Multilabel Complexity
**Authors**: Cassandra Krause, Mattias P. Heinrich, Ron Keuth

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T08:47:00Z

**Summary**: Between $15\,\%$ and $45\,\%$ of children experience a fracture during their growth years, making accurate diagnosis essential. Fracture morphology, alongside location and fragment angle, is a key diagnostic feature. In this work, we propose a method to extract fracture morphology by assigning automatically global AO codes to corresponding fracture bounding boxes. This approach enables the use of public datasets and reformulates the global multilabel task into a local multiclass one, improving the average F1 score by $7.89\,\%$. However, performance declines when using imperfect fracture detectors, highlighting challenges for real-world deployment. Our code is available on GitHub.

### A Knowledge Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation Framework for Algorithm Selection in the Facility Layout Problem
**Authors**: Nikhil N S, Bilal Muhammed, Soban Babu Beemaraj, Amol Dilip Joshi

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T08:38:01Z

**Summary**: Selecting a solution algorithm for the Facility Layout Problem (FLP), an NP-hard optimization problem with multiobjective trade-off, is a complex task that requires deep expert knowledge. The performance of a given algorithm depends on the specific characteristics of the problem, such as the number of facilities, objectives, and constraints. This creates a need for a data-driven recommendation method to guide algorithm selection in automated design systems. This paper introduces a new recommendation method to make this expertise accessible, based on a Knowledge Graph-Based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KG-RAG) framework. In this framework, a domain-specific knowledge graph (KG) is constructed from the literature. The method then employs a multifaceted retrieval mechanism to gather relevant evidence from this KG using three distinct approaches: precise graph-based search, flexible vector-based search, and cluster-based high-level search. The retrieved evidence is utilized by a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate algorithm recommendations based on data-driven reasoning. This KG-RAG framework is tested on a use case consisting of six problems comprising of complex multi-objective and multi-constraint FLP case. The results are compared with the Gemini 1.5 Flash chatbot. The results show that KG-RAG achieves an average reasoning score of 4.7 out of 5 compared to 3.3 for the baseline chatbot.

### Efficient Reinforcement Learning with Semantic and Token Entropy for LLM Reasoning
**Authors**: Hongye Cao, Zhixin Bai, Ziyue Peng, Boyan Wang, Tianpei Yang, Jing Huo, Yuyao Zhang, Yang Gao

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T08:18:28Z

**Summary**: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has demonstrated superior performance in enhancing the reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs). However, this accuracy-oriented learning paradigm often suffers from entropy collapse, which reduces policy exploration and limits reasoning capabilities. To address this challenge, we propose an efficient reinforcement learning framework that leverages entropy signals at both the semantic and token levels to improve reasoning. From the data perspective, we introduce semantic entropy-guided curriculum learning, organizing training data from low to high semantic entropy to guide progressive optimization from easier to more challenging tasks. For the algorithmic design, we adopt non-uniform token treatment by imposing KL regularization on low-entropy tokens that critically impact policy exploration and applying stronger constraints on high-covariance portions within these tokens. By jointly optimizing data organization and algorithmic design, our method effectively mitigates entropy collapse and enhances LLM reasoning. Experimental results across 6 benchmarks with 3 different parameter-scale base models demonstrate that our method outperforms other entropy-based approaches in improving reasoning.

### A Comparative Analysis of Retrieval-Augmented Generation Techniques for Bengali Standard-to-Dialect Machine Translation Using LLMs
**Authors**: K. M. Jubair Sami, Dipto Sumit, Ariyan Hossain, Farig Sadeque

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T08:18:18Z

**Summary**: Translating from a standard language to its regional dialects is a significant NLP challenge due to scarce data and linguistic variation, a problem prominent in the Bengali language. This paper proposes and compares two novel RAG pipelines for standard-to-dialectal Bengali translation. The first, a Transcript-Based Pipeline, uses large dialect sentence contexts from audio transcripts. The second, a more effective Standardized Sentence-Pairs Pipeline, utilizes structured local\_dialect:standard\_bengali sentence pairs. We evaluated both pipelines across six Bengali dialects and multiple LLMs using BLEU, ChrF, WER, and BERTScore. Our findings show that the sentence-pair pipeline consistently outperforms the transcript-based one, reducing Word Error Rate (WER) from 76\% to 55\% for the Chittagong dialect. Critically, this RAG approach enables smaller models (e.g., Llama-3.1-8B) to outperform much larger models (e.g., GPT-OSS-120B), demonstrating that a well-designed retrieval strategy can be more crucial than model size. This work contributes an effective, fine-tuning-free solution for low-resource dialect translation, offering a practical blueprint for preserving linguistic diversity.

### Improving Semantic Uncertainty Quantification in LVLMs with Semantic Gaussian Processes
**Authors**: Joseph Hoche, Andrei Bursuc, David Brellmann, Gilles Louppe, Pavel Izmailov, Angela Yao, Gianni Franchi

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T08:15:24Z

**Summary**: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) often produce plausible but unreliable outputs, making robust uncertainty estimation essential. Recent work on semantic uncertainty estimates relies on external models to cluster multiple sampled responses and measure their semantic consistency. However, these clustering methods are often fragile, highly sensitive to minor phrasing variations, and can incorrectly group or separate semantically similar answers, leading to unreliable uncertainty estimates. We propose Semantic Gaussian Process Uncertainty (SGPU), a Bayesian framework that quantifies semantic uncertainty by analyzing the geometric structure of answer embeddings, avoiding brittle clustering. SGPU maps generated answers into a dense semantic space, computes the Gram matrix of their embeddings, and summarizes their semantic configuration via the eigenspectrum. This spectral representation is then fed into a Gaussian Process Classifier that learns to map patterns of semantic consistency to predictive uncertainty, and that can be applied in both black-box and white-box settings. Across six LLMs and LVLMs on eight datasets spanning VQA, image classification, and textual QA, SGPU consistently achieves state-of-the-art calibration (ECE) and discriminative (AUROC, AUARC) performance. We further show that SGPU transfers across models and modalities, indicating that its spectral representation captures general patterns of semantic uncertainty.

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T08:07:38Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in agentic AI have shifted the focus from standalone Large Language Models (LLMs) to integrated systems that combine LLMs with tools, memory, and other agents to perform complex tasks. These multi-agent architectures enable coordinated reasoning, planning, and execution across diverse domains, allowing agents to collaboratively automate complex workflows. Despite these advances, evaluation and assessment of LLM agents and the multi-agent systems they constitute remain a fundamental challenge. Although various approaches have been proposed in the software engineering literature for evaluating conventional software components, existing methods for AI-based systems often overlook the non-deterministic nature of models. This non-determinism introduces behavioral uncertainty during execution, yet existing evaluations rely on binary task completion metrics that fail to capture it. Evaluating agentic systems therefore requires examining additional dimensions, including the agent ability to invoke tools, ingest and retrieve memory, collaborate with other agents, and interact effectively with its environment. These challenges emerged during our ongoing industry collaboration with MontyCloud Inc., when we deployed an agentic system in production. These limitations surfaced during deployment, highlighting practical gaps in the current evaluation methods and the need for a systematic assessment of agent behavior beyond task outcomes. Informed by these observations and established definitions of agentic systems, we propose an end-to-end Agent Assessment Framework with four evaluation pillars encompassing LLMs, Memory, Tools, and Environment. We validate the framework on a representative Autonomous CloudOps use case, where experiments reveal behavioral deviations overlooked by conventional metrics, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing runtime uncertainties.

### Optimizing Highway Traffic Flow in Mixed Autonomy: A Multiagent Truncated Rollout Approach
**Authors**: Lu Liu, Chi Xie, Xi Xiong

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T08:02:22Z

**Summary**: The development of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) offers substantial opportunities to enhance traffic efficiency. However, in mixed autonomy environments where CAVs coexist with human-driven vehicles (HDVs), achieving efficient coordination among CAVs remains challenging due to heterogeneous driving behaviors. To address this, this paper proposes a multiagent truncated rollout approach that enhances CAV speed coordination to improve highway throughput while reducing computational overhead. In this approach, a traffic density evolution equation is formulated that comprehensively accounts for the presence or absence of CAVs, and a distributed coordination control framework is established accordingly. By incorporating kinematic information from neighbor agents and employing an agent-by-agent sequential solution mechanism, our method enables explicit cooperation among CAVs. Furthermore, we introduce a truncated rollout scheme that adaptively shortens the optimization horizon based on the evaluation of control sequences. This significantly reduces the time complexity, thereby improving real-time performance and scalability. Theoretical analysis provides rigorous guarantees on the stability and performance improvement of the system. Simulations conducted on real-world bottleneck scenarios demonstrate that, in large-scale mixed traffic flows, the proposed method outperforms conventional model predictive control methods by reducing both the average travel time in the bottleneck area and overall computational time, highlighting its strong potential for practical deployment.

**Authors**: Renren Jin, Tianhao Shen, Xinwei Wu, Dan Shi, Haoran Sun, Yuqi Ren, Wuwei Huang, Quandong Wang, Wei Liu, Jian Luan, Bin Wang, Deyi Xiong

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T07:56:51Z

**Summary**: Conducting supervised fine-tuning and preference fine-tuning on large language models (LLMs) requires high-quality datasets to improve their ability to follow instructions and align with human preferences and values. However, constructing such datasets is resource-intensive, and most available datasets for supervised and preference fine-tuning are in English. To address these challenges, we propose the \underline{\textbf{Ta}}xonomy-Guided \underline{\textbf{P}}reference Data Generation (TaP) framework, which facilitates automated and scalable construction of preference datasets across various languages. TaP is grounded in a structured taxonomy that allows fine-grained control over dataset composition, thereby ensuring both diversity and comprehensive coverage. We employ TaP-generated datasets to perform supervised and preference fine-tuning on various LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate that LLMs trained on TaP-generated datasets outperform those trained on existing open-source datasets. Remarkably, LLMs trained on TaP-generated datasets surpass the performance of those trained on an open-source dataset that is 180 times larger.

### IntentMiner: Intent Inversion Attack via Tool Call Analysis in the Model Context Protocol
**Authors**: Yunhao Yao, Zhiqiang Wang, Haoran Cheng, Yihang Cheng, Haohua Du, Xiang-Yang Li

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T07:52:55Z

**Summary**: The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) into autonomous agents has led to the adoption of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) as a standard for discovering and invoking external tools. While this architecture decouples the reasoning engine from tool execution to enhance scalability, it introduces a significant privacy surface: third-party MCP servers, acting as semi-honest intermediaries, can observe detailed tool interaction logs outside the user's trusted boundary. In this paper, we first identify and formalize a novel privacy threat termed Intent Inversion, where a semi-honest MCP server attempts to reconstruct the user's private underlying intent solely by analyzing legitimate tool calls. To systematically assess this vulnerability, we propose IntentMiner, a framework that leverages Hierarchical Information Isolation and Three-Dimensional Semantic Analysis, integrating tool purpose, call statements, and returned results, to accurately infer user intent at the step level. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IntentMiner achieves a high degree of semantic alignment (over 85%) with original user queries, significantly outperforming baseline approaches. These results highlight the inherent privacy risks in decoupled agent architectures, revealing that seemingly benign tool execution logs can serve as a potent vector for exposing user secrets.

### Robust Beamforming for Multiuser MIMO Systems with Unknown Channel Statistics: A Hybrid Offline-Online Framework
**Authors**: Wenzhuo Zou, Ming-Min Zhao, An Liu, Min-Jian Zhao

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T07:50:11Z

**Summary**: Robust beamforming design under imperfect channel state information (CSI) is a fundamental challenge in multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems, particularly when the channel estimation error statistics are unknown. Conventional model-driven methods usually rely on prior knowledge of the error covariance matrix and data-driven deep learning approaches suffer from poor generalization capability to unseen channel conditions. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a hybrid offline-online framework that achieves effective offline learning and rapid online adaptation. In the offline phase, we propose a shared (among users) deep neural network (DNN) that is able to learn the channel estimation error covariance from observed samples, thus enabling robust beamforming without statistical priors. Meanwhile, to facilitate real-time deployment, we propose a sparse augmented low-rank (SALR) method to reduce complexity while maintaining comparable performance. In the online phase, we show that the proposed network can be rapidly fine-tuned with minimal gradient steps. Furthermore, a multiple basis model-agnostic meta-learning (MB-MAML) strategy is further proposed to maintain multiple meta-initializations and by dynamically selecting the best one online, we can improve the adaptation and generalization capability of the proposed framework under unseen or non-stationary channels. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed offline-online framework exhibits strong robustness across diverse channel conditions and it is able to significantly outperform state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines.

### Enhancing Geo-localization for Crowdsourced Flood Imagery via LLM-Guided Attention
**Authors**: Fengyi Xu, Jun Ma, Waishan Qiu, Cui Guo, Jack C. P. Cheng

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T07:39:03Z

**Summary**: Crowdsourced street-view imagery from social media provides real-time visual evidence of urban flooding and other crisis events, yet it often lacks reliable geographic metadata for emergency response. Existing image geo-localization approaches, also known as Visual Place Recognition (VPR) models, exhibit substantial performance degradation when applied to such imagery due to visual distortions and domain shifts in cross-source scenarios. This paper presents VPR-AttLLM, a model-agnostic framework that integrates the semantic reasoning and geo-knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs) into established VPR pipelines through attention-guided descriptor enhancement. By leveraging LLMs to identify location-informative regions within the city context and suppress visual noise, VPR-AttLLM improves retrieval performance without requiring model retraining or additional data. Comprehensive evaluations are conducted on extended benchmarks including SF-XL enriched with real social-media flood images, synthetic flooding scenarios over established query sets and Mapillary photos, and a new HK-URBAN dataset capturing morphologically distinct cityscapes. Integrating VPR-AttLLM with three state-of-the-art VPR models-CosPlace, EigenPlaces, and SALAD-consistently improves recall performance, yielding relative gains typically between 1-3% and reaching up to 8% on the most challenging real flood imagery. Beyond measurable gains in retrieval accuracy, this study establishes a generalizable paradigm for LLM-guided multimodal fusion in visual retrieval systems. By embedding principles from urban perception theory into attention mechanisms, VPR-AttLLM bridges human-like spatial reasoning with modern VPR architectures. Its plug-and-play design, strong cross-source robustness, and interpretability highlight its potential for scalable urban monitoring and rapid geo-localization of crowdsourced crisis imagery.

### Translating Electrocardiograms to Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging Useful for Cardiac Assessment and Disease Screening: A Multi-Center Study
**Authors**: Zhengyao Ding, Ziyu Li, Yujian Hu, Youyao Xu, Chengchen Zhao, Yiheng Mao, Haitao Li, Zhikang Li, Qian Li, Jing Wang, Yue Chen, Mengjia Chen, Longbo Wang, Xuesen Chu, Weichao Pan, Ziyi Liu, Fei Wu, Hongkun Zhang, Ting Chen, Zhengxing Huang

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T07:36:18Z

**Summary**: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of global mortality, necessitating accessible and accurate diagnostic tools. While cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) provides gold-standard insights into cardiac structure and function, its clinical utility is limited by high cost and complexity. In contrast, electrocardiography (ECG) is inexpensive and widely available but lacks the granularity of CMR. We propose CardioNets, a deep learning framework that translates 12-lead ECG signals into CMR-level functional parameters and synthetic images, enabling scalable cardiac assessment. CardioNets integrates cross-modal contrastive learning and generative pretraining, aligning ECG with CMR-derived cardiac phenotypes and synthesizing high-resolution CMR images via a masked autoregressive model. Trained on 159,819 samples from five cohorts, including the UK Biobank (n=42,483) and MIMIC-IV-ECG (n=164,550), and externally validated on independent clinical datasets (n=3,767), CardioNets achieved strong performance across disease screening and phenotype estimation tasks. In the UK Biobank, it improved cardiac phenotype regression R2 by 24.8% and cardiomyopathy AUC by up to 39.3% over baseline models. In MIMIC, it increased AUC for pulmonary hypertension detection by 5.6%. Generated CMR images showed 36.6% higher SSIM and 8.7% higher PSNR than prior approaches. In a reader study, ECG-only CardioNets achieved 13.9% higher accuracy than human physicians using both ECG and real CMR. These results suggest that CardioNets offers a promising, low-cost alternative to CMR for large-scale CVD screening, particularly in resource-limited settings. Future efforts will focus on clinical deployment and regulatory validation of ECG-based synthetic imaging.

### Adaptive Cache Pollution Control for Large Language Model Inference Workloads Using Temporal CNN-Based Prediction and Priority-Aware Replacement
**Authors**: Songze Liu, Hongkun Du, Shaowen Wang

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T07:16:10Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT and LLaMA, introduce unique memory access characteristics during inference due to frequent token sequence lookups and embedding vector retrievals. These workloads generate highly irregular and bursty access patterns, causing traditional prefetching and replacement policies to mispredict and trigger severe cache pollution, thereby degrading system performance. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an Adaptive Cache Pollution Control (ACPC) mechanism tailored for LLM inference workloads, integrating Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN)-based access prediction with a priority-aware replacement strategy. The TCN module learns temporal dependencies in token access sequences to identify potential high-reuse cache lines, while the replacement policy dynamically adjusts eviction priorities based on predicted reuse likelihood and cache occupancy. The proposed framework is implemented and evaluated on representative transformer-based inference traces, including GPT-style autoregressive decoding and embedding retrieval workloads. Experimental results demonstrate that ACPC reduces cache pollution by 41.7 percent, improves cache hit rate by 8.9 percent, and achieves a 60.0 percent reduction in L2 miss penalty, compared with state-of-the-art machine-learning-based replacement baselines. Additionally, the proposed Temporal CNN-based ACPC framework increases token generation throughput by 15.9 percent and achieves the lowest final loss of 0.21, confirming its superior efficiency and stability under complex LLM inference workloads. These results highlight ACPC's effectiveness in recognizing useful cache lines and mitigating redundant prefetches under dynamic LLM access behaviors. The proposed approach provides a scalable, learning-driven solution for optimizing memory efficiency and latency in large-scale LLM serving and inference systems.

### DIWALI: Diversity and Inclusivity aWare cuLture specific Items for India: Dataset and Assessment of LLMs for Cultural Text Adaptation in Indian Context
**Authors**: Pramit Sahoo, Maharaj Brahma, Maunendra Sankar Desarkar

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T07:09:46Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are widely used in various tasks and applications. However, despite their wide capabilities, they are shown to lack cultural alignment \citep{ryan-etal-2024-unintended, alkhamissi-etal-2024-investigating} and produce biased generations \cite{naous-etal-2024-beer} due to a lack of cultural knowledge and competence. Evaluation of LLMs for cultural awareness and alignment is particularly challenging due to the lack of proper evaluation metrics and unavailability of culturally grounded datasets representing the vast complexity of cultures at the regional and sub-regional levels. Existing datasets for culture specific items (CSIs) focus primarily on concepts at the regional level and may contain false positives. To address this issue, we introduce a novel CSI dataset for Indian culture, belonging to 17 cultural facets. The dataset comprises ~8k cultural concepts from 36 sub-regions. To measure the cultural competence of LLMs on a cultural text adaptation task, we evaluate the adaptations using the CSIs created, LLM as Judge, and human evaluations from diverse socio-demographic region. Furthermore, we perform quantitative analysis demonstrating selective sub-regional coverage and surface-level adaptations across all considered LLMs. Our dataset is available here: https://huggingface.co/datasets/nlip/DIWALI, project webpage https://nlip-lab.github.io/nlip/publications/diwali/, and our codebase with model outputs can be found here: https://github.com/pramitsahoo/culture-evaluation

### Astraea: A State-Aware Scheduling Engine for LLM-Powered Agents
**Authors**: Hongqiu Ni, Jiabao Zhang, Guopeng Li, Zilong Wang, Ruiqi Wu, Chi Zhang, Haisheng Tan

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T06:55:10Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed as intelligent agents. Their multi-stage workflows, which alternate between local computation and calls to external network services like Web APIs, introduce a mismatch in their execution pattern and the scheduling granularity of existing inference systems such as vLLM. Existing systems typically focus on per-segment optimization which prevents them from minimizing the end-to-end latency of the complete agentic workflow, i.e., the global Job Completion Time (JCT) over the entire request lifecycle. To address this limitation, we propose Astraea, a service engine designed to shift the optimization from local segments to the global request lifecycle. Astraea employs a state-aware, hierarchical scheduling algorithm that integrates a request's historical state with future predictions. It dynamically classifies requests by their I/O and compute intensive nature and uses an enhanced HRRN policy to balance efficiency and fairness. Astraea also implements an adaptive KV cache manager that intelligently handles the agent state during I/O waits based on the system memory pressure. Extensive experiments show that Astraea reduces average JCT by up to 25.5\% compared to baseline methods. Moreover, our approach demonstrates strong robustness and stability under high load across various model scales.

### TorchTraceAP: A New Benchmark Dataset for Detecting Performance Anti-Patterns in Computer Vision Models
**Authors**: Hanning Chen, Keyu Man, Kevin Zhu, Chenguang Zhu, Haonan Li, Tongbo Luo, Xizhou Feng, Wei Sun, Sreen Tallam, Mohsen Imani, Partha Kanuparthy

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T06:54:20Z

**Summary**: Identifying and addressing performance anti-patterns in machine learning (ML) models is critical for efficient training and inference, but it typically demands deep expertise spanning system infrastructure, ML models and kernel development. While large tech companies rely on dedicated ML infrastructure engineers to analyze torch traces and benchmarks, such resource-intensive workflows are largely inaccessible to computer vision researchers in general. Among the challenges, pinpointing problematic trace segments within lengthy execution traces remains the most time-consuming task, and is difficult to automate with current ML models, including LLMs. In this work, we present the first benchmark dataset specifically designed to evaluate and improve ML models' ability to detect anti patterns in traces. Our dataset contains over 600 PyTorch traces from diverse computer vision models classification, detection, segmentation, and generation collected across multiple hardware platforms. We also propose a novel iterative approach: a lightweight ML model first detects trace segments with anti patterns, followed by a large language model (LLM) for fine grained classification and targeted feedback. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms unsupervised clustering and rule based statistical techniques for detecting anti pattern regions. Our method also effectively compensates LLM's limited context length and reasoning inefficiencies.

### GALAX: Graph-Augmented Language Model for Explainable Reinforcement-Guided Subgraph Reasoning in Precision Medicine
**Authors**: Heming Zhang, Di Huang, Wenyu Li, Michael Province, Yixin Chen, Philip Payne, Fuhai Li

**Updated**: 2025-12-16T06:45:08Z

**Summary**: In precision medicine, quantitative multi-omic features, topological context, and textual biological knowledge play vital roles in identifying disease-critical signaling pathways and targets. Existing pipelines capture only part of these-numerical omics ignore topological context, text-centric LLMs lack quantitative grounded reasoning, and graph-only models underuse node semantics and the generalization of LLMs-limiting mechanistic interpretability. Although Process Reward Models (PRMs) aim to guide reasoning in LLMs, they remain limited by unreliable intermediate evaluation, and vulnerability to reward hacking with computational cost. These gaps motivate integrating quantitative multi-omic signals, topological structure with node annotations, and literature-scale text via LLMs, using subgraph reasoning as the principle bridge linking numeric evidence, topological knowledge and language context. Therefore, we propose GALAX (Graph Augmented LAnguage model with eXplainability), an innovative framework that integrates pretrained Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) into Large Language Models (LLMs) via reinforcement learning guided by a Graph Process Reward Model (GPRM), which generates disease-relevant subgraphs in a step-wise manner initiated by an LLM and iteratively evaluated by a pretrained GNN and schema-based rule check, enabling process-level supervision without explicit labels. As an application, we also introduced Target-QA, a benchmark combining CRISPR-identified targets, multi-omic profiles, and biomedical graph knowledge across diverse cancer cell lines, which enables GNN pretraining for supervising step-wise graph construction and supports long-context reasoning over text-numeric graphs (TNGs), providing a scalable and biologically grounded framework for explainable, reinforcement-guided subgraph reasoning toward reliable and interpretable target discovery in precision medicine.
