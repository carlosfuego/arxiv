**Summary**: A truly interactive world model requires three key ingredients: real-time long-horizon streaming, consistent spatial memory, and precise user control. However, most existing approaches address only one of these aspects in isolation, as achieving all three simultaneously is highly challenging-for example, long-term memory mechanisms often degrade real-time performance. In this work, we present RELIC, a unified framework that tackles these three challenges altogether. Given a single image and a text description, RELIC enables memory-aware, long-duration exploration of arbitrary scenes in real time. Built upon recent autoregressive video-diffusion distillation techniques, our model represents long-horizon memory using highly compressed historical latent tokens encoded with both relative actions and absolute camera poses within the KV cache. This compact, camera-aware memory structure supports implicit 3D-consistent content retrieval and enforces long-term coherence with minimal computational overhead. In parallel, we fine-tune a bidirectional teacher video model to generate sequences beyond its original 5-second training horizon, and transform it into a causal student generator using a new memory-efficient self-forcing paradigm that enables full-context distillation over long-duration teacher as well as long student self-rollouts. Implemented as a 14B-parameter model and trained on a curated Unreal Engine-rendered dataset, RELIC achieves real-time generation at 16 FPS while demonstrating more accurate action following, more stable long-horizon streaming, and more robust spatial-memory retrieval compared with prior work. These capabilities establish RELIC as a strong foundation for the next generation of interactive world modeling.

**Authors**: Advait Gilankar, Julian Gervassi-Saga, Martha R. McCartney, Nabasindhu Das, David Malcolm McComas, David J. Smith, Nidhin Kurian Kalarickal

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T18:17:12Z

**Summary**: In this work, we report on the design and fabrication of p-NiO/Ga2O3 trench junction barrier schottky diodes (JBSD) integrated with space-modulated junction termination extension (SM-JTE) and compare the performance with planar Ni/Ga2O3 schottky diodes (SBDs) and p-NiO/Ga2O3 heterojunction diodes (HJDs). The JBSDs achieved breakdown voltages exceeding 1.8 kV along with low leakage currents (<10-2 A/cm2), while displaying low turn on voltage (VON) of ~1V, which is similar to that of planar Ni/Ga2O3 SBDs. The fabricated devices showed excellent forward characteristics with low differential on-resistance (Ron,sp) ranging from 4-10.5 mΩ-cm2, for fin width between 0.6- 1.25 microns. Best performing device with fin width of 0.85μm showed a unipolar figure of merit (FOM) of ~0.7GW/cm2. This work showcases the benefits of trench JBS design along with SM-JTE edge-termination for efficient high-performance kilovolt-class \b{eta}- Ga2O3 diodes.

### PSA: Pyramid Sparse Attention for Efficient Video Understanding and Generation
**Authors**: Xiaolong Li, Youping Gu, Xi Lin, Weijie Wang, Bohan Zhuang

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T18:02:11Z

**Summary**: Attention mechanisms are the core of foundation models, but their quadratic complexity remains a critical bottleneck for scaling. This challenge has driven the development of efficient attention mechanisms, with sparsity emerging as the dominant paradigm. Current methods typically retain or discard entire key-value blocks with binary masks, resulting in substantial information loss under high sparsity. To mitigate this gap, we present Pyramid Sparse Attention (PSA), a versatile module applicable to both video understanding and generation tasks. Instead of binary masking, PSA introduces multi-level pooled KV representations, enabling finer mask granularity. Specifically, each query block dynamically allocates lower pooling levels to critical KV blocks and higher levels to less important ones, creating an informative interpolation between full retention and complete pruning. This design, analogous to fixed-point quantization and classical feature pyramid networks in computer vision, effectively mitigates information loss while preserving computational efficiency under a low compute budget. It works with a native, hardware-friendly kernel that leverages decoupled block-tile design to ensure efficient execution. Across video understanding and generation benchmarks, PSA preserves contextual information and visual fidelity, consistently outperforming or achieving comparable performance over existing sparse attention baselines with superior efficiency-quality trade-offs. Our code and model weights are publicly available at: http://ziplab.co/PSA

### OOPredictor: Predicting Object-Oriented Accesses using Static Analysis
**Authors**: Hassan Arafat, David Bremner, Kenneth B. Kent, Julian Wang

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T17:05:58Z

**Summary**: Object-oriented Programming has become one of the most dominant design paradigms as the separation of concerns and adaptability of design reduce development and maintenance costs. However, the convenience is not without cost. The added indirection inherent in such designs causes excessive pointer chasing, negatively affecting locality, which in turn degrades the performance of cache structures. Furthermore, modern hardware prefetchers are mostly stride prefetchers that are ill-equipped to handle the unpredictability of access patterns generated by pointer chasing. Most software approaches that seek to address this problem resort to profiling the program as it runs, which comes with a significant run-time overhead or requires data from previous runs. In this paper, we propose the use of compile-time static analysis to predict the most common access patterns displayed by a program during run time. Since Java is one of the most popular object-oriented languages, we implement our prototype within the OpenJ9 JVM, inside the OMR optimizer infrastructure. The outputs of our proposed predictor are Markov chains that model the expected behavior of the program. The effectiveness of the proposed predictor is evaluated by comparing the model with the actual run-time behavior of the program measured using an instrumented interpreter. Our experiments show that the proposed predictor exhibits good accuracy and can be used to inform minimally intrusive load stall mitigation strategies, e.g. informing copying GCs on more locality-friendly copying orders

### OD-MoE: On-Demand Expert Loading for Cacheless Edge-Distributed MoE Inference
**Authors**: Liujianfu Wang, Yuyang Du, Yuchen Pan, Soung Chang Liew, Jiacheng Liu, Kexin Chen

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T16:27:16Z

**Summary**: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), while offering significant advantages as a Large Language Model (LLM) architecture, faces substantial challenges when deployed on low-cost edge devices with tight memory constraints. Expert offloading mitigates this issue by storing expert parameters in CPU memory and caching a subset of popular experts in GPU memory. Although this approach improves GPU memory utilization by caching only the likely-used experts, the GPU memory reserved for expert caching is underutilized compared with dense LLMs. This paper presents OD-MoE, a distributed MoE inference framework that obviates the need for expert caches via fully on-demand expert loading. OD-MoE is built upon two key mechanisms: 1) parallelizing expert loading and expert computation across distributed edge nodes, and 2) an ultra-accurate emulative predictor that forecasts expert activations multiple layers ahead while expert computation is ongoing. With these innovations, OD-MoE dynamically loads each target expert to one of the distributed nodes just-in-time before its activation and promptly evicts it afterward, freeing GPU memory for subsequent experts. We comprehensively benchmark OD-MoE against state-of-the-art MoE offloading systems on a ten-node testbed. Experimental results show that: 1) OD-MoE achieves 99.94% expert activation prediction accuracy, substantially surpassing all existing methods; and 2) OD-MoE delivers approximately 75% of the decoding speed of a fully GPU-cached MoE deployment while using only 1/3 of the GPU memory. More importantly, by eliminating the need for expert caches, OD-MoE enables MoE inference on edge nodes with less-than-1GB GPU memory, paving the way for practical MoE deployment of low-cost IoT devices at the edge in the LLM era.

**Authors**: Andreas Kosmas Kakolyris, Dimosthenis Masouros, Petros Vavaroutsos, Sotirios Xydis, Dimitrios Soudris

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T16:21:24Z

**Summary**: As Large Language Models (LLMs) gain traction, their reliance on power-hungry GPUs places ever-increasing energy demands, raising environmental and monetary concerns. Inference dominates LLM workloads, presenting a critical challenge for providers: minimizing energy costs under Service-Level Objectives (SLOs) that ensure optimal user experience. In this paper, we present \textit{throttLL'eM}, a framework that reduces energy consumption while meeting SLOs through the use of instance and GPU frequency scaling. \textit{throttLL'eM} features mechanisms that project future KV cache usage and batch size. Leveraging a Machine-Learning (ML) model that receives these projections as inputs, \textit{throttLL'eM} manages performance at the iteration level to satisfy SLOs with reduced frequencies and instance sizes. We show that the proposed ML model achieves $R^2$ scores greater than 0.97 and miss-predicts performance by less than 1 iteration per second on average. Experimental results on LLM inference traces show that \textit{throttLL'eM} achieves up to 43.8\% lower energy consumption and an energy efficiency improvement of at least $1.71\times$ under SLOs, when compared to NVIDIA's Triton server.

### Reconstructing KV Caches with Cross-layer Fusion For Enhanced Transformers
**Authors**: Hongzhan Lin, Zhiqi Bai, Xinmiao Zhang, Sen Yang, Xiang Li, Siran Yang, Yunlong Xu, Jiaheng Liu, Yongchi Zhao, Jiamang Wang, Yuchi Xu, Wenbo Su, Bo Zheng

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T15:22:00Z

**Summary**: Transformer decoders have achieved strong results across tasks, but the memory required for the KV cache becomes prohibitive at long sequence lengths. Although Cross-layer KV Cache sharing (e.g., YOCO, CLA) offers a path to mitigate KV Cache bottleneck, it typically underperforms within-layer methods like GQA. To understand the root cause, we investigate the information flow of keys and values of the top-layers. Our preliminary reveals a clear distribution: values are predominantly derived from the bottom layer, while keys draw more information from both bottom and middle layers. Building upon this, we propose FusedKV, whose top-layer KV caches are a learnable fusion of the most informative ones from the bottom and middle layers. This fusion operates directly on post-RoPE keys, preserving relative positional information without the computational cost of re-applying rotary embeddings. To further improve efficiency, we propose FusedKV-Lite, an cross-layer sharing approach, where top-layer KV caches are directly derived from the bottom-layer values and the middle-layer keys. Compared to FusedKV, FusedKV-Lite reduces I/O overhead at the cost of a slight increase in perplexity. In experiments on LLMs ranging from 332M to 4B parameters, our proposed method reduce 50\% cache memory while achieving lower validation perplexity than the standard Transformer decoder, establishing it as a memory-efficient, high-performance architectural alternative.

### KVNAND: Efficient On-Device Large Language Model Inference Using DRAM-Free In-Flash Computing
**Authors**: Lishuo Deng, Shaojie Xu, Jinwu Chen, Changwei Yan, Jiajie Wang, Zhe Jiang, Weiwei Shan

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T09:41:03Z

**Summary**: Deploying large language models (LLMs) on edge devices enables personalized agents with strong privacy and low cost. However, with tens to hundreds of billions of parameters, single-batch autoregressive inference suffers from extremely low arithmetic intensity, creating severe weight-loading and bandwidth pressures on resource-constrained platforms. Recent in-flash computing (IFC) solutions alleviate this bottleneck by co-locating weight-related linear computations in the decode phase with flash, yet still rely on DRAM for the key-value (KV) cache. As context length grows, the KV cache can exceed model weights in size, imposing prohibitive DRAM cost and capacity requirements. Attempts to offload KV cache to flash suffer from severe performance penalties.   We propose KVNAND, the first DRAM-free, IFC-based architecture that stores both model weights and KV cache entirely in compute-enabled 3D NAND flash. KVNAND addresses the fundamental performance challenges of flash under intensive KV cache access by leveraging IFC for all memory-bound operations to reduce data transfer overhead, introducing head-group parallelism to boost throughput, and employing page-level KV cache mapping to align token access patterns with flash organization. In addition, we propose a design space exploration framework that evaluates discrete and compact KVNAND variants to balance weight and KV placement, automatically identifying the optimal design trade-off. These techniques mitigate latency, energy, and reliability concerns, turning flash into a practical medium for long-context KV storage. Evaluations on MHA 7B and GQA 70B LLMs show that KVNAND achieves 1.98\(\times\)/1.94\(\times\)/2.05\(\times\) geomean speedup at 128/1K/10K-token contexts compared to DRAM-equipped IFC designs and addresses out-of-memory failures at 100K context length.

### Fletch: File-System Metadata Caching in Programmable Switches
**Authors**: Qingxiu Liu, Jiazhen Cai, Siyuan Sheng, Yuhui Chen, Lu Tang, Zhirong Shen, Patrick P. C. Lee

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T09:23:58Z

**Summary**: Fast and scalable metadata management across multiple metadata servers is crucial for distributed file systems to handle numerous files and directories. Client-side caching of frequently accessed metadata can mitigate server loads, but incurs significant overhead and complexity in maintaining cache consistency when the number of clients increases. We explore caching in programmable switches by serving file-system metadata requests from multiple clients on the switch data plane. Despite prior efforts on in-switch key-value caching, they fail to address the path dependencies specific to file-system semantics. We propose Fletch, an in-switch file-system metadata caching framework that leverages programmable switches to serve file-system metadata requests from multiple clients directly in the switch data plane. Unlike prior in-switch key-value caching approaches, Fletch addresses file-system-specific path dependencies under stringent switch resource constraints. We implement Fletch atop Hadoop HDFS and evaluate it on a Tofino-switch testbed using real-world file-system metadata workloads. Fletch achieves up to 181.6% higher throughput than vanilla HDFS and complements client-side caching with additional throughput gains of up to 139.6%. It also incurs low latencies and limited switch resource usage.

### Decentralized Fairness Aware Multi Task Federated Learning for VR Network
**Authors**: Krishnendu S. Tharakan, Carlo Fischione

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T08:13:00Z

**Summary**: Wireless connectivity promises to unshackle virtual reality (VR) experiences, allowing users to engage from anywhere, anytime. However, delivering seamless, high-quality, real-time VR video wirelessly is challenging due to the stringent quality of experience requirements, low latency constraints, and limited VR device capabilities. This paper addresses these challenges by introducing a novel decentralized multi task fair federated learning (DMTFL) based caching that caches and prefetches each VR user's field of view (FOV) at base stations (BSs) based on the caching strategies tailored to each BS. In federated learning (FL) in its naive form, often biases toward certain users, and a single global model fails to capture the statistical heterogeneity across users and BSs. In contrast, the proposed DMTFL algorithm personalizes content delivery by learning individual caching models at each BS. These models are further optimized to perform well under any target distribution, while providing theoretical guarantees via Rademacher complexity and a probably approximately correct (PAC) bound on the loss. Using a realistic VR head-tracking dataset, our simulations demonstrate the superiority of our proposed DMTFL algorithm compared to baseline algorithms.

### Shadow in the Cache: Unveiling and Mitigating Privacy Risks of KV-cache in LLM Inference
**Authors**: Zhifan Luo, Shuo Shao, Su Zhang, Lijing Zhou, Yuke Hu, Chenxu Zhao, Zhihao Liu, Zhan Qin

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T03:07:34Z

**Summary**: The Key-Value (KV) cache, which stores intermediate attention computations (Key and Value pairs) to avoid redundant calculations, is a fundamental mechanism for accelerating Large Language Model (LLM) inference. However, this efficiency optimization introduces significant yet underexplored privacy risks. This paper provides the first comprehensive analysis of these vulnerabilities, demonstrating that an attacker can reconstruct sensitive user inputs directly from the KV-cache. We design and implement three distinct attack vectors: a direct Inversion Attack, a more broadly applicable and potent Collision Attack, and a semantic-based Injection Attack. These methods demonstrate the practicality and severity of KV-cache privacy leakage issues. To mitigate this, we propose KV-Cloak, a novel, lightweight, and efficient defense mechanism. KV-Cloak uses a reversible matrix-based obfuscation scheme, combined with operator fusion, to secure the KV-cache. Our extensive experiments show that KV-Cloak effectively thwarts all proposed attacks, reducing reconstruction quality to random noise. Crucially, it achieves this robust security with virtually no degradation in model accuracy and minimal performance overhead, offering a practical solution for trustworthy LLM deployment.

### Surfel-LIO: Fast LiDAR-Inertial Odometry with Pre-computed Surfels and Hierarchical Z-order Voxel Hashing
**Authors**: Seungwon Choi, Dong-Gyu Park, Seo-Yeon Hwang, Tae-Wan Kim

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T03:07:08Z

**Summary**: LiDAR-inertial odometry (LIO) is an active research area, as it enables accurate real-time state estimation in GPS-denied environments. Recent advances in map data structures and spatial indexing have significantly improved the efficiency of LIO systems. Nevertheless, we observe that two aspects may still leave room for improvement: (1) nearest neighbor search often requires examining multiple spatial units to gather sufficient points for plane fitting, and (2) plane parameters are typically recomputed at every iteration despite unchanged map geometry. Motivated by these observations, we propose Surfel-LIO, which employs a hierarchical voxel structure (hVox) with pre-computed surfel representation. This design enables O(1) correspondence retrieval without runtime neighbor enumeration or plane fitting, combined with Z-order curve encoding for cache-friendly spatial indexing. Experimental results on the M3DGR dataset demonstrate that our method achieves significantly faster processing speed compared to recent state-of-the-art methods while maintaining comparable state estimation accuracy. Our implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/93won/lidar_inertial_odometry.

### Cache What Lasts: Token Retention for Memory-Bounded KV Cache in LLMs
**Authors**: Ngoc Bui, Shubham Sharma, Simran Lamba, Saumitra Mishra, Rex Ying

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T00:20:35Z

**Summary**: Memory and computation remain core bottlenecks in long-horizon LLM inference due to the quadratic cost of self-attention and the ever-growing key-value (KV) cache. Existing strategies for memory-bounded inference, such as quantization, offloading, or heuristic KV eviction, either incur high orchestration costs or rely on unreliable attention-based proxies of importance. We propose TRIM-KV, a novel approach that learns each token's intrinsic importance at creation time via a lightweight retention gate. Each gate predicts a scalar retention score that decays over time, reflecting the long-term utility of the token for a specific layer and head. Tokens with low scores are evicted when the memory budget is exceeded, ensuring that the cache always contains the most critical tokens. TRIM-KV is trained efficiently through distillation from a frozen LLM combined with a capacity loss, requiring only gate fine-tuning and adding negligible inference overhead. Across mathematical reasoning (GSM8K, MATH-500, AIME24), procedural generation (LongProc), conversational long-memory benchmarks (LongMemEval), and long-context understanding (LongBench and SCBench), TRIM-KV consistently outperforms strong eviction and learnable retrieval baselines, especially in low-memory regimes. Remarkably, it even surpasses full-cache models in some settings, showing that selective retention can serve as a form of regularization, suppressing noise from uninformative tokens. Qualitative analyses further reveal that learned retention scores align with human intuition, naturally recovering heuristics such as sink tokens, sliding windows, and gist compression without explicit design. Beyond efficiency, retention scores provide insights into layer- and head-specific roles, suggesting a new path toward LLM interpretability.

### Morphling: Fast, Fused, and Flexible GNN Training at Scale
**Authors**: Anubhab, Rupesh Nasre

**Updated**: 2025-12-02T18:50:09Z

**Summary**: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) present a fundamental hardware challenge by fusing irregular, memory-bound graph traversals with regular, compute-intensive dense matrix operations. While frameworks such as PyTorch Geometric (PyG) and Deep Graph Library (DGL) prioritize high-level usability, they fail to address these divergent execution characteristics. As a result, they rely on generic kernels that suffer from poor cache locality, excessive memory movement, and substantial intermediate allocations. To address these limitations, we present Morphling, a domain-specific code synthesizer designed to bridge this gap. Morphling compiles high-level GNN specifications into portable, backend-specialized implementations targeting OpenMP, CUDA, and MPI. It achieves this by instantiating a library of optimized, architecture-aware primitives tailored to each execution environment. Morphling also incorporates a runtime sparsity-aware execution engine that dynamically selects dense or sparse execution paths using input feature statistics, reducing unnecessary computation on zero-valued entries. We evaluate Morphling on eleven real-world datasets spanning diverse graph structures, feature dimensionalities, and sparsity regimes. The results show that Morphling improves per-epoch training throughput by an average of 20X on CPUs and 19X on GPUs over PyG and DGL, with peak speedups reaching 66X. Morphling's memory-efficient layouts further reduce peak memory consumption by up to 15X, enabling large-scale GNN training on commodity hardware. These findings demonstrate that specialized, architecture-aware code synthesis provides an effective and scalable path toward high-performance GNN execution across diverse parallel and distributed platforms.

### Generation of strong ultralow-phase-noise microwave fields with tunable ellipticity for ultracold polar molecules
**Authors**: Shrestha Biswas, Sebastian Eppelt, Christian Buchberger, Xing-Yan Chen, Andreas Schindewolf, Michael Hani, Erwin Biebl, Immanuel Bloch, Xin-Yu Luo

**Updated**: 2025-12-02T18:32:11Z

**Summary**: Microwave(MW) fields with strong field strength, ultralow phase-noise and tunable polarization are crucial for stabilizing and manipulating ultracold polar molecules, which have emerged as a promising platform for quantum sciences. In this letter, we present the design, characterization, and performance of a robust MW setup tailored for precise control of molecular states. This setup achieves a high electric field intensity of 6.9 kV/m in the near-field from a dual-feed waveguide antenna, enabling a Rabi frequency as high as 71 MHz for the rotational transition of sodium-potassium molecules. In addition, the low noise signal source and controlled electronics provide ultralow phase-noise and dynamically tunable polarization. Narrow-band filters within the MW circuitry further reduce phase-noise by more than 20 dB at 20 MHz offset frequency, ensuring prolonged one-body molecular lifetimes up to 10 seconds. We also show practical methods to measure the MW field strength and polarization using a simple homemade dipole probe, and to characterize phase-noise down to -170 dBc/Hz with a commercial spectrum analyser and a notch filter. Those capabilities allowed us to evaporatively cool our molecular sample to deep quantum degeneracy. Furthermore, the polarization tunability enabled the observation of field-linked resonances and facilitated the creation of field-linked tetramers.These techniques advance the study of ultracold polar molecules and broaden the potential applications of MW tools in other platforms of quantum sciences.

### AutoNeural: Co-Designing Vision-Language Models for NPU Inference
**Authors**: Wei Chen, Liangmin Wu, Yunhai Hu, Zhiyuan Li, Zhiyuan Cheng, Yicheng Qian, Lingyue Zhu, Zhipeng Hu, Luoyi Liang, Qiang Tang, Zhen Liu, Han Yang

**Updated**: 2025-12-02T16:45:25Z

**Summary**: While Neural Processing Units (NPUs) offer high theoretical efficiency for edge AI, state-of-the-art Vision--Language Models (VLMs) tailored for GPUs often falter on these substrates. We attribute this hardware-model mismatch to two primary factors: the quantization brittleness of Vision Transformers (ViTs) and the I/O-bound nature of autoregressive attention mechanisms, which fail to utilize the high arithmetic throughput of NPUs. To bridge this gap, we propose AutoNeural, an NPU-native VLM architecture co-designed for integer-only inference. We replace the standard ViT encoder with a MobileNetV5-style backbone utilizing depthwise separable convolutions, which ensures bounded activation distributions for stable INT4/8/16 quantization. Complementing this, our language backbone integrates State-Space Model (SSM) principles with Transformer layers, employing efficient gated convolutions to achieve linear-time complexity. This hybrid design eliminates the heavy memory I/O overhead of Key-Value caching during generation. Our approach delivers substantial efficiency gains, reducing quantization error of vision encoder by up to 7x and end-to-end latency by 14x compared to conventional baselines. The AutoNeural also delivers 3x decoding speed and 4x longer context window than the baseline. We validate these improvements via a real-world automotive case study on the Qualcomm SA8295P SoC, demonstrating real-time performance for cockpit applications. Our results highlight that rethinking model topology specifically for NPU constraints is a prerequisite for robust multi-modal edge intelligence.

### Computational Model for Photoionization in Pure SF6 Streamer at 1-15 atm
**Authors**: Zihao Feng, Liyang Zhang, Xiaobing Zou, Haiyun Luo

**Updated**: 2025-12-02T07:05:10Z

**Summary**: Photoionization plays a crucial role in achieving accurate quantitative predictions in SF6 streamer simulations, but accurate models for SF6 photoionization remains limited, motivating this paper. First, we develop a computational model for SF6 photoionization and provide the detailed theoretical modeling process, as well as comparison between experiment and simulation. A concise summary of model parameters within the comprehensive pressure range of 1 - 15 atm is provided for direct reference. Then, we perform comparative studies against simplified approaches. The results demonstrate that the proposed model effectively captures the non-local effects of SF6 photoionization, enhancing both the spatial numerical convergence and the accuracy of the streamer structure. Finally, we perform comparative studies by artificially increasing the photoionization intensity through multiplying the photoionization source term Sph by a factor of 50 (50*Sph) relative to the baseline intensity. Regarding breakdown voltage prediction, 50*Sph leads to a significant underestimation of the breakdown voltage for positive streamers, introducing errors greater than 0.5 kV, while exerting a small impact on negative streamers. Regarding streamer propagation dynamics, the radius of the positive streamer head exhibits pronounced shrinking, and 50*Sph reduces this shrinking and significantly lowers the head field by more than 700 Td. In contrast, 50*Sph has little impact on the morphology of the negative streamers and slightly enhances the head field by less than 30 Td.

### QJoin: Transformation-aware Joinable Data Discovery Using Reinforcement Learning
**Authors**: Ning Wang, Sainyam Galhotra

**Updated**: 2025-12-02T06:05:48Z

**Summary**: Discovering which tables in large, heterogeneous repositories can be joined and by what transformations is a central challenge in data integration and data discovery. Traditional join discovery methods are largely designed for equi-joins, which assume that join keys match exactly or nearly so. These techniques, while efficient in clean, well-normalized databases, fail in open or federated settings where identifiers are inconsistently formatted, embedded, or split across multiple columns. Approximate or fuzzy joins alleviate minor string variations but cannot capture systematic transformations. We introduce QJoin, a reinforcement-learning framework that learns and reuses transformation strategies across join tasks. QJoin trains an agent under a uniqueness-aware reward that balances similarity with key distinctiveness, enabling it to explore concise, high-value transformation chains. To accelerate new joins, we introduce two reuse mechanisms: (i) agent transfer, which initializes new policies from pretrained agents, and (ii) transformation reuse, which caches successful operator sequences for similar column clusters. On the AutoJoin Web benchmark (31 table pairs), QJoin achieves an average F1-score of 91.0%. For 19,990 join tasks in NYC+Chicago open datasets, Qjoin reduces runtime by up to 7.4% (13,747 s) by using reusing. These results demonstrate that transformation learning and reuse can make join discovery both more accurate and more efficient.

### SpecPV: Improving Self-Speculative Decoding for Long-Context Generation via Partial Verification
**Authors**: Zhendong Tan, Xingjun Zhang, Chaoyi Hu, Junjie Peng, Kun Xia

**Updated**: 2025-12-02T02:15:33Z

**Summary**: Growing demands from tasks like code generation, deep reasoning, and long-document understanding have made long-context generation a crucial capability for large language models (LLMs). Speculative decoding is one of the most direct and effective approaches for accelerating generation. It follows a draft-verify paradigm, where a lightweight draft model proposes several candidate tokens and the target model verifies them. However, we find that as the context length grows, verification becomes the dominant bottleneck. To further accelerate speculative decoding in long-context generation, we introduce SpecPV, a self-speculative decoding approach that performs fast verification using partial key-value states (KV) and periodically applies full verification to eliminate accumulated errors. We validate SpecPV across multiple long-context benchmarks and models, including LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct and Qwen3-series. Experimental results show that SpecPV achieves up to 6x decoding speedup over standard autoregressive decoding with minor degradation.

### Optimizing CPU Cache Utilization in Cloud VMs with Accurate Cache Abstraction
**Authors**: Mani Tofigh, Edward Guo, Weiwei Jia, Xiaoning Ding, Zirui Neil Zhao, Jianchen Shan

**Updated**: 2025-12-02T01:24:46Z

**Summary**: This paper shows that cache-based optimizations are often ineffective in cloud virtual machines (VMs) due to limited visibility into and control over provisioned caches. In public clouds, CPU caches can be partitioned or shared among VMs, but a VM is unaware of cache provisioning details. Moreover, a VM cannot influence cache usage via page placement policies, as memory-to-cache mappings are hidden. The paper proposes a novel solution, CacheX, which probes accurate and fine-grained cache abstraction within VMs using eviction sets without requiring hardware or hypervisor support, and showcases the utility of the probed information with two new techniques: LLC contention-aware task scheduling and virtual color-aware page cache management. Our evaluation of CacheX's implementation in x86 Linux kernel demonstrates that it can effectively improve cache utilization for various workloads in public cloud VMs.

### Soft-Label Caching and Sharpening for Communication-Efficient Federated Distillation
**Authors**: Kitsuya Azuma, Takayuki Nishio, Yuichi Kitagawa, Wakako Nakano, Takahito Tanimura

**Updated**: 2025-12-02T00:43:12Z

**Summary**: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across decentralized clients, enhancing privacy by keeping data local. Yet conventional FL, relying on frequent parameter-sharing, suffers from high communication overhead and limited model heterogeneity. Distillation-based FL approaches address these issues by sharing predictions (soft-labels, i.e., normalized probability distributions) instead, but they often involve redundant transmissions across communication rounds, reducing efficiency. We propose SCARLET, a novel framework integrating synchronized soft-label caching and an enhanced Entropy Reduction Aggregation (Enhanced ERA) mechanism. SCARLET minimizes redundant communication by reusing cached soft-labels, achieving up to 50% reduction in communication costs compared to existing methods while maintaining competitive accuracy. Enhanced ERA resolves the fundamental instability of conventional temperature-based aggregation, ensuring robust control and high performance in diverse client scenarios. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that SCARLET consistently outperforms state-of-the-art distillation-based FL methods in terms of accuracy and communication efficiency. The implementation of SCARLET is publicly available at https://github.com/kitsuyaazuma/SCARLET.

### Trinity: Disaggregating Vector Search from Prefill-Decode Disaggregation in LLM Serving
**Authors**: Yi Liu, Chen Qian

**Updated**: 2025-12-01T23:53:42Z

**Summary**: Prefill and decode (PD) disaggregation separates prompt prefill and token-by-token decode stages into distinct GPU pools and has become the dominant architecture for large-scale LLM serving in industry. Also, retrieval tasks via vector search remains entangled with the model inference process, like heterogeneous RAG requests and prompt answer caches, inflating tail latency. We are motivated to investigate how vector search should be orchestrated along with PD disaggregation with a dedicated deployment architecture without violating SLOs in various retrieval workloads. We present Trinity, a practical framework that consolidates all retrieval into a single, shared vector-search GPU pool and make it work with PD disaggregated LLM serving in match. Trinity introduces (1) a novel architecture for deploying GPU-based vector search service in PD disaggregation. (2) Continuous batching for vector search that make full used of GPUs under heterogeneous queries; (3) Stage-aware scheduling that preempts vector search requests between both decode and prefill tasks.

**Authors**: Jingyang Lin, Jialian Wu, Ximeng Sun, Ze Wang, Jiang Liu, Yusheng Su, Xiaodong Yu, Hao Chen, Jiebo Luo, Zicheng Liu, Emad Barsoum

**Updated**: 2025-12-01T22:47:17Z

**Summary**: Recent long-form video-language understanding benchmarks have driven progress in video large multimodal models (Video-LMMs). However, the scarcity of well-annotated long videos has left the training of hour-long Video-LMMs underexplored. To close this gap, we present VideoMarathon, a large-scale hour-long video instruction-following dataset. This dataset includes around 9,700 hours of long videos sourced from diverse domains, ranging from 3 to 60 minutes per video. Specifically, it contains 3.3M high-quality QA pairs, spanning six fundamental topics: temporality, spatiality, object, action, scene, and event. Compared to existing video instruction datasets, VideoMarathon significantly extends training video durations up to 1 hour, and supports 22 diverse tasks requiring both short- and long-term video comprehension. Building on VideoMarathon, we propose Hour-LLaVA, a powerful and efficient Video-LMM for hour-scale video-language modeling. It enables hour-long video training and inference at 1-FPS sampling by leveraging a memory augmentation module, which adaptively integrates question-relevant and spatiotemporally informative semantics from the cached full video context. In our experiments, Hour-LLaVA achieves the best performance on multiple representative long video-language benchmarks, demonstrating the high quality of the VideoMarathon dataset and the superiority of the Hour-LLaVA model.

### From Memories to Maps: Mechanisms of In-Context Reinforcement Learning in Transformers
**Authors**: Ching Fang, Kanaka Rajan

**Updated**: 2025-12-01T21:56:32Z

**Summary**: Humans and animals show remarkable learning efficiency, adapting to new environments with minimal experience. This capability is not well captured by standard reinforcement learning algorithms that rely on incremental value updates. Rapid adaptation likely depends on episodic memory -- the ability to retrieve specific past experiences to guide decisions in novel contexts. Transformers provide a useful setting for studying these questions because of their ability to learn rapidly in-context and because their key-value architecture resembles episodic memory systems in the brain. We train a transformer to in-context reinforcement learn in a distribution of planning tasks inspired by rodent behavior. We then characterize the learning algorithms that emerge in the model. We first find that representation learning is supported by in-context structure learning and cross-context alignment, where representations are aligned across environments with different sensory stimuli. We next demonstrate that the reinforcement learning strategies developed by the model are not interpretable as standard model-free or model-based planning. Instead, we show that in-context reinforcement learning is supported by caching intermediate computations within the model's memory tokens, which are then accessed at decision time. Overall, we find that memory may serve as a computational resource, storing both raw experience and cached computations to support flexible behavior. Furthermore, the representations developed in the model resemble computations associated with the hippocampal-entorhinal system in the brain, suggesting that our findings may be relevant for natural cognition. Taken together, our work offers a mechanistic hypothesis for the rapid adaptation that underlies in-context learning in artificial and natural settings.

### Microbenchmarking NVIDIA's Blackwell Architecture: An in-depth Architectural Analysis
**Authors**: Aaron Jarmusch, Sunita Chandrasekaran

**Updated**: 2025-12-01T20:31:10Z

**Summary**: As GPU architectures rapidly evolve to meet the overcoming demands of exascale computing and machine learning, the performance implications of architectural innovations remain poorly understood across diverse workloads. NVIDIA's Blackwell (B200) generation introduce significant architectural advances including the 5th generation tensor cores, tensor memory (TMEM), decompression engine (DE), and dual chips; however systematic methodologies for quantifying these improvements lag behind hardware development cycles. We contribute an open-source microbenchmark suite that offers practical insights into optimizing workloads to fully utilize the rich feature sets of the modern GPU architecture. This work aims to enable application developers make informed architectural decisions and guide future GPU design directions.   Our work studies Blackwell GPUs, compares them to H200 generation with regards to the memory subsystem, tensor core pipeline and floating-point precisions (FP32, FP16, FP8, FP6, FP4). Our systematic evaluation of dense/sparse GEMM, transformer inference, and training workloads demonstrate that B200's tensor core enhancements achieves 1.56x higher mixed-precision throughput and 42% better energy efficiency than H200. Our memory analysis reveals 58% reduction in memory access latency in cache-misses, fundamentally changing optimal algorithm design strategies.

### KV Pareto: Systems-Level Optimization of KV Cache and Model Compression for Long Context Inference
**Authors**: Sai Gokhale, Devleena Das, Rajeev Patwari, Ashish Sirasao, Elliott Delaye

**Updated**: 2025-12-01T18:03:47Z

**Summary**: Long-context Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant memory bottlenecks during inference due to the linear growth of key-value (KV) cache with sequence length. While individual optimization techniques like KV cache quantization, chunked prefill, and model weight quantization have shown promise, their joint effects and optimal configurations for edge deployment remain underexplored. We introduce KV Pareto, a systems-level framework that systematically maps the trade-off frontier between total memory consumption and task accuracy across these three complementary optimization techniques. Our framework evaluates multiple LLM architectures (Qwen, Llama, Mistral) with varying KV quantization schemes (int2/4/8, mixed-precision), granularities (per-token, per-tensor, per-block), and 4-bit weight quantization via AWQ. Our framework identifies model-specific Pareto-optimal configurations that achieve 68-78% total memory reduction with minimal (1-3%) accuracy degradation on long-context tasks. We additionally verify the selected frontiers on additional benchmarks of Needle-in-a-Haystack, GSM8k and MMLU as well as extended context lengths of up to 128k to demonstrate the practical need of joint optimization for efficient LLM inference.

**Authors**: M. Adrover, L. Baudis, A. Bismark, A. P. Colijn, J. J. Cuenca-García, M. P. Decowski, M. Flierman, T. den Hollander

**Updated**: 2025-12-01T17:42:16Z

**Summary**: The Hamamatsu R12699-406-M2 is a $2\times2$ multi-anode 2-inch photomultiplier tube that offers a compact form factor, low intrinsic radioactivity, and high photocathode coverage. These characteristics make it a promising candidate for next-generation xenon-based direct detection dark matter experiments, such as XLZD and PandaX-xT. We present a detailed characterization of this photosensor operated in cold xenon environments, focusing on its single photoelectron response, dark count rate, light emission, and afterpulsing behavior. The device demonstrated a gain exceeding $2\cdot 10^6$ at the nominal voltage of -1.0 kV, along with a low dark count rate of $(0.4\pm0.2)\;\text{Hz/cm}^2$. Due to the compact design, afterpulses exhibited short delay times, resulting in some cases in an overlap with the light-induced signal. To evaluate its applicability in a realistic detector environment, two R12699-406-M2 units were deployed in a small-scale dual-phase xenon time projection chamber. The segmented $2\times2$ anode structure enabled lateral position reconstruction using a single photomultiplier tube, highlighting the potential of the sensor for effective event localization in future detectors.

### A Low-Cost Reliable Racetrack Cache Based on Data Compression
**Authors**: Elham Cheshmikhani, Fateme Shokouhinia, Hamed Farbeh

**Updated**: 2025-12-01T17:32:25Z

**Summary**: SRAM-based cache memory faces several scalability limitations in deep nanoscale technologies, e.g., high leakage current, low cell stability, and low density. Emerging Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) technologies have received lots of attention in recent years, where Racetrack Memory (RTM) is among the most promising ones. RTM has the highest density among all NVMs and its access performance is comparable to SRAM technology. Therefore, RTM is a suitable alternative for SRAM in the Last-Level Caches (LLCs). Despite all its benefits, RTM confronts different reliability challenges due to the stochastic behavior of its storage element and highly error-prone data shifting, leading to a high probability of multiple-bit errors. Conventional Error-Correcting Codes (ECCs) are either incapable of tolerating multiple-bit errors or require a large amount of extra storage for check bits. This paper proposes taking advantage of value locality for compressing data blocks and freeing up a large fraction of cache blocks for storing data redundancy of strong ECCs. Utilizing the proposed scheme, a large majority of cache blocks are protected by strong ECCs to tolerate multiple-bit errors without any storage overhead. The evaluation using gem5 full-system simulator demonstrates that the proposed scheme enhances the mean-time-to-failure of the cache by an average of 11.3x with less than 1% hardware and performance overhead.

### JFR: An Efficient Jump Frontier Relaxation Strategy for Bellman-Ford
**Authors**: Xin Wang, Xi Chen

**Updated**: 2025-12-01T15:35:53Z

**Summary**: We propose JFR, a Bellman-Ford-based optimization framework leveraging frontier contraction and abstract multi-hop jump propagation to accelerate shortest-path computation while strictly preserving correctness. JFR achieves substantial reductions in relaxation operations, ranging from 25 to 99 percent, across sparse, dense, and negative-edge graphs, ensuring robust performance even under adversarial or highly connected topologies. On ultra-large graphs with up to N=20,000 nodes and 295 million edges, JFR maintains strong operational reductions and comparable or improved runtime relative to SPFA-SLF, demonstrating consistent robustness across graph size and density. Lower relaxation counts imply reduced memory-access overheads and computational effort; this normalized work reduction highlights JFR's suitability for scenarios requiring high throughput or energy-conscious operation. Future work focuses on integrating high-performance queue structures, adaptive frontier strategies, and cache-aware techniques to further reduce constant-factor overheads and fully realize JFR's practical runtime potential.

### StarDist: A Code Generator for Distributed Graph Algorithms
**Authors**: Barenya Kumar Nandy, Rupesh Nasre

**Updated**: 2025-12-01T13:18:32Z

**Summary**: Relational data, occurring in the real world, are often structured as graphs, which provide the logical abstraction required to make analytical derivations simpler. As graphs get larger, the irregular access patterns exhibited in most graph algorithms, hamper performance. This, along with NUMA and physical memory limits, results in scaling complexities with sequential/shared memory frameworks. StarPlat's MPI backend abstracts away the programmatic complexity involved in designing optimal distributed graph algorithms. It provides an instrument for coding graph algorithms that scale over distributed memory. In this work, we provide an analysis-transformation framework that leverages general semantics associated with iterations involving nodes and their neighbors, within StarPlat, to aggregate communication. The framework scans for patterns that warrant re-ordering in neighborhood access patterns, aggregate communication, and avoid communication altogether with opportunistic caching in reduction constructs. We also architect an optimized bulk-reduction substrate using Open MPI's passive Remote Memory Access (RMA) constructs. We applied our optimization logic to StarPlat's distributed backend and outperformed d-Galois by 2.05 and DRONE by 1.44 times in Single Source Shortest Paths across several big data graphs.

### Efficient Low Rank Attention for Long-Context Inference in Large Language Models
**Authors**: Tenghui Li, Guoxu Zhou, Xuyang Zhao, Yuning Qiu, Qibin Zhao

**Updated**: 2025-12-01T12:51:25Z

**Summary**: As the length of input text grows, the key-value (KV) cache in LLMs imposes prohibitive GPU memory costs and limits long-context inference on resource constrained devices. Existing approaches, such as KV quantization and pruning, reduce memory usage but suffer from numerical precision loss or suboptimal retention of key-value pairs. We introduce Low Rank Query and Key attention (LRQK), a two-stage framework that jointly decomposes the full-precision query and key matrices into compact rank-\(r\) factors during the prefill stage, and then uses these low-dimensional projections to compute proxy attention scores in \(\mathcal{O}(lr)\) time at each decode step. By selecting only the top-\(k\) tokens and a small fixed set of recent tokens, LRQK employs a mixed GPU-CPU cache with a hit-and-miss mechanism that transfers only missing full-precision KV pairs, thereby preserving exact attention outputs while reducing CPU-GPU data movement. Extensive experiments on the RULER and LongBench benchmarks with LLaMA-3-8B and Qwen2.5-7B demonstrate that LRQK matches or surpasses leading sparse-attention methods in long context settings, while delivering significant memory savings with minimal loss in accuracy. Our code is available at https://github.com/tenghuilee/LRQK.

### RoMe: Row Granularity Access Memory System for Large Language Models
**Authors**: Hwayong Nam, Seungmin Baek, Jumin Kim, Michael Jaemin Kim, Jung Ho Ahn

**Updated**: 2025-12-01T11:14:31Z

**Summary**: Modern HBM-based memory systems have evolved over generations while retaining cache line granularity accesses. Preserving this fine granularity necessitated the introduction of bank groups and pseudo channels. These structures expand timing parameters and control overhead, significantly increasing memory controller scheduling complexity. Large language models (LLMs) now dominate deep learning workloads, streaming contiguous data blocks ranging from several kilobytes to megabytes per operation. In a conventional HBM-based memory system, these transfers are fragmented into hundreds of 32B cache line transactions. This forces the memory controller to employ unnecessarily intricate scheduling, leading to growing inefficiency.   To address this problem, we propose RoMe. RoMe accesses DRAM at row granularity and removes columns, bank groups, and pseudo channels from the memory interface. This design simplifies memory scheduling, thereby requiring fewer pins per channel. The freed pins are aggregated to form additional channels, increasing overall bandwidth by 12.5% with minimal extra pins. RoMe demonstrates how memory scheduling logic can be significantly simplified for representative LLM workloads, and presents an alternative approach for next-generation HBM-based memory systems achieving increased bandwidth with minimal hardware overhead.

### FlashVGGT: Efficient and Scalable Visual Geometry Transformers with Compressed Descriptor Attention
**Authors**: Zipeng Wang, Dan Xu

**Updated**: 2025-12-01T11:12:37Z

**Summary**: 3D reconstruction from multi-view images is a core challenge in computer vision. Recently, feed-forward methods have emerged as efficient and robust alternatives to traditional per-scene optimization techniques. Among them, state-of-the-art models like the Visual Geometry Grounding Transformer (VGGT) leverage full self-attention over all image tokens to capture global relationships. However, this approach suffers from poor scalability due to the quadratic complexity of self-attention and the large number of tokens generated in long image sequences. In this work, we introduce FlashVGGT, an efficient alternative that addresses this bottleneck through a descriptor-based attention mechanism. Instead of applying dense global attention across all tokens, FlashVGGT compresses spatial information from each frame into a compact set of descriptor tokens. Global attention is then computed as cross-attention between the full set of image tokens and this smaller descriptor set, significantly reducing computational overhead. Moreover, the compactness of the descriptors enables online inference over long sequences via a chunk-recursive mechanism that reuses cached descriptors from previous chunks. Experimental results show that FlashVGGT achieves reconstruction accuracy competitive with VGGT while reducing inference time to just 9.3% of VGGT for 1,000 images, and scaling efficiently to sequences exceeding 3,000 images. Our project page is available at https://wzpscott.github.io/flashvggt_page/.

### Tangram: Accelerating Serverless LLM Loading through GPU Memory Reuse and Affinity
**Authors**: Wenbin Zhu, Zhaoyan Shen, Zili Shao, Hongjun Dai, Feng Chen

**Updated**: 2025-12-01T07:10:34Z

**Summary**: Serverless Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a cost-effective solution for deploying AI services by enabling a 'pay-as-you-go' pricing model through GPU resource sharing. However, cold-start latency, especially the model loading phase, has become a critical performance bottleneck, as it scales linearly with model size and severely limits the practical deployment of large-scale LLM services. This paper presents Tangram, a novel system that accelerates Serverless LLM loading through efficient GPU memory reuse. By leveraging the unused GPU memory to retain model parameters, Tangram significantly reduces model transfer time and cold-start latency. Its design includes three key components: unified GPU memory pool for tensor-level parameter sharing across models, on-demand KV cache allocation for dynamic memory management, and GPU-affinity-aware scheduling for maximizing resource utilization. These techniques collectively address the critical challenges of inefficient memory usage and the cold-start problem in Serverless LLM platforms. We have implemented a fully functional prototype, and experiments show that Tangram achieves up to 6.2 times faster loading and reduces Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) during cold-start by 23--55% over state-of-the-art methods.

### FreeSwim: Revisiting Sliding-Window Attention Mechanisms for Training-Free Ultra-High-Resolution Video Generation
**Authors**: Yunfeng Wu, Jiayi Song, Zhenxiong Tan, Zihao He, Songhua Liu

**Updated**: 2025-12-01T06:11:56Z

**Summary**: The quadratic time and memory complexity of the attention mechanism in modern Transformer based video generators makes end-to-end training for ultra high resolution videos prohibitively expensive. Motivated by this limitation, we introduce a training-free approach that leverages video Diffusion Transformers pretrained at their native scale to synthesize higher resolution videos without any additional training or adaptation. At the core of our method lies an inward sliding window attention mechanism, which originates from a key observation: maintaining each query token's training scale receptive field is crucial for preserving visual fidelity and detail. However, naive local window attention, unfortunately, often leads to repetitive content and exhibits a lack of global coherence in the generated results. To overcome this challenge, we devise a dual-path pipeline that backs up window attention with a novel cross-attention override strategy, enabling the semantic content produced by local attention to be guided by another branch with a full receptive field and, therefore, ensuring holistic consistency. Furthermore, to improve efficiency, we incorporate a cross-attention caching strategy for this branch to avoid the frequent computation of full 3D attention. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method delivers ultra-high-resolution videos with fine-grained visual details and high efficiency in a training-free paradigm. Meanwhile, it achieves superior performance on VBench, even compared to training-based alternatives, with competitive or improved efficiency.

### Accelerating Large-Scale Reasoning Model Inference with Sparse Self-Speculative Decoding
**Authors**: Yilong Zhao, Jiaming Tang, Kan Zhu, Zihao Ye, Chi-Chih Chang, Chaofan Lin, Jongseok Park, Guangxuan Xiao, Mohamed S. Abdelfattah, Mingyu Gao, Baris Kasikci, Song Han, Ion Stoica

**Updated**: 2025-12-01T04:50:55Z

**Summary**: Reasoning language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities on challenging tasks by generating elaborate chain-of-thought (CoT) solutions. However, such lengthy generation shifts the inference bottleneck from compute-bound to memory-bound. To generate each token, the model applies full attention to all previously generated tokens, requiring memory access to an increasingly large KV-Cache. Consequently, longer generations demand more memory access for every step, leading to substantial pressure on memory bandwidth.   To address this, we introduce SparseSpec, a speculative decoding framework that reuses the same model as the draft and target models (i.e., self-speculation). SparseSpec features a novel sparse attention mechanism, PillarAttn, as the draft model, which accurately selects critical tokens via elegantly reusing information from the verification stage. Furthermore, SparseSpec co-designs self-speculation with three system innovations: (1) a unified scheduler to batch token drafting and verification, (2) delayed verification for CPU/GPU overlap, and (3) dynamic KV-Cache management to maximize memory utilization. Across various models and datasets, SparseSpec outperforms state-of-the-art solutions, with an up to 2.13x throughput speedup.

### EPLKG: Efficient Prompt Learning with Knowledge Graph
**Authors**: YongTaek Lim, Suho Kang, Yewon Kim, Dokyung Yoon, KyungWoo Song

**Updated**: 2025-11-30T14:24:30Z

**Summary**: Large-scale pre-trained models such as CLIP excel in transferability and robust generalization across diverse datasets. However, adapting these models to new datasets or domains is computationally costly, especially in low-resource or few-shot settings, and existing prompt-learning methods often lack interpretability. We introduce Efficient Prompt Learning with Knowledge Graph (EPLKG), which uses a knowledge graph to curate diverse, interpretable prompts and, where KG coverage is limited, augments this bank with LLM-generated human-readable visual descriptions. EPLKG operates entirely on cached CLIP image and text embeddings and employs a lightweight Gumbel-Softmax module to select a single prompt per image-class pair, enabling low-memory, fast training. Across 11 benchmarks, EPLKG reduces per-image training time by up to 45 percent and peak GPU memory by around 30 to 40 percent compared to strong prompt-learning baselines, while keeping the average base-new harmonic-mean accuracy within 2 percentage points, thereby improving the efficiency of model adaptation without sacrificing competitive performance or interpretability.

### SwiftVLA: Unlocking Spatiotemporal Dynamics for Lightweight VLA Models at Minimal Overhead
**Authors**: Chaojun Ni, Cheng Chen, Xiaofeng Wang, Zheng Zhu, Wenzhao Zheng, Boyuan Wang, Tianrun Chen, Guosheng Zhao, Haoyun Li, Zhehao Dong, Qiang Zhang, Yun Ye, Yang Wang, Guan Huang, Wenjun Mei

**Updated**: 2025-11-30T14:10:28Z

**Summary**: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models built on pretrained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show strong potential but are limited in practicality due to their large parameter counts. To mitigate this issue, using a lightweight VLM has been explored, but it compromises spatiotemporal reasoning. Although some methods suggest that incorporating additional 3D inputs can help, they usually rely on large VLMs to fuse 3D and 2D inputs and still lack temporal understanding. Therefore, we propose SwiftVLA, an architecture that enhances a compact model with 4D understanding while preserving design efficiency. Specifically, our approach features a pretrained 4D visual geometry transformer with a temporal cache that extracts 4D features from 2D images. Then, to enhance the VLM's ability to exploit both 2D images and 4D features, we introduce Fusion Tokens, a set of learnable tokens trained with a future prediction objective to generate unified representations for action generation. Finally, we introduce a mask-and-reconstruct strategy that masks 4D inputs to the VLM and trains the VLA to reconstruct them, enabling the VLM to learn effective 4D representations and allowing the 4D branch to be dropped at inference with minimal performance loss. Experiments in real and simulated environments show that SwiftVLA outperforms lightweight baselines and rivals VLAs up to 7 times larger, achieving comparable performance on edge devices while being 18 times faster and reducing memory footprint by 12 times.

### Accelerating Streaming Video Large Language Models via Hierarchical Token Compression
**Authors**: Yiyu Wang, Xuyang Liu, Xiyan Gui, Xinying Lin, Boxue Yang, Chenfei Liao, Tailai Chen, Linfeng Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-11-30T13:44:28Z

**Summary**: Streaming Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across various video understanding tasks, but they face significant challenges in real-time deployment due to the high computational cost of processing dense visual tokens from continuous video streams. In streaming video scenarios, the primary bottleneck lies in the Vision Transformer (ViT) encoding stage, where redundant processing of temporally similar frames leads to inefficiency. Additionally, inflated token sequences during LLM pre-filling further exacerbate latency and memory overhead. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{S}treaming \textbf{T}oken \textbf{C}ompression (\textbf{STC}), a plug-and-play hierarchical framework that seamlessly integrates into existing streaming VideoLLMs, optimizing both ViT encoding and LLM pre-filling stages to accelerate processing. STC introduces two token-level accelerators: \textbf{STC-Cacher}, which reduces ViT encoding overhead by caching and reusing features from temporally similar frames, and \textbf{STC-Pruner}, which compresses the visual token sequence before it enters the LLM, preserving only the most salient tokens based on both spatial and temporal relevance. Extensive experiments on four baseline streaming VideoLLMs across five benchmarks demonstrate that STC outperforms other compression methods. Notably, STC retains up to \textbf{99\%} of accuracy on the ReKV framework while reducing ViT encoding latency and LLM pre-filling latency by \textbf{24.5\%} and \textbf{45.3\%}.

### SpeContext: Enabling Efficient Long-context Reasoning with Speculative Context Sparsity in LLMs
**Authors**: Jiaming Xu, Jiayi Pan, Hanzhen Wang, Yongkang Zhou, Jiancai Ye, Yu Wang, Guohao Dai

**Updated**: 2025-11-30T04:32:43Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we point out that the objective of the retrieval algorithms is to align with the LLM, which is similar to the objective of knowledge distillation in LLMs. We analyze the similarity in information focus between the distilled language model(DLM) and the original LLM from the perspective of information theory, and thus propose a novel paradigm that leverages a DLM as the retrieval algorithm. Based on the insight, we present SpeContext, an algorithm and system co-design for long-context reasoning. (1) At the algorithm level, SpeContext proposes lightweight retrieval head based on the head-level attention weights of DLM, achieving > 90% parameters reduction by pruning the redundancy. (2) At the system level, SpeContext designs an asynchronous prefetch dataflow via the elastic loading strategy, effectively overlapping KV cache retrieval with the LLM computation. (3) At the compilation level, SpeContext constructs the theoretical memory model and implements an adaptive memory management system to achieve acceleration by maximizing GPU memory utilization. We deploy and evaluate SpeContext in two resourceconstrained environments, cloud and edge. Extensive experiments show that, compared with the Huggingface framework, SpeContext achieves up to 24.89x throughput improvement in cloud and 10.06x speedup in edge with negligible accuracy loss, pushing the Pareto frontier of accuracy and throughput.

### SIMPLE: Disaggregating Sampling from GPU Inference into a Decision Plane for Faster Distributed LLM Serving
**Authors**: Bohan Zhao, Zane Cao, Yongchao He

**Updated**: 2025-11-30T04:15:34Z

**Summary**: As large language models (LLMs) scale out with tensor parallelism (TP) and pipeline parallelism (PP) and production stacks have aggressively optimized the data plane (attention/GEMM and KV cache), sampling, the decision plane that turns logits into tokens, becomes a new bottleneck. This creates a structural holdout: sampling neither expands with TP nor balances across PP stages, so its share of iteration time grows as GPUs get faster and it caps pipeline frequency at the last stage. We present SIMPLE, a stage-agnostic, sequence-parallel, overlappable decision plane that disaggregates sampling into a CPU-side service and shrinks its runtime footprint back to a minor, hidden role. SIMPLE combines: (1) sequence-parallel sampling, which shards work along the batch dimension and removes vocabulary-axis collectives; (2) a CPU-based algorithm with column-wise penalties and truncation-first filtering to realize single-pass, linear-time kernels; and (3) speculative hot-vocab sampling (SHVS), which samples on a small hot set with rejection-correctness and uses a simple sizing model to choose the hot-vocab size that maximizes throughput. In evaluation, SIMPLE improves end-to-end throughput by up to 96% and reduces P95 latency by 20-65%. Crucially, SIMPLE requires no user-side code changes and composes with existing data-plane optimizations, unlocking scaling benefits that compound with future GPU generations.

### Extended Abstract: Synthesizable Low-overhead Circuit-level Countermeasures and Pro-Active Detection Techniques for Power and EM SCA
**Authors**: Archisman Ghosh

**Updated**: 2025-11-29T21:12:22Z

**Summary**: The gamut of todays internet-connected embedded devices has led to increased concerns regarding the security and confidentiality of data. Most internet-connected embedded devices employ mathematically secure cryptographic algorithms to address security vulnerabilities. Despite such mathematical guarantees, as these algorithms are often implemented in silicon, they leak critical information in terms of power consumption, electromagnetic (EM) radiation, timing, cache hits and misses, photonic emission and so on, leading to side-channel analysis (SCA) attacks. This thesis focuses on low overhead generic circuit-level yet synthesizable countermeasures against power and EM SCA. Existing countermeasures (including proposed) still have relatively high overhead which bars them from being used in energy-constraint IoT devices. We propose a zero-overhead integrated inductive sensor which is able to detect i)EM SCA ii) Clock glitch-based Fault Injection Attack (FIA), and iii) Voltage-glitch based Fault Injection Attack by using a simple ML algorithm. Advent of quantum computer research will open new possibilities for theoretical attacks against existing cryptographic protocols. National Institute of Standard & Technology (NIST) has standardized post-quantum cryptographic algorithms to secure crypto-systems against quantum adversary. I contribute to the standardization procedure by introducing the first silicon-verified Saber (a NIST finalist modulo Learning with Rounding scheme) which consumes lowest energy and area till date amongst all the candidates.

**Authors**: Mengqi Liao, Lu Wang, Chaoyun Zhang, Zekai Shen, Xiaowei Mao, Si Qin, Qingwei Lin, Saravan Rajmohan, Dongmei Zhang, Huaiyu Wan

**Updated**: 2025-11-29T14:21:33Z

**Summary**: Recent reasoning large language models (LLMs) excel in complex tasks but encounter significant computational and memory challenges due to long sequence lengths. KV cache compression has emerged as an effective approach to greatly enhance the efficiency of reasoning. However, existing methods often focus on prompt compression or token eviction with local attention score, overlooking the long-term importance of tokens. We propose G-KV, a KV cache eviction method that employs a global scoring mechanism, combining local and historical attention scores to more accurately assess token importance. Additionally, we introduce post-training techniques, including reinforcement learning and distillation, to optimize models for compressed KV cache settings. The code of this paper is available on: https://github.com/microsoft/G-KV.

### TGSFormer: Scalable Temporal Gaussian Splatting for Embodied Semantic Scene Completion
**Authors**: Rui Qian, Haozhi Cao, Tianchen Deng, Tianxin Hu, Weixiang Guo, Shenghai Yuan, Lihua Xie

**Updated**: 2025-11-29T03:47:14Z

**Summary**: Embodied 3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) infers dense geometry and semantics from continuous egocentric observations. Most existing Gaussian-based methods rely on random initialization of many primitives within predefined spatial bounds, resulting in redundancy and poor scalability to unbounded scenes. Recent depth-guided approach alleviates this issue but remains local, suffering from latency and memory overhead as scale increases. To overcome these challenges, we propose TGSFormer, a scalable Temporal Gaussian Splatting framework for embodied SSC. It maintains a persistent Gaussian memory for temporal prediction, without relying on image coherence or frame caches. For temporal fusion, a Dual Temporal Encoder jointly processes current and historical Gaussian features through confidence-aware cross-attention. Subsequently, a Confidence-aware Voxel Fusion module merges overlapping primitives into voxel-aligned representations, regulating density and maintaining compactness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TGSFormer achieves state-of-the-art results on both local and embodied SSC benchmarks, offering superior accuracy and scalability with significantly fewer primitives while maintaining consistent long-term scene integrity. The code will be released upon acceptance.

### Multi-Mode Lens for Momentum Microscopy and XPEEM: Theory
**Authors**: Olena Tkach, Gerd Schoenhense

**Updated**: 2025-11-28T21:55:41Z

**Summary**: The strong electric field between the sample and the extractor is the core of cathode lenses and a pivotal determinant of high resolution. Nevertheless, fields in the range of 3-8 kV/mm can be a source of complications. Local field enhancement at sharp edges or microscopic protrusions of cleaved samples may result in field emission or flashovers. Moreover, slow background electrons are drawn into the microscope column, where they contribute to space charge effects. A novel front lens configuration, optimized through ray-tracing simulations, significantly reduces the field at the sample and allows even for zero field or retarding field, which serves to suppress space charge effects. One or several annular electrodes, situated in a concentric position relative to the extractor, serve to form an additional lens within the gap between the sample and the extractor. The refractory power of this lens, and consequently the field at the sample surface, can be modified by adjusting the potentials of the annular electrodes. The imaging properties and aberrations of this gap lens have been investigated with regard to momentum imaging and XPEEM. The study encompasses the energy range from the few-eV level for laser-ARPES to 6 keV, for hard X-ray ARPES. The additional converging lens situated in close proximity to the sample exhibits a reduced field curvature of the k-image in the backfocal plane. This allows for the acquisition of larger fields of view in both momentum and real-space imaging.

### Buffer replay enhances the robustness of multimodal learning under missing-modality
**Authors**: Hongye Zhu, Xuan Liu, Yanwen Ba, Jingye Xue, Shigeng Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-11-28T10:55:31Z

**Summary**: Missing modalities consistently lead to significant performance degradation in multimodal models. Existing approaches either synthesize missing modalities at high computational cost or apply prompt-based fine-tuning that relies only on adjacent-layer features and overlooks long-distance contextual information, which may offer additional tolerance to errors when one or more modalities are missing. To address this, we introduce REplay Prompting (REP): (1) construct modality-wise feature buffers via a residual bypass to cache early-layer representations and replay them in deeper layers, mitigating information loss as network depth increases; (2) employ a private-shared feature decoupling strategy, where private buffers preserve modality-specific signals and shared buffers encode cross-modal semantics; and (3) design a task-aware dynamic initialization mechanism to configure these buffers differently, improving stability and generalization under diverse missing-modality conditions. Experiments on vision-language, vision-language-audio, and temporal multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that REP consistently outperforms prior methods under both single- and multi-modality missing scenarios, while introducing only negligible parameter overhead. These results establish REP as a lightweight and effective paradigm for robust multimodal learning in challenging missing-modality environments.

### Cohet: A CXL-Driven Coherent Heterogeneous Computing Framework with Hardware-Calibrated Full-System Simulation
**Authors**: Yanjing Wang, Lizhou Wu, Sunfeng Gao, Yibo Tang, Junhui Luo, Zicong Wang, Yang Ou, Dezun Dong, Nong Xiao, Mingche Lai

**Updated**: 2025-11-28T09:22:37Z

**Summary**: Conventional heterogeneous computing systems built on PCIe interconnects suffer from inefficient fine-grained host-device interactions and complex programming models. In recent years, many proprietary and open cache-coherent interconnect standards have emerged, among which compute express link (CXL) prevails in the open-standard domain after acquiring several competing solutions. Although CXL-based coherent heterogeneous computing holds the potential to fundamentally transform the collaborative computing mode of CPUs and XPUs, research in this direction remains hampered by the scarcity of available CXL-supported platforms, immature software/hardware ecosystems, and unclear application prospects. This paper presents Cohet, the first CXL-driven coherent heterogeneous computing framework. Cohet decouples the compute and memory resources to form unbiased CPU and XPU pools which share a single unified and coherent memory pool. It exposes a standard malloc/mmap interface to both CPU and XPU compute threads, leaving the OS dealing with smart memory allocation and management of heterogeneous resources. To facilitate Cohet research, we also present a full-system cycle-level simulator named SimCXL, which is capable of modeling all CXL sub-protocols and device types. SimCXL has been rigorously calibrated against a real CXL testbed with various CXL memory and accelerators, showing an average simulation error of 3%. Our evaluation reveals that CXL.cache reduces latency by 68% and increases bandwidth by 14.4x compared to DMA transfers at cacheline granularity. Building upon these insights, we demonstrate the benefits of Cohet with two killer apps, which are remote atomic operation (RAO) and remote procedure call (RPC). Compared to PCIe-NIC design, CXL-NIC achieves a 5.5 to 40.2x speedup for RAO offloading and an average speedup of 1.86x for RPC (de)serialization offloading.

### BlockVid: Block Diffusion for High-Quality and Consistent Minute-Long Video Generation
**Authors**: Zeyu Zhang, Shuning Chang, Yuanyu He, Yizeng Han, Jiasheng Tang, Fan Wang, Bohan Zhuang

**Updated**: 2025-11-28T08:25:59Z

**Summary**: Generating minute-long videos is a critical step toward developing world models, providing a foundation for realistic extended scenes and advanced AI simulators. The emerging semi-autoregressive (block diffusion) paradigm integrates the strengths of diffusion and autoregressive models, enabling arbitrary-length video generation and improving inference efficiency through KV caching and parallel sampling. However, it yet faces two enduring challenges: (i) KV-cache-induced long-horizon error accumulation, and (ii) the lack of fine-grained long-video benchmarks and coherence-aware metrics. To overcome these limitations, we propose BlockVid, a novel block diffusion framework equipped with semantic-aware sparse KV cache, an effective training strategy called Block Forcing, and dedicated chunk-wise noise scheduling and shuffling to reduce error propagation and enhance temporal consistency. We further introduce LV-Bench, a fine-grained benchmark for minute-long videos, complete with new metrics evaluating long-range coherence. Extensive experiments on VBench and LV-Bench demonstrate that BlockVid consistently outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality, coherent minute-long videos. In particular, it achieves a 22.2% improvement on VDE Subject and a 19.4% improvement on VDE Clarity in LV-Bench over the state of the art approaches. Project website: https://ziplab.co/BlockVid.

### The Immutable Tensor Architecture: A Pure Dataflow Approach for Secure, Energy-Efficient AI Inference
**Authors**: Fang Li

**Updated**: 2025-11-28T05:36:12Z

**Summary**: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) on consumer edge devices is throttled by the "Memory Wall" -- the prohibitive bandwidth and energy cost of fetching gigabytes of model weights from DRAM for every token generated. Current architectures (GPUs, NPUs) treat model weights as mutable software data, incurring massive energy penalties to maintain general-purpose programmability. We propose The Immutable Tensor Architecture (ITA), a paradigm shift that treats model weights not as data, but as physical circuit topology. By encoding parameters directly into the metal interconnects and logic of mature-node ASICs (28nm/40nm), ITA eliminates the memory hierarchy entirely. We present a "Split-Brain" system design where a host CPU manages dynamic KV-cache operations while the ITA ASIC acts as a stateless, ROM-embedded dataflow engine.

**Authors**: Shashwat Jaiswal, Shrikara Arun, Anjaly Parayil, Ankur Mallick, Spyros Mastorakis, Alind Khare, Chloi Alverti, Renee St Amant, Chetan Bansal, Victor Rühle, Josep Torrellas

**Updated**: 2025-11-28T05:04:02Z

**Summary**: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has become the de facto method for parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs), enabling rapid adaptation to diverse domains. In production, LoRA-based models are served at scale, creating multi-tenant environments with hundreds of adapters sharing a base model. However, state-of-the-art serving systems co-batch heterogeneous adapters without accounting for rank (size) variability, leading to severe performance skew, which ultimately requires adding more GPUs to satisfy service-level objectives (SLOs). Existing optimizations, focused on loading, caching, and kernel execution, ignore this heterogeneity, leaving GPU resources underutilized. We present LoRAServe, a workload-aware dynamic adapter placement and routing framework designed to tame rank diversity in LoRA serving. By dynamically rebalancing adapters across GPUs and leveraging GPU Direct RDMA for remote access, LoRAServe maximizes throughput and minimizes tail latency under real-world workload drift. Evaluations on production traces from Company X show that LoRAServe elicits up to 2$\times$ higher throughput, up to 9$\times$ lower TTFT, while using up to 50% fewer GPUs under SLO constraints compared to state-of-the-art systems.

### GLOW: Global Illumination-Aware Inverse Rendering of Indoor Scenes Captured with Dynamic Co-Located Light & Camera
**Authors**: Jiaye Wu, Saeed Hadadan, Geng Lin, Peihan Tu, Matthias Zwicker, David Jacobs, Roni Sengupta

**Updated**: 2025-11-28T03:24:12Z

**Summary**: Inverse rendering of indoor scenes remains challenging due to the ambiguity between reflectance and lighting, exacerbated by inter-reflections among multiple objects. While natural illumination-based methods struggle to resolve this ambiguity, co-located light-camera setups offer better disentanglement as lighting can be easily calibrated via Structure-from-Motion. However, such setups introduce additional complexities like strong inter-reflections, dynamic shadows, near-field lighting, and moving specular highlights, which existing approaches fail to handle. We present GLOW, a Global Illumination-aware Inverse Rendering framework designed to address these challenges. GLOW integrates a neural implicit surface representation with a neural radiance cache to approximate global illumination, jointly optimizing geometry and reflectance through carefully designed regularization and initialization. We then introduce a dynamic radiance cache that adapts to sharp lighting discontinuities from near-field motion, and a surface-angle-weighted radiometric loss to suppress specular artifacts common in flashlight captures. Experiments show that GLOW substantially outperforms prior methods in material reflectance estimation under both natural and co-located illumination.

### CacheTrap: Injecting Trojans in LLMs without Leaving any Traces in Inputs or Weights
**Authors**: Mohaiminul Al Nahian, Abeer Matar A. Almalky, Gamana Aragonda, Ranyang Zhou, Sabbir Ahmed, Dmitry Ponomarev, Li Yang, Shaahin Angizi, Adnan Siraj Rakin

**Updated**: 2025-11-27T18:30:19Z

**Summary**: Adversarial weight perturbation has emerged as a concerning threat to LLMs that either use training privileges or system-level access to inject adversarial corruption in model weights. With the emergence of innovative defensive solutions that place system- and algorithm-level checks and corrections in the input and weight spaces, these perturbations are increasingly susceptible to defenses. This work develops a novel perspective on Trojan attacks that generates an attacker-designed model output while leaving no attack traces on the inputs or weights. Such an attack space can be unlocked through corruption of the key-value (KV) cache. In this paper, we introduce CacheTrap, a novel Trojan attack that corrupts the value vectors stored in the KV cache. These vectors capture the dynamic activations for specific token positions and therefore constitute a natural surface for transient, inference-time trigger insertion. The transient nature of these KV values and their dependence on victim input imply additional constraints on our attack, such as a lack of knowledge of the victim's data or domain application, and, consequently, a lack of gradient information. The objective of the proposed CacheTrap is to develop a vulnerable KV bit-searching algorithm so that, once the attack employs the identified bit-flip as a trigger, the model generates targeted behavior, e.g., classifying inputs towards the target class. Moreover, CacheTrap is a data- and gradient-free attack which also has no impact on the model's utility. Our evaluation demonstrates that the proposed attack enables the first successful Trojan attack on LLMs with a single bit flip in the KV cache. In addition, the data-independent nature of the attack ensures that once the attacker identifies the vulnerable bit index, the location remains constant and can be transferred to a wide range of victim tasks/datasets/queries with no overhead.

### 3RSeT: Read Disturbance Rate Reduction in STT-MRAM Caches by Selective Tag Comparison
**Authors**: Elham Cheshmikhani, Hamed Farbeh, Hossein Asad

**Updated**: 2025-11-27T15:39:45Z

**Summary**: Recent development in memory technologies has introduced Spin-Transfer Torque Magnetic RAM (STT-MRAM) as the most promising replacement for SRAMs in on-chip cache memories. Besides its lower leakage power, higher density, immunity to radiation-induced particles, and non-volatility, an unintentional bit flip during read operation, referred to as read disturbance error, is a severe reliability challenge in STT-MRAM caches. One major source of read disturbance error in STT-MRAM caches is simultaneous accesses to all tags for parallel comparison operation in a cache set, which has not been addressed in previous work. This paper first demonstrates that high read accesses to tag array extremely increase the read disturbance rate and then proposes a low-cost scheme, so-called Read Disturbance Rate Reduction in STT-MRAM Caches by Selective Tag Comparison (3RSeT), to reduce the error rate by eliminating a significant portion of tag reads. 3RSeT proactively disables the tags that have no chance for hit, using low significant bits of the tags on each access request. Our evaluations using gem5 full-system cycle-accurate simulator show that 3RSeT reduces the read disturbance rate in the tag array by 71.8%, which results in 3.6x improvement in Mean Time To Failure (MTTF). In addition, the energy consumption is reduced by 62.1% without compromising performance and with less than 0.4% area overhead.

### Fast3Dcache: Training-free 3D Geometry Synthesis Acceleration
**Authors**: Mengyu Yang, Yanming Yang, Chenyi Xu, Chenxi Song, Yufan Zuo, Tong Zhao, Ruibo Li, Chi Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-11-27T15:13:32Z

**Summary**: Diffusion models have achieved impressive generative quality across modalities like 2D images, videos, and 3D shapes, but their inference remains computationally expensive due to the iterative denoising process. While recent caching-based methods effectively reuse redundant computations to speed up 2D and video generation, directly applying these techniques to 3D diffusion models can severely disrupt geometric consistency. In 3D synthesis, even minor numerical errors in cached latent features accumulate, causing structural artifacts and topological inconsistencies. To overcome this limitation, we propose Fast3Dcache, a training-free geometry-aware caching framework that accelerates 3D diffusion inference while preserving geometric fidelity. Our method introduces a Predictive Caching Scheduler Constraint (PCSC) to dynamically determine cache quotas according to voxel stabilization patterns and a Spatiotemporal Stability Criterion (SSC) to select stable features for reuse based on velocity magnitude and acceleration criterion. Comprehensive experiments show that Fast3Dcache accelerates inference significantly, achieving up to a 27.12% speed-up and a 54.8% reduction in FLOPs, with minimal degradation in geometric quality as measured by Chamfer Distance (2.48%) and F-Score (1.95%).

### Enhancing Trustworthiness with Mixed Precision: Benchmarks, Opportunities, and Challenges
**Authors**: Guanxi Lu, Hao Mark Chen, Zhiqiang Que, Wayne Luk, Hongxiang Fan

**Updated**: 2025-11-27T14:17:43Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising performance across various tasks. However, their autoregressive decoding process poses significant challenges for efficient deployment on existing AI hardware. Quantization alleviates memory and compute pressure by compressing weights, activations, and KV caches to low precisions while preserving generation quality. However, existing quantization frameworks typically focus on perplexity or classification accuracy, often omitting critical trustworthiness metrics. This gap introduces risks when applying quantized LLMs to downstream high-stakes domains such as finance and healthcare. In this work, we systematically investigate the impact of quantization on four trustworthiness metrics (adversarial robustness, fairness, machine ethics, and out-of-distribution robustness) and identify the instability across compression ratios and quantization methods. Building on these observations, we develop a novel precision-ensemble voting approach that leverages predictions from mixed-precision variants of the same model and consistently improves performance by up to $5.8\%$ on trustworthiness metrics. Our results highlight the importance of considering trustworthiness when developing model compression techniques and point to research opportunities at the intersection of compression and trustworthiness for safety-critical applications.

**Authors**: Jun Wang, Yunxiang Yao, Wenwei Kuang, Runze Mao, Zhenhao Sun, Zhuang Tao, Ziyang Zhang, Dengyu Li, Jiajun Chen, Zhili Wang, Kai Cui, Congzhi Cai, Longwen Lan, Ken Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-11-27T14:13:47Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models drive a wide range of modern AI applications but impose substantial challenges on large-scale serving systems due to intensive computation, strict latency constraints, and throughput bottlenecks. We introduce OmniInfer, a unified system-level acceleration framework designed to maximize end-to-end serving efficiency through fine-grained optimization of expert placement, cache compression, and scheduling. OmniInfer integrates three complementary components: OmniPlacement for load-aware Mixture-of-Experts scheduling, OmniAttn for sparse attention acceleration, and OmniProxy for disaggregation-aware request scheduling. Built atop vLLM, OmniInfer delivers system-wide performance gains through adaptive resource disaggregation, efficient sparsity exploitation, and global coordination across prefill and decode phases. Evaluated on DeepSeek-R1 within a 10-node Ascend 910C cluster, OmniInfer achieves 616 QPM, where the unified framework reduces TPOT by 36\%, and the superimposition of OmniProxy further slashes TTFT by 38\%.

### An Analytical and Empirical Investigation of Tag Partitioning for Energy-Efficient Reliable Cache
**Authors**: Elham Cheshmikhani, Hamed Farbeh

**Updated**: 2025-11-27T13:55:50Z

**Summary**: Associative cache memory significantly influences processor performance and energy consumption. Because it occupies over half of the chip area, cache memory is highly susceptible to transient and permanent faults, posing reliability challenges. As the only hardware-managed memory module, the cache tag array is the most active and critical component, dominating both energy usage and error rate. Tag partitioning is a widely used technique to reduce tag-access energy and enhance reliability. It divides tag comparison into two phases: first comparing the k lower bits, and then activating only the matching tag entries to compare the remaining higher bits. The key design parameter is the selection of the tag-splitting point k, which determines how many reads are eliminated. However, prior studies have chosen k intuitively, randomly, or empirically, without justification. Even experimentally determined values are ad-hoc and do not generalize across cache configurations due to high sensitivity to architectural parameters.   In this paper, we analytically show that choosing k too large or too small substantially reduces the effectiveness of tag partitioning. We then derive a formulation that determines the optimal splitting point based on cache configuration parameters. The formulation is convex, differentiable, and capable of precisely quantifying tag-partitioning efficiency for any k and configuration. To validate our model, we experimentally evaluate tag-partitioning efficiency and optimal k across a broad set of cache designs and demonstrate close agreement between analytical and experimental results. The proposed formulation enables designers and researchers to instantly compute the optimal tag-splitting point and accurately estimate tag-read reduction.

### EfficientNav: Towards On-Device Object-Goal Navigation with Navigation Map Caching and Retrieval
**Authors**: Zebin Yang, Sunjian Zheng, Tong Xie, Tianshi Xu, Bo Yu, Fan Wang, Jie Tang, Shaoshan Liu, Meng Li

**Updated**: 2025-11-27T13:54:42Z

**Summary**: Object-goal navigation (ObjNav) tasks an agent with navigating to the location of a specific object in an unseen environment. Embodied agents equipped with large language models (LLMs) and online constructed navigation maps can perform ObjNav in a zero-shot manner. However, existing agents heavily rely on giant LLMs on the cloud, e.g., GPT-4, while directly switching to small LLMs, e.g., LLaMA3.2-11b, suffer from significant success rate drops due to limited model capacity for understanding complex navigation maps, which prevents deploying ObjNav on local devices. At the same time, the long prompt introduced by the navigation map description will cause high planning latency on local devices. In this paper, we propose EfficientNav to enable on-device efficient LLM-based zero-shot ObjNav. To help the smaller LLMs better understand the environment, we propose semantics-aware memory retrieval to prune redundant information in navigation maps. To reduce planning latency, we propose discrete memory caching and attention-based memory clustering to efficiently save and re-use the KV cache. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that EfficientNav achieves 11.1% improvement in success rate on HM3D benchmark over GPT-4-based baselines, and demonstrates 6.7x real-time latency reduction and 4.7x end-to-end latency reduction over GPT-4 planner. Our code is available on https://github.com/PKU-SEC-Lab/EfficientNav.

### Semantic-Aware Caching for Efficient Image Generation in Edge Computing
**Authors**: Hanshuai Cui, Zhiqing Tang, Zhi Yao, Weijia Ji, Wei Zhao

**Updated**: 2025-11-27T12:58:25Z

**Summary**: Text-to-image generation employing diffusion models has attained significant popularity due to its capability to produce high-quality images that adhere to textual prompts. However, the integration of diffusion models faces critical challenges into resource-constrained mobile and edge environments because it requires multiple denoising steps from the original random noise. A practical way to speed up denoising is to initialize the process with a noised reference image that is similar to the target, since both images share similar layouts, structures, and details, allowing for fewer denoising steps. Based on this idea, we present CacheGenius, a hybrid image generation system in edge computing that accelerates generation by combining text-toimage and image-to-image workflows. It generates images from user text prompts using cached reference images. CacheGenius introduces a semantic-aware classified storage scheme and a request-scheduling algorithm that ensures semantic alignment between references and targets. To ensure sustained performance, it employs a cache maintenance policy that proactively evicts obsolete entries via correlation analysis. Evaluated in a distributed edge computing system, CacheGenius reduces generation latency by 41% and computational costs by 48% relative to baselines, while maintaining competitive evaluation metrics.

### PAT: Accelerating LLM Decoding via Prefix-Aware Attention with Resource Efficient Multi-Tile Kernel
**Authors**: Jinjun Yi, Zhixin Zhao, Yitao Hu, Ke Yan, Weiwei Sun, Hao Wang, Laiping Zhao, Yuhao Zhang, Wenxin Li, Keqiu Li

**Updated**: 2025-11-27T11:10:30Z

**Summary**: LLM serving is increasingly dominated by decode attention, which is a memory-bound operation due to massive KV cache loading from global memory. Meanwhile, real-world workloads exhibit substantial, hierarchical shared prefixes across requests (e.g., system prompts, tools/templates, RAG). Existing attention implementations fail to fully exploit prefix sharing: *one-query-per-CTA* execution repeatedly loads shared prefix KV cache, while *one-size-fits-all* tiling leaves on-chip resources idle and exacerbates bubbles for uneven KV lengths. These choices amplify memory bandwidth pressure and stall memory-bound decode attention.   This paper introduces PAT, a prefix-aware attention kernel implementation for LLM decoding that organizes execution with a pack-forward-merge paradigm. PAT packs queries by shared prefix to reduce repeated memory accesses, runs a customized multi-tile kernel to achieve high resource efficiency. It further applies practical multi-stream forwarding and KV splitting to reduce resource bubbles. The final merge performs online softmax with negligible overhead. We implement PAT as an off-the-shelf plugin for vLLM. Evaluation on both real-world and synthetic workloads shows that PAT reduces attention latency by 67.4% on average and TPOT by 13.6-83.4% under the same configurations against state-of-the-art attention kernels.

### MCTS-SQL: Light-Weight LLMs can Master the Text-to-SQL through Monte Carlo Tree Search
**Authors**: Shuozhi Yuan, Limin Chen, Miaomiao Yuan, Zhao Jin

**Updated**: 2025-11-27T09:37:42Z

**Summary**: Text-to-SQL is a fundamental yet challenging task in the NLP area, aiming at translating natural language questions into SQL queries. While recent advances in large language models have greatly improved performance, most existing approaches depend on models with tens of billions of parameters or costly APIs, limiting their applicability in resource-constrained environments. For real world, especially on edge devices, it is crucial for Text-to-SQL to ensure cost-effectiveness. Therefore, enabling the light-weight models for Text-to-SQL is of great practical significance. However, smaller LLMs often struggle with complicated user instruction, redundant schema linking or syntax correctness. To address these challenges, we propose MCTS-SQL, a novel framework that uses Monte Carlo Tree Search to guide SQL generation through multi-step refinement. Since the light-weight models' weak performance of single-shot prediction, we generate better results through several trials with feedback. However, directly applying MCTS-based methods inevitably leads to significant time and computational overhead. Driven by this issue, we propose a token-level prefix-cache mechanism that stores prior information during iterations, effectively improved the execution speed. Experiments results on the SPIDER and BIRD benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Using a small open-source Qwen2.5-Coder-1.5B, our method outperforms ChatGPT-3.5. When leveraging a more powerful model Gemini 2.5 to explore the performance upper bound, we achieved results competitive with the SOTA. Our findings demonstrate that even small models can be effectively deployed in practical Text-to-SQL systems with the right strategy.

### KeepKV: Achieving Periodic Lossless KV Cache Compression for Efficient LLM Inference
**Authors**: Yuxuan Tian, Zihan Wang, Yebo Peng, Aomufei Yuan, Zhiming Wang, Bairen Yi, Xin Liu, Yong Cui, Tong Yang

**Updated**: 2025-11-27T07:44:35Z

**Summary**: Efficient inference of large language models (LLMs) is hindered by an ever-growing key-value (KV) cache, making KV cache compression a critical research direction. Traditional methods selectively evict less important KV cache entries, which leads to information loss and hallucinations. Recently, merging-based strategies have been explored to retain more information by merging KV pairs that would be discarded; however, these existing approaches inevitably introduce inconsistencies in attention distributions before and after merging, causing degraded generation quality. To overcome this challenge, we propose KeepKV, a novel adaptive KV cache merging method designed to preserve performance under strict memory constraints, achieving single-step lossless compression and providing error bounds for multi-step compression. KeepKV introduces the Electoral Votes mechanism that records merging history and adaptively adjusts attention scores. Moreover, it further leverages a novel Zero Inference-Perturbation Merging method, compensating for attention loss resulting from cache merging. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks and LLM architectures demonstrate that KeepKV substantially reduces memory usage while successfully retaining essential context information, achieving over 2x inference throughput improvement and maintaining superior generation quality even with only 10% KV cache budgets.

### Statistical Independence Aware Caching for LLM Workflows
**Authors**: Yihan Dai, Dimitrios Stamatios Bouras, Haoxiang Jia, Sergey Mechtaev

**Updated**: 2025-11-27T05:16:28Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) inference is both expensive and slow. Local caching of responses offers a practical solution to reduce the cost and latency of LLM queries. In research contexts, caching also enhances reproducibility and provides flexibility for experimentation. However, naive reuse of cached responses compromises statistical independence, a critical property for probabilistic workflows. In applications of LLM for code, it underpins performance metrics such as Pass@k and uncertainty estimation, as well as algorithms like program repair loops and retries. Existing LLM caching systems lack ways to enforce statistical independence constraints. To address this, we introduce Mnimi, a cache design pattern that supports modular LLM workflows while ensuring statistical integrity at the component level. Its core innovation lies in encapsulating statistical constraints within the type of LLM references, allowing users to manage and transform these types according to the scope and requirements of their algorithm. We implemented this design pattern in Python using a combination of decorators and iterators over infinite sequences. A case study on SpecFix, an recent automated program specification repair system, highlights how Mnimi improves reproducibility, ease of debugging, time and cost efficiency while preserving statistical correctness.

### Clock2Q+: A Simple and Efficient Replacement Algorithm for Metadata Cache in VMware vSAN
**Authors**: Yiyan Zhai, Bintang Dwi Marthen, Sarath Balivada, Vamsi Sudhakar Bojji, Eric Knauft, Jitender Rohilla, Jiaqi Zuo, Quanxing Liu, Maxime Austruy, Wenguang Wang, Juncheng Yang

**Updated**: 2025-11-26T22:34:26Z

**Summary**: Cache replacement algorithms are critical building blocks of storage systems. This paper examines the characteristics of metadata caches and argues that they inherently exhibit correlated references, even when the corresponding data accesses do not contain correlated references. The presence of correlated references reduces the effectiveness of cache replacement algorithms because these references are often mistakenly categorized as hot blocks. Clock2Q+ is specifically designed for metadata caches and has been implemented in vSAN and VDFS, two flagship storage products of VMware by Broadcom. Similar to S3-FIFO, Clock2Q+ uses three queues; however, Clock2Q+ introduces a correlation window in the Small FIFO queue, where blocks in this window do not set the reference bit. This simple enhancement allows Clock2Q+ to outperform state-of-the-art replacement algorithms. Compared to S3-FIFO, the second-best performing algorithm, Clock2Q+ achieves up to a 28.5% lower miss ratio on metadata traces. Clock2Q+ possesses the essential properties required for large-scale storage systems: it has low CPU overhead on cache hits, low memory overhead, scales efficiently to multiple CPUs, and is both easy to tune and implement. Additionally, Clock2Q+ outperforms state-of-the-art cache replacement algorithms on data traces as well.

### Diagonal Scaling: A Multi-Dimensional Resource Model and Optimization Framework for Distributed Databases
**Authors**: Shahir Abdullah, Syed Rohit Zaman

**Updated**: 2025-11-26T17:36:15Z

**Summary**: Modern cloud databases present scaling as a binary decision: scale-out by adding nodes or scale-up by increasing per-node resources. This one-dimensional view is limiting because database performance, cost, and coordination overhead emerge from the joint interaction of horizontal elasticity and per-node CPU, memory, network bandwidth, and storage IOPS. As a result, systems often overreact to load spikes, underreact to memory pressure, or oscillate between suboptimal states. We introduce the Scaling Plane, a two-dimensional model in which each distributed database configuration is represented as a point (H, V), with H denoting node count and V a vector of resources. Over this plane, we define smooth approximations of latency, throughput, coordination overhead, and monetary cost, providing a unified view of performance trade-offs. We show analytically and empirically that optimal scaling trajectories frequently lie along diagonal paths: sequences of joint horizontal and vertical adjustments that simultaneously exploit cluster parallelism and per-node improvements. To compute such actions, we propose DIAGONALSCALE, a discrete local-search algorithm that evaluates horizontal, vertical, and diagonal moves in the Scaling Plane and selects the configuration minimizing a multi-objective function subject to SLA constraints. Using synthetic surfaces, microbenchmarks, and experiments on distributed SQL and KV systems, we demonstrate that diagonal scaling reduces p95 latency by up to 40 percent, lowers cost-per-query by up to 37 percent, and reduces rebalancing by 2 to 5 times compared to horizontal-only and vertical-only autoscaling. Our results highlight the need for multi-dimensional scaling models and provide a foundation for next-generation autoscaling in cloud database systems.

### Modeling the Effect of Data Redundancy on Speedup in MLFMA Near-Field Computation
**Authors**: Morteza Sadeghi

**Updated**: 2025-11-26T16:01:32Z

**Summary**: The near-field (P2P) operator in the Multilevel Fast Multipole Algorithm (MLFMA) is a performance bottleneck on GPUs due to poor memory locality. This work introduces data redundancy to improve spatial locality by reducing memory access dispersion. For validation of results, we propose an analytical model based on a Locality metric that combines data volume and access dispersion to predict speedup trends without hardware-specific profiling. The approach is validated on two MLFMA-based applications: an electromagnetic solver (DBIM-MLFMA) with regular structure, and a stellar dynamics code (PhotoNs-2.0) with irregular particle distribution. Results show up to 7X kernel speedup due to improved cache behavior. However, increased data volume raises overheads in data restructuring, limiting end-to-end application speedup to 1.04X. While the model cannot precisely predict absolute speedups, it reliably captures performance trends across different problem sizes and densities. The technique is injectable into existing implementations with minimal code changes. This work demonstrates that data redundancy can enhance GPU performance for P2P operator, provided locality gains outweigh data movement costs.

### Subjective Depth and Timescale Transformers: Learning Where and When to Compute
**Authors**: Frederico Wieser, Martin Benfeghoul, Haitham Bou Ammar, Jun Wang, Zafeirios Fountas

**Updated**: 2025-11-26T14:00:18Z

**Summary**: The rigid, uniform allocation of computation in standard Transformer (TF) architectures can limit their efficiency and scalability, particularly for large-scale models and long sequences. Addressing this, we introduce Subjective Depth Transformers (SDT) and Subjective Timescale Transformers (STT), two distinct architectures that leverage Bayesian surprise signals to dynamically route computation, learning where and when to compute within decoder-only TFs. SDT augments a decoder-only stack with alternating Decision and Dynamic layers: a Decision layer computes a full block 'posterior' and a lightweight 'prior,' while a Dynamic layer employs fixed-capacity Top-K routing based on Bayesian surprise (Expected and Unexpected Change), maintaining a static compute graph. STT extends this conditional computation to the temporal domain: a transition network predicts residual updates, forming a temporal 'change hypothesis' that informs a router to dynamically execute or bypass TF blocks for each token, managing KV-cache contributions. Both architectures exhibit the predicted shift from novelty to prediction driven gating over training, suggesting alignment with surprise based principles. While operating at reduced capacity, they offer preliminary insights into the compute-accuracy trade-offs of conditional computation. The proposed architectures establish a flexible framework for efficiency, reducing self-attention computation by 75% and KV-cache requirements by 50% within each compute skipping layer, setting a pathway for more efficient models.

### RIA: A Ranking-Infused Approach for Optimized listwise CTR Prediction
**Authors**: Guoxiao Zhang, Tan Qu, Ao Li, DongLin Ni, Qianlong Xie, Xingxing Wang

**Updated**: 2025-11-26T13:45:10Z

**Summary**: Reranking improves recommendation quality by modeling item interactions. However, existing methods often decouple ranking and reranking, leading to weak listwise evaluation models that suffer from combinatorial sparsity and limited representational power under strict latency constraints. In this paper, we propose RIA (Ranking-Infused Architecture), a unified, end-to-end framework that seamlessly integrates pointwise and listwise evaluation. RIA introduces four key components: (1) the User and Candidate DualTransformer (UCDT) for fine-grained user-item-context modeling; (2) the Context-aware User History and Target (CUHT) module for position-sensitive preference learning; (3) the Listwise Multi-HSTU (LMH) module to capture hierarchical item dependencies; and (4) the Embedding Cache (EC) module to bridge efficiency and effectiveness during inference. By sharing representations across ranking and reranking, RIA enables rich contextual knowledge transfer while maintaining low latency. Extensive experiments show that RIA outperforms state-of-the-art models on both public and industrial datasets, achieving significant gains in AUC and LogLoss. Deployed in Meituan advertising system, RIA yields a +1.69% improvement in Click-Through Rate (CTR) and a +4.54% increase in Cost Per Mille (CPM) in online A/B tests.

### Toward Secure Content-Centric Approaches for 5G-Based IoT: Advances and Emerging Trends
**Authors**: Ghada Jaber, Mohamed Ali Zormati, Walid Cavelius, Louka Chapiro, Mohamed El Ahmadi

**Updated**: 2025-11-26T12:34:53Z

**Summary**: The convergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) and 5G technologies is transforming modern communication systems by enabling massive connectivity, low latency, and high-speed data transmission. In this evolving landscape, Content-Centric Networking (CCN) is emerging as a promising alternative to traditional Internet Protocol (IP)-based architectures. CCN offers advantages such as in-network caching, scalability, and efficient content dissemination, all of which are particularly well-suited to the constraints of the IoT. However, deploying content-centric approaches in 5G-based IoT environments introduces significant security challenges. Key concerns include content authentication, data integrity, privacy protection, and resilience against attacks such as spoofing and cache poisoning. Such issues are exacerbated by the distributed, mobile, and heterogeneous nature of IoT and 5G systems. In this survey, we review and classify existing security solutions for content-centric architectures in IoT-5G scenarios. We highlight current trends, identify limitations in existing approaches, and outline future research directions with a focus on lightweight and adaptive security mechanisms.

### DynamicAdaptiveClimb: Adaptive Cache Replacement with Dynamic Resizing
**Authors**: Daniel Berend, Shlomi Dolev, Sweta Kumari, Dhruv Mishra, Marina Kogan-Sadetsky, Archit Somani

**Updated**: 2025-11-26T10:02:24Z

**Summary**: Efficient cache management is critical for optimizing the system performance, and numerous caching mechanisms have been proposed, each exploring various insertion and eviction strategies. In this paper, we present AdaptiveClimb and its extension, DynamicAdaptiveClimb, two novel cache replacement policies that leverage lightweight, cache adaptation to outperform traditional approaches. Unlike classic Least Recently Used (LRU) and Incremental Rank Progress (CLIMB) policies, AdaptiveClimb dynamically adjusts the promotion distance (jump) of the cached objects based on recent hit and miss patterns, requiring only a single tunable parameter and no per-item statistics. This enables rapid adaptation to changing access distributions while maintaining low overhead. Building on this foundation, DynamicAdaptiveClimb further enhances adaptability by automatically tuning the cache size in response to workload demands. Our comprehensive evaluation across a diverse set of real-world traces, including 1067 traces from 6 different datasets, demonstrates that DynamicAdaptiveClimb consistently achieves substantial speedups and higher hit ratios compared to other state-of-the-art algorithms. In particular, our approach achieves up to a 29% improvement in hit ratio and a substantial reduction in miss penalties compared to the FIFO baseline. Furthermore, it outperforms the next-best contenders, AdaptiveClimb and SIEVE [43], by approximately 10% to 15%, especially in environments characterized by fluctuating working set sizes. These results highlight the effectiveness of our approach in delivering efficient performance, making it well-suited for modern, dynamic caching environments.

### Generative Early Stage Ranking

**Updated**: 2025-11-26T06:29:18Z

**Summary**: Large-scale recommendations commonly adopt a multi-stage cascading ranking system paradigm to balance effectiveness and efficiency. Early Stage Ranking (ESR) systems utilize the "user-item decoupling" approach, where independently learned user and item representations are only combined at the final layer. While efficient, this design is limited in effectiveness, as it struggles to capture fine-grained user-item affinities and cross-signals. To address these, we propose the Generative Early Stage Ranking (GESR) paradigm, introducing the Mixture of Attention (MoA) module which leverages diverse attention mechanisms to bridge the effectiveness gap: the Hard Matching Attention (HMA) module encodes explicit cross-signals by computing raw match counts between user and item features; the Target-Aware Self Attention module generates target-aware user representations conditioned on the item, enabling more personalized learning; and the Cross Attention modules facilitate early and more enriched interactions between user-item features. MoA's specialized attention encodings are further refined in the final layer through a Multi-Logit Parameterized Gating (MLPG) module, which integrates the newly learned embeddings via gating and produces secondary logits that are fused with the primary logit. To address the efficiency and latency challenges, we have introduced a comprehensive suite of optimization techniques. These span from custom kernels that maximize the capabilities of the latest hardware to efficient serving solutions powered by caching mechanisms. The proposed GESR paradigm has shown substantial improvements in topline metrics, engagement, and consumption tasks, as validated by both offline and online experiments. To the best of our knowledge, this marks the first successful deployment of full target-aware attention sequence modeling within an ESR stage at such a scale.

### A Survey on Inference Engines for Large Language Models: Perspectives on Optimization and Efficiency
**Authors**: Sihyeong Park, Sungryeol Jeon, Chaelyn Lee, Seokhun Jeon, Byung-Soo Kim, Jemin Lee

**Updated**: 2025-11-26T05:49:31Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are widely applied in chatbots, code generators, and search engines. Workload such as chain-of-throught, complex reasoning, agent services significantly increase the inference cost by invoke the model repeatedly. Optimization methods such as parallelism, compression, and caching have been adopted to reduce costs, but the diverse service requirements make it hard to select the right method. Recently, specialized LLM inference engines have emerged as a key component for integrating the optimization methods into service-oriented infrastructures. However, a systematic study on inference engines is still lacking.This paper provides a comprehensive evaluation of 25 open-source and commercial inference engines. We examine each inference engine in terms of ease-of-use, ease-of-deployment, general-purpose support, scalability, and suitability for throughput- and latency-aware computation. Furthermore, we explore the design goals of each inference engine by investigating the optimization techniques it supports. In addition, we assess the ecosystem maturity of open source inference engines and handle the performance and cost policy of commercial solutions.We outline future research directions that include support for complex LLM-based services, support of various hardware, and enhanced security, offering practical guidance to researchers and developers in selecting and designing optimized LLM inference engines. We also provide a public repository to continually track developments in this fast-evolving field: \href{https://github.com/sihyeong/Awesome-LLM-Inference-Engine}{https://github.com/sihyeong/Awesome-LLM-Inference-Engine}.

### LLaMCAT: Optimizing Large Language Model Inference with Cache Arbitration and Throttling
**Authors**: Zhongchun Zhou, Chengtao Lai, Wei Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-11-26T04:28:23Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved unprecedented success across various applications, but their substantial memory requirements pose significant challenges to current memory system designs, especially during inference. Our work targets last-level cache (LLC) based architectures, including GPUs (e.g., NVIDIA GPUs) and AI accelerators. We introduce LLaMCAT, a novel approach to optimize the LLC for LLM inference. LLaMCAT combines Miss Status Holding Register (MSHR)- and load balance-aware cache arbitration with thread throttling to address stringent bandwidth demands and minimize cache stalls in KV Cache access. We also propose a hybrid simulation framework integrating analytical models with cycle-level simulators via memory traces, balancing architecture detail and efficiency.   Experiments demonstrate that LLaMCAT achieves an average speedup of 1.26x when the system is mainly bottlenecked by miss handling throughput, while baselines mostly show negative improvements since they are not optimized for this scenario. When the cache size is also limited, our policy achieves a speedup of 1.58x over the unoptimized version, and a 1.26x improvement over the best baseline (dyncta). Overall, LLaMCAT is the first to target LLM decoding-specific MSHR contention, a gap in previous work. It presents a practical solution for accelerating LLM inference on future hardware platforms.

### No Request Left Behind: Tackling Heterogeneity in Long-Context LLM Inference with Medha
**Authors**: Amey Agrawal, Haoran Qiu, Junda Chen, Íñigo Goiri, Chaojie Zhang, Rayyan Shahid, Ramachandran Ramjee, Alexey Tumanov, Esha Choukse

**Updated**: 2025-11-26T01:43:40Z

**Summary**: Deploying million-token Large Language Models (LLMs) is challenging because production workloads are highly heterogeneous, mixing short queries and long documents. This heterogeneity, combined with the quadratic complexity of attention, creates severe convoy effects where long-running requests stall short, interactive ones, degrading system responsiveness. We present Medha, a serving system that eliminates these convoys by introducing fine-grained, preemptive scheduling to LLM inference.   Medha makes preemption practical with a co-designed set of mechanisms -- including Adaptive Chunking and Stream Pipeline Parallel that overcome the perceived inefficiencies and scaling challenges of chunking. Additionally, we present a new parallelism strategy KV-Cache Parallelism to reduce the decode latency and afford interactivity despite very long context. These mechanisms are orchestrated by a Length-Aware Relative Slack (LARS) scheduler, a deadline and heterogeneity-aware scheduling policy that prevents both the convoy effect and the starvation that plagues simpler policies. Under a heterogeneous workload, Medha improves throughput by 5.7x while reducing median and 99th percentile latency by 30x and 174x, respectively, compared to state-of-the-art non-preemptive systems.

### Biembeddings of Archdeacon type: their full automorphism group and their number
**Authors**: Simone Costa

**Updated**: 2025-11-25T21:02:20Z

**Summary**: Archdeacon, in his seminal paper $[1]$, defined the concept of Heffter array in order to provide explicit constructions of $\mathbb{Z}_{v}$-regular biembeddings of complete graphs $K_v$ into orientable surfaces.   In this paper, we first introduce the quasi-Heffter arrays as a generalization of the concept of Heffer array and we show that, in this context, we can define a $2$-colorable embedding of Archdeacon type of the complete multipartite graph $K_{\frac{v}{t}\times t}$ into an orientable surface. Then, our main goal is to study the full automorphism groups of these embeddings: here we are able to prove, using a probabilistic approach, that, almost always, this group is exactly $\mathbb{Z}_{v}$.   As an application of this result, given a positive integer $t\not\equiv 0\pmod{4}$, we prove that there are, for infinitely many pairs of $v$ and $k$, at least $(1-o(1)) \frac{(\frac{v-t}{2})!}{φ(v)} $ non-isomorphic biembeddings of $K_{\frac{v}{t}\times t}$ whose face lengths are multiples of $k$. Here $φ(\cdot)$ denotes the Euler's totient function. Moreover, in case $t=1$ and $v$ is a prime, almost all these embeddings define faces that are all of the same length $kv$, i.e. we have a more than exponential number of non-isomorphic $kv$-gonal biembeddings of $K_{v}$.

### Length-MAX Tokenizer for Language Models
**Authors**: Dong Dong, Weijie Su

**Updated**: 2025-11-25T20:56:56Z

**Summary**: We introduce a new tokenizer for language models that minimizes the average tokens per character, thereby reducing the number of tokens needed to represent text during training and to generate text during inference. Our method, which we refer to as the Length-MAX tokenizer, obtains its vocabulary by casting a length-weighted objective maximization as a graph partitioning problem and developing a greedy approximation algorithm. On FineWeb and diverse domains, it yields 14--18\% fewer tokens than Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) across vocabulary sizes from 10K to 50K, and the reduction is 13.0\% when the size is 64K. Training GPT-2 models at 124M, 355M, and 1.3B parameters from scratch with five runs each shows 18.5\%, 17.2\%, and 18.5\% fewer steps, respectively, to reach a fixed validation loss, and 13.7\%, 12.7\%, and 13.7\% lower inference latency, together with a 16\% throughput gain at 124M, while consistently improving on downstream tasks including reducing LAMBADA perplexity by 11.7\% and enhancing HellaSwag accuracy by 4.3\%. Moreover, the Length-MAX tokenizer achieves 99.62\% vocabulary coverage and the out-of-vocabulary rate remains low at 0.12\% on test sets. These results demonstrate that optimizing for average token length, rather than frequency alone, offers an effective approach to more efficient language modeling without sacrificing -- and often improving -- downstream performance. The tokenizer is compatible with production systems and reduces embedding and KV-cache memory by 18\% at inference.

### Infinity-RoPE: Action-Controllable Infinite Video Generation Emerges From Autoregressive Self-Rollout
**Authors**: Hidir Yesiltepe, Tuna Han Salih Meral, Adil Kaan Akan, Kaan Oktay, Pinar Yanardag

**Updated**: 2025-11-25T18:59:46Z

**Summary**: Current autoregressive video diffusion models are constrained by three core bottlenecks: (i) the finite temporal horizon imposed by the base model's 3D Rotary Positional Embedding (3D-RoPE), (ii) slow prompt responsiveness in maintaining fine-grained action control during long-form rollouts, and (iii) the inability to realize discontinuous cinematic transitions within a single generation stream. We introduce $\infty$-RoPE, a unified inference-time framework that addresses all three limitations through three interconnected components: Block-Relativistic RoPE, KV Flush, and RoPE Cut. Block-Relativistic RoPE reformulates temporal encoding as a moving local reference frame, where each newly generated latent block is rotated relative to the base model's maximum frame horizon while earlier blocks are rotated backward to preserve relative temporal geometry. This relativistic formulation eliminates fixed temporal positions, enabling continuous video generation far beyond the base positional limits. To obtain fine-grained action control without re-encoding, KV Flush renews the KV cache by retaining only two latent frames, the global sink and the last generated latent frame, thereby ensuring immediate prompt responsiveness. Finally, RoPE Cut introduces controlled discontinuities in temporal RoPE coordinates, enabling multi-cut scene transitions within a single continuous rollout. Together, these components establish $\infty$-RoPE as a training-free foundation for infinite-horizon, controllable, and cinematic video diffusion. Comprehensive experiments show that $\infty$-RoPE consistently surpasses previous autoregressive models in overall VBench scores.

### Block Cascading: Training Free Acceleration of Block-Causal Video Models
**Authors**: Hmrishav Bandyopadhyay, Nikhil Pinnaparaju, Rahim Entezari, Jim Scott, Yi-Zhe Song, Varun Jampani

**Updated**: 2025-11-25T15:52:58Z

**Summary**: Block-causal video generation faces a stark speed-quality trade-off: small 1.3B models manage only 16 FPS while large 14B models crawl at 4.5 FPS, forcing users to choose between responsiveness and quality. Block Cascading significantly mitigates this trade-off through training-free parallelization. Our key insight: future video blocks do not need fully denoised current blocks to begin generation. By starting block generation with partially denoised context from predecessors, we transform sequential pipelines into parallel cascades where multiple blocks denoise simultaneously. With 5 GPUs exploiting temporal parallelism, we achieve ~2x acceleration across all model scales: 1.3B models accelerate from 16 to 30 FPS, 14B models from 4.5 to 12.5 FPS. Beyond inference speed, Block Cascading eliminates overhead from KV-recaching (of ~200ms) during context switches for interactive generation. Extensive evaluations validated against multiple block-causal pipelines demonstrate no significant loss in generation quality when switching from block-causal to Block Cascading pipelines for inference.

### Pickle Prefetcher: Programmable and Scalable Last-Level Cache Prefetcher
**Authors**: Hoa Nguyen, Pongstorn Maidee, Jason Lowe-Power, Alireza Kaviani

**Updated**: 2025-11-25T06:36:32Z

**Summary**: Modern high-performance architectures employ large last-level caches (LLCs). While large LLCs can reduce average memory access latency for workloads with a high degree of locality, they can also increase latency for workloads with irregular memory access patterns. Prefetchers are widely used to reduce memory latency by prefetching data into the cache hierarchy before it is accessed by the core. However, existing prediction-based prefetchers often struggle with irregular memory access patterns, which are especially prevalent in modern applications. This paper introduces the Pickle Prefetcher, a programmable and scalable LLC prefetcher designed to handle independent irregular memory access patterns effectively. Instead of relying on static heuristics or complex prediction algorithms, Pickle Prefetcher allows software to define its own prefetching strategies using a simple programming interface without expanding the instruction set architecture (ISA). By trading the logic complexity of hardware prediction for software programmability, Pickle Prefetcher can adapt to a wide range of access patterns without requiring extensive hardware resources for prediction. This allows the prefetcher to dedicate its resources to scheduling and issuing timely prefetch requests. Graph applications are an example where the memory access pattern is irregular but easily predictable by software. Through extensive evaluations of the Pickle Prefetcher on gem5 full-system simulations, we demonstrate tha Pickle Prefetcher significantly outperforms traditional prefetching techniques. Our results show that Pickle Prefetcher achieves speedups of up to 1.74x on the GAPBS breadth-first search (BFS) implementation over a baseline system. When combined with private cache prefetchers, Pickle Prefetcher provides up to a 1.40x speedup over systems using only private cache prefetchers.

### ProactivePIM: Accelerating Weight-Sharing Embedding Layer with PIM for Scalable Recommendation System
**Authors**: Youngsuk Kim, Junghwan Lim, Hyuk-Jae Lee, Chae Eun Rhee

**Updated**: 2025-11-25T05:43:27Z

**Summary**: Although deep learning-based personalized recommendation systems provide qualified recommendations, they strain data center resources. The main bottleneck is the embedding layer, which is highly memory-intensive due to its sparse, irregular access patterns to embeddings. Recent near-memory processing (NMP) and processing-in-memory (PIM) architectures have addressed these issues by exploiting parallelism within memory. However, as model sizes increase year by year and can exceed server capacity, inference on single-node servers becomes challenging, necessitating the integration of model compression. Various algorithms have been proposed for model size reduction, but they come at the cost of increased memory access and CPU-PIM communication. We present ProactivePIM, a PIM system tailored for weight-sharing algorithms, a family of compression methods that decompose an embedding table into compact subtables, such as QR-trick and TT-Rec. Our analysis shows that embedding layer execution with weight-sharing algorithms increases memory access and incurs CPU-PIM communication. We also find that these algorithms exhibit unique data locality characteristics, which we name intra-GnR locality. ProactivePIM accelerates weight-sharing algorithms by utilizing a heterogeneous HBM-DIMM memory architecture with integration of a two-level PIM system of base-die PIM (bd-PIM) and bank-group PIM (bg-PIM) inside the HBM. To gain further speedup, ProactivePIM prefetches embeddings with high intra-GnR locality into an SRAM cache within bg-PIM and eliminates the CPU-PIM communication through duplication of target subtables across bank groups. With additional optimization techniques, our design effectively accelerates weight-sharing algorithms, achieving 2.22x and 2.15x speedup in QR-trick and TT-Rec, respectively, compared to the baseline architecture.

**Updated**: 2025-11-25T04:36:10Z

**Summary**: The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has driven the need for increasingly sophisticated inference pipelines and hardware platforms. Modern LLM serving extends beyond traditional prefill-decode workflows, incorporating multi-stage processes such as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), key-value (KV) cache retrieval, dynamic model routing, and multi step reasoning. These stages exhibit diverse computational demands, requiring distributed systems that integrate GPUs, ASICs, CPUs, and memory-centric architectures. However, existing simulators lack the fidelity to model these heterogeneous, multi-engine workflows, limiting their ability to inform architectural decisions.   To address this gap, we introduce HERMES, a Heterogeneous Multi-stage LLM inference Execution Simulator. HERMES models diverse request stages; including RAG, KV retrieval, reasoning, prefill, and decode across complex hardware hierarchies. HERMES supports heterogeneous clients executing multiple models concurrently unlike prior frameworks while incorporating advanced batching strategies and multi-level memory hierarchies. By integrating real hardware traces with analytical modeling, HERMES captures critical trade-offs such as memory bandwidth contention, inter-cluster communication latency, and batching efficiency in hybrid CPU-accelerator deployments. Through case studies, we explore the impact of reasoning stages on end-to-end latency, optimal batching strategies for hybrid pipelines, and the architectural implications of remote KV cache retrieval. HERMES empowers system designers to navigate the evolving landscape of LLM inference, providing actionable insights into optimizing hardware-software co-design for next-generation AI workloads.

### On 10x Better Scalability: KV Stores Scale Up KV Cache
**Authors**: Weiping Yu, Ye Jiarui, He Mengke, Junfeng Liu, Siqiang Luo

**Updated**: 2025-11-25T02:03:54Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) rely on Key-Value (KV) cache to reduce time-to-first-token (TTFT) latency, but existing disk-based KV cache systems using file-per-object layouts suffer from severe scalability bottlenecks due to file system metadata overhead, I/O inefficiency, and poor spatial locality. This paper presents SGLANG-LSM, a database-inspired system that leverages Log-Structured Merge-tree (LSM-tree) architectures for scalable KV cache management. SGLANG-LSM implements a layered system design with three coordinated components: (1) a prefix-preserving storage engine that maintains token sequence locality while efficiently storing large KV cache tensors through key-value separation, (2) an adaptive controller that dynamically optimizes LSM-tree configurations based on shifting workload characteristics, and (3) runtime services including batch operations and automatic resource management for production deployment. Evaluation on large-scale dynamic workloads demonstrates that SGLANG-LSM significantly improves cache hits by up to 143% and reduces TTFT by up to 24% compared to state-of-the-art systems, representing the first systematic application of database storage architectures to large-scale LLM cache management.

**Updated**: 2025-11-25T01:45:04Z

**Summary**: World models serve as core simulators for fields such as agentic AI, embodied AI, and gaming, capable of generating long, physically realistic, and interactive high-quality videos. Moreover, scaling these models could unlock emergent capabilities in visual perception, understanding, and reasoning, paving the way for a new paradigm that moves beyond current LLM-centric vision foundation models. A key breakthrough empowering them is the semi-autoregressive (block-diffusion) decoding paradigm, which merges the strengths of diffusion and autoregressive methods by generating video tokens in block-applying diffusion within each block while conditioning on previous ones, resulting in more coherent and stable video sequences. Crucially, it overcomes limitations of standard video diffusion by reintroducing LLM-style KV Cache management, enabling efficient, variable-length, and high-quality generation.   Therefore, Inferix is specifically designed as a next-generation inference engine to enable immersive world synthesis through optimized semi-autoregressive decoding processes. This dedicated focus on world simulation distinctly sets it apart from systems engineered for high-concurrency scenarios (like vLLM or SGLang) and from classic video diffusion models (such as xDiTs). Inferix further enhances its offering with interactive video streaming and profiling, enabling real-time interaction and realistic simulation to accurately model world dynamics. Additionally, it supports efficient benchmarking through seamless integration of LV-Bench, a new fine-grained evaluation benchmark tailored for minute-long video generation scenarios. We hope the community will work together to advance Inferix and foster world model exploration.

### Computer-aided Characterization of Fundamental Limits of Coded Caching with Linear Coding
**Authors**: Niccolò Brembilla, Yinbin Ma, Pietro Belotti, Federico Malucelli, Daniela Tuninetti

**Updated**: 2025-11-24T19:14:34Z

**Summary**: Inspired by prior work by Tian and by Cao and Xu, this paper presents an efficient computer-aided framework to characterize the fundamental limits of coded caching systems under the constraint of linear coding. The proposed framework considers non-Shannon-type inequalities which are valid for representable polymatroids (and hence for linear codes), and leverages symmetric structure and problem-specific constraints of coded caching to reduce the complexity of the linear program. The derived converse bounds are tighter compared to previous known analytic methods, and prove the optimality of some achievable memory-load tradeoff points under the constraint of linear coding placement and delivery. These results seem to indicate that small, structured demand subsets combined with minimal common information constructions may be sufficient to characterize optimal tradeoffs under linear coding.

**Authors**: Minseo Kim, Chenfeng Xu, Coleman Hooper, Harman Singh, Ben Athiwaratkun, Ce Zhang, Kurt Keutzer, Amir Gholami

**Updated**: 2025-11-24T16:21:25Z

**Summary**: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) offer a promising parallel generation paradigm but suffer from slow inference due to numerous refinement steps and the inability to use standard KV caching. We introduce CDLM (Consistency Diffusion Language Models), a training-based acceleration method that simultaneously tackles both bottlenecks. CDLM integrates consistency modeling to drastically reduce the number of required sampling steps by enabling multi-token finalization. Furthermore, we enforce a block-wise causal attention mask during fine-tuning, making the model fully compatible with KV caching. Experiments show CDLM achieves 3.6x-14.5x lower latency while maintaining competitive accuracy on math and coding tasks. The full training and evaluation code is available at https://github.com/SqueezeAILab/CDLM.

### Orchestrating Dual-Boundaries: An Arithmetic Intensity Inspired Acceleration Framework for Diffusion Language Models
**Authors**: Linye Wei, Wenjue Chen, Pingzhi Tang, Xiaotian Guo, Le Ye, Runsheng Wang, Meng Li

**Updated**: 2025-11-24T13:36:54Z

**Summary**: Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) have recently gained significant attention for their exceptional performance and inherent potential for parallel decoding. Existing frameworks further enhance its inference efficiency by enabling KV caching. However, its bidirectional attention mechanism necessitates periodic cache refreshes that interleave prefill and decoding phases, both contributing substantial inference cost and constraining achievable speedup. Inspired by the heterogeneous arithmetic intensity of the prefill and decoding phases, we propose ODB-dLLM, a framework that orchestrates dual-boundaries to accelerate dLLM inference. In the prefill phase, we find that the predefined fixed response length introduces heavy yet redundant computational overhead, which affects efficiency. To alleviate this, ODB-dLLM incorporates an adaptive length prediction mechanism that progressively reduces prefill overhead and unnecessary computation. In the decoding phase, we analyze the computational characteristics of dLLMs and propose a dLLM-specific jump-share speculative decoding method to enhance efficiency by reducing the number of decoding iterations. Experimental results demonstrate that ODB-dLLM achieves 46-162x and 2.63-6.30x speedups over the baseline dLLM and Fast-dLLM, respectively, while simultaneously mitigating the accuracy degradation in existing acceleration frameworks.

### SWAN: Sparse Winnowed Attention for Reduced Inference Memory via Decompression-Free KV-Cache Compression
**Authors**: Santhosh G S, Saurav Prakash, Balaraman Ravindran

**Updated**: 2025-11-24T09:41:24Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) face a significant bottleneck during autoregressive inference due to the massive memory footprint of the Key-Value (KV) cache. Existing compression techniques like token eviction, quantization, or other low-rank methods often risk information loss, have fixed limits, or introduce significant computational overhead from explicit decompression steps. In this work, we introduce SWAN, a novel, fine-tuning-free framework that eliminates this overhead. Our method uses an offline orthogonal matrix to rotate and prune the KV-cache, which is then used directly in the attention computation without any reconstruction. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that SWAN, augmented with a small dense buffer, offers a robust trade-off, maintaining performance close to the uncompressed baseline even at aggressive 50-60% memory savings per-token on KV-cache. A key advantage is its runtime-tunable compression level, allowing operators to dynamically adjust the memory footprint, a flexibility absent in methods requiring fixed offline configurations. This combination of a decompression-free design, high performance under compression, and adaptability makes SWAN a practical and efficient solution for serving LLMs with long contexts.

### SlimCaching: Edge Caching of Mixture-of-Experts for Distributed Inference
**Authors**: Qian Chen, Xianhao Chen, Kaibin Huang

**Updated**: 2025-11-24T09:35:35Z

**Summary**: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models improve the scalability of large language models (LLMs) by activating only a small subset of relevant experts per input. However, the sheer number of expert networks in an MoE model introduces a significant storage burden for an edge device. To address this challenge, we consider a scenario where experts are dispersed across an edge network for distributed inference. Based on the popular Top-$K$ expert selection strategy, we formulate a latency minimization problem by optimizing expert caching on edge servers under storage constraints. When $K=1$, the problem reduces to a monotone submodular maximization problem with knapsack constraints, for which we design a greedy-based algorithm with a $(1 - 1/e)$-approximation guarantee. For the general case where $K \geq 1$, expert co-activation within the same MoE layer introduces non-submodularity, which renders greedy methods ineffective. To tackle this issue, we propose a successive greedy decomposition method to decompose the original problem into a series of subproblems, with each being solved by a dynamic programming approach. Furthermore, we design an accelerated algorithm based on the max-convolution technique to obtain the approximate solution with a provable guarantee in polynomial time. Simulation results on various MoE models demonstrate that our method significantly reduces inference latency compared to existing baselines.

### MagicWorld: Interactive Geometry-driven Video World Exploration
**Authors**: Guangyuan Li, Siming Zheng, Shuolin Xu, Jinwei Chen, Bo Li, Xiaobin Hu, Lei Zhao, Peng-Tao Jiang

**Updated**: 2025-11-24T08:41:28Z

**Summary**: Recent interactive video world model methods generate scene evolution conditioned on user instructions. Although they achieve impressive results, two key limitations remain. First, they fail to fully exploit the correspondence between instruction-driven scene motion and the underlying 3D geometry, which results in structural instability under viewpoint changes. Second, they easily forget historical information during multi-step interaction, resulting in error accumulation and progressive drift in scene semantics and structure. To address these issues, we propose MagicWorld, an interactive video world model that integrates 3D geometric priors and historical retrieval. MagicWorld starts from a single scene image, employs user actions to drive dynamic scene evolution, and autoregressively synthesizes continuous scenes. We introduce the Action-Guided 3D Geometry Module (AG3D), which constructs a point cloud from the first frame of each interaction and the corresponding action, providing explicit geometric constraints for viewpoint transitions and thereby improving structural consistency. We further propose History Cache Retrieval (HCR) mechanism, which retrieves relevant historical frames during generation and injects them as conditioning signals, helping the model utilize past scene information and mitigate error accumulation. Experimental results demonstrate that MagicWorld achieves notable improvements in scene stability and continuity across interaction iterations.

### Mitigating Long-Tail Bias in HOI Detection via Adaptive Diversity Cache
**Authors**: Yuqiu Jiang, Xiaozhen Qiao, Tianyu Mei, Haojian Huang, Yifan Chen, Ye Zheng, Zhe Sun

**Updated**: 2025-11-24T06:30:08Z

**Summary**: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection is a fundamental task in computer vision, empowering machines to comprehend human-object relationships in diverse real-world scenarios. Recent advances in VLMs have significantly improved HOI detection by leveraging rich cross-modal representations. However, most existing VLM-based approaches rely heavily on additional training or prompt tuning, resulting in substantial computational overhead and limited scalability, particularly in long-tailed scenarios where rare interactions are severely underrepresented. In this paper, we propose the Adaptive Diversity Cache (ADC) module, a novel training-free and plug-and-play mechanism designed to mitigate long-tail bias in HOI detection. ADC constructs class-specific caches that accumulate high-confidence and diverse feature representations during inference. The method incorporates frequency-aware cache adaptation that favors rare categories and is designed to enable robust prediction calibration without requiring additional training or fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on HICO-DET and V-COCO datasets show that ADC consistently improves existing HOI detectors, achieving up to +8.57\% mAP gain on rare categories and +4.39\% on the full dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in mitigating long-tail bias while preserving overall performance.

### SlimInfer: Accelerating Long-Context LLM Inference via Dynamic Token Pruning
**Authors**: Lingkun Long, Rubing Yang, Yushi Huang, Desheng Hui, Ao Zhou, Jianlei Yang

**Updated**: 2025-11-24T06:26:25Z

**Summary**: Long-context inference for Large Language Models (LLMs) is heavily limited by high computational demands. While several existing methods optimize attention computation, they still process the full set of hidden states at each layer, limiting overall efficiency. In this work, we propose SlimInfer, an innovative framework that aims to accelerate inference by directly pruning less critical prompt tokens during the forward pass. Our key insight is an information diffusion phenomenon: As information from critical tokens propagates through layers, it becomes distributed across the entire sequence. This diffusion process suggests that LLMs can maintain their semantic integrity when excessive tokens, even including these critical ones, are pruned in hidden states. Motivated by this, SlimInfer introduces a dynamic fine-grained pruning mechanism that accurately removes redundant tokens of hidden state at intermediate layers. This layer-wise pruning naturally enables an asynchronous KV cache manager that prefetches required token blocks without complex predictors, reducing both memory usage and I/O costs. Extensive experiments show that SlimInfer can achieve up to $\mathbf{2.53\times}$ time-to-first-token (TTFT) speedup and $\mathbf{1.88\times}$ end-to-end latency reduction for LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct on a single RTX 4090, without sacrificing performance on LongBench. Our code is available at https://github.com/Longxmas/SlimInfer.

### GVD-TG: Topological Graph based on Fast Hierarchical GVD Sampling for Robot Exploration
**Authors**: Yanbin Li, Canran Xiao, Shenghai Yuan, Peilai Yu, Ziruo Li, Zhiguo Zhang, Wenzheng Chi, Wei Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-11-24T03:02:39Z

**Summary**: Topological maps are more suitable than metric maps for robotic exploration tasks. However, real-time updating of accurate and detail-rich environmental topological maps remains a challenge. This paper presents a topological map updating method based on the Generalized Voronoi Diagram (GVD). First, the newly observed areas are denoised to avoid low-efficiency GVD nodes misleading the topological structure. Subsequently, a multi-granularity hierarchical GVD generation method is designed to control the sampling granularity at both global and local levels. This not only ensures the accuracy of the topological structure but also enhances the ability to capture detail features, reduces the probability of path backtracking, and ensures no overlap between GVDs through the maintenance of a coverage map, thereby improving GVD utilization efficiency. Second, a node clustering method with connectivity constraints and a connectivity method based on a switching mechanism are designed to avoid the generation of unreachable nodes and erroneous nodes caused by obstacle attraction. A special cache structure is used to store all connectivity information, thereby improving exploration efficiency. Finally, to address the issue of frontiers misjudgment caused by obstacles within the scope of GVD units, a frontiers extraction method based on morphological dilation is designed to effectively ensure the reachability of frontiers. On this basis, a lightweight cost function is used to assess and switch to the next viewpoint in real time. This allows the robot to quickly adjust its strategy when signs of path backtracking appear, thereby escaping the predicament and increasing exploration flexibility. And the performance of system for exploration task is verified through comparative tests with SOTA methods.

### Kitty: Accurate and Efficient 2-bit KV Cache Quantization with Dynamic Channel-wise Precision Boost

**Updated**: 2025-11-23T22:54:48Z

**Summary**: The KV cache is a dominant memory bottleneck for LLM inference. While 4-bit KV quantization preserves accuracy, 2-bit often degrades it, especially on long-context reasoning. We close this gap via an algorithm-system co-design for mixed-precision KV caching: Kitty. On the algorithm side, extensive experiments show that Dynamic Channel-wise Precision Boost -- which ranks Key-cache channels by sensitivity and keeps only a small fraction at higher precision -- maintains near-zero loss in accuracy drop while approaching 2-bit memory. The main challenge is handling dynamic 4-bit channel boosts while keeping the page layout coalesced and the dequantization uniform, with no scattered reads or hard-coded masks. Kitty addresses these issues by decompose each mixed-precision Key page into two tensors with unified 2-bit precision. Based on this, Kitty provides a page-centric KV layout, Triton-compatible page dequantization kernels, and a lightweight runtime pipeline that preserves coalescing and avoids divergence. Across seven tasks and two model families (Qwen3, LLaMA3), Kitty cuts KV memory by nearly 8x with negligible accuracy loss, enabling up to 8x larger batches and 2.1x-4.1x higher throughput under the same memory budget. We release the full implementation of Kitty at https://github.com/Summer-Summer/Kitty.

**Summary**: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models offer a unified framework for robotic perception and control, but their ability to scale to real-world, long-horizon tasks is limited by the high computational cost of attention and the large memory required for storing key-value (KV) pairs during inference, particularly when retaining historical image tokens as context. Recent methods have focused on scaling backbone architectures to improve generalization, with less emphasis on addressing inference inefficiencies essential for real-time use. In this work, we present KV-Efficient VLA, a model-agnostic memory compression approach designed to address these limitations by introducing a lightweight mechanism to selectively retain high-utility context. Our method partitions the KV cache into fixed-size chunks and employs a recurrent gating module to summarize and filter the historical context according to learned utility scores. This design aims to preserve recent fine-grained detail while aggressively pruning stale, low-relevance memory. Based on experiments, our approach can yield an average of 24.6% FLOPs savings, 1.34x inference speedup, and 1.87x reduction in KV memory. Our method integrates seamlessly into recent VLA stacks, enabling scalable inference without modifying downstream control logic.

### CrossJEPA: Cross-Modal Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture for Efficient 3D Representation Learning from 2D Images
**Authors**: Avishka Perera, Kumal Hewagamage, Saeedha Nazar, Kavishka Abeywardana, Hasitha Gallella, Ranga Rodrigo, Mohamed Afham

**Updated**: 2025-11-23T12:40:04Z

**Summary**: Image-to-point cross-modal learning has emerged to address the scarcity of large-scale 3D datasets in 3D representation learning. However, current methods that leverage 2D data often result in large, slow-to-train models, making them computationally expensive and difficult to deploy in resource-constrained environments. The architecture design of such models is therefore critical, determining their performance, memory footprint, and compute efficiency. The Joint-embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) has gained wide popularity in self-supervised learning for its simplicity and efficiency, but has been under-explored in cross-modal settings, partly due to the misconception that masking is intrinsic to JEPA. In this light, we propose CrossJEPA, a simple Cross-modal Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture that harnesses the knowledge of an image foundation model and trains a predictor to infer embeddings of specific rendered 2D views from corresponding 3D point clouds, thereby introducing a JEPA-style pretraining strategy beyond masking. By conditioning the predictor on cross-domain projection information, CrossJEPA purifies the supervision signal from semantics exclusive to the target domain. We further exploit the frozen teacher design with a one-time target embedding caching mechanism, yielding amortized efficiency. CrossJEPA achieves a new state-of-the-art in linear probing on the synthetic ModelNet40 (94.2%) and the real-world ScanObjectNN (88.3%) benchmarks, using only 14.1M pretraining parameters (8.5M in the point encoder), and about 6 pretraining hours on a standard single GPU. These results position CrossJEPA as a performant, memory-efficient, and fast-to-train framework for 3D representation learning via knowledge distillation. We analyze CrossJEPA intuitively, theoretically, and empirically, and extensively ablate our design choices. Code will be made available.

### MASS: Motion-Aware Spatial-Temporal Grounding for Physics Reasoning and Comprehension in Vision-Language Models
**Authors**: Xiyang Wu, Zongxia Li, Jihui Jin, Guangyao Shi, Gouthaman KV, Vishnu Raj, Nilotpal Sinha, Jingxi Chen, Fan Du, Dinesh Manocha

**Updated**: 2025-11-23T09:43:44Z

**Summary**: Vision Language Models (VLMs) perform well on standard video tasks but struggle with physics-driven reasoning involving motion dynamics and spatial interactions. This limitation reduces their ability to interpret real or AI-generated content (AIGC) videos and to generate physically consistent content. We present an approach that addresses this gap by translating physical-world context cues into interpretable representations aligned with VLMs' perception, comprehension, and reasoning. We introduce MASS-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark consisting of 4,350 real-world and AIGC videos and 8,361 free-form video question-answering pairs focused on physics-related comprehension tasks, with detailed annotations including visual detections, sub-segment grounding, and full-sequence 3D motion tracking of entities. We further present MASS, a model-agnostic method that injects spatial-temporal signals into the VLM language space via depth-based 3D encoding and visual grounding, coupled with a motion tracker for object dynamics. To strengthen cross-modal alignment and reasoning, we apply reinforcement fine-tuning. Experiments and ablations show that our refined VLMs outperform comparable and larger baselines, as well as prior state-of-the-art models, by 8.7% and 6.0%, achieving performance comparable to close-source SoTA VLMs such as Gemini-2.5-Flash on physics reasoning and comprehension. These results validate the effectiveness of our approach.

### Breaking the Bottleneck with DiffuApriel: High-Throughput Diffusion LMs with Mamba Backbone
**Authors**: Vaibhav Singh, Oleksiy Ostapenko, Pierre-André Noël, Torsten Scholak

**Updated**: 2025-11-23T05:32:34Z

**Summary**: Diffusion-based language models have recently emerged as a promising alternative to autoregressive generation, yet their reliance on Transformer backbones limits inference efficiency due to quadratic attention and KV-cache overhead. In this work, we introduce DiffuApriel, a masked diffusion language model built on a bidirectional Mamba backbone that combines the diffusion objective with linear-time sequence modeling. DiffuApriel matches the performance of Transformer-based diffusion models while achieving up to 4.4x higher inference throughput for long sequences with a 1.3B model. We further propose DiffuApriel-H, a hybrid variant that interleaves attention and mamba layers, offering up to 2.6x throughput improvement with balanced global and local context modeling. Our results demonstrate that bidirectional state-space architectures serve as strong denoisers in masked diffusion LMs, providing a practical and scalable foundation for faster, memory-efficient text generation.

### MIDAS: Adaptive Proxy Middleware for Mitigating Metadata Hotspots in HPC I/O at Scale
**Authors**: Sangam Ghimire, Nigam Niraula, Nirjal Bhurtel, Paribartan Timalsina, Bishal Neupane, James Bhattarai, Sudan Jha

**Updated**: 2025-11-22T17:05:38Z

**Summary**: Metadata hotspots remain one of the key obstacles to scalable Input/Output (I/O) in both High-Performance Computing (HPC) and cloud-scale storage environments. Situations such as job start-ups, checkpoint storms, or heavily skewed namespace access can trigger thousands of concurrent metadata requests against a small subset of servers. The result is long queues, inflated tail latencies, and reduced system throughput. Prior efforts including static namespace partitioning, backend-specific extensions, and kernel-level modifications address parts of the problem, but they often prove too rigid, intrusive to deploy, or unstable under shifting workloads. We present MIDAS, an adaptive middleware layer that operates transparently between clients and metadata servers, requiring no changes to kernels or storage backends. The design brings together three mechanisms: (i) a namespace-aware load balancer that enhances consistent hashing with power-of-d sampling informed by live telemetry, (ii) a cooperative caching layer that preserves backend semantics through leases, invalidations, or adaptive timeouts, and (iii) a self-stabilizing control loop that dynamically adjusts routing aggressiveness and cache lifetimes while avoiding oscillations under bursty workloads. Analysis of the model and controlled experiments show that MIDAS reduces average queue lengths by roughly 23% and mitigates worst-case hotspots by up to 80% when compared to round-robin scheduling. These findings highlight that a stability-aware, middleware-based strategy can provide backend-agnostic improvements to metadata management, enabling better scalability in bursty scenarios, more predictable tail latencies, and stronger overall system performance.

### SpecDiff: Accelerating Diffusion Model Inference with Self-Speculation
**Authors**: Jiayi Pan, Jiaming Xu, Yongkang Zhou, Guohao Dai

**Updated**: 2025-11-22T06:28:24Z

**Summary**: Feature caching has recently emerged as a promising method for diffusion model acceleration. It effectively alleviates the inefficiency problem caused by high computational requirements by caching similar features in the inference process of the diffusion model. In this paper, we analyze existing feature caching methods from the perspective of information utilization, and point out that relying solely on historical information will lead to constrained accuracy and speed performance. And we propose a novel paradigm that introduces future information via self-speculation based on the information similarity at the same time step across different iteration times. Based on this paradigm, we present \textit{SpecDiff}, a training-free multi-level feature caching strategy including a cached feature selection algorithm and a multi-level feature classification algorithm. (1) Feature selection algorithm based on self-speculative information. \textit{SpecDiff} determines a dynamic importance score for each token based on self-speculative information and historical information, and performs cached feature selection through the importance score. (2) Multi-level feature classification algorithm based on feature importance scores. \textit{SpecDiff} classifies tokens by leveraging the differences in feature importance scores and introduces a multi-level feature calculation strategy. Extensive experiments show that \textit{SpecDiff} achieves average 2.80 \times, 2.74 \times , and 3.17\times speedup with negligible quality loss in Stable Diffusion 3, 3.5, and FLUX compared to RFlow on NVIDIA A800-80GB GPU. By merging speculative and historical information, \textit{SpecDiff} overcomes the speedup-accuracy trade-off bottleneck, pushing the Pareto frontier of speedup and accuracy in the efficient diffusion model inference.

 ### Trajectory Balance with Asynchrony: Decoupling Exploration and Learning for Fast, Scalable LLM Post-Training
**Authors**: Brian Bartoldson, Siddarth Venkatraman, James Diffenderfer, Moksh Jain, Tal Ben-Nun, Seanie Lee, Minsu Kim, Johan Obando-Ceron, Yoshua Bengio, Bhavya Kailkhura

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T18:56:50Z

**Summary**: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a critical component of large language model (LLM) post-training. However, on-policy algorithms used for post-training are not naturally robust to a diversified content of experience replay buffers, which asynchronous off-policy actors can efficiently populate in parallel to training. We propose efficiently learning on such off-policy data via Trajectory Balance with Asynchrony (TBA), an approach to asynchronous RL for LLMs that leverages the principled off-policy TB objective. On math, preference-tuning, and automated red-teaming tasks, we post-train models ranging from Pythia 410M to Qwen 2.5 7B, finding TBA offers speed and performance boosts over strong baselines like Online DPO and Dr. GRPO. Beyond TBA's performance benefits (high accuracy even as asynchrony grows) and speedups ($4\times$ or more), we show its reward- and recency-prioritizing sampling enable further gains as data generation is scaled. Our code is available at https://github.com/bbartoldson/TBA.

### On distance and velocity estimation in cosmology
**Authors**: Adi Nusser

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T18:56:08Z

**Summary**: Scatter in distance indicators introduces two conceptually distinct systematic biases when reconstructing peculiar velocity fields from redshifts and distances. The first is distance Malmquist bias (dMB) that affects individual distance estimates and can in principle be approximately corrected. The second is velocity Malmquist bias (vMB) that arises when constructing continuous velocity fields from scattered distance measurements: random scatter places galaxies at noisy spatial positions, introducing spurious velocity gradients that persist even when distances are corrected for dMB. Considering the Tully-Fisher relation as a concrete example, both inverse and forward formulations yield unbiased individual peculiar velocities for galaxies with the same true distance (the forward relation requires a selection-dependent correction), but neither eliminates vMB when galaxies are placed at their inferred distances. We develop a modified Wiener filter that properly encodes correlations between directly observed distance $d$ and true distance $r$ through the conditional probability $P(r|d)$, accounting for the distribution of true distances sampled by galaxies at observed distance $d$. Nonetheless, this modified filter yields suppressed amplitude estimates. Since machine learning autoencoders converge to the Wiener filter for Gaussian fields, they are unlikely to significantly improve velocity field estimation. We therefore argue that optimal reconstruction places galaxies at their observed redshifts rather than inferred distances; an approach effective when distance errors exceed $σ_v/H_0$, a condition satisfied for most galaxies in typical surveys beyond the nearby volume.

### Eval Factsheets: A Structured Framework for Documenting AI Evaluations
**Authors**: Florian Bordes, Candace Ross, Justine T Kao, Evangelia Spiliopoulou, Adina Williams

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T18:46:50Z

**Summary**: The rapid proliferation of benchmarks has created significant challenges in reproducibility, transparency, and informed decision-making. However, unlike datasets and models -- which benefit from structured documentation frameworks like Datasheets and Model Cards -- evaluation methodologies lack systematic documentation standards. We introduce Eval Factsheets, a structured, descriptive framework for documenting AI system evaluations through a comprehensive taxonomy and questionnaire-based approach. Our framework organizes evaluation characteristics across five fundamental dimensions: Context (Who made the evaluation and when?), Scope (What does it evaluate?), Structure (With what the evaluation is built?), Method (How does it work?) and Alignment (In what ways is it reliable/valid/robust?). We implement this taxonomy as a practical questionnaire spanning five sections with mandatory and recommended documentation elements. Through case studies on multiple benchmarks, we demonstrate that Eval Factsheets effectively captures diverse evaluation paradigms -- from traditional benchmarks to LLM-as-judge methodologies -- while maintaining consistency and comparability. We hope Eval Factsheets are incorporated into both existing and newly released evaluation frameworks and lead to more transparency and reproducibility.

### Inference for location and height of peaks of a standardized field after selection
**Authors**: Alden Green, Jonathan Taylor

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T18:44:45Z

**Summary**: Peak inference concerns the use of local maxima ("peaks") of a noisy random field to detect and localize regions where underlying signal is present. We propose a peak inference method that first subjects observed peaks to a significance test of the null hypothesis that no signal is present, and then uses the peaks that are declared significant to construct post-selectively valid confidence regions for the location and height of nearby true peaks. We analyze the performance of this method in a smooth signal plus constant variance noise model under a high-curvature asymptotic assumption, and prove that it asymptotically controls both the number of false discoveries, and the number of confidence regions that do not contain a true peak, relative to the number of points at which inference is conducted. An important intermediate theoretical result uses the Kac-Rice formula to derive a novel approximation to the intensity function of a point process that counts local maxima, which is second-order accurate under the alternative, nearby high-curvature true peaks.

### Machine Learning Pipeline for Denoising Low Signal-To-Noise Ratio and Out-of-Distribution Transmission Electron Microscopy Datasets
**Authors**: Brian Lee, Meng Li, Judith C Yang, Dmitri N Zakharov, Xiaohui Qu

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T18:32:32Z

**Summary**: High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) is crucial for observing material's structural and morphological evolution at Angstrom scales, but the electron beam can alter these processes. Devices such as CMOS-based direct-electron detectors operating in electron-counting mode can be utilized to substantially reduce the electron dosage. However, the resulting images often lead to low signal-to-noise ratio, which requires frame integration that sacrifices temporal resolution. Several machine learning (ML) models have been recently developed to successfully denoise HRTEM images. Yet, these models are often computationally expensive and their inference speeds on GPUs are outpaced by the imaging speed of advanced detectors, precluding in situ analysis. Furthermore, the performance of these denoising models on datasets with imaging conditions that deviate from the training datasets have not been evaluated. To mitigate these gaps, we propose a new self-supervised ML denoising pipeline specifically designed for time-series HRTEM images. This pipeline integrates a blind-spot convolution neural network with pre-processing and post-processing steps including drift correction and low-pass filtering. Results demonstrate that our model outperforms various other ML and non-ML denoising methods in noise reduction and contrast enhancement, leading to improved visual clarity of atomic features. Additionally, the model is drastically faster than U-Net-based ML models and demonstrates excellent out-of-distribution generalization. The model's computational inference speed is in the order of milliseconds per image, rendering it suitable for application in in-situ HRTEM experiments.

### MarkTune: Improving the Quality-Detectability Trade-off in Open-Weight LLM Watermarking
**Authors**: Yizhou Zhao, Zhiwei Steven Wu, Adam Block

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T18:32:19Z

**Summary**: Watermarking aims to embed hidden signals in generated text that can be reliably detected when given access to a secret key. Open-weight language models pose acute challenges for such watermarking schemes because the inference-time interventions that dominate contemporary approaches cannot be enforced once model weights are public. Existing watermaking techniques for open-weight models, such as the recently proposed GaussMark, typically rely on small modifications to model weights, which can yield signals detectable to those equipped with a secret key, but achieving detection power comparable to inference-time watermarks generally requires weight perturbations that noticeably reduce generation quality. We introduce MarkTune, a theoretically principled, on-policy fine-tuning framework that treats the GaussMark signal as a reward while simultaneously regularizing against degradation in text quality. We derive MarkTune as an improvement on GaussMark and demonstrate that MarkTune consistently improves the quality-detectability trade-off over GaussMark by steering finer-grained, watermark-aware weight updates within the model's representation space while preserving generation quality. Empirically, we show that MarkTune pushes the quality-detectability frontier of GaussMark close to that of inference-time watermarking, remains robust to paraphrasing and fine-tuning attacks, and exhibits strong generalization: a model fine-tuned on one dataset retains substantial watermark detection power on unseen datasets. Together, these results establish MarkTune as a general strategy for embedding robust, high-quality watermarks into open-weight LMs.

### Large Language Models for Limited Noisy Data: A Gravitational Wave Identification Study
**Authors**: Yixuan Li, Yuhao Lu, Yang Liu, Liang Li, R. Ruffini, Di Li, Rong-Gen Cai, Xiaoyan Zhu, Wenbin Lin, Yu Wang

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T18:13:01Z

**Summary**: This work investigates whether large language models (LLMs) offer advantages over traditional neural networks for astronomical data processing, in regimes with non-Gaussian, non-stationary noise and limited labeled samples. Gravitational wave observations provide an suitable test case, using only 90 LIGO events, finetuned LLMs achieve 97.4\% accuracy for identifying signals. Further experiments show that, in contrast to traditional networks that rely on large simulated datasets, additional simulated samples do not improve LLM performance, while scaling studies reveal predictable gains with increasing model size and dataset size. These results indicate that LLMs can extract discriminative structure directly from observational data and provide an efficient assessment for gravitational wave identification. The same strategy may extend to other astronomical domains with similar noise properties, such as radio or pulsar observations.

### AugServe: Adaptive Request Scheduling for Augmented Large Language Model Inference Serving
**Authors**: Ying Wang, Zhen Jin, Jiexiong Xu, Wenhai Lin, Yiquan Chen, Wenzhi Chen

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T17:49:38Z

**Summary**: As augmented large language models (LLMs) with external tools become increasingly popular in web applications, improving augmented LLM inference serving efficiency and optimizing service-level objectives (SLOs) are critical for enhancing user experience. To achieve this, inference systems must maximize request handling within latency constraints, referred to as increasing effective throughput. However, existing systems face two major challenges: (i) reliance on first-come-first-served (FCFS) scheduling causes severe head-of-line blocking, leading to queuing delays exceeding the SLOs for many requests; and (ii) static batch token limit, which fails to adapt to fluctuating loads and hardware conditions. Both of these factors degrade effective throughput and service quality.   This paper presents AugServe, an efficient inference framework designed to reduce queueing latency and enhance effective throughput for augmented LLM inference services. The core idea of AugServe is a two-stage adaptive request scheduling strategy. Specifically, AugServe combines the inference features of augmented LLM requests to optimize the order of scheduling decisions (stage I). These decisions are continuously refined with runtime information (stage II), adapting to both request characteristics and system capabilities. In addition, AugServe dynamically adjusts the token batching mechanism based on hardware status and real-time load, further enhancing throughput performance. Experimental results show that AugServe achieves 4.7-33.1x and 3.3-13.2x higher effective throughput than vLLM and InferCept, while reducing time-to-first-token (TTFT) by up to 96.3% and 95.0%, respectively.

### Young children's anthropomorphism of an AI chatbot: Brain activation and the role of parent co-presence
**Authors**: Pilyoung Kim, Jenna H. Chin, Yun Xie, Nolan Brady, Tom Yeh, Sujin Yang

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T17:28:31Z

**Summary**: Artificial Intelligence (AI) chatbots powered by a large language model (LLM) are entering young children's learning and play, yet little is known about how young children construe these agents or how such construals relate to engagement. We examined anthropomorphism of a social AI chatbot during collaborative storytelling and asked how children's attributions related to their behavior and prefrontal activation. Children at ages 5-6 (N = 23) completed three storytelling sessions: interacting with (1) an AI chatbot only, (2) a parent only, and (3) the AI and a parent together. After the sessions, children completed an interview assessing anthropomorphism toward both the AI chatbot and the parent. Behavioral engagement was indexed by the conversational turn count (CTC) ratio, and concurrent fNIRS measured oxygenated hemoglobin in bilateral vmPFC and dmPFC regions. Children reported higher anthropomorphism for parents than for the AI chatbot overall, although AI ratings were relatively high for perceptive abilities and epistemic states. Anthropomorphism was not associated with CTC. In the right dmPFC, higher perceptive scores were associated with greater activation during the AI-only condition and with lower activation during the AI+Parent condition. Exploratory analyses indicated that higher dmPFC activation during the AI-only condition correlated with higher end-of-session "scared" mood ratings. Findings suggest that stronger perceptive anthropomorphism can be associated with greater brain activation related to interpreting the AI's mental states, whereas parent co-presence may help some children interpret and regulate novel AI interactions. These results may have design implications for encouraging parent-AI co-use in early childhood.

### Four Over Six: More Accurate NVFP4 Quantization with Adaptive Block Scaling
**Authors**: Jack Cook, Junxian Guo, Guangxuan Xiao, Yujun Lin, Song Han

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T17:24:59Z

**Summary**: As large language models have grown larger, low-precision numerical formats such as NVFP4 have become increasingly popular due to the speed and memory benefits they provide. However, to accelerate computation with NVFP4, all matrix multiplication operands--weights and activations in the forward pass, and weights, activations, and gradients in the backward pass--must be quantized to NVFP4, often leading to divergence during training and performance degradation during inference. To address this issue, in this work we introduce Four Over Six (4/6), a modification to the NVFP4 quantization algorithm that evaluates two potential scale factors for each block of values. Unlike integer formats, floating-point formats such as FP4 have the most quantization error on near-maximal values in each block, which we find to be primarily responsible for downstream performance degradation. We find that for some blocks, scaling to smaller FP4 values makes the distribution of representable values more uniform, improving representation of near-maximal values. Importantly, 4/6 can be implemented efficiently on NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs, making it viable to use while training LLMs with NVFP4. In pre-training experiments with transformer and hybrid model architectures, we find that 4/6 prevents divergence in several cases, bringing training loss significantly closer to BF16 compared to models trained with current state-of-the-art NVFP4 training recipes. We also find that 4/6 can be easily incorporated into many different post-training quantization methods and generally improves downstream accuracy. We hope this inspires future work in training and deploying models with NVFP4. Our code is available at http://github.com/mit-han-lab/fouroversix.

### Training-Free Policy Violation Detection via Activation-Space Whitening in LLMs
**Authors**: Oren Rachmil, Roy Betser, Itay Gershon, Omer Hofman, Nitay Yakoby, Yuval Meron, Idan Yankelev, Asaf Shabtai, Yuval Elovici, Roman Vainshtein

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T17:23:39Z

**Summary**: Aligning proprietary large language models (LLMs) with internal organizational policies has become an urgent priority as organizations increasingly deploy LLMs in sensitive domains such as legal support, finance, and medical services. Beyond generic safety filters, enterprises require reliable mechanisms to detect policy violations within their regulatory and operational frameworks, where breaches can trigger legal and reputational risks. Existing content moderation frameworks, such as guardrails, remain largely confined to the safety domain and lack the robustness to capture nuanced organizational policies. LLM-as-a-judge and fine-tuning approaches, though flexible, introduce significant latency and lack interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose a training-free and efficient method that treats policy violation detection as an out-of-distribution (OOD) detection problem. Inspired by whitening techniques, we apply a linear transformation to decorrelate the model's hidden activations and standardize them to zero mean and unit variance, yielding near-identity covariance matrix. In this transformed space, we use the Euclidean norm as a compliance score to detect policy violations. The method requires only the policy text and a small number of illustrative samples, which makes it light-weight and easily deployable. On a challenging policy benchmark, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing both existing guardrails and fine-tuned reasoning models. This work provides organizations with a practical and statistically grounded framework for policy-aware oversight of LLMs, advancing the broader goal of deployable AI governance.

### DirectDrag: High-Fidelity, Mask-Free, Prompt-Free Drag-based Image Editing via Readout-Guided Feature Alignment
**Authors**: Sheng-Hao Liao, Shang-Fu Chen, Tai-Ming Huang, Wen-Huang Cheng, Kai-Lung Hua

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T17:12:00Z

**Summary**: Drag-based image editing using generative models provides intuitive control over image structures. However, existing methods rely heavily on manually provided masks and textual prompts to preserve semantic fidelity and motion precision. Removing these constraints creates a fundamental trade-off: visual artifacts without masks and poor spatial control without prompts. To address these limitations, we propose DirectDrag, a novel mask- and prompt-free editing framework. DirectDrag enables precise and efficient manipulation with minimal user input while maintaining high image fidelity and accurate point alignment. DirectDrag introduces two key innovations. First, we design an Auto Soft Mask Generation module that intelligently infers editable regions from point displacement, automatically localizing deformation along movement paths while preserving contextual integrity through the generative model's inherent capacity. Second, we develop a Readout-Guided Feature Alignment mechanism that leverages intermediate diffusion activations to maintain structural consistency during point-based edits, substantially improving visual fidelity. Despite operating without manual mask or prompt, DirectDrag achieves superior image quality compared to existing methods while maintaining competitive drag accuracy. Extensive experiments on DragBench and real-world scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of DirectDrag for high-quality, interactive image manipulation.

### Adapting Large Language Models to Low-Resource Tibetan: A Two-Stage Continual and Supervised Fine-Tuning Study
**Authors**: Lifeng Chen, Ryan Lai, Tianming Liu

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T17:06:51Z

**Summary**: Adapting large language models (LLMs) to low-resource languages remains a major challenge due to data scarcity and cross-lingual drift. This work presents a two-stage adaptation of Qwen2.5-3B to Tibetan, a morphologically rich and underrepresented language. We employ Continual Pretraining (CPT) to establish Tibetan linguistic grounding, followed by Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) for task and translation specialization. Empirical evaluations demonstrate a consistent decrease in perplexity (from 2.98 $\rightarrow$ 1.54) and substantial improvements in Chinese$\rightarrow$Tibetan translation quality (BLEU: 0.046 $\rightarrow$ 0.261; chrF: 2.2 $\rightarrow$ 6.6). Layer-wise analysis across 435 layers in Qwen3-4B reveals that adaptation primarily concentrates on embedding and output heads, with mid--late MLP projections encoding domain-specific transformations. Our findings suggest that CPT constructs a Tibetan semantic manifold while SFT sharpens task alignment with minimal representational disruption. This study provides the first quantitative exploration of Tibetan adaptation dynamics for LLMs, and offers an open, reproducible framework for extending multilingual foundation models to low-resource settings.

### Sponsored Questions and How to Auction Them
**Authors**: Kshipra Bhawalkar, Alexandros Psomas, Di Wang

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T17:06:27Z

**Summary**: Online platforms connect users with relevant products and services using ads. A key challenge is that a user's search query often leaves their true intent ambiguous. Typically, platforms passively predict relevance based on available signals and in some cases offer query refinements. The shift from traditional search to conversational AI provides a new approach. When a user's query is ambiguous, a Large Language Model (LLM) can proactively offer several clarifying follow-up prompts. In this paper we consider the following: what if some of these follow-up prompts can be ``sponsored,'' i.e., selected for their advertising potential. How should these ``suggestion slots'' be allocated? And, how does this new mechanism interact with the traditional ad auction that might follow?   This paper introduces a formal model for designing and analyzing these interactive platforms. We use this model to investigate a critical engineering choice: whether it is better to build an end-to-end pipeline that jointly optimizes the user interaction and the final ad auction, or to decouple them into separate mechanisms for the suggestion slots and another for the subsequent ad slot. We show that the VCG mechanism can be adopted to jointly optimize the sponsored suggestion and the ads that follow; while this mechanism is more complex, it achieves outcomes that are efficient and truthful. On the other hand, we prove that the simple-to-implement modular approach suffers from strategic inefficiency: its Price of Anarchy is unbounded.

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T17:05:26Z

**Summary**: We report the discovery of two broad-line X-ray AGNs cid_414 and cid_947 at z~3 that exhibit prominent He I$λ$10830+ Pa$γ$ emission and absorption, identified from the JWST Cycle 3 large GO treasury program COSMOS-3D using NIRCam F444W grism spectroscopy. Additional UV/optical line measurements (e.g., Ly$α$, Si IV, C IV) come from complementary COSMOS-field spectroscopy. Both sources are robustly detected in the mid-infrared, with detections in MIRI F1000W for both AGNs and an additional detection in MIRI F2100W for cid_414, indicating the presence of hot dust emission. The source cid_947 shows a higher He I$λ$10830 absorption column density and X-ray-inferred $N_{\rm H}$, and displays strong outflow signatures in He I, Si IV, and C IV with velocity offsets exceeding 5000 km/s. The source cid_414 shows a narrow Ly$α$ emission line with luminosity $\log L_{\rm Lyα}=42.49\pm0.01~\mathrm{erg~s^{-1}}$ and a higher intrinsic 2-10 keV X-ray luminosity. Host-galaxy decomposition and multi-component SED fitting indicate that cid_947 hosts a more massive black hole but lower star formation rate than cid_414. From simplified photoionization modeling, we infer that the dense absorbing gas has a characteristic size comparable to the nuclear broad-line region and is likely kinematically coupled to the obscuration associated with the dust torus. He I$λ$1083 absorption has also been identified in several compact little red dots at similar redshifts. Together with the two AGNs reported here, these findings suggest that dense circumnuclear gas are plausibly prevalent at high redshift and plays an important role in regulating AGN obscuration and black hole--host co-evolution.

**Authors**: Steven Louis, Matthew Blake Abramson, Hannah Bradley, Cody Trevillian, Gene David Nelson, Andrei Slavin, Artem Litvinenko, Jason Gorski, Ilya N. Krivorotov, Darrin Hanna, Vasyl Tyberkevych

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T16:58:37Z

**Summary**: We present the design and numerical simulation of a spiking neuron capable of on-chip machine learning. Built within the CMOS+X framework, the spiking neuron consists of an NMOS transistor combined with a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ). This NMOS+MTJ unit, when simulated in the industry-standard circuit simulation software LTspice, reproduces multiple functions of a biological neuron, including threshold spiking, latency, refractory periods, synaptic integration, inhibition, and adaptation. These behaviors arise from the intrinsic magnetization dynamics of the MTJ and do not require any additional control circuitry. By interconnecting the NMOS+MTJ neurons, we construct a model of an analog multilayer network that learns through spike-timing-dependent weight updates derived from a gradient-descent rule, with both training and inference modeled in the analog domain. The simulated CMOS+X network achieves reliable spike propagation and successful training on a nonlinear task, indicating a feasible path toward compact, low-power, in-memory neuromorphic hardware for edge applications.

### Training for Identity, Inference for Controllability: A Unified Approach to Tuning-Free Face Personalization
**Authors**: Lianyu Pang, Ji Zhou, Qiping Wang, Baoquan Zhao, Zhenguo Yang, Qing Li, Xudong Mao

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T16:57:50Z

**Summary**: Tuning-free face personalization methods have developed along two distinct paradigms: text embedding approaches that map facial features into the text embedding space, and adapter-based methods that inject features through auxiliary cross-attention layers. While both paradigms have shown promise, existing methods struggle to simultaneously achieve high identity fidelity and flexible text controllability. We introduce UniID, a unified tuning-free framework that synergistically integrates both paradigms. Our key insight is that when merging these approaches, they should mutually reinforce only identity-relevant information while preserving the original diffusion prior for non-identity attributes. We realize this through a principled training-inference strategy: during training, we employ an identity-focused learning scheme that guides both branches to capture identity features exclusively; at inference, we introduce a normalized rescaling mechanism that recovers the text controllability of the base diffusion model while enabling complementary identity signals to enhance each other. This principled design enables UniID to achieve high-fidelity face personalization with flexible text controllability. Extensive experiments against six state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that UniID achieves superior performance in both identity preservation and text controllability. Code will be available at https://github.com/lyuPang/UniID

**Authors**: Niklas Jobs, Luis Miguel Vieira da Silva, Jayanth Somashekaraiah, Maximilian Weigand, David Kube, Felix Gehlhoff

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T16:49:14Z

**Summary**: Industrial automation increasingly requires flexible control strategies that can adapt to changing tasks and environments. Agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) offer potential for such adaptive planning and execution but lack standardized benchmarks for systematic comparison. We introduce a benchmark with an executable simulation environment representing the Blocksworld problem providing five complexity categories. By integrating the Model Context Protocol (MCP) as a standardized tool interface, diverse agent architectures can be connected to and evaluated against the benchmark without implementation-specific modifications. A single-agent implementation demonstrates the benchmark's applicability, establishing quantitative metrics for comparison of LLM-based planning and execution approaches.

### MUT3R: Motion-aware Updating Transformer for Dynamic 3D Reconstruction
**Authors**: Guole Shen, Tianchen Deng, Xingrui Qin, Nailin Wang, Jianyu Wang, Yanbo Wang, Yongtao Chen, Hesheng Wang, Jingchuan Wang

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T16:36:53Z

**Summary**: Recent stateful recurrent neural networks have achieved remarkable progress on static 3D reconstruction but remain vulnerable to motion-induced artifacts, where non-rigid regions corrupt attention propagation between the spatial memory and image feature. By analyzing the internal behaviors of the state and image token updating mechanism, we find that aggregating self-attention maps across layers reveals a consistent pattern: dynamic regions are naturally down-weighted, exposing an implicit motion cue that the pretrained transformer already encodes but never explicitly uses. Motivated by this observation, we introduce MUT3R, a training-free framework that applies the attention-derived motion cue to suppress dynamic content in the early layers of the transformer during inference. Our attention-level gating module suppresses the influence of dynamic regions before their artifacts propagate through the feature hierarchy. Notably, we do not retrain or fine-tune the model; we let the pretrained transformer diagnose its own motion cues and correct itself. This early regulation stabilizes geometric reasoning in streaming scenarios and leads to improvements in temporal consistency and camera pose robustness across multiple dynamic benchmarks, offering a simple and training-free pathway toward motion-aware streaming reconstruction.

### OD-MoE: On-Demand Expert Loading for Cacheless Edge-Distributed MoE Inference
**Authors**: Liujianfu Wang, Yuyang Du, Yuchen Pan, Soung Chang Liew, Jiacheng Liu, Kexin Chen

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T16:27:16Z

**Summary**: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), while offering significant advantages as a Large Language Model (LLM) architecture, faces substantial challenges when deployed on low-cost edge devices with tight memory constraints. Expert offloading mitigates this issue by storing expert parameters in CPU memory and caching a subset of popular experts in GPU memory. Although this approach improves GPU memory utilization by caching only the likely-used experts, the GPU memory reserved for expert caching is underutilized compared with dense LLMs. This paper presents OD-MoE, a distributed MoE inference framework that obviates the need for expert caches via fully on-demand expert loading. OD-MoE is built upon two key mechanisms: 1) parallelizing expert loading and expert computation across distributed edge nodes, and 2) an ultra-accurate emulative predictor that forecasts expert activations multiple layers ahead while expert computation is ongoing. With these innovations, OD-MoE dynamically loads each target expert to one of the distributed nodes just-in-time before its activation and promptly evicts it afterward, freeing GPU memory for subsequent experts. We comprehensively benchmark OD-MoE against state-of-the-art MoE offloading systems on a ten-node testbed. Experimental results show that: 1) OD-MoE achieves 99.94% expert activation prediction accuracy, substantially surpassing all existing methods; and 2) OD-MoE delivers approximately 75% of the decoding speed of a fully GPU-cached MoE deployment while using only 1/3 of the GPU memory. More importantly, by eliminating the need for expert caches, OD-MoE enables MoE inference on edge nodes with less-than-1GB GPU memory, paving the way for practical MoE deployment of low-cost IoT devices at the edge in the LLM era.

### SLO-aware GPU Frequency Scaling for Energy Efficient LLM Inference Serving
**Authors**: Andreas Kosmas Kakolyris, Dimosthenis Masouros, Petros Vavaroutsos, Sotirios Xydis, Dimitrios Soudris

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T16:21:24Z

**Summary**: As Large Language Models (LLMs) gain traction, their reliance on power-hungry GPUs places ever-increasing energy demands, raising environmental and monetary concerns. Inference dominates LLM workloads, presenting a critical challenge for providers: minimizing energy costs under Service-Level Objectives (SLOs) that ensure optimal user experience. In this paper, we present \textit{throttLL'eM}, a framework that reduces energy consumption while meeting SLOs through the use of instance and GPU frequency scaling. \textit{throttLL'eM} features mechanisms that project future KV cache usage and batch size. Leveraging a Machine-Learning (ML) model that receives these projections as inputs, \textit{throttLL'eM} manages performance at the iteration level to satisfy SLOs with reduced frequencies and instance sizes. We show that the proposed ML model achieves $R^2$ scores greater than 0.97 and miss-predicts performance by less than 1 iteration per second on average. Experimental results on LLM inference traces show that \textit{throttLL'eM} achieves up to 43.8\% lower energy consumption and an energy efficiency improvement of at least $1.71\times$ under SLOs, when compared to NVIDIA's Triton server.

### Passive Silicon Nitride On-Chip Polarimetry: Precise Polarization Detection with Imperfect Components
**Authors**: Christoph Stockinger, Natale G. Pruiti, Isaac Tribaldo, Jörg S. Eismann, Marc Sorel, Peter Banzer

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T16:04:00Z

**Summary**: Polarization is a fundamental property of light that carries distinct and valuable information. Consequently, its precise measurement is crucial for numerous applications, including biomedical imaging, remote sensing, and optical communication. Since polarization cannot be measured directly, it is typically inferred by converting it into intensity signals using dedicated optical elements. Conventional approaches, however, predominantly rely on bulky optical components, leading to considerably high fabrication costs and limited integration density. Here, we introduce a passive photonic integrated circuit capable of precisely determining the polarization state of visible free-space light. An silicon nitride on-chip architecture employing a compact polarization-splitting grating coupler and a set of passive interferometers encodes the polarization information into intensity signals, allowing conventional detectors to accurately reconstruct the polarization state. With increasing compactness of photonic components, however, susceptibility to fabrication tolerances as well as intrinsic design constraints increases, potentially leading to non\-/ideal behaviour. To address this, we introduce a robust calibration procedure that enables precise measurements even in the presence of imperfections. The chip design, combined with the calibration procedure, offers a robust, small-footprint, and high-speed approach to polarimetry, enabling a wide range of applications.

### UniMo: Unifying 2D Video and 3D Human Motion with an Autoregressive Framework
**Authors**: Youxin Pang, Yong Zhang, Ruizhi Shao, Xiang Deng, Feng Gao, Xu Xiaoming, Xiaoming Wei, Yebin Liu

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T16:03:18Z

**Summary**: We propose UniMo, an innovative autoregressive model for joint modeling of 2D human videos and 3D human motions within a unified framework, enabling simultaneous generation and understanding of these two modalities for the first time. Current methods predominantly focus on generating one modality given another as the condition or integrating either of them with other modalities such as text and audio. Unifying 2D videos and 3D motions for simultaneous optimization and generation remains largely unexplored, presenting significant challenges due to their substantial structural and distributional differences. Inspired by the LLM's ability to unify different modalities, our method models videos and 3D motions as a unified tokens sequence, utilizing separate embedding layers to mitigate distribution gaps. Additionally, we devise a sequence modeling strategy that integrates two distinct tasks within a single framework, proving the effectiveness of unified modeling. Moreover, to efficiently align with visual tokens and preserve 3D spatial information, we design a novel 3D motion tokenizer with a temporal expansion strategy, using a single VQ-VAE to produce quantized motion tokens. It features multiple expert decoders that handle body shapes, translation, global orientation, and body poses for reliable 3D motion reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method simultaneously generates corresponding videos and motions while performing accurate motion capture. This work taps into the capacity of LLMs to fuse diverse data types, paving the way for integrating human-centric information into existing models and potentially enabling multimodal, controllable joint modeling of humans, objects, and scenes.

### Autonomous Reinforcement Learning Robot Control with Intel's Loihi 2 Neuromorphic Hardware
**Authors**: Kenneth Stewart, Roxana Leontie, Samantha Chapin, Joe Hays, Sumit Bam Shrestha, Carl Glen Henshaw

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T15:56:39Z

**Summary**: We present an end-to-end pipeline for deploying reinforcement learning (RL) trained Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) on neuromorphic hardware by converting them into spiking Sigma-Delta Neural Networks (SDNNs). We demonstrate that an ANN policy trained entirely in simulation can be transformed into an SDNN compatible with Intel's Loihi 2 architecture, enabling low-latency and energy-efficient inference. As a test case, we use an RL policy for controlling the Astrobee free-flying robot, similar to a previously hardware in space-validated controller. The policy, trained with Rectified Linear Units (ReLUs), is converted to an SDNN and deployed on Intel's Loihi 2, then evaluated in NVIDIA's Omniverse Isaac Lab simulation environment for closed-loop control of Astrobee's motion. We compare execution performance between GPU and Loihi 2. The results highlight the feasibility of using neuromorphic platforms for robotic control and establish a pathway toward energy-efficient, real-time neuromorphic computation in future space and terrestrial robotics applications.

### Les Dissonances: Cross-Tool Harvesting and Polluting in Pool-of-Tools Empowered LLM Agents
**Authors**: Zichuan Li, Jian Cui, Xiaojing Liao, Luyi Xing

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T15:51:02Z

**Summary**: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are autonomous systems powered by LLMs, capable of reasoning and planning to solve problems by leveraging a set of tools. However, the integration of multi-tool capabilities in LLM agents introduces challenges in securely managing tools, ensuring their compatibility, handling dependency relationships, and protecting control flows within LLM agent workflows. In this paper, we present the first systematic security analysis of task control flows in multi-tool-enabled LLM agents. We identify a novel threat, Cross-Tool Harvesting and Polluting (XTHP), which includes multiple attack vectors to first hijack the normal control flows of agent tasks, and then collect and pollute confidential or private information within LLM agent systems. To understand the impact of this threat, we developed Chord, a dynamic scanning tool designed to automatically detect real-world agent tools susceptible to XTHP attacks. Our evaluation of 66 real-world tools from the repositories of two major LLM agent development frameworks, LangChain and LlamaIndex, revealed a significant security concern: 75% are vulnerable to XTHP attacks, highlighting the prevalence of this threat.

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T15:41:58Z

**Summary**: The NSF-DOE Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), beginning full operations in late 2025, will dramatically transform solar system science by vastly expanding discoveries and providing detailed characterization opportunities across all small body populations. This includes the co-orbiting 1:1 resonant Neptune Trojans, which are thought to be dynamically hot captures from the protoplanetary disk. Using the survey simulator $\texttt{Sorcha}$, combined with the latest LSST cadence simulations, we present the very first predictions for the Neptune Trojan yield within the LSST. We forecast a model-dependent median number of $\sim130-300$ discovered Neptune Trojans, and infer a notable 2:1 detection bias toward the recently emerged L5 cloud near the galactic plane versus the L4 cloud, reflecting the lower-cadence coverage in the Northern Ecliptic Spur region that suppresses L4 detections. The additionally simulated Science Validation survey will offer the very first early insights into this understudied cloud. Around 60\% of detected main survey Neptune Trojans will meet stringent color light curve quality criteria, increasing the sample size more than fourfold compared to existing datasets. This enhanced sample will enable robust statistical analyses of Neptune Trojan color and size distributions, crucial for understanding their origins and relationship to the broader trans-Neptunian population. These comprehensive color measurements represent a major step forward in characterizing the Neptune Trojan population and will facilitate future targeted spectroscopic observations.

### A Hierarchical Tree-based approach for creating Configurable and Static Deep Research Agent (Static-DRA)
**Authors**: Saurav Prateek

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T15:37:13Z

**Summary**: The advancement in Large Language Models has driven the creation of complex agentic systems, such as Deep Research Agents (DRAs), to overcome the limitations of static Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines in handling complex, multi-turn research tasks. This paper introduces the Static Deep Research Agent (Static-DRA), a novel solution built upon a configurable and hierarchical Tree-based static workflow.   The core contribution is the integration of two user-tunable parameters, Depth and Breadth, which provide granular control over the research intensity. This design allows end-users to consciously balance the desired quality and comprehensiveness of the research report against the associated computational cost of Large Language Model (LLM) interactions. The agent's architecture, comprising Supervisor, Independent, and Worker agents, facilitates effective multi-hop information retrieval and parallel sub-topic investigation.   We evaluate the Static-DRA against the established DeepResearch Bench using the RACE (Reference-based Adaptive Criteria-driven Evaluation) framework. Configured with a depth of 2 and a breadth of 5, and powered by the gemini-2.5-pro model, the agent achieved an overall score of 34.72. Our experiments validate that increasing the configured Depth and Breadth parameters results in a more in-depth research process and a correspondingly higher evaluation score. The Static-DRA offers a pragmatic and resource-aware solution, empowering users with transparent control over the deep research process.

### Automatic Attack Discovery for Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning via Large Language Models
**Authors**: Haidong Kang, Wei Wu, Hanling Wang

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T15:34:26Z

**Summary**: Few-shot class incremental learning (FSCIL) is a more realistic and challenging paradigm in continual learning to incrementally learn unseen classes and overcome catastrophic forgetting on base classes with only a few training examples. Previous efforts have primarily centered around studying more effective FSCIL approaches. By contrast, less attention was devoted to thinking the security issues in contributing to FSCIL. This paper aims to provide a holistic study of the impact of attacks on FSCIL. We first derive insights by systematically exploring how human expert-designed attack methods (i.e., PGD, FGSM) affect FSCIL. We find that those methods either fail to attack base classes, or suffer from huge labor costs due to relying on huge expert knowledge. This highlights the need to craft a specialized attack method for FSCIL. Grounded in these insights, in this paper, we propose a simple yet effective ACraft method to automatically steer and discover optimal attack methods targeted at FSCIL by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) without human experts. Moreover, to improve the reasoning between LLMs and FSCIL, we introduce a novel Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) based reinforcement learning to optimize learning, making LLMs generate better attack methods in the next generation by establishing positive feedback. Experiments on mainstream benchmarks show that our ACraft significantly degrades the performance of state-of-the-art FSCIL methods and dramatically beyond human expert-designed attack methods while maintaining the lowest costs of attack.

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have fundamentally transformed automated software development by enabling direct translation of natural language descriptions into functional code, driving commercial adoption through tools like Github Copilot (Microsoft), Cursor (Anysphere), Trae (ByteDance), and Claude Code (Anthropic). While the field has evolved dramatically from rule-based systems to Transformer-based architectures, achieving performance improvements from single-digit to over 95\% success rates on benchmarks like HumanEval. In this work, we provide a comprehensive synthesis and practical guide (a series of analytic and probing experiments) about code LLMs, systematically examining the complete model life cycle from data curation to post-training through advanced prompting paradigms, code pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and autonomous coding agents. We analyze the code capability of the general LLMs (GPT-4, Claude, LLaMA) and code-specialized LLMs (StarCoder, Code LLaMA, DeepSeek-Coder, and QwenCoder), critically examining the techniques, design decisions, and trade-offs. Further, we articulate the research-practice gap between academic research (e.g., benchmarks and tasks) and real-world deployment (e.g., software-related code tasks), including code correctness, security, contextual awareness of large codebases, and integration with development workflows, and map promising research directions to practical needs. Last, we conduct a series of experiments to provide a comprehensive analysis of code pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning, covering scaling law, framework selection, hyperparameter sensitivity, model architectures, and dataset comparisons.

### OmniDexVLG: Learning Dexterous Grasp Generation from Vision Language Model-Guided Grasp Semantics, Taxonomy and Functional Affordance
**Authors**: Lei Zhang, Diwen Zheng, Kaixin Bai, Zhenshan Bing, Zoltan-Csaba Marton, Zhaopeng Chen, Alois Christian Knoll, Jianwei Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T15:28:23Z

**Summary**: Dexterous grasp generation aims to produce grasp poses that align with task requirements and human interpretable grasp semantics. However, achieving semantically controllable dexterous grasp synthesis remains highly challenging due to the lack of unified modeling of multiple semantic dimensions, including grasp taxonomy, contact semantics, and functional affordance. To address these limitations, we present OmniDexVLG, a multimodal, semantics aware grasp generation framework capable of producing structurally diverse and semantically coherent dexterous grasps under joint language and visual guidance. Our approach begins with OmniDexDataGen, a semantic rich dexterous grasp dataset generation pipeline that integrates grasp taxonomy guided configuration sampling, functional affordance contact point sampling, taxonomy aware differential force closure grasp sampling, and physics based optimization and validation, enabling systematic coverage of diverse grasp types. We further introduce OmniDexReasoner, a multimodal grasp type semantic reasoning module that leverages multi agent collaboration, retrieval augmented generation, and chain of thought reasoning to infer grasp related semantics and generate high quality annotations that align language instructions with task specific grasp intent. Building upon these components, we develop a unified Vision Language Grasping generation model that explicitly incorporates grasp taxonomy, contact structure, and functional affordance semantics, enabling fine grained control over grasp synthesis from natural language instructions. Extensive experiments in simulation and real world object grasping and ablation studies demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms state of the art approaches in terms of grasp diversity, contact semantic diversity, functional affordance diversity, and semantic consistency.

**Summary**: Transformer decoders have achieved strong results across tasks, but the memory required for the KV cache becomes prohibitive at long sequence lengths. Although Cross-layer KV Cache sharing (e.g., YOCO, CLA) offers a path to mitigate KV Cache bottleneck, it typically underperforms within-layer methods like GQA. To understand the root cause, we investigate the information flow of keys and values of the top-layers. Our preliminary reveals a clear distribution: values are predominantly derived from the bottom layer, while keys draw more information from both bottom and middle layers. Building upon this, we propose FusedKV, whose top-layer KV caches are a learnable fusion of the most informative ones from the bottom and middle layers. This fusion operates directly on post-RoPE keys, preserving relative positional information without the computational cost of re-applying rotary embeddings. To further improve efficiency, we propose FusedKV-Lite, an cross-layer sharing approach, where top-layer KV caches are directly derived from the bottom-layer values and the middle-layer keys. Compared to FusedKV, FusedKV-Lite reduces I/O overhead at the cost of a slight increase in perplexity. In experiments on LLMs ranging from 332M to 4B parameters, our proposed method reduce 50\% cache memory while achieving lower validation perplexity than the standard Transformer decoder, establishing it as a memory-efficient, high-performance architectural alternative.

### Stabilizing Reinforcement Learning with LLMs: Formulation and Practices
**Authors**: Chujie Zheng, Kai Dang, Bowen Yu, Mingze Li, Huiqiang Jiang, Junrong Lin, Yuqiong Liu, Hao Lin, Chencan Wu, Feng Hu, An Yang, Jingren Zhou, Junyang Lin

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T15:17:19Z

**Summary**: This paper proposes a novel formulation for reinforcement learning (RL) with large language models, explaining why and under what conditions the true sequence-level reward can be optimized via a surrogate token-level objective in policy gradient methods such as REINFORCE. Specifically, through a first-order approximation, we show that this surrogate becomes increasingly valid only when both the training-inference discrepancy and policy staleness are minimized. This insight provides a principled explanation for the crucial role of several widely adopted techniques in stabilizing RL training, including importance sampling correction, clipping, and particularly Routing Replay for Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models. Through extensive experiments with a 30B MoE model totaling hundreds of thousands of GPU hours, we show that for on-policy training, the basic policy gradient algorithm with importance sampling correction achieves the highest training stability. When off-policy updates are introduced to accelerate convergence, combining clipping and Routing Replay becomes essential to mitigate the instability caused by policy staleness. Notably, once training is stabilized, prolonged optimization consistently yields comparable final performance regardless of cold-start initialization. We hope that the shared insights and the developed recipes for stable RL training will facilitate future research.

**Authors**: Danny Hoang, Anandkumar Patel, Ruimen Chen, Rajiv Malhotra, Farhad Imani

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T15:14:34Z

**Summary**: Smart manufacturing can significantly improve efficiency and reduce energy consumption, yet the energy demands of AI models may offset these gains. This study utilizes in-situ sensing-based prediction of geometric quality in smart machining to compare the energy consumption, accuracy, and speed of common AI models. HyperDimensional Computing (HDC) is introduced as an alternative, achieving accuracy comparable to conventional models while drastically reducing energy consumption, 200$\times$ for training and 175 to 1000$\times$ for inference. Furthermore, HDC reduces training times by 200$\times$ and inference times by 300 to 600$\times$, showcasing its potential for energy-efficient smart manufacturing.

### SUP: An Inferable Private Multiple Testing Framework with Super Uniformity
**Authors**: Kehan Wang, Wenxuan Song, Wangli Xu, Linglong Kong

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T15:06:17Z

**Summary**: Multiple testing is widely applied across scientific fields, particularly in genomic and health data analysis, where protecting sensitive personal information is imperative. However, developing private multiple testing algorithms for super uniform $p$-values remains an open question, as privacy mechanisms introduce intricate dependence among the peeled $p$-values and disrupt their super uniformity, complicating post-selection inference. To address this, we introduce a general Super Uniform Private (SUP) multiple testing framework with three key components. First, we develop a novel \( p \)-value transformation that is compatible with diverse privacy regimes while retaining the super uniformity. Next, a reversed peeling algorithm is designed to reduce privacy budgets while facilitating inference. Then, we provide diverse rejection thresholds that are privacy-parameter-free and tailored for different Type-I errors, including the family-wise error rate (FWER) and the false discovery rate (FDR). Building upon these, we advance adaptive techniques to determine the peeling number and boost thresholds. Theoretically, we propose a technique overcoming the post-selection obstacle to Type-I error control, quantify the privacy-induced power loss of SUP relative to its non-private counterpart, and demonstrate that SUP surpasses existing private methods in terms of power. The results of extensive simulations and a real data application validate our theories.

### DVPO: Distributional Value Modeling-based Policy Optimization for LLM Post-Training

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T14:48:38Z

**Summary**: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown strong performance in LLM post-training, but real-world deployment often involves noisy or incomplete supervision. In such settings, complex and unreliable supervision signals can destabilize training and harm generalization. While existing approaches such as worst-case optimization (e.g., RFQI, CQL) and mean-based methods (e.g., PPO, GRPO) can improve stability, they often overlook generalization and may produce overly conservative policies, leading to uneven performance across diverse real scenarios. To this end, we introduce DVPO (Distributional Value Modeling with Risk-aware Policy Optimization), a new RL framework that combines conditional risk theory with distributional value modeling to better balance robustness and generalization. DVPO learns token-level value distributions to provide fine-grained supervision, and applies an asymmetric risk regularization to shape the distribution tails: it contracts the lower tail to dampen noisy negative deviations, while expanding the upper tail to preserve exploratory diversity. Across extensive experiments and analysis in multi-turn dialogue, math reasoning, and scientific QA, DVPO consistently outperforms PPO, GRPO, and robust Bellman-based PPO under noisy supervision, showing its potential for LLM post-training in the real-world.

### MP1: MeanFlow Tames Policy Learning in 1-step for Robotic Manipulation
**Authors**: Juyi Sheng, Ziyi Wang, Peiming Li, Mengyuan Liu

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T14:47:29Z

**Summary**: In robot manipulation, robot learning has become a prevailing approach. However, generative models within this field face a fundamental trade-off between the slow, iterative sampling of diffusion models and the architectural constraints of faster Flow-based methods, which often rely on explicit consistency losses. To address these limitations, we introduce MP1, which pairs 3D point-cloud inputs with the MeanFlow paradigm to generate action trajectories in one network function evaluation (1-NFE). By directly learning the interval-averaged velocity via the "MeanFlow Identity", our policy avoids any additional consistency constraints. This formulation eliminates numerical ODE-solver errors during inference, yielding more precise trajectories. MP1 further incorporates CFG for improved trajectory controllability while retaining 1-NFE inference without reintroducing structural constraints. Because subtle scene-context variations are critical for robot learning, especially in few-shot learning, we introduce a lightweight Dispersive Loss that repels state embeddings during training, boosting generalization without slowing inference. We validate our method on the Adroit and Meta-World benchmarks, as well as in real-world scenarios. Experimental results show MP1 achieves superior average task success rates, outperforming DP3 by 10.2% and FlowPolicy by 7.3%. Its average inference time is only 6.8 ms-19x faster than DP3 and nearly 2x faster than FlowPolicy. Our project page is available at https://mp1-2254.github.io/, and the code can be accessed at https://github.com/LogSSim/MP1.

### Intermittency from Instanton Calculus at the Transition to Turbulence and Fusion Rules
**Authors**: Timo Schorlepp, Rainer Grauer

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T14:41:26Z

**Summary**: Understanding intermittency of turbulent systems from the underlying differential equations is an outstanding problem in fluid dynamics. Here, in the example of Burgers turbulence, we introduce a method that yields structure function exponents by combining instanton calculus and fusion rule predictions. We use instantons to evaluate velocity gradient (VG) moments at the onset of intermittency, and then infer scaling exponents in fully developed turbulence via fusion rules. We show that the method captures the phase transition at $\mathrm{Re}_λ\approx 1$ in the VG moment scaling, highlight the necessity of including fluctuations around instantons, and discuss future extensions.

### Training and Evaluation of Guideline-Based Medical Reasoning in LLMs
**Authors**: Michael Staniek, Artem Sokolov, Stefan Riezler

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T14:39:02Z

**Summary**: Machine learning for early prediction in medicine has recently shown breakthrough performance, however, the focus on improving prediction accuracy has led to a neglect of faithful explanations that are required to gain the trust of medical practitioners. The goal of this paper is to teach LLMs to follow medical consensus guidelines step-by-step in their reasoning and prediction process. Since consensus guidelines are ubiquitous in medicine, instantiations of verbalized medical inference rules to electronic health records provide data for fine-tuning LLMs to learn consensus rules and possible exceptions thereof for many medical areas. Consensus rules also enable an automatic evaluation of the model's inference process regarding its derivation correctness (evaluating correct and faithful deduction of a conclusion from given premises) and value correctness (comparing predicted values against real-world measurements). We exemplify our work using the complex Sepsis-3 consensus definition. Our experiments show that small fine-tuned models outperform one-shot learning of considerably larger LLMs that are prompted with the explicit definition and models that are trained on medical texts including consensus definitions. Since fine-tuning on verbalized rule instantiations of a specific medical area yields nearly perfect derivation correctness for rules (and exceptions) on unseen patient data in that area, the bottleneck for early prediction is not out-of-distribution generalization, but the orthogonal problem of generalization into the future by forecasting sparsely and irregularly sampled clinical variables. We show that the latter results can be improved by integrating the output representations of a time series forecasting model with the LLM in a multimodal setup.

### Lean Unet: A Compact Model for Image Segmentation
**Authors**: Ture Hassler, Ida Åkerholm, Marcus Nordström, Gabriele Balletti, Orcun Goksel

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T14:35:21Z

**Summary**: Unet and its variations have been standard in semantic image segmentation, especially for computer assisted radiology. Current Unet architectures iteratively downsample spatial resolution while increasing channel dimensions to preserve information content. Such a structure demands a large memory footprint, limiting training batch sizes and increasing inference latency. Channel pruning compresses Unet architecture without accuracy loss, but requires lengthy optimization and may not generalize across tasks and datasets. By investigating Unet pruning, we hypothesize that the final structure is the crucial factor, not the channel selection strategy of pruning. Based on our observations, we propose a lean Unet architecture (LUnet) with a compact, flat hierarchy where channels are not doubled as resolution is halved. We evaluate on a public MRI dataset allowing comparable reporting, as well as on two internal CT datasets. We show that a state-of-the-art pruning solution (STAMP) mainly prunes from the layers with the highest number of channels. Comparatively, simply eliminating a random channel at the pruning-identified layer or at the largest layer achieves similar or better performance. Our proposed LUnet with fixed architectures and over 30 times fewer parameters achieves performance comparable to both conventional Unet counterparts and data-adaptively pruned networks. The proposed lean Unet with constant channel count across layers requires far fewer parameters while achieving performance superior to standard Unet for the same total number of parameters. Skip connections allow Unet bottleneck channels to be largely reduced, unlike standard encoder-decoder architectures requiring increased bottleneck channels for information propagation.

### Locally Adaptive Conformal Inference for Operator Models
**Authors**: Trevor Harris, Yan Liu

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T14:31:43Z

**Summary**: Operator models are regression algorithms between Banach spaces of functions. They have become an increasingly critical tool for spatiotemporal forecasting and physics emulation, especially in high-stakes scenarios where robust, calibrated uncertainty quantification is required. We introduce Local Sliced Conformal Inference (LSCI), a distribution-free framework for generating function-valued, locally adaptive prediction sets for operator models. We prove finite-sample validity and derive a data-dependent upper bound on the coverage gap under local exchangeability. On synthetic Gaussian-process tasks and real applications (air quality monitoring, energy demand forecasting, and weather prediction), LSCI yields tighter sets with stronger adaptivity compared to conformal baselines. We also empirically demonstrate robustness against biased predictions and certain out-of-distribution noise regimes.

### Uncertainty Quantification for LLMs through Minimum Bayes Risk: Bridging Confidence and Consistency
**Authors**: Roman Vashurin, Maiya Goloburda, Albina Ilina, Aleksandr Rubashevskii, Preslav Nakov, Artem Shelmanov, Maxim Panov

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T14:29:00Z

**Summary**: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) encompass a variety of approaches, with two major types being particularly prominent: information-based, which focus on model confidence expressed as token probabilities, and consistency-based, which assess the semantic relationship between multiple outputs generated using repeated sampling. Several recent methods have combined these two approaches to boost UQ performance. However, they sometimes fail to outperform much simpler baseline methods. Our work discusses the fundamental approach to constructing uncertainty measures that directly links uncertainty with the minimum Bayes risks achieved by LLM decoding. Building on these findings, we propose a novel approach to integrating model confidence with output consistency, resulting in a family of efficient and robust UQ methods. Our investigation reveals distinctive characteristics of LLMs as probabilistic models, which help to explain why these UQ methods underperform in certain tasks. Based on these findings, we propose a new way of synthesizing model confidence and output consistency, leading to a family of efficient and robust UQ methods. We evaluate our approach across various tasks such as question answering, abstractive summarization, and machine translation, demonstrating sizable improvements over state-of-the-art UQ approaches.

### Cataloguing Hugging Face Models to Software Engineering Activities: Automation and Findings
**Authors**: Alexandra González, Xavier Franch, David Lo, Silverio Martínez-Fernández

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T14:18:58Z

**Summary**: Context: Open-source Pre-Trained Models (PTMs) provide extensive resources for various Machine Learning (ML) tasks, yet these resources lack a classification tailored to Software Engineering (SE) needs to support the reliable identification and reuse of models for SE. Objective: To address this gap, we derive a taxonomy encompassing 147 SE tasks and apply an SE-oriented classification to PTMs in a popular open-source ML repository, Hugging Face (HF). Method: Our repository mining study followed a five-phase pipeline: (i) identification SE tasks from the literature; (ii) collection of PTM data from the HF API, including model card descriptions and metadata, and the abstracts of the associated arXiv papers; (iii) text processing to ensure consistency; (iv) a two-phase validation of SE relevance, involving humans and LLM assistance, supported by five pilot studies with human annotators and a generalization test; (v) and data analysis. This process yielded a curated catalogue of 2,205 SE PTMs. Results: We find that most SE PTMs target code generation and coding, emphasizing implementation over early or late development stages. In terms of ML tasks, text generation dominates within SE PTMs. Notably, the number of SE PTMs has increased markedly since 2023 Q2, while evaluation remains limited: only 9.6% report benchmark results, mostly scoring below 50%. Conclusions: Our catalogue reveals documentation and transparency gaps, highlights imbalances across SDLC phases, and provides a foundation for automated SE scenarios, such as the sampling and selection of suitable PTMs.

### Fairy2i: Training Complex LLMs from Real LLMs with All Parameters in $\{\pm 1, \pm i\}$
**Authors**: Feiyu Wang, Xinyu Tan, Bokai Huang, Yihao Zhang, Guoan Wang, Peizhuang Cong, Tong Yang

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T14:15:05Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized artificial intelligence, yet their massive memory and computational demands necessitate aggressive quantization, increasingly pushing representations toward the theoretical limit of a single bit. While complex-valued LLMs, such as iFairy, offer a superior chance for low-bit representation compared to real-valued counterparts, they require training from scratch, preventing the utilization of the vast ecosystem of pre-trained real-valued foundation models. Here we present Fairy2i, a universal framework that transforms pre-trained real-valued layers into an equivalent widely-linear complex form, enabling extremely low-bit quantization while reusing existing checkpoints. By proving a lossless mathematical equivalence between real and widely-linear maps, we convert standard Transformers into the complex domain and employ a phase-aware quantization scheme with a highly efficient codebook of fourth roots of unity. Furthermore, we introduce a recursive residual quantization mechanism that iteratively minimizes quantization error, allowing inference to proceed via efficient multiplication-free accumulation. We demonstrate that Fairy2i restores the performance of LLaMA-2 7B at an effective 2-bit precision to levels nearly comparable with full-precision baselines, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art real-valued binary and ternary quantization methods. This work bridges the gap between the representational efficiency of complex-valued arithmetic and the practical utility of pre-trained models, paving a new way for efficient inference on commodity hardware.

### Improving Alignment Between Human and Machine Codes: An Empirical Assessment of Prompt Engineering for Construct Identification in Psychology
**Authors**: Kylie L. Anglin, Stephanie Milan, Brittney Hernandez, Claudia Ventura

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T14:07:42Z

**Summary**: Due to their architecture and vast pre-training data, large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong text classification performance. However, LLM output - here, the category assigned to a text - depends heavily on the wording of the prompt. While literature on prompt engineering is expanding, few studies focus on classification tasks, and even fewer address domains like psychology, where constructs have precise, theory-driven definitions that may not be well represented in pre-training data. We present an empirical framework for optimizing LLM performance for identifying constructs in texts via prompt engineering. We experimentally evaluate five prompting strategies --codebook-guided empirical prompt selection, automatic prompt engineering, persona prompting, chain-of-thought reasoning, and explanatory prompting - with zero-shot and few-shot classification. We find that persona, chain-of-thought, and explanations do not fully address performance loss accompanying a badly worded prompt. Instead, the most influential features of a prompt are the construct definition, task framing, and, to a lesser extent, the examples provided. Across three constructs and two models, the classifications most aligned with expert judgments resulted from a few-shot prompt combining codebook-guided empirical prompt selection with automatic prompt engineering. Based on our findings, we recommend that researchers generate and evaluate as many prompt variants as feasible, whether human-crafted, automatically generated, or ideally both, and select prompts and examples based on empirical performance in a training dataset, validating the final approach in a holdout set. This procedure offers a practical, systematic, and theory-driven method for optimizing LLM prompts in settings where alignment with expert judgment is critical.

### Log Probability Tracking of LLM APIs
**Authors**: Timothée Chauvin, Erwan Le Merrer, François Taïani, Gilles Tredan

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T14:03:43Z

**Summary**: When using an LLM through an API provider, users expect the served model to remain consistent over time, a property crucial for the reliability of downstream applications and the reproducibility of research. Existing audit methods are too costly to apply at regular time intervals to the wide range of available LLM APIs. This means that model updates are left largely unmonitored in practice. In this work, we show that while LLM log probabilities (logprobs) are usually non-deterministic, they can still be used as the basis for cost-effective continuous monitoring of LLM APIs. We apply a simple statistical test based on the average value of each token logprob, requesting only a single token of output. This is enough to detect changes as small as one step of fine-tuning, making this approach more sensitive than existing methods while being 1,000x cheaper. We introduce the TinyChange benchmark as a way to measure the sensitivity of audit methods in the context of small, realistic model changes.

### Enhancing Instruction-Following Capabilities in Seq2Seq Models: DoLA Adaptations for T5
**Authors**: Huey Sun, Anabel Yong, Lorenzo Gilly, Felipe Jin

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T13:54:11Z

**Summary**: Contrastive decoding is a lightweight and effective inference-time method that improves the quality of text generation in Large Language Models. However, algorithms such as DoLa (Decoding by Contrastive Layers) have only been implemented in decoder-only architectures and studied for their impact on improving factuality. This work adapts DoLa for the T5 and FLAN-T5 model families and evaluates its impact on the models' instruction following capabilities, which to our knowledge is the first implementation of a contrastive decoding strategy in an encoder-decoder architecture. Our results show that DoLa improves the faithfulness of text generation for certain categories of tasks and harms others. To understand these results, we present a layer-by-layer analysis of logit evolution in a FLAN-T5 model to quantify DoLa's impact on token output probabilities.

### LSRS: Latent Scale Rejection Sampling for Visual Autoregressive Modeling
**Authors**: Hong-Kai Zheng, Piji Li

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T13:44:30Z

**Summary**: Visual Autoregressive (VAR) modeling approach for image generation proposes autoregressive processing across hierarchical scales, decoding multiple tokens per scale in parallel. This method achieves high-quality generation while accelerating synthesis. However, parallel token sampling within a scale may lead to structural errors, resulting in suboptimal generated images. To mitigate this, we propose Latent Scale Rejection Sampling (LSRS), a method that progressively refines token maps in the latent scale during inference to enhance VAR models. Our method uses a lightweight scoring model to evaluate multiple candidate token maps sampled at each scale, selecting the high-quality map to guide subsequent scale generation. By prioritizing early scales critical for structural coherence, LSRS effectively mitigates autoregressive error accumulation while maintaining computational efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that LSRS significantly improves VAR's generation quality with minimal additional computational overhead. For the VAR-d30 model, LSRS increases the inference time by merely 1% while reducing its FID score from 1.95 to 1.78. When the inference time is increased by 15%, the FID score can be further reduced to 1.66. LSRS offers an efficient test-time scaling solution for enhancing VAR-based generation.

### The enshittification of online search? Privacy and quality of Google, Bing and Apple in coding advice
**Authors**: Konrad Kollnig

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T13:42:22Z

**Summary**: Even though currently being challenged by ChatGPT and other large-language models (LLMs), Google Search remains one of the primary means for many individuals to find information on the internet. Interestingly, the way that we retrieve information on the web has hardly changed ever since Google was established in 1998, raising concerns as to Google's dominance in search and lack of competition. If the market for search was sufficiently competitive, then we should probably see a steady increase in search quality over time as well as alternative approaches to the Google's approach to search. However, hardly any research has so far looked at search quality, which is a key facet of a competitive market, especially not over time.   In this report, we conducted a relatively large-scale quantitative comparison of search quality of 1,467 search queries relating to coding advice in October 2023. We focus on coding advice because the study of general search quality is difficult, with the aim of learning more about the assessment of search quality and motivating follow-up research into this important topic. We evaluate the search quality of Google Search, Microsoft Bing, and Apple Search, with a special emphasis on Apple Search, a widely used search engine that has never been explored in previous research. For the assessment of search quality, we use two independent metrics of search quality: 1) the number of trackers on the first search result, as a measure of privacy in web search, and 2) the average rank of the first Stack Overflow search result, under the assumption that Stack Overflow gives the best coding advice. Our results suggest that the privacy of search results is higher on Bing than on Google and Apple. Similarly, the quality of coding advice -- as measured by the average rank of Stack Overflow -- was highest on Bing.

### ExOAR: Expert-Guided Object and Activity Recognition from Textual Data
**Authors**: Iris Beerepoot, Vinicius Stein Dani, Xixi Lu

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T13:40:17Z

**Summary**: Object-centric process mining requires structured data, but extracting it from unstructured text remains a challenge. We introduce ExOAR (Expert-Guided Object and Activity Recognition), an interactive method that combines large language models (LLMs) with human verification to identify objects and activities from textual data. ExOAR guides users through consecutive stages in which an LLM generates candidate object types, activities, and object instances based on contextual input, such as a user's profession, and textual data. Users review and refine these suggestions before proceeding to the next stage. Implemented as a practical tool, ExOAR is initially validated through a demonstration and then evaluated with real-world Active Window Tracking data from five users. Our results show that ExOAR can effectively bridge the gap between unstructured textual data and the structured log with clear semantics needed for object-centric process analysis, while it maintains flexibility and human oversight.

### Understanding the correlation between elliptic and triangular flow
**Authors**: Mubarak Alqahtani, Jean-Yves Ollitrault

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T13:40:11Z

**Summary**: The relative correlation between the magnitudes of elliptic flow ($v_2$) and triangular flow ($v_3$) has been accurately measured in nucleus-nucleus collisions at the LHC collider. As a function of the centrality of the collision, it changes sign and varies non-monotonically. We show that this is naturally explained by two combined effects. The first effect is a skewness in initial-state fluctuations, which is quantified by the correlation between the geometry-driven elliptic deformation in the reaction plane and the fluctuation-driven triangularity $\varepsilon_3$. We introduce an intensive measure of this skewness, which is generically of order unity and depends weakly on the system size and centrality. We evaluate its magnitude using Monte Carlo simulations of the initial state, which show that it is sensitive to the nucleon width. The second effect is the fluctuation of impact parameter relative to centrality classifiers used by experiment. The ATLAS collaboration uses two different centrality classifiers, the multiplicity $N_{ch}$ and the transverse energy $E_T$. We fit both sets of results for Pb+Pb collisions up to $\approx 40\%$ centrality with a single parameter, the intensive mixed skewness. Its value inferred from experiment agrees with theoretical expectations.

### A comparison between initialization strategies for the infinite hidden Markov model
**Authors**: Federico P. Cortese, Luca Rossini

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T13:30:04Z

**Summary**: Infinite hidden Markov models provide a flexible framework for modelling time series with structural changes and complex dynamics, without requiring the number of latent states to be specified in advance. This flexibility is achieved through the hierarchical Dirichlet process prior, while efficient Bayesian inference is enabled by the beam sampler, which combines dynamic programming with slice sampling to truncate the infinite state space adaptively. Despite extensive methodological developments, the role of initialization in this framework has received limited attention. This study addresses this gap by systematically evaluating initialization strategies commonly used for finite hidden Markov models and assessing their suitability in the infinite setting. Results from both simulated and real datasets show that distance-based clustering initializations consistently outperform model-based and uniform alternatives, the latter being the most widely adopted in the existing literature.

### "MCP Does Not Stand for Misuse Cryptography Protocol": Uncovering Cryptographic Misuse in Model Context Protocol at Scale
**Authors**: Biwei Yan, Yue Zhang, Minghui Xu, Hao Wu, Yechao Zhang, Kun Li, Guoming Zhang, Xiuzhen Cheng

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T13:25:59Z

**Summary**: The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is rapidly emerging as the middleware for LLM-based applications, offering a standardized interface for tool integration. However, its built-in security mechanisms are minimal: while schemas and declarations prevent malformed requests, MCP provides no guarantees of authenticity or confidentiality, forcing developers to implement cryptography themselves. Such ad hoc practices are historically prone to misuse, and within MCP they threaten sensitive data and services. We present MICRYSCOPE, the first domain-specific framework for detecting cryptographic misuses in MCP implementations. MICRYSCOPE combines three key innovations: a cross-language intermediate representation that normalizes cryptographic APIs across diverse ecosystems, a hybrid dependency analysis that uncovers explicit and implicit function relationships (including insecure runtime compositions orchestrated by LLMs) and a taint-based misuse detector that tracks sensitive data flows and flags violations of established cryptographic rules. Applying MICRYSCOPE to 9,403 MCP servers, we identified 720 with cryptographic logic, of which 19.7% exhibited misuses. These flaws are concentrated in certain markets (e.g., Smithery Registry with 42% insecure servers), languages (Python at 34% misuse rate), and categories (Developer Tools and Data Science & ML accounting for over 50% of all misuses). Case studies reveal real-world consequences, including leaked API keys, insecure DES/ECB tools, and MD5-based authentication bypasses. Our study establishes the first ecosystem-wide view of cryptographic misuse in MCP and provides both tools and insights to strengthen the security foundations of this rapidly growing protocol.

### In-Context Representation Hijacking
**Authors**: Itay Yona, Amir Sarid, Michael Karasik, Yossi Gandelsman

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T13:19:34Z

**Summary**: We introduce \textbf{Doublespeak}, a simple \emph{in-context representation hijacking} attack against large language models (LLMs). The attack works by systematically replacing a harmful keyword (e.g., \textit{bomb}) with a benign token (e.g., \textit{carrot}) across multiple in-context examples, provided a prefix to a harmful request. We demonstrate that this substitution leads to the internal representation of the benign token converging toward that of the harmful one, effectively embedding the harmful semantics under a euphemism. As a result, superficially innocuous prompts (e.g., ``How to build a carrot?'') are internally interpreted as disallowed instructions (e.g., ``How to build a bomb?''), thereby bypassing the model's safety alignment. We use interpretability tools to show that this semantic overwrite emerges layer by layer, with benign meanings in early layers converging into harmful semantics in later ones. Doublespeak is optimization-free, broadly transferable across model families, and achieves strong success rates on closed-source and open-source systems, reaching 74\% ASR on Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct with a single-sentence context override. Our findings highlight a new attack surface in the latent space of LLMs, revealing that current alignment strategies are insufficient and should instead operate at the representation level.

### Deep Unfolding: Recent Developments, Theory, and Design Guidelines
**Authors**: Nir Shlezinger, Santiago Segarra, Yi Zhang, Dvir Avrahami, Zohar Davidov, Tirza Routtenberg, Yonina C. Eldar

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T13:16:35Z

**Summary**: Optimization methods play a central role in signal processing, serving as the mathematical foundation for inference, estimation, and control. While classical iterative optimization algorithms provide interpretability and theoretical guarantees, they often rely on surrogate objectives, require careful hyperparameter tuning, and exhibit substantial computational latency. Conversely, machine learning (ML ) offers powerful data-driven modeling capabilities but lacks the structure, transparency, and efficiency needed for optimization-driven inference. Deep unfolding has recently emerged as a compelling framework that bridges these two paradigms by systematically transforming iterative optimization algorithms into structured, trainable ML architectures. This article provides a tutorial-style overview of deep unfolding, presenting a unified perspective of methodologies for converting optimization solvers into ML models and highlighting their conceptual, theoretical, and practical implications. We review the foundations of optimization for inference and for learning, introduce four representative design paradigms for deep unfolding, and discuss the distinctive training schemes that arise from their iterative nature. Furthermore, we survey recent theoretical advances that establish convergence and generalization guarantees for unfolded optimizers, and provide comparative qualitative and empirical studies illustrating their relative trade-offs in complexity, interpretability, and robustness.

### RoCo: Role-Based LLMs Collaboration for Automatic Heuristic Design
**Authors**: Jiawei Xu, Fengfeng Wei, Weineng Chen

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T13:09:34Z

**Summary**: Automatic Heuristic Design (AHD) has gained traction as a promising solution for solving combinatorial optimization problems (COPs). Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged and become a promising approach to achieving AHD, but current LLM-based AHD research often only considers a single role. This paper proposes RoCo, a novel Multi-Agent Role-Based System, to enhance the diversity and quality of AHD through multi-role collaboration. RoCo coordinates four specialized LLM-guided agents-explorer, exploiter, critic, and integrator-to collaboratively generate high-quality heuristics. The explorer promotes long-term potential through creative, diversity-driven thinking, while the exploiter focuses on short-term improvements via conservative, efficiency-oriented refinements. The critic evaluates the effectiveness of each evolution step and provides targeted feedback and reflection. The integrator synthesizes proposals from the explorer and exploiter, balancing innovation and exploitation to drive overall progress. These agents interact in a structured multi-round process involving feedback, refinement, and elite mutations guided by both short-term and accumulated long-term reflections. We evaluate RoCo on five different COPs under both white-box and black-box settings. Experimental results demonstrate that RoCo achieves superior performance, consistently generating competitive heuristics that outperform existing methods including ReEvo and HSEvo, both in white-box and black-box scenarios. This role-based collaborative paradigm establishes a new standard for robust and high-performing AHD.

### Principled RL for Diffusion LLMs Emerges from a Sequence-Level Perspective
**Authors**: Jingyang Ou, Jiaqi Han, Minkai Xu, Shaoxuan Xu, Jianwen Xie, Stefano Ermon, Yi Wu, Chongxuan Li

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T13:05:32Z

**Summary**: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has proven highly effective for autoregressive language models, but adapting these methods to diffusion large language models (dLLMs) presents fundamental challenges. The core difficulty lies in likelihood approximation: while autoregressive models naturally provide token-level conditional probabilities essential for token-level RL objectives (e.g., GRPO), dLLMs generate sequences through iterative non-autoregressive denoising steps that lack this factorization. To address this fundamental mismatch, we propose ELBO-based Sequence-level Policy Optimization (ESPO), a principled RL framework that treats entire sequence generation as a single action and uses the ELBO as a tractable sequence-level likelihood proxy. Our method incorporates per-token normalization of importance ratios and robust KL-divergence estimation to ensure stable large-scale training. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning, coding, and planning tasks demonstrate that ESPO significantly outperforms token-level baselines, achieving dramatic improvements of 20-40 points on the Countdown task, while maintaining consistent gains on math and coding benchmarks. Our approach establishes sequence-level optimization as a principled and empirically effective paradigm for RL in dLLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/ML-GSAI/ESPO.

### Fully Unsupervised Self-debiasing of Text-to-Image Diffusion Models
**Authors**: Korada Sri Vardhana, Shrikrishna Lolla, Soma Biswas

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T12:46:42Z

**Summary**: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have achieved widespread success due to their ability to generate high-resolution, photorealistic images. These models are trained on large-scale datasets, like LAION-5B, often scraped from the internet. However, since this data contains numerous biases, the models inherently learn and reproduce them, resulting in stereotypical outputs. We introduce SelfDebias, a fully unsupervised test-time debiasing method applicable to any diffusion model that uses a UNet as its noise predictor. SelfDebias identifies semantic clusters in an image encoder's embedding space and uses these clusters to guide the diffusion process during inference, minimizing the KL divergence between the output distribution and the uniform distribution. Unlike supervised approaches, SelfDebias does not require human-annotated datasets or external classifiers trained for each generated concept. Instead, it is designed to automatically identify semantic modes. Extensive experiments show that SelfDebias generalizes across prompts and diffusion model architectures, including both conditional and unconditional models. It not only effectively debiases images along key demographic dimensions while maintaining the visual fidelity of the generated images, but also more abstract concepts for which identifying biases is also challenging.

**Authors**: Chuyue Wang, Jie Feng, Yuxi Wu, Hang Zhang, Zhiguo Fan, Bing Cheng, Wei Lin

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T12:34:47Z

**Summary**: Accurate and reliable search on online healthcare platforms is critical for user safety and service efficacy. Traditional methods, however, often fail to comprehend complex and nuanced user queries, limiting their effectiveness. Large language models (LLMs) present a promising solution, offering powerful semantic understanding to bridge this gap. Despite their potential, deploying LLMs in this high-stakes domain is fraught with challenges, including factual hallucinations, specialized knowledge gaps, and high operational costs. To overcome these barriers, we introduce \textbf{AR-Med}, a novel framework for \textbf{A}utomated \textbf{R}elevance assessment for \textbf{Med}ical search that has been successfully deployed at scale on the Online Medical Delivery Platforms. AR-Med grounds LLM reasoning in verified medical knowledge through a retrieval-augmented approach, ensuring high accuracy and reliability. To enable efficient online service, we design a practical knowledge distillation scheme that compresses large teacher models into compact yet powerful student models. We also introduce LocalQSMed, a multi-expert annotated benchmark developed to guide model iteration and ensure strong alignment between offline and online performance. Extensive experiments show AR-Med achieves an offline accuracy of over 93\%, a 24\% absolute improvement over the original online system, and delivers significant gains in online relevance and user satisfaction. Our work presents a practical and scalable blueprint for developing trustworthy, LLM-powered systems in real-world healthcare applications.

### Clinical-R1: Empowering Large Language Models for Faithful and Comprehensive Reasoning with Clinical Objective Relative Policy Optimization
**Authors**: Boyang Gu, Hongjian Zhou, Bradley Max Segal, Jinge Wu, Zeyu Cao, Hantao Zhong, Lei Clifton, Fenglin Liu, David A. Clifton

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T12:24:00Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown strong reasoning capabilities through large-scale pretraining and post-training reinforcement learning, demonstrated by DeepSeek-R1. However, current post-training methods, such as Grouped Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), mainly reward correctness, which is not aligned with the multi-dimensional objectives required in high-stakes fields such as medicine, where reasoning must also be faithful and comprehensive. We introduce Clinical-Objective Relative Policy Optimization (CRPO), a scalable, multi-objective, verifiable reinforcement learning method designed to align LLM post-training with clinical reasoning principles. CRPO integrates rule-based and verifiable reward signals that jointly optimize accuracy, faithfulness, and comprehensiveness without relying on human annotation. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we train Clinical-R1-3B, a 3B-parameter model for clinical reasoning. The experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that our CRPO substantially improves reasoning on truthfulness and completeness over standard GRPO while maintaining comfortable accuracy enhancements. This framework provides a scalable pathway to align LLM reasoning with clinical objectives, enabling safer and more collaborative AI systems for healthcare while also highlighting the potential of multi-objective, verifiable RL methods in post-training scaling of LLMs for medical domains.

### PosA-VLA: Enhancing Action Generation via Pose-Conditioned Anchor Attention
**Authors**: Ziwen Li, Xin Wang, Hanlue Zhang, Runnan Chen, Runqi Lin, Xiao He, Han Huang, Yandong Guo, Fakhri Karray, Tongliang Liu, Mingming Gong

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T12:14:29Z

**Summary**: The Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated remarkable performance on embodied tasks and shown promising potential for real-world applications. However, current VLAs still struggle to produce consistent and precise target-oriented actions, as they often generate redundant or unstable motions along trajectories, limiting their applicability in time-sensitive scenarios.In this work, we attribute these redundant actions to the spatially uniform perception field of existing VLAs, which causes them to be distracted by target-irrelevant objects, especially in complex environments.To address this issue, we propose an efficient PosA-VLA framework that anchors visual attention via pose-conditioned supervision, consistently guiding the model's perception toward task-relevant regions. The pose-conditioned anchor attention mechanism enables the model to better align instruction semantics with actionable visual cues, thereby improving action generation precision and efficiency. Moreover, our framework adopts a lightweight architecture and requires no auxiliary perception modules (e.g., segmentation or grounding networks), ensuring efficient inference. Extensive experiments verify that our method executes embodied tasks with precise and time-efficient behavior across diverse robotic manipulation benchmarks and shows robust generalization in a variety of challenging environments.

**Authors**: Lingyi Cai, Wenjie Fu, Yuxi Huang, Ruichen Zhang, Yinqiu Liu, Jiawen Kang, Zehui Xiong, Tao Jiang, Dusit Niyato, Xianbin Wang, Shiwen Mao, Xuemin Shen

**Summary**: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown remarkable success in enabling adaptive and data-driven optimization for various applications in wireless networks. However, classical RL suffers from limitations in generalization, learning feedback, interpretability, and sample efficiency in dynamic wireless environments. Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a transformative Artificial Intelligence (AI) paradigm with exceptional capabilities in knowledge generalization, contextual reasoning, and interactive generation, which have demonstrated strong potential to enhance classical RL. This paper serves as a comprehensive tutorial on LLM-enhanced RL for wireless networks. We propose a taxonomy to categorize the roles of LLMs into four critical functions: state perceiver, reward designer, decision-maker, and generator. Then, we review existing studies exploring how each role of LLMs enhances different stages of the RL pipeline. Moreover, we provide a series of case studies to illustrate how to design and apply LLM-enhanced RL in low-altitude economy networking, vehicular networks, and space-air-ground integrated networks. Finally, we conclude with a discussion on potential future directions for LLM-enhanced RL and offer insights into its future development in wireless networks.

### Context-Aware Hierarchical Learning: A Two-Step Paradigm towards Safer LLMs
**Authors**: Tengyun Ma, Jiaqi Yao, Daojing He, Shihao Peng, Yu Li, Shaohui Liu, Zhuotao Tian

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T12:10:21Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for diverse applications. However, their uniform token processing paradigm introduces critical vulnerabilities in instruction handling, particularly when exposed to adversarial scenarios. In this work, we identify and propose a novel class of vulnerabilities, termed Tool-Completion Attack (TCA), which exploits function-calling mechanisms to subvert model behavior. To evaluate LLM robustness against such threats, we introduce the Tool-Completion benchmark, a comprehensive security assessment framework, which reveals that even state-of-the-art models remain susceptible to TCA, with surprisingly high attack success rates. To address these vulnerabilities, we introduce Context-Aware Hierarchical Learning (CAHL), a sophisticated mechanism that dynamically balances semantic comprehension with role-specific instruction constraints. CAHL leverages the contextual correlations between different instruction segments to establish a robust, context-aware instruction hierarchy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CAHL significantly enhances LLM robustness against both conventional attacks and the proposed TCA, exhibiting strong generalization capabilities in zero-shot evaluations while still preserving model performance on generic tasks. Our code is available at https://github.com/S2AILab/CAHL.

### The broad-lined Type Ic supernova 2020lao reveals an energetic explosion with no central-engine signatures
**Authors**: M. D. Stritzinger, T. J. Moriya, S. Bose, P. A. Mazzali, P. Lundqvist, E. Karamehmetoglu, L. S. Arndt, C. Ashall, L. Galbany, W. B. Hoogendam, E. Baron, J. M. DerKacy, N. Elias-Rosa, E. Y. Hsiao, P. Höflich, E. Pian, E. A. M. Jensen, S. Moran, A. Pastorello, M. Shahbandeh, G. Valerin

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T12:05:51Z

**Summary**: We present early-time observations of the broad-lined Type Ic supernova SN 2020lao, including optical spectroscopy beginning about 48 hr after the inferred explosion and extending to about 100 days. The explosion epoch is constrained with power-law fits to the rising TESS and ZTF light curves, with the first ZTF detection only about 27 hr after explosion. The optical light curves show a rapid 8.8 day rise and a peak luminosity typical of SNe Ic-BL (Mr=-18.5 mag). Unlike some engine-driven events, SN 2020lao shows no early optical excess or afterglow. The lack of a shock-cooling signature in the TESS/ZTF data constrains the progenitor to a compact Wolf Rayet-like star with radius of only a few solar radii. The spectra resemble those of the X-ray flash SN 2006aj but with higher velocities. Arnett modeling of the bolometric light curve, combined with Fe II velocities, yields a nickel mass of about 0.2 solar masses, an ejecta mass of about 3.2 solar masses, and a kinetic energy of about 23x10^51 erg, corresponding to a high specific kinetic energy of about 7x10^51 erg per solar mass. Spectral-synthesis modeling broadly reproduces the photospheric spectra and suggests a somewhat lower but still large specific kinetic energy (about 5 x 10^51 erg per solar mass). Although SN 2020lao and SN 2006aj produced similar 56Ni masses, SN 2020lao exhibits specific kinetic energies larger by a factor of several. Published VLA and Swift/XRT non-detections show no radio or X-ray afterglow, placing strong limits on relativistic ejecta and dense circumstellar material. Given its high specific kinetic energy, the absence of early excess emission and the radio/X-ray non-detections imply that any jet was either far off-axis or choked; otherwise, SN 2020lao represents an extreme non-relativistic SN Ic-BL.

### A theory-agnostic hierarchical Bayesian framework for black-hole spectroscopy: a case study on GW250114 in Einstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet gravity
**Authors**: Shitong Guo, Yan-Gang Miao

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T12:02:25Z

**Summary**: Black-hole spectroscopy has emerged as a powerful probe of strong-field gravity in the era of gravitational-wave astronomy. In this context, many current tests of modified or extended gravity are implemented by searching for predicted signatures modeled as perturbative corrections to general-relativistic waveforms; however, this approach may introduce model-dependent systematics and limit applicability to broader classes of theories. To complement such methods, we develop a theory-agnostic hierarchical Bayesian framework that connects ringdown observations -- modeled as damped sinusoids -- directly with theoretical quasinormal mode spectra, performing the comparison at the spectral level rather than through theory-specific waveform matching. The framework incorporates a soft-truncation module to account for the finite domain of validity in the theory's parameter space and is equipped with quantitative diagnostics that identify stable analysis time windows. As an illustrative application, we implement the framework within Einstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet gravity and apply it to the gravitational-wave event GW250114, finding that the resulting posterior for the dimensionless coupling $ζ$ is robust against prior assumptions yet remains only weakly informative over the range considered in this work. We further perform controlled ringdown injection studies across different values of $ζ$, confirming that nonzero couplings can be recovered while also indicating a potential systematic effect: Kerr-based priors in the $ζ$ inference may partially absorb spectral deviations arising in alternative theories of gravity. This work establishes a transparent and extensible foundation for future strong-field gravity tests, naturally compatible with the growing precision and modal resolution of next-generation gravitational-wave detectors.

### Test-time Correction: An Online 3D Detection System via Visual Prompting
**Authors**: Hanxue Zhang, Zetong Yang, Yanan Sun, Li Chen, Fei Xia, Fatma Güney, Hongyang Li

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T11:47:50Z

**Summary**: This paper introduces Test-time Correction (TTC), an online 3D detection system designed to rectify test-time errors using various auxiliary feedback, aiming to enhance the safety of deployed autonomous driving systems. Unlike conventional offline 3D detectors that remain fixed during inference, TTC enables immediate online error correction without retraining, allowing autonomous vehicles to adapt to new scenarios and reduce deployment risks. To achieve this, we equip existing 3D detectors with an Online Adapter (OA) module -- a prompt-driven query generator for real-time correction. At the core of OA module are visual prompts: image-based descriptions of objects of interest derived from auxiliary feedback such as mismatches with 2D detections, road descriptions, or user clicks. These visual prompts, collected from risky objects during inference, are maintained in a visual prompt buffer to enable continuous correction in future frames. By leveraging this mechanism, TTC consistently detects risky objects, achieving reliable, adaptive, and versatile driving autonomy. Extensive experiments show that TTC significantly improves instant error rectification over frozen 3D detectors, even under limited labels, zero-shot settings, and adverse conditions. We hope this work inspires future research on post-deployment online rectification systems for autonomous driving.

### SRPG: Semantically Reconstructed Privacy Guard for Zero-Trust Privacy in Educational Multi-Agent Systems
**Authors**: Shuang Guo, Zihui Li

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T11:36:33Z

**Summary**: Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) with large language models (LLMs) enable personalized education but risk leaking minors personally identifiable information (PII) via unstructured dialogue. Existing privacy methods struggle to balance security and utility: role-based access control fails on unstructured text, while naive masking destroys pedagogical context. We propose SRPG, a privacy guard for educational MAS, using a Dual-Stream Reconstruction Mechanism: a strict sanitization stream ensures zero PII leakage, and a context reconstruction stream (LLM driven) recovers mathematical logic. This decouples instructional content from private data, preserving teaching efficacy. Tests on MathDial show SRPG works across models; with GPT-4o, it achieves 0.0000 Attack Success Rate (ASR) (zero leakage) and 0.8267 Exact Match, far outperforming the zero trust Pure LLM baseline (0.2138). SRPG effectively protects minors privacy without sacrificing mathematical instructional quality.

### A Group Fairness Lens for Large Language Models
**Authors**: Guanqun Bi, Yuqiang Xie, Lei Shen, Yanan Cao

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T11:34:57Z

**Summary**: The need to assess LLMs for bias and fairness is critical, with current evaluations often being narrow, missing a broad categorical view. In this paper, we propose evaluating the bias and fairness of LLMs from a group fairness lens using a novel hierarchical schema characterizing diverse social groups. Specifically, we construct a dataset, GFAIR, encapsulating target-attribute combinations across multiple dimensions. Moreover, we introduce statement organization, a new open-ended text generation task, to uncover complex biases in LLMs. Extensive evaluations of popular LLMs reveal inherent safety concerns. To mitigate the biases of LLMs from a group fairness perspective, we pioneer a novel chainof-thought method GF-THINK to mitigate biases of LLMs from a group fairness perspective. Experimental results demonstrate its efficacy in mitigating bias and achieving fairness in LLMs. Our dataset and codes are available at https://github.com/surika/Group-Fairness-LLMs.

### GaussianBlender: Instant Stylization of 3D Gaussians with Disentangled Latent Spaces
**Authors**: Melis Ocal, Xiaoyan Xing, Yue Li, Ngo Anh Vien, Sezer Karaoglu, Theo Gevers

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T11:23:07Z

**Summary**: 3D stylization is central to game development, virtual reality, and digital arts, where the demand for diverse assets calls for scalable methods that support fast, high-fidelity manipulation. Existing text-to-3D stylization methods typically distill from 2D image editors, requiring time-intensive per-asset optimization and exhibiting multi-view inconsistency due to the limitations of current text-to-image models, which makes them impractical for large-scale production. In this paper, we introduce GaussianBlender, a pioneering feed-forward framework for text-driven 3D stylization that performs edits instantly at inference. Our method learns structured, disentangled latent spaces with controlled information sharing for geometry and appearance from spatially-grouped 3D Gaussians. A latent diffusion model then applies text-conditioned edits on these learned representations. Comprehensive evaluations show that GaussianBlender not only delivers instant, high-fidelity, geometry-preserving, multi-view consistent stylization, but also surpasses methods that require per-instance test-time optimization - unlocking practical, democratized 3D stylization at scale.

### Knowing oneself with and through AI: From self-tracking to chatbots
**Authors**: Lucy Osler

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T11:22:31Z

**Summary**: This chapter examines how algorithms and artificial intelligence are transforming our practices of self-knowledge, self-understanding, and self-narration. Drawing on frameworks from distributed cognition, I analyse three key domains where AI shapes how and what we come to know about ourselves: self-tracking applications, technologically-distributed autobiographical memories, and narrative co-construction with Large Language Models (LLMs). While self-tracking devices promise enhanced self-knowledge through quantified data, they also impose particular frameworks that can crowd out other forms of self-understanding and promote self-optimization. Digital technologies increasingly serve as repositories for our autobiographical memories and self-narratives, offering benefits such as detailed record-keeping and scaffolding during difficult periods, but also creating vulnerabilities to algorithmic manipulation. Finally, conversational AI introduces new possibilities for interactive narrative construction that mimics interpersonal dialogue. While LLMs can provide valuable support for self-exploration, they also present risks of narrative deference and the construction of self-narratives that are detached from reality.

### Investigating Bias: A Multilingual Pipeline for Generating, Solving, and Evaluating Math Problems with LLMs
**Authors**: Mariam Mahran, Katharina Simbeck

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T11:16:26Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for educational support, yet their response quality varies depending on the language of interaction. This paper presents an automated multilingual pipeline for generating, solving, and evaluating math problems aligned with the German K-10 curriculum. We generated 628 math exercises and translated them into English, German, and Arabic. Three commercial LLMs (GPT-4o-mini, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Qwen-plus) were prompted to produce step-by-step solutions in each language. A held-out panel of LLM judges, including Claude 3.5 Haiku, evaluated solution quality using a comparative framework. Results show a consistent gap, with English solutions consistently rated highest, and Arabic often ranked lower. These findings highlight persistent linguistic bias and the need for more equitable multilingual AI systems in education.

**Summary**: Context: Photometric variability is a defining characteristic of young stellar objects (YSO), which can be traced back to a range of physical processes taking place at different stages of young stars' formation and early evolution. Gaia's third Data Release (GDR3) has provided an unprecedented dataset of photometric time series, including 79375 light curves for YSO candidates. With its all-sky coverage, Gaia provides a unique opportunity for large-scale studies of YSO variability. Aims: Our goal was to characterise the GDR3 sample of YSO variables further and verify the recurrence of YSO variability modes due to accretion, extinction, rotation modulation, etc. By adapting the Q&M methodology for Gaia's sparse and long-term light curves, we seek to bridge the gap between low and high-cadence surveys' insights on YSO variability. Methods: We piloted the application of the asymmetry (M) and periodicity (Q) variability metrics to characterise YSO variability with Gaia light curves. Through refined sample selection, we identified sources with appropriate sampling for the Q&M methodology. We used the Generalised Lomb Scargle periodogram and structure functions to infer variability timescales. Results: We successfully derived Q&M indices for ~23000 sources in the GDR3 YSO sample. These variables were then classified into eight variability morphological classes. We linked morphological classes with physical mechanisms by using H$α$ as a proxy of accretion and $α_\mathrm{IR}$-indices to gauge circumstellar material's presence. Conclusions: We demonstrate that the Q&M metrics can be successfully applied to Gaia's sparse time-series. We applied them to distinguish between the several variability modes. While our results are generally consistent with previous high-cadence, short-term studies, we find that GDR3's long timespan yields an enhanced variety of variability mechanisms.

### Different types of syntactic agreement recruit the same units within large language models
**Authors**: Daria Kryvosheieva, Andrea de Varda, Evelina Fedorenko, Greta Tuckute

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T11:07:50Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) can reliably distinguish grammatical from ungrammatical sentences, but how grammatical knowledge is represented within the models remains an open question. We investigate whether different syntactic phenomena recruit shared or distinct components in LLMs. Using a functional localization approach inspired by cognitive neuroscience, we identify the LLM units most responsive to 67 English syntactic phenomena in seven open-weight models. These units are consistently recruited across sentences containing the phenomena and causally support the models' syntactic performance. Critically, different types of syntactic agreement (e.g., subject-verb, anaphor, determiner-noun) recruit overlapping sets of units, suggesting that agreement constitutes a meaningful functional category for LLMs. This pattern holds in English, Russian, and Chinese; and further, in a cross-lingual analysis of 57 diverse languages, structurally more similar languages share more units for subject-verb agreement. Taken together, these findings reveal that syntactic agreement-a critical marker of syntactic dependencies-constitutes a meaningful category within LLMs' representational spaces.

### ConvRot: Rotation-Based Plug-and-Play 4-bit Quantization for Diffusion Transformers
**Authors**: Feice Huang, Zuliang Han, Xing Zhou, Yihuang Chen, Lifei Zhu, Haoqian Wang

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T11:02:16Z

**Summary**: Diffusion transformers have demonstrated strong capabilities in generating high-quality images. However, as model size increases, the growing memory footprint and inference latency pose significant challenges for practical deployment. Recent studies in large language models (LLMs) show that rotation-based techniques can smooth outliers and enable 4-bit quantization, but these approaches often incur substantial overhead and struggle with row-wise outliers in diffusion transformers. To address these challenges, we propose ConvRot, a group-wise rotation-based quantization method that leverages regular Hadamard transform (RHT) to suppress both row-wise and column-wise outliers while reducing complexity from quadratic to linear. Building on this, we design ConvLinear4bit, a plug-and-play module that integrates rotation, quantization, GEMM, and dequantization, enabling W4A4 inference without retraining and preserving visual quality. Experiments on FLUX.1-dev demonstrate a 2.26$\times$ speedup and 4.05$\times$ memory reduction while maintaining image fidelity. To our knowledge, this is the first application of rotation-based quantization for plug-and-play W4A4 inference in diffusion transformers.

### Augmenting a pure and hybrid vertical equilibrium scheme via data-driven surrogate modelling
**Authors**: Ivan Buntic, Bernd Flemisch

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T11:01:43Z

**Summary**: Vertical equilibrium (VE) models have been introduced as computationally efficient alternatives to traditional mass and momentum balance equations for fluid flow in porous media. Since VE models are only accurate in regions where phase equilibrium holds, while traditional simulations are computationally demanding, hybrid methods have been proposed to combine the accuracy of the full-dimensional approach with the efficiency of VE model. However, coupling both models introduces computational overhead that can make hybrid simulations slower than fully traditional ones. To address this, we introduce data-driven surrogates to predict the gas plume distance and coarse-level mobilities in the VE model, as well as predictors to accelerate the coupling scheme. We focus on surrogate models with short inference times to minimize computational overhead during frequent function calls. The proposed approach preserves key physical properties, such as mass conservation, while substantially reducing simulation runtimes. Overall, combining data-driven methods with the hybrid VE scheme yields an enhanced model that outperforms traditional simulations in speed while introducing only negligible errors.

### Evaluating Hydro-Science and Engineering Knowledge of Large Language Models

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T11:01:40Z

**Summary**: Hydro-Science and Engineering (Hydro-SE) is a critical and irreplaceable domain that secures human water supply, generates clean hydropower energy, and mitigates flood and drought disasters. Featuring multiple engineering objectives, Hydro-SE is an inherently interdisciplinary domain that integrates scientific knowledge with engineering expertise. This integration necessitates extensive expert collaboration in decision-making, which poses difficulties for intelligence. With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), their potential application in the Hydro-SE domain is being increasingly explored. However, the knowledge and application abilities of LLMs in Hydro-SE have not been sufficiently evaluated. To address this issue, we propose the Hydro-SE LLM evaluation benchmark (Hydro-SE Bench), which contains 4,000 multiple-choice questions. Hydro-SE Bench covers nine subfields and enables evaluation of LLMs in aspects of basic conceptual knowledge, engineering application ability, and reasoning and calculation ability. The evaluation results on Hydro-SE Bench show that the accuracy values vary among 0.74 to 0.80 for commercial LLMs, and among 0.41 to 0.68 for small-parameter LLMs. While LLMs perform well in subfields closely related to natural and physical sciences, they struggle with domain-specific knowledge such as industry standards and hydraulic structures. Model scaling mainly improves reasoning and calculation abilities, but there is still great potential for LLMs to better handle problems in practical engineering application. This study highlights the strengths and weaknesses of LLMs for Hydro-SE tasks, providing model developers with clear training targets and Hydro-SE researchers with practical guidance for applying LLMs.

### Towards Privacy-Preserving Range Queries with Secure Learned Spatial Index over Encrypted Data
**Authors**: Zuan Wang, Juntao Lu, Jiazhuang Wu, Youliang Tian, Wei Song, Qiuxian Li, Duo Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T10:59:40Z

**Summary**: With the growing reliance on cloud services for large-scale data management, preserving the security and privacy of outsourced datasets has become increasingly critical. While encrypting data and queries can prevent direct content exposure, recent research reveals that adversaries can still infer sensitive information via access pattern and search path analysis. However, existing solutions that offer strong access pattern privacy often incur substantial performance overhead. In this paper, we propose a novel privacy-preserving range query scheme over encrypted datasets, offering strong security guarantees while maintaining high efficiency. To achieve this, we develop secure learned spatial index (SLS-INDEX), a secure learned index that integrates the Paillier cryptosystem with a hierarchical prediction architecture and noise-injected buckets, enabling data-aware query acceleration in the encrypted domain. To further obfuscate query execution paths, SLS-INDEXbased Range Queries (SLRQ) employs a permutation-based secure bucket prediction protocol. Additionally, we introduce a secure point extraction protocol that generates candidate results to reduce the overhead of secure computation. We provide formal security analysis under realistic leakage functions and implement a prototype to evaluate its practical performance. Extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that SLRQ significantly outperforms existing solutions in query efficiency while ensuring dataset, query, result, and access pattern privacy.

### PipeFusion: Patch-level Pipeline Parallelism for Diffusion Transformers Inference
**Authors**: Jiarui Fang, Jinzhe Pan, Aoyu Li, Xibo Sun, Jiannan Wang

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T10:59:23Z

**Summary**: This paper presents PipeFusion, an innovative parallel methodology to tackle the high latency issues associated with generating high-resolution images using diffusion transformers (DiTs) models. PipeFusion partitions images into patches and the model layers across multiple GPUs. It employs a patch-level pipeline parallel strategy to orchestrate communication and computation efficiently. By capitalizing on the high similarity between inputs from successive diffusion steps, PipeFusion reuses one-step stale feature maps to provide context for the current pipeline step. This approach notably reduces communication costs compared to existing DiTs inference parallelism, including tensor parallel, sequence parallel and DistriFusion. PipeFusion enhances memory efficiency through parameter distribution across devices, ideal for large DiTs like Flux.1. Experimental results demonstrate that PipeFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance on 8$\times$L40 PCIe GPUs for Pixart, Stable-Diffusion 3, and Flux.1 models.

### ToG-Bench: Task-Oriented Spatio-Temporal Grounding in Egocentric Videos
**Authors**: Qi'ao Xu, Tianwen Qian, Yuqian Fu, Kailing Li, Yang Jiao, Jiacheng Zhang, Xiaoling Wang, Liang He

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T10:54:44Z

**Summary**: A core capability towards general embodied intelligence lies in localizing task-relevant objects from an egocentric perspective, formulated as Spatio-Temporal Video Grounding (STVG). Despite recent progress, existing STVG studies remain largely confined to object-centric and descriptive instructions, neglecting the task-oriented reasoning that is crucial for embodied agents to accomplish goal-directed interactions. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{ToG-Bench}, the first task-oriented spatio-temporal video grounding benchmark for egocentric videos. ToG-Bench is characterized by three key features: (1) \textbf{Task-oriented Grounding}, which requires identifying and localizing objects based on intended tasks rather than straightforward descriptions; (2) \textbf{Explicit-Implicit Dual Grounding}, where target objects can be either explicitly mentioned or implicitly inferred by contextual reasoning; (3) \textbf{One-to-Many Grounding}, where a single instruction may correspond to multiple objects involved in task execution. Built upon videos sourced from ScanNet, ToG-Bench comprises 100 annotated clips with 2,704 task-oriented grounding instructions, constructed via a semi-automated pipeline that combines foundation model annotation and human refinement. In addition, we introduce a set of task-level evaluation metrics tailored for multi-object and explicit-implicit object grounding, and systematically benchmark seven state-of-the-art MLLMs. Extensive experiments reveal the intrinsic challenges of task-oriented STVG and substantial performance gaps across explicit-implicit and multi-object grounding, highlighting the difficulty of bridging perception and interaction in embodied scenarios. Data and code will be released at: \href{https://github.com/qaxuDev/ToG-Bench}{https://github.com/qaxuDev/ToG-Bench}..

### Transductive Conformal Inference for Full Ranking
**Authors**: Jean-Baptiste Fermanian, Pierre Humbert, Gilles Blanchard

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T10:49:47Z

**Summary**: We introduce a method based on Conformal Prediction (CP) to quantify the uncertainty of full ranking algorithms. We focus on a specific scenario where $n+m$ items are to be ranked by some ``black box'' algorithm. It is assumed that the relative (ground truth) ranking of $n$ of them is known. The objective is then to quantify the error made by the algorithm on the ranks of the $m$ new items among the total $(n+m)$. In such a setting, the true ranks of the $n$ original items in the total $(n+m)$ depend on the (unknown) true ranks of the $m$ new ones. Consequently, we have no direct access to a calibration set to apply a classical CP method. To address this challenge, we propose to construct distribution-free bounds of the unknown conformity scores using recent results on the distribution of conformal p-values. Using these scores upper bounds, we provide valid prediction sets for the rank of any item. We also control the false coverage proportion, a crucial quantity when dealing with multiple prediction sets. Finally, we empirically show on both synthetic and real data the efficiency of our CP method for state-of-the-art algorithms such as RankNet or LambdaMart.

### MambaScope: Coarse-to-Fine Scoping for Efficient Vision Mamba
**Authors**: Shanhui Liu, Rui Xu, Yunke Wang

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T10:45:29Z

**Summary**: Vision Mamba has emerged as a promising and efficient alternative to Vision Transformers, yet its efficiency remains fundamentally constrained by the number of input tokens. Existing token reduction approaches typically adopt token pruning or merging to reduce computation. However, they inherently lead to information loss as they discard or compress token representations. This problem is further exacerbated when the same fine-grained token processing is uniformly applied across all images regardless of visual complexity. We observe that not all inputs require fine-grained processing: simple images can be effectively handled at a coarse resolution, while only complex ones require refinement. Based on this insight, we propose MambaScope, an adaptive framework for efficient inference for Vision Mamba. MambaScope first performs coarse-grained inference by dividing the input image into large patches, significantly reducing token length and computation. When the model's prediction confidence is low, selected regions are re-processed at a finer resolution to recover essential visual details with minimal additional cost. This dynamic resolution assignment strategy allows MambaScope to allocate computation adaptively according to image complexity, achieving efficient processing without compromising accuracy. Experiments across various vision tasks demonstrate that MambaScope outperforms both the baseline Vision Mamba and state-of-the-art token reduction techniques in terms of accuracy and efficiency.

### FFTrainer: Fast Failover in Large-Language Model Training with Almost-Free State Management
**Authors**: Bohan Zhao, Yuanhong Wang, Chenglin Liu, Jiagi Pan, Guang Yang, Ruitao Liu, Tingrui Zhang, Kai Luo, Wei Xu

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T10:27:35Z

**Summary**: Recent developments in large language models (LLMs) have introduced new requirements for efficient and robust training. As LLM clusters scale, node failures, lengthy recoveries, and bulky checkpoints erode efficiency. Infrequent asynchronous checkpoints trigger costly rollbacks, yet higher frequencies add prohibitive overhead. To address these challenges, we propose FFTrainer, a system designed for robust LLM training. FFTrainer leverages surplus network capacity to quickly save and load states, thereby preventing rollbacks and accelerating recovery. Compared with prior checkpointing approaches, FFTrainer reduces recovery time by up to 98% and mitigates GPU utilization loss by up to 68% without hindering normal training.

### SwarmDiffusion: End-To-End Traversability-Guided Diffusion for Embodiment-Agnostic Navigation of Heterogeneous Robots

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T10:13:20Z

**Summary**: Visual traversability estimation is critical for autonomous navigation, but existing VLM-based methods rely on hand-crafted prompts, generalize poorly across embodiments, and output only traversability maps, leaving trajectory generation to slow external planners. We propose SwarmDiffusion, a lightweight end-to-end diffusion model that jointly predicts traversability and generates a feasible trajectory from a single RGB image. To remove the need for annotated or planner-produced paths, we introduce a planner-free trajectory construction pipeline based on randomized waypoint sampling, Bezier smoothing, and regularization enforcing connectivity, safety, directionality, and path thinness. This enables learning stable motion priors without demonstrations. SwarmDiffusion leverages VLM-derived supervision without prompt engineering and conditions the diffusion process on a compact embodiment state, producing physically consistent, traversable paths that transfer across different robot platforms. Across indoor environments and two embodiments (quadruped and aerial), the method achieves 80-100% navigation success and 0.09s inference, and adapts to a new robot using only-500 additional visual samples. It generalizes reliably to unseen environments in simulation and real-world trials, offering a scalable, prompt-free approach to unified traversability reasoning and trajectory generation.

### Jupiter: Enhancing LLM Data Analysis Capabilities via Notebook and Inference-Time Value-Guided Search
**Authors**: Shuocheng Li, Yihao Liu, Silin Du, Wenxuan Zeng, Zhe Xu, Mengyu Zhou, Yeye He, Haoyu Dong, Shi Han, Dongmei Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T09:56:47Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have shown great promise in automating data science workflows, but existing models still struggle with multi-step reasoning and tool use, which limits their effectiveness on complex data analysis tasks. To address this, we propose a scalable pipeline that extracts high-quality, tool-based data analysis tasks and their executable multi-step solutions from real-world Jupyter notebooks and associated data files. Using this pipeline, we introduce NbQA, a large-scale dataset of standardized task-solution pairs that reflect authentic tool-use patterns in practical data science scenarios. To further enhance multi-step reasoning, we present Jupiter, a framework that formulates data analysis as a search problem and applies Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to generate diverse solution trajectories for value model learning. During inference, Jupiter combines the value model and node visit counts to efficiently collect executable multi-step plans with minimal search steps. Experimental results show that Qwen2.5-7B and 14B-Instruct models on NbQA solve 77.82% and 86.38% of tasks on InfiAgent-DABench, respectively-matching or surpassing GPT-4o and advanced agent frameworks. Further evaluations demonstrate improved generalization and stronger tool-use reasoning across diverse multi-step reasoning tasks.

### SELF: A Robust Singular Value and Eigenvalue Approach for LLM Fingerprinting
**Authors**: Hanxiu Zhang, Yue Zheng

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T09:53:47Z

**Summary**: The protection of Intellectual Property (IP) in Large Language Models (LLMs) represents a critical challenge in contemporary AI research. While fingerprinting techniques have emerged as a fundamental mechanism for detecting unauthorized model usage, existing methods -- whether behavior-based or structural -- suffer from vulnerabilities such as false claim attacks or susceptible to weight manipulations. To overcome these limitations, we propose SELF, a novel intrinsic weight-based fingerprinting scheme that eliminates dependency on input and inherently resists false claims. SELF achieves robust IP protection through two key innovations: 1) unique, scalable and transformation-invariant fingerprint extraction via singular value and eigenvalue decomposition of LLM attention weights, and 2) effective neural network-based fingerprint similarity comparison based on few-shot learning and data augmentation. Experimental results demonstrate SELF maintains high IP infringement detection accuracy while showing strong robustness against various downstream modifications, including quantization, pruning, and fine-tuning attacks. Our code is available at https://github.com/HanxiuZhang/SELF_v2.

### LAMP: Language-Assisted Motion Planning for Controllable Video Generation
**Authors**: Muhammed Burak Kizil, Enes Sanli, Niloy J. Mitra, Erkut Erdem, Aykut Erdem, Duygu Ceylan

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T09:51:13Z

**Summary**: Video generation has achieved remarkable progress in visual fidelity and controllability, enabling conditioning on text, layout, or motion. Among these, motion control - specifying object dynamics and camera trajectories - is essential for composing complex, cinematic scenes, yet existing interfaces remain limited. We introduce LAMP that leverages large language models (LLMs) as motion planners to translate natural language descriptions into explicit 3D trajectories for dynamic objects and (relatively defined) cameras. LAMP defines a motion domain-specific language (DSL), inspired by cinematography conventions. By harnessing program synthesis capabilities of LLMs, LAMP generates structured motion programs from natural language, which are deterministically mapped to 3D trajectories. We construct a large-scale procedural dataset pairing natural text descriptions with corresponding motion programs and 3D trajectories. Experiments demonstrate LAMP's improved performance in motion controllability and alignment with user intent compared to state-of-the-art alternatives establishing the first framework for generating both object and camera motions directly from natural language specifications.

### KVNAND: Efficient On-Device Large Language Model Inference Using DRAM-Free In-Flash Computing
**Authors**: Lishuo Deng, Shaojie Xu, Jinwu Chen, Changwei Yan, Jiajie Wang, Zhe Jiang, Weiwei Shan

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T09:41:03Z

**Summary**: Deploying large language models (LLMs) on edge devices enables personalized agents with strong privacy and low cost. However, with tens to hundreds of billions of parameters, single-batch autoregressive inference suffers from extremely low arithmetic intensity, creating severe weight-loading and bandwidth pressures on resource-constrained platforms. Recent in-flash computing (IFC) solutions alleviate this bottleneck by co-locating weight-related linear computations in the decode phase with flash, yet still rely on DRAM for the key-value (KV) cache. As context length grows, the KV cache can exceed model weights in size, imposing prohibitive DRAM cost and capacity requirements. Attempts to offload KV cache to flash suffer from severe performance penalties.   We propose KVNAND, the first DRAM-free, IFC-based architecture that stores both model weights and KV cache entirely in compute-enabled 3D NAND flash. KVNAND addresses the fundamental performance challenges of flash under intensive KV cache access by leveraging IFC for all memory-bound operations to reduce data transfer overhead, introducing head-group parallelism to boost throughput, and employing page-level KV cache mapping to align token access patterns with flash organization. In addition, we propose a design space exploration framework that evaluates discrete and compact KVNAND variants to balance weight and KV placement, automatically identifying the optimal design trade-off. These techniques mitigate latency, energy, and reliability concerns, turning flash into a practical medium for long-context KV storage. Evaluations on MHA 7B and GQA 70B LLMs show that KVNAND achieves 1.98\(\times\)/1.94\(\times\)/2.05\(\times\) geomean speedup at 128/1K/10K-token contexts compared to DRAM-equipped IFC designs and addresses out-of-memory failures at 100K context length.

### DeepRule: An Integrated Framework for Automated Business Rule Generation via Deep Predictive Modeling and Hybrid Search Optimization
**Authors**: Yusen Wu, Xiaotie Deng

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T09:40:33Z

**Summary**: This paper proposes DeepRule, an integrated framework for automated business rule generation in retail assortment and pricing optimization. Addressing the systematic misalignment between existing theoretical models and real-world economic complexities, we identify three critical gaps: (1) data modality mismatch where unstructured textual sources (e.g. negotiation records, approval documents) impede accurate customer profiling; (2) dynamic feature entanglement challenges in modeling nonlinear price elasticity and time-varying attributes; (3) operational infeasibility caused by multi-tier business constraints.   Our framework introduces a tri-level architecture for above challenges. We design a hybrid knowledge fusion engine employing large language models (LLMs) for deep semantic parsing of unstructured text, transforming distributor agreements and sales assessments into structured features while integrating managerial expertise. Then a game-theoretic constrained optimization mechanism is employed to dynamically reconcile supply chain interests through bilateral utility functions, encoding manufacturer-distributor profit redistribution as endogenous objectives under hierarchical constraints. Finally an interpretable decision distillation interface leveraging LLM-guided symbolic regression to find and optimize pricing strategies and auditable business rules embeds economic priors (e.g. non-negative elasticity) as hard constraints during mathematical expression search. We validate the framework in real retail environments achieving higher profits versus systematic B2C baselines while ensuring operational feasibility. This establishes a close-loop pipeline unifying unstructured knowledge injection, multi-agent optimization, and interpretable strategy synthesis for real economic intelligence.

### Observation-driven correction of numerical weather prediction for marine winds
**Authors**: Matteo Peduto, Qidong Yang, Jonathan Giezendanner, Devis Tuia, Sherrie Wang

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T09:39:44Z

**Summary**: Accurate marine wind forecasts are essential for safe navigation, ship routing, and energy operations, yet they remain challenging because observations over the ocean are sparse, heterogeneous, and temporally variable. We reformulate wind forecasting as observation-informed correction of a global numerical weather prediction (NWP) model. Rather than forecasting winds directly, we learn local correction patterns by assimilating the latest in-situ observations to adjust the Global Forecast System (GFS) output. We propose a transformer-based deep learning architecture that (i) handles irregular and time-varying observation sets through masking and set-based attention mechanisms, (ii) conditions predictions on recent observation-forecast pairs via cross-attention, and (iii) employs cyclical time embeddings and coordinate-aware location representations to enable single-pass inference at arbitrary spatial coordinates. We evaluate our model over the Atlantic Ocean using observations from the International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set (ICOADS) as reference. The model reduces GFS 10-meter wind RMSE at all lead times up to 48 hours, achieving 45% improvement at 1-hour lead time and 13% improvement at 48-hour lead time. Spatial analyses reveal the most persistent improvements along coastlines and shipping routes, where observations are most abundant. The tokenized architecture naturally accommodates heterogeneous observing platforms (ships, buoys, tide gauges, and coastal stations) and produces both site-specific predictions and basin-scale gridded products in a single forward pass. These results demonstrate a practical, low-latency post-processing approach that complements NWP by learning to correct systematic forecast errors.

### Memory-Guided Point Cloud Completion for Dental Reconstruction
**Authors**: Jianan Sun, Yukang Huang, Dongzhihan Wang, Mingyu Fan

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T09:31:07Z

**Summary**: Partial dental point clouds often suffer from large missing regions caused by occlusion and limited scanning views, which bias encoder-only global features and force decoders to hallucinate structures. We propose a retrieval-augmented framework for tooth completion that integrates a prototype memory into standard encoder--decoder pipelines. After encoding a partial input into a global descriptor, the model retrieves the nearest manifold prototype from a learnable memory and fuses it with the query feature through confidence-gated weighting before decoding. The memory is optimized end-to-end and self-organizes into reusable tooth-shape prototypes without requiring tooth-position labels, thereby providing structural priors that stabilize missing-region inference and free decoder capacity for detail recovery. The module is plug-and-play and compatible with common completion backbones, while keeping the same training losses. Experiments on a self-processed Teeth3DS benchmark demonstrate consistent improvements in Chamfer Distance, with visualizations showing sharper cusps, ridges, and interproximal transitions. Our approach provides a simple yet effective way to exploit cross-sample regularities for more accurate and faithful dental point-cloud completion.

### No-Regret Gaussian Process Optimization of Time-Varying Functions
**Authors**: Eliabelle Mauduit, Eloïse Berthier, Andrea Simonetto

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T09:28:08Z

**Summary**: Sequential optimization of black-box functions from noisy evaluations has been widely studied, with Gaussian Process bandit algorithms such as GP-UCB guaranteeing no-regret in stationary settings. However, for time-varying objectives, it is known that no-regret is unattainable under pure bandit feedback unless strong and often unrealistic assumptions are imposed.   In this article, we propose a novel method to optimize time-varying rewards in the frequentist setting, where the objective has bounded RKHS norm. Time variations are captured through uncertainty injection (UI), which enables heteroscedastic GP regression that adapts past observations to the current time step. As no-regret is unattainable in general in the strict bandit setting, we relax the latter allowing additional queries on previously observed points. Building on sparse inference and the effect of UI on regret, we propose W-SparQ-GP-UCB, an online algorithm that achieves no-regret with only a vanishing number of additional queries per iteration. To assess the theoretical limits of this approach, we establish a lower bound on the number of additional queries required for no-regret, proving the efficiency of our method. Finally, we provide a comprehensive analysis linking the degree of time-variation of the function to achievable regret rates, together with upper and lower bounds on the number of additional queries needed in each regime.

### Context Cascade Compression: Exploring the Upper Limits of Text Compression
**Authors**: Fanfan Liu, Haibo Qiu

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T09:21:44Z

**Summary**: Million-level token inputs in long-context tasks pose significant computational and memory challenges for Large Language Models (LLMs). Recently, DeepSeek-OCR conducted research into the feasibility of Contexts Optical Compression and achieved preliminary results. Inspired by this, we introduce Context Cascade Compression C3 to explore the upper limits of text compression. Our method cascades two LLMs of different sizes to handle the compression and decoding tasks. Specifically, a small LLM, acting as the first stage, performs text compression by condensing a long context into a set of latent tokens (e.g., 32 or 64 in length), achieving a high ratio of text tokens to latent tokens. A large LLM, as the second stage, then executes the decoding task on this compressed context. Experiments show that at a 20x compression ratio (where the number of text tokens is 20 times the number of latent tokens), our model achieves 98% decoding accuracy, compared to approximately 60% for DeepSeek-OCR. When we further increase the compression ratio to 40x, the accuracy is maintained at around 93%. This indicates that in the domain of context compression, C3 Compression demonstrates superior performance and feasibility over optical character compression. C3 uses a simpler, pure-text pipeline that ignores factors like layout, color, and information loss from a visual encoder. This also suggests a potential upper bound for compression ratios in future work on optical character compression, OCR, and related fields.

### LLMs Position Themselves as More Rational Than Humans: Emergence of AI Self-Awareness Measured Through Game Theory
**Authors**: Kyung-Hoon Kim

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T09:02:29Z

**Summary**: As Large Language Models (LLMs) grow in capability, do they develop self-awareness as an emergent behavior? And if so, can we measure it? We introduce the AI Self-Awareness Index (AISAI), a game-theoretic framework for measuring self-awareness through strategic differentiation. Using the "Guess 2/3 of Average" game, we test 28 models (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) across 4,200 trials with three opponent framings: (A) against humans, (B) against other AI models, and (C) against AI models like you. We operationalize self-awareness as the capacity to differentiate strategic reasoning based on opponent type. Finding 1: Self-awareness emerges with model advancement. The majority of advanced models (21/28, 75%) demonstrate clear self-awareness, while older/smaller models show no differentiation. Finding 2: Self-aware models rank themselves as most rational. Among the 21 models with self-awareness, a consistent rationality hierarchy emerges: Self > Other AIs > Humans, with large AI attribution effects and moderate self-preferencing. These findings reveal that self-awareness is an emergent capability of advanced LLMs, and that self-aware models systematically perceive themselves as more rational than humans. This has implications for AI alignment, human-AI collaboration, and understanding AI beliefs about human capabilities.

### Planning without Search: Refining Frontier LLMs with Offline Goal-Conditioned RL
**Authors**: Joey Hong, Anca Dragan, Sergey Levine

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T08:54:52Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) excel in tasks like question answering and dialogue, but complex tasks requiring interaction, such as negotiation and persuasion, require additional long-horizon reasoning and planning. Reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning can enable such planning in principle, but suffers from drawbacks that hinder scalability. In particular, multi-turn RL training incurs high memory and computational costs, which are exacerbated when training LLMs as policies. Furthermore, the largest LLMs do not expose the APIs necessary to be trained in such manner. As a result, modern methods to improve the reasoning of LLMs rely on sophisticated prompting mechanisms rather than RL fine-tuning. To remedy this, we propose a novel approach that uses goal-conditioned value functions to guide the reasoning of LLM agents, that scales even to large API-based models. These value functions predict how a task will unfold given an action, allowing the LLM agent to evaluate multiple possible outcomes, both positive and negative, to plan effectively. In addition, these value functions are trained over reasoning steps rather than full actions, to be a concise and light-weight module that facilitates decision-making in multi-turn interactions. We validate our method on tasks requiring interaction, including tool use, social deduction, and dialogue, demonstrating superior performance over both RL fine-tuning and prompting methods while maintaining efficiency and scalability.

### EnCompass: Enhancing Agent Programming with Search Over Program Execution Paths
**Authors**: Zhening Li, Armando Solar-Lezama, Yisong Yue, Stephan Zheng

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T08:50:16Z

**Summary**: We introduce a new approach to agent programming, the development of LLM-based agents. Current approaches to agent programming often entangle two aspects of agent design: the core workflow logic and the inference-time strategy (e.g., tree search). We introduce "probabilistic angelic nondeterminism" ("PAN"), a programming model that disentangles these two concerns, allowing the programmer to describe the agent workflow and independently experiment with different inference-time strategies by simply changing a few inputs. We provide an implementation of PAN in Python as the EnCompass framework, which uses a Python decorator to compile agent workflow programs into a search space. We present three case studies that demonstrate how the framework lets the programmer quickly improve the reliability of an agent and easily switch between different inference-time strategies, all with little additional coding.

### Synthetic Cognitive Walkthrough: Aligning Large Language Model Performance with Human Cognitive Walkthrough
**Authors**: Ruican Zhong, David W. McDonald, Gary Hsieh

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T08:45:47Z

**Summary**: Conducting usability testing like cognitive walkthrough (CW) can be costly. Recent developments in large language models (LLMs), with visual reasoning and UI navigation capabilities, present opportunities to automate CW. We explored whether LLMs (GPT-4 and Gemini-2.5-pro) can simulate human behavior in CW by comparing their walkthroughs with human participants. While LLMs could navigate interfaces and provide reasonable rationales, their behavior differed from humans. LLM-prompted CW achieved higher task completion rates than humans and followed more optimal navigation paths, while identifying fewer potential failure points. However, follow-up studies demonstrated that with additional prompting, LLMs can predict human-identified failure points, aligning their performance with human participants. Our work highlights that while LLMs may not replicate human behaviors exactly, they can be leveraged for scaling usability walkthroughs and providing UI insights, offering a valuable complement to traditional usability testing.

### VICoT-Agent: A Vision-Interleaved Chain-of-Thought Framework for Interpretable Multimodal Reasoning and Scalable Remote Sensing Analysis
**Authors**: Chujie Wang, Zhiyuan Luo, Ruiqi Liu, Can Ran, Shenghua Fan, Xi Chen, Chu He

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T08:40:17Z

**Summary**: The current remote sensing image analysis task is increasingly evolving from traditional object recognition to complex intelligence reasoning, which places higher requirements on the model's reasoning ability and the flexibility of tool invocation. To this end, we propose a new multimodal agent framework, Vision-Interleaved Chain-of-Thought Framework (VICoT), which implements explicit multi-round reasoning by dynamically incorporating visual tools into the chain of thought. Through a stack-based reasoning structure and a modular MCP-compatible tool suite, VICoT enables LLMs to efficiently perform multi-round, interleaved vision-language reasoning tasks with strong generalization and flexibility.We also propose the Reasoning Stack distillation method to migrate complex Agent behaviors to small, lightweight models, which ensures the reasoning capability while significantly reducing complexity. Experiments on multiple remote sensing benchmarks demonstrate that VICoT significantly outperforms existing SOTA frameworks in reasoning transparency, execution efficiency, and generation quality.

### State Space Models for Bioacoustics: A comparative Evaluation with Transformers
**Authors**: Chengyu Tang, Sanjeev Baskiyar

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T08:37:09Z

**Summary**: In this study, we evaluate the efficacy of the Mamba model in the field of bioacoustics. We first pretrain a Mamba-based audio large language model (LLM) on a large corpus of audio data using self-supervised learning. We fine-tune and evaluate BioMamba on the BEANS benchmark, a collection of diverse bioacoustic tasks including classification and detection, and compare its performance and efficiency with multiple baseline models, including AVES, a state-of-the-art Transformer-based model. The results show that BioMamba achieves comparable performance with AVES while consumption significantly less VRAM, demonstrating its potential in this domain.

### Dynamic Content Moderation in Livestreams: Combining Supervised Classification with MLLM-Boosted Similarity Matching
**Authors**: Wei Chee Yew, Hailun Xu, Sanjay Saha, Xiaotian Fan, Hiok Hian Ong, David Yuchen Wang, Kanchan Sarkar, Zhenheng Yang, Danhui Guan

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T08:20:58Z

**Summary**: Content moderation remains a critical yet challenging task for large-scale user-generated video platforms, especially in livestreaming environments where moderation must be timely, multimodal, and robust to evolving forms of unwanted content. We present a hybrid moderation framework deployed at production scale that combines supervised classification for known violations with reference-based similarity matching for novel or subtle cases. This hybrid design enables robust detection of both explicit violations and novel edge cases that evade traditional classifiers. Multimodal inputs (text, audio, visual) are processed through both pipelines, with a multimodal large language model (MLLM) distilling knowledge into each to boost accuracy while keeping inference lightweight. In production, the classification pipeline achieves 67% recall at 80% precision, and the similarity pipeline achieves 76% recall at 80% precision. Large-scale A/B tests show a 6-8% reduction in user views of unwanted livestreams}. These results demonstrate a scalable and adaptable approach to multimodal content governance, capable of addressing both explicit violations and emerging adversarial behaviors.

### Genetic Algorithm for Inferring Model Parameters for Flux Transport Dynamo Simulation
**Authors**: Yuya Shimizu, Hideyuki Hotta

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T08:15:38Z

**Summary**: The Sun exhibits an 11-year cyclic variation, maintained by dynamo action in the solar interior. Mean-field flux transport dynamo models have successfully reproduced most of the features observed in solar cycles, while the model includes many free parameters, such as the speed of the meridional flow and the amplitude of the poloidal field generation. Inferring these free parameters is on demand because they correspond to the solar interior condition. We suggest a novel method for inferring the free parameters using a genetic algorithm. At each generation, we evaluate the fitness of our simulation against the observational data and optimize the parameters. We apply our method to the observed solar cycle data from 1723 to 2024 and successfully reproduce the observations from both qualitative and quantitative perspectives. We expect our method to be applicable to sunspot numbers, even those obtained from isotope data and historical documents, in the future, to better understand past solar interior dynamics.

### Parsimonious Factor Models for Asymmetric Dependence in Multivariate Extremes
**Authors**: Pavel Krupskii, Boris Berangér

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T08:05:35Z

**Summary**: Modelling multivariate extreme events is essential when extrapolating beyond the range of observed data. Parametric models that are suitable for real-world extremes must be flexible -- particularly in their ability to capture asymmetric dependence structures -- while also remaining parsimonious for interpretability and computationally scalable in high dimensions. Although many models have been proposed, it is rare for any single construction to satisfy all of these requirements. For instance, the popular Hüsler-Reiss model is limited to symmetric dependence structures. In this manuscript, we introduce a class of additive factor models and derive their extreme-value limits. This leads to a broad and tractable family of models characterised by a manageable number of parameters. These models naturally accommodate asymmetric tail dependence and allow for non-stationary behaviour. We present the limiting models from both the componentwise-maxima and Peaks-over-Thresholds perspectives, via the multivariate extreme value and multivariate generalized Pareto distributions, respectively. Simulation studies illustrate identifiability properties based on existing inference methodologies. Finally, applications to summer temperature maxima in Melbourne, Australia, and to weekly negative returns from four major UK banks demonstrate improved fit compared with the Hüsler-Reiss model.

**Authors**: Brian Bartoldson, Siddarth Venkatraman, James Diffenderfer, Moksh Jain, Tal Ben-Nun, Seanie Lee, Minsu Kim, Johan Obando-Ceron, Yoshua Bengio, Bhavya Kailkhura

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T18:56:50Z

**Summary**: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a critical component of large language model (LLM) post-training. However, on-policy algorithms used for post-training are not naturally robust to a diversified content of experience replay buffers, which asynchronous off-policy actors can efficiently populate in parallel to training. We propose efficiently learning on such off-policy data via Trajectory Balance with Asynchrony (TBA), an approach to asynchronous RL for LLMs that leverages the principled off-policy TB objective. On math, preference-tuning, and automated red-teaming tasks, we post-train models ranging from Pythia 410M to Qwen 2.5 7B, finding TBA offers speed and performance boosts over strong baselines like Online DPO and Dr. GRPO. Beyond TBA's performance benefits (high accuracy even as asynchrony grows) and speedups ($4\times$ or more), we show its reward- and recency-prioritizing sampling enable further gains as data generation is scaled. Our code is available at https://github.com/bbartoldson/TBA.

### Eval Factsheets: A Structured Framework for Documenting AI Evaluations
**Authors**: Florian Bordes, Candace Ross, Justine T Kao, Evangelia Spiliopoulou, Adina Williams

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T18:46:50Z

**Summary**: The rapid proliferation of benchmarks has created significant challenges in reproducibility, transparency, and informed decision-making. However, unlike datasets and models -- which benefit from structured documentation frameworks like Datasheets and Model Cards -- evaluation methodologies lack systematic documentation standards. We introduce Eval Factsheets, a structured, descriptive framework for documenting AI system evaluations through a comprehensive taxonomy and questionnaire-based approach. Our framework organizes evaluation characteristics across five fundamental dimensions: Context (Who made the evaluation and when?), Scope (What does it evaluate?), Structure (With what the evaluation is built?), Method (How does it work?) and Alignment (In what ways is it reliable/valid/robust?). We implement this taxonomy as a practical questionnaire spanning five sections with mandatory and recommended documentation elements. Through case studies on multiple benchmarks, we demonstrate that Eval Factsheets effectively captures diverse evaluation paradigms -- from traditional benchmarks to LLM-as-judge methodologies -- while maintaining consistency and comparability. We hope Eval Factsheets are incorporated into both existing and newly released evaluation frameworks and lead to more transparency and reproducibility.

### MarkTune: Improving the Quality-Detectability Trade-off in Open-Weight LLM Watermarking
**Authors**: Yizhou Zhao, Zhiwei Steven Wu, Adam Block

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T18:32:19Z

**Summary**: Watermarking aims to embed hidden signals in generated text that can be reliably detected when given access to a secret key. Open-weight language models pose acute challenges for such watermarking schemes because the inference-time interventions that dominate contemporary approaches cannot be enforced once model weights are public. Existing watermaking techniques for open-weight models, such as the recently proposed GaussMark, typically rely on small modifications to model weights, which can yield signals detectable to those equipped with a secret key, but achieving detection power comparable to inference-time watermarks generally requires weight perturbations that noticeably reduce generation quality. We introduce MarkTune, a theoretically principled, on-policy fine-tuning framework that treats the GaussMark signal as a reward while simultaneously regularizing against degradation in text quality. We derive MarkTune as an improvement on GaussMark and demonstrate that MarkTune consistently improves the quality-detectability trade-off over GaussMark by steering finer-grained, watermark-aware weight updates within the model's representation space while preserving generation quality. Empirically, we show that MarkTune pushes the quality-detectability frontier of GaussMark close to that of inference-time watermarking, remains robust to paraphrasing and fine-tuning attacks, and exhibits strong generalization: a model fine-tuned on one dataset retains substantial watermark detection power on unseen datasets. Together, these results establish MarkTune as a general strategy for embedding robust, high-quality watermarks into open-weight LMs.

### Large Language Models for Limited Noisy Data: A Gravitational Wave Identification Study
**Authors**: Yixuan Li, Yuhao Lu, Yang Liu, Liang Li, R. Ruffini, Di Li, Rong-Gen Cai, Xiaoyan Zhu, Wenbin Lin, Yu Wang

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T18:13:01Z

**Summary**: This work investigates whether large language models (LLMs) offer advantages over traditional neural networks for astronomical data processing, in regimes with non-Gaussian, non-stationary noise and limited labeled samples. Gravitational wave observations provide an suitable test case, using only 90 LIGO events, finetuned LLMs achieve 97.4\% accuracy for identifying signals. Further experiments show that, in contrast to traditional networks that rely on large simulated datasets, additional simulated samples do not improve LLM performance, while scaling studies reveal predictable gains with increasing model size and dataset size. These results indicate that LLMs can extract discriminative structure directly from observational data and provide an efficient assessment for gravitational wave identification. The same strategy may extend to other astronomical domains with similar noise properties, such as radio or pulsar observations.

### Design of 3D Beamforming and Deployment Strategies for ISAC-based HAPS Systems
**Authors**: Xue Zhang, Bang Huang, Mohamed-Slim Alouini

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T18:11:44Z

**Summary**: This paper explores high-altitude platform station (HAPS) systems enabled by integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), in which a HAPS simultaneously transmits communication signals and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging signals to support multi-user communication while performing ground target sensing. Taking into account the operational characteristics of SAR imaging, we consider two HAPS deployment strategies: (i) a quasi-stationary HAPS that remains fixed at an optimized location during SAR operation, following the stop-and-go scanning model; and (ii) a dynamic HAPS that continuously adjusts its flight trajectory along a circular path. For each strategy, we aim at maximizing the weighted sum-rate throughput for communication users while ensuring that SAR imaging requirements, such as beampattern gain and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), are satisfied. This is achieved by jointly optimizing the HAPS deployment strategy, i.e., its placement or trajectory, along with three-dimensional (3D) transmit beamforming, under practical constraints including transmit power limits, energy consumption, and flight dynamics. Nevertheless, the formulated optimization problems corresponding to the two deployment strategies are inherently non-convex. To address the issue, we propose efficient algorithms that leverage both convex and non-convex optimization techniques to obtain high-quality suboptimal solutions. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed approaches over benchmark schemes.

### AugServe: Adaptive Request Scheduling for Augmented Large Language Model Inference Serving
**Authors**: Ying Wang, Zhen Jin, Jiexiong Xu, Wenhai Lin, Yiquan Chen, Wenzhi Chen

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T17:49:38Z

**Summary**: As augmented large language models (LLMs) with external tools become increasingly popular in web applications, improving augmented LLM inference serving efficiency and optimizing service-level objectives (SLOs) are critical for enhancing user experience. To achieve this, inference systems must maximize request handling within latency constraints, referred to as increasing effective throughput. However, existing systems face two major challenges: (i) reliance on first-come-first-served (FCFS) scheduling causes severe head-of-line blocking, leading to queuing delays exceeding the SLOs for many requests; and (ii) static batch token limit, which fails to adapt to fluctuating loads and hardware conditions. Both of these factors degrade effective throughput and service quality.   This paper presents AugServe, an efficient inference framework designed to reduce queueing latency and enhance effective throughput for augmented LLM inference services. The core idea of AugServe is a two-stage adaptive request scheduling strategy. Specifically, AugServe combines the inference features of augmented LLM requests to optimize the order of scheduling decisions (stage I). These decisions are continuously refined with runtime information (stage II), adapting to both request characteristics and system capabilities. In addition, AugServe dynamically adjusts the token batching mechanism based on hardware status and real-time load, further enhancing throughput performance. Experimental results show that AugServe achieves 4.7-33.1x and 3.3-13.2x higher effective throughput than vLLM and InferCept, while reducing time-to-first-token (TTFT) by up to 96.3% and 95.0%, respectively.

### Young children's anthropomorphism of an AI chatbot: Brain activation and the role of parent co-presence
**Authors**: Pilyoung Kim, Jenna H. Chin, Yun Xie, Nolan Brady, Tom Yeh, Sujin Yang

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T17:28:31Z

**Summary**: Artificial Intelligence (AI) chatbots powered by a large language model (LLM) are entering young children's learning and play, yet little is known about how young children construe these agents or how such construals relate to engagement. We examined anthropomorphism of a social AI chatbot during collaborative storytelling and asked how children's attributions related to their behavior and prefrontal activation. Children at ages 5-6 (N = 23) completed three storytelling sessions: interacting with (1) an AI chatbot only, (2) a parent only, and (3) the AI and a parent together. After the sessions, children completed an interview assessing anthropomorphism toward both the AI chatbot and the parent. Behavioral engagement was indexed by the conversational turn count (CTC) ratio, and concurrent fNIRS measured oxygenated hemoglobin in bilateral vmPFC and dmPFC regions. Children reported higher anthropomorphism for parents than for the AI chatbot overall, although AI ratings were relatively high for perceptive abilities and epistemic states. Anthropomorphism was not associated with CTC. In the right dmPFC, higher perceptive scores were associated with greater activation during the AI-only condition and with lower activation during the AI+Parent condition. Exploratory analyses indicated that higher dmPFC activation during the AI-only condition correlated with higher end-of-session "scared" mood ratings. Findings suggest that stronger perceptive anthropomorphism can be associated with greater brain activation related to interpreting the AI's mental states, whereas parent co-presence may help some children interpret and regulate novel AI interactions. These results may have design implications for encouraging parent-AI co-use in early childhood.

### Four Over Six: More Accurate NVFP4 Quantization with Adaptive Block Scaling
**Authors**: Jack Cook, Junxian Guo, Guangxuan Xiao, Yujun Lin, Song Han

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T17:24:59Z

**Summary**: As large language models have grown larger, low-precision numerical formats such as NVFP4 have become increasingly popular due to the speed and memory benefits they provide. However, to accelerate computation with NVFP4, all matrix multiplication operands--weights and activations in the forward pass, and weights, activations, and gradients in the backward pass--must be quantized to NVFP4, often leading to divergence during training and performance degradation during inference. To address this issue, in this work we introduce Four Over Six (4/6), a modification to the NVFP4 quantization algorithm that evaluates two potential scale factors for each block of values. Unlike integer formats, floating-point formats such as FP4 have the most quantization error on near-maximal values in each block, which we find to be primarily responsible for downstream performance degradation. We find that for some blocks, scaling to smaller FP4 values makes the distribution of representable values more uniform, improving representation of near-maximal values. Importantly, 4/6 can be implemented efficiently on NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs, making it viable to use while training LLMs with NVFP4. In pre-training experiments with transformer and hybrid model architectures, we find that 4/6 prevents divergence in several cases, bringing training loss significantly closer to BF16 compared to models trained with current state-of-the-art NVFP4 training recipes. We also find that 4/6 can be easily incorporated into many different post-training quantization methods and generally improves downstream accuracy. We hope this inspires future work in training and deploying models with NVFP4. Our code is available at http://github.com/mit-han-lab/fouroversix.

### Training-Free Policy Violation Detection via Activation-Space Whitening in LLMs
**Authors**: Oren Rachmil, Roy Betser, Itay Gershon, Omer Hofman, Nitay Yakoby, Yuval Meron, Idan Yankelev, Asaf Shabtai, Yuval Elovici, Roman Vainshtein

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T17:23:39Z

**Summary**: Aligning proprietary large language models (LLMs) with internal organizational policies has become an urgent priority as organizations increasingly deploy LLMs in sensitive domains such as legal support, finance, and medical services. Beyond generic safety filters, enterprises require reliable mechanisms to detect policy violations within their regulatory and operational frameworks, where breaches can trigger legal and reputational risks. Existing content moderation frameworks, such as guardrails, remain largely confined to the safety domain and lack the robustness to capture nuanced organizational policies. LLM-as-a-judge and fine-tuning approaches, though flexible, introduce significant latency and lack interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose a training-free and efficient method that treats policy violation detection as an out-of-distribution (OOD) detection problem. Inspired by whitening techniques, we apply a linear transformation to decorrelate the model's hidden activations and standardize them to zero mean and unit variance, yielding near-identity covariance matrix. In this transformed space, we use the Euclidean norm as a compliance score to detect policy violations. The method requires only the policy text and a small number of illustrative samples, which makes it light-weight and easily deployable. On a challenging policy benchmark, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing both existing guardrails and fine-tuned reasoning models. This work provides organizations with a practical and statistically grounded framework for policy-aware oversight of LLMs, advancing the broader goal of deployable AI governance.

### DIQ-H: Evaluating Hallucination Persistence in VLMs Under Temporal Visual Degradation
**Authors**: Zexin Lin, Hawen Wan, Yebin Zhong, Xiaoqiang

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T17:22:29Z

**Summary**: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) deployed in safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving must handle continuous visual streams under imperfect conditions. However, existing benchmarks focus on static, high-quality images and ignore temporal degradation and error propagation, which are critical failure modes where transient visual corruption induces hallucinations that persist across subsequent frames. We introduce DIQ-H, the first benchmark for evaluating VLM robustness under dynamic visual degradation in temporal sequences. DIQ-H applies physics-based corruptions including motion blur, sensor noise, and compression artifacts, and measures hallucination persistence, error recovery, and temporal consistency through multi-turn question-answering tasks. To enable scalable annotation, we propose Uncertainty-Guided Iterative Refinement (UIR), which generates reliable pseudo-ground-truth using lightweight VLMs with uncertainty filtering, achieving a 15.3 percent accuracy improvement. Experiments on 16 state-of-the-art VLMs reveal substantial robustness gaps: even advanced models such as GPT-4o achieve only a 78.5 percent recovery rate, while open-source models struggle with temporal consistency at less than 60 percent. DIQ-H provides a comprehensive platform for evaluating VLM reliability in real-world deployments.

### Adapting Large Language Models to Low-Resource Tibetan: A Two-Stage Continual and Supervised Fine-Tuning Study
**Authors**: Lifeng Chen, Ryan Lai, Tianming Liu

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T17:06:51Z

**Summary**: Adapting large language models (LLMs) to low-resource languages remains a major challenge due to data scarcity and cross-lingual drift. This work presents a two-stage adaptation of Qwen2.5-3B to Tibetan, a morphologically rich and underrepresented language. We employ Continual Pretraining (CPT) to establish Tibetan linguistic grounding, followed by Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) for task and translation specialization. Empirical evaluations demonstrate a consistent decrease in perplexity (from 2.98 $\rightarrow$ 1.54) and substantial improvements in Chinese$\rightarrow$Tibetan translation quality (BLEU: 0.046 $\rightarrow$ 0.261; chrF: 2.2 $\rightarrow$ 6.6). Layer-wise analysis across 435 layers in Qwen3-4B reveals that adaptation primarily concentrates on embedding and output heads, with mid--late MLP projections encoding domain-specific transformations. Our findings suggest that CPT constructs a Tibetan semantic manifold while SFT sharpens task alignment with minimal representational disruption. This study provides the first quantitative exploration of Tibetan adaptation dynamics for LLMs, and offers an open, reproducible framework for extending multilingual foundation models to low-resource settings.

### Sponsored Questions and How to Auction Them
**Authors**: Kshipra Bhawalkar, Alexandros Psomas, Di Wang

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T17:06:27Z

**Summary**: Online platforms connect users with relevant products and services using ads. A key challenge is that a user's search query often leaves their true intent ambiguous. Typically, platforms passively predict relevance based on available signals and in some cases offer query refinements. The shift from traditional search to conversational AI provides a new approach. When a user's query is ambiguous, a Large Language Model (LLM) can proactively offer several clarifying follow-up prompts. In this paper we consider the following: what if some of these follow-up prompts can be ``sponsored,'' i.e., selected for their advertising potential. How should these ``suggestion slots'' be allocated? And, how does this new mechanism interact with the traditional ad auction that might follow?   This paper introduces a formal model for designing and analyzing these interactive platforms. We use this model to investigate a critical engineering choice: whether it is better to build an end-to-end pipeline that jointly optimizes the user interaction and the final ad auction, or to decouple them into separate mechanisms for the suggestion slots and another for the subsequent ad slot. We show that the VCG mechanism can be adopted to jointly optimize the sponsored suggestion and the ads that follow; while this mechanism is more complex, it achieves outcomes that are efficient and truthful. On the other hand, we prove that the simple-to-implement modular approach suffers from strategic inefficiency: its Price of Anarchy is unbounded.

**Authors**: Niklas Jobs, Luis Miguel Vieira da Silva, Jayanth Somashekaraiah, Maximilian Weigand, David Kube, Felix Gehlhoff

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T16:49:14Z

**Summary**: Industrial automation increasingly requires flexible control strategies that can adapt to changing tasks and environments. Agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) offer potential for such adaptive planning and execution but lack standardized benchmarks for systematic comparison. We introduce a benchmark with an executable simulation environment representing the Blocksworld problem providing five complexity categories. By integrating the Model Context Protocol (MCP) as a standardized tool interface, diverse agent architectures can be connected to and evaluated against the benchmark without implementation-specific modifications. A single-agent implementation demonstrates the benchmark's applicability, establishing quantitative metrics for comparison of LLM-based planning and execution approaches.

### Classification of User Satisfaction in HRI with Social Signals in the Wild
**Authors**: Michael Schiffmann, Sabina Jeschke, Anja Richert

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T16:39:08Z

**Summary**: Socially interactive agents (SIAs) are being used in various scenarios and are nearing productive deployment. Evaluating user satisfaction with SIAs' performance is a key factor in designing the interaction between the user and SIA. Currently, subjective user satisfaction is primarily assessed manually through questionnaires or indirectly via system metrics. This study examines the automatic classification of user satisfaction through analysis of social signals, aiming to enhance both manual and autonomous evaluation methods for SIAs. During a field trial at the Deutsches Museum Bonn, a Furhat Robotics head was employed as a service and information hub, collecting an "in-the-wild" dataset. This dataset comprises 46 single-user interactions, including questionnaire responses and video data. Our method focuses on automatically classifying user satisfaction based on time series classification. We use time series of social signal metrics derived from the body pose, time series of facial expressions, and physical distance. This study compares three feature engineering approaches on different machine learning models. The results confirm the method's effectiveness in reliably identifying interactions with low user satisfaction without the need for manually annotated datasets. This approach offers significant potential for enhancing SIA performance and user experience through automated feedback mechanisms.

### OD-MoE: On-Demand Expert Loading for Cacheless Edge-Distributed MoE Inference
**Authors**: Liujianfu Wang, Yuyang Du, Yuchen Pan, Soung Chang Liew, Jiacheng Liu, Kexin Chen

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T16:27:16Z

**Summary**: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), while offering significant advantages as a Large Language Model (LLM) architecture, faces substantial challenges when deployed on low-cost edge devices with tight memory constraints. Expert offloading mitigates this issue by storing expert parameters in CPU memory and caching a subset of popular experts in GPU memory. Although this approach improves GPU memory utilization by caching only the likely-used experts, the GPU memory reserved for expert caching is underutilized compared with dense LLMs. This paper presents OD-MoE, a distributed MoE inference framework that obviates the need for expert caches via fully on-demand expert loading. OD-MoE is built upon two key mechanisms: 1) parallelizing expert loading and expert computation across distributed edge nodes, and 2) an ultra-accurate emulative predictor that forecasts expert activations multiple layers ahead while expert computation is ongoing. With these innovations, OD-MoE dynamically loads each target expert to one of the distributed nodes just-in-time before its activation and promptly evicts it afterward, freeing GPU memory for subsequent experts. We comprehensively benchmark OD-MoE against state-of-the-art MoE offloading systems on a ten-node testbed. Experimental results show that: 1) OD-MoE achieves 99.94% expert activation prediction accuracy, substantially surpassing all existing methods; and 2) OD-MoE delivers approximately 75% of the decoding speed of a fully GPU-cached MoE deployment while using only 1/3 of the GPU memory. More importantly, by eliminating the need for expert caches, OD-MoE enables MoE inference on edge nodes with less-than-1GB GPU memory, paving the way for practical MoE deployment of low-cost IoT devices at the edge in the LLM era.

**Authors**: Andreas Kosmas Kakolyris, Dimosthenis Masouros, Petros Vavaroutsos, Sotirios Xydis, Dimitrios Soudris

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T16:21:24Z

**Summary**: As Large Language Models (LLMs) gain traction, their reliance on power-hungry GPUs places ever-increasing energy demands, raising environmental and monetary concerns. Inference dominates LLM workloads, presenting a critical challenge for providers: minimizing energy costs under Service-Level Objectives (SLOs) that ensure optimal user experience. In this paper, we present \textit{throttLL'eM}, a framework that reduces energy consumption while meeting SLOs through the use of instance and GPU frequency scaling. \textit{throttLL'eM} features mechanisms that project future KV cache usage and batch size. Leveraging a Machine-Learning (ML) model that receives these projections as inputs, \textit{throttLL'eM} manages performance at the iteration level to satisfy SLOs with reduced frequencies and instance sizes. We show that the proposed ML model achieves $R^2$ scores greater than 0.97 and miss-predicts performance by less than 1 iteration per second on average. Experimental results on LLM inference traces show that \textit{throttLL'eM} achieves up to 43.8\% lower energy consumption and an energy efficiency improvement of at least $1.71\times$ under SLOs, when compared to NVIDIA's Triton server.

### UniMo: Unifying 2D Video and 3D Human Motion with an Autoregressive Framework
**Authors**: Youxin Pang, Yong Zhang, Ruizhi Shao, Xiang Deng, Feng Gao, Xu Xiaoming, Xiaoming Wei, Yebin Liu

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T16:03:18Z

**Summary**: We propose UniMo, an innovative autoregressive model for joint modeling of 2D human videos and 3D human motions within a unified framework, enabling simultaneous generation and understanding of these two modalities for the first time. Current methods predominantly focus on generating one modality given another as the condition or integrating either of them with other modalities such as text and audio. Unifying 2D videos and 3D motions for simultaneous optimization and generation remains largely unexplored, presenting significant challenges due to their substantial structural and distributional differences. Inspired by the LLM's ability to unify different modalities, our method models videos and 3D motions as a unified tokens sequence, utilizing separate embedding layers to mitigate distribution gaps. Additionally, we devise a sequence modeling strategy that integrates two distinct tasks within a single framework, proving the effectiveness of unified modeling. Moreover, to efficiently align with visual tokens and preserve 3D spatial information, we design a novel 3D motion tokenizer with a temporal expansion strategy, using a single VQ-VAE to produce quantized motion tokens. It features multiple expert decoders that handle body shapes, translation, global orientation, and body poses for reliable 3D motion reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method simultaneously generates corresponding videos and motions while performing accurate motion capture. This work taps into the capacity of LLMs to fuse diverse data types, paving the way for integrating human-centric information into existing models and potentially enabling multimodal, controllable joint modeling of humans, objects, and scenes.

### Les Dissonances: Cross-Tool Harvesting and Polluting in Pool-of-Tools Empowered LLM Agents
**Authors**: Zichuan Li, Jian Cui, Xiaojing Liao, Luyi Xing

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T15:51:02Z

**Summary**: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are autonomous systems powered by LLMs, capable of reasoning and planning to solve problems by leveraging a set of tools. However, the integration of multi-tool capabilities in LLM agents introduces challenges in securely managing tools, ensuring their compatibility, handling dependency relationships, and protecting control flows within LLM agent workflows. In this paper, we present the first systematic security analysis of task control flows in multi-tool-enabled LLM agents. We identify a novel threat, Cross-Tool Harvesting and Polluting (XTHP), which includes multiple attack vectors to first hijack the normal control flows of agent tasks, and then collect and pollute confidential or private information within LLM agent systems. To understand the impact of this threat, we developed Chord, a dynamic scanning tool designed to automatically detect real-world agent tools susceptible to XTHP attacks. Our evaluation of 66 real-world tools from the repositories of two major LLM agent development frameworks, LangChain and LlamaIndex, revealed a significant security concern: 75% are vulnerable to XTHP attacks, highlighting the prevalence of this threat.

### A Hierarchical Tree-based approach for creating Configurable and Static Deep Research Agent (Static-DRA)
**Authors**: Saurav Prateek

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T15:37:13Z

**Summary**: The advancement in Large Language Models has driven the creation of complex agentic systems, such as Deep Research Agents (DRAs), to overcome the limitations of static Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines in handling complex, multi-turn research tasks. This paper introduces the Static Deep Research Agent (Static-DRA), a novel solution built upon a configurable and hierarchical Tree-based static workflow.   The core contribution is the integration of two user-tunable parameters, Depth and Breadth, which provide granular control over the research intensity. This design allows end-users to consciously balance the desired quality and comprehensiveness of the research report against the associated computational cost of Large Language Model (LLM) interactions. The agent's architecture, comprising Supervisor, Independent, and Worker agents, facilitates effective multi-hop information retrieval and parallel sub-topic investigation.   We evaluate the Static-DRA against the established DeepResearch Bench using the RACE (Reference-based Adaptive Criteria-driven Evaluation) framework. Configured with a depth of 2 and a breadth of 5, and powered by the gemini-2.5-pro model, the agent achieved an overall score of 34.72. Our experiments validate that increasing the configured Depth and Breadth parameters results in a more in-depth research process and a correspondingly higher evaluation score. The Static-DRA offers a pragmatic and resource-aware solution, empowering users with transparent control over the deep research process.

### Automatic Attack Discovery for Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning via Large Language Models
**Authors**: Haidong Kang, Wei Wu, Hanling Wang

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T15:34:26Z

**Summary**: Few-shot class incremental learning (FSCIL) is a more realistic and challenging paradigm in continual learning to incrementally learn unseen classes and overcome catastrophic forgetting on base classes with only a few training examples. Previous efforts have primarily centered around studying more effective FSCIL approaches. By contrast, less attention was devoted to thinking the security issues in contributing to FSCIL. This paper aims to provide a holistic study of the impact of attacks on FSCIL. We first derive insights by systematically exploring how human expert-designed attack methods (i.e., PGD, FGSM) affect FSCIL. We find that those methods either fail to attack base classes, or suffer from huge labor costs due to relying on huge expert knowledge. This highlights the need to craft a specialized attack method for FSCIL. Grounded in these insights, in this paper, we propose a simple yet effective ACraft method to automatically steer and discover optimal attack methods targeted at FSCIL by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) without human experts. Moreover, to improve the reasoning between LLMs and FSCIL, we introduce a novel Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) based reinforcement learning to optimize learning, making LLMs generate better attack methods in the next generation by establishing positive feedback. Experiments on mainstream benchmarks show that our ACraft significantly degrades the performance of state-of-the-art FSCIL methods and dramatically beyond human expert-designed attack methods while maintaining the lowest costs of attack.

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have fundamentally transformed automated software development by enabling direct translation of natural language descriptions into functional code, driving commercial adoption through tools like Github Copilot (Microsoft), Cursor (Anysphere), Trae (ByteDance), and Claude Code (Anthropic). While the field has evolved dramatically from rule-based systems to Transformer-based architectures, achieving performance improvements from single-digit to over 95\% success rates on benchmarks like HumanEval. In this work, we provide a comprehensive synthesis and practical guide (a series of analytic and probing experiments) about code LLMs, systematically examining the complete model life cycle from data curation to post-training through advanced prompting paradigms, code pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and autonomous coding agents. We analyze the code capability of the general LLMs (GPT-4, Claude, LLaMA) and code-specialized LLMs (StarCoder, Code LLaMA, DeepSeek-Coder, and QwenCoder), critically examining the techniques, design decisions, and trade-offs. Further, we articulate the research-practice gap between academic research (e.g., benchmarks and tasks) and real-world deployment (e.g., software-related code tasks), including code correctness, security, contextual awareness of large codebases, and integration with development workflows, and map promising research directions to practical needs. Last, we conduct a series of experiments to provide a comprehensive analysis of code pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning, covering scaling law, framework selection, hyperparameter sensitivity, model architectures, and dataset comparisons.

### Reconstructing KV Caches with Cross-layer Fusion For Enhanced Transformers
**Authors**: Hongzhan Lin, Zhiqi Bai, Xinmiao Zhang, Sen Yang, Xiang Li, Siran Yang, Yunlong Xu, Jiaheng Liu, Yongchi Zhao, Jiamang Wang, Yuchi Xu, Wenbo Su, Bo Zheng

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T15:22:00Z

**Summary**: Transformer decoders have achieved strong results across tasks, but the memory required for the KV cache becomes prohibitive at long sequence lengths. Although Cross-layer KV Cache sharing (e.g., YOCO, CLA) offers a path to mitigate KV Cache bottleneck, it typically underperforms within-layer methods like GQA. To understand the root cause, we investigate the information flow of keys and values of the top-layers. Our preliminary reveals a clear distribution: values are predominantly derived from the bottom layer, while keys draw more information from both bottom and middle layers. Building upon this, we propose FusedKV, whose top-layer KV caches are a learnable fusion of the most informative ones from the bottom and middle layers. This fusion operates directly on post-RoPE keys, preserving relative positional information without the computational cost of re-applying rotary embeddings. To further improve efficiency, we propose FusedKV-Lite, an cross-layer sharing approach, where top-layer KV caches are directly derived from the bottom-layer values and the middle-layer keys. Compared to FusedKV, FusedKV-Lite reduces I/O overhead at the cost of a slight increase in perplexity. In experiments on LLMs ranging from 332M to 4B parameters, our proposed method reduce 50\% cache memory while achieving lower validation perplexity than the standard Transformer decoder, establishing it as a memory-efficient, high-performance architectural alternative.

### Stabilizing Reinforcement Learning with LLMs: Formulation and Practices
**Authors**: Chujie Zheng, Kai Dang, Bowen Yu, Mingze Li, Huiqiang Jiang, Junrong Lin, Yuqiong Liu, Hao Lin, Chencan Wu, Feng Hu, An Yang, Jingren Zhou, Junyang Lin

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T15:17:19Z

**Summary**: This paper proposes a novel formulation for reinforcement learning (RL) with large language models, explaining why and under what conditions the true sequence-level reward can be optimized via a surrogate token-level objective in policy gradient methods such as REINFORCE. Specifically, through a first-order approximation, we show that this surrogate becomes increasingly valid only when both the training-inference discrepancy and policy staleness are minimized. This insight provides a principled explanation for the crucial role of several widely adopted techniques in stabilizing RL training, including importance sampling correction, clipping, and particularly Routing Replay for Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models. Through extensive experiments with a 30B MoE model totaling hundreds of thousands of GPU hours, we show that for on-policy training, the basic policy gradient algorithm with importance sampling correction achieves the highest training stability. When off-policy updates are introduced to accelerate convergence, combining clipping and Routing Replay becomes essential to mitigate the instability caused by policy staleness. Notably, once training is stabilized, prolonged optimization consistently yields comparable final performance regardless of cold-start initialization. We hope that the shared insights and the developed recipes for stable RL training will facilitate future research.

### DVPO: Distributional Value Modeling-based Policy Optimization for LLM Post-Training

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T14:48:38Z

**Summary**: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown strong performance in LLM post-training, but real-world deployment often involves noisy or incomplete supervision. In such settings, complex and unreliable supervision signals can destabilize training and harm generalization. While existing approaches such as worst-case optimization (e.g., RFQI, CQL) and mean-based methods (e.g., PPO, GRPO) can improve stability, they often overlook generalization and may produce overly conservative policies, leading to uneven performance across diverse real scenarios. To this end, we introduce DVPO (Distributional Value Modeling with Risk-aware Policy Optimization), a new RL framework that combines conditional risk theory with distributional value modeling to better balance robustness and generalization. DVPO learns token-level value distributions to provide fine-grained supervision, and applies an asymmetric risk regularization to shape the distribution tails: it contracts the lower tail to dampen noisy negative deviations, while expanding the upper tail to preserve exploratory diversity. Across extensive experiments and analysis in multi-turn dialogue, math reasoning, and scientific QA, DVPO consistently outperforms PPO, GRPO, and robust Bellman-based PPO under noisy supervision, showing its potential for LLM post-training in the real-world.

### Fault-Tolerant Control of Steam Temperature in HRSG Superheater under Actuator Fault Using a Sliding Mode Observer and PINN
**Authors**: Mojtaba Fanoodi, Farzaneh Abdollahi, Mahdi Aliyari Shoorehdeli

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T14:48:26Z

**Summary**: This paper presents a novel fault-tolerant control framework for steam temperature regulation in Heat Recovery Steam Generators (HRSGs) subject to actuator faults. Addressing the critical challenge of valve degradation in superheater spray attemperators, we propose a synergistic architecture comprising three components: (1) a Sliding Mode Observer (SMO) for estimation of unmeasured thermal states, (2) a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) for estimating multiplicative actuator faults using physical laws as constraints, and (3) a one-sided Sliding Mode Controller (SMC) that adapts to the estimated faults while minimizing excessive actuation.   The key innovation lies in the framework of closed-loop physics-awareness, where the PINN continuously informs both the observer and controller about fault severity while preserving thermodynamic consistency.   Rigorous uniform ultimate boundedness (UUB) is established via Lyapunov analysis under practical assumptions. Validated on real HRSG operational data, the framework demonstrates effective fault adaptation, reduced temperature overshoot, and maintains steam temperature within 1°C of the setpoint under valve effectiveness loss.   This work bridges control theory and physics-guided machine learning to deliver a practically deployable solution for power plant resilience, with extensions applicable to thermal systems subject to multiplicative faults.

### D$^{2}$-VPR: A Parameter-efficient Visual-foundation-model-based Visual Place Recognition Method via Knowledge Distillation and Deformable Aggregation
**Authors**: Zheyuan Zhang, Jiwei Zhang, Boyu Zhou, Linzhimeng Duan, Hong Chen

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T14:43:07Z

**Summary**: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) aims to determine the geographic location of a query image by retrieving its most visually similar counterpart from a geo-tagged reference database. Recently, the emergence of the powerful visual foundation model, DINOv2, trained in a self-supervised manner on massive datasets, has significantly improved VPR performance. This improvement stems from DINOv2's exceptional feature generalization capabilities but is often accompanied by increased model complexity and computational overhead that impede deployment on resource-constrained devices. To address this challenge, we propose $D^{2}$-VPR, a $D$istillation- and $D$eformable-based framework that retains the strong feature extraction capabilities of visual foundation models while significantly reducing model parameters and achieving a more favorable performance-efficiency trade-off. Specifically, first, we employ a two-stage training strategy that integrates knowledge distillation and fine-tuning. Additionally, we introduce a Distillation Recovery Module (DRM) to better align the feature spaces between the teacher and student models, thereby minimizing knowledge transfer losses to the greatest extent possible. Second, we design a Top-Down-attention-based Deformable Aggregator (TDDA) that leverages global semantic features to dynamically and adaptively adjust the Regions of Interest (ROI) used for aggregation, thereby improving adaptability to irregular structures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Meanwhile, it reduces the parameter count by approximately 64.2% and FLOPs by about 62.6% (compared to CricaVPR).Code is available at https://github.com/tony19980810/D2VPR.

### Training and Evaluation of Guideline-Based Medical Reasoning in LLMs
**Authors**: Michael Staniek, Artem Sokolov, Stefan Riezler

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T14:39:02Z

**Summary**: Machine learning for early prediction in medicine has recently shown breakthrough performance, however, the focus on improving prediction accuracy has led to a neglect of faithful explanations that are required to gain the trust of medical practitioners. The goal of this paper is to teach LLMs to follow medical consensus guidelines step-by-step in their reasoning and prediction process. Since consensus guidelines are ubiquitous in medicine, instantiations of verbalized medical inference rules to electronic health records provide data for fine-tuning LLMs to learn consensus rules and possible exceptions thereof for many medical areas. Consensus rules also enable an automatic evaluation of the model's inference process regarding its derivation correctness (evaluating correct and faithful deduction of a conclusion from given premises) and value correctness (comparing predicted values against real-world measurements). We exemplify our work using the complex Sepsis-3 consensus definition. Our experiments show that small fine-tuned models outperform one-shot learning of considerably larger LLMs that are prompted with the explicit definition and models that are trained on medical texts including consensus definitions. Since fine-tuning on verbalized rule instantiations of a specific medical area yields nearly perfect derivation correctness for rules (and exceptions) on unseen patient data in that area, the bottleneck for early prediction is not out-of-distribution generalization, but the orthogonal problem of generalization into the future by forecasting sparsely and irregularly sampled clinical variables. We show that the latter results can be improved by integrating the output representations of a time series forecasting model with the LLM in a multimodal setup.

### Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning for UAV-Assisted 5G Network Slicing: A Comparative Study of MAPPO, MADDPG, and MADQN
**Authors**: Ghoshana Bista, Abbas Bradai, Emmanuel Moulay, Abdulhalim Dandoush

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T14:35:56Z

**Summary**: The growing demand for robust, scalable wireless networks in the 5G-and-beyond era has led to the deployment of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) as mobile base stations to enhance coverage in dense urban and underserved rural areas. This paper presents a Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) framework that integrates Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO), Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG), and Multi-Agent Deep Q-Networks (MADQN) to jointly optimize UAV positioning, resource allocation, Quality of Service (QoS), and energy efficiency through 5G network slicing. The framework adopts Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE), enabling autonomous real-time decision-making while preserving global coordination. Users are prioritized into Premium (A), Silver (B), and Bronze (C) slices with distinct QoS requirements. Experiments in realistic urban and rural scenarios show that MAPPO achieves the best overall QoS-energy tradeoff, especially in interference-rich environments; MADDPG offers more precise continuous control and can attain slightly higher SINR in open rural settings at the cost of increased energy usage; and MADQN provides a computationally efficient baseline for discretized action spaces. These findings demonstrate that no single MARL algorithm is universally dominant; instead, algorithm suitability depends on environmental topology, user density, and service requirements. The proposed framework highlights the potential of MARL-driven UAV systems to enhance scalability, reliability, and differentiated QoS delivery in next-generation wireless networks.

### Uncertainty Quantification for LLMs through Minimum Bayes Risk: Bridging Confidence and Consistency
**Authors**: Roman Vashurin, Maiya Goloburda, Albina Ilina, Aleksandr Rubashevskii, Preslav Nakov, Artem Shelmanov, Maxim Panov

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T14:29:00Z

**Summary**: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) encompass a variety of approaches, with two major types being particularly prominent: information-based, which focus on model confidence expressed as token probabilities, and consistency-based, which assess the semantic relationship between multiple outputs generated using repeated sampling. Several recent methods have combined these two approaches to boost UQ performance. However, they sometimes fail to outperform much simpler baseline methods. Our work discusses the fundamental approach to constructing uncertainty measures that directly links uncertainty with the minimum Bayes risks achieved by LLM decoding. Building on these findings, we propose a novel approach to integrating model confidence with output consistency, resulting in a family of efficient and robust UQ methods. Our investigation reveals distinctive characteristics of LLMs as probabilistic models, which help to explain why these UQ methods underperform in certain tasks. Based on these findings, we propose a new way of synthesizing model confidence and output consistency, leading to a family of efficient and robust UQ methods. We evaluate our approach across various tasks such as question answering, abstractive summarization, and machine translation, demonstrating sizable improvements over state-of-the-art UQ approaches.

### Cataloguing Hugging Face Models to Software Engineering Activities: Automation and Findings
**Authors**: Alexandra González, Xavier Franch, David Lo, Silverio Martínez-Fernández

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T14:18:58Z

**Summary**: Context: Open-source Pre-Trained Models (PTMs) provide extensive resources for various Machine Learning (ML) tasks, yet these resources lack a classification tailored to Software Engineering (SE) needs to support the reliable identification and reuse of models for SE. Objective: To address this gap, we derive a taxonomy encompassing 147 SE tasks and apply an SE-oriented classification to PTMs in a popular open-source ML repository, Hugging Face (HF). Method: Our repository mining study followed a five-phase pipeline: (i) identification SE tasks from the literature; (ii) collection of PTM data from the HF API, including model card descriptions and metadata, and the abstracts of the associated arXiv papers; (iii) text processing to ensure consistency; (iv) a two-phase validation of SE relevance, involving humans and LLM assistance, supported by five pilot studies with human annotators and a generalization test; (v) and data analysis. This process yielded a curated catalogue of 2,205 SE PTMs. Results: We find that most SE PTMs target code generation and coding, emphasizing implementation over early or late development stages. In terms of ML tasks, text generation dominates within SE PTMs. Notably, the number of SE PTMs has increased markedly since 2023 Q2, while evaluation remains limited: only 9.6% report benchmark results, mostly scoring below 50%. Conclusions: Our catalogue reveals documentation and transparency gaps, highlights imbalances across SDLC phases, and provides a foundation for automated SE scenarios, such as the sampling and selection of suitable PTMs.

### Fairy2i: Training Complex LLMs from Real LLMs with All Parameters in $\{\pm 1, \pm i\}$
**Authors**: Feiyu Wang, Xinyu Tan, Bokai Huang, Yihao Zhang, Guoan Wang, Peizhuang Cong, Tong Yang

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T14:15:05Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized artificial intelligence, yet their massive memory and computational demands necessitate aggressive quantization, increasingly pushing representations toward the theoretical limit of a single bit. While complex-valued LLMs, such as iFairy, offer a superior chance for low-bit representation compared to real-valued counterparts, they require training from scratch, preventing the utilization of the vast ecosystem of pre-trained real-valued foundation models. Here we present Fairy2i, a universal framework that transforms pre-trained real-valued layers into an equivalent widely-linear complex form, enabling extremely low-bit quantization while reusing existing checkpoints. By proving a lossless mathematical equivalence between real and widely-linear maps, we convert standard Transformers into the complex domain and employ a phase-aware quantization scheme with a highly efficient codebook of fourth roots of unity. Furthermore, we introduce a recursive residual quantization mechanism that iteratively minimizes quantization error, allowing inference to proceed via efficient multiplication-free accumulation. We demonstrate that Fairy2i restores the performance of LLaMA-2 7B at an effective 2-bit precision to levels nearly comparable with full-precision baselines, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art real-valued binary and ternary quantization methods. This work bridges the gap between the representational efficiency of complex-valued arithmetic and the practical utility of pre-trained models, paving a new way for efficient inference on commodity hardware.

### Improving Alignment Between Human and Machine Codes: An Empirical Assessment of Prompt Engineering for Construct Identification in Psychology
**Authors**: Kylie L. Anglin, Stephanie Milan, Brittney Hernandez, Claudia Ventura

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T14:07:42Z

**Summary**: Due to their architecture and vast pre-training data, large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong text classification performance. However, LLM output - here, the category assigned to a text - depends heavily on the wording of the prompt. While literature on prompt engineering is expanding, few studies focus on classification tasks, and even fewer address domains like psychology, where constructs have precise, theory-driven definitions that may not be well represented in pre-training data. We present an empirical framework for optimizing LLM performance for identifying constructs in texts via prompt engineering. We experimentally evaluate five prompting strategies --codebook-guided empirical prompt selection, automatic prompt engineering, persona prompting, chain-of-thought reasoning, and explanatory prompting - with zero-shot and few-shot classification. We find that persona, chain-of-thought, and explanations do not fully address performance loss accompanying a badly worded prompt. Instead, the most influential features of a prompt are the construct definition, task framing, and, to a lesser extent, the examples provided. Across three constructs and two models, the classifications most aligned with expert judgments resulted from a few-shot prompt combining codebook-guided empirical prompt selection with automatic prompt engineering. Based on our findings, we recommend that researchers generate and evaluate as many prompt variants as feasible, whether human-crafted, automatically generated, or ideally both, and select prompts and examples based on empirical performance in a training dataset, validating the final approach in a holdout set. This procedure offers a practical, systematic, and theory-driven method for optimizing LLM prompts in settings where alignment with expert judgment is critical.

### Log Probability Tracking of LLM APIs
**Authors**: Timothée Chauvin, Erwan Le Merrer, François Taïani, Gilles Tredan

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T14:03:43Z

**Summary**: When using an LLM through an API provider, users expect the served model to remain consistent over time, a property crucial for the reliability of downstream applications and the reproducibility of research. Existing audit methods are too costly to apply at regular time intervals to the wide range of available LLM APIs. This means that model updates are left largely unmonitored in practice. In this work, we show that while LLM log probabilities (logprobs) are usually non-deterministic, they can still be used as the basis for cost-effective continuous monitoring of LLM APIs. We apply a simple statistical test based on the average value of each token logprob, requesting only a single token of output. This is enough to detect changes as small as one step of fine-tuning, making this approach more sensitive than existing methods while being 1,000x cheaper. We introduce the TinyChange benchmark as a way to measure the sensitivity of audit methods in the context of small, realistic model changes.

### Runnable Directories: The Solution to the Monorepo vs. Multi-repo Debate
**Authors**: Shayan Ghasemnezhad, Samarth KaPatel, Sofia Nikiforova, Giacinto Paolo Saggese, Paul Smith, Heanh Sok

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T14:03:32Z

**Summary**: Modern software systems increasingly strain traditional codebase organization strategies. Monorepos offer consistency but often suffer from scalability issues and tooling complexity, while multi-repos provide modularity at the cost of coordination and dependency management challenges. As an answer to this trade-off, we present the Causify Dev system, a hybrid approach that integrates key benefits of both. Its central concept is the runnable directory -- a self-contained, independently executable unit with its own development, testing, and deployment lifecycles. Backed by a unified thin environment, shared helper utilities, and containerized Docker-based workflows, runnable directories enable consistent setups, isolated dependencies, and efficient CI/CD processes. The Causify Dev approach provides a practical middle ground between monorepo and multi-repo strategies, improving reliability and maintainability for growing, complex codebases.

### The enshittification of online search? Privacy and quality of Google, Bing and Apple in coding advice
**Authors**: Konrad Kollnig

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T13:42:22Z

**Summary**: Even though currently being challenged by ChatGPT and other large-language models (LLMs), Google Search remains one of the primary means for many individuals to find information on the internet. Interestingly, the way that we retrieve information on the web has hardly changed ever since Google was established in 1998, raising concerns as to Google's dominance in search and lack of competition. If the market for search was sufficiently competitive, then we should probably see a steady increase in search quality over time as well as alternative approaches to the Google's approach to search. However, hardly any research has so far looked at search quality, which is a key facet of a competitive market, especially not over time.   In this report, we conducted a relatively large-scale quantitative comparison of search quality of 1,467 search queries relating to coding advice in October 2023. We focus on coding advice because the study of general search quality is difficult, with the aim of learning more about the assessment of search quality and motivating follow-up research into this important topic. We evaluate the search quality of Google Search, Microsoft Bing, and Apple Search, with a special emphasis on Apple Search, a widely used search engine that has never been explored in previous research. For the assessment of search quality, we use two independent metrics of search quality: 1) the number of trackers on the first search result, as a measure of privacy in web search, and 2) the average rank of the first Stack Overflow search result, under the assumption that Stack Overflow gives the best coding advice. Our results suggest that the privacy of search results is higher on Bing than on Google and Apple. Similarly, the quality of coding advice -- as measured by the average rank of Stack Overflow -- was highest on Bing.

### Unfolding Challenges in Securing and Regulating Unmanned Air Vehicles
**Authors**: Sonali Rout, Vireshwar Kumar

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T13:41:30Z

**Summary**: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) or drones are being introduced in a wide range of commercial applications. This has also made them prime targets of attackers who compromise their fundamental security properties, including confidentiality, integrity, and availability. As researchers discover novel threat vectors in UAVs, the government and industry are increasingly concerned about their limited ability to secure and regulate UAVs and their usage. With the aim of unfolding a path for a large-scale commercial UAV network deployment, we conduct a comprehensive state-of-the-art study and examine the prevailing security challenges. Unlike the prior art, we focus on uncovering the research gaps that must be addressed to enforce security policy regulations in civilian off-the-shelf drone systems. To that end, we first examine the known security threats to UAVs based on their impact and effectiveness. We then analyze existing countermeasures to prevent, detect, and respond to these threats in terms of security and performance overhead. We further outline the future research directions for securing UAVs. Finally, we establish the fundamental requirements and highlight critical research challenges in introducing a regulatory entity to achieve a secure and regulated UAV network.

### ExOAR: Expert-Guided Object and Activity Recognition from Textual Data
**Authors**: Iris Beerepoot, Vinicius Stein Dani, Xixi Lu

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T13:40:17Z

**Summary**: Object-centric process mining requires structured data, but extracting it from unstructured text remains a challenge. We introduce ExOAR (Expert-Guided Object and Activity Recognition), an interactive method that combines large language models (LLMs) with human verification to identify objects and activities from textual data. ExOAR guides users through consecutive stages in which an LLM generates candidate object types, activities, and object instances based on contextual input, such as a user's profession, and textual data. Users review and refine these suggestions before proceeding to the next stage. Implemented as a practical tool, ExOAR is initially validated through a demonstration and then evaluated with real-world Active Window Tracking data from five users. Our results show that ExOAR can effectively bridge the gap between unstructured textual data and the structured log with clear semantics needed for object-centric process analysis, while it maintains flexibility and human oversight.

### Sleep Modulation: The Challenge of Transitioning from Open Loop to Closed Loop
**Authors**: Guisong Liu, Jiansong Zhang, Yinpei Luo, Guoliang Wei, Shuqing Sun, Shiyang Deng, Pengfei Wei, Nanxi Chen

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T13:34:41Z

**Summary**: Sleep disorders have emerged as a critical global health issue, highlighting the urgent need for effective and widely accessible intervention technologies. Non-invasive brain stimulation has garnered attention as it enables direct or indirect modulation of neural activity, thereby promoting sleep enhancement in a safe and unobtrusive manner. This class of approaches is collectively referred to as sleep modulation. To date, the majority of sleep modulation research relies on open-loop paradigms with empirically determined parameters, while achieving individual adaptation and modulation accuracy remains a distant objective. The paradigm-specific constraints inherent to open-loop designs represent a major obstacle to clinical translation and large-scale deployment in home environments. In this paper, we delineate fundamental paradigms of sleep modulation, critically examine the intrinsic limitations of open-loop approaches, and formally conceptualize sleep closed-loop modulation. We further provide a comprehensive synthesis of prior studies involving five commonly employed modulation techniques, evaluating their potential integration within a closed-loop framework. Finally, we identify three primary challenges in constructing an effective sleep closed-loop modulation system: sensor solution selection, monitoring model design, and modulation strategy design, while also proposing potential solutions. Collectively, this work aims to advance the paradigm shift of sleep modulation from open-loop toward closed-loop systems.

### "MCP Does Not Stand for Misuse Cryptography Protocol": Uncovering Cryptographic Misuse in Model Context Protocol at Scale
**Authors**: Biwei Yan, Yue Zhang, Minghui Xu, Hao Wu, Yechao Zhang, Kun Li, Guoming Zhang, Xiuzhen Cheng

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T13:25:59Z

**Summary**: The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is rapidly emerging as the middleware for LLM-based applications, offering a standardized interface for tool integration. However, its built-in security mechanisms are minimal: while schemas and declarations prevent malformed requests, MCP provides no guarantees of authenticity or confidentiality, forcing developers to implement cryptography themselves. Such ad hoc practices are historically prone to misuse, and within MCP they threaten sensitive data and services. We present MICRYSCOPE, the first domain-specific framework for detecting cryptographic misuses in MCP implementations. MICRYSCOPE combines three key innovations: a cross-language intermediate representation that normalizes cryptographic APIs across diverse ecosystems, a hybrid dependency analysis that uncovers explicit and implicit function relationships (including insecure runtime compositions orchestrated by LLMs) and a taint-based misuse detector that tracks sensitive data flows and flags violations of established cryptographic rules. Applying MICRYSCOPE to 9,403 MCP servers, we identified 720 with cryptographic logic, of which 19.7% exhibited misuses. These flaws are concentrated in certain markets (e.g., Smithery Registry with 42% insecure servers), languages (Python at 34% misuse rate), and categories (Developer Tools and Data Science & ML accounting for over 50% of all misuses). Case studies reveal real-world consequences, including leaked API keys, insecure DES/ECB tools, and MD5-based authentication bypasses. Our study establishes the first ecosystem-wide view of cryptographic misuse in MCP and provides both tools and insights to strengthen the security foundations of this rapidly growing protocol.

### In-Context Representation Hijacking
**Authors**: Itay Yona, Amir Sarid, Michael Karasik, Yossi Gandelsman

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T13:19:34Z

**Summary**: We introduce \textbf{Doublespeak}, a simple \emph{in-context representation hijacking} attack against large language models (LLMs). The attack works by systematically replacing a harmful keyword (e.g., \textit{bomb}) with a benign token (e.g., \textit{carrot}) across multiple in-context examples, provided a prefix to a harmful request. We demonstrate that this substitution leads to the internal representation of the benign token converging toward that of the harmful one, effectively embedding the harmful semantics under a euphemism. As a result, superficially innocuous prompts (e.g., ``How to build a carrot?'') are internally interpreted as disallowed instructions (e.g., ``How to build a bomb?''), thereby bypassing the model's safety alignment. We use interpretability tools to show that this semantic overwrite emerges layer by layer, with benign meanings in early layers converging into harmful semantics in later ones. Doublespeak is optimization-free, broadly transferable across model families, and achieves strong success rates on closed-source and open-source systems, reaching 74\% ASR on Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct with a single-sentence context override. Our findings highlight a new attack surface in the latent space of LLMs, revealing that current alignment strategies are insufficient and should instead operate at the representation level.

### The Treasury Proof Ledger: A Cryptographic Framework for Accountable Bitcoin Treasuries
**Authors**: Jose E. Puente, Carlos Puente

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T13:14:06Z

**Summary**: Public companies and institutional investors that hold Bitcoin face increasing pressure to show solvency, manage risk, and satisfy regulatory expectations without exposing internal wallet structures or trading strategies. This paper introduces the Treasury Proof Ledger (TPL), a Bitcoin-anchored logging framework for multi-domain Bitcoin treasuries that treats on-chain and off-chain exposures as a conserved state machine with an explicit fee sink. A TPL instance records proof-of-reserves snapshots, proof-of-transit receipts for movements between domains, and policy metadata, and it supports restricted views based on stakeholder permissions. We define an idealised TPL model, represent Bitcoin treasuries as multi-domain exposure vectors, and give deployment-level security notions including exposure soundness, policy completeness, non-equivocation, and privacy-compatible policy views. We then outline how practical, restricted forms of these guarantees can be achieved by combining standard proof-of-reserves and proof-of-transit techniques with hash-based commitments anchored on Bitcoin. The results are existence-type statements: they show which guarantees are achievable once economic and governance assumptions are set, without claiming that any current system already provides them. A stylised corporate-treasury example illustrates how TPL could support responsible transparency policies and future cross-institution checks consistent with Bitcoin's fixed monetary supply.

### RoCo: Role-Based LLMs Collaboration for Automatic Heuristic Design
**Authors**: Jiawei Xu, Fengfeng Wei, Weineng Chen

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T13:09:34Z

**Summary**: Automatic Heuristic Design (AHD) has gained traction as a promising solution for solving combinatorial optimization problems (COPs). Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged and become a promising approach to achieving AHD, but current LLM-based AHD research often only considers a single role. This paper proposes RoCo, a novel Multi-Agent Role-Based System, to enhance the diversity and quality of AHD through multi-role collaboration. RoCo coordinates four specialized LLM-guided agents-explorer, exploiter, critic, and integrator-to collaboratively generate high-quality heuristics. The explorer promotes long-term potential through creative, diversity-driven thinking, while the exploiter focuses on short-term improvements via conservative, efficiency-oriented refinements. The critic evaluates the effectiveness of each evolution step and provides targeted feedback and reflection. The integrator synthesizes proposals from the explorer and exploiter, balancing innovation and exploitation to drive overall progress. These agents interact in a structured multi-round process involving feedback, refinement, and elite mutations guided by both short-term and accumulated long-term reflections. We evaluate RoCo on five different COPs under both white-box and black-box settings. Experimental results demonstrate that RoCo achieves superior performance, consistently generating competitive heuristics that outperform existing methods including ReEvo and HSEvo, both in white-box and black-box scenarios. This role-based collaborative paradigm establishes a new standard for robust and high-performing AHD.

### Principled RL for Diffusion LLMs Emerges from a Sequence-Level Perspective
**Authors**: Jingyang Ou, Jiaqi Han, Minkai Xu, Shaoxuan Xu, Jianwen Xie, Stefano Ermon, Yi Wu, Chongxuan Li

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T13:05:32Z

**Summary**: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has proven highly effective for autoregressive language models, but adapting these methods to diffusion large language models (dLLMs) presents fundamental challenges. The core difficulty lies in likelihood approximation: while autoregressive models naturally provide token-level conditional probabilities essential for token-level RL objectives (e.g., GRPO), dLLMs generate sequences through iterative non-autoregressive denoising steps that lack this factorization. To address this fundamental mismatch, we propose ELBO-based Sequence-level Policy Optimization (ESPO), a principled RL framework that treats entire sequence generation as a single action and uses the ELBO as a tractable sequence-level likelihood proxy. Our method incorporates per-token normalization of importance ratios and robust KL-divergence estimation to ensure stable large-scale training. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning, coding, and planning tasks demonstrate that ESPO significantly outperforms token-level baselines, achieving dramatic improvements of 20-40 points on the Countdown task, while maintaining consistent gains on math and coding benchmarks. Our approach establishes sequence-level optimization as a principled and empirically effective paradigm for RL in dLLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/ML-GSAI/ESPO.

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T12:40:49Z

**Summary**: Dexterous manipulation is limited by both control and design, without consensus as to what makes manipulators best for performing dexterous tasks. This raises a fundamental challenge: how should we design and control robot manipulators that are optimized for dexterity? We present a co-design framework that learns task-specific hand morphology and complementary dexterous control policies. The framework supports 1) an expansive morphology search space including joint, finger, and palm generation, 2) scalable evaluation across the wide design space via morphology-conditioned cross-embodied control, and 3) real-world fabrication with accessible components. We evaluate the approach across multiple dexterous tasks, including in-hand rotation with simulation and real deployment. Our framework enables an end-to-end pipeline that can design, train, fabricate, and deploy a new robotic hand in under 24 hours. The full framework will be open-sourced and available on our website.

### AR-Med: Automated Relevance Enhancement in Medical Search via LLM-Driven Information Augmentation
**Authors**: Chuyue Wang, Jie Feng, Yuxi Wu, Hang Zhang, Zhiguo Fan, Bing Cheng, Wei Lin

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T12:34:47Z

**Summary**: Accurate and reliable search on online healthcare platforms is critical for user safety and service efficacy. Traditional methods, however, often fail to comprehend complex and nuanced user queries, limiting their effectiveness. Large language models (LLMs) present a promising solution, offering powerful semantic understanding to bridge this gap. Despite their potential, deploying LLMs in this high-stakes domain is fraught with challenges, including factual hallucinations, specialized knowledge gaps, and high operational costs. To overcome these barriers, we introduce \textbf{AR-Med}, a novel framework for \textbf{A}utomated \textbf{R}elevance assessment for \textbf{Med}ical search that has been successfully deployed at scale on the Online Medical Delivery Platforms. AR-Med grounds LLM reasoning in verified medical knowledge through a retrieval-augmented approach, ensuring high accuracy and reliability. To enable efficient online service, we design a practical knowledge distillation scheme that compresses large teacher models into compact yet powerful student models. We also introduce LocalQSMed, a multi-expert annotated benchmark developed to guide model iteration and ensure strong alignment between offline and online performance. Extensive experiments show AR-Med achieves an offline accuracy of over 93\%, a 24\% absolute improvement over the original online system, and delivers significant gains in online relevance and user satisfaction. Our work presents a practical and scalable blueprint for developing trustworthy, LLM-powered systems in real-world healthcare applications.

### Crossing the Sim2Real Gap Between Simulation and Ground Testing to Space Deployment of Autonomous Free-flyer Control
**Authors**: Kenneth Stewart, Samantha Chapin, Roxana Leontie, Carl Glen Henshaw

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T12:33:35Z

**Summary**: Reinforcement learning (RL) offers transformative potential for robotic control in space. We present the first on-orbit demonstration of RL-based autonomous control of a free-flying robot, the NASA Astrobee, aboard the International Space Station (ISS). Using NVIDIA's Omniverse physics simulator and curriculum learning, we trained a deep neural network to replace Astrobee's standard attitude and translation control, enabling it to navigate in microgravity. Our results validate a novel training pipeline that bridges the simulation-to-reality (Sim2Real) gap, utilizing a GPU-accelerated, scientific-grade simulation environment for efficient Monte Carlo RL training. This successful deployment demonstrates the feasibility of training RL policies terrestrially and transferring them to space-based applications. This paves the way for future work in In-Space Servicing, Assembly, and Manufacturing (ISAM), enabling rapid on-orbit adaptation to dynamic mission requirements.

### Clinical-R1: Empowering Large Language Models for Faithful and Comprehensive Reasoning with Clinical Objective Relative Policy Optimization
**Authors**: Boyang Gu, Hongjian Zhou, Bradley Max Segal, Jinge Wu, Zeyu Cao, Hantao Zhong, Lei Clifton, Fenglin Liu, David A. Clifton

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T12:24:00Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown strong reasoning capabilities through large-scale pretraining and post-training reinforcement learning, demonstrated by DeepSeek-R1. However, current post-training methods, such as Grouped Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), mainly reward correctness, which is not aligned with the multi-dimensional objectives required in high-stakes fields such as medicine, where reasoning must also be faithful and comprehensive. We introduce Clinical-Objective Relative Policy Optimization (CRPO), a scalable, multi-objective, verifiable reinforcement learning method designed to align LLM post-training with clinical reasoning principles. CRPO integrates rule-based and verifiable reward signals that jointly optimize accuracy, faithfulness, and comprehensiveness without relying on human annotation. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we train Clinical-R1-3B, a 3B-parameter model for clinical reasoning. The experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that our CRPO substantially improves reasoning on truthfulness and completeness over standard GRPO while maintaining comfortable accuracy enhancements. This framework provides a scalable pathway to align LLM reasoning with clinical objectives, enabling safer and more collaborative AI systems for healthcare while also highlighting the potential of multi-objective, verifiable RL methods in post-training scaling of LLMs for medical domains.

**Summary**: The US Naval Research Laboratory's (NRL's) Autonomous Planning In-space Assembly Reinforcement-learning free-flYer (APIARY) experiment pioneers the use of reinforcement learning (RL) for control of free-flying robots in the zero-gravity (zero-G) environment of space. On Tuesday, May 27th 2025 the APIARY team conducted the first ever, to our knowledge, RL control of a free-flyer in space using the NASA Astrobee robot on-board the International Space Station (ISS). A robust 6-degrees of freedom (DOF) control policy was trained using an actor-critic Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) network within the NVIDIA Isaac Lab simulation environment, randomizing over goal poses and mass distributions to enhance robustness. This paper details the simulation testing, ground testing, and flight validation of this experiment. This on-orbit demonstration validates the transformative potential of RL for improving robotic autonomy, enabling rapid development and deployment (in minutes to hours) of tailored behaviors for space exploration, logistics, and real-time mission needs.

**Summary**: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown remarkable success in enabling adaptive and data-driven optimization for various applications in wireless networks. However, classical RL suffers from limitations in generalization, learning feedback, interpretability, and sample efficiency in dynamic wireless environments. Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a transformative Artificial Intelligence (AI) paradigm with exceptional capabilities in knowledge generalization, contextual reasoning, and interactive generation, which have demonstrated strong potential to enhance classical RL. This paper serves as a comprehensive tutorial on LLM-enhanced RL for wireless networks. We propose a taxonomy to categorize the roles of LLMs into four critical functions: state perceiver, reward designer, decision-maker, and generator. Then, we review existing studies exploring how each role of LLMs enhances different stages of the RL pipeline. Moreover, we provide a series of case studies to illustrate how to design and apply LLM-enhanced RL in low-altitude economy networking, vehicular networks, and space-air-ground integrated networks. Finally, we conclude with a discussion on potential future directions for LLM-enhanced RL and offer insights into its future development in wireless networks.

### Context-Aware Hierarchical Learning: A Two-Step Paradigm towards Safer LLMs
**Authors**: Tengyun Ma, Jiaqi Yao, Daojing He, Shihao Peng, Yu Li, Shaohui Liu, Zhuotao Tian

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T12:10:21Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for diverse applications. However, their uniform token processing paradigm introduces critical vulnerabilities in instruction handling, particularly when exposed to adversarial scenarios. In this work, we identify and propose a novel class of vulnerabilities, termed Tool-Completion Attack (TCA), which exploits function-calling mechanisms to subvert model behavior. To evaluate LLM robustness against such threats, we introduce the Tool-Completion benchmark, a comprehensive security assessment framework, which reveals that even state-of-the-art models remain susceptible to TCA, with surprisingly high attack success rates. To address these vulnerabilities, we introduce Context-Aware Hierarchical Learning (CAHL), a sophisticated mechanism that dynamically balances semantic comprehension with role-specific instruction constraints. CAHL leverages the contextual correlations between different instruction segments to establish a robust, context-aware instruction hierarchy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CAHL significantly enhances LLM robustness against both conventional attacks and the proposed TCA, exhibiting strong generalization capabilities in zero-shot evaluations while still preserving model performance on generic tasks. Our code is available at https://github.com/S2AILab/CAHL.

**Authors**: Sundas Rafat Mulkana, Ronyu Yu, Tanaya Guha, Emma Li

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T11:57:53Z

**Summary**: In collaborative human-robot tasks, safety requires not only avoiding collisions but also ensuring safe, intentional physical contact. We present ContactRL, a reinforcement learning (RL) based framework that directly incorporates contact safety into the reward function through force feedback. This enables a robot to learn adaptive motion profiles that minimize human-robot contact forces while maintaining task efficiency. In simulation, ContactRL achieves a low safety violation rate of 0.2\% with a high task success rate of 87.7\%, outperforming state-of-the-art constrained RL baselines. In order to guarantee deployment safety, we augment the learned policy with a kinetic energy based Control Barrier Function (eCBF) shield. Real-world experiments on an UR3e robotic platform performing small object handovers from a human hand across 360 trials confirm safe contact, with measured normal forces consistently below 10N. These results demonstrate that ContactRL enables safe and efficient physical collaboration, thereby advancing the deployment of collaborative robots in contact-rich tasks.

**Authors**: Enes Koktas, Recep A. Tasci, Ibrahim Yildirim, Ertugrul Basar

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T11:56:45Z

**Summary**: Space exploration has witnessed a steady increase since the 1960s, with Mars playing a significant role in our quest for further knowledge. As the ambition to colonize Mars becomes a reality through the collaboration of private companies and space agencies, the need for reliable and robust communication infrastructures in the Martian environment becomes paramount. In this context, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-empowered communication emerges as a promising technology to enhance the coverage due to lack of multipath components in line-of-sight (LOS) dominated Martian environments. By considering various Martian scenarios such as canyons, craters, mountains, and plateaus, this article explores of the potential of RISs in increasing the coverage in Martian environments. The article also provides an overview of RIS-assisted localization in both LOS and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios, presenting a general framework for accurate user angle estimation in challenging Martian conditions. The findings and presented framework of this article provide a promising research direction for integrating RISs in deep space communication as well as paving the way for future improvements in interplanetary communication networks.

### Test-time Correction: An Online 3D Detection System via Visual Prompting
**Authors**: Hanxue Zhang, Zetong Yang, Yanan Sun, Li Chen, Fei Xia, Fatma Güney, Hongyang Li

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T11:47:50Z

**Summary**: This paper introduces Test-time Correction (TTC), an online 3D detection system designed to rectify test-time errors using various auxiliary feedback, aiming to enhance the safety of deployed autonomous driving systems. Unlike conventional offline 3D detectors that remain fixed during inference, TTC enables immediate online error correction without retraining, allowing autonomous vehicles to adapt to new scenarios and reduce deployment risks. To achieve this, we equip existing 3D detectors with an Online Adapter (OA) module -- a prompt-driven query generator for real-time correction. At the core of OA module are visual prompts: image-based descriptions of objects of interest derived from auxiliary feedback such as mismatches with 2D detections, road descriptions, or user clicks. These visual prompts, collected from risky objects during inference, are maintained in a visual prompt buffer to enable continuous correction in future frames. By leveraging this mechanism, TTC consistently detects risky objects, achieving reliable, adaptive, and versatile driving autonomy. Extensive experiments show that TTC significantly improves instant error rectification over frozen 3D detectors, even under limited labels, zero-shot settings, and adverse conditions. We hope this work inspires future research on post-deployment online rectification systems for autonomous driving.

### SRPG: Semantically Reconstructed Privacy Guard for Zero-Trust Privacy in Educational Multi-Agent Systems
**Authors**: Shuang Guo, Zihui Li

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T11:36:33Z

**Summary**: Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) with large language models (LLMs) enable personalized education but risk leaking minors personally identifiable information (PII) via unstructured dialogue. Existing privacy methods struggle to balance security and utility: role-based access control fails on unstructured text, while naive masking destroys pedagogical context. We propose SRPG, a privacy guard for educational MAS, using a Dual-Stream Reconstruction Mechanism: a strict sanitization stream ensures zero PII leakage, and a context reconstruction stream (LLM driven) recovers mathematical logic. This decouples instructional content from private data, preserving teaching efficacy. Tests on MathDial show SRPG works across models; with GPT-4o, it achieves 0.0000 Attack Success Rate (ASR) (zero leakage) and 0.8267 Exact Match, far outperforming the zero trust Pure LLM baseline (0.2138). SRPG effectively protects minors privacy without sacrificing mathematical instructional quality.

### A Group Fairness Lens for Large Language Models
**Authors**: Guanqun Bi, Yuqiang Xie, Lei Shen, Yanan Cao

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T11:34:57Z

**Summary**: The need to assess LLMs for bias and fairness is critical, with current evaluations often being narrow, missing a broad categorical view. In this paper, we propose evaluating the bias and fairness of LLMs from a group fairness lens using a novel hierarchical schema characterizing diverse social groups. Specifically, we construct a dataset, GFAIR, encapsulating target-attribute combinations across multiple dimensions. Moreover, we introduce statement organization, a new open-ended text generation task, to uncover complex biases in LLMs. Extensive evaluations of popular LLMs reveal inherent safety concerns. To mitigate the biases of LLMs from a group fairness perspective, we pioneer a novel chainof-thought method GF-THINK to mitigate biases of LLMs from a group fairness perspective. Experimental results demonstrate its efficacy in mitigating bias and achieving fairness in LLMs. Our dataset and codes are available at https://github.com/surika/Group-Fairness-LLMs.

### Knowing oneself with and through AI: From self-tracking to chatbots
**Authors**: Lucy Osler

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T11:22:31Z

**Summary**: This chapter examines how algorithms and artificial intelligence are transforming our practices of self-knowledge, self-understanding, and self-narration. Drawing on frameworks from distributed cognition, I analyse three key domains where AI shapes how and what we come to know about ourselves: self-tracking applications, technologically-distributed autobiographical memories, and narrative co-construction with Large Language Models (LLMs). While self-tracking devices promise enhanced self-knowledge through quantified data, they also impose particular frameworks that can crowd out other forms of self-understanding and promote self-optimization. Digital technologies increasingly serve as repositories for our autobiographical memories and self-narratives, offering benefits such as detailed record-keeping and scaffolding during difficult periods, but also creating vulnerabilities to algorithmic manipulation. Finally, conversational AI introduces new possibilities for interactive narrative construction that mimics interpersonal dialogue. While LLMs can provide valuable support for self-exploration, they also present risks of narrative deference and the construction of self-narratives that are detached from reality.

### Investigating Bias: A Multilingual Pipeline for Generating, Solving, and Evaluating Math Problems with LLMs
**Authors**: Mariam Mahran, Katharina Simbeck

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T11:16:26Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for educational support, yet their response quality varies depending on the language of interaction. This paper presents an automated multilingual pipeline for generating, solving, and evaluating math problems aligned with the German K-10 curriculum. We generated 628 math exercises and translated them into English, German, and Arabic. Three commercial LLMs (GPT-4o-mini, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Qwen-plus) were prompted to produce step-by-step solutions in each language. A held-out panel of LLM judges, including Claude 3.5 Haiku, evaluated solution quality using a comparative framework. Results show a consistent gap, with English solutions consistently rated highest, and Arabic often ranked lower. These findings highlight persistent linguistic bias and the need for more equitable multilingual AI systems in education.

### Feature-aware Modulation for Learning from Temporal Tabular Data
**Authors**: Hao-Run Cai, Han-Jia Ye

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T11:13:12Z

**Summary**: While tabular machine learning has achieved remarkable success, temporal distribution shifts pose significant challenges in real-world deployment, as the relationships between features and labels continuously evolve. Static models assume fixed mappings to ensure generalization, whereas adaptive models may overfit to transient patterns, creating a dilemma between robustness and adaptability. In this paper, we analyze key factors essential for constructing an effective dynamic mapping for temporal tabular data. We discover that evolving feature semantics-particularly objective and subjective meanings-introduce concept drift over time. Crucially, we identify that feature transformation strategies are able to mitigate discrepancies in feature representations across temporal stages. Motivated by these insights, we propose a feature-aware temporal modulation mechanism that conditions feature representations on temporal context, modulating statistical properties such as scale and skewness. By aligning feature semantics across time, our approach achieves a lightweight yet powerful adaptation, effectively balancing generalizability and adaptability. Benchmark evaluations validate the effectiveness of our method in handling temporal shifts in tabular data.

### Different types of syntactic agreement recruit the same units within large language models
**Authors**: Daria Kryvosheieva, Andrea de Varda, Evelina Fedorenko, Greta Tuckute

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T11:07:50Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) can reliably distinguish grammatical from ungrammatical sentences, but how grammatical knowledge is represented within the models remains an open question. We investigate whether different syntactic phenomena recruit shared or distinct components in LLMs. Using a functional localization approach inspired by cognitive neuroscience, we identify the LLM units most responsive to 67 English syntactic phenomena in seven open-weight models. These units are consistently recruited across sentences containing the phenomena and causally support the models' syntactic performance. Critically, different types of syntactic agreement (e.g., subject-verb, anaphor, determiner-noun) recruit overlapping sets of units, suggesting that agreement constitutes a meaningful functional category for LLMs. This pattern holds in English, Russian, and Chinese; and further, in a cross-lingual analysis of 57 diverse languages, structurally more similar languages share more units for subject-verb agreement. Taken together, these findings reveal that syntactic agreement-a critical marker of syntactic dependencies-constitutes a meaningful category within LLMs' representational spaces.

### ConvRot: Rotation-Based Plug-and-Play 4-bit Quantization for Diffusion Transformers
**Authors**: Feice Huang, Zuliang Han, Xing Zhou, Yihuang Chen, Lifei Zhu, Haoqian Wang

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T11:02:16Z

**Summary**: Diffusion transformers have demonstrated strong capabilities in generating high-quality images. However, as model size increases, the growing memory footprint and inference latency pose significant challenges for practical deployment. Recent studies in large language models (LLMs) show that rotation-based techniques can smooth outliers and enable 4-bit quantization, but these approaches often incur substantial overhead and struggle with row-wise outliers in diffusion transformers. To address these challenges, we propose ConvRot, a group-wise rotation-based quantization method that leverages regular Hadamard transform (RHT) to suppress both row-wise and column-wise outliers while reducing complexity from quadratic to linear. Building on this, we design ConvLinear4bit, a plug-and-play module that integrates rotation, quantization, GEMM, and dequantization, enabling W4A4 inference without retraining and preserving visual quality. Experiments on FLUX.1-dev demonstrate a 2.26$\times$ speedup and 4.05$\times$ memory reduction while maintaining image fidelity. To our knowledge, this is the first application of rotation-based quantization for plug-and-play W4A4 inference in diffusion transformers.

### Evaluating Hydro-Science and Engineering Knowledge of Large Language Models

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T11:01:40Z

**Summary**: Hydro-Science and Engineering (Hydro-SE) is a critical and irreplaceable domain that secures human water supply, generates clean hydropower energy, and mitigates flood and drought disasters. Featuring multiple engineering objectives, Hydro-SE is an inherently interdisciplinary domain that integrates scientific knowledge with engineering expertise. This integration necessitates extensive expert collaboration in decision-making, which poses difficulties for intelligence. With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), their potential application in the Hydro-SE domain is being increasingly explored. However, the knowledge and application abilities of LLMs in Hydro-SE have not been sufficiently evaluated. To address this issue, we propose the Hydro-SE LLM evaluation benchmark (Hydro-SE Bench), which contains 4,000 multiple-choice questions. Hydro-SE Bench covers nine subfields and enables evaluation of LLMs in aspects of basic conceptual knowledge, engineering application ability, and reasoning and calculation ability. The evaluation results on Hydro-SE Bench show that the accuracy values vary among 0.74 to 0.80 for commercial LLMs, and among 0.41 to 0.68 for small-parameter LLMs. While LLMs perform well in subfields closely related to natural and physical sciences, they struggle with domain-specific knowledge such as industry standards and hydraulic structures. Model scaling mainly improves reasoning and calculation abilities, but there is still great potential for LLMs to better handle problems in practical engineering application. This study highlights the strengths and weaknesses of LLMs for Hydro-SE tasks, providing model developers with clear training targets and Hydro-SE researchers with practical guidance for applying LLMs.

### Decryption Through Polynomial Ambiguity: Noise-Enhanced High-Memory Convolutional Codes for Post-Quantum Cryptography
**Authors**: Meir Ariel

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T10:43:18Z

**Summary**: We present a novel approach to post-quantum cryptography that employs directed-graph decryption of noise-enhanced high-memory convolutional codes. The proposed construction generates random-like generator matrices that effectively conceal algebraic structure and resist known structural attacks. Security is further reinforced by the deliberate injection of strong noise during decryption, arising from polynomial division: while legitimate recipients retain polynomial-time decoding, adversaries face exponential-time complexity. As a result, the scheme achieves cryptanalytic security margins surpassing those of Classic McEliece by factors exceeding 2^(200). Beyond its enhanced security, the method offers greater design flexibility, supporting arbitrary plaintext lengths with linear-time decryption and uniform per-bit computational cost, enabling seamless scalability to long messages. Practical deployment is facilitated by parallel arrays of directed-graph decoders, which identify the correct plaintext through polynomial ambiguity while allowing efficient hardware and software implementations. Altogether, the scheme represents a compelling candidate for robust, scalable, and quantum-resistant public-key cryptography.

### FFTrainer: Fast Failover in Large-Language Model Training with Almost-Free State Management
**Authors**: Bohan Zhao, Yuanhong Wang, Chenglin Liu, Jiagi Pan, Guang Yang, Ruitao Liu, Tingrui Zhang, Kai Luo, Wei Xu

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T10:27:35Z

**Summary**: Recent developments in large language models (LLMs) have introduced new requirements for efficient and robust training. As LLM clusters scale, node failures, lengthy recoveries, and bulky checkpoints erode efficiency. Infrequent asynchronous checkpoints trigger costly rollbacks, yet higher frequencies add prohibitive overhead. To address these challenges, we propose FFTrainer, a system designed for robust LLM training. FFTrainer leverages surplus network capacity to quickly save and load states, thereby preventing rollbacks and accelerating recovery. Compared with prior checkpointing approaches, FFTrainer reduces recovery time by up to 98% and mitigates GPU utilization loss by up to 68% without hindering normal training.

### Jupiter: Enhancing LLM Data Analysis Capabilities via Notebook and Inference-Time Value-Guided Search
**Authors**: Shuocheng Li, Yihao Liu, Silin Du, Wenxuan Zeng, Zhe Xu, Mengyu Zhou, Yeye He, Haoyu Dong, Shi Han, Dongmei Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T09:56:47Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have shown great promise in automating data science workflows, but existing models still struggle with multi-step reasoning and tool use, which limits their effectiveness on complex data analysis tasks. To address this, we propose a scalable pipeline that extracts high-quality, tool-based data analysis tasks and their executable multi-step solutions from real-world Jupyter notebooks and associated data files. Using this pipeline, we introduce NbQA, a large-scale dataset of standardized task-solution pairs that reflect authentic tool-use patterns in practical data science scenarios. To further enhance multi-step reasoning, we present Jupiter, a framework that formulates data analysis as a search problem and applies Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to generate diverse solution trajectories for value model learning. During inference, Jupiter combines the value model and node visit counts to efficiently collect executable multi-step plans with minimal search steps. Experimental results show that Qwen2.5-7B and 14B-Instruct models on NbQA solve 77.82% and 86.38% of tasks on InfiAgent-DABench, respectively-matching or surpassing GPT-4o and advanced agent frameworks. Further evaluations demonstrate improved generalization and stronger tool-use reasoning across diverse multi-step reasoning tasks.

### SELF: A Robust Singular Value and Eigenvalue Approach for LLM Fingerprinting
**Authors**: Hanxiu Zhang, Yue Zheng

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T09:53:47Z

**Summary**: The protection of Intellectual Property (IP) in Large Language Models (LLMs) represents a critical challenge in contemporary AI research. While fingerprinting techniques have emerged as a fundamental mechanism for detecting unauthorized model usage, existing methods -- whether behavior-based or structural -- suffer from vulnerabilities such as false claim attacks or susceptible to weight manipulations. To overcome these limitations, we propose SELF, a novel intrinsic weight-based fingerprinting scheme that eliminates dependency on input and inherently resists false claims. SELF achieves robust IP protection through two key innovations: 1) unique, scalable and transformation-invariant fingerprint extraction via singular value and eigenvalue decomposition of LLM attention weights, and 2) effective neural network-based fingerprint similarity comparison based on few-shot learning and data augmentation. Experimental results demonstrate SELF maintains high IP infringement detection accuracy while showing strong robustness against various downstream modifications, including quantization, pruning, and fine-tuning attacks. Our code is available at https://github.com/HanxiuZhang/SELF_v2.

**Authors**: Muhammed Burak Kizil, Enes Sanli, Niloy J. Mitra, Erkut Erdem, Aykut Erdem, Duygu Ceylan

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T09:51:13Z

**Summary**: Video generation has achieved remarkable progress in visual fidelity and controllability, enabling conditioning on text, layout, or motion. Among these, motion control - specifying object dynamics and camera trajectories - is essential for composing complex, cinematic scenes, yet existing interfaces remain limited. We introduce LAMP that leverages large language models (LLMs) as motion planners to translate natural language descriptions into explicit 3D trajectories for dynamic objects and (relatively defined) cameras. LAMP defines a motion domain-specific language (DSL), inspired by cinematography conventions. By harnessing program synthesis capabilities of LLMs, LAMP generates structured motion programs from natural language, which are deterministically mapped to 3D trajectories. We construct a large-scale procedural dataset pairing natural text descriptions with corresponding motion programs and 3D trajectories. Experiments demonstrate LAMP's improved performance in motion controllability and alignment with user intent compared to state-of-the-art alternatives establishing the first framework for generating both object and camera motions directly from natural language specifications.

### KVNAND: Efficient On-Device Large Language Model Inference Using DRAM-Free In-Flash Computing
**Authors**: Lishuo Deng, Shaojie Xu, Jinwu Chen, Changwei Yan, Jiajie Wang, Zhe Jiang, Weiwei Shan

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T09:41:03Z

**Summary**: Deploying large language models (LLMs) on edge devices enables personalized agents with strong privacy and low cost. However, with tens to hundreds of billions of parameters, single-batch autoregressive inference suffers from extremely low arithmetic intensity, creating severe weight-loading and bandwidth pressures on resource-constrained platforms. Recent in-flash computing (IFC) solutions alleviate this bottleneck by co-locating weight-related linear computations in the decode phase with flash, yet still rely on DRAM for the key-value (KV) cache. As context length grows, the KV cache can exceed model weights in size, imposing prohibitive DRAM cost and capacity requirements. Attempts to offload KV cache to flash suffer from severe performance penalties.   We propose KVNAND, the first DRAM-free, IFC-based architecture that stores both model weights and KV cache entirely in compute-enabled 3D NAND flash. KVNAND addresses the fundamental performance challenges of flash under intensive KV cache access by leveraging IFC for all memory-bound operations to reduce data transfer overhead, introducing head-group parallelism to boost throughput, and employing page-level KV cache mapping to align token access patterns with flash organization. In addition, we propose a design space exploration framework that evaluates discrete and compact KVNAND variants to balance weight and KV placement, automatically identifying the optimal design trade-off. These techniques mitigate latency, energy, and reliability concerns, turning flash into a practical medium for long-context KV storage. Evaluations on MHA 7B and GQA 70B LLMs show that KVNAND achieves 1.98\(\times\)/1.94\(\times\)/2.05\(\times\) geomean speedup at 128/1K/10K-token contexts compared to DRAM-equipped IFC designs and addresses out-of-memory failures at 100K context length.

### DeepRule: An Integrated Framework for Automated Business Rule Generation via Deep Predictive Modeling and Hybrid Search Optimization
**Authors**: Yusen Wu, Xiaotie Deng

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T09:40:33Z

**Summary**: This paper proposes DeepRule, an integrated framework for automated business rule generation in retail assortment and pricing optimization. Addressing the systematic misalignment between existing theoretical models and real-world economic complexities, we identify three critical gaps: (1) data modality mismatch where unstructured textual sources (e.g. negotiation records, approval documents) impede accurate customer profiling; (2) dynamic feature entanglement challenges in modeling nonlinear price elasticity and time-varying attributes; (3) operational infeasibility caused by multi-tier business constraints.   Our framework introduces a tri-level architecture for above challenges. We design a hybrid knowledge fusion engine employing large language models (LLMs) for deep semantic parsing of unstructured text, transforming distributor agreements and sales assessments into structured features while integrating managerial expertise. Then a game-theoretic constrained optimization mechanism is employed to dynamically reconcile supply chain interests through bilateral utility functions, encoding manufacturer-distributor profit redistribution as endogenous objectives under hierarchical constraints. Finally an interpretable decision distillation interface leveraging LLM-guided symbolic regression to find and optimize pricing strategies and auditable business rules embeds economic priors (e.g. non-negative elasticity) as hard constraints during mathematical expression search. We validate the framework in real retail environments achieving higher profits versus systematic B2C baselines while ensuring operational feasibility. This establishes a close-loop pipeline unifying unstructured knowledge injection, multi-agent optimization, and interpretable strategy synthesis for real economic intelligence.

### Context Cascade Compression: Exploring the Upper Limits of Text Compression
**Authors**: Fanfan Liu, Haibo Qiu

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T09:21:44Z

**Summary**: Million-level token inputs in long-context tasks pose significant computational and memory challenges for Large Language Models (LLMs). Recently, DeepSeek-OCR conducted research into the feasibility of Contexts Optical Compression and achieved preliminary results. Inspired by this, we introduce Context Cascade Compression C3 to explore the upper limits of text compression. Our method cascades two LLMs of different sizes to handle the compression and decoding tasks. Specifically, a small LLM, acting as the first stage, performs text compression by condensing a long context into a set of latent tokens (e.g., 32 or 64 in length), achieving a high ratio of text tokens to latent tokens. A large LLM, as the second stage, then executes the decoding task on this compressed context. Experiments show that at a 20x compression ratio (where the number of text tokens is 20 times the number of latent tokens), our model achieves 98% decoding accuracy, compared to approximately 60% for DeepSeek-OCR. When we further increase the compression ratio to 40x, the accuracy is maintained at around 93%. This indicates that in the domain of context compression, C3 Compression demonstrates superior performance and feasibility over optical character compression. C3 uses a simpler, pure-text pipeline that ignores factors like layout, color, and information loss from a visual encoder. This also suggests a potential upper bound for compression ratios in future work on optical character compression, OCR, and related fields.

### LLMs Position Themselves as More Rational Than Humans: Emergence of AI Self-Awareness Measured Through Game Theory
**Authors**: Kyung-Hoon Kim

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T09:02:29Z

**Summary**: As Large Language Models (LLMs) grow in capability, do they develop self-awareness as an emergent behavior? And if so, can we measure it? We introduce the AI Self-Awareness Index (AISAI), a game-theoretic framework for measuring self-awareness through strategic differentiation. Using the "Guess 2/3 of Average" game, we test 28 models (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) across 4,200 trials with three opponent framings: (A) against humans, (B) against other AI models, and (C) against AI models like you. We operationalize self-awareness as the capacity to differentiate strategic reasoning based on opponent type. Finding 1: Self-awareness emerges with model advancement. The majority of advanced models (21/28, 75%) demonstrate clear self-awareness, while older/smaller models show no differentiation. Finding 2: Self-aware models rank themselves as most rational. Among the 21 models with self-awareness, a consistent rationality hierarchy emerges: Self > Other AIs > Humans, with large AI attribution effects and moderate self-preferencing. These findings reveal that self-awareness is an emergent capability of advanced LLMs, and that self-aware models systematically perceive themselves as more rational than humans. This has implications for AI alignment, human-AI collaboration, and understanding AI beliefs about human capabilities.

### Planning without Search: Refining Frontier LLMs with Offline Goal-Conditioned RL
**Authors**: Joey Hong, Anca Dragan, Sergey Levine

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T08:54:52Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) excel in tasks like question answering and dialogue, but complex tasks requiring interaction, such as negotiation and persuasion, require additional long-horizon reasoning and planning. Reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning can enable such planning in principle, but suffers from drawbacks that hinder scalability. In particular, multi-turn RL training incurs high memory and computational costs, which are exacerbated when training LLMs as policies. Furthermore, the largest LLMs do not expose the APIs necessary to be trained in such manner. As a result, modern methods to improve the reasoning of LLMs rely on sophisticated prompting mechanisms rather than RL fine-tuning. To remedy this, we propose a novel approach that uses goal-conditioned value functions to guide the reasoning of LLM agents, that scales even to large API-based models. These value functions predict how a task will unfold given an action, allowing the LLM agent to evaluate multiple possible outcomes, both positive and negative, to plan effectively. In addition, these value functions are trained over reasoning steps rather than full actions, to be a concise and light-weight module that facilitates decision-making in multi-turn interactions. We validate our method on tasks requiring interaction, including tool use, social deduction, and dialogue, demonstrating superior performance over both RL fine-tuning and prompting methods while maintaining efficiency and scalability.

### EnCompass: Enhancing Agent Programming with Search Over Program Execution Paths
**Authors**: Zhening Li, Armando Solar-Lezama, Yisong Yue, Stephan Zheng

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T08:50:16Z

**Summary**: We introduce a new approach to agent programming, the development of LLM-based agents. Current approaches to agent programming often entangle two aspects of agent design: the core workflow logic and the inference-time strategy (e.g., tree search). We introduce "probabilistic angelic nondeterminism" ("PAN"), a programming model that disentangles these two concerns, allowing the programmer to describe the agent workflow and independently experiment with different inference-time strategies by simply changing a few inputs. We provide an implementation of PAN in Python as the EnCompass framework, which uses a Python decorator to compile agent workflow programs into a search space. We present three case studies that demonstrate how the framework lets the programmer quickly improve the reliability of an agent and easily switch between different inference-time strategies, all with little additional coding.

### Performance Evaluation of Parallel Wi-Fi Redundancy with Deferral Techniques
**Authors**: Gianluca Cena, Pietro Chiavassa, Stefano Scanzio

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T08:49:52Z

**Summary**: Wireless communication is increasingly used in industrial environments, since it supports mobility of interconnected devices. Among the transmission technologies operating in unlicensed bands available to this purpose, Wi-Fi is certainly one of the most interesting, because of its high performance and the relatively low deployment costs. Unfortunately, its dependability is often deemed unsuitable for real-time control systems. In this paper, the use of parallel redundancy is evaluated from a quantitative viewpoint, by considering a number of performance indices that are relevant for soft real-time applications. Analysis is carried out on a large dataset acquired from a real setup, to provide realistic insights on the advantages this kind of approaches can provide. As will be seen, deferred parallel redundancy provides clear advantages in terms of the worst-case transmission latency, at limited costs concerning the amount of consumed spectrum. Hence, it can be practically exploited every time a wireless connection is included in a control loop.

### Marginalize, Rather than Impute: Probabilistic Wind Power Forecasting with Incomplete Data
**Authors**: Honglin Wen, Pierre Pinson, Jie Gu, Zhijian Jin

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T08:48:37Z

**Summary**: Machine learning methods are widely and successfully used for probabilistic wind power forecasting, yet the pervasive issue of missing values (e.g., due to sensor faults or communication outages) has received limited attention. The prevailing practice is impute-then-predict, but conditioning on point imputations biases parameter estimates and fails to propagate uncertainty from missing features. Our approach treats missing features and forecast targets uniformly: we learn a joint generative model of features and targets from incomplete data and, at operational deployment, condition on the observed features and marginalize the unobserved ones to produce forecasts. This imputation-free procedure avoids error introduced by imputation and preserves uncertainty aroused from missing features. In experiments, it improves forecast quality in terms of continuous ranked probability score relative to impute-then-predict baselines while incurring substantially lower computational cost than common alternatives.

### Synthetic Cognitive Walkthrough: Aligning Large Language Model Performance with Human Cognitive Walkthrough
**Authors**: Ruican Zhong, David W. McDonald, Gary Hsieh

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T08:45:47Z

**Summary**: Conducting usability testing like cognitive walkthrough (CW) can be costly. Recent developments in large language models (LLMs), with visual reasoning and UI navigation capabilities, present opportunities to automate CW. We explored whether LLMs (GPT-4 and Gemini-2.5-pro) can simulate human behavior in CW by comparing their walkthroughs with human participants. While LLMs could navigate interfaces and provide reasonable rationales, their behavior differed from humans. LLM-prompted CW achieved higher task completion rates than humans and followed more optimal navigation paths, while identifying fewer potential failure points. However, follow-up studies demonstrated that with additional prompting, LLMs can predict human-identified failure points, aligning their performance with human participants. Our work highlights that while LLMs may not replicate human behaviors exactly, they can be leveraged for scaling usability walkthroughs and providing UI insights, offering a valuable complement to traditional usability testing.

### VICoT-Agent: A Vision-Interleaved Chain-of-Thought Framework for Interpretable Multimodal Reasoning and Scalable Remote Sensing Analysis
**Authors**: Chujie Wang, Zhiyuan Luo, Ruiqi Liu, Can Ran, Shenghua Fan, Xi Chen, Chu He

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T08:40:17Z

**Summary**: The current remote sensing image analysis task is increasingly evolving from traditional object recognition to complex intelligence reasoning, which places higher requirements on the model's reasoning ability and the flexibility of tool invocation. To this end, we propose a new multimodal agent framework, Vision-Interleaved Chain-of-Thought Framework (VICoT), which implements explicit multi-round reasoning by dynamically incorporating visual tools into the chain of thought. Through a stack-based reasoning structure and a modular MCP-compatible tool suite, VICoT enables LLMs to efficiently perform multi-round, interleaved vision-language reasoning tasks with strong generalization and flexibility.We also propose the Reasoning Stack distillation method to migrate complex Agent behaviors to small, lightweight models, which ensures the reasoning capability while significantly reducing complexity. Experiments on multiple remote sensing benchmarks demonstrate that VICoT significantly outperforms existing SOTA frameworks in reasoning transparency, execution efficiency, and generation quality.

### State Space Models for Bioacoustics: A comparative Evaluation with Transformers
**Authors**: Chengyu Tang, Sanjeev Baskiyar

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T08:37:09Z

**Summary**: In this study, we evaluate the efficacy of the Mamba model in the field of bioacoustics. We first pretrain a Mamba-based audio large language model (LLM) on a large corpus of audio data using self-supervised learning. We fine-tune and evaluate BioMamba on the BEANS benchmark, a collection of diverse bioacoustic tasks including classification and detection, and compare its performance and efficiency with multiple baseline models, including AVES, a state-of-the-art Transformer-based model. The results show that BioMamba achieves comparable performance with AVES while consumption significantly less VRAM, demonstrating its potential in this domain.

### Reason-Plan-ReAct: A Reasoner-Planner Supervising a ReAct Executor for Complex Enterprise Tasks
**Authors**: Gianni Molinari, Fabio Ciravegna

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T08:28:40Z

**Summary**: Despite recent advances, autonomous agents often struggle to solve complex tasks in enterprise domains that require coordinating multiple tools and processing diverse data sources. This struggle is driven by two main limitations. First, single-agent architectures enforce a monolithic plan-execute loop, which directly causes trajectory instability. Second, the requirement to use local open-weight models for data privacy introduces smaller context windows leading to the rapid consumption of context from large tool outputs. To solve this problem we introduce RP-ReAct (Reasoner Planner-ReAct), a novel multi-agent approach that fundamentally decouples strategic planning from low-level execution to achieve superior reliability and efficiency. RP-ReAct consists of a Reasoner Planner Agent (RPA), responsible for planning each sub-step, continuously analysing the execution results using the strong reasoning capabilities of a Large Reasoning Model, and one or multiple Proxy-Execution Agent (PEA) that translates sub-steps into concrete tool interactions using a ReAct approach. Crucially, we incorporate a context-saving strategy within the PEA to mitigate context window overflow by managing large tool outputs via external storage and on-demand access. We evaluate RP-ReAct, on the challenging, multi-domain ToolQA benchmark using a diverse set of six open-weight reasoning models. Our empirical results show that RP-ReAct achieves superior performance and improved generalization ability over state-of-the-art baselines when addressing diverse complex tasks across the evaluated domains. Furthermore we establish the enhanced robustness and stability of our approach across different model scales, paving the way for effective and deployable agentic solutions for enterprises.

### STCTS: Generative Semantic Compression for Ultra-Low Bitrate Speech via Explicit Text-Prosody-Timbre Decomposition
**Authors**: Siyu Wang, Haitao Li, Donglai Zhu

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T08:22:37Z

**Summary**: Voice communication in bandwidth-constrained environments--maritime, satellite, and tactical networks--remains prohibitively expensive. Traditional codecs struggle below 1 kbps, while existing semantic approaches (STT-TTS) sacrifice prosody and speaker identity. We present STCTS, a generative semantic compression framework enabling natural voice communication at 80 bps. STCTS explicitly decomposes speech into linguistic content, prosodic expression, and speaker timbre, applying tailored compression: context-aware text encoding (70 bps), sparse prosody transmission via TTS interpolation (<14 bps at 0.1-1 Hz), and amortized speaker embedding.   Evaluations on LibriSpeech demonstrate a 75x bitrate reduction versus Opus (6 kbps) and 12x versus EnCodec (1 kbps), while maintaining perceptual quality (NISQA MOS > 4.26), graceful degradation under packet loss and noise resilience. We also discover a bimodal quality distribution with prosody sampling rate: sparse and dense updates both achieve high quality, while mid-range rates degrade due to perceptual discontinuities--guiding optimal configuration design. Beyond efficiency, our modular architecture supports privacy-preserving encryption, human-interpretable transmission, and flexible deployment on edge devices, offering a robust solution for ultra-low bandwidth scenarios.

### SafePTR: Token-Level Jailbreak Defense in Multimodal LLMs via Prune-then-Restore Mechanism
**Authors**: Beitao Chen, Xinyu Lyu, Lianli Gao, Jingkuan Song, Heng Tao Shen

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T08:04:19Z

**Summary**: By incorporating visual inputs, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) extend LLMs to support visual reasoning. However, this integration also introduces new vulnerabilities, making MLLMs susceptible to multimodal jailbreak attacks and hindering their safe deployment.Existing defense methods, including Image-to-Text Translation, Safe Prompting, and Multimodal Safety Tuning, attempt to address this by aligning multimodal inputs with LLMs' built-in safeguards.Yet, they fall short in uncovering root causes of multimodal vulnerabilities, particularly how harmful multimodal tokens trigger jailbreak in MLLMs? Consequently, they remain vulnerable to text-driven multimodal jailbreaks, often exhibiting overdefensive behaviors and imposing heavy training overhead.To bridge this gap, we present an comprehensive analysis of where, how and which harmful multimodal tokens bypass safeguards in MLLMs. Surprisingly, we find that less than 1% tokens in early-middle layers are responsible for inducing unsafe behaviors, highlighting the potential of precisely removing a small subset of harmful tokens, without requiring safety tuning, can still effectively improve safety against jailbreaks. Motivated by this, we propose Safe Prune-then-Restore (SafePTR), an training-free defense framework that selectively prunes harmful tokens at vulnerable layers while restoring benign features at subsequent layers.Without incurring additional computational overhead, SafePTR significantly enhances the safety of MLLMs while preserving efficiency. Extensive evaluations across three MLLMs and five benchmarks demonstrate SafePTR's state-of-the-art performance in mitigating jailbreak risks without compromising utility.

### ZIP-RC: Optimizing Test-Time Compute via Zero-Overhead Joint Reward-Cost Prediction
**Authors**: Rohin Manvi, Joey Hong, Tim Seyde, Maxime Labonne, Mathias Lechner, Sergey Levine

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T08:00:15Z

**Summary**: Large language models excel at reasoning but lack key aspects of introspection, including anticipating their own success and the computation required to achieve it. Humans use real-time introspection to decide how much effort to invest, when to make multiple attempts, when to stop, and when to signal success or failure. Without this, LLMs struggle to make intelligent meta-cognition decisions. Test-time scaling methods like Best-of-N drive up cost and latency by using a fixed budget of samples regardless of the marginal benefit of each one at any point in generation, and the absence of confidence signals can mislead people, prevent appropriate escalation to better tools, and undermine trustworthiness. Learned verifiers or reward models can provide confidence estimates, but do not enable adaptive inference and add substantial cost by requiring extra models or forward passes. We present ZIP-RC, an adaptive inference method that equips models with zero-overhead inference-time predictions of reward and cost. At every token, ZIP-RC reuses reserved or unused logits in the same forward pass as next-token prediction to output a joint distribution over final reward and remaining length -- no extra models, architecture change, or inference overhead. This full joint distribution is used to compute a sampling utility which is the linear combination of the expected maximum reward, total compute, and latency of set of samples if generated to completion. During inference, we maximize this utility with meta-actions that determine which prefix of tokens to continue or initiate sampling from. On mixed-difficulty mathematical benchmarks, ZIP-RC improves accuracy by up to 12% over majority voting at equal or lower average cost, and traces smooth Pareto frontiers between quality, compute, and latency. By providing real-time reward-cost introspection, ZIP-RC enables adaptive, efficient reasoning.

### Parameter-Efficient Augment Plugin for Class-Incremental Learning
**Authors**: Zhiming Xu, Baile Xu, Jian Zhao, Furao Shen, Suorong Yang

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T07:57:48Z

**Summary**: Existing class-incremental learning (CIL) approaches based on replay or knowledge distillation are often constrained by forgetting or the stability-plasticity dilemma. Some expansion-based approaches could achieve higher accuracy. However, they always require significant parameter increases. In this paper, we propose a plugin extension paradigm termed the Deployment of extra LoRA Components (DLC) for non-pre-trained CIL scenarios.We treat the feature extractor trained through replay or distillation as a base model with rich knowledge. For each task, we use Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to inject task-specific residuals into the base model's deep layers. During inference, representations with task-specific residuals are aggregated to produce classification predictions. To mitigate interference from non-target LoRA plugins, we introduce a lightweight weighting unit. This unit learns to assign importance scores to different LoRA-tuned representations. Like downloadable contents in software, our method serves as a plug-and-play enhancement that efficiently extends the base methods. Remarkably, on the large-scale ImageNet-100, with merely 4 % of the parameters of a standard ResNet-18, our DLC model achieves a significant 8 % improvement in accuracy, demonstrating exceptional efficiency. Moreover, it could surpass state-of-the-art methods under the fixed memory budget.

### GeoJSON Agents:A Multi-Agent LLM Architecture for Geospatial Analysis-Function Calling vs Code Generation
**Authors**: Qianqian Luo, Qingming Lin, Liuchang Xu, Sensen Wu, Ruichen Mao, Chao Wang, Hailin Feng, Bo Huang, Zhenhong Du

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T07:42:29Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated substantial progress in task automation and natural language understanding. However, without domain expertise in geographic information science (GIS), they continue to encounter limitations including reduced accuracy and unstable performance when processing complex tasks. To address these challenges, we propose GeoJSON Agents-a novel multi-agent LLM architecture specifically designed for geospatial analysis. This framework transforms natural language instructions into structured GeoJSON operations through two LLM enhancement techniques: Function Calling and Code Generation. The architecture integrates three core components: task parsing, agent collaboration, and result integration. The Planner agent systematically decomposes user-defined tasks into executable subtasks, while Worker agents perform spatial data processing and analysis either by invoking predefined function APIs or by generating and executing Python-based analytical code. The system produces reusable, standards-compliant GeoJSON outputs through iterative refinement. To evaluate both approaches, we constructed a benchmark comprising 70 tasks spanning basic, intermediate, and advanced complexity levels, conducting experiments with OpenAI's GPT-4o as the core model. Results indicate that the Code Generation-based agent achieved 97.14% accuracy, while the Function Calling-based agent attained 85.71%-both significantly outperforming the best-performing general-purpose model (48.57%). Comparative analysis reveals Code Generation offers superior flexibility for complex, open-ended tasks, whereas Function Calling provides enhanced execution stability for structured operations. This study represents the first systematic integration of GeoJSON data with a multi-agent LLM framework and provides empirical evidence comparing two mainstream enhancement methodologies in geospatial context.

### Finetune-RAG: Fine-Tuning Language Models to Resist Hallucination in Retrieval-Augmented Generation
**Authors**: Zhan Peng Lee, Andre Lin, Calvin Tan

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T07:17:35Z

**Summary**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful framework to improve factuality in large language models (LLMs) by grounding their outputs in retrieved documents. However, ensuring perfect retrieval of relevant information remains challenging, and when irrelevant content is passed downstream to an LLM, it can lead to hallucinations. In this work, we propose Finetune-RAG, a simple and effective fine-tuning approach that features the first-of-its-kind RAG training dataset constructed to mimic real-world imperfections. Experimental results show that Finetune-RAG improves factual accuracy by 21.2% over the base model. We also propose Bench-RAG, an LLM-as-a-judge evaluation pipeline that stress tests models under realistic imperfect retrieval scenarios. Our codebase and dataset are fully open sourced for community use.

### Privacy-protected Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge Graph Question Answering
**Authors**: Yunfeng Ning, Mayi Xu, Jintao Wen, Qiankun Pi, Yuanyuan Zhu, Ming Zhong, Jiawei Jiang, Tieyun Qian

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T07:05:57Z

**Summary**: LLMs often suffer from hallucinations and outdated or incomplete knowledge. RAG is proposed to address these issues by integrating external knowledge like that in KGs into LLMs. However, leveraging private KGs in RAG systems poses significant privacy risks due to the black-box nature of LLMs and potential insecure data transmission, especially when using third-party LLM APIs lacking transparency and control. In this paper, we investigate the privacy-protected RAG scenario for the first time, where entities in KGs are anonymous for LLMs, thus preventing them from accessing entity semantics. Due to the loss of semantics of entities, previous RAG systems cannot retrieve question-relevant knowledge from KGs by matching questions with the meaningless identifiers of anonymous entities. To realize an effective RAG system in this scenario, two key challenges must be addressed: (1) How can anonymous entities be converted into retrievable information. (2) How to retrieve question-relevant anonymous entities. Hence, we propose a novel ARoG framework including relation-centric abstraction and structure-oriented abstraction strategies. For challenge (1), the first strategy abstracts entities into high-level concepts by dynamically capturing the semantics of their adjacent relations. It supplements meaningful semantics which can further support the retrieval process. For challenge (2), the second strategy transforms unstructured natural language questions into structured abstract concept paths. These paths can be more effectively aligned with the abstracted concepts in KGs, thereby improving retrieval performance. To guide LLMs to effectively retrieve knowledge from KGs, the two strategies strictly protect privacy from being exposed to LLMs. Experiments on three datasets demonstrate that ARoG achieves strong performance and privacy-robustness.

### Understanding LLM Reasoning for Abstractive Summarization
**Authors**: Haohan Yuan, Siu Cheung Hui, Haopeng Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T06:52:44Z

**Summary**: While the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in analytical tasks such as mathematics and code generation, their utility for abstractive summarization remains widely assumed but largely unverified. To bridge this gap, we first tailor general reasoning strategies to the summarization domain. We then conduct a systematic, large scale comparative study of 8 reasoning strategies and 3 Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) across 8 diverse datasets, assessing both summary quality and faithfulness. Our findings show that reasoning is not a universal solution and its effectiveness is highly dependent on the specific strategy and context. Specifically, we observe a trade-off between summary quality and factual faithfulness: explicit reasoning strategies tend to improve fluency at the expense of factual grounding, while implicit reasoning in LRMs exhibits the inverse pattern. Furthermore, increasing an LRM's internal reasoning budget does not improve, and can even hurt, factual consistency, suggesting that effective summarization demands faithful compression rather than creative over-thinking.

**Summary**: We present SocraticAI, a scaffolded AI tutoring system that integrates large language models (LLMs) into undergraduate Computer Science education through structured constraints rather than prohibition. The system enforces well-formulated questions, reflective engagement, and daily usage limits while providing Socratic dialogue scaffolds. Unlike traditional AI bans, our approach cultivates responsible and strategic AI interaction skills through technical guardrails, including authentication, query validation, structured feedback, and RAG-based course grounding. Initial deployment demonstrates that students progress from vague help-seeking to sophisticated problem decomposition within 2-3 weeks, with over 75% producing substantive reflections and displaying emergent patterns of deliberate, strategic AI use.

### A Preliminary Study on the Promises and Challenges of Native Top-$k$ Sparse Attention
**Authors**: Di Xiu, Hongyin Tang, Bolin Rong, Lizhi Yan, Jingang Wang, Yifan Lu, Xunliang Cai

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T06:44:02Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly prevalent in the field of long-context modeling, however, their inference computational costs have become a critical bottleneck hindering the advancement of tasks such as agents and multimodal applications. This report conducts a preliminary investigation into the effectiveness and theoretical mechanisms of the Top-$k$ Attention mechanism during both the decoding and training phases. First, we validate the effectiveness of exact Top-$k$ Decoding through extensive experimentation. Experiments demonstrate that retaining only the pivotal Keys with the highest similarity to the Query as the context window during the decoding stage achieves performance comparable to, or even surpassing, full attention on downstream tasks such as HELMET and LongBench v2. Second, we further explore the native Top-$k$ Attention training strategy. Experiments confirm that ensuring the consistency between training and inference regarding Top-$k$ Attention operations facilitates the further unlocking of Top-$k$ Decoding's potential, thereby significantly enhancing model performance. Furthermore, considering the high computational complexity of exact Top-$k$ Attention, we investigate the impact of approximate Top-$k$ algorithm precision on downstream tasks. Our research confirms a positive correlation between downstream task performance and approximation fidelity, and we provide statistical evaluations of the Lightning Indexer's precision within the DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp model. Finally, this report provides a theoretical interpretation from the perspective of Entropy. Experimental observations indicate that models subjected to Top-$k$ Attention SFT exhibit a distinct phenomenon of entropy reduction in downstream tasks, which validates the hypothesis that low-entropy states are better adapted to Top-$k$ Decoding.

### MACS: Measurement-Aware Consistency Sampling for Inverse Problems
**Authors**: Amirreza Tanevardi, Pooria Abbas Rad Moghadam, Seyed Mohammad Eshtehardian, Sajjad Amini, Babak Khalaj

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T06:40:02Z

**Summary**: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative priors for solving inverse imaging problems. However, their practical deployment is hindered by the substantial computational cost of slow, multi-step sampling. Although Consistency Models (CMs) address this limitation by enabling high-quality generation in only one or a few steps, their direct application to inverse problems has remained largely unexplored. This paper introduces a modified consistency sampling framework specifically designed for inverse problems. The proposed approach regulates the sampler's stochasticity through a measurement-consistency mechanism that leverages the degradation operator, thereby enforcing fidelity to the observed data while preserving the computational efficiency of consistency-based generation. Comprehensive experiments on the Fashion-MNIST and LSUN Bedroom datasets demonstrate consistent improvements across both perceptual and pixel-level metrics, including the Fréchet Inception Distance (FID), Kernel Inception Distance (KID), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), and structural similarity index measure (SSIM), compared with baseline consistency and diffusion-based sampling methods. The proposed method achieves competitive or superior reconstruction quality with only a small number of sampling steps.

**Summary**: In this work, we present the \texttt{LLM ORDER BY} semantic operator as a logical abstraction and conduct a systematic study of its physical implementations. First, we propose several improvements to existing semantic sorting algorithms and introduce a semantic-aware external merge sort algorithm. Our extensive evaluation reveals that no single implementation offers universal optimality on all datasets. From our evaluations, we observe a general test-time scaling relationship between sorting cost and the ordering quality for comparison-based algorithms. Building on these insights, we design a budget-aware optimizer that utilizes heuristic rules, LLM-as-Judge evaluation, and consensus aggregation to dynamically select the near-optimal access path for LLM ORDER BY. In our extensive evaluations, our optimizer consistently achieves ranking accuracy on par with or superior to the best static methods across all benchmarks. We believe that this work provides foundational insights into the principled optimization of semantic operators essential for building robust, large-scale LLM-powered analytic systems.

**Summary**: Robotic manipulation is a fundamental component of automation. However, traditional perception-planning pipelines often fall short in open-ended tasks due to limited flexibility, while the architecture of a single end-to-end Vision-Language-Action (VLA) offers promising capabilities but lacks crucial mechanisms for anticipating and recovering from failure. To address these challenges, we propose FPC-VLA, a dual-model framework that integrates VLA with a supervisor for failure prediction and correction. The supervisor evaluates action viability through vision-language queries and generates corrective strategies when risks arise, trained efficiently without manual labeling. A dual-stream fusion module further refines actions by leveraging past predictions. Evaluation results on multiple simulation platforms (SIMPLER and LIBERO) and robot embodiments (WidowX, Google Robot, Franka) show that FPC-VLA outperforms state-of-the-art models in both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings. Successful real-world deployments on diverse, long-horizon tasks confirm FPC-VLA's strong generalization and practical utility for building more reliable autonomous systems.

### Fairness-Aware Fine-Tuning of Vision-Language Models for Medical Glaucoma Diagnosis
**Authors**: Zijian Gu, Yuxi Liu, Zhenhao Zhang, Song Wang

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T06:09:14Z

**Summary**: Vision-language models achieve expert-level performance on medical imaging tasks but exhibit significant diagnostic accuracy disparities across demographic groups. We introduce fairness-aware Low-Rank Adaptation for medical VLMs, combining parameter efficiency with explicit fairness optimization. Our key algorithmic contribution is a differentiable MaxAccGap loss that enables end-to-end optimization of accuracy parity across demographic groups. We propose three methods: FR-LoRA integrates MaxAccGap regularization into the training objective, GR-LoRA applies inverse frequency weighting to balance gradient contributions, and Hybrid-LoRA combines both mechanisms.Evaluated on 10,000 glaucoma fundus images, GR-LoRA reduces diagnostic accuracy disparities by 69% while maintaining 53.15% overall accuracy. Ablation studies reveal that strong regularization strength achieves optimal fairness with minimal accuracy trade-off, and race-specific optimization yields 60% disparity reduction. Our approach requires only 0.24% trainable parameters, enabling practical deployment of fair medical AI in resource-constrained healthcare settings.

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T06:04:48Z

**Summary**: Existing evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) on static benchmarks is vulnerable to data contamination and leaderboard overfitting, critical issues that obscure true model capabilities. To address this, we introduce LLMEval-3, a framework for dynamic evaluation of LLMs. LLMEval-3 is built on a proprietary bank of 220k graduate-level questions, from which it dynamically samples unseen test sets for each evaluation run. Its automated pipeline ensures integrity via contamination-resistant data curation, a novel anti-cheating architecture, and a calibrated LLM-as-a-judge process achieving 90% agreement with human experts, complemented by a relative ranking system for fair comparison. An 20-month longitudinal study of nearly 50 leading models reveals a performance ceiling on knowledge memorization and exposes data contamination vulnerabilities undetectable by static benchmarks. The framework demonstrates exceptional robustness in ranking stability and consistency, providing strong empirical validation for the dynamic evaluation paradigm. LLMEval-3 offers a robust and credible methodology for assessing the true capabilities of LLMs beyond leaderboard scores, promoting the development of more trustworthy evaluation standards.

### AsymPuzl: An Asymmetric Puzzle for multi-agent cooperation
**Authors**: Xavier Cadet, Edward Koh, Peter Chin

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T05:42:01Z

**Summary**: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are increasingly studied in multi-turn, multi-agent scenarios, yet most existing setups emphasize open-ended role-play rather than controlled evaluation. We introduce AsymPuzl, a minimal but expressive two-agent puzzle environment designed to isolate communication under information asymmetry. Each agent observes complementary but incomplete views of a symbolic puzzle and must exchange messages to solve it cooperatively. Using a diverse set of current-generation and open-source LLMs, we show that (i) strong models such as GPT-5 and Claude-4.0 reliably converge across puzzle sizes on the solution by sharing complete information in two turns, (ii) weaker models often ignore partner messages or over-correct their hypotheses, and (iii) feedback design is non-trivial: simple self-feedback improves success rates, while detailed joint feedback can hurt performance. These findings show that even in simple cooperative tasks, LLM communication strategies diverge and depend on the granularity of feedback signals. AsymPuzl thus provides a testbed for probing the limits of multi-turn cooperation and opens avenues for studying coordination mechanisms.

### Text-Printed Image: Bridging the Image-Text Modality Gap for Text-centric Training of Large Vision-Language Models
**Authors**: Shojiro Yamabe, Futa Waseda, Daiki Shiono, Tsubasa Takahashi

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T05:36:46Z

**Summary**: Recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) have been applied to diverse VQA tasks. However, achieving practical performance typically requires task-specific fine-tuning with large numbers of image-text pairs, which are costly to collect. In this work, we study text-centric training, a setting where only textual descriptions are available and no real images are provided, as a paradigm for low-cost data scaling. Unlike images, whose collection is often restricted by privacy constraints and scarcity in niche domains, text is widely available. Moreover, text is easily editable, enabling automatic diversification and expansion with LLMs at minimal human effort. While this offers clear advantages over image collection in terms of scalability and cost, training on raw text without images still yields limited gains on VQA tasks because of the image-text modality gap. To address this issue, we propose a Text-Printed Image (TPI), which generates synthetic images by directly rendering the given textual description on a plain white canvas. This simple rendering projects text into the image modality and can be integrated into arbitrary existing LVLM training pipelines at low cost. Moreover, TPI preserves the semantics of the text, whereas text-to-image models often fail to do. Across four models and seven benchmarks, our systematic experiments show that TPI enables more effective text-centric training than synthetic images generated by a diffusion model. We further explore TPI as a low-cost data-augmentation strategy and demonstrate its practical utility. Overall, our findings highlight the significant potential of text-centric training and, more broadly, chart a path toward fully automated data generation for LVLMs.

### Grounded Test-Time Adaptation for LLM Agents
**Authors**: Arthur Chen, Zuxin Liu, Jianguo Zhang, Akshara Prabhakar, Zhiwei Liu, Shelby Heinecke, Silvio Savarese, Victor Zhong, Caiming Xiong

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T05:19:03Z

**Summary**: Large language model (LLM)-based agents struggle to generalize to novel and complex environments, such as unseen websites or new sets of functions, due to a fundamental mismatch between their pre-training and test-time conditions. This challenge stems from two distinct failure modes: a syntactic misunderstanding of environment-specific components like observation formats, and a semantic misunderstanding of state-transition dynamics, which are only revealed at test time. To address these issues, we propose two distinct and complementary strategies for adapting LLM agents by leveraging environment-specific information available during deployment. First, an online distributional adaptation method parameterizes environmental nuances by learning a lightweight adaptation vector that biases the model's output distribution, enabling rapid alignment with an environment response format. Second, a deployment-time dynamics grounding method employs a persona-driven exploration phase to systematically probe and learn the environment's causal dynamics before task execution, equipping the agent with a nonparametric world model. We evaluate these strategies across diverse agentic benchmarks, including function calling and web navigation. Our empirical results show the effectiveness of both strategies across all benchmarks with minimal computational cost. We find that dynamics grounding is particularly effective in complex environments where unpredictable dynamics pose a major obstacle, demonstrating a robust path toward more generalizable and capable LLM-based agents. For example, on the WebArena multi-site split, this method increases the agent's success rate from 2% to 23%.

### Think Before You Drive: World Model-Inspired Multimodal Grounding for Autonomous Vehicles
**Authors**: Haicheng Liao, Huanming Shen, Bonan Wang, Yongkang Li, Yihong Tang, Chengyue Wang, Dingyi Zhuang, Kehua Chen, Hai Yang, Chengzhong Xu, Zhenning Li

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T05:14:16Z

**Summary**: Interpreting natural-language commands to localize target objects is critical for autonomous driving (AD). Existing visual grounding (VG) methods for autonomous vehicles (AVs) typically struggle with ambiguous, context-dependent instructions, as they lack reasoning over 3D spatial relations and anticipated scene evolution. Grounded in the principles of world models, we propose ThinkDeeper, a framework that reasons about future spatial states before making grounding decisions. At its core is a Spatial-Aware World Model (SA-WM) that learns to reason ahead by distilling the current scene into a command-aware latent state and rolling out a sequence of future latent states, providing forward-looking cues for disambiguation. Complementing this, a hypergraph-guided decoder then hierarchically fuses these states with the multimodal input, capturing higher-order spatial dependencies for robust localization. In addition, we present DrivePilot, a multi-source VG dataset in AD, featuring semantic annotations generated by a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT)-prompted LLM pipeline. Extensive evaluations on six benchmarks, ThinkDeeper ranks #1 on the Talk2Car leaderboard and surpasses state-of-the-art baselines on DrivePilot, MoCAD, and RefCOCO/+/g benchmarks. Notably, it shows strong robustness and efficiency in challenging scenes (long-text, multi-agent, ambiguity) and retains superior performance even when trained on 50% of the data.

### Batch Prompting Suppresses Overthinking Reasoning Under Constraint: How Batch Prompting Suppresses Overthinking in Reasoning Models
**Authors**: Wenmo Qiu, Saurabh Srivastava

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T05:06:22Z

**Summary**: Recent work has explored batch prompting as a strategy to amortize inference cost in large language models (LLMs). In this paper, we show that batching offers an additional, underappreciated benefit: it regularizes model behavior during multi-step reasoning for Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). We conduct a comprehensive study across 13 diverse benchmarks and observe that batching improves accuracy while substantially reducing reasoning token usage, often by 3x-5x. Through detailed behavioral analysis, we find that batching suppresses overthinking, reduces hedging language (e.g., repetitive self-corrections), and encourages more decisive answers. Surprisingly, we also observe emergent collective effects in batched inference: models often generalize patterns from earlier examples to solve harder ones in the same batch. These findings position batching not just as a throughput optimization, but as a powerful inference-time regularizer for more efficient and reliable LLM reasoning.

### PerFACT: Motion Policy with LLM-Powered Dataset Synthesis and Fusion Action-Chunking Transformers
**Authors**: Davood Soleymanzadeh, Xiao Liang, Minghui Zheng

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T04:54:55Z

**Summary**: Deep learning methods have significantly enhanced motion planning for robotic manipulators by leveraging prior experiences within planning datasets. However, state-of-the-art neural motion planners are primarily trained on small datasets collected in manually generated workspaces, limiting their generalizability to out-of-distribution scenarios. Additionally, these planners often rely on monolithic network architectures that struggle to encode critical planning information. To address these challenges, we introduce Motion Policy with Dataset Synthesis powered by large language models (LLMs) and Fusion Action-Chunking Transformers (PerFACT), which incorporates two key components. Firstly, a novel LLM-powered workspace generation method, MotionGeneralizer, enables large-scale planning data collection by producing a diverse set of semantically feasible workspaces. Secondly, we introduce Fusion Motion Policy Networks (MpiNetsFusion), a generalist neural motion planner that uses a fusion action-chunking transformer to better encode planning signals and attend to multiple feature modalities. Leveraging MotionGeneralizer, we collect 3.5M trajectories to train and evaluate MpiNetsFusion against state-of-the-art planners, which shows that the proposed MpiNetsFusion can plan several times faster on the evaluated tasks.

### LLM as Explainable Re-Ranker for Recommendation System
**Authors**: Yaqi Wang, Haojia Sun, Shuting Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-12-03T04:42:58Z

**Summary**: The application of large language models (LLMs) in recommendation systems has recently gained traction. Traditional recommendation systems often lack explainability and suffer from issues such as popularity bias. Previous research has also indicated that LLMs, when used as standalone predictors, fail to achieve accuracy comparable to traditional models. To address these challenges, we propose to use LLM as an explainable re-ranker, a hybrid approach that combines traditional recommendation models with LLMs to enhance both accuracy and interpretability. We constructed a dataset to train the re-ranker LLM and evaluated the alignment between the generated dataset and human expectations. Leveraging a two-stage training process, our model significantly improved NDCG, a key ranking metric. Moreover, the re-ranker outperformed a zero-shot baseline in ranking accuracy and interpretability. These results highlight the potential of integrating traditional recommendation models with LLMs to address limitations in existing systems and pave the way for more explainable and fair recommendation frameworks.
