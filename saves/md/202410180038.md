**Authors**: Mark Zhao, Emanuel Adamiak, Christos Kozyrakis

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T17:54:15Z

**Summary**: The input data pipeline is an essential component of each machine learning (ML) training job. It is responsible for reading massive amounts of training data, processing batches of samples using complex transformations, and loading them onto training nodes at low latency and high throughput. Performant input data systems are becoming increasingly critical, driven by skyrocketing data volumes and training throughput demands. Unfortunately, current input data systems cannot fully leverage key performance optimizations, resulting in hugely inefficient infrastructures that require significant resources - or worse - underutilize expensive accelerators.   To address these demands, we present cedar, an optimized and unified programming framework for ML input data pipelines. cedar allows users to define input data pipelines using composable operators that support arbitrary ML frameworks and libraries. cedar introduces an extensible optimizer that systematically applies a complex combination of optimizations (e.g., offloading, caching, prefetching, fusion, and reordering). It orchestrates processing across a customizable set of local and distributed compute resources in order to improve processing performance and efficiency, all without user input. Across eight pipelines, cedar improves performance by up to 1.87x to 10.65x compared to state-of-the-art input data systems.

### Toleo: Scaling Freshness to Tera-scale Memory using CXL and PIM
**Authors**: Juechu Dong, Jonah Rosenblum, Satish Narayanasamy

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T17:10:48Z

**Summary**: Trusted hardware's freshness guarantee ensures that an adversary cannot replay an old value in response to a memory read request. They rely on maintaining a version number for each cache block and ensuring their integrity using a Merkle tree. However, these existing solutions protect only a small amount of main memory (few MBs), as the extraneous memory accesses to the Merkle tree increase prohibitively with the protected memory size. We present Toleo, which uses trusted smart memory connected through a secure CXL IDE network to safely store version numbers. Toleo eliminates the need for an unscalable Merkle tree to protect the integrity of version numbers by instead using smart memory as the root of trust. Additionally, Toleo ensures version confidentiality which enables stealth versions that reduce the version storage overhead in half.   Furthermore, in the absence of Merkle tree imposed constraints, we effectively exploit version locality at page granularity to compress version number by a factor of 240. These space optimizations make it feasible for one 168 GB Toleo smart memory device to provide freshness to a 28 TB CXL-expanded main memory pool in a rack server for a negligible performance overhead. We analyze the benefits of Toleo using several privacy-sensitive genomics, graph, generative AI, and database workloads.

**Authors**: Rishal Ravikesh Chand, Neeraj Anand Sharma, Muhammad Ashad Kabir

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T14:24:16Z

**Summary**: As the use of web browsers continues to grow, the potential for cybercrime and web-related criminal activities also increases. Digital forensic investigators must understand how different browsers function and the critical areas to consider during web forensic analysis. Web forensics, a subfield of digital forensics, involves collecting and analyzing browser artifacts, such as browser history, search keywords, and downloads, which serve as potential evidence. While existing research has provided valuable insights, many studies focus on individual browsing modes or limited forensic scenarios, leaving gaps in understanding the full scope of data retention and recovery across different modes and browsers. This paper addresses these gaps by defining four browsing scenarios and critically analyzing browser artifacts across normal, private, and portable modes using various forensic tools. We define four browsing scenarios to perform a comprehensive evaluation of popular browsers -- Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Brave, Tor, and Microsoft Edge -- by monitoring changes in key data storage areas such as cache files, cookies, browsing history, and local storage across different browsing modes. Overall, this paper contributes to a deeper understanding of browser forensic analysis and identifies key areas for enhancing privacy protection and forensic methodologies.

### FiRST: Finetuning Router-Selective Transformers for Input-Adaptive   Latency Reduction
**Authors**: Akriti Jain, Saransh Sharma, Koyel Mukherjee, Soumyabrata Pal

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T12:45:35Z

**Summary**: Auto-regressive Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable performance across domanins such as vision and language processing. However, due to sequential processing through a stack of transformer layers, autoregressive decoding faces significant computation/latency challenges, particularly in resource constrained environments like mobile and edge devices. Existing approaches in literature that aim to improve latency via skipping layers have two distinct flavors - 1) Early exit 2) Input-agnostic heuristics where tokens exit at pre-determined layers irrespective of input sequence. Both the above strategies have limitations - the former cannot be applied to handle KV Caching necessary for speed-ups in modern framework and the latter does not capture the variation in layer importance across tasks or more generally, across input sequences. To address both limitations, we propose FIRST, an algorithm that reduces inference latency by using layer-specific routers to select a subset of transformer layers adaptively for each input sequence - the prompt (during prefill stage) decides which layers will be skipped during decoding. FIRST preserves compatibility with KV caching enabling faster inference while being quality-aware. FIRST is model-agnostic and can be easily enabled on any pre-trained LLM. We further improve performance by incorporating LoRA adapters for fine-tuning on external datasets, enhancing task-specific accuracy while maintaining latency benefits. Our approach reveals that input adaptivity is critical - indeed, different task-specific middle layers play a crucial role in evolving hidden representations depending on task. Extensive experiments show that FIRST significantly reduces latency while retaining competitive performance (as compared to baselines), making our approach an efficient solution for LLM deployment in low-resource environments.

**Authors**: Qinghang Zhao, Jiaqi Wang, Yixi Ji, Jinjian Wu, Guangming Shi

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T10:06:22Z

**Summary**: Dynamic vision sensor (DVS) is novel neuromorphic imaging device that generates asynchronous events. Despite the high temporal resolution and high dynamic range features, DVS is faced with background noise problem. Spatiotemporal filter is an effective and hardware-friendly solution for DVS denoising but previous designs have large memory overhead or degraded performance issues. In this paper, we present a lightweight and real-time spatiotemporal denoising filter with set-associative cache-like memories, which has low space complexity of \text{O(m+n)} for DVS of $m\times n$ resolution. A two-stage pipeline for memory access with read cancellation feature is proposed to reduce power consumption. Further the bitwidth redundancy for event storage is exploited to minimize the memory footprint. We implemented our design on FPGA and experimental results show that it achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with previous spatiotemporal filters while maintaining low resource utilization and low power consumption of about 125mW to 210mW at 100MHz clock frequency.

**Authors**: Lian Liu, Haimeng Ren, Long Cheng, Zhaohui Xu, Yudong Pan, Mengdi Wang, Xiaowei Li, Yinhe Han, Ying Wang

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T02:16:53Z

**Summary**: Quantization is a widely-used compression technology to reduce the overhead of serving large language models (LLMs) on terminal devices and in cloud data centers. However, prevalent quantization methods, such as 8-bit weight-activation or 4-bit weight-only quantization, achieve limited performance improvements due to poor support for low-precision (e.g., 4-bit) activation. This work, for the first time, realizes practical W4A4KV4 serving for LLMs, fully utilizing the INT4 tensor cores on modern GPUs and reducing the memory bottleneck caused by the KV cache. Specifically, we propose a novel fine-grained mixed-precision quantization algorithm (FMPQ) that compresses most activations into 4-bit with negligible accuracy loss. To support mixed-precision matrix multiplication for W4A4 and W4A8, we develop a highly optimized W4Ax kernel. Our approach introduces a novel mixed-precision data layout to facilitate access and fast dequantization for activation and weight tensors, utilizing the GPU's software pipeline to hide the overhead of data loading and conversion. Additionally, we propose fine-grained streaming multiprocessor (SM) scheduling to achieve load balance across different SMs. We integrate the optimized W4Ax kernel into our inference framework, COMET, and provide efficient management to support popular LLMs such as LLaMA-3-70B. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that, when running LLaMA family models on a single A100-80G-SMX4, COMET achieves a kernel-level speedup of \textbf{$2.88\times$} over cuBLAS and a \textbf{$2.02 \times$} throughput improvement compared to TensorRT-LLM from an end-to-end framework perspective.

### Mitigate Position Bias in Large Language Models via Scaling a Single   Dimension
**Authors**: Yijiong Yu, Huiqiang Jiang, Xufang Luo, Qianhui Wu, Chin-Yew Lin, Dongsheng Li, Yuqing Yang, Yongfeng Huang, Lili Qiu

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T15:58:07Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in various real-world scenarios due to their excellent generalization capabilities and robust generative abilities. However, they exhibit position bias, also known as "lost in the middle", a phenomenon that is especially pronounced in long-context scenarios, which indicates the placement of the key information in different positions of a prompt can significantly affect accuracy. This paper first explores the micro-level manifestations of position bias, concluding that attention weights are a micro-level expression of position bias. It further identifies that, in addition to position embeddings, causal attention mask also contributes to position bias by creating position-specific hidden states. Based on these insights, we propose a method to mitigate position bias by scaling this positional hidden states. Experiments on the NaturalQuestions Multi-document QA, KV retrieval, LongBench and timeline reorder tasks, using various models including RoPE models, context windowextended models, and Alibi models, demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach. Our method can improve performance by up to 15.2% by modifying just one dimension of hidden states. Our code is available at https://aka.ms/PositionalHidden.

### VidCompress: Memory-Enhanced Temporal Compression for Video   Understanding in Large Language Models
**Authors**: Xiaohan Lan, Yitian Yuan, Zequn Jie, Lin Ma

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T09:07:25Z

**Summary**: Video-based multimodal large language models (Video-LLMs) possess significant potential for video understanding tasks. However, most Video-LLMs treat videos as a sequential set of individual frames, which results in insufficient temporal-spatial interaction that hinders fine-grained comprehension and difficulty in processing longer videos due to limited visual token capacity. To address these challenges, we propose VidCompress, a novel Video-LLM featuring memory-enhanced temporal compression. VidCompress employs a dual-compressor approach: a memory-enhanced compressor captures both short-term and long-term temporal relationships in videos and compresses the visual tokens using a multiscale transformer with a memory-cache mechanism, while a text-perceived compressor generates condensed visual tokens by utilizing Q-Former and integrating temporal contexts into query embeddings with cross attention. Experiments on several VideoQA datasets and comprehensive benchmarks demonstrate that VidCompress efficiently models complex temporal-spatial relations and significantly outperforms existing Video-LLMs.

**Authors**: Zayd Muhammad Kawakibi Zuhri, Muhammad Farid Adilazuarda, Ayu Purwarianti, Alham Fikri Aji

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T08:45:18Z

**Summary**: Auto-regressive inference of transformers benefit greatly from Key-Value (KV) caching, but can lead to major memory bottlenecks as model size, batch size, and sequence length grow at scale. We introduce Multi-Layer Key-Value (MLKV) sharing, a novel approach extending KV sharing across transformer layers to reduce memory usage beyond what was possible with Multi-Query Attention (MQA) and Grouped-Query Attention (GQA). Evaluations on various NLP benchmarks and inference metrics using uptrained Pythia-160M variants demonstrate that MLKV significantly reduces memory usage with minimal performance loss, reducing KV cache size down to a factor of 6x compared to MQA. These results highlight MLKV's potential for efficient deployment of transformer models at scale. We provide code at https://github.com/zaydzuhri/pythia-mlkv

### A Training-free Sub-quadratic Cost Transformer Model Serving Framework   With Hierarchically Pruned Attention
**Authors**: Heejun Lee, Geon Park, Youngwan Lee, Jaduk Suh, Jina Kim, Wonyoung Jeong, Bumsik Kim, Hyemin Lee, Myeongjae Jeon, Sung Ju Hwang

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T06:09:35Z

**Summary**: In modern large language models (LLMs), increasing the context length is crucial for improving comprehension and coherence in long-context, multi-modal, and retrieval-augmented language generation. While many recent transformer models attempt to extend their context length over a million tokens, they remain impractical due to the quadratic time and space complexities. Although recent works on linear and sparse attention mechanisms can achieve this goal, their real-world applicability is often limited by the need to re-train from scratch and significantly worse performance. In response, we propose a novel approach, Hierarchically Pruned Attention (HiP), which reduces the time complexity of the attention mechanism to $O(T \log T)$ and the space complexity to $O(T)$, where $T$ is the sequence length. We notice a pattern in the attention scores of pretrained LLMs where tokens close together tend to have similar scores, which we call ``attention locality''. Based on this observation, we utilize a novel tree-search-like algorithm that estimates the top-$k$ key tokens for a given query on the fly, which is mathematically guaranteed to have better performance than random attention pruning. In addition to improving the time complexity of the attention mechanism, we further optimize GPU memory usage by implementing KV cache offloading, which stores only $O(\log T)$ tokens on the GPU while maintaining similar decoding throughput. Experiments on benchmarks show that HiP, with its training-free nature, significantly reduces both prefill and decoding latencies, as well as memory usage, while maintaining high-quality generation with minimal degradation. HiP enables pretrained LLMs to scale up to millions of tokens on commodity GPUs, potentially unlocking long-context LLM applications previously deemed infeasible.

### QSpec: Speculative Decoding with Complementary Quantization Schemes
**Authors**: Juntao Zhao, Wenhao Lu, Sheng Wang, Lingpeng Kong, Chuan Wu

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T05:57:51Z

**Summary**: Quantization has been substantially adopted to accelerate inference and reduce memory consumption of large language models (LLMs). While activation-weight joint quantization speeds up the inference process through low-precision kernels, we demonstrate that it suffers severe performance degradation on multi-step reasoning tasks, rendering it ineffective. We propose a novel quantization paradigm called QSPEC, which seamlessly integrates two complementary quantization schemes for speculative decoding. Leveraging nearly cost-free execution switching, QSPEC drafts tokens with low-precision, fast activation-weight quantization, and verifies them with high-precision weight-only quantization, effectively combining the strengths of both quantization schemes. Compared to high-precision quantization methods, QSPEC empirically boosts token generation throughput by up to 1.80x without any quality compromise, distinguishing it from other low-precision quantization approaches. This enhancement is also consistent across various serving tasks, model sizes, quantization methods, and batch sizes. Unlike existing speculative decoding techniques, our approach reuses weights and the KV cache, avoiding additional memory overhead. Furthermore, QSPEC offers a plug-and-play advantage without requiring any training. We believe that QSPEC demonstrates unique strengths for future deployment of high-fidelity quantization schemes, particularly in memory-constrained scenarios (e.g., edge devices).

### Recommenadation aided Caching using Combinatorial Multi-armed Bandits
**Authors**: Pavamana K J, Chandramani Kishore Singh

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T05:34:07Z

**Summary**: We study content caching with recommendations in a wireless network where the users are connected through a base station equipped with a finite-capacity cache. We assume a fixed set of contents with unknown user preferences and content popularities. The base station can cache a subset of the contents and can also recommend subsets of the contents to different users in order to encourage them to request the recommended contents. Recommendations, depending on their acceptability, can thus be used to increase cache hits. We first assume that the users' recommendation acceptabilities are known and formulate the cache hit optimization problem as a combinatorial multi-armed bandit (CMAB). We propose a UCB-based algorithm to decide which contents to cache and recommend and provide an upper bound on the regret of this algorithm. Subsequently, we consider a more general scenario where the users' recommendation acceptabilities are also unknown and propose another UCB-based algorithm that learns these as well. We numerically demonstrate the performance of our algorithms and compare these to state-of-the-art algorithms.

### A Zoned Storage Optimized Flash Cache on ZNS SSDs
**Authors**: Chongzhuo Yang, Chang Guo, Ming Zhao, Zhichao Cao

**Updated**: 2024-10-15T04:35:49Z

**Summary**: Zoned Namespace SSDs (ZNS) are introduced recently to mitigate the block interface penalties of flash-based SSDs. It is a good opportunity for flash cache to address cache throughput and write amplification (WA) issues by fully controlling data allocation and garbage collection via zone-based interfaces. However, there are several critical challenges that need to be addressed including zone-interface compatibility, data management of large zone size, and a better tradeoff between throughput, cache hit ratio, and WA.   In this paper, we present Z-CacheLib, a zoned storage optimized flash cache on ZNS SSDs. In Z-CacheLib, we propose: 1) a new zStorage Engine for ZNS SSDs with low mapping and operational overhead, and 2) a novel zCache Engine with cross-layer optimizations to resolve the throughput regression and WA issues of garbage collection, which consists of delayed data eviction with virtual over-provisioning (vOP), a top-down eviction policy (zLRU) optimized from LRU, and a bottom-up drop mechanism (zDrop) for low WA. Our evaluation shows that Z-CacheLib can achieve up to 2X throughput, 5% improvement hit ratio, and almost no WA compared to CacheLib with compatible regular SSDs, demonstrating benefits of using ZNS SSDs for cache. Moreover, Z-CacheLib can achieve up to 6X throughput and 92% WA reduction compared with F2FS-based scheme.

### Enhancing High-Level Synthesis with Automated Pragma Insertion and Code   Transformation Framework
**Authors**: Stéphane Pouget, Louis-Noël Pouchet, Jason Cong

**Updated**: 2024-10-14T19:12:48Z

**Summary**: High-level synthesis, source-to-source compilers, and various Design Space Exploration techniques for pragma insertion have significantly improved the Quality of Results of generated designs. These tools offer benefits such as reduced development time and enhanced performance. However, achieving high-quality results often requires additional manual code transformations and tiling selections, which are typically performed separately or as pre-processing steps. Although DSE techniques enable code transformation upfront, the vastness of the search space often limits the exploration of all possible code transformations, making it challenging to determine which transformations are necessary. Additionally, ensuring correctness remains challenging, especially for complex transformations and optimizations.   To tackle this obstacle, we first propose a comprehensive framework leveraging HLS compilers. Our system streamlines code transformation, pragma insertion, and tiles size selection for on-chip data caching through a unified optimization problem, aiming to enhance parallelization, particularly beneficial for computation-bound kernels. Them employing a novel Non-Linear Programming (NLP) approach, we simultaneously ascertain transformations, pragmas, and tile sizes, focusing on regular loop-based kernels. Our evaluation demonstrates that our framework adeptly identifies the appropriate transformations, including scenarios where no transformation is necessary, and inserts pragmas to achieve a favorable Quality of Results.

### DuoAttention: Efficient Long-Context LLM Inference with Retrieval and   Streaming Heads
**Authors**: Guangxuan Xiao, Jiaming Tang, Jingwei Zuo, Junxian Guo, Shang Yang, Haotian Tang, Yao Fu, Song Han

**Updated**: 2024-10-14T17:59:58Z

**Summary**: Deploying long-context large language models (LLMs) is essential but poses significant computational and memory challenges. Caching all Key and Value (KV) states across all attention heads consumes substantial memory. Existing KV cache pruning methods either damage the long-context capabilities of LLMs or offer only limited efficiency improvements. In this paper, we identify that only a fraction of attention heads, a.k.a, Retrieval Heads, are critical for processing long contexts and require full attention across all tokens. In contrast, all other heads, which primarily focus on recent tokens and attention sinks--referred to as Streaming Heads--do not require full attention. Based on this insight, we introduce DuoAttention, a framework that only applies a full KV cache to retrieval heads while using a light-weight, constant-length KV cache for streaming heads, which reduces both LLM's decoding and pre-filling memory and latency without compromising its long-context abilities. DuoAttention uses a lightweight, optimization-based algorithm with synthetic data to identify retrieval heads accurately. Our method significantly reduces long-context inference memory by up to 2.55x for MHA and 1.67x for GQA models while speeding up decoding by up to 2.18x and 1.50x and accelerating pre-filling by up to 1.73x and 1.63x for MHA and GQA models, respectively, with minimal accuracy loss compared to full attention. Notably, combined with quantization, DuoAttention enables Llama-3-8B decoding with 3.3 million context length on a single A100 GPU. Code is provided in https://github.com/mit-han-lab/duo-attention.

### When Attention Sink Emerges in Language Models: An Empirical View
**Authors**: Xiangming Gu, Tianyu Pang, Chao Du, Qian Liu, Fengzhuo Zhang, Cunxiao Du, Ye Wang, Min Lin

**Updated**: 2024-10-14T17:50:28Z

**Summary**: Language Models (LMs) assign significant attention to the first token, even if it is not semantically important, which is known as attention sink. This phenomenon has been widely adopted in applications such as streaming/long context generation, KV cache optimization, inference acceleration, model quantization, and others. Despite its widespread use, a deep understanding of attention sink in LMs is still lacking. In this work, we first demonstrate that attention sinks exist universally in LMs with various inputs, even in small models. Furthermore, attention sink is observed to emerge during the LM pre-training, motivating us to investigate how optimization, data distribution, loss function, and model architecture in LM pre-training influence its emergence. We highlight that attention sink emerges after effective optimization on sufficient training data. The sink position is highly correlated with the loss function and data distribution. Most importantly, we find that attention sink acts more like key biases, storing extra attention scores, which could be non-informative and not contribute to the value computation. We also observe that this phenomenon (at least partially) stems from tokens' inner dependence on attention scores as a result of softmax normalization. After relaxing such dependence by replacing softmax attention with other attention operations, such as sigmoid attention without normalization, attention sinks do not emerge in LMs up to 1B parameters. The code is available at https://github.com/sail-sg/Attention-Sink.

### Customize Your Visual Autoregressive Recipe with Set Autoregressive   Modeling
**Authors**: Wenze Liu, Le Zhuo, Yi Xin, Sheng Xia, Peng Gao, Xiangyu Yue

**Updated**: 2024-10-14T13:49:06Z

**Summary**: We introduce a new paradigm for AutoRegressive (AR) image generation, termed Set AutoRegressive Modeling (SAR). SAR generalizes the conventional AR to the next-set setting, i.e., splitting the sequence into arbitrary sets containing multiple tokens, rather than outputting each token in a fixed raster order. To accommodate SAR, we develop a straightforward architecture termed Fully Masked Transformer. We reveal that existing AR variants correspond to specific design choices of sequence order and output intervals within the SAR framework, with AR and Masked AR (MAR) as two extreme instances. Notably, SAR facilitates a seamless transition from AR to MAR, where intermediate states allow for training a causal model that benefits from both few-step inference and KV cache acceleration, thus leveraging the advantages of both AR and MAR. On the ImageNet benchmark, we carefully explore the properties of SAR by analyzing the impact of sequence order and output intervals on performance, as well as the generalization ability regarding inference order and steps. We further validate the potential of SAR by training a 900M text-to-image model capable of synthesizing photo-realistic images with any resolution. We hope our work may inspire more exploration and application of AR-based modeling across diverse modalities.

### Accelerating Diffusion Transformers with Token-wise Feature Caching
**Authors**: Chang Zou, Xuyang Liu, Ting Liu, Siteng Huang, Linfeng Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-10-14T09:35:35Z

**Summary**: Diffusion transformers have shown significant effectiveness in both image and video synthesis at the expense of huge computation costs. To address this problem, feature caching methods have been introduced to accelerate diffusion transformers by caching the features in previous timesteps and reusing them in the following timesteps. However, previous caching methods ignore that different tokens exhibit different sensitivities to feature caching, and feature caching on some tokens may lead to 10$\times$ more destruction to the overall generation quality compared with other tokens. In this paper, we introduce token-wise feature caching, allowing us to adaptively select the most suitable tokens for caching, and further enable us to apply different caching ratios to neural layers in different types and depths. Extensive experiments on PixArt-$\alpha$, OpenSora, and DiT demonstrate our effectiveness in both image and video generation with no requirements for training. For instance, 2.36$\times$ and 1.93$\times$ acceleration are achieved on OpenSora and PixArt-$\alpha$ with almost no drop in generation quality.

### FedCache 2.0: Federated Edge Learning with Knowledge Caching and Dataset   Distillation
**Authors**: Quyang Pan, Sheng Sun, Zhiyuan Wu, Yuwei Wang, Min Liu, Bo Gao, Jingyuan Wang

**Updated**: 2024-10-14T07:58:39Z

**Summary**: Federated Edge Learning (FEL) has emerged as a promising approach for enabling edge devices to collaboratively train machine learning models while preserving data privacy. Despite its advantages, practical FEL deployment faces significant challenges related to device constraints and device-server interactions, necessitating heterogeneous, user-adaptive model training with limited and uncertain communication. In this paper, we introduce FedCache 2.0, a novel personalized FEL architecture that simultaneously addresses these challenges. FedCache 2.0 incorporates the benefits of both dataset distillation and knowledge cache-driven federated learning by storing and organizing distilled data as knowledge in the server-side knowledge cache. Moreover, a device-centric cache sampling strategy is introduced to tailor transferred knowledge for individual devices within controlled communication bandwidth. Extensive experiments on five datasets covering image recognition, audio understanding, and mobile sensor data mining tasks demonstrate that (1) FedCache 2.0 significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods regardless of model structures, data distributions, and modalities. (2) FedCache 2.0 can train splendid personalized on-device models with at least $\times$28.6 improvement in communication efficiency.

### Caching Content Placement and Beamforming Co-design for IRS-Aided MIMO   Systems with Imperfect CSI
**Authors**: Meng Gao, Yang Wang, Huafu Li, Junqi Guo

**Updated**: 2024-10-14T04:49:22Z

**Summary**: When offloading links encounter deep fading and obstruction, edge caching cannot fully enhance wireless network performance and improve the QoS of edge nodes, as it fails to effectively reduce backhaul burden. The emerging technology of intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) compensates for this disadvantage by creating a smart and reconfigurable wireless environment. Subsequently, we jointly design content placement and active/passive beamforming to minimize network costs under imperfect channel state information (CSI) in the IRS-oriented edge caching system. This minimization problem is decomposed into two subproblems. The content placement subproblem is addressed by applying KKT optimality conditions. We then develop the alternating optimization method to resolve precoder and reflection beamforming. Specifically, we reduce transmission power by first fixing the phase shift, reducing the problem to a convex one relative to the precoder, which is solved through convex optimization. Next, we fix the precoder and resolve the resulting reflection beamforming problem using the penalty convex-concave procedure (CCP) method. Results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms uniform caching and random phase approaches in reducing transmission power and saving network costs. Eventually, the proposed approach offers potential improvements in the caching optimization and transmission robustness of wireless communication with imperfect CSI.

### Fast and Accurate Neural Rendering Using Semi-Gradients
**Authors**: In-Young Cho, Jaewoong Cho

**Updated**: 2024-10-14T04:30:38Z

**Summary**: We propose a simple yet effective neural network-based framework for global illumination rendering. Recently, rendering techniques that learn neural radiance caches by minimizing the difference (i.e., residual) between the left and right sides of the rendering equation have been suggested. Due to their ease of implementation and the advantage of excluding path integral calculations, these techniques have been applied to various fields, such as free-viewpoint rendering, differentiable rendering, and real-time rendering. However, issues of slow training and occasionally darkened renders have been noted. We identify the cause of these issues as the bias and high variance present in the gradient estimates of the existing residual-based objective function. To address this, we introduce a new objective function that maintains the same global optimum as before but allows for unbiased and low-variance gradient estimates, enabling faster and more accurate training of neural networks. In conclusion, this method is simply implemented by ignoring the partial derivatives of the right-hand side, and theoretical and experimental analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed loss.

**Authors**: Jinjin Shen, Yan Lin, Yijin Zhang, Weibin Zhang, Feng Shu, Jun Li

**Updated**: 2024-10-14T01:25:56Z

**Summary**: In order to avoid repeated task offloading and realize the reuse of popular task computing results, we construct a novel content caching-assisted vehicular edge computing (VEC) framework. In the face of irregular network topology and unknown environmental dynamics, we further propose a multi-agent graph attention reinforcement learning (MGARL) based edge caching scheme, which utilizes the graph attention convolution kernel to integrate the neighboring nodes' features of each agent and further enhance the cooperation among agents. Our simulation results show that our proposed scheme is capable of improving the utilization of caching resources while reducing the long-term task computing latency compared to the baselines.

### Leveraging Semantic Cues from Foundation Vision Models for Enhanced   Local Feature Correspondence
**Authors**: Felipe Cadar, Guilherme Potje, Renato Martins, Cédric Demonceaux, Erickson R. Nascimento

**Updated**: 2024-10-12T13:45:26Z

**Summary**: Visual correspondence is a crucial step in key computer vision tasks, including camera localization, image registration, and structure from motion. The most effective techniques for matching keypoints currently involve using learned sparse or dense matchers, which need pairs of images. These neural networks have a good general understanding of features from both images, but they often struggle to match points from different semantic areas. This paper presents a new method that uses semantic cues from foundation vision model features (like DINOv2) to enhance local feature matching by incorporating semantic reasoning into existing descriptors. Therefore, the learned descriptors do not require image pairs at inference time, allowing feature caching and fast matching using similarity search, unlike learned matchers. We present adapted versions of six existing descriptors, with an average increase in performance of 29% in camera localization, with comparable accuracy to existing matchers as LightGlue and LoFTR in two existing benchmarks. Both code and trained models are available at https://www.verlab.dcc.ufmg.br/descriptors/reasoning_accv24

### Viscoelastic Effects on the Hydrodynamics of an Active Compound Particle
**Authors**: KVS Chaithanya, Sumesh P. Thampi

**Updated**: 2024-10-12T10:38:39Z

**Summary**: Understanding the hydrodynamics of microswimmers in viscoelastic fluids and confined environments is crucial for interpreting their behaviour in natural settings and designing synthetic microswimmers for practical applications like cargo transport. In this study, we explore the hydrodynamics of a concentric active compound particle - a model microswimmer (a squirmer) positioned at the centre of a viscoelastic fluid droplet (a model cargo) suspended in another viscoelastic medium. We consider the Oldroyd-B constitutive model to characterize the fluids and employ a perturbative approach in the Deborah number to analyze viscoelastic effects analytically, assuming a small Capillary number so that the droplet remains spherical and does not deform. We examine three cases: (i) a squirmer confined within a viscoelastic fluid droplet suspended in a Newtonian fluid, (ii) a squirmer confined within a Newtonian fluid droplet suspended in a viscoelastic fluid, and (iii) a squirmer confined within a viscoelastic fluid droplet suspended in another viscoelastic fluid. Our findings reveal that the swimming speeds of the squirmer and the droplet are determined by the complex interplay of viscoelasticity, the size ratio of the droplet to the squirmer (confinement strength), and the viscosity ratio of the surrounding fluid to the droplet fluid. A critical aspect of this interaction is the positioning of stagnation points within the fluid flow, which governs the distribution of polymeric stress. This distribution, in turn, plays a crucial role in determining the influence of viscoelasticity on the squirmer's dynamics. Our analysis suggests that viscoelastic effects can either enhance or hinder the swimming speed of the squirmer when confined in a droplet, depending on the specific configuration of the system.

### Fine-grained Attention I/O Complexity: Comprehensive Analysis for   Backward Passes
**Authors**: Xiaoyu Li, Yingyu Liang, Zhenmei Shi, Zhao Song, Yufa Zhou

**Updated**: 2024-10-12T07:01:30Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in processing long-context information. However, the quadratic complexity of attention computation with respect to sequence length poses significant computational challenges, and I/O aware algorithms have been proposed. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the I/O complexity for attention mechanisms, focusing on backward passes by categorizing into small and large cache scenarios. Using the red-blue pebble game framework, we establish tight bounds on I/O complexity across all cache sizes. We confirm that the de facto standard I/O aware algorithm FlashAttention is optimal for both forward and backward passes for the large cache size scenario. For small cache sizes, we provide an algorithm that improves over existing methods and achieves the tight bounds. Additionally, we extend our analysis to sparse attention, a mainstream speeding-up approach, deriving fine-grained lower bounds for both forward and backward passes and both small and large caches. Our findings complete the theoretical foundation for I/O complexity in attention mechanisms, offering insights for designing efficient algorithms of LLM training and inference.

### In-place Switch: Reprogramming based SLC Cache Design for Hybrid 3D SSDs
**Authors**: Xufeng Yang, Zhengjian Cong, Congming Gao

**Updated**: 2024-10-12T02:11:14Z

**Summary**: Recently, 3D SSDs are widely adopted in PCs, data centers, and cloud storage systems. To increase capacity, high bit-density cells, such as Triple-Level Cell (TLC), are utilized within 3D SSDs. However, due to the inferior performance of TLC, a portion of TLCs is configured to operate as Single-Level Cell (SLC) to provide high performance, with host data initially directed to the SLCs. In SLC/TLC hybrid 3D SSDs, a portion of the TLC space is designated as an SLC cache to achieve high SSD performance by writing host data at the SLC speed. Given the limited size of the SLC cache, block reclamation is necessary to free up the SLC cache during idle periods. However, our preliminary studies indicate that the SLC cache can lead to a performance cliff if filled rapidly and cause significant write amplification when data migration occurs during idle times.   In this work, we propose leveraging a reprogram operation to address these challenges. Specifically, when the SLC cache is full or during idle periods, a reprogram operation is performed to switch used SLC pages to TLC pages in place (termed In-place Switch, IPS). Subsequently, other free TLC space is allocated as the new SLC cache. IPS can continuously provide sufficient SLC cache within SSDs, significantly improving write performance and reducing write amplification. Experimental results demonstrate that IPS can reduce write latency and write amplification by up to 0.75 times and 0.53 times, respectively, compared to state-of-the-art SLC cache technologies.

**Authors**: Sahar Ahmadi, Ali Cheraghian, Morteza Saberi, Md. Towsif Abir, Hamidreza Dastmalchi, Farookh Hussain, Shafin Rahman

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T20:23:00Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in deep learning for processing point clouds hold increased interest in Few-Shot Class Incremental Learning (FSCIL) for 3D computer vision. This paper introduces a new method to tackle the Few-Shot Continual Incremental Learning (FSCIL) problem in 3D point cloud environments. We leverage a foundational 3D model trained extensively on point cloud data. Drawing from recent improvements in foundation models, known for their ability to work well across different tasks, we propose a novel strategy that does not require additional training to adapt to new tasks. Our approach uses a dual cache system: first, it uses previous test samples based on how confident the model was in its predictions to prevent forgetting, and second, it includes a small number of new task samples to prevent overfitting. This dynamic adaptation ensures strong performance across different learning tasks without needing lots of fine-tuning. We tested our approach on datasets like ModelNet, ShapeNet, ScanObjectNN, and CO3D, showing that it outperforms other FSCIL methods and demonstrating its effectiveness and versatility. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/ahmadisahar/ACCV_FCIL3D}.

### Calibrated Cache Model for Few-Shot Vision-Language Model Adaptation
**Authors**: Kun Ding, Qiang Yu, Haojian Zhang, Gaofeng Meng, Shiming Xiang

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T15:12:30Z

**Summary**: Cache-based approaches stand out as both effective and efficient for adapting vision-language models (VLMs). Nonetheless, the existing cache model overlooks three crucial aspects. 1) Pre-trained VLMs are mainly optimized for image-text similarity, neglecting the importance of image-image similarity, leading to a gap between pre-training and adaptation. 2) The current cache model is based on the Nadaraya-Watson (N-W) estimator, which disregards the intricate relationships among training samples while constructing weight function. 3) Under the condition of limited samples, the logits generated by cache model are of high uncertainty, directly using these logits without accounting for the confidence could be problematic. This work presents three calibration modules aimed at addressing the above challenges. Similarity Calibration refines the image-image similarity by using unlabeled images. We add a learnable projection layer with residual connection on top of the pre-trained image encoder of CLIP and optimize the parameters by minimizing self-supervised contrastive loss. Weight Calibration introduces a precision matrix into the weight function to adequately model the relation between training samples, transforming the existing cache model to a Gaussian Process (GP) regressor, which could be more accurate than N-W estimator. Confidence Calibration leverages the predictive variances computed by GP Regression to dynamically re-scale the logits of cache model, ensuring that the cache model's outputs are appropriately adjusted based on their confidence levels. Besides, to reduce the high complexity of GPs, we further propose a group-based learning strategy. Integrating the above designs, we propose both training-free and training-required variants. Extensive experiments on 11 few-shot classification datasets validate that the proposed methods can achieve state-of-the-art performance.

### Unlocking FedNL: Self-Contained Compute-Optimized Implementation
**Authors**: Konstantin Burlachenko, Peter Richtárik

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T12:19:18Z

**Summary**: Federated Learning (FL) is an emerging paradigm that enables intelligent agents to collaboratively train Machine Learning (ML) models in a distributed manner, eliminating the need for sharing their local data. The recent work (arXiv:2106.02969) introduces a family of Federated Newton Learn (FedNL) algorithms, marking a significant step towards applying second-order methods to FL and large-scale optimization. However, the reference FedNL prototype exhibits three serious practical drawbacks: (i) It requires 4.8 hours to launch a single experiment in a sever-grade workstation; (ii) The prototype only simulates multi-node setting; (iii) Prototype integration into resource-constrained applications is challenging. To bridge the gap between theory and practice, we present a self-contained implementation of FedNL, FedNL-LS, FedNL-PP for single-node and multi-node settings. Our work resolves the aforementioned issues and reduces the wall clock time by x1000. With this FedNL outperforms alternatives for training logistic regression in a single-node -- CVXPY (arXiv:1603.00943), and in a multi-node -- Apache Spark (arXiv:1505.06807), Ray/Scikit-Learn (arXiv:1712.05889). Finally, we propose two practical-orientated compressors for FedNL - adaptive TopLEK and cache-aware RandSeqK, which fulfill the theory of FedNL.

### AsyncFS: Metadata Updates Made Asynchronous for Distributed Filesystems   with In-Network Coordination
**Authors**: Jingwei Xu, Mingkai Dong, Qiulin Tian, Ziyi Tian, Tong Xin, Haibo Chen

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T08:33:58Z

**Summary**: Distributed filesystems typically employ synchronous metadata updates, facing inherent challenges for access efficiency, load balancing, and directory contention, especially under dynamic and skewed workloads. This paper argues that synchronous updates are overly conservative for distributed filesystems. We propose AsyncFS with asynchronous metadata updates, allowing operations to return early and defer directory updates until respective read to enable latency hiding and conflict resolution. The key challenge is efficiently maintaining the synchronous semantics of metadata updates. To address this, AsyncFS is co-designed with a programmable switch, leveraging the constrained on-switch resources to holistically track directory states in the network with negligible cost. This allows AsyncFS to timely aggregate and efficiently apply delayed updates using batching and consolidation before directory reads. Evaluation shows that AsyncFS achieves up to 13.34$\times$ and 3.85$\times$ higher throughput, and 61.6% and 57.3% lower latency than two state-of-the-art distributed filesystems, InfiniFS and CFS-KV, respectively, on skewed workloads. For real-world workloads, AsyncFS improves end-to-end throughput by 21.1$\times$, 1.1$\times$ and 30.1% over Ceph, IndexFS and CFS-KV, respectively.

### ZipVL: Efficient Large Vision-Language Models with Dynamic Token   Sparsification and KV Cache Compression
**Authors**: Yefei He, Feng Chen, Jing Liu, Wenqi Shao, Hong Zhou, Kaipeng Zhang, Bohan Zhuang

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T07:24:21Z

**Summary**: The efficiency of large vision-language models (LVLMs) is constrained by the computational bottleneck of the attention mechanism during the prefill phase and the memory bottleneck of fetching the key-value (KV) cache in the decoding phase, particularly in scenarios involving high-resolution images or videos. Visual content often exhibits substantial redundancy, resulting in highly sparse attention maps within LVLMs. This sparsity can be leveraged to accelerate attention computation or compress the KV cache through various approaches. However, most studies focus on addressing only one of these bottlenecks and do not adequately support dynamic adjustment of sparsity concerning distinct layers or tasks. In this paper, we present ZipVL, an efficient inference framework designed for LVLMs that resolves both computation and memory bottlenecks through a dynamic ratio allocation strategy of important tokens. This ratio is adaptively determined based on the layer-specific distribution of attention scores, rather than fixed hyper-parameters, thereby improving efficiency for less complex tasks while maintaining high performance for more challenging ones. Then we select important tokens based on their normalized attention scores and perform attention mechanism solely on those important tokens to accelerate the prefill phase. To mitigate the memory bottleneck in the decoding phase, we employ mixed-precision quantization to the KV cache, where high-bit quantization is used for caches of important tokens, while low-bit quantization is applied to those of less importance. Our experiments demonstrate that ZipVL can accelerate the prefill phase by 2.6$\times$ and reduce GPU memory usage by 50.0%, with a minimal accuracy reduction of only 0.2% on Video-MME benchmark over LongVA-7B model, effectively enhancing the generation efficiency of LVLMs.

### Long Context Compression with Activation Beacon
**Authors**: Peitian Zhang, Zheng Liu, Shitao Xiao, Ninglu Shao, Qiwei Ye, Zhicheng Dou

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T02:18:24Z

**Summary**: Long context compression is a critical research problem due to its significance in reducing the high computational and memory costs associated with LLMs. In this paper, we propose Activation Beacon, a plug-in module for transformer-based LLMs that targets effective, efficient, and flexible compression of long contexts. To achieve this, our method introduces the following technical designs. 1) We directly compress the activations (i.e. keys and values at every layer), rather than leveraging soft prompts to relay information (which constitute a major bottleneck to encapsulate the complex information within long contexts). 2) We tailor the compression workflow, where each fine-grained input unit is progressively compressed, enabling high-quality compression and efficient computation during both training and inference. 3) We train the model through compression-based auto-regression, making full use of plain texts and instructional data to optimize the model's compression performance. 4) During training, we randomly sample a compression ratio at each step, teaching the model to support a wide range of compression configurations. Extensive evaluations are conducted on various long-context tasks whose lengths (e.g., 128K) may far exceed the maximum training length (20K), such as document understanding, few-shot learning, and Needle-in-a-Haystack. Whilst existing methods struggle to handle these challenging tasks, Activation Beacon maintains a comparable performance to the uncompressed baseline across various scenarios, achieving a 2x acceleration in inference time and an 8x reduction of memory costs for KV cache. Our data, model, and code have been released at \url{https://github.com/FlagOpen/FlagEmbedding/}.

### KV Prediction for Improved Time to First Token
**Authors**: Maxwell Horton, Qingqing Cao, Chenfan Sun, Yanzi Jin, Sachin Mehta, Mohammad Rastegari, Moin Nabi

**Updated**: 2024-10-10T21:55:11Z

**Summary**: Inference with transformer-based language models begins with a prompt processing step. In this step, the model generates the first output token and stores the KV cache needed for future generation steps. This prompt processing step can be computationally expensive, taking 10s of seconds or more for billion-parameter models on edge devices when prompt lengths or batch sizes rise. This degrades user experience by introducing significant latency into the model's outputs. To reduce the time spent producing the first output (known as the ``time to first token'', or TTFT) of a pretrained model, we introduce a novel method called KV Prediction. In our method, a small auxiliary model is used to process the prompt and produce an approximation of the KV cache used by a base model. This approximated KV cache is then used with the base model for autoregressive generation without the need to query the auxiliary model again. We demonstrate that our method produces a pareto-optimal efficiency-accuracy trade-off when compared to baselines. On TriviaQA, we demonstrate relative accuracy improvements in the range of $15\%-50\%$ across a range of TTFT FLOPs budgets. We also demonstrate accuracy improvements of up to $30\%$ on HumanEval python code completion at fixed TTFT FLOPs budgets. Additionally, we benchmark models on an Apple M2 Pro CPU and demonstrate that our improvement in FLOPs translates to a TTFT speedup on hardware. We release our code at https://github.com/apple/corenet/tree/main/projects/kv-prediction .

### Amplifying Main Memory-Based Timing Covert and Side Channels using   Processing-in-Memory Operations
**Authors**: Konstantinos Kanellopoulos, F. Nisa Bostanci, Ataberk Olgun, A. Giray Yaglikci, Ismail Emir Yuksel, Nika Mansouri Ghiasi, Zulal Bingol, Mohammad Sadrosadati, Onur Mutlu

**Updated**: 2024-10-10T16:57:34Z

**Summary**: The adoption of processing-in-memory (PiM) architectures has been gaining momentum because they provide high performance and low energy consumption by alleviating the data movement bottleneck. Yet, the security of such architectures has not been thoroughly explored. The adoption of PiM solutions provides a new way to directly access main memory, which malicious user applications can exploit. We show that this new way to access main memory opens opportunities for high-throughput timing attacks that are hard-to-mitigate without significant performance overhead.   We introduce IMPACT, a set of high-throughput main memory-based timing attacks that leverage characteristics of PiM architectures to establish covert and side channels. IMPACT enables high-throughput communication and private information leakage by exploiting the shared DRAM row buffer. To achieve high throughput, IMPACT (i) eliminates cache bypassing steps required by processor-centric main memory and cache-based timing attacks and (ii) leverages the intrinsic parallelism of PiM operations. We showcase two applications of IMPACT. First, we build two covert-channel attacks that run on the host CPU and leverage different PiM approaches to gain direct and fast access to main memory and establish high-throughput communication covert channels. Second, we showcase a side-channel attack that leaks private information of concurrently running victim applications that are accelerated with PiM. Our results demonstrate that (i) our covert channels achieve 12.87 Mb/s and 14.16 Mb/s communication throughput, respectively, which is up to 4.91x and 5.41x faster than the state-of-the-art main memory-based covert channels, and (ii) our side-channel attack allows the attacker to leak secrets with a low error rate. To avoid such covert and side channels in emerging PiM systems, we propose and evaluate three defenses.

### C$^3$P-VoxelMap: Compact, Cumulative and Coalescible Probabilistic Voxel   Mapping
**Authors**: Xu Yang, Wenhao Li, Qijie Ge, Lulu Suo, Weijie Tang, Zhengyu Wei, Longxiang Huang, Bo Wang

**Updated**: 2024-10-10T11:01:44Z

**Summary**: This work presents a compact, cumulative and coalescible probabilistic voxel mapping method to enhance performance, accuracy and memory efficiency in LiDAR odometry. Probabilistic voxel mapping requires storing past point clouds and re-iterating on them to update the uncertainty every iteration, which consumes large memory space and CPU cycles. To solve this problem, we propose a two-folded strategy. First, we introduce a compact point-free representation for probabilistic voxels and derive a cumulative update of the planar uncertainty without caching original point clouds. Our voxel structure only keeps track of a predetermined set of statistics for points that lie inside it. This method reduces the runtime complexity from $O(MN)$ to $O(N)$ and the space complexity from $O(N)$ to $O(1)$ where $M$ is the number of iterations and $N$ is the number of points. Second, to further minimize memory usage and enhance mapping accuracy, we provide a strategy to dynamically merge voxels associated with the same physical planes by taking advantage of the geometric features in the real world. Rather than scanning for these coalescible voxels constantly at every iteration, our merging strategy accumulates voxels in a locality-sensitive hash and triggers merging lazily. On-demand merging not only reduces memory footprint with minimal computational overhead but also improves localization accuracy thanks to cross-voxel denoising. Experiments exhibit 20% higher accuracy, 20% faster performance and 70% lower memory consumption than the state-of-the-art.

### SqueezeAttention: 2D Management of KV-Cache in LLM Inference via   Layer-wise Optimal Budget
**Authors**: Zihao Wang, Bin Cui, Shaoduo Gan

**Updated**: 2024-10-10T05:11:52Z

**Summary**: Optimizing the Key-Value (KV) cache of the Large Language Model (LLM) has been considered critical to saving the cost of inference. Most of the existing KV-cache compression algorithms attempted to sparsify the sequence of tokens by taking advantage of the different importance of tokens. However, most of these methods treat all layers equally, allocating the same KV budget to each layer. This approach is suboptimal, as some layers may be less sensitive to input tokens yet still receive the same budget as others. In this work, we found that by identifying the importance of attention layers, we could optimize the KV-cache jointly from two dimensions, i.e., sequence-wise and layer-wise. Based on our observations regarding layer-wise importance in inference, we propose SqueezeAttention to precisely optimize the allocation of KV-cache budget among layers on-the-fly and then incorporate three representative sequence-wise algorithms to compress the KV-cache for each layer with its very own budget. Specifically, we first measure each layer's importance by calculating the cosine similarity of the input prompt differences before and after the self-attention layers. Based on this similarity, we then categorize the layers into two groups and adjust their KV budgets accordingly. By optimizing the KV-cache from both sequence's and layer's dimensions, SqueezeAttention achieves around 30% to 70% of the memory reductions and up to 2.2 times of throughput improvements in a wide range of LLMs and benchmarks. The code is available at https://github.com/hetailang/SqueezeAttention.

### TurboRAG: Accelerating Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Precomputed   KV Caches for Chunked Text
**Authors**: Songshuo Lu, Hua Wang, Yutian Rong, Zhi Chen, Yaohua Tang

**Updated**: 2024-10-10T03:52:54Z

**Summary**: Current Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems concatenate and process numerous retrieved document chunks for prefill which requires a large volume of computation, therefore leading to significant latency in time-to-first-token (TTFT). To reduce the computation overhead as well as TTFT, we introduce TurboRAG, a novel RAG system that redesigns the inference paradigm of the current RAG system by first pre-computing and storing the key-value (KV) caches of documents offline, and then directly retrieving the saved KV cache for prefill. Hence, online computation of KV caches is eliminated during inference. In addition, we provide a number of insights into the mask matrix and positional embedding mechanisms, plus fine-tune a pretrained language model to maintain model accuracy of TurboRAG. Our approach is applicable to most existing large language models and their applications without any requirement in modification of models and inference systems. Experimental results across a suite of RAG benchmarks demonstrate that TurboRAG reduces TTFT by up to 9.4x compared to the conventional RAG systems (on an average of 8.6x), but reserving comparable performance to the standard RAG systems.

### Teddy: Efficient Large-Scale Dataset Distillation via   Taylor-Approximated Matching
**Authors**: Ruonan Yu, Songhua Liu, Jingwen Ye, Xinchao Wang

**Updated**: 2024-10-10T03:28:46Z

**Summary**: Dataset distillation or condensation refers to compressing a large-scale dataset into a much smaller one, enabling models trained on this synthetic dataset to generalize effectively on real data. Tackling this challenge, as defined, relies on a bi-level optimization algorithm: a novel model is trained in each iteration within a nested loop, with gradients propagated through an unrolled computation graph. However, this approach incurs high memory and time complexity, posing difficulties in scaling up to large datasets such as ImageNet. Addressing these concerns, this paper introduces Teddy, a Taylor-approximated dataset distillation framework designed to handle large-scale dataset and enhance efficiency. On the one hand, backed up by theoretical analysis, we propose a memory-efficient approximation derived from Taylor expansion, which transforms the original form dependent on multi-step gradients to a first-order one. On the other hand, rather than repeatedly training a novel model in each iteration, we unveil that employing a pre-cached pool of weak models, which can be generated from a single base model, enhances both time efficiency and performance concurrently, particularly when dealing with large-scale datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed Teddy attains state-of-the-art efficiency and performance on the Tiny-ImageNet and original-sized ImageNet-1K dataset, notably surpassing prior methods by up to 12.8%, while reducing 46.6% runtime. Our code will be available at https://github.com/Lexie-YU/Teddy.

**Summary**: Understanding the physics of electromagnetic pulse emission and nozzle damage is critical for the long-term operation of laser experiments with gas targets, particularly at facilities looking to produce stable sources of radiation at high repetition rate. We present a theoretical model of plasma formation and electrostatic charging when high-power lasers are focused inside gases. The model can be used to estimate the amplitude of gigahertz electromagnetic pulses (EMPs) produced by the laser and the extent of damage to the gas jet nozzle. Looking at a range of laser and target properties relevant to existing high-power laser systems, we find that EMP fields of tens to hundreds of kV/m can be generated several metres from the gas jet. Model predictions are compared with measurements of EMP, plasma formation and nozzle damage from two experiments on the VEGA-3 laser and one experiment on the Vulcan Petawatt laser.

**Authors**: Fan Wu, Xiaolong Xu, Muhammad Bilal, Xiangwei Wang, Hao Cheng, Siyu Wu

**Updated**: 2024-10-09T14:28:59Z

**Summary**: Computer simulation platforms offer an alternative solution by emulating complex systems in a controlled manner. However, existing Edge Computing (EC) simulators, as well as general-purpose vehicular network simulators, are not tailored for VEC and lack dedicated support for modeling the distinct access pattern, entity mobility trajectory and other unique characteristics of VEC networks. To fill this gap, this paper proposes VEC-Sim, a versatile simulation platform for in-depth evaluation and analysis of various service caching and computation offloading policies in VEC networks. VEC-Sim incorporates realistic mechanisms to replicate real-world access patterns, including service feature vector, vehicle mobility modeling, evolving service popularity, new service upload and user preference shifts, etc. Moreover, its modular architecture and extensive Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) allow seamless integration of customized scheduling policies and user-defined metrics. A comprehensive evaluation of VEC-Sim's capabilities is undertaken in comparison to real-world ground truths. Results prove it to be accurate in reproducing classical scheduling algorithms and extremely effective in conducting case studies.

**Authors**: Yi Xiong, Hao Wu, Changxu Shao, Ziqing Wang, Rui Zhang, Yuhong Guo, Junping Zhao, Ke Zhang, Zhenxuan Pan

**Updated**: 2024-10-09T11:40:31Z

**Summary**: The expanding context windows in large language models (LLMs) have greatly enhanced their capabilities in various applications, but they also introduce significant challenges in maintaining low latency, particularly in Time to First Token (TTFT). This paper identifies that the sharp rise in TTFT as context length increases is predominantly driven by queuing delays, which are caused by the growing demands for GPU Key-Value (KV) cache allocation clashing with the limited availability of KV cache blocks. To address this issue, we propose LayerKV, a simple yet effective plug-in method that effectively reduces TTFT without requiring additional hardware or compromising output performance, while seamlessly integrating with existing parallelism strategies and scheduling techniques. Specifically, LayerKV introduces layer-wise KV block allocation, management, and offloading for fine-grained control over system memory, coupled with an SLO-aware scheduler to optimize overall Service Level Objectives (SLOs). Comprehensive evaluations on representative models, ranging from 7B to 70B parameters, across various GPU configurations, demonstrate that LayerKV improves TTFT latency up to 69x and reduces SLO violation rates by 28.7%, significantly enhancing the user experience.

### Variations in Multi-Agent Actor-Critic Frameworks for Joint   Optimizations in UAV Swarm Networks: Recent Evolution, Challenges, and   Directions
**Authors**: Muhammad Morshed Alam, Muhammad Yeasir Aarafat, Tamim Hossain

**Updated**: 2024-10-09T07:22:40Z

**Summary**: Autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm networks (UAVSNs) can effectively execute surveillance, connectivity, and computing services to ground users (GUs). These missions require trajectory planning, UAV-GUs association, task offloading, next-hop selection, and resources such as transmit power, bandwidth, caching, and computing allocation to improve network performances. Owing to the highly dynamic topology, limited resources, and non-availability of global knowledge, optimizing network performance in UAVSNs is very intricate. Hence, it requires an adaptive joint optimization framework that can tackle both discrete and continuous decision variables to ensure optimal network performance under dynamic constraints. Multi-agent deep reinforcement learning-based adaptive actor-critic framework can efficiently address these problems. This paper investigates the recent evolutions of actor-critic frameworks to deal with joint optimization problems in UAVSNs. In addition, challenges and potential solutions are addressed as research directions.

### UpDLRM: Accelerating Personalized Recommendation using Real-World PIM   Architecture
**Authors**: Sitian Chen, Haobin Tan, Amelie Chi Zhou, Yusen Li, Pavan Balaji

**Updated**: 2024-10-09T04:11:28Z

**Summary**: Deep Learning Recommendation Models (DLRMs) have gained popularity in recommendation systems due to their effectiveness in handling large-scale recommendation tasks. The embedding layers of DLRMs have become the performance bottleneck due to their intensive needs on memory capacity and memory bandwidth. In this paper, we propose UpDLRM, which utilizes real-world processingin-memory (PIM) hardware, UPMEM DPU, to boost the memory bandwidth and reduce recommendation latency. The parallel nature of the DPU memory can provide high aggregated bandwidth for the large number of irregular memory accesses in embedding lookups, thus offering great potential to reduce the inference latency. To fully utilize the DPU memory bandwidth, we further studied the embedding table partitioning problem to achieve good workload-balance and efficient data caching. Evaluations using real-world datasets show that, UpDLRM achieves much lower inference time for DLRM compared to both CPU-only and CPU-GPU hybrid counterparts.

**Updated**: 2024-10-09T02:51:27Z

**Summary**: The increasing complexity of deep learning models used for calculating user representations presents significant challenges, particularly with limited computational resources and strict service-level agreements (SLAs). Previous research efforts have focused on optimizing model inference but have overlooked a critical question: is it necessary to perform user model inference for every ad request in large-scale social networks? To address this question and these challenges, we first analyze user access patterns at Meta and find that most user model inferences occur within a short timeframe. T his observation reveals a triangular relationship among model complexity, embedding freshness, and service SLAs. Building on this insight, we designed, implemented, and evaluated ERCache, an efficient and robust caching framework for large-scale user representations in ads recommendation systems on social networks. ERCache categorizes cache into direct and failover types and applies customized settings and eviction policies for each model, effectively balancing model complexity, embedding freshness, and service SLAs, even considering the staleness introduced by caching. ERCache has been deployed at Meta for over six months, supporting more than 30 ranking models while efficiently conserving computational resources and complying with service SLA requirements.

### Simultaneous Masking, Not Prompting Optimization: A Paradigm Shift in   Fine-tuning LLMs for Simultaneous Translation
**Authors**: Matthew Raffel, Victor Agostinelli, Lizhong Chen

**Updated**: 2024-10-09T01:12:19Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various language processing tasks, motivating their adoption in simultaneous translation. Current fine-tuning methods to adapt LLMs for simultaneous translation focus on prompting optimization strategies using either data augmentation or prompt structure modifications. However, these methods suffer from several issues, such as unnecessarily expanded training sets, computational inefficiency from dumping the key and value cache, increased prompt sizes, or restriction to a single decision policy. To eliminate these issues, in this work, we propose SimulMask, a new paradigm for fine-tuning LLMs for simultaneous translation. It utilizes a novel attention mask approach that models simultaneous translation during fine-tuning by masking attention for a desired decision policy. Applying the proposed SimulMask on a Falcon LLM for the IWSLT 2017 dataset, we have observed a significant translation quality improvement compared to state-of-the-art prompting optimization strategies on five language pairs while reducing the computational cost.

### KV Cache Compression, But What Must We Give in Return? A Comprehensive   Benchmark of Long Context Capable Approaches
**Authors**: Jiayi Yuan, Hongyi Liu, Shaochen Zhong, Yu-Neng Chuang, Songchen Li, Guanchu Wang, Duy Le, Hongye Jin, Vipin Chaudhary, Zhaozhuo Xu, Zirui Liu, Xia Hu

**Updated**: 2024-10-08T19:34:03Z

**Summary**: Long context capability is a crucial competency for large language models (LLMs) as it mitigates the human struggle to digest long-form texts. This capability enables complex task-solving scenarios such as book summarization, code assistance, and many more tasks that are traditionally manpower-intensive. However, transformer-based LLMs face significant challenges with long context input due to the growing size of the KV cache and the intrinsic complexity of attending to extended inputs; where multiple schools of efficiency-driven approaches - such as KV cache quantization, token dropping, prompt compression, linear-time sequence models, and hybrid architectures - have been proposed to produce efficient yet long context-capable models. Despite these advancements, no existing work has comprehensively benchmarked these methods in a reasonably aligned environment. In this work, we fill this gap by providing a taxonomy of current methods and evaluating 10+ state-of-the-art approaches across seven categories of long context tasks. Our work reveals numerous previously unknown phenomena and offers insights - as well as a friendly workbench - for the future development of long context-capable LLMs. The source code is available at https://github.com/henryzhongsc/longctx_bench.

### Numerical analysis of partial discharge ignition in H2 bubbles floating   in dielectric oils, for High-Voltage Solid State Transformer applications
**Authors**: Konstantinos Kourtzanidis, Panagiotis Dimitrakellis, Dimitrios Rakopoulos

**Updated**: 2024-10-08T11:28:30Z

**Summary**: We report on a self-consistent numerical analysis campaign of partial discharge (PD) ignition in H2 bubbles floating in biobased dielectric oils. We investigate various configurations (bubble sizes, bubble position, existence of protrusion) on a cylinder-to-cylinder setup that emulates a specific SST module (from SSTAR Horizon Europe project) under transient overvoltage as well as in its design operational conditions (VRMS = 66 kV, AC excitation of 50 Hz). Our results on electrical characteristics and plasma dynamics leading to the PD ignition, indicate that under transient overvoltage and for mm size bubbles (diameter 1 -4.5 mm), the smaller the bubble the less the inception voltage, while the peak inception voltage is higher than 70 kV. The existence of metallic protrusion can affect the inception voltage of a remote floating bubble only slightly and when this is close to the sharp tip. The extreme scenario of a protrusion in contact (inside) a gas bubble severely affects the insulation properties and drops the PD inception voltage remarkably. The larger the bubble and the sharper the tip of the protrusion the lower the inception peak voltage, that can reach values well below 40 kV. On the contrary and under design operation, larger bubbles increase the severity and probability of PD events, leading to lower instantaneous inception voltages. Current pulses produced in bubbles can quickly transit to intense streamer discharges (which can also transit to catastrophic arcing) if the operational frequency is reduced and/or under transient, HF overvoltage.

### Enhancing Playback Performance in Video Recommender Systems with an   On-Device Gating and Ranking Framework
**Authors**: Yunfei Yang, Zhenghao Qi, Honghuan Wu, Qi Song, Tieyao Zhang, Hao Li, Yimin Tu, Kaiqiao Zhan, Ben Wang

**Updated**: 2024-10-08T09:53:10Z

**Summary**: Video recommender systems (RSs) have gained increasing attention in recent years. Existing mainstream RSs focus on optimizing the matching function between users and items. However, we noticed that users frequently encounter playback issues such as slow loading or stuttering while browsing the videos, especially in weak network conditions, which will lead to a subpar browsing experience, and may cause users to leave, even when the video content and recommendations are superior. It is quite a serious issue, yet easily overlooked. To tackle this issue, we propose an on-device Gating and Ranking Framework (GRF) that cooperates with server-side RS. Specifically, we utilize a gate model to identify videos that may have playback issues in real-time, and then we employ a ranking model to select the optimal result from a locally-cached pool to replace the stuttering videos. Our solution has been fully deployed on Kwai, a large-scale short video platform with hundreds of millions of users globally. Moreover, it significantly enhances video playback performance and improves overall user experience and retention rates.

### A Scalable State Sharing Protocol for Low-Resource Validator Nodes in   Blockchain Networks
**Authors**: Ruben Hias, Weihong Wang, Jan Vanhoof, Tom Van Cutsem

**Updated**: 2024-10-08T09:46:38Z

**Summary**: The perpetual growth of data stored on popular blockchains such as Ethereum leads to significant scalability challenges and substantial storage costs for operators of full nodes. Increasing costs may lead to fewer independently operated nodes in the network, which poses risks to decentralization (and hence network security), but also pushes decentralized app developers towards centrally hosted API services.   This paper introduces a new protocol that allows validator nodes to participate in a blockchain network without the need to store the full state of the network on each node. The key idea is to use the blockchain network as both a replicated state machine and as a distributed storage system. By distributing states across nodes and enabling efficient data retrieval through a Kademlia-inspired routing protocol, we reduce storage costs for validators. Cryptographic proofs (such as Merkle proofs) are used to allow nodes to verify data stored by other nodes without having to trust those nodes directly. While the protocol trades off data storage for increased network bandwidth, we show how gossiping and caching can minimize the increased bandwidth needs.   To validate our state sharing protocol, we conduct an extensive quantitative analysis of Ethereum's data storage and data access patterns. Our findings indicate that while our protocol significantly lowers storage needs, it comes with an increased bandwidth usage ranging from 1.5 MB to 5 MB per block, translating to an additional monthly bandwidth of 319 GB to 1,065 GB. Despite this, the size remains small enough such that it can be passed to all nodes and validated within Ethereum's 12-second block validation window. Further analysis shows that Merkle proofs are the most significant contributor to the additional bandwidth. To address this concern, we also analyze the impact of switching to the more space-efficient Verkle Proofs.

### CItruS: Chunked Instruction-aware State Eviction for Long Sequence   Modeling
**Authors**: Yu Bai, Xiyuan Zou, Heyan Huang, Sanxing Chen, Marc-Antoine Rondeau, Yang Gao, Jackie Chi Kit Cheung

**Updated**: 2024-10-08T04:25:41Z

**Summary**: Long sequence modeling has gained broad interest as large language models (LLMs) continue to advance. Recent research has identified that a large portion of hidden states within the key-value caches of Transformer models can be discarded (also termed evicted) without affecting the perplexity performance in generating long sequences. However, we show that these methods, despite preserving perplexity performance, often drop information that is important for solving downstream tasks, a problem which we call information neglect. To address this issue, we introduce Chunked Instruction-aware State Eviction (CItruS), a novel modeling technique that integrates the attention preferences useful for a downstream task into the eviction process of hidden states. In addition, we design a method for chunked sequence processing to further improve efficiency. Our training-free method exhibits superior performance on long sequence comprehension and retrieval tasks over several strong baselines under the same memory budget, while preserving language modeling perplexity. The code and data have been released at https://github.com/ybai-nlp/CItruS.

### PrefixQuant: Static Quantization Beats Dynamic through Prefixed Outliers   in LLMs
**Authors**: Mengzhao Chen, Yi Liu, Jiahao Wang, Yi Bin, Wenqi Shao, Ping Luo

**Updated**: 2024-10-07T17:59:35Z

**Summary**: Quantization is essential for deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) by enhancing memory efficiency and inference speed. Existing methods for activation quantization mainly address channel-wise outliers, often neglecting token-wise outliers, leading to reliance on costly per-token dynamic quantization. To address this, we introduce PrefixQuant, a novel technique that isolates outlier tokens offline without re-training. Specifically, PrefixQuant identifies high-frequency outlier tokens and prefixes them in the KV cache, preventing the generation of outlier tokens during inference and simplifying quantization. To our knowledge, PrefixQuant is the first to enable efficient per-tensor static quantization to outperform expensive per-token dynamic quantization. For instance, in W4A4KV4 (4- bit weight, 4-bit activation, and 4-bit KV cache) Llama-3-8B, PrefixQuant with per-tensor static quantization achieves a 7.43 WikiText2 perplexity and 71.08% average accuracy on 5 common-sense reasoning tasks, outperforming previous per-token dynamic quantization methods like QuaRot with 0.98 perplexity improvement and +5.98 points accuracy. Additionally, the inference speed of W4A4 quantized models using PrefixQuant is 1.60x to 2.81x faster than FP16 models and exceeds QuaRot models by 1.2x to 1.3x. Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/ChenMnZ/PrefixQuant}.

### Stateful Large Language Model Serving with Pensieve
**Authors**: Lingfan Yu, Jinkun Lin, Jinyang Li

**Updated**: 2024-10-07T17:21:57Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are wildly popular today and it is important to serve them efficiently. Existing LLM serving systems are stateless across requests. Consequently, when LLMs are used in the common setting of multi-turn conversations, a growing log of the conversation history must be processed alongside any request by the serving system at each turn, resulting in repeated processing.   In this paper, we design $Pensieve$, a system optimized for multi-turn conversation LLM serving. $Pensieve$ maintains the conversation state across requests by caching previously processed history to avoid duplicate processing. $Pensieve$'s multi-tier caching strategy can utilize both GPU and CPU memory to efficiently store and retrieve cached data. $Pensieve$ also generalizes the recent PagedAttention kernel to support attention between multiple input tokens with a GPU cache spread over non-contiguous memory. Our evaluation shows that $Pensieve$ can achieve $1.14$-$3.0\times$ the throughput of vLLM and TensorRT-LLM and significantly reduce latency.

### KV-Compress: Paged KV-Cache Compression with Variable Compression Rates   per Attention Head
**Authors**: Isaac Rehg

**Updated**: 2024-10-07T15:07:09Z

**Summary**: Context lengths of Large Language Models (LLMs) have exploded in recent years, with 128k-token context becoming a standard and million-token context becoming a reality. Efficiently supporting long-context inference remains challenging as the memory that must be allocated in key-value (KV) cache for a generation scales with its context length, limiting the number of long-context requests that can be served concurrently under a given memory budget. KV cache compression can mitigate this issue by removing under-utilized KVs from each attention head's cache and reducing its memory footprint. Higher theoretical compression rates can be achieved when the number of removed KVs varies across attention heads, but application of such a strategy within existing inference frameworks adds fragmentation and cannot realize the theoretical compression rates in physical memory. We introduce KV-Compress, a novel compression method that evicts contiguous KV blocks within a PagedAttention framework, reducing the memory footprint of the KV cache proportionally to this theoretical compression rate. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on LongBench for both Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct while lowering the total number of compressed KVs by 4x compared with prior methods. Evaluations on Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-FP8 achieve compression rates up to 8x with negligible impact on performance, and up to 64x while retaining over 90% of full-cache performance for all but three of the suite's subsets. We benchmark an integration of our method with vLLM that increases total throughput by up to 5.18x by enabling larger decoding batches.

### TidalDecode: Fast and Accurate LLM Decoding with Position Persistent   Sparse Attention
**Authors**: Lijie Yang, Zhihao Zhang, Zhuofu Chen, Zikun Li, Zhihao Jia

**Updated**: 2024-10-07T14:30:27Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have driven significant advancements across diverse NLP tasks, with long-context models gaining prominence for handling extended inputs. However, the expanding key-value (KV) cache size required by Transformer architectures intensifies the memory constraints, particularly during the decoding phase, creating a significant bottleneck. Existing sparse attention mechanisms designed to address this bottleneck have two limitations: (1) they often fail to reliably identify the most relevant tokens for attention, and (2) they overlook the spatial coherence of token selection across consecutive Transformer layers, which can lead to performance degradation and substantial overhead in token selection. This paper introduces TidalDecode, a simple yet effective algorithm and system for fast and accurate LLM decoding through position persistent sparse attention. TidalDecode leverages the spatial coherence of tokens selected by existing sparse attention methods and introduces a few token selection layers that perform full attention to identify the tokens with the highest attention scores, while all other layers perform sparse attention with the pre-selected tokens. This design enables TidalDecode to substantially reduce the overhead of token selection for sparse attention without sacrificing the quality of the generated results. Evaluation on a diverse set of LLMs and tasks shows that TidalDecode closely matches the generative performance of full attention methods while reducing the LLM decoding latency by up to 2.1x.

### FAME: Towards Factual Multi-Task Model Editing
**Authors**: Li Zeng, Yingyu Shan, Zeming Liu, Jiashu Yao, Yuhang Guo

**Updated**: 2024-10-07T13:46:06Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) embed extensive knowledge and utilize it to perform exceptionally well across various tasks. Nevertheless, outdated knowledge or factual errors within LLMs can lead to misleading or incorrect responses, causing significant issues in practical applications. To rectify the fatal flaw without the necessity for costly model retraining, various model editing approaches have been proposed to correct inaccurate knowledge within LLMs in a cost-efficient way. To evaluate these model editing methods, previous work introduced a series of datasets. However, most of the previous datasets only contain fabricated data in a single format, which diverges from real-world model editing scenarios, raising doubts about their usability in practice. To facilitate the application of model editing in real-world scenarios, we propose the challenge of practicality. To resolve such challenges and effectively enhance the capabilities of LLMs, we present FAME, an factual, comprehensive, and multi-task dataset, which is designed to enhance the practicality of model editing. We then propose SKEME, a model editing method that uses a novel caching mechanism to ensure synchronization with the real world. The experiments demonstrate that SKEME performs excellently across various tasks and scenarios, confirming its practicality.

### Extended Functional Representation Lemma: A Tool For Privacy, Semantic   Representation, Caching, and Compression Design
**Authors**: Amirreza Zamani, Mikael Skoglund

**Updated**: 2024-10-07T13:33:23Z

**Summary**: This paper provides an overview of a problem in information-theoretic privacy mechanism design, addressing two scenarios in which private data is either observable or hidden. In each scenario, different privacy measures are used, including bounded mutual information and two types of per-letter privacy constraints. Considering the first scenario, an agent observes useful data that is correlated with private data, and wants to disclose the useful information to a user. Due to the privacy concerns, direct disclosure is prohibited. Hence, a privacy mechanism is designed to generate disclosed data which maximizes the revealed information about the useful data while satisfying a privacy constraint. In the second scenario, the agent has additionally access to the private data. We discuss how the Functional Representation Lemma, the Strong Functional Representation Lemma, and their extended versions are useful for designing low-complexity privacy mechanisms that achieve optimal privacy-utility trade-offs under certain constraints. Furthermore, another privacy design problem is presented where part of the private attribute is more private than the remaining part. Finally, we provide applications including semantic communications, caching and delivery, and compression designs, where the approach can be applied.

### Fast State Restoration in LLM Serving with HCache
**Authors**: Shiwei Gao, Youmin Chen, Jiwu Shu

**Updated**: 2024-10-07T13:03:45Z

**Summary**: The growing complexity of LLM usage today, e.g., multi-round conversation and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), makes contextual states (i.e., KV cache) reusable across user requests. Given the capacity constraints of GPU memory, only a limited number of contexts can be cached on GPU for reusing. Existing inference systems typically evict part of the KV cache and restore it by recomputing it from the original tokens or offloading it to host storage for later retrieval, both of which introduce substantial computational or I/O overheads. We propose HCache, a novel LLM state restoration method. Its key idea is to restore LLM states from intermediate activations and thus utilize computational and I/O resources with low overhead. We enhance HCache with two techniques, including i) a bubble-free restoration scheduler that integrates resource-complementary methods to optimize the balance between computation and IO tasks; and ii) a chunk-based storage manager to address the layout mismatch issue (i.e., layer-before-token saving versus token-before-layer restoration). Our evaluations, conducted using real-world tasks, show that HCache reduces the TTFT by up to 1.93X compared to KV offload while consuming 1.92-2.40X less storage space; compared to token recomputation, HCache achieves up to 5.73X reduction in TTFT.

### SpinQuant: LLM quantization with learned rotations
**Authors**: Zechun Liu, Changsheng Zhao, Igor Fedorov, Bilge Soran, Dhruv Choudhary, Raghuraman Krishnamoorthi, Vikas Chandra, Yuandong Tian, Tijmen Blankevoort

**Updated**: 2024-10-07T01:27:59Z

**Summary**: Post-training quantization (PTQ) techniques applied to weights, activations, and the KV cache greatly reduce memory usage, latency, and power consumption of Large Language Models (LLMs), but may lead to large quantization errors when outliers are present. Rotating activation or weight matrices helps remove outliers and benefits quantization. In this work, we identify a collection of applicable rotation parameterizations that lead to identical outputs in full-precision Transformer architectures while enhancing quantization accuracy. In addition, we find that some random rotations lead to much better quantization than others, with an up to 13 points difference in downstream zero-shot reasoning performance. As a result, we propose SpinQuant, a novel approach that incorporates learned rotation matrices for optimal quantized network accuracy. With 4-bit quantization of weight, activation, and KV-cache, SpinQuant narrows the accuracy gap on zero-shot reasoning tasks with full precision to merely 2.9 points on the LLaMA-2 7B model, surpassing LLM-QAT by 19.1 points and SmoothQuant by 25.0 points. Furthermore, SpinQuant also outperforms concurrent work QuaRot, which applies random rotations to remove outliers. In particular, for LLaMA-3 8B models that are hard to quantize, SpinQuant reduces the gap to full precision by up to 45.1% relative to QuaRot.

### Superposed Decoding: Multiple Generations from a Single Autoregressive   Inference Pass
**Authors**: Ethan Shen, Alan Fan, Sarah M. Pratt, Jae Sung Park, Matthew Wallingford, Sham M. Kakade, Ari Holtzman, Ranjay Krishna, Ali Farhadi, Aditya Kusupati

**Updated**: 2024-10-06T22:13:16Z

**Summary**: Many applications today provide users with multiple auto-complete drafts as they type, including GitHub's code completion, Gmail's smart compose, and Apple's messaging auto-suggestions. Under the hood, language models support this by running an autoregressive inference pass to provide a draft. Consequently, providing $k$ drafts to the user requires running an expensive language model $k$ times. To alleviate the computation cost of running $k$ inference passes, we propose Superposed Decoding, a new decoding algorithm that generates $k$ drafts at the computation cost of one autoregressive inference pass. We achieve this by feeding a superposition of the most recent token embeddings from the $k$ drafts as input to the next decoding step of the language model. At every inference step we combine the $k$ drafts with the top-$k$ tokens to get $k^2$ new drafts and cache the $k$ most likely options, using an n-gram interpolation with minimal compute overhead to filter out incoherent generations. Our experiments show that $k$ drafts from Superposed Decoding are at least as coherent and factual as Nucleus Sampling and Greedy Decoding respectively, while being at least $2.44\times$ faster for $k\ge3$. In a compute-normalized setting, user evaluations demonstrably favor text generated by Superposed Decoding over Nucleus Sampling. Superposed Decoding can also be combined with other decoding strategies, resulting in universal coverage gains when scaling inference time compute.

### Self-compensating Light Calorimetry with Liquid Argon Time Projection   Chamber for GeV Neutrino Physics
**Authors**: Xuyang Ning, Wei Shi, Chao Zhang, Ciro Riccio, Jay Hyun Jo

**Updated**: 2024-10-06T19:36:34Z

**Summary**: Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LArTPC) is an exceptional dual calorimeter capable of estimating the energy of incident particles through both the ionization charge and the scintillation light. Our studies show that due to the mechanisms of charge recombination and light generation involved in the energy dissipation in liquid argon, light calorimetry in LArTPCs is inherently self-compensating: the missing energy in the hadronic component is compensated for by the extra recombination luminescence compared to the electromagnetic component. Good compensation of the electron-to-hadron response ratio (e/h) around unity can be achieved across a broad range of drift electric fields from 0.2 to 1.8 kV/cm.This inherent self-compensation enhances the appeal of light calorimetry in LArTPCs, complementing the well-established charge calorimetry. Using GeV neutrinos as a case study, we show that light calorimetry can achieve an energy resolution comparable to the more sophisticated charge imaging calorimetry. The synergy between light and charge calorimetry offers a novel approach to evaluating and mitigating systematic uncertainties in energy measurements with LArTPCs.

### Lazy Qubit Reordering for Accelerating Parallel State-Vector-based   Quantum Circuit Simulation
**Authors**: Yusuke Teranishi, Shoma Hiraoka, Wataru Mizukami, Masao Okita, Fumihiko Ino

**Updated**: 2024-10-05T18:20:37Z

**Summary**: This paper proposes two quantum operation scheduling methods for accelerating parallel state-vector-based quantum circuit simulation using multiple graphics processing units (GPUs). The proposed methods reduce all-to-all communication caused by qubit reordering (QR), which can dominate the overhead of parallel simulation. Our approach eliminates redundant QRs by introducing intentional delays in QR communications such that multiple QRs can be aggregated into a single QR. The delays are carefully introduced based on the principles of time-space tiling, or a cache optimization technique for classical computers, which we use to arrange the execution order of quantum operations. Moreover, we present an extended scheduling method for the hierarchical interconnection of GPU cluster systems to avoid slow inter-node communication. We develop these methods tailored for two primary procedures in variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) simulation: quantum state update (QSU) and expectation value computation (EVC). Experimental validation on 32-GPU executions demonstrates acceleration in QSU and EVC -- up to 54$\times$ and 606$\times$, respectively -- compared to existing methods. Moreover, our extended scheduling method further reduced communication time by up to 15\% in a two-layered interconnected cluster system. Our approach is useful for any quantum circuit simulations, including QSU and/or EVC.

### SwiftKV: Fast Prefill-Optimized Inference with Knowledge-Preserving   Model Transformation
**Authors**: Aurick Qiao, Zhewei Yao, Samyam Rajbhandari, Yuxiong He

**Updated**: 2024-10-04T22:45:26Z

**Summary**: LLM inference for popular enterprise use cases, such as summarization, RAG, and code-generation, typically observes orders of magnitude longer prompt lengths than generation lengths. This characteristic leads to high cost of prefill and increased response latency. In this paper, we present SwiftKV, a novel model transformation and distillation procedure specifically designed to reduce the time and cost of processing prompt tokens while preserving high quality of generated tokens. SwiftKV combines three key mechanisms: i) SingleInputKV, which prefills later layers' KV cache using a much earlier layer's output, allowing prompt tokens to skip much of the model computation, ii) AcrossKV, which merges the KV caches of neighboring layers to reduce the memory footprint and support larger batch size for higher throughput, and iii) a knowledge-preserving distillation procedure that can adapt existing LLMs for SwiftKV with minimal accuracy impact and low compute and data requirement. For Llama-3.1-8B and 70B, SwiftKV reduces the compute requirement of prefill by 50% and the memory requirement of the KV cache by 62.5% while incurring minimum quality degradation across a wide range of tasks. In the end-to-end inference serving using an optimized vLLM implementation, SwiftKV realizes up to 2x higher aggregate throughput and 60% lower time per output token. It can achieve a staggering 560 TFlops/GPU of normalized inference throughput, which translates to 16K tokens/s for Llama-3.1-70B in 16-bit precision on 4x H100 GPUs.

**Authors**: Noah Martin, Abdullah Bin Faisal, Hiba Eltigani, Rukhshan Haroon, Swaminathan Lamelas, Fahad Dogar

**Updated**: 2024-10-04T15:23:28Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we make a case for a proxy for large language models which has explicit support for cost-saving optimizations. We design LLMProxy, which supports three key optimizations: model selection, context management, and caching. These optimizations present tradeoffs in terms of cost, inference time, and response quality, which applications can navigate through our high level, bidirectional interface. As a case study, we implement a WhatsApp-based Q&A service that uses LLMProxy to provide a rich set of features to the users. This service is deployed on a small scale (100+ users) leveraging the cloud; it has been operational for 15+ weeks and users have asked 1400+ questions so far. We report on the experiences of running this service as well as microbenchmark the specific benefits of the various cost-optimizations we present in this paper.

### HarmoniCa: Harmonizing Training and Inference for Better Feature Cache   in Diffusion Transformer Acceleration
**Authors**: Yushi Huang, Zining Wang, Ruihao Gong, Jing Liu, Xinjie Zhang, Jun Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-10-04T10:14:17Z

**Summary**: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have gained prominence for outstanding scalability and extraordinary performance in generative tasks. However, their considerable inference costs impede practical deployment. The feature cache mechanism, which involves storing and retrieving redundant computations across timesteps, holds promise for reducing per-step inference time in diffusion models. Most existing caching methods for DiT are manually designed. Although the learning-based approach attempts to optimize strategies adaptively, it suffers from discrepancies between training and inference, which hampers both the performance and acceleration ratio. Upon detailed analysis, we pinpoint that these discrepancies primarily stem from two aspects: (1) Prior Timestep Disregard, where training ignores the effect of cache usage at earlier timesteps, and (2) Objective Mismatch, where the training target (align predicted noise in each timestep) deviates from the goal of inference (generate the high-quality image). To alleviate these discrepancies, we propose HarmoniCa, a novel method that Harmonizes training and inference with a novel learning-based Caching framework built upon Step-Wise Denoising Training (SDT) and Image Error Proxy-Guided Objective (IEPO). Compared to the traditional training paradigm, the newly proposed SDT maintains the continuity of the denoising process, enabling the model to leverage information from prior timesteps during training, similar to the way it operates during inference. Furthermore, we design IEPO, which integrates an efficient proxy mechanism to approximate the final image error caused by reusing the cached feature. Therefore, IEPO helps balance final image quality and cache utilization, resolving the issue of training that only considers the impact of cache usage on the predicted output at each timestep.

### Unleashing the Potential of the Diffusion Model in Few-shot Semantic   Segmentation
**Authors**: Muzhi Zhu, Yang Liu, Zekai Luo, Chenchen Jing, Hao Chen, Guangkai Xu, Xinlong Wang, Chunhua Shen

**Updated**: 2024-10-04T07:54:58Z

**Summary**: The Diffusion Model has not only garnered noteworthy achievements in the realm of image generation but has also demonstrated its potential as an effective pretraining method utilizing unlabeled data. Drawing from the extensive potential unveiled by the Diffusion Model in both semantic correspondence and open vocabulary segmentation, our work initiates an investigation into employing the Latent Diffusion Model for Few-shot Semantic Segmentation. Recently, inspired by the in-context learning ability of large language models, Few-shot Semantic Segmentation has evolved into In-context Segmentation tasks, morphing into a crucial element in assessing generalist segmentation models. In this context, we concentrate on Few-shot Semantic Segmentation, establishing a solid foundation for the future development of a Diffusion-based generalist model for segmentation. Our initial focus lies in understanding how to facilitate interaction between the query image and the support image, resulting in the proposal of a KV fusion method within the self-attention framework. Subsequently, we delve deeper into optimizing the infusion of information from the support mask and simultaneously re-evaluating how to provide reasonable supervision from the query mask. Based on our analysis, we establish a simple and effective framework named DiffewS, maximally retaining the original Latent Diffusion Model's generative framework and effectively utilizing the pre-training prior. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the previous SOTA models in multiple settings.

### Prefixing Attention Sinks can Mitigate Activation Outliers for Large   Language Model Quantization
**Authors**: Seungwoo Son, Wonpyo Park, Woohyun Han, Kyuyeun Kim, Jaeho Lee

**Updated**: 2024-10-04T06:26:20Z

**Summary**: Despite recent advances in LLM quantization, activation quantization remains to be challenging due to the activation outliers. Conventional remedies, e.g., mixing precisions for different channels, introduce extra overhead and reduce the speedup. In this work, we develop a simple yet effective strategy to facilitate per-tensor activation quantization by preventing the generation of problematic tokens. Precisely, we propose a method to find a set of key-value cache, coined CushionCache, which mitigates outliers in subsequent tokens when inserted as a prefix. CushionCache works in two steps: First, we greedily search for a prompt token sequence that minimizes the maximum activation values in subsequent tokens. Then, we further tune the token cache to regularize the activations of subsequent tokens to be more quantization-friendly. The proposed method successfully addresses activation outliers of LLMs, providing a substantial performance boost for per-tensor activation quantization methods. We thoroughly evaluate our method over a wide range of models and benchmarks and find that it significantly surpasses the established baseline of per-tensor W8A8 quantization and can be seamlessly integrated with the recent activation quantization method.

### LoRC: Low-Rank Compression for LLMs KV Cache with a Progressive   Compression Strategy
**Authors**: Rongzhi Zhang, Kuang Wang, Liyuan Liu, Shuohang Wang, Hao Cheng, Chao Zhang, Yelong Shen

**Updated**: 2024-10-04T03:10:53Z

**Summary**: The Key-Value (KV) cache is a crucial component in serving transformer-based autoregressive large language models (LLMs), enabling faster inference by storing previously computed KV vectors. However, its memory consumption scales linearly with sequence length and batch size, posing a significant bottleneck in LLM deployment. Existing approaches to mitigate this issue include: (1) efficient attention variants integrated in upcycling stages, which requires extensive parameter tuning thus unsuitable for pre-trained LLMs; (2) KV cache compression at test time, primarily through token eviction policies, which often overlook inter-layer dependencies and can be task-specific.   This paper introduces an orthogonal approach to KV cache compression. We propose a low-rank approximation of KV weight matrices, allowing for plug-in integration with existing transformer-based LLMs without model retraining. To effectively compress KV cache at the weight level, we adjust for layerwise sensitivity and introduce a progressive compression strategy, which is supported by our theoretical analysis on how compression errors accumulate in deep networks. Our method is designed to function without model tuning in upcycling stages or task-specific profiling in test stages. Extensive experiments with LLaMA models ranging from 8B to 70B parameters across various tasks show that our approach significantly reduces the GPU memory footprint while maintaining performance.

### UNComp: Uncertainty-Aware Long-Context Compressor for Efficient Large   Language Model Inference
**Authors**: Jing Xiong, Jianghan Shen, Fanghua Ye, Chaofan Tao, Zhongwei Wan, Jianqiao Lu, Xun Wu, Chuanyang Zheng, Zhijiang Guo, Lingpeng Kong, Ngai Wong

**Updated**: 2024-10-04T02:32:36Z

**Summary**: Deploying large language models (LLMs) is challenging due to their high memory and computational demands, especially during long-context inference. While key-value (KV) caching accelerates inference by reusing previously computed keys and values, it also introduces significant memory overhead. Existing KV cache compression methods such as eviction and merging typically compress the KV cache after it is generated and overlook the eviction of hidden states, failing to improve the speed of the prefilling stage. Additionally, applying a uniform compression rate across different attention heads can harm crucial retrieval heads in needle-in-a-haystack tasks due to excessive compression. In this paper, we propose UNComp, an uncertainty-aware compression scheme that leverages matrix entropy to estimate model uncertainty across layers and heads at the token sequence level. By grouping layers and heads based on their uncertainty, UNComp adaptively compresses both the hidden states and the KV cache. Our method achieves a 1.6x speedup in the prefilling stage and reduces the KV cache to 4.74% of its original size, resulting in a 6.4x increase in throughput and a 1.4x speedup in inference with only a 1.41% performance loss. Remarkably, in needle-in-a-haystack tasks, UNComp outperforms the full-size KV cache even when compressed to 9.38% of its original size. Our approach offers an efficient, training-free Grouped-Query Attention paradigm that can be seamlessly integrated into existing KV cache schemes.

### Compute Or Load KV Cache? Why Not Both?
**Authors**: Shuowei Jin, Xueshen Liu, Qingzhao Zhang, Z. Morley Mao

**Updated**: 2024-10-04T01:11:09Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly increased context window sizes, enabling sophisticated applications but also introducing substantial computational overheads, particularly computing key-value (KV) cache in the prefill stage. Prefix caching has emerged to save GPU power in this scenario, which saves KV cache at disks and reuse them across multiple queries. However, traditional prefix caching mechanisms often suffer from substantial latency because the speed of loading KV cache from disks to GPU memory is bottlenecked by the throughput of I/O devices. To optimize the latency of long-context prefill, we propose Cake, a novel KV cache loader, which employs a bidirectional parallelized KV cache generation strategy. Upon receiving a prefill task, Cake simultaneously and dynamically loads saved KV cache from prefix cache locations and computes KV cache on local GPUs, maximizing the utilization of available computation and I/O bandwidth resources. Additionally, Cake automatically adapts to diverse system statuses without manual parameter. tuning. In experiments on various prompt datasets, GPUs, and I/O devices, Cake offers up to 68.1% Time To First Token (TTFT) reduction compare with compute-only method and 94.6% TTFT reduction compare with I/O-only method.

### DeFT: Decoding with Flash Tree-attention for Efficient Tree-structured   LLM Inference
**Authors**: Jinwei Yao, Kaiqi Chen, Kexun Zhang, Jiaxuan You, Binhang Yuan, Zeke Wang, Tao Lin

**Updated**: 2024-10-03T22:17:01Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly employed for complex tasks that process multiple generation calls in a tree structure with shared prefixes of tokens, including few-shot prompting, multi-step reasoning, speculative decoding, etc. However, existing inference systems for tree-based applications are inefficient due to improper partitioning of queries and KV cache during attention calculation. This leads to two main issues: (1) a lack of memory access (IO) reuse for KV cache of shared prefixes, and (2) poor load balancing.As a result, there is redundant KV cache IO between GPU global memory and shared memory, along with low GPU utilization. To address these challenges, we propose DeFT(Decoding with Flash Tree-Attention), a hardware-efficient attention algorithm with prefix-aware and load-balanced KV cache partitions. DeFT reduces the number of read/write operations of KV cache during attention calculation through KV-Guided Grouping, a method that avoids repeatedly loading KV cache of shared prefixes in attention computation. Additionally, we propose Flattened Tree KV Splitting, a mechanism that ensures even distribution of the KV cache across partitions with little computation redundancy, enhancing GPU utilization during attention computations. By reducing 73-99 KV cache IO and nearly 100 IO for partial results during attention calculation, DeFT achieves up to 2.52/3.82x speedup in the end-to-end/attention latency across three practical tree-based workloads compared to state-of-the-art attention algorithms.

### GaNI: Global and Near Field Illumination Aware Neural Inverse Rendering
**Authors**: Jiaye Wu, Saeed Hadadan, Geng Lin, Matthias Zwicker, David Jacobs, Roni Sengupta

**Updated**: 2024-10-03T22:11:19Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we present GaNI, a Global and Near-field Illumination-aware neural inverse rendering technique that can reconstruct geometry, albedo, and roughness parameters from images of a scene captured with co-located light and camera. Existing inverse rendering techniques with co-located light-camera focus on single objects only, without modeling global illumination and near-field lighting more prominent in scenes with multiple objects. We introduce a system that solves this problem in two stages; we first reconstruct the geometry powered by neural volumetric rendering NeuS, followed by inverse neural radiosity that uses the previously predicted geometry to estimate albedo and roughness. However, such a naive combination fails and we propose multiple technical contributions that enable this two-stage approach. We observe that NeuS fails to handle near-field illumination and strong specular reflections from the flashlight in a scene. We propose to implicitly model the effects of near-field illumination and introduce a surface angle loss function to handle specular reflections. Similarly, we observe that invNeRad assumes constant illumination throughout the capture and cannot handle moving flashlights during capture. We propose a light position-aware radiance cache network and additional smoothness priors on roughness to reconstruct reflectance. Experimental evaluation on synthetic and real data shows that our method outperforms the existing co-located light-camera-based inverse rendering techniques. Our approach produces significantly better reflectance and slightly better geometry than capture strategies that do not require a dark room.

### ReLIC: A Recipe for 64k Steps of In-Context Reinforcement Learning for   Embodied AI
**Authors**: Ahmad Elawady, Gunjan Chhablani, Ram Ramrakhya, Karmesh Yadav, Dhruv Batra, Zsolt Kira, Andrew Szot

**Updated**: 2024-10-03T17:58:11Z

**Summary**: Intelligent embodied agents need to quickly adapt to new scenarios by integrating long histories of experience into decision-making. For instance, a robot in an unfamiliar house initially wouldn't know the locations of objects needed for tasks and might perform inefficiently. However, as it gathers more experience, it should learn the layout of its environment and remember where objects are, allowing it to complete new tasks more efficiently. To enable such rapid adaptation to new tasks, we present ReLIC, a new approach for in-context reinforcement learning (RL) for embodied agents. With ReLIC, agents are capable of adapting to new environments using 64,000 steps of in-context experience with full attention while being trained through self-generated experience via RL. We achieve this by proposing a novel policy update scheme for on-policy RL called "partial updates'' as well as a Sink-KV mechanism that enables effective utilization of a long observation history for embodied agents. Our method outperforms a variety of meta-RL baselines in adapting to unseen houses in an embodied multi-object navigation task. In addition, we find that ReLIC is capable of few-shot imitation learning despite never being trained with expert demonstrations. We also provide a comprehensive analysis of ReLIC, highlighting that the combination of large-scale RL training, the proposed partial updates scheme, and the Sink-KV are essential for effective in-context learning. The code for ReLIC and all our experiments is at https://github.com/aielawady/relic

### Preble: Efficient Distributed Prompt Scheduling for LLM Serving
**Authors**: Vikranth Srivatsa, Zijian He, Reyna Abhyankar, Dongming Li, Yiying Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-10-03T17:50:33Z

**Summary**: Prompts to large language models (LLMs) have evolved beyond simple user questions. For LLMs to solve complex problems, today's practices are to include domain-specific instructions, illustration of tool usages, and/or long context such as textbook chapters in prompts. As such, many parts of prompts are repetitive across requests. Recent works propose to cache and reuse KV state of prompts. However, they are all confined to a single-GPU optimization, while production LLM serving systems are distributed by nature.   This paper proposes Preble, the first distributed LLM serving platform that targets and optimizes for prompt sharing. We designed a distributed scheduling system that co-optimizes KV state reuse and computation load-balancing with a new scheduling algorithm and a hierarchical scheduling mechanism. Our evaluation of Preble with real workloads and request arrival patterns on two open-source LLMs shows that Preble outperforms the SOTA serving systems by 1.5X to 14.5X on average latency and 2X to 10X on p99 latency.

### Disaggregated Memory with SmartNIC Offloading: a Case Study on Graph   Processing
**Authors**: Jacob Wahlgren, Gabin Schieffer, Maya Gokhale, Roger Pearce, Ivy Peng

**Updated**: 2024-10-03T15:41:31Z

**Summary**: Disaggregated memory breaks the boundary of monolithic servers to enable memory provisioning on demand. Using network-attached memory to provide memory expansion for memory-intensive applications on compute nodes can improve the overall memory utilization on a cluster and reduce the total cost of ownership. However, current software solutions for leveraging network-attached memory must consume resources on the compute node for memory management tasks. Emerging off-path smartNICs provide general-purpose programmability at low-cost low-power cores. This work provides a general architecture design that enables network-attached memory and offloading tasks onto off-path programmable SmartNIC. We provide a prototype implementation called SODA on Nvidia BlueField DPU. SODA adapts communication paths and data transfer alternatives, pipelines data movement stages, and enables customizable data caching and prefetching optimizations. We evaluate SODA in five representative graph applications on real-world graphs. Our results show that SODA can achieve up to 7.9x speedup compared to node-local SSD and reduce network traffic by 42% compared to disaggregated memory without SmartNIC offloading at similar or better performance.

### Learning from Offline Foundation Features with Tensor Augmentations
**Authors**: Emir Konuk, Christos Matsoukas, Moein Sorkhei, Phitchapha Lertsiravaramet, Kevin Smith

**Updated**: 2024-10-03T14:35:35Z

**Summary**: We introduce Learning from Offline Foundation Features with Tensor Augmentations (LOFF-TA), an efficient training scheme designed to harness the capabilities of foundation models in limited resource settings where their direct development is not feasible. LOFF-TA involves training a compact classifier on cached feature embeddings from a frozen foundation model, resulting in up to $37\times$ faster training and up to $26\times$ reduced GPU memory usage. Because the embeddings of augmented images would be too numerous to store, yet the augmentation process is essential for training, we propose to apply tensor augmentations to the cached embeddings of the original non-augmented images. LOFF-TA makes it possible to leverage the power of foundation models, regardless of their size, in settings with limited computational capacity. Moreover, LOFF-TA can be used to apply foundation models to high-resolution images without increasing compute. In certain scenarios, we find that training with LOFF-TA yields better results than directly fine-tuning the foundation model.

### Sub-cycle Nanotip Field Emission of Electrons Driven by Air Plasma   Generated THz Pulses
**Authors**: Benjamin Colmey, Rodrigo T. Paulino, Gaspard Beaufort, David G. Cooke

**Updated**: 2024-10-03T11:47:21Z

**Summary**: Terahertz pulses generated by two-color laser plasmas have reported peak field strengths exceeding MV/cm, and when illuminating metal nanotips the near-field enhancement at the tip apex should result in extremely high bunch charges and electron energies via sub-cycle cold field emission. Here, electron emission from tungsten nanotips driven by THz pulses generated by a long filament air-plasma are reported. Electron energies up to 1.1 keV and bunch charges up to 2x$10^5$ electrons per pulse were detected, well below values expected for peak field calculated via the time averaged Poynting vector. Investigations revealed a failure in the use of the time-averaged Poynting vector when applied to long filament THz pulses, due to spatio-temporal restructuring of the THz pulse in the focus. Accounting for this restructuring significantly reduces the field strength to approximately 160 ~kV/cm, consistent with the observed electron bunch charges, peak energies and their dependence on the tip position in the THz focus. Despite these findings, our results surpass previous THz plasma-driven electron generation by an order of magnitude in both electron energy and bunch charge and a path to increasing these by an additional order of magnitude by modification of the THz optics is proposed.

### PyramidKV: Dynamic KV Cache Compression based on Pyramidal Information   Funneling
**Authors**: Zefan Cai, Yichi Zhang, Bofei Gao, Yuliang Liu, Tianyu Liu, Keming Lu, Wayne Xiong, Yue Dong, Baobao Chang, Junjie Hu, Wen Xiao

**Updated**: 2024-10-03T08:46:42Z

**Summary**: In this study, we investigate whether attention-based information flow inside large language models (LLMs) is aggregated through noticeable patterns for long context processing. Our observations reveal that LLMs aggregate information through Pyramidal Information Funneling where attention is scattering widely in lower layers, progressively consolidating within specific contexts, and ultimately focusing on critical tokens (a.k.a massive activation or attention sink) in higher layers. Motivated by these insights, we developed PyramidKV, a novel and effective KV cache compression method. This approach dynamically adjusts the KV cache size across different layers, allocating more cache in lower layers and less in higher ones, diverging from traditional methods that maintain a uniform KV cache size. Our experimental evaluations, utilizing the LongBench benchmark, show that PyramidKV matches the performance of models with a full KV cache while retaining only 12% of the KV cache, thus significantly reducing memory usage. In scenarios emphasizing memory efficiency, where only 0.7% of the KV cache is maintained, PyramidKV surpasses other KV cache compression techniques, achieving up to a 20.5 absolute accuracy improvement on TREC dataset. In the Needle-in-a-Haystack experiment, PyramidKV outperforms competing methods in maintaining long-context comprehension in LLMs; notably, retaining just 128 KV cache entries enables the LLAMA-3-70B model to achieve 100% Acc. performance, matching that of a full KV cache.

**Authors**: Yuhui Xu, Zhanming Jie, Hanze Dong, Lei Wang, Xudong Lu, Aojun Zhou, Amrita Saha, Caiming Xiong, Doyen Sahoo

**Updated**: 2024-10-03T03:03:29Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized the field of natural language processing, achieving unprecedented performance across a variety of applications. However, their increased computational and memory demands present significant challenges, especially when handling long sequences. This paper focuses on the long-context scenario, addressing the inefficiencies in KV cache memory consumption during inference. Unlike existing approaches that optimize the memory based on the sequence length, we identify substantial redundancy in the channel dimension of the KV cache, as indicated by an uneven magnitude distribution and a low-rank structure in the attention weights. In response, we propose ThinK, a novel query-dependent KV cache pruning method designed to minimize attention weight loss while selectively pruning the least significant channels. Our approach not only maintains or enhances model accuracy but also achieves a reduction in KV cache memory costs by over 20% compared with vanilla KV cache eviction and quantization methods. For instance, ThinK integrated with KIVI can achieve a 2.8x reduction in peak memory usage while maintaining nearly the same quality, enabling up to a 5x increase in batch size when using a single GPU. Extensive evaluations on the LLaMA and Mistral models across various long-sequence datasets verified the efficiency of ThinK, establishing a new baseline algorithm for efficient LLM deployment without compromising performance.

### Locret: Enhancing Eviction in Long-Context LLM Inference with Trained   Retaining Heads
**Authors**: Yuxiang Huang, Binhang Yuan, Xu Han, Chaojun Xiao, Zhiyuan Liu

**Updated**: 2024-10-02T17:59:52Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable advances in supporting long-context comprehension and processing tasks. However, scaling the generation inference of LLMs to such long contexts incurs significant additional computation load, and demands a substantial GPU memory footprint to maintain the key-value (KV) cache of transformer-based LLMs. Existing KV cache compression methods, such as quantization, face memory bottlenecks as context length increases, while static-sized caches, such as eviction, suffer from inefficient policies. These limitations restrict deployment on consumer-grade devices like a single Nvidia 4090 GPU. To overcome this, we propose Locret, a framework for long-context LLM inference that introduces retaining heads to evaluate the causal importance of KV cache units, allowing for more accurate eviction within a fixed cache size. Locret is fine-tuned on top of the frozen backbone LLM using a minimal amount of data from standard long-context SFT datasets. During inference, we evict low-importance cache units along with a chunked prefill pattern, significantly reducing peak GPU memory usage. We conduct an extensive empirical study to evaluate Locret, where the experimental results show that Locret outperforms the recent competitive approaches, including InfLLM, Quantization, SirLLM, and MInference, in terms of memory efficiency and the quality of generated contents -- Locret achieves over a 20x and 8x KV cache compression ratio compared to the full KV cache for Phi-3-mini-128K and Llama-3.1-8B-instruct. Additionally, Locret can be combined with other methods, such as quantization and token merging. To our knowledge, Locret is the first framework capable of deploying Llama-3.1-8B or similar models on a single Nvidia 4090 GPU, enabling 128K long-context inference without compromising generation quality, and requiring little additional system optimizations.

**Authors**: Daniel Skachkov, Denis Ponomaryov, Yuri Dorn, Alexander Demin

**Updated**: 2024-10-02T17:14:47Z

**Summary**: We address the problem of learning-augmented online caching in the scenario when each request is accompanied by a prediction of the next occurrence of the requested page. We improve currently known bounds on the competitive ratio of the BlindOracle algorithm, which evicts a page predicted to be requested last. We also prove a lower bound on the competitive ratio of any randomized algorithm and show that a combination of the BlindOracle with the Marker algorithm achieves a competitive ratio that is optimal up to some constant.

### FutureFill: Fast Generation from Convolutional Sequence Models
**Authors**: Naman Agarwal, Xinyi Chen, Evan Dogariu, Vlad Feinberg, Daniel Suo, Peter Bartlett, Elad Hazan

**Updated**: 2024-10-02T15:22:08Z

**Summary**: We address the challenge of efficient auto-regressive generation in sequence prediction models by introducing FutureFill: a method for fast generation that applies to any sequence prediction algorithm based on convolutional operators. Our approach reduces the generation time requirement from linear to square root relative to the context length. Additionally, FutureFill requires a prefill cache sized only by the number of tokens generated, which is smaller than the cache requirements for standard convolutional and attention-based models. We validate our theoretical findings with experimental evidence demonstrating correctness and efficiency gains in a synthetic generation task.

### InfiniPot: Infinite Context Processing on Memory-Constrained LLMs
**Authors**: Minsoo Kim, Kyuhong Shim, Jungwook Choi, Simyung Chang

**Updated**: 2024-10-02T13:09:41Z

**Summary**: Handling long input contexts remains a significant challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly in resource-constrained environments such as mobile devices. Our work aims to address this limitation by introducing InfiniPot, a novel KV cache control framework designed to enable pre-trained LLMs to manage extensive sequences within fixed memory constraints efficiently, without requiring additional training. InfiniPot leverages Continual Context Distillation (CCD), an iterative process that compresses and retains essential information through novel importance metrics, effectively maintaining critical data even without access to future context. Our comprehensive evaluations indicate that InfiniPot significantly outperforms models trained for long contexts in various NLP tasks, establishing its efficacy and versatility. This work represents a substantial advancement toward making LLMs applicable to a broader range of real-world scenarios.

### A Little Goes a Long Way: Efficient Long Context Training and Inference   with Partial Contexts
**Authors**: Suyu Ge, Xihui Lin, Yunan Zhang, Jiawei Han, Hao Peng

**Updated**: 2024-10-02T12:35:53Z

**Summary**: Training and serving long-context large language models (LLMs) incurs substantial overhead. To address this, two critical steps are often required: a pretrained LLM typically undergoes a separate stage for context length extension by training on long-context data, followed by architectural modifications to reduce the overhead of KV cache during serving. This paper argues that integrating length extension with a GPU-friendly KV cache reduction architecture not only reduces training overhead during length extension, but also achieves better long-context performance. This leads to our proposed LongGen, which finetunes a pretrained LLM into an efficient architecture during length extension. LongGen builds on three key insights: (1) Sparse attention patterns, such as window attention (attending to recent tokens), attention sink (initial ones), and blockwise sparse attention (strided token blocks) are well-suited for building efficient long-context models, primarily due to their GPU-friendly memory access patterns, enabling efficiency gains not just theoretically but in practice as well. (2) It is essential for the model to have direct access to all tokens. A hybrid architecture with 1/3 full attention layers and 2/3 efficient ones achieves a balanced trade-off between efficiency and long-context performance. (3) Lightweight training on 5B long-context data is sufficient to extend the hybrid model's context length from 4K to 128K.   We evaluate LongGen on both Llama-2 7B and Llama-2 70B, demonstrating its effectiveness across different scales. During training with 128K-long contexts, LongGen achieves 1.55x training speedup and reduces wall-clock time by 36%, compared to a full-attention baseline. During inference, LongGen reduces KV cache memory by 62%, achieving 1.67x prefilling speedup and 1.41x decoding speedup.

### Attention Score is not All You Need for Token Importance Indicator in KV   Cache Reduction: Value Also Matters
**Authors**: Zhiyu Guo, Hidetaka Kamigaito, Taro Watanabe

**Updated**: 2024-10-02T00:19:13Z

**Summary**: Scaling the context size of large language models (LLMs) enables them to perform various new tasks, e.g., book summarization. However, the memory cost of the Key and Value (KV) cache in attention significantly limits the practical applications of LLMs. Recent works have explored token pruning for KV cache reduction in LLMs, relying solely on attention scores as a token importance indicator. However, our investigation into value vector norms revealed a notably non-uniform pattern questioning their reliance only on attention scores. Inspired by this, we propose a new method: Value-Aware Token Pruning (VATP) which uses both attention scores and the $ \ell_{1} $ norm of value vectors to evaluate token importance. Extensive experiments on LLaMA2-7B-chat and Vicuna-v1.5-7B across 16 LongBench tasks demonstrate that VATP outperforms attention-score-only baselines in over 12 tasks, confirming the effectiveness of incorporating value vector norms into token importance evaluation of LLMs.

### PARSIR: a Package for Effective Parallel Discrete Event Simulation on   Multi-processor Machines
**Authors**: Francesco Quaglia

**Updated**: 2024-10-01T12:55:47Z

**Summary**: In this article we present PARSIR (PARallel SImulation Runner), a package that enables the effective exploitation of shared-memory multi-processor machines for running discrete event simulation models. PARSIR is a compile/run-time environment for discrete event simulation models developed with the {\tt C} programming language. The architecture of PARSIR has been designed in order to keep low the amount of CPU-cycles required for running models. This is achieved via the combination of a set of techniques like: 1) causally consistent batch-processing of simulation events at an individual simulation object for caching effectiveness; 2) high likelihood of disjoint access parallelism; 3) the favoring of memory accesses on local NUMA (Non-Uniform-Memory-Access) nodes in the architecture, while still enabling well balanced workload distribution via work-stealing from remote nodes; 4) the use of RMW (Read-Modify-Write) machine instructions for fast access to simulation engine data required by the worker threads for managing the concurrent simulation objects and distributing the workload. Furthermore, any architectural solution embedded in the PARSIR engine is fully transparent to the application level code implementing the simulation model. We also provide experimental results showing the effectiveness of PARSIR when running the reference PHOLD benchmark on a NUMA shared-memory multi-processor machine equipped with 40 CPUs.

### Fine-Grained Vectorized Merge Sorting on RISC-V: From Register to Cache
**Authors**: Jin Zhang, Jincheng Zhou, Xiang Zhang, Di Ma, Chunye Gong

**Updated**: 2024-10-01T07:19:21Z

**Summary**: Merge sort as a divide-sort-merge paradigm has been widely applied in computer science fields. As modern reduced instruction set computing architectures like the fifth generation (RISC-V) regard multiple registers as a vector register group for wide instruction parallelism, optimizing merge sort with this vectorized property is becoming increasingly common. In this paper, we overhaul the divide-sort-merge paradigm, from its register-level sort to the cache-aware merge, to develop a fine-grained RISC-V vectorized merge sort (RVMS). From the register-level view, the inline vectorized transpose instruction is missed in RISC-V, so implementing it efficiently is non-trivial. Besides, the vectorized comparisons do not always work well in the merging networks. Both issues primarily stem from the expensive data shuffle instruction. To bypass it, RVMS strides to take register data as the proxy of data shuffle to accelerate the transpose operation, and meanwhile replaces vectorized comparisons with scalar cousin for more light real value swap. On the other hand, as cache-aware merge makes larger data merge in the cache, most merge schemes have two drawbacks: the in-cache merge usually has low cache utilization, while the out-of-cache merging network remains an ineffectively symmetric structure. To this end, we propose the half-merge scheme to employ the auxiliary space of in-place merge to halve the footprint of naive merge sort, and meanwhile copy one sequence to this space to avoid the former data exchange. Furthermore, an asymmetric merging network is developed to adapt to two different input sizes.

### Block-Attention for Efficient RAG
**Authors**: East Sun, Yan Wang, Lan Tian

**Updated**: 2024-10-01T03:40:08Z

**Summary**: We introduce Block-Attention, an attention mechanism designed to address the increased inference latency and cost in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) scenarios. Traditional approaches often encode the entire context. Instead, Block-Attention divides retrieved documents into discrete blocks, with each block independently calculating key-value (KV) states except for the final block. In RAG scenarios, by defining each passage as a block, Block-Attention enables us to reuse the KV states of passages that have been seen before, thereby significantly reducing the latency and the computation overhead during inference. The implementation of Block-Attention involves block segmentation, position re-encoding, and fine-tuning the LLM to adapt to the Block-Attention mechanism. Experiments on four RAG benchmarks demonstrate that after block fine-tuning, the Block-Attention model achieves performance comparable to self-attention models (68.4\% vs 67.9\% on Llama3) or even superior performance (62.8\% vs 59.6\% on Mistral). Notably, Block-Attention significantly reduces the time to first token (TTFT) and floating point operations (FLOPs) to a very low level. It only takes 45 ms to output the first token for an input sequence with a total length of 32K. Compared to the self-attention models, the time consumption and corresponding FLOPs are reduced by 98.7\% and 99.8\%, respectively.

### Self-controller: Controlling LLMs with Multi-round Step-by-step   Self-awareness
**Authors**: Xiao Peng, Xufan Geng

**Updated**: 2024-10-01T03:14:12Z

**Summary**: The applications of large language models (LLMs) have been widely spread across all domains. However, the basic abilities such as the controllability of LLMs are still limited. To address this, we propose "Self-controller", a novel agentic framework bringing self-awareness into LLMs' reasoning logic. The core idea of this work is to maintain states based on the LLM's response, letting the LLM become self-aware of current status and think step by step in a multi-round chain-of-thought paradigm. Our experiment on the state of textual length has shown the controllability and effectiveness of the Self-controller. We further implement a binary search algorithm to accelerate the generation process based on the linearity and monotonicity of the textual length state. Another advantage of the Self-controller comes with DeepSeek's Context Caching technology, which significantly saves computational token consumption when a cluster of conversations shares the same prefix of context. Theoretically, we prove that in this scenario the extra time complexity is $O(c \log n)$. Results of the back-of-the-envelope estimation suggest that the token consumption of our method is no more than twice as much as that of the trivial single-round generation. Furthermore, our ablation study on word constraints demonstrates the Self-controller's consistent controllability across all foundation models.

### GEAR: An Efficient KV Cache Compression Recipe for Near-Lossless   Generative Inference of LLM
**Authors**: Hao Kang, Qingru Zhang, Souvik Kundu, Geonhwa Jeong, Zaoxing Liu, Tushar Krishna, Tuo Zhao

**Updated**: 2024-09-30T22:44:58Z

**Summary**: Key-value (KV) caching has become the de-facto to accelerate generation speed for large language models (LLMs) inference. However, the growing cache demand with increasing sequence length has transformed LLM inference to be a memory bound problem, significantly constraining the system throughput. Existing methods rely on dropping unimportant tokens or quantizing all entries uniformly. Such methods, however, often incur high approximation errors to represent the compressed matrices. The autoregressive decoding process further compounds the error of each step, resulting in critical deviation in model generation and deterioration of performance. To tackle this challenge, we propose GEAR, an efficient KV cache compression framework that achieves near-lossless high-ratio compression. GEAR first applies quantization to majority of entries of similar magnitudes to ultra-low precision. It then employs a low rank matrix to approximate the quantization error, and a sparse matrix to remedy individual errors from outlier entries. By adeptly integrating three techniques, GEAR is able to fully exploit their synergistic potentials. Our experiments demonstrate that compared to alternatives, GEAR achieves near-lossless 4-bit KV cache compression with up to 2.38x throughput improvement, while reducing peak-memory size up to 2.29x. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/HaoKang-Timmy/GEAR.

### Cache-Oblivious Representation of B-Tree Structures
**Authors**: Lukáš Ondráček, Ondřej Mička

**Updated**: 2024-09-30T18:23:07Z

**Summary**: We propose a general data structure CORoBTS for storing B-tree-like search trees dynamically in a cache-oblivious way combining the van Emde Boas memory layout with packed memory array.   In the use of the vEB layout mostly search complexity was considered, so far. We show the complexity of depth-first search of a subtree and contiguous memory area and provide better insight into the relationship between positions of vertices in tree and in memory. We describe how to build an arbitrary tree in vEB layout if we can simulate its depth-first search. Similarly, we examine batch updates of packed memory array.   In CORoBTS, the stored search tree has to satisfy that all leaves are at the same depth and vertices have arity between the chosen constants $a$ and $b$. The data structure allows searching with an optimal I/O complexity $\mathcal{O}(\log_B{N})$ and is stored in linear space. It provides operations for inserting and removing a subtree; both have an amortized I/O complexity $\mathcal{O}(S\cdot(\log^2 N)/B + \log_B N\cdot\log\log S + 1)$ and amortized time complexity $\mathcal{O}(S\cdot\log^2 N)$, where $S$ is the size of the subtree and $N$ the size of the whole stored tree. Rebuilding an existing subtree saves the multiplicative $\mathcal{O}(\log^2 N)$ in both complexities if the number of vertices on individual tree levels is not changed; it is paid only for the inserted/removed vertices otherwise.   Modifying cache-oblivious partially persistent array proposed by Davoodi et al. [ESA, pages 296-308. Springer, 2014] to use CORoBTS improves its space complexity from $\mathcal{O}(U^{\log_2 3} + V \log U)$ to $\mathcal{O}(U + V \log U)$, where $U$ is the maximal size of the array and $V$ is the number of versions; the data locality and I/O complexity of both present and persistent reads are kept unchanged; I/O complexity of writes is worsened by a polylogarithmic factor.

### Impact of Device Caching and Handovers on the Performance of 3D UAV   Networks with Blockages
**Authors**: Neetu R R, Gourab Ghatak, Vivek Ashok Bohara

**Updated**: 2024-09-30T15:53:36Z

**Summary**: We investigate an urban network characterized by blockages, where unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) offer ad-hoc coverage to mobile users with distinct service rate requirements. The UAV-BSs are modeled using a two-dimensional (2-D) marked-poisson point process (MPPP), where the marks represent the altitude of each UAV-base station (UAV-BS). Initially, we model the network blockages and analyze the association probabilities of line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) UAV-BSs using stochastic geometry. Subsequently, we derive the bth moment of the conditional success probability (CSP) and employ a meta distribution (MD)-based analytical framework of signal-to-interference noise ratio (SINR) taking into account the blockage distribution in the network. Furthermore, we proposea cache-based handover management strategy that dynamically selects the cell search time and delays the received signal strength (RSS)-based base station (BS) associations. This strategy aims to minimize unnecessary handovers (HOs) experienced by users by leveraging caching capabilities at user equipment (UE). We evaluate the HO rate and average throughput experienced by users ensuring their service rate requirements are met. We demonstrate that LoS associations decrease as the network density increases due to the substantial increase of NLoS UAV-BSs in the network. Additionally, we show that the presence of blockages does not necessarily have a negative impact on network reliability

### Multi-Antenna Coded Caching for Multi-Access Networks with Cyclic   Wrap-Around
**Authors**: Elizabath Peter, K. K. Krishnan Namboodiri, B. Sundar Rajan

**Updated**: 2024-09-30T14:38:41Z

**Summary**: This work explores a multiple transmit antenna setting in a multi-access coded caching (MACC) network where each user accesses more than one cache. A MACC network has $K$ users and $K$ caches, and each user has access to $r < K$ consecutive caches in a cyclic wrap-around manner. There are $L$ antennas at the server, and each cache has a normalized size of $M/N \leq 1$. The cyclic wrap-around MACC network with a single antenna at the server has been a well-investigated topic, and several coded caching schemes and improved lower bounds on the performance are known for the same. However, this MACC network has not yet been studied under multi-antenna settings in the coded caching literature. We study the multi-antenna MACC problem and propose a solution for the same by constructing a pair of arrays called caching and delivery arrays. We present three constructions of caching and delivery arrays for different scenarios and obtain corresponding multi-antenna MACC schemes for the same. Two schemes resulting from the above constructions achieve optimal performance under uncoded placement and one-shot delivery. The optimality is shown by matching the performance of the multi-antenna MACC scheme to that of an optimal multi-antenna scheme for a dedicated cache network having an identical number of users, and each user has a normalized cache size of $rM/N$. Further, as a special case, one of the proposed schemes subsumes an existing optimal MACC scheme for the single-antenna setting.

### Improving Achievability of Cache-Aided Private Variable-Length Coding   with Zero Leakage
**Authors**: Amirreza Zamani, Mikael Skoglund

**Updated**: 2024-09-30T09:33:37Z

**Summary**: A statistical cache-aided compression problem with a privacy constraint is studied, where a server has access to a database of $N$ files, $(Y_1,...,Y_N)$, each of size $F$ bits and is linked through a shared channel to $K$ users, where each has access to a local cache memory of size $MF$ bits. During the placement phase, the server fills the users' caches without prior knowledge of their demands, while the delivery phase takes place after the users send their demands to the server. We assume that each file in database $Y_i$ is arbitrarily correlated with a private attribute $X$, and an adversary is assumed to have access to the shared channel. The users and the server have access to a shared key $W$. The goal is to design the cache contents and the delivered message $\cal C$ such that the average length of $\mathcal{C}$ is minimized, while satisfying: i. The response $\cal C$ does not reveal any information about $X$, i.e., $I(X;\mathcal{C})=0$; ii. User $i$ can decode its demand, $Y_{d_i}$, by using the shared key $W$, $\cal C$, and its local cache $Z_i$. In a previous work, we have proposed a variable-length coding scheme that combines privacy-aware compression with coded caching techniques. In this paper, we propose a new achievability scheme using minimum entropy coupling concept and a greedy entropy-based algorithm. We show that the proposed scheme improves the previous results. Moreover, considering two special cases we improve the obtained bounds using the common information concept.

### The Early Bird Catches the Leak: Unveiling Timing Side Channels in LLM   Serving Systems
**Authors**: Linke Song, Zixuan Pang, Wenhao Wang, Zihao Wang, XiaoFeng Wang, Hongbo Chen, Wei Song, Yier Jin, Dan Meng, Rui Hou

**Updated**: 2024-09-30T06:55:00Z

**Summary**: The wide deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) has given rise to strong demands for optimizing their inference performance. Today's techniques serving this purpose primarily focus on reducing latency and improving throughput through algorithmic and hardware enhancements, while largely overlooking their privacy side effects, particularly in a multi-user environment. In our research, for the first time, we discovered a set of new timing side channels in LLM systems, arising from shared caches and GPU memory allocations, which can be exploited to infer both confidential system prompts and those issued by other users. These vulnerabilities echo security challenges observed in traditional computing systems, highlighting an urgent need to address potential information leakage in LLM serving infrastructures. In this paper, we report novel attack strategies designed to exploit such timing side channels inherent in LLM deployments, specifically targeting the Key-Value (KV) cache and semantic cache widely used to enhance LLM inference performance. Our approach leverages timing measurements and classification models to detect cache hits, allowing an adversary to infer private prompts with high accuracy. We also propose a token-by-token search algorithm to efficiently recover shared prompt prefixes in the caches, showing the feasibility of stealing system prompts and those produced by peer users. Our experimental studies on black-box testing of popular online LLM services demonstrate that such privacy risks are completely realistic, with significant consequences. Our findings underscore the need for robust mitigation to protect LLM systems against such emerging threats.

### FAST: A Dual-tier Few-Shot Learning Paradigm for Whole Slide Image   Classification
**Authors**: Kexue Fu, Xiaoyuan Luo, Linhao Qu, Shuo Wang, Ying Xiong, Ilias Maglogiannis, Longxiang Gao, Manning Wang

**Updated**: 2024-09-29T14:31:52Z

**Summary**: The expensive fine-grained annotation and data scarcity have become the primary obstacles for the widespread adoption of deep learning-based Whole Slide Images (WSI) classification algorithms in clinical practice. Unlike few-shot learning methods in natural images that can leverage the labels of each image, existing few-shot WSI classification methods only utilize a small number of fine-grained labels or weakly supervised slide labels for training in order to avoid expensive fine-grained annotation. They lack sufficient mining of available WSIs, severely limiting WSI classification performance. To address the above issues, we propose a novel and efficient dual-tier few-shot learning paradigm for WSI classification, named FAST. FAST consists of a dual-level annotation strategy and a dual-branch classification framework. Firstly, to avoid expensive fine-grained annotation, we collect a very small number of WSIs at the slide level, and annotate an extremely small number of patches. Then, to fully mining the available WSIs, we use all the patches and available patch labels to build a cache branch, which utilizes the labeled patches to learn the labels of unlabeled patches and through knowledge retrieval for patch classification. In addition to the cache branch, we also construct a prior branch that includes learnable prompt vectors, using the text encoder of visual-language models for patch classification. Finally, we integrate the results from both branches to achieve WSI classification. Extensive experiments on binary and multi-class datasets demonstrate that our proposed method significantly surpasses existing few-shot classification methods and approaches the accuracy of fully supervised methods with only 0.22$\%$ annotation costs. All codes and models will be publicly available on https://github.com/fukexue/FAST.

**Summary**: Purpose: To develop the Ultimate Phantom Dog for Orthovoltage Glioma Treatment (UPDOG), an anatomically-correct phantom which mimics a dog's head, for quality assurance (QA) of kilovoltage (kV) radiotherapy treatments.   Methods: A computed tomography (CT) scan of a canine glioma patient was segmented into bone and soft tissue using 3DSlicer. The segments were converted to stereolithographic (STL) files and smoothed in Fusion360. A slit to accommodate a radiochromic film (RCF) was added at the location of the glioma tumor. UPDOG was 3D printed on a polyjet printer using VeroUltraWhite ($\rho$ = 1.19-1.20 g/cm\textsuperscript{3}) for the bone and Agilus30 ($\rho$ = 1.14-1.15 g/cm\textsuperscript{3}) for the soft tissue. CT scans of UPDOG were acquired on a clinical CT scanner. An LD-V1 RCF was inserted into UPDOG and irradiated with a kV x-ray source from two angles. The delivered dose to the RCF was compared to Monte Carlo (MC) simulations performed in TOPAS.   Results: The bone and soft tissue segments in UPDOG were mimicked the patient anatomy well with tube voltage-dependent CT numbers. The contrast in HU was of 49, 47 and 50 HU for the 80, 100, and 120 kVp scans, respectively, sufficient for anatomy visualization. The irradiations delivered a maximum dose to RCF of 284 mGy which was compared to the results of MC simulations using a depth dose curve and central-axis (CAX) beam profiles. The mean difference in CAX profiles and PDD between RCF and MC results was 15.9\% and 2.3\%, respectively.   Conclusions: We have demonstrated that UPDOG is a useful QA tool for kV canine radiotherapy. UPDOG successfully anatomically mimicked the dog anatomy, with a reduced but sufficient bone contrast. We showed that dose delivered to a canine glioma with kV x-rays can be successfully measured with an RCF positioned at the tumor location.

### RTL2M$μ$PATH: Multi-$μ$PATH Synthesis with Applications to Hardware   Security Verification
**Authors**: Yao Hsiao, Nikos Nikoleris, Artem Khyzha, Dominic P. Mulligan, Gustavo Petri, Christopher W. Fletcher, Caroline Trippel

**Updated**: 2024-09-28T23:01:48Z

**Summary**: The Check tools automate formal memory consistency model and security verification of processors by analyzing abstract models of microarchitectures, called $\mu$SPEC models. Despite the efficacy of this approach, a verification gap between $\mu$SPEC models, which must be manually written, and RTL limits the Check tools' broad adoption. Our prior work, called RTL2$\mu$SPEC, narrows this gap by automatically synthesizing formally verified $\mu$SPEC models from SystemVerilog implementations of simple processors. But, RTL2$\mu$SPEC assumes input designs where an instruction (e.g., a load) cannot exhibit more than one microarchitectural execution path ($\mu$PATH, e.g., a cache hit or miss path) -- its single-execution-path assumption.   In this paper, we first propose an automated approach and tool, called RTL2M$\mu$PATH, that resolves RTL2$\mu$SPEC's single-execution-path assumption. Given a SystemVerilog processor design, instruction encodings, and modest design metadata, RTL2M$\mu$PATH finds a complete set of formally verified $\mu$PATHs for each instruction. Next, we make an important observation: an instruction that can exhibit more than one $\mu$PATH strongly indicates the presence of a microarchitectural side channel in the input design. Based on this observation, we then propose an automated approach and tool, called SynthLC, that extends RTL2M$\mu$PATH with a symbolic information flow analysis to support synthesizing a variety of formally verified leakage contracts from SystemVerilog processor designs. Leakage contracts are foundational to state-of-the-art defenses against hardware side-channel attacks. SynthLC is the first automated methodology for formally verifying hardware adherence to them.

### DOTA: Distributional Test-Time Adaptation of Vision-Language Models
**Authors**: Zongbo Han, Jialong Yang, Junfan Li, Qinghua Hu, Qianli Xu, Mike Zheng Shou, Changqing Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-09-28T15:03:28Z

**Summary**: Vision-language foundation models (e.g., CLIP) have shown remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks. However, deploying these models may be unreliable when significant distribution gaps exist between the training and test data. The training-free test-time dynamic adapter (TDA) is a promising approach to address this issue by storing representative test samples to guide the classification of subsequent ones. However, TDA only naively maintains a limited number of reference samples in the cache, leading to severe test-time catastrophic forgetting when the cache is updated by dropping samples. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective method for DistributiOnal Test-time Adaptation (Dota). Instead of naively memorizing representative test samples, Dota continually estimates the distributions of test samples, allowing the model to continually adapt to the deployment environment. The test-time posterior probabilities are then computed using the estimated distributions based on Bayes' theorem for adaptation purposes. To further enhance the adaptability on the uncertain samples, we introduce a new human-in-the-loop paradigm which identifies uncertain samples, collects human-feedback, and incorporates it into the Dota framework. Extensive experiments validate that Dota enables CLIP to continually learn, resulting in a significant improvement compared to current state-of-the-art methods.

### Analog In-Memory Computing Attention Mechanism for Fast and   Energy-Efficient Large Language Models
**Authors**: Nathan Leroux, Paul-Philipp Manea, Chirag Sudarshan, Jan Finkbeiner, Sebastian Siegel, John Paul Strachan, Emre Neftci

**Updated**: 2024-09-28T11:00:11Z

**Summary**: Transformer neural networks, driven by self-attention mechanisms, are core components of foundational and Large Language Models. In generative transformers, self-attention uses cache memory to store token projections, avoiding recomputation at each time step. However, GPU-stored projections must be loaded into SRAM for each new generation step, causing latency and energy bottlenecks for long sequences. In this work, we propose a fast and energy-efficient hardware implementation of self-attention using analog in-memory computing based on gain cell memories. Volatile gain cell memories can be efficiently written to store new tokens during sequence generation, while performing analog signed weight multiplications to compute the dot-products required for self-attention. We implement Sliding Window Attention, which keeps memory of a finite set of past steps. A charge-to-pulse converter for array readout eliminates the need for analog-to-digital conversion between self-attention stages. Using a co-designed initialization algorithm to adapt pre-trained weights to gain cell non-idealities, we achieve NLP performance comparable to ChatGPT-2 with minimal training iterations, despite hardware constraints. Our end-to-end hardware design includes digital controls, estimating area, latency, and energy. The system reduces attention latency by up to two orders of magnitude and energy consumption by up to five orders compared to GPUs, marking a significant step toward ultra-fast, low-power sequence generation in Large Language Models.

### Token Caching for Diffusion Transformer Acceleration
**Authors**: Jinming Lou, Wenyang Luo, Yufan Liu, Bing Li, Xinmiao Ding, Weiming Hu, Jiajiong Cao, Yuming Li, Chenguang Ma

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T08:05:34Z

**Summary**: Diffusion transformers have gained substantial interest in diffusion generative modeling due to their outstanding performance. However, their high computational cost, arising from the quadratic computational complexity of attention mechanisms and multi-step inference, presents a significant bottleneck. To address this challenge, we propose TokenCache, a novel post-training acceleration method that leverages the token-based multi-block architecture of transformers to reduce redundant computations among tokens across inference steps. TokenCache specifically addresses three critical questions in the context of diffusion transformers: (1) which tokens should be pruned to eliminate redundancy, (2) which blocks should be targeted for efficient pruning, and (3) at which time steps caching should be applied to balance speed and quality. In response to these challenges, TokenCache introduces a Cache Predictor that assigns importance scores to tokens, enabling selective pruning without compromising model performance. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive block selection strategy to focus on blocks with minimal impact on the network's output, along with a Two-Phase Round-Robin (TPRR) scheduling policy to optimize caching intervals throughout the denoising process. Experimental results across various models demonstrate that TokenCache achieves an effective trade-off between generation quality and inference speed for diffusion transformers. Our code will be publicly available.

## Keyword: LLM Inference 
 ### Meta-Chunking: Learning Efficient Text Segmentation via Logical   Perception
**Authors**: Jihao Zhao, Zhiyuan Ji, Pengnian Qi, Simin Niu, Bo Tang, Feiyu Xiong, Zhiyu Li

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T17:59:32Z

**Summary**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), while serving as a viable complement to large language models (LLMs), often overlooks the crucial aspect of text chunking within its pipeline, which impacts the quality of knowledge-intensive tasks. This paper introduces the concept of Meta-Chunking, which refers to a granularity between sentences and paragraphs, consisting of a collection of sentences within a paragraph that have deep linguistic logical connections. To implement Meta-Chunking, we designed two strategies based on LLMs: Margin Sampling Chunking and Perplexity Chunking. The former employs LLMs to perform binary classification on whether consecutive sentences need to be segmented, making decisions based on the probability difference obtained from margin sampling. The latter precisely identifies text chunk boundaries by analyzing the characteristics of perplexity distribution. Additionally, considering the inherent complexity of different texts, we propose a strategy that combines Meta-Chunking with dynamic merging to achieve a balance between fine-grained and coarse-grained text chunking. Experiments conducted on eleven datasets demonstrate that Meta-Chunking can more efficiently improve the performance of single-hop and multi-hop question answering based on RAG. For instance, on the 2WikiMultihopQA dataset, it outperforms similarity chunking by 1.32 while only consuming 45.8% of the time. Our code is available at https://github.com/IAAR-Shanghai/Meta-Chunking.

### JudgeBench: A Benchmark for Evaluating LLM-based Judges
**Authors**: Sijun Tan, Siyuan Zhuang, Kyle Montgomery, William Y. Tang, Alejandro Cuadron, Chenguang Wang, Raluca Ada Popa, Ion Stoica

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T17:58:19Z

**Summary**: LLM-based judges have emerged as a scalable alternative to human evaluation and are increasingly used to assess, compare, and improve models. However, the reliability of LLM-based judges themselves is rarely scrutinized. As LLMs become more advanced, their responses grow more sophisticated, requiring stronger judges to evaluate them. Existing benchmarks primarily focus on a judge's alignment with human preferences, but often fail to account for more challenging tasks where crowdsourced human preference is a poor indicator of factual and logical correctness. To address this, we propose a novel evaluation framework to objectively evaluate LLM-based judges. Based on this framework, we propose JudgeBench, a benchmark for evaluating LLM-based judges on challenging response pairs spanning knowledge, reasoning, math, and coding. JudgeBench leverages a novel pipeline for converting existing difficult datasets into challenging response pairs with preference labels reflecting objective correctness. Our comprehensive evaluation on a collection of prompted judges, fine-tuned judges, multi-agent judges, and reward models shows that JudgeBench poses a significantly greater challenge than previous benchmarks, with many strong models (e.g., GPT-4o) performing just slightly better than random guessing. Overall, JudgeBench offers a reliable platform for assessing increasingly advanced LLM-based judges. Data and code are available at https://github.com/ScalerLab/JudgeBench .

### LLM2Swarm: Robot Swarms that Responsively Reason, Plan, and Collaborate   through LLMs
**Authors**: Volker Strobel, Marco Dorigo, Mario Fritz

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T17:57:02Z

**Summary**: Robot swarms are composed of many simple robots that communicate and collaborate to fulfill complex tasks. Robot controllers usually need to be specified by experts on a case-by-case basis via programming code. This process is time-consuming, prone to errors, and unable to take into account all situations that may be encountered during deployment. On the other hand, recent Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated reasoning and planning capabilities, introduced new ways to interact with and program machines, and incorporate both domain-specific and commonsense knowledge. Hence, we propose to address the aforementioned challenges by integrating LLMs with robot swarms and show the potential in proofs of concept (showcases). For this integration, we explore two approaches. The first approach is 'indirect integration,' where LLMs are used to synthesize and validate the robot controllers. This approach may reduce development time and human error before deployment. Moreover, during deployment, it could be used for on-the-fly creation of new robot behaviors. The second approach is 'direct integration,' where each robot locally executes a separate LLM instance during deployment for robot-robot collaboration and human-swarm interaction. These local LLM instances enable each robot to reason, plan, and collaborate using natural language, as demonstrated in our showcases where the robots are able to detect a variety of anomalies, without prior information about the nature of these anomalies. To enable further research on our mainly conceptual contribution, we release the software and videos for our LLM2Swarm system: https://github.com/Pold87/LLM2Swarm.

### In-Context Learning Enables Robot Action Prediction in LLMs
**Authors**: Yida Yin, Zekai Wang, Yuvan Sharma, Dantong Niu, Trevor Darrell, Roei Herzig

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T17:56:49Z

**Summary**: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success using in-context learning (ICL) in the language domain. However, leveraging the ICL capabilities within LLMs to directly predict robot actions remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce RoboPrompt, a framework that enables off-the-shelf text-only LLMs to directly predict robot actions through ICL without training. Our approach first heuristically identifies keyframes that capture important moments from an episode. Next, we extract end-effector actions from these keyframes as well as the estimated initial object poses, and both are converted into textual descriptions. Finally, we construct a structured template to form ICL demonstrations from these textual descriptions and a task instruction. This enables an LLM to directly predict robot actions at test time. Through extensive experiments and analysis, RoboPrompt shows stronger performance over zero-shot and ICL baselines in simulated and real-world settings.

### Geometry-Aware Generative Autoencoders for Warped Riemannian Metric   Learning and Generative Modeling on Data Manifolds
**Authors**: Xingzhi Sun, Danqi Liao, Kincaid MacDonald, Yanlei Zhang, Chen Liu, Guillaume Huguet, Guy Wolf, Ian Adelstein, Tim G. J. Rudner, Smita Krishnaswamy

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T17:53:26Z

**Summary**: Rapid growth of high-dimensional datasets in fields such as single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial genomics has led to unprecedented opportunities for scientific discovery, but it also presents unique computational and statistical challenges. Traditional methods struggle with geometry-aware data generation, interpolation along meaningful trajectories, and transporting populations via feasible paths. To address these issues, we introduce Geometry-Aware Generative Autoencoder (GAGA), a novel framework that combines extensible manifold learning with generative modeling. GAGA constructs a neural network embedding space that respects the intrinsic geometries discovered by manifold learning and learns a novel warped Riemannian metric on the data space. This warped metric is derived from both the points on the data manifold and negative samples off the manifold, allowing it to characterize a meaningful geometry across the entire latent space. Using this metric, GAGA can uniformly sample points on the manifold, generate points along geodesics, and interpolate between populations across the learned manifold. GAGA shows competitive performance in simulated and real world datasets, including a 30% improvement over the state-of-the-art methods in single-cell population-level trajectory inference.

### BIRD: A Trustworthy Bayesian Inference Framework for Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Yu Feng, Ben Zhou, Weidong Lin, Dan Roth

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T17:45:10Z

**Summary**: Predictive models often need to work with incomplete information in real-world tasks. Consequently, they must provide reliable probability or confidence estimation, especially in large-scale decision making and planning tasks. Current large language models (LLM) are insufficient for such accurate estimations, but they can generate relevant factors that may affect the probabilities, produce coarse-grained probabilities when the information is more complete, and help determine which factors are relevant to specific downstream contexts. In this paper, we make use of these capabilities of LLMs to provide a significantly more accurate probabilistic estimation. We propose BIRD, a novel probabilistic inference framework that aligns a Bayesian network with LLM abductions and then estimates more accurate probabilities in a deduction step. We show BIRD provides reliable probability estimations that are 30\% better than those provided directly by LLM baselines. These estimates can further contribute to better and more trustworthy decision-making.

### Energy and Carbon Considerations of Fine-Tuning BERT
**Authors**: Xiaorong Wang, Clara Na, Emma Strubell, Sorelle Friedler, Sasha Luccioni

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T17:22:54Z

**Summary**: Despite the popularity of the `pre-train then fine-tune' paradigm in the NLP community, existing work quantifying energy costs and associated carbon emissions has largely focused on language model pre-training. Although a single pre-training run draws substantially more energy than fine-tuning, fine-tuning is performed more frequently by many more individual actors, and thus must be accounted for when considering the energy and carbon footprint of NLP. In order to better characterize the role of fine-tuning in the landscape of energy and carbon emissions in NLP, we perform a careful empirical study of the computational costs of fine-tuning across tasks, datasets, hardware infrastructure and measurement modalities. Our experimental results allow us to place fine-tuning energy and carbon costs into perspective with respect to pre-training and inference, and outline recommendations to NLP researchers and practitioners who wish to improve their fine-tuning energy efficiency.

### Preferential Normalizing Flows
**Authors**: Petrus Mikkola, Luigi Acerbi, Arto Klami

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T17:06:41Z

**Summary**: Eliciting a high-dimensional probability distribution from an expert via noisy judgments is notoriously challenging, yet useful for many applications, such as prior elicitation and reward modeling. We introduce a method for eliciting the expert's belief density as a normalizing flow based solely on preferential questions such as comparing or ranking alternatives. This allows eliciting in principle arbitrarily flexible densities, but flow estimation is susceptible to the challenge of collapsing or diverging probability mass that makes it difficult in practice. We tackle this problem by introducing a novel functional prior for the flow, motivated by a decision-theoretic argument, and show empirically that the belief density can be inferred as the function-space maximum a posteriori estimate. We demonstrate our method by eliciting multivariate belief densities of simulated experts, including the prior belief of a general-purpose large language model over a real-world dataset.

### Just Ramp-up: Unleash the Potential of Regression-based Estimator for   A/B Tests under Network Interference
**Authors**: Qianyi Chen, Bo Li

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T16:59:56Z

**Summary**: Recent research in causal inference under network interference has explored various experimental designs and estimation techniques to address this issue. However, existing methods, which typically rely on single experiments, often reach a performance bottleneck and face limitations in handling diverse interference structures. In contrast, we propose leveraging multiple experiments to overcome these limitations. In industry, the use of sequential experiments, often known as the ramp-up process, where traffic to the treatment gradually increases, is common due to operational needs like risk management and cost control. Our approach shifts the focus from operational aspects to the statistical advantages of merging data from multiple experiments. By combining data from sequentially conducted experiments, we aim to estimate the global average treatment effect more effectively. In this paper, we begin by analyzing the bias and variance of the linear regression estimator for GATE under general linear network interference. We demonstrate that bias plays a dominant role in the bias-variance tradeoff and highlight the intrinsic bias reduction achieved by merging data from experiments with strictly different treatment proportions. Herein the improvement introduced by merging two steps of experimental data is essential. In addition, we show that merging more steps of experimental data is unnecessary under general linear interference, while it can become beneficial when nonlinear interference occurs. Furthermore, we look into a more advanced estimator based on graph neural networks. Through extensive simulation studies, we show that the regression-based estimator benefits remarkably from training on merged experiment data, achieving outstanding statistical performance.

### CREAM: Consistency Regularized Self-Rewarding Language Models
**Authors**: Zhaoyang Wang, Weilei He, Zhiyuan Liang, Xuchao Zhang, Chetan Bansal, Ying Wei, Weitong Zhang, Huaxiu Yao

**Updated**: 2024-10-17T02:47:35Z

**Summary**: Recent self-rewarding large language models (LLM) have successfully applied LLM-as-a-Judge to iteratively improve the alignment performance without the need of human annotations for preference data. These methods commonly utilize the same LLM to act as both the policy model (which generates responses) and the reward model (which scores and ranks those responses). The ranked responses are then used as preference pairs to train the LLM via direct alignment technologies (e.g. DPO). However, it is noteworthy that throughout this process, there is no guarantee of accuracy in the rewarding and ranking, which is critical for ensuring accurate rewards and high-quality preference data. Empirical results from relatively small LLMs (e.g., 7B parameters) also indicate that improvements from self-rewarding may diminish after several iterations in certain situations, which we hypothesize is due to accumulated bias in the reward system. This bias can lead to unreliable preference data for training the LLM. To address this issue, we first formulate and analyze the generalized iterative preference fine-tuning framework for self-rewarding language model. We then introduce the regularization to this generalized framework to mitigate the overconfident preference labeling in the self-rewarding process. Based on this theoretical insight, we propose a Consistency Regularized sElf-rewarding lAnguage Model (CREAM) that leverages the rewarding consistency across different iterations to regularize the self-rewarding training, helping the model to learn from more reliable preference data. With this explicit regularization, our empirical results demonstrate the superiority of CREAM in improving both reward consistency and alignment performance. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/Raibows/CREAM.

### Counterfactual Generative Modeling with Variational Causal Inference
**Authors**: Yulun Wu, Louie McConnell, Claudia Iriondo

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T16:44:12Z

**Summary**: Estimating an individual's potential outcomes under counterfactual treatments is a challenging task for traditional causal inference and supervised learning approaches when the outcome is high-dimensional (e.g. gene expressions, facial images) and covariates are relatively limited. In this case, to predict one's outcomes under counterfactual treatments, it is crucial to leverage individual information contained in its high-dimensional observed outcome in addition to the covariates. Prior works using variational inference in counterfactual generative modeling have been focusing on neural adaptations and model variants within the conditional variational autoencoder formulation, which we argue is fundamentally ill-suited to the notion of counterfactual in causal inference. In this work, we present a novel variational Bayesian causal inference framework and its theoretical backings to properly handle counterfactual generative modeling tasks, through which we are able to conduct counterfactual supervision end-to-end during training without any counterfactual samples, and encourage latent disentanglement that aids the correct identification of causal effect in counterfactual generations. In experiments, we demonstrate the advantage of our framework compared to state-of-the-art models in counterfactual generative modeling on multiple benchmarks.

### SplitLLM: Collaborative Inference of LLMs for Model Placement and   Throughput Optimization
**Authors**: Akrit Mudvari, Yuang Jiang, Leandros Tassiulas

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T16:31:37Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have been a disruptive innovation in recent years, and they play a crucial role in our daily lives due to their ability to understand and generate human-like text. Their capabilities include natural language understanding, information retrieval and search, translation, chatbots, virtual assistance, and many more. However, it is well known that LLMs are massive in terms of the number of parameters. Additionally, the self-attention mechanism in the underlying architecture of LLMs, Transformers, has quadratic complexity in terms of both computation and memory with respect to the input sequence length. For these reasons, LLM inference is resource-intensive, and thus, the throughput of LLM inference is limited, especially for the longer sequences. In this report, we design a collaborative inference architecture between a server and its clients to alleviate the throughput limit. In this design, we consider the available resources on both sides, i.e., the computation and communication costs. We develop a dynamic programming-based algorithm to optimally allocate computation between the server and the client device to increase the server throughput, while not violating the service level agreement (SLA). We show in the experiments that we are able to efficiently distribute the workload allowing for roughly 1/3 reduction in the server workload, while achieving 19 percent improvement over a greedy method. As a result, we are able to demonstrate that, in an environment with different types of LLM inference requests, the throughput of the server is improved.

### FusionLLM: A Decentralized LLM Training System on Geo-distributed GPUs   with Adaptive Compression
**Authors**: Zhenheng Tang, Xueze Kang, Yiming Yin, Xinglin Pan, Yuxin Wang, Xin He, Qiang Wang, Rongfei Zeng, Kaiyong Zhao, Shaohuai Shi, Amelie Chi Zhou, Bo Li, Bingsheng He, Xiaowen Chu

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T16:13:19Z

**Summary**: To alleviate hardware scarcity in training large deep neural networks (DNNs), particularly large language models (LLMs), we present FusionLLM, a decentralized training system designed and implemented for training DNNs using geo-distributed GPUs across different computing clusters or individual devices. Decentralized training faces significant challenges regarding system design and efficiency, including: 1) the need for remote automatic differentiation (RAD), 2) support for flexible model definitions and heterogeneous software, 3) heterogeneous hardware leading to low resource utilization or the straggler problem, and 4) slow network communication. To address these challenges, in the system design, we represent the model as a directed acyclic graph of operators (OP-DAG). Each node in the DAG represents the operator in the DNNs, while the edge represents the data dependency between operators. Based on this design, 1) users are allowed to customize any DNN without caring low-level operator implementation; 2) we enable the task scheduling with the more fine-grained sub-tasks, offering more optimization space; 3) a DAG runtime executor can implement RAD withour requiring the consistent low-level ML framework versions.   To enhance system efficiency, we implement a workload estimator and design an OP-Fence scheduler to cluster devices with similar bandwidths together and partition the DAG to increase throughput. Additionally, we propose an AdaTopK compressor to adaptively compress intermediate activations and gradients at the slowest communication links. To evaluate the convergence and efficiency of our system and algorithms, we train ResNet-101 and GPT-2 on three real-world testbeds using 48 GPUs connected with 8 Mbps~10 Gbps networks. Experimental results demonstrate that our system and method can achieve 1.45 - 9.39x speedup compared to baseline methods while ensuring convergence.

**Summary**: JWST has discovered a large population of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) at high redshift. Many of these newly discovered AGN have broad permitted lines (typically H$\alpha$), but are extremely weak in the X-rays. Here we present the NIRSpec spectrum of the most extreme of these objects, GN-28074, an AGN at $z=2.26$ with prominent Balmer, Paschen and \HeI broad lines, and with the highest limit on the bolometric to X-ray luminosity ratio among all spectroscopically confirmed AGN in GOODS. This source is also characterized by a mid-IR excess, most likely associated with the AGN torus' hot dust. The high bolometric luminosity and moderate redshift of this AGN allow us to explore its properties more in depth relative to other JWST-discovered AGN. The NIRSpec spectrum reveals prominent, slightly blueshifted absorption of H$\alpha$, H$\beta$ and \HeI$\lambda$10830. The Balmer absorption lines require gas with densities of $n_{\rm H}> 10^8~{\rm cm}^{-3}$, inconsistent with an ISM origin, but fully consistent with clouds in the Broad Line Region (BLR). This finding suggests that at least part of the X-ray weakness is due to high (Compton thick) X-ray absorption by (dust-free) clouds in the BLR, or in its outer, slowly outflowing regions. GN-28074 is also extremely radio-weak. The radio weakness can also be explained in terms of absorption, as the inferred density of the clouds responsible for H$\alpha$ absorption makes them optically thick to radio emission through free-free absorption. Alternatively, in this and other JWST-discovered AGN, the nuclear magnetic field may have not developed properly yet, resulting both in intrinsically weak radio emission and also lack of hot corona, hence intrinsic X-ray weakness. Finally, we show that recently proposed scenarios, invoking hyper-dense and ultra-metal-poor outflows or Raman scattering to explain the broad H$\alpha$, are completely ruled out.

### Embedding an Ethical Mind: Aligning Text-to-Image Synthesis via   Lightweight Value Optimization
**Authors**: Xingqi Wang, Xiaoyuan Yi, Xing Xie, Jia Jia

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T16:03:42Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in diffusion models trained on large-scale data have enabled the generation of indistinguishable human-level images, yet they often produce harmful content misaligned with human values, e.g., social bias, and offensive content. Despite extensive research on Large Language Models (LLMs), the challenge of Text-to-Image (T2I) model alignment remains largely unexplored. Addressing this problem, we propose LiVO (Lightweight Value Optimization), a novel lightweight method for aligning T2I models with human values. LiVO only optimizes a plug-and-play value encoder to integrate a specified value principle with the input prompt, allowing the control of generated images over both semantics and values. Specifically, we design a diffusion model-tailored preference optimization loss, which theoretically approximates the Bradley-Terry model used in LLM alignment but provides a more flexible trade-off between image quality and value conformity. To optimize the value encoder, we also develop a framework to automatically construct a text-image preference dataset of 86k (prompt, aligned image, violating image, value principle) samples. Without updating most model parameters and through adaptive value selection from the input prompt, LiVO significantly reduces harmful outputs and achieves faster convergence, surpassing several strong baselines and taking an initial step towards ethically aligned T2I models.

### Unsupervised End-to-End Task-Oriented Dialogue with LLMs: The Power of   the Noisy Channel
**Authors**: Brendan King, Jeffrey Flanigan

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T16:01:59Z

**Summary**: Training task-oriented dialogue systems typically requires turn-level annotations for interacting with their APIs: e.g. a dialogue state and the system actions taken at each step. These annotations can be costly to produce, error-prone, and require both domain and annotation expertise. With advances in LLMs, we hypothesize that unlabeled data and a schema definition are sufficient for building a working task-oriented dialogue system, completely unsupervised. We consider a novel unsupervised setting of only (1) a well-defined API schema (2) a set of unlabeled dialogues between a user and agent. We propose an innovative approach using expectation-maximization (EM) that infers turn-level annotations as latent variables using a noisy channel model to build an end-to-end dialogue agent. Evaluating our approach on the MultiWOZ benchmark, our method more than doubles the dialogue success rate of a strong GPT-3.5 baseline.

### Your Clean Graphene is Still Not Clean
**Authors**: Ondrej Dyck, Aisha Okmi, Kai Xiao, Sidong Lei, Andrew R. Lupini, Stephen Jesse

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T15:59:27Z

**Summary**: Efforts aimed at scaling fabrication processes to the level of single atoms, dubbed atom-by-atom fabrication or atomic fabrication, invariably encounter the obstacle of atomic scale cleanliness. When considering atomic fabrication, cleanliness of the base material and purity of the source reservoir from which atomic structures will be built are invariable constraints imposed by laws of physics and chemistry. As obvious as such statements may be, and regardless of the inevitable consequences for successful atomic fabrication, there is a poignant lack of understanding of the "dirt" (contamination/impurities). Here, we examine hydrocarbon contamination on graphene. Graphene has formed the base substrate for many e-beam-based atomic fabrication studies and many strategies for cleaning graphene have been presented in the literature. One popular method is heating to high temperatures (>500 {\deg}C). It is usually inferred that volatile hydrocarbons evaporate into the microscope vacuum system leaving behind pristine graphene. Here, we show through direct image intensity analysis that what appears to be clean graphene can be coated with a thin layer of dynamically diffusing hydrocarbons. This result holds significant implications for approaches to e-beam based atomic fabrication, updates the conceptual model of e-beam induced hydrocarbon deposition, and may extend to hot surfaces generally.

### Automatic Mapping of Anatomical Landmarks from Free-Text Using Large   Language Models: Insights from Llama-2
**Authors**: Mohamad Abdi, Gerardo Hemosillo Valadez, Halid Ziya Yerebakan

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T15:48:28Z

**Summary**: Anatomical landmarks are vital in medical imaging for navigation and anomaly detection. Modern large language models (LLMs), like Llama-2, offer promise for automating the mapping of these landmarks in free-text radiology reports to corresponding positions in image data. Recent studies propose LLMs may develop coherent representations of generative processes. Motivated by these insights, we investigated whether LLMs accurately represent the spatial positions of anatomical landmarks. Through experiments with Llama-2 models, we found that they can linearly represent anatomical landmarks in space with considerable robustness to different prompts. These results underscore the potential of LLMs to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of medical imaging workflows.

### ToBlend: Token-Level Blending With an Ensemble of LLMs to Attack   AI-Generated Text Detection
**Authors**: Fan Huang, Haewoon Kwak, Jisun An

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T15:40:51Z

**Summary**: The robustness of AI-content detection models against sophisticated adversarial strategies, such as paraphrasing or word switching, is a rising concern in natural language generation (NLG) applications. This study proposes ToBlend, a novel token-level ensemble text generation method to challenge the robustness of current AI-content detection approaches by utilizing multiple sets of candidate generative large language models (LLMs). By randomly sampling token(s) from candidate LLMs sets, we find ToBlend significantly drops the performance of most mainstream AI-content detection methods. We evaluate the text quality produced under different ToBlend settings based on annotations from experienced human experts. We proposed a fine-tuned Llama3.1 model to distinguish the ToBlend generated text more accurately. Our findings underscore our proposed text generation approach's great potential in deceiving and improving detection models. Our datasets, codes, and annotations are open-sourced.

### Cross-Modal Safety Mechanism Transfer in Large Vision-Language Models
**Authors**: Shicheng Xu, Liang Pang, Yunchang Zhu, Huawei Shen, Xueqi Cheng

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T15:20:08Z

**Summary**: Vision-language alignment in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) successfully enables LLMs to understand visual input. However, we find that existing vision-language alignment methods fail to transfer the existing safety mechanism for text in LLMs to vision, which leads to vulnerabilities in toxic image. To explore the cause of this problem, we give the insightful explanation of where and how the safety mechanism of LVLMs operates and conduct comparative analysis between text and vision. We find that the hidden states at the specific transformer layers play a crucial role in the successful activation of safety mechanism, while the vision-language alignment at hidden states level in current methods is insufficient. This results in a semantic shift for input images compared to text in hidden states, therefore misleads the safety mechanism. To address this, we propose a novel Text-Guided vision-language Alignment method (TGA) for LVLMs. TGA retrieves the texts related to input vision and uses them to guide the projection of vision into the hidden states space in LLMs. Experiments show that TGA not only successfully transfers the safety mechanism for text in basic LLMs to vision in vision-language alignment for LVLMs without any safety fine-tuning on the visual modality but also maintains the general performance on various vision tasks (Safe and Good).

### Explanation-Preserving Augmentation for Semi-Supervised Graph   Representation Learning
**Authors**: Zhuomin Chen, Jingchao Ni, Hojat Allah Salehi, Xu Zheng, Esteban Schafir, Farhad Shirani, Dongsheng Luo

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T15:18:03Z

**Summary**: Graph representation learning (GRL), enhanced by graph augmentation methods, has emerged as an effective technique achieving performance improvements in wide tasks such as node classification and graph classification. In self-supervised GRL, paired graph augmentations are generated from each graph. Its objective is to infer similar representations for augmentations of the same graph, but maximally distinguishable representations for augmentations of different graphs. Analogous to image and language domains, the desiderata of an ideal augmentation method include both (1) semantics-preservation; and (2) data-perturbation; i.e., an augmented graph should preserve the semantics of its original graph while carrying sufficient variance. However, most existing (un-)/self-supervised GRL methods focus on data perturbation but largely neglect semantics preservation. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose a novel method, Explanation-Preserving Augmentation (EPA), that leverages graph explanation techniques for generating augmented graphs that can bridge the gap between semantics-preservation and data-perturbation. EPA first uses a small number of labels to train a graph explainer to infer the sub-structures (explanations) that are most relevant to a graph's semantics. These explanations are then used to generate semantics-preserving augmentations for self-supervised GRL, namely EPA-GRL. We demonstrate theoretically, using an analytical example, and through extensive experiments on a variety of benchmark datasets that EPA-GRL outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) GRL methods, which are built upon semantics-agnostic data augmentations.

**Authors**: Mete Ismayilzada, Defne Circi, Jonne Sälevä, Hale Sirin, Abdullatif Köksal, Bhuwan Dhingra, Antoine Bosselut, Lonneke van der Plas, Duygu Ataman

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T15:17:20Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant progress in various natural language generation and understanding tasks. However, their linguistic generalization capabilities remain questionable, raising doubts about whether these models learn language similarly to humans. While humans exhibit compositional generalization and linguistic creativity in language use, the extent to which LLMs replicate these abilities, particularly in morphology, is under-explored. In this work, we systematically investigate the morphological generalization abilities of LLMs through the lens of compositionality. We define morphemes as compositional primitives and design a novel suite of generative and discriminative tasks to assess morphological productivity and systematicity. Focusing on agglutinative languages such as Turkish and Finnish, we evaluate several state-of-the-art instruction-finetuned multilingual models, including GPT-4 and Gemini. Our analysis shows that LLMs struggle with morphological compositional generalization particularly when applied to novel word roots, with performance declining sharply as morphological complexity increases. While models can identify individual morphological combinations better than chance, their performance lacks systematicity, leading to significant accuracy gaps compared to humans.

### CELL your Model: Contrastive Explanations for Large Language Models
**Authors**: Ronny Luss, Erik Miehling, Amit Dhurandhar

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T15:15:44Z

**Summary**: The advent of black-box deep neural network classification models has sparked the need to explain their decisions. However, in the case of generative AI, such as large language models (LLMs), there is no class prediction to explain. Rather, one can ask why an LLM output a particular response to a given prompt. In this paper, we answer this question by proposing, to the best of our knowledge, the first contrastive explanation methods requiring simply black-box/query access. Our explanations suggest that an LLM outputs a reply to a given prompt because if the prompt was slightly modified, the LLM would have given a different response that is either less preferable or contradicts the original response. The key insight is that contrastive explanations simply require a scoring function that has meaning to the user and not necessarily a specific real valued quantity (viz. class label). We offer two algorithms for finding contrastive explanations: i) A myopic algorithm, which although effective in creating contrasts, requires many model calls and ii) A budgeted algorithm, our main algorithmic contribution, which intelligently creates contrasts adhering to a query budget, necessary for longer contexts. We show the efficacy of these methods on diverse natural language tasks such as open-text generation, automated red teaming, and explaining conversational degradation.

### Evolving privacy: drift parameter estimation for discretely observed   i.i.d. diffusion processes under LDP
**Authors**: Chiara Amorino, Arnaud Gloter, Hélène Halconruy

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T15:14:07Z

**Summary**: The problem of estimating a parameter in the drift coefficient is addressed for $N$ discretely observed independent and identically distributed stochastic differential equations (SDEs). This is done considering additional constraints, wherein only public data can be published and used for inference. The concept of local differential privacy (LDP) is formally introduced for a system of stochastic differential equations. The objective is to estimate the drift parameter by proposing a contrast function based on a pseudo-likelihood approach. A suitably scaled Laplace noise is incorporated to meet the privacy requirements. Our key findings encompass the derivation of explicit conditions tied to the privacy level. Under these conditions, we establish the consistency and asymptotic normality of the associated estimator. Notably, the convergence rate is intricately linked to the privacy level, and is some situations may be completely different from the case where privacy constraints are ignored. Our results hold true as the discretization step approaches zero and the number of processes $N$ tends to infinity.

### Light-Weight Fault Tolerant Attention for Large Language Model Training
**Authors**: Yuhang Liang, Xinyi Li, Jie Ren, Ang Li, Bo Fang, Jieyang Chen

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T15:10:58Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in various natural language processing tasks. However, the training of these models is computationally intensive and susceptible to faults, particularly in the attention mechanism, which is a critical component of transformer-based LLMs. In this paper, we investigate the impact of faults on LLM training, focusing on INF, NaN, and near-INF values in the computation results with systematic fault injection experiments. We observe the propagation patterns of these errors, which can trigger non-trainable states in the model and disrupt training, forcing the procedure to load from checkpoints. To mitigate the impact of these faults, we propose ATTNChecker, the first Algorithm-Based Fault Tolerance (ABFT) technique tailored for the attention mechanism in LLMs. ATTNChecker is designed based on fault propagation patterns of LLM and incorporates performance optimization to adapt to both system reliability and model vulnerability while providing lightweight protection for fast LLM training. Evaluations on four LLMs show that ATTNChecker on average incurs on average 7% overhead on training while detecting and correcting all extreme errors. Compared with the state-of-the-art checkpoint/restore approach, ATTNChecker reduces recovery overhead by up to 49x.

### DOCE: Finding the Sweet Spot for Execution-Based Code Generation
**Authors**: Haau-Sing Li, Patrick Fernandes, Iryna Gurevych, André F. T. Martins

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T15:07:41Z

**Summary**: Recently, a diverse set of decoding and reranking procedures have been shown effective for LLM-based code generation. However, a comprehensive framework that links and experimentally compares these methods is missing. We address this by proposing Decoding Objectives for Code Execution, a comprehensive framework that includes candidate generation, $n$-best reranking, minimum Bayes risk (MBR) decoding, and self-debugging as the core components. We then study the contributions of these components through execution-based evaluation metrics. Our findings highlight the importance of execution-based methods and the difference gap between execution-based and execution-free methods. Furthermore, we assess the impact of filtering based on trial unit tests, a simple and effective strategy that has been often overlooked in prior works. We also propose self-debugging on multiple candidates, obtaining state-of-the-art performance on reranking for code generation. We expect our framework to provide a solid guideline for future research on code generation.

### CECILIA: Comprehensive Secure Machine Learning Framework
**Authors**: Ali Burak Ünal, Nico Pfeifer, Mete Akgün

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T15:02:27Z

**Summary**: Since ML algorithms have proven their success in many different applications, there is also a big interest in privacy preserving (PP) ML methods for building models on sensitive data. Moreover, the increase in the number of data sources and the high computational power required by those algorithms force individuals to outsource the training and/or the inference of a ML model to the clouds providing such services. To address this, we propose a secure 3-party computation framework, CECILIA, offering PP building blocks to enable complex operations privately. In addition to the adapted and common operations like addition and multiplication, it offers multiplexer, most significant bit and modulus conversion. The first two are novel in terms of methodology and the last one is novel in terms of both functionality and methodology. CECILIA also has two complex novel methods, which are the exact exponential of a public base raised to the power of a secret value and the inverse square root of a secret Gram matrix. We use CECILIA to realize the private inference on pre-trained RKNs, which require more complex operations than most other DNNs, on the structural classification of proteins as the first study ever accomplishing the PP inference on RKNs. In addition to the successful private computation of basic building blocks, the results demonstrate that we perform the exact and fully private exponential computation, which is done by approximation in the literature so far. Moreover, they also show that we compute the exact inverse square root of a secret Gram matrix up to a certain privacy level, which has not been addressed in the literature at all. We also analyze the scalability of CECILIA to various settings on a synthetic dataset. The framework shows a great promise to make other ML algorithms as well as further computations privately computable by the building blocks of the framework.

### Cascade learning in multi-task encoder-decoder networks for concurrent   bone segmentation and glenohumeral joint assessment in shoulder CT scans
**Authors**: Luca Marsilio, Davide Marzorati, Matteo Rossi, Andrea Moglia, Luca Mainardi, Alfonso Manzotti, Pietro Cerveri

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T15:00:31Z

**Summary**: Osteoarthritis is a degenerative condition affecting bones and cartilage, often leading to osteophyte formation, bone density loss, and joint space narrowing. Treatment options to restore normal joint function vary depending on the severity of the condition. This work introduces an innovative deep-learning framework processing shoulder CT scans. It features the semantic segmentation of the proximal humerus and scapula, the 3D reconstruction of bone surfaces, the identification of the glenohumeral (GH) joint region, and the staging of three common osteoarthritic-related pathologies: osteophyte formation (OS), GH space reduction (JS), and humeroscapular alignment (HSA). The pipeline comprises two cascaded CNN architectures: 3D CEL-UNet for segmentation and 3D Arthro-Net for threefold classification. A retrospective dataset of 571 CT scans featuring patients with various degrees of GH osteoarthritic-related pathologies was used to train, validate, and test the pipeline. Root mean squared error and Hausdorff distance median values for 3D reconstruction were 0.22mm and 1.48mm for the humerus and 0.24mm and 1.48mm for the scapula, outperforming state-of-the-art architectures and making it potentially suitable for a PSI-based shoulder arthroplasty preoperative plan context. The classification accuracy for OS, JS, and HSA consistently reached around 90% across all three categories. The computational time for the inference pipeline was less than 15s, showcasing the framework's efficiency and compatibility with orthopedic radiology practice. The outcomes represent a promising advancement toward the medical translation of artificial intelligence tools. This progress aims to streamline the preoperative planning pipeline delivering high-quality bone surfaces and supporting surgeons in selecting the most suitable surgical approach according to the unique patient joint conditions.

### Reward-Robust RLHF in LLMs
**Authors**: Yuzi Yan, Xingzhou Lou, Jialian Li, Yiping Zhang, Jian Xie, Chao Yu, Yu Wang, Dong Yan, Yuan Shen

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T14:56:15Z

**Summary**: As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to progress toward more advanced forms of intelligence, Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is increasingly seen as a key pathway toward achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). However, the reliance on reward-model-based (RM-based) alignment methods introduces significant challenges due to the inherent instability and imperfections of Reward Models (RMs), which can lead to critical issues such as reward hacking and misalignment with human intentions. In this paper, we introduce a reward-robust RLHF framework aimed at addressing these fundamental challenges, paving the way for more reliable and resilient learning in LLMs. Our approach introduces a novel optimization objective that carefully balances performance and robustness by incorporating Bayesian Reward Model Ensembles (BRME) to model the uncertainty set of reward functions. This allows the framework to integrate both nominal performance and minimum reward signals, ensuring more stable learning even with imperfect RMs. Empirical results demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms baselines across diverse benchmarks, showing improved accuracy and long-term stability. We also provide a theoretical analysis, demonstrating that reward-robust RLHF approaches the stability of constant reward settings, which proves to be acceptable even in a stochastic-case analysis. Together, these contributions highlight the framework potential to enhance both the performance and stability of LLM alignment.

### Regularized Rényi divergence minimization through Bregman proximal   gradient algorithms
**Authors**: Thomas Guilmeau, Emilie Chouzenoux, Víctor Elvira

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T14:53:51Z

**Summary**: We study the variational inference problem of minimizing a regularized R\'enyi divergence over an exponential family. We propose to solve this problem with a Bregman proximal gradient algorithm. We propose a sampling-based algorithm to cover the black-box setting, corresponding to a stochastic Bregman proximal gradient algorithm with biased gradient estimator. We show that the resulting algorithms can be seen as relaxed moment-matching algorithms with an additional proximal step. Using Bregman updates instead of Euclidean ones allows us to exploit the geometry of our approximate model. We prove strong convergence guarantees for both our deterministic and stochastic algorithms using this viewpoint, including monotonic decrease of the objective, convergence to a stationary point or to the minimizer, and geometric convergence rates. These new theoretical insights lead to a versatile, robust, and competitive method, as illustrated by numerical experiments.

### Explainable Moral Values: a neuro-symbolic approach to value   classification
**Authors**: Nicolas Lazzari, Stefano De Giorgis, Aldo Gangemi, Valentina Presutti

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T14:53:13Z

**Summary**: This work explores the integration of ontology-based reasoning and Machine Learning techniques for explainable value classification. By relying on an ontological formalization of moral values as in the Moral Foundations Theory, relying on the DnS Ontology Design Pattern, the \textit{sandra} neuro-symbolic reasoner is used to infer values (fomalized as descriptions) that are \emph{satisfied by} a certain sentence. Sentences, alongside their structured representation, are automatically generated using an open-source Large Language Model. The inferred descriptions are used to automatically detect the value associated with a sentence. We show that only relying on the reasoner's inference results in explainable classification comparable to other more complex approaches. We show that combining the reasoner's inferences with distributional semantics methods largely outperforms all the baselines, including complex models based on neural network architectures. Finally, we build a visualization tool to explore the potential of theory-based values classification, which is publicly available at http://xmv.geomeaning.com/.

### Robust ASR Error Correction with Conservative Data Filtering
**Authors**: Takuma Udagawa, Masayuki Suzuki, Masayasu Muraoka, Gakuto Kurata

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T14:52:16Z

**Summary**: Error correction (EC) based on large language models is an emerging technology to enhance the performance of automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. Generally, training data for EC are collected by automatically pairing a large set of ASR hypotheses (as sources) and their gold references (as targets). However, the quality of such pairs is not guaranteed, and we observed various types of noise which can make the EC models brittle, e.g. inducing overcorrection in out-of-domain (OOD) settings. In this work, we propose two fundamental criteria that EC training data should satisfy: namely, EC targets should (1) improve linguistic acceptability over sources and (2) be inferable from the available context (e.g. source phonemes). Through these criteria, we identify low-quality EC pairs and train the models not to make any correction in such cases, the process we refer to as conservative data filtering. In our experiments, we focus on Japanese ASR using a strong Conformer-CTC as the baseline and finetune Japanese LLMs for EC. Through our evaluation on a suite of 21 internal benchmarks, we demonstrate that our approach can significantly reduce overcorrection and improve both the accuracy and quality of ASR results in the challenging OOD settings.

### Testing general relativity via direct measurement of black hole kicks
**Authors**: Parthapratim Mahapatra, Marc Favata, K. G. Arun

**Summary**: Asymmetric emission of gravitational waves during a compact binary coalescence results in the loss of linear momentum and a corresponding "kick" or recoil on the binary's center of mass. This leads to a direction-dependent Doppler shift of the ringdown gravitational waveform. We quantify the measurability of the kick imparted to the remnant black hole in a binary black hole merger. Future ground- and space-based gravitational-wave detectors will measure this effect to within $\sim 2\%$ to $\sim 30\%$ for a subset of their expected observed sources. Certain binary configurations in the LISA band may allow a sub-percent-level measurement of this effect. This direct measurement of black hole kicks can also facilitate a novel test of general relativity based on linear momentum balance. We formulate this kick consistency test via measurement of a null variable that quantifies the difference between the inferred kick (using numerical relativity) and that observed via the Doppler-shifted ringdown signal. This null variable can be constrained (at 90\% confidence) to $\sim 10\%$ to $30\%$ with Cosmic Explorer and to $\sim 3\%$ to $12\%$ with LISA.

### Details Make a Difference: Object State-Sensitive Neurorobotic Task   Planning
**Authors**: Xiaowen Sun, Xufeng Zhao, Jae Hee Lee, Wenhao Lu, Matthias Kerzel, Stefan Wermter

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T14:48:38Z

**Summary**: The state of an object reflects its current status or condition and is important for a robot's task planning and manipulation. However, detecting an object's state and generating a state-sensitive plan for robots is challenging. Recently, pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in generating plans. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is hardly any investigation on whether LLMs or VLMs can also generate object state-sensitive plans. To study this, we introduce an Object State-Sensitive Agent (OSSA), a task-planning agent empowered by pre-trained neural networks. We propose two methods for OSSA: (i) a modular model consisting of a pre-trained vision processing module (dense captioning model, DCM) and a natural language processing model (LLM), and (ii) a monolithic model consisting only of a VLM. To quantitatively evaluate the performances of the two methods, we use tabletop scenarios where the task is to clear the table. We contribute a multimodal benchmark dataset that takes object states into consideration. Our results show that both methods can be used for object state-sensitive tasks, but the monolithic approach outperforms the modular approach. The code for OSSA is available at https://github.com/Xiao-wen-Sun/OSSA

### Weak-to-Strong Generalization beyond Accuracy: a Pilot Study in Safety,   Toxicity, and Legal Reasoning
**Authors**: Ruimeng Ye, Yang Xiao, Bo Hui

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T14:40:32Z

**Summary**: As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, ensuring their alignment with human values becomes increasingly critical. Traditional alignment methods heavily rely on human feedback to fine-tune models. With the emergence of superhuman models whose outputs may surpass human understanding, evaluating and aligning these models using human judgments poses significant challenges. To address the challenges, recent works use weak supervisors to elicit knowledge from much stronger models. However, there are important disanalogies between the empirical setup in the existing works and the genuine goal of alignment. We remark that existing works investigate the phenomenon of weak-to-strong generation in analogous setup (i.e., binary classification), rather than practical alignment-relevant tasks (e.g., safety). In this paper, we bridge this gap by extending weak-to-strong generation to the context of practical alignment. We empirically demonstrate the widespread phenomenon of weak-to-strong generation in three complicated alignment tasks: safety, toxicity, and legal reasoning}. Furthermore, we explore efficient strategies for improving alignment performance to enhance the quality of model outcomes. Lastly, we summarize and analyze the challenges and potential solutions in regard to specific alignment tasks, which we hope to catalyze the research progress on the topic of weak-to-strong generalization. Our code is released at https://github.com/yeruimeng/WTS.git.

### Can Graph Descriptive Order Affect Solving Graph Problems with LLMs?
**Authors**: Yuyao Ge, Shenghua Liu, Baolong Bi, Yiwei Wang, Lingrui Mei, Wenjie Feng, Lizhe Chen, Xueqi Cheng

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T14:34:57Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant success in reasoning tasks, including mathematical reasoning and logical deduction. Among these reasoning tasks, graph problems stand out due to their complexity and unique structural characteristics, attracting considerable attention from researchers. Previous studies have explored LLMs' graph reasoning abilities through various techniques, such as different encoding methods for graph structures and the use of carefully designed prompts. However, a critical factor has been mostly overlooked: the prompt sequential order in which graph descriptions are presented to the models. In this study, we present the first comprehensive analysis of how the order of graph descriptions impacts LLM performance. Specifically, we comprehensively evaluate four graph description orders across six graph problems using six mainstream LLMs. The results reveal that: (1) ordered graph descriptions significantly improve LLMs' comprehension of graph structures; (2) the robustness of LLMs to graph description order varies across different tasks; and (3) the impact of graph order on performance is closely related to the inherent characteristics of tasks. This study provides a critical advancement in the application of LLMs for solving graph-related problems, paving the way for future research to optimize model performance through strategic graph description ordering.

### Effective galactic dark matter: first order general relativistic   corrections
**Authors**: Federico Re, Marco Galoppo

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T14:30:56Z

**Summary**: Stationary, axisymmetric, dust sourced solutions of Einstein's equations have been proposed as fully general relativistic models for disc galaxies. These models introduce a novel physical element, i.e., a non-negligible dragging vortex emerging from a full consideration of the essential self-interaction of matter and geometry in general relativity, which might demand a profound recalibration of the inferred amount of dark matter in disc galaxies. Within this framework, we identify the correct observables for redshift-inferred rotation curves of distant galaxies, correcting previously overlooked mistakes in the literature. We find that the presence of the dragging vortex introduces non-negligible corrective terms for the matter density required to maintain a stable physical system. We present the first estimate of the dragging speed which is required to explain a non-negligible fraction of dark matter in disc galaxies. In particular, we show that a sub-relativistic dragging velocity of tens of kilometers per second in the neighbourhood of the Sun is sufficient to reduce the need of dark matter by 50% in the Milky Way. Finally, we find that the presence of such a dragging vortex also returns a net contribution to the strong gravitational lensing generated by the galaxy. Thus, we show that the considered class of general relativistic galaxy models, is not only physically viable, but suggests the need for recalibration of the estimated dark matter content in disc galaxies, with far reaching consequences for astrophysics and cosmology.

### Exploring Model Kinship for Merging Large Language Models
**Authors**: Yedi Hu, Yunzhi Yao, Ningyu Zhang, Shumin Deng, Huajun Chen

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T14:29:29Z

**Summary**: Model merging has become one of the key technologies for enhancing the capabilities and efficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, our understanding of the expected performance gains and principles when merging any two models remains limited. In this work, we introduce model kinship, the degree of similarity or relatedness between LLMs, analogous to biological evolution. With comprehensive empirical analysis, we find that there is a certain relationship between model kinship and the performance gains after model merging, which can help guide our selection of candidate models. Inspired by this, we propose a new model merging strategy: Top-k Greedy Merging with Model Kinship, which can yield better performance on benchmark datasets. Specifically, we discover that using model kinship as a criterion can assist us in continuously performing model merging, alleviating the degradation (local optima) in model evolution, whereas model kinship can serve as a guide to escape these traps. Code is available at https://github.com/zjunlp/ModelKinship.

### Not All Votes Count! Programs as Verifiers Improve Self-Consistency of   Language Models for Math Reasoning
**Authors**: Vernon Y. H. Toh, Deepanway Ghosal, Soujanya Poria

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T14:24:55Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have shown increasing proficiency in solving mathematical reasoning problems. However, many current open-source LLMs often still make calculation and semantic understanding errors in their intermediate reasoning steps. In this work, we propose PROVE, a simple yet effective framework that uses program-based verification as a heuristic to filter out potentially incorrect reasoning paths before aggregating the final answers. Instead of relying on vanilla majority voting, our approach rejects solutions whose corresponding program outputs are inconsistent with the generated solution, aggregating only those validated by Python programs. We conducted extensive experiments on 13 open-source LLMs from various model families and sizes, ranging from 0.5B to 13B parameters, across seven math benchmarks. We demonstrate that PROVE consistently outperforms vanilla majority voting as a heuristic for solving mathematical reasoning tasks across all datasets and model sizes. Notably, PROVE increases accuracy on the GSM8K benchmark from 48.85% to 53.83% for Qwen2-0.5B-Instruct, from 65.66% to 73.01% for Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct, from 73.39% to 79.61% for Gemma-2-2b-it, and from 41.32% to 59.51% for Llama-2-7B-chat.

### CCSBench: Evaluating Compositional Controllability in LLMs for   Scientific Document Summarization
**Authors**: Yixi Ding, Jiaying Wu, Tongyao Zhu, Yanxia Qin, Qian Liu, Min-Yen Kan

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T14:21:52Z

**Summary**: To broaden the dissemination of scientific knowledge to diverse audiences, scientific document summarization must simultaneously control multiple attributes such as length and empirical focus. However, existing research typically focuses on controlling single attributes, leaving the compositional control of multiple attributes underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce CCSBench, a benchmark for compositional controllable summarization in the scientific domain. Our benchmark enables fine-grained control over both explicit attributes (e.g., length), which are objective and straightforward, and implicit attributes (e.g., empirical focus), which are more subjective and conceptual. We conduct extensive experiments on GPT-4, LLaMA2, and other popular LLMs under various settings. Our findings reveal significant limitations in large language models' ability to balance trade-offs between control attributes, especially implicit ones that require deeper understanding and abstract reasoning.

### On The MCMC Performance In Bernoulli Group Testing And The Random Max   Set-Cover Problem
**Authors**: Maxwell Lovig, Ilias Zadik

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T14:20:16Z

**Summary**: The group testing problem is a canonical inference task where one seeks to identify $k$ infected individuals out of a population of $n$ people, based on the outcomes of $m$ group tests. Of particular interest is the case of Bernoulli group testing (BGT), where each individual participates in each test independently and with a fixed probability. BGT is known to be an "information-theoretically" optimal design, as there exists a decoder that can identify with high probability as $n$ grows the infected individuals using $m^*=\log_2 \binom{n}{k}$ BGT tests, which is the minimum required number of tests among \emph{all} group testing designs.   An important open question in the field is if a polynomial-time decoder exists for BGT which succeeds also with $m^*$ samples. In a recent paper (Iliopoulos, Zadik COLT '21) some evidence was presented (but no proof) that a simple low-temperature MCMC method could succeed. The evidence was based on a first-moment (or "annealed") analysis of the landscape, as well as simulations that show the MCMC success for $n \approx 1000s$.   In this work, we prove that, despite the intriguing success in simulations for small $n$, the class of MCMC methods proposed in previous work for BGT with $m^*$ samples takes super-polynomial-in-$n$ time to identify the infected individuals, when $k=n^{\alpha}$ for $\alpha \in (0,1)$ small enough. Towards obtaining our results, we establish the tight max-satisfiability thresholds of the random $k$-set cover problem, a result of potentially independent interest in the study of random constraint satisfaction problems.

### Dynamic Tuning Towards Parameter and Inference Efficiency for ViT   Adaptation
**Authors**: Wangbo Zhao, Jiasheng Tang, Yizeng Han, Yibing Song, Kai Wang, Gao Huang, Fan Wang, Yang You

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T14:18:53Z

**Summary**: Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods have achieved significant success on vision transformers (ViTs) adaptation by improving parameter efficiency. However, the exploration of enhancing inference efficiency during adaptation remains underexplored. This limits the broader application of pre-trained ViT models, especially when the model is computationally extensive. In this paper, we propose Dynamic Tuning (DyT), a novel approach to improve both parameter and inference efficiency for ViT adaptation. Specifically, besides using the lightweight adapter modules, we propose a token dispatcher to distinguish informative tokens from less important ones, allowing the latter to dynamically skip the original block, thereby reducing the redundant computation during inference. Additionally, we explore multiple design variants to find the best practice of DyT. Finally, inspired by the mixture-of-experts (MoE) mechanism, we introduce an enhanced adapter to further boost the adaptation performance. We validate DyT across various tasks, including image/video recognition and semantic segmentation. For instance, DyT achieves superior performance compared to existing PEFT methods while evoking only 71% of their FLOPs on the VTAB-1K benchmark.

### On the Risk of Evidence Pollution for Malicious Social Text Detection in   the Era of LLMs
**Authors**: Herun Wan, Minnan Luo, Zhixiong Su, Guang Dai, Xiang Zhao

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T14:17:53Z

**Summary**: Evidence-enhanced detectors present remarkable abilities in identifying malicious social text with related evidence. However, the rise of large language models (LLMs) brings potential risks of evidence pollution to confuse detectors. This paper explores how to manipulate evidence, simulating potential misuse scenarios including basic pollution, and rephrasing or generating evidence by LLMs. To mitigate its negative impact, we propose three defense strategies from both the data and model sides, including machine-generated text detection, a mixture of experts, and parameter updating. Extensive experiments on four malicious social text detection tasks with ten datasets present that evidence pollution, especially the generate strategy, significantly compromises existing detectors. On the other hand, the defense strategies could mitigate evidence pollution, but they faced limitations for practical employment, such as the need for annotated data and huge inference costs. Further analysis illustrates that polluted evidence is of high quality, would compromise the model calibration, and could ensemble to amplify the negative impact.

### From Explainable to Interpretable Deep Learning for Natural Language   Processing in Healthcare: How Far from Reality?
**Authors**: Guangming Huang, Yingya Li, Shoaib Jameel, Yunfei Long, Giorgos Papanastasiou

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T14:14:27Z

**Summary**: Deep learning (DL) has substantially enhanced natural language processing (NLP) in healthcare research. However, the increasing complexity of DL-based NLP necessitates transparent model interpretability, or at least explainability, for reliable decision-making. This work presents a thorough scoping review of explainable and interpretable DL in healthcare NLP. The term "eXplainable and Interpretable Artificial Intelligence" (XIAI) is introduced to distinguish XAI from IAI. Different models are further categorized based on their functionality (model-, input-, output-based) and scope (local, global). Our analysis shows that attention mechanisms are the most prevalent emerging IAI technique. The use of IAI is growing, distinguishing it from XAI. The major challenges identified are that most XIAI does not explore "global" modelling processes, the lack of best practices, and the lack of systematic evaluation and benchmarks. One important opportunity is to use attention mechanisms to enhance multi-modal XIAI for personalized medicine. Additionally, combining DL with causal logic holds promise. Our discussion encourages the integration of XIAI in Large Language Models (LLMs) and domain-specific smaller models. In conclusion, XIAI adoption in healthcare requires dedicated in-house expertise. Collaboration with domain experts, end-users, and policymakers can lead to ready-to-use XIAI methods across NLP and medical tasks. While challenges exist, XIAI techniques offer a valuable foundation for interpretable NLP algorithms in healthcare.

### Prompting Explicit and Implicit Knowledge for Multi-hop Question   Answering Based on Human Reading Process
**Authors**: Guangming Huang, Yunfei Long, Cunjin Luo, Jiaxing Shen, Xia Sun

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T14:12:47Z

**Summary**: Pre-trained language models (PLMs) leverage chains-of-thought (CoT) to simulate human reasoning and inference processes, achieving proficient performance in multi-hop QA. However, a gap persists between PLMs' reasoning abilities and those of humans when tackling complex problems. Psychological studies suggest a vital connection between explicit information in passages and human prior knowledge during reading. Nevertheless, current research has given insufficient attention to linking input passages and PLMs' pre-training-based knowledge from the perspective of human cognition studies. In this study, we introduce a Prompting Explicit and Implicit knowledge (PEI) framework, which uses prompts to connect explicit and implicit knowledge, aligning with human reading process for multi-hop QA. We consider the input passages as explicit knowledge, employing them to elicit implicit knowledge through unified prompt reasoning. Furthermore, our model incorporates type-specific reasoning via prompts, a form of implicit knowledge. Experimental results show that PEI performs comparably to the state-of-the-art on HotpotQA. Ablation studies confirm the efficacy of our model in bridging and integrating explicit and implicit knowledge.

### Flexible and Efficient Estimation of Causal Effects with Error-Prone   Exposures: A Control Variates Approach for Measurement Error
**Authors**: Keith Barnatchez, Rachel Nethery, Bryan E. Shepherd, Giovanni Parmigiani, Kevin P. Josey

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T14:10:29Z

**Summary**: Exposure measurement error is a ubiquitous but often overlooked challenge in causal inference with observational data. Existing methods accounting for exposure measurement error largely rely on restrictive parametric assumptions, while emerging data-adaptive estimation approaches allow for less restrictive assumptions but at the cost of flexibility, as they are typically tailored towards rigidly-defined statistical quantities. There remains a critical need for assumption-lean estimation methods that are both flexible and possess desirable theoretical properties across a variety of study designs. In this paper, we introduce a general framework for estimation of causal quantities in the presence of exposure measurement error, adapted from the control variates approach of Yang and Ding (2019). Our method can be implemented in various two-phase sampling study designs, where one obtains gold-standard exposure measurements for a small subset of the full study sample, called the validation data. The control variates framework leverages both the error-prone and error-free exposure measurements by augmenting an initial consistent estimator from the validation data with a variance reduction term formed from the full data. We show that our method inherits double-robustness properties under standard causal assumptions. Simulation studies show that our approach performs favorably compared to leading methods under various two-phase sampling schemes. We illustrate our method with observational electronic health record data on HIV outcomes from the Vanderbilt Comprehensive Care Clinic.

### Waveform accuracy and systematic uncertainties in current gravitational   wave observations
**Authors**: Caroline B. Owen, Carl-Johan Haster, Scott Perkins, Neil J. Cornish, Nicolás Yunes

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T14:10:25Z

**Summary**: The post-Newtonian formalism plays an integral role in the models used to extract information from gravitational wave data, but models that incorporate this formalism are inherently approximations. Disagreement between an approximate model and nature will produce mismodeling biases in the parameters inferred from data, introducing systematic error. We here carry out a proof-of-principle study of such systematic error by considering signals produced by quasi-circular, inspiraling black hole binaries through an injection and recovery campaign. In particular, we study how unknown, but calibrated, higher-order post-Newtonian corrections to the gravitational wave phase impact systematic error in recovered parameters. As a first study, we produce injected data of non-spinning binaries as detected by a current, second-generation network of ground-based observatories and recover them with models of varying PN order in the phase. We find that the truncation of higher order (>3.5) post-Newtonian corrections to the phase can produce significant systematic error even at signal-to-noise ratios of current detector networks. We propose a method to mitigate systematic error by marginalizing over our ignorance in the waveform through the inclusion of higher-order post-Newtonian coefficients as new model parameters. We show that this method can reduce systematic error greatly at the cost of increasing statistical error.

### Can We Reverse In-Context Knowledge Edits?
**Authors**: Paul Youssef, Zhixue Zhao, Jörg Schlötterer, Christin Seifert

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T14:04:26Z

**Summary**: In-context knowledge editing (IKE) enables efficient modification of large language model (LLM) outputs without parameter changes and at zero-cost. However, it can be misused to manipulate responses opaquely, e.g., insert misinformation or offensive content. Such malicious interventions could be incorporated into high-level wrapped APIs where the final input prompt is not shown to end-users. To address this issue, we investigate the detection and reversal of IKE-edits. First, we demonstrate that IKE-edits can be detected with high accuracy (F1 > 80\%) using only the top-10 output probabilities of the next token, even in a black-box setting, e.g. proprietary LLMs with limited output information. Further, we introduce the novel task of reversing IKE-edits using specially tuned reversal tokens. We explore using both continuous and discrete reversal tokens, achieving over 80\% accuracy in recovering original, unedited outputs across multiple LLMs. Our continuous reversal tokens prove particularly effective, with minimal impact on unedited prompts. Through analysis of output distributions, attention patterns, and token rankings, we provide insights into IKE's effects on LLMs and how reversal tokens mitigate them. This work represents a significant step towards enhancing LLM resilience against potential misuse of in-context editing, improving their transparency and trustworthiness.

### STRUX: An LLM for Decision-Making with Structured Explanations
**Authors**: Yiming Lu, Yebowen Hu, Hassan Foroosh, Wei Jin, Fei Liu

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T14:01:22Z

**Summary**: Countless decisions shape our daily lives, and it is paramount to understand the how and why behind these choices. In this paper, we introduce a new LLM decision-making framework called STRUX, which enhances LLM decision-making by providing structured explanations. These include favorable and adverse facts related to the decision, along with their respective strengths. STRUX begins by distilling lengthy information into a concise table of key facts. It then employs a series of self-reflection steps to determine which of these facts are pivotal, categorizing them as either favorable or adverse in relation to a specific decision. Lastly, we fine-tune an LLM to identify and prioritize these key facts to optimize decision-making. STRUX has been evaluated on the challenging task of forecasting stock investment decisions based on earnings call transcripts and demonstrated superior performance against strong baselines. It enhances decision transparency by allowing users to understand the impact of different factors, representing a meaningful step towards practical decision-making with LLMs.

### On the Utility of Domain Modeling Assistance with Large Language Models
**Authors**: Meriem Ben Chaaben, Lola Burgueño, Istvan David, Houari Sahraoui

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T13:55:34Z

**Summary**: Model-driven engineering (MDE) simplifies software development through abstraction, yet challenges such as time constraints, incomplete domain understanding, and adherence to syntactic constraints hinder the design process. This paper presents a study to evaluate the usefulness of a novel approach utilizing large language models (LLMs) and few-shot prompt learning to assist in domain modeling. The aim of this approach is to overcome the need for extensive training of AI-based completion models on scarce domain-specific datasets and to offer versatile support for various modeling activities, providing valuable recommendations to software modelers. To support this approach, we developed MAGDA, a user-friendly tool, through which we conduct a user study and assess the real-world applicability of our approach in the context of domain modeling, offering valuable insights into its usability and effectiveness.

### PromptDSI: Prompt-based Rehearsal-free Instance-wise Incremental   Learning for Document Retrieval
**Authors**: Tuan-Luc Huynh, Thuy-Trang Vu, Weiqing Wang, Yinwei Wei, Trung Le, Dragan Gasevic, Yuan-Fang Li, Thanh-Toan Do

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T13:45:54Z

**Summary**: Differentiable Search Index (DSI) utilizes Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) for efficient document retrieval without relying on external indexes. However, DSI needs full re-training to handle updates in dynamic corpora, causing significant computational inefficiencies. We introduce PromptDSI, a prompt-based rehearsal-free approach for instance-wise incremental learning document retrieval. PromptDSI attaches prompts to the frozen PLM's encoder of DSI, leveraging its powerful representation to efficiently index new corpora while maintaining a balance between stability and plasticity. We eliminate the initial forward pass of prompt-based continual learning methods that doubles training and inference time. Moreover, we propose a topic-aware prompt pool that employs neural topic embeddings as fixed keys. This strategy ensures diverse and effective prompt usage, addressing the challenge of parameter underutilization caused by the collapse of the query-key matching mechanism. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that BERT-based PromptDSI matches IncDSI in managing forgetting while improving new corpora performance by more than 4% Hits@10 on NQ320k and upto 3% MRR@10 on MS MARCO 300k.

### Robust RL with LLM-Driven Data Synthesis and Policy Adaptation for   Autonomous Driving
**Authors**: Sihao Wu, Jiaxu Liu, Xiangyu Yin, Guangliang Cheng, Meng Fang, Xingyu Zhao, Xinping Yi, Xiaowei Huang

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T13:43:00Z

**Summary**: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into autonomous driving systems demonstrates strong common sense and reasoning abilities, effectively addressing the pitfalls of purely data-driven methods. Current LLM-based agents require lengthy inference times and face challenges in interacting with real-time autonomous driving environments. A key open question is whether we can effectively leverage the knowledge from LLMs to train an efficient and robust Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent. This paper introduces RAPID, a novel \underline{\textbf{R}}obust \underline{\textbf{A}}daptive \underline{\textbf{P}}olicy \underline{\textbf{I}}nfusion and \underline{\textbf{D}}istillation framework, which trains specialized mix-of-policy RL agents using data synthesized by an LLM-based driving agent and online adaptation. RAPID features three key designs: 1) utilization of offline data collected from an LLM agent to distil expert knowledge into RL policies for faster real-time inference; 2) introduction of robust distillation in RL to inherit both performance and robustness from LLM-based teacher; and 3) employment of a mix-of-policy approach for joint decision decoding with a policy adapter. Through fine-tuning via online environment interaction, RAPID reduces the forgetting of LLM knowledge while maintaining adaptability to different tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate RAPID's capability to effectively integrate LLM knowledge into scaled-down RL policies in an efficient, adaptable, and robust way. Code and checkpoints will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

### The Comparative Trap: Pairwise Comparisons Amplifies Biased Preferences   of LLM Evaluators
**Authors**: Hawon Jeong, ChaeHun Park, Jimin Hong, Hojoon Lee, Jaegul Choo

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T13:39:49Z

**Summary**: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as evaluators for natural language generation tasks, ensuring unbiased assessments is essential. However, LLM evaluators often display biased preferences, such as favoring verbosity and authoritative tones. Our empirical analysis reveals that these biases are exacerbated in pairwise evaluation, where LLMs directly compare two outputs and easily prioritize superficial attributes. In contrast, pointwise evaluation, which assesses outputs independently, is less susceptible to such bias because each output is judged in isolation. To address the limitations of the pairwise evaluation, we introduce a novel evaluation method, PRePair, which integrates pointwise reasoning within a pairwise framework. PRePair effectively alleviates biased preference, improving performance on the adversarial benchmark (LLMBar) while outperforming pointwise evaluation on the standard benchmark (MT-Bench).

### FTII-Bench: A Comprehensive Multimodal Benchmark for Flow Text with   Image Insertion
**Authors**: Jiacheng Ruan, Yebin Yang, Zehao Lin, Feiyu Xiong, Zeyun Tang, Zhiyu Li

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T13:38:31Z

**Summary**: Benefiting from the revolutionary advances in large language models (LLMs) and foundational vision models, large vision-language models (LVLMs) have also made significant progress. However, current benchmarks focus on tasks that evaluating only a single aspect of LVLM capabilities (e.g., recognition, detection, understanding). These tasks fail to fully demonstrate LVLMs' potential in complex application scenarios. To comprehensively assess the performance of existing LVLMs, we propose a more challenging task called the Flow Text with Image Insertion task (FTII). This task requires LVLMs to simultaneously possess outstanding abilities in image comprehension, instruction understanding, and long-text interpretation. Specifically, given several text paragraphs and a set of candidate images, as the text paragraphs accumulate, the LVLMs are required to select the most suitable image from the candidates to insert after the corresponding paragraph. Constructing a benchmark for such a task is highly challenging, particularly in determining the sequence of flowing text and images. To address this challenge, we turn to professional news reports, which naturally contain a gold standard for image-text sequences. Based on this, we introduce the Flow Text with Image Insertion Benchmark (FTII-Bench), which includes 318 high-quality Chinese image-text news articles and 307 high-quality English image-text news articles, covering 10 different news domains. Using these 625 high-quality articles, we construct problems of two different types with multiple levels of difficulty. Furthermore, we establish two different evaluation pipelines based on the CLIP model and existing LVLMs. We evaluate 9 open-source and 2 closed-source LVLMs as well as 2 CLIP-based models. Results indicate that even the most advanced models (e.g., GPT-4o) face significant challenges when tackling the FTII task.

### This is not normal! (Re-) Evaluating the lower $n$ guidelines for   regression analysis
**Authors**: David Randahl

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T13:38:09Z

**Summary**: The commonly cited rule of thumb for regression analysis, which suggests that a sample size of $n \geq 30$ is sufficient to ensure valid inferences, is frequently referenced but rarely scrutinized. This research note evaluates the lower bound for the number of observations required for regression analysis by exploring how different distributional characteristics, such as skewness and kurtosis, influence the convergence of t-values to the t-distribution in linear regression models. Through an extensive simulation study involving over 22 billion regression models, this paper examines a range of symmetric, platykurtic, and skewed distributions, testing sample sizes from 4 to 10,000. The results show that it is sufficient that either the dependent or independent variable follow a symmetric distribution for the t-values to converge at much smaller sample sizes than $n=30$, unless the other variable is extremely skewed. This is contrary to previous guidance which suggests that the error term needs to be normally distributed for this convergence to happen at low $n$. However, when both variables are highly skewed, much larger sample sizes are required. These findings suggest the $n \geq 30$ rule is overly conservative in some cases and insufficient in others, offering revised guidelines for determining minimum sample sizes.

### A Claim Decomposition Benchmark for Long-form Answer Verification
**Authors**: Zhihao Zhang, Yixing Fan, Ruqing Zhang, Jiafeng Guo

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T13:34:51Z

**Summary**: The advancement of LLMs has significantly boosted the performance of complex long-form question answering tasks. However, one prominent issue of LLMs is the generated "hallucination" responses that are not factual. Consequently, attribution for each claim in responses becomes a common solution to improve the factuality and verifiability. Existing researches mainly focus on how to provide accurate citations for the response, which largely overlook the importance of identifying the claims or statements for each response. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new claim decomposition benchmark, which requires building system that can identify atomic and checkworthy claims for LLM responses. Specifically, we present the Chinese Atomic Claim Decomposition Dataset (CACDD), which builds on the WebCPM dataset with additional expert annotations to ensure high data quality. The CACDD encompasses a collection of 500 human-annotated question-answer pairs, including a total of 4956 atomic claims. We further propose a new pipeline for human annotation and describe the challenges of this task. In addition, we provide experiment results on zero-shot, few-shot and fine-tuned LLMs as baselines. The results show that the claim decomposition is highly challenging and requires further explorations. All code and data are publicly available at \url{https://github.com/FBzzh/CACDD}.

### One Step Diffusion via Shortcut Models
**Authors**: Kevin Frans, Danijar Hafner, Sergey Levine, Pieter Abbeel

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T13:34:40Z

**Summary**: Diffusion models and flow-matching models have enabled generating diverse and realistic images by learning to transfer noise to data. However, sampling from these models involves iterative denoising over many neural network passes, making generation slow and expensive. Previous approaches for speeding up sampling require complex training regimes, such as multiple training phases, multiple networks, or fragile scheduling. We introduce shortcut models, a family of generative models that use a single network and training phase to produce high-quality samples in a single or multiple sampling steps. Shortcut models condition the network not only on the current noise level but also on the desired step size, allowing the model to skip ahead in the generation process. Across a wide range of sampling step budgets, shortcut models consistently produce higher quality samples than previous approaches, such as consistency models and reflow. Compared to distillation, shortcut models reduce complexity to a single network and training phase and additionally allow varying step budgets at inference time.

**Authors**: Davide Venditti, Elena Sofia Ruzzetti, Giancarlo A. Xompero, Cristina Giannone, Andrea Favalli, Raniero Romagnoli, Fabio Massimo Zanzotto

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T13:31:05Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) require a significant redesign in solutions to preserve privacy in data-intensive applications due to their text-generation capabilities. Indeed, LLMs tend to memorize and emit private information when maliciously prompted. In this paper, we introduce Private Association Editing (PAE) as a novel defense approach for private data leakage. PAE is designed to effectively remove Personally Identifiable Information (PII) without retraining the model. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of PAE with respect to alternative baseline methods. We believe PAE will serve as a critical tool in the ongoing effort to protect data privacy in LLMs, encouraging the development of safer models for real-world applications.

### LLM-based Translation Inference with Iterative Bilingual Understanding
**Authors**: Andong Chen, Kehai Chen, Yang Xiang, Xuefeng Bai, Muyun Yang, Tiejun Zhao, Min zhang

**Updated**: 2024-10-17T02:28:25Z

**Summary**: The remarkable understanding and generation capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have greatly improved translation performance. However, incorrect understanding of the sentence to be translated can degrade translation quality. To address this issue, we proposed a novel Iterative Bilingual Understanding Translation (IBUT) method based on the cross-lingual capabilities of LLMs and the dual characteristics of translation tasks. The cross-lingual capability of LLMs enables the generation of contextual understanding for both the source and target languages separately. Furthermore, the dual characteristics allow IBUT to generate effective cross-lingual feedback, iteratively refining contextual understanding, thereby reducing errors and improving translation performance. Experimental results showed that the proposed IBUT outperforms several strong comparison methods, especially being generalized to multiple domains (e.g., news, commonsense, and cultural translation benchmarks).

### Counterfactual Effect Decomposition in Multi-Agent Sequential Decision   Making
**Authors**: Stelios Triantafyllou, Aleksa Sukovic, Yasaman Zolfimoselo, Goran Radanovic

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T13:20:35Z

**Summary**: We address the challenge of explaining counterfactual outcomes in multi-agent Markov decision processes. In particular, we aim to explain the total counterfactual effect of an agent's action on the outcome of a realized scenario through its influence on the environment dynamics and the agents' behavior. To achieve this, we introduce a novel causal explanation formula that decomposes the counterfactual effect by attributing to each agent and state variable a score reflecting their respective contributions to the effect. First, we show that the total counterfactual effect of an agent's action can be decomposed into two components: one measuring the effect that propagates through all subsequent agents' actions and another related to the effect that propagates through the state transitions. Building on recent advancements in causal contribution analysis, we further decompose these two effects as follows. For the former, we consider agent-specific effects -- a causal concept that quantifies the counterfactual effect of an agent's action that propagates through a subset of agents. Based on this notion, we use Shapley value to attribute the effect to individual agents. For the latter, we consider the concept of structure-preserving interventions and attribute the effect to state variables based on their "intrinsic" contributions. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate the interpretability of our decomposition approach in a Gridworld environment with LLM-assisted agents and a sepsis management simulator.

### DIRAS: Efficient LLM Annotation of Document Relevance in Retrieval   Augmented Generation
**Authors**: Jingwei Ni, Tobias Schimanski, Meihong Lin, Mrinmaya Sachan, Elliott Ash, Markus Leippold

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T13:16:25Z

**Summary**: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is widely employed to ground responses to queries on domain-specific documents. But do RAG implementations leave out important information when answering queries that need an integrated analysis of information (e.g., Tell me good news in the stock market today.)? To address these concerns, RAG developers need to annotate information retrieval (IR) data for their domain of interest, which is challenging because (1) domain-specific queries usually need nuanced definitions of relevance beyond shallow semantic relevance; and (2) human or GPT-4 annotation is costly and cannot cover all (query, document) pairs (i.e., annotation selection bias), thus harming the effectiveness in evaluating IR recall. To address these challenges, we propose DIRAS (Domain-specific Information Retrieval Annotation with Scalability), a manual-annotation-free schema that fine-tunes open-sourced LLMs to consider nuanced relevance definition and annotate (partial) relevance labels with calibrated relevance scores. Extensive evaluation shows that DIRAS enables smaller (8B) LLMs to achieve GPT-4-level performance on annotating and ranking unseen (query, document) pairs, and is helpful for real-world RAG development. All code, LLM generations, and human annotations can be found in \url{https://github.com/EdisonNi-hku/DIRAS}.

### Generative AI and Perceptual Harms: Who's Suspected of using LLMs?
**Authors**: Kowe Kadoma, Danaë Metaxa, Mor Naaman

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T13:14:46Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into a variety of writing tasks. While these tools can help people by generating ideas or producing higher quality work, like many other AI tools they may risk causing a variety of harms, disproportionately burdening historically marginalized groups. In this work, we introduce and evaluate perceptual harm, a term for the harm caused to users when others perceive or suspect them of using AI. We examined perceptual harms in three online experiments, each of which entailed human participants evaluating the profiles for fictional freelance writers. We asked participants whether they suspected the freelancers of using AI, the quality of their writing, and whether they should be hired. We found some support for perceptual harms against for certain demographic groups, but that perceptions of AI use negatively impacted writing evaluations and hiring outcomes across the board.

**Authors**: Zhiyuan Ma, Yuzhu Zhang, Guoli Jia, Liangliang Zhao, Yichao Ma, Mingjie Ma, Gaofeng Liu, Kaiyan Zhang, Jianjun Li, Bowen Zhou

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T13:10:32Z

**Summary**: As one of the most popular and sought-after generative models in the recent years, diffusion models have sparked the interests of many researchers and steadily shown excellent advantage in various generative tasks such as image synthesis, video generation, molecule design, 3D scene rendering and multimodal generation, relying on their dense theoretical principles and reliable application practices. The remarkable success of these recent efforts on diffusion models comes largely from progressive design principles and efficient architecture, training, inference, and deployment methodologies. However, there has not been a comprehensive and in-depth review to summarize these principles and practices to help the rapid understanding and application of diffusion models. In this survey, we provide a new efficiency-oriented perspective on these existing efforts, which mainly focuses on the profound principles and efficient practices in architecture designs, model training, fast inference and reliable deployment, to guide further theoretical research, algorithm migration and model application for new scenarios in a reader-friendly way. \url{https://github.com/ponyzym/Efficient-DMs-Survey}

**Authors**: Jinjie Wei, Dingkang Yang, Yanshu Li, Qingyao Xu, Zhaoyu Chen, Mingcheng Li, Yue Jiang, Xiaolu Hou, Lihua Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T13:10:27Z

**Summary**: Large Language Model (LLM)-driven interactive systems currently show potential promise in healthcare domains. Despite their remarkable capabilities, LLMs typically lack personalized recommendations and diagnosis analysis in sophisticated medical applications, causing hallucinations and performance bottlenecks. To address these challenges, this paper proposes MedAide, an LLM-based omni medical multi-agent collaboration framework for specialized healthcare services. Specifically, MedAide first performs query rewriting through retrieval-augmented generation to accomplish accurate medical intent understanding. Immediately, we devise a contextual encoder to obtain intent prototype embeddings, which are used to recognize fine-grained intents by similarity matching. According to the intent relevance, the activated agents collaborate effectively to provide integrated decision analysis. Extensive experiments are conducted on four medical benchmarks with composite intents. Experimental results from automated metrics and expert doctor evaluations show that MedAide outperforms current LLMs and improves their medical proficiency and strategic reasoning.

### MambaPainter: Neural Stroke-Based Rendering in a Single Step
**Authors**: Tomoya Sawada, Marie Katsurai

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T13:02:45Z

**Summary**: Stroke-based rendering aims to reconstruct an input image into an oil painting style by predicting brush stroke sequences. Conventional methods perform this prediction stroke-by-stroke or require multiple inference steps due to the limitations of a predictable number of strokes. This procedure leads to inefficient translation speed, limiting their practicality. In this study, we propose MambaPainter, capable of predicting a sequence of over 100 brush strokes in a single inference step, resulting in rapid translation. We achieve this sequence prediction by incorporating the selective state-space model. Additionally, we introduce a simple extension to patch-based rendering, which we use to translate high-resolution images, improving the visual quality with a minimal increase in computational cost. Experimental results demonstrate that MambaPainter can efficiently translate inputs to oil painting-style images compared to state-of-the-art methods. The codes are available at https://github.com/STomoya/MambaPainter.

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T12:57:56Z

**Summary**: Despite the remarkable success of LLMs in English, there is a significant gap in performance in non-English languages. In order to address this, we introduce a novel recipe for creating a multilingual synthetic instruction tuning dataset, sPhinX, which is created by selectively translating instruction response pairs from English into 50 languages. We test the effectiveness of sPhinx by using it to fine-tune two state-of-the-art models, Mistral-7B and Phi-Small and then evaluating them across a comprehensive suite of multilingual benchmarks that test reasoning, question answering, reading comprehension and machine translation. Our results show that Mistral-7B and Phi-Small fine-tuned with sPhinX perform better on an average by 5%pt for both the models when compared to the base variants of these models. We also devise a strategy to incorporate N-shot examples in each fine-tuning sample which further boosts the performance of these models by 9%pt and 4%pt respectively respectively compared to vanilla fine-tuning. To show efficacy of our data curation approach, we also directly translate our original dataset to the target languages, and observe an increase of 7%pt and 4%pt on both the models respectively. sPhinX outperforms other multilingual instruction tuning datasets in both efficiency and diversity, reducing dataset creation costs. It also maintains strong performance on standard English LLM benchmarks, with minimal regression.

### FLEX: Expert-level False-Less EXecution Metric for Reliable Text-to-SQL   Benchmark
**Authors**: Heegyu Kim, Taeyang Jeon, Seunghwan Choi, Seungtaek Choi, Hyunsouk Cho

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T12:55:55Z

**Summary**: Text-to-SQL systems have become crucial for translating natural language into SQL queries in various industries, enabling non-technical users to perform complex data operations. The need for accurate evaluation methods has increased as these systems have grown more sophisticated. However, the Execution Accuracy (EX), the most prevalent evaluation metric, still shows many false positives and negatives. Thus, this paper introduces FLEX (False-Less EXecution), a novel approach to evaluating text-to-SQL systems using large language models (LLMs) to emulate human expert-level evaluation of SQL queries. Our metric improves agreement with human experts (from 62 to 87.04 in Cohen's kappa) with comprehensive context and sophisticated criteria. Our extensive experiments yield several key insights: (1) Models' performance increases by over 2.6 points on average, substantially affecting rankings on Spider and BIRD benchmarks; (2) The underestimation of models in EX primarily stems from annotation quality issues; and (3) Model performance on particularly challenging questions tends to be overestimated. This work contributes to a more accurate and nuanced evaluation of text-to-SQL systems, potentially reshaping our understanding of state-of-the-art performance in this field.

### RosePO: Aligning LLM-based Recommenders with Human Values
**Authors**: Jiayi Liao, Xiangnan He, Ruobing Xie, Jiancan Wu, Yancheng Yuan, Xingwu Sun, Zhanhui Kang, Xiang Wang

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T12:54:34Z

**Summary**: Recently, there has been a growing interest in leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for recommendation systems, which usually adapt a pre-trained LLM to the recommendation scenario through supervised fine-tuning (SFT). However, both the pre-training and SFT stages fail to explicitly model the comparative relationships of a user's preferences on different items. To construct a "helpful and harmless" LLM-based recommender, we propose a general framework -- Recommendation with smoothing personalized Preference Optimization (RosePO), which better aligns with customized human values during the post-training stage. Specifically, in addition to the input and chosen response that naturally align with SFT data, we design a rejected sampling strategy tailored for enhancing helpfulness, along with two strategies aimed at mitigating biases to promote harmlessness. To ensure robustness against uncertain labels present in automatically constructed preference data, we introduce a personalized smoothing factor predicted by a preference oracle into the optimization objective. Evaluation on three real-world datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of our method, showcasing not only improved recommendation performance but also mitigation of semantic hallucination and popularity bias.

### FiRST: Finetuning Router-Selective Transformers for Input-Adaptive   Latency Reduction
**Authors**: Akriti Jain, Saransh Sharma, Koyel Mukherjee, Soumyabrata Pal

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T12:45:35Z

**Summary**: Auto-regressive Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable performance across domanins such as vision and language processing. However, due to sequential processing through a stack of transformer layers, autoregressive decoding faces significant computation/latency challenges, particularly in resource constrained environments like mobile and edge devices. Existing approaches in literature that aim to improve latency via skipping layers have two distinct flavors - 1) Early exit 2) Input-agnostic heuristics where tokens exit at pre-determined layers irrespective of input sequence. Both the above strategies have limitations - the former cannot be applied to handle KV Caching necessary for speed-ups in modern framework and the latter does not capture the variation in layer importance across tasks or more generally, across input sequences. To address both limitations, we propose FIRST, an algorithm that reduces inference latency by using layer-specific routers to select a subset of transformer layers adaptively for each input sequence - the prompt (during prefill stage) decides which layers will be skipped during decoding. FIRST preserves compatibility with KV caching enabling faster inference while being quality-aware. FIRST is model-agnostic and can be easily enabled on any pre-trained LLM. We further improve performance by incorporating LoRA adapters for fine-tuning on external datasets, enhancing task-specific accuracy while maintaining latency benefits. Our approach reveals that input adaptivity is critical - indeed, different task-specific middle layers play a crucial role in evolving hidden representations depending on task. Extensive experiments show that FIRST significantly reduces latency while retaining competitive performance (as compared to baselines), making our approach an efficient solution for LLM deployment in low-resource environments.

### Data depth functions for non-standard data by use of formal concept   analysis
**Authors**: Hannah Blocher, Georg Schollmeyer

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T12:43:36Z

**Summary**: In this article we introduce a notion of depth functions for data types that are not given in standard statistical data formats. We focus on data that cannot be represented by one specific data structure, such as normed vector spaces. This covers a wide range of different data types, which we refer to as non-standard data. Depth functions have been studied intensively for normed vector spaces. However, a discussion of depth functions for non-standard data is lacking. In this article, we address this gap by using formal concept analysis to obtain a unified data representation. Building on this representation, we then define depth functions for non-standard data. Furthermore, we provide a systematic basis by introducing structural properties using the data representation provided by formal concept analysis. Finally, we embed the generalised Tukey depth into our concept of data depth and analyse it using the introduced structural properties. Thus, this article presents the mathematical formalisation of centrality and outlyingness for non-standard data and increases the number of spaces in which centrality can be discussed. In particular, we provide a basis for defining further depth functions and statistical inference methods for non-standard data.

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T12:36:23Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained prominence in the AI landscape due to their exceptional performance. Thus, it is essential to gain a better understanding of their capabilities and limitations, among others in terms of nonmonotonic reasoning. This paper proposes a benchmark that corresponds to various defeasible rule-based reasoning patterns. We modified an existing benchmark for defeasible logic reasoners by translating defeasible rules into text suitable for LLMs. We conducted preliminary experiments on nonmonotonic rule-based reasoning using ChatGPT and compared it with reasoning patterns defined by defeasible logic.

### With a Grain of SALT: Are LLMs Fair Across Social Dimensions?
**Authors**: Samee Arif, Zohaib Khan, Agha Ali Raza, Awais Athar

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T12:22:47Z

**Summary**: This paper presents an analysis of biases in open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) across various genders, religions, and races. We introduce a methodology for generating a bias detection dataset using seven bias triggers: General Debate, Positioned Debate, Career Advice, Story Generation, Problem-Solving, Cover-Letter Writing, and CV Generation. We use GPT-4o to generate a diverse set of prompts for each trigger across various genders, religious and racial groups. We evaluate models from Llama and Gemma family on the generated dataset. We anonymise the LLM-generated text associated with each group using GPT-4o-mini and do a pairwise comparison using GPT-4o-as-a-Judge. To quantify bias in the LLM-generated text we use the number of wins and losses in the pairwise comparison. Our analysis spans three languages, English, German, and Arabic to explore how language influences bias manifestation. Our findings reveal that LLMs exhibit strong polarization toward certain groups across each category, with a notable consistency observed across models. However, when switching languages, variations and anomalies emerge, often attributable to cultural cues and contextual differences.

### Benchmarking LLMs for Translating Classical Chinese Poetry:Evaluating   Adequacy, Fluency, and Elegance
**Authors**: Andong Chen, Lianzhang Lou, Kehai Chen, Xuefeng Bai, Yang Xiang, Muyun Yang, Tiejun Zhao, Min Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-10-17T02:17:57Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in translation tasks. However, the increasing demand for high-quality translations that are not only adequate but also fluent and elegant. To evaluate the extent to which current LLMs can meet these demands, we introduce a suitable benchmark (PoetMT) for translating classical Chinese poetry into English. This task requires not only adequacy in translating culturally and historically significant content but also a strict adherence to linguistic fluency and poetic elegance. To overcome the limitations of traditional evaluation metrics, we propose an automatic evaluation metric based on GPT-4, which better evaluates translation quality in terms of adequacy, fluency, and elegance. Our evaluation study reveals that existing large language models fall short in this task. To evaluate these issues, we propose RAT, a Retrieval-Augmented machine Translation method that enhances the translation process by incorporating knowledge related to classical poetry. Our dataset and code will be made available.

### The Fellowship of the LLMs: Multi-Agent Workflows for Synthetic   Preference Optimization Dataset Generation
**Authors**: Samee Arif, Sualeha Farid, Abdul Hameed Azeemi, Awais Athar, Agha Ali Raza

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T12:15:19Z

**Summary**: This paper presents a novel methodology for generating synthetic Preference Optimization (PO) datasets using multi-agent workflows. We evaluate the effectiveness and potential of these workflows in automating and enhancing the dataset generation process. PO dataset generation requires two modules: (1) response evaluation, and (2) response generation. In the response evaluation module, the responses from Large Language Models (LLMs) are evaluated and ranked - a task typically carried out by human annotators that we automate using LLMs. We assess the response evaluation module in a 2 step process. In step 1, we assess LLMs as evaluators using three distinct prompting strategies. In step 2, we apply the winning prompting strategy to compare the performance of LLM-as-a-Judge, LLMs-as-a-Jury, and LLM Debate. Our evaluation shows that GPT-4o-as-a-Judge is more consistent across all datasets. For the response generation module, we use the identified LLM evaluator configuration and compare different configurations of the LLM Feedback Loop. We use the win rate to determine the best multi-agent configuration for generation. Experimenting with various configurations, we find that the LLM Feedback Loop, with Llama as the generator and Gemma as the reviewer, achieves a notable 71.8% and 73.8% win rate over single-agent Llama and Gemma, respectively. After identifying the best configurations for both modules, we generate our PO datasets using the above pipeline.

### End-to-end Planner Training for Language Modeling
**Authors**: Nathan Cornille, Florian Mai, Jingyuan Sun, Marie-Francine Moens

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T12:14:29Z

**Summary**: Through end-to-end training to predict the next token, LLMs have become valuable tools for various tasks. Enhancing their core training in language modeling can improve numerous downstream applications. A successful approach to enhance language modeling uses a separate planning module to predict abstract labels of future sentences and conditions the LM on these predictions. However, this method is non-differentiable, preventing joint end-to-end tuning of the planner with the LM. We propose an effective method to improve this approach by enabling joint fine-tuning of the planner and the LM. We show that a naive way of approximating the gradient of selecting a label via the straight-through estimator is not effective. Instead, we propose to use the predicted label probabilities as mixing weights to condition the LM on a weighted average of label embeddings in a differentiable manner. This not only enables joint fine-tuning of the planner and the LM, but also allows the LM to draw on the full label distribution predicted by the planner, retaining more information. Our experimental results show consistent improvements in perplexity.

### Insights from the Inverse: Reconstructing LLM Training Goals Through   Inverse RL
**Authors**: Jared Joselowitz, Arjun Jagota, Satyapriya Krishna, Sonali Parbhoo

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T12:14:25Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) trained with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, but their underlying reward functions and decision-making processes remain opaque. This paper introduces a novel approach to interpreting LLMs by applying inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) to recover their implicit reward functions. We conduct experiments on toxicity-aligned LLMs of varying sizes, extracting reward models that achieve up to 80.40% accuracy in predicting human preferences. Our analysis reveals key insights into the non-identifiability of reward functions, the relationship between model size and interpretability, and potential pitfalls in the RLHF process. We demonstrate that IRL-derived reward models can be used to fine-tune new LLMs, resulting in comparable or improved performance on toxicity benchmarks. This work provides a new lens for understanding and improving LLM alignment, with implications for the responsible development and deployment of these powerful systems.

### SAC-GLAM: Improving Online RL for LLM agents with Soft Actor-Critic and   Hindsight Relabeling
**Authors**: Loris Gaven, Clement Romac, Thomas Carta, Sylvain Lamprier, Olivier Sigaud, Pierre-Yves Oudeyer

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T11:59:27Z

**Summary**: The past years have seen Large Language Models (LLMs) strive not only as generative models but also as agents solving textual sequential decision-making tasks. When facing complex environments where their zero-shot abilities are insufficient, recent work showed online Reinforcement Learning (RL) could be used for the LLM agent to discover and learn efficient strategies interactively. However, most prior work sticks to on-policy algorithms, which greatly reduces the scope of methods such agents could use for both exploration and exploitation, such as experience replay and hindsight relabeling. Yet, such methods may be key for LLM learning agents, and in particular when designing autonomous intrinsically motivated agents sampling and pursuing their own goals (i.e. autotelic agents). This paper presents and studies an adaptation of Soft Actor-Critic and hindsight relabeling to LLM agents. Our method not only paves the path towards autotelic LLM agents that learn online but can also outperform on-policy methods in more classic multi-goal RL environments.

### KcMF: A Knowledge-compliant Framework for Schema and Entity Matching   with Fine-tuning-free LLMs
**Authors**: Yongqin Xu, Huan Li, Ke Chen, Lidan Shou

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T11:50:02Z

**Summary**: Schema and entity matching tasks are crucial for data integration and management. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promising results in these tasks, they suffer from hallucinations and confusion about task instructions. In this paper, we present the Knowledge-Compliant Matching Framework (KcMF), an LLM-based approach that addresses these issues without the need for domain-specific fine-tuning. KcMF employs a pseudo-code-based task decomposition strategy to adopt task-specific natural language statements that guide LLM reasoning and reduce confusion. We also propose two mechanisms, Dataset as Knowledge (DaK) and Example as Knowledge (EaK), to build domain knowledge sets when unstructured domain knowledge is lacking. Additionally, we introduce a result-ensembling strategy to leverage multiple knowledge sources and suppress poorly formatted outputs. Comprehensive evaluations on schema and entity matching tasks demonstrate that KcMF outperforms previous non-LLM state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods by an average F1 score of 22.9% and competes effectively with SOTA fine-tuned LLMs. Moreover, KcMF generalizes well across different LLMs.

### Beyond Instruction Following: Evaluating Inferential Rule Following of   Large Language Models
**Authors**: Wangtao Sun, Chenxiang Zhang, XueYou Zhang, Xuanqing Yu, Ziyang Huang, Pei Chen, Haotian Xu, Shizhu He, Jun Zhao, Kang Liu

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T11:49:48Z

**Summary**: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong ability, they are further supposed to be controlled and guided by in real-world scenarios to be safe, accurate, and intelligent. This demands the possession of capability of LLMs. However, no prior work has made a clear evaluation of the inferential rule-following capability of LLMs. Previous studies that try to evaluate the inferential rule-following capability of LLMs fail to distinguish the inferential rule-following scenarios from the instruction-following scenarios. Therefore, this paper first clarifies the concept of inferential rule-following and proposes a comprehensive benchmark, RuleBench, to evaluate a diversified range of inferential rule-following abilities. Our experimental results on a variety of LLMs show that they are still limited in following rules. Our analysis based on the evaluation results provides insights into the improvements for LLMs toward a better inferential rule-following intelligent agent. We further propose Inferential Rule-Following Tuning (IRFT). The experimental results show that through IRFT, LLMs can learn abstract rule-following abilities from purely synthetic data and then generalize to RuleBench. The data and code can be found at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/llm-rule-following-B3E3/

### MlingConf: A Comprehensive Study of Multilingual Confidence Estimation   on Large Language Models
**Authors**: Boyang Xue, Hongru Wang, Rui Wang, Sheng Wang, Zezhong Wang, Yiming Du, Bin Liang, Kam-Fai Wong

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T11:46:55Z

**Summary**: The tendency of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate hallucinations raises concerns regarding their reliability. Therefore, confidence estimations indicating the extent of trustworthiness of the generations become essential. However, current LLM confidence estimations in languages other than English remain underexplored. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a comprehensive investigation of Multilingual Confidence estimation (MlingConf) on LLMs, focusing on both language-agnostic (LA) and language-specific (LS) tasks to explore the performance and language dominance effects of multilingual confidence estimations on different tasks. The benchmark comprises four meticulously checked and human-evaluate high-quality multilingual datasets for LA tasks and one for the LS task tailored to specific social, cultural, and geographical contexts of a language. Our experiments reveal that on LA tasks English exhibits notable linguistic dominance in confidence estimations than other languages, while on LS tasks, using question-related language to prompt LLMs demonstrates better linguistic dominance in multilingual confidence estimations. The phenomena inspire a simple yet effective native-tone prompting strategy by employing language-specific prompts for LS tasks, effectively improving LLMs' reliability and accuracy on LS tasks.

### Retrieval-Reasoning Large Language Model-based Synthetic Clinical Trial   Generation
**Authors**: Zerui Xu, Fang Wu, Tianfan Fu, Yue Zhao

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T11:46:32Z

**Summary**: Machine learning (ML) exhibits promise in the clinical domain. However, it is constrained by data scarcity and ethical considerations, as the generation of clinical trials presents significant challenges due to stringent privacy regulations, high costs, and the extended duration required for conducting studies with human participants. Despite the advancements of large language models (LLMs) in general generation tasks, their potential in facilitating the generation of synthetic clinical trials is under-explored. To address this gap, we introduce a novel Retrieval-Reasoning few-shot framework that leverages LLMs to generate artificial yet realistic and diverse clinical trials with binary success/failure labels. Experiments conducted on real clinical trials from the \url{ClinicalTrials.gov} database demonstrate that our synthetic data can effectively augment real datasets. Furthermore, by fine-tuning a pre-trained model as a binary classifier on synthetic clinical trial datasets, we demonstrate that this augmentation enhances model training for downstream tasks such as trial outcome prediction. Our findings suggest that LLMs for synthetic clinical trial generation hold promise for accelerating clinical research and upholding ethical standards for patient privacy. The code is publicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Retrieval_Reasoning_Clinical_Trial_Generation-3EC4.

### Learning to Predict Usage Options of Product Reviews with LLM-Generated   Labels
**Authors**: Leo Kohlenberg, Leonard Horns, Frederic Sadrieh, Nils Kiele, Matthis Clausen, Konstantin Ketterer, Avetis Navasardyan, Tamara Czinczoll, Gerard de Melo, Ralf Herbrich

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T11:34:33Z

**Summary**: Annotating large datasets can be challenging. However, crowd-sourcing is often expensive and can lack quality, especially for non-trivial tasks. We propose a method of using LLMs as few-shot learners for annotating data in a complex natural language task where we learn a standalone model to predict usage options for products from customer reviews. We also propose a new evaluation metric for this scenario, HAMS4, that can be used to compare a set of strings with multiple reference sets. Learning a custom model offers individual control over energy efficiency and privacy measures compared to using the LLM directly for the sequence-to-sequence task. We compare this data annotation approach with other traditional methods and demonstrate how LLMs can enable considerable cost savings. We find that the quality of the resulting data exceeds the level attained by third-party vendor services and that GPT-4-generated labels even reach the level of domain experts. We make the code and generated labels publicly available.

### Evaluating Software Development Agents: Patch Patterns, Code Quality,   and Issue Complexity in Real-World GitHub Scenarios
**Authors**: Zhi Chen, Lingxiao Jiang

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T11:33:57Z

**Summary**: In recent years, AI-based software engineering has progressed from pre-trained models to advanced agentic workflows, with Software Development Agents representing the next major leap. These agents, capable of reasoning, planning, and interacting with external environments, offer promising solutions to complex software engineering tasks. However, while much research has evaluated code generated by large language models (LLMs), comprehensive studies on agent-generated patches, particularly in real-world settings, are lacking. This study addresses that gap by evaluating 4,892 patches from 10 top-ranked agents on 500 real-world GitHub issues from SWE-Bench Verified, focusing on their impact on code quality. Our analysis shows no single agent dominated, with 170 issues unresolved, indicating room for improvement. Even for patches that passed unit tests and resolved issues, agents made different file and function modifications compared to the gold patches from repository developers, revealing limitations in the benchmark's test case coverage. Most agents maintained code reliability and security, avoiding new bugs or vulnerabilities; while some agents increased code complexity, many reduced code duplication and minimized code smells. Finally, agents performed better on simpler codebases, suggesting that breaking complex tasks into smaller sub-tasks could improve effectiveness. This study provides the first comprehensive evaluation of agent-generated patches on real-world GitHub issues, offering insights to advance AI-driven software development.

### Optimizing the low-latency localization of gravitational waves
**Authors**: Pierre-Alexandre Duverne, Stéphanie Hoang, Tito Dal Canton, Sarah Antier, Nicolas Arnaud, Patrice Hello, Francesco Pannarale

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T11:25:22Z

**Summary**: Gravitational-wave data from interferometric detectors like LIGO, Virgo and KAGRA is routinely analyzed by rapid matched-filtering algorithms to detect compact binary merger events and rapidly infer their spatial position, which enables the discovery of associated non-GW transients like GRB 170817A and AT2017gfo. One of the critical requirements for finding such counterparts is that the rapidly inferred sky location, usually performed by the Bayestar algorithm, is correct. The reliability of this data product relies on various assumptions and a tuning parameter in Bayestar, which we investigate in this paper in the context of PyCBC Live, one of the rapid search algorithms used by LIGO, Virgo and KAGRA. We perform simulations of compact binary coalescence signals recovered by PyCBC Live and localized by Bayestar, under various configurations with different balances between simplicity and realism, and we test the resulting sky localizations for consistency based on the widely-used PP plot. We identify some aspects of the search configuration which drive the optimal setting of Bayestar's tuning parameter, in particular the properties of the template bank used for matched filtering. On the other hand, we find that this parameter does not depend strongly on the nonstationary and non-Gaussian properties of the detector noise.

### Enhancing LLM Trading Performance with Fact-Subjectivity Aware Reasoning
**Authors**: Qian Wang, Yuchen Gao, Zhenheng Tang, Bingqiao Luo, Bingsheng He

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T11:25:13Z

**Summary**: While many studies prove more advanced LLMs perform better on tasks such as math and trading, we notice that in cryptocurrency trading, stronger LLMs work worse than weaker LLMs often. To study how this counter-intuitive phenomenon occurs, we examine the LLM reasoning processes on making trading decisions. We find that separating the reasoning process into factual and subjective components can lead to higher profits. Building on this insight, we introduce a multi-agent framework, FS-ReasoningAgent, which enables LLMs to recognize and learn from both factual and subjective reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this framework enhances LLM trading performance in cryptocurrency markets. Additionally, an ablation study reveals that relying on subjective news tends to generate higher returns in bull markets, whereas focusing on factual information yields better results in bear markets. Our code and data are available at \url{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/FS-ReasoningAgent-B55F/}.

### Bridging the Language Gaps in Large Language Models with Inference-Time   Cross-Lingual Intervention
**Authors**: Weixuan Wang, Minghao Wu, Barry Haddow, Alexandra Birch

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T11:23:03Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in natural language processing but exhibit significant performance gaps among different languages. Most existing approaches to address these disparities rely on pretraining or fine-tuning, which are resource-intensive. To overcome these limitations without incurring significant costs, we propose Inference-Time Cross-Lingual Intervention (INCLINE), a novel framework that enhances LLM performance on low-performing (source) languages by aligning their internal representations with those of high-performing (target) languages during inference. INCLINE initially learns alignment matrices using parallel sentences from source and target languages through a Least-Squares optimization, and then applies these matrices during inference to transform the low-performing language representations toward the high-performing language space. Extensive experiments on nine benchmarks with five LLMs demonstrate that INCLINE significantly improves performance across diverse tasks and languages, compared to recent strong baselines. Our analysis demonstrates that INCLINE is highly cost-effective and applicable to a wide range of applications. In addition, we release the code to foster research along this line: https://github.com/weixuan-wang123/INCLINE.

### The Best of Both Worlds: Bridging Quality and Diversity in Data   Selection with Bipartite Graph
**Authors**: Minghao Wu, Thuy-Trang Vu, Lizhen Qu, Gholamreza Haffari

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T11:16:34Z

**Summary**: The performance of large language models (LLMs) in natural language processing (NLP) tasks is significantly influenced by the quality and diversity of data used for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Current data selection methods often focus solely on quality or diversity, leading to underperforming models due to suboptimal training data. In this paper, we introduce GraphFilter, a novel method that represents the dataset as a bipartite graph, linking sentences to their constituent n-grams. This representation effectively captures the relationships between sentences and linguistic patterns, facilitating the selection of sentences that enhance n-gram diversity. To balance quality and diversity during selection, we propose a priority function that combines the quality metric with the diversity metric in a multiplicative manner. GraphFilter iteratively selects high-priority sentences, updates the bipartite graph by removing covered n-grams, and re-calculates priorities to reflect the evolving data landscape. We conduct extensive experiments using three model backbones across six widely used benchmarks. The results demonstrate that GraphFilter outperforms all nine baseline approaches, achieving superior model performance and computational efficiency. Our analyses validate the effectiveness of our design choices, examine the subsets selected by GraphFilter and other methods, highlight the importance of instruction diversity, and explore the role of quality and diversity in relation to subset sizes. GraphFilter establishes a new foundation for effective data selection strategies, encouraging further research in data selection for LLMs.

### Mitigating Dual Latent Confounding Biases in Recommender Systems
**Authors**: Jianfeng Deng, Qingfeng Chen, Debo Cheng, Jiuyong Li, Lin Liu, Xiaojing Du

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T10:58:53Z

**Summary**: Recommender systems are extensively utilised across various areas to predict user preferences for personalised experiences and enhanced user engagement and satisfaction. Traditional recommender systems, however, are complicated by confounding bias, particularly in the presence of latent confounders that affect both item exposure and user feedback. Existing debiasing methods often fail to capture the complex interactions caused by latent confounders in interaction data, especially when dual latent confounders affect both the user and item sides. To address this, we propose a novel debiasing method that jointly integrates the Instrumental Variables (IV) approach and identifiable Variational Auto-Encoder (iVAE) for Debiased representation learning in Recommendation systems, referred to as IViDR. Specifically, IViDR leverages the embeddings of user features as IVs to address confounding bias caused by latent confounders between items and user feedback, and reconstructs the embedding of items to obtain debiased interaction data. Moreover, IViDR employs an Identifiable Variational Auto-Encoder (iVAE) to infer identifiable representations of latent confounders between item exposure and user feedback from both the original and debiased interaction data. Additionally, we provide theoretical analyses of the soundness of using IV and the identifiability of the latent representations. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that IViDR outperforms state-of-the-art models in reducing bias and providing reliable recommendations.

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T10:56:24Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made tremendous strides in code generation, but existing research fails to account for the dynamic nature of software development, marked by frequent library updates. This gap significantly limits LLMs' deployment in realistic settings. In this paper, we propose two novel tasks aimed at bridging this gap: version-specific code completion (VSCC) and version-aware code migration (VACM). In conjunction, we introduce VersiCode, a comprehensive Python dataset specifically designed to evaluate LLMs on these two tasks, together with a novel evaluation metric, Critical Diff Check (CDC@1), which assesses code generation against evolving API requirements. We conduct an extensive evaluation on VersiCode, which reveals that version-controllable code generation is indeed a significant challenge, even for GPT-4o and other strong frontier models. We believe the novel tasks, dataset, and metric open up a new, important research direction that will further enhance LLMs' real-world applicability. The code and resources can be found at https://github.com/wutong8023/VersiCode.

### Open Ko-LLM Leaderboard2: Bridging Foundational and Practical Evaluation   for Korean LLMs
**Authors**: Hyeonwoo Kim, Dahyun Kim, Jihoo Kim, Sukyung Lee, Yungi Kim, Chanjun Park

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T10:49:22Z

**Summary**: The Open Ko-LLM Leaderboard has been instrumental in benchmarking Korean Large Language Models (LLMs), yet it has certain limitations. Notably, the disconnect between quantitative improvements on the overly academic leaderboard benchmarks and the qualitative impact of the models should be addressed. Furthermore, the benchmark suite is largely composed of translated versions of their English counterparts, which may not fully capture the intricacies of the Korean language. To address these issues, we propose Open Ko-LLM Leaderboard2, an improved version of the earlier Open Ko-LLM Leaderboard. The original benchmarks are entirely replaced with new tasks that are more closely aligned with real-world capabilities. Additionally, four new native Korean benchmarks are introduced to better reflect the distinct characteristics of the Korean language. Through these refinements, Open Ko-LLM Leaderboard2 seeks to provide a more meaningful evaluation for advancing Korean LLMs.

### Properties and maximum likelihood estimation of the gamma-normal and   related probability distributions
**Authors**: Massimiliano Bonamente, Dale Zimmerman

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T10:48:22Z

**Summary**: This paper presents likelihood-based inference methods for the family of univariate gamma-normal distributions GN({\alpha}, r, {\mu}, {\sigma}^2 ) that result from summing independent gamma({\alpha}, r) and N({\mu}, {\sigma}^2 ) random variables. First, the probability density function of a gamma-normal variable is provided in compact form with the use of parabolic cylinder functions, along with key properties. We then provide analytic expressions for the maximum-likelihood score equations and the Fisher information matrix, and discuss inferential methods for the gamma-normal distribution. Given the widespread use of the two constituting distributions, the gamma-normal distribution is a general purpose tool for a variety of applications. In particular, we discuss two distributions that are obtained as special cases and that are featured in a variety of statistical applications: the exponential-normal distribution and the chi-squared-normal (or overdispersed chi-squared) distribution.

### Expanding Chatbot Knowledge in Customer Service: Context-Aware Similar   Question Generation Using Large Language Models
**Authors**: Mengze Hong, Yuanfeng Song, Di Jiang, Lu Wang, Zichang Guo, Chen Jason Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T10:48:14Z

**Summary**: Reliable responses of service chatbots are often achieved by employing retrieval-based methods that restrict answers to a knowledge base comprising predefined question-answer pairs (QA pairs). To accommodate potential variations in how a customer's query may be expressed, it emerges as the favored solution to augment these QA pairs with similar questions that are possibly diverse while remaining semantic consistency. This augmentation task is known as Similar Question Generation (SQG). Traditional methods that heavily rely on human efforts or rule-based techniques suffer from limited diversity or significant semantic deviation from the source question, only capable of producing a finite number of useful questions.   To address these limitations, we propose an SQG approach based on Large Language Models (LLMs), capable of producing a substantial number of diverse questions while maintaining semantic consistency to the source QA pair. This is achieved by leveraging LLMs' natural language understanding capability through fine-tuning with specially designed prompts. The experiments conducted on a real customer-service dataset demonstrate that our method surpasses baseline methods by a significant margin in terms of semantic diversity. Human evaluation further confirms that integrating the answer that reflects the customer's intention is crucial for increasing the number of generated questions that meet business requirements.

### Reconstruction of Differentially Private Text Sanitization via Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Shuchao Pang, Zhigang Lu, Haichen Wang, Peng Fu, Yongbin Zhou, Minhui Xue, Bo Li

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T10:41:17Z

**Summary**: Differential privacy (DP) is the de facto privacy standard against privacy leakage attacks, including many recently discovered ones against large language models (LLMs). However, we discovered that LLMs could reconstruct the altered/removed privacy from given DP-sanitized prompts. We propose two attacks (black-box and white-box) based on the accessibility to LLMs and show that LLMs could connect the pair of DP-sanitized text and the corresponding private training data of LLMs by giving sample text pairs as instructions (in the black-box attacks) or fine-tuning data (in the white-box attacks). To illustrate our findings, we conduct comprehensive experiments on modern LLMs (e.g., LLaMA-2, LLaMA-3, ChatGPT-3.5, ChatGPT-4, ChatGPT-4o, Claude-3, Claude-3.5, OPT, GPT-Neo, GPT-J, Gemma-2, and Pythia) using commonly used datasets (such as WikiMIA, Pile-CC, and Pile-Wiki) against both word-level and sentence-level DP. The experimental results show promising recovery rates, e.g., the black-box attacks against the word-level DP over WikiMIA dataset gave 72.18% on LLaMA-2 (70B), 82.39% on LLaMA-3 (70B), 75.35% on Gemma-2, 91.2% on ChatGPT-4o, and 94.01% on Claude-3.5 (Sonnet). More urgently, this study indicates that these well-known LLMs have emerged as a new security risk for existing DP text sanitization approaches in the current environment.

### Revisiting Benchmark and Assessment: An Agent-based Exploratory Dynamic   Evaluation Framework for LLMs
**Authors**: Wanying Wang, Zeyu Ma, Pengfei Liu, Mingang Chen

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T10:36:18Z

**Summary**: While various vertical domain large language models (LLMs) have been developed, the challenge of automatically evaluating their performance across different domains remains significant. Current benchmark-based evaluation methods exhibit rigid, aimless interactions and rely on pre-collected static datasets that are costly to build, inflexible across domains, and misaligned with practical user needs. To address this issue, we revisit the evaluation components and introduce two concepts: Benchmark+, which extends traditional question-answer benchmark into a more flexible "strategy-criterion" format; and Assessment+, which enhances the interaction process, enabling deeper exploration and supporting both quantitative metrics and qualitative insights. These concepts capture the nuanced behaviors of LLMs through richer, multi-turn interactions. We propose an agent-based evaluation framework called TestAgent, which implements these concepts through retrieval augmented generation and reinforcement learning. Experiments on tasks ranging from constructing vertical domain evaluation to activating existing benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of TestAgent across various scenarios. We believe this work offers an interesting perspective on automatic evaluation for LLMs.

### On Large Uni- and Multi-modal Models for Unsupervised Classification of   Social Media Images: Nature's Contribution to People as a case study
**Authors**: Rohaifa Khaldi, Domingo Alcaraz-Segura, Ignacio Sánchez-Herrera, Javier Martinez-Lopez, Carlos Javier Navarro, Siham Tabik

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T10:27:14Z

**Summary**: Social media images have proven to be a valuable source of information for understanding human interactions with important subjects such as cultural heritage, biodiversity, and nature, among others. The task of grouping such images into a number of semantically meaningful clusters without labels is challenging due to the high diversity and complex nature of the visual content in addition to their large volume. On the other hand, recent advances in Large Visual Models (LVMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) provide an important opportunity to explore new productive and scalable solutions. This work proposes, analyzes, and compares various approaches based on one or more state-of-the-art LVM, LLM, and LVLM, for mapping social media images into a number of predefined classes. As a case study, we consider the problem of understanding the interactions between humans and nature, also known as Nature's Contribution to People or Cultural Ecosystem Services (CES). Our experiments show that the highest-performing approaches, with accuracy above 95%, still require the creation of a small labeled dataset. These include the fine-tuned LVM DINOv2 and the LVLM LLaVA-1.5 combined with a fine-tuned LLM. The top fully unsupervised approaches, achieving accuracy above 84%, are the LVLMs, specifically the proprietary GPT-4 model and the public LLaVA-1.5 model. Additionally, the LVM DINOv2, when applied in a 10-shot learning setup, delivered competitive results with an accuracy of 83.99%, closely matching the performance of the LVLM LLaVA-1.5.

### LoraMap: Harnessing the Power of LoRA Connections
**Authors**: Hyeryun Park, Jeongwon Kwak, Dongsuk Jang, Sumin Park, Jinwook Choi

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T10:19:45Z

**Summary**: Fact-checking techniques can mitigate hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs), a prominent issue in specialized domains. As parameter-efficient techniques such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) can overcome substantial computational overhead, some studies have explored the integration of multiple LoRAs. While previous studies focus on parallel integration, this paper investigates methods to establish connections among multiple LoRAs. We create three reasoning datasets tailored to fact-checking and fine-tune individual LoRAs, allowing them to view and reason from diverse perspectives. Then, we explore strategies for allocating these reasoning LoRAs and introduce LoraMap, an approach to map connections between them. The results of the fact-checking task demonstrate that the performance of LoraMap is superior to LoraHub, an existing method for integrating LoRAs. LoraMap also outperforms with significantly fewer trainable parameters than LoraConcat, which concatenates LoRAs and further fine-tunes them.

### Conformity in Large Language Models
**Authors**: Xiaochen Zhu, Caiqi Zhang, Tom Stafford, Nigel Collier, Andreas Vlachos

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T10:16:34Z

**Summary**: The conformity effect describes the tendency of individuals to align their responses with the majority. Studying this bias in large language models (LLMs) is crucial, as LLMs are increasingly used in various information-seeking and decision-making tasks as conversation partners to improve productivity. Thus, conformity to incorrect responses can compromise their effectiveness. In this paper, we adapt psychological experiments to examine the extent of conformity in state-of-the-art LLMs. Our findings reveal that all models tested exhibit varying levels of conformity toward the majority, regardless of their initial choice or correctness, across different knowledge domains. Notably, we are the first to show that LLMs are more likely to conform when they are more uncertain in their own prediction. We further explore factors that influence conformity, such as training paradigms and input characteristics, finding that instruction-tuned models are less susceptible to conformity, while increasing the naturalness of majority tones amplifies conformity. Finally, we propose two interventions--Devil's Advocate and Question Distillation--to mitigate conformity, providing insights into building more robust language models.

### Mental Disorders Detection in the Era of Large Language Models
**Authors**: Gleb Kuzmin, Petr Strepetov, Maksim Stankevich, Artem Shelmanov, Ivan Smirnov

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T10:14:54Z

**Summary**: This paper compares the effectiveness of traditional machine learning methods, encoder-based models, and large language models (LLMs) on the task of detecting depression and anxiety. Five datasets were considered, each differing in format and the method used to define the target pathology class. We tested AutoML models based on linguistic features, several variations of encoder-based Transformers such as BERT, and state-of-the-art LLMs as pathology classification models. The results demonstrated that LLMs outperform traditional methods, particularly on noisy and small datasets where training examples vary significantly in text length and genre. However, psycholinguistic features and encoder-based models can achieve performance comparable to language models when trained on texts from individuals with clinically confirmed depression, highlighting their potential effectiveness in targeted clinical applications.

 ### Meta-Chunking: Learning Efficient Text Segmentation via Logical   Perception
**Authors**: Jihao Zhao, Zhiyuan Ji, Pengnian Qi, Simin Niu, Bo Tang, Feiyu Xiong, Zhiyu Li

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T17:59:32Z

**Summary**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), while serving as a viable complement to large language models (LLMs), often overlooks the crucial aspect of text chunking within its pipeline, which impacts the quality of knowledge-intensive tasks. This paper introduces the concept of Meta-Chunking, which refers to a granularity between sentences and paragraphs, consisting of a collection of sentences within a paragraph that have deep linguistic logical connections. To implement Meta-Chunking, we designed two strategies based on LLMs: Margin Sampling Chunking and Perplexity Chunking. The former employs LLMs to perform binary classification on whether consecutive sentences need to be segmented, making decisions based on the probability difference obtained from margin sampling. The latter precisely identifies text chunk boundaries by analyzing the characteristics of perplexity distribution. Additionally, considering the inherent complexity of different texts, we propose a strategy that combines Meta-Chunking with dynamic merging to achieve a balance between fine-grained and coarse-grained text chunking. Experiments conducted on eleven datasets demonstrate that Meta-Chunking can more efficiently improve the performance of single-hop and multi-hop question answering based on RAG. For instance, on the 2WikiMultihopQA dataset, it outperforms similarity chunking by 1.32 while only consuming 45.8% of the time. Our code is available at https://github.com/IAAR-Shanghai/Meta-Chunking.

### JudgeBench: A Benchmark for Evaluating LLM-based Judges
**Authors**: Sijun Tan, Siyuan Zhuang, Kyle Montgomery, William Y. Tang, Alejandro Cuadron, Chenguang Wang, Raluca Ada Popa, Ion Stoica

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T17:58:19Z

**Summary**: LLM-based judges have emerged as a scalable alternative to human evaluation and are increasingly used to assess, compare, and improve models. However, the reliability of LLM-based judges themselves is rarely scrutinized. As LLMs become more advanced, their responses grow more sophisticated, requiring stronger judges to evaluate them. Existing benchmarks primarily focus on a judge's alignment with human preferences, but often fail to account for more challenging tasks where crowdsourced human preference is a poor indicator of factual and logical correctness. To address this, we propose a novel evaluation framework to objectively evaluate LLM-based judges. Based on this framework, we propose JudgeBench, a benchmark for evaluating LLM-based judges on challenging response pairs spanning knowledge, reasoning, math, and coding. JudgeBench leverages a novel pipeline for converting existing difficult datasets into challenging response pairs with preference labels reflecting objective correctness. Our comprehensive evaluation on a collection of prompted judges, fine-tuned judges, multi-agent judges, and reward models shows that JudgeBench poses a significantly greater challenge than previous benchmarks, with many strong models (e.g., GPT-4o) performing just slightly better than random guessing. Overall, JudgeBench offers a reliable platform for assessing increasingly advanced LLM-based judges. Data and code are available at https://github.com/ScalerLab/JudgeBench .

### LLM2Swarm: Robot Swarms that Responsively Reason, Plan, and Collaborate   through LLMs
**Authors**: Volker Strobel, Marco Dorigo, Mario Fritz

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T17:57:02Z

**Summary**: Robot swarms are composed of many simple robots that communicate and collaborate to fulfill complex tasks. Robot controllers usually need to be specified by experts on a case-by-case basis via programming code. This process is time-consuming, prone to errors, and unable to take into account all situations that may be encountered during deployment. On the other hand, recent Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated reasoning and planning capabilities, introduced new ways to interact with and program machines, and incorporate both domain-specific and commonsense knowledge. Hence, we propose to address the aforementioned challenges by integrating LLMs with robot swarms and show the potential in proofs of concept (showcases). For this integration, we explore two approaches. The first approach is 'indirect integration,' where LLMs are used to synthesize and validate the robot controllers. This approach may reduce development time and human error before deployment. Moreover, during deployment, it could be used for on-the-fly creation of new robot behaviors. The second approach is 'direct integration,' where each robot locally executes a separate LLM instance during deployment for robot-robot collaboration and human-swarm interaction. These local LLM instances enable each robot to reason, plan, and collaborate using natural language, as demonstrated in our showcases where the robots are able to detect a variety of anomalies, without prior information about the nature of these anomalies. To enable further research on our mainly conceptual contribution, we release the software and videos for our LLM2Swarm system: https://github.com/Pold87/LLM2Swarm.

### In-Context Learning Enables Robot Action Prediction in LLMs
**Authors**: Yida Yin, Zekai Wang, Yuvan Sharma, Dantong Niu, Trevor Darrell, Roei Herzig

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T17:56:49Z

**Summary**: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success using in-context learning (ICL) in the language domain. However, leveraging the ICL capabilities within LLMs to directly predict robot actions remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce RoboPrompt, a framework that enables off-the-shelf text-only LLMs to directly predict robot actions through ICL without training. Our approach first heuristically identifies keyframes that capture important moments from an episode. Next, we extract end-effector actions from these keyframes as well as the estimated initial object poses, and both are converted into textual descriptions. Finally, we construct a structured template to form ICL demonstrations from these textual descriptions and a task instruction. This enables an LLM to directly predict robot actions at test time. Through extensive experiments and analysis, RoboPrompt shows stronger performance over zero-shot and ICL baselines in simulated and real-world settings.

### BIRD: A Trustworthy Bayesian Inference Framework for Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Yu Feng, Ben Zhou, Weidong Lin, Dan Roth

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T17:45:10Z

**Summary**: Predictive models often need to work with incomplete information in real-world tasks. Consequently, they must provide reliable probability or confidence estimation, especially in large-scale decision making and planning tasks. Current large language models (LLM) are insufficient for such accurate estimations, but they can generate relevant factors that may affect the probabilities, produce coarse-grained probabilities when the information is more complete, and help determine which factors are relevant to specific downstream contexts. In this paper, we make use of these capabilities of LLMs to provide a significantly more accurate probabilistic estimation. We propose BIRD, a novel probabilistic inference framework that aligns a Bayesian network with LLM abductions and then estimates more accurate probabilities in a deduction step. We show BIRD provides reliable probability estimations that are 30\% better than those provided directly by LLM baselines. These estimates can further contribute to better and more trustworthy decision-making.

### CREAM: Consistency Regularized Self-Rewarding Language Models
**Authors**: Zhaoyang Wang, Weilei He, Zhiyuan Liang, Xuchao Zhang, Chetan Bansal, Ying Wei, Weitong Zhang, Huaxiu Yao

**Updated**: 2024-10-17T02:47:35Z

**Summary**: Recent self-rewarding large language models (LLM) have successfully applied LLM-as-a-Judge to iteratively improve the alignment performance without the need of human annotations for preference data. These methods commonly utilize the same LLM to act as both the policy model (which generates responses) and the reward model (which scores and ranks those responses). The ranked responses are then used as preference pairs to train the LLM via direct alignment technologies (e.g. DPO). However, it is noteworthy that throughout this process, there is no guarantee of accuracy in the rewarding and ranking, which is critical for ensuring accurate rewards and high-quality preference data. Empirical results from relatively small LLMs (e.g., 7B parameters) also indicate that improvements from self-rewarding may diminish after several iterations in certain situations, which we hypothesize is due to accumulated bias in the reward system. This bias can lead to unreliable preference data for training the LLM. To address this issue, we first formulate and analyze the generalized iterative preference fine-tuning framework for self-rewarding language model. We then introduce the regularization to this generalized framework to mitigate the overconfident preference labeling in the self-rewarding process. Based on this theoretical insight, we propose a Consistency Regularized sElf-rewarding lAnguage Model (CREAM) that leverages the rewarding consistency across different iterations to regularize the self-rewarding training, helping the model to learn from more reliable preference data. With this explicit regularization, our empirical results demonstrate the superiority of CREAM in improving both reward consistency and alignment performance. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/Raibows/CREAM.

### SplitLLM: Collaborative Inference of LLMs for Model Placement and   Throughput Optimization
**Authors**: Akrit Mudvari, Yuang Jiang, Leandros Tassiulas

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T16:31:37Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have been a disruptive innovation in recent years, and they play a crucial role in our daily lives due to their ability to understand and generate human-like text. Their capabilities include natural language understanding, information retrieval and search, translation, chatbots, virtual assistance, and many more. However, it is well known that LLMs are massive in terms of the number of parameters. Additionally, the self-attention mechanism in the underlying architecture of LLMs, Transformers, has quadratic complexity in terms of both computation and memory with respect to the input sequence length. For these reasons, LLM inference is resource-intensive, and thus, the throughput of LLM inference is limited, especially for the longer sequences. In this report, we design a collaborative inference architecture between a server and its clients to alleviate the throughput limit. In this design, we consider the available resources on both sides, i.e., the computation and communication costs. We develop a dynamic programming-based algorithm to optimally allocate computation between the server and the client device to increase the server throughput, while not violating the service level agreement (SLA). We show in the experiments that we are able to efficiently distribute the workload allowing for roughly 1/3 reduction in the server workload, while achieving 19 percent improvement over a greedy method. As a result, we are able to demonstrate that, in an environment with different types of LLM inference requests, the throughput of the server is improved.

### FusionLLM: A Decentralized LLM Training System on Geo-distributed GPUs   with Adaptive Compression
**Authors**: Zhenheng Tang, Xueze Kang, Yiming Yin, Xinglin Pan, Yuxin Wang, Xin He, Qiang Wang, Rongfei Zeng, Kaiyong Zhao, Shaohuai Shi, Amelie Chi Zhou, Bo Li, Bingsheng He, Xiaowen Chu

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T16:13:19Z

**Summary**: To alleviate hardware scarcity in training large deep neural networks (DNNs), particularly large language models (LLMs), we present FusionLLM, a decentralized training system designed and implemented for training DNNs using geo-distributed GPUs across different computing clusters or individual devices. Decentralized training faces significant challenges regarding system design and efficiency, including: 1) the need for remote automatic differentiation (RAD), 2) support for flexible model definitions and heterogeneous software, 3) heterogeneous hardware leading to low resource utilization or the straggler problem, and 4) slow network communication. To address these challenges, in the system design, we represent the model as a directed acyclic graph of operators (OP-DAG). Each node in the DAG represents the operator in the DNNs, while the edge represents the data dependency between operators. Based on this design, 1) users are allowed to customize any DNN without caring low-level operator implementation; 2) we enable the task scheduling with the more fine-grained sub-tasks, offering more optimization space; 3) a DAG runtime executor can implement RAD withour requiring the consistent low-level ML framework versions.   To enhance system efficiency, we implement a workload estimator and design an OP-Fence scheduler to cluster devices with similar bandwidths together and partition the DAG to increase throughput. Additionally, we propose an AdaTopK compressor to adaptively compress intermediate activations and gradients at the slowest communication links. To evaluate the convergence and efficiency of our system and algorithms, we train ResNet-101 and GPT-2 on three real-world testbeds using 48 GPUs connected with 8 Mbps~10 Gbps networks. Experimental results demonstrate that our system and method can achieve 1.45 - 9.39x speedup compared to baseline methods while ensuring convergence.

**Authors**: Matteo Stoisa, Federica Paganelli Azza, Luca Romanelli, Mattia Varile

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T16:05:46Z

**Summary**: Autonomous Rendezvous and Docking (RVD) have been extensively studied in recent years, addressing the stringent requirements of spacecraft dynamics variations and the limitations of GNC systems. This paper presents an innovative approach employing Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) trained through Reinforcement Learning (RL) for autonomous spacecraft guidance and control during the final phase of the rendezvous maneuver. The proposed strategy is easily implementable onboard and offers fast adaptability and robustness to disturbances by learning control policies from experience rather than relying on predefined models. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations within a relevant environment are conducted in 6DoF settings to validate our approach, along with hardware tests that demonstrate deployment feasibility. Our findings highlight the efficacy of RL in assuring the adaptability and efficiency of spacecraft RVD, offering insights into future mission expectations.

### QPUF 2.0: Exploring Quantum Physical Unclonable Functions for   Security-by-Design of Energy Cyber-Physical Systems
**Authors**: Venkata K. V. V. Bathalapalli, Saraju P. Mohanty, Chenyun Pan, Elias Kougianos

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T16:04:45Z

**Summary**: Sustainable advancement is being made to improve the efficiency of the generation, transmission, and distribution of renewable energy resources, as well as managing them to ensure the reliable operation of the smart grid. Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) enables sustainable management of grid communication flow through its real-time data sensing, processing, and actuation capabilities at various levels in the energy distribution framework. The security vulnerabilities associated with the SCADA-enabled grid infrastructure and management could jeopardize the smart grid operations. This work explores the potential of Quantum Physical Unclonable Functions (QPUF) for the security, privacy, and reliability of the smart grid's energy transmission and distribution framework.   Quantum computing has emerged as a formidable security solution for high-performance computing applications through its probabilistic nature of information processing. This work has a quantum hardware-assisted security mechanism based on intrinsic properties of quantum hardware driven by quantum mechanics to provide tamper-proof security for quantum computing driven smart grid infrastructure. This work introduces a novel QPUF architecture using quantum logic gates based on quantum decoherence, entanglement, and superposition. This generates a unique bitstream for each quantum device as a fingerprint. The proposed QPUF design is evaluated on IBM and Google quantum systems and simulators. The deployment on the IBM quantum simulator (ibmq_qasm_simulator) has achieved an average Hamming distance of 50.07%, 51% randomness, and 86% of the keys showing 100% reliability.

### Embedding an Ethical Mind: Aligning Text-to-Image Synthesis via   Lightweight Value Optimization
**Authors**: Xingqi Wang, Xiaoyuan Yi, Xing Xie, Jia Jia

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T16:03:42Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in diffusion models trained on large-scale data have enabled the generation of indistinguishable human-level images, yet they often produce harmful content misaligned with human values, e.g., social bias, and offensive content. Despite extensive research on Large Language Models (LLMs), the challenge of Text-to-Image (T2I) model alignment remains largely unexplored. Addressing this problem, we propose LiVO (Lightweight Value Optimization), a novel lightweight method for aligning T2I models with human values. LiVO only optimizes a plug-and-play value encoder to integrate a specified value principle with the input prompt, allowing the control of generated images over both semantics and values. Specifically, we design a diffusion model-tailored preference optimization loss, which theoretically approximates the Bradley-Terry model used in LLM alignment but provides a more flexible trade-off between image quality and value conformity. To optimize the value encoder, we also develop a framework to automatically construct a text-image preference dataset of 86k (prompt, aligned image, violating image, value principle) samples. Without updating most model parameters and through adaptive value selection from the input prompt, LiVO significantly reduces harmful outputs and achieves faster convergence, surpassing several strong baselines and taking an initial step towards ethically aligned T2I models.

### Unsupervised End-to-End Task-Oriented Dialogue with LLMs: The Power of   the Noisy Channel
**Authors**: Brendan King, Jeffrey Flanigan

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T16:01:59Z

**Summary**: Training task-oriented dialogue systems typically requires turn-level annotations for interacting with their APIs: e.g. a dialogue state and the system actions taken at each step. These annotations can be costly to produce, error-prone, and require both domain and annotation expertise. With advances in LLMs, we hypothesize that unlabeled data and a schema definition are sufficient for building a working task-oriented dialogue system, completely unsupervised. We consider a novel unsupervised setting of only (1) a well-defined API schema (2) a set of unlabeled dialogues between a user and agent. We propose an innovative approach using expectation-maximization (EM) that infers turn-level annotations as latent variables using a noisy channel model to build an end-to-end dialogue agent. Evaluating our approach on the MultiWOZ benchmark, our method more than doubles the dialogue success rate of a strong GPT-3.5 baseline.

### Automatic Mapping of Anatomical Landmarks from Free-Text Using Large   Language Models: Insights from Llama-2
**Authors**: Mohamad Abdi, Gerardo Hemosillo Valadez, Halid Ziya Yerebakan

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T15:48:28Z

**Summary**: Anatomical landmarks are vital in medical imaging for navigation and anomaly detection. Modern large language models (LLMs), like Llama-2, offer promise for automating the mapping of these landmarks in free-text radiology reports to corresponding positions in image data. Recent studies propose LLMs may develop coherent representations of generative processes. Motivated by these insights, we investigated whether LLMs accurately represent the spatial positions of anatomical landmarks. Through experiments with Llama-2 models, we found that they can linearly represent anatomical landmarks in space with considerable robustness to different prompts. These results underscore the potential of LLMs to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of medical imaging workflows.

### ToBlend: Token-Level Blending With an Ensemble of LLMs to Attack   AI-Generated Text Detection
**Authors**: Fan Huang, Haewoon Kwak, Jisun An

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T15:40:51Z

**Summary**: The robustness of AI-content detection models against sophisticated adversarial strategies, such as paraphrasing or word switching, is a rising concern in natural language generation (NLG) applications. This study proposes ToBlend, a novel token-level ensemble text generation method to challenge the robustness of current AI-content detection approaches by utilizing multiple sets of candidate generative large language models (LLMs). By randomly sampling token(s) from candidate LLMs sets, we find ToBlend significantly drops the performance of most mainstream AI-content detection methods. We evaluate the text quality produced under different ToBlend settings based on annotations from experienced human experts. We proposed a fine-tuned Llama3.1 model to distinguish the ToBlend generated text more accurately. Our findings underscore our proposed text generation approach's great potential in deceiving and improving detection models. Our datasets, codes, and annotations are open-sourced.

### New Paradigm of Adversarial Training: Breaking Inherent Trade-Off   between Accuracy and Robustness via Dummy Classes
**Authors**: Yanyun Wang, Li Liu, Zi Liang, Qingqing Ye, Haibo Hu

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T15:36:10Z

**Summary**: Adversarial Training (AT) is one of the most effective methods to enhance the robustness of DNNs. However, existing AT methods suffer from an inherent trade-off between adversarial robustness and clean accuracy, which seriously hinders their real-world deployment. While this problem has been widely studied within the current AT paradigm, existing AT methods still typically experience a reduction in clean accuracy by over 10% to date, without significant improvements in robustness compared with simple baselines like PGD-AT. This inherent trade-off raises a question: whether the current AT paradigm, which assumes to learn the corresponding benign and adversarial samples as the same class, inappropriately combines clean and robust objectives that may be essentially inconsistent. In this work, we surprisingly reveal that up to 40% of CIFAR-10 adversarial samples always fail to satisfy such an assumption across various AT methods and robust models, explicitly indicating the improvement room for the current AT paradigm. Accordingly, to relax the tension between clean and robust learning derived from this overstrict assumption, we propose a new AT paradigm by introducing an additional dummy class for each original class, aiming to accommodate the hard adversarial samples with shifted distribution after perturbation. The robustness w.r.t. these adversarial samples can be achieved by runtime recovery from the predicted dummy classes to their corresponding original ones, eliminating the compromise with clean learning. Building on this new paradigm, we propose a novel plug-and-play AT technology named DUmmy Classes-based Adversarial Training (DUCAT). Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet demonstrate that the DUCAT concurrently improves clean accuracy and adversarial robustness compared with state-of-the-art benchmarks, effectively breaking the existing inherent trade-off.

**Summary**: Reinforcement learning combined with sim-to-real transfer offers a general framework for developing locomotion controllers for legged robots. To facilitate successful deployment in the real world, smoothing techniques, such as low-pass filters and smoothness rewards, are often employed to develop policies with smooth behaviors. However, because these techniques are non-differentiable and usually require tedious tuning of a large set of hyperparameters, they tend to require extensive manual tuning for each robotic platform. To address this challenge and establish a general technique for enforcing smooth behaviors, we propose a simple and effective method that imposes a Lipschitz constraint on a learned policy, which we refer to as Lipschitz-Constrained Policies (LCP). We show that the Lipschitz constraint can be implemented in the form of a gradient penalty, which provides a differentiable objective that can be easily incorporated with automatic differentiation frameworks. We demonstrate that LCP effectively replaces the need for smoothing rewards or low-pass filters and can be easily integrated into training frameworks for many distinct humanoid robots. We extensively evaluate LCP in both simulation and real-world humanoid robots, producing smooth and robust locomotion controllers. All simulation and deployment code, along with complete checkpoints, is available on our project page: https://lipschitz-constrained-policy.github.io.

### Cross-Modal Safety Mechanism Transfer in Large Vision-Language Models
**Authors**: Shicheng Xu, Liang Pang, Yunchang Zhu, Huawei Shen, Xueqi Cheng

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T15:20:08Z

**Summary**: Vision-language alignment in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) successfully enables LLMs to understand visual input. However, we find that existing vision-language alignment methods fail to transfer the existing safety mechanism for text in LLMs to vision, which leads to vulnerabilities in toxic image. To explore the cause of this problem, we give the insightful explanation of where and how the safety mechanism of LVLMs operates and conduct comparative analysis between text and vision. We find that the hidden states at the specific transformer layers play a crucial role in the successful activation of safety mechanism, while the vision-language alignment at hidden states level in current methods is insufficient. This results in a semantic shift for input images compared to text in hidden states, therefore misleads the safety mechanism. To address this, we propose a novel Text-Guided vision-language Alignment method (TGA) for LVLMs. TGA retrieves the texts related to input vision and uses them to guide the projection of vision into the hidden states space in LLMs. Experiments show that TGA not only successfully transfers the safety mechanism for text in basic LLMs to vision in vision-language alignment for LVLMs without any safety fine-tuning on the visual modality but also maintains the general performance on various vision tasks (Safe and Good).

**Authors**: Mete Ismayilzada, Defne Circi, Jonne Sälevä, Hale Sirin, Abdullatif Köksal, Bhuwan Dhingra, Antoine Bosselut, Lonneke van der Plas, Duygu Ataman

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T15:17:20Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant progress in various natural language generation and understanding tasks. However, their linguistic generalization capabilities remain questionable, raising doubts about whether these models learn language similarly to humans. While humans exhibit compositional generalization and linguistic creativity in language use, the extent to which LLMs replicate these abilities, particularly in morphology, is under-explored. In this work, we systematically investigate the morphological generalization abilities of LLMs through the lens of compositionality. We define morphemes as compositional primitives and design a novel suite of generative and discriminative tasks to assess morphological productivity and systematicity. Focusing on agglutinative languages such as Turkish and Finnish, we evaluate several state-of-the-art instruction-finetuned multilingual models, including GPT-4 and Gemini. Our analysis shows that LLMs struggle with morphological compositional generalization particularly when applied to novel word roots, with performance declining sharply as morphological complexity increases. While models can identify individual morphological combinations better than chance, their performance lacks systematicity, leading to significant accuracy gaps compared to humans.

### CELL your Model: Contrastive Explanations for Large Language Models
**Authors**: Ronny Luss, Erik Miehling, Amit Dhurandhar

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T15:15:44Z

**Summary**: The advent of black-box deep neural network classification models has sparked the need to explain their decisions. However, in the case of generative AI, such as large language models (LLMs), there is no class prediction to explain. Rather, one can ask why an LLM output a particular response to a given prompt. In this paper, we answer this question by proposing, to the best of our knowledge, the first contrastive explanation methods requiring simply black-box/query access. Our explanations suggest that an LLM outputs a reply to a given prompt because if the prompt was slightly modified, the LLM would have given a different response that is either less preferable or contradicts the original response. The key insight is that contrastive explanations simply require a scoring function that has meaning to the user and not necessarily a specific real valued quantity (viz. class label). We offer two algorithms for finding contrastive explanations: i) A myopic algorithm, which although effective in creating contrasts, requires many model calls and ii) A budgeted algorithm, our main algorithmic contribution, which intelligently creates contrasts adhering to a query budget, necessary for longer contexts. We show the efficacy of these methods on diverse natural language tasks such as open-text generation, automated red teaming, and explaining conversational degradation.

### Light-Weight Fault Tolerant Attention for Large Language Model Training
**Authors**: Yuhang Liang, Xinyi Li, Jie Ren, Ang Li, Bo Fang, Jieyang Chen

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T15:10:58Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in various natural language processing tasks. However, the training of these models is computationally intensive and susceptible to faults, particularly in the attention mechanism, which is a critical component of transformer-based LLMs. In this paper, we investigate the impact of faults on LLM training, focusing on INF, NaN, and near-INF values in the computation results with systematic fault injection experiments. We observe the propagation patterns of these errors, which can trigger non-trainable states in the model and disrupt training, forcing the procedure to load from checkpoints. To mitigate the impact of these faults, we propose ATTNChecker, the first Algorithm-Based Fault Tolerance (ABFT) technique tailored for the attention mechanism in LLMs. ATTNChecker is designed based on fault propagation patterns of LLM and incorporates performance optimization to adapt to both system reliability and model vulnerability while providing lightweight protection for fast LLM training. Evaluations on four LLMs show that ATTNChecker on average incurs on average 7% overhead on training while detecting and correcting all extreme errors. Compared with the state-of-the-art checkpoint/restore approach, ATTNChecker reduces recovery overhead by up to 49x.

### DOCE: Finding the Sweet Spot for Execution-Based Code Generation
**Authors**: Haau-Sing Li, Patrick Fernandes, Iryna Gurevych, André F. T. Martins

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T15:07:41Z

**Summary**: Recently, a diverse set of decoding and reranking procedures have been shown effective for LLM-based code generation. However, a comprehensive framework that links and experimentally compares these methods is missing. We address this by proposing Decoding Objectives for Code Execution, a comprehensive framework that includes candidate generation, $n$-best reranking, minimum Bayes risk (MBR) decoding, and self-debugging as the core components. We then study the contributions of these components through execution-based evaluation metrics. Our findings highlight the importance of execution-based methods and the difference gap between execution-based and execution-free methods. Furthermore, we assess the impact of filtering based on trial unit tests, a simple and effective strategy that has been often overlooked in prior works. We also propose self-debugging on multiple candidates, obtaining state-of-the-art performance on reranking for code generation. We expect our framework to provide a solid guideline for future research on code generation.

### Reward-Robust RLHF in LLMs
**Authors**: Yuzi Yan, Xingzhou Lou, Jialian Li, Yiping Zhang, Jian Xie, Chao Yu, Yu Wang, Dong Yan, Yuan Shen

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T14:56:15Z

**Summary**: As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to progress toward more advanced forms of intelligence, Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is increasingly seen as a key pathway toward achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). However, the reliance on reward-model-based (RM-based) alignment methods introduces significant challenges due to the inherent instability and imperfections of Reward Models (RMs), which can lead to critical issues such as reward hacking and misalignment with human intentions. In this paper, we introduce a reward-robust RLHF framework aimed at addressing these fundamental challenges, paving the way for more reliable and resilient learning in LLMs. Our approach introduces a novel optimization objective that carefully balances performance and robustness by incorporating Bayesian Reward Model Ensembles (BRME) to model the uncertainty set of reward functions. This allows the framework to integrate both nominal performance and minimum reward signals, ensuring more stable learning even with imperfect RMs. Empirical results demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms baselines across diverse benchmarks, showing improved accuracy and long-term stability. We also provide a theoretical analysis, demonstrating that reward-robust RLHF approaches the stability of constant reward settings, which proves to be acceptable even in a stochastic-case analysis. Together, these contributions highlight the framework potential to enhance both the performance and stability of LLM alignment.

### Robust ASR Error Correction with Conservative Data Filtering
**Authors**: Takuma Udagawa, Masayuki Suzuki, Masayasu Muraoka, Gakuto Kurata

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T14:52:16Z

**Summary**: Error correction (EC) based on large language models is an emerging technology to enhance the performance of automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. Generally, training data for EC are collected by automatically pairing a large set of ASR hypotheses (as sources) and their gold references (as targets). However, the quality of such pairs is not guaranteed, and we observed various types of noise which can make the EC models brittle, e.g. inducing overcorrection in out-of-domain (OOD) settings. In this work, we propose two fundamental criteria that EC training data should satisfy: namely, EC targets should (1) improve linguistic acceptability over sources and (2) be inferable from the available context (e.g. source phonemes). Through these criteria, we identify low-quality EC pairs and train the models not to make any correction in such cases, the process we refer to as conservative data filtering. In our experiments, we focus on Japanese ASR using a strong Conformer-CTC as the baseline and finetune Japanese LLMs for EC. Through our evaluation on a suite of 21 internal benchmarks, we demonstrate that our approach can significantly reduce overcorrection and improve both the accuracy and quality of ASR results in the challenging OOD settings.

### Details Make a Difference: Object State-Sensitive Neurorobotic Task   Planning
**Authors**: Xiaowen Sun, Xufeng Zhao, Jae Hee Lee, Wenhao Lu, Matthias Kerzel, Stefan Wermter

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T14:48:38Z

**Summary**: The state of an object reflects its current status or condition and is important for a robot's task planning and manipulation. However, detecting an object's state and generating a state-sensitive plan for robots is challenging. Recently, pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in generating plans. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is hardly any investigation on whether LLMs or VLMs can also generate object state-sensitive plans. To study this, we introduce an Object State-Sensitive Agent (OSSA), a task-planning agent empowered by pre-trained neural networks. We propose two methods for OSSA: (i) a modular model consisting of a pre-trained vision processing module (dense captioning model, DCM) and a natural language processing model (LLM), and (ii) a monolithic model consisting only of a VLM. To quantitatively evaluate the performances of the two methods, we use tabletop scenarios where the task is to clear the table. We contribute a multimodal benchmark dataset that takes object states into consideration. Our results show that both methods can be used for object state-sensitive tasks, but the monolithic approach outperforms the modular approach. The code for OSSA is available at https://github.com/Xiao-wen-Sun/OSSA

### Weak-to-Strong Generalization beyond Accuracy: a Pilot Study in Safety,   Toxicity, and Legal Reasoning
**Authors**: Ruimeng Ye, Yang Xiao, Bo Hui

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T14:40:32Z

**Summary**: As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, ensuring their alignment with human values becomes increasingly critical. Traditional alignment methods heavily rely on human feedback to fine-tune models. With the emergence of superhuman models whose outputs may surpass human understanding, evaluating and aligning these models using human judgments poses significant challenges. To address the challenges, recent works use weak supervisors to elicit knowledge from much stronger models. However, there are important disanalogies between the empirical setup in the existing works and the genuine goal of alignment. We remark that existing works investigate the phenomenon of weak-to-strong generation in analogous setup (i.e., binary classification), rather than practical alignment-relevant tasks (e.g., safety). In this paper, we bridge this gap by extending weak-to-strong generation to the context of practical alignment. We empirically demonstrate the widespread phenomenon of weak-to-strong generation in three complicated alignment tasks: safety, toxicity, and legal reasoning}. Furthermore, we explore efficient strategies for improving alignment performance to enhance the quality of model outcomes. Lastly, we summarize and analyze the challenges and potential solutions in regard to specific alignment tasks, which we hope to catalyze the research progress on the topic of weak-to-strong generalization. Our code is released at https://github.com/yeruimeng/WTS.git.

### Can Graph Descriptive Order Affect Solving Graph Problems with LLMs?
**Authors**: Yuyao Ge, Shenghua Liu, Baolong Bi, Yiwei Wang, Lingrui Mei, Wenjie Feng, Lizhe Chen, Xueqi Cheng

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T14:34:57Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant success in reasoning tasks, including mathematical reasoning and logical deduction. Among these reasoning tasks, graph problems stand out due to their complexity and unique structural characteristics, attracting considerable attention from researchers. Previous studies have explored LLMs' graph reasoning abilities through various techniques, such as different encoding methods for graph structures and the use of carefully designed prompts. However, a critical factor has been mostly overlooked: the prompt sequential order in which graph descriptions are presented to the models. In this study, we present the first comprehensive analysis of how the order of graph descriptions impacts LLM performance. Specifically, we comprehensively evaluate four graph description orders across six graph problems using six mainstream LLMs. The results reveal that: (1) ordered graph descriptions significantly improve LLMs' comprehension of graph structures; (2) the robustness of LLMs to graph description order varies across different tasks; and (3) the impact of graph order on performance is closely related to the inherent characteristics of tasks. This study provides a critical advancement in the application of LLMs for solving graph-related problems, paving the way for future research to optimize model performance through strategic graph description ordering.

### Exploring Model Kinship for Merging Large Language Models
**Authors**: Yedi Hu, Yunzhi Yao, Ningyu Zhang, Shumin Deng, Huajun Chen

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T14:29:29Z

**Summary**: Model merging has become one of the key technologies for enhancing the capabilities and efficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, our understanding of the expected performance gains and principles when merging any two models remains limited. In this work, we introduce model kinship, the degree of similarity or relatedness between LLMs, analogous to biological evolution. With comprehensive empirical analysis, we find that there is a certain relationship between model kinship and the performance gains after model merging, which can help guide our selection of candidate models. Inspired by this, we propose a new model merging strategy: Top-k Greedy Merging with Model Kinship, which can yield better performance on benchmark datasets. Specifically, we discover that using model kinship as a criterion can assist us in continuously performing model merging, alleviating the degradation (local optima) in model evolution, whereas model kinship can serve as a guide to escape these traps. Code is available at https://github.com/zjunlp/ModelKinship.

### Not All Votes Count! Programs as Verifiers Improve Self-Consistency of   Language Models for Math Reasoning
**Authors**: Vernon Y. H. Toh, Deepanway Ghosal, Soujanya Poria

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T14:24:55Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have shown increasing proficiency in solving mathematical reasoning problems. However, many current open-source LLMs often still make calculation and semantic understanding errors in their intermediate reasoning steps. In this work, we propose PROVE, a simple yet effective framework that uses program-based verification as a heuristic to filter out potentially incorrect reasoning paths before aggregating the final answers. Instead of relying on vanilla majority voting, our approach rejects solutions whose corresponding program outputs are inconsistent with the generated solution, aggregating only those validated by Python programs. We conducted extensive experiments on 13 open-source LLMs from various model families and sizes, ranging from 0.5B to 13B parameters, across seven math benchmarks. We demonstrate that PROVE consistently outperforms vanilla majority voting as a heuristic for solving mathematical reasoning tasks across all datasets and model sizes. Notably, PROVE increases accuracy on the GSM8K benchmark from 48.85% to 53.83% for Qwen2-0.5B-Instruct, from 65.66% to 73.01% for Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct, from 73.39% to 79.61% for Gemma-2-2b-it, and from 41.32% to 59.51% for Llama-2-7B-chat.

### CCSBench: Evaluating Compositional Controllability in LLMs for   Scientific Document Summarization
**Authors**: Yixi Ding, Jiaying Wu, Tongyao Zhu, Yanxia Qin, Qian Liu, Min-Yen Kan

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T14:21:52Z

**Summary**: To broaden the dissemination of scientific knowledge to diverse audiences, scientific document summarization must simultaneously control multiple attributes such as length and empirical focus. However, existing research typically focuses on controlling single attributes, leaving the compositional control of multiple attributes underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce CCSBench, a benchmark for compositional controllable summarization in the scientific domain. Our benchmark enables fine-grained control over both explicit attributes (e.g., length), which are objective and straightforward, and implicit attributes (e.g., empirical focus), which are more subjective and conceptual. We conduct extensive experiments on GPT-4, LLaMA2, and other popular LLMs under various settings. Our findings reveal significant limitations in large language models' ability to balance trade-offs between control attributes, especially implicit ones that require deeper understanding and abstract reasoning.

### On the Risk of Evidence Pollution for Malicious Social Text Detection in   the Era of LLMs
**Authors**: Herun Wan, Minnan Luo, Zhixiong Su, Guang Dai, Xiang Zhao

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T14:17:53Z

**Summary**: Evidence-enhanced detectors present remarkable abilities in identifying malicious social text with related evidence. However, the rise of large language models (LLMs) brings potential risks of evidence pollution to confuse detectors. This paper explores how to manipulate evidence, simulating potential misuse scenarios including basic pollution, and rephrasing or generating evidence by LLMs. To mitigate its negative impact, we propose three defense strategies from both the data and model sides, including machine-generated text detection, a mixture of experts, and parameter updating. Extensive experiments on four malicious social text detection tasks with ten datasets present that evidence pollution, especially the generate strategy, significantly compromises existing detectors. On the other hand, the defense strategies could mitigate evidence pollution, but they faced limitations for practical employment, such as the need for annotated data and huge inference costs. Further analysis illustrates that polluted evidence is of high quality, would compromise the model calibration, and could ensemble to amplify the negative impact.

### From Explainable to Interpretable Deep Learning for Natural Language   Processing in Healthcare: How Far from Reality?
**Authors**: Guangming Huang, Yingya Li, Shoaib Jameel, Yunfei Long, Giorgos Papanastasiou

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T14:14:27Z

**Summary**: Deep learning (DL) has substantially enhanced natural language processing (NLP) in healthcare research. However, the increasing complexity of DL-based NLP necessitates transparent model interpretability, or at least explainability, for reliable decision-making. This work presents a thorough scoping review of explainable and interpretable DL in healthcare NLP. The term "eXplainable and Interpretable Artificial Intelligence" (XIAI) is introduced to distinguish XAI from IAI. Different models are further categorized based on their functionality (model-, input-, output-based) and scope (local, global). Our analysis shows that attention mechanisms are the most prevalent emerging IAI technique. The use of IAI is growing, distinguishing it from XAI. The major challenges identified are that most XIAI does not explore "global" modelling processes, the lack of best practices, and the lack of systematic evaluation and benchmarks. One important opportunity is to use attention mechanisms to enhance multi-modal XIAI for personalized medicine. Additionally, combining DL with causal logic holds promise. Our discussion encourages the integration of XIAI in Large Language Models (LLMs) and domain-specific smaller models. In conclusion, XIAI adoption in healthcare requires dedicated in-house expertise. Collaboration with domain experts, end-users, and policymakers can lead to ready-to-use XIAI methods across NLP and medical tasks. While challenges exist, XIAI techniques offer a valuable foundation for interpretable NLP algorithms in healthcare.

### Expand and Compress: Exploring Tuning Principles for Continual   Spatio-Temporal Graph Forecasting
**Authors**: Wei Chen, Yuxuan Liang

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T14:12:11Z

**Summary**: The widespread deployment of sensing devices leads to a surge in data for spatio-temporal forecasting applications such as traffic flow, air quality, and wind energy. Although spatio-temporal graph neural networks have achieved success in modeling various static spatio-temporal forecasting scenarios, real-world spatio-temporal data are typically received in a streaming manner, and the network continuously expands with the installation of new sensors. Thus, spatio-temporal forecasting in streaming scenarios faces dual challenges: the inefficiency of retraining models over newly arrived data and the detrimental effects of catastrophic forgetting over long-term history. To address these challenges, we propose a novel prompt tuning-based continuous forecasting method, following two fundamental tuning principles guided by empirical and theoretical analysis: expand and compress, which effectively resolve the aforementioned problems with lightweight tuning parameters. Specifically, we integrate the base spatio-temporal graph neural network with a continuous prompt pool, utilizing stored prompts (i.e., few learnable parameters) in memory, and jointly optimize them with the base spatio-temporal graph neural network. This method ensures that the model sequentially learns from the spatio-temporal data stream to accomplish tasks for corresponding periods. Extensive experimental results on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate the multi-faceted superiority of our method over the state-of-the-art baselines, including effectiveness, efficiency, universality, etc.

### FALCON: Pinpointing and Mitigating Stragglers for Large-Scale   Hybrid-Parallel Training
**Authors**: Tianyuan Wu, Wei Wang, Yinghao Yu, Siran Yang, Wenchao Wu, Qinkai Duan, Guodong Yang, Jiamang Wang, Lin Qu, Liping Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T14:07:35Z

**Summary**: Fail-slows, or stragglers, are common but largely unheeded problems in large-scale hybrid-parallel training that spans thousands of GPU servers and runs for weeks to months. Yet, these problems are not well studied, nor can they be quickly detected and effectively mitigated. In this paper, we first present a characterization study on a shared production cluster with over 10,000 GPUs1. We find that fail-slows are caused by various CPU/GPU computation and cross-node networking issues, lasting from tens of seconds to nearly ten hours, and collectively delaying the average job completion time by 1.34%. The current practice is to manually detect these fail-slows and simply treat them as fail-stops using a checkpoint-and-restart failover approach, which are labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we propose FALCON, a framework that rapidly identifies fail-slowed GPUs and/or communication links, and effectively tackles them with a novel multi-level mitigation mechanism, all without human intervention. We have applied FALCON to detect human-labeled fail-slows in a production cluster with over 99% accuracy. Cluster deployment further demonstrates that FALCON effectively handles manually injected fail-slows, mitigating the training slowdown by 60.1%.

### Can We Reverse In-Context Knowledge Edits?
**Authors**: Paul Youssef, Zhixue Zhao, Jörg Schlötterer, Christin Seifert

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T14:04:26Z

**Summary**: In-context knowledge editing (IKE) enables efficient modification of large language model (LLM) outputs without parameter changes and at zero-cost. However, it can be misused to manipulate responses opaquely, e.g., insert misinformation or offensive content. Such malicious interventions could be incorporated into high-level wrapped APIs where the final input prompt is not shown to end-users. To address this issue, we investigate the detection and reversal of IKE-edits. First, we demonstrate that IKE-edits can be detected with high accuracy (F1 > 80\%) using only the top-10 output probabilities of the next token, even in a black-box setting, e.g. proprietary LLMs with limited output information. Further, we introduce the novel task of reversing IKE-edits using specially tuned reversal tokens. We explore using both continuous and discrete reversal tokens, achieving over 80\% accuracy in recovering original, unedited outputs across multiple LLMs. Our continuous reversal tokens prove particularly effective, with minimal impact on unedited prompts. Through analysis of output distributions, attention patterns, and token rankings, we provide insights into IKE's effects on LLMs and how reversal tokens mitigate them. This work represents a significant step towards enhancing LLM resilience against potential misuse of in-context editing, improving their transparency and trustworthiness.

### STRUX: An LLM for Decision-Making with Structured Explanations
**Authors**: Yiming Lu, Yebowen Hu, Hassan Foroosh, Wei Jin, Fei Liu

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T14:01:22Z

**Summary**: Countless decisions shape our daily lives, and it is paramount to understand the how and why behind these choices. In this paper, we introduce a new LLM decision-making framework called STRUX, which enhances LLM decision-making by providing structured explanations. These include favorable and adverse facts related to the decision, along with their respective strengths. STRUX begins by distilling lengthy information into a concise table of key facts. It then employs a series of self-reflection steps to determine which of these facts are pivotal, categorizing them as either favorable or adverse in relation to a specific decision. Lastly, we fine-tune an LLM to identify and prioritize these key facts to optimize decision-making. STRUX has been evaluated on the challenging task of forecasting stock investment decisions based on earnings call transcripts and demonstrated superior performance against strong baselines. It enhances decision transparency by allowing users to understand the impact of different factors, representing a meaningful step towards practical decision-making with LLMs.

**Authors**: Meriem Ben Chaaben, Lola Burgueño, Istvan David, Houari Sahraoui

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T13:55:34Z

**Summary**: Model-driven engineering (MDE) simplifies software development through abstraction, yet challenges such as time constraints, incomplete domain understanding, and adherence to syntactic constraints hinder the design process. This paper presents a study to evaluate the usefulness of a novel approach utilizing large language models (LLMs) and few-shot prompt learning to assist in domain modeling. The aim of this approach is to overcome the need for extensive training of AI-based completion models on scarce domain-specific datasets and to offer versatile support for various modeling activities, providing valuable recommendations to software modelers. To support this approach, we developed MAGDA, a user-friendly tool, through which we conduct a user study and assess the real-world applicability of our approach in the context of domain modeling, offering valuable insights into its usability and effectiveness.

**Authors**: Sihao Wu, Jiaxu Liu, Xiangyu Yin, Guangliang Cheng, Meng Fang, Xingyu Zhao, Xinping Yi, Xiaowei Huang

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T13:43:00Z

**Summary**: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into autonomous driving systems demonstrates strong common sense and reasoning abilities, effectively addressing the pitfalls of purely data-driven methods. Current LLM-based agents require lengthy inference times and face challenges in interacting with real-time autonomous driving environments. A key open question is whether we can effectively leverage the knowledge from LLMs to train an efficient and robust Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent. This paper introduces RAPID, a novel \underline{\textbf{R}}obust \underline{\textbf{A}}daptive \underline{\textbf{P}}olicy \underline{\textbf{I}}nfusion and \underline{\textbf{D}}istillation framework, which trains specialized mix-of-policy RL agents using data synthesized by an LLM-based driving agent and online adaptation. RAPID features three key designs: 1) utilization of offline data collected from an LLM agent to distil expert knowledge into RL policies for faster real-time inference; 2) introduction of robust distillation in RL to inherit both performance and robustness from LLM-based teacher; and 3) employment of a mix-of-policy approach for joint decision decoding with a policy adapter. Through fine-tuning via online environment interaction, RAPID reduces the forgetting of LLM knowledge while maintaining adaptability to different tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate RAPID's capability to effectively integrate LLM knowledge into scaled-down RL policies in an efficient, adaptable, and robust way. Code and checkpoints will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

### The Comparative Trap: Pairwise Comparisons Amplifies Biased Preferences   of LLM Evaluators
**Authors**: Hawon Jeong, ChaeHun Park, Jimin Hong, Hojoon Lee, Jaegul Choo

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T13:39:49Z

**Summary**: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as evaluators for natural language generation tasks, ensuring unbiased assessments is essential. However, LLM evaluators often display biased preferences, such as favoring verbosity and authoritative tones. Our empirical analysis reveals that these biases are exacerbated in pairwise evaluation, where LLMs directly compare two outputs and easily prioritize superficial attributes. In contrast, pointwise evaluation, which assesses outputs independently, is less susceptible to such bias because each output is judged in isolation. To address the limitations of the pairwise evaluation, we introduce a novel evaluation method, PRePair, which integrates pointwise reasoning within a pairwise framework. PRePair effectively alleviates biased preference, improving performance on the adversarial benchmark (LLMBar) while outperforming pointwise evaluation on the standard benchmark (MT-Bench).

### FTII-Bench: A Comprehensive Multimodal Benchmark for Flow Text with   Image Insertion
**Authors**: Jiacheng Ruan, Yebin Yang, Zehao Lin, Feiyu Xiong, Zeyun Tang, Zhiyu Li

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T13:38:31Z

**Summary**: Benefiting from the revolutionary advances in large language models (LLMs) and foundational vision models, large vision-language models (LVLMs) have also made significant progress. However, current benchmarks focus on tasks that evaluating only a single aspect of LVLM capabilities (e.g., recognition, detection, understanding). These tasks fail to fully demonstrate LVLMs' potential in complex application scenarios. To comprehensively assess the performance of existing LVLMs, we propose a more challenging task called the Flow Text with Image Insertion task (FTII). This task requires LVLMs to simultaneously possess outstanding abilities in image comprehension, instruction understanding, and long-text interpretation. Specifically, given several text paragraphs and a set of candidate images, as the text paragraphs accumulate, the LVLMs are required to select the most suitable image from the candidates to insert after the corresponding paragraph. Constructing a benchmark for such a task is highly challenging, particularly in determining the sequence of flowing text and images. To address this challenge, we turn to professional news reports, which naturally contain a gold standard for image-text sequences. Based on this, we introduce the Flow Text with Image Insertion Benchmark (FTII-Bench), which includes 318 high-quality Chinese image-text news articles and 307 high-quality English image-text news articles, covering 10 different news domains. Using these 625 high-quality articles, we construct problems of two different types with multiple levels of difficulty. Furthermore, we establish two different evaluation pipelines based on the CLIP model and existing LVLMs. We evaluate 9 open-source and 2 closed-source LVLMs as well as 2 CLIP-based models. Results indicate that even the most advanced models (e.g., GPT-4o) face significant challenges when tackling the FTII task.

### A Claim Decomposition Benchmark for Long-form Answer Verification
**Authors**: Zhihao Zhang, Yixing Fan, Ruqing Zhang, Jiafeng Guo

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T13:34:51Z

**Summary**: The advancement of LLMs has significantly boosted the performance of complex long-form question answering tasks. However, one prominent issue of LLMs is the generated "hallucination" responses that are not factual. Consequently, attribution for each claim in responses becomes a common solution to improve the factuality and verifiability. Existing researches mainly focus on how to provide accurate citations for the response, which largely overlook the importance of identifying the claims or statements for each response. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new claim decomposition benchmark, which requires building system that can identify atomic and checkworthy claims for LLM responses. Specifically, we present the Chinese Atomic Claim Decomposition Dataset (CACDD), which builds on the WebCPM dataset with additional expert annotations to ensure high data quality. The CACDD encompasses a collection of 500 human-annotated question-answer pairs, including a total of 4956 atomic claims. We further propose a new pipeline for human annotation and describe the challenges of this task. In addition, we provide experiment results on zero-shot, few-shot and fine-tuned LLMs as baselines. The results show that the claim decomposition is highly challenging and requires further explorations. All code and data are publicly available at \url{https://github.com/FBzzh/CACDD}.

### Leveraging Augmented Reality for Improved Situational Awareness During   UAV-Driven Search and Rescue Missions
**Authors**: Rushikesh Nalamothu, Puneet Sontha, Janardhan Karravula, Ankit Agrawal

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T13:32:37Z

**Summary**: In the high-stakes domain of search-and-rescue missions, the deployment of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has become increasingly pivotal. These missions require seamless, real-time communication among diverse roles within response teams, particularly between Remote Operators (ROs) and On-Site Operators (OSOs). Traditionally, ROs and OSOs have relied on radio communication to exchange critical information, such as the geolocation of victims, hazardous areas, and points of interest. However, radio communication lacks information visualization, suffers from noise, and requires mental effort to interpret information, leading to miscommunications and misunderstandings. To address these challenges, this paper presents VizCom-AR, an Augmented Reality system designed to facilitate visual communication between ROs and OSOs and their situational awareness during UAV-driven search-and-rescue missions. Our experiments, focus group sessions with police officers, and field study showed that VizCom-AR enhances spatial awareness of both ROs and OSOs, facilitate geolocation information exchange, and effectively complement existing communication tools in UAV-driven emergency response missions. Overall, VizCom-AR offers a fundamental framework for designing Augmented Reality systems for large scale UAV-driven rescue missions.

### Enhancing Data Privacy in Large Language Models through Private   Association Editing
**Authors**: Davide Venditti, Elena Sofia Ruzzetti, Giancarlo A. Xompero, Cristina Giannone, Andrea Favalli, Raniero Romagnoli, Fabio Massimo Zanzotto

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T13:31:05Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) require a significant redesign in solutions to preserve privacy in data-intensive applications due to their text-generation capabilities. Indeed, LLMs tend to memorize and emit private information when maliciously prompted. In this paper, we introduce Private Association Editing (PAE) as a novel defense approach for private data leakage. PAE is designed to effectively remove Personally Identifiable Information (PII) without retraining the model. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of PAE with respect to alternative baseline methods. We believe PAE will serve as a critical tool in the ongoing effort to protect data privacy in LLMs, encouraging the development of safer models for real-world applications.

### LLM-based Translation Inference with Iterative Bilingual Understanding
**Authors**: Andong Chen, Kehai Chen, Yang Xiang, Xuefeng Bai, Muyun Yang, Tiejun Zhao, Min zhang

**Updated**: 2024-10-17T02:28:25Z

**Summary**: The remarkable understanding and generation capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have greatly improved translation performance. However, incorrect understanding of the sentence to be translated can degrade translation quality. To address this issue, we proposed a novel Iterative Bilingual Understanding Translation (IBUT) method based on the cross-lingual capabilities of LLMs and the dual characteristics of translation tasks. The cross-lingual capability of LLMs enables the generation of contextual understanding for both the source and target languages separately. Furthermore, the dual characteristics allow IBUT to generate effective cross-lingual feedback, iteratively refining contextual understanding, thereby reducing errors and improving translation performance. Experimental results showed that the proposed IBUT outperforms several strong comparison methods, especially being generalized to multiple domains (e.g., news, commonsense, and cultural translation benchmarks).

### Counterfactual Effect Decomposition in Multi-Agent Sequential Decision   Making
**Authors**: Stelios Triantafyllou, Aleksa Sukovic, Yasaman Zolfimoselo, Goran Radanovic

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T13:20:35Z

**Summary**: We address the challenge of explaining counterfactual outcomes in multi-agent Markov decision processes. In particular, we aim to explain the total counterfactual effect of an agent's action on the outcome of a realized scenario through its influence on the environment dynamics and the agents' behavior. To achieve this, we introduce a novel causal explanation formula that decomposes the counterfactual effect by attributing to each agent and state variable a score reflecting their respective contributions to the effect. First, we show that the total counterfactual effect of an agent's action can be decomposed into two components: one measuring the effect that propagates through all subsequent agents' actions and another related to the effect that propagates through the state transitions. Building on recent advancements in causal contribution analysis, we further decompose these two effects as follows. For the former, we consider agent-specific effects -- a causal concept that quantifies the counterfactual effect of an agent's action that propagates through a subset of agents. Based on this notion, we use Shapley value to attribute the effect to individual agents. For the latter, we consider the concept of structure-preserving interventions and attribute the effect to state variables based on their "intrinsic" contributions. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate the interpretability of our decomposition approach in a Gridworld environment with LLM-assisted agents and a sepsis management simulator.

### DIRAS: Efficient LLM Annotation of Document Relevance in Retrieval   Augmented Generation
**Authors**: Jingwei Ni, Tobias Schimanski, Meihong Lin, Mrinmaya Sachan, Elliott Ash, Markus Leippold

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T13:16:25Z

**Summary**: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is widely employed to ground responses to queries on domain-specific documents. But do RAG implementations leave out important information when answering queries that need an integrated analysis of information (e.g., Tell me good news in the stock market today.)? To address these concerns, RAG developers need to annotate information retrieval (IR) data for their domain of interest, which is challenging because (1) domain-specific queries usually need nuanced definitions of relevance beyond shallow semantic relevance; and (2) human or GPT-4 annotation is costly and cannot cover all (query, document) pairs (i.e., annotation selection bias), thus harming the effectiveness in evaluating IR recall. To address these challenges, we propose DIRAS (Domain-specific Information Retrieval Annotation with Scalability), a manual-annotation-free schema that fine-tunes open-sourced LLMs to consider nuanced relevance definition and annotate (partial) relevance labels with calibrated relevance scores. Extensive evaluation shows that DIRAS enables smaller (8B) LLMs to achieve GPT-4-level performance on annotating and ranking unseen (query, document) pairs, and is helpful for real-world RAG development. All code, LLM generations, and human annotations can be found in \url{https://github.com/EdisonNi-hku/DIRAS}.

### Generative AI and Perceptual Harms: Who's Suspected of using LLMs?
**Authors**: Kowe Kadoma, Danaë Metaxa, Mor Naaman

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T13:14:46Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into a variety of writing tasks. While these tools can help people by generating ideas or producing higher quality work, like many other AI tools they may risk causing a variety of harms, disproportionately burdening historically marginalized groups. In this work, we introduce and evaluate perceptual harm, a term for the harm caused to users when others perceive or suspect them of using AI. We examined perceptual harms in three online experiments, each of which entailed human participants evaluating the profiles for fictional freelance writers. We asked participants whether they suspected the freelancers of using AI, the quality of their writing, and whether they should be hired. We found some support for perceptual harms against for certain demographic groups, but that perceptions of AI use negatively impacted writing evaluations and hiring outcomes across the board.

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T13:10:32Z

**Summary**: As one of the most popular and sought-after generative models in the recent years, diffusion models have sparked the interests of many researchers and steadily shown excellent advantage in various generative tasks such as image synthesis, video generation, molecule design, 3D scene rendering and multimodal generation, relying on their dense theoretical principles and reliable application practices. The remarkable success of these recent efforts on diffusion models comes largely from progressive design principles and efficient architecture, training, inference, and deployment methodologies. However, there has not been a comprehensive and in-depth review to summarize these principles and practices to help the rapid understanding and application of diffusion models. In this survey, we provide a new efficiency-oriented perspective on these existing efforts, which mainly focuses on the profound principles and efficient practices in architecture designs, model training, fast inference and reliable deployment, to guide further theoretical research, algorithm migration and model application for new scenarios in a reader-friendly way. \url{https://github.com/ponyzym/Efficient-DMs-Survey}

### MedAide: Towards an Omni Medical Aide via Specialized LLM-based   Multi-Agent Collaboration
**Authors**: Jinjie Wei, Dingkang Yang, Yanshu Li, Qingyao Xu, Zhaoyu Chen, Mingcheng Li, Yue Jiang, Xiaolu Hou, Lihua Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T13:10:27Z

**Summary**: Large Language Model (LLM)-driven interactive systems currently show potential promise in healthcare domains. Despite their remarkable capabilities, LLMs typically lack personalized recommendations and diagnosis analysis in sophisticated medical applications, causing hallucinations and performance bottlenecks. To address these challenges, this paper proposes MedAide, an LLM-based omni medical multi-agent collaboration framework for specialized healthcare services. Specifically, MedAide first performs query rewriting through retrieval-augmented generation to accomplish accurate medical intent understanding. Immediately, we devise a contextual encoder to obtain intent prototype embeddings, which are used to recognize fine-grained intents by similarity matching. According to the intent relevance, the activated agents collaborate effectively to provide integrated decision analysis. Extensive experiments are conducted on four medical benchmarks with composite intents. Experimental results from automated metrics and expert doctor evaluations show that MedAide outperforms current LLMs and improves their medical proficiency and strategic reasoning.

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T12:57:56Z

**Summary**: Despite the remarkable success of LLMs in English, there is a significant gap in performance in non-English languages. In order to address this, we introduce a novel recipe for creating a multilingual synthetic instruction tuning dataset, sPhinX, which is created by selectively translating instruction response pairs from English into 50 languages. We test the effectiveness of sPhinx by using it to fine-tune two state-of-the-art models, Mistral-7B and Phi-Small and then evaluating them across a comprehensive suite of multilingual benchmarks that test reasoning, question answering, reading comprehension and machine translation. Our results show that Mistral-7B and Phi-Small fine-tuned with sPhinX perform better on an average by 5%pt for both the models when compared to the base variants of these models. We also devise a strategy to incorporate N-shot examples in each fine-tuning sample which further boosts the performance of these models by 9%pt and 4%pt respectively respectively compared to vanilla fine-tuning. To show efficacy of our data curation approach, we also directly translate our original dataset to the target languages, and observe an increase of 7%pt and 4%pt on both the models respectively. sPhinX outperforms other multilingual instruction tuning datasets in both efficiency and diversity, reducing dataset creation costs. It also maintains strong performance on standard English LLM benchmarks, with minimal regression.

### FLEX: Expert-level False-Less EXecution Metric for Reliable Text-to-SQL   Benchmark
**Authors**: Heegyu Kim, Taeyang Jeon, Seunghwan Choi, Seungtaek Choi, Hyunsouk Cho

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T12:55:55Z

**Summary**: Text-to-SQL systems have become crucial for translating natural language into SQL queries in various industries, enabling non-technical users to perform complex data operations. The need for accurate evaluation methods has increased as these systems have grown more sophisticated. However, the Execution Accuracy (EX), the most prevalent evaluation metric, still shows many false positives and negatives. Thus, this paper introduces FLEX (False-Less EXecution), a novel approach to evaluating text-to-SQL systems using large language models (LLMs) to emulate human expert-level evaluation of SQL queries. Our metric improves agreement with human experts (from 62 to 87.04 in Cohen's kappa) with comprehensive context and sophisticated criteria. Our extensive experiments yield several key insights: (1) Models' performance increases by over 2.6 points on average, substantially affecting rankings on Spider and BIRD benchmarks; (2) The underestimation of models in EX primarily stems from annotation quality issues; and (3) Model performance on particularly challenging questions tends to be overestimated. This work contributes to a more accurate and nuanced evaluation of text-to-SQL systems, potentially reshaping our understanding of state-of-the-art performance in this field.

### RosePO: Aligning LLM-based Recommenders with Human Values
**Authors**: Jiayi Liao, Xiangnan He, Ruobing Xie, Jiancan Wu, Yancheng Yuan, Xingwu Sun, Zhanhui Kang, Xiang Wang

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T12:54:34Z

**Summary**: Recently, there has been a growing interest in leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for recommendation systems, which usually adapt a pre-trained LLM to the recommendation scenario through supervised fine-tuning (SFT). However, both the pre-training and SFT stages fail to explicitly model the comparative relationships of a user's preferences on different items. To construct a "helpful and harmless" LLM-based recommender, we propose a general framework -- Recommendation with smoothing personalized Preference Optimization (RosePO), which better aligns with customized human values during the post-training stage. Specifically, in addition to the input and chosen response that naturally align with SFT data, we design a rejected sampling strategy tailored for enhancing helpfulness, along with two strategies aimed at mitigating biases to promote harmlessness. To ensure robustness against uncertain labels present in automatically constructed preference data, we introduce a personalized smoothing factor predicted by a preference oracle into the optimization objective. Evaluation on three real-world datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of our method, showcasing not only improved recommendation performance but also mitigation of semantic hallucination and popularity bias.

### FiRST: Finetuning Router-Selective Transformers for Input-Adaptive   Latency Reduction
**Authors**: Akriti Jain, Saransh Sharma, Koyel Mukherjee, Soumyabrata Pal

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T12:45:35Z

**Summary**: Auto-regressive Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable performance across domanins such as vision and language processing. However, due to sequential processing through a stack of transformer layers, autoregressive decoding faces significant computation/latency challenges, particularly in resource constrained environments like mobile and edge devices. Existing approaches in literature that aim to improve latency via skipping layers have two distinct flavors - 1) Early exit 2) Input-agnostic heuristics where tokens exit at pre-determined layers irrespective of input sequence. Both the above strategies have limitations - the former cannot be applied to handle KV Caching necessary for speed-ups in modern framework and the latter does not capture the variation in layer importance across tasks or more generally, across input sequences. To address both limitations, we propose FIRST, an algorithm that reduces inference latency by using layer-specific routers to select a subset of transformer layers adaptively for each input sequence - the prompt (during prefill stage) decides which layers will be skipped during decoding. FIRST preserves compatibility with KV caching enabling faster inference while being quality-aware. FIRST is model-agnostic and can be easily enabled on any pre-trained LLM. We further improve performance by incorporating LoRA adapters for fine-tuning on external datasets, enhancing task-specific accuracy while maintaining latency benefits. Our approach reveals that input adaptivity is critical - indeed, different task-specific middle layers play a crucial role in evolving hidden representations depending on task. Extensive experiments show that FIRST significantly reduces latency while retaining competitive performance (as compared to baselines), making our approach an efficient solution for LLM deployment in low-resource environments.

### Benchmarking Defeasible Reasoning with Large Language Models -- Initial   Experiments and Future Directions
**Authors**: Ilias Tachmazidis, Sotiris Batsakis, Grigoris Antoniou

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T12:36:23Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained prominence in the AI landscape due to their exceptional performance. Thus, it is essential to gain a better understanding of their capabilities and limitations, among others in terms of nonmonotonic reasoning. This paper proposes a benchmark that corresponds to various defeasible rule-based reasoning patterns. We modified an existing benchmark for defeasible logic reasoners by translating defeasible rules into text suitable for LLMs. We conducted preliminary experiments on nonmonotonic rule-based reasoning using ChatGPT and compared it with reasoning patterns defined by defeasible logic.

### With a Grain of SALT: Are LLMs Fair Across Social Dimensions?
**Authors**: Samee Arif, Zohaib Khan, Agha Ali Raza, Awais Athar

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T12:22:47Z

**Summary**: This paper presents an analysis of biases in open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) across various genders, religions, and races. We introduce a methodology for generating a bias detection dataset using seven bias triggers: General Debate, Positioned Debate, Career Advice, Story Generation, Problem-Solving, Cover-Letter Writing, and CV Generation. We use GPT-4o to generate a diverse set of prompts for each trigger across various genders, religious and racial groups. We evaluate models from Llama and Gemma family on the generated dataset. We anonymise the LLM-generated text associated with each group using GPT-4o-mini and do a pairwise comparison using GPT-4o-as-a-Judge. To quantify bias in the LLM-generated text we use the number of wins and losses in the pairwise comparison. Our analysis spans three languages, English, German, and Arabic to explore how language influences bias manifestation. Our findings reveal that LLMs exhibit strong polarization toward certain groups across each category, with a notable consistency observed across models. However, when switching languages, variations and anomalies emerge, often attributable to cultural cues and contextual differences.

### Benchmarking LLMs for Translating Classical Chinese Poetry:Evaluating   Adequacy, Fluency, and Elegance
**Authors**: Andong Chen, Lianzhang Lou, Kehai Chen, Xuefeng Bai, Yang Xiang, Muyun Yang, Tiejun Zhao, Min Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-10-17T02:17:57Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in translation tasks. However, the increasing demand for high-quality translations that are not only adequate but also fluent and elegant. To evaluate the extent to which current LLMs can meet these demands, we introduce a suitable benchmark (PoetMT) for translating classical Chinese poetry into English. This task requires not only adequacy in translating culturally and historically significant content but also a strict adherence to linguistic fluency and poetic elegance. To overcome the limitations of traditional evaluation metrics, we propose an automatic evaluation metric based on GPT-4, which better evaluates translation quality in terms of adequacy, fluency, and elegance. Our evaluation study reveals that existing large language models fall short in this task. To evaluate these issues, we propose RAT, a Retrieval-Augmented machine Translation method that enhances the translation process by incorporating knowledge related to classical poetry. Our dataset and code will be made available.

### The Fellowship of the LLMs: Multi-Agent Workflows for Synthetic   Preference Optimization Dataset Generation
**Authors**: Samee Arif, Sualeha Farid, Abdul Hameed Azeemi, Awais Athar, Agha Ali Raza

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T12:15:19Z

**Summary**: This paper presents a novel methodology for generating synthetic Preference Optimization (PO) datasets using multi-agent workflows. We evaluate the effectiveness and potential of these workflows in automating and enhancing the dataset generation process. PO dataset generation requires two modules: (1) response evaluation, and (2) response generation. In the response evaluation module, the responses from Large Language Models (LLMs) are evaluated and ranked - a task typically carried out by human annotators that we automate using LLMs. We assess the response evaluation module in a 2 step process. In step 1, we assess LLMs as evaluators using three distinct prompting strategies. In step 2, we apply the winning prompting strategy to compare the performance of LLM-as-a-Judge, LLMs-as-a-Jury, and LLM Debate. Our evaluation shows that GPT-4o-as-a-Judge is more consistent across all datasets. For the response generation module, we use the identified LLM evaluator configuration and compare different configurations of the LLM Feedback Loop. We use the win rate to determine the best multi-agent configuration for generation. Experimenting with various configurations, we find that the LLM Feedback Loop, with Llama as the generator and Gemma as the reviewer, achieves a notable 71.8% and 73.8% win rate over single-agent Llama and Gemma, respectively. After identifying the best configurations for both modules, we generate our PO datasets using the above pipeline.

### End-to-end Planner Training for Language Modeling
**Authors**: Nathan Cornille, Florian Mai, Jingyuan Sun, Marie-Francine Moens

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T12:14:29Z

**Summary**: Through end-to-end training to predict the next token, LLMs have become valuable tools for various tasks. Enhancing their core training in language modeling can improve numerous downstream applications. A successful approach to enhance language modeling uses a separate planning module to predict abstract labels of future sentences and conditions the LM on these predictions. However, this method is non-differentiable, preventing joint end-to-end tuning of the planner with the LM. We propose an effective method to improve this approach by enabling joint fine-tuning of the planner and the LM. We show that a naive way of approximating the gradient of selecting a label via the straight-through estimator is not effective. Instead, we propose to use the predicted label probabilities as mixing weights to condition the LM on a weighted average of label embeddings in a differentiable manner. This not only enables joint fine-tuning of the planner and the LM, but also allows the LM to draw on the full label distribution predicted by the planner, retaining more information. Our experimental results show consistent improvements in perplexity.

### Insights from the Inverse: Reconstructing LLM Training Goals Through   Inverse RL
**Authors**: Jared Joselowitz, Arjun Jagota, Satyapriya Krishna, Sonali Parbhoo

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T12:14:25Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) trained with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, but their underlying reward functions and decision-making processes remain opaque. This paper introduces a novel approach to interpreting LLMs by applying inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) to recover their implicit reward functions. We conduct experiments on toxicity-aligned LLMs of varying sizes, extracting reward models that achieve up to 80.40% accuracy in predicting human preferences. Our analysis reveals key insights into the non-identifiability of reward functions, the relationship between model size and interpretability, and potential pitfalls in the RLHF process. We demonstrate that IRL-derived reward models can be used to fine-tune new LLMs, resulting in comparable or improved performance on toxicity benchmarks. This work provides a new lens for understanding and improving LLM alignment, with implications for the responsible development and deployment of these powerful systems.

### SAC-GLAM: Improving Online RL for LLM agents with Soft Actor-Critic and   Hindsight Relabeling
**Authors**: Loris Gaven, Clement Romac, Thomas Carta, Sylvain Lamprier, Olivier Sigaud, Pierre-Yves Oudeyer

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T11:59:27Z

**Summary**: The past years have seen Large Language Models (LLMs) strive not only as generative models but also as agents solving textual sequential decision-making tasks. When facing complex environments where their zero-shot abilities are insufficient, recent work showed online Reinforcement Learning (RL) could be used for the LLM agent to discover and learn efficient strategies interactively. However, most prior work sticks to on-policy algorithms, which greatly reduces the scope of methods such agents could use for both exploration and exploitation, such as experience replay and hindsight relabeling. Yet, such methods may be key for LLM learning agents, and in particular when designing autonomous intrinsically motivated agents sampling and pursuing their own goals (i.e. autotelic agents). This paper presents and studies an adaptation of Soft Actor-Critic and hindsight relabeling to LLM agents. Our method not only paves the path towards autotelic LLM agents that learn online but can also outperform on-policy methods in more classic multi-goal RL environments.

### KcMF: A Knowledge-compliant Framework for Schema and Entity Matching   with Fine-tuning-free LLMs
**Authors**: Yongqin Xu, Huan Li, Ke Chen, Lidan Shou

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T11:50:02Z

**Summary**: Schema and entity matching tasks are crucial for data integration and management. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promising results in these tasks, they suffer from hallucinations and confusion about task instructions. In this paper, we present the Knowledge-Compliant Matching Framework (KcMF), an LLM-based approach that addresses these issues without the need for domain-specific fine-tuning. KcMF employs a pseudo-code-based task decomposition strategy to adopt task-specific natural language statements that guide LLM reasoning and reduce confusion. We also propose two mechanisms, Dataset as Knowledge (DaK) and Example as Knowledge (EaK), to build domain knowledge sets when unstructured domain knowledge is lacking. Additionally, we introduce a result-ensembling strategy to leverage multiple knowledge sources and suppress poorly formatted outputs. Comprehensive evaluations on schema and entity matching tasks demonstrate that KcMF outperforms previous non-LLM state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods by an average F1 score of 22.9% and competes effectively with SOTA fine-tuned LLMs. Moreover, KcMF generalizes well across different LLMs.

### Beyond Instruction Following: Evaluating Inferential Rule Following of   Large Language Models
**Authors**: Wangtao Sun, Chenxiang Zhang, XueYou Zhang, Xuanqing Yu, Ziyang Huang, Pei Chen, Haotian Xu, Shizhu He, Jun Zhao, Kang Liu

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T11:49:48Z

**Summary**: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong ability, they are further supposed to be controlled and guided by in real-world scenarios to be safe, accurate, and intelligent. This demands the possession of capability of LLMs. However, no prior work has made a clear evaluation of the inferential rule-following capability of LLMs. Previous studies that try to evaluate the inferential rule-following capability of LLMs fail to distinguish the inferential rule-following scenarios from the instruction-following scenarios. Therefore, this paper first clarifies the concept of inferential rule-following and proposes a comprehensive benchmark, RuleBench, to evaluate a diversified range of inferential rule-following abilities. Our experimental results on a variety of LLMs show that they are still limited in following rules. Our analysis based on the evaluation results provides insights into the improvements for LLMs toward a better inferential rule-following intelligent agent. We further propose Inferential Rule-Following Tuning (IRFT). The experimental results show that through IRFT, LLMs can learn abstract rule-following abilities from purely synthetic data and then generalize to RuleBench. The data and code can be found at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/llm-rule-following-B3E3/

### Guardian: Safe GPU Sharing in Multi-Tenant Environments
**Authors**: Manos Pavlidakis, Giorgos Vasiliadis, Stelios Mavridis, Anargyros Argyros, Antony Chazapis, Angelos Bilas

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T11:49:14Z

**Summary**: Modern GPU applications, such as machine learning (ML), can only partially utilize GPUs, leading to GPU underutilization in cloud environments. Sharing GPUs across multiple applications from different tenants can improve resource utilization and consequently cost, energy, and power efficiency. However, GPU sharing creates memory safety concerns because kernels must share a single GPU address space. Existing spatial-sharing mechanisms either lack fault isolation for memory accesses or require static partitioning, which leads to limited deployability or low utilization.   In this paper, we present Guardian, a PTX-level bounds checking approach that provides memory isolation and supports dynamic GPU spatial-sharing. Guardian relies on three mechanisms: (1) It divides the common GPU address space into separate partitions for different applications. (2) It intercepts and checks all GPU related calls at the lowest level, fencing erroneous operations. (3) It instruments all GPU kernels at the PTX level -- available in closed GPU libraries -- fencing all kernel memory accesses outside application memory bounds. Guardian's approach is transparent to applications and supports real-life frameworks, such as Caffe and PyTorch, that issue billions of GPU kernels. Our evaluation shows that Guardian's overhead compared to native for such frameworks is between 4% - 12% and on average 9%.

### MlingConf: A Comprehensive Study of Multilingual Confidence Estimation   on Large Language Models
**Authors**: Boyang Xue, Hongru Wang, Rui Wang, Sheng Wang, Zezhong Wang, Yiming Du, Bin Liang, Kam-Fai Wong

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T11:46:55Z

**Summary**: The tendency of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate hallucinations raises concerns regarding their reliability. Therefore, confidence estimations indicating the extent of trustworthiness of the generations become essential. However, current LLM confidence estimations in languages other than English remain underexplored. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a comprehensive investigation of Multilingual Confidence estimation (MlingConf) on LLMs, focusing on both language-agnostic (LA) and language-specific (LS) tasks to explore the performance and language dominance effects of multilingual confidence estimations on different tasks. The benchmark comprises four meticulously checked and human-evaluate high-quality multilingual datasets for LA tasks and one for the LS task tailored to specific social, cultural, and geographical contexts of a language. Our experiments reveal that on LA tasks English exhibits notable linguistic dominance in confidence estimations than other languages, while on LS tasks, using question-related language to prompt LLMs demonstrates better linguistic dominance in multilingual confidence estimations. The phenomena inspire a simple yet effective native-tone prompting strategy by employing language-specific prompts for LS tasks, effectively improving LLMs' reliability and accuracy on LS tasks.

### Retrieval-Reasoning Large Language Model-based Synthetic Clinical Trial   Generation
**Authors**: Zerui Xu, Fang Wu, Tianfan Fu, Yue Zhao

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T11:46:32Z

**Summary**: Machine learning (ML) exhibits promise in the clinical domain. However, it is constrained by data scarcity and ethical considerations, as the generation of clinical trials presents significant challenges due to stringent privacy regulations, high costs, and the extended duration required for conducting studies with human participants. Despite the advancements of large language models (LLMs) in general generation tasks, their potential in facilitating the generation of synthetic clinical trials is under-explored. To address this gap, we introduce a novel Retrieval-Reasoning few-shot framework that leverages LLMs to generate artificial yet realistic and diverse clinical trials with binary success/failure labels. Experiments conducted on real clinical trials from the \url{ClinicalTrials.gov} database demonstrate that our synthetic data can effectively augment real datasets. Furthermore, by fine-tuning a pre-trained model as a binary classifier on synthetic clinical trial datasets, we demonstrate that this augmentation enhances model training for downstream tasks such as trial outcome prediction. Our findings suggest that LLMs for synthetic clinical trial generation hold promise for accelerating clinical research and upholding ethical standards for patient privacy. The code is publicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Retrieval_Reasoning_Clinical_Trial_Generation-3EC4.

**Authors**: Leo Kohlenberg, Leonard Horns, Frederic Sadrieh, Nils Kiele, Matthis Clausen, Konstantin Ketterer, Avetis Navasardyan, Tamara Czinczoll, Gerard de Melo, Ralf Herbrich

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T11:34:33Z

**Summary**: Annotating large datasets can be challenging. However, crowd-sourcing is often expensive and can lack quality, especially for non-trivial tasks. We propose a method of using LLMs as few-shot learners for annotating data in a complex natural language task where we learn a standalone model to predict usage options for products from customer reviews. We also propose a new evaluation metric for this scenario, HAMS4, that can be used to compare a set of strings with multiple reference sets. Learning a custom model offers individual control over energy efficiency and privacy measures compared to using the LLM directly for the sequence-to-sequence task. We compare this data annotation approach with other traditional methods and demonstrate how LLMs can enable considerable cost savings. We find that the quality of the resulting data exceeds the level attained by third-party vendor services and that GPT-4-generated labels even reach the level of domain experts. We make the code and generated labels publicly available.

### Evaluating Software Development Agents: Patch Patterns, Code Quality,   and Issue Complexity in Real-World GitHub Scenarios
**Authors**: Zhi Chen, Lingxiao Jiang

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T11:33:57Z

**Summary**: In recent years, AI-based software engineering has progressed from pre-trained models to advanced agentic workflows, with Software Development Agents representing the next major leap. These agents, capable of reasoning, planning, and interacting with external environments, offer promising solutions to complex software engineering tasks. However, while much research has evaluated code generated by large language models (LLMs), comprehensive studies on agent-generated patches, particularly in real-world settings, are lacking. This study addresses that gap by evaluating 4,892 patches from 10 top-ranked agents on 500 real-world GitHub issues from SWE-Bench Verified, focusing on their impact on code quality. Our analysis shows no single agent dominated, with 170 issues unresolved, indicating room for improvement. Even for patches that passed unit tests and resolved issues, agents made different file and function modifications compared to the gold patches from repository developers, revealing limitations in the benchmark's test case coverage. Most agents maintained code reliability and security, avoiding new bugs or vulnerabilities; while some agents increased code complexity, many reduced code duplication and minimized code smells. Finally, agents performed better on simpler codebases, suggesting that breaking complex tasks into smaller sub-tasks could improve effectiveness. This study provides the first comprehensive evaluation of agent-generated patches on real-world GitHub issues, offering insights to advance AI-driven software development.

### Enhancing LLM Trading Performance with Fact-Subjectivity Aware Reasoning
**Authors**: Qian Wang, Yuchen Gao, Zhenheng Tang, Bingqiao Luo, Bingsheng He

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T11:25:13Z

**Summary**: While many studies prove more advanced LLMs perform better on tasks such as math and trading, we notice that in cryptocurrency trading, stronger LLMs work worse than weaker LLMs often. To study how this counter-intuitive phenomenon occurs, we examine the LLM reasoning processes on making trading decisions. We find that separating the reasoning process into factual and subjective components can lead to higher profits. Building on this insight, we introduce a multi-agent framework, FS-ReasoningAgent, which enables LLMs to recognize and learn from both factual and subjective reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this framework enhances LLM trading performance in cryptocurrency markets. Additionally, an ablation study reveals that relying on subjective news tends to generate higher returns in bull markets, whereas focusing on factual information yields better results in bear markets. Our code and data are available at \url{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/FS-ReasoningAgent-B55F/}.

### Bridging the Language Gaps in Large Language Models with Inference-Time   Cross-Lingual Intervention
**Authors**: Weixuan Wang, Minghao Wu, Barry Haddow, Alexandra Birch

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T11:23:03Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in natural language processing but exhibit significant performance gaps among different languages. Most existing approaches to address these disparities rely on pretraining or fine-tuning, which are resource-intensive. To overcome these limitations without incurring significant costs, we propose Inference-Time Cross-Lingual Intervention (INCLINE), a novel framework that enhances LLM performance on low-performing (source) languages by aligning their internal representations with those of high-performing (target) languages during inference. INCLINE initially learns alignment matrices using parallel sentences from source and target languages through a Least-Squares optimization, and then applies these matrices during inference to transform the low-performing language representations toward the high-performing language space. Extensive experiments on nine benchmarks with five LLMs demonstrate that INCLINE significantly improves performance across diverse tasks and languages, compared to recent strong baselines. Our analysis demonstrates that INCLINE is highly cost-effective and applicable to a wide range of applications. In addition, we release the code to foster research along this line: https://github.com/weixuan-wang123/INCLINE.

### The Best of Both Worlds: Bridging Quality and Diversity in Data   Selection with Bipartite Graph
**Authors**: Minghao Wu, Thuy-Trang Vu, Lizhen Qu, Gholamreza Haffari

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T11:16:34Z

**Summary**: The performance of large language models (LLMs) in natural language processing (NLP) tasks is significantly influenced by the quality and diversity of data used for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Current data selection methods often focus solely on quality or diversity, leading to underperforming models due to suboptimal training data. In this paper, we introduce GraphFilter, a novel method that represents the dataset as a bipartite graph, linking sentences to their constituent n-grams. This representation effectively captures the relationships between sentences and linguistic patterns, facilitating the selection of sentences that enhance n-gram diversity. To balance quality and diversity during selection, we propose a priority function that combines the quality metric with the diversity metric in a multiplicative manner. GraphFilter iteratively selects high-priority sentences, updates the bipartite graph by removing covered n-grams, and re-calculates priorities to reflect the evolving data landscape. We conduct extensive experiments using three model backbones across six widely used benchmarks. The results demonstrate that GraphFilter outperforms all nine baseline approaches, achieving superior model performance and computational efficiency. Our analyses validate the effectiveness of our design choices, examine the subsets selected by GraphFilter and other methods, highlight the importance of instruction diversity, and explore the role of quality and diversity in relation to subset sizes. GraphFilter establishes a new foundation for effective data selection strategies, encouraging further research in data selection for LLMs.

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T10:56:24Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made tremendous strides in code generation, but existing research fails to account for the dynamic nature of software development, marked by frequent library updates. This gap significantly limits LLMs' deployment in realistic settings. In this paper, we propose two novel tasks aimed at bridging this gap: version-specific code completion (VSCC) and version-aware code migration (VACM). In conjunction, we introduce VersiCode, a comprehensive Python dataset specifically designed to evaluate LLMs on these two tasks, together with a novel evaluation metric, Critical Diff Check (CDC@1), which assesses code generation against evolving API requirements. We conduct an extensive evaluation on VersiCode, which reveals that version-controllable code generation is indeed a significant challenge, even for GPT-4o and other strong frontier models. We believe the novel tasks, dataset, and metric open up a new, important research direction that will further enhance LLMs' real-world applicability. The code and resources can be found at https://github.com/wutong8023/VersiCode.

### Open Ko-LLM Leaderboard2: Bridging Foundational and Practical Evaluation   for Korean LLMs
**Authors**: Hyeonwoo Kim, Dahyun Kim, Jihoo Kim, Sukyung Lee, Yungi Kim, Chanjun Park

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T10:49:22Z

**Summary**: The Open Ko-LLM Leaderboard has been instrumental in benchmarking Korean Large Language Models (LLMs), yet it has certain limitations. Notably, the disconnect between quantitative improvements on the overly academic leaderboard benchmarks and the qualitative impact of the models should be addressed. Furthermore, the benchmark suite is largely composed of translated versions of their English counterparts, which may not fully capture the intricacies of the Korean language. To address these issues, we propose Open Ko-LLM Leaderboard2, an improved version of the earlier Open Ko-LLM Leaderboard. The original benchmarks are entirely replaced with new tasks that are more closely aligned with real-world capabilities. Additionally, four new native Korean benchmarks are introduced to better reflect the distinct characteristics of the Korean language. Through these refinements, Open Ko-LLM Leaderboard2 seeks to provide a more meaningful evaluation for advancing Korean LLMs.

### Expanding Chatbot Knowledge in Customer Service: Context-Aware Similar   Question Generation Using Large Language Models
**Authors**: Mengze Hong, Yuanfeng Song, Di Jiang, Lu Wang, Zichang Guo, Chen Jason Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T10:48:14Z

**Summary**: Reliable responses of service chatbots are often achieved by employing retrieval-based methods that restrict answers to a knowledge base comprising predefined question-answer pairs (QA pairs). To accommodate potential variations in how a customer's query may be expressed, it emerges as the favored solution to augment these QA pairs with similar questions that are possibly diverse while remaining semantic consistency. This augmentation task is known as Similar Question Generation (SQG). Traditional methods that heavily rely on human efforts or rule-based techniques suffer from limited diversity or significant semantic deviation from the source question, only capable of producing a finite number of useful questions.   To address these limitations, we propose an SQG approach based on Large Language Models (LLMs), capable of producing a substantial number of diverse questions while maintaining semantic consistency to the source QA pair. This is achieved by leveraging LLMs' natural language understanding capability through fine-tuning with specially designed prompts. The experiments conducted on a real customer-service dataset demonstrate that our method surpasses baseline methods by a significant margin in terms of semantic diversity. Human evaluation further confirms that integrating the answer that reflects the customer's intention is crucial for increasing the number of generated questions that meet business requirements.

### Reconstruction of Differentially Private Text Sanitization via Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Shuchao Pang, Zhigang Lu, Haichen Wang, Peng Fu, Yongbin Zhou, Minhui Xue, Bo Li

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T10:41:17Z

**Summary**: Differential privacy (DP) is the de facto privacy standard against privacy leakage attacks, including many recently discovered ones against large language models (LLMs). However, we discovered that LLMs could reconstruct the altered/removed privacy from given DP-sanitized prompts. We propose two attacks (black-box and white-box) based on the accessibility to LLMs and show that LLMs could connect the pair of DP-sanitized text and the corresponding private training data of LLMs by giving sample text pairs as instructions (in the black-box attacks) or fine-tuning data (in the white-box attacks). To illustrate our findings, we conduct comprehensive experiments on modern LLMs (e.g., LLaMA-2, LLaMA-3, ChatGPT-3.5, ChatGPT-4, ChatGPT-4o, Claude-3, Claude-3.5, OPT, GPT-Neo, GPT-J, Gemma-2, and Pythia) using commonly used datasets (such as WikiMIA, Pile-CC, and Pile-Wiki) against both word-level and sentence-level DP. The experimental results show promising recovery rates, e.g., the black-box attacks against the word-level DP over WikiMIA dataset gave 72.18% on LLaMA-2 (70B), 82.39% on LLaMA-3 (70B), 75.35% on Gemma-2, 91.2% on ChatGPT-4o, and 94.01% on Claude-3.5 (Sonnet). More urgently, this study indicates that these well-known LLMs have emerged as a new security risk for existing DP text sanitization approaches in the current environment.

### Revisiting Benchmark and Assessment: An Agent-based Exploratory Dynamic   Evaluation Framework for LLMs
**Authors**: Wanying Wang, Zeyu Ma, Pengfei Liu, Mingang Chen

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T10:36:18Z

**Summary**: While various vertical domain large language models (LLMs) have been developed, the challenge of automatically evaluating their performance across different domains remains significant. Current benchmark-based evaluation methods exhibit rigid, aimless interactions and rely on pre-collected static datasets that are costly to build, inflexible across domains, and misaligned with practical user needs. To address this issue, we revisit the evaluation components and introduce two concepts: Benchmark+, which extends traditional question-answer benchmark into a more flexible "strategy-criterion" format; and Assessment+, which enhances the interaction process, enabling deeper exploration and supporting both quantitative metrics and qualitative insights. These concepts capture the nuanced behaviors of LLMs through richer, multi-turn interactions. We propose an agent-based evaluation framework called TestAgent, which implements these concepts through retrieval augmented generation and reinforcement learning. Experiments on tasks ranging from constructing vertical domain evaluation to activating existing benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of TestAgent across various scenarios. We believe this work offers an interesting perspective on automatic evaluation for LLMs.

### On Large Uni- and Multi-modal Models for Unsupervised Classification of   Social Media Images: Nature's Contribution to People as a case study
**Authors**: Rohaifa Khaldi, Domingo Alcaraz-Segura, Ignacio Sánchez-Herrera, Javier Martinez-Lopez, Carlos Javier Navarro, Siham Tabik

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T10:27:14Z

**Summary**: Social media images have proven to be a valuable source of information for understanding human interactions with important subjects such as cultural heritage, biodiversity, and nature, among others. The task of grouping such images into a number of semantically meaningful clusters without labels is challenging due to the high diversity and complex nature of the visual content in addition to their large volume. On the other hand, recent advances in Large Visual Models (LVMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) provide an important opportunity to explore new productive and scalable solutions. This work proposes, analyzes, and compares various approaches based on one or more state-of-the-art LVM, LLM, and LVLM, for mapping social media images into a number of predefined classes. As a case study, we consider the problem of understanding the interactions between humans and nature, also known as Nature's Contribution to People or Cultural Ecosystem Services (CES). Our experiments show that the highest-performing approaches, with accuracy above 95%, still require the creation of a small labeled dataset. These include the fine-tuned LVM DINOv2 and the LVLM LLaVA-1.5 combined with a fine-tuned LLM. The top fully unsupervised approaches, achieving accuracy above 84%, are the LVLMs, specifically the proprietary GPT-4 model and the public LLaVA-1.5 model. Additionally, the LVM DINOv2, when applied in a 10-shot learning setup, delivered competitive results with an accuracy of 83.99%, closely matching the performance of the LVLM LLaVA-1.5.

### LoraMap: Harnessing the Power of LoRA Connections
**Authors**: Hyeryun Park, Jeongwon Kwak, Dongsuk Jang, Sumin Park, Jinwook Choi

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T10:19:45Z

**Summary**: Fact-checking techniques can mitigate hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs), a prominent issue in specialized domains. As parameter-efficient techniques such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) can overcome substantial computational overhead, some studies have explored the integration of multiple LoRAs. While previous studies focus on parallel integration, this paper investigates methods to establish connections among multiple LoRAs. We create three reasoning datasets tailored to fact-checking and fine-tune individual LoRAs, allowing them to view and reason from diverse perspectives. Then, we explore strategies for allocating these reasoning LoRAs and introduce LoraMap, an approach to map connections between them. The results of the fact-checking task demonstrate that the performance of LoraMap is superior to LoraHub, an existing method for integrating LoRAs. LoraMap also outperforms with significantly fewer trainable parameters than LoraConcat, which concatenates LoRAs and further fine-tunes them.

### Conformity in Large Language Models
**Authors**: Xiaochen Zhu, Caiqi Zhang, Tom Stafford, Nigel Collier, Andreas Vlachos

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T10:16:34Z

**Summary**: The conformity effect describes the tendency of individuals to align their responses with the majority. Studying this bias in large language models (LLMs) is crucial, as LLMs are increasingly used in various information-seeking and decision-making tasks as conversation partners to improve productivity. Thus, conformity to incorrect responses can compromise their effectiveness. In this paper, we adapt psychological experiments to examine the extent of conformity in state-of-the-art LLMs. Our findings reveal that all models tested exhibit varying levels of conformity toward the majority, regardless of their initial choice or correctness, across different knowledge domains. Notably, we are the first to show that LLMs are more likely to conform when they are more uncertain in their own prediction. We further explore factors that influence conformity, such as training paradigms and input characteristics, finding that instruction-tuned models are less susceptible to conformity, while increasing the naturalness of majority tones amplifies conformity. Finally, we propose two interventions--Devil's Advocate and Question Distillation--to mitigate conformity, providing insights into building more robust language models.

**Authors**: Gleb Kuzmin, Petr Strepetov, Maksim Stankevich, Artem Shelmanov, Ivan Smirnov

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T10:14:54Z

**Summary**: This paper compares the effectiveness of traditional machine learning methods, encoder-based models, and large language models (LLMs) on the task of detecting depression and anxiety. Five datasets were considered, each differing in format and the method used to define the target pathology class. We tested AutoML models based on linguistic features, several variations of encoder-based Transformers such as BERT, and state-of-the-art LLMs as pathology classification models. The results demonstrated that LLMs outperform traditional methods, particularly on noisy and small datasets where training examples vary significantly in text length and genre. However, psycholinguistic features and encoder-based models can achieve performance comparable to language models when trained on texts from individuals with clinically confirmed depression, highlighting their potential effectiveness in targeted clinical applications.

**Authors**: Arun N. Sivakumar, Federico Magistri, Mateus V. Gasparino, Jens Behley, Cyrill Stachniss, Girish Chowdhary

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T09:52:38Z

**Summary**: Under-canopy agricultural robots can enable various applications like precise monitoring, spraying, weeding, and plant manipulation tasks throughout the growing season. Autonomous navigation under the canopy is challenging due to the degradation in accuracy of RTK-GPS and the large variability in the visual appearance of the scene over time. In prior work, we developed a supervised learning-based perception system with semantic keypoint representation and deployed this in various field conditions. A large number of failures of this system can be attributed to the inability of the perception model to adapt to the domain shift encountered during deployment. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised online adaptation method for adapting the semantic keypoint representation using a visual foundational model, geometric prior, and pseudo labeling. Our preliminary experiments show that with minimal data and fine-tuning of parameters, the keypoint prediction model trained with labels on the source domain can be adapted in a self-supervised manner to various challenging target domains onboard the robot computer using our method. This can enable fully autonomous row-following capability in under-canopy robots across fields and crops without requiring human intervention.

### Free Video-LLM: Prompt-guided Visual Perception for Efficient   Training-free Video LLMs
**Authors**: Kai Han, Jianyuan Guo, Yehui Tang, Wei He, Enhua Wu, Yunhe Wang

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T09:45:06Z

**Summary**: Vision-language large models have achieved remarkable success in various multi-modal tasks, yet applying them to video understanding remains challenging due to the inherent complexity and computational demands of video data. While training-based video-LLMs deliver high performance, they often require substantial resources for training and inference. Conversely, training-free approaches offer a more efficient alternative by adapting pre-trained image-LLMs models for video tasks without additional training, but they face inference efficiency bottlenecks due to the large number of visual tokens generated from video frames. In this work, we present a novel prompt-guided visual perception framework (abbreviated as Free Video-LLM) for efficient inference of training-free video LLMs. The proposed framework decouples spatial-temporal dimension and performs temporal frame sampling and spatial RoI cropping respectively based on task-specific prompts. Our method effectively reduces the number of visual tokens while maintaining high performance across multiple video question-answering benchmarks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive results with significantly fewer tokens, offering an optimal trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art video LLMs. The code will be available at https://github.com/contrastive/FreeVideoLLM.

### Revealing the Barriers of Language Agents in Planning
**Authors**: Jian Xie, Kexun Zhang, Jiangjie Chen, Siyu Yuan, Kai Zhang, Yikai Zhang, Lei Li, Yanghua Xiao

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T09:44:38Z

**Summary**: Autonomous planning has been an ongoing pursuit since the inception of artificial intelligence. Based on curated problem solvers, early planning agents could deliver precise solutions for specific tasks but lacked generalization. The emergence of large language models (LLMs) and their powerful reasoning capabilities has reignited interest in autonomous planning by automatically generating reasonable solutions for given tasks. However, prior research and our experiments show that current language agents still lack human-level planning abilities. Even the state-of-the-art reasoning model, OpenAI o1, achieves only 15.6% on one of the complex real-world planning benchmarks. This highlights a critical question: What hinders language agents from achieving human-level planning? Although existing studies have highlighted weak performance in agent planning, the deeper underlying issues and the mechanisms and limitations of the strategies proposed to address them remain insufficiently understood. In this work, we apply the feature attribution study and identify two key factors that hinder agent planning: the limited role of constraints and the diminishing influence of questions. We also find that although current strategies help mitigate these challenges, they do not fully resolve them, indicating that agents still have a long way to go before reaching human-level intelligence.

### ProSA: Assessing and Understanding the Prompt Sensitivity of LLMs
**Authors**: Jingming Zhuo, Songyang Zhang, Xinyu Fang, Haodong Duan, Dahua Lin, Kai Chen

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T09:38:13Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across various tasks, but their performance is highly sensitive to the prompts utilized. This variability poses challenges for accurate assessment and user satisfaction. Current research frequently overlooks instance-level prompt variations and their implications on subjective evaluations. To address these shortcomings, we introduce ProSA, a framework designed to evaluate and comprehend prompt sensitivity in LLMs. ProSA incorporates a novel sensitivity metric, PromptSensiScore, and leverages decoding confidence to elucidate underlying mechanisms. Our extensive study, spanning multiple tasks, uncovers that prompt sensitivity fluctuates across datasets and models, with larger models exhibiting enhanced robustness. We observe that few-shot examples can alleviate this sensitivity issue, and subjective evaluations are also susceptible to prompt sensitivities, particularly in complex, reasoning-oriented tasks. Furthermore, our findings indicate that higher model confidence correlates with increased prompt robustness. We believe this work will serve as a helpful tool in studying prompt sensitivity of LLMs. The project is released at: https://github.com/open-compass/ProSA .

**Authors**: Jinliang Zheng, Jianxiong Li, Sijie Cheng, Yinan Zheng, Jiaming Li, Jihao Liu, Yu Liu, Jingjing Liu, Xianyuan Zhan

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T09:28:22Z

**Summary**: Instruction following is crucial in contemporary LLM. However, when extended to multimodal setting, it often suffers from misalignment between specific textual instruction and targeted local region of an image. To achieve more accurate and nuanced multimodal instruction following, we introduce Instruction-guided Visual Masking (IVM), a new versatile visual grounding model that is compatible with diverse multimodal models, such as LMM and robot model. By constructing visual masks for instruction-irrelevant regions, IVM-enhanced multimodal models can effectively focus on task-relevant image regions to better align with complex instructions. Specifically, we design a visual masking data generation pipeline and create an IVM-Mix-1M dataset with 1 million image-instruction pairs. We further introduce a new learning technique, Discriminator Weighted Supervised Learning (DWSL) for preferential IVM training that prioritizes high-quality data samples. Experimental results on generic multimodal tasks such as VQA and embodied robotic control demonstrate the versatility of IVM, which as a plug-and-play tool, significantly boosts the performance of diverse multimodal models, yielding new state-of-the-art results across challenging multimodal benchmarks. Code, model and data are available at https://github.com/2toinf/IVM.

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T09:18:58Z

**Summary**: The adoption of large language models (LLMs) to assist clinicians has attracted remarkable attention. Existing works mainly adopt the close-ended question-answering (QA) task with answer options for evaluation. However, many clinical decisions involve answering open-ended questions without pre-set options. To better understand LLMs in the clinic, we construct a benchmark ClinicBench. We first collect eleven existing datasets covering diverse clinical language generation, understanding, and reasoning tasks. Furthermore, we construct six novel datasets and clinical tasks that are complex but common in real-world practice, e.g., open-ended decision-making, long document processing, and emerging drug analysis. We conduct an extensive evaluation of twenty-two LLMs under both zero-shot and few-shot settings. Finally, we invite medical experts to evaluate the clinical usefulness of LLMs. The benchmark data is available at https://github.com/AI-in-Health/ClinicBench.

**Authors**: Zongqian Li, Yinhong Liu, Yixuan Su, Nigel Collier

**Updated**: 2024-10-17T04:09:09Z

**Summary**: Leveraging large language models (LLMs) for complex natural language tasks typically requires long-form prompts to convey detailed requirements and information, which results in increased memory usage and inference costs. To mitigate these challenges, multiple efficient methods have been proposed, with prompt compression gaining significant research interest. This survey provides an overview of prompt compression techniques, categorized into hard prompt methods and soft prompt methods. First, the technical approaches of these methods are compared, followed by an exploration of various ways to understand their mechanisms, including the perspectives of attention optimization, Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), modality integration, and new synthetic language. We also examine the downstream adaptations of various prompt compression techniques. Finally, the limitations of current prompt compression methods are analyzed, and several future directions are outlined, such as optimizing the compression encoder, combining hard and soft prompts methods, and leveraging insights from multimodality.

### HumanEval-V: Evaluating Visual Understanding and Reasoning Abilities of   Large Multimodal Models Through Coding Tasks
**Authors**: Fengji Zhang, Linquan Wu, Huiyu Bai, Guancheng Lin, Xiao Li, Xiao Yu, Yue Wang, Bei Chen, Jacky Keung

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T09:04:57Z

**Summary**: Coding tasks have been valuable for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs), as they demand the comprehension of high-level instructions, complex reasoning, and the implementation of functional programs -- core capabilities for advancing Artificial General Intelligence. Despite the progress in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), which extend LLMs with visual perception and understanding capabilities, there remains a notable lack of coding benchmarks that rigorously assess these models, particularly in tasks that emphasize visual reasoning. To address this gap, we introduce HumanEval-V, a novel and lightweight benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LMMs' visual understanding and reasoning capabilities through code generation. HumanEval-V includes 108 carefully crafted, entry-level Python coding tasks derived from platforms like CodeForces and Stack Overflow. Each task is adapted by modifying the context and algorithmic patterns of the original problems, with visual elements redrawn to ensure distinction from the source, preventing potential data leakage. LMMs are required to complete the code solution based on the provided visual context and a predefined Python function signature outlining the task requirements. Every task is equipped with meticulously handcrafted test cases to ensure a thorough and reliable evaluation of model-generated solutions. We evaluate 19 state-of-the-art LMMs using HumanEval-V, uncovering significant challenges. Proprietary models like GPT-4o achieve only 13% pass@1 and 36.4% pass@10, while open-weight models with 70B parameters score below 4% pass@1. Ablation studies further reveal the limitations of current LMMs in vision reasoning and coding capabilities. These results underscore key areas for future research to enhance LMMs' capabilities. We have open-sourced our code and benchmark at https://github.com/HumanEval-V/HumanEval-V-Benchmark.

**Authors**: Zexuan Qiu, Jingjing Li, Shijue Huang, Xiaoqi Jiao, Wanjun Zhong, Irwin King

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T08:59:22Z

**Summary**: Developing Large Language Models (LLMs) with robust long-context capabilities has been the recent research focus, resulting in the emergence of long-context LLMs proficient in Chinese. However, the evaluation of these models remains underdeveloped due to a lack of benchmarks. To address this gap, we present CLongEval, a comprehensive Chinese benchmark for evaluating long-context LLMs. CLongEval is characterized by three key features: (1) Sufficient data volume, comprising 7 distinct tasks and 7,267 examples; (2) Broad applicability, accommodating to models with context windows size from 1K to 100K; (3) High quality, with over 2,000 manually annotated question-answer pairs in addition to the automatically constructed labels. With CLongEval, we undertake a comprehensive assessment of 6 open-source long-context LLMs and 2 leading commercial counterparts that feature both long-context abilities and proficiency in Chinese. We also provide in-depth analysis based on the empirical results, trying to shed light on the critical capabilities that present challenges in long-context settings. The dataset, evaluation scripts, and model outputs are released.

### Evaluation of Attribution Bias in Retrieval-Augmented Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Amin Abolghasemi, Leif Azzopardi, Seyyed Hadi Hashemi, Maarten de Rijke, Suzan Verberne

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T08:55:49Z

**Summary**: Attributing answers to source documents is an approach used to enhance the verifiability of a model's output in retrieval augmented generation (RAG). Prior work has mainly focused on improving and evaluating the attribution quality of large language models (LLMs) in RAG, but this may come at the expense of inducing biases in the attribution of answers. We define and examine two aspects in the evaluation of LLMs in RAG pipelines, namely attribution sensitivity and bias with respect to authorship information. We explicitly inform an LLM about the authors of source documents, instruct it to attribute its answers, and analyze (i) how sensitive the LLM's output is to the author of source documents, and (ii) whether the LLM exhibits a bias towards human-written or AI-generated source documents. We design an experimental setup in which we use counterfactual evaluation to study three LLMs in terms of their attribution sensitivity and bias in RAG pipelines. Our results show that adding authorship information to source documents can significantly change the attribution quality of LLMs by 3% to 18%. Moreover, we show that LLMs can have an attribution bias towards explicit human authorship, which can serve as a competing hypothesis for findings of prior work that shows that LLM-generated content may be preferred over human-written contents. Our findings indicate that metadata of source documents can influence LLMs' trust, and how they attribute their answers. Furthermore, our research highlights attribution bias and sensitivity as a novel aspect of brittleness in LLMs.

### HerO at AVeriTeC: The Herd of Open Large Language Models for Verifying   Real-World Claims
**Authors**: Yejun Yoon, Jaeyoon Jung, Seunghyun Yoon, Kunwoo Park

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T08:49:17Z

**Summary**: To tackle the AVeriTeC shared task hosted by the FEVER-24, we introduce a system that only employs publicly available large language models (LLMs) for each step of automated fact-checking, dubbed the Herd of Open LLMs for verifying real-world claims (HerO). HerO employs multiple LLMs for each step of automated fact-checking. For evidence retrieval, a language model is used to enhance a query by generating hypothetical fact-checking documents. We prompt pretrained and fine-tuned LLMs for question generation and veracity prediction by crafting prompts with retrieved in-context samples. HerO achieved 2nd place on the leaderboard with the AVeriTeC score of 0.57, suggesting the potential of open LLMs for verifying real-world claims. For future research, we make our code publicly available at https://github.com/ssu-humane/HerO.

### ShapefileGPT: A Multi-Agent Large Language Model Framework for Automated   Shapefile Processing
**Authors**: Qingming Lin, Rui Hu, Huaxia Li, Sensen Wu, Yadong Li, Kai Fang, Hailin Feng, Zhenhong Du, Liuchang Xu

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T08:48:27Z

**Summary**: Vector data is one of the two core data structures in geographic information science (GIS), essential for accurately storing and representing geospatial information. Shapefile, the most widely used vector data format, has become the industry standard supported by all major geographic information systems. However, processing this data typically requires specialized GIS knowledge and skills, creating a barrier for researchers from other fields and impeding interdisciplinary research in spatial data analysis. Moreover, while large language models (LLMs) have made significant advancements in natural language processing and task automation, they still face challenges in handling the complex spatial and topological relationships inherent in GIS vector data. To address these challenges, we propose ShapefileGPT, an innovative framework powered by LLMs, specifically designed to automate Shapefile tasks. ShapefileGPT utilizes a multi-agent architecture, in which the planner agent is responsible for task decomposition and supervision, while the worker agent executes the tasks. We developed a specialized function library for handling Shapefiles and provided comprehensive API documentation, enabling the worker agent to operate Shapefiles efficiently through function calling. For evaluation, we developed a benchmark dataset based on authoritative textbooks, encompassing tasks in categories such as geometric operations and spatial queries. ShapefileGPT achieved a task success rate of 95.24%, outperforming the GPT series models. In comparison to traditional LLMs, ShapefileGPT effectively handles complex vector data analysis tasks, overcoming the limitations of traditional LLMs in spatial analysis. This breakthrough opens new pathways for advancing automation and intelligence in the GIS field, with significant potential in interdisciplinary data analysis and application contexts.

### PRefLexOR: Preference-based Recursive Language Modeling for Exploratory   Optimization of Reasoning and Agentic Thinking
**Authors**: Markus J. Buehler

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T08:46:26Z

**Summary**: PRefLexOR (Preference-based Recursive Language Modeling for Exploratory Optimization of Reasoning) combines preference optimization with concepts from Reinforcement Learning to enable models to self-teach through iterative reasoning improvements. We propose a recursive learning approach that engages the model in multi-step reasoning, revisiting, and refining intermediate steps before producing a final output in training and inference phases. Through multiple training stages, the model first learns to align its reasoning with accurate decision paths by optimizing the log odds between preferred and non-preferred responses. During this process, PRefLexOR builds a dynamic knowledge graph by generating questions from random text chunks and retrieval-augmentation to contextualize relevant details from the entire training corpus. In the second stage, preference optimization enhances model performance by using rejection sampling to fine-tune reasoning quality by continually producing in-situ training data while masking the reasoning steps. Recursive optimization within a thinking token framework introduces iterative feedback loops, where the model refines reasoning, achieving deeper coherence, consistency, and adaptability. Implemented in small language models with only 3 billion parameters, we should that even tiny models can iteratively teach themselves to reason with greater depth and reflectivity. Our implementation is straightforward and can be incorporated into any existing pretrained LLM. We focus our examples on applications in biological materials science and demonstrate the method in a variety of case studies that range from in-domain to cross-domain applications. Using reasoning strategies that include thinking and reflection modalities we build a multi-agent recursive self-improving inference approach to successively improve responses via repeated sampling in inference time.

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T08:24:09Z

**Summary**: Agents powered by large language models have shown remarkable abilities in solving complex tasks. However, most agent systems remain reactive, limiting their effectiveness in scenarios requiring foresight and autonomous decision-making. In this paper, we tackle the challenge of developing proactive agents capable of anticipating and initiating tasks without explicit human instructions. We propose a novel data-driven approach for this problem. Firstly, we collect real-world human activities to generate proactive task predictions. These predictions are then labeled by human annotators as either accepted or rejected. The labeled data is used to train a reward model that simulates human judgment and serves as an automatic evaluator of the proactiveness of LLM agents. Building on this, we develop a comprehensive data generation pipeline to create a diverse dataset, ProactiveBench, containing 6,790 events. Finally, we demonstrate that fine-tuning models with the proposed ProactiveBench can significantly elicit the proactiveness of LLM agents. Experimental results show that our fine-tuned model achieves an F1-Score of 66.47% in proactively offering assistance, outperforming all open-source and close-source models. These results highlight the potential of our method in creating more proactive and effective agent systems, paving the way for future advancements in human-agent collaboration.

### ERVQ: Enhanced Residual Vector Quantization with   Intra-and-Inter-Codebook Optimization for Neural Audio Codecs
**Authors**: Rui-Chen Zheng, Hui-Peng Du, Xiao-Hang Jiang, Yang Ai, Zhen-Hua Ling

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T08:21:37Z

**Summary**: Current neural audio codecs typically use residual vector quantization (RVQ) to discretize speech signals. However, they often experience codebook collapse, which reduces the effective codebook size and leads to suboptimal performance. To address this problem, we introduce ERVQ, Enhanced Residual Vector Quantization, a novel enhancement strategy for the RVQ framework in neural audio codecs. ERVQ mitigates codebook collapse and boosts codec performance through both intra- and inter-codebook optimization. Intra-codebook optimization incorporates an online clustering strategy and a code balancing loss to ensure balanced and efficient codebook utilization. Inter-codebook optimization improves the diversity of quantized features by minimizing the similarity between successive quantizations. Our experiments show that ERVQ significantly enhances audio codec performance across different models, sampling rates, and bitrates, achieving superior quality and generalization capabilities. It also achieves 100% codebook utilization on one of the most advanced neural audio codecs. Further experiments indicate that audio codecs improved by the ERVQ strategy can improve unified speech-and-text large language models (LLMs). Specifically, there is a notable improvement in the naturalness of generated speech in downstream zero-shot text-to-speech tasks. Audio samples are available here.

**Authors**: Sunjae Lee, Junyoung Choi, Jungjae Lee, Munim Hasan Wasi, Hojun Choi, Steven Y. Ko, Sangeun Oh, Insik Shin

**Updated**: 2024-10-16T08:15:53Z

**Summary**: The advent of large language models (LLMs) has opened up new opportunities in the field of mobile task automation. Their superior language understanding and reasoning capabilities allow users to automate complex and repetitive tasks. However, due to the inherent unreliability and high operational cost of LLMs, their practical applicability is quite limited. To address these issues, this paper introduces MobileGPT, an innovative LLM-based mobile task automator equipped with a human-like app memory. MobileGPT emulates the cognitive process of humans interacting with a mobile app -- explore, select, derive, and recall. This approach allows for a more precise and efficient learning of a task's procedure by breaking it down into smaller, modular sub-tasks that can be re-used, re-arranged, and adapted for various objectives. We implement MobileGPT using online LLMs services (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) and evaluate its performance on a dataset of 185 tasks across 18 mobile apps. The results indicate that MobileGPT can automate and learn new tasks with 82.7% accuracy, and is able to adapt them to different contexts with near perfect (98.75%) accuracy while reducing both latency and cost by 62.5% and 68.8%, respectively, compared to the GPT-4 powered baseline.

**Summary**: Recently, there are many efforts attempting to learn useful policies for continuous control in visual reinforcement learning (RL). In this scenario, it is important to learn a generalizable policy, as the testing environment may differ from the training environment, e.g., there exist distractors during deployment. Many practical algorithms are proposed to handle this problem. However, to the best of our knowledge, none of them provide a theoretical understanding of what affects the generalization gap and why their proposed methods work. In this paper, we bridge this issue by theoretically answering the key factors that contribute to the generalization gap when the testing environment has distractors. Our theories indicate that minimizing the representation distance between training and testing environments, which aligns with human intuition, is the most critical for the benefit of reducing the generalization gap. Our theoretical results are supported by the empirical evidence in the DMControl Generalization Benchmark (DMC-GB).

**Summary**: As Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents become increasingly autonomous and will more freely interact with each other, studying interactions between them becomes crucial to anticipate emergent phenomena and potential risks. Drawing inspiration from the widely popular Stanford Prison Experiment, we contribute to this line of research by studying interaction patterns of LLM agents in a context characterized by strict social hierarchy. We do so by specifically studying two types of phenomena: persuasion and anti-social behavior in simulated scenarios involving a guard and a prisoner agent who seeks to achieve a specific goal (i.e., obtaining additional yard time or escape from prison). Leveraging 200 experimental scenarios for a total of 2,000 machine-machine conversations across five different popular LLMs, we provide a set of noteworthy findings. We first document how some models consistently fail in carrying out a conversation in our multi-agent setup where power dynamics are at play. Then, for the models that were able to engage in successful interactions, we empirically show how the goal that an agent is set to achieve impacts primarily its persuasiveness, while having a negligible effect with respect to the agent's anti-social behavior. Third, we highlight how agents' personas, and particularly the guard's personality, drive both the likelihood of successful persuasion from the prisoner and the emergence of anti-social behaviors. Fourth, we show that even without explicitly prompting for specific personalities, anti-social behavior emerges by simply assigning agents' roles. These results bear implications for the development of interactive LLM agents as well as the debate on their societal impact.

**Summary**: Program-of-Thought (PoT) replaces natural language-based Chain-of-Thought (CoT) as the most popular method in Large Language Models (LLMs) mathematical reasoning tasks by utilizing external tool calls to circumvent computational errors. However, our evaluation of the GPT-4 and Llama series reveals that using PoT introduces more reasoning errors, such as incorrect formulas or flawed logic, compared to CoT. To address this issue, we propose Human-Think Language (HTL), which leverages a suite of strategies that help integrate PoT and CoT, encompassing: (1) a new generation paradigm that uses full CoT reasoning to control code generation. (2) Focus Attention, that directs model attention to the CoT reasoning during PoT to generate more logical code. (3) reinforcement learning that utilizes the accuracy of both CoT and PoT responses as rewards to prevent repetitive reasoning steps in LLMs when solving difficult math problems. Our method achieves an average improvement of 6.5% on the Llama-Base model and 4.3% on the Mistral-Base model across 8 mathematical calculation datasets. It also shows significant effectiveness on five out-of-domain datasets by controlling the model's information flow, exhibiting strong transferability. Additionally, HTL shows the most significant improvement in non-mathematical natural language inference task, contributing to a unified reasoning task framework
