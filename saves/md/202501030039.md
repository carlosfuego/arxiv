 ### EdgeRAG: Online-Indexed RAG for Edge Devices
**Authors**: Korakit Seemakhupt, Sihang Liu, Samira Khan

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T15:46:53Z

**Summary**: Deploying Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) on resource-constrained edge devices is challenging due to limited memory and processing power. In this work, we propose EdgeRAG which addresses the memory constraint by pruning embeddings within clusters and generating embeddings on-demand during retrieval. To avoid the latency of generating embeddings for large tail clusters, EdgeRAG pre-computes and stores embeddings for these clusters, while adaptively caching remaining embeddings to minimize redundant computations and further optimize latency. The result from BEIR suite shows that EdgeRAG offers significant latency reduction over the baseline IVF index, but with similar generation quality while allowing all of our evaluated datasets to fit into the memory.

**Authors**: Mahir Labib Dihan, Mohammed Eunus Ali, Md Rizwan Parvez

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T15:33:19Z

**Summary**: Mapping and navigation services like Google Maps, Apple Maps, Openstreet Maps, are essential for accessing various location-based data, yet they often struggle to handle natural language geospatial queries. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in question answering (QA), but creating reliable geospatial QA datasets from map services remains challenging. We introduce MapQaTor, a web application that streamlines the creation of reproducible, traceable map-based QA datasets. With its plug-and-play architecture, MapQaTor enables seamless integration with any maps API, allowing users to gather and visualize data from diverse sources with minimal setup. By caching API responses, the platform ensures consistent ground truth, enhancing the reliability of the data even as real-world information evolves. MapQaTor centralizes data retrieval, annotation, and visualization within a single platform, offering a unique opportunity to evaluate the current state of LLM-based geospatial reasoning while advancing their capabilities for improved geospatial understanding. Evaluation metrics show that, MapQaTor speeds up the annotation process by at least 30 times compared to manual methods, underscoring its potential for developing geospatial resources, such as complex map reasoning datasets.

**Authors**: Guoxuan Chen, Han Shi, Jiawei Li, Yihang Gao, Xiaozhe Ren, Yimeng Chen, Xin Jiang, Zhenguo Li, Weiyang Liu, Chao Huang

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T14:54:29Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited exceptional performance across a spectrum of natural language processing tasks. However, their substantial sizes pose considerable challenges, particularly in computational demands and inference speed, due to their quadratic complexity. In this work, we have identified a key pattern: certain seemingly meaningless special tokens (i.e., separators) contribute disproportionately to attention scores compared to semantically meaningful tokens. This observation suggests that information of the segments between these separator tokens can be effectively condensed into the separator tokens themselves without significant information loss. Guided by this insight, we introduce SepLLM, a plug-and-play framework that accelerates inference by compressing these segments and eliminating redundant tokens. Additionally, we implement efficient kernels for training acceleration. Experimental results across training-free, training-from-scratch, and post-training settings demonstrate SepLLM's effectiveness. Notably, using the Llama-3-8B backbone, SepLLM achieves over 50% reduction in KV cache on the GSM8K-CoT benchmark while maintaining comparable performance. Furthermore, in streaming settings, SepLLM effectively processes sequences of up to 4 million tokens or more while maintaining consistent language modeling capabilities.

### A Hidden Quantum Paraelectric Phase in SrTiO3 Induced by Terahertz Field
**Authors**: Wei Li, Hanbyul Kim, Xinbo Wang, Jianlin Luo, Simone Latini, Dongbin Shin, Jun-Ming Liu, Jing-Feng Li, Angel Rubio, Ce-Wen Nan, Qian Li

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T11:54:19Z

**Summary**: Coherent manipulation of lattice vibrations using ultrafast light pulses enables access to nonequilibrium 'hidden' phases with designed functionalities in quantum materials. However, expanding the understanding of nonlinear light-phonon interaction mechanisms remains crucial for developing new strategies. Here, we report re-entrant ultrafast phase transitions in SrTiO3 driven by intense terahertz excitation. As the terahertz field increases, the system transitions from the quantum paraelectric (QPE) ground state to an intermediate ferroelectric phase, and then unexpectedly reverts to a QPE state above ~500 kV/cm. The latter hidden QPE phase exhibits distinct lattice dynamics compared to the initial phases, highlighting activated antiferrodistortive phonon modes. Aided by first-principles dynamical calculations, we identify the mechanism for these complex behaviors as a superposition of multiple coherently excited eigenstates of the polar soft mode. Our results reveal a previously uncharted quantum facet of SrTiO3 and open pathways for harnessing high-order excitations to engineer quantum materials in the ultrafast regime.

### SelectLLM: Query-Aware Efficient Selection Algorithm for Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Kaushal Kumar Maurya, KV Aditya Srivatsa, Ekaterina Kochmar

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T05:01:44Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have seen widespread adoption due to their remarkable performance across various applications, driving the accelerated development of a large number of diverse LLMs. However, these individual LLMs show limitations in generalization and performance on complex tasks due to inherent training biases, model size constraints, and the quality or diversity of pre-training datasets. A promising direction is to efficiently harness the diverse capabilities of LLMs to overcome these individual limitations. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel LLM selection algorithm called SelectLLM, which efficiently directs input queries to the most suitable subset of LLMs from a large pool, ensuring that the selected models collectively provide accurate responses. SelectLLM employs a multi-label classifier and policy based on the classifier's predictions and confidence scores in selecting an optimal, query-aware, and lightweight subset of LLMs. Our findings indicate that the proposed model outperforms existing ensemble-based baselines and achieves competitive performance with similarly sized top-performing LLMs while maintaining efficiency. Specifically, it achieves a huge reduction in inference latency on two challenging reasoning benchmarks: 13% on GSM8K and 70% on MMLU, compared to the top-performing baselines. Also, we establish a theoretical upper bound by an oracle with LLMs and explore in-depth linguistic analysis to understand the performance gap between Oracle and SelectLLM.

### Align Attention Heads Before Merging Them: An Effective Way for   Converting MHA to GQA
**Authors**: Qingyun Jin, Xiaohui Song, Feng Zhou, Zengchang Qin

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T03:05:45Z

**Summary**: Large language models have been shown to perform well on a variety of natural language processing problems. However, as the model size and the input sequence's length increase, the rapid increase of KV Cache significantly slows down inference speed. Therefore GQA model, as an alternative to MHA model, has been widely introduced into LLMs. In this work, we propose a low-cost method for pruning MHA models into GQA models with any compression ratio of key-value heads. Our method is based on $\mathit{L_0}$ masks to gradually remove redundant parameters. In addition, we apply orthogonal transformations to attention heads without changing the model to increase similarity between attention heads before pruning training, in order to further improve performance of the model. Our method can be compatible with rotary position embedding (RoPE), which means the model after training can be fully adapted to the mainstream standard GQA framework. Experiments demonstrate that our strategy can compress up to 87.5% of key-value heads of the LLaMA2-7B model without too much performance degradation, just achieved through supervised fine-tuning.

**Authors**: Anatolij Zubow, Yannik Pilz, Sascha RÃ¶sler, Falko Dressler

**Updated**: 2024-12-29T17:18:21Z

**Summary**: Network simulators are indispensable tools for the advancement of wireless network technologies, offering a cost-effective and controlled environment to simulate real-world network behavior. However, traditional simulators, such as the widely used ns-3, exhibit limitations in accurately modeling indoor and outdoor scenarios due to their reliance on simplified statistical and stochastic channel propagation models, which often fail to accurately capture physical phenomena like multipath signal propagation and shadowing by obstacles in the line-of-sight path. We present Ns3Sionna, which integrates a ray tracing-based channel model, implemented using the Sionna RT framework, within the ns-3 network simulator. It allows to simulate environment-specific and physically accurate channel realizations for a given 3D scene and wireless device positions. Additionally, a mobility model based on ray tracing was developed to accurately represent device movements within the simulated 3D space. Ns3Sionna provides more realistic path and delay loss estimates for both indoor and outdoor environments than existing ns-3 propagation models, particularly in terms of spatial and temporal correlation. Moreover, fine-grained channel state information is provided, which could be used for the development of sensing applications. Due to the significant computational demands of ray tracing, Ns3Sionna takes advantage of the parallel execution capabilities of modern GPUs and multi-core CPUs by incorporating intelligent pre-caching mechanisms that leverage the channel's coherence time to optimize runtime performance. This enables the efficient simulation of scenarios with a small to medium number of mobile nodes.

### ReTaKe: Reducing Temporal and Knowledge Redundancy for Long Video   Understanding
**Authors**: Xiao Wang, Qingyi Si, Jianlong Wu, Shiyu Zhu, Li Cao, Liqiang Nie

**Updated**: 2024-12-29T15:42:24Z

**Summary**: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in video understanding. However, existing VideoLLMs often inherit the limitations of their backbone LLMs in handling long sequences, leading to challenges for long video understanding. Common solutions either simply uniformly sample videos' frames or compress visual tokens, which focus primarily on low-level temporal visual redundancy, overlooking high-level knowledge redundancy. This limits the achievable compression rate with minimal loss. To this end. we introduce a training-free method, $\textbf{ReTaKe}$, containing two novel modules DPSelect and PivotKV, to jointly model and reduce both temporal visual redundancy and knowledge redundancy for long video understanding. Specifically, DPSelect identifies keyframes with local maximum peak distance based on their visual features, which are closely aligned with human video perception. PivotKV employs the obtained keyframes as pivots and conducts KV-Cache compression for the non-pivot tokens with low attention scores, which are derived from the learned prior knowledge of LLMs. Experiments on benchmarks VideoMME, MLVU, and LVBench, show that ReTaKe can support 4x longer video sequences with minimal performance loss (<1%) and outperform all similar-size VideoLLMs with 3%-5%, even surpassing or on par with much larger ones.

### Revisiting Cache Freshness for Emerging Real-Time Applications
**Authors**: Ziming Mao, Rishabh Iyer, Scott Shenker, Ion Stoica

**Updated**: 2024-12-28T17:17:03Z

**Summary**: Caching is widely used in industry to improve application performance by reducing data-access latency and taking the load off the backend infrastructure. TTLs have become the de-facto mechanism used to keep cached data reasonably fresh (i.e., not too out of date with the backend). However, the emergence of real-time applications requires tighter data freshness, which is impractical to achieve with TTLs. We discuss why this is the case, and propose a simple yet effective adaptive policy to achieve the desired freshness.

**Updated**: 2024-12-28T14:38:16Z

**Summary**: The expansion of large language models (LLMs) with hundreds of billions of parameters presents significant challenges to computational resources, particularly data movement and memory bandwidth. Long-context LLMs, which process sequences of tens of thousands of tokens, further increase the demand on the memory system as the complexity in attention layers and key-value cache sizes is proportional to the context length. Processing-in-Memory (PIM) maximizes memory bandwidth by moving compute to the data and can address the memory bandwidth challenges; however, PIM is not necessarily scalable to accelerate long-context LLM because of limited per-module memory capacity and the inflexibility of fixed-functional unit PIM architecture and static memory management. In this work, we propose LoL-PIM which is a multi-node PIM architecture that accelerates long context LLM through hardware-software co-design. In particular, we propose how pipeline parallelism can be exploited across a multi-PIM module while a direct PIM access (DPA) controller (or DMA for PIM) is proposed that enables dynamic PIM memory management and results in efficient PIM utilization across a diverse range of context length. We developed an MLIR-based compiler for LoL-PIM extending a commercial PIM-based compiler where the software modifications were implemented and evaluated, while the hardware changes were modeled in the simulator. Our evaluations demonstrate that LoL-PIM significantly improves throughput and reduces latency for long-context LLM inference, outperforming both multi-GPU and GPU-PIM systems (up to 8.54x and 16.0x speedup, respectively), thereby enabling more efficient deployment of LLMs in real-world applications.

### ST$^3$: Accelerating Multimodal Large Language Model by Spatial-Temporal   Visual Token Trimming
**Authors**: Jiedong Zhuang, Lu Lu, Ming Dai, Rui Hu, Jian Chen, Qiang Liu, Haoji Hu

**Updated**: 2024-12-28T10:17:29Z

**Summary**: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) enhance their perceptual capabilities by integrating visual and textual information. However, processing the massive number of visual tokens incurs a significant computational cost. Existing analysis of the MLLM attention mechanisms remains shallow, leading to coarse-grain token pruning strategies that fail to effectively balance speed and accuracy. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive investigation of MLLM attention mechanisms with LLaVA. We find that numerous visual tokens and partial attention computations are redundant during the decoding process. Based on this insight, we propose Spatial-Temporal Visual Token Trimming ($\textbf{ST}^{3}$), a framework designed to accelerate MLLM inference without retraining. $\textbf{ST}^{3}$ consists of two primary components: 1) Progressive Visual Token Pruning (\textbf{PVTP}), which eliminates inattentive visual tokens across layers, and 2) Visual Token Annealing (\textbf{VTA}), which dynamically reduces the number of visual tokens in each layer as the generated tokens grow. Together, these techniques deliver around $\mathbf{2\times}$ faster inference with only about $\mathbf{30\%}$ KV cache memory compared to the original LLaVA, while maintaining consistent performance across various datasets. Crucially, $\textbf{ST}^{3}$ can be seamlessly integrated into existing pre-trained MLLMs, providing a plug-and-play solution for efficient inference.

### A Robust Federated Learning Framework for Undependable Devices at Scale
**Authors**: Shilong Wang, Jianchun Liu, Hongli Xu, Chunming Qiao, Huarong Deng, Qiuye Zheng, Jiantao Gong

**Updated**: 2024-12-28T03:28:52Z

**Summary**: In a federated learning (FL) system, many devices, such as smartphones, are often undependable (e.g., frequently disconnected from WiFi) during training. Existing FL frameworks always assume a dependable environment and exclude undependable devices from training, leading to poor model performance and resource wastage. In this paper, we propose FLUDE to effectively deal with undependable environments. First, FLUDE assesses the dependability of devices based on the probability distribution of their historical behaviors (e.g., the likelihood of successfully completing training). Based on this assessment, FLUDE adaptively selects devices with high dependability for training. To mitigate resource wastage during the training phase, FLUDE maintains a model cache on each device, aiming to preserve the latest training state for later use in case local training on an undependable device is interrupted. Moreover, FLUDE proposes a staleness-aware strategy to judiciously distribute the global model to a subset of devices, thus significantly reducing resource wastage while maintaining model performance. We have implemented FLUDE on two physical platforms with 120 smartphones and NVIDIA Jetson devices. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that FLUDE can effectively improve model performance and resource efficiency of FL training in undependable environments.

### Direct Comparison of Magnetic Penetration Depth in Kagome   Superconductors AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A = Cs, K, Rb)
**Authors**: Austin Kaczmarek, Andrea Capa Salinas, Stephen D. Wilson, Katja C. Nowack

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T20:47:23Z

**Summary**: We report measurements of the local temperature-dependent penetration depth, $\lambda(T)$, in the Kagome superconductors AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A = Cs, K, Rb) using scanning superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) microscopy. Our results suggest that the superconducting order in all three compounds is fully gapped, in contrast to reports of nodal superconductivity in KV$_3$Sb$_5$ and RbV$_3$Sb$_5$. Analysis of the temperature-dependent superfluid density, $\rho_s(T)$, shows deviations from the behavior expected for a single isotropic gap, but the data are well described by models incorporating either a single anisotropic gap or two isotropic gaps. Notably, the temperature dependences of $\lambda(T)$ and $\rho_s(T)$ in KV$_3$Sb$_5$ and RbV$_3$Sb$_5$ are qualitatively more similar to each other than to CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, consistent with the superconducting phase reflecting features of the normal-state band structure. Our findings provide a direct comparison of the superconducting properties across the AV$_3$Sb$_5$ family.

**Authors**: Haoyang Li, Yiming Li, Anxin Tian, Tianhao Tang, Zhanchao Xu, Xuejia Chen, Nicole Hu, Wei Dong, Qing Li, Lei Chen

**Updated**: 2024-12-27T04:17:57Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized a wide range of domains such as natural language processing, computer vision, and multi-modal tasks due to their ability to comprehend context and perform logical reasoning. However, the computational and memory demands of LLMs, particularly during inference, pose significant challenges when scaling them to real-world, long-context, and real-time applications. Key-Value (KV) cache management has emerged as a critical optimization technique for accelerating LLM inference by reducing redundant computations and improving memory utilization. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of KV cache management strategies for LLM acceleration, categorizing them into token-level, model-level, and system-level optimizations. Token-level strategies include KV cache selection, budget allocation, merging, quantization, and low-rank decomposition, while model-level optimizations focus on architectural innovations and attention mechanisms to enhance KV reuse. System-level approaches address memory management, scheduling, and hardware-aware designs to improve efficiency across diverse computing environments. Additionally, the survey provides an overview of both text and multimodal datasets and benchmarks used to evaluate these strategies. By presenting detailed taxonomies and comparative analyses, this work aims to offer useful insights for researchers and practitioners to support the development of efficient and scalable KV cache management techniques, contributing to the practical deployment of LLMs in real-world applications.

### Multi-matrix Factorization Attention
**Authors**: Jingcheng Hu, Houyi Li, Yinmin Zhang, Zili Wang, Shuigeng Zhou, Xiangyu Zhang, Heung-Yeung Shum

**Updated**: 2024-12-26T15:45:45Z

**Summary**: We propose novel attention architectures, Multi-matrix Factorization Attention (MFA) and MFA-Key-Reuse (MFA-KR). Existing variants for standard Multi-Head Attention (MHA), including SOTA methods like MLA, fail to maintain as strong performance under stringent Key-Value cache (KV cache) constraints. MFA enhances model capacity by efficiently scaling up both the number and dimension of attention heads through low-rank matrix factorization in the Query-Key (QK) circuit. Extending MFA, MFA-KR further reduces memory requirements by repurposing the key cache as value through value projection re-parameterization. MFA's design enables strong model capacity when working under tight KV cache budget, while MFA-KR is suitable for even harsher KV cache limits with minor performance trade-off. Notably, in our extensive and large-scale experiments, the proposed architecture outperforms MLA and performs comparably to MHA, while reducing KV cache usage by up to 56% and 93.7%, respectively.

### Performance Characterization and Optimizations of Traditional ML   Applications
**Authors**: Harsh Kumar, R. Govindarajan

**Updated**: 2024-12-26T04:13:52Z

**Summary**: Even in the era of Deep Learning based methods, traditional machine learning methods with large data sets continue to attract significant attention. However, we find an apparent lack of a detailed performance characterization of these methods in the context of large training datasets. In this work, we study the system's behavior of a number of traditional ML methods as implemented in popular free software libraries/modules to identify critical performance bottlenecks experienced by these applications. The performance characterization study reveals several interesting insights on the performance of these applications. Then we evaluate the performance benefits of applying some well-known optimizations at the levels of caches and the main memory. More specifically, we test the usefulness of optimizations such as (i) software prefetching to improve cache performance and (ii) data layout and computation reordering optimizations to improve locality in DRAM accesses. These optimizations are implemented as modifications to the well-known scikit-learn library, and hence can be easily leveraged by application programmers. We evaluate the impact of the proposed optimizations using a combination of simulation and execution on a real system. The software prefetching optimization results in performance benefits varying from 5.2%-27.1% on different ML applications while the data layout and computation reordering approaches yield 6.16%-28.0% performance improvement.

### XRFlux: Virtual Reality Benchmark for Edge Caching Systems
**Authors**: Nader Alfares, George Kesidis

**Updated**: 2024-12-25T18:36:21Z

**Summary**: We introduce a Unity based benchmark XRFlux for evaluating Virtual Reality (VR) delivery systems using edge-cloud caching. As VR applications and systems progress, the need to meet strict latency and Quality of Experience (QoE) requirements is increasingly evident. In the context of VR, traditional cloud architectures (e.g., remote AWS S3 for content delivery) often struggle to meet these demands, especially for users of the same application in different locations. With edge computing, resources are brought closer to users in efforts to reduce latency and improve QoEs. However, VR's dynamic nature, with changing fields of view (FoVs) and user synchronization requirements, creates various challenges for edge caching. We address the lack of suitable benchmarks and propose a framework that simulates multiuser VR scenarios while logging users' interaction with objects within their actual and predicted FoVs. The benchmark's activity log can then be played back through an edge cache to assess the resulting QoEs. This tool fills a gap by supporting research in the optimization of edge caching (and other edge-cloud functions) for VR streaming.

### Long-Range Tasks Using Short-Context LLMs: Incremental Reasoning With   Structured Memories
**Authors**: Dulhan Jayalath, James Bradley Wendt, Nicholas Monath, Sandeep Tata, Beliz Gunel

**Updated**: 2024-12-25T14:14:31Z

**Summary**: Long-range tasks require reasoning over long inputs. Existing solutions either need large compute budgets, training data, access to model weights, or use complex, task-specific approaches. We present PRISM, which alleviates these concerns by processing information as a stream of chunks, maintaining a structured in-context memory specified by a typed hierarchy schema. This approach demonstrates superior performance to baselines on diverse tasks while using at least 4x smaller contexts than long-context models. Moreover, PRISM is token-efficient. By producing short outputs and efficiently leveraging key-value (KV) caches, it achieves up to 54% cost reduction when compared to alternative short-context approaches. The method also scales down to tiny information chunks (e.g., 500 tokens) without increasing the number of tokens encoded or sacrificing quality. Furthermore, we show that it is possible to generate schemas to generalize our approach to new tasks with minimal effort.

### Accelerating Diffusion Transformers with Dual Feature Caching
**Authors**: Chang Zou, Evelyn Zhang, Runlin Guo, Haohang Xu, Conghui He, Xuming Hu, Linfeng Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-12-25T14:00:14Z

**Summary**: Diffusion Transformers (DiT) have become the dominant methods in image and video generation yet still suffer substantial computational costs. As an effective approach for DiT acceleration, feature caching methods are designed to cache the features of DiT in previous timesteps and reuse them in the next timesteps, allowing us to skip the computation in the next timesteps. However, on the one hand, aggressively reusing all the features cached in previous timesteps leads to a severe drop in generation quality. On the other hand, conservatively caching only the features in the redundant layers or tokens but still computing the important ones successfully preserves the generation quality but results in reductions in acceleration ratios. Observing such a tradeoff between generation quality and acceleration performance, this paper begins by quantitatively studying the accumulated error from cached features. Surprisingly, we find that aggressive caching does not introduce significantly more caching errors in the caching step, and the conservative feature caching can fix the error introduced by aggressive caching. Thereby, we propose a dual caching strategy that adopts aggressive and conservative caching iteratively, leading to significant acceleration and high generation quality at the same time. Besides, we further introduce a V-caching strategy for token-wise conservative caching, which is compatible with flash attention and requires no training and calibration data.

### Aspect-oriented Programming with Julia
**Authors**: Osamu Ishimura, Yoshihide Yoshimoto

**Updated**: 2024-12-25T11:59:17Z

**Summary**: This paper proposes integrating Aspect-oriented Programming (AOP) into Julia, a language widely used in scientific and High-Performance Computing (HPC). AOP enhances software modularity by encapsulating cross-cutting concerns, such as logging, caching, and parallelizing, into separate, reusable aspects. Leveraging Julia's powerful metaprogramming and abstract syntax tree (AST) manipulation capabilities, we introduce AspectJulia, an AOP framework designed to operate within Julia's runtime environment as a package. AspectJulia enables developers to define and apply aspects seamlessly, leading to more modular, maintainable, and adaptable code. We detail the implementation of AspectJulia and present diverse use cases, ranging from HPC and scientific computing to business applications, demonstrating its effectiveness in managing cross-cutting concerns. This integration simplifies application development and improves the adaptability of existing Julia modules and packages, paving the way for more efficient and maintainable software systems.

**Authors**: Minghui Liu, Tahseen Rabbani, Tony O'Halloran, Ananth Sankaralingam, Mary-Anne Hartley, Brian Gravelle, Furong Huang, Cornelia FermÃ¼ller, Yiannis Aloimonos

**Updated**: 2024-12-24T13:04:45Z

**Summary**: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) use the key-value (KV) cache to significantly accelerate inference by storing the key and value embeddings of past tokens. However, this cache consumes significant GPU memory. In this work, we introduce HashEvict, an algorithm that uses locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) to compress the KV cache. HashEvict quickly locates tokens in the cache that are cosine dissimilar to the current query token. This is achieved by computing the Hamming distance between binarized Gaussian projections of the current token query and cached token keys, with a projection length much smaller than the embedding dimension. We maintain a lightweight binary structure in GPU memory to facilitate these calculations. Unlike existing compression strategies that compute attention to determine token retention, HashEvict makes these decisions pre-attention, thereby reducing computational costs. Additionally, HashEvict is dynamic - at every decoding step, the key and value of the current token replace the embeddings of a token expected to produce the lowest attention score. We demonstrate that HashEvict can compress the KV cache by 30%-70% while maintaining high performance across reasoning, multiple-choice, long-context retrieval and summarization tasks.

### Development and Application of a Decentralized Domain Name Service
**Authors**: Guang Yang

**Updated**: 2024-12-24T00:46:00Z

**Summary**: The current Domain Name System (DNS), as a core infrastructure of the internet, exhibits several shortcomings: its centralized architecture leads to censorship risks and single points of failure, making domain name resolution vulnerable to attacks. The lack of encryption in the resolution process exposes it to DNS hijacking and cache poisoning attacks. Additionally, the high operational costs limit participation and innovation among small to medium-sized users. To address these issues, this paper proposes a Decentralized Domain Name Service (DDNS) based on blockchain (Phicoin) and distributed storage (IPFS). By leveraging the immutability of blockchain and the content verification of IPFS, the system achieves decentralized storage and distribution of domain name records, eliminating the centralized dependencies of traditional DNS. With a block time of 15 seconds, the system supports rapid broadcasting of domain name updates, significantly improving resolution efficiency. The DDNS aims to serve as a complement or backup to the existing DNS system, providing a pollution-resistant, censorship-resistant, high-performance, and low-cost domain name resolution solution, offering a new technical path for the security and stability of the internet.

### Deliberation in Latent Space via Differentiable Cache Augmentation
**Authors**: Luyang Liu, Jonas Pfeiffer, Jiaxing Wu, Jun Xie, Arthur Szlam

**Updated**: 2024-12-23T18:02:25Z

**Summary**: Techniques enabling large language models (LLMs) to "think more" by generating and attending to intermediate reasoning steps have shown promise in solving complex problems. However, the standard approaches generate sequences of discrete tokens immediately before responding, and so they can incur significant latency costs and be challenging to optimize. In this work, we demonstrate that a frozen LLM can be augmented with an offline coprocessor that operates on the model's key-value (kv) cache. This coprocessor augments the cache with a set of latent embeddings designed to improve the fidelity of subsequent decoding. We train this coprocessor using the language modeling loss from the decoder on standard pretraining data, while keeping the decoder itself frozen. This approach enables the model to learn, in an end-to-end differentiable fashion, how to distill additional computation into its kv-cache. Because the decoder remains unchanged, the coprocessor can operate offline and asynchronously, and the language model can function normally if the coprocessor is unavailable or if a given cache is deemed not to require extra computation. We show experimentally that when a cache is augmented, the decoder achieves lower perplexity on numerous subsequent tokens. Furthermore, even without any task-specific training, our experiments demonstrate that cache augmentation consistently reduces perplexity and improves performance across a range of reasoning-intensive tasks.

### A Reproducible Method for Mapping Electricity Transmission   Infrastructure for Space Weather Risk Assessment
**Authors**: Edward J. Oughton, Evan Alexander Peters, Dennies Bor, Noah Rivera, C. Trevor Gaunt, Robert Weigel

**Updated**: 2024-12-23T16:11:18Z

**Summary**: Space weather impact assessment is constrained by the lack of available asset information to undertake modeling of Geomagnetically Induced Currents (GICs) in Extra High Voltage electricity infrastructure networks. The U.S. National Space Weather Strategy and Action Plan identifies underutilized data as a central issue for improving risk assessment, motivating this research. Accurate GIC prediction is generally not possible without information on the electrical circuit, therefore we define a reproducible method based on open-source data, which enables risk analysts to collect their own substation component data. This process converts OpenStreetMap (OSM) substation locations to high-resolution, component-level mapping of electricity transmission assets by utilizing an innovative web-browser platform to facilitate component annotation. As a case study example, we convert an initial 1,313 high-voltage (>115 kV) substations to 52,273 substation components via Google Earth APIs utilizing low-altitude, satellite, and Streetview imagery. We find that a total of 41,642 substation components (79.6%) connect to the highest substation voltage levels (>345 kV) and are possibly susceptible to GIC, with a total of 7,949 transformers identified. Compared to the initial OSM baseline, we provide new detailed insights on voltage levels, line capacities, and substation configurations. Two validation workshops were undertaken to align the method and data with GIC assessment needs. The approach ensures consistency and rapid scalability, enabling users to quickly count components via a flexible web-browser application.

### Inter-Satellite Link-Enhanced Transmission Scheme Towards Aviation IoT   in SAGIN
**Authors**: Qian Chen, Chenyu Wu, Shuai Han, Weixiao Meng, Tony Q. S. Quek

**Updated**: 2024-12-23T14:40:26Z

**Summary**: The rapid development of the aviation Internet of Things (IoT) has positioned in-flight connectivity (IFC) as one of its critical applications. Space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGIN) are essential for ensuring the performance of IFC by enabling seamless and reliable connectivity. However, most existing research treats satellites merely as transparent forwarding nodes and overlooks their potential caching capabilities to enhance IFC data rates. In this article, we explore an IFC-oriented SAGIN where satellites and ground stations (GSs) work together to transmit content to airborne passengers, thereby facilitating airborne communication. By categorizing files into cached (instantly accessible via satellites) and non-cached files (available only through GSs), this article pioneers the integration of multiple inter-satellite links (ISLs) into the IFC framework, thus innovating the content delivery process for both types of files. To minimize the average delay of content delivery, we formulate the corresponding optimization problems: 1) For cached files, we propose an exact penalty-based method to determine the satellite association scheme. 2) For non-cached files, we present an efficient algorithm based on alternating optimization to jointly optimize satellite association and GS bandwidth allocation. Our proposed framework is low in complexity, paving the way for high-speed Internet connectivity for aviation passengers. Finally, simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed IFC framework for SAGIN.

### A Framework for Effective Invocation Methods of Various LLM Services
**Authors**: Can Wang, Dianbo Sui, Bolin Zhang, Xiaoyu Liu, Jiabao Kang, Zhidong Qiao, Zhiying Tu

**Updated**: 2024-12-23T12:55:21Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive abilities in solving various natural language processing tasks and are now widely offered as services. LLM services enable users to accomplish tasks without requiring specialized knowledge, simply by paying service providers. However, numerous providers offer various LLM services with variations in pricing, latency, and performance. These factors are also affected by different invocation methods, such as the choice of context and the use of cache, which lead to unpredictable and uncontrollable service cost and quality. Consequently, utilizing various LLM services invocation methods to construct an effective (cost-saving, low-latency and high-performance) invocation strategy that best meets task demands becomes a pressing challenge. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of methods help LLM services to be invoked efficiently. Technically, we define the problem of constructing an effective LLM services invocation strategy, and based on this, propose a unified LLM service invocation framework. The framework classifies existing methods into four categories: input abstraction, semantic cache, solution design, and output enhancement, which can be used separately or jointly during the invocation life cycle. We discuss the methods in each category and compare them to provide valuable guidance for researchers. Finally, we emphasize the open challenges in this domain and shed light on future research.

### CALLIC: Content Adaptive Learning for Lossless Image Compression
**Authors**: Daxin Li, Yuanchao Bai, Kai Wang, Junjun Jiang, Xianming Liu, Wen Gao

**Updated**: 2024-12-23T10:41:18Z

**Summary**: Learned lossless image compression has achieved significant advancements in recent years. However, existing methods often rely on training amortized generative models on massive datasets, resulting in sub-optimal probability distribution estimation for specific testing images during encoding process. To address this challenge, we explore the connection between the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle and Parameter-Efficient Transfer Learning (PETL), leading to the development of a novel content-adaptive approach for learned lossless image compression, dubbed CALLIC. Specifically, we first propose a content-aware autoregressive self-attention mechanism by leveraging convolutional gating operations, termed Masked Gated ConvFormer (MGCF), and pretrain MGCF on training dataset. Cache then Crop Inference (CCI) is proposed to accelerate the coding process. During encoding, we decompose pre-trained layers, including depth-wise convolutions, using low-rank matrices and then adapt the incremental weights on testing image by Rate-guided Progressive Fine-Tuning (RPFT). RPFT fine-tunes with gradually increasing patches that are sorted in descending order by estimated entropy, optimizing learning process and reducing adaptation time. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate that CALLIC sets a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) for learned lossless image compression.

### Fast and Live Model Auto Scaling with O(1) Host Caching
**Authors**: Dingyan Zhang, Haotian Wang, Yang Liu, Xingda Wei, Yizhou Shan, Rong Chen, Haibo Chen

**Updated**: 2024-12-23T03:38:46Z

**Summary**: Model autoscaling is the key mechanism to achieve serverless model-as-a-service, but it faces a fundamental trade-off between scaling speed and storage/memory usage to cache parameters, and cannot meet frequent scaling requirements across multiple hosts. The key problem is that data plane performance is slow, and scaled instances remain stopped while parameters are loading. We first show that data plane can be made fast with no/O(1) caching by loading parameters through the compute network between GPUs because: (1) its speed is comparable host cache and is underutilized; (2) scaling multiple instances requires no or O(1) caching with network-optimized multicast. Second, autoscaling can be made live by breaking the scaling abstraction from a coarse-grained instance-level to a fine-grained layer-level. This allows us to offload the layer computation from the overloaded serving instances to the scaled instance with cooperative execution, thus handles cases even when the compute network is not sufficiently fast. Our system BLITZSCALE reduces the serving tail latencies by up to 86% without caching, and we achieve comparable performance (or even better) to an optimal setup where all the parameters are cached at all the host for autoscaling.

### Semi-Supervised Contrastive Learning for Controllable Video-to-Music   Retrieval
**Authors**: Shanti Stewart, Gouthaman KV, Lie Lu, Andrea Fanelli

**Updated**: 2024-12-23T02:52:36Z

**Summary**: Content creators often use music to enhance their videos, from soundtracks in movies to background music in video blogs and social media content. However, identifying the best music for a video can be a difficult and time-consuming task. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework for automatically retrieving a matching music clip for a given video, and vice versa. Our approach leverages annotated music labels, as well as the inherent artistic correspondence between visual and music elements. Distinct from previous cross-modal music retrieval works, our method combines both self-supervised and supervised training objectives. We use self-supervised and label-supervised contrastive learning to train a joint embedding space between music and video. We show the effectiveness of our approach by using music genre labels for the supervised training component, and our framework can be generalized to other music annotations (e.g., emotion, instrument, etc.). Furthermore, our method enables fine-grained control over how much the retrieval process focuses on self-supervised vs. label information at inference time. We evaluate the learned embeddings through a variety of video-to-music and music-to-video retrieval tasks. Our experiments show that the proposed approach successfully combines self-supervised and supervised objectives and is effective for controllable music-video retrieval.

### Agile TLB Prefetching and Prediction Replacement Policy
**Authors**: Melkamu Mersha, Tsion Abay, Mingziem Bitewa, Gedare Bloom

**Updated**: 2024-12-23T00:46:53Z

**Summary**: Virtual-to-physical address translation is a critical performance bottleneck in paging-based virtual memory systems. The Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) accelerates address translation by caching frequently accessed mappings, but TLB misses lead to costly page walks. Hardware and software techniques address this challenge. Hardware approaches enhance TLB reach through system-level support, while software optimizations include TLB prefetching, replacement policies, superpages, and page size adjustments. Prefetching Page Table Entries (PTEs) for future accesses reduces bottlenecks but may incur overhead from incorrect predictions. Integrating an Agile TLB Prefetcher (ATP) with SBFP optimizes performance by leveraging page table locality and dynamically identifying essential free PTEs during page walks. Predictive replacement policies further improve TLB performance. Traditional LRU replacement is limited to near-instant references, while advanced policies like SRRIP, GHRP, SHiP, SDBP, and CHiRP enhance performance by targeting specific inefficiencies. CHiRP, tailored for L2 TLBs, surpasses other policies by leveraging control flow history to detect dead blocks, utilizing L2 TLB entries for learning instead of sampling. These integrated techniques collectively address key challenges in virtual memory management.

### MVREC: A General Few-shot Defect Classification Model Using Multi-View   Region-Context
**Authors**: Shuai Lyu, Fangjian Liao, Zeqi Ma, Rongchen Zhang, Dongmei Mo, Waikeung Wong

**Updated**: 2024-12-22T07:14:45Z

**Summary**: Few-shot defect multi-classification (FSDMC) is an emerging trend in quality control within industrial manufacturing. However, current FSDMC research often lacks generalizability due to its focus on specific datasets. Additionally, defect classification heavily relies on contextual information within images, and existing methods fall short of effectively extracting this information. To address these challenges, we propose a general FSDMC framework called MVREC, which offers two primary advantages: (1) MVREC extracts general features for defect instances by incorporating the pre-trained AlphaCLIP model. (2) It utilizes a region-context framework to enhance defect features by leveraging mask region input and multi-view context augmentation. Furthermore, Few-shot Zip-Adapter(-F) classifiers within the model are introduced to cache the visual features of the support set and perform few-shot classification. We also introduce MVTec-FS, a new FSDMC benchmark based on MVTec AD, which includes 1228 defect images with instance-level mask annotations and 46 defect types. Extensive experiments conducted on MVTec-FS and four additional datasets demonstrate its effectiveness in general defect classification and its ability to incorporate contextual information to improve classification performance.

**Authors**: Cunchen Hu, Heyang Huang, Junhao Hu, Jiang Xu, Xusheng Chen, Tao Xie, Chenxi Wang, Sa Wang, Yungang Bao, Ninghui Sun, Yizhou Shan

**Updated**: 2024-12-21T13:55:49Z

**Summary**: Large language model (LLM) serving has transformed from stateless to stateful systems, utilizing techniques like context caching and disaggregated inference. These optimizations extend the lifespan and domain of the KV cache, necessitating a new architectural approach. We present MemServe, a unified system that integrates both inter-request and intra-request optimizations. MemServe introduces MemPool, an elastic memory pool managing distributed memory and KV caches across serving instances. Using MemPool APIs, MemServe combines context caching with disaggregated inference for the first time, supported by a global scheduler that enhances cache reuse through a global prompt tree-based locality-aware policy. Tests show that MemServe significantly improves job completion time and time-to-first-time.

### Parameterized Complexity of Caching in Networks
**Authors**: Robert Ganian, Fionn Mc Inerney, Dimitra Tsigkari

**Updated**: 2024-12-21T11:20:26Z

**Summary**: The fundamental caching problem in networks asks to find an allocation of contents to a network of caches with the aim of maximizing the cache hit rate. Despite the problem's importance to a variety of research areas -- including not only content delivery, but also edge intelligence and inference -- and the extensive body of work on empirical aspects of caching, very little is known about the exact boundaries of tractability for the problem beyond its general NP-hardness. We close this gap by performing a comprehensive complexity-theoretic analysis of the problem through the lens of the parameterized complexity paradigm, which is designed to provide more precise statements regarding algorithmic tractability than classical complexity. Our results include algorithmic lower and upper bounds which together establish the conditions under which the caching problem becomes tractable.

**Updated**: 2024-12-21T02:36:03Z

**Summary**: This technical report presents Yi-Lightning, our latest flagship large language model (LLM). It achieves exceptional performance, ranking 6th overall on Chatbot Arena, with particularly strong results (2nd to 4th place) in specialized categories including Chinese, Math, Coding, and Hard Prompts. Yi-Lightning leverages an enhanced Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, featuring advanced expert segmentation and routing mechanisms coupled with optimized KV-caching techniques. Our development process encompasses comprehensive pre-training, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), where we devise deliberate strategies for multi-stage training, synthetic data construction, and reward modeling. Furthermore, we implement RAISE (Responsible AI Safety Engine), a four-component framework to address safety issues across pre-training, post-training, and serving phases. Empowered by our scalable super-computing infrastructure, all these innovations substantially reduce training, deployment and inference costs while maintaining high-performance standards. With further evaluations on public academic benchmarks, Yi-Lightning demonstrates competitive performance against top-tier LLMs, while we observe a notable disparity between traditional, static benchmark results and real-world, dynamic human preferences. This observation prompts a critical reassessment of conventional benchmarks' utility in guiding the development of more intelligent and powerful AI systems for practical applications. Yi-Lightning is now available through our developer platform at https://platform.lingyiwanwu.com.

### SYMPHONY: Improving Memory Management for LLM Inference Workloads
**Authors**: Saurabh Agarwal, Anyong Mao, Aditya Akella, Shivaram Venkataraman

**Updated**: 2024-12-21T01:48:52Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed in applications such as chatbots, code editors, and conversational agents. A key feature of LLMs is their ability to engage in multi-turn interactions with humans or external tools, enabling a wide range of tasks. Each new request in a multi-turn interaction depends on the intermediate state, specifically the key-value (K,V) caches, from previous requests in the ongoing interaction. Existing serving engines either recompute the K,V caches or offload them to main memory. Profiling reveals that recomputation can result in over 99% of processed tokens being redundant. On the other hand, offloading K,V caches from GPU memory makes inference serving stateful, leading to load imbalances across the cluster. To address these challenges, we developed SYMPHONY. SYMPHONY leverages the observation that multi-turn work loads provide additional hints that allow K,V caches to be migrated off the critical serving path. By utilizing these hints, SYMPHONY dynamically migrates K,V caches to enable finegrained scheduling of inference requests. Our experiments demonstrate that SYMPHONY can handle over 8x the number of requests compared to state-of-the-art baselines, with a similar latency profile.

### Multi-Strided Access Patterns to Boost Hardware Prefetching
**Authors**: Miguel O. Blom, Kristian F. D. Rietveld, Rob V. van Nieuwpoort

**Updated**: 2024-12-20T15:51:42Z

**Summary**: Important memory-bound kernels, such as linear algebra, convolutions, and stencils, rely on SIMD instructions as well as optimizations targeting improved vectorized data traversal and data re-use to attain satisfactory performance. On on temporary CPU architectures, the hardware prefetcher is of key importance for efficient utilization of the memory hierarchy. In this paper, we demonstrate that transforming a memory access pattern consisting of a single stride to one that concurrently accesses multiple strides, can boost the utilization of the hardware prefetcher, and in turn improves the performance of memory-bound kernels significantly. Using a set of micro-benchmarks, we establish that accessing memory in a multi-strided manner enables more cache lines to be concurrently brought into the cache, resulting in improved cache hit ratios and higher effective memory bandwidth without the introduction of costly software prefetch instructions. Subsequently, we show that multi-strided variants of a collection of six memory-bound dense compute kernels outperform state-of-the-art counterparts on three different micro-architectures. More specifically, for kernels among which Matrix Vector Multiplication, Convolution Stencil and kernels from PolyBench, we achieve significant speedups of up to 12.55x over Polly, 2.99x over MKL, 1.98x over OpenBLAS, 1.08x over Halide and 1.87x over OpenCV. The code transformation to take advantage of multi-strided memory access is a natural extension of the loop unroll and loop interchange techniques, allowing this method to be incorporated into compiler pipelines in the future.

### Towards Projected and Incremental Pseudo-Boolean Model Counting
**Authors**: Suwei Yang, Kuldeep S. Meel

**Updated**: 2024-12-20T15:18:44Z

**Summary**: Model counting is a fundamental task that involves determining the number of satisfying assignments to a logical formula, typically in conjunctive normal form (CNF). While CNF model counting has received extensive attention over recent decades, interest in Pseudo-Boolean (PB) model counting is just emerging partly due to the greater flexibility of PB formulas. As such, we observed feature gaps in existing PB counters such as a lack of support for projected and incremental settings, which could hinder adoption. In this work, our main contribution is the introduction of the PB model counter PBCount2, the first exact PB model counter with support for projected and incremental model counting. Our counter, PBCount2, uses our Least Occurrence Weighted Min Degree (LOW-MD) computation ordering heuristic to support projected model counting and a cache mechanism to enable incremental model counting. In our evaluations, PBCount2 completed at least 1.40x the number of benchmarks of competing methods for projected model counting and at least 1.18x of competing methods in incremental model counting.

### Don't Do RAG: When Cache-Augmented Generation is All You Need for   Knowledge Tasks
**Authors**: Brian J Chan, Chao-Ting Chen, Jui-Hung Cheng, Hen-Hsen Huang

**Updated**: 2024-12-20T06:58:32Z

**Summary**: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has gained traction as a powerful approach for enhancing language models by integrating external knowledge sources. However, RAG introduces challenges such as retrieval latency, potential errors in document selection, and increased system complexity. With the advent of large language models (LLMs) featuring significantly extended context windows, this paper proposes an alternative paradigm, cache-augmented generation (CAG) that bypasses real-time retrieval. Our method involves preloading all relevant resources, especially when the documents or knowledge for retrieval are of a limited and manageable size, into the LLM's extended context and caching its runtime parameters. During inference, the model utilizes these preloaded parameters to answer queries without additional retrieval steps. Comparative analyses reveal that CAG eliminates retrieval latency and minimizes retrieval errors while maintaining context relevance. Performance evaluations across multiple benchmarks highlight scenarios where long-context LLMs either outperform or complement traditional RAG pipelines. These findings suggest that, for certain applications, particularly those with a constrained knowledge base, CAG provide a streamlined and efficient alternative to RAG, achieving comparable or superior results with reduced complexity.

### DroidSpeak: KV Cache Sharing for Cross-LLM Communication and Multi-LLM   Serving
**Authors**: Yuhan Liu, Yuyang Huang, Jiayi Yao, Zhuohan Gu, Kuntai Du, Hanchen Li, Yihua Cheng, Junchen Jiang, Shan Lu, Madan Musuvathi, Esha Choukse

**Updated**: 2024-12-19T23:52:16Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in complex workflows, where different LLMs and fine-tuned variants collaboratively address complex tasks. However, these systems face significant inefficiencies due to redundant context processing of the shared context. We propose DroidSpeak, a framework that optimizes context sharing between fine-tuned LLMs derived from the same foundational model. DroidSpeak identifies critical layers in the KV cache and selectively recomputes them, enabling effective reuse of intermediate data while maintaining high accuracy.   Our approach balances computational efficiency and task fidelity, significantly reducing inference latency and throughput bottlenecks. Experiments on diverse datasets and model pairs demonstrate that DroidSpeak achieves up to 3x higher throughputs and 2.6x faster prefill times with negligible accuracy loss compared to full recomputation.

### Exposing Shadow Branches
**Authors**: Chrysanthos Pepi, Bhargav Reddy Godala, Krishnam Tibrewala, Gino Chacon, Paul V. Gratz, Daniel A. JimÃ©nez, Gilles A. Pokam, David I. August

**Updated**: 2024-12-19T22:34:37Z

**Summary**: Modern processors implement a decoupled front-end in the form of Fetch Directed Instruction Prefetching (FDIP) to avoid front-end stalls. FDIP is driven by the Branch Prediction Unit (BPU), relying on the BPU's accuracy and branch target tracking structures to speculatively fetch instructions into the Instruction Cache (L1I). As data center applications become more complex, their code footprints also grow, resulting in an increase in Branch Target Buffer (BTB) misses. FDIP can alleviate L1I cache misses, but when it encounters a BTB miss, the BPU may not identify the current instruction as a branch to FDIP. This can prevent FDIP from prefetching or cause it to speculate down the wrong path, further polluting the L1I cache. We observe that the vast majority, 75%, of BTB-missing, unidentified branches are actually present in instruction cache lines that FDIP has previously fetched but, these missing branches have not yet been decoded and inserted into the BTB. This is because the instruction line is decoded from an entry point (which is the target of the previous taken branch) till an exit point (the taken branch). Branch instructions present in the ignored portion of the cache line we call them "Shadow Branches". Here we present Skeia, a novel shadow branch decoding technique that identifies and decodes unused bytes in cache lines fetched by FDIP, inserting them into a Shadow Branch Buffer (SBB). The SBB is accessed in parallel with the BTB, allowing FDIP to speculate despite a BTB miss. With a minimal storage state of 12.25KB, Skeia delivers a geomean speedup of ~5.7% over an 8K-entry BTB (78KB) and ~2% versus adding an equal amount of state to the BTB across 16 front-end bound applications. Since many branches stored in the SBB are unique compared to those in a similarly sized BTB, we consistently observe greater performance gains with Skeia across all examined sizes until saturation.

### DynamicKV: Task-Aware Adaptive KV Cache Compression for Long Context   LLMs
**Authors**: Xiabin Zhou, Wenbin Wang, Minyan Zeng, Jiaxian Guo, Xuebo Liu, Li Shen, Min Zhang, Liang Ding

**Updated**: 2024-12-19T13:28:42Z

**Summary**: Efficient KV cache management in LLMs is crucial for long-context tasks like RAG and summarization. Existing KV cache compression methods enforce a fixed pattern, neglecting task-specific characteristics and reducing the retention of essential information. However, we observe distinct activation patterns across layers in various tasks, highlighting the need for adaptive strategies tailored to each task's unique demands. Based on this insight, we propose DynamicKV, a method that dynamically optimizes token retention by adjusting the number of tokens retained at each layer to adapt to the specific task. DynamicKV establishes global and per-layer maximum KV cache budgets, temporarily retaining the maximum budget for the current layer, and periodically updating the KV cache sizes of all preceding layers during inference. Our method retains only 1.7% of the KV cache size while achieving ~85% of the Full KV cache performance on LongBench. Notably, even under extreme compression (0.9%), DynamicKV surpasses state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods by 11% in the Needle-in-a-Haystack test using Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2. The code will be released.

### Accelerating Diffusion Transformers with Token-wise Feature Caching
**Authors**: Chang Zou, Xuyang Liu, Ting Liu, Siteng Huang, Linfeng Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-12-19T12:38:23Z

**Summary**: Diffusion transformers have shown significant effectiveness in both image and video synthesis at the expense of huge computation costs. To address this problem, feature caching methods have been introduced to accelerate diffusion transformers by caching the features in previous timesteps and reusing them in the following timesteps. However, previous caching methods ignore that different tokens exhibit different sensitivities to feature caching, and feature caching on some tokens may lead to 10$\times$ more destruction to the overall generation quality compared with other tokens. In this paper, we introduce token-wise feature caching, allowing us to adaptively select the most suitable tokens for caching, and further enable us to apply different caching ratios to neural layers in different types and depths. Extensive experiments on PixArt-$\alpha$, OpenSora, and DiT demonstrate our effectiveness in both image and video generation with no requirements for training. For instance, 2.36$\times$ and 1.93$\times$ acceleration are achieved on OpenSora and PixArt-$\alpha$ with almost no drop in generation quality.

### Nemesis: Noise-randomized Encryption with Modular Efficiency and Secure   Integration in Machine Learning Systems
**Authors**: Dongfang Zhao

**Updated**: 2024-12-18T22:52:12Z

**Summary**: Machine learning (ML) systems that guarantee security and privacy often rely on Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) as a cornerstone technique, enabling computations on encrypted data without exposing sensitive information. However, a critical limitation of FHE is its computational inefficiency, making it impractical for large-scale applications. In this work, we propose \textit{Nemesis}, a framework that accelerates FHE-based systems without compromising accuracy or security. The design of Nemesis is inspired by Rache (SIGMOD'23), which introduced a caching mechanism for encrypted integers and scalars. Nemesis extends this idea with more advanced caching techniques and mathematical tools, enabling efficient operations over multi-slot FHE schemes and overcoming Rache's limitations to support general plaintext structures. We formally prove the security of Nemesis under standard cryptographic assumptions and evaluate its performance extensively on widely used datasets, including MNIST, FashionMNIST, and CIFAR-10. Experimental results show that Nemesis significantly reduces the computational overhead of FHE-based ML systems, paving the way for broader adoption of privacy-preserving technologies.

### ResQ: Mixed-Precision Quantization of Large Language Models with   Low-Rank Residuals
**Authors**: Utkarsh Saxena, Sayeh Sharify, Kaushik Roy, Xin Wang

**Updated**: 2024-12-18T22:01:55Z

**Summary**: Post-training quantization (PTQ) of large language models (LLMs) holds the promise in reducing the prohibitive computational cost at inference time. Quantization of all weight, activation and key-value (KV) cache tensors to 4-bit without significantly degrading generalizability is challenging, due to the high quantization error caused by extreme outliers in activations. To tackle this problem, we propose ResQ, a PTQ method that pushes further the state-of-the-art. By means of principal component analysis (PCA), it identifies a low-rank subspace (in practice 1/8 of the hidden dimension) in which activation variances are highest, and keep the coefficients within this subspace in high precision, e.g. 8-bit, while quantizing the rest to 4-bit. Within each subspace, invariant random rotation is applied to further suppress outliers. We show that this is a provably optimal mixed precision quantization scheme that minimizes error. With the Llama families of models, we demonstrate that ResQ outperforms recent uniform and mixed precision PTQ methods on a variety of benchmarks, achieving up to 33% lower perplexity on Wikitext than the next best method SpinQuant, and a 2.4x speedup over 16-bit baseline. Code is available at https://github.com/utkarsh-dmx/project-resq.

### Optimizing ML Concurrent Computation and Communication with GPU DMA   Engines
**Authors**: Anirudha Agrawal, Shaizeen Aga, Suchita Pati, Mahzabeen Islam

**Updated**: 2024-12-18T21:09:08Z

**Summary**: Concurrent computation and communication (C3) is a pervasive paradigm in ML and other domains, making its performance optimization crucial. In this paper, we carefully characterize C3 in ML on GPUs, which are most widely deployed for ML training and inference. We observe that while C3 leads to performance uplifts, the uplifts are far lower than ideal speedups (serial computation and communication versus maximum of computation or communication; all times from isolated executions). C3 on average achieves only 21% of ideal speedup, this is due to known challenges of compute and memory interference between concurrent GPU kernels (that is, sharing of GPU's compute units, caches and HBM).   To attain better performance for C3, first, we evaluate dual strategies of schedule prioritization and careful resource partitioning of compute units on GPUs to push performance attained with C3 (on average 42% of ideal speedup). We also provide heuristics that can guide a runtime while employing these strategies. To further enhance C3 performance, we propose to mitigate C3 interference by offloading communication tasks to the GPU's DMA engines. To this end, we build Concurrent Communication CoLlectives (ConCCL) proof-of-concepts that harness DMA engines for communication. We show how ConCCL considerably closes the gap between realized and ideal speedup for C3 (on average 72% of ideal speedup is realized, up to 1.67x speedup). Overall, our work makes a strong case for GPU DMA engine advancements to better support C3 on GPUs.

### MagicPIG: LSH Sampling for Efficient LLM Generation
**Authors**: Zhuoming Chen, Ranajoy Sadhukhan, Zihao Ye, Yang Zhou, Jianyu Zhang, Niklas Nolte, Yuandong Tian, Matthijs Douze, Leon Bottou, Zhihao Jia, Beidi Chen

**Updated**: 2024-12-18T17:36:36Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) with long context windows have gained significant attention. However, the KV cache, stored to avoid re-computation, becomes a bottleneck. Various dynamic sparse or TopK-based attention approximation methods have been proposed to leverage the common insight that attention is sparse. In this paper, we first show that TopK attention itself suffers from quality degradation in certain downstream tasks because attention is not always as sparse as expected. Rather than selecting the keys and values with the highest attention scores, sampling with theoretical guarantees can provide a better estimation for attention output. To make the sampling-based approximation practical in LLM generation, we propose MagicPIG, a heterogeneous system based on Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH). MagicPIG significantly reduces the workload of attention computation while preserving high accuracy for diverse tasks. MagicPIG stores the LSH hash tables and runs the attention computation on the CPU, which allows it to serve longer contexts and larger batch sizes with high approximation accuracy. MagicPIG can improve decoding throughput by up to $5\times$ across various GPU hardware and achieve 54ms decoding latency on a single RTX 4090 for Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct model with a context of 96k tokens. The code is available at https://github.com/Infini-AI-Lab/MagicPIG.

### Rehearsal-Free Continual Federated Learning with Synergistic   Regularization
**Authors**: Yichen Li, Yuying Wang, Tianzhe Xiao, Haozhao Wang, Yining Qi, Ruixuan Li

**Updated**: 2024-12-18T12:16:41Z

**Summary**: Continual Federated Learning (CFL) allows distributed devices to collaboratively learn novel concepts from continuously shifting training data while avoiding knowledge forgetting of previously seen tasks. To tackle this challenge, most current CFL approaches rely on extensive rehearsal of previous data. Despite effectiveness, rehearsal comes at a cost to memory, and it may also violate data privacy. Considering these, we seek to apply regularization techniques to CFL by considering their cost-efficient properties that do not require sample caching or rehearsal. Specifically, we first apply traditional regularization techniques to CFL and observe that existing regularization techniques, especially synaptic intelligence, can achieve promising results under homogeneous data distribution but fail when the data is heterogeneous. Based on this observation, we propose a simple yet effective regularization algorithm for CFL named FedSSI, which tailors the synaptic intelligence for the CFL with heterogeneous data settings. FedSSI can not only reduce computational overhead without rehearsal but also address the data heterogeneity issue. Extensive experiments show that FedSSI achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

### Semantic Convergence: Harmonizing Recommender Systems via Two-Stage   Alignment and Behavioral Semantic Tokenization
**Authors**: Guanghan Li, Xun Zhang, Yufei Zhang, Yifan Yin, Guojun Yin, Wei Lin

**Updated**: 2024-12-18T12:07:58Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs), endowed with exceptional reasoning capabilities, are adept at discerning profound user interests from historical behaviors, thereby presenting a promising avenue for the advancement of recommendation systems. However, a notable discrepancy persists between the sparse collaborative semantics typically found in recommendation systems and the dense token representations within LLMs. In our study, we propose a novel framework that harmoniously merges traditional recommendation models with the prowess of LLMs. We initiate this integration by transforming ItemIDs into sequences that align semantically with the LLMs space, through the proposed Alignment Tokenization module. Additionally, we design a series of specialized supervised learning tasks aimed at aligning collaborative signals with the subtleties of natural language semantics. To ensure practical applicability, we optimize online inference by pre-caching the top-K results for each user, reducing latency and improving effciency. Extensive experimental evidence indicates that our model markedly improves recall metrics and displays remarkable scalability of recommendation systems.

### DyCoke: Dynamic Compression of Tokens for Fast Video Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Keda Tao, Can Qin, Haoxuan You, Yang Sui, Huan Wang

**Updated**: 2024-12-18T09:47:25Z

**Summary**: Video large language models (VLLMs) have significantly advanced recently in processing complex video content, yet their inference efficiency remains constrained because of the high computational cost stemming from the thousands of visual tokens generated from the video inputs. We empirically observe that, unlike single image inputs, VLLMs typically attend visual tokens from different frames at different decoding iterations, making a one-shot pruning strategy prone to removing important tokens by mistake. Motivated by this, we present DyCoke, a training-free token compression method to optimize token representation and accelerate VLLMs. DyCoke incorporates a plug-and-play temporal compression module to minimize temporal redundancy by merging redundant tokens across frames, and applies dynamic KV cache reduction to prune spatially redundant tokens selectively. It ensures high-quality inference by dynamically retaining the critical tokens at each decoding step. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that DyCoke can outperform the prior SoTA counterparts, achieving 1.5X inference speedup, 1.4X memory reduction against the baseline VLLM, while still improving the performance, with no training.

### SCOPE: Optimizing Key-Value Cache Compression in Long-context Generation
**Authors**: Jialong Wu, Zhenglin Wang, Linhai Zhang, Yilong Lai, Yulan He, Deyu Zhou

**Updated**: 2024-12-18T09:27:33Z

**Summary**: Key-Value (KV) cache has become a bottleneck of LLMs for long-context generation. Despite the numerous efforts in this area, the optimization for the decoding phase is generally ignored. However, we believe such optimization is crucial, especially for long-output generation tasks based on the following two observations: (i) Excessive compression during the prefill phase, which requires specific full context impairs the comprehension of the reasoning task; (ii) Deviation of heavy hitters occurs in the reasoning tasks with long outputs. Therefore, SCOPE, a simple yet efficient framework that separately performs KV cache optimization during the prefill and decoding phases, is introduced. Specifically, the KV cache during the prefill phase is preserved to maintain the essential information, while a novel strategy based on sliding is proposed to select essential heavy hitters for the decoding phase. Memory usage and memory transfer are further optimized using adaptive and discontinuous strategies. Extensive experiments on LongGenBench show the effectiveness and generalization of SCOPE and its compatibility as a plug-in to other prefill-only KV compression methods.

### ZipVL: Efficient Large Vision-Language Models with Dynamic Token   Sparsification
**Authors**: Yefei He, Feng Chen, Jing Liu, Wenqi Shao, Hong Zhou, Kaipeng Zhang, Bohan Zhuang

**Updated**: 2024-12-18T07:45:11Z

**Summary**: The efficiency of large vision-language models (LVLMs) is constrained by the computational bottleneck of the attention mechanism during the prefill phase and the memory bottleneck of fetching the key-value (KV) cache in the decoding phase, particularly in scenarios involving high-resolution images or videos. Visual content often exhibits substantial redundancy, resulting in highly sparse attention maps within LVLMs. This sparsity can be leveraged to accelerate attention computation or compress the KV cache through various approaches. However, most studies focus on addressing only one of these bottlenecks and do not adequately support dynamic adjustment of sparsity concerning distinct layers or tasks. In this paper, we present ZipVL, an efficient inference framework designed for LVLMs through a dynamic ratio allocation strategy of important tokens. This ratio is adaptively determined based on the layer-specific distribution of attention scores, rather than fixed hyper-parameters, thereby improving efficiency for less complex tasks while maintaining high performance for more challenging ones. Then we select important tokens based on their normalized attention scores and perform sparse attention mechanism solely on those important tokens, reducing the latency in the prefill phase. Tokens deemed less important will be discarded to reduce KV cache size, alleviating the memory bottleneck in the decoding phase. Our experiments demonstrate that ZipVL can accelerate the prefill phase by 2.3$\times$ and improve decoding throughput by 2.8$\times$, with a minimal accuracy reduction of only 0.5\% on VQAv2 benchmark over LLaVA-Next-13B model, effectively enhancing the generation efficiency of LVLMs.

**Authors**: Yunqi Guo, Kaiyuan Hou, Heming Fu, Hongkai Chen, Zhenyu Yan, Guoliang Xing, Xiaofan Jiang

**Updated**: 2024-12-18T05:16:11Z

**Summary**: Understanding sensor data can be challenging for non-experts because of the complexity and unique semantic meanings of sensor modalities. This calls for intuitive and effective methods to present sensor information. However, creating intuitive sensor data visualizations presents three key challenges: the variability of sensor readings, gaps in domain comprehension, and the dynamic nature of sensor data. To address these issues, we develop Vivar, a novel AR system that integrates multi-modal sensor data and presents 3D volumetric content for visualization. In particular, we introduce a cross-modal embedding approach that maps sensor data into a pre-trained visual embedding space through barycentric interpolation. This allows for accurate and continuous integration of multi-modal sensor information. Vivar also incorporates sensor-aware AR scene generation using foundation models and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) without requiring domain expertise. In addition, Vivar leverages latent reuse and caching strategies to accelerate 2D and AR content generation. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our system achieves 11$\times$ latency reduction without compromising quality. A user study involving over 485 participants, including domain experts, demonstrates Vivar's effectiveness in accuracy, consistency, and real-world applicability, paving the way for more intuitive sensor data visualization.

### Boosting Long-Context Management via Query-Guided Activation Refilling
**Authors**: Hongjin Qian, Zheng Liu, Peitian Zhang, Zhicheng Dou, Defu Lian

**Updated**: 2024-12-18T05:08:39Z

**Summary**: Processing long contexts poses a significant challenge for large language models (LLMs) due to their inherent context-window limitations and the computational burden of extensive key-value (KV) activations, which severely impact efficiency. For information-seeking tasks, full context perception is often unnecessary, as a query's information needs can dynamically range from localized details to a global perspective, depending on its complexity. However, existing methods struggle to adapt effectively to these dynamic information needs.   In the paper, we propose a method for processing long-context information-seeking tasks via query-guided Activation Refilling (ACRE). ACRE constructs a Bi-layer KV Cache for long contexts, where the layer-1 (L1) cache compactly captures global information, and the layer-2 (L2) cache provides detailed and localized information. ACRE establishes a proxying relationship between the two caches, allowing the input query to attend to the L1 cache and dynamically refill it with relevant entries from the L2 cache. This mechanism integrates global understanding with query-specific local details, thus improving answer decoding. Experiments on a variety of long-context information-seeking datasets demonstrate ACRE's effectiveness, achieving improvements in both performance and efficiency.

### Dynamic-LLaVA: Efficient Multimodal Large Language Models via Dynamic   Vision-language Context Sparsification
**Authors**: Wenxuan Huang, Zijie Zhai, Yunhang Shen, Shaosheng Cao, Fei Zhao, Xiangfeng Xu, Zheyu Ye, Shaohui Lin

**Updated**: 2024-12-17T14:45:12Z

**Summary**: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success in vision understanding, reasoning, and interaction. However, the inference computation and memory increase progressively with the generation of output tokens during decoding, directly affecting the efficacy of MLLMs. Existing methods attempt to reduce the vision context redundancy to achieve efficient MLLMs. Unfortunately, the efficiency benefits of the vision context reduction in the prefill stage gradually diminish during the decoding stage. To address this problem, we proposed a dynamic vision-language context sparsification framework Dynamic-LLaVA, which dynamically reduces the redundancy of vision context in the prefill stage and decreases the memory and computation overhead of the generated language context during decoding. Dynamic-LLaVA designs a tailored sparsification inference scheme for different inference modes, i.e., prefill, decoding with and without KV cache, to achieve efficient inference of MLLMs. In practice, Dynamic-LLaVA can reduce computation consumption by $\sim$75\% in the prefill stage. Meanwhile, throughout the entire generation process of MLLMs, Dynamic-LLaVA reduces the $\sim$50\% computation consumption under decoding without KV cache, while saving $\sim$50\% GPU memory overhead when decoding with KV cache, due to the vision-language context sparsification. Extensive experiments also demonstrate that Dynamic-LLaVA achieves efficient inference for MLLMs with negligible understanding and generation ability degradation or even performance gains compared to the full-context inference baselines. Code is available at https://github.com/Osilly/dynamic_llava .

### Efficient Diffusion Transformer Policies with Mixture of Expert   Denoisers for Multitask Learning
**Authors**: Moritz Reuss, Jyothish Pari, Pulkit Agrawal, Rudolf Lioutikov

**Updated**: 2024-12-17T14:34:51Z

**Summary**: Diffusion Policies have become widely used in Imitation Learning, offering several appealing properties, such as generating multimodal and discontinuous behavior. As models are becoming larger to capture more complex capabilities, their computational demands increase, as shown by recent scaling laws. Therefore, continuing with the current architectures will present a computational roadblock. To address this gap, we propose Mixture-of-Denoising Experts (MoDE) as a novel policy for Imitation Learning. MoDE surpasses current state-of-the-art Transformer-based Diffusion Policies while enabling parameter-efficient scaling through sparse experts and noise-conditioned routing, reducing both active parameters by 40% and inference costs by 90% via expert caching. Our architecture combines this efficient scaling with noise-conditioned self-attention mechanism, enabling more effective denoising across different noise levels. MoDE achieves state-of-the-art performance on 134 tasks in four established imitation learning benchmarks (CALVIN and LIBERO). Notably, by pretraining MoDE on diverse robotics data, we achieve 4.01 on CALVIN ABC and 0.95 on LIBERO-90. It surpasses both CNN-based and Transformer Diffusion Policies by an average of 57% across 4 benchmarks, while using 90% fewer FLOPs and fewer active parameters compared to default Diffusion Transformer architectures. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive ablations on MoDE's components, providing insights for designing efficient and scalable Transformer architectures for Diffusion Policies. Code and demonstrations are available at https://mbreuss.github.io/MoDE_Diffusion_Policy/.

### ZoRI: Towards Discriminative Zero-Shot Remote Sensing Instance   Segmentation
**Authors**: Shiqi Huang, Shuting He, Bihan Wen

**Updated**: 2024-12-17T11:00:56Z

**Summary**: Instance segmentation algorithms in remote sensing are typically based on conventional methods, limiting their application to seen scenarios and closed-set predictions. In this work, we propose a novel task called zero-shot remote sensing instance segmentation, aimed at identifying aerial objects that are absent from training data. Challenges arise when classifying aerial categories with high inter-class similarity and intra-class variance. Besides, the domain gap between vision-language models' pretraining datasets and remote sensing datasets hinders the zero-shot capabilities of the pretrained model when it is directly applied to remote sensing images. To address these challenges, we propose a $\textbf{Z}$ero-Sh$\textbf{o}$t $\textbf{R}$emote Sensing $\textbf{I}$nstance Segmentation framework, dubbed $\textbf{ZoRI}$. Our approach features a discrimination-enhanced classifier that uses refined textual embeddings to increase the awareness of class disparities. Instead of direct fine-tuning, we propose a knowledge-maintained adaptation strategy that decouples semantic-related information to preserve the pretrained vision-language alignment while adjusting features to capture remote sensing domain-specific visual cues. Additionally, we introduce a prior-injected prediction with cache bank of aerial visual prototypes to supplement the semantic richness of text embeddings and seamlessly integrate aerial representations, adapting to the remote sensing domain. We establish new experimental protocols and benchmarks, and extensive experiments convincingly demonstrate that ZoRI achieves the state-of-art performance on the zero-shot remote sensing instance segmentation task. Our code is available at https://github.com/HuangShiqi128/ZoRI.

### More Tokens, Lower Precision: Towards the Optimal Token-Precision   Trade-off in KV Cache Compression
**Authors**: Jiebin Zhang, Dawei Zhu, Yifan Song, Wenhao Wu, Chuqiao Kuang, Xiaoguang Li, Lifeng Shang, Qun Liu, Sujian Li

**Updated**: 2024-12-17T09:20:31Z

**Summary**: As large language models (LLMs) process increasing context windows, the memory usage of KV cache has become a critical bottleneck during inference. The mainstream KV compression methods, including KV pruning and KV quantization, primarily focus on either token or precision dimension and seldom explore the efficiency of their combination. In this paper, we comprehensively investigate the token-precision trade-off in KV cache compression. Experiments demonstrate that storing more tokens in the KV cache with lower precision, i.e., quantized pruning, can significantly enhance the long-context performance of LLMs. Furthermore, in-depth analysis regarding token-precision trade-off from a series of key aspects exhibit that, quantized pruning achieves substantial improvements in retrieval-related tasks and consistently performs well across varying input lengths. Moreover, quantized pruning demonstrates notable stability across different KV pruning methods, quantization strategies, and model scales. These findings provide valuable insights into the token-precision trade-off in KV cache compression. We plan to release our code in the near future.

### FiRST: Finetuning Router-Selective Transformers for Input-Adaptive   Latency Reduction
**Authors**: Akriti Jain, Saransh Sharma, Koyel Mukherjee, Soumyabrata Pal

**Updated**: 2024-12-17T09:11:47Z

**Summary**: Auto-regressive Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable performance across different domains such as vision and language processing. However, due to sequential processing through a stack of transformer layers, autoregressive decoding faces significant computation/latency challenges, particularly in resource-constrained environments like mobile and edge devices. Existing approaches in literature that aim to improve latency via skipping layers have two distinct flavors - 1) Early exit, and 2) Input-agnostic heuristics where tokens exit at pre-determined layers irrespective of input sequence. Both the above strategies have limitations - the former cannot be applied to handle KV Caching necessary for speed-ups in modern framework and the latter does not capture the variation in layer importance across tasks or more generally, across input sequences. To address both limitations, we propose FiRST, an algorithm that reduces inference latency by using layer-specific routers to select a subset of transformer layers adaptively for each input sequence - the prompt (during the prefill stage) decides which layers will be skipped during decoding. FiRST preserves compatibility with KV caching enabling faster inference while being quality-aware. FiRST is model-agnostic and can be easily enabled on any pre-trained LLM. Our approach reveals that input adaptivity is critical - indeed, different task-specific middle layers play a crucial role in evolving hidden representations depending on tasks. Extensive experiments show that FiRST significantly reduces latency while outperforming other layer selection strategies in quality metics. It retains competitive performance to base model (without layer skipping) and in some cases, even improves upon it. FiRST is thus a promising and efficient solution for LLM deployment in low-resource environments.

### TurboAttention: Efficient Attention Approximation For High Throughputs   LLMs
**Authors**: Hao Kang, Srikant Bharadwaj, James Hensman, Tushar Krishna, Victor Ruhle, Saravan Rajmohan

**Updated**: 2024-12-17T05:40:09Z

**Summary**: Large language model (LLM) inference demands significant amount of computation and memory, especially in the key attention mechanism. While techniques, such as quantization and acceleration algorithms, like FlashAttention, have improved efficiency of the overall inference, they address different aspects of the problem: quantization focuses on weight-activation operations, while FlashAttention improves execution but requires high-precision formats. Recent Key-value (KV) cache quantization reduces memory bandwidth but still needs floating-point dequantization for attention operation.   We present TurboAttention, a comprehensive approach to enable quantized execution of attention that simultaneously addresses both memory and computational efficiency. Our solution introduces two key innovations: FlashQ, a headwise attention quantization technique that enables both compression of KV cache and quantized execution of activation-activation multiplication, and Sparsity-based Softmax Approximation (SAS), which eliminates the need for dequantization to FP32 during exponentiation operation in attention. Experimental results demonstrate that TurboAttention achieves 1.2-1.8x speedup in attention, reduces the KV cache size by over 4.4x, and enables up to 2.37x maximum throughput over the FP16 baseline while outperforming state-of-the-art quantization and compression techniques across various datasets and models.

### Personalized Federated Deep Reinforcement Learning for Heterogeneous   Edge Content Caching Networks
**Authors**: Zhen Li, Tan Li, Hai Liu, Tse-Tin Chan

**Updated**: 2024-12-17T05:09:45Z

**Summary**: Proactive caching is essential for minimizing latency and improving Quality of Experience (QoE) in multi-server edge networks. Federated Deep Reinforcement Learning (FDRL) is a promising approach for developing cache policies tailored to dynamic content requests. However, FDRL faces challenges such as an expanding caching action space due to increased content numbers and difficulty in adapting global information to heterogeneous edge environments. In this paper, we propose a Personalized Federated Deep Reinforcement Learning framework for Caching, called PF-DRL-Ca, with the aim to maximize system utility while satisfying caching capability constraints. To manage the expanding action space, we employ a new DRL algorithm, Multi-head Deep Q-Network (MH-DQN), which reshapes the action output layers of DQN into a multi-head structure where each head generates a sub-dimensional action. We next integrate the proposed MH-DQN into a personalized federated training framework, employing a layer-wise approach for training to derive a personalized model that can adapt to heterogeneous environments while exploiting the global information to accelerate learning convergence. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of MH-DQN over traditional DRL algorithms on a single server, as well as the advantages of the personal federated training architecture compared to other frameworks.

### A System for Microserving of LLMs
**Authors**: Hongyi Jin, Ruihang Lai, Charlie F. Ruan, Yingcheng Wang, Todd C. Mowry, Xupeng Miao, Zhihao Jia, Tianqi Chen

**Updated**: 2024-12-17T02:44:43Z

**Summary**: The recent advances in LLMs bring a strong demand for efficient system support to improve overall serving efficiency. As LLM inference scales towards multiple GPUs and even multiple compute nodes, various coordination patterns, such as prefill-decode disaggregation and context migration, arise in serving systems. Most inference services today expose a coarse-grained request-level API with a pre-configured coordination strategy, limiting the ability to customize and dynamically reconfigure the coordination. In this paper, we propose LLM microserving, a multi-level architecture for structuring and programming LLM inference services. We introduces simple yet effective microserving APIs to support fine-grained sub-request level actions. A programmable router transforms user requests into sub-request calls, enabling the dynamic reconfiguration of serving patterns. To support diverse execution patterns, we develop a unified KV cache interface that handles various KV compute, transfer, and reuse scenarios. Our evaluation shows that LLM microserving can be reconfigured to support multiple disaggregation orchestration strategies in a few lines of Python code while maintaining state-of-the-art performance for LLM inference tasks. Additionally, it allows us to explore new strategy variants that reduce up to 47% of job completion time compared to the existing strategies.

**Authors**: Xuan Shen, Zhao Song, Yufa Zhou, Bo Chen, Yanyu Li, Yifan Gong, Kai Zhang, Hao Tan, Jason Kuen, Henghui Ding, Zhihao Shu, Wei Niu, Pu Zhao, Yanzhi Wang, Jiuxiang Gu

**Updated**: 2024-12-17T01:12:35Z

**Summary**: Diffusion Transformers have emerged as the preeminent models for a wide array of generative tasks, demonstrating superior performance and efficacy across various applications. The promising results come at the cost of slow inference, as each denoising step requires running the whole transformer model with a large amount of parameters. In this paper, we show that performing the full computation of the model at each diffusion step is unnecessary, as some computations can be skipped by lazily reusing the results of previous steps. Furthermore, we show that the lower bound of similarity between outputs at consecutive steps is notably high, and this similarity can be linearly approximated using the inputs. To verify our demonstrations, we propose the \textbf{LazyDiT}, a lazy learning framework that efficiently leverages cached results from earlier steps to skip redundant computations. Specifically, we incorporate lazy learning layers into the model, effectively trained to maximize laziness, enabling dynamic skipping of redundant computations. Experimental results show that LazyDiT outperforms the DDIM sampler across multiple diffusion transformer models at various resolutions. Furthermore, we implement our method on mobile devices, achieving better performance than DDIM with similar latency.

### The Selection Problem in Multi-Query Optimization: a Comprehensive   Survey
**Authors**: Sergey Zinchenko, Denis Ponomaryov

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T14:49:32Z

**Summary**: View materialization, index selection, and plan caching are well-known techniques for optimization of query processing in database systems. The essence of these tasks is to select and save a subset of the most useful candidates (views/indexes/plans) for reuse within given space/time budget constraints. In this paper, based on the View Selection Problem, we propose a unified view on these problems. We identify the root causes of the complexity of these selection problems and provide a detailed analysis of techniques to cope with them. Our survey provides a modern classification of selection algorithms known in the literature, including the latest ones based on Machine Learning. We provide a ground for the reuse of the selection techniques between different optimization scenarios and highlight challenges and promising directions in the field.

### CSR:Achieving 1 Bit Key-Value Cache via Sparse Representation
**Authors**: Hongxuan Zhang, Yao Zhao, Jiaqi Zheng, Chenyi Zhuang, Jinjie Gu, Guihai Chen

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T13:01:53Z

**Summary**: The emergence of long-context text applications utilizing large language models (LLMs) has presented significant scalability challenges, particularly in memory footprint. The linear growth of the Key-Value (KV) cache responsible for storing attention keys and values to minimize redundant computations can lead to substantial increases in memory consumption, potentially causing models to fail to serve with limited memory resources. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach called Cache Sparse Representation (CSR), which converts the KV cache by transforming the dense Key-Value cache tensor into sparse indexes and weights, offering a more memory-efficient representation during LLM inference. Furthermore, we introduce NeuralDict, a novel neural network-based method for automatically generating the dictionary used in our sparse representation. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that CSR achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art KV cache quantization algorithms while maintaining robust functionality in memory-constrained environments.

### AsymRnR: Video Diffusion Transformers Acceleration with Asymmetric   Reduction and Restoration
**Authors**: Wenhao Sun, Rong-Cheng Tu, Jingyi Liao, Zhao Jin, Dacheng Tao

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T12:28:22Z

**Summary**: Video Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated significant potential for generating high-fidelity videos but are computationally intensive. Existing acceleration methods include distillation, which requires costly retraining, and feature caching, which is highly sensitive to network architecture. Recent token reduction methods are training-free and architecture-agnostic, offering greater flexibility and wider applicability. However, they enforce the same sequence length across different components, constraining their acceleration potential. We observe that intra-sequence redundancy in video DiTs varies across features, blocks, and denoising timesteps. Building on this observation, we propose Asymmetric Reduction and Restoration (AsymRnR), a training-free approach to accelerate video DiTs. It offers a flexible and adaptive strategy that reduces the number of tokens based on their redundancy to enhance both acceleration and generation quality. We further propose matching cache to facilitate faster processing. Integrated into state-of-the-art video DiTs, AsymRnR achieves a superior speedup without compromising the quality.

### Ultra-High-Definition Dynamic Multi-Exposure Image Fusion via Infinite   Pixel Learning
**Authors**: Xingchi Chen, Zhuoran Zheng, Xuerui Li, Yuying Chen, Shu Wang, Wenqi Ren

**Updated**: 2024-12-16T11:55:26Z

**Summary**: With the continuous improvement of device imaging resolution, the popularity of Ultra-High-Definition (UHD) images is increasing. Unfortunately, existing methods for fusing multi-exposure images in dynamic scenes are designed for low-resolution images, which makes them inefficient for generating high-quality UHD images on a resource-constrained device. To alleviate the limitations of extremely long-sequence inputs, inspired by the Large Language Model (LLM) for processing infinitely long texts, we propose a novel learning paradigm to achieve UHD multi-exposure dynamic scene image fusion on a single consumer-grade GPU, named Infinite Pixel Learning (IPL). The design of our approach comes from three key components: The first step is to slice the input sequences to relieve the pressure generated by the model processing the data stream; Second, we develop an attention cache technique, which is similar to KV cache for infinite data stream processing; Finally, we design a method for attention cache compression to alleviate the storage burden of the cache on the device. In addition, we provide a new UHD benchmark to evaluate the effectiveness of our method. Extensive experimental results show that our method maintains high-quality visual performance while fusing UHD dynamic multi-exposure images in real-time (>40fps) on a single consumer-grade GPU.

### The "Huh?" Button: Improving Understanding in Educational Videos with   Large Language Models
**Authors**: Boris Ruf, Marcin Detyniecki

**Updated**: 2024-12-15T21:02:16Z

**Summary**: We propose a simple way to use large language models (LLMs) in education. Specifically, our method aims to improve individual comprehension by adding a novel feature to online videos. We combine the low threshold for interactivity in digital experiences with the benefits of rephrased and elaborated explanations typical of face-to-face interactions, thereby supporting to close knowledge gaps at scale. To demonstrate the technical feasibility of our approach, we conducted a proof-of-concept experiment and implemented a prototype which is available for testing online. Through the use case, we also show how caching can be applied in LLM-powered applications to reduce their carbon footprint.

### PULSE: Accelerating Distributed Pointer-Traversals on Disaggregated   Memory (Extended Version)
**Authors**: Yupeng Tang, Seung-seob Lee, Abhishek Bhattacharjee, Anurag Khandelwal

**Updated**: 2024-12-15T03:29:54Z

**Summary**: Caches at CPU nodes in disaggregated memory architectures amortize the high data access latency over the network. However, such caches are fundamentally unable to improve performance for workloads requiring pointer traversals across linked data structures. We argue for accelerating these pointer traversals closer to disaggregated memory in a manner that preserves expressiveness for supporting various linked structures, ensures energy efficiency and performance, and supports distributed execution. We design PULSE, a distributed pointer-traversal framework for rack-scale disaggregated memory to meet all the above requirements. Our evaluation of PULSE shows that it enables low-latency, high-throughput, and energy-efficient execution for a wide range of pointer traversal workloads on disaggregated memory that fare poorly with caching alone.

### SparseMap: Loop Mapping for Sparse CNNs on Streaming Coarse-grained   Reconfigurable Array
**Authors**: Xiaobing Ni, Mengke Ge, Jiaheng Ruan, Song Chen, Yi Kang

**Updated**: 2024-12-15T02:30:09Z

**Summary**: Streaming coarse-grained reconfgurable array (CGRA) is a promising architecture for data/computing-intensive applications because of its fexibility, high throughput and efcient memory system. However,when accelerating sparse CNNs, the irregular input data demands inside sparse CNNs would cause excessive caching operations (COPs) and multi-cycle internal dependencies (MCIDs) between operations, declining the throughput of the streaming CGRA. We propose a mapping method for sparse CNNs onto streaming CGRA, SparseMap, which incorporates an efcient I/O data management along with operation scheduling and binding, to reduce the COPs and MCIDs, thereby ensuring the optimal throughput of streaming CGRA.The experimental results show SparseMap reduces 92.5% COPs and 46.0 % MCIDs while achieves the same or even smaller initiation interval (II) compared to previous works.

### Accelerating Retrieval-Augmented Generation
**Authors**: Derrick Quinn, Mohammad Nouri, Neel Patel, John Salihu, Alireza Salemi, Sukhan Lee, Hamed Zamani, Mohammad Alian

**Updated**: 2024-12-14T06:47:56Z

**Summary**: An evolving solution to address hallucination and enhance accuracy in large language models (LLMs) is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which involves augmenting LLMs with information retrieved from an external knowledge source, such as the web. This paper profiles several RAG execution pipelines and demystifies the complex interplay between their retrieval and generation phases. We demonstrate that while exact retrieval schemes are expensive, they can reduce inference time compared to approximate retrieval variants because an exact retrieval model can send a smaller but more accurate list of documents to the generative model while maintaining the same end-to-end accuracy. This observation motivates the acceleration of the exact nearest neighbor search for RAG.   In this work, we design Intelligent Knowledge Store (IKS), a type-2 CXL device that implements a scale-out near-memory acceleration architecture with a novel cache-coherent interface between the host CPU and near-memory accelerators. IKS offers 13.4-27.9x faster exact nearest neighbor search over a 512GB vector database compared with executing the search on Intel Sapphire Rapids CPUs. This higher search performance translates to 1.7-26.3x lower end-to-end inference time for representative RAG applications. IKS is inherently a memory expander; its internal DRAM can be disaggregated and used for other applications running on the server to prevent DRAM, which is the most expensive component in today's servers, from being stranded.

### RMCSA Algorithm for Congestion-Aware and Service Latency Aware Dynamic   Service Provisioning in Software-Defined SDM-EONs
**Authors**: Baljinder Singh Heera, Shrinivas Petale, Yatindra Nath Singh, Suresh Subramaniam

**Updated**: 2024-12-14T05:20:50Z

**Summary**: The implementation of 5G and the future deployment of 6G necessitate the utilization of optical networks that possess substantial capacity and exhibit minimal latency. The dynamic arrival and departure of connection requests in optical networks result in particular central links experiencing more traffic and congestion than non-central links. The occurrence of congested links leads to service blocking despite the availability of resources within the network, restricting the efficient utilization of network resources. The available algorithms in the literature that aim to balance load among network links offer a trade-off between blocking performance and algorithmic complexity, thus increasing service provisioning time. This work proposes a dynamic routing-based congestion-aware routing, modulation, core, and spectrum assignment (RMCSA) algorithm for space division multiplexing elastic optical networks (SDM-EONs). The algorithm finds alternative candidate paths based on real-time link occupancy metrics to minimize blocking due to link congestion under dynamic traffic scenarios. As a result, the algorithm reduces the formation of congestion hotspots in the network owing to link-betweenness centrality. We have performed extensive simulations using two realistic network topologies to compare the performance of the proposed algorithm with relevant RMCSA algorithms available in the literature. The simulation results verify the superior performance of our proposed algorithm compared to the benchmark Yen's K-shortest paths and K-Disjoint shortest paths RMCSA algorithms in connection blocking ratio and spectrum utilization efficiency. To expedite the route-finding process, we present a novel caching strategy that allows the proposed algorithm to demonstrate a much-reduced service delay time compared to the recently developed adaptive link weight-based load-balancing RMCSA algorithm.

### SCBench: A KV Cache-Centric Analysis of Long-Context Methods
**Authors**: Yucheng Li, Huiqiang Jiang, Qianhui Wu, Xufang Luo, Surin Ahn, Chengruidong Zhang, Amir H. Abdi, Dongsheng Li, Jianfeng Gao, Yuqing Yang, Lili Qiu

**Updated**: 2024-12-13T17:59:52Z

**Summary**: Long-context LLMs have enabled numerous downstream applications but also introduced significant challenges related to computational and memory efficiency. To address these challenges, optimizations for long-context inference have been developed, centered around the KV cache. However, existing benchmarks often evaluate in single-request, neglecting the full lifecycle of the KV cache in real-world use. This oversight is particularly critical, as KV cache reuse has become widely adopted in LLMs inference frameworks, such as vLLM and SGLang, as well as by LLM providers, including OpenAI, Microsoft, Google, and Anthropic. To address this gap, we introduce SCBench(SharedContextBench), a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating long-context methods from a KV cachecentric perspective: 1) KV cache generation, 2) KV cache compression, 3) KV cache retrieval, 4) KV cache loading. Specifically, SCBench uses test examples with shared context, ranging 12 tasks with two shared context modes, covering four categories of long-context capabilities: string retrieval, semantic retrieval, global information, and multi-task. With it, we provide an extensive KV cache-centric analysis of eight categories long-context solutions, including Gated Linear RNNs, Mamba-Attention hybrids, and efficient methods such as sparse attention, KV cache dropping, quantization, retrieval, loading, and prompt compression. The evaluation is conducted on 8 long-context LLMs. Our findings show that sub-O(n) memory methods suffer in multi-turn scenarios, while sparse encoding with O(n) memory and sub-O(n^2) pre-filling computation perform robustly. Dynamic sparsity yields more expressive KV caches than static patterns, and layer-level sparsity in hybrid architectures reduces memory usage with strong performance. Additionally, we identify attention distribution shift issues in long-generation scenarios. https://aka.ms/SCBench.

**Updated**: 2024-12-13T17:37:48Z

**Summary**: We present DeepSeek-VL2, an advanced series of large Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Vision-Language Models that significantly improves upon its predecessor, DeepSeek-VL, through two key major upgrades. For the vision component, we incorporate a dynamic tiling vision encoding strategy designed for processing high-resolution images with different aspect ratios. For the language component, we leverage DeepSeekMoE models with the Multi-head Latent Attention mechanism, which compresses Key-Value cache into latent vectors, to enable efficient inference and high throughput. Trained on an improved vision-language dataset, DeepSeek-VL2 demonstrates superior capabilities across various tasks, including but not limited to visual question answering, optical character recognition, document/table/chart understanding, and visual grounding. Our model series is composed of three variants: DeepSeek-VL2-Tiny, DeepSeek-VL2-Small and DeepSeek-VL2, with 1.0B, 2.8B and 4.5B activated parameters respectively. DeepSeek-VL2 achieves competitive or state-of-the-art performance with similar or fewer activated parameters compared to existing open-source dense and MoE-based models. Codes and pre-trained models are publicly accessible at https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-VL2.

### OASIS-UROS: Open Acquisition System for IEPE Sensors -- Upgraded,   Refined, and Overhauled Software
**Authors**: Oliver Maximilian Zobel, Johannes Maierhofer, Andreas KÃ¶stler, Daniel J. Rixen

**Updated**: 2024-12-13T16:13:39Z

**Summary**: OASIS-UROS continues the previously published Open Acquisition System for IEPE Sensors (OASIS). While still building on the ESP32 microcontroller, this version improves the overall performance by switching to an SD card caching system and upgrading the analog-digital converter to an AD7606C-18, which has a higher resolution, provides eight channels, oversampling, and software-adjustable voltage ranges. Also improved is the IEPE front-end and power supply, as well as the firmware of the acquisition system, which can now achieve a sample rate of up to 36 kHz while sampling all eight channels. This paper documents the hardware and software of OASIS-UROS and provides all materials required to reproduce the open acquisition system. Lastly, the system was validated against commercial hardware and software in an experimental modal analysis context. This showed that the system performs close to the commercial one in some aspects with respect to the utilized test case. While OASIS-UROS cannot match the full performance of the commercial system, the developed system can be a viable alternative for students, people in academia, or smaller companies that have a constrained budget or require complete insight as well as adaptability of the hardware and software.

### EVOS: Efficient Implicit Neural Training via EVOlutionary Selector
**Authors**: Weixiang Zhang, Shuzhao Xie, Chengwei Ren, Siyi Xie, Chen Tang, Shijia Ge, Mingzi Wang, Zhi Wang

**Updated**: 2024-12-13T14:11:42Z

**Summary**: We propose EVOlutionary Selector (EVOS), an efficient training paradigm for accelerating Implicit Neural Representation (INR). Unlike conventional INR training that feeds all samples through the neural network in each iteration, our approach restricts training to strategically selected points, reducing computational overhead by eliminating redundant forward passes. Specifically, we treat each sample as an individual in an evolutionary process, where only those fittest ones survive and merit inclusion in training, adaptively evolving with the neural network dynamics. While this is conceptually similar to Evolutionary Algorithms, their distinct objectives (selection for acceleration vs. iterative solution optimization) require a fundamental redefinition of evolutionary mechanisms for our context. In response, we design sparse fitness evaluation, frequency-guided crossover, and augmented unbiased mutation to comprise EVOS. These components respectively guide sample selection with reduced computational cost, enhance performance through frequency-domain balance, and mitigate selection bias from cached evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves approximately 48%-66% reduction in training time while ensuring superior convergence without additional cost, establishing state-of-the-art acceleration among recent sampling-based strategies.

### Optimal Offline ORAM with Perfect Security via Simple Oblivious Priority   Queues
**Authors**: Thore ThieÃen, Jan Vahrenhold

**Updated**: 2024-12-13T14:08:55Z

**Summary**: Oblivious RAM (ORAM) is a well-researched primitive to hide the memory access pattern of a RAM computation; it has a variety of applications in trusted computing, outsourced storage, and multiparty computation. In this paper, we study the so-called offline ORAM in which the sequence of memory access locations to be hidden is known in advance. Apart from their theoretical significance, offline ORAMs can be used to construct efficient oblivious algorithms.   We obtain the first optimal offline ORAM with perfect security from oblivious priority queues via time-forward processing. For this, we present a simple construction of an oblivious priority queue with perfect security. Our construction achieves an asymptotically optimal (amortized) runtime of $\Theta(\log N)$ per operation for a capacity of $N$ elements and is of independent interest.   Building on our construction, we additionally present efficient external-memory instantiations of our oblivious, perfectly-secure construction: For the cache-aware setting, we match the optimal I/O complexity of $\Theta(\frac{1}{B} \log \frac{N}{M})$ per operation (amortized), and for the cache-oblivious setting we achieve a near-optimal I/O complexity of $O(\frac{1}{B} \log \frac{N}{M} \log\log_M N)$ per operation (amortized).

### Activation Sparsity Opportunities for Compressing General Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Nobel Dhar, Bobin Deng, Md Romyull Islam, Kazi Fahim Ahmad Nasif, Liang Zhao, Kun Suo

**Updated**: 2024-12-13T02:26:54Z

**Summary**: Deploying local AI models, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), to edge devices can substantially enhance devices' independent capabilities, alleviate the server's burden, and lower the response time. Owing to these tremendous potentials, many big tech companies have released several lightweight Small Language Models (SLMs) to bridge this gap. However, we still have huge motivations to deploy more powerful (LLMs) AI models on edge devices and enhance their smartness level. Unlike the conventional approaches for AI model compression, we investigate activation sparsity. The activation sparsity method is orthogonal and combinable with existing techniques to maximize compression rate while maintaining great accuracy. LLMs' Feed-Forward Network (FFN) components, which typically comprise a large proportion of parameters (around 3/2), ensure that our FFN optimizations would have a better chance of achieving effective compression. Moreover, our findings are beneficial to general LLMs and are not restricted to ReLU-based models. This work systematically investigates the tradeoff between enforcing activation sparsity and perplexity (accuracy) on state-of-the-art LLMs. Our empirical analysis demonstrates that we can obtain around 50% of main memory and computing reductions for critical FFN components with negligible accuracy degradation. This extra 50% sparsity does not naturally exist in the current LLMs, which require tuning LLMs' activation outputs by injecting zero-enforcing thresholds. To obtain the benefits of activation sparsity, we provide a guideline for the system architect for LLM prediction and prefetching. The success prediction allows the system to prefetch the necessary weights while omitting the inactive ones and their successors, therefore lowering cache and memory pollution and reducing LLM execution time on resource-constrained edge devices.

### Optimizing CDN Architectures: Multi-Metric Algorithmic Breakthroughs for   Edge and Distributed Performance
**Authors**: Md Nurul Absur, Sourya Saha, Sifat Nawrin Nova, Kazi Fahim Ahmad Nasif, Md Rahat Ul Nasib

**Updated**: 2024-12-12T17:20:26Z

**Summary**: A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a powerful system of distributed caching servers that aims to accelerate content delivery, like high-definition video, IoT applications, and ultra-low-latency services, efficiently and with fast velocity. This has become of paramount importance in the post-pandemic era. Challenges arise when exponential content volume growth and scalability across different geographic locations are required. This paper investigates data-driven evaluations of CDN algorithms in dynamic server selection for latency reduction, bandwidth throttling for efficient resource management, real-time Round Trip Time analysis for adaptive routing, and programmatic network delay simulation to emulate various conditions. Key performance metrics, such as round-trip time (RTT) and CPU usage, are carefully analyzed to evaluate scalability and algorithmic efficiency through two experimental setups: a constrained edge-like local system and a scalable FABRIC testbed. The statistical validation of RTT trends, alongside CPU utilization, is presented in the results. The optimization process reveals significant trade-offs between scalability and resource consumption, providing actionable insights for effectively deploying and enhancing CDN algorithms in edge and distributed computing environments.

### Unifying AI Tutor Evaluation: An Evaluation Taxonomy for Pedagogical   Ability Assessment of LLM-Powered AI Tutors
**Authors**: Kaushal Kumar Maurya, KV Aditya Srivatsa, Kseniia Petukhova, Ekaterina Kochmar

**Updated**: 2024-12-12T16:24:35Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we investigate whether current state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) are effective as AI tutors and whether they demonstrate pedagogical abilities necessary for good AI tutoring in educational dialogues. Previous efforts towards evaluation have been limited to subjective protocols and benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we propose a unified evaluation taxonomy with eight pedagogical dimensions based on key learning sciences principles, which is designed to assess the pedagogical value of LLM-powered AI tutor responses grounded in student mistakes or confusion in the mathematical domain. We release MRBench -- a new evaluation benchmark containing 192 conversations and 1,596 responses from seven state-of-the-art LLM-based and human tutors, providing gold annotations for eight pedagogical dimensions. We assess reliability of the popular Prometheus2 LLM as an evaluator and analyze each tutor's pedagogical abilities, highlighting which LLMs are good tutors and which ones are more suitable as question-answering systems. We believe that the presented taxonomy, benchmark, and human-annotated labels will streamline the evaluation process and help track the progress in AI tutors' development.

### ZipCache: A DRAM/SSD Cache with Built-in Transparent Compression
**Authors**: Rui Xie, Linsen Ma, Alex Zhong, Feng Chen, Tong Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-12-12T15:39:48Z

**Summary**: As a core component in modern data centers, key-value cache provides high-throughput and low-latency services for high-speed data processing. The effectiveness of a key-value cache relies on its ability of accommodating the needed data. However, expanding the cache capacity is often more difficult than commonly expected because of many practical constraints, such as server costs, cooling issues, rack space, and even human resource expenses. A potential solution is compression, which virtually extends the cache capacity by condensing data in cache. In practice, this seemingly simple idea has not gained much traction in key-value cache system design, due to several critical issues: the compression-unfriendly index structure, severe read/write amplification, wasteful decompression operations, and heavy computing cost. This paper presents a hybrid DRAM-SSD cache design to realize a systematic integration of data compression in key-value cache. By treating compression as an essential component, we have redesigned the indexing structure, data management, and leveraged the emerging computational SSD hardware for collaborative optimizations. We have developed a prototype, called ZipCache. Our experimental results show that ZipCache can achieve up to 72.4% higher throughput and 42.4% lower latency, while reducing the write amplification by up to 26.2 times.

### Unlocking FedNL: Self-Contained Compute-Optimized Implementation
**Authors**: Konstantin Burlachenko, Peter RichtÃ¡rik

**Updated**: 2024-12-12T14:43:48Z

**Summary**: Federated Learning (FL) is an emerging paradigm that enables intelligent agents to collaboratively train Machine Learning (ML) models in a distributed manner, eliminating the need for sharing their local data. The recent work (arXiv:2106.02969) introduces a family of Federated Newton Learn (FedNL) algorithms, marking a significant step towards applying second-order methods to FL and large-scale optimization. However, the reference FedNL prototype exhibits three serious practical drawbacks: (i) It requires 4.8 hours to launch a single experiment in a sever-grade workstation; (ii) The prototype only simulates multi-node setting; (iii) Prototype integration into resource-constrained applications is challenging. To bridge the gap between theory and practice, we present a self-contained implementation of FedNL, FedNL-LS, FedNL-PP for single-node and multi-node settings. Our work resolves the aforementioned issues and reduces the wall clock time by x1000. With this FedNL outperforms alternatives for training logistic regression in a single-node -- CVXPY (arXiv:1603.00943), and in a multi-node -- Apache Spark (arXiv:1505.06807), Ray/Scikit-Learn (arXiv:1712.05889). Finally, we propose two practical-orientated compressors for FedNL - adaptive TopLEK and cache-aware RandSeqK, which fulfill the theory of FedNL.

**Authors**: Zhenliang Xue, Yixin Song, Zeyu Mi, Xinrui Zheng, Yubin Xia, Haibo Chen

**Updated**: 2024-12-12T12:24:18Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) on smartphones enable real-time AI assistance and privacy-preserving, offline operation. However, resource constraints of smartphones limit current deployments to small language models (SLMs), significantly compromising their capabilities. This paper introduces PowerInfer-2, a smartphone-based framework that enables fast inference for LLMs exceeding the memory capacity. The key insight is decomposing matrix operations into neuron clusters as the basic processing unit, which enables flexible scheduling and efficient I/O-computation pipelining. PowerInfer-2 leverages this neuron-cluster-based design in both computation and storage. For computation, neuron clusters with dense activations are processed on NPU, while sparse clusters use CPU. The storage engine provides a fine-grained pipeline mechanism that coordinates cluster-level computation and I/O operations, enhanced by a segmented neuron cache to reduce I/O activities. PowerInfer-2 achieves up to a 27.8x speed increase compared to state-of-the-art frameworks. PowerInfer-2 is the first system to serve a 47B LLM on a smartphone, achieving 11.68 tokens/s. Notably, these performance improvements preserve model quality with negligible accuracy degradation.

### HEXA-MoE: Efficient and Heterogeneous-aware MoE Acceleration with ZERO   Computation Redundancy
**Authors**: Shuqing Luo, Jie Peng, Pingzhi Li, Tianlong Chen

**Updated**: 2024-12-12T12:03:19Z

**Summary**: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a practical approach to scale up parameters for the Transformer model to achieve better generalization while maintaining a sub-linear increase in computation overhead. Current MoE models are mainly built with expert parallelism on distributed devices. However, it usually depends on homogeneous devices to deploy and suffers from heavy communication overhead and computation redundancy. In this paper, we explore developing a \texttt{H}eterogeneous-aware \texttt{EX}pert \texttt{A}llocation framework, \textbf{\texttt{HEXA-MoE}}, with significantly enhanced computing efficiency. It contains two components: ($1$) \textit{Expert-Specific Operators}. We replace the typical general matrix multiplication or grouped matrix multiplication interfaces with our operators, which allows the computing to be performed in an in-place manner with \textbf{ZERO} redundancy. ($2$) \textit{Adaptive Data- and Model-Centric Configurations} for different workload scales. Specifically, we introduce a pipeline-shared cache on each device to tackle the heavy memory consumption in the existing data-centric MoE library. Comprehensive experiments on the Swin-MoE benchmark consistently reveal the effectiveness of our \texttt{HEXA-MoE} framework, i.e., reducing $10\%\sim48\%$ memory consumption and achieving $0.5\sim4.3\times$ speed up compared to current state-of-the-art MoE libraries. Furthermore, we examine our \texttt{HEXA-MoE} with heterogeneous devices for both data- and model-centric settings. Promising results show that employing optimal parallel configuration with \texttt{HEXA-MoE} on heterogeneous devices can substantially minimize overall latency. Codes are available at https://github.com/UNITES-Lab/HEXA-MoE.

**Authors**: A. B. Batrakov, S. Yu. Karelin, O. M. Lebedenko, V. S. Mukhin, I. N. Onishchenko, O. L. Rak, V. G. Sinitsin, M. V. Volovenko

**Updated**: 2024-12-12T10:07:17Z

**Summary**: Experimental data and results of numerical simulations are presented, concerning excitation of narrowband gigahertz-range wave trains in coaxial guiding structures that are partially filled with ferromagnetic material and may involve periodically arranged metal inserts. The experiments performed confirm the possibility of exciting weakly damped electromagnetic waves by feeding high voltage, unilateral electromagnetic pulses of short duration into the line. The coax line was of outer diameter 50.5 mm, filled with an isotropic dielectric (relative dielectric constant {\epsilon} = 2.25) and a set of ferrite rings with {\epsilon}=16 and saturated-state {\mu} about 4 to 5. With a peak voltage of the primary pulse close to 160 kV and a magnetizing field of 17.5 kA/m, the parameters of the waves excited reached magnitudes as: frequency 1.89 GHz to 2.1 GHz; bandwidth 16%; VHF power at the output about 20 MW.

### PhishIntel: Toward Practical Deployment of Reference-based Phishing   Detection
**Authors**: Yuexin Li, Hiok Kuek Tan, Qiaoran Meng, Mei Lin Lock, Tri Cao, Shumin Deng, Nay Oo, Hoon Wei Lim, Bryan Hooi

**Updated**: 2024-12-12T08:33:39Z

**Summary**: Phishing is a critical cyber threat, exploiting deceptive tactics to compromise victims and cause significant financial losses. While reference-based phishing detectors (RBPDs) achieve high precision by analyzing brand-domain consistency, their real-world deployment is hindered by challenges such as high latency and inefficiency in URL analysis. To address these limitations, we present PhishIntel, an end-to-end phishing detection system for real-world deployment. PhishIntel intelligently determines whether a URL can be processed immediately or not, segmenting the detection process into two distinct tasks: a fast task that checks against local blacklists and result cache, and a slow task that conducts online blacklist verification, URL crawling, and webpage analysis using an RBPD. This fast-slow task system architecture ensures low response latency while retaining the robust detection capabilities of RBPDs for zero-day phishing threats. Furthermore, we develop two downstream applications based on PhishIntel: a phishing intelligence platform and a phishing email detection plugin for Microsoft Outlook, demonstrating its practical efficacy and utility.

### ZigZagkv: Dynamic KV Cache Compression for Long-context Modeling based   on Layer Uncertainty
**Authors**: Meizhi Zhong, Xikai Liu, Chen Zhang, Yikun Lei, Yan Gao, Yao Hu, Kehai Chen, Min Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-12-12T07:52:56Z

**Summary**: Large Language models (LLMs) have become a research hotspot. To accelerate the inference of LLMs, storing computed caches in memory has become the standard technique. However, as the inference length increases, growing KV caches might lead to out-of-memory issues. Many existing methods address this issue through KV cache compression, primarily by preserving key tokens throughout all layers to reduce information loss. Most of them allocate a uniform budget size for each layer to retain. However, we observe that the minimum budget sizes needed to retain essential information vary across layers and models based on the perspectives of attention and hidden state output. Building on this observation, this paper proposes a simple yet effective KV cache compression method that leverages layer uncertainty to allocate budget size for each layer. Experimental results show that the proposed method can reduce memory usage of the KV caches to only $\sim$20\% when compared to Full KV inference while achieving nearly lossless performance.

### Forecasting GPU Performance for Deep Learning Training and Inference
**Authors**: Seonho Lee, Amar Phanishayee, Divya Mahajan

**Updated**: 2024-12-12T03:21:13Z

**Summary**: Deep learning kernels exhibit predictable memory accesses and compute patterns, making GPUs' parallel architecture well-suited for their execution. Software and runtime systems for GPUs are optimized to better utilize the stream multiprocessors, on-chip cache, and off-chip high-bandwidth memory. As deep learning models and GPUs evolve, access to newer GPUs is often limited, raising questions about the performance of new model architectures on existing GPUs, existing models on new GPUs, and new model architectures on new GPUs. To address these questions, we introduce NeuSight, a framework to predict the performance of various deep learning models, for both training and inference, on unseen GPUs without requiring actual execution. The framework leverages both GPU hardware behavior and software library optimizations to estimate end-to-end performance. Previous work uses regression models that capture linear trends or multilayer perceptrons to predict the overall latency of deep learning kernels on GPUs. These approaches suffer from higher error percentages when forecasting performance on unseen models and new GPUs. Instead, NeuSight decomposes the prediction problem into smaller problems, bounding the prediction through fundamental performance laws. NeuSight decomposes a single deep learning kernel prediction into smaller working sets called tiles, which are executed independently on the GPU. Tile-granularity predictions are determined using a machine learning approach and aggregated to estimate end-to-end latency. NeuSight outperforms prior work across various deep learning workloads and the latest GPUs. It reduces the percentage error from 121.4% and 30.8% to 2.3% in predicting the latency of GPT3 model for training and inference on H100, compared to state-of-the-art prior work, where both GPT3 and H100 were not used to train the framework.

### Lexico: Extreme KV Cache Compression via Sparse Coding over Universal   Dictionaries
**Authors**: Junhyuck Kim, Jongho Park, Jaewoong Cho, Dimitris Papailiopoulos

**Updated**: 2024-12-12T03:00:29Z

**Summary**: We introduce Lexico, a novel KV cache compression method that leverages sparse coding with a universal dictionary. Our key finding is that key-value cache in modern LLMs can be accurately approximated using sparse linear combination from a small, input-agnostic dictionary of ~4k atoms, enabling efficient compression across different input prompts, tasks and models. Using orthogonal matching pursuit for sparse approximation, Lexico achieves flexible compression ratios through direct sparsity control. On GSM8K, across multiple model families (Mistral, Llama 3, Qwen2.5), Lexico maintains 90-95% of the original performance while using only 15-25% of the full KV-cache memory, outperforming both quantization and token eviction methods. Notably, Lexico remains effective in low memory regimes where 2-bit quantization fails, achieving up to 1.7x better compression on LongBench and GSM8K while maintaining high accuracy.

### EMS: Adaptive Evict-then-Merge Strategy for Head-wise KV Cache   Compression Based on Global-Local Importance
**Authors**: Yingxin Li, Ye Li, Yuan Meng, Xinzhu Ma, Zihan Geng, Shutao Xia, Zhi Wang

**Updated**: 2024-12-11T16:35:13Z

**Summary**: As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, the demand for higher quality and faster processing of long contexts across various applications is growing. KV cache is widely adopted as it stores previously generated key and value tokens, effectively reducing redundant computations during inference. However, as memory overhead becomes a significant concern, efficient compression of KV cache has gained increasing attention. Most existing methods perform compression from two perspectives: identifying important tokens and designing compression strategies. However, these approaches often produce biased distributions of important tokens due to the influence of accumulated attention scores or positional encoding. Furthermore, they overlook the sparsity and redundancy across different heads, which leads to difficulties in preserving the most effective information at the head level. To this end, we propose EMS to overcome these limitations, while achieving better KV cache compression under extreme compression ratios. Specifically, we introduce a Global-Local score that combines accumulated attention scores from both global and local KV tokens to better identify the token importance. For the compression strategy, we design an adaptive and unified Evict-then-Merge framework that accounts for the sparsity and redundancy of KV tokens across different heads. Additionally, we implement the head-wise parallel compression through a zero-class mechanism to enhance efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate our SOTA performance even under extreme compression ratios. EMS consistently achieves the lowest perplexity, improves scores by over 1.28 points across four LLMs on LongBench under a 256 cache budget, and preserves 95% retrieval accuracy with a cache budget less than 2% of the context length in the Needle-in-a-Haystack task.

### Pushing the Limits of In-Network Caching for Key-Value Stores
**Authors**: Gyuyeong Kim

**Updated**: 2024-12-11T12:03:40Z

**Summary**: We present OrbitCache, a new in-network caching architecture that can cache variable-length items to balance a wide range of key-value workloads. Unlike existing works, OrbitCache does not cache hot items in the switch memory. Instead, we make hot items revisit the switch data plane continuously by exploiting packet recirculation. Our approach keeps cached key-value pairs in the switch data plane while freeing them from item size limitations caused by hardware constraints. We implement an OrbitCache prototype on an Intel Tofino switch. Our experimental results show that OrbitCache can balance highly skewed workloads and is robust to various system conditions.

### TextRefiner: Internal Visual Feature as Efficient Refiner for   Vision-Language Models Prompt Tuning
**Authors**: Jingjing Xie, Yuxin Zhang, Jun Peng, Zhaohong Huang, Liujuan Cao

**Updated**: 2024-12-11T08:07:12Z

**Summary**: Despite the efficiency of prompt learning in transferring vision-language models (VLMs) to downstream tasks, existing methods mainly learn the prompts in a coarse-grained manner where the learned prompt vectors are shared across all categories. Consequently, the tailored prompts often fail to discern class-specific visual concepts, thereby hindering the transferred performance for classes that share similar or complex visual attributes. Recent advances mitigate this challenge by leveraging external knowledge from Large Language Models (LLMs) to furnish class descriptions, yet incurring notable inference costs. In this paper, we introduce TextRefiner, a plug-and-play method to refine the text prompts of existing methods by leveraging the internal knowledge of VLMs. Particularly, TextRefiner builds a novel local cache module to encapsulate fine-grained visual concepts derivedfrom local tokens within the image branch. By aggregating and aligning the cached visual descriptions with the original output of the text branch, TextRefiner can efficiently refine and enrich the learned prompts from existing methods without relying on any external expertise. For example, it improves the performance of CoOp from 71.66 % to 76.94 % on 11 benchmarks, surpassing CoCoOp which introduces instance-wise features for text prompts. Equipped with TextRefiner, PromptKD achieves state-of-the-art performance and is efficient in inference. Our code is relesed at https://github.com/xjjxmu/TextRefiner

### ContextModule: Improving Code Completion via Repository-level Contextual   Information
**Authors**: Zhanming Guan, Junlin Liu, Jierui Liu, Chao Peng, Dexin Liu, Ningyuan Sun, Bo Jiang, Wenchao Li, Jie Liu, Hang Zhu

**Updated**: 2024-12-11T03:15:49Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in code completion tasks, where they assist developers by predicting and generating new code in real-time. However, existing LLM-based code completion systems primarily rely on the immediate context of the file being edited, often missing valuable repository-level information, user behaviour and edit history that could improve suggestion accuracy. Additionally, challenges such as efficiently retrieving relevant code snippets from large repositories, incorporating user behavior, and balancing accuracy with low-latency requirements in production environments remain unresolved. In this paper, we propose ContextModule, a framework designed to enhance LLM-based code completion by retrieving and integrating three types of contextual information from the repository: user behavior-based code, similar code snippets, and critical symbol definitions. By capturing user interactions across files and leveraging repository-wide static analysis, ContextModule improves the relevance and precision of generated code. We implement performance optimizations, such as index caching, to ensure the system meets the latency constraints of real-world coding environments. Experimental results and industrial practise demonstrate that ContextModule significantly improves code completion accuracy and user acceptance rates.

### Just Shift It: Test-Time Prototype Shifting for Zero-Shot Generalization   with Vision-Language Models
**Authors**: Elaine Sui, Xiaohan Wang, Serena Yeung-Levy

**Updated**: 2024-12-10T22:53:16Z

**Summary**: Advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have propelled the field of computer vision, particularly in the zero-shot learning setting. Despite their promise, the effectiveness of these models often diminishes due to domain shifts in test environments. To address this, we introduce the Test-Time Prototype Shifting (TPS) framework, a pioneering approach designed to adapt VLMs to test datasets using unlabeled test inputs. Our method is based on the notion of modulating per-class prototypes in the shared embedding space. By pre-computing and caching prototypes generated with the pre-trained text encoder, TPS not only facilitates optimization-free prototype reuse for subsequent predictions but also enables seamless integration with current advancements in prompt engineering. At test-time, TPS dynamically learns shift vectors for each prototype based solely on the given test sample, effectively bridging the domain gap and enhancing classification accuracy. A notable aspect of our framework is its significantly reduced memory and computational demands when compared to conventional text-prompt tuning methods. Extensive evaluations across 15 image classification datasets involving natural distribution shifts and cross-dataset generalization, as well as in context-dependent visual reasoning, demonstrate TPS's superior performance, achieving state-of-the-art results while reducing resource requirements.

### From Slow Bidirectional to Fast Causal Video Generators
**Authors**: Tianwei Yin, Qiang Zhang, Richard Zhang, William T. Freeman, Fredo Durand, Eli Shechtman, Xun Huang

**Updated**: 2024-12-10T18:59:50Z

**Summary**: Current video diffusion models achieve impressive generation quality but struggle in interactive applications due to bidirectional attention dependencies. The generation of a single frame requires the model to process the entire sequence, including the future. We address this limitation by adapting a pretrained bidirectional diffusion transformer to a causal transformer that generates frames on-the-fly. To further reduce latency, we extend distribution matching distillation (DMD) to videos, distilling 50-step diffusion model into a 4-step generator. To enable stable and high-quality distillation, we introduce a student initialization scheme based on teacher's ODE trajectories, as well as an asymmetric distillation strategy that supervises a causal student model with a bidirectional teacher. This approach effectively mitigates error accumulation in autoregressive generation, allowing long-duration video synthesis despite training on short clips. Our model supports fast streaming generation of high quality videos at 9.4 FPS on a single GPU thanks to KV caching. Our approach also enables streaming video-to-video translation, image-to-video, and dynamic prompting in a zero-shot manner. We will release the code based on an open-source model in the future.

### FlashRNN: Optimizing Traditional RNNs on Modern Hardware
**Authors**: Korbinian PÃ¶ppel, Maximilian Beck, Sepp Hochreiter

**Updated**: 2024-12-10T18:50:37Z

**Summary**: While Transformers and other sequence-parallelizable neural network architectures seem like the current state of the art in sequence modeling, they specifically lack state-tracking capabilities. These are important for time-series tasks and logical reasoning. Traditional RNNs like LSTMs and GRUs, as well as modern variants like sLSTM do have these capabilities at the cost of strictly sequential processing. While this is often seen as a strong limitation, we show how fast these networks can get with our hardware-optimization FlashRNN in Triton and CUDA, optimizing kernels to the register level on modern GPUs. We extend traditional RNNs with a parallelization variant that processes multiple RNNs of smaller hidden state in parallel, similar to the head-wise processing in Transformers. To enable flexibility on different GPU variants, we introduce a new optimization framework for hardware-internal cache sizes, memory and compute handling. It models the hardware in a setting using polyhedral-like constraints, including the notion of divisibility. This speeds up the solution process in our ConstrINT library for general integer constraint satisfaction problems (integer CSPs). We show that our kernels can achieve 50x speed-ups over a vanilla PyTorch implementation and allow 40x larger hidden sizes compared to our Triton implementation. Our open-source kernels and the optimization library are released here to boost research in the direction of state-tracking enabled RNNs and sequence modeling: \url{https://github.com/NX-AI/flashrnn}

### ACDiT: Interpolating Autoregressive Conditional Modeling and Diffusion   Transformer
**Authors**: Jinyi Hu, Shengding Hu, Yuxuan Song, Yufei Huang, Mingxuan Wang, Hao Zhou, Zhiyuan Liu, Wei-Ying Ma, Maosong Sun

**Updated**: 2024-12-10T18:13:20Z

**Summary**: The recent surge of interest in comprehensive multimodal models has necessitated the unification of diverse modalities. However, the unification suffers from disparate methodologies. Continuous visual generation necessitates the full-sequence diffusion-based approach, despite its divergence from the autoregressive modeling in the text domain. We posit that autoregressive modeling, i.e., predicting the future based on past deterministic experience, remains crucial in developing both a visual generation model and a potential unified multimodal model. In this paper, we explore an interpolation between the autoregressive modeling and full-parameters diffusion to model visual information. At its core, we present ACDiT, an Autoregressive blockwise Conditional Diffusion Transformer, where the block size of diffusion, i.e., the size of autoregressive units, can be flexibly adjusted to interpolate between token-wise autoregression and full-sequence diffusion. ACDiT is easy to implement, as simple as creating a Skip-Causal Attention Mask (SCAM) during training. During inference, the process iterates between diffusion denoising and autoregressive decoding that can make full use of KV-Cache. We verify the effectiveness of ACDiT on image and video generation tasks. We also demonstrate that benefitted from autoregressive modeling, ACDiT can be seamlessly used in visual understanding tasks despite being trained on the diffusion objective. The analysis of the trade-off between autoregressive modeling and diffusion demonstrates the potential of ACDiT to be used in long-horizon visual generation tasks. These strengths make it promising as the backbone of future unified models.

### Video-XL: Extra-Long Vision Language Model for Hour-Scale Video   Understanding
**Authors**: Yan Shu, Zheng Liu, Peitian Zhang, Minghao Qin, Junjie Zhou, Zhengyang Liang, Tiejun Huang, Bo Zhao

**Updated**: 2024-12-10T12:45:31Z

**Summary**: Long video understanding poses a significant challenge for current Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Notably, the MLLMs are constrained by their limited context lengths and the substantial costs while processing long videos. Although several existing methods attempt to reduce visual tokens, their strategies encounter severe bottleneck, restricting MLLMs' ability to perceive fine-grained visual details. In this work, we propose Video-XL, a novel approach that leverages MLLMs' inherent key-value (KV) sparsification capacity to condense the visual input. Specifically, we introduce a new special token, the Visual Summarization Token (VST), for each interval of the video, which summarizes the visual information within the interval as its associated KV. The VST module is trained by instruction fine-tuning, where two optimizing strategies are offered. 1.Curriculum learning, where VST learns to make small (easy) and large compression (hard) progressively. 2. Composite data curation, which integrates single-image, multi-image, and synthetic data to overcome the scarcity of long-video instruction data. The compression quality is further improved by dynamic compression, which customizes compression granularity based on the information density of different video intervals. Video-XL's effectiveness is verified from three aspects. First, it achieves a superior long-video understanding capability, outperforming state-of-the-art models of comparable sizes across multiple popular benchmarks. Second, it effectively preserves video information, with minimal compression loss even at 16x compression ratio. Third, it realizes outstanding cost-effectiveness, enabling high-quality processing of thousands of frames on a single A100 GPU.

### GPT Semantic Cache: Reducing LLM Costs and Latency via Semantic   Embedding Caching
**Authors**: Sajal Regmi, Chetan Phakami Pun

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T01:44:10Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT, have revolutionized artificial intelligence by enabling nuanced understanding and generation of human-like text across a wide range of applications. However, the high computational and financial costs associated with frequent API calls to these models present a substantial bottleneck, especially for applications like customer service chatbots that handle repetitive queries. In this paper, we introduce GPT Semantic Cache, a method that leverages semantic caching of query embeddings in in-memory storage (Redis). By storing embeddings of user queries, our approach efficiently identifies semantically similar questions, allowing for the retrieval of pre-generated responses without redundant API calls to the LLM. This technique achieves a notable reduction in operational costs while significantly enhancing response times, making it a robust solution for optimizing LLM-powered applications. Our experiments demonstrate that GPT Semantic Cache reduces API calls by up to 68.8% across various query categories, with cache hit rates ranging from 61.6% to 68.8%. Additionally, the system achieves high accuracy, with positive hit rates exceeding 97%, confirming the reliability of cached responses. This technique not only reduces operational costs, but also improves response times, enhancing the efficiency of LLM-powered applications.

### A Survey on Privacy-Preserving Caching at Network Edge: Classification,   Solutions, and Challenges
**Authors**: Xianzhi Zhang, Yipeng Zhou, Di Wu, Quan Z. Sheng, Shazia Riaz, Miao Hu, Linchang Xiao

**Updated**: 2024-12-09T01:39:15Z

**Summary**: Caching content at the edge network is a popular and effective technique widely deployed to alleviate the burden of network backhaul, shorten service delay and improve service quality. However, there has been some controversy over privacy violations in caching content at the edge network. On the one hand, the multi-access open edge network provides an ideal entrance or interface for external attackers to obtain private data from edge caches by extracting sensitive information. On the other hand, privacy can be infringed on by curious edge caching providers through caching trace analysis targeting the achievement of better caching performance or higher profits. Therefore, an in-depth understanding of privacy issues in edge caching networks is vital and indispensable for creating a privacy-preserving caching service at the edge network. In this article, we are among the first to fill this gap by examining privacy-preserving techniques for caching content at the edge network. Firstly, we provide an introduction to the background of privacy-preserving edge caching (PPEC). Next, we summarize the key privacy issues and present a taxonomy for caching at the edge network from the perspective of private information. Additionally, we conduct a retrospective review of the state-of-the-art countermeasures against privacy leakage from content caching at the edge network. Finally, we conclude the survey and envision challenges for future research.

### XKV: Personalized KV Cache Memory Reduction for Long-Context LLM   Inference
**Authors**: Weizhuo Li, Zhigang Wang, Yu Gu, Ge Yu

**Updated**: 2024-12-08T11:32:08Z

**Summary**: Recently the generative Large Language Model (LLM) has achieved remarkable success in numerous applications. Notably its inference generates output tokens one-by-one, leading to many redundant computations. The widely-used KV-Cache framework makes a compromise between time and space complexities. However, caching data generates the increasingly growing memory demand, that can quickly exhaust the limited memory capacity of the modern accelerator like GPUs, particularly in long-context inference tasks. Existing studies reduce memory consumption by evicting some of cached data that have less important impact on inference accuracy. But the benefit in practice is far from ideal due to the static cache allocation across different LLM network layers. This paper observes that the layer-specific cached data have very different impacts on accuracy. We quantify this difference, and give experimental and theoretical validation. We accordingly make a formal analysis and shows that customizing the cache size for each layer in a personalized manner can yield a significant memory reduction, while still providing comparable accuracy. We simulate the cache allocation as a combinatorial optimization problem and give a global optimal solution. In particular, we devise a mini- and sampling-based inference over a lightweight variant of the LLM model, so as to quickly capture the difference and then feed it into the personalized algorithms. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposals can reduce KV cache memory consumption by 61.6% on average, improve computational efficiency by 2.1x and then increase the throughput by up to 5.5x.

 ### Distributed Mixture-of-Agents for Edge Inference with Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Purbesh Mitra, Priyanka Kaswan, Sennur Ulukus

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T18:59:06Z

**Summary**: Mixture-of-Agents (MoA) has recently been proposed as a method to enhance performance of large language models (LLMs), enabling multiple individual LLMs to work together for collaborative inference. This collaborative approach results in improved responses to user prompts compared to relying on a single LLM. In this paper, we consider such an MoA architecture in a distributed setting, where LLMs operate on individual edge devices, each uniquely associated with a user and equipped with its own distributed computing power. These devices exchange information using decentralized gossip algorithms, allowing different device nodes to talk without the supervision of a centralized server. In the considered setup, different users have their own LLM models to address user prompts. Additionally, the devices gossip either their own user-specific prompts or augmented prompts to generate more refined answers to certain queries. User prompts are temporarily stored in the device queues when their corresponding LLMs are busy. Given the memory limitations of edge devices, it is crucial to ensure that the average queue sizes in the system remain bounded. In this paper, we address this by theoretically calculating the queuing stability conditions for the device queues under reasonable assumptions, which we validate experimentally as well. Further, we demonstrate through experiments, leveraging open-source LLMs for the implementation of distributed MoA, that certain MoA configurations produce higher-quality responses compared to others, as evaluated on AlpacaEval 2.0 benchmark. The implementation is available at: https://github.com/purbeshmitra/distributed_moa.

### HumanEval Pro and MBPP Pro: Evaluating Large Language Models on   Self-invoking Code Generation
**Authors**: Zhaojian Yu, Yilun Zhao, Arman Cohan, Xiao-Ping Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T18:58:58Z

**Summary**: We introduce self-invoking code generation, a new task designed to evaluate the progressive reasoning and problem-solving capabilities of LLMs. In this task, models are presented with a base problem and a related, more complex problem. They must solve the base problem and then utilize its solution to address the more complex one. This work features three key contributions. First, we propose a general recipe for generating more challenging versions of existing benchmarks, resulting in three new benchmarks: HumanEval Pro, MBPP Pro, and BigCodeBench-Lite Pro, specifically designed to assess LLMs on self-invoking code generation. Second, from the analysis of experimental results over twenty LLMs on our benchmarks, we have two important observations: (i) Most LLMs excel in traditional code generation benchmarks like HumanEval and MBPP, but their performance declines on self-invoking tasks. For example, o1-mini achieves 96.2% pass@1 on HumanEval but only 76.2% on HumanEval Pro. (ii) On self-invoking code generation task, the instruction-tuned models demonstrate only marginal improvements compared to the base models. Third, we disclose the types of failure modes that exist in our evaluation results. All these results underscore the need for further advancements in self-invoking code generation tasks and provide a new direction for future research on enhancing LLMs' code reasoning capabilities.

**Authors**: Xingyu Chen, Jiahao Xu, Tian Liang, Zhiwei He, Jianhui Pang, Dian Yu, Linfeng Song, Qiuzhi Liu, Mengfei Zhou, Zhuosheng Zhang, Rui Wang, Zhaopeng Tu, Haitao Mi, Dong Yu

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T18:55:12Z

**Summary**: The remarkable performance of models like the OpenAI o1 can be attributed to their ability to emulate human-like long-time thinking during inference. These models employ extended chain-of-thought (CoT) processes, exploring multiple strategies to enhance problem-solving capabilities. However, a critical question remains: How to intelligently and efficiently scale computational resources during testing. This paper presents the first comprehensive study on the prevalent issue of overthinking in these models, where excessive computational resources are allocated for simple problems with minimal benefit. We introduce novel efficiency metrics from both outcome and process perspectives to evaluate the rational use of computational resources by o1-like models. Using a self-training paradigm, we propose strategies to mitigate overthinking, streamlining reasoning processes without compromising accuracy. Experimental results show that our approach successfully reduces computational overhead while preserving model performance across a range of testsets with varying difficulty levels, such as GSM8K, MATH500, GPQA, and AIME.

**Summary**: Solving complex real-world tasks requires cycles of actions and observations. This is particularly true in science, where tasks require many cycles of analysis, tool use, and experimentation. Language agents are promising for automating intellectual tasks in science because they can interact with tools via natural language or code. Yet their flexibility creates conceptual and practical challenges for software implementations, since agents may comprise non-standard components such as internal reasoning, planning, tool usage, as well as the inherent stochasticity of temperature-sampled language models. Here, we introduce Aviary, an extensible gymnasium for language agents. We formalize agents as policies solving language-grounded partially observable Markov decision processes, which we term language decision processes. We then implement five environments, including three challenging scientific environments: (1) manipulating DNA constructs for molecular cloning, (2) answering research questions by accessing scientific literature, and (3) engineering protein stability. These environments were selected for their focus on multi-step reasoning and their relevance to contemporary biology research. Finally, with online training and scaling inference-time compute, we show that language agents backed by open-source, non-frontier LLMs can match and exceed both frontier LLM agents and human experts on multiple tasks at up to 100x lower inference cost.

### Using AI for Efficient Statistical Inference of Lattice Correlators   Across Mass Parameters
**Authors**: Octavio Vega, Andrew Lytle, Jiayu Shen, Aida X. El-Khadra

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T18:26:46Z

**Summary**: Lattice QCD is notorious for its computational expense. Modern lattice simulations require large-scale computational resources to handle the large number of Dirac operator inversions used to construct correlation functions. Machine learning (ML) techniques that can increase, at the analysis level, the information inferred from the correlation functions would therefore be beneficial. We apply supervised learning to infer two-point lattice correlation functions at different target masses. Our work proposes a new method for separating data into training and bias correction subsets for efficient uncertainty estimation. We also benchmark our ML models against a simple ratio method.

### Order Matters in Hallucination: Reasoning Order as Benchmark and   Reflexive Prompting for Large-Language-Models
**Authors**: Zikai Xie

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T18:21:08Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have generated significant attention since their inception, finding applications across various academic and industrial domains. However, these models often suffer from the "hallucination problem", where outputs, though grammatically and logically coherent, lack factual accuracy or are entirely fabricated. A particularly troubling issue discovered and widely discussed recently is the numerical comparison error where multiple LLMs incorrectly infer that "9.11$>$9.9". We discovered that the order in which LLMs generate answers and reasoning impacts their consistency. Specifically, results vary significantly when an LLM generates an answer first and then provides the reasoning versus generating the reasoning process first and then the conclusion. Inspired by this, we propose a new benchmark method for assessing LLM consistency: comparing responses generated through these two different approaches. This benchmark effectively identifies instances where LLMs fabricate answers and subsequently generate justifications. Furthermore, we introduce a novel and straightforward prompt strategy designed to mitigate this issue. Experimental results demonstrate that this strategy improves performance across various LLMs compared to direct questioning. This work not only sheds light on a critical flaw in LLMs but also offers a practical solution to enhance their reliability.

### Facilitating large language model Russian adaptation with Learned   Embedding Propagation
**Authors**: Mikhail Tikhomirov, Daniil Chernyshev

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T18:15:45Z

**Summary**: Rapid advancements of large language model (LLM) technologies led to the introduction of powerful open-source instruction-tuned LLMs that have the same text generation quality as the state-of-the-art counterparts such as GPT-4. While the emergence of such models accelerates the adoption of LLM technologies in sensitive-information environments the authors of such models don not disclose the training data necessary for replication of the results thus making the achievements model-exclusive. Since those open-source models are also multilingual this in turn reduces the benefits of training a language specific LLMs as improved inference computation efficiency becomes the only guaranteed advantage of such costly procedure. More cost-efficient options such as vocabulary extension and subsequent continued pre-training are also inhibited by the lack of access to high-quality instruction-tuning data since it is the major factor behind the resulting LLM task-solving capabilities. To address the limitations and cut the costs of the language adaptation pipeline we propose Learned Embedding Propagation (LEP). Unlike existing approaches our method has lower training data size requirements due to minimal impact on existing LLM knowledge which we reinforce using novel ad-hoc embedding propagation procedure that allows to skip the instruction-tuning step and instead implant the new language knowledge directly into any existing instruct-tuned variant. We evaluated four Russian vocabulary adaptations for LLaMa-3-8B and Mistral-7B, showing that LEP is competitive with traditional instruction-tuning methods, achieving performance comparable to OpenChat 3.5 and LLaMa-3-8B-Instruct, with further improvements via self-calibration and continued tuning enhancing task-solving capabilities.

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T18:15:39Z

**Summary**: We present SWE-Gym, the first environment for training real-world software engineering (SWE) agents. SWE-Gym contains 2,438 real-world Python task instances, each comprising a codebase with an executable runtime environment, unit tests, and a task specified in natural language. We use SWE-Gym to train language model based SWE agents , achieving up to 19% absolute gains in resolve rate on the popular SWE-Bench Verified and Lite test sets. We also experiment with inference-time scaling through verifiers trained on agent trajectories sampled from SWE-Gym. When combined with our fine-tuned SWE agents, we achieve 32.0% and 26.0% on SWE-Bench Verified and Lite, respectively, reflecting a new state-of-the-art for open-weight SWE agents. To facilitate further research, we publicly release SWE-Gym, models, and agent trajectories.

### ExpShield: Safeguarding Web Text from Unauthorized Crawling and Language   Modeling Exploitation
**Authors**: Ruixuan Liu, Toan Tran, Tianhao Wang, Hongsheng Hu, Shuo Wang, Li Xiong

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T17:52:02Z

**Summary**: As large language models (LLMs) increasingly depend on web-scraped datasets, concerns over unauthorized use of copyrighted or personal content for training have intensified. Despite regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), data owners still have limited control over the use of their content in model training. To address this, we propose ExpShield, a proactive self-guard mechanism that empowers content owners to embed invisible perturbations into their text, limiting data misuse in LLMs training without affecting readability. This preemptive approach enables data owners to protect sensitive content directly, without relying on a third-party to perform defense. Starting from the random perturbation, we demonstrate the rationale for using perturbation to conceal protected content. We further enhance the efficiency by identifying memorization triggers and creating pitfalls to diverge the model memorization in a more focused way. To validate our defense's effectiveness, we propose a novel metric of instance exploitation which captures the individual risk raised by model training. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach as the MIA AUC decreases from 0.95 to 0.55, and instance exploitation approaches zero. This suggests that the individual risk does not increase after training, underscoring the significance of proactive defenses in protecting copyrighted data.

### Exploring and Controlling Diversity in LLM-Agent Conversation
**Authors**: KuanChao Chu, Yi-Pei Chen, Hideki Nakayama

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T17:25:58Z

**Summary**: Diversity is a critical aspect of multi-agent communication. In this paper, we focus on controlling and exploring diversity in the context of open-domain multi-agent conversations, particularly for world simulation applications. We propose Adaptive Prompt Pruning (APP), a novel method that dynamically adjusts the content of the utterance generation prompt to control diversity using a single parameter, lambda. Through extensive experiments, we show that APP effectively controls the output diversity across models and datasets, with pruning more information leading to more diverse output. We comprehensively analyze the relationship between prompt content and conversational diversity. Our findings reveal that information from all components of the prompt generally constrains the diversity of the output, with the Memory block exerting the most significant influence. APP is compatible with established techniques like temperature sampling and top-p sampling, providing a versatile tool for diversity management. To address the trade-offs of increased diversity, such as inconsistencies with omitted information, we incorporate a post-generation correction step, which effectively balances diversity enhancement with output consistency. Additionally, we examine how prompt structure, including component order and length, impacts diversity. This study addresses key questions surrounding diversity in multi-agent world simulation, offering insights into its control, influencing factors, and associated trade-offs. Our contributions lay the foundation for systematically engineering diversity in LLM-based multi-agent collaborations, advancing their effectiveness in real-world applications.

**Authors**: Qingyan Bai, Hao Ouyang, Yinghao Xu, Qiuyu Wang, Ceyuan Yang, Ka Leong Cheng, Yujun Shen, Qifeng Chen

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T16:56:44Z

**Summary**: As a verified need, consistent editing across in-the-wild images remains a technical challenge arising from various unmanageable factors, like object poses, lighting conditions, and photography environments. Edicho steps in with a training-free solution based on diffusion models, featuring a fundamental design principle of using explicit image correspondence to direct editing. Specifically, the key components include an attention manipulation module and a carefully refined classifier-free guidance (CFG) denoising strategy, both of which take into account the pre-estimated correspondence. Such an inference-time algorithm enjoys a plug-and-play nature and is compatible to most diffusion-based editing methods, such as ControlNet and BrushNet. Extensive results demonstrate the efficacy of Edicho in consistent cross-image editing under diverse settings. We will release the code to facilitate future studies.

### LLM Distillation for Efficient Few-Shot Multiple Choice Question   Answering
**Authors**: Patrick Sutanto, Joan Santoso, Esther Irawati Setiawan, Aji Prasetya Wibawa

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T16:45:50Z

**Summary**: Multiple Choice Question Answering (MCQA) is an important problem with numerous real-world applications, such as medicine, law, and education. The high cost of building MCQA datasets makes few-shot learning pivotal in this domain. While Large Language Models (LLMs) can enable few-shot learning, their direct application in real-world scenarios is often hindered by their high computational cost. To address this challenge, we propose a simple yet effective approach that uses LLMs for data generation and scoring. Our approach utilizes LLMs to create MCQA data which contains questions and choices, and to assign probability scores to the generated choices. We then use the generated data and LLM-assigned scores to finetune a smaller and more efficient encoder-only model, DeBERTa-v3-base by leveraging distillation loss. Extensive experiments on the Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) benchmark demonstrate that our method improves accuracy from 28.9% to 39.3%, representing a gain of over 10% compared to a baseline finetuned directly on 5-shot examples. This shows the effectiveness of LLM-driven data generation and knowledge distillation for few-shot MCQA.

### Privacy-Aware Multi-Device Cooperative Edge Inference with Distributed   Resource Bidding
**Authors**: Wenhao Zhuang, Yuyi Mao

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T16:37:17Z

**Summary**: Mobile edge computing (MEC) has empowered mobile devices (MDs) in supporting artificial intelligence (AI) applications through collaborative efforts with proximal MEC servers. Unfortunately, despite the great promise of device-edge cooperative AI inference, data privacy becomes an increasing concern. In this paper, we develop a privacy-aware multi-device cooperative edge inference system for classification tasks, which integrates a distributed bidding mechanism for the MEC server's computational resources. Intermediate feature compression is adopted as a principled approach to minimize data privacy leakage. To determine the bidding values and feature compression ratios in a distributed fashion, we formulate a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (DEC-POMDP) model, for which, a multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG)-based algorithm is developed. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in privacy-preserving cooperative edge inference. Specifically, given a sufficient level of data privacy protection, the proposed algorithm achieves 0.31-0.95% improvements in classification accuracy compared to the approach being agnostic to the wireless channel conditions. The performance is further enhanced by 1.54-1.67% by considering the difficulties of inference data.

### Efficient Multi-Task Inferencing with a Shared Backbone and Lightweight   Task-Specific Adapters for Automatic Scoring
**Authors**: Ehsan Latif, Xiaoming Zhai

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T16:34:11Z

**Summary**: The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in education requires scalable and efficient frameworks that balance performance, adaptability, and cost. This paper addresses these needs by proposing a shared backbone model architecture enhanced with lightweight LoRA adapters for task-specific fine-tuning, targeting the automated scoring of student responses across 27 mutually exclusive tasks. By achieving competitive performance (average QWK of 0.848 compared to 0.888 for fully fine-tuned models) while reducing GPU memory consumption by 60% and inference latency by 40%, the framework demonstrates significant efficiency gains. This approach aligns with the workshops' focus on improving language models for educational tasks, creating responsible innovations for cost-sensitive deployment, and supporting educators by streamlining assessment workflows. The findings underscore the potential of scalable AI to enhance learning outcomes while maintaining fairness and transparency in automated scoring systems.

### DRT-o1: Optimized Deep Reasoning Translation via Long Chain-of-Thought
**Authors**: Jiaan Wang, Fandong Meng, Yunlong Liang, Jie Zhou

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T16:29:36Z

**Summary**: Recently, O1-like models have emerged as representative examples, illustrating the effectiveness of long chain-of-thought (CoT) in reasoning tasks such as math and coding tasks. In this paper, we introduce DRT-o1, an attempt to bring the success of long CoT to neural machine translation (MT). Specifically, in view of the literature books that might involve similes and metaphors, translating these texts to a target language is very difficult in practice due to cultural differences. In such cases, literal translation often fails to convey the intended meaning effectively. Even for professional human translators, considerable thought must be given to preserving semantics throughout the translation process. To simulate LLMs' long thought ability in MT, we first mine sentences containing similes or metaphors from existing literature books, and then develop a multi-agent framework to translate these sentences via long thought. In the multi-agent framework, a translator is used to iteratively translate the source sentence under the suggestions provided by an advisor. To ensure the effectiveness of the long thoughts, an evaluator is also employed to quantify the translation in each round. In this way, we collect tens of thousands of long-thought MT data, which is used to train our DRT-o1. Using Qwen2.5 and LLama-3.1 as the backbones, DRT-o1 models can learn the thought process during machine translation, and outperform vanilla LLMs as well as existing O1-like LLMs, showing their effectiveness The project is available at https://github.com/krystalan/DRT-o1

### Toward Intelligent and Secure Cloud: Large Language Model Empowered   Proactive Defense
**Authors**: Yuyang Zhou, Guang Cheng, Kang Du, Zihan Chen

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T16:09:28Z

**Summary**: The rapid evolution of cloud computing technologies and the increasing number of cloud applications have provided a large number of benefits in daily lives. However, the diversity and complexity of different components pose a significant challenge to cloud security, especially when dealing with sophisticated and advanced cyberattacks. Recent advancements in generative foundation models (GFMs), particularly in the large language models (LLMs), offer promising solutions for security intelligence. By exploiting the powerful abilities in language understanding, data analysis, task inference, action planning, and code generation, we present LLM-PD, a novel proactive defense architecture that defeats various threats in a proactive manner. LLM-PD can efficiently make a decision through comprehensive data analysis and sequential reasoning, as well as dynamically creating and deploying actionable defense mechanisms on the target cloud. Furthermore, it can flexibly self-evolve based on experience learned from previous interactions and adapt to new attack scenarios without additional training. The experimental results demonstrate its remarkable ability in terms of defense effectiveness and efficiency, particularly highlighting an outstanding success rate when compared with other existing methods.

### TangoFlux: Super Fast and Faithful Text to Audio Generation with Flow   Matching and Clap-Ranked Preference Optimization
**Authors**: Chia-Yu Hung, Navonil Majumder, Zhifeng Kong, Ambuj Mehrish, Rafael Valle, Bryan Catanzaro, Soujanya Poria

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T16:02:44Z

**Summary**: We introduce TangoFlux, an efficient Text-to-Audio (TTA) generative model with 515M parameters, capable of generating up to 30 seconds of 44.1kHz audio in just 3.7 seconds on a single A40 GPU. A key challenge in aligning TTA models lies in the difficulty of creating preference pairs, as TTA lacks structured mechanisms like verifiable rewards or gold-standard answers available for Large Language Models (LLMs). To address this, we propose CLAP-Ranked Preference Optimization (CRPO), a novel framework that iteratively generates and optimizes preference data to enhance TTA alignment. We demonstrate that the audio preference dataset generated using CRPO outperforms existing alternatives. With this framework, TangoFlux achieves state-of-the-art performance across both objective and subjective benchmarks. We open source all code and models to support further research in TTA generation.

### CodeIP: A Grammar-Guided Multi-Bit Watermark for Large Language Models   of Code
**Authors**: Batu Guan, Yao Wan, Zhangqian Bi, Zheng Wang, Hongyu Zhang, Pan Zhou, Lichao Sun

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T15:59:18Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in code generation. It now becomes crucial to identify whether the code is AI-generated and to determine the specific model used, particularly for purposes such as protecting Intellectual Property (IP) in industry and preventing cheating in programming exercises. To this end, several attempts have been made to insert watermarks into machine-generated code. However, existing approaches are limited to inserting only a single bit of information. In this paper, we introduce CodeIP, a novel multi-bit watermarking technique that inserts additional information to preserve crucial provenance details, such as the vendor ID of an LLM, thereby safeguarding the IPs of LLMs in code generation. Furthermore, to ensure the syntactical correctness of the generated code, we propose constraining the sampling process for predicting the next token by training a type predictor. Experiments conducted on a real-world dataset across five programming languages demonstrate the effectiveness of CodeIP in watermarking LLMs for code generation while maintaining the syntactical correctness of code.

### Plancraft: an evaluation dataset for planning with LLM agents
**Authors**: Gautier Dagan, Frank Keller, Alex Lascarides

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T15:58:41Z

**Summary**: We present Plancraft, a multi-modal evaluation dataset for LLM agents. Plancraft has both a text-only and multi-modal interface, based on the Minecraft crafting GUI. We include the Minecraft Wiki to evaluate tool use and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), as well as an oracle planner and oracle RAG information extractor, to ablate the different components of a modern agent architecture. To evaluate decision-making, Plancraft also includes a subset of examples that are intentionally unsolvable, providing a realistic challenge that requires the agent not only to complete tasks but also to decide whether they are solvable at all. We benchmark both open-source and closed-source LLMs and strategies on our task and compare their performance to a handcrafted planner. We find that LLMs and VLMs struggle with the planning problems that Plancraft introduces, and we offer suggestions on how to improve their capabilities.

### Considering experimental frame rates and robust segmentation analysis of   piecewise-linear microparticle trajectories
**Authors**: Keisha J. Cook, Nathan Rayens, Linh Do, Christine K. Payne, Scott A. McKinley

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T15:50:27Z

**Summary**: The movement of intracellular cargo transported by molecular motors is commonly marked by switches between directed motion and stationary pauses. The predominant measure for assessing movement is effective diffusivity, which predicts the mean-squared displacement of particles over long time scales. In this work, we consider an alternative analysis regime that focuses on shorter time scales and relies on automated segmentation of paths. Due to intrinsic uncertainty in changepoint analysis, we highlight the importance of statistical summaries that are robust with respect to the performance of segmentation algorithms. In contrast to effective diffusivity, which averages over multiple behaviors, we emphasize tools that highlight the different motor-cargo states, with an eye toward identifying biophysical mechanisms that determine emergent whole-cell transport properties. By developing a Markov chain model for noisy, continuous, piecewise-linear microparticle movement, and associated mathematical analysis, we provide insight into a common question posed by experimentalists: how does the choice of observational frame rate affect what is inferred about transport properties?

### Automated Robustness Testing for LLM-based NLP Software
**Authors**: Mingxuan Xiao, Yan Xiao, Shunhui Ji, Hanbo Cai, Lei Xue, Pengcheng Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T15:33:34Z

**Summary**: Benefiting from the advancements in LLMs, NLP software has undergone rapid development. Such software is widely employed in various safety-critical tasks, such as financial sentiment analysis, toxic content moderation, and log generation. To our knowledge, there are no known automated robustness testing methods specifically designed for LLM-based NLP software. Given the complexity of LLMs and the unpredictability of real-world inputs (including prompts and examples), it is essential to examine the robustness of overall inputs to ensure the safety of such software.   To this end, this paper introduces the first AutOmated Robustness Testing frAmework, AORTA, which reconceptualizes the testing process into a combinatorial optimization problem. Existing testing methods designed for DNN-based software can be applied to LLM-based software by AORTA, but their effectiveness is limited. To address this, we propose a novel testing method for LLM-based software within AORTA called Adaptive Beam Search. ABS is tailored for the expansive feature space of LLMs and improves testing effectiveness through an adaptive beam width and the capability for backtracking.   We successfully embed 18 test methods in the designed framework AORTA and compared the test validity of ABS with three datasets and five threat models. ABS facilitates a more comprehensive and accurate robustness assessment before software deployment, with an average test success rate of 86.138%. Compared to the currently best-performing baseline PWWS, ABS significantly reduces the computational overhead by up to 3441.895 seconds per successful test case and decreases the number of queries by 218.762 times on average. Furthermore, test cases generated by ABS exhibit greater naturalness and transferability.

**Authors**: Mahir Labib Dihan, Mohammed Eunus Ali, Md Rizwan Parvez

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T15:33:19Z

**Summary**: Mapping and navigation services like Google Maps, Apple Maps, Openstreet Maps, are essential for accessing various location-based data, yet they often struggle to handle natural language geospatial queries. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in question answering (QA), but creating reliable geospatial QA datasets from map services remains challenging. We introduce MapQaTor, a web application that streamlines the creation of reproducible, traceable map-based QA datasets. With its plug-and-play architecture, MapQaTor enables seamless integration with any maps API, allowing users to gather and visualize data from diverse sources with minimal setup. By caching API responses, the platform ensures consistent ground truth, enhancing the reliability of the data even as real-world information evolves. MapQaTor centralizes data retrieval, annotation, and visualization within a single platform, offering a unique opportunity to evaluate the current state of LLM-based geospatial reasoning while advancing their capabilities for improved geospatial understanding. Evaluation metrics show that, MapQaTor speeds up the annotation process by at least 30 times compared to manual methods, underscoring its potential for developing geospatial resources, such as complex map reasoning datasets. The website is live at: https://mapqator.github.io/ and a demo video is available at: https://youtu.be/7_aV9Wmhs6Q.

### From Interests to Insights: An LLM Approach to Course Recommendations   Using Natural Language Queries
**Authors**: Hugh Van Deventer, Mark Mills, August Evrard

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T15:30:23Z

**Summary**: Most universities in the United States encourage their students to explore academic areas before declaring a major and to acquire academic breadth by satisfying a variety of requirements. Each term, students must choose among many thousands of offerings, spanning dozens of subject areas, a handful of courses to take. The curricular environment is also dynamic, and poor communication and search functions on campus can limit a student's ability to discover new courses of interest. To support both students and their advisers in such a setting, we explore a novel Large Language Model (LLM) course recommendation system that applies a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) method to the corpus of course descriptions. The system first generates an 'ideal' course description based on the user's query. This description is converted into a search vector using embeddings, which is then used to find actual courses with similar content by comparing embedding similarities. We describe the method and assess the quality and fairness of some example prompts. Steps to deploy a pilot system on campus are discussed.

### Chasing cosmic inflation: constraints for inflationary models and   reheating insights
**Authors**: Mario Ballardini

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T15:19:27Z

**Summary**: We investigate the impact of different choice of prior's range for the reheating epoch on cosmic inflation parameter inference in light of cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy measurements from the {\em Planck} 2018 legacy release in combination with BICEP/Keck Array 2018 data and additional late-time cosmological observations such as uncalibrated Type Ia supernovae from the Pantheon catalogue, baryon acoustic oscillations and redshift space distortions from SDSS/BOSS/eBOSS. Here, we explore in particular the implications for the combination of reheating and inflationary-model parameter space considering $R+R^2$ inflation and a broad class of $\alpha$-attractor and D-brane models. Propagating the uncertainties due to an unknown reheating phase, these inflationary models completely cover the $n_{\rm s}$-$r$ parameter space allowed by {\em Planck} and BICEP/Keck data and represent good targets for future CMB and large-scale structure experiments. We perform a Bayesian model comparison of inflationary models, taking into account the reheating uncertainties assuming a conservative but accurate modelling of inflationary predictions. $R+R^2$ inflation, T-model $\alpha$-attractor inflation for $n=1$, E-model $\alpha$-attractor inflation for $n=1/2$, and KKLT inflation for $p=5$ are the better performing models, with none being preferred at a statistically significant level.

### Verbosity-Aware Rationale Reduction: Effective Reduction of Redundant   Rationale via Principled Criteria
**Authors**: Joonwon Jang, Jaehee Kim, Wonbin Kweon, Hwanjo Yu

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T15:15:08Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on generating extensive intermediate reasoning units (e.g., tokens, sentences) to enhance final answer quality across a wide range of complex tasks. While generating multiple reasoning paths or iteratively refining rationales proves effective for improving performance, these approaches inevitably result in significantly higher inference costs. In this work, we propose a novel sentence-level rationale reduction training framework that leverages likelihood-based criteria, verbosity, to identify and remove redundant reasoning sentences. Unlike previous approaches that utilize token-level reduction, our sentence-level reduction framework maintains model performance while reducing generation length. This preserves the original reasoning abilities of LLMs and achieves an average 17.15% reduction in generation costs across various models and tasks.

### Weber-Fechner Law in Temporal Difference learning derived from Control   as Inference
**Authors**: Keiichiro Takahashi, Taisuke Kobayashi, Tomoya Yamanokuchi, Takamitsu Matsubara

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T15:13:57Z

**Summary**: This paper investigates a novel nonlinear update rule based on temporal difference (TD) errors in reinforcement learning (RL). The update rule in the standard RL states that the TD error is linearly proportional to the degree of updates, treating all rewards equally without no bias. On the other hand, the recent biological studies revealed that there are nonlinearities in the TD error and the degree of updates, biasing policies optimistic or pessimistic. Such biases in learning due to nonlinearities are expected to be useful and intentionally leftover features in biological learning. Therefore, this research explores a theoretical framework that can leverage the nonlinearity between the degree of the update and TD errors. To this end, we focus on a control as inference framework, since it is known as a generalized formulation encompassing various RL and optimal control methods. In particular, we investigate the uncomputable nonlinear term needed to be approximately excluded in the derivation of the standard RL from control as inference. By analyzing it, Weber-Fechner law (WFL) is found, namely, perception (a.k.a. the degree of updates) in response to stimulus change (a.k.a. TD error) is attenuated by increase in the stimulus intensity (a.k.a. the value function). To numerically reveal the utilities of WFL on RL, we then propose a practical implementation using a reward-punishment framework and modifying the definition of optimality. Analysis of this implementation reveals that two utilities can be expected i) to increase rewards to a certain level early, and ii) to sufficiently suppress punishment. We finally investigate and discuss the expected utilities through simulations and robot experiments. As a result, the proposed RL algorithm with WFL shows the expected utilities that accelerate the reward-maximizing startup and continue to suppress punishments during learning.

### Plug-and-Play Training Framework for Preference Optimization
**Authors**: Jingyuan Ma, Rui Li, Zheng Li, Lei Sha, Zhifang Sui

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T15:01:48Z

**Summary**: Recently, preference optimization methods such as DPO have significantly enhanced large language models (LLMs) in wide tasks including dialogue and question-answering. However, current methods fail to account for the varying difficulty levels of training samples during preference optimization, leading to mediocre performance in tasks with high accuracy requirements, particularly in mathematical reasoning. To address this limitation, we propose a novel training framework, which employs multiple sampling to analyze output distributions, assign different weights to samples, and incorporate these weights into the preference optimization process. This plug-and-play approach enables LLMs to prioritize challenging examples during training, improving learning efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework integrates seamlessly with various preference optimization methods and achieves consistent improvements in mathematical reasoning tasks.

### EigenSR: Eigenimage-Bridged Pre-Trained RGB Learners for Single   Hyperspectral Image Super-Resolution
**Authors**: Xi Su, Xiangfei Shen, Mingyang Wan, Jing Nie, Lihui Chen, Haijun Liu, Xichuan Zhou

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T14:58:54Z

**Summary**: Single hyperspectral image super-resolution (single-HSI-SR) aims to improve the resolution of a single input low-resolution HSI. Due to the bottleneck of data scarcity, the development of single-HSI-SR lags far behind that of RGB natural images. In recent years, research on RGB SR has shown that models pre-trained on large-scale benchmark datasets can greatly improve performance on unseen data, which may stand as a remedy for HSI. But how can we transfer the pre-trained RGB model to HSI, to overcome the data-scarcity bottleneck? Because of the significant difference in the channels between the pre-trained RGB model and the HSI, the model cannot focus on the correlation along the spectral dimension, thus limiting its ability to utilize on HSI. Inspired by the HSI spatial-spectral decoupling, we propose a new framework that first fine-tunes the pre-trained model with the spatial components (known as eigenimages), and then infers on unseen HSI using an iterative spectral regularization (ISR) to maintain the spectral correlation. The advantages of our method lie in: 1) we effectively inject the spatial texture processing capabilities of the pre-trained RGB model into HSI while keeping spectral fidelity, 2) learning in the spectral-decorrelated domain can improve the generalizability to spectral-agnostic data, and 3) our inference in the eigenimage domain naturally exploits the spectral low-rank property of HSI, thereby reducing the complexity. This work bridges the gap between pre-trained RGB models and HSI via eigenimages, addressing the issue of limited HSI training data, hence the name EigenSR. Extensive experiments show that EigenSR outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in both spatial and spectral metrics.

### KARPA: A Training-free Method of Adapting Knowledge Graph as References   for Large Language Model's Reasoning Path Aggregation
**Authors**: Siyuan Fang, Kaijing Ma, Tianyu Zheng, Xinrun Du, Ningxuan Lu, Ge Zhang, Qingkun Tang

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T14:58:46Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional performance across a variety of tasks, yet they are often affected by hallucinations and the timeliness of knowledge. Leveraging knowledge graphs (KGs) as external knowledge sources has emerged as a viable solution, but existing methods for LLM-based knowledge graph question answering (KGQA) are often limited by step-by-step decision-making on KGs, restricting the global planning and reasoning capabilities of LLMs, or they require fine-tuning or pre-training on specific KGs. To address these challenges, we propose Knowledge graph Assisted Reasoning Path Aggregation (KARPA), a novel framework that harnesses the global planning abilities of LLMs for efficient and accurate KG reasoning. KARPA operates in three steps: pre-planning relation paths using the LLM's global planning capabilities, matching semantically relevant paths via an embedding model, and reasoning over these paths to generate answers. Unlike existing KGQA methods, KARPA avoids stepwise traversal, requires no additional training, and is adaptable to various LLM architectures. Extensive experimental results show that KARPA achieves state-of-the-art performance in KGQA tasks, delivering both high efficiency and accuracy. Our code will be available on Github.

### Efficiently Serving LLM Reasoning Programs with Certaindex
**Authors**: Yichao Fu, Junda Chen, Siqi Zhu, Zheyu Fu, Zhongdongming Dai, Aurick Qiao, Hao Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T14:57:53Z

**Summary**: The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) has unlocked their capabilities in advanced reasoning tasks like mathematical problem-solving, code generation, and legal analysis. Central to this progress are inference-time reasoning algorithms, which refine outputs by exploring multiple solution paths, at the cost of increasing compute demands and response latencies. Existing serving systems fail to adapt to the scaling behaviors of these algorithms or the varying difficulty of queries, leading to inefficient resource use and unmet latency targets.   We present Dynasor, a system that optimizes inference-time compute for LLM reasoning queries. Unlike traditional engines, Dynasor tracks and schedules requests within reasoning queries and uses Certaindex, a proxy that measures statistical reasoning progress based on model certainty, to guide compute allocation dynamically. Dynasor co-adapts scheduling with reasoning progress: it allocates more compute to hard queries, reduces compute for simpler ones, and terminates unpromising queries early, balancing accuracy, latency, and cost. On diverse datasets and algorithms, Dynasor reduces compute by up to 50% in batch processing and sustaining 3.3x higher query rates or 4.7x tighter latency SLOs in online serving.

### SepLLM: Accelerate Large Language Models by Compressing One Segment into   One Separator
**Authors**: Guoxuan Chen, Han Shi, Jiawei Li, Yihang Gao, Xiaozhe Ren, Yimeng Chen, Xin Jiang, Zhenguo Li, Weiyang Liu, Chao Huang

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T14:54:29Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited exceptional performance across a spectrum of natural language processing tasks. However, their substantial sizes pose considerable challenges, particularly in computational demands and inference speed, due to their quadratic complexity. In this work, we have identified a key pattern: certain seemingly meaningless special tokens (i.e., separators) contribute disproportionately to attention scores compared to semantically meaningful tokens. This observation suggests that information of the segments between these separator tokens can be effectively condensed into the separator tokens themselves without significant information loss. Guided by this insight, we introduce SepLLM, a plug-and-play framework that accelerates inference by compressing these segments and eliminating redundant tokens. Additionally, we implement efficient kernels for training acceleration. Experimental results across training-free, training-from-scratch, and post-training settings demonstrate SepLLM's effectiveness. Notably, using the Llama-3-8B backbone, SepLLM achieves over 50% reduction in KV cache on the GSM8K-CoT benchmark while maintaining comparable performance. Furthermore, in streaming settings, SepLLM effectively processes sequences of up to 4 million tokens or more while maintaining consistent language modeling capabilities.

### Causal inference with recurrent and competing events
**Authors**: Matias Janvin, Jessica G. Young, PÃ¥l C. Ryalen, Mats J. Stensrud

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T14:48:42Z

**Summary**: Many research questions concern treatment effects on outcomes that can recur several times in the same individual. For example, medical researchers are interested in treatment effects on hospitalizations in heart failure patients and sports injuries in athletes. Competing events, such as death, complicate causal inference in studies of recurrent events because once a competing event occurs, an individual cannot have more recurrent events. Several statistical estimands have been studied in recurrent event settings, with and without competing events. However, the causal interpretations of these estimands, and the conditions that are required to identify these estimands from observed data, have yet to be formalized. Here we use a formal framework for causal inference to formulate several causal estimands in recurrent event settings, with and without competing events. We clarify when commonly used classical statistical estimands can be interpreted as causal quantities from the causal mediation literature, such as (controlled) direct effects and total effects. Furthermore, we show that recent results on interventionist mediation estimands allow us to define new causal estimands with recurrent and competing events that may be of particular clinical relevance in many subject matter settings. We use causal directed acyclic graphs and single world intervention graphs to illustrate how to reason about identification conditions for the various causal estimands based on subject matter knowledge. Furthermore, using results on counting processes, we show that our causal estimands and their identification conditions, which are articulated in discrete time, converge to classical continuous time counterparts in the limit of fine discretizations of time.

### QuantumLLMInstruct: A 500k LLM Instruction-Tuning Dataset with   Problem-Solution Pairs for Quantum Computing
**Authors**: Shlomo Kashani

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T13:53:51Z

**Summary**: We present QuantumLLMInstruct (QLMMI), an innovative dataset featuring over 500,000 meticulously curated instruction-following problem-solution pairs designed specifically for quantum computing - the largest and most comprehensive dataset of its kind. Originating from over 90 primary seed domains and encompassing hundreds of subdomains autonomously generated by LLMs, QLMMI marks a transformative step in the diversity and richness of quantum computing datasets.   Designed for instruction fine-tuning, QLMMI seeks to significantly improve LLM performance in addressing complex quantum computing challenges across a wide range of quantum physics topics. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have propelled advancements in computational science with datasets like Omni-MATH and OpenMathInstruct, these primarily target Olympiad-level mathematics, leaving quantum computing largely unexplored.   The creation of QLMMI follows a rigorous four-stage methodology. Initially, foundational problems are developed using predefined templates, focusing on critical areas such as synthetic Hamiltonians, QASM code generation, Jordan-Wigner transformations, and Trotter-Suzuki quantum circuit decompositions. Next, detailed and domain-specific solutions are crafted to ensure accuracy and relevance. In the third stage, the dataset is enriched through advanced reasoning techniques, including Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Task-Oriented Reasoning and Action (ToRA), which enhance problem-solution diversity while adhering to strict mathematical standards. Lastly, a zero-shot Judge LLM performs self-assessments to validate the dataset's quality and reliability, minimizing human oversight requirements.

### Efficient Link Prediction via GNN Layers Induced by Negative Sampling
**Authors**: Yuxin Wang, Xiannian Hu, Quan Gan, Xuanjing Huang, Xipeng Qiu, David Wipf

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T13:53:16Z

**Summary**: Graph neural networks (GNNs) for link prediction can loosely be divided into two broad categories. First, \emph{node-wise} architectures pre-compute individual embeddings for each node that are later combined by a simple decoder to make predictions. While extremely efficient at inference time, model expressiveness is limited such that isomorphic nodes contributing to candidate edges may not be distinguishable, compromising accuracy. In contrast, \emph{edge-wise} methods rely on the formation of edge-specific subgraph embeddings to enrich the representation of pair-wise relationships, disambiguating isomorphic nodes to improve accuracy, but with increased model complexity. To better navigate this trade-off, we propose a novel GNN architecture whereby the \emph{forward pass} explicitly depends on \emph{both} positive (as is typical) and negative (unique to our approach) edges to inform more flexible, yet still cheap node-wise embeddings. This is achieved by recasting the embeddings themselves as minimizers of a forward-pass-specific energy function that favors separation of positive and negative samples. Notably, this energy is distinct from the actual training loss shared by most existing link prediction models, where contrastive pairs only influence the \textit{backward pass}. As demonstrated by extensive empirical evaluations, the resulting architecture retains the inference speed of node-wise models, while producing competitive accuracy with edge-wise alternatives. We released our code at https://github.com/yxzwang/SubmissionverOfYinYanGNN.

### AGON: Automated Design Framework for Customizing Processors from ISA   Documents

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T13:50:20Z

**Summary**: Customized processors are attractive solutions for vast domain-specific applications due to their high energy efficiency. However, designing a processor in traditional flows is time-consuming and expensive. To address this, researchers have explored methods including the use of agile development tools like Chisel or SpinalHDL, high-level synthesis (HLS) from programming languages like C or SystemC, and more recently, leveraging large language models (LLMs) to generate hardware description language (HDL) code from natural language descriptions. However, each method has limitations in terms of expressiveness, correctness, and performance, leading to a persistent contradiction between the level of automation and the effectiveness of the design. Overall, how to automatically design highly efficient and practical processors with minimal human effort remains a challenge.   In this paper, we propose AGON, a novel framework designed to leverage LLMs for the efficient design of out-of-order (OoO) customized processors with minimal human effort. Central to AGON is the nano-operator function (nOP function) based Intermediate Representation (IR), which bridges high-level descriptions and hardware implementations while decoupling functionality from performance optimization, thereby providing an automatic design framework that is expressive and efficient, has correctness guarantees, and enables PPA (Power, Performance, and Area) optimization.   Experimental results show that superior to previous LLM-assisted automatic design flows, AGON facilitates designing a series of customized OoO processors that achieve on average 2.35 $\times$ speedup compared with BOOM, a general-purpose CPU designed by experts, with minimal design effort.

### Nash CoT: Multi-Path Inference with Preference Equilibrium
**Authors**: Ziqi Zhang, Cunxiang Wang, Xiong Xiao, Yue Zhang, Donglin Wang

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T13:43:46Z

**Summary**: Chain of thought (CoT) is a reasoning framework that can enhance the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) on complex inference tasks. In particular, among various studies related to CoT, multi-path inference stands out as a simple yet effective improvement. However, there is no optimal setting for the number of inference paths. Therefore, we have to increase the number of inference paths to obtain better results, which in turn increases the inference cost. To address this limitation, we can utilize question-related role templates to guide LLMs into relevant roles, thereby increasing the possibility of correct inferences for each path and further reducing dependence on the number of inference paths while improving reasoning accuracy. However, placing LLMs into specific roles may reduce their reasoning diversity and performance on a few tasks where role dependence is low. To alleviate the excessive immersion of the LLM into a specific role, we propose Nash CoT by constructing a game system on each path that balances the generation from role-specific LLMs' and the general LLMs' generation, thereby ensuring both effective role adoption and diversity in LLM generation further maintaining the performance of multi-path inference while reducing the requirement of the number of inference paths. We evaluate Nash CoT across various inference tasks, including Arabic Reasoning, Commonsense Question Answering, and Symbolic Inference, achieving results that are comparable to or better than those of multi-path CoT with the equal number of inference paths.

### Time-averaging Polarimetric and Spectral Properties of Gamma-Ray Bursts
**Authors**: Liang Li, Soroush Shakeri

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T13:42:25Z

**Summary**: The composition and radiation mechanism of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) within jets continue to be hotly debated. Investigating the joint polarimetric and spectral properties is crucial for understanding GRB composition and radiation mechanism. Various jet properties, such as ``kinetic-energy-dominated" (KED), ``Poynting-flux-dominated" (PFD), and ``hybrid-dominated" (HD) relativistic outflows, have been inferred from observed GRB spectra, with expectations of differing polarization levels among them. In this study, we analyzed a sample of 27 GRBs detected by the Gamma-ray Burst Monitor on board the NASA Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, focusing on 26 bursts with significant polarization measurements. Our analysis revealed that 16 bursts (62\%) were predominantly associated with the ``PFD'' jet type, while 10 bursts (38\%) were classified as HD, implying that photosphere emission may also be a possible mechanism powering the high levels of polarization. Notably, no bursts were identified as KED-type. We found distinct polarization properties, with HD-type bursts exhibiting consistently higher polarization levels than PFD-type bursts. We proposed models incorporating ordered and random magnetic field configurations specific to hybrid jets.

### Ontology-grounded Automatic Knowledge Graph Construction by LLM under   Wikidata schema
**Authors**: Xiaohan Feng, Xixin Wu, Helen Meng

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T13:36:05Z

**Summary**: We propose an ontology-grounded approach to Knowledge Graph (KG) construction using Large Language Models (LLMs) on a knowledge base. An ontology is authored by generating Competency Questions (CQ) on knowledge base to discover knowledge scope, extracting relations from CQs, and attempt to replace equivalent relations by their counterpart in Wikidata. To ensure consistency and interpretability in the resulting KG, we ground generation of KG with the authored ontology based on extracted relations. Evaluation on benchmark datasets demonstrates competitive performance in knowledge graph construction task. Our work presents a promising direction for scalable KG construction pipeline with minimal human intervention, that yields high quality and human-interpretable KGs, which are interoperable with Wikidata semantics for potential knowledge base expansion.

### WeatherDG: LLM-assisted Diffusion Model for Procedural Weather   Generation in Domain-Generalized Semantic Segmentation
**Authors**: Chenghao Qian, Yuhu Guo, Yuhong Mo, Wenjing Li

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T13:34:23Z

**Summary**: In this work, we propose a novel approach, namely WeatherDG, that can generate realistic, weather-diverse, and driving-screen images based on the cooperation of two foundation models, i.e, Stable Diffusion (SD) and Large Language Model (LLM). Specifically, we first fine-tune the SD with source data, aligning the content and layout of generated samples with real-world driving scenarios. Then, we propose a procedural prompt generation method based on LLM, which can enrich scenario descriptions and help SD automatically generate more diverse, detailed images. In addition, we introduce a balanced generation strategy, which encourages the SD to generate high-quality objects of tailed classes under various weather conditions, such as riders and motorcycles. This segmentation-model-agnostic method can improve the generalization ability of existing models by additionally adapting them with the generated synthetic data. Experiments on three challenging datasets show that our method can significantly improve the segmentation performance of different state-of-the-art models on target domains. Notably, in the setting of ''Cityscapes to ACDC'', our method improves the baseline HRDA by 13.9% in mIoU.

### Enhanced Multimodal RAG-LLM for Accurate Visual Question Answering
**Authors**: Junxiao Xue, Quan Deng, Fei Yu, Yanhao Wang, Jun Wang, Yuehua Li

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T13:16:08Z

**Summary**: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs), such as GPT-4o, Gemini, LLaVA, and Flamingo, have made significant progress in integrating visual and textual modalities, excelling in tasks like visual question answering (VQA), image captioning, and content retrieval. They can generate coherent and contextually relevant descriptions of images. However, they still face challenges in accurately identifying and counting objects and determining their spatial locations, particularly in complex scenes with overlapping or small objects. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework based on multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), which introduces structured scene graphs to enhance object recognition, relationship identification, and spatial understanding within images. Our framework improves the MLLM's capacity to handle tasks requiring precise visual descriptions, especially in scenarios with challenging perspectives, such as aerial views or scenes with dense object arrangements. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on the VG-150 dataset that focuses on first-person visual understanding and the AUG dataset that involves aerial imagery. The results show that our approach consistently outperforms existing MLLMs in VQA tasks, which stands out in recognizing, localizing, and quantifying objects in different spatial contexts and provides more accurate visual descriptions.

### Dynamics of Information Exchange in Zebrafish: The Role of U-Turns in   Visual Communication and Behavior Modulation
**Authors**: C. K. Chan, Hao-Yun Hsu

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T12:44:48Z

**Summary**: Motions of visually coupled zebrafish pairs are studied to understand the effects of information exchange on their behavior as a function of their minimal separation ($d$). We find that when $d$ is small, the pair can display a leader-follower relation (LFR) with trajectories of almost synchronized form. However, with larger $d$, although the same LFR is still maintained, the originally similar trajectories turn into different forms. Detailed analysis of their motion trajectories suggests that the pair might be using U-turns (UTs) to exchange information and to maintain a LFR at the same time. A simulation model based on UTs with inferred and proposed rules is able to reproduce prominent features of observed trajectories; indicating that the transition of trajectories can be understood as the result of a change in information exchange between the fish as $d$ increases. Our finding that UTs as important visual signals is consistent with the fact that UTs can induce a large amount of firings in retinas of observing fish.

### An Empirical Study of Catastrophic Forgetting in Large Language Models   During Continual Fine-tuning
**Authors**: Yun Luo, Zhen Yang, Fandong Meng, Yafu Li, Jie Zhou, Yue Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T12:32:49Z

**Summary**: Catastrophic forgetting (CF) is a phenomenon that occurs in machine learning when a model forgets previously learned information while acquiring new knowledge for achieving a satisfactory performance in downstream tasks. As large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance, it is intriguing to investigate whether CF exists during the continual instruction tuning of LLMs. This study empirically evaluates the forgetting phenomenon in LLMs' knowledge during continual instruction tuning from the perspectives of domain knowledge, reasoning, and reading comprehension. The experiments reveal that catastrophic forgetting is generally observed in LLMs ranging from 1b to 7b parameters. Surprisingly, as the model scale increases, the severity of forgetting intensifies in such a model sale range which may result from the much significant initial performance in the larger LLM. Comparing the decoder-only model BLOOMZ with the encoder-decoder model mT0, BLOOMZ exhibits less forgetting and retains more knowledge. Interestingly, we also observe that LLMs can mitigate language biases, such as gender bias, during continual fine-tuning. Furthermore, our findings indicate that general instruction tuning can help alleviate the forgetting phenomenon in LLMs during subsequent fine-tuning.

### WalkVLM:Aid Visually Impaired People Walking by Vision Language Model
**Authors**: Zhiqiang Yuan, Ting Zhang, Jiapei Zhang, Jie Zhou, Jinchao Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T12:29:02Z

**Summary**: Approximately 200 million individuals around the world suffer from varying degrees of visual impairment, making it crucial to leverage AI technology to offer walking assistance for these people. With the recent progress of vision-language models (VLMs), employing VLMs to improve this field has emerged as a popular research topic. However, most existing methods are studied on self-built question-answering datasets, lacking a unified training and testing benchmark for walk guidance. Moreover, in blind walking task, it is necessary to perform real-time streaming video parsing and generate concise yet informative reminders, which poses a great challenge for VLMs that suffer from redundant responses and low inference efficiency. In this paper, we firstly release a diverse, extensive, and unbiased walking awareness dataset, containing 12k video-manual annotation pairs from Europe and Asia to provide a fair training and testing benchmark for blind walking task. Furthermore, a WalkVLM model is proposed, which employs chain of thought for hierarchical planning to generate concise but informative reminders and utilizes temporal-aware adaptive prediction to reduce the temporal redundancy of reminders. Finally, we have established a solid benchmark for blind walking task and verified the advantages of WalkVLM in stream video processing for this task compared to other VLMs. Our dataset and code will be released at anonymous link https://walkvlm2024.github.io.

### DoTA: Weight-Decomposed Tensor Adaptation for Large Language Models
**Authors**: Xiaolin Hu, Xiang Cheng, Peiyu Liu, Wei Liu, Jian Luan, Bin Wang, Yong Liu

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T12:00:47Z

**Summary**: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) reduces the computational and memory demands of fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) by approximating updates with low-rank matrices. However, low-rank approximation in two-dimensional space fails to capture high-dimensional structures within the target matrix. Recently, tensor decomposition methods have been explored for fine-tuning LLMs, leveraging their ability to extract structured information. Yet, these approaches primarily rely on random initialization, and the impact of initialization on tensor adaptation remains underexplored. In this paper, we reveal that random initialization significantly diverges from the validation loss achieved by full fine-tuning. To address this, we propose Weight-Decomposed Tensor Adaptation (DoTA), which leverages the Matrix Product Operator (MPO) decomposition of pre-trained weights for effective initialization in fine-tuning LLMs. Additionally, we introduce QDoTA, a quantized version of DoTA designed for 4-bit quantization. Experiments on commonsense and arithmetic reasoning tasks show that DoTA outperforms random initialization methods with fewer parameters. QDoTA further reduces memory consumption and achieves comparable performance to DoTA on commonsense reasoning tasks. We will release our code to support future research.

### CF-CGN: Channel Fingerprints Extrapolation for Multi-band Massive MIMO   Transmission based on Cycle-Consistent Generative Networks
**Authors**: Chenjie Xie, Li You, Zhenzhou Jin, Jinke Tang, Xiqi Gao, Xiang-Gen Xia

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T11:52:39Z

**Summary**: Multi-band massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication can promote the cooperation of licensed and unlicensed spectra, effectively enhancing spectrum efficiency for Wi-Fi and other wireless systems. As an enabler for multi-band transmission, channel fingerprints (CF), also known as the channel knowledge map or radio environment map, are used to assist channel state information (CSI) acquisition and reduce computational complexity. In this paper, we propose CF-CGN (Channel Fingerprints with Cycle-consistent Generative Networks) to extrapolate CF for multi-band massive MIMO transmission where licensed and unlicensed spectra cooperate to provide ubiquitous connectivity. Specifically, we first model CF as a multichannel image and transform the extrapolation problem into an image translation task, which converts CF from one frequency to another by exploring the shared characteristics of statistical CSI in the beam domain. Then, paired generative networks are designed and coupled by variable-weight cycle consistency losses to fit the reciprocal relationship at different bands. Matched with the coupled networks, a joint training strategy is developed accordingly, supporting synchronous optimization of all trainable parameters. During the inference process, we also introduce a refining scheme to improve the extrapolation accuracy based on the resolution of CF. Numerical results illustrate that our proposed CF-CGN can achieve bidirectional extrapolation with an error of 5-17 dB lower than the benchmarks in different communication scenarios, demonstrating its excellent generalization ability. We further show that the sum rate performance assisted by CF-CGN-based CF is close to that with perfect CSI for multi-band massive MIMO transmission.

### A gradient-based and determinant-free framework for fully Bayesian   Gaussian process regression
**Authors**: P. Michael Kielstra, Michael Lindsey

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T11:51:14Z

**Summary**: Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) is widely used for inferring functions from noisy data. GPR crucially relies on the choice of a kernel, which might be specified in terms of a collection of hyperparameters that must be chosen or learned. Fully Bayesian GPR seeks to infer these kernel hyperparameters in a Bayesian sense, and the key computational challenge in sampling from their posterior distribution is the need for frequent determinant evaluations of large kernel matrices. This paper introduces a gradient-based, determinant-free approach for fully Bayesian GPR that combines a Gaussian integration trick for avoiding the determinant with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) sampling. Our framework permits a matrix-free formulation and reduces the difficulty of dealing with hyperparameter gradients to a simple automatic differentiation. Our implementation is highly flexible and leverages GPU acceleration with linear-scaling memory footprint. Numerical experiments demonstrate the method's ability to scale gracefully to both high-dimensional hyperparameter spaces and large kernel matrices.

### Attention Is All You Need For Mixture-of-Depths Routing
**Authors**: Advait Gadhikar, Souptik Kumar Majumdar, Niclas Popp, Piyapat Saranrittichai, Martin Rapp, Lukas Schott

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T11:25:54Z

**Summary**: Advancements in deep learning are driven by training models with increasingly larger numbers of parameters, which in turn heightens the computational demands. To address this issue, Mixture-of-Depths (MoD) models have been proposed to dynamically assign computations only to the most relevant parts of the inputs, thereby enabling the deployment of large-parameter models with high efficiency during inference and training. These MoD models utilize a routing mechanism to determine which tokens should be processed by a layer, or skipped. However, conventional MoD models employ additional network layers specifically for the routing which are difficult to train, and add complexity and deployment overhead to the model. In this paper, we introduce a novel attention-based routing mechanism A-MoD that leverages the existing attention map of the preceding layer for routing decisions within the current layer. Compared to standard routing, A-MoD allows for more efficient training as it introduces no additional trainable parameters and can be easily adapted from pretrained transformer models. Furthermore, it can increase the performance of the MoD model. For instance, we observe up to 2% higher accuracy on ImageNet compared to standard routing and isoFLOP ViT baselines. Furthermore, A-MoD improves the MoD training convergence, leading to up to 2x faster transfer learning.

### Distilling Fine-grained Sentiment Understanding from Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Yice Zhang, Guangyu Xie, Hongling Xu, Kaiheng Hou, Jianzhu Bao, Qianlong Wang, Shiwei Chen, Ruifeng Xu

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T11:24:32Z

**Summary**: Fine-grained sentiment analysis (FSA) aims to extract and summarize user opinions from vast opinionated text. Recent studies demonstrate that large language models (LLMs) possess exceptional sentiment understanding capabilities. However, directly deploying LLMs for FSA applications incurs high inference costs. Therefore, this paper investigates the distillation of fine-grained sentiment understanding from LLMs into small language models (SLMs). We prompt LLMs to examine and interpret the sentiments of given reviews and then utilize the generated content to pretrain SLMs. Additionally, we develop a comprehensive FSA benchmark to evaluate both SLMs and LLMs. Extensive experiments on this benchmark reveal that: (1) distillation significantly enhances the performance of SLMs in FSA tasks, achieving a 6.00\% improvement in $F_1$-score, and the distilled model can outperform Llama-2-7b with only 220M parameters; (2) distillation equips SLMs with excellent zero-shot sentiment classification capabilities, enabling them to match or even exceed their teacher models. These results suggest that distillation from LLMs is a highly promising direction for FSA. We will release our code, data, and pretrained model weights at https://github.com/HITSZ-HLT/FSA-Distillation.

### Enhancing Annotated Bibliography Generation with LLM Ensembles
**Authors**: Sergio Bermejo

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T11:07:05Z

**Summary**: This work proposes a novel approach to enhancing annotated bibliography generation through Large Language Model (LLM) ensembles. In particular, multiple LLMs in different roles -- controllable text generation, evaluation, and summarization -- are introduced and validated using a systematic methodology to enhance model performance in scholarly tasks. Output diversity among the ensemble that generates text is obtained using different LLM parameters, followed by an LLM acting as a judge to assess relevance, accuracy, and coherence. Responses selected by several combining strategies are then merged and refined through summarization and redundancy removal techniques. The preliminary experimental validation demonstrates that the combined outputs from the LLM ensemble improve coherence and relevance compared to individual responses, leading to a 38% improvement in annotation quality and a 51% reduction in content redundancy, thus highlighting the potential for automating complex scholarly tasks while maintaining high-quality standards.

### Geometric-Averaged Preference Optimization for Soft Preference Labels
**Authors**: Hiroki Furuta, Kuang-Huei Lee, Shixiang Shane Gu, Yutaka Matsuo, Aleksandra Faust, Heiga Zen, Izzeddin Gur

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T11:05:20Z

**Summary**: Many algorithms for aligning LLMs with human preferences assume that human preferences are binary and deterministic. However, human preferences can vary across individuals, and therefore should be represented distributionally. In this work, we introduce the distributional soft preference labels and improve Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with a weighted geometric average of the LLM output likelihood in the loss function. This approach adjusts the scale of learning loss based on the soft labels such that the loss would approach zero when the responses are closer to equally preferred. This simple modification can be easily applied to any DPO-based methods and mitigate over-optimization and objective mismatch, which prior works suffer from. Our experiments simulate the soft preference labels with AI feedback from LLMs and demonstrate that geometric averaging consistently improves performance on standard benchmarks for alignment research. In particular, we observe more preferable responses than binary labels and significant improvements where modestly-confident labels are in the majority.

### Simulation-based Inference for Cardiovascular Models
**Authors**: Antoine Wehenkel, Laura Manduchi, Jens Behrmann, Luca Pegolotti, Andrew C. Miller, Guillermo Sapiro, Ozan Sener, Marco Cuturi, JÃ¶rn-Henrik Jacobsen

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T10:53:48Z

**Summary**: Over the past decades, hemodynamics simulators have steadily evolved and have become tools of choice for studying cardiovascular systems in-silico. While such tools are routinely used to simulate whole-body hemodynamics from physiological parameters, solving the corresponding inverse problem of mapping waveforms back to plausible physiological parameters remains both promising and challenging. Motivated by advances in simulation-based inference (SBI), we cast this inverse problem as statistical inference. In contrast to alternative approaches, SBI provides \textit{posterior distributions} for the parameters of interest, providing a \textit{multi-dimensional} representation of uncertainty for \textit{individual} measurements. We showcase this ability by performing an in-silico uncertainty analysis of five biomarkers of clinical interest comparing several measurement modalities. Beyond the corroboration of known facts, such as the feasibility of estimating heart rate, our study highlights the potential of estimating new biomarkers from standard-of-care measurements. SBI reveals practically relevant findings that cannot be captured by standard sensitivity analyses, such as the existence of sub-populations for which parameter estimation exhibits distinct uncertainty regimes. Finally, we study the gap between in-vivo and in-silico with the MIMIC-III waveform database and critically discuss how cardiovascular simulations can inform real-world data analysis.

### From sparse to dense functional time series: phase transitions of   detecting structural breaks and beyond
**Authors**: Leheng Cai, Qirui Hu

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T10:52:29Z

**Summary**: We develop a novel methodology for detecting abrupt break points in mean functions of functional time series, adaptable to arbitrary sampling schemes. By employing B-spline smoothing, we introduce $\mathcal L_{\infty}$ and $\mathcal L_2$ test statistics statistics based on a smoothed cumulative summation (CUMSUM) process, and derive the corresponding asymptotic distributions under the null and local alternative hypothesis, as well as the phase transition boundary from sparse to dense. We further establish the convergence rate of the proposed break point estimators and conduct statistical inference on the jump magnitude based on the estimated break point, also applicable across sparsely, semi-densely, and densely, observed random functions. Extensive numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed procedures. To illustrate the practical relevance, we apply the developed methods to analyze electricity price data and temperature data.

### Analog Alchemy: Neural Computation with In-Memory Inference, Learning   and Routing
**Authors**: Yigit Demirag

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T10:35:03Z

**Summary**: As neural computation is revolutionizing the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), rethinking the ideal neural hardware is becoming the next frontier. Fast and reliable von Neumann architecture has been the hosting platform for neural computation. Although capable, its separation of memory and computation creates the bottleneck for the energy efficiency of neural computation, contrasting the biological brain. The question remains: how can we efficiently combine memory and computation, while exploiting the physics of the substrate, to build intelligent systems? In this thesis, I explore an alternative way with memristive devices for neural computation, where the unique physical dynamics of the devices are used for inference, learning and routing. Guided by the principles of gradient-based learning, we selected functions that need to be materialized, and analyzed connectomics principles for efficient wiring. Despite non-idealities and noise inherent in analog physics, I will provide hardware evidence of adaptability of local learning to memristive substrates, new material stacks and circuit blocks that aid in solving the credit assignment problem and efficient routing between analog crossbars for scalable architectures.

### Are LLMs Really Not Knowledgable? Mining the Submerged Knowledge in   LLMs' Memory
**Authors**: Xingjian Tao, Yiwei Wang, Yujun Cai, Zhicheng Yang, Jing Tang

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T10:29:18Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise as potential knowledge bases, yet they often struggle with question-answering tasks and are prone to hallucinations. While previous research attributes these issues to knowledge gaps in the model's parameters, our investigation reveals a different phenomenon: LLMs often retain correct knowledge even when generating incorrect answers. Through analysis of model's internal representations, we find that correct answers frequently appear among high-probability tokens despite not being selected as final outputs. Based on this observation, we introduce Hits@k, a new metric to assess knowledge retention independent of expression accuracy. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that LLMs store significantly more knowledge than their QA performance suggests. Building on these findings, we develop SkipUnsure, a method to improve answer accuracy by leveraging detected but unexpressed knowledge. Experiments on both open-domain and specific-domain datasets show consistent improvements, with accuracy gains of up to 11.8% on DBPedia and 6.3% on IMDB, without requiring model retraining.

### Identifying average causal effect in regression discontinuity design   with auxiliary data
**Authors**: Xinqin Feng, Wenjie Hu, Pu Yang, Tingyu Li, Xiao-Hua Zhou

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T10:09:51Z

**Summary**: Regression discontinuity designs are widely used when treatment assignment is determined by whether a running variable exceeds a predefined threshold. However, most research focuses on estimating local causal effects at the threshold, leaving the challenge of identifying treatment effects away from the cutoff largely unaddressed. The primary difficulty in this context is that the counterfactual outcome under the alternative treatment status is unobservable.In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for identifying the global average causal effect in regression discontinuity designs.Our approach integrates a latent variable and an additional data structure alongside the traditional regression discontinuity design setup. This enhanced framework allows us to extend the analysis beyond the threshold, providing a more comprehensive understanding of treatment effects.We develop asymptotically valid estimation and inference procedures under this framework, ensuring the robustness of our findings. To demonstrate the practical application of our method, we assess the causal effects of vitamin A supplementation on the severity of autism spectrum disorders in children.Our approach offers a significant advancement in the analysis of regression discontinuity designs, enabling researchers to estimate causal effects across a broader range of values and providing more actionable insights in policy and medical research.

### Disentangling Preference Representation and Text Generation for   Efficient Individual Preference Alignment
**Authors**: Jianfei Zhang, Jun Bai, Bei Li, Yanmeng Wang, Rumei Li, Chenghua Lin, Wenge Rong

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T09:58:31Z

**Summary**: Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with general human preferences has been proved crucial in improving the interaction quality between LLMs and human. However, human values are inherently diverse among different individuals, making it insufficient to align LLMs solely with general preferences. To address this, personalizing LLMs according to individual feedback emerges as a promising solution. Nonetheless, this approach presents challenges in terms of the efficiency of alignment algorithms. In this work, we introduce a flexible paradigm for individual preference alignment. Our method fundamentally improves efficiency by disentangling preference representation from text generation in LLMs. We validate our approach across multiple text generation tasks and demonstrate that it can produce aligned quality as well as or better than PEFT-based methods, while reducing additional training time for each new individual preference by $80\%$ to $90\%$ in comparison with them.

**Summary**: Understanding long, real-world videos requires modeling of long-range visual dependencies. To this end, we explore video-first architectures, building on the common paradigm of transferring large-scale, image--text models to video via shallow temporal fusion. However, we expose two limitations to the approach: (1) decreased spatial capabilities, likely due to poor video--language alignment in standard video datasets, and (2) higher memory consumption, bottlenecking the number of frames that can be processed. To mitigate the memory bottleneck, we systematically analyze the memory/accuracy trade-off of various efficient methods: factorized attention, parameter-efficient image-to-video adaptation, input masking, and multi-resolution patchification. Surprisingly, simply masking large portions of the video (up to 75%) during contrastive pre-training proves to be one of the most robust ways to scale encoders to videos up to 4.3 minutes at 1 FPS. Our simple approach for training long video-to-text models, which scales to 1B parameters, does not add new architectural complexity and is able to outperform the popular paradigm of using much larger LLMs as an information aggregator over segment-based information on benchmarks with long-range temporal dependencies (YouCook2, EgoSchema).

**Summary**: Language model alignment has become a critical step in training modern generative language models. The goal of alignment is to finetune a reference model such that the win rate of a sample from the aligned model over a sample from the reference model is high, subject to a KL divergence constraint. Today, we are increasingly using inference-time algorithms (e.g., Best-of-N, controlled decoding, tree search) to decode from language models rather than standard sampling. However, the alignment objective does not capture such inference-time decoding procedures. We show that the existing alignment framework is sub-optimal in view of such inference-time methods. We then modify the alignment objective and propose a framework for inference-aware alignment (IAPO). We prove that for any inference-time decoding algorithm, the optimal solution that optimizes the inference-time win rate of the aligned policy against the reference policy is the solution to the typical RLHF problem with a transformation of the reward. This motivates us to provide the KL-regularized calibrate-and-transform RL (CTRL) algorithm to solve this problem, which involves a reward calibration step and a KL-regularized reward maximization step with a transformation of the calibrated reward. We particularize our study to two important inference-time strategies: best-of-N sampling and best-of-N jailbreaking, where N responses are sampled from the model and the one with the highest or lowest reward is selected. We propose specific transformations for these strategies and demonstrate that our framework offers significant improvements over existing state-of-the-art methods for language model alignment. Empirically, we outperform baselines that are designed without taking inference-time decoding into consideration by 8-12% and 4-9% on inference-time win rates over the Anthropic helpfulness and harmlessness dialog benchmark datasets.

### Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Mobile Edge Computing via Large   Language Model
**Authors**: Runtao Ren, Yinyu Wu, Xuhui Zhang, Jinke Ren, Yanyan Shen, Shuqiang Wang, Kim-Fung Tsang

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T09:30:36Z

**Summary**: The rapid evolution of mobile edge computing (MEC) has introduced significant challenges in optimizing resource allocation in highly dynamic wireless communication systems, in which task offloading decisions should be made in real-time. However, existing resource allocation strategies cannot well adapt to the dynamic and heterogeneous characteristics of MEC systems, since they are short of scalability, context-awareness, and interpretability. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) method to improve the performance of MEC systems. Specifically, a latency minimization problem is first proposed to jointly optimize the data offloading ratio, transmit power allocation, and computing resource allocation. Then, an LLM-enabled information-retrieval mechanism is proposed to solve the problem efficiently. Extensive experiments across multi-user, multi-task, and highly dynamic offloading scenarios show that the proposed method consistently reduces latency compared to several DL-based approaches, achieving 57% improvement under varying user computing ability, 86% with different servers, 30% under distinct transmit powers, and 42% for varying data volumes. These results show the effectiveness of LLM-driven solutions to solve the resource allocation problems in MEC systems.

### Molar: Multimodal LLMs with Collaborative Filtering Alignment for   Enhanced Sequential Recommendation
**Authors**: Yucong Luo, Qitao Qin, Hao Zhang, Mingyue Cheng, Ruiran Yan, Kefan Wang, Jie Ouyang

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T09:24:34Z

**Summary**: Sequential recommendation (SR) systems have evolved significantly over the past decade, transitioning from traditional collaborative filtering to deep learning approaches and, more recently, to large language models (LLMs). While the adoption of LLMs has driven substantial advancements, these models inherently lack collaborative filtering information, relying primarily on textual content data neglecting other modalities and thus failing to achieve optimal recommendation performance. To address this limitation, we propose Molar, a Multimodal large language sequential recommendation framework that integrates multiple content modalities with ID information to capture collaborative signals effectively. Molar employs an MLLM to generate unified item representations from both textual and non-textual data, facilitating comprehensive multimodal modeling and enriching item embeddings. Additionally, it incorporates collaborative filtering signals through a post-alignment mechanism, which aligns user representations from content-based and ID-based models, ensuring precise personalization and robust performance. By seamlessly combining multimodal content with collaborative filtering insights, Molar captures both user interests and contextual semantics, leading to superior recommendation accuracy. Extensive experiments validate that Molar significantly outperforms traditional and LLM-based baselines, highlighting its strength in utilizing multimodal data and collaborative signals for sequential recommendation tasks.

**Authors**: Yucong Luo, Mingyue Cheng, Jie Ouyang, Xiaoyu Tao, Qi Liu

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T09:22:24Z

**Summary**: Text-to-image generative models excel in creating images from text but struggle with ensuring alignment and consistency between outputs and prompts. This paper introduces TextMatch, a novel framework that leverages multimodal optimization to address image-text discrepancies in text-to-image (T2I) generation and editing. TextMatch employs a scoring strategy powered by large language models (LLMs) and visual question-answering (VQA) models to evaluate semantic consistency between prompts and generated images. By integrating multimodal in-context learning and chain of thought reasoning, our method dynamically refines prompts through iterative optimization. This process ensures that the generated images better capture user intent of, resulting in higher fidelity and relevance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TextMatch significantly improves text-image consistency across multiple benchmarks, establishing a reliable framework for advancing the capabilities of text-to-image generative models. Our code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/TextMatch-F55C/.

### An In-depth Investigation of the Primordial Cluster Pair ASCC 19 and   ASCC 21
**Authors**: Qingshun Hu, Yuting Li, Mingfeng Qin, Chenglong Lv, Yang Pan, Yangping Luo, Shuo Ma

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T09:22:01Z

**Summary**: Utilizing \texttt{Gaia} data from the literature, we report a new young ($\sim$8.9~Myr) cluster pair, ASCC~19 and ASCC~21, located near the Orion star-forming complex. The clusters are separated by a 3D distance of ~27.00~$\pm$~7.51~pc. Both clusters share a common age (Log(age)~=~6.95~$\pm$~0.05), similar radial velocities ($R_{v}$~=~21.34~$\pm$~4.47~km s$^{-1}$ for ASCC~19 and $R_{v}$~=~20.05~$\pm$~3.86~km s$^{-1}$ for ASCC~21), and comparable metallicities ([Fe/H]~=~$-$0.14~$\pm$~0.25~dex for ASCC~19 and [Fe/H]~=~$-$0.12~$\pm$~0.04~dex for ASCC~21, from LAMOST-DR11). These similarities suggest that the clusters likely originated from the fragmentation of the same molecular cloud, forming a primordial cluster pair. Furthermore, the formation of the two clusters is attributed to the coalescence of multiple subclusters, as inferred from the distribution analysis between metal abundances and distances to clusters' centers. Neither cluster shows significant mass segregation. Their members with radial velocities exceeding 100~km s$^{-1}$ are young variables. Additionally, a tidal interaction between the clusters is observed. Comparisons of the Roche radius with tidal radii, and velocity difference with orbital velocity, suggest that the pair is an unbound system, that is, a double cluster. Finally, orbital motion simulations show that the clusters will not merge into a single system.

### LLM-as-an-Interviewer: Beyond Static Testing Through Dynamic LLM   Evaluation
**Authors**: Eunsu Kim, Juyoung Suk, Seungone Kim, Niklas Muennighoff, Dongkwan Kim, Alice Oh

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T09:11:50Z

**Summary**: We introduce LLM-as-an-Interviewer, a novel paradigm for evaluating large language models (LLMs). This approach leverages multi-turn interactions where the LLM interviewer actively provides feedback on responses and poses follow-up questions to the evaluated LLM. At the start of the interview, the LLM interviewer dynamically modifies datasets to generate initial questions, mitigating data contamination. We apply the LLM-as-an-Interviewer framework to evaluate six models on the MATH and DepthQA tasks. Our results show that the framework effectively provides insights into LLM performance, including the quality of initial responses, adaptability to feedback, and ability to address follow-up queries like clarification or additional knowledge requests. The framework also addresses key limitations of conventional methods like LLM-as-a-Judge, including verbosity bias and inconsistency across runs. Finally, we propose the Interview Report, which aggregates insights from the interview process, providing examples and a comprehensive analysis of the LLM's strengths and weaknesses. This report offers a detailed snapshot of the model's real-world applicability. The code for our framework is publicly available at https://github.com/interview-eval/.

### Synchronized Video Storytelling: Generating Video Narrations with   Structured Storyline
**Authors**: Dingyi Yang, Chunru Zhan, Ziheng Wang, Biao Wang, Tiezheng Ge, Bo Zheng, Qin Jin

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T09:02:53Z

**Summary**: Video storytelling is engaging multimedia content that utilizes video and its accompanying narration to attract the audience, where a key challenge is creating narrations for recorded visual scenes. Previous studies on dense video captioning and video story generation have made some progress. However, in practical applications, we typically require synchronized narrations for ongoing visual scenes. In this work, we introduce a new task of Synchronized Video Storytelling, which aims to generate synchronous and informative narrations for videos. These narrations, associated with each video clip, should relate to the visual content, integrate relevant knowledge, and have an appropriate word count corresponding to the clip's duration. Specifically, a structured storyline is beneficial to guide the generation process, ensuring coherence and integrity. To support the exploration of this task, we introduce a new benchmark dataset E-SyncVidStory with rich annotations. Since existing Multimodal LLMs are not effective in addressing this task in one-shot or few-shot settings, we propose a framework named VideoNarrator that can generate a storyline for input videos and simultaneously generate narrations with the guidance of the generated or predefined storyline. We further introduce a set of evaluation metrics to thoroughly assess the generation. Both automatic and human evaluations validate the effectiveness of our approach. Our dataset, codes, and evaluations will be released.

### MotionLCM: Real-time Controllable Motion Generation via Latent   Consistency Model
**Authors**: Wenxun Dai, Ling-Hao Chen, Jingbo Wang, Jinpeng Liu, Bo Dai, Yansong Tang

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T08:43:06Z

**Summary**: This work introduces MotionLCM, extending controllable motion generation to a real-time level. Existing methods for spatial-temporal control in text-conditioned motion generation suffer from significant runtime inefficiency. To address this issue, we first propose the motion latent consistency model (MotionLCM) for motion generation, building on the motion latent diffusion model. By adopting one-step (or few-step) inference, we further improve the runtime efficiency of the motion latent diffusion model for motion generation. To ensure effective controllability, we incorporate a motion ControlNet within the latent space of MotionLCM and enable explicit control signals (i.e., initial motions) in the vanilla motion space to further provide supervision for the training process. By employing these techniques, our approach can generate human motions with text and control signals in real-time. Experimental results demonstrate the remarkable generation and controlling capabilities of MotionLCM while maintaining real-time runtime efficiency.

### Privacy-Preserving Customer Support: A Framework for Secure and Scalable   Interactions
**Authors**: Anant Prakash Awasthi, Girdhar Gopal Agarwal, Chandraketu Singh, Rakshit Varma, Sanchit Sharma

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T08:29:09Z

**Summary**: The growing reliance on artificial intelligence (AI) in customer support has significantly improved operational efficiency and user experience. However, traditional machine learning (ML) approaches, which require extensive local training on sensitive datasets, pose substantial privacy risks and compliance challenges with regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Existing privacy-preserving techniques, such as anonymization, differential privacy, and federated learning, address some concerns but face limitations in utility, scalability, and complexity. This paper introduces the Privacy-Preserving Zero-Shot Learning (PP-ZSL) framework, a novel approach leveraging large language models (LLMs) in a zero-shot learning mode. Unlike conventional ML methods, PP-ZSL eliminates the need for local training on sensitive data by utilizing pre-trained LLMs to generate responses directly. The framework incorporates real-time data anonymization to redact or mask sensitive information, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for domain-specific query resolution, and robust post-processing to ensure compliance with regulatory standards. This combination reduces privacy risks, simplifies compliance, and enhances scalability and operational efficiency. Empirical analysis demonstrates that the PP-ZSL framework provides accurate, privacy-compliant responses while significantly lowering the costs and complexities of deploying AI-driven customer support systems. The study highlights potential applications across industries, including financial services, healthcare, e-commerce, legal support, telecommunications, and government services. By addressing the dual challenges of privacy and performance, this framework establishes a foundation for secure, efficient, and regulatory-compliant AI applications in customer interactions.

### Conditional Rank-Rank Regression
**Authors**: Victor Chernozhukov, IvÃ¡n FernÃ¡ndez-Val, Jonas Meier, Aico van Vuuren, Francis Vella

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T08:27:59Z

**Summary**: Rank-rank regression is commonly employed in economic research as a way of capturing the relationship between two economic variables. It frequently features in studies of intergenerational mobility as the resulting coefficient, capturing the rank correlation between the variables, is easy to interpret and measures overall persistence. However, in many applications it is common practice to include other covariates to account for differences in persistence levels between groups defined by the values of these covariates. In these instances the resulting coefficients can be difficult to interpret. We propose the conditional rank-rank regression, which uses conditional ranks instead of unconditional ranks, to measure average within-group income persistence. The difference between conditional and unconditional rank-rank regression coefficients can then be interpreted as a measure of between-group persistence. We develop a flexible estimation approach using distribution regression and establish a theoretical framework for large sample inference. An empirical study on intergenerational income mobility in Switzerland demonstrates the advantages of this approach. The study reveals stronger intergenerational persistence between fathers and sons compared to fathers and daughters, with the within-group persistence explaining 62% of the overall income persistence for sons and 52% for daughters. Smaller families and those with highly educated fathers exhibit greater persistence in economic status.

### Robust Bayesian inference with gapped LISA data using all-in-one   TDI-$\infty$
**Authors**: Niklas Houba, Jean-Baptiste Bayle, Michele Vallisneri

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T08:24:18Z

**Summary**: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), an ESA L-class mission, is designed to detect gravitational waves in the millihertz frequency band, with operations expected to begin in the next decade. LISA will enable studies of astrophysical phenomena such as massive black hole mergers, extreme mass ratio inspirals, and compact binary systems. A key challenge in analyzing LISA's data is the significant laser frequency noise, which must be suppressed using time-delay interferometry (TDI). Classical TDI mitigates this noise by algebraically combining phase measurements taken at different times and spacecraft. However, data gaps caused by instrumental issues or operational interruptions complicate the process. These gaps affect multiple TDI samples due to the time delays inherent to the algorithm, rendering surrounding measurements unusable for parameter inference. In this paper, we apply the recently proposed variant of TDI known as TDI-$\infty$ to astrophysical parameter inference, focusing on the challenge posed by data gaps. TDI-$\infty$ frames the LISA likelihood numerically in terms of raw measurements, marginalizing over laser phase noises under the assumption of infinite noise variance. Additionally, TDI-$\infty$ is set up to incorporate and cancel other noise sources beyond laser noise, including optical bench motion, clock noise, and modulation noise, establishing it as an all-in-one TDI solution. The method gracefully handles measurement interruptions, removing the need to explicitly address discontinuities during template matching. We integrate TDI-$\infty$ into a Bayesian framework, demonstrating its superior performance in scenarios involving gaps. Compared to classical TDI, the method preserves signal integrity more effectively and is particularly interesting for low-latency applications, where the limited amount of available data makes data gaps particularly disruptive.

### Frequency-Masked Embedding Inference: A Non-Contrastive Approach for   Time Series Representation Learning
**Authors**: En Fu, Yanyan Hu

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T08:12:17Z

**Summary**: Contrastive learning underpins most current self-supervised time series representation methods. The strategy for constructing positive and negative sample pairs significantly affects the final representation quality. However, due to the continuous nature of time series semantics, the modeling approach of contrastive learning struggles to accommodate the characteristics of time series data. This results in issues such as difficulties in constructing hard negative samples and the potential introduction of inappropriate biases during positive sample construction. Although some recent works have developed several scientific strategies for constructing positive and negative sample pairs with improved effectiveness, they remain constrained by the contrastive learning framework. To fundamentally overcome the limitations of contrastive learning, this paper introduces Frequency-masked Embedding Inference (FEI), a novel non-contrastive method that completely eliminates the need for positive and negative samples. The proposed FEI constructs 2 inference branches based on a prompting strategy: 1) Using frequency masking as prompts to infer the embedding representation of the target series with missing frequency bands in the embedding space, and 2) Using the target series as prompts to infer its frequency masking embedding. In this way, FEI enables continuous semantic relationship modeling for time series. Experiments on 8 widely used time series datasets for classification and regression tasks, using linear evaluation and end-to-end fine-tuning, show that FEI significantly outperforms existing contrastive-based methods in terms of generalization. This study provides new insights into self-supervised representation learning for time series. The code is available at https://github.com/USTBInnovationPark/Frequency-masked-Embedding-Inference.

### SecBench: A Comprehensive Multi-Dimensional Benchmarking Dataset for   LLMs in Cybersecurity
**Authors**: Pengfei Jing, Mengyun Tang, Xiaorong Shi, Xing Zheng, Sen Nie, Shi Wu, Yong Yang, Xiapu Luo

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T08:11:54Z

**Summary**: Evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for understanding their capabilities and limitations across various applications, including natural language processing and code generation. Existing benchmarks like MMLU, C-Eval, and HumanEval assess general LLM performance but lack focus on specific expert domains such as cybersecurity. Previous attempts to create cybersecurity datasets have faced limitations, including insufficient data volume and a reliance on multiple-choice questions (MCQs). To address these gaps, we propose SecBench, a multi-dimensional benchmarking dataset designed to evaluate LLMs in the cybersecurity domain. SecBench includes questions in various formats (MCQs and short-answer questions (SAQs)), at different capability levels (Knowledge Retention and Logical Reasoning), in multiple languages (Chinese and English), and across various sub-domains. The dataset was constructed by collecting high-quality data from open sources and organizing a Cybersecurity Question Design Contest, resulting in 44,823 MCQs and 3,087 SAQs. Particularly, we used the powerful while cost-effective LLMs to (1). label the data and (2). constructing a grading agent for automatic evaluation of SAQs.Benchmarking results on 13 SOTA LLMs demonstrate the usability of SecBench, which is arguably the largest and most comprehensive benchmark dataset for LLMs in cybersecurity. More information about SecBench can be found at our website, and the dataset can be accessed via the artifact link.

### LLM-based Translation Inference with Iterative Bilingual Understanding
**Authors**: Andong Chen, Kehai Chen, Yang Xiang, Xuefeng Bai, Muyun Yang, Yang Feng, Tiejun Zhao, Min zhang

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T07:57:10Z

**Summary**: The remarkable understanding and generation capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have greatly improved translation performance. However, incorrect understanding of the sentence to be translated can degrade translation quality. To address this issue, we proposed a novel Iterative Bilingual Understanding Translation (IBUT) method based on the cross-lingual capabilities of LLMs and the dual characteristics of translation tasks. The cross-lingual capability of LLMs enables the generation of contextual understanding for both the source and target languages separately. Furthermore, the dual characteristics allow IBUT to generate effective cross-lingual feedback, iteratively refining contextual understanding, thereby reducing errors and improving translation performance. Experimental results showed that the proposed IBUT outperforms several strong comparison methods, especially being generalized to multiple domains (e.g., news, commonsense, and cultural translation benchmarks).

### FreStega: A Plug-and-Play Method for Boosting Imperceptibility and   Capacity in Generative Linguistic Steganography for Real-World Scenarios
**Authors**: Kaiyi Pang

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T07:49:13Z

**Summary**: Linguistic steganography embeds secret information in seemingly innocent texts, safeguarding privacy in surveillance environments. Generative linguistic steganography leverages the probability distribution of language models (LMs) and applies steganographic algorithms to generate stego tokens, gaining attention with recent Large Language Model (LLM) advancements. To enhance security, researchers develop distribution-preserving stego algorithms to minimize the gap between stego sampling and LM sampling. However, the reliance on language model distributions, coupled with deviations from real-world cover texts, results in insufficient imperceptibility when facing steganalysis detectors in real-world scenarios. Moreover, LLM distributions tend to be more deterministic, resulting in reduced entropy and, consequently, lower embedding capacity. In this paper, we propose FreStega, a plug-and-play method to reconstruct the distribution of language models used for generative linguistic steganography. FreStega dynamically adjusts token probabilities from the language model at each step of stegotext auto-regressive generation, leveraging both sequential and spatial dimensions. In sequential adjustment, the temperature is dynamically adjusted based on instantaneous entropy, enhancing the diversity of stego texts and boosting embedding capacity. In the spatial dimension, the distribution is aligned with guidance from the target domain corpus, closely mimicking real cover text in the target domain. By reforming the distribution, FreStega enhances the imperceptibility of stego text in practical scenarios and improves steganographic capacity by 15.41\%, all without compromising the quality of the generated text. FreStega serves as a plug-and-play remedy to enhance the imperceptibility and embedding capacity of existing distribution-preserving steganography methods in real-world scenarios.

### Large Language Model Enabled Multi-Task Physical Layer Network
**Authors**: Tianyue Zheng, Linglong Dai

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T07:47:30Z

**Summary**: The recent advance of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is continuously reshaping the future 6G wireless communications. Recently, the development of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers a promising approach to effectively improve the performance and generalization for different physical layer tasks. However, most existing works finetune dedicated LLM networks for a single wireless communication task separately. Thus performing diverse physical layer tasks introduces extremely high training resources, memory usage, and deployment costs. To solve the problem, we propose a LLM-enabled multi-task physical layer network to unify multiple tasks with a single LLM. Specifically, we first propose a multi-task LLM framework, which finetunes LLM to perform multi-user precoding, signal detection and channel prediction simultaneously. Besides, multi-task instruction module, input encoders, as well as output decoders, are elaborately designed to distinguish multiple tasks and adapted the features of different formats of wireless data for the features of LLM. Numerical simulations are also displayed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Autoware.Flex: Human-Instructed Dynamically Reconfigurable Autonomous   Driving Systems
**Authors**: Ziwei Song, Mingsong Lv, Tianchi Ren, Chun Jason Xue, Jen-Ming Wu, Nan Guan

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T07:27:29Z

**Summary**: Existing Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS) independently make driving decisions, but they face two significant limitations. First, in complex scenarios, ADS may misinterpret the environment and make inappropriate driving decisions. Second, these systems are unable to incorporate human driving preferences in their decision-making processes. This paper proposes Autoware$.$Flex, a novel ADS system that incorporates human input into the driving process, allowing users to guide the ADS in making more appropriate decisions and ensuring their preferences are satisfied. Achieving this needs to address two key challenges: (1) translating human instructions, expressed in natural language, into a format the ADS can understand, and (2) ensuring these instructions are executed safely and consistently within the ADS' s decision-making framework. For the first challenge, we employ a Large Language Model (LLM) assisted by an ADS-specialized knowledge base to enhance domain-specific translation. For the second challenge, we design a validation mechanism to ensure that human instructions result in safe and consistent driving behavior. Experiments conducted on both simulators and a real-world autonomous vehicle demonstrate that Autoware$.$Flex effectively interprets human instructions and executes them safely.

### Large Language Models for Classical Chinese Poetry Translation:   Benchmarking, Evaluating, and Improving
**Authors**: Andong Chen, Lianzhang Lou, Kehai Chen, Xuefeng Bai, Yang Xiang, Muyun Yang, Tiejun Zhao, Min Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T07:26:14Z

**Summary**: Different from the traditional translation tasks, classical Chinese poetry translation requires both adequacy and fluency in translating culturally and historically significant content and linguistic poetic elegance. Large language models (LLMs) with impressive multilingual capabilities may bring a ray of hope to achieve this extreme translation demand. This paper first introduces a suitable benchmark (PoetMT) where each Chinese poetry has a recognized elegant translation. Meanwhile, we propose a new metric based on GPT-4 to evaluate the extent to which current LLMs can meet these demands. Our empirical evaluation reveals that the existing LLMs fall short in the challenging task. Hence, we propose a Retrieval-Augmented Machine Translation (RAT) method which incorporates knowledge related to classical poetry for advancing the translation of Chinese Poetry in LLMs. Experimental results show that RAT consistently outperforms all comparison methods regarding wildly used BLEU, COMET, BLEURT, our proposed metric, and human evaluation.

### ConTrans: Weak-to-Strong Alignment Engineering via Concept   Transplantation
**Authors**: Weilong Dong, Xinwei Wu, Renren Jin, Shaoyang Xu, Deyi Xiong

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T07:25:13Z

**Summary**: Ensuring large language models (LLM) behave consistently with human goals, values, and intentions is crucial for their safety but yet computationally expensive. To reduce the computational cost of alignment training of LLMs, especially for those with a huge number of parameters, and to reutilize learned value alignment, we propose ConTrans, a novel framework that enables weak-to-strong alignment transfer via concept transplantation. From the perspective of representation engineering, ConTrans refines concept vectors in value alignment from a source LLM (usually a weak yet aligned LLM). The refined concept vectors are then reformulated to adapt to the target LLM (usually a strong yet unaligned base LLM) via affine transformation. In the third step, ConTrans transplants the reformulated concept vectors into the residual stream of the target LLM. Experiments demonstrate the successful transplantation of a wide range of aligned concepts from 7B models to 13B and 70B models across multiple LLMs and LLM families. Remarkably, ConTrans even surpasses instruction-tuned models in terms of truthfulness. Experiment results validate the effectiveness of both inter-LLM-family and intra-LLM-family concept transplantation. Our work successfully demonstrates an alternative way to achieve weak-to-strong alignment generalization and control.

### Dynamic Importance Learning using Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) for   Nonlinear Dynamic Mapping
**Authors**: Vahid MohammadZadeh Eivaghi, Mahdi Aliyari Shoorehdeli

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T07:20:27Z

**Summary**: Understanding output variance is critical in modeling nonlinear dynamic systems, as it reflects the system's sensitivity to input variations and feature interactions. This work presents a methodology for dynamically determining relevance scores in black-box models while ensuring interpretability through an embedded decision module. This interpretable module, integrated into the first layer of the model, employs the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) and logistic regression to compute relevance scores, interpreted as the probabilities of input neurons being active based on their contribution to the output variance. The proposed method leverages a gradient-based framework to uncover the importance of variance-driven features, capturing both individual contributions and complex feature interactions. These relevance scores are applied through element-wise transformations of the inputs, enabling the black-box model to prioritize features dynamically based on their impact on system output. This approach effectively bridges interpretability with the intricate modeling of nonlinear dynamics and time-dependent interactions. Simulation results demonstrate the method's ability to infer feature interactions while achieving superior performance in feature relevance compared to existing techniques. The practical utility of this approach is showcased through its application to an industrial pH neutralization process, where critical system dynamics are uncovered.

### High-Sensitivity Vision-Based Tactile Sensing Enhanced by   Microstructures and Lightweight CNN
**Authors**: Mayue Shi, Yongqi Zhang, Xiaotong Guo, Eric M. Yeatman

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T07:03:54Z

**Summary**: Tactile sensing is critical in advanced interactive systems by emulating the human sense of touch to detect stimuli. Vision-based tactile sensors (VBTSs) are promising for their ability to provide rich information, robustness, adaptability, low cost, and multimodal capabilities. However, current technologies still have limitations in sensitivity, spatial resolution, and the high computational demands of deep learning-based image processing. This paper presents a comprehensive approach combining a novel sensor structure with micromachined structures and an efficient image processing method, and demonstrates that carefully engineered microstructures within the sensor hardware can significantly enhance sensitivity while reducing computational load. Unlike traditional designs with tracking markers, our sensor incorporates an interface surface with micromachined trenches, as an example of microstructures, which modulate light transmission and amplify the variation in response to applied force. By capturing variations in brightness, wire width, and cross pattern locations with a camera, the sensor accurately infers the contact location, the magnitude of displacement and applied force with a lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN). Theoretical and experimental results demonstrated that the microstructures significantly enhance sensitivity by amplifying the visual effects of shape distortion. The sensor system effectively detected forces below 10 mN, and achieved a millimetre-level single-point spatial resolution. Using a model with only one convolutional layer, a mean absolute error (MAE) below 0.05 mm have been achieved. Its soft sensor body ensures compatibility with soft robots and wearable electronics, while its immunity to electrical crosstalk and interference guarantees reliability in complex human-machine environments.

### Zero-Indexing Internet Search Augmented Generation for Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Guangxin He, Zonghong Dai, Jiangcheng Zhu, Binqiang Zhao, Qicheng Hu, Chenyue Li, You Peng, Chen Wang, Binhang Yuan

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T06:52:12Z

**Summary**: Retrieval augmented generation has emerged as an effective method to enhance large language model performance. This approach typically relies on an internal retrieval module that uses various indexing mechanisms to manage a static pre-processed corpus. However, such a paradigm often falls short when it is necessary to integrate the most up-to-date information that has not been updated into the corpus during generative inference time. In this paper, we explore an alternative approach that leverages standard search engine APIs to dynamically integrate the latest online information (without maintaining any index for any fixed corpus), thereby improving the quality of generated content. We design a collaborative LLM-based paradigm, where we include: (i) a parser-LLM that determines if the Internet augmented generation is demanded and extracts the search keywords if so with a single inference; (ii) a mixed ranking strategy that re-ranks the retrieved HTML files to eliminate bias introduced from the search engine API; and (iii) an extractor-LLM that can accurately and efficiently extract relevant information from the fresh content in each HTML file. We conduct extensive empirical studies to evaluate the performance of this Internet search augmented generation paradigm. The experimental results demonstrate that our method generates content with significantly improved quality. Our system has been successfully deployed in a production environment to serve 01.AI's generative inference requests.

**Summary**: GUIs have long been central to human-computer interaction, providing an intuitive and visually-driven way to access and interact with digital systems. The advent of LLMs, particularly multimodal models, has ushered in a new era of GUI automation. They have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in natural language understanding, code generation, and visual processing. This has paved the way for a new generation of LLM-brained GUI agents capable of interpreting complex GUI elements and autonomously executing actions based on natural language instructions. These agents represent a paradigm shift, enabling users to perform intricate, multi-step tasks through simple conversational commands. Their applications span across web navigation, mobile app interactions, and desktop automation, offering a transformative user experience that revolutionizes how individuals interact with software. This emerging field is rapidly advancing, with significant progress in both research and industry.   To provide a structured understanding of this trend, this paper presents a comprehensive survey of LLM-brained GUI agents, exploring their historical evolution, core components, and advanced techniques. We address research questions such as existing GUI agent frameworks, the collection and utilization of data for training specialized GUI agents, the development of large action models tailored for GUI tasks, and the evaluation metrics and benchmarks necessary to assess their effectiveness. Additionally, we examine emerging applications powered by these agents. Through a detailed analysis, this survey identifies key research gaps and outlines a roadmap for future advancements in the field.

### ALMA-IMF XVIII: The assembly of a star cluster: Dense N$_2$H$^+$ (1-0)   kinematics in the massive G351.77 protocluster
**Authors**: N. A. Sandoval-Garrido, A. M. Stutz, R. H. Ãlvarez-GutiÃ©rrez, R. GalvÃ¡n-Madrid, F. Motte, A. Ginsburg, N. Cunningham, S. Reyes-Reyes, E. Redaelli, M. Bonfand, J. Salinas, A. Koley, J. Braine, L. Bronfman, G. Busquet, T. Csengeri, J. Di Francesco, M. FernÃ¡ndez-LÃ³pez, P. Garcia, A. Gusdorf, H. -L. Liu, P. Sanhueza

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T05:27:32Z

**Summary**: ALMA-IMF observed 15 massive protoclusters capturing multiple spectral lines and the continuum emission. We focus on the G351.77 protocluster ($\sim$ 2500 M$_{\odot}$, estimated from single-dish continuum observations) located at 2 kpc. We trace the dense gas emission and kinematics with N$_2$H$^+$ (1-0) at $\sim$ 4 kau resolution. We estimate an N$_2$H$^+$ relative abundance $\sim (1.7 \pm 0.5) \times 10^{-10}$. We decompose the N$_2$H$^+$ emission into up to two velocity components, highlighting the kinematic complexity in the dense gas. By examining the position-velocity (PV) diagrams on small scales, we observe clear inflow signatures (V-shapes) associated with dense cores. The most prominent V-shape has a mass inflow rate of $\sim 9.8 \times 10^{-4}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ and a short timescale of $\sim$ 15.6 kyr. We also observe V-shapes without associated cores. This suggests both that cores or centers of accretion exist below the 1.3 mm detection limit, and that the V-shapes may be viable tracers of very early accretion and star formation on $\sim$ 4 kau scales. The large-scale PV diagram shows that the protocluster is separated into 2 principal velocity structures. Combined with smaller scale DCN and H$_2$CO emission, we propose a scenario of larger scale slow contraction with rotation in the center based on simple toy models. This scenario leads the suggestion of outside-in evolution of the protocluster as it collapses. The gas depletion times implied by the V-shapes are short ($\sim$ 0.3 Myr), requiring either very fast cluster formation, and/or continuous mass feeding of the protocluster. The latter is possible via the Mother Filament G351.77 is forming out of. The similarities in the properties of G351.77 and the recently published work in G353.41 indicate that many of the physical conditions inferred via the ALMA-IMF N$_2$H$^+$ observations may be generic to protoclusters.

### M$^3$oralBench: A MultiModal Moral Benchmark for LVLMs
**Authors**: Bei Yan, Jie Zhang, Zhiyuan Chen, Shiguang Shan, Xilin Chen

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T05:18:55Z

**Summary**: Recently, large foundation models, including large language models (LLMs) and large vision-language models (LVLMs), have become essential tools in critical fields such as law, finance, and healthcare. As these models increasingly integrate into our daily life, it is necessary to conduct moral evaluation to ensure that their outputs align with human values and remain within moral boundaries. Previous works primarily focus on LLMs, proposing moral datasets and benchmarks limited to text modality. However, given the rapid development of LVLMs, there is still a lack of multimodal moral evaluation methods. To bridge this gap, we introduce M$^3$oralBench, the first MultiModal Moral Benchmark for LVLMs. M$^3$oralBench expands the everyday moral scenarios in Moral Foundations Vignettes (MFVs) and employs the text-to-image diffusion model, SD3.0, to create corresponding scenario images. It conducts moral evaluation across six moral foundations of Moral Foundations Theory (MFT) and encompasses tasks in moral judgement, moral classification, and moral response, providing a comprehensive assessment of model performance in multimodal moral understanding and reasoning. Extensive experiments on 10 popular open-source and closed-source LVLMs demonstrate that M$^3$oralBench is a challenging benchmark, exposing notable moral limitations in current models. Our benchmark is publicly available.

### Combating Label Noise With A General Surrogate Model For Sample   Selection
**Authors**: Chao Liang, Linchao Zhu, Humphrey Shi, Yi Yang

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T05:13:23Z

**Summary**: Modern deep learning systems are data-hungry. Learning with web data is one of the feasible solutions, but will introduce label noise inevitably, which can hinder the performance of deep neural networks. Sample selection is an effective way to deal with label noise. The key is to separate clean samples based on some criterion. Previous methods pay more attention to the small loss criterion where small-loss samples are regarded as clean ones. Nevertheless, such a strategy relies on the learning dynamics of each data instance. Some noisy samples are still memorized due to frequently occurring corrupted learning patterns. To tackle this problem, a training-free surrogate model is preferred, freeing from the effect of memorization. In this work, we propose to leverage the vision-language surrogate model CLIP to filter noisy samples automatically. CLIP brings external knowledge to facilitate the selection of clean samples with its ability of text-image alignment. Furthermore, a margin adaptive loss is designed to regularize the selection bias introduced by CLIP, providing robustness to label noise. We validate the effectiveness of our proposed method on both real-world and synthetic noisy datasets. Our method achieves significant improvement without CLIP involved during the inference stage.

### Aligning the Objective of LLM-based Program Repair
**Authors**: Junjielong Xu, Ying Fu, Shin Hwei Tan, Pinjia He

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T05:08:00Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved decent results on automated program repair (APR). However, the next token prediction training objective of decoder-only LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) is misaligned with the masked span prediction objective of current infilling-style methods, which impedes LLMs from fully leveraging pre-trained knowledge for program repair. In addition, while some LLMs can locate and repair bugs in certain functions using the related artifacts (e.g., test cases), existing methods still depend on statement-level fault localization methods to provide a list of buggy hunks for repair. This restriction hinders LLMs from exploring potential patches beyond the given locations.   In this paper, we investigate a new approach to adapt LLMs to program repair. Our core insight is that LLM's APR capability can be greatly improved by simply aligning the output to their training objective and allowing them to refine the whole program without first identifying faulty statements. Based on this insight, we designed D4C, a straightforward prompting framework for APR. D4C can repair 180 bugs correctly in Defects4J, with each patch being sampled only 10 times. This surpasses the SOTA APR methods with perfect fault localization by 10% and reduces the patch sampling number by 90%. Our findings reveal that (1) objective alignment is crucial for fully exploiting LLM's pre-trained capability, and (2) replacing the traditional localize-buggy-hunks-then-repair workflow with direct debugging is more effective for LLM-based APR methods. Thus, we believe this paper introduces a new mindset for harnessing LLMs in APR.

### ChartAdapter: Large Vision-Language Model for Chart Summarization
**Authors**: Peixin Xu, Yujuan Ding, Wenqi Fan

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T05:07:34Z

**Summary**: Chart summarization, which focuses on extracting key information from charts and interpreting it in natural language, is crucial for generating and delivering insights through effective and accessible data analysis. Traditional methods for chart understanding and summarization often rely on multi-stage pipelines, which may produce suboptimal semantic alignment between visual and textual information. In comparison, recently developed LLM-based methods are more dependent on the capability of foundation images or languages, while ignoring the characteristics of chart data and its relevant challenges. To address these limitations, we propose ChartAdapter, a novel lightweight transformer module designed to bridge the gap between charts and textual summaries. ChartAdapter employs learnable query vectors to extract implicit semantics from chart data and incorporates a cross-modal alignment projector to enhance vision-to-language generative learning. By integrating ChartAdapter with an LLM, we enable end-to-end training and efficient chart summarization. To further enhance the training, we introduce a three-stage hierarchical training procedure and develop a large-scale dataset specifically curated for chart summarization, comprising 190,618 samples. Experimental results on the standard Chart-to-Text testing set demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods, including state-of-the-art models, in generating high-quality chart summaries. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of key components in ChartAdapter. This work highlights the potential of tailored LLM-based approaches to advance chart understanding and sets a strong foundation for future research in this area.

### SelectLLM: Query-Aware Efficient Selection Algorithm for Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Kaushal Kumar Maurya, KV Aditya Srivatsa, Ekaterina Kochmar

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T05:01:44Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have seen widespread adoption due to their remarkable performance across various applications, driving the accelerated development of a large number of diverse LLMs. However, these individual LLMs show limitations in generalization and performance on complex tasks due to inherent training biases, model size constraints, and the quality or diversity of pre-training datasets. A promising direction is to efficiently harness the diverse capabilities of LLMs to overcome these individual limitations. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel LLM selection algorithm called SelectLLM, which efficiently directs input queries to the most suitable subset of LLMs from a large pool, ensuring that the selected models collectively provide accurate responses. SelectLLM employs a multi-label classifier and policy based on the classifier's predictions and confidence scores in selecting an optimal, query-aware, and lightweight subset of LLMs. Our findings indicate that the proposed model outperforms existing ensemble-based baselines and achieves competitive performance with similarly sized top-performing LLMs while maintaining efficiency. Specifically, it achieves a huge reduction in inference latency on two challenging reasoning benchmarks: 13% on GSM8K and 70% on MMLU, compared to the top-performing baselines. Also, we establish a theoretical upper bound by an oracle with LLMs and explore in-depth linguistic analysis to understand the performance gap between Oracle and SelectLLM.

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T04:46:07Z

**Summary**: Literature research, vital for scientific work, faces the challenge of surging information volumes exceeding researchers' processing capabilities. We present an automated review generation method based on large language models (LLMs) to overcome efficiency bottlenecks and reduce cognitive load. Our statistically validated evaluation framework demonstrates that the generated reviews match or exceed manual quality, offering broad applicability across research fields without requiring users' domain knowledge. Applied to propane dehydrogenation (PDH) catalysts, our method swiftly analyzed 343 articles, averaging seconds per article per LLM account, producing comprehensive reviews spanning 35 topics, with extended analysis of 1041 articles providing insights into catalysts' properties. Through multi-layered quality control, we effectively mitigated LLMs' hallucinations, with expert verification confirming accuracy and citation integrity while demonstrating hallucination risks reduced to below 0.5\% with 95\% confidence. Released Windows application enables one-click review generation, enhancing research productivity and literature recommendation efficiency while setting the stage for broader scientific explorations.

### In-Context Learning with Iterative Demonstration Selection
**Authors**: Chengwei Qin, Aston Zhang, Chen Chen, Anirudh Dagar, Wenming Ye

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T04:27:05Z

**Summary**: Spurred by advancements in scale, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong few-shot learning ability via in-context learning (ICL). However, the performance of ICL has been shown to be highly sensitive to the selection of few-shot demonstrations. Selecting the most suitable examples as context remains an ongoing challenge and an open problem. Existing literature has highlighted the importance of selecting examples that are diverse or semantically similar to the test sample while ignoring the fact that the optimal selection dimension, i.e., diversity or similarity, is task-specific. Based on how the test sample is answered, we propose Iterative Demonstration Selection (IDS) to leverage the merits of both dimensions. Using zero-shot chain-of-thought reasoning (Zero-shot-CoT), IDS iteratively selects examples that are diverse but still strongly correlated with the test sample as ICL demonstrations. Specifically, IDS applies Zero-shot-CoT to the test sample before demonstration selection. The output reasoning path is then used to choose demonstrations that are prepended to the test sample for inference. The generated answer is followed by its corresponding reasoning path for extracting a new set of demonstrations in the next iteration. After several iterations, IDS adopts majority voting to obtain the final result. Through extensive experiments on tasks including reasoning, question answering, and topic classification, we demonstrate that IDS can consistently outperform existing ICL demonstration selection methods.

### Genetic-guided GFlowNets for Sample Efficient Molecular Optimization
**Authors**: Hyeonah Kim, Minsu Kim, Sanghyeok Choi, Jinkyoo Park

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T04:22:28Z

**Summary**: The challenge of discovering new molecules with desired properties is crucial in domains like drug discovery and material design. Recent advances in deep learning-based generative methods have shown promise but face the issue of sample efficiency due to the computational expense of evaluating the reward function. This paper proposes a novel algorithm for sample-efficient molecular optimization by distilling a powerful genetic algorithm into deep generative policy using GFlowNets training, the off-policy method for amortized inference. This approach enables the deep generative policy to learn from domain knowledge, which has been explicitly integrated into the genetic algorithm. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in the official molecular optimization benchmark, significantly outperforming previous methods. It also demonstrates effectiveness in designing inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 with substantially fewer reward calls.

### LLM-assisted Vector Similarity Search
**Authors**: Md Riyadh, Muqi Li, Felix Haryanto Lie, Jia Long Loh, Haotian Mi, Sayam Bohra

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T04:15:42Z

**Summary**: As data retrieval demands become increasingly complex, traditional search methods often fall short in addressing nuanced and conceptual queries. Vector similarity search has emerged as a promising technique for finding semantically similar information efficiently. However, its effectiveness diminishes when handling intricate queries with contextual nuances. This paper explores a hybrid approach combining vector similarity search with Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance search accuracy and relevance. The proposed two-step solution first employs vector similarity search to shortlist potential matches, followed by an LLM for context-aware ranking of the results. Experiments on structured datasets demonstrate that while vector similarity search alone performs well for straightforward queries, the LLM-assisted approach excels in processing complex queries involving constraints, negations, or conceptual requirements. By leveraging the natural language understanding capabilities of LLMs, this method improves the accuracy of search results for complex tasks without sacrificing efficiency. We also discuss real-world applications and propose directions for future research to refine and scale this technique for diverse datasets and use cases.

### Memorization Over Reasoning? Exposing and Mitigating Verbatim   Memorization in Large Language Models' Character Understanding Evaluation
**Authors**: Yuxuan Jiang, Francis Ferraro

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T04:09:29Z

**Summary**: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in character understanding tasks, such as analyzing the roles, personalities, and relationships of fictional characters. However, the extensive pre-training corpora used by LLMs raise concerns that they may rely on memorizing popular fictional works rather than genuinely understanding and reasoning about them. In this work, we argue that 'gist memory'-capturing essential meaning - should be the primary mechanism for character understanding tasks, as opposed to 'verbatim memory' - exact match of a string. We introduce a simple yet effective method to mitigate mechanized memorization in character understanding evaluations while preserving the essential implicit cues needed for comprehension and reasoning. Our approach reduces memorization-driven performance on popular fictional works from 96% accuracy to 72% and results in up to an 18% drop in accuracy across various character understanding tasks. These findings underscore the issue of data contamination in existing benchmarks, which often measure memorization rather than true character understanding.

### UBER: Uncertainty-Based Evolution with Large Language Models for   Automatic Heuristic Design
**Authors**: Zijie Chen, Zhanchao Zhou, Yu Lu, Renjun Xu, Lili Pan, Zhenzhong Lan

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T04:05:22Z

**Summary**: NP-hard problem-solving traditionally relies on heuristics, but manually crafting effective heuristics for complex problems remains challenging. While recent work like FunSearch has demonstrated that large language models (LLMs) can be leveraged for heuristic design in evolutionary algorithm (EA) frameworks, their potential is not fully realized due to its deficiency in exploitation and exploration. We present UBER (Uncertainty-Based Evolution for Refinement), a method that enhances LLM+EA methods for automatic heuristic design by integrating uncertainty on top of the FunSearch framework. UBER introduces two key innovations: an Uncertainty-Inclusive Evolution Process (UIEP) for adaptive exploration-exploitation balance, and a principled Uncertainty-Inclusive Island Reset (UIIS) strategy for maintaining population diversity. Through extensive experiments on challenging NP-complete problems, UBER demonstrates significant improvements over FunSearch. Our work provides a new direction for the synergy of LLMs and EA, advancing the field of automatic heuristic design.

### TAEN: A Model-Constrained Tikhonov Autoencoder Network for Forward and   Inverse Problems
**Authors**: Hai V. Nguyen, Tan Bui-Thanh, Clint Dawson

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T03:52:19Z

**Summary**: Efficient real-time solvers for forward and inverse problems are essential in engineering and science applications. Machine learning surrogate models have emerged as promising alternatives to traditional methods, offering substantially reduced computational time. Nevertheless, these models typically demand extensive training datasets to achieve robust generalization across diverse scenarios. While physics-based approaches can partially mitigate this data dependency and ensure physics-interpretable solutions, addressing scarce data regimes remains a challenge. Both purely data-driven and physics-based machine learning approaches demonstrate severe overfitting issues when trained with insufficient data. We propose a novel Tikhonov autoencoder model-constrained framework, called TAE, capable of learning both forward and inverse surrogate models using a single arbitrary observation sample. We develop comprehensive theoretical foundations including forward and inverse inference error bounds for the proposed approach for linear cases. For comparative analysis, we derive equivalent formulations for pure data-driven and model-constrained approach counterparts. At the heart of our approach is a data randomization strategy, which functions as a generative mechanism for exploring the training data space, enabling effective training of both forward and inverse surrogate models from a single observation, while regularizing the learning process. We validate our approach through extensive numerical experiments on two challenging inverse problems: 2D heat conductivity inversion and initial condition reconstruction for time-dependent 2D Navier-Stokes equations. Results demonstrate that TAE achieves accuracy comparable to traditional Tikhonov solvers and numerical forward solvers for both inverse and forward problems, respectively, while delivering orders of magnitude computational speedups.

### Align Attention Heads Before Merging Them: An Effective Way for   Converting MHA to GQA
**Authors**: Qingyun Jin, Xiaohui Song, Feng Zhou, Zengchang Qin

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T03:05:45Z

**Summary**: Large language models have been shown to perform well on a variety of natural language processing problems. However, as the model size and the input sequence's length increase, the rapid increase of KV Cache significantly slows down inference speed. Therefore GQA model, as an alternative to MHA model, has been widely introduced into LLMs. In this work, we propose a low-cost method for pruning MHA models into GQA models with any compression ratio of key-value heads. Our method is based on $\mathit{L_0}$ masks to gradually remove redundant parameters. In addition, we apply orthogonal transformations to attention heads without changing the model to increase similarity between attention heads before pruning training, in order to further improve performance of the model. Our method can be compatible with rotary position embedding (RoPE), which means the model after training can be fully adapted to the mainstream standard GQA framework. Experiments demonstrate that our strategy can compress up to 87.5% of key-value heads of the LLaMA2-7B model without too much performance degradation, just achieved through supervised fine-tuning.

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T03:00:30Z

**Summary**: Building on the foundations of language modeling in natural language processing, Next Token Prediction (NTP) has evolved into a versatile training objective for machine learning tasks across various modalities, achieving considerable success. As Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced to unify understanding and generation tasks within the textual modality, recent research has shown that tasks from different modalities can also be effectively encapsulated within the NTP framework, transforming the multimodal information into tokens and predict the next one given the context. This survey introduces a comprehensive taxonomy that unifies both understanding and generation within multimodal learning through the lens of NTP. The proposed taxonomy covers five key aspects: Multimodal tokenization, MMNTP model architectures, unified task representation, datasets \& evaluation, and open challenges. This new taxonomy aims to aid researchers in their exploration of multimodal intelligence.

### Enhancing Table Recognition with Vision LLMs: A Benchmark and   Neighbor-Guided Toolchain Reasoner

**Summary**: Pre-trained foundation models have recently significantly progressed in structured table understanding and reasoning. However, despite advancements in areas such as table semantic understanding and table question answering, recognizing the structure and content of unstructured tables using Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) remains under-explored. In this work, we address this research gap by employing VLLMs in a training-free reasoning paradigm. First, we design a benchmark with various hierarchical dimensions relevant to table recognition. Subsequently, we conduct in-depth evaluations using pre-trained VLLMs, finding that low-quality image input is a significant bottleneck in the recognition process. Drawing inspiration from these findings, we propose the Neighbor-Guided Toolchain Reasoner (NGTR) framework, which is characterized by integrating multiple lightweight models for low-level visual processing operations aimed at mitigating issues with low-quality input images. Specifically, we utilize a neighbor retrieval mechanism to guide the generation of multiple tool invocation plans, transferring tool selection experiences from similar neighbors to the given input, thereby facilitating suitable tool selection. Additionally, we introduce a reflection module to supervise the tool invocation process. Extensive experiments on public table recognition datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances the recognition capabilities of the vanilla VLLMs. We believe that the designed benchmark and the proposed NGTR framework could provide an alternative solution in table recognition.

### Large-scale moral machine experiment on large language models
**Authors**: Muhammad Shahrul Zaim bin Ahmad, Kazuhiro Takemoto

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T02:14:18Z

**Summary**: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their potential integration into autonomous driving systems necessitates understanding their moral decision-making capabilities. While our previous study examined four prominent LLMs using the Moral Machine experimental framework, the dynamic landscape of LLM development demands a more comprehensive analysis. Here, we evaluate moral judgments across 52 different LLMs, including multiple versions of proprietary models (GPT, Claude, Gemini) and open-source alternatives (Llama, Gemma), to assess their alignment with human moral preferences in autonomous driving scenarios. Using a conjoint analysis framework, we evaluated how closely LLM responses aligned with human preferences in ethical dilemmas and examined the effects of model size, updates, and architecture. Results showed that proprietary models and open-source models exceeding 10 billion parameters demonstrated relatively close alignment with human judgments, with a significant negative correlation between model size and distance from human judgments in open-source models. However, model updates did not consistently improve alignment with human preferences, and many LLMs showed excessive emphasis on specific ethical principles. These findings suggest that while increasing model size may naturally lead to more human-like moral judgments, practical implementation in autonomous driving systems requires careful consideration of the trade-off between judgment quality and computational efficiency. Our comprehensive analysis provides crucial insights for the ethical design of autonomous systems and highlights the importance of considering cultural contexts in AI moral decision-making.

 ### Distributed Mixture-of-Agents for Edge Inference with Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Purbesh Mitra, Priyanka Kaswan, Sennur Ulukus

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T18:59:06Z

**Summary**: Mixture-of-Agents (MoA) has recently been proposed as a method to enhance performance of large language models (LLMs), enabling multiple individual LLMs to work together for collaborative inference. This collaborative approach results in improved responses to user prompts compared to relying on a single LLM. In this paper, we consider such an MoA architecture in a distributed setting, where LLMs operate on individual edge devices, each uniquely associated with a user and equipped with its own distributed computing power. These devices exchange information using decentralized gossip algorithms, allowing different device nodes to talk without the supervision of a centralized server. In the considered setup, different users have their own LLM models to address user prompts. Additionally, the devices gossip either their own user-specific prompts or augmented prompts to generate more refined answers to certain queries. User prompts are temporarily stored in the device queues when their corresponding LLMs are busy. Given the memory limitations of edge devices, it is crucial to ensure that the average queue sizes in the system remain bounded. In this paper, we address this by theoretically calculating the queuing stability conditions for the device queues under reasonable assumptions, which we validate experimentally as well. Further, we demonstrate through experiments, leveraging open-source LLMs for the implementation of distributed MoA, that certain MoA configurations produce higher-quality responses compared to others, as evaluated on AlpacaEval 2.0 benchmark. The implementation is available at: https://github.com/purbeshmitra/distributed_moa.

### HumanEval Pro and MBPP Pro: Evaluating Large Language Models on   Self-invoking Code Generation
**Authors**: Zhaojian Yu, Yilun Zhao, Arman Cohan, Xiao-Ping Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T18:58:58Z

**Summary**: We introduce self-invoking code generation, a new task designed to evaluate the progressive reasoning and problem-solving capabilities of LLMs. In this task, models are presented with a base problem and a related, more complex problem. They must solve the base problem and then utilize its solution to address the more complex one. This work features three key contributions. First, we propose a general recipe for generating more challenging versions of existing benchmarks, resulting in three new benchmarks: HumanEval Pro, MBPP Pro, and BigCodeBench-Lite Pro, specifically designed to assess LLMs on self-invoking code generation. Second, from the analysis of experimental results over twenty LLMs on our benchmarks, we have two important observations: (i) Most LLMs excel in traditional code generation benchmarks like HumanEval and MBPP, but their performance declines on self-invoking tasks. For example, o1-mini achieves 96.2% pass@1 on HumanEval but only 76.2% on HumanEval Pro. (ii) On self-invoking code generation task, the instruction-tuned models demonstrate only marginal improvements compared to the base models. Third, we disclose the types of failure modes that exist in our evaluation results. All these results underscore the need for further advancements in self-invoking code generation tasks and provide a new direction for future research on enhancing LLMs' code reasoning capabilities.

**Authors**: Xingyu Chen, Jiahao Xu, Tian Liang, Zhiwei He, Jianhui Pang, Dian Yu, Linfeng Song, Qiuzhi Liu, Mengfei Zhou, Zhuosheng Zhang, Rui Wang, Zhaopeng Tu, Haitao Mi, Dong Yu

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T18:55:12Z

**Summary**: The remarkable performance of models like the OpenAI o1 can be attributed to their ability to emulate human-like long-time thinking during inference. These models employ extended chain-of-thought (CoT) processes, exploring multiple strategies to enhance problem-solving capabilities. However, a critical question remains: How to intelligently and efficiently scale computational resources during testing. This paper presents the first comprehensive study on the prevalent issue of overthinking in these models, where excessive computational resources are allocated for simple problems with minimal benefit. We introduce novel efficiency metrics from both outcome and process perspectives to evaluate the rational use of computational resources by o1-like models. Using a self-training paradigm, we propose strategies to mitigate overthinking, streamlining reasoning processes without compromising accuracy. Experimental results show that our approach successfully reduces computational overhead while preserving model performance across a range of testsets with varying difficulty levels, such as GSM8K, MATH500, GPQA, and AIME.

### Open-Source 5G Core Platforms: A Low-Cost Solution and Performance   Evaluation
**Authors**: Maria Barbosa, Marcelo Silva, Ednelson Cavalcanti, Kelvin Dias

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T18:41:43Z

**Summary**: An essential component for the Fifth Generation of Mobile Networks deployments is the 5G Core (5GC), which bridges the 5G Radio Access Network (RAN) to the rest of the Internet. Some open-source platforms for the 5GC have emerged and been deployed in Common Off-the-Shelf (COTS)-based setups. Despite these open-source 5GC initiatives following the 3GPP specifications, they differ in implementing some features and their stages in the timeline of 3GPP releases. Besides that, they may yield different performance to metrics related to the data and control planes. This article reviews the major open-source 5GC platforms and evaluates their performance in a 5G Standalone (SA) COTS-based testbed. The results indicate that Open5GS provides the best latencies for control plane procedures, OpenAirInterface offers the highest data rates, and Free5GC has the lowest resource consumption.

**Summary**: Solving complex real-world tasks requires cycles of actions and observations. This is particularly true in science, where tasks require many cycles of analysis, tool use, and experimentation. Language agents are promising for automating intellectual tasks in science because they can interact with tools via natural language or code. Yet their flexibility creates conceptual and practical challenges for software implementations, since agents may comprise non-standard components such as internal reasoning, planning, tool usage, as well as the inherent stochasticity of temperature-sampled language models. Here, we introduce Aviary, an extensible gymnasium for language agents. We formalize agents as policies solving language-grounded partially observable Markov decision processes, which we term language decision processes. We then implement five environments, including three challenging scientific environments: (1) manipulating DNA constructs for molecular cloning, (2) answering research questions by accessing scientific literature, and (3) engineering protein stability. These environments were selected for their focus on multi-step reasoning and their relevance to contemporary biology research. Finally, with online training and scaling inference-time compute, we show that language agents backed by open-source, non-frontier LLMs can match and exceed both frontier LLM agents and human experts on multiple tasks at up to 100x lower inference cost.

### Order Matters in Hallucination: Reasoning Order as Benchmark and   Reflexive Prompting for Large-Language-Models
**Authors**: Zikai Xie

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T18:21:08Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have generated significant attention since their inception, finding applications across various academic and industrial domains. However, these models often suffer from the "hallucination problem", where outputs, though grammatically and logically coherent, lack factual accuracy or are entirely fabricated. A particularly troubling issue discovered and widely discussed recently is the numerical comparison error where multiple LLMs incorrectly infer that "9.11$>$9.9". We discovered that the order in which LLMs generate answers and reasoning impacts their consistency. Specifically, results vary significantly when an LLM generates an answer first and then provides the reasoning versus generating the reasoning process first and then the conclusion. Inspired by this, we propose a new benchmark method for assessing LLM consistency: comparing responses generated through these two different approaches. This benchmark effectively identifies instances where LLMs fabricate answers and subsequently generate justifications. Furthermore, we introduce a novel and straightforward prompt strategy designed to mitigate this issue. Experimental results demonstrate that this strategy improves performance across various LLMs compared to direct questioning. This work not only sheds light on a critical flaw in LLMs but also offers a practical solution to enhance their reliability.

### Facilitating large language model Russian adaptation with Learned   Embedding Propagation
**Authors**: Mikhail Tikhomirov, Daniil Chernyshev

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T18:15:45Z

**Summary**: Rapid advancements of large language model (LLM) technologies led to the introduction of powerful open-source instruction-tuned LLMs that have the same text generation quality as the state-of-the-art counterparts such as GPT-4. While the emergence of such models accelerates the adoption of LLM technologies in sensitive-information environments the authors of such models don not disclose the training data necessary for replication of the results thus making the achievements model-exclusive. Since those open-source models are also multilingual this in turn reduces the benefits of training a language specific LLMs as improved inference computation efficiency becomes the only guaranteed advantage of such costly procedure. More cost-efficient options such as vocabulary extension and subsequent continued pre-training are also inhibited by the lack of access to high-quality instruction-tuning data since it is the major factor behind the resulting LLM task-solving capabilities. To address the limitations and cut the costs of the language adaptation pipeline we propose Learned Embedding Propagation (LEP). Unlike existing approaches our method has lower training data size requirements due to minimal impact on existing LLM knowledge which we reinforce using novel ad-hoc embedding propagation procedure that allows to skip the instruction-tuning step and instead implant the new language knowledge directly into any existing instruct-tuned variant. We evaluated four Russian vocabulary adaptations for LLaMa-3-8B and Mistral-7B, showing that LEP is competitive with traditional instruction-tuning methods, achieving performance comparable to OpenChat 3.5 and LLaMa-3-8B-Instruct, with further improvements via self-calibration and continued tuning enhancing task-solving capabilities.

### ExpShield: Safeguarding Web Text from Unauthorized Crawling and Language   Modeling Exploitation
**Authors**: Ruixuan Liu, Toan Tran, Tianhao Wang, Hongsheng Hu, Shuo Wang, Li Xiong

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T17:52:02Z

**Summary**: As large language models (LLMs) increasingly depend on web-scraped datasets, concerns over unauthorized use of copyrighted or personal content for training have intensified. Despite regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), data owners still have limited control over the use of their content in model training. To address this, we propose ExpShield, a proactive self-guard mechanism that empowers content owners to embed invisible perturbations into their text, limiting data misuse in LLMs training without affecting readability. This preemptive approach enables data owners to protect sensitive content directly, without relying on a third-party to perform defense. Starting from the random perturbation, we demonstrate the rationale for using perturbation to conceal protected content. We further enhance the efficiency by identifying memorization triggers and creating pitfalls to diverge the model memorization in a more focused way. To validate our defense's effectiveness, we propose a novel metric of instance exploitation which captures the individual risk raised by model training. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach as the MIA AUC decreases from 0.95 to 0.55, and instance exploitation approaches zero. This suggests that the individual risk does not increase after training, underscoring the significance of proactive defenses in protecting copyrighted data.

### Exploring and Controlling Diversity in LLM-Agent Conversation
**Authors**: KuanChao Chu, Yi-Pei Chen, Hideki Nakayama

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T17:25:58Z

**Summary**: Diversity is a critical aspect of multi-agent communication. In this paper, we focus on controlling and exploring diversity in the context of open-domain multi-agent conversations, particularly for world simulation applications. We propose Adaptive Prompt Pruning (APP), a novel method that dynamically adjusts the content of the utterance generation prompt to control diversity using a single parameter, lambda. Through extensive experiments, we show that APP effectively controls the output diversity across models and datasets, with pruning more information leading to more diverse output. We comprehensively analyze the relationship between prompt content and conversational diversity. Our findings reveal that information from all components of the prompt generally constrains the diversity of the output, with the Memory block exerting the most significant influence. APP is compatible with established techniques like temperature sampling and top-p sampling, providing a versatile tool for diversity management. To address the trade-offs of increased diversity, such as inconsistencies with omitted information, we incorporate a post-generation correction step, which effectively balances diversity enhancement with output consistency. Additionally, we examine how prompt structure, including component order and length, impacts diversity. This study addresses key questions surrounding diversity in multi-agent world simulation, offering insights into its control, influencing factors, and associated trade-offs. Our contributions lay the foundation for systematically engineering diversity in LLM-based multi-agent collaborations, advancing their effectiveness in real-world applications.

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T16:57:05Z

**Summary**: We introduce Vinci, a real-time embodied smart assistant built upon an egocentric vision-language model. Designed for deployment on portable devices such as smartphones and wearable cameras, Vinci operates in an "always on" mode, continuously observing the environment to deliver seamless interaction and assistance. Users can wake up the system and engage in natural conversations to ask questions or seek assistance, with responses delivered through audio for hands-free convenience. With its ability to process long video streams in real-time, Vinci can answer user queries about current observations and historical context while also providing task planning based on past interactions. To further enhance usability, Vinci integrates a video generation module that creates step-by-step visual demonstrations for tasks that require detailed guidance. We hope that Vinci can establish a robust framework for portable, real-time egocentric AI systems, empowering users with contextual and actionable insights. We release the complete implementation for the development of the device in conjunction with a demo web platform to test uploaded videos at https://github.com/OpenGVLab/vinci.

### LLM Distillation for Efficient Few-Shot Multiple Choice Question   Answering
**Authors**: Patrick Sutanto, Joan Santoso, Esther Irawati Setiawan, Aji Prasetya Wibawa

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T16:45:50Z

**Summary**: Multiple Choice Question Answering (MCQA) is an important problem with numerous real-world applications, such as medicine, law, and education. The high cost of building MCQA datasets makes few-shot learning pivotal in this domain. While Large Language Models (LLMs) can enable few-shot learning, their direct application in real-world scenarios is often hindered by their high computational cost. To address this challenge, we propose a simple yet effective approach that uses LLMs for data generation and scoring. Our approach utilizes LLMs to create MCQA data which contains questions and choices, and to assign probability scores to the generated choices. We then use the generated data and LLM-assigned scores to finetune a smaller and more efficient encoder-only model, DeBERTa-v3-base by leveraging distillation loss. Extensive experiments on the Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) benchmark demonstrate that our method improves accuracy from 28.9% to 39.3%, representing a gain of over 10% compared to a baseline finetuned directly on 5-shot examples. This shows the effectiveness of LLM-driven data generation and knowledge distillation for few-shot MCQA.

### Efficient Multi-Task Inferencing with a Shared Backbone and Lightweight   Task-Specific Adapters for Automatic Scoring
**Authors**: Ehsan Latif, Xiaoming Zhai

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T16:34:11Z

**Summary**: The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in education requires scalable and efficient frameworks that balance performance, adaptability, and cost. This paper addresses these needs by proposing a shared backbone model architecture enhanced with lightweight LoRA adapters for task-specific fine-tuning, targeting the automated scoring of student responses across 27 mutually exclusive tasks. By achieving competitive performance (average QWK of 0.848 compared to 0.888 for fully fine-tuned models) while reducing GPU memory consumption by 60% and inference latency by 40%, the framework demonstrates significant efficiency gains. This approach aligns with the workshops' focus on improving language models for educational tasks, creating responsible innovations for cost-sensitive deployment, and supporting educators by streamlining assessment workflows. The findings underscore the potential of scalable AI to enhance learning outcomes while maintaining fairness and transparency in automated scoring systems.

### DRT-o1: Optimized Deep Reasoning Translation via Long Chain-of-Thought
**Authors**: Jiaan Wang, Fandong Meng, Yunlong Liang, Jie Zhou

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T16:29:36Z

**Summary**: Recently, O1-like models have emerged as representative examples, illustrating the effectiveness of long chain-of-thought (CoT) in reasoning tasks such as math and coding tasks. In this paper, we introduce DRT-o1, an attempt to bring the success of long CoT to neural machine translation (MT). Specifically, in view of the literature books that might involve similes and metaphors, translating these texts to a target language is very difficult in practice due to cultural differences. In such cases, literal translation often fails to convey the intended meaning effectively. Even for professional human translators, considerable thought must be given to preserving semantics throughout the translation process. To simulate LLMs' long thought ability in MT, we first mine sentences containing similes or metaphors from existing literature books, and then develop a multi-agent framework to translate these sentences via long thought. In the multi-agent framework, a translator is used to iteratively translate the source sentence under the suggestions provided by an advisor. To ensure the effectiveness of the long thoughts, an evaluator is also employed to quantify the translation in each round. In this way, we collect tens of thousands of long-thought MT data, which is used to train our DRT-o1. Using Qwen2.5 and LLama-3.1 as the backbones, DRT-o1 models can learn the thought process during machine translation, and outperform vanilla LLMs as well as existing O1-like LLMs, showing their effectiveness The project is available at https://github.com/krystalan/DRT-o1

### Towards Effective Discrimination Testing for Generative AI
**Authors**: Thomas P. Zollo, Nikita Rajaneesh, Richard Zemel, Talia B. Gillis, Emily Black

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T16:09:33Z

**Summary**: Generative AI (GenAI) models present new challenges in regulating against discriminatory behavior. In this paper, we argue that GenAI fairness research still has not met these challenges; instead, a significant gap remains between existing bias assessment methods and regulatory goals. This leads to ineffective regulation that can allow deployment of reportedly fair, yet actually discriminatory, GenAI systems. Towards remedying this problem, we connect the legal and technical literature around GenAI bias evaluation and identify areas of misalignment. Through four case studies, we demonstrate how this misalignment between fairness testing techniques and regulatory goals can result in discriminatory outcomes in real-world deployments, especially in adaptive or complex environments. We offer practical recommendations for improving discrimination testing to better align with regulatory goals and enhance the reliability of fairness assessments in future deployments.

### Toward Intelligent and Secure Cloud: Large Language Model Empowered   Proactive Defense
**Authors**: Yuyang Zhou, Guang Cheng, Kang Du, Zihan Chen

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T16:09:28Z

**Summary**: The rapid evolution of cloud computing technologies and the increasing number of cloud applications have provided a large number of benefits in daily lives. However, the diversity and complexity of different components pose a significant challenge to cloud security, especially when dealing with sophisticated and advanced cyberattacks. Recent advancements in generative foundation models (GFMs), particularly in the large language models (LLMs), offer promising solutions for security intelligence. By exploiting the powerful abilities in language understanding, data analysis, task inference, action planning, and code generation, we present LLM-PD, a novel proactive defense architecture that defeats various threats in a proactive manner. LLM-PD can efficiently make a decision through comprehensive data analysis and sequential reasoning, as well as dynamically creating and deploying actionable defense mechanisms on the target cloud. Furthermore, it can flexibly self-evolve based on experience learned from previous interactions and adapt to new attack scenarios without additional training. The experimental results demonstrate its remarkable ability in terms of defense effectiveness and efficiency, particularly highlighting an outstanding success rate when compared with other existing methods.

### TangoFlux: Super Fast and Faithful Text to Audio Generation with Flow   Matching and Clap-Ranked Preference Optimization
**Authors**: Chia-Yu Hung, Navonil Majumder, Zhifeng Kong, Ambuj Mehrish, Rafael Valle, Bryan Catanzaro, Soujanya Poria

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T16:02:44Z

**Summary**: We introduce TangoFlux, an efficient Text-to-Audio (TTA) generative model with 515M parameters, capable of generating up to 30 seconds of 44.1kHz audio in just 3.7 seconds on a single A40 GPU. A key challenge in aligning TTA models lies in the difficulty of creating preference pairs, as TTA lacks structured mechanisms like verifiable rewards or gold-standard answers available for Large Language Models (LLMs). To address this, we propose CLAP-Ranked Preference Optimization (CRPO), a novel framework that iteratively generates and optimizes preference data to enhance TTA alignment. We demonstrate that the audio preference dataset generated using CRPO outperforms existing alternatives. With this framework, TangoFlux achieves state-of-the-art performance across both objective and subjective benchmarks. We open source all code and models to support further research in TTA generation.

### CodeIP: A Grammar-Guided Multi-Bit Watermark for Large Language Models   of Code
**Authors**: Batu Guan, Yao Wan, Zhangqian Bi, Zheng Wang, Hongyu Zhang, Pan Zhou, Lichao Sun

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T15:59:18Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in code generation. It now becomes crucial to identify whether the code is AI-generated and to determine the specific model used, particularly for purposes such as protecting Intellectual Property (IP) in industry and preventing cheating in programming exercises. To this end, several attempts have been made to insert watermarks into machine-generated code. However, existing approaches are limited to inserting only a single bit of information. In this paper, we introduce CodeIP, a novel multi-bit watermarking technique that inserts additional information to preserve crucial provenance details, such as the vendor ID of an LLM, thereby safeguarding the IPs of LLMs in code generation. Furthermore, to ensure the syntactical correctness of the generated code, we propose constraining the sampling process for predicting the next token by training a type predictor. Experiments conducted on a real-world dataset across five programming languages demonstrate the effectiveness of CodeIP in watermarking LLMs for code generation while maintaining the syntactical correctness of code.

### Plancraft: an evaluation dataset for planning with LLM agents
**Authors**: Gautier Dagan, Frank Keller, Alex Lascarides

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T15:58:41Z

**Summary**: We present Plancraft, a multi-modal evaluation dataset for LLM agents. Plancraft has both a text-only and multi-modal interface, based on the Minecraft crafting GUI. We include the Minecraft Wiki to evaluate tool use and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), as well as an oracle planner and oracle RAG information extractor, to ablate the different components of a modern agent architecture. To evaluate decision-making, Plancraft also includes a subset of examples that are intentionally unsolvable, providing a realistic challenge that requires the agent not only to complete tasks but also to decide whether they are solvable at all. We benchmark both open-source and closed-source LLMs and strategies on our task and compare their performance to a handcrafted planner. We find that LLMs and VLMs struggle with the planning problems that Plancraft introduces, and we offer suggestions on how to improve their capabilities.

### Automated Robustness Testing for LLM-based NLP Software
**Authors**: Mingxuan Xiao, Yan Xiao, Shunhui Ji, Hanbo Cai, Lei Xue, Pengcheng Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T15:33:34Z

**Summary**: Benefiting from the advancements in LLMs, NLP software has undergone rapid development. Such software is widely employed in various safety-critical tasks, such as financial sentiment analysis, toxic content moderation, and log generation. To our knowledge, there are no known automated robustness testing methods specifically designed for LLM-based NLP software. Given the complexity of LLMs and the unpredictability of real-world inputs (including prompts and examples), it is essential to examine the robustness of overall inputs to ensure the safety of such software.   To this end, this paper introduces the first AutOmated Robustness Testing frAmework, AORTA, which reconceptualizes the testing process into a combinatorial optimization problem. Existing testing methods designed for DNN-based software can be applied to LLM-based software by AORTA, but their effectiveness is limited. To address this, we propose a novel testing method for LLM-based software within AORTA called Adaptive Beam Search. ABS is tailored for the expansive feature space of LLMs and improves testing effectiveness through an adaptive beam width and the capability for backtracking.   We successfully embed 18 test methods in the designed framework AORTA and compared the test validity of ABS with three datasets and five threat models. ABS facilitates a more comprehensive and accurate robustness assessment before software deployment, with an average test success rate of 86.138%. Compared to the currently best-performing baseline PWWS, ABS significantly reduces the computational overhead by up to 3441.895 seconds per successful test case and decreases the number of queries by 218.762 times on average. Furthermore, test cases generated by ABS exhibit greater naturalness and transferability.

**Authors**: Mahir Labib Dihan, Mohammed Eunus Ali, Md Rizwan Parvez

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T15:33:19Z

**Summary**: Mapping and navigation services like Google Maps, Apple Maps, Openstreet Maps, are essential for accessing various location-based data, yet they often struggle to handle natural language geospatial queries. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in question answering (QA), but creating reliable geospatial QA datasets from map services remains challenging. We introduce MapQaTor, a web application that streamlines the creation of reproducible, traceable map-based QA datasets. With its plug-and-play architecture, MapQaTor enables seamless integration with any maps API, allowing users to gather and visualize data from diverse sources with minimal setup. By caching API responses, the platform ensures consistent ground truth, enhancing the reliability of the data even as real-world information evolves. MapQaTor centralizes data retrieval, annotation, and visualization within a single platform, offering a unique opportunity to evaluate the current state of LLM-based geospatial reasoning while advancing their capabilities for improved geospatial understanding. Evaluation metrics show that, MapQaTor speeds up the annotation process by at least 30 times compared to manual methods, underscoring its potential for developing geospatial resources, such as complex map reasoning datasets.

### From Interests to Insights: An LLM Approach to Course Recommendations   Using Natural Language Queries
**Authors**: Hugh Van Deventer, Mark Mills, August Evrard

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T15:30:23Z

**Summary**: Most universities in the United States encourage their students to explore academic areas before declaring a major and to acquire academic breadth by satisfying a variety of requirements. Each term, students must choose among many thousands of offerings, spanning dozens of subject areas, a handful of courses to take. The curricular environment is also dynamic, and poor communication and search functions on campus can limit a student's ability to discover new courses of interest. To support both students and their advisers in such a setting, we explore a novel Large Language Model (LLM) course recommendation system that applies a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) method to the corpus of course descriptions. The system first generates an 'ideal' course description based on the user's query. This description is converted into a search vector using embeddings, which is then used to find actual courses with similar content by comparing embedding similarities. We describe the method and assess the quality and fairness of some example prompts. Steps to deploy a pilot system on campus are discussed.

### Verbosity-Aware Rationale Reduction: Effective Reduction of Redundant   Rationale via Principled Criteria
**Authors**: Joonwon Jang, Jaehee Kim, Wonbin Kweon, Hwanjo Yu

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T15:15:08Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on generating extensive intermediate reasoning units (e.g., tokens, sentences) to enhance final answer quality across a wide range of complex tasks. While generating multiple reasoning paths or iteratively refining rationales proves effective for improving performance, these approaches inevitably result in significantly higher inference costs. In this work, we propose a novel sentence-level rationale reduction training framework that leverages likelihood-based criteria, verbosity, to identify and remove redundant reasoning sentences. Unlike previous approaches that utilize token-level reduction, our sentence-level reduction framework maintains model performance while reducing generation length. This preserves the original reasoning abilities of LLMs and achieves an average 17.15% reduction in generation costs across various models and tasks.

### Plug-and-Play Training Framework for Preference Optimization
**Authors**: Jingyuan Ma, Rui Li, Zheng Li, Lei Sha, Zhifang Sui

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T15:01:48Z

**Summary**: Recently, preference optimization methods such as DPO have significantly enhanced large language models (LLMs) in wide tasks including dialogue and question-answering. However, current methods fail to account for the varying difficulty levels of training samples during preference optimization, leading to mediocre performance in tasks with high accuracy requirements, particularly in mathematical reasoning. To address this limitation, we propose a novel training framework, which employs multiple sampling to analyze output distributions, assign different weights to samples, and incorporate these weights into the preference optimization process. This plug-and-play approach enables LLMs to prioritize challenging examples during training, improving learning efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework integrates seamlessly with various preference optimization methods and achieves consistent improvements in mathematical reasoning tasks.

### KARPA: A Training-free Method of Adapting Knowledge Graph as References   for Large Language Model's Reasoning Path Aggregation
**Authors**: Siyuan Fang, Kaijing Ma, Tianyu Zheng, Xinrun Du, Ningxuan Lu, Ge Zhang, Qingkun Tang

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T14:58:46Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional performance across a variety of tasks, yet they are often affected by hallucinations and the timeliness of knowledge. Leveraging knowledge graphs (KGs) as external knowledge sources has emerged as a viable solution, but existing methods for LLM-based knowledge graph question answering (KGQA) are often limited by step-by-step decision-making on KGs, restricting the global planning and reasoning capabilities of LLMs, or they require fine-tuning or pre-training on specific KGs. To address these challenges, we propose Knowledge graph Assisted Reasoning Path Aggregation (KARPA), a novel framework that harnesses the global planning abilities of LLMs for efficient and accurate KG reasoning. KARPA operates in three steps: pre-planning relation paths using the LLM's global planning capabilities, matching semantically relevant paths via an embedding model, and reasoning over these paths to generate answers. Unlike existing KGQA methods, KARPA avoids stepwise traversal, requires no additional training, and is adaptable to various LLM architectures. Extensive experimental results show that KARPA achieves state-of-the-art performance in KGQA tasks, delivering both high efficiency and accuracy. Our code will be available on Github.

### Efficiently Serving LLM Reasoning Programs with Certaindex
**Authors**: Yichao Fu, Junda Chen, Siqi Zhu, Zheyu Fu, Zhongdongming Dai, Aurick Qiao, Hao Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T14:57:53Z

**Summary**: The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) has unlocked their capabilities in advanced reasoning tasks like mathematical problem-solving, code generation, and legal analysis. Central to this progress are inference-time reasoning algorithms, which refine outputs by exploring multiple solution paths, at the cost of increasing compute demands and response latencies. Existing serving systems fail to adapt to the scaling behaviors of these algorithms or the varying difficulty of queries, leading to inefficient resource use and unmet latency targets.   We present Dynasor, a system that optimizes inference-time compute for LLM reasoning queries. Unlike traditional engines, Dynasor tracks and schedules requests within reasoning queries and uses Certaindex, a proxy that measures statistical reasoning progress based on model certainty, to guide compute allocation dynamically. Dynasor co-adapts scheduling with reasoning progress: it allocates more compute to hard queries, reduces compute for simpler ones, and terminates unpromising queries early, balancing accuracy, latency, and cost. On diverse datasets and algorithms, Dynasor reduces compute by up to 50% in batch processing and sustaining 3.3x higher query rates or 4.7x tighter latency SLOs in online serving.

### SepLLM: Accelerate Large Language Models by Compressing One Segment into   One Separator
**Authors**: Guoxuan Chen, Han Shi, Jiawei Li, Yihang Gao, Xiaozhe Ren, Yimeng Chen, Xin Jiang, Zhenguo Li, Weiyang Liu, Chao Huang

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T14:54:29Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited exceptional performance across a spectrum of natural language processing tasks. However, their substantial sizes pose considerable challenges, particularly in computational demands and inference speed, due to their quadratic complexity. In this work, we have identified a key pattern: certain seemingly meaningless special tokens (i.e., separators) contribute disproportionately to attention scores compared to semantically meaningful tokens. This observation suggests that information of the segments between these separator tokens can be effectively condensed into the separator tokens themselves without significant information loss. Guided by this insight, we introduce SepLLM, a plug-and-play framework that accelerates inference by compressing these segments and eliminating redundant tokens. Additionally, we implement efficient kernels for training acceleration. Experimental results across training-free, training-from-scratch, and post-training settings demonstrate SepLLM's effectiveness. Notably, using the Llama-3-8B backbone, SepLLM achieves over 50% reduction in KV cache on the GSM8K-CoT benchmark while maintaining comparable performance. Furthermore, in streaming settings, SepLLM effectively processes sequences of up to 4 million tokens or more while maintaining consistent language modeling capabilities.

### Rise of Generative Artificial Intelligence in Science
**Authors**: Liangping Ding, Cornelia Lawson, Philip Shapira

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T13:55:28Z

**Summary**: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI, generative AI) has rapidly become available as a tool in scientific research. To explore the use of generative AI in science, we conduct an empirical analysis using OpenAlex. Analyzing GenAI publications and other AI publications from 2017 to 2023, we profile growth patterns, the diffusion of GenAI publications across fields of study, and the geographical spread of scientific research on generative AI. We also investigate team size and international collaborations to explore whether GenAI, as an emerging scientific research area, shows different collaboration patterns compared to other AI technologies. The results indicate that generative AI has experienced rapid growth and increasing presence in scientific publications. The use of GenAI now extends beyond computer science to other scientific research domains. Over the study period, U.S. researchers contributed nearly two-fifths of global GenAI publications. The U.S. is followed by China, with several small and medium-sized advanced economies demonstrating relatively high levels of GenAI deployment in their research publications. Although scientific research overall is becoming increasingly specialized and collaborative, our results suggest that GenAI research groups tend to have slightly smaller team sizes than found in other AI fields. Furthermore, notwithstanding recent geopolitical tensions, GenAI research continues to exhibit levels of international collaboration comparable to other AI technologies.

### QuantumLLMInstruct: A 500k LLM Instruction-Tuning Dataset with   Problem-Solution Pairs for Quantum Computing
**Authors**: Shlomo Kashani

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T13:53:51Z

**Summary**: We present QuantumLLMInstruct (QLMMI), an innovative dataset featuring over 500,000 meticulously curated instruction-following problem-solution pairs designed specifically for quantum computing - the largest and most comprehensive dataset of its kind. Originating from over 90 primary seed domains and encompassing hundreds of subdomains autonomously generated by LLMs, QLMMI marks a transformative step in the diversity and richness of quantum computing datasets.   Designed for instruction fine-tuning, QLMMI seeks to significantly improve LLM performance in addressing complex quantum computing challenges across a wide range of quantum physics topics. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have propelled advancements in computational science with datasets like Omni-MATH and OpenMathInstruct, these primarily target Olympiad-level mathematics, leaving quantum computing largely unexplored.   The creation of QLMMI follows a rigorous four-stage methodology. Initially, foundational problems are developed using predefined templates, focusing on critical areas such as synthetic Hamiltonians, QASM code generation, Jordan-Wigner transformations, and Trotter-Suzuki quantum circuit decompositions. Next, detailed and domain-specific solutions are crafted to ensure accuracy and relevance. In the third stage, the dataset is enriched through advanced reasoning techniques, including Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Task-Oriented Reasoning and Action (ToRA), which enhance problem-solution diversity while adhering to strict mathematical standards. Lastly, a zero-shot Judge LLM performs self-assessments to validate the dataset's quality and reliability, minimizing human oversight requirements.

### AGON: Automated Design Framework for Customizing Processors from ISA   Documents
**Authors**: Chongxiao Li, Di Huang, Pengwei Jin, Tianyun Ma, Husheng Han, Shuyao Cheng, Yifan Hao, Yongwei Zhao, Guanglin Xu, Zidong Du, Rui Zhang, Xiaqing Li, Yuanbo Wen, Yanjun Wu, Chen Zhao, Xing Hu, Qi Guo

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T13:50:20Z

**Summary**: Customized processors are attractive solutions for vast domain-specific applications due to their high energy efficiency. However, designing a processor in traditional flows is time-consuming and expensive. To address this, researchers have explored methods including the use of agile development tools like Chisel or SpinalHDL, high-level synthesis (HLS) from programming languages like C or SystemC, and more recently, leveraging large language models (LLMs) to generate hardware description language (HDL) code from natural language descriptions. However, each method has limitations in terms of expressiveness, correctness, and performance, leading to a persistent contradiction between the level of automation and the effectiveness of the design. Overall, how to automatically design highly efficient and practical processors with minimal human effort remains a challenge.   In this paper, we propose AGON, a novel framework designed to leverage LLMs for the efficient design of out-of-order (OoO) customized processors with minimal human effort. Central to AGON is the nano-operator function (nOP function) based Intermediate Representation (IR), which bridges high-level descriptions and hardware implementations while decoupling functionality from performance optimization, thereby providing an automatic design framework that is expressive and efficient, has correctness guarantees, and enables PPA (Power, Performance, and Area) optimization.   Experimental results show that superior to previous LLM-assisted automatic design flows, AGON facilitates designing a series of customized OoO processors that achieve on average 2.35 $\times$ speedup compared with BOOM, a general-purpose CPU designed by experts, with minimal design effort.

### Nash CoT: Multi-Path Inference with Preference Equilibrium
**Authors**: Ziqi Zhang, Cunxiang Wang, Xiong Xiao, Yue Zhang, Donglin Wang

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T13:43:46Z

**Summary**: Chain of thought (CoT) is a reasoning framework that can enhance the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) on complex inference tasks. In particular, among various studies related to CoT, multi-path inference stands out as a simple yet effective improvement. However, there is no optimal setting for the number of inference paths. Therefore, we have to increase the number of inference paths to obtain better results, which in turn increases the inference cost. To address this limitation, we can utilize question-related role templates to guide LLMs into relevant roles, thereby increasing the possibility of correct inferences for each path and further reducing dependence on the number of inference paths while improving reasoning accuracy. However, placing LLMs into specific roles may reduce their reasoning diversity and performance on a few tasks where role dependence is low. To alleviate the excessive immersion of the LLM into a specific role, we propose Nash CoT by constructing a game system on each path that balances the generation from role-specific LLMs' and the general LLMs' generation, thereby ensuring both effective role adoption and diversity in LLM generation further maintaining the performance of multi-path inference while reducing the requirement of the number of inference paths. We evaluate Nash CoT across various inference tasks, including Arabic Reasoning, Commonsense Question Answering, and Symbolic Inference, achieving results that are comparable to or better than those of multi-path CoT with the equal number of inference paths.

### Cluster-Based Time-Variant Channel Characterization and Modeling for   5G-Railways
**Authors**: Xuejian Zhang, Ruisi He, Bo Ai, Mi Yang, Jianwen Ding, Shuaiqi Gao, Ziyi Qi, Zhengyu Zhang, Zhangdui Zhong

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T13:36:36Z

**Summary**: With the development of high-speed railways, 5G for Railways (5G-R) is gradually replacing Global System for the Mobile Communications for Railway (GSM-R) worldwide to meet increasing demands. The large bandwidth, array antennas, and non-stationarity caused by high mobility has made 5G-R channel characterization more complex. Therefore, it is essential to develop an accurate channel model for 5G-R. However, researches on channel characterization and time-variant models specific to 5G-R frequency bands and scenarios is scarce. There are virtually no cluster-based time-variant channel models that capture statistical properties of 5G-R channel. In this paper, we propose a cluster-based time-variant channel model for 5G-R within an enhanced 3GPP framework, which incorporates time evolution features. Extensive channel measurements are conducted on 5G-R private network test line in China. We then extract and analyze typical channel fading characteristics and multipath cluster characteristics. Furthermore, birth-death process of the clusters is modeled by using a four-state Markov chain. Finally, a generalized clustered delay line (CDL) model is established in accordance with 3GPP standard and validated by comparing the results of measurements and simulations. This work enhances the understanding of 5G-R channels and presents a flexible cluster-based time-variant channel model. The results can be used in the design, deployment, and optimization of 5G-R networks.

### Ontology-grounded Automatic Knowledge Graph Construction by LLM under   Wikidata schema
**Authors**: Xiaohan Feng, Xixin Wu, Helen Meng

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T13:36:05Z

**Summary**: We propose an ontology-grounded approach to Knowledge Graph (KG) construction using Large Language Models (LLMs) on a knowledge base. An ontology is authored by generating Competency Questions (CQ) on knowledge base to discover knowledge scope, extracting relations from CQs, and attempt to replace equivalent relations by their counterpart in Wikidata. To ensure consistency and interpretability in the resulting KG, we ground generation of KG with the authored ontology based on extracted relations. Evaluation on benchmark datasets demonstrates competitive performance in knowledge graph construction task. Our work presents a promising direction for scalable KG construction pipeline with minimal human intervention, that yields high quality and human-interpretable KGs, which are interoperable with Wikidata semantics for potential knowledge base expansion.

### WeatherDG: LLM-assisted Diffusion Model for Procedural Weather   Generation in Domain-Generalized Semantic Segmentation
**Authors**: Chenghao Qian, Yuhu Guo, Yuhong Mo, Wenjing Li

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T13:34:23Z

**Summary**: In this work, we propose a novel approach, namely WeatherDG, that can generate realistic, weather-diverse, and driving-screen images based on the cooperation of two foundation models, i.e, Stable Diffusion (SD) and Large Language Model (LLM). Specifically, we first fine-tune the SD with source data, aligning the content and layout of generated samples with real-world driving scenarios. Then, we propose a procedural prompt generation method based on LLM, which can enrich scenario descriptions and help SD automatically generate more diverse, detailed images. In addition, we introduce a balanced generation strategy, which encourages the SD to generate high-quality objects of tailed classes under various weather conditions, such as riders and motorcycles. This segmentation-model-agnostic method can improve the generalization ability of existing models by additionally adapting them with the generated synthetic data. Experiments on three challenging datasets show that our method can significantly improve the segmentation performance of different state-of-the-art models on target domains. Notably, in the setting of ''Cityscapes to ACDC'', our method improves the baseline HRDA by 13.9% in mIoU.

### Enhanced Multimodal RAG-LLM for Accurate Visual Question Answering
**Authors**: Junxiao Xue, Quan Deng, Fei Yu, Yanhao Wang, Jun Wang, Yuehua Li

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T13:16:08Z

**Summary**: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs), such as GPT-4o, Gemini, LLaVA, and Flamingo, have made significant progress in integrating visual and textual modalities, excelling in tasks like visual question answering (VQA), image captioning, and content retrieval. They can generate coherent and contextually relevant descriptions of images. However, they still face challenges in accurately identifying and counting objects and determining their spatial locations, particularly in complex scenes with overlapping or small objects. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework based on multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), which introduces structured scene graphs to enhance object recognition, relationship identification, and spatial understanding within images. Our framework improves the MLLM's capacity to handle tasks requiring precise visual descriptions, especially in scenarios with challenging perspectives, such as aerial views or scenes with dense object arrangements. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on the VG-150 dataset that focuses on first-person visual understanding and the AUG dataset that involves aerial imagery. The results show that our approach consistently outperforms existing MLLMs in VQA tasks, which stands out in recognizing, localizing, and quantifying objects in different spatial contexts and provides more accurate visual descriptions.

### An Empirical Study of Catastrophic Forgetting in Large Language Models   During Continual Fine-tuning
**Authors**: Yun Luo, Zhen Yang, Fandong Meng, Yafu Li, Jie Zhou, Yue Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T12:32:49Z

**Summary**: Catastrophic forgetting (CF) is a phenomenon that occurs in machine learning when a model forgets previously learned information while acquiring new knowledge for achieving a satisfactory performance in downstream tasks. As large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance, it is intriguing to investigate whether CF exists during the continual instruction tuning of LLMs. This study empirically evaluates the forgetting phenomenon in LLMs' knowledge during continual instruction tuning from the perspectives of domain knowledge, reasoning, and reading comprehension. The experiments reveal that catastrophic forgetting is generally observed in LLMs ranging from 1b to 7b parameters. Surprisingly, as the model scale increases, the severity of forgetting intensifies in such a model sale range which may result from the much significant initial performance in the larger LLM. Comparing the decoder-only model BLOOMZ with the encoder-decoder model mT0, BLOOMZ exhibits less forgetting and retains more knowledge. Interestingly, we also observe that LLMs can mitigate language biases, such as gender bias, during continual fine-tuning. Furthermore, our findings indicate that general instruction tuning can help alleviate the forgetting phenomenon in LLMs during subsequent fine-tuning.

### DoTA: Weight-Decomposed Tensor Adaptation for Large Language Models
**Authors**: Xiaolin Hu, Xiang Cheng, Peiyu Liu, Wei Liu, Jian Luan, Bin Wang, Yong Liu

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T12:00:47Z

**Summary**: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) reduces the computational and memory demands of fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) by approximating updates with low-rank matrices. However, low-rank approximation in two-dimensional space fails to capture high-dimensional structures within the target matrix. Recently, tensor decomposition methods have been explored for fine-tuning LLMs, leveraging their ability to extract structured information. Yet, these approaches primarily rely on random initialization, and the impact of initialization on tensor adaptation remains underexplored. In this paper, we reveal that random initialization significantly diverges from the validation loss achieved by full fine-tuning. To address this, we propose Weight-Decomposed Tensor Adaptation (DoTA), which leverages the Matrix Product Operator (MPO) decomposition of pre-trained weights for effective initialization in fine-tuning LLMs. Additionally, we introduce QDoTA, a quantized version of DoTA designed for 4-bit quantization. Experiments on commonsense and arithmetic reasoning tasks show that DoTA outperforms random initialization methods with fewer parameters. QDoTA further reduces memory consumption and achieves comparable performance to DoTA on commonsense reasoning tasks. We will release our code to support future research.

### Attention Is All You Need For Mixture-of-Depths Routing
**Authors**: Advait Gadhikar, Souptik Kumar Majumdar, Niclas Popp, Piyapat Saranrittichai, Martin Rapp, Lukas Schott

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T11:25:54Z

**Summary**: Advancements in deep learning are driven by training models with increasingly larger numbers of parameters, which in turn heightens the computational demands. To address this issue, Mixture-of-Depths (MoD) models have been proposed to dynamically assign computations only to the most relevant parts of the inputs, thereby enabling the deployment of large-parameter models with high efficiency during inference and training. These MoD models utilize a routing mechanism to determine which tokens should be processed by a layer, or skipped. However, conventional MoD models employ additional network layers specifically for the routing which are difficult to train, and add complexity and deployment overhead to the model. In this paper, we introduce a novel attention-based routing mechanism A-MoD that leverages the existing attention map of the preceding layer for routing decisions within the current layer. Compared to standard routing, A-MoD allows for more efficient training as it introduces no additional trainable parameters and can be easily adapted from pretrained transformer models. Furthermore, it can increase the performance of the MoD model. For instance, we observe up to 2% higher accuracy on ImageNet compared to standard routing and isoFLOP ViT baselines. Furthermore, A-MoD improves the MoD training convergence, leading to up to 2x faster transfer learning.

### Distilling Fine-grained Sentiment Understanding from Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Yice Zhang, Guangyu Xie, Hongling Xu, Kaiheng Hou, Jianzhu Bao, Qianlong Wang, Shiwei Chen, Ruifeng Xu

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T11:24:32Z

**Summary**: Fine-grained sentiment analysis (FSA) aims to extract and summarize user opinions from vast opinionated text. Recent studies demonstrate that large language models (LLMs) possess exceptional sentiment understanding capabilities. However, directly deploying LLMs for FSA applications incurs high inference costs. Therefore, this paper investigates the distillation of fine-grained sentiment understanding from LLMs into small language models (SLMs). We prompt LLMs to examine and interpret the sentiments of given reviews and then utilize the generated content to pretrain SLMs. Additionally, we develop a comprehensive FSA benchmark to evaluate both SLMs and LLMs. Extensive experiments on this benchmark reveal that: (1) distillation significantly enhances the performance of SLMs in FSA tasks, achieving a 6.00\% improvement in $F_1$-score, and the distilled model can outperform Llama-2-7b with only 220M parameters; (2) distillation equips SLMs with excellent zero-shot sentiment classification capabilities, enabling them to match or even exceed their teacher models. These results suggest that distillation from LLMs is a highly promising direction for FSA.

**Authors**: Fatou Ndiaye Mbodji, Vinny Adjibi, Gervais Mendy, Moustapha Awwalou Diouf, Jacques Klein, Tegawende Bissyande

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T11:10:22Z

**Summary**: Tracking the evolution of smart contracts is a significant challenge, impeding on the advancement of research on smart contract analysis. Indeed, due to the inherent immutability of the underlying blockchain technology, each smart contract update results in a deployment at a new address, breaking the links between versions. Existing platforms like Etherscan lack the capability to trace the predecessor-successor relationships within a smart contract lineage, further hindering empirical research on contract evolution.   We address this challenge for the research community towards building a reliable dataset of linked versions for various smart contracts, i.e., lineages: we introduce SCLineage, an automated infrastructure that accurately identifies and collects smart contract lineages by leveraging proxy contracts. We present SCLineageSet, an up-to-date, open-source dataset that facilitates extensive research on smart contract evolution. We illustrate the applicability of our proposal in software engineering research through a case study that explores the evaluation of Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) for forming contract lineages. This example underscores how SCLineage provides valuable insights for future research in the field.

### Enhancing Annotated Bibliography Generation with LLM Ensembles
**Authors**: Sergio Bermejo

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T11:07:05Z

**Summary**: This work proposes a novel approach to enhancing annotated bibliography generation through Large Language Model (LLM) ensembles. In particular, multiple LLMs in different roles -- controllable text generation, evaluation, and summarization -- are introduced and validated using a systematic methodology to enhance model performance in scholarly tasks. Output diversity among the ensemble that generates text is obtained using different LLM parameters, followed by an LLM acting as a judge to assess relevance, accuracy, and coherence. Responses selected by several combining strategies are then merged and refined through summarization and redundancy removal techniques. The preliminary experimental validation demonstrates that the combined outputs from the LLM ensemble improve coherence and relevance compared to individual responses, leading to a 38% improvement in annotation quality and a 51% reduction in content redundancy, thus highlighting the potential for automating complex scholarly tasks while maintaining high-quality standards.

**Authors**: Hiroki Furuta, Kuang-Huei Lee, Shixiang Shane Gu, Yutaka Matsuo, Aleksandra Faust, Heiga Zen, Izzeddin Gur

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T11:05:20Z

**Summary**: Many algorithms for aligning LLMs with human preferences assume that human preferences are binary and deterministic. However, human preferences can vary across individuals, and therefore should be represented distributionally. In this work, we introduce the distributional soft preference labels and improve Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with a weighted geometric average of the LLM output likelihood in the loss function. This approach adjusts the scale of learning loss based on the soft labels such that the loss would approach zero when the responses are closer to equally preferred. This simple modification can be easily applied to any DPO-based methods and mitigate over-optimization and objective mismatch, which prior works suffer from. Our experiments simulate the soft preference labels with AI feedback from LLMs and demonstrate that geometric averaging consistently improves performance on standard benchmarks for alignment research. In particular, we observe more preferable responses than binary labels and significant improvements where modestly-confident labels are in the majority.

### Are LLMs Really Not Knowledgable? Mining the Submerged Knowledge in   LLMs' Memory
**Authors**: Xingjian Tao, Yiwei Wang, Yujun Cai, Zhicheng Yang, Jing Tang

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T10:29:18Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise as potential knowledge bases, yet they often struggle with question-answering tasks and are prone to hallucinations. While previous research attributes these issues to knowledge gaps in the model's parameters, our investigation reveals a different phenomenon: LLMs often retain correct knowledge even when generating incorrect answers. Through analysis of model's internal representations, we find that correct answers frequently appear among high-probability tokens despite not being selected as final outputs. Based on this observation, we introduce Hits@k, a new metric to assess knowledge retention independent of expression accuracy. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that LLMs store significantly more knowledge than their QA performance suggests. Building on these findings, we develop SkipUnsure, a method to improve answer accuracy by leveraging detected but unexpressed knowledge. Experiments on both open-domain and specific-domain datasets show consistent improvements, with accuracy gains of up to 11.8% on DBPedia and 6.3% on IMDB, without requiring model retraining.

### Disentangling Preference Representation and Text Generation for   Efficient Individual Preference Alignment
**Authors**: Jianfei Zhang, Jun Bai, Bei Li, Yanmeng Wang, Rumei Li, Chenghua Lin, Wenge Rong

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T09:58:31Z

**Summary**: Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with general human preferences has been proved crucial in improving the interaction quality between LLMs and human. However, human values are inherently diverse among different individuals, making it insufficient to align LLMs solely with general preferences. To address this, personalizing LLMs according to individual feedback emerges as a promising solution. Nonetheless, this approach presents challenges in terms of the efficiency of alignment algorithms. In this work, we introduce a flexible paradigm for individual preference alignment. Our method fundamentally improves efficiency by disentangling preference representation from text generation in LLMs. We validate our approach across multiple text generation tasks and demonstrate that it can produce aligned quality as well as or better than PEFT-based methods, while reducing additional training time for each new individual preference by $80\%$ to $90\%$ in comparison with them.

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T09:51:38Z

**Summary**: The growing complexity of radar signals demands responsive and accurate detection systems that can operate efficiently on resource-constrained edge devices. Existing models, while effective, often rely on substantial computational resources and large datasets, making them impractical for edge deployment. In this work, we propose an ultralight hybrid neural network optimized for edge applications, delivering robust performance across unfavorable signal-to-noise ratios (mean accuracy of 96.3% at 0 dB) using less than 100 samples per class, and significantly reducing computational overhead.

### A Simple Recipe for Contrastively Pre-training Video-First Encoders   Beyond 16 Frames
**Authors**: Pinelopi Papalampidi, Skanda Koppula, Shreya Pathak, Justin Chiu, Joe Heyward, Viorica Patraucean, Jiajun Shen, Antoine Miech, Andrew Zisserman, Aida Nematzadeh

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T09:51:22Z

**Summary**: Understanding long, real-world videos requires modeling of long-range visual dependencies. To this end, we explore video-first architectures, building on the common paradigm of transferring large-scale, image--text models to video via shallow temporal fusion. However, we expose two limitations to the approach: (1) decreased spatial capabilities, likely due to poor video--language alignment in standard video datasets, and (2) higher memory consumption, bottlenecking the number of frames that can be processed. To mitigate the memory bottleneck, we systematically analyze the memory/accuracy trade-off of various efficient methods: factorized attention, parameter-efficient image-to-video adaptation, input masking, and multi-resolution patchification. Surprisingly, simply masking large portions of the video (up to 75%) during contrastive pre-training proves to be one of the most robust ways to scale encoders to videos up to 4.3 minutes at 1 FPS. Our simple approach for training long video-to-text models, which scales to 1B parameters, does not add new architectural complexity and is able to outperform the popular paradigm of using much larger LLMs as an information aggregator over segment-based information on benchmarks with long-range temporal dependencies (YouCook2, EgoSchema).

### Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Mobile Edge Computing via Large   Language Model
**Authors**: Runtao Ren, Yinyu Wu, Xuhui Zhang, Jinke Ren, Yanyan Shen, Shuqiang Wang, Kim-Fung Tsang

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T09:30:36Z

**Summary**: The rapid evolution of mobile edge computing (MEC) has introduced significant challenges in optimizing resource allocation in highly dynamic wireless communication systems, in which task offloading decisions should be made in real-time. However, existing resource allocation strategies cannot well adapt to the dynamic and heterogeneous characteristics of MEC systems, since they are short of scalability, context-awareness, and interpretability. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) method to improve the performance of MEC systems. Specifically, a latency minimization problem is first proposed to jointly optimize the data offloading ratio, transmit power allocation, and computing resource allocation. Then, an LLM-enabled information-retrieval mechanism is proposed to solve the problem efficiently. Extensive experiments across multi-user, multi-task, and highly dynamic offloading scenarios show that the proposed method consistently reduces latency compared to several DL-based approaches, achieving 57% improvement under varying user computing ability, 86% with different servers, 30% under distinct transmit powers, and 42% for varying data volumes. These results show the effectiveness of LLM-driven solutions to solve the resource allocation problems in MEC systems.

### Molar: Multimodal LLMs with Collaborative Filtering Alignment for   Enhanced Sequential Recommendation
**Authors**: Yucong Luo, Qitao Qin, Hao Zhang, Mingyue Cheng, Ruiran Yan, Kefan Wang, Jie Ouyang

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T09:24:34Z

**Summary**: Sequential recommendation (SR) systems have evolved significantly over the past decade, transitioning from traditional collaborative filtering to deep learning approaches and, more recently, to large language models (LLMs). While the adoption of LLMs has driven substantial advancements, these models inherently lack collaborative filtering information, relying primarily on textual content data neglecting other modalities and thus failing to achieve optimal recommendation performance. To address this limitation, we propose Molar, a Multimodal large language sequential recommendation framework that integrates multiple content modalities with ID information to capture collaborative signals effectively. Molar employs an MLLM to generate unified item representations from both textual and non-textual data, facilitating comprehensive multimodal modeling and enriching item embeddings. Additionally, it incorporates collaborative filtering signals through a post-alignment mechanism, which aligns user representations from content-based and ID-based models, ensuring precise personalization and robust performance. By seamlessly combining multimodal content with collaborative filtering insights, Molar captures both user interests and contextual semantics, leading to superior recommendation accuracy. Extensive experiments validate that Molar significantly outperforms traditional and LLM-based baselines, highlighting its strength in utilizing multimodal data and collaborative signals for sequential recommendation tasks. The source code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Molar-8B06/.

### TextMatch: Enhancing Image-Text Consistency Through Multimodal   Optimization
**Authors**: Yucong Luo, Mingyue Cheng, Jie Ouyang, Xiaoyu Tao, Qi Liu

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T09:22:24Z

**Summary**: Text-to-image generative models excel in creating images from text but struggle with ensuring alignment and consistency between outputs and prompts. This paper introduces TextMatch, a novel framework that leverages multimodal optimization to address image-text discrepancies in text-to-image (T2I) generation and editing. TextMatch employs a scoring strategy powered by large language models (LLMs) and visual question-answering (VQA) models to evaluate semantic consistency between prompts and generated images. By integrating multimodal in-context learning and chain of thought reasoning, our method dynamically refines prompts through iterative optimization. This process ensures that the generated images better capture user intent of, resulting in higher fidelity and relevance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TextMatch significantly improves text-image consistency across multiple benchmarks, establishing a reliable framework for advancing the capabilities of text-to-image generative models. Our code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/TextMatch-F55C/.

### LLM-as-an-Interviewer: Beyond Static Testing Through Dynamic LLM   Evaluation
**Authors**: Eunsu Kim, Juyoung Suk, Seungone Kim, Niklas Muennighoff, Dongkwan Kim, Alice Oh

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T09:11:50Z

**Summary**: We introduce LLM-as-an-Interviewer, a novel paradigm for evaluating large language models (LLMs). This approach leverages multi-turn interactions where the LLM interviewer actively provides feedback on responses and poses follow-up questions to the evaluated LLM. At the start of the interview, the LLM interviewer dynamically modifies datasets to generate initial questions, mitigating data contamination. We apply the LLM-as-an-Interviewer framework to evaluate six models on the MATH and DepthQA tasks. Our results show that the framework effectively provides insights into LLM performance, including the quality of initial responses, adaptability to feedback, and ability to address follow-up queries like clarification or additional knowledge requests. The framework also addresses key limitations of conventional methods like LLM-as-a-Judge, including verbosity bias and inconsistency across runs. Finally, we propose the Interview Report, which aggregates insights from the interview process, providing examples and a comprehensive analysis of the LLM's strengths and weaknesses. This report offers a detailed snapshot of the model's real-world applicability. The code for our framework is publicly available at https://github.com/interview-eval/.

### Synchronized Video Storytelling: Generating Video Narrations with   Structured Storyline
**Authors**: Dingyi Yang, Chunru Zhan, Ziheng Wang, Biao Wang, Tiezheng Ge, Bo Zheng, Qin Jin

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T09:02:53Z

**Summary**: Video storytelling is engaging multimedia content that utilizes video and its accompanying narration to attract the audience, where a key challenge is creating narrations for recorded visual scenes. Previous studies on dense video captioning and video story generation have made some progress. However, in practical applications, we typically require synchronized narrations for ongoing visual scenes. In this work, we introduce a new task of Synchronized Video Storytelling, which aims to generate synchronous and informative narrations for videos. These narrations, associated with each video clip, should relate to the visual content, integrate relevant knowledge, and have an appropriate word count corresponding to the clip's duration. Specifically, a structured storyline is beneficial to guide the generation process, ensuring coherence and integrity. To support the exploration of this task, we introduce a new benchmark dataset E-SyncVidStory with rich annotations. Since existing Multimodal LLMs are not effective in addressing this task in one-shot or few-shot settings, we propose a framework named VideoNarrator that can generate a storyline for input videos and simultaneously generate narrations with the guidance of the generated or predefined storyline. We further introduce a set of evaluation metrics to thoroughly assess the generation. Both automatic and human evaluations validate the effectiveness of our approach. Our dataset, codes, and evaluations will be released.

### Privacy-Preserving Customer Support: A Framework for Secure and Scalable   Interactions
**Authors**: Anant Prakash Awasthi, Girdhar Gopal Agarwal, Chandraketu Singh, Rakshit Varma, Sanchit Sharma

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T08:29:09Z

**Summary**: The growing reliance on artificial intelligence (AI) in customer support has significantly improved operational efficiency and user experience. However, traditional machine learning (ML) approaches, which require extensive local training on sensitive datasets, pose substantial privacy risks and compliance challenges with regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Existing privacy-preserving techniques, such as anonymization, differential privacy, and federated learning, address some concerns but face limitations in utility, scalability, and complexity. This paper introduces the Privacy-Preserving Zero-Shot Learning (PP-ZSL) framework, a novel approach leveraging large language models (LLMs) in a zero-shot learning mode. Unlike conventional ML methods, PP-ZSL eliminates the need for local training on sensitive data by utilizing pre-trained LLMs to generate responses directly. The framework incorporates real-time data anonymization to redact or mask sensitive information, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for domain-specific query resolution, and robust post-processing to ensure compliance with regulatory standards. This combination reduces privacy risks, simplifies compliance, and enhances scalability and operational efficiency. Empirical analysis demonstrates that the PP-ZSL framework provides accurate, privacy-compliant responses while significantly lowering the costs and complexities of deploying AI-driven customer support systems. The study highlights potential applications across industries, including financial services, healthcare, e-commerce, legal support, telecommunications, and government services. By addressing the dual challenges of privacy and performance, this framework establishes a foundation for secure, efficient, and regulatory-compliant AI applications in customer interactions.

### SecBench: A Comprehensive Multi-Dimensional Benchmarking Dataset for   LLMs in Cybersecurity
**Authors**: Pengfei Jing, Mengyun Tang, Xiaorong Shi, Xing Zheng, Sen Nie, Shi Wu, Yong Yang, Xiapu Luo

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T08:11:54Z

**Summary**: Evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for understanding their capabilities and limitations across various applications, including natural language processing and code generation. Existing benchmarks like MMLU, C-Eval, and HumanEval assess general LLM performance but lack focus on specific expert domains such as cybersecurity. Previous attempts to create cybersecurity datasets have faced limitations, including insufficient data volume and a reliance on multiple-choice questions (MCQs). To address these gaps, we propose SecBench, a multi-dimensional benchmarking dataset designed to evaluate LLMs in the cybersecurity domain. SecBench includes questions in various formats (MCQs and short-answer questions (SAQs)), at different capability levels (Knowledge Retention and Logical Reasoning), in multiple languages (Chinese and English), and across various sub-domains. The dataset was constructed by collecting high-quality data from open sources and organizing a Cybersecurity Question Design Contest, resulting in 44,823 MCQs and 3,087 SAQs. Particularly, we used the powerful while cost-effective LLMs to (1). label the data and (2). constructing a grading agent for automatic evaluation of SAQs.Benchmarking results on 13 SOTA LLMs demonstrate the usability of SecBench, which is arguably the largest and most comprehensive benchmark dataset for LLMs in cybersecurity. More information about SecBench can be found at our website, and the dataset can be accessed via the artifact link.

### LLM-based Translation Inference with Iterative Bilingual Understanding
**Authors**: Andong Chen, Kehai Chen, Yang Xiang, Xuefeng Bai, Muyun Yang, Yang Feng, Tiejun Zhao, Min zhang

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T07:57:10Z

**Summary**: The remarkable understanding and generation capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have greatly improved translation performance. However, incorrect understanding of the sentence to be translated can degrade translation quality. To address this issue, we proposed a novel Iterative Bilingual Understanding Translation (IBUT) method based on the cross-lingual capabilities of LLMs and the dual characteristics of translation tasks. The cross-lingual capability of LLMs enables the generation of contextual understanding for both the source and target languages separately. Furthermore, the dual characteristics allow IBUT to generate effective cross-lingual feedback, iteratively refining contextual understanding, thereby reducing errors and improving translation performance. Experimental results showed that the proposed IBUT outperforms several strong comparison methods, especially being generalized to multiple domains (e.g., news, commonsense, and cultural translation benchmarks).

### FreStega: A Plug-and-Play Method for Boosting Imperceptibility and   Capacity in Generative Linguistic Steganography for Real-World Scenarios
**Authors**: Kaiyi Pang

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T07:49:13Z

**Summary**: Linguistic steganography embeds secret information in seemingly innocent texts, safeguarding privacy in surveillance environments. Generative linguistic steganography leverages the probability distribution of language models (LMs) and applies steganographic algorithms to generate stego tokens, gaining attention with recent Large Language Model (LLM) advancements. To enhance security, researchers develop distribution-preserving stego algorithms to minimize the gap between stego sampling and LM sampling. However, the reliance on language model distributions, coupled with deviations from real-world cover texts, results in insufficient imperceptibility when facing steganalysis detectors in real-world scenarios. Moreover, LLM distributions tend to be more deterministic, resulting in reduced entropy and, consequently, lower embedding capacity. In this paper, we propose FreStega, a plug-and-play method to reconstruct the distribution of language models used for generative linguistic steganography. FreStega dynamically adjusts token probabilities from the language model at each step of stegotext auto-regressive generation, leveraging both sequential and spatial dimensions. In sequential adjustment, the temperature is dynamically adjusted based on instantaneous entropy, enhancing the diversity of stego texts and boosting embedding capacity. In the spatial dimension, the distribution is aligned with guidance from the target domain corpus, closely mimicking real cover text in the target domain. By reforming the distribution, FreStega enhances the imperceptibility of stego text in practical scenarios and improves steganographic capacity by 15.41\%, all without compromising the quality of the generated text. FreStega serves as a plug-and-play remedy to enhance the imperceptibility and embedding capacity of existing distribution-preserving steganography methods in real-world scenarios.

### Large Language Model Enabled Multi-Task Physical Layer Network
**Authors**: Tianyue Zheng, Linglong Dai

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T07:47:30Z

**Summary**: The recent advance of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is continuously reshaping the future 6G wireless communications. Recently, the development of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers a promising approach to effectively improve the performance and generalization for different physical layer tasks. However, most existing works finetune dedicated LLM networks for a single wireless communication task separately. Thus performing diverse physical layer tasks introduces extremely high training resources, memory usage, and deployment costs. To solve the problem, we propose a LLM-enabled multi-task physical layer network to unify multiple tasks with a single LLM. Specifically, we first propose a multi-task LLM framework, which finetunes LLM to perform multi-user precoding, signal detection and channel prediction simultaneously. Besides, multi-task instruction module, input encoders, as well as output decoders, are elaborately designed to distinguish multiple tasks and adapted the features of different formats of wireless data for the features of LLM. Numerical simulations are also displayed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

As a use-case application, we present its potential use in nursing by extending its capabilities to operate human devices and tools according to the task and by enabling remote assistance operations. To meet a wide variety of tasks and situations in environments designed by and for humans, we developed a system that seamlessly integrates the slim and lightweight robot and several technologies: locomanipulation, multi-contact motion, teleoperation, and object detection and tracking. We demonstrated the system's usage in a nursing application. The robot efficiently performed the daily task of patient transfer and a non-routine task, represented by a request to operate a circuit breaker. This demonstration, held at the 2023 International Robot Exhibition (IREX), conducted three times a day over three days.

### Autoware.Flex: Human-Instructed Dynamically Reconfigurable Autonomous   Driving Systems
**Authors**: Ziwei Song, Mingsong Lv, Tianchi Ren, Chun Jason Xue, Jen-Ming Wu, Nan Guan

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T07:27:29Z

**Summary**: Existing Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS) independently make driving decisions, but they face two significant limitations. First, in complex scenarios, ADS may misinterpret the environment and make inappropriate driving decisions. Second, these systems are unable to incorporate human driving preferences in their decision-making processes. This paper proposes Autoware$.$Flex, a novel ADS system that incorporates human input into the driving process, allowing users to guide the ADS in making more appropriate decisions and ensuring their preferences are satisfied. Achieving this needs to address two key challenges: (1) translating human instructions, expressed in natural language, into a format the ADS can understand, and (2) ensuring these instructions are executed safely and consistently within the ADS' s decision-making framework. For the first challenge, we employ a Large Language Model (LLM) assisted by an ADS-specialized knowledge base to enhance domain-specific translation. For the second challenge, we design a validation mechanism to ensure that human instructions result in safe and consistent driving behavior. Experiments conducted on both simulators and a real-world autonomous vehicle demonstrate that Autoware$.$Flex effectively interprets human instructions and executes them safely.

**Summary**: Different from the traditional translation tasks, classical Chinese poetry translation requires both adequacy and fluency in translating culturally and historically significant content and linguistic poetic elegance. Large language models (LLMs) with impressive multilingual capabilities may bring a ray of hope to achieve this extreme translation demand. This paper first introduces a suitable benchmark (PoetMT) where each Chinese poetry has a recognized elegant translation. Meanwhile, we propose a new metric based on GPT-4 to evaluate the extent to which current LLMs can meet these demands. Our empirical evaluation reveals that the existing LLMs fall short in the challenging task. Hence, we propose a Retrieval-Augmented Machine Translation (RAT) method which incorporates knowledge related to classical poetry for advancing the translation of Chinese Poetry in LLMs. Experimental results show that RAT consistently outperforms all comparison methods regarding wildly used BLEU, COMET, BLEURT, our proposed metric, and human evaluation.

### ConTrans: Weak-to-Strong Alignment Engineering via Concept   Transplantation
**Authors**: Weilong Dong, Xinwei Wu, Renren Jin, Shaoyang Xu, Deyi Xiong

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T07:25:13Z

**Summary**: Ensuring large language models (LLM) behave consistently with human goals, values, and intentions is crucial for their safety but yet computationally expensive. To reduce the computational cost of alignment training of LLMs, especially for those with a huge number of parameters, and to reutilize learned value alignment, we propose ConTrans, a novel framework that enables weak-to-strong alignment transfer via concept transplantation. From the perspective of representation engineering, ConTrans refines concept vectors in value alignment from a source LLM (usually a weak yet aligned LLM). The refined concept vectors are then reformulated to adapt to the target LLM (usually a strong yet unaligned base LLM) via affine transformation. In the third step, ConTrans transplants the reformulated concept vectors into the residual stream of the target LLM. Experiments demonstrate the successful transplantation of a wide range of aligned concepts from 7B models to 13B and 70B models across multiple LLMs and LLM families. Remarkably, ConTrans even surpasses instruction-tuned models in terms of truthfulness. Experiment results validate the effectiveness of both inter-LLM-family and intra-LLM-family concept transplantation. Our work successfully demonstrates an alternative way to achieve weak-to-strong alignment generalization and control.

### Zero-Indexing Internet Search Augmented Generation for Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Guangxin He, Zonghong Dai, Jiangcheng Zhu, Binqiang Zhao, Qicheng Hu, Chenyue Li, You Peng, Chen Wang, Binhang Yuan

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T06:52:12Z

**Summary**: Retrieval augmented generation has emerged as an effective method to enhance large language model performance. This approach typically relies on an internal retrieval module that uses various indexing mechanisms to manage a static pre-processed corpus. However, such a paradigm often falls short when it is necessary to integrate the most up-to-date information that has not been updated into the corpus during generative inference time. In this paper, we explore an alternative approach that leverages standard search engine APIs to dynamically integrate the latest online information (without maintaining any index for any fixed corpus), thereby improving the quality of generated content. We design a collaborative LLM-based paradigm, where we include: (i) a parser-LLM that determines if the Internet augmented generation is demanded and extracts the search keywords if so with a single inference; (ii) a mixed ranking strategy that re-ranks the retrieved HTML files to eliminate bias introduced from the search engine API; and (iii) an extractor-LLM that can accurately and efficiently extract relevant information from the fresh content in each HTML file. We conduct extensive empirical studies to evaluate the performance of this Internet search augmented generation paradigm. The experimental results demonstrate that our method generates content with significantly improved quality. Our system has been successfully deployed in a production environment to serve 01.AI's generative inference requests.

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T05:54:24Z

**Summary**: GUIs have long been central to human-computer interaction, providing an intuitive and visually-driven way to access and interact with digital systems. The advent of LLMs, particularly multimodal models, has ushered in a new era of GUI automation. They have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in natural language understanding, code generation, and visual processing. This has paved the way for a new generation of LLM-brained GUI agents capable of interpreting complex GUI elements and autonomously executing actions based on natural language instructions. These agents represent a paradigm shift, enabling users to perform intricate, multi-step tasks through simple conversational commands. Their applications span across web navigation, mobile app interactions, and desktop automation, offering a transformative user experience that revolutionizes how individuals interact with software. This emerging field is rapidly advancing, with significant progress in both research and industry.   To provide a structured understanding of this trend, this paper presents a comprehensive survey of LLM-brained GUI agents, exploring their historical evolution, core components, and advanced techniques. We address research questions such as existing GUI agent frameworks, the collection and utilization of data for training specialized GUI agents, the development of large action models tailored for GUI tasks, and the evaluation metrics and benchmarks necessary to assess their effectiveness. Additionally, we examine emerging applications powered by these agents. Through a detailed analysis, this survey identifies key research gaps and outlines a roadmap for future advancements in the field. By consolidating foundational knowledge and state-of-the-art developments, this work aims to guide both researchers and practitioners in overcoming challenges and unlocking the full potential of LLM-brained GUI agents.

### M$^3$oralBench: A MultiModal Moral Benchmark for LVLMs
**Authors**: Bei Yan, Jie Zhang, Zhiyuan Chen, Shiguang Shan, Xilin Chen

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T05:18:55Z

**Summary**: Recently, large foundation models, including large language models (LLMs) and large vision-language models (LVLMs), have become essential tools in critical fields such as law, finance, and healthcare. As these models increasingly integrate into our daily life, it is necessary to conduct moral evaluation to ensure that their outputs align with human values and remain within moral boundaries. Previous works primarily focus on LLMs, proposing moral datasets and benchmarks limited to text modality. However, given the rapid development of LVLMs, there is still a lack of multimodal moral evaluation methods. To bridge this gap, we introduce M$^3$oralBench, the first MultiModal Moral Benchmark for LVLMs. M$^3$oralBench expands the everyday moral scenarios in Moral Foundations Vignettes (MFVs) and employs the text-to-image diffusion model, SD3.0, to create corresponding scenario images. It conducts moral evaluation across six moral foundations of Moral Foundations Theory (MFT) and encompasses tasks in moral judgement, moral classification, and moral response, providing a comprehensive assessment of model performance in multimodal moral understanding and reasoning. Extensive experiments on 10 popular open-source and closed-source LVLMs demonstrate that M$^3$oralBench is a challenging benchmark, exposing notable moral limitations in current models. Our benchmark is publicly available.

### Aligning the Objective of LLM-based Program Repair
**Authors**: Junjielong Xu, Ying Fu, Shin Hwei Tan, Pinjia He

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T05:08:00Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved decent results on automated program repair (APR). However, the next token prediction training objective of decoder-only LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) is misaligned with the masked span prediction objective of current infilling-style methods, which impedes LLMs from fully leveraging pre-trained knowledge for program repair. In addition, while some LLMs can locate and repair bugs in certain functions using the related artifacts (e.g., test cases), existing methods still depend on statement-level fault localization methods to provide a list of buggy hunks for repair. This restriction hinders LLMs from exploring potential patches beyond the given locations.   In this paper, we investigate a new approach to adapt LLMs to program repair. Our core insight is that LLM's APR capability can be greatly improved by simply aligning the output to their training objective and allowing them to refine the whole program without first identifying faulty statements. Based on this insight, we designed D4C, a straightforward prompting framework for APR. D4C can repair 180 bugs correctly in Defects4J, with each patch being sampled only 10 times. This surpasses the SOTA APR methods with perfect fault localization by 10% and reduces the patch sampling number by 90%. Our findings reveal that (1) objective alignment is crucial for fully exploiting LLM's pre-trained capability, and (2) replacing the traditional localize-buggy-hunks-then-repair workflow with direct debugging is more effective for LLM-based APR methods. Thus, we believe this paper introduces a new mindset for harnessing LLMs in APR.

### ChartAdapter: Large Vision-Language Model for Chart Summarization
**Authors**: Peixin Xu, Yujuan Ding, Wenqi Fan

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T05:07:34Z

**Summary**: Chart summarization, which focuses on extracting key information from charts and interpreting it in natural language, is crucial for generating and delivering insights through effective and accessible data analysis. Traditional methods for chart understanding and summarization often rely on multi-stage pipelines, which may produce suboptimal semantic alignment between visual and textual information. In comparison, recently developed LLM-based methods are more dependent on the capability of foundation images or languages, while ignoring the characteristics of chart data and its relevant challenges. To address these limitations, we propose ChartAdapter, a novel lightweight transformer module designed to bridge the gap between charts and textual summaries. ChartAdapter employs learnable query vectors to extract implicit semantics from chart data and incorporates a cross-modal alignment projector to enhance vision-to-language generative learning. By integrating ChartAdapter with an LLM, we enable end-to-end training and efficient chart summarization. To further enhance the training, we introduce a three-stage hierarchical training procedure and develop a large-scale dataset specifically curated for chart summarization, comprising 190,618 samples. Experimental results on the standard Chart-to-Text testing set demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods, including state-of-the-art models, in generating high-quality chart summaries. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of key components in ChartAdapter. This work highlights the potential of tailored LLM-based approaches to advance chart understanding and sets a strong foundation for future research in this area.

### SelectLLM: Query-Aware Efficient Selection Algorithm for Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Kaushal Kumar Maurya, KV Aditya Srivatsa, Ekaterina Kochmar

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T05:01:44Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have seen widespread adoption due to their remarkable performance across various applications, driving the accelerated development of a large number of diverse LLMs. However, these individual LLMs show limitations in generalization and performance on complex tasks due to inherent training biases, model size constraints, and the quality or diversity of pre-training datasets. A promising direction is to efficiently harness the diverse capabilities of LLMs to overcome these individual limitations. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel LLM selection algorithm called SelectLLM, which efficiently directs input queries to the most suitable subset of LLMs from a large pool, ensuring that the selected models collectively provide accurate responses. SelectLLM employs a multi-label classifier and policy based on the classifier's predictions and confidence scores in selecting an optimal, query-aware, and lightweight subset of LLMs. Our findings indicate that the proposed model outperforms existing ensemble-based baselines and achieves competitive performance with similarly sized top-performing LLMs while maintaining efficiency. Specifically, it achieves a huge reduction in inference latency on two challenging reasoning benchmarks: 13% on GSM8K and 70% on MMLU, compared to the top-performing baselines. Also, we establish a theoretical upper bound by an oracle with LLMs and explore in-depth linguistic analysis to understand the performance gap between Oracle and SelectLLM.

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T04:46:07Z

**Summary**: Literature research, vital for scientific work, faces the challenge of surging information volumes exceeding researchers' processing capabilities. We present an automated review generation method based on large language models (LLMs) to overcome efficiency bottlenecks and reduce cognitive load. Our statistically validated evaluation framework demonstrates that the generated reviews match or exceed manual quality, offering broad applicability across research fields without requiring users' domain knowledge. Applied to propane dehydrogenation (PDH) catalysts, our method swiftly analyzed 343 articles, averaging seconds per article per LLM account, producing comprehensive reviews spanning 35 topics, with extended analysis of 1041 articles providing insights into catalysts' properties. Through multi-layered quality control, we effectively mitigated LLMs' hallucinations, with expert verification confirming accuracy and citation integrity while demonstrating hallucination risks reduced to below 0.5\% with 95\% confidence. Released Windows application enables one-click review generation, enhancing research productivity and literature recommendation efficiency while setting the stage for broader scientific explorations.

### In-Context Learning with Iterative Demonstration Selection
**Authors**: Chengwei Qin, Aston Zhang, Chen Chen, Anirudh Dagar, Wenming Ye

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T04:27:05Z

**Summary**: Spurred by advancements in scale, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong few-shot learning ability via in-context learning (ICL). However, the performance of ICL has been shown to be highly sensitive to the selection of few-shot demonstrations. Selecting the most suitable examples as context remains an ongoing challenge and an open problem. Existing literature has highlighted the importance of selecting examples that are diverse or semantically similar to the test sample while ignoring the fact that the optimal selection dimension, i.e., diversity or similarity, is task-specific. Based on how the test sample is answered, we propose Iterative Demonstration Selection (IDS) to leverage the merits of both dimensions. Using zero-shot chain-of-thought reasoning (Zero-shot-CoT), IDS iteratively selects examples that are diverse but still strongly correlated with the test sample as ICL demonstrations. Specifically, IDS applies Zero-shot-CoT to the test sample before demonstration selection. The output reasoning path is then used to choose demonstrations that are prepended to the test sample for inference. The generated answer is followed by its corresponding reasoning path for extracting a new set of demonstrations in the next iteration. After several iterations, IDS adopts majority voting to obtain the final result. Through extensive experiments on tasks including reasoning, question answering, and topic classification, we demonstrate that IDS can consistently outperform existing ICL demonstration selection methods.

### LLM-assisted Vector Similarity Search
**Authors**: Md Riyadh, Muqi Li, Felix Haryanto Lie, Jia Long Loh, Haotian Mi, Sayam Bohra

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T04:15:42Z

**Summary**: As data retrieval demands become increasingly complex, traditional search methods often fall short in addressing nuanced and conceptual queries. Vector similarity search has emerged as a promising technique for finding semantically similar information efficiently. However, its effectiveness diminishes when handling intricate queries with contextual nuances. This paper explores a hybrid approach combining vector similarity search with Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance search accuracy and relevance. The proposed two-step solution first employs vector similarity search to shortlist potential matches, followed by an LLM for context-aware ranking of the results. Experiments on structured datasets demonstrate that while vector similarity search alone performs well for straightforward queries, the LLM-assisted approach excels in processing complex queries involving constraints, negations, or conceptual requirements. By leveraging the natural language understanding capabilities of LLMs, this method improves the accuracy of search results for complex tasks without sacrificing efficiency. We also discuss real-world applications and propose directions for future research to refine and scale this technique for diverse datasets and use cases.

### Memorization Over Reasoning? Exposing and Mitigating Verbatim   Memorization in Large Language Models' Character Understanding Evaluation
**Authors**: Yuxuan Jiang, Francis Ferraro

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T04:09:29Z

**Summary**: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in character understanding tasks, such as analyzing the roles, personalities, and relationships of fictional characters. However, the extensive pre-training corpora used by LLMs raise concerns that they may rely on memorizing popular fictional works rather than genuinely understanding and reasoning about them. In this work, we argue that 'gist memory'-capturing essential meaning - should be the primary mechanism for character understanding tasks, as opposed to 'verbatim memory' - exact match of a string. We introduce a simple yet effective method to mitigate mechanized memorization in character understanding evaluations while preserving the essential implicit cues needed for comprehension and reasoning. Our approach reduces memorization-driven performance on popular fictional works from 96% accuracy to 72% and results in up to an 18% drop in accuracy across various character understanding tasks. These findings underscore the issue of data contamination in existing benchmarks, which often measure memorization rather than true character understanding.

### UBER: Uncertainty-Based Evolution with Large Language Models for   Automatic Heuristic Design
**Authors**: Zijie Chen, Zhanchao Zhou, Yu Lu, Renjun Xu, Lili Pan, Zhenzhong Lan

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T04:05:22Z

**Summary**: NP-hard problem-solving traditionally relies on heuristics, but manually crafting effective heuristics for complex problems remains challenging. While recent work like FunSearch has demonstrated that large language models (LLMs) can be leveraged for heuristic design in evolutionary algorithm (EA) frameworks, their potential is not fully realized due to its deficiency in exploitation and exploration. We present UBER (Uncertainty-Based Evolution for Refinement), a method that enhances LLM+EA methods for automatic heuristic design by integrating uncertainty on top of the FunSearch framework. UBER introduces two key innovations: an Uncertainty-Inclusive Evolution Process (UIEP) for adaptive exploration-exploitation balance, and a principled Uncertainty-Inclusive Island Reset (UIIS) strategy for maintaining population diversity. Through extensive experiments on challenging NP-complete problems, UBER demonstrates significant improvements over FunSearch. Our work provides a new direction for the synergy of LLMs and EA, advancing the field of automatic heuristic design.

### Learning to Rank Pre-trained Vision-Language Models for Downstream Tasks
**Authors**: Yuhe Ding, Bo Jiang, Aihua Zheng, Qin Xu, Jian Liang

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T03:26:53Z

**Summary**: Vision language models (VLMs) like CLIP show stellar zero-shot capability on classification benchmarks. However, selecting the VLM with the highest performance on the unlabeled downstream task is non-trivial. Existing VLM selection methods focus on the class-name-only setting, relying on a supervised large-scale dataset and large language models, which may not be accessible or feasible during deployment. This paper introduces the problem of \textbf{unsupervised vision-language model selection}, where only unsupervised downstream datasets are available, with no additional information provided. To solve this problem, we propose a method termed Visual-tExtual Graph Alignment (VEGA), to select VLMs without any annotations by measuring the alignment of the VLM between the two modalities on the downstream task. VEGA is motivated by the pretraining paradigm of VLMs, which aligns features with the same semantics from the visual and textual modalities, thereby mapping both modalities into a shared representation space. Specifically, we first construct two graphs on the vision and textual features, respectively. VEGA is then defined as the overall similarity between the visual and textual graphs at both node and edge levels. Extensive experiments across three different benchmarks, covering a variety of application scenarios and downstream datasets, demonstrate that VEGA consistently provides reliable and accurate estimates of VLMs' performance on unlabeled downstream tasks.

### Align Attention Heads Before Merging Them: An Effective Way for   Converting MHA to GQA
**Authors**: Qingyun Jin, Xiaohui Song, Feng Zhou, Zengchang Qin

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T03:05:45Z

**Summary**: Large language models have been shown to perform well on a variety of natural language processing problems. However, as the model size and the input sequence's length increase, the rapid increase of KV Cache significantly slows down inference speed. Therefore GQA model, as an alternative to MHA model, has been widely introduced into LLMs. In this work, we propose a low-cost method for pruning MHA models into GQA models with any compression ratio of key-value heads. Our method is based on $\mathit{L_0}$ masks to gradually remove redundant parameters. In addition, we apply orthogonal transformations to attention heads without changing the model to increase similarity between attention heads before pruning training, in order to further improve performance of the model. Our method can be compatible with rotary position embedding (RoPE), which means the model after training can be fully adapted to the mainstream standard GQA framework. Experiments demonstrate that our strategy can compress up to 87.5% of key-value heads of the LLaMA2-7B model without too much performance degradation, just achieved through supervised fine-tuning.

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T03:00:30Z

**Summary**: Building on the foundations of language modeling in natural language processing, Next Token Prediction (NTP) has evolved into a versatile training objective for machine learning tasks across various modalities, achieving considerable success. As Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced to unify understanding and generation tasks within the textual modality, recent research has shown that tasks from different modalities can also be effectively encapsulated within the NTP framework, transforming the multimodal information into tokens and predict the next one given the context. This survey introduces a comprehensive taxonomy that unifies both understanding and generation within multimodal learning through the lens of NTP. The proposed taxonomy covers five key aspects: Multimodal tokenization, MMNTP model architectures, unified task representation, datasets \& evaluation, and open challenges. This new taxonomy aims to aid researchers in their exploration of multimodal intelligence.

### Enhancing Table Recognition with Vision LLMs: A Benchmark and   Neighbor-Guided Toolchain Reasoner
**Authors**: Yitong Zhou, Mingyue Cheng, Qingyang Mao, Qi Liu, Feiyang Xu, Xin Li, Enhong Chen

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T02:40:19Z

**Summary**: Pre-trained foundation models have recently significantly progressed in structured table understanding and reasoning. However, despite advancements in areas such as table semantic understanding and table question answering, recognizing the structure and content of unstructured tables using Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) remains under-explored. In this work, we address this research gap by employing VLLMs in a training-free reasoning paradigm. First, we design a benchmark with various hierarchical dimensions relevant to table recognition. Subsequently, we conduct in-depth evaluations using pre-trained VLLMs, finding that low-quality image input is a significant bottleneck in the recognition process. Drawing inspiration from these findings, we propose the Neighbor-Guided Toolchain Reasoner (NGTR) framework, which is characterized by integrating multiple lightweight models for low-level visual processing operations aimed at mitigating issues with low-quality input images. Specifically, we utilize a neighbor retrieval mechanism to guide the generation of multiple tool invocation plans, transferring tool selection experiences from similar neighbors to the given input, thereby facilitating suitable tool selection. Additionally, we introduce a reflection module to supervise the tool invocation process. Extensive experiments on public table recognition datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances the recognition capabilities of the vanilla VLLMs. We believe that the designed benchmark and the proposed NGTR framework could provide an alternative solution in table recognition.

### Large-scale moral machine experiment on large language models
**Authors**: Muhammad Shahrul Zaim bin Ahmad, Kazuhiro Takemoto

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T02:14:18Z

**Summary**: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their potential integration into autonomous driving systems necessitates understanding their moral decision-making capabilities. While our previous study examined four prominent LLMs using the Moral Machine experimental framework, the dynamic landscape of LLM development demands a more comprehensive analysis. Here, we evaluate moral judgments across 52 different LLMs, including multiple versions of proprietary models (GPT, Claude, Gemini) and open-source alternatives (Llama, Gemma), to assess their alignment with human moral preferences in autonomous driving scenarios. Using a conjoint analysis framework, we evaluated how closely LLM responses aligned with human preferences in ethical dilemmas and examined the effects of model size, updates, and architecture. Results showed that proprietary models and open-source models exceeding 10 billion parameters demonstrated relatively close alignment with human judgments, with a significant negative correlation between model size and distance from human judgments in open-source models. However, model updates did not consistently improve alignment with human preferences, and many LLMs showed excessive emphasis on specific ethical principles. These findings suggest that while increasing model size may naturally lead to more human-like moral judgments, practical implementation in autonomous driving systems requires careful consideration of the trade-off between judgment quality and computational efficiency. Our comprehensive analysis provides crucial insights for the ethical design of autonomous systems and highlights the importance of considering cultural contexts in AI moral decision-making.

### Understanding Synthetic Context Extension via Retrieval Heads
**Authors**: Xinyu Zhao, Fangcong Yin, Greg Durrett

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T01:48:26Z

**Summary**: Long-context LLMs are increasingly in demand for applications such as retrieval-augmented generation. To defray the cost of pretraining LLMs over long contexts, recent work takes an approach of synthetic context extension: fine-tuning LLMs with synthetically generated long-context data in a post-training stage. However, it remains unclear how and why this synthetic context extension imparts abilities for downstream long-context tasks. In this paper, we investigate fine-tuning on synthetic data for three long-context tasks that require retrieval and reasoning. We vary the realism of "needle" concepts to be retrieved and diversity of the surrounding "haystack" context, from using LLMs to construct synthetic documents to using templated relations and creating symbolic datasets. We find that models trained on synthetic data fall short of the real data, but surprisingly, the mismatch can be interpreted and even predicted in terms of a special set of attention heads that are responsible for retrieval over long context, retrieval heads (Wu et al., 2024). The retrieval heads learned on synthetic data have high overlap with retrieval heads learned on real data, and there is a strong correlation between the recall of heads learned and the downstream performance of a model. Furthermore, with attention knockout and activation patching, we mechanistically show that retrieval heads are necessary and explain model performance, although they are not totally sufficient. Our results shed light on how to interpret synthetic data fine-tuning performance and how to approach creating better data for learning real-world capabilities over long contexts.

### Security Weaknesses of Copilot-Generated Code in GitHub Projects: An   Empirical Study
**Authors**: Yujia Fu, Peng Liang, Amjed Tahir, Zengyang Li, Mojtaba Shahin, Jiaxin Yu, Jinfu Chen

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T01:42:45Z

**Summary**: Modern code generation tools utilizing AI models like Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained increased popularity due to their ability to produce functional code. However, their usage presents security challenges, often resulting in insecure code merging into the code base. Thus, evaluating the quality of generated code, especially its security, is crucial. While prior research explored various aspects of code generation, the focus on security has been limited, mostly examining code produced in controlled environments rather than open source development scenarios. To address this gap, we conducted an empirical study, analyzing code snippets generated by GitHub Copilot and two other AI code generation tools (i.e., CodeWhisperer and Codeium) from GitHub projects. Our analysis identified 733 snippets, revealing a high likelihood of security weaknesses, with 29.5% of Python and 24.2% of JavaScript snippets affected. These issues span 43 Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) categories, including significant ones like CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values, CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code, and CWE-79: Cross-site Scripting. Notably, eight of those CWEs are among the 2023 CWE Top-25, highlighting their severity. We further examined using Copilot Chat to fix security issues in Copilot-generated code by providing Copilot Chat with warning messages from the static analysis tools, and up to 55.5% of the security issues can be fixed. We finally provide the suggestions for mitigating security issues in generated code.

### LLM-Personalize: Aligning LLM Planners with Human Preferences via   Reinforced Self-Training for Housekeeping Robots
**Authors**: Dongge Han, Trevor McInroe, Adam Jelley, Stefano V. Albrecht, Peter Bell, Amos Storkey

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T01:41:37Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have shown significant potential for robotics applications, particularly task planning, by harnessing their language comprehension and text generation capabilities. However, in applications such as household robotics, a critical gap remains in the personalization of these models to individual user preferences. We introduce LLM-Personalize, a novel framework with an optimization pipeline designed to personalize LLM planners for household robotics. Our LLM-Personalize framework features an LLM planner that performs iterative planning in multi-room, partially-observable household scenarios, making use of a scene graph constructed with local observations. The generated plan consists of a sequence of high-level actions which are subsequently executed by a controller. Central to our approach is the optimization pipeline, which combines imitation learning and iterative self-training to personalize the LLM planner. In particular, the imitation learning phase performs initial LLM alignment from demonstrations, and bootstraps the model to facilitate effective iterative self-training, which further explores and aligns the model to user preferences. We evaluate LLM-Personalize on Housekeep, a challenging simulated real-world 3D benchmark for household rearrangements, and show that LLM-Personalize achieves more than a 30 percent increase in success rate over existing LLM planners, showcasing significantly improved alignment with human preferences.

**Authors**: Mingyu Jin, Qinkai Yu, Jingyuan Huang, Qingcheng Zeng, Zhenting Wang, Wenyue Hua, Haiyan Zhao, Kai Mei, Yanda Meng, Kaize Ding, Fan Yang, Mengnan Du, Yongfeng Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T01:25:19Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performances across a wide range of tasks. However, the mechanisms by which these models encode tasks of varying complexities remain poorly understood. In this paper, we explore the hypothesis that LLMs process concepts of varying complexities in different layers, introducing the idea of ``Concept Depth'' to suggest that more complex concepts are typically acquired in deeper layers. Specifically, we categorize concepts based on their level of abstraction, defining them in the order of increasing complexity within factual, emotional, and inferential tasks. We conduct extensive probing experiments using layer-wise representations across various LLM families (Gemma, LLaMA, Qwen) on various datasets spanning the three domains of tasks. Our findings reveal that models could efficiently conduct probing for simpler tasks in shallow layers, and more complex tasks typically necessitate deeper layers for accurate understanding. Additionally, we examine how external factors, such as adding noise to the input and quantizing the model weights, might affect layer-wise representations. Our findings suggest that these factors can impede the development of a conceptual understanding of LLMs until deeper layers are explored. We hope that our proposed concept and experimental insights will enhance the understanding of the mechanisms underlying LLMs. Our codes are available at \url{https://github.com/Luckfort/CD}.

### SafeSynthDP: Leveraging Large Language Models for Privacy-Preserving   Synthetic Data Generation Using Differential Privacy
**Authors**: Md Mahadi Hasan Nahid, Sadid Bin Hasan

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T01:10:10Z

**Summary**: Machine learning (ML) models frequently rely on training data that may include sensitive or personal information, raising substantial privacy concerns. Legislative frameworks such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) have necessitated the development of strategies that preserve privacy while maintaining the utility of data. In this paper, we investigate the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate synthetic datasets integrated with Differential Privacy (DP) mechanisms, thereby enabling data-driven research and model training without direct exposure of sensitive information. Our approach incorporates DP-based noise injection methods, including Laplace and Gaussian distributions, into the data generation process. We then evaluate the utility of these DP-enhanced synthetic datasets by comparing the performance of ML models trained on them against models trained on the original data. To substantiate privacy guarantees, we assess the resilience of the generated synthetic data to membership inference attacks and related threats. The experimental results demonstrate that integrating DP within LLM-driven synthetic data generation offers a viable balance between privacy protection and data utility. This study provides a foundational methodology and insight into the privacy-preserving capabilities of LLMs, paving the way for compliant and effective ML research and applications.

### Token-Budget-Aware LLM Reasoning
**Authors**: Tingxu Han, Chunrong Fang, Shiyu Zhao, Shiqing Ma, Zhenyu Chen, Zhenting Wang

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T01:07:39Z

**Summary**: Reasoning is critical for large language models (LLMs) to excel in a wide range of tasks. While methods like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning enhance LLM performance by decomposing problems into intermediate steps, they also incur significant overhead in token usage, leading to increased costs. We find that the reasoning process of current LLMs is unnecessarily lengthy and it can be compressed by including a reasonable token budget in the prompt, but the choice of token budget plays a crucial role in the actual compression effectiveness. We then propose a token-budget-aware LLM reasoning framework, which dynamically estimates token budgets for different problems based on reasoning complexity and uses the estimated token budgets to guide the reasoning process. Experiments show that our method effectively reduces token costs in CoT reasoning with only a slight performance reduction, offering a practical solution to balance efficiency and accuracy in LLM reasoning.

### Large Language Models-guided Dynamic Adaptation for Temporal Knowledge   Graph Reasoning
**Authors**: Jiapu Wang, Kai Sun, Linhao Luo, Wei Wei, Yongli Hu, Alan Wee-Chung Liew, Shirui Pan, Baocai Yin

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T00:53:45Z

**Summary**: Temporal Knowledge Graph Reasoning (TKGR) is the process of utilizing temporal information to capture complex relations within a Temporal Knowledge Graph (TKG) to infer new knowledge. Conventional methods in TKGR typically depend on deep learning algorithms or temporal logical rules. However, deep learning-based TKGRs often lack interpretability, whereas rule-based TKGRs struggle to effectively learn temporal rules that capture temporal patterns. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated extensive knowledge and remarkable proficiency in temporal reasoning. Consequently, the employment of LLMs for Temporal Knowledge Graph Reasoning (TKGR) has sparked increasing interest among researchers. Nonetheless, LLMs are known to function as black boxes, making it challenging to comprehend their reasoning process. Additionally, due to the resource-intensive nature of fine-tuning, promptly updating LLMs to integrate evolving knowledge within TKGs for reasoning is impractical. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose a Large Language Models-guided Dynamic Adaptation (LLM-DA) method for reasoning on TKGs. Specifically, LLM-DA harnesses the capabilities of LLMs to analyze historical data and extract temporal logical rules. These rules unveil temporal patterns and facilitate interpretable reasoning. To account for the evolving nature of TKGs, a dynamic adaptation strategy is proposed to update the LLM-generated rules with the latest events. This ensures that the extracted rules always incorporate the most recent knowledge and better generalize to the predictions on future events. Experimental results show that without the need of fine-tuning, LLM-DA significantly improves the accuracy of reasoning over several common datasets, providing a robust framework for TKGR tasks.

### NetFlowGen: Leveraging Generative Pre-training for Network Traffic   Dynamics
**Authors**: Jiawei Zhou, Woojeong Kim, Zhiying Xu, Alexander M. Rush, Minlan Yu

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T00:47:49Z

**Summary**: Understanding the traffic dynamics in networks is a core capability for automated systems to monitor and analyze networking behaviors, reducing expensive human efforts and economic risks through tasks such as traffic classification, congestion prediction, and attack detection. However, it is still challenging to accurately model network traffic with machine learning approaches in an efficient and broadly applicable manner. Task-specific models trained from scratch are used for different networking applications, which limits the efficiency of model development and generalization of model deployment. Furthermore, while networking data is abundant, high-quality task-specific labels are often insufficient for training individual models. Large-scale self-supervised learning on unlabeled data provides a natural pathway for tackling these challenges. We propose to pre-train a general-purpose machine learning model to capture traffic dynamics with only traffic data from NetFlow records, with the goal of fine-tuning for different downstream tasks with small amount of labels. Our presented NetFlowGen framework goes beyond a proof-of-concept for network traffic pre-training and addresses specific challenges such as unifying network feature representations, learning from large unlabeled traffic data volume, and testing on real downstream tasks in DDoS attack detection. Experiments demonstrate promising results of our pre-training framework on capturing traffic dynamics and adapting to different networking tasks.

### EVOLVE: Emotion and Visual Output Learning via LLM Evaluation
**Authors**: Jordan Sinclair, Christopher Reardon

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T00:43:31Z

**Summary**: Human acceptance of social robots is greatly effected by empathy and perceived understanding. This necessitates accurate and flexible responses to various input data from the user. While systems such as this can become increasingly complex as more states or response types are included, new research in the application of large language models towards human-robot interaction has allowed for more streamlined perception and reaction pipelines. LLM-selected actions and emotional expressions can help reinforce the realism of displayed empathy and allow for improved communication between the robot and user. Beyond portraying empathy in spoken or written responses, this shows the possibilities of using LLMs in actuated, real world scenarios. In this work we extend research in LLM-driven nonverbal behavior for social robots by considering more open-ended emotional response selection leveraging new advances in vision-language models, along with emotionally aligned motion and color pattern selections that strengthen conveyance of meaning and empathy.

### Academic collaboration on large language model studies increases overall   but varies across disciplines
**Authors**: Lingyao Li, Ly Dinh, Songhua Hu, Libby Hemphill

**Updated**: 2024-12-30T00:27:42Z

**Summary**: Interdisciplinary collaboration is crucial for addressing complex scientific challenges. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown significant potential in benefiting researchers across various fields. To explore their potential for interdisciplinary collaboration, we collect and analyze data from OpenAlex, an open-source academic database. Our dataset comprises 59,293 LLM-related papers, along with 70,945 machine learning (ML) papers and 73,110 papers from non-LLM/ML fields as control groups. We first employ Shannon Entropy to assess the diversity of collaboration. Our results reveal that many fields have exhibited a more significant increasing trend following the release of ChatGPT as compared to the control groups. In particular, Computer Science and Social Science display a consistent increase in both institution and department entropy. Other fields such as Decision Science, Psychology, and Health Professions have shown minor to significant increases. Our difference-in-difference analysis also indicates that the release of ChatGPT leads to a statistically significant increase in collaboration in several fields, such as Computer Science and Social Science. In addition, we analyze the author networks and find that Computer Science, Medicine, and other Computer Science-related departments are the most prominent. Regarding authors' institutions, our analysis reveals that entities such as Stanford University, Harvard University, and University College London are key players, either dominating centrality or playing crucial roles in connecting research networks. Overall, this study provides valuable information on the current landscape and evolving dynamics of collaboration networks in LLM research. It also suggests potential areas for fostering more diverse collaborations and highlights the need for continued research on the impact of LLMs on scientific practices.

### FreqMixFormerV2: Lightweight Frequency-aware Mixed Transformer for Human   Skeleton Action Recognition
**Authors**: Wenhan Wu, Pengfei Wang, Chen Chen, Aidong Lu

**Updated**: 2024-12-29T23:52:40Z

**Summary**: Transformer-based human skeleton action recognition has been developed for years. However, the complexity and high parameter count demands of these models hinder their practical applications, especially in resource-constrained environments. In this work, we propose FreqMixForemrV2, which was built upon the Frequency-aware Mixed Transformer (FreqMixFormer) for identifying subtle and discriminative actions with pioneered frequency-domain analysis. We design a lightweight architecture that maintains robust performance while significantly reducing the model complexity. This is achieved through a redesigned frequency operator that optimizes high-frequency and low-frequency parameter adjustments, and a simplified frequency-aware attention module. These improvements result in a substantial reduction in model parameters, enabling efficient deployment with only a minimal sacrifice in accuracy. Comprehensive evaluations of standard datasets (NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, and NW-UCLA datasets) demonstrate that the proposed model achieves a superior balance between efficiency and accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art methods with only 60% of the parameters.

**Authors**: Yulin Fei, Yuhui Gao, Xingyuan Xian, Xiaojin Zhang, Tao Wu, Wei Chen

**Updated**: 2024-12-29T23:20:01Z

**Summary**: With the rise of multimodal large language models, accurately extracting and understanding textual information from video content, referred to as video based optical character recognition (Video OCR), has become a crucial capability. This paper introduces a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the video OCR performance of multi-modal models in videos. Comprising 1,028 videos and 2,961 question-answer pairs, this benchmark proposes several key challenges through 6 distinct subtasks: (1) Recognition of text content itself and its basic visual attributes, (2)Semantic and Spatial Comprehension of OCR objects in videos (3) Dynamic Motion detection and Temporal Localization. We developed this benchmark using a semi-automated approach that integrates the OCR ability of image LLMs with manual refinement, balancing efficiency, cost, and data quality. Our resource aims to help advance research in video LLMs and underscores the need for improving OCR ability for video LLMs. The benchmark will be released on https://github.com/YuHuiGao/FG-Bench.git.

### NLP-based Regulatory Compliance -- Using GPT 4.0 to Decode Regulatory   Documents
**Authors**: Bimal Kumar, Dmitri Roussinov

**Updated**: 2024-12-29T22:14:59Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4.0 have shown significant promise in addressing the semantic complexities of regulatory documents, particularly in detecting inconsistencies and contradictions. This study evaluates GPT-4.0's ability to identify conflicts within regulatory requirements by analyzing a curated corpus with artificially injected ambiguities and contradictions, designed in collaboration with architects and compliance engineers. Using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score, the experiment demonstrates GPT-4.0's effectiveness in detecting inconsistencies, with findings validated by human experts. The results highlight the potential of LLMs to enhance regulatory compliance processes, though further testing with larger datasets and domain-specific fine-tuning is needed to maximize accuracy and practical applicability. Future work will explore automated conflict resolution and real-world implementation through pilot projects with industry partners.

### Controlling Out-of-Domain Gaps in LLMs for Genre Classification and   Generated Text Detection
**Authors**: Dmitri Roussinov, Serge Sharoff, Nadezhda Puchnina

**Updated**: 2024-12-29T21:54:39Z

**Summary**: This study demonstrates that the modern generation of Large Language Models (LLMs, such as GPT-4) suffers from the same out-of-domain (OOD) performance gap observed in prior research on pre-trained Language Models (PLMs, such as BERT). We demonstrate this across two non-topical classification tasks: 1) genre classification and 2) generated text detection. Our results show that when demonstration examples for In-Context Learning (ICL) come from one domain (e.g., travel) and the system is tested on another domain (e.g., history), classification performance declines significantly.   To address this, we introduce a method that controls which predictive indicators are used and which are excluded during classification. For the two tasks studied here, this ensures that topical features are omitted, while the model is guided to focus on stylistic rather than content-based attributes. This approach reduces the OOD gap by up to 20 percentage points in a few-shot setup. Straightforward Chain-of-Thought (CoT) methods, used as the baseline, prove insufficient, while our approach consistently enhances domain transfer performance.

### Pirates of the RAG: Adaptively Attacking LLMs to Leak Knowledge Bases
**Authors**: Christian Di Maio, Cristian Cosci, Marco Maggini, Valentina Poggioni, Stefano Melacci

**Updated**: 2024-12-29T21:25:04Z

**Summary**: The growing ubiquity of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems in several real-world services triggers severe concerns about their security. A RAG system improves the generative capabilities of a Large Language Models (LLM) by a retrieval mechanism which operates on a private knowledge base, whose unintended exposure could lead to severe consequences, including breaches of private and sensitive information. This paper presents a black-box attack to force a RAG system to leak its private knowledge base which, differently from existing approaches, is adaptive and automatic. A relevance-based mechanism and an attacker-side open-source LLM favor the generation of effective queries to leak most of the (hidden) knowledge base. Extensive experimentation proves the quality of the proposed algorithm in different RAG pipelines and domains, comparing to very recent related approaches, which turn out to be either not fully black-box, not adaptive, or not based on open-source models. The findings from our study remark the urgent need for more robust privacy safeguards in the design and deployment of RAG systems.

### Towards Neural No-Resource Language Translation: A Comparative   Evaluation of Approaches
**Authors**: Madhavendra Thakur

**Updated**: 2024-12-29T21:12:39Z

**Summary**: No-resource languages - those with minimal or no digital representation - pose unique challenges for machine translation (MT). Unlike low-resource languages, which rely on limited but existent corpora, no-resource languages often have fewer than 100 sentences available for training. This work explores the problem of no-resource translation through three distinct workflows: fine-tuning of translation-specific models, in-context learning with large language models (LLMs) using chain-of-reasoning prompting, and direct prompting without reasoning. Using Owens Valley Paiute as a case study, we demonstrate that no-resource translation demands fundamentally different approaches from low-resource scenarios, as traditional approaches to machine translation, such as those that work for low-resource languages, fail. Empirical results reveal that, although traditional approaches fail, the in-context learning capabilities of general-purpose large language models enable no-resource language translation that outperforms low-resource translation approaches and rivals human translations (BLEU 0.45-0.6); specifically, chain-of-reasoning prompting outperforms other methods for larger corpora, while direct prompting exhibits advantages in smaller datasets. As these approaches are language-agnostic, they have potential to be generalized to translation tasks from a wide variety of no-resource languages without expert input. These findings establish no-resource translation as a distinct paradigm requiring innovative solutions, providing practical and theoretical insights for language preservation.

### Counterfactual Samples Constructing and Training for Commonsense   Statements Estimation
**Authors**: Chong Liu, Zaiwen Feng, Lin Liu, Zhenyun Deng, Jiuyong Li, Ruifang Zhai, Debo Cheng, Li Qin

**Updated**: 2024-12-29T20:18:52Z

**Summary**: Plausibility Estimation (PE) plays a crucial role for enabling language models to objectively comprehend the real world. While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in PE tasks but sometimes produce trivial commonsense errors due to the complexity of commonsense knowledge. They lack two key traits of an ideal PE model: a) Language-explainable: relying on critical word segments for decisions, and b) Commonsense-sensitive: detecting subtle linguistic variations in commonsense. To address these issues, we propose a novel model-agnostic method, referred to as Commonsense Counterfactual Samples Generating (CCSG). By training PE models with CCSG, we encourage them to focus on critical words, thereby enhancing both their language-explainable and commonsense-sensitive capabilities. Specifically, CCSG generates counterfactual samples by strategically replacing key words and introducing low-level dropout within sentences. These counterfactual samples are then incorporated into a sentence-level contrastive training framework to further enhance the model's learning process. Experimental results across nine diverse datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of CCSG in addressing commonsense reasoning challenges, with our CCSG method showing 3.07% improvement against the SOTA methods.

### An Efficient Matrix Multiplication Algorithm for Accelerating Inference   in Binary and Ternary Neural Networks
**Authors**: Mohsen Dehghankar, Mahdi Erfanian, Abolfazl Asudeh

**Updated**: 2024-12-29T18:43:04Z

**Summary**: Despite their tremendous success and versatility, Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from inference inefficiency while relying on advanced computational infrastructure. To address these challenges and make LLMs more accessible and cost-effective, in this paper, we propose algorithms to improve the inference time and memory efficiency of 1.58-bit LLMs with ternary weight matrices. Particularly focusing on matrix multiplication as the bottle-neck operation of inference, we observe that, once trained, the weight matrices of a model no longer change. This allows us to preprocess these matrices and create indices that help reduce the storage requirements by a logarithmic factor while enabling our efficient inference algorithms. Specifically, for a $n$ by $n$ weight matrix, our efficient algorithm guarantees a time complexity of $O(\frac{n^2}{\log n})$, a logarithmic factor improvement over the standard $O(n^2)$ vector-matrix multiplication. Besides theoretical analysis, we conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the practical efficiency of our algorithms. Our results confirm the superiority of the approach both with respect to time and memory, as we observed a reduction in inference time up to 29x and memory usage up to 6x.

### The Impact of Prompt Programming on Function-Level Code Generation
**Authors**: Ranim Khojah, Francisco Gomes de Oliveira Neto, Mazen Mohamad, Philipp Leitner

**Updated**: 2024-12-29T18:34:10Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used by software engineers for code generation. However, limitations of LLMs such as irrelevant or incorrect code have highlighted the need for prompt programming (or prompt engineering) where engineers apply specific prompt techniques (e.g., chain-of-thought or input-output examples) to improve the generated code. Despite this, the impact of different prompt techniques -- and their combinations -- on code generation remains underexplored. In this study, we introduce CodePromptEval, a dataset of 7072 prompts designed to evaluate five prompt techniques (few-shot, persona, chain-of-thought, function signature, list of packages) and their effect on the correctness, similarity, and quality of complete functions generated by three LLMs (GPT-4o, Llama3, and Mistral). Our findings show that while certain prompt techniques significantly influence the generated code, combining multiple techniques does not necessarily improve the outcome. Additionally, we observed a trade-off between correctness and quality when using prompt techniques. Our dataset and replication package enable future research on improving LLM-generated code and evaluating new prompt techniques.

### Real-time Fake News from Adversarial Feedback
**Authors**: Sanxing Chen, Yukun Huang, Bhuwan Dhingra

**Updated**: 2024-12-29T18:22:27Z

**Summary**: We show that existing evaluations for fake news detection based on conventional sources, such as claims on fact-checking websites, result in high accuracies over time for LLM-based detectors -- even after their knowledge cutoffs. This suggests that recent popular fake news from such sources can be easily detected due to pre-training and retrieval corpus contamination or increasingly salient shallow patterns. Instead, we argue that a proper fake news detection dataset should test a model's ability to reason factually about the current world by retrieving and reading related evidence. To this end, we develop a novel pipeline that leverages natural language feedback from a RAG-based detector to iteratively modify real-time news into deceptive fake news that challenges LLMs. Our iterative rewrite decreases the binary classification ROC-AUC by an absolute 17.5 percent for a strong RAG-based GPT-4o detector. Our experiments reveal the important role of RAG in both detecting and generating fake news, as retrieval-free LLM detectors are vulnerable to unseen events and adversarial attacks, while feedback from RAG detection helps discover more deceitful patterns in fake news.

**Updated**: 2024-12-29T17:38:32Z

**Summary**: The burgeoning field of Large Language Models (LLMs), exemplified by sophisticated models like OpenAI's ChatGPT, represents a significant advancement in artificial intelligence. These models, however, bring forth substantial challenges in the high consumption of computational, memory, energy, and financial resources, especially in environments with limited resource capabilities. This survey aims to systematically address these challenges by reviewing a broad spectrum of techniques designed to enhance the resource efficiency of LLMs. We categorize methods based on their optimization focus: computational, memory, energy, financial, and network resources and their applicability across various stages of an LLM's lifecycle, including architecture design, pretraining, finetuning, and system design. Additionally, the survey introduces a nuanced categorization of resource efficiency techniques by their specific resource types, which uncovers the intricate relationships and mappings between various resources and corresponding optimization techniques. A standardized set of evaluation metrics and datasets is also presented to facilitate consistent and fair comparisons across different models and techniques. By offering a comprehensive overview of the current sota and identifying open research avenues, this survey serves as a foundational reference for researchers and practitioners, aiding them in developing more sustainable and efficient LLMs in a rapidly evolving landscape.

### Planning, Living and Judging: A Multi-agent LLM-based Framework for   Cyclical Urban Planning
**Authors**: Hang Ni, Yuzhi Wang, Hao Liu

**Updated**: 2024-12-29T15:43:25Z

**Summary**: Urban regeneration presents significant challenges within the context of urbanization, requiring adaptive approaches to tackle evolving needs. Leveraging advancements in large language models (LLMs), we propose Cyclical Urban Planning (CUP), a new paradigm that continuously generates, evaluates, and refines urban plans in a closed-loop. Specifically, our multi-agent LLM-based framework consists of three key components: (1) Planning, where LLM agents generate and refine urban plans based on contextual data; (2) Living, where agents simulate the behaviors and interactions of residents, modeling life in the urban environment; and (3) Judging, which involves evaluating plan effectiveness and providing iterative feedback for improvement. The cyclical process enables a dynamic and responsive planning approach. Experiments on the real-world dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework as a continuous and adaptive planning process.

### ReTaKe: Reducing Temporal and Knowledge Redundancy for Long Video   Understanding
**Authors**: Xiao Wang, Qingyi Si, Jianlong Wu, Shiyu Zhu, Li Cao, Liqiang Nie

**Updated**: 2024-12-29T15:42:24Z

**Summary**: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in video understanding. However, existing VideoLLMs often inherit the limitations of their backbone LLMs in handling long sequences, leading to challenges for long video understanding. Common solutions either simply uniformly sample videos' frames or compress visual tokens, which focus primarily on low-level temporal visual redundancy, overlooking high-level knowledge redundancy. This limits the achievable compression rate with minimal loss. To this end. we introduce a training-free method, $\textbf{ReTaKe}$, containing two novel modules DPSelect and PivotKV, to jointly model and reduce both temporal visual redundancy and knowledge redundancy for long video understanding. Specifically, DPSelect identifies keyframes with local maximum peak distance based on their visual features, which are closely aligned with human video perception. PivotKV employs the obtained keyframes as pivots and conducts KV-Cache compression for the non-pivot tokens with low attention scores, which are derived from the learned prior knowledge of LLMs. Experiments on benchmarks VideoMME, MLVU, and LVBench, show that ReTaKe can support 4x longer video sequences with minimal performance loss (<1%) and outperform all similar-size VideoLLMs with 3%-5%, even surpassing or on par with much larger ones.
