 ### Collaborative Coded Caching for Partially Connected Networks
**Authors**: Kagan Akcay, Eleftherios Lampiris, MohammadJavad Salehi, Giuseppe Caire

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T13:55:21Z

**Summary**: Coded caching leverages the differences in user cache memories to achieve gains that scale with the total cache size, alleviating network congestion due to high-quality content requests. Additionally, distributing transmitters over a wide area can mitigate the adverse effects of path loss. In this work, we consider a partially connected network where the channel between distributed transmitters (helpers) and users is modeled as a distributed multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) Gaussian broadcast channel. We propose a novel delivery scheme consisting of two phases: partitioning and transmission. In the partitioning phase, users with identical cache profiles are partitioned into the minimum number of sets, such that users within each set can successfully decode their desired message from a joint transmission enabled by MIMO precoding. To optimally partition the users, we employ the branch and bound method. In the transmission phase, each partition is treated as a single entity, and codewords are multicast to partitions with distinct cache profiles. The proposed delivery scheme is applicable to any partially connected network, and while the partitioning is optimal, the overall delivery scheme, including transmission, is heuristic. Interestingly, simulation results show that its performance closely approximates that of the fully connected optimal solution.

### HarmoniCa: Harmonizing Training and Inference for Better Feature Caching   in Diffusion Transformer Acceleration
**Authors**: Yushi Huang, Zining Wang, Ruihao Gong, Jing Liu, Xinjie Zhang, Jinyang Guo, Xianglong Liu, Jun Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T11:29:31Z

**Summary**: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) excel in generative tasks but face practical deployment challenges due to high inference costs. Feature caching, which stores and retrieves redundant computations, offers the potential for acceleration. Existing learning-based caching, though adaptive, overlooks the impact of the prior timestep. It also suffers from misaligned objectives--aligned predicted noise vs. high-quality images--between training and inference. These two discrepancies compromise both performance and efficiency. To this end, we harmonize training and inference with a novel learning-based caching framework dubbed HarmoniCa. It first incorporates Step-Wise Denoising Training (SDT) to ensure the continuity of the denoising process, where prior steps can be leveraged. In addition, an Image Error Proxy-Guided Objective (IEPO) is applied to balance image quality against cache utilization through an efficient proxy to approximate the image error. Extensive experiments across $8$ models, $4$ samplers, and resolutions from $256\times256$ to $2K$ demonstrate superior performance and speedup of our framework. For instance, it achieves over $40\%$ latency reduction (i.e., $2.07\times$ theoretical speedup) and improved performance on PixArt-$\alpha$. Remarkably, our image-free approach reduces training time by $25\%$ compared with the previous method. Our code is available at https://github.com/ModelTC/HarmoniCa.

### CaGR-RAG: Context-aware Query Grouping for Disk-based Vector Search in   RAG Systems
**Authors**: Yeonwoo Jeong, Kyuli Park, Hyunji Cho, Sungyong Park

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T10:13:12Z

**Summary**: Modern embedding models capture both semantic and syntactic structures of queries, often mapping different queries to similar regions in vector space. This results in non-uniform cluster access patterns in disk-based vector search systems, particularly in Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) framework. While existing approaches optimize individual queries, they overlook the impact of cluster access patterns, failing to account for the locality effects of queries that access similar clusters. This oversight reduces cache efficiency and increases search latency due to excessive disk I/O. To address this, we introduce CaGR-RAG, a context-aware query grouping mechanism that organizes queries based on shared cluster access patterns. Additionally, it incorporates opportunistic cluster prefetching to minimize cache misses during transitions between query groups, further optimizing retrieval performance. Experimental results show that CaGR-RAG reduces 99th percentile tail latency by up to 51.55% while consistently maintaining a higher cache hit ratio than the baseline.

**Summary**: A critical element in the realization of large liquid and gas time projection chambers (TPCs) is the delivery and distribution of high voltages into and around the detector. Such experiments require of order tens of kilovolts to enable electron drift over meter-scale distances. This paper describes the design and operation of the cathode feedthrough and high voltage distribution through the field cage of the NEXT-100 experiment, an underground TPC that will search for neutrinoless double beta decay $0\nu\beta\beta$. The feedthrough has been demonstrated to hold pressures up to 20~bar and sustain voltages as high as -65~kV, and the TPC is operating stably at its design high voltages. The system has been realized within the constraints of a stringent radiopurity budget and is now being used to execute a suite of sensitive double beta decay analyses.

### The Open-Source BlackParrot-BedRock Cache Coherence System
**Authors**: Mark Unruh Wyse

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T02:36:23Z

**Summary**: This dissertation revisits the topic of programmable cache coherence engines in the context of modern shared-memory multicore processors. First, the open-source BedRock cache coherence protocol is described. BedRock employs the canonical MOESIF coherence states and reduces implementation burden by eliminating transient coherence states from the protocol. The protocol's design complexity, concurrency, and verification effort are analyzed and compared to a canonical directory-based invalidate coherence protocol. Second, the architecture and microarchitecture of three separate cache coherence directories implementing the BedRock protocol within the BlackParrot 64-bit RISC-V multicore processor, collectively called BlackParrot-BedRock (BP-BedRock), are described. A fixed-function coherence directory engine implementation provides a baseline design for performance and area comparisons. A microcode-programmable coherence directory implementation demonstrates the feasibility of implementing a programmable coherence engine capable of maintaining sufficient protocol processing performance. A hybrid fixed-function and programmable coherence directory blends the protocol processing performance of the fixed-function design with the programmable flexibility of the microcode-programmable design. Collectively, the BedRock coherence protocol and its three BP-BedRock implementations demonstrate the feasibility and challenges of including programmable logic within the coherence system of modern shared-memory multicore processors, paving the way for future research into the application- and system-level benefits of programmable coherence engines.

### Heterogeneous Memory Benchmarking Toolkit
**Authors**: Golsana Ghaemi, Kazem Taram, Renato Mancuso

**Updated**: 2025-05-01T22:32:29Z

**Summary**: This paper presents an open-source kernel-level heterogeneous memory characterization framework (MemScope) for embedded systems that enables users to understand and precisely characterize the temporal behavior of all available memory modules under configurable contention stress scenarios. Since kernel-level provides a high degree of control over allocation, cache maintenance, $CPUs$, interrupts, and I/O device activity, seeking the most accurate way to benchmark heterogeneous memory subsystems, would be achieved by implementing it in the kernel. This gives us the privilege to directly map pieces of contiguous physical memory and instantiate allocators, allowing us to finely control cores to create and eliminate interference. Additionally, we can minimize noise and interruptions, guaranteeing more consistent and precise results compared to equivalent user-space solutions. Running our Framework on a Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ ZCU102 CPU_FPGA platform, demonstrates its capability to precisely benchmark bandwidth and latency across various memory types, including PL-side DRAM and BRAM, in a multi-core system.

### Spill The Beans: Exploiting CPU Cache Side-Channels to Leak Tokens from   Large Language Models
**Authors**: Andrew Adiletta, Berk Sunar

**Updated**: 2025-05-01T19:18:56Z

**Summary**: Side-channel attacks on shared hardware resources increasingly threaten confidentiality, especially with the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs). In this work, we introduce Spill The Beans, a novel application of cache side-channels to leak tokens generated by an LLM. By co-locating an attack process on the same hardware as the victim model, we flush and reload embedding vectors from the embedding layer, where each token corresponds to a unique embedding vector. When accessed during token generation, it results in a cache hit detectable by our attack on shared lower-level caches.   A significant challenge is the massive size of LLMs, which, by nature of their compute intensive operation, quickly evicts embedding vectors from the cache. We address this by balancing the number of tokens monitored against the amount of information leaked. Monitoring more tokens increases potential vocabulary leakage but raises the chance of missing cache hits due to eviction; monitoring fewer tokens improves detection reliability but limits vocabulary coverage.   Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate the feasibility of leaking tokens from LLMs via cache side-channels. Our findings reveal a new vulnerability in LLM deployments, highlighting that even sophisticated models are susceptible to traditional side-channel attacks. We discuss the implications for privacy and security in LLM-serving infrastructures and suggest considerations for mitigating such threats. For proof of concept we consider two concrete attack scenarios: Our experiments show that an attacker can recover as much as 80%-90% of a high entropy API key with single shot monitoring. As for English text we can reach a 40% recovery rate with a single shot. We should note that the rate highly depends on the monitored token set and these rates can be improved by targeting more specialized output domains.

### Optomechanical resource for fault-tolerant quantum computing
**Authors**: Margaret Pavlovich, Peter Rakich, Shruti Puri

**Updated**: 2025-05-01T18:00:40Z

**Summary**: Fusion-based quantum computing with dual-rail qubits is a leading candidate for scalable quantum computing using linear optics. This paradigm requires single photons which are entangled into small resource states before being fed into a fusion network. The most common sources for single optical photons and for small entangled states are probabilistic and heralded. The realization of a single reliable deterministic source requires many redundant probabilistic sources and a complex optical network for rerouting and retiming probabilistic outputs. In this work, we show how optomechanics enables reliable production of resources for photonic quantum computing without the redundancy of the all-optical approach. This is achieved by using acoustic modes as caches of quantum resources, ranging from single-particle states to small entangled states, with on-demand read-out. The advantages of acoustic modes as optical quantum memories, compared to other technologies, include their intrinsically long lifetimes and that they are solid state, highly tailorable, and insensitive to electromagnetic noise. We show how the resource states can be prepared directly in the acoustic modes using optical controls. This is still probabilistic and heralded, as in the all-optical approach, but the acoustic modes act as a quantum memory which is integrated into the production of the states. The quantum states may be deterministically transferred from acoustic modes to optical modes, on demand, with another optical drive.

### FreqKV: Frequency Domain Key-Value Compression for Efficient Context   Window Extension
**Authors**: Jushi Kai, Boyi Zeng, Yixuan Wang, Haoli Bai, Bo Jiang, Zhouhan Lin

**Updated**: 2025-05-01T14:53:12Z

**Summary**: Extending the context window in large language models (LLMs) is essential for applications involving long-form content generation. However, the linear increase in key-value (KV) cache memory requirements and the quadratic complexity of self-attention with respect to sequence length present significant challenges during fine-tuning and inference. Existing methods suffer from performance degradation when extending to longer contexts. In this work, we introduce a novel context extension method that optimizes both fine-tuning and inference efficiency. Our method exploits a key observation: in the frequency domain, the energy distribution of the KV cache is primarily concentrated in low-frequency components. By filtering out the high-frequency components, the KV cache can be effectively compressed with minimal information loss. Building on this insight, we propose an efficient compression technique, FreqKV, that iteratively compresses the increasing KV cache to a fixed size in the frequency domain, applicable to both fine-tuning and inference. FreqKV introduces no additional parameters or architectural modifications. With minimal fine-tuning, LLMs can learn to leverage the limited cache that is compressed in the frequency domain and extend the context window efficiently. Experiments on various long context language modeling and understanding tasks demonstrate the efficiency and efficacy of the proposed method.

### Mixture of Sparse Attention: Content-Based Learnable Sparse Attention   via Expert-Choice Routing
**Authors**: Piotr Piękos, Róbert Csordás, Jürgen Schmidhuber

**Updated**: 2025-05-01T05:22:11Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in large language models highlighted the excessive quadratic cost of self-attention. Despite the significant research efforts, subquadratic attention methods still suffer from inferior performance in practice. We hypothesize that dynamic, learned content-based sparsity can lead to more efficient attention mechanisms. We present Mixture of Sparse Attention (MoSA), a novel approach inspired by Mixture of Experts (MoE) with expert choice routing. MoSA dynamically selects tokens for each attention head, allowing arbitrary sparse attention patterns. By selecting $k$ tokens from a sequence of length $T$, MoSA reduces the computational complexity of each attention head from $O(T^2)$ to $O(k^2 + T)$. This enables using more heads within the same computational budget, allowing higher specialization. We show that among the tested sparse attention variants, MoSA is the only one that can outperform the dense baseline, sometimes with up to 27% better perplexity for an identical compute budget. MoSA can also reduce the resource usage compared to dense self-attention. Despite using torch implementation without an optimized kernel, perplexity-matched MoSA models are simultaneously faster in wall-clock time, require less memory for training, and drastically reduce the size of the KV-cache compared to the dense transformer baselines.

### QServe: W4A8KV4 Quantization and System Co-design for Efficient LLM   Serving
**Authors**: Yujun Lin, Haotian Tang, Shang Yang, Zhekai Zhang, Guangxuan Xiao, Chuang Gan, Song Han

**Updated**: 2025-05-01T02:14:05Z

**Summary**: Quantization can accelerate large language model (LLM) inference. Going beyond INT8 quantization, the research community is actively exploring even lower precision, such as INT4. Nonetheless, state-of-the-art INT4 quantization techniques only accelerate low-batch, edge LLM inference, failing to deliver performance gains in large-batch, cloud-based LLM serving. We uncover a critical issue: existing INT4 quantization methods suffer from significant runtime overhead (20-90%) when dequantizing either weights or partial sums on GPUs. To address this challenge, we introduce QoQ, a W4A8KV4 quantization algorithm with 4-bit weight, 8-bit activation, and 4-bit KV cache. QoQ stands for quattuor-octo-quattuor, which represents 4-8-4 in Latin. QoQ is implemented by the QServe inference library that achieves measured speedup. The key insight driving QServe is that the efficiency of LLM serving on GPUs is critically influenced by operations on low-throughput CUDA cores. Building upon this insight, in QoQ algorithm, we introduce progressive quantization that can allow low dequantization overhead in W4A8 GEMM. Additionally, we develop SmoothAttention to effectively mitigate the accuracy degradation incurred by 4-bit KV quantization. In the QServe system, we perform compute-aware weight reordering and take advantage of register-level parallelism to reduce dequantization latency. We also make fused attention memory-bound, harnessing the performance gain brought by KV4 quantization. As a result, QServe improves the maximum achievable serving throughput of Llama-3-8B by 1.2x on A100, 1.4x on L40S; and Qwen1.5-72B by 2.4x on A100, 3.5x on L40S, compared to TensorRT-LLM. Remarkably, QServe on L40S GPU can achieve even higher throughput than TensorRT-LLM on A100. Thus, QServe effectively reduces the dollar cost of LLM serving by 3x.

### Soft-Label Caching and Sharpening for Communication-Efficient Federated   Distillation
**Authors**: Kitsuya Azuma, Takayuki Nishio, Yuichi Kitagawa, Wakako Nakano, Takahito Tanimura

**Updated**: 2025-05-01T00:13:06Z

**Summary**: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across decentralized clients, enhancing privacy by keeping data local. Yet conventional FL, relying on frequent parameter-sharing, suffers from high communication overhead and limited model heterogeneity. Distillation-based FL approaches address these issues by sharing predictions (soft-labels) instead, but they often involve redundant transmissions across communication rounds, reducing efficiency. We propose SCARLET, a novel framework integrating synchronized soft-label caching and an enhanced Entropy Reduction Aggregation (Enhanced ERA) mechanism. SCARLET minimizes redundant communication by reusing cached soft-labels, achieving up to 50% reduction in communication costs compared to existing methods while maintaining accuracy. Enhanced ERA can be tuned to adapt to non-IID data variations, ensuring robust aggregation and performance in diverse client scenarios. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that SCARLET consistently outperforms state-of-the-art distillation-based FL methods in terms of accuracy and communication efficiency. The implementation of SCARLET is publicly available at https://github.com/kitsuyaazuma/SCARLET.

### Accelerating Diffusion Transformer via Error-Optimized Cache
**Authors**: Junxiang Qiu, Shuo Wang, Jinda Lu, Lin Liu, Houcheng Jiang, Xingyu Zhu, Yanbin Hao

**Updated**: 2025-04-30T19:48:41Z

**Summary**: Diffusion Transformer (DiT) is a crucial method for content generation. However, it needs a lot of time to sample. Many studies have attempted to use caching to reduce the time consumption of sampling. Existing caching methods accelerate generation by reusing DiT features from the previous time step and skipping calculations in the next, but they tend to locate and cache low-error modules without focusing on reducing caching-induced errors, resulting in a sharp decline in generated content quality when increasing caching intensity. To solve this problem, we propose the Error-Optimized Cache (EOC). This method introduces three key improvements: (1) Prior knowledge extraction: Extract and process the caching differences; (2) A judgment method for cache optimization: Determine whether certain caching steps need to be optimized; (3) Cache optimization: reduce caching errors. Experiments show that this algorithm significantly reduces the error accumulation caused by caching, especially excessive caching. On the ImageNet dataset, without substantially increasing the computational load, this method improves the FID of the generated images when the rule-based model FORA has a caching level of 75%, 50%, and 25%, and the training-based model Learning-to-cache has a caching level of 22%. Specifically, the FID values change from 30.454 to 21.690 (28.8%), from 6.857 to 5.821 (15.1%), from 3.870 to 3.692 (4.6%), and from 3.539 to 3.451 (2.5%) respectively.

### SDW driven "magnetic breakdown" in a d-wave altermagnet KV$_2$Se$_2$O
**Authors**: Xu Yan, Ziyin Song, Juntao Song, Zhong Fang, Hongming Weng, Quansheng Wu

**Updated**: 2025-04-30T18:00:02Z

**Summary**: Altermagnets, combining zero net magnetization with intrinsic spin splitting, demonstrate unique quantum phenomena crucial for spintronic applications. KV$_2$Se$_2$O is proven to be a d-wave altermagnet with phase transition from a checkerboard-type (C-type) antiferromagnetic (AFM) state to a spin density wave (SDW) state as the temperature decreases. After phase transition, the apparent paradox emerges where angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) reveals negligible Fermi surface modifications, while physical property measurement system (PPMS) measurements uncover substantial changes in transport properties. Our study explores the microscopic mechanisms governing phase-dependent transport properties of KV$_2$Se$_2$O base on first-principles calculations. The spin canting driven by periodic spin modulation in the SDW phase reduces the magnetic symmetry of KV$_2$Se$_2$O. The resultant band degeneracy lifting and Fermi surface reconstruction induce the ``magnetic breakdown" phenomenon, which alters carrier trajectories, modifies carrier concentration, strengthens electron-hole compensation, and ultimately accounts for the contrasting magnetic-field-dependent Hall resistivity relative to the C-type AFM state. Our work proposes an innovative method for identifying the electronic structure evolution across phase transitions from transport signatures, providing a novel paradigm for altermagnets research.

### Switching Transients in Constrained Transformer-Line/Cable   Configurations
**Authors**: Y. Xiang, L. Wu, K. Velitsikakis, A. L. J. Janssen

**Updated**: 2025-04-30T12:51:59Z

**Summary**: This paper investigates the transient phenomena that occur in two special cases in the Netherlands: (A) during the energization of a power transformer via a cable feeder and (B) the energization of a power transformer together with an overhead line (OHL). In Case A a 7 km long 150 kV cable and a 150/50 kV transformer are connected and energized at the same time. In Case B a 150/50 kV transformer and a short 50 kV OHL are connected and energized simultaneously. The reason behind this kind of situations is related to space restrictions and cost efficiency.

### Responsive DNN Adaptation for Video Analytics against Environment Shift   via Hierarchical Mobile-Cloud Collaborations
**Authors**: Maozhe Zhao, Shengzhong Liu, Fan Wu, Guihai Chen

**Updated**: 2025-04-30T08:08:15Z

**Summary**: Mobile video analysis systems often encounter various deploying environments, where environment shifts present greater demands for responsiveness in adaptations of deployed "expert DNN models". Existing model adaptation frameworks primarily operate in a cloud-centric way, exhibiting degraded performance during adaptation and delayed reactions to environment shifts. Instead, this paper proposes MOCHA, a novel framework optimizing the responsiveness of continuous model adaptation through hierarchical collaborations between mobile and cloud resources. Specifically, MOCHA (1) reduces adaptation response delays by performing on-device model reuse and fast fine-tuning before requesting cloud model retrieval and end-to-end retraining; (2) accelerates history expert model retrieval by organizing them into a structured taxonomy utilizing domain semantics analyzed by a cloud foundation model as indices; (3) enables efficient local model reuse by maintaining onboard expert model caches for frequent scenes, which proactively prefetch model weights from the cloud model database. Extensive evaluations with real-world videos on three DNN tasks show MOCHA improves the model accuracy during adaptation by up to 6.8% while saving the response delay and retraining time by up to 35.5x and 3.0x respectively.

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T23:43:59Z

**Summary**: We introduce the Kimina Lean Server, an open-source project that enables fast and scalable interaction with Lean 4 via a unified REST API, designed as a simple verifier for reinforcement learning pipelines. Built on top of the Lean FRO's LeanREPL, it combines server-side parallelization by managing multiple Lean REPL processes in parallel, with an LRU caching strategy that reuses Lean imports across multiple requests. These features help reduce initialization overhead and allow large-scale batch processing of Lean code. The client-side interface allows users to submit batches of proofs and receive Lean feedback, including extracted tactics and tactic states via infotree processing. These features enable a high-performance, scalable workflow for both interaction and extraction of proofs, tactics, and tactic states. We open source our implementation on GitHub.

### CachePrune: Neural-Based Attribution Defense Against Indirect Prompt   Injection Attacks
**Authors**: Rui Wang, Junda Wu, Yu Xia, Tong Yu, Ruiyi Zhang, Ryan Rossi, Lina Yao, Julian McAuley

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T23:42:21Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are identified as being susceptible to indirect prompt injection attack, where the model undesirably deviates from user-provided instructions by executing tasks injected in the prompt context. This vulnerability stems from LLMs' inability to distinguish between data and instructions within a prompt. In this paper, we propose CachePrune that defends against this attack by identifying and pruning task-triggering neurons from the KV cache of the input prompt context. By pruning such neurons, we encourage the LLM to treat the text spans of input prompt context as only pure data, instead of any indicator of instruction following. These neurons are identified via feature attribution with a loss function induced from an upperbound of the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) objective. We show that such a loss function enables effective feature attribution with only a few samples. We further improve on the quality of feature attribution, by exploiting an observed triggering effect in instruction following. Our approach does not impose any formatting on the original prompt or introduce extra test-time LLM calls. Experiments show that CachePrune significantly reduces attack success rates without compromising the response quality. Note: This paper aims to defend against indirect prompt injection attacks, with the goal of developing more secure and robust AI systems.

### An Achievable Scheme for the K-user Linear Computation Broadcast Channel
**Authors**: Yinbin Ma, Daniela Tuninetti

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T17:54:42Z

**Summary**: This paper presents a new achievable scheme for the K-user Linear Computation Broadcast Channel (K-LCBC). A K-LCBC comprises data stored on a server and K users, each aiming to retrieve a desired linear function of the data by leveraging their prior locally available side information in the form of another linear function of the data. The proposed scheme is based on a subspace decomposition derived from representable polymatroid spaces. This decomposition enables the server to effectively design multicast messages that simultaneously benefit multiple users and allow users to eliminate interference using their available side information. This work extends existing results for the 3-LCBC by introducing a linear programming framework to optimize multicast opportunities across an arbitrary number of users. The proposed approach can be used to derive achievable scheme for the K-user coded caching problem with linear coded placement and scalar linear function retrieval, which was our original motivation to investigate the K-LCBC.

### Activated LoRA: Fine-tuned LLMs for Intrinsics
**Authors**: Kristjan Greenewald, Luis Lastras, Thomas Parnell, Vraj Shah, Lucian Popa, Giulio Zizzo, Chulaka Gunasekara, Ambrish Rawat, David Cox

**Updated**: 2025-04-29T14:25:08Z

**Summary**: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a highly efficient framework for finetuning the weights of large foundation models, and has become the go-to method for data-driven customization of LLMs. Despite the promise of highly customized behaviors and capabilities, switching between relevant LoRAs in a multiturn setting is highly inefficient, as the key-value (KV) cache of the entire turn history must be recomputed with the LoRA weights before generation can begin. To address this problem, we propose Activated LoRA (aLoRA), which modifies the LoRA framework to only adapt weights for the tokens in the sequence \emph{after} the aLoRA is invoked. This change crucially allows aLoRA to accept the base model's KV cache of the input string, meaning that aLoRA can be instantly activated whenever needed in a chain without recomputing the cache. This enables building what we call \emph{intrinsics}, i.e. highly specialized models invoked to perform well-defined operations on portions of an input chain or conversation that otherwise uses the base model by default. We use aLoRA to train a set of intrinsics models, demonstrating competitive accuracy with standard LoRA while achieving significant inference benefits.

### VA-CDH: A Variance-Aware Method to Optimize Latency for Caching with   Delayed Hits
**Authors**: Bowen Jiang, Chaofan Ma, Duo Wang

**Updated**: 2025-05-03T01:10:30Z

**Summary**: Caches are fundamental to latency-sensitive systems like Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) and Mobile Edge Computing (MEC). However, the delayed hit phenomenon where multiple requests for an object occur during its fetch from the remote server after a miss significantly inflates user-perceived latency. While recent algorithms acknowledge delayed hits by estimating the resulting aggregate delay, they predominantly focus on its mean value. We identify and demonstrate that such approaches are insufficient, as the real aggregate delay frequently exhibits substantial variance in the true production system, leading to suboptimal latency performance when ignored. Thus, we propose VA-CDH, a variance-aware method to optimize latency for caching with delayed hits. It employs a novel ranking function that explicitly incorporates both the empirically estimated mean and standard deviation of aggregate delay, allowing caching decisions to account for its variation. We derive the analytical distribution of aggregate delay under Poisson arrivals as a theoretical contribution, offering more statistical insight beyond the mean value. Through the simulations conducted on synthetic and real-world datasets, we show that VA-CDH reduces the total latency by 1%-6% approximately compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.

### Tree embedding based mapping system for low-latency mobile applications   in multi-access networks
**Authors**: Yu Mi, Randeep Bhatia, Fang Hao, An Wang, Steve Benno, Tv Lakshman

**Updated**: 2025-04-28T20:30:59Z

**Summary**: Low-latency applications like AR/VR and online gaming need fast, stable connections. New technologies such as V2X, LEO satellites, and 6G bring unique challenges in mobility management. Traditional solutions based on centralized or distributed anchors often fall short in supporting rapid mobility due to inefficient routing, low versatility, and insufficient multi-access support. In this paper, we design a new end-to-end system for tracking multi-connected mobile devices at scale and optimizing performance for latency-sensitive, highly dynamic applications. Our system, based on the locator/ID separation principle, extends to multi-access networks without requiring specialized routers or caching. Using a novel tree embedding-based overlay, we enable fast session setup while allowing endpoints to directly handle mobility between them. Evaluation with real network data shows our solution cuts connection latency to 7.42% inflation over the shortest path, compared to LISP's 359\% due to cache misses. It also significantly reduces location update overhead and disruption time during mobility.

### Hierarchical Coded Caching with Low Subpacketization and Coding Delay   using Combinatorial t-Designs
**Authors**: Rashid Ummer N. T., B. Sundar Rajan

**Updated**: 2025-04-28T17:17:53Z

**Summary**: Coded caching scheme originally proposed by Maddah-Ali and Niesen (MN) considered a broadcast network consisting of a single server connected to a set of users each having a cache memory. Motivated by practical scenarios, Karamchandani \textit{et al.} in [16] proposed a coded caching scheme for a two-layer hierarchical network consisting of a single server connected to multiple mirror sites and each mirror site connected to a distinct set of users, in which both mirror sites and users having cache memories. Low subpacketization level coded caching schemes are desirable for practical implementations. Placement delivery array (PDA) was proposed as a tool to design coded caching schemes with reduced subpacketization level by Yan \textit{et al.} in [4]. Schemes with reduced subpacketization levels are studied extensively in the literature for single-layer networks. Kong \textit{et al.} in [17] proposed a structure called hierarchical placement delivery arrays (HPDA), which characterizes a hierarchical coded caching system and also proposed a class of HPDAs that gives low subpacketization level schemes by using two PDAs. Low subpacketization level hierarchical schemes using combinatorial $t$-designs is proposed in [20]. Apart from that there is no other existing work that discusses the subpacketization problem in a hierarchical network. This paper proposes a class of HPDA construction that gives low subpacketization level hierarchical coded caching schemes, by first constructing a new class of PDAs. Compared with the existing schemes, in cases where the system parameters and subpacketization level are the same, the proposed hierarchical scheme has a better coding delay. Further, the new class of PDAs constructed either subsumes several known PDA constructions or achieves better transmission load for the same system parameters.

### 3D MPSoC with On-Chip Cache Support -- Design and Exploitation
**Authors**: Rodrigo Cataldo, Cesar Marcon, Debora Matos

**Updated**: 2025-04-28T16:59:13Z

**Summary**: The increasing density of transistors in Integrated Circuits (ICs) has enabled the development of highly integrated Systems-on-Chip (SoCs) and, more recently, Multiprocessor Systems-on-Chip (MPSoCs). To address scalability challenges in communication and memory performance, three-dimensional (3D) Network-on-Chip (NoC) architectures have emerged, offering improvements in communication latency and throughput. However, memory system efficiency remains a critical bottleneck in NoC-based designs. This work proposes the design and experimental exploration of 3D MPSoCs with on-chip cache support by employing distinct communication infrastructures for inter-processor and memory interactions. Specifically, packet-based NoCs are adopted for inter-processor communication, while a crossbar-based infrastructure supports a cache coherence hierarchy for memory access. A two-layer system architecture is introduced, combining a Uniform Memory Access (UMA) model within clusters and a No Remote Memory Access (NORMA) model between clusters, aiming to balance scalability and coherence requirements. Emerging memory technologies such as PCRAM and MRAM are explored to optimize performance, energy consumption, and area usage. Experimental evaluations are conducted using the Gem5 simulator, targeting a model based on the ARM Versatile Express platform. The outcomes of this study aim to enhance MPSoC scalability while meeting the stringent demands of memory-centric applications.

### TurboQuant: Online Vector Quantization with Near-optimal Distortion Rate
**Authors**: Amir Zandieh, Majid Daliri, Majid Hadian, Vahab Mirrokni

**Updated**: 2025-04-28T15:05:35Z

**Summary**: Vector quantization, a problem rooted in Shannon's source coding theory, aims to quantize high-dimensional Euclidean vectors while minimizing distortion in their geometric structure. We propose TurboQuant to address both mean-squared error (MSE) and inner product distortion, overcoming limitations of existing methods that fail to achieve optimal distortion rates. Our data-oblivious algorithms, suitable for online applications, achieve near-optimal distortion rates (within a small constant factor) across all bit-widths and dimensions. TurboQuant achieves this by randomly rotating input vectors, inducing a concentrated Beta distribution on coordinates, and leveraging the near-independence property of distinct coordinates in high dimensions to simply apply optimal scalar quantizers per each coordinate. Recognizing that MSE-optimal quantizers introduce bias in inner product estimation, we propose a two-stage approach: applying an MSE quantizer followed by a 1-bit Quantized JL (QJL) transform on the residual, resulting in an unbiased inner product quantizer. We also provide a formal proof of the information-theoretic lower bounds on best achievable distortion rate by any vector quantizer, demonstrating that TurboQuant closely matches these bounds, differing only by a small constant ($\approx 2.7$) factor. Experimental results validate our theoretical findings, showing that for KV cache quantization, we achieve absolute quality neutrality with 3.5 bits per channel and marginal quality degradation with 2.5 bits per channel. Furthermore, in nearest neighbor search tasks, our method outperforms existing product quantization techniques in recall while reducing indexing time to virtually zero.

### semi-PD: Towards Efficient LLM Serving via Phase-Wise Disaggregated   Computation and Unified Storage
**Authors**: Ke Hong, Lufang Chen, Zhong Wang, Xiuhong Li, Qiuli Mao, Jianping Ma, Chao Xiong, Guanyu Wu, Buhe Han, Guohao Dai, Yun Liang, Yu Wang

**Updated**: 2025-04-28T15:00:03Z

**Summary**: Existing large language model (LLM) serving systems fall into two categories: 1) a unified system where prefill phase and decode phase are co-located on the same GPU, sharing the unified computational resource and storage, and 2) a disaggregated system where the two phases are disaggregated to different GPUs. The design of the disaggregated system addresses the latency interference and sophisticated scheduling issues in the unified system but leads to storage challenges including 1) replicated weights for both phases that prevent flexible deployment, 2) KV cache transfer overhead between the two phases, 3) storage imbalance that causes substantial wasted space of the GPU capacity, and 4) suboptimal resource adjustment arising from the difficulties in migrating KV cache. Such storage inefficiency delivers poor serving performance under high request rates.   In this paper, we identify that the advantage of the disaggregated system lies in the disaggregated computation, i.e., partitioning the computational resource to enable the asynchronous computation of two phases. Thus, we propose a novel LLM serving system, semi-PD, characterized by disaggregated computation and unified storage. In semi-PD, we introduce a computation resource controller to achieve disaggregated computation at the streaming multi-processor (SM) level, and a unified memory manager to manage the asynchronous memory access from both phases. semi-PD has a low-overhead resource adjustment mechanism between the two phases, and a service-level objective (SLO) aware dynamic partitioning algorithm to optimize the SLO attainment. Compared to state-of-the-art systems, semi-PD maintains lower latency at higher request rates, reducing the average end-to-end latency per request by 1.27-2.58x on DeepSeek series models, and serves 1.55-1.72x more requests adhering to latency constraints on Llama series models.

### Characterizing the Optimal Memory-Rate Tradeoff in Secure Coded Caching   for Small Buffer or Small Rate
**Authors**: Han Fang, Nan Liu, Wei Kang

**Updated**: 2025-04-28T09:03:45Z

**Summary**: We consider the secure coded caching problem proposed by Ravindrakumar et. al where no user can obtain information about files other than the one requested. We first propose three new schemes for the three cases of cache size $M=1$, $N=2$ files and arbitrary $K$ users, delivery rate $ R=1$, arbitrary $N$ files and $K$ users, and the general case for arbitrary $N$ files and $K$ users, respectively. Then we derive converse results by characterizing new properties of secure coded caching schemes. As a result, we characterize the two end-points of the optimal memory-rate tradeoff curve for arbitrary number of users and files. Furthermore, for the case of $N=2$ files and arbitrary number of users, we also characterize a segment of the optimal memory-rate tradeoff curve, where the cache size is relatively small.

### Quantifying Memory Utilization with Effective State-Size
**Authors**: Rom N. Parnichkun, Neehal Tumma, Armin W. Thomas, Alessandro Moro, Qi An, Taiji Suzuki, Atsushi Yamashita, Michael Poli, Stefano Massaroli

**Updated**: 2025-04-28T08:12:30Z

**Summary**: The need to develop a general framework for architecture analysis is becoming increasingly important, given the expanding design space of sequence models. To this end, we draw insights from classical signal processing and control theory, to develop a quantitative measure of \textit{memory utilization}: the internal mechanisms through which a model stores past information to produce future outputs. This metric, which we call \textbf{\textit{effective state-size}} (ESS), is tailored to the fundamental class of systems with \textit{input-invariant} and \textit{input-varying linear operators}, encompassing a variety of computational units such as variants of attention, convolutions, and recurrences. Unlike prior work on memory utilization, which either relies on raw operator visualizations (e.g. attention maps), or simply the total \textit{memory capacity} (i.e. cache size) of a model, our metrics provide highly interpretable and actionable measurements. In particular, we show how ESS can be leveraged to improve initialization strategies, inform novel regularizers and advance the performance-efficiency frontier through model distillation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the effect of context delimiters (such as end-of-speech tokens) on ESS highlights cross-architectural differences in how large language models utilize their available memory to recall information. Overall, we find that ESS provides valuable insights into the dynamics that dictate memory utilization, enabling the design of more efficient and effective sequence models.

**Authors**: Sonia Joseph, Praneet Suresh, Lorenz Hufe, Edward Stevinson, Robert Graham, Yash Vadi, Danilo Bzdok, Sebastian Lapuschkin, Lee Sharkey, Blake Aaron Richards

**Updated**: 2025-04-28T04:31:24Z

**Summary**: Robust tooling and publicly available pre-trained models have helped drive recent advances in mechanistic interpretability for language models. However, similar progress in vision mechanistic interpretability has been hindered by the lack of accessible frameworks and pre-trained weights. We present Prisma (Access the codebase here: https://github.com/Prisma-Multimodal/ViT-Prisma), an open-source framework designed to accelerate vision mechanistic interpretability research, providing a unified toolkit for accessing 75+ vision and video transformers; support for sparse autoencoder (SAE), transcoder, and crosscoder training; a suite of 80+ pre-trained SAE weights; activation caching, circuit analysis tools, and visualization tools; and educational resources. Our analysis reveals surprising findings, including that effective vision SAEs can exhibit substantially lower sparsity patterns than language SAEs, and that in some instances, SAE reconstructions can decrease model loss. Prisma enables new research directions for understanding vision model internals while lowering barriers to entry in this emerging field.

### From Cluster to Desktop: A Cache-Accelerated INR framework for   Interactive Visualization of Tera-Scale Data
**Authors**: Daniel Zavorotny, Qi Wu, David Bauer, Kwan-Liu Ma

**Updated**: 2025-04-28T04:02:30Z

**Summary**: Machine learning has enabled the use of implicit neural representations (INRs) to efficiently compress and reconstruct massive scientific datasets. However, despite advances in fast INR rendering algorithms, INR-based rendering remains computationally expensive, as computing data values from an INR is significantly slower than reading them from GPU memory. This bottleneck currently restricts interactive INR visualization to professional workstations. To address this challenge, we introduce an INR rendering framework accelerated by a scalable, multi-resolution GPU cache capable of efficiently representing tera-scale datasets. By minimizing redundant data queries and prioritizing novel volume regions, our method reduces the number of INR computations per frame, achieving an average 5x speedup over the state-of-the-art INR rendering method while still maintaining high visualization quality. Coupled with existing hardware-accelerated INR compressors, our framework enables scientists to generate and compress massive datasets in situ on high-performance computing platforms and then interactively explore them on consumer-grade hardware post hoc.

### Point-Cache: Test-time Dynamic and Hierarchical Cache for Robust and   Generalizable Point Cloud Analysis
**Authors**: Hongyu Sun, Qiuhong Ke, Ming Cheng, Yongcai Wang, Deying Li, Chenhui Gou, Jianfei Cai

**Updated**: 2025-04-28T02:58:27Z

**Summary**: This paper proposes a general solution to enable point cloud recognition models to handle distribution shifts at test time. Unlike prior methods, which rely heavily on training data (often inaccessible during online inference) and are limited to recognizing a fixed set of point cloud classes predefined during training, we explore a more practical and challenging scenario: adapting the model solely based on online test data to recognize both previously seen classes and novel, unseen classes at test time. To this end, we develop \textbf{Point-Cache}, a hierarchical cache model that captures essential clues of online test samples, particularly focusing on the global structure of point clouds and their local-part details. Point-Cache, which serves as a rich 3D knowledge base, is dynamically managed to prioritize the inclusion of high-quality samples. Designed as a plug-and-play module, our method can be flexibly integrated into large multimodal 3D models to support open-vocabulary point cloud recognition. Notably, our solution operates with efficiency comparable to zero-shot inference, as it is entirely training-free. Point-Cache demonstrates substantial gains across 8 challenging benchmarks and 4 representative large 3D models, highlighting its effectiveness. Code is available at https://github.com/auniquesun/Point-Cache.

### AGILE: Lightweight and Efficient Asynchronous GPU-SSD Integration
**Authors**: Zhuoping Yang, Jinming Zhuang, Xingzhen Chen, Alex K. Jones, Peipei Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-04-27T22:05:14Z

**Summary**: Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) have become essential for computationally intensive applications. However, emerging workloads such as recommender systems, graph analytics, and data analytics often involve processing data exceeding GPU on-chip memory capacity. To mitigate this issue, existing solutions enable GPUs to use CPU DRAM or SSDs as external memory. Among them, the GPU-centric approach lets GPU threads directly initiate NVMe requests, eliminating CPU intervention overhead over traditional methods. However, the SOTA GPU-centric approach adopts a synchronous IO model, and threads must tolerate the long latency in communication before starting any tasks.   In this work, we propose AGILE, a lightweight and efficient asynchronous library allowing GPU threads to access SSDs asynchronously while eliminating deadlock risks. AGILE also integrates a flexible software cache using GPU High-Bandwidth Mamory (HBM). We demonstrate that the asynchronous GPU-centric IO achieves up to 1.88$\times$ improvement in workloads with different computation-to-communication (CTC) ratios. We also compare AGILE with the SOTA work BaM on Deep Learning Recommendation Models (DLRM) with various settings, and the results show that AGILE achieves 1.75$\times$ performance improvement due to its efficient design and the overlapping strategy enabled by an asynchronous IO model. We further evaluate AGILE's API overhead on graph applications, and the results demonstrate AGILE reduces software cache overhead by up to 3.12$\times$ and overhead in NVMe IO requests by up to 2.85$\times$. Compared with BaM, AGILE consumes fewer registers and exhibits up to 1.32$\times$ reduction in the usage of registers.

### OpenFusion++: An Open-vocabulary Real-time Scene Understanding System
**Authors**: Xiaofeng Jin, Matteo Frosi, Matteo Matteucci

**Updated**: 2025-04-27T14:46:43Z

**Summary**: Real-time open-vocabulary scene understanding is essential for efficient 3D perception in applications such as vision-language navigation, embodied intelligence, and augmented reality. However, existing methods suffer from imprecise instance segmentation, static semantic updates, and limited handling of complex queries. To address these issues, we present OpenFusion++, a TSDF-based real-time 3D semantic-geometric reconstruction system. Our approach refines 3D point clouds by fusing confidence maps from foundational models, dynamically updates global semantic labels via an adaptive cache based on instance area, and employs a dual-path encoding framework that integrates object attributes with environmental context for precise query responses. Experiments on the ICL, Replica, ScanNet, and ScanNet++ datasets demonstrate that OpenFusion++ significantly outperforms the baseline in both semantic accuracy and query responsiveness.

### WuNeng: Hybrid State with Attention
**Authors**: Liu Xiao, Li Zhiyuan, Lin Yueyu

**Updated**: 2025-04-27T10:48:56Z

**Summary**: The WuNeng architecture introduces a novel approach to enhancing the expressivity and power of large language models by integrating recurrent neural network (RNN)-based RWKV-7 with advanced attention mechanisms, prioritizing heightened contextual coherence over reducing KV cache size. Building upon the hybrid-head concept from Hymba, WuNeng augments standard multi-head attention with additional RWKV-7 state-driven heads, rather than replacing existing heads, to enrich the model's representational capacity. A cross-head interaction technique fosters dynamic synergy among standard, state-driven, and newly introduced middle heads, leveraging concatenation, additive modulation, and gated fusion for robust information integration. Furthermore, a multi-token state processing mechanism harnesses the continuous RWKV-7 state to capture intricate, sequence-wide dependencies, significantly boosting expressivity. Remarkably, these enhancements are achieved with minimal additional parameters, ensuring efficiency while empowering the model to excel in complex reasoning and sequence generation tasks. WuNeng sets a new standard for balancing expressivity and computational efficiency in modern neural architectures.

### I Know What You Sync: Covert and Side Channel Attacks on File Systems   via syncfs
**Authors**: Cheng Gu, Yicheng Zhang, Nael Abu-Ghazaleh

**Updated**: 2025-04-26T12:07:35Z

**Summary**: Operating Systems enforce logical isolation using abstractions such as processes, containers, and isolation technologies to protect a system from malicious or buggy code. In this paper, we show new types of side channels through the file system that break this logical isolation. The file system plays a critical role in the operating system, managing all I/O activities between the application layer and the physical storage device. We observe that the file system implementation is shared, leading to timing leakage when using common I/O system calls. Specifically, we found that modern operating systems take advantage of any flush operation (which saves cached blocks in memory to the SSD or disk) to flush all of the I/O buffers, even those used by other isolation domains. Thus, by measuring the delay of syncfs, the attacker can infer the I/O behavior of victim programs. We then demonstrate a syncfs covert channel attack on multiple file systems, including both Linux native file systems and the Windows file system, achieving a maximum bandwidth of 5 Kbps with an error rate of 0.15% on Linux and 7.6 Kbps with an error rate of 1.9% on Windows. In addition, we construct three side-channel attacks targeting both Linux and Android devices. On Linux devices, we implement a website fingerprinting attack and a video fingerprinting attack by tracking the write patterns of temporary buffering files. On Android devices, we design an application fingerprinting attack that leaks application write patterns during boot-up. The attacks achieve over 90% F1 score, precision, and recall. Finally, we demonstrate that these attacks can be exploited across containers implementing a container detection technique and a cross-container covert channel attack.

### ShadowKV: KV Cache in Shadows for High-Throughput Long-Context LLM   Inference
**Authors**: Hanshi Sun, Li-Wen Chang, Wenlei Bao, Size Zheng, Ningxin Zheng, Xin Liu, Harry Dong, Yuejie Chi, Beidi Chen

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T19:40:54Z

**Summary**: With the widespread deployment of long-context large language models (LLMs), there has been a growing demand for efficient support of high-throughput inference. However, as the key-value (KV) cache expands with the sequence length, the increasing memory footprint and the need to access it for each token generation both result in low throughput when serving long-context LLMs. While various dynamic sparse attention methods have been proposed to speed up inference while maintaining generation quality, they either fail to sufficiently reduce GPU memory consumption or introduce significant decoding latency by offloading the KV cache to the CPU. We present ShadowKV, a high-throughput long-context LLM inference system that stores the low-rank key cache and offloads the value cache to reduce the memory footprint for larger batch sizes and longer sequences. To minimize decoding latency, ShadowKV employs an accurate KV selection strategy that reconstructs minimal sparse KV pairs on-the-fly. By evaluating ShadowKV on a broad range of benchmarks, including RULER, LongBench, and Needle In A Haystack, and models like Llama-3.1-8B, Llama-3-8B-1M, GLM-4-9B-1M, Yi-9B-200K, Phi-3-Mini-128K, and Qwen2-7B-128K, we demonstrate that it can support up to 6$\times$ larger batch sizes and boost throughput by up to 3.04$\times$ on an A100 GPU without sacrificing accuracy, even surpassing the performance achievable with infinite batch size under the assumption of infinite GPU memory. The code is available at https://github.com/bytedance/ShadowKV.

### Constructing Hamiltonian Decompositions of Complete $k$-Uniform   Hypergraphs
**Authors**: Javad Maheri, Petros Elia

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T15:45:36Z

**Summary**: Motivated by the wide-ranging applications of Hamiltonian decompositions in distributed computing, coded caching, routing, resource allocation, load balancing, and fault tolerance, our work presents a comprehensive design for Hamiltonian decompositions of complete $k$-uniform hypergraphs $K_n^k$. Building upon the resolution of the long-standing conjecture of the existence of Hamiltonian decompositions of complete hypergraphs, a problem that was resolved using existence-based methods, our contribution goes beyond the previous explicit designs, which were confined to the specific cases of $k=2$ and $k=3$, by providing explicit designs for all $k$ and $n$ prime, allowing for a broad applicability of Hamiltonian decompositions in various settings.

### FlexiNS: A SmartNIC-Centric, Line-Rate and Flexible Network Stack
**Authors**: Xuzheng Chen, Jie Zhang, Baolin Zhu, Xueying Zhu, Zhongqing Chen, Shu Ma, Lingjun Zhu, Chao Shi, Yin Zhang, Zeke Wang

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T15:44:38Z

**Summary**: As the gap between network and CPU speeds rapidly increases, the CPU-centric network stack proves inadequate due to excessive CPU and memory overhead. While hardware-offloaded network stacks alleviate these issues, they suffer from limited flexibility in both control and data planes. Offloading network stack to off-path SmartNIC seems promising to provide high flexibility; however, throughput remains constrained by inherent SmartNIC architectural limitations.   To this end, we design FlexiNS, a SmartNIC-centric network stack with software transport programmability and line-rate packet processing capabilities. To grapple with the limitation of SmartNIC-induced challenges, FlexiNS introduces: (a) a header-only offloading TX path; (b) an unlimited-working-set in-cache processing RX path; (c) a high-performance DMA-only notification pipe; and (d) a programmable offloading engine. We prototype FlexiNS using Nvidia BlueField-3 SmartNIC and provide out-of-the-box RDMA IBV verbs compatibility to users. FlexiNS achieves 2.2$\times$ higher throughput than the microkernel-based baseline in block storage disaggregation and 1.3$\times$ higher throughput than the hardware-offloaded baseline in KVCache transfer.

**Summary**: We investigate the demand private coded caching problem, which is an $(N,K)$ coded caching problem with $N$ files, $K$ users, each equipped with a cache of size $M$, and an additional privacy constraint on user demands, i.e., each user can not gain any information about the demands of other users. We focus on scenarios where the size of users' caches is small, aiming to further characterize the fundamental limits of this problem. We first present a new virtual-user-based achievable scheme for arbitrary number of users and files, and two MDS-code-based achievable schemes for the case $N \le K$. With a newly derived converse bound for the case $N \le K$, these proposed schemes lead to the optimal memory-rate tradeoff of the demand private coded caching problem for $M \in \big[0, \frac{N}{(K+1)(N-1)} \big] $ where $N \le K \le 2N-2$, and the optimal memory-rate tradeoff for $M \in \big[0, \frac{1}{K+1} \big] $ where $ K > 2N-2$. Moreover, for the case of 2 files and arbitrary number of users, by deriving another new converse bound, the optimal memory-rate tradeoff is characterized for $M\in \big[0,\frac{2}{K}\big] \cup \big[\frac{2(K-1)}{K+1},2\big]$. Finally, we provide the optimal memory-rate tradeoff of the demand private coded caching problem for 2 files and 3 users.

### Efficient GNN Training Through Structure-Aware Randomized Mini-Batching
**Authors**: Vignesh Balaji, Christos Kozyrakis, Gal Chechik, Haggai Maron

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T05:16:53Z

**Summary**: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) enable learning on realworld graphs and mini-batch training has emerged as the de facto standard for training GNNs because it can scale to very large graphs and improve convergence. Current mini-batch construction policies largely ignore efficiency considerations of GNN training. Specifically, existing mini-batching techniques employ randomization schemes to improve accuracy and convergence. However, these randomization schemes are often agnostic to the structural properties of the graph (for eg. community structure), resulting in highly irregular memory access patterns during GNN training that make suboptimal use of on-chip GPU caches. On the other hand, while deterministic mini-batching based solely on graph structure delivers fast runtime performance, the lack of randomness compromises both the final model accuracy and training convergence speed. In this paper, we present Community-structure-aware Randomized Mini-batching (COMM-RAND), a novel methodology that bridges the gap between the above extremes. COMM-RAND allows practitioners to explore the space between pure randomness and pure graph structural awareness during mini-batch construction, leading to significantly more efficient GNN training with similar accuracy. We evaluated COMM-RAND across four popular graph learning benchmarks. COMM-RAND cuts down GNN training time by up to 2.76x (1.8x on average) while achieving an accuracy that is within 1.79% points (0.42% on average) compared to popular random mini-batching approaches.

### Optimizing ML Concurrent Computation and Communication with GPU DMA   Engines
**Authors**: Anirudha Agrawal, Shaizeen Aga, Suchita Pati, Mahzabeen Islam

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T05:08:45Z

**Summary**: Concurrent computation and communication (C3) is a pervasive paradigm in ML and other domains, making its performance optimization crucial. In this paper, we carefully characterize C3 in ML on GPUs, which are most widely deployed for ML training and inference. We observe that while C3 leads to performance uplifts, the uplifts are far lower than ideal speedups (serial computation and communication versus maximum of computation or communication; all times from isolated executions). That is, C3 on average achieves only 21% of ideal speedup. This is so, due to known challenges of compute and memory interference between concurrent GPU kernels (that is, sharing of GPU's compute units, caches and HBM).   To attain better performance for C3, first, we evaluate dual strategies of schedule prioritization and careful resource partitioning of compute units on GPUs to push performance attained with C3 (on average 42% of ideal speedup). We also provide heuristics that can guide a runtime while employing these strategies. To further enhance C3 performance, we propose to mitigate C3 interference by offloading communication tasks to the GPU's DMA engines. To this end, we build concurrent communication collectives (ConCCL) proof-of-concepts that harness DMA engines for communication. We show how ConCCL considerably closes the gap between realized and ideal speedup for C3 (on average 72% of ideal speedup is realized, up to 1.67x speedup). Overall, our work makes a strong case for GPU DMA engine advancements to better support C3 on GPUs.

### Fluctuated lattice-driven charge density wave far above the condensation   temperature in kagome superconductor KV$_3$Sb$_5$
**Authors**: Haoran Liu, Shaofeng Duan, Xiangqi Liu, Zhihua Liu, Shichong Wang, Lingxiao Gu, Jiongyu Huang, Wenxuan Yang, Jianzhe Liu, Dong Qian, Yanfeng Guo, Wentao Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T05:05:49Z

**Summary**: The kagome material AV$_3$Sb$_5$ exhibits multiple exotic orders, including an unconventional charge density wave (CDW). Elucidating the underlying mechanism behind the CDW transition is crucial for unraveling the complex interactions among these phases. However, the driving force of the CDW remains a topic of debate due to the intertwined interactions among the system's various excitations. Here we investigated the CDW transition in KV$_3$Sb$_5$ by isolating the ultrafast electronic phase transition using time- and angleresolved photoemission spectroscopy. An ultrafast electronic phase transition was observed at a critical photoexcitation fluence, F$_c$, without reduction in CDW lattice-distortion-induced band folding. This folded band persisted up to 150 K under equilibrium heating, well above the CDW condensation temperature of T$_c$ = 78 K. Notably, the pump-induced band shifts at F$_c$ were comparable to those caused by thermal effects at T$_c$. These findings suggest that in KV$_3$Sb$_5$, a fluctuating lattice-driven in-plane CDW emerges above 150 K, with out-of-plane electronic correlations leading to the $2\times2 \times 2$ CDW near T$_c$, offering key insights into the interplay between the electronic and structural dynamics in AV$_3$Sb$_5$.

### Role of On-site and Inter-site Coulomb Interactions in KV$_3$Sb$_5$: A   first-principles DFT+$U$+$V$ study
**Authors**: Indukuru Ramesh Reddy, Sayandeep Ghosh, Bongjae Kim, Chang-Jong Kang

**Updated**: 2025-04-25T00:41:43Z

**Summary**: Nonlocal Coulomb interactions play a crucial role in stabilizing distinct electronic phases in kagome materials. In this work, we systematically investigate the effects of on-site ($U$) and inter-site ($V$) Coulomb interactions on the electronic structure and stability of charge-density-wave (CDW) phases in the kagome metal KV$_3$Sb$_5$ using density functional theory (DFT+$U$+$V$) calculations. We demonstrate that $V$ promotes the formation and stability of CDW phases, whereas $U$ suppresses these phases, highlighting a fundamental competition between local and nonlocal electronic correlations. By directly comparing our theoretical results with angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) data, we identify realistic values of $U$ and $V$ that accurately describe the electronic band structure of KV$_3$Sb$_5$. Our findings establish a detailed $U$-$V$ phase diagram for KV$_3$Sb$_5$, offering valuable insights into the correlated electronic states in kagome metals and serving as a foundation for future explorations of correlation-driven phenomena in related materials.

**Updated**: 2025-04-24T18:09:25Z

**Summary**: The need for a microscopic description of scintillation light generation in liquid argon becomes increasingly desirable with the upcoming operation of large scale LArTPCs in the next decade. While a detailed mathematical account of the process is still to be achieved, a phenomenological model for simultaneously treating ionization and scintillation, LArQL, has been successfully employed to describe the range of electric fields from 0 to 0.75 kV/cm and dE/dx from 2 to 40 MeV/cm providing the anti-correlation between the free ionization charge and scintillation light. A reanalysis of the original model parameter values has been performed within a global fit procedure and is presented.

### L3: DIMM-PIM Integrated Architecture and Coordination for Scalable   Long-Context LLM Inference
**Authors**: Qingyuan Liu, Liyan Chen, Yanning Yang, Haocheng Wang, Dong Du, Zhigang Mao, Naifeng Jing, Yubin Xia, Haibo Chen

**Updated**: 2025-04-24T14:14:07Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly require processing long text sequences, but GPU memory limitations force difficult trade-offs between memory capacity and bandwidth. While HBM-based acceleration offers high bandwidth, its capacity remains constrained. Offloading data to host-side DIMMs improves capacity but introduces costly data swapping overhead. We identify that the critical memory bottleneck lies in the decoding phase of multi-head attention (MHA) exclusively, which demands substantial capacity for storing KV caches and high bandwidth for attention computation. Our key insight reveals this operation uniquely aligns with modern DIMM-based processing-in-memory (PIM) architectures, which offers scalability of both capacity and bandwidth.   Based on this observation and insight, we propose L3, a hardware-software co-designed system integrating DIMM-PIM and GPU devices. L3 introduces three innovations: First, hardware redesigns resolve data layout mismatches and computational element mismatches in DIMM-PIM, enhancing LLM inference utilization. Second, communication optimization enables hiding the data transfer overhead with the computation. Third, an adaptive scheduler coordinates GPU-DIMM-PIM operations to maximize parallelism between devices. Evaluations using real-world traces show L3 achieves up to 6.1$\times$ speedup over state-of-the-art HBM-PIM solutions while significantly improving batch sizes.

### Rethinking PM Crash Consistency in the CXL Era
**Authors**: João Oliveira, João Gonçalves, Miguel Matos

**Updated**: 2025-04-24T13:47:35Z

**Summary**: Persistent Memory (PM) introduces new opportunities for designing crash-consistent applications without the traditional storage overheads. However, ensuring crash consistency in PM demands intricate knowledge of CPU, cache, and memory interactions. Hardware and software mechanisms have been proposed to ease this burden, but neither proved sufficient, prompting a variety of bug detection tools.   With the sunset of Intel Optane comes the rise of Compute Express Link (CXL) for PM. In this position paper, we discuss the impact of CXL's disaggregated and heterogeneous nature in the development of crash-consistent PM applications, and outline three research directions: hardware primitives, persistency frameworks, and bug detection tools.

### Rethinking Programmed I/O for Fast Devices, Cheap Cores, and Coherent   Interconnects
**Authors**: Anastasiia Ruzhanskaia, Pengcheng Xu, David Cock, Timothy Roscoe

**Updated**: 2025-04-24T08:39:13Z

**Summary**: Conventional wisdom holds that an efficient interface between an OS running on a CPU and a high-bandwidth I/O device should use Direct Memory Access (DMA) to offload data transfer, descriptor rings for buffering and queuing, and interrupts for asynchrony between cores and device.   In this paper we question this wisdom in the light of two trends: modern and emerging cache-coherent interconnects like CXL3.0, and workloads, particularly microservices and serverless computing. Like some others before us, we argue that the assumptions of the DMA-based model are obsolete, and in many use-cases programmed I/O, where the CPU explicitly transfers data and control information to and from a device via loads and stores, delivers a more efficient system.   However, we push this idea much further. We show, in a real hardware implementation, the gains in latency for fine-grained communication achievable using an open cache-coherence protocol which exposes cache transitions to a smart device, and that throughput is competitive with DMA over modern interconnects. We also demonstrate three use-cases: fine-grained RPC-style invocation of functions on an accelerator, offloading of operators in a streaming dataflow engine, and a network interface targeting serverless functions, comparing our use of coherence with both traditional DMA-style interaction and a highly-optimized implementation using memory-mapped programmed I/O over PCIe.

### SPAARC: Spatial Proximity and Association based prefetching for   Augmented Reality in edge Cache
**Authors**: Nikhil Sreekumar, Abhishek Chandra, Jon Weissman

**Updated**: 2025-04-24T04:36:20Z

**Summary**: Mobile Augmented Reality (MAR) applications face performance challenges due to their high computational demands and need for low-latency responses. Traditional approaches like on-device storage or reactive data fetching from the cloud often result in limited AR experiences or unacceptable lag. Edge caching, which caches AR objects closer to the user, provides a promising solution. However, existing edge caching approaches do not consider AR-specific features such as AR object sizes, user interactions, and physical location. This paper investigates how to further optimize edge caching by employing AR-aware prefetching techniques. We present SPAARC, a Spatial Proximity and Association-based Prefetching policy specifically designed for MAR Caches. SPAARC intelligently prioritizes the caching of virtual objects based on their association with other similar objects and the user's proximity to them. It also considers the recency of associations and uses a lazy fetching strategy to efficiently manage edge resources and maximize Quality of Experience (QoE).   Through extensive evaluation using both synthetic and real-world workloads, we demonstrate that SPAARC significantly improves cache hit rates compared to standard caching algorithms, achieving gains ranging from 3% to 40% while reducing the need for on-demand data retrieval from the cloud. Further, we present an adaptive tuning algorithm that automatically tunes SPAARC parameters to achieve optimal performance. Our findings demonstrate the potential of SPAARC to substantially enhance the user experience in MAR applications by ensuring the timely availability of virtual objects.

### Efficient Pretraining Length Scaling
**Authors**: Bohong Wu, Shen Yan, Sijun Zhang, Jianqiao Lu, Yutao Zeng, Ya Wang, Xun Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-04-24T04:13:49Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in large language models have demonstrated the effectiveness of length scaling during post-training, yet its potential in pre-training remains underexplored. We present the Parallel Hidden Decoding Transformer (\textit{PHD}-Transformer), a novel framework that enables efficient length scaling during pre-training while maintaining inference efficiency. \textit{PHD}-Transformer achieves this through an innovative KV cache management strategy that distinguishes between original tokens and hidden decoding tokens. By retaining only the KV cache of original tokens for long-range dependencies while immediately discarding hidden decoding tokens after use, our approach maintains the same KV cache size as the vanilla transformer while enabling effective length scaling. To further enhance performance, we introduce two optimized variants: \textit{PHD-SWA} employs sliding window attention to preserve local dependencies, while \textit{PHD-CSWA} implements chunk-wise sliding window attention to eliminate linear growth in pre-filling time. Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent improvements across multiple benchmarks.

### Cognitive Memory in Large Language Models
**Authors**: Lianlei Shan, Shixian Luo, Zezhou Zhu, Yu Yuan, Yong Wu

**Updated**: 2025-04-24T01:47:25Z

**Summary**: This paper examines memory mechanisms in Large Language Models (LLMs), emphasizing their importance for context-rich responses, reduced hallucinations, and improved efficiency. It categorizes memory into sensory, short-term, and long-term, with sensory memory corresponding to input prompts, short-term memory processing immediate context, and long-term memory implemented via external databases or structures. The text-based memory section covers acquisition (selection and summarization), management (updating, accessing, storing, and resolving conflicts), and utilization (full-text search, SQL queries, semantic search). The KV cache-based memory section discusses selection methods (regularity-based summarization, score-based approaches, special token embeddings) and compression techniques (low-rank compression, KV merging, multimodal compression), along with management strategies like offloading and shared attention mechanisms. Parameter-based memory methods (LoRA, TTT, MoE) transform memories into model parameters to enhance efficiency, while hidden-state-based memory approaches (chunk mechanisms, recurrent transformers, Mamba model) improve long-text processing by combining RNN hidden states with current methods. Overall, the paper offers a comprehensive analysis of LLM memory mechanisms, highlighting their significance and future research directions.

### KeyDiff: Key Similarity-Based KV Cache Eviction for Long-Context LLM   Inference in Resource-Constrained Environments
**Authors**: Junyoung Park, Dalton Jones, Matt J Morse, Raghavv Goel, Mingu Lee, Chris Lott

**Updated**: 2025-04-23T18:02:55Z

**Summary**: In this work, we demonstrate that distinctive keys during LLM inference tend to have high attention scores. We explore this phenomenon and propose KeyDiff, a training-free KV cache eviction method based on key similarity. This method facilitates the deployment of LLM-based application requiring long input prompts in resource-constrained environments with limited memory and compute budgets. Unlike other KV cache eviction methods, KeyDiff can process arbitrarily long prompts within strict resource constraints and efficiently generate responses. We demonstrate that KeyDiff computes the optimal solution to a KV cache selection problem that maximizes key diversity, providing a theoretical understanding of KeyDiff. Notably,KeyDiff does not rely on attention scores, allowing the use of optimized attention mechanisms like FlashAttention. We demonstrate the effectiveness of KeyDiff across diverse tasks and models, illustrating a performance gap of less than 0.04\% with 8K cache budget ($\sim$ 23\% KV cache reduction) from the non-evicting baseline on the LongBench benchmark for Llama 3.1-8B and Llama 3.2-3B.

### Iris: A Next Generation Digital Pathology Rendering Engine
**Authors**: Ryan Erik Landvater, Ulysses Balis

**Updated**: 2025-04-23T15:02:16Z

**Summary**: Digital pathology is a tool of rapidly evolving importance within the discipline of pathology. Whole slide imaging promises numerous advantages; however, adoption is limited by challenges in ease of use and speed of high-quality image rendering relative to the simplicity and visual quality of glass slides. We introduce Iris, a new high-performance digital pathology rendering system. Specifically, we outline and detail the performance metrics of Iris Core, the core rendering engine technology. Iris Core comprises machine code modules written from the ground up in C++ and using Vulkan, a low-level and low-overhead cross-platform graphical processing unit application program interface, and our novel rapid tile buffering algorithms. We provide a detailed explanation of Iris Core's system architecture, including the stateless isolation of core processes, interprocess communication paradigms, and explicit synchronization paradigms that provide powerful control over the graphical processing unit. Iris Core achieves slide rendering at the sustained maximum frame rate on all tested platforms and buffers an entire new slide field of, view without overlapping pixels, in 10 ms with enhanced detail in 30 ms. It is able to buffer and compute high-fidelity reduction-enhancements for viewing low-power cytology with increased visual quality at a rate of 100-160 us per slide tile, and with a cumulative median buffering rate of 1.36 GB of decompressed image data per second. This buffering rate allows for an entirely new field of view to be fully buffered and rendered in less than a single monitor refresh on a standard display, and high detail features within 2-3 monitor refresh frames. These metrics far exceed previously published specifications, beyond an order of magnitude in some contexts. The system shows no slowing with high use loads, but rather increases performance due to cache mechanisms.

### The NIC should be part of the OS
**Authors**: Pengcheng Xu, Timothy Roscoe

**Updated**: 2025-04-23T10:48:52Z

**Summary**: The network interface adapter (NIC) is a critical component of a cloud server occupying a unique position. Not only is network performance vital to efficient operation of the machine, but unlike compute accelerators like GPUs, the network subsystem must react to unpredictable events like the arrival of a network packet and communicate with the appropriate application end point with minimal latency.   Current approaches to server stacks navigate a trade-off between flexibility, efficiency, and performance: the fastest kernel-bypass approaches dedicate cores to applications, busy-wait on receive queues, etc. while more flexible approaches appropriate to more dynamic workload mixes incur much greater software overhead on the data path.   However, we reject this trade-off, which we ascribe to an arbitrary (and sub-optimal) split in system state between the OS and the NIC. Instead, by exploiting the properties of cache-coherent interconnects and integrating the NIC closely with the OS kernel, we can achieve something surprising: performance for RPC workloads better than the fastest kernelbypass approaches without sacrificing the robustness and dynamic adaptation of kernel-based network subsystems.

### CAOTE: KV Caching through Attention Output Error based Token Eviction
**Authors**: Raghavv Goel, Junyoung Park, Mukul Gagrani, Dalton Jones, Matthew Morse, Harper Langston, Mingu Lee, Chris Lott

**Updated**: 2025-04-23T05:04:58Z

**Summary**: While long context support of large language models has extended their abilities, it also incurs challenges in memory and compute which becomes crucial bottlenecks in resource-restricted devices. Token eviction, a widely adopted post-training methodology designed to alleviate the bottlenecks by evicting less important tokens from the cache, typically uses attention scores as proxy metrics for token importance. However, one major limitation of attention score as a token-wise importance metrics is that it lacks the information about contribution of tokens to the attention output. In this paper, we propose a simple eviction criterion based on the contribution of cached tokens to attention outputs. Our method, CAOTE, optimizes for eviction error due to token eviction, by seamlessly integrating attention scores and value vectors. This is the first method which uses value vector information on top of attention-based eviction scores. Additionally, CAOTE can act as a meta-heuristic method with flexible usage with any token eviction method. We show that CAOTE, when combined with the state-of-the-art attention score-based methods, always improves accuracies on the downstream task, indicating the importance of leveraging information from values during token eviction process.

### ML-based Adaptive Prefetching and Data Placement for US HEP Systems
**Authors**: Venkat Sai Suman Lamba Karanam, Sarat Sasank Barla, Byrav Ramamurthy, Derek Weitzel

**Updated**: 2025-04-23T04:21:49Z

**Summary**: Although benefits from caching in US HEP are well-known, current caching strategies are not adaptive i.e they do not adapt to changing cache access patterns. Newer developments such as the High-Luminosity - Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC), Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE), a steady move toward streaming readout based Data Acquisition systems (DAQs) will increase the data production exponentially and hence burden the storage, compute & network infrastructures. Moreover, existing caching frameworks are optimized to reduce latency, but not optimized for storage. This, in combination with limited cache capacities relative to total data, makes it difficult to achieve data locality.   In this work, we present Machine Learning-aided (ML) caching strategies. Specifically, we first present a Long Short-Term Memory-based (LSTM) hourly and multi-step cache usage prediction. Second, we present an hourly file-level access prediction model based on CatboostRegressor. To date, most ML-based cache prediction strategies in HEP have focused on daily cache usage and limited works tackled hourly cache usage and even fewer strategies addressed hourly file-level access prediction. File-level access prediction allows for the design of intelligent prefetching and data placement strategies with fine-grained control. We validated our cache prediction strategies using data collected from SoCal MINI caches in August 2024. We are currently extending the WRENCH simulator to reflect the US HEP ecosystem at the storage, network and compute levels. We plan to deploy our cache prediction strategies into WRENCH and later perform extensive analysis with complex data access patterns and candidate infrastructure configurations.

### The Dawn of Disaggregation and the Coherence Conundrum: A Call for   Federated Coherence
**Authors**: Jaewan Hong, Marcos K. Aguilera, Emmanuel Amaro, Vincent Liu, Aurojit Panda, Ion Stoica

**Updated**: 2025-04-22T23:52:13Z

**Summary**: Disaggregated memory is an upcoming data center technology that will allow nodes (servers) to share data efficiently. Sharing data creates a debate on the level of cache coherence the system should provide. While current proposals aim to provide coherence for all or parts of the disaggregated memory, we argue that this approach is problematic, because of scalability limitations and hardware complexity. Instead, we propose and formally define federated coherence, a model that provides coherence only within nodes, not across nodes. Federated coherence can use current intra-node coherence provided by processors without requiring expensive mechanisms for inter-node coherence. Developers can use federated coherence with a few simple programming paradigms and a synchronization library. We sketch some potential applications.

**Updated**: 2025-04-22T17:34:34Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in generating text, images, and video content. However, as context length grows, the computational cost of attention increases quadratically with the number of tokens, presenting significant efficiency challenges. This paper presents an analysis of various Key-Value (KV) cache compression strategies, offering a comprehensive taxonomy that categorizes these methods by their underlying principles and implementation techniques. Furthermore, we evaluate their impact on performance and inference latency, providing critical insights into their effectiveness. Our findings highlight the trade-offs involved in KV cache compression and its influence on handling long-context scenarios, paving the way for more efficient LLM implementations.

### GainSight: Application-Guided Profiling for Composing Heterogeneous   On-Chip Memories in AI Hardware Accelerators
**Authors**: Peijing Li, Matthew Hung, Yiming Tan, Konstantin Hoßfeld, Jake Cheng Jiajun, Shuhan Liu, Lixian Yan, Xinxin Wang, H. -S. Philip Wong, Thierry Tambe

**Updated**: 2025-04-22T17:23:28Z

**Summary**: As AI workloads drive soaring memory requirements, there is a need for higher-density on-chip memory for domain-specific accelerators that goes beyond what current SRAM technology can provide. We motivate that algorithms and application behavior should guide the composition of heterogeneous on-chip memories. However, there has been little work in factoring dynamic application profiles into such design decisions. We present GainSight, a profiling framework that analyzes fine-grained memory access patterns and computes data lifetimes in domain-specific accelerators. By combining instrumentation and simulation across retargetable hardware backends, GainSight aligns heterogeneous memory designs with workload-specific traffic and lifetime metrics. Case studies on MLPerf Inference and PolyBench workloads using NVIDIA H100 GPUs and systolic arrays reveal key insights: (1) 40% of L1 and 18% of L2 GPU cache accesses, and 79% of systolic array scratchpad accesses across profiled workloads are short-lived and suitable for silicon-based gain cell RAM (Si-GCRAM); (2) Si-GCRAM reduces active energy by 11-28% compared to SRAM; (3) Up to 90% of GPU cache fetches are never reused, highlighting inefficiencies in terms of cache pollution. These insights that GainSight provides can be used to better understand the design spaces of both emerging on-chip memories and software algorithmic optimizations for the next generation of AI accelerators.

**Authors**: Weihao Cui, Yukang Chen, Han Zhao, Ziyi Xu, Quan Chen, Xusheng Chen, Yangjie Zhou, Shixuan Sun, Minyi Guo

**Updated**: 2025-04-22T15:19:48Z

**Summary**: Modern LLM services demand high throughput and stringent SLO guarantees across two distinct inference phases-prefill and decode-and complex multi-turn workflows. However, current systems face a fundamental tradeoff: out-of-place compute partition enables per-phase SLO attainment, while in-place memory sharing maximizes throughput via KV cache reuse. Moreover, existing in-place compute partition also encounters low utilization and high overhead due to phase-coupling design. We present Drift, a new LLM serving framework that resolves this tension via PD multiplexing, enabling in-place and phase-decoupled compute partition. Drift leverages low-level GPU partitioning techniques to multiplex prefill and decode phases spatially and adaptively on shared GPUs, while preserving in-place memory sharing. To fully leverage the multiplexing capability, Drift introduces an adaptive gang scheduling mechanism, a contention-free modeling method, and a SLO-aware dispatching policy. Evaluation shows that Drift achieves an average $5.1\times$ throughput improvement (up to $17.5\times$) over state-of-the-art baselines, while consistently meeting SLO targets under complex LLM workloads.

### SeaLLM: Service-Aware and Latency-Optimized Resource Sharing for Large   Language Model Inference
**Authors**: Yihao Zhao, Jiadun Chen, Peng Sun, Lei Li, Xuanzhe Liu, Xin Jin

**Updated**: 2025-04-22T09:08:46Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) with different architectures and sizes have been developed. Serving each LLM with dedicated GPUs leads to resource waste and service inefficiency due to the varying demand of LLM requests. A common practice is to share multiple LLMs. However, existing sharing systems either do not consider the autoregressive pattern of LLM services, or only focus on improving the throughput, which impairs the sharing performance, especially the serving latency. We present SeaLLM, which enables service-aware and latency-optimized LLM sharing. SeaLLM improves the overall sharing performance by (1) a latency-optimized scheduling algorithm utilizing the characteristics of LLM services, (2) a placement algorithm to determine the placement plan and an adaptive replacement algorithm to decide the replacement interval, and (3) a unified key-value cache to share GPU memory among LLM services efficiently. Our evaluation under real-world traces and LLM services demonstrates that SeaLLM improves the normalized latency by up to $13.60\times$, the tail latency by up to $18.69\times$, and the SLO attainment by up to $3.64\times$ compared to existing solutions.

### Reimagining Memory Access for LLM Inference: Compression-Aware Memory   Controller Design
**Authors**: Rui Xie, Asad Ul Haq, Linsen Ma, Yunhua Fang, Zirak Burzin Engineer, Liu Liu, Tong Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T22:13:07Z

**Summary**: The efficiency of Large Language Model~(LLM) inference is often constrained by substantial memory bandwidth and capacity demands. Existing techniques, such as pruning, quantization, and mixture of experts/depth, reduce memory capacity and/or bandwidth consumption at the cost of slight degradation in inference quality. This paper introduces a design solution that further alleviates memory bottlenecks by enhancing the on-chip memory controller in AI accelerators to achieve two main objectives: (1) significantly reducing memory capacity and bandwidth usage through lossless block compression~(e.g., LZ4 and ZSTD) of model weights and key-value (KV) cache without compromising inference quality, and (2) enabling memory bandwidth and energy consumption to scale proportionally with context-dependent dynamic quantization. These goals are accomplished by equipping the on-chip memory controller with mechanisms to improve fine-grained bit-level accessibility and compressibility of weights and KV cache through LLM-aware configuration of in-memory placement and representation. Experimental results on publicly available LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, showing memory footprint reductions of 25.2\% for model weights and 46.9\% for KV cache. In addition, our hardware prototype at 4\,GHz and 32 lanes (7\,nm) achieves 8\,TB/s throughput with a modest area overhead (under 3.8\,mm\(^2\)), which underscores the viability of LLM-aware memory control as a key to efficient large-scale inference.

**Authors**: Zihao Ye, Lequn Chen, Ruihang Lai, Wuwei Lin, Yineng Zhang, Stephanie Wang, Tianqi Chen, Baris Kasikci, Vinod Grover, Arvind Krishnamurthy, Luis Ceze

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T20:10:11Z

**Summary**: Transformers, driven by attention mechanisms, form the foundation of large language models (LLMs). As these models scale up, efficient GPU attention kernels become essential for high-throughput and low-latency inference. Diverse LLM applications demand flexible and high-performance attention solutions. We present FlashInfer: a customizable and efficient attention engine for LLM serving. FlashInfer tackles KV-cache storage heterogeneity using block-sparse format and composable formats to optimize memory access and reduce redundancy. It also offers a customizable attention template, enabling adaptation to various settings through Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation. Additionally, FlashInfer's load-balanced scheduling algorithm adjusts to dynamism of user requests while maintaining compatibility with CUDAGraph which requires static configuration. FlashInfer have been integrated into leading LLM serving frameworks like SGLang, vLLM and MLC-Engine. Comprehensive kernel-level and end-to-end evaluations demonstrate FlashInfer's ability to significantly boost kernel performance across diverse inference scenarios: compared to state-of-the-art LLM serving solutions, FlashInfer achieve 29-69% inter-token-latency reduction compared to compiler backends for LLM serving benchmark, 28-30% latency reduction for long-context inference, and 13-17% speedup for LLM serving with parallel generation.

### Joint Knowledge and Power Management for Secure Semantic Communication   Networks
**Authors**: Xuesong Liu, Yansong Liu, Haoyu Tang, Fangzhou Zhao, Le Xia, Yao Sun

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T17:39:59Z

**Summary**: Recently, semantic communication (SemCom) has shown its great superiorities in resource savings and information exchanges. However, while its unique background knowledge guarantees accurate semantic reasoning and recovery, semantic information security-related concerns are introduced at the same time. Since the potential eavesdroppers may have the same background knowledge to accurately decrypt the private semantic information transmitted between legal SemCom users, this makes the knowledge management in SemCom networks rather challenging in joint consideration with the power control. To this end, this paper focuses on jointly addressing three core issues of power allocation, knowledge base caching (KBC), and device-to-device (D2D) user pairing (DUP) in secure SemCom networks. We first develop a novel performance metric, namely semantic secrecy throughput (SST), to quantify the information security level that can be achieved at each pair of D2D SemCom users. Next, an SST maximization problem is formulated subject to secure SemCom-related delay and reliability constraints. Afterward, we propose a security-aware resource management solution using the Lagrange primal-dual method and a two-stage method. Simulation results demonstrate our proposed solution nearly doubles the SST performance and realizes less than half of the queuing delay performance compared to different benchmarks.

### Lance: Efficient Random Access in Columnar Storage through Adaptive   Structural Encodings
**Authors**: Weston Pace, Chang She, Lei Xu, Will Jones, Albert Lockett, Jun Wang, Raunak Shah

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T17:22:18Z

**Summary**: The growing interest in artificial intelligence has created workloads that require both sequential and random access. At the same time, NVMe-backed storage solutions have emerged, providing caching capability for large columnar datasets in cloud storage. Current columnar storage libraries fall short of effectively utilizing an NVMe device's capabilities, especially when it comes to random access. Historically, this has been assumed an implicit weakness in columnar storage formats, but this has not been sufficiently explored. In this paper, we examine the effectiveness of popular columnar formats such as Apache Arrow, Apache Parquet, and Lance in both random access and full scan tasks against NVMe storage.   We argue that effective encoding of a column's structure, such as the repetition and validity information, is the key to unlocking the disk's performance. We show that Parquet, when configured correctly, can achieve over 60x better random access performance than default settings. We also show that this high random access performance requires making minor trade-offs in scan performance and RAM utilization. We then describe the Lance structural encoding scheme, which alternates between two different structural encodings based on data width, and achieves better random access performance without making trade-offs in scan performance or RAM utilization.

### A Unified Framework for Quantitative Cache Analysis
**Authors**: Sophie Kahlen, Jan Reineke

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T15:36:53Z

**Summary**: In this work we unify two existing lines of work towards cache analysis for non-LRU policies. To this end, we extend the notion of competitiveness to block competitiveness and systematically analyze the competitiveness and block competitiveness of FIFO and MRU relative to LRU for arbitrary associativities. We show how competitiveness and block competitiveness can be exploited in state-of-the-art WCET analysis based on the results of existing persistence analyses for LRU. Unlike prior work, our approach is applicable to microarchitectures that exhibit timing anomalies. We experimentally evaluate the precision and cost of our approach on benchmarks from TACLeBench. The experiments demonstrate that quantitative cache analysis for FIFO and MRU comes close to the precision of LRU.

### LServe: Efficient Long-sequence LLM Serving with Unified Sparse   Attention
**Authors**: Shang Yang, Junxian Guo, Haotian Tang, Qinghao Hu, Guangxuan Xiao, Jiaming Tang, Yujun Lin, Zhijian Liu, Yao Lu, Song Han

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T15:13:44Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable potential in processing long sequences and complex reasoning tasks, yet efficiently serving these models remains challenging due to the quadratic computational complexity of attention in the prefilling stage and the large memory footprint of the KV cache in the decoding stage. To address these issues, we introduce LServe, an efficient system that accelerates long-sequence LLM serving via hybrid sparse attention. This method unifies different hardware-friendly, structured sparsity patterns for both prefilling and decoding attention into a single framework, where computations on less important tokens are skipped block-wise. LServe demonstrates the compatibility of static and dynamic sparsity in long-context LLM attention. This design enables multiplicative speedups by combining these optimizations. Specifically, we convert half of the attention heads to nearly free streaming heads in both the prefilling and decoding stages. Additionally, we find that only a constant number of KV pages is required to preserve long-context and reasoning capabilities, irrespective of context length. We then design a hierarchical KV page selection policy that dynamically prunes KV pages based on query-centric similarity. On average, LServe accelerates LLM prefilling by up to 2.9x and decoding by 1.3-2.1x over vLLM, maintaining long-context accuracy. Code is released at https://github.com/mit-han-lab/omniserve.

### Is Intelligence the Right Direction in New OS Scheduling for Multiple   Resources in Cloud Environments?
**Authors**: Xinglei Dou, Lei Liu, Limin Xiao

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T11:09:43Z

**Summary**: Making it intelligent is a promising way in System/OS design. This paper proposes OSML+, a new ML-based resource scheduling mechanism for co-located cloud services. OSML+ intelligently schedules the cache and main memory bandwidth resources at the memory hierarchy and the computing core resources simultaneously. OSML+ uses a multi-model collaborative learning approach during its scheduling and thus can handle complicated cases, e.g., avoiding resource cliffs, sharing resources among applications, enabling different scheduling policies for applications with different priorities, etc. OSML+ can converge faster using ML models than previous studies. Moreover, OSML+ can automatically learn on the fly and handle dynamically changing workloads accordingly. Using transfer learning technologies, we show our design can work well across various cloud servers, including the latest off-the-shelf large-scale servers. Our experimental results show that OSML+ supports higher loads and meets QoS targets with lower overheads than previous studies.

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T03:40:10Z

**Summary**: We present context parallelism for long-context large language model inference, which achieves near-linear scaling for long-context prefill latency with up to 128 H100 GPUs across 16 nodes. Particularly, our method achieves 1M context prefill with Llama3 405B model in 77s (93% parallelization efficiency, 63% FLOPS utilization) and 128K context prefill in 3.8s. We develop two lossless exact ring attention variants: pass-KV and pass-Q to cover a wide range of use cases with the state-of-the-art performance: full prefill, persistent KV prefill and decode. Benchmarks on H100 GPU hosts inter-connected with RDMA and TCP both show similar scalability for long-context prefill, demonstrating that our method scales well using common commercial data center with medium-to-low inter-host bandwidth.

### gLLM: Global Balanced Pipeline Parallelism System for Distributed LLM   Serving with Token Throttling
**Authors**: Tianyu Guo, Xianwei Zhang, Jiangsu Du, Zhiguang Chen, Nong Xiao, Yutong Lu

**Updated**: 2025-04-21T00:07:49Z

**Summary**: Pipeline parallelism has emerged as a predominant approach for deploying large language models (LLMs) across distributed nodes, owing to its lower communication overhead compared to tensor parallelism. While demonstrating high throughput in request serving, pipeline parallelism often suffers from performance limitations caused by pipeline bubbles, which are primarily resulted from imbalanced computation delays across batches. Existing methods like Sarathi-Serve attempt to address this through hybrid scheduling of chunked prefill and decode tokens using a fixed token budget. However, such methods may experience significant fluctuations due to either insufficient prefill tokens or uneven distribution of decode tokens, ultimately leading to computational imbalance. To overcome these inefficiencies, we present gLLM, a globally balanced pipeline parallelism system incorporating Token Throttling to effectively mitigate the pipeline bubbles. Our Token Throttling mechanism is a fine-grained scheduling policy that independently regulates the quantities of prefill and decode tokens, thus enabling balanced computation by leveraging global information from the inference system. Specifically, for decode tokens, gLLM maintains near-consistent token count across processing batches. For prefill tokens, it dynamically adjusts batch sizes based on both total pending tokens and the memory utilization rates of key-value cache (KV cache). Furthermore, gLLM runtime adopts an asynchronous execution and message passing architecture specifically optimized for pipeline parallelism characteristics. Experimental evaluations with representative LLMs show that gLLM achieves significant performance improvements, delivering 11% to 398% higher maximum throughput compared to state-of-the-art pipeline or tensor parallelism systems, while simultaneously maintaining lower latency.

### Star Attention: Efficient LLM Inference over Long Sequences
**Authors**: Shantanu Acharya, Fei Jia, Boris Ginsburg

**Updated**: 2025-04-20T21:50:03Z

**Summary**: Inference with Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) on long sequences is both costly and slow due to the quadratic complexity of the self-attention mechanism. We introduce Star Attention, a two-phase block-sparse approximation that improves computational efficiency by sharding attention across multiple hosts while minimizing communication overhead. In the first phase, the context is processed using blockwise-local attention across hosts, in parallel. In the second phase, query and response tokens attend to all prior cached tokens through sequence-global attention. Star Attention integrates seamlessly with most Transformer-based LLMs trained with global attention, reducing memory requirements and inference time by up to 11x while preserving 97-100% of accuracy.

**Authors**: Abhimanyu Rajeshkumar Bambhaniya, Hanjiang Wu, Suvinay Subramanian, Sudarshan Srinivasan, Souvik Kundu, Amir Yazdanbakhsh, Midhilesh Elavazhagan, Madhu Kumar, Tushar Krishna

**Updated**: 2025-04-20T19:57:16Z

**Summary**: The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has driven the need for increasingly sophisticated inference pipelines and hardware platforms. Modern LLM serving extends beyond traditional prefill-decode workflows, incorporating multi-stage processes such as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), key-value (KV) cache retrieval, dynamic model routing, and multi step reasoning. These stages exhibit diverse computational demands, requiring distributed systems that integrate GPUs, ASICs, CPUs, and memory-centric architectures. However, existing simulators lack the fidelity to model these heterogeneous, multi-engine workflows, limiting their ability to inform architectural decisions.   To address this gap, we introduce HERMES, a Heterogeneous Multi-stage LLM inference Execution Simulator. HERMES models diverse request stages; including RAG, KV retrieval, reasoning, prefill, and decode across complex hardware hierarchies. HERMES supports heterogeneous clients executing multiple models concurrently unlike prior frameworks while incorporating advanced batching strategies and multi-level memory hierarchies. By integrating real hardware traces with analytical modeling, HERMES captures critical trade-offs such as memory bandwidth contention, inter-cluster communication latency, and batching efficiency in hybrid CPU-accelerator deployments. Through case studies, we explore the impact of reasoning stages on end-to-end latency, optimal batching strategies for hybrid pipelines, and the architectural implications of remote KV cache retrieval. HERMES empowers system designers to navigate the evolving landscape of LLM inference, providing actionable insights into optimizing hardware-software co-design for next-generation AI workloads.

### Slice+Slice Baby: Generating Last-Level Cache Eviction Sets in the Blink   of an Eye
**Authors**: Bradley Morgan, Gal Horowitz, Sioli O'Connell, Stephan van Schaik, Chitchanok Chuengsatiansup, Daniel Genkin, Olaf Maennel, Paul Montague, Eyal Ronen, Yuval Yarom

**Updated**: 2025-04-20T07:53:09Z

**Summary**: An essential step for mounting cache attacks is finding eviction sets, collections of memory locations that contend on cache space. On Intel processors, one of the main challenges for identifying contending addresses is the sliced cache design, where the processor hashes the physical address to determine where in the cache a memory location is stored. While past works have demonstrated that the hash function can be reversed, they also showed that it depends on physical address bits that the adversary does not know.   In this work, we make three main contributions to the art of finding eviction sets. We first exploit microarchitectural races to compare memory access times and identify the cache slice to which an address maps. We then use the known hash function to both reduce the error rate in our slice identification method and to reduce the work by extrapolating slice mappings to untested memory addresses. Finally, we show how to propagate information on eviction sets across different page offsets for the hitherto unexplored case of non-linear hash functions.   Our contributions allow for entire LLC eviction set generation in 0.7 seconds on the Intel i7-9850H and 1.6 seconds on the i9-10900K, both using non-linear functions. This represents a significant improvement compared to state-of-the-art techniques taking 9x and 10x longer, respectively.

### Deuteronomy 2.0: Record Caching and Latch Freedom
**Authors**: David Lomet

**Updated**: 2025-04-20T00:49:27Z

**Summary**: The Deuteronomy transactional key-value store is unique architecturally in providing separation between transaction functionality -- its Transactional Component (TC) and data management -- its Data Component (DC). It is unique in technology by (1) supporting record caching, a smaller unit than the traditional page; and (2) protecting resources during concurrent execution using a latch-free approach. Both technologies are enabled by delta updating. This paper explains how record caching improves cache cost/performance. It also shows how a new latch-free approach makes implementation easier and improves performance.

### A fast MPI-based Distributed Hash-Table as Surrogate Model demonstrated   in a coupled reactive transport HPC simulation
**Authors**: Max Lübke, Marco De Lucia, Stefan Petri, Bettina Schnor

**Updated**: 2025-04-19T18:25:20Z

**Summary**: Surrogate models can play a pivotal role in enhancing performance in contemporary High-Performance Computing applications. Cache-based surrogates use already calculated simulation results to interpolate or extrapolate further simulation output values. But this approach only pays off if the access time to retrieve the needed values is much faster than the actual simulation. While the most existing key-value stores use a Client-Server architecture with dedicated storage nodes, this is not the most suitable architecture for HPC applications. Instead, we propose a distributed architecture where the parallel processes offer a part of their available memory to build a shared distributed hash table based on MPI. This paper presents three DHT approaches with the special requirements of HPC applications in mind. The presented lock-free design outperforms both DHT versions which use explicit synchronization by coarse-grained resp. fine-grained locking. The lock-free DHT shows very good scaling regarding read and write performance. The runtime of a coupled reactive transport simulation was improved between 14% and 42% using the lock-free DHT as a surrogate model.

### Room-temperature high-average-power strong-field terahertz source based   on industrial high-repetition-rate femtosecond laser
**Authors**: Deyin Kong, Yichen Su, Cheng Song, Xiaojun Wu

**Updated**: 2025-04-19T06:18:56Z

**Summary**: Free-space strong-field terahertz (THz) pulses, generated via optical rectification of femtosecond lasers in nonlinear crystals, are pivotal in various applications. However, conventional Ti:sapphire lasers struggle to produce high-average-power THz due to their limited output power. While kilowatt ytterbium lasers are increasingly adopted, their application in THz generation faces challenges: low optical-to-THz conversion efficiency (attributed to long pulse durations and low energy) and crystal damage under high pumping power. Here, we report a high-average-power strong-field THz source using a lithium niobate crystal pumped by a 1030-nm, 570-fs, 1-mJ, 50-kHz ytterbium femtosecond laser with tilted pulse front pumping (TPFP). By systematically optimizing TPFP implementations and comparing grating- and echelon-type configurations, we achieve a THz source with 64.5 mW average power at 42-W, 50-kHz pumping, and a focused peak electric field of 525 kV/cm at 0.83-mJ, 1-kHz operation. Additionally, we observe Zeeman torque signals in cobalt-iron ferromagnetic nanofilms. This high-repetition-rate, high-average-power THz system, combined with its potential capabilities in high signal-to-noise spectroscopy and imaging, promises transformative impacts in quantum matter manipulation, non-destructive testing, and biomedicine.

### Spineless Traversal for Layout Invalidation
**Authors**: Marisa Kirisame, Tiezhi Wang, Pavel Panchekha

**Updated**: 2025-04-19T05:57:44Z

**Summary**: Latency is a major concern for web rendering engines like those in Chrome, Safari, and Firefox. These engines reduce latency by using an incremental layout algorithm to redraw the page when the user interacts with it. In such an algorithm, elements that change frame-to-frame are marked dirty; only the dirty elements need be processed to draw the next frame, dramatically reducing latency. However, the standard incremental layout algorithm must search the page for dirty elements, accessing a number of auxiliary elements in the process. These auxiliary elements add cache misses and stalled cycles, and are responsible for a sizable fraction of all layout latency. We introduce a new, faster incremental layout algorithm called Spineless Traversal. Spineless Traversal uses a more computationally demanding priority queue algorithm to avoid the need to access auxiliary nodes and thus reduces cache traffic and stalls. This leads to dramatic speedups on the most latency-critical interactions such as hovering, typing, or animations. Moreover, thanks to numerous low-level optimizations, we are able to make Spineless Traversal competitive across the whole spectrum of incremental layout workloads. As a result, across 2216 benchmarks, Spineless Traversal is faster on 78.2% of the benchmark, with a mean speedup of 3.23x concentrated in the most latency-critical interactions such as hovering, typing, and animations.

### LogicTree: Structured Proof Exploration for Coherent and Rigorous   Logical Reasoning with Large Language Models
**Authors**: Kang He, Kaushik Roy

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T22:10:02Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable multi-step reasoning capabilities across various domains. However, LLMs still face distinct challenges in complex logical reasoning, as (1) proof-finding requires systematic exploration and the maintenance of logical coherence and (2) searching the right combination of premises at each reasoning step is inherently challenging in tasks with large premise space. To address this, we propose LogicTree, an inference-time modular framework employing algorithm-guided search to automate structured proof exploration and ensure logical coherence. Advancing beyond tree-of-thought (ToT), we incorporate caching mechanism into LogicTree to enable effective utilization of historical knowledge, preventing reasoning stagnation and minimizing redundancy. Furthermore, we address the combinatorial complexity of premise search by decomposing it into a linear process. The refined premise selection restricts subsequent inference to at most one derivation per step, enhancing reasoning granularity and enforcing strict step-by-step reasoning. Additionally, we introduce two LLM-free heuristics for premise prioritization, enabling strategic proof search. Experimental results on five datasets demonstrate that LogicTree optimally scales inference-time computation to achieve higher proof accuracy, surpassing chain-of-thought (CoT) and ToT with average gains of 23.6% and 12.5%, respectively, on GPT-4o. Moreover, within LogicTree, GPT-4o outperforms o3-mini by 7.6% on average.

### Gradual Binary Search and Dimension Expansion : A general method for   activation quantization in LLMs
**Authors**: Lucas Maisonnave, Cyril Moineau, Olivier Bichler, Fabrice Rastello

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T13:46:58Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have become pivotal in artificial intelligence, demonstrating strong capabilities in reasoning, understanding, and generating data. However, their deployment on edge devices is hindered by their substantial size, often reaching several billion parameters. Quantization is a widely used method to reduce memory usage and inference time, however LLMs present unique challenges due to the prevalence of outliers in their activations. In this work, we leverage the theoretical advantages of Hadamard matrices over random rotation matrices to push the boundaries of quantization in LLMs. We demonstrate that Hadamard matrices are more effective in reducing outliers, which are a significant obstacle in achieving low-bit quantization. Our method based on a gradual binary search enables 3-bit quantization for weights, activations, and key-value (KV) caches, resulting in a 40\% increase in accuracy on common benchmarks compared to SoTA methods. We extend the use of rotation matrices to support non-power-of-2 embedding dimensions, similar to the Qwen architecture, by employing the Paley algorithm. We theoretically demonstrates the superiority of Hadamard matrices in reducing outliers.We achieved 3-bit quantization for weights, activations, and KV cache, significantly enhancing model performance. Our experimental results on multiple models family like Mistral, LLaMA, and Qwen demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, outperforming existing methods and enabling practical 3-bit quantization.

### CacheFormer: High Attention-Based Segment Caching
**Authors**: Sushant Singh, Ausif Mahmood

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T06:34:57Z

**Summary**: Efficiently handling long contexts in transformer-based language models with low perplexity is an active area of research. Numerous recent approaches like Linformer, Longformer, Performer, and Structured state space models (SSMs)., have not fully resolved this problem. All these models strive to reduce the quadratic time complexity of the attention mechanism while minimizing the loss in quality due to the effective compression of the long context. Inspired by the cache and virtual memory principle in computers, where in case of a cache miss, not only the needed data is retrieved from the memory, but the adjacent data is also obtained, we apply this concept to handling long contexts by dividing it into small segments. In our design, we retrieve the nearby segments in an uncompressed form when high segment-level attention occurs at the compressed level. Our en-hancements for handling long context include aggregating four attention mechanisms consisting of short sliding window attention, long compressed segmented attention, dynamically retrieving top k high attention uncompressed segments, and overlapping segments in long segment attention to avoid segment fragmentation. These enhancements result in an architecture that outperforms ex-isting SOTA architectures with an average perplexity improvement of 8.5% over similar model sizes.

**Authors**: Amit Kumar Bhuyan, Hrishikesh Dutta, Subir Biswas

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T05:13:52Z

**Summary**: This paper introduces an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle - enabled content management architecture that is suitable for critical content access in communities of users that are communication-isolated during diverse types of disaster scenarios. The proposed architecture leverages a hybrid network of stationary anchor UAVs and mobile Micro-UAVs for ubiquitous content dissemination. The anchor UAVs are equipped with both vertical and lateral communication links, and they serve local users, while the mobile micro-ferrying UAVs extend coverage across communities with increased mobility. The focus is on developing a content dissemination system that dynamically learns optimal caching policies to maximize content availability. The core innovation is an adaptive content dissemination framework based on distributed Federated Multi-Armed Bandit learning. The goal is to optimize UAV content caching decisions based on geo-temporal content popularity and user demand variations. A Selective Caching Algorithm is also introduced to reduce redundant content replication by incorporating inter-UAV information sharing. This method strategically preserves the uniqueness in user preferences while amalgamating the intelligence across a distributed learning system. This approach improves the learning algorithm's ability to adapt to diverse user preferences. Functional verification and performance evaluation confirm the proposed architecture's utility across different network sizes, UAV swarms, and content popularity patterns.

**Authors**: Myunghyun Rhee, Joonseop Sim, Taeyoung Ahn, Seungyong Lee, Daegun Yoon, Euiseok Kim, Kyoung Park, Youngpyo Joo, Hosik Kim

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T03:31:08Z

**Summary**: The attention layer, a core component of Transformer-based LLMs, brings out inefficiencies in current GPU systems due to its low operational intensity and the substantial memory requirements of KV caches. We propose a High-bandwidth Processing Unit (HPU), a memoryintensive co-processor that enhances GPU resource utilization during large-batched LLM inference. By offloading memory-bound operations, the HPU allows the GPU to focus on compute-intensive tasks, increasing overall efficiency. Also, the HPU, as an add-on card, scales out to accommodate surging memory demands driven by large batch sizes and extended sequence lengths. In this paper, we show the HPU prototype implemented with PCIe-based FPGA cards mounted on a GPU system. Our novel GPU-HPU heterogeneous system demonstrates up to 4.1x performance gains and 4.6x energy efficiency improvements over a GPUonly system, providing scalability without increasing the number of GPUs.

### EXAM: Exploiting Exclusive System-Level Cache in Apple M-Series SoCs for   Enhanced Cache Occupancy Attacks
**Authors**: Tianhong Xu, Aidong Adam Ding, Yunsi Fei

**Updated**: 2025-04-18T00:21:00Z

**Summary**: Cache occupancy attacks exploit the shared nature of cache hierarchies to infer a victim's activities by monitoring overall cache usage, unlike access-driven cache attacks that focus on specific cache lines or sets. There exists some prior work that target the last-level cache (LLC) of Intel processors, which is inclusive of higher-level caches, and L2 caches of ARM systems. In this paper, we target the System-Level Cache (SLC) of Apple M-series SoCs, which is exclusive to higher-level CPU caches. We address the challenges of the exclusiveness and propose a suite of SLC-cache occupancy attacks, the first of its kind, where an adversary can monitor GPU and other CPU cluster activities from their own CPU cluster. We first discover the structure of SLC in Apple M1 SOC and various policies pertaining to access and sharing through reverse engineering. We propose two attacks against websites. One is a coarse-grained fingerprinting attack, recognizing which website is accessed based on their different GPU memory access patterns monitored through the SLC occupancy channel. The other attack is a fine-grained pixel stealing attack, which precisely monitors the GPU memory usage for rendering different pixels, through the SLC occupancy channel. Third, we introduce a novel screen capturing attack which works beyond webpages, with the monitoring granularity of 57 rows of pixels (there are 1600 rows for the screen). This significantly expands the attack surface, allowing the adversary to retrieve any screen display, posing a substantial new threat to system security. Our findings reveal critical vulnerabilities in Apple's M-series SoCs and emphasize the urgent need for effective countermeasures against cache occupancy attacks in heterogeneous computing environments.

**Authors**: Seungheon Shin, Kyle Liddy, Yinxuan Zhu, Chandan Joishi, Brianna A. Klein, Andrew Armstrong, Andrew A. Allerman, Siddharth Rajan

**Updated**: 2025-04-17T23:45:51Z

**Summary**: We report on energy bands and breakdown characteristics of Al2O3 dielectrics on ultra-wide bandgap (UWBG) AlGaN heterostructures. Metal-dielectric-semiconductor structures are important to sustain high fields needed for future high-performance UWBG transistors. Using systematic experiments, we determined the fixed charge density (> 1013 cm-2), the dielectric/interface, and electric fields in the oxide of under flat-band conditions in the semiconductor. Low gate-to-drain leakage current of up to 5 x 10-7 A/cm2 were obtained in the metal-oxide-semiconductor structures. In lateral metal-semiconductor-insulator test structures, breakdown voltage exceeding 1 kV was obtained with a channel sheet charge density of 1.27 x 1013 cm-2. The effective peak electric field and average breakdown field were estimated to be > 4.27 MV/cm and 1.99 MV/cm, respectively. These findings demonstrate the potential of Al2O2 integration for enhancing the breakdown performance of UWBG AlGaN HEMTs.

### Long-Context Autoregressive Video Modeling with Next-Frame Prediction
**Authors**: Yuchao Gu, Weijia Mao, Mike Zheng Shou

**Updated**: 2025-04-17T15:26:04Z

**Summary**: Long-context autoregressive modeling has significantly advanced language generation, but video generation still struggles to fully utilize extended temporal contexts. To investigate long-context video modeling, we introduce Frame AutoRegressive (FAR), a strong baseline for video autoregressive modeling. Just as language models learn causal dependencies between tokens (i.e., Token AR), FAR models temporal causal dependencies between continuous frames, achieving better convergence than Token AR and video diffusion transformers. Building on FAR, we observe that long-context video modeling faces challenges due to visual redundancy. Training on long videos is computationally expensive, as vision tokens grow much faster than language tokens. To tackle this issue, we propose balancing locality and long-range dependency through long short-term context modeling. A high-resolution short-term context window ensures fine-grained temporal consistency, while an unlimited long-term context window encodes long-range information using fewer tokens. With this approach, we can train on long video sequences with a manageable token context length, thereby significantly reducing training time and memory usage. Furthermore, we propose a multi-level KV cache designed to support the long short-term context modeling, which accelerating inference on long video sequences. We demonstrate that FAR achieves state-of-the-art performance in both short- and long-video generation, providing a simple yet effective baseline for video autoregressive modeling. The code is released at https://github.com/showlab/FAR.

### In-context KV-Cache Eviction for LLMs via Attention-Gate
**Authors**: Zihao Zeng, Bokai Lin, Tianqi Hou, Hao Zhang, Zhijie Deng

**Updated**: 2025-04-17T03:51:06Z

**Summary**: The KV-Cache technique has become the standard for the inference of large language models (LLMs). Yet, it is widely criticized that KV-Cache can become a bottleneck of the LLM inference system. This paper enables a novel dynamic KV-Cache eviction policy by injecting a lightweight module called Attention-Gate to the model. It accepts the global context as input and yields eviction flags for each token. The self-attention modules in the model proceed according to the flags and cache only a subset of the KV states for next token prediction. The Attention-Gates can yield various flags for different heads and layers and be easily tuned on top of a pre-trained LLM via continual pre-training or supervised fine-tuning. The computational and memory overhead introduced by Attention-Gates can be minimal. We empirically evaluate the proposed approach across multiple scenarios, showing that effective eviction of redundant tokens can not only improve efficiency but also enhance performance.

### Demoting Security via Exploitation of Cache Demote Operation in Intel's   Latest ISA Extension
**Authors**: Taehun Kim, Hyerean Jang, Youngjoo Shin

**Updated**: 2025-04-17T00:38:24Z

**Summary**: ISA extensions are increasingly adopted to boost the performance of specialized workloads without requiring an entire architectural redesign. However, these enhancements can inadvertently expose new attack surfaces in the microarchitecture. In this paper, we investigate Intel's recently introduced cldemote extension, which promotes efficient data sharing by transferring cache lines from upper-level caches to the Last Level Cache (LLC). Despite its performance benefits, we uncover critical properties-unprivileged access, inter-cache state transition, and fault suppression-that render cldemote exploitable for microarchitectural attacks. We propose two new attack primitives, Flush+Demote and Demote+Time, built on our analysis. Flush+Demote constructs a covert channel with a bandwidth of 2.84 Mbps and a bit error rate of 0.018%, while Demote+Time derandomizes the kernel base address in 2.49 ms on Linux. Furthermore, we show that leveraging cldemote accelerates eviction set construction in non-inclusive LLC designs by obviating the need for helper threads or extensive cache conflicts, thereby reducing construction time by 36% yet retaining comparable success rates. Finally, we examine how ISA extensions contribute to broader microarchitectural attacks, identifying five key exploitable characteristics and categorizing four distinct attack types. We also discuss potential countermeasures, highlighting the far-reaching security implications of emerging ISA extensions.

### MOM: Memory-Efficient Offloaded Mini-Sequence Inference for Long Context   Language Models
**Authors**: Junyang Zhang, Tianyi Zhu, Cheng Luo, Anima Anandkumar

**Updated**: 2025-04-16T23:15:09Z

**Summary**: Long-context language models exhibit impressive performance but remain challenging to deploy due to high GPU memory demands during inference. We propose Memory-efficient Offloaded Mini-sequence Inference (MOM), a method that partitions critical layers into smaller "mini-sequences" and integrates seamlessly with KV cache offloading. Experiments on various Llama, Qwen, and Mistral models demonstrate that MOM reduces peak memory usage by over 50\% on average. On Meta-Llama-3.2-8B, MOM extends the maximum context length from 155k to 455k tokens on a single A100 80GB GPU, while keeping outputs identical and not compromising accuracy. MOM also maintains highly competitive throughput due to minimal computational overhead and efficient last-layer processing. Compared to traditional chunked prefill methods, MOM achieves a 35\% greater context length extension. More importantly, our method drastically reduces prefill memory consumption, eliminating it as the longstanding dominant memory bottleneck during inference. This breakthrough fundamentally changes research priorities, redirecting future efforts from prefill-stage optimizations to improving decode-stage residual KV cache efficiency.

### Cobra: Efficient Line Art COlorization with BRoAder References
**Authors**: Junhao Zhuang, Lingen Li, Xuan Ju, Zhaoyang Zhang, Chun Yuan, Ying Shan

**Updated**: 2025-05-03T06:55:56Z

**Summary**: The comic production industry requires reference-based line art colorization with high accuracy, efficiency, contextual consistency, and flexible control. A comic page often involves diverse characters, objects, and backgrounds, which complicates the coloring process. Despite advancements in diffusion models for image generation, their application in line art colorization remains limited, facing challenges related to handling extensive reference images, time-consuming inference, and flexible control. We investigate the necessity of extensive contextual image guidance on the quality of line art colorization. To address these challenges, we introduce Cobra, an efficient and versatile method that supports color hints and utilizes over 200 reference images while maintaining low latency. Central to Cobra is a Causal Sparse DiT architecture, which leverages specially designed positional encodings, causal sparse attention, and Key-Value Cache to effectively manage long-context references and ensure color identity consistency. Results demonstrate that Cobra achieves accurate line art colorization through extensive contextual reference, significantly enhancing inference speed and interactivity, thereby meeting critical industrial demands. We release our codes and models on our project page: https://zhuang2002.github.io/Cobra/.

**Authors**: Kihyun Kim, Jinwoo Kim, Hyunsun Chung, Myung-Hoon Cha, Hong-Yeon Kim, Youngjae Kim

**Updated**: 2025-04-16T07:02:38Z

**Summary**: LLM inference is essential for applications like text summarization, translation, and data analysis, but the high cost of GPU instances from Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) like AWS is a major burden. This paper proposes InferSave, a cost-efficient VM selection framework for cloud based LLM inference. InferSave optimizes KV cache offloading based on Service Level Objectives (SLOs) and workload charac teristics, estimating GPU memory needs, and recommending cost-effective VM instances. Additionally, the Compute Time Calibration Function (CTCF) improves instance selection accuracy by adjusting for discrepancies between theoretical and actual GPU performance. Experiments on AWS GPU instances show that selecting lower-cost instances without KV cache offloading improves cost efficiency by up to 73.7% for online workloads, while KV cache offloading saves up to 20.19% for offline workloads.

### Efficient Architecture for RISC-V Vector Memory Access
**Authors**: Hongyi Guan, Yichuan Gao, Chenlu Miao, Haoyang Wu, Hang Zhu, Mingfeng Lin, Huayue Liang

**Updated**: 2025-04-16T05:57:08Z

**Summary**: Vector processors frequently suffer from inefficient memory accesses, particularly for strided and segment patterns. While coalescing strided accesses is a natural solution, effectively gathering or scattering elements at fixed strides remains challenging. Naive approaches rely on high-overhead crossbars that remap any byte between memory and registers, leading to physical design issues. Segment operations require row-column transpositions, typically handled using either element-level in-place transposition (degrading performance) or large buffer-based bulk transposition (incurring high area overhead). In this paper, we present EARTH, a novel vector memory access architecture designed to overcome these challenges through shifting-based optimizations. For strided accesses, EARTH integrates specialized shift networks for gathering and scattering elements. After coalescing multiple accesses within the same cache line, data is routed between memory and registers through the shifting network with minimal overhead. For segment operations, EARTH employs a shifted register bank enabling direct column-wise access, eliminating dedicated segment buffers while providing high-performance, in-place bulk transposition. Implemented on FPGA with Chisel HDL based on an open-source RISC-V vector unit, EARTH enhances performance for strided memory accesses, achieving 4x-8x speedups in benchmarks dominated by strided operations. Compared to conventional designs, EARTH reduces hardware area by 9% and power consumption by 41%, significantly advancing both performance and efficiency of vector processors.

### Shared Disk KV Cache Management for Efficient Multi-Instance Inference   in RAG-Powered LLMs
**Authors**: Hyungwoo Lee, Kihyun Kim, Jinwoo Kim, Jungmin So, Myung-Hoon Cha, Hong-Yeon Kim, James J. Kim, Youngjae Kim

**Updated**: 2025-04-16T04:59:18Z

**Summary**: Recent large language models (LLMs) face increasing inference latency as input context length and model size continue to grow. In particular, the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) technique, which enhances LLM responses by incorporating external knowledge, exacerbates this issue by significantly increasing the number of input tokens. This expansion in token length leads to a substantial rise in computational overhead, particularly during the prefill stage, resulting in prolonged time-to-first-token (TTFT). To address this issue, this paper proposes a method to reduce TTFT by leveraging a disk-based key-value (KV) cache to lessen the computational burden during the prefill stage. We also introduce a disk-based shared KV cache management system, called Shared RAG-DCache, for multi-instance LLM RAG service environments. This system, together with an optimal system configuration, improves both throughput and latency under given resource constraints. Shared RAG-DCache exploits the locality of documents related to user queries in RAG, as well as the queueing delay in LLM inference services. It proactively generates and stores disk KV caches for query-related documents and shares them across multiple LLM instances to enhance inference performance. In experiments on a single host equipped with 2 GPUs and 1 CPU, Shared RAG-DCache achieved a 15~71% increase in throughput and up to a 12~65% reduction in latency, depending on the resource configuration.

### EdgePrompt: A Distributed Key-Value Inference Framework for LLMs in 6G   Networks
**Authors**: Jiahong Ning, Pengyan Zhu, Ce Zheng, Gary Lee, Sumei Sun, Tingting Yang

**Updated**: 2025-04-16T03:07:07Z

**Summary**: As sixth-generation (6G) networks advance, large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into 6G infrastructure to enhance network management and intelligence. However, traditional LLMs architecture struggle to meet the stringent latency and security requirements of 6G, especially as the increasing in sequence length leads to greater task complexity. This paper proposes Edge-Prompt, a cloud-edge collaborative framework based on a hierarchical attention splicing mechanism. EdgePrompt employs distributed key-value (KV) pair optimization techniques to accelerate inference and adapt to network conditions. Additionally, to reduce the risk of data leakage, EdgePrompt incorporates a privacy preserving strategy by isolating sensitive information during processing. Experiments on public dataset show that EdgePrompt effectively improves the inference throughput and reduces the latency, which provides a reliable solution for LLMs deployment in 6G environments.

### Engineering MultiQueues: Fast Relaxed Concurrent Priority Queues
**Authors**: Marvin Williams, Peter Sanders

**Updated**: 2025-04-15T22:38:54Z

**Summary**: Priority queues are used in a wide range of applications, including prioritized online scheduling, discrete event simulation, and greedy algorithms. In parallel settings, classical priority queues often become a severe bottleneck, resulting in low throughput. Consequently, there has been significant interest in concurrent priority queues with relaxed semantics. In this article, we present the MultiQueue, a flexible approach to relaxed priority queues that uses multiple internal sequential priority queues. The scalability of the MultiQueue is enhanced by buffering elements, batching operations on the internal queues, and optimizing access patterns for high cache locality. We investigate the complementary quality criteria of rank error, which measures how close deleted elements are to the global minimum, and delay, which quantifies how many smaller elements were deleted before a given element. Extensive experimental evaluation shows that the MultiQueue outperforms competing approaches across several benchmarks. This includes shortest-path and branch-and-bound benchmarks that resemble real applications. Moreover, the MultiQueue can be configured easily to balance throughput and quality according to the application's requirements. We employ a seemingly paradoxical technique of wait-free locking that might be of broader interest for converting sequential data structures into relaxed concurrent data structures.

### Optimizing LLM Inference: Fluid-Guided Online Scheduling with Memory   Constraints
**Authors**: Ruicheng Ao, Gan Luo, David Simchi-Levi, Xinshang Wang

**Updated**: 2025-04-15T16:00:21Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are indispensable in today's applications, but their inference procedure -- generating responses by processing text in segments and using a memory-heavy Key-Value (KV) cache -- demands significant computational resources, particularly under memory constraints. This paper formulates LLM inference optimization as a multi-stage online scheduling problem where sequential prompt arrivals and KV cache growth render conventional scheduling ineffective. We develop a fluid dynamics approximation to provide a tractable benchmark that guides algorithm design. Building on this, we propose the Waiting for Accumulated Inference Threshold (WAIT) algorithm, which uses multiple thresholds to schedule incoming prompts optimally when output lengths are known, and extend it to Nested WAIT for cases with unknown output lengths. Theoretical analysis shows that both algorithms achieve near-optimal performance against the fluid benchmark in heavy traffic conditions, balancing throughput, latency, and Time to First Token (TTFT). Experiments with the Llama-7B model on an A100 GPU using both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate improved throughput and reduced latency relative to established baselines like vLLM and Sarathi. This work bridges operations research and machine learning, offering a rigorous framework for the efficient deployment of LLMs under memory constraints.

### Performant Automatic BLAS Offloading on Unified Memory Architecture with   OpenMP First-Touch Style Data Movement
**Authors**: Junjie Li

**Updated**: 2025-04-15T15:40:25Z

**Summary**: BLAS is a fundamental building block of advanced linear algebra libraries and many modern scientific computing applications. GPUs are known for their strong arithmetic computing capabilities and are highly suited for BLAS operations. However, porting code to GPUs often requires significant effort, especially for large, complex codes or legacy codes, even for BLAS-heavy applications. While various tools exist to automatically offload BLAS to GPUs, they are often impractical due to the high costs associated with mandatory data transfers. The advent of unified memory architectures in recent GPU designs, such as the NVIDIA Grace-Hopper, allows cache-coherent memory access across all types of memory for both CPU and GPU, potentially eliminating the bottlenecks faced in conventional architectures. This breakthrough paves the way for innovative application developments and porting strategies. Building on our preliminary work demonstrating the potential of automatic *gemm offload, this paper extends the framework to all level-3 BLAS operations and introduces SCILIB-Accel, a novel tool for automatic BLAS offload. SCILIB-Accel leverages the memory coherency in Grace-Hopper and introduces a Device First-Use data movement policy inspired by the OpenMP First-Touch approach in multi-socket CPU programming, minimizing CPU-GPU data transfers for typical scientific computing codes. Additionally, utilizing dynamic binary instrumentation, the tool intercepts BLAS symbols directly from a CPU binary, requiring no code modifications or recompilation. SCILIB-Accel has been evaluated using multiple quantum physics codes on up to a few hundred GPU nodes, yielding promising speedups. Notably, for the LSMS method in the MuST suite, a 3x speedup was achieved on Grace-Hopper compared to Grace-Grace.

The new unified memory architecture in NVIDIA Grace-Hopper allows high bandwidth cache-coherent memory access of all memory from both CPU and GPU, potentially eliminating bottleneck faced in conventional architecture. This breakthrough opens up new avenues for application development and porting strategies. In this study, we introduce a new tool for automatic BLAS offload, the tool leverages the high speed cache coherent NVLink C2C interconnect in Grace-Hopper, and enables performant GPU offload for BLAS heavy applications with no code changes or recompilation. The tool was tested on two quantum chemistry or physics codes, great performance benefits were observed.

### Morphing-based Compression for Data-centric ML Pipelines
**Authors**: Sebastian Baunsgaard, Matthias Boehm

**Updated**: 2025-04-15T11:02:34Z

**Summary**: Data-centric ML pipelines extend traditional machine learning (ML) pipelines -- of feature transformations and ML model training -- by outer loops for data cleaning, augmentation, and feature engineering to create high-quality input data. Existing lossless matrix compression applies lightweight compression schemes to numeric matrices and performs linear algebra operations such as matrix-vector multiplications directly on the compressed representation but struggles to efficiently rediscover structural data redundancy. Compressed operations are effective at fitting data in available memory, reducing I/O across the storage-memory-cache hierarchy, and improving instruction parallelism. The applied data cleaning, augmentation, and feature transformations provide a rich source of information about data characteristics such as distinct items, column sparsity, and column correlations. In this paper, we introduce BWARE -- an extension of AWARE for workload-aware lossless matrix compression -- that pushes compression through feature transformations and engineering to leverage information about structural transformations. Besides compressed feature transformations, we introduce a novel technique for lightweight morphing of a compressed representation into workload-optimized compressed representations without decompression. BWARE shows substantial end-to-end runtime improvements, reducing the execution time for training data-centric ML pipelines from days to hours.

**Updated**: 2025-04-14T15:34:26Z

**Summary**: AlayaDB is a cutting-edge vector database system natively architected for efficient and effective long-context inference for Large Language Models (LLMs) at AlayaDB AI. Specifically, it decouples the KV cache and attention computation from the LLM inference systems, and encapsulates them into a novel vector database system. For the Model as a Service providers (MaaS), AlayaDB consumes fewer hardware resources and offers higher generation quality for various workloads with different kinds of Service Level Objectives (SLOs), when comparing with the existing alternative solutions (e.g., KV cache disaggregation, retrieval-based sparse attention). The crux of AlayaDB is that it abstracts the attention computation and cache management for LLM inference into a query processing procedure, and optimizes the performance via a native query optimizer. In this work, we demonstrate the effectiveness of AlayaDB via (i) three use cases from our industry partners, and (ii) extensive experimental results on LLM inference benchmarks.

### Shield Bash: Abusing Defensive Coherence State Retrieval to Break Timing   Obfuscation
**Authors**: Kartik Ramkrishnan, Antonia Zhai, Stephen McCamant, Pen Chung Yew

**Updated**: 2025-04-14T15:27:32Z

**Summary**: Microarchitectural attacks are a significant concern, leading to many hardware-based defense proposals. However, different defenses target different classes of attacks, and their impact on each other has not been fully considered. To raise awareness of this problem, we study an interaction between two state-of-the art defenses in this paper, timing obfuscations of remote cache lines (TORC) and delaying speculative changes to remote cache lines (DSRC). TORC mitigates cache-hit based attacks and DSRC mitigates speculative coherence state change attacks.   We observe that DSRC enables coherence information to be retrieved into the processor core, where it is out of the reach of timing obfuscations to protect. This creates an unforeseen consequence that redo operations can be triggered within the core to detect the presence or absence of remote cache lines, which constitutes a security vulnerability. We demonstrate that a new covert channel attack is possible using this vulnerability. We propose two ways to mitigate the attack, whose performance varies depending on an application's cache usage. One way is to never send remote exclusive coherence state (E) information to the core even if it is created. The other way is to never create a remote E state, which is responsible for triggering redos.   We demonstrate the timing difference caused by this microarchitectural defense assumption violation using GEM5 simulations. Performance evaluation on SPECrate 2017 and PARSEC benchmarks of the two fixes show less than 32\% average overhead across both sets of benchmarks. The repair which prevented the creation of remote E state had less than 2.8% average overhead.

### A New Paradigm in IBR Modeling for Power Flow and Short Circuit Analysis
**Authors**: Zahid Javid, Firdous Ul Nazir, Wentao Zhu, Diptargha Chakravorty, Ahmed Aboushady, Mohamed Galeela

**Updated**: 2025-04-14T12:34:20Z

**Summary**: The fault characteristics of inverter-based resources (IBRs) are different from conventional synchronous generators. The fault response of IBRs is non-linear due to saturation states and mainly determined by fault ride through (FRT) strategies of the associated voltage source converter (VSC). This results in prohibitively large solution times for power flows considering these short circuit characteristics, especially when the power system states change fast due to uncertainty in IBR generations. To overcome this, a phasor-domain steady state (SS) short circuit (SC) solver for IBR dominated power systems is proposed in this paper, and subsequently the developed IBR models are incorporated with a novel Jacobian-based Power Flow (PF) solver. In this multiphase PF solver, any power system components can be modeled by considering their original non-linear or linear mathematical representations. Moreover, two novel FRT strategies are proposed to fully utilize the converter capacity and to comply with IEEE-2800 2022 std and German grid code. The results are compared with the Electromagnetic Transient (EMT) simulation on the IEEE 34 test network and the 120 kV EPRI benchmark system. The developed IBR sequence domain PF model demonstrates more accurate behavior compared to the classical IBR generator model. The error in calculating the short circuit current with the proposed SC solver is less than 3%, while achieving significant speed improvements of three order of magnitudes.

 ### A False Sense of Privacy: Evaluating Textual Data Sanitization Beyond   Surface-level Privacy Leakage
**Authors**: Rui Xin, Niloofar Mireshghallah, Shuyue Stella Li, Michael Duan, Hyunwoo Kim, Yejin Choi, Yulia Tsvetkov, Sewoong Oh, Pang Wei Koh

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T17:57:04Z

**Summary**: Sanitizing sensitive text data typically involves removing personally identifiable information (PII) or generating synthetic data under the assumption that these methods adequately protect privacy; however, their effectiveness is often only assessed by measuring the leakage of explicit identifiers but ignoring nuanced textual markers that can lead to re-identification. We challenge the above illusion of privacy by proposing a new framework that evaluates re-identification attacks to quantify individual privacy risks upon data release. Our approach shows that seemingly innocuous auxiliary information -- such as routine social activities -- can be used to infer sensitive attributes like age or substance use history from sanitized data. For instance, we demonstrate that Azure's commercial PII removal tool fails to protect 74\% of information in the MedQA dataset. Although differential privacy mitigates these risks to some extent, it significantly reduces the utility of the sanitized text for downstream tasks. Our findings indicate that current sanitization techniques offer a \textit{false sense of privacy}, highlighting the need for more robust methods that protect against semantic-level information leakage.

### RoboPEPP: Vision-Based Robot Pose and Joint Angle Estimation through   Embedding Predictive Pre-Training
**Authors**: Raktim Gautam Goswami, Prashanth Krishnamurthy, Yann LeCun, Farshad Khorrami

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T17:36:47Z

**Summary**: Vision-based pose estimation of articulated robots with unknown joint angles has applications in collaborative robotics and human-robot interaction tasks. Current frameworks use neural network encoders to extract image features and downstream layers to predict joint angles and robot pose. While images of robots inherently contain rich information about the robot's physical structures, existing methods often fail to leverage it fully; therefore, limiting performance under occlusions and truncations. To address this, we introduce RoboPEPP, a method that fuses information about the robot's physical model into the encoder using a masking-based self-supervised embedding-predictive architecture. Specifically, we mask the robot's joints and pre-train an encoder-predictor model to infer the joints' embeddings from surrounding unmasked regions, enhancing the encoder's understanding of the robot's physical model. The pre-trained encoder-predictor pair, along with joint angle and keypoint prediction networks, is then fine-tuned for pose and joint angle estimation. Random masking of input during fine-tuning and keypoint filtering during evaluation further improves robustness. Our method, evaluated on several datasets, achieves the best results in robot pose and joint angle estimation while being the least sensitive to occlusions and requiring the lowest execution time.

### VIDSTAMP: A Temporally-Aware Watermark for Ownership and Integrity in   Video Diffusion Models
**Authors**: Mohammadreza Teymoorianfard, Shiqing Ma, Amir Houmansadr

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T17:35:03Z

**Summary**: The rapid rise of video diffusion models has enabled the generation of highly realistic and temporally coherent videos, raising critical concerns about content authenticity, provenance, and misuse. Existing watermarking approaches, whether passive, post-hoc, or adapted from image-based techniques, often struggle to withstand video-specific manipulations such as frame insertion, dropping, or reordering, and typically degrade visual quality. In this work, we introduce VIDSTAMP, a watermarking framework that embeds per-frame or per-segment messages directly into the latent space of temporally-aware video diffusion models. By fine-tuning the model's decoder through a two-stage pipeline, first on static image datasets to promote spatial message separation, and then on synthesized video sequences to restore temporal consistency, VIDSTAMP learns to embed high-capacity, flexible watermarks with minimal perceptual impact. Leveraging architectural components such as 3D convolutions and temporal attention, our method imposes no additional inference cost and offers better perceptual quality than prior methods, while maintaining comparable robustness against common distortions and tampering. VIDSTAMP embeds 768 bits per video (48 bits per frame) with a bit accuracy of 95.0%, achieves a log P-value of -166.65 (lower is better), and maintains a video quality score of 0.836, comparable to unwatermarked outputs (0.838) and surpassing prior methods in capacity-quality tradeoffs.

### Inferring resource competition in microbial communities from time series
**Authors**: Xiaowen Chen, Kyle Crocker, Seppe Kuehn, Aleksandra M. Walczak, Thierry Mora

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T17:00:10Z

**Summary**: The competition for resources is a defining feature of microbial communities. In many contexts, from soils to host-associated communities, highly diverse microbes are organized into metabolic groups or guilds with similar resource preferences. The resource preferences of individual taxa that give rise to these guilds are critical for understanding fluxes of resources through the community and the structure of diversity in the system. However, inferring the metabolic capabilities of individual taxa, and their competition with other taxa, within a community is challenging and unresolved. Here we address this gap in knowledge by leveraging dynamic measurements of abundances in communities. We show that simple correlations are often misleading in predicting resource competition. We show that spectral methods such as the cross-power spectral density (CPSD) and coherence that account for time-delayed effects are superior metrics for inferring the structure of resource competition in communities. We first demonstrate this fact on synthetic data generated from consumer-resource models with time-dependent resource availability, where taxa are organized into groups or guilds with similar resource preferences. By applying spectral methods to oceanic plankton time-series data, we demonstrate that these methods detect interaction structures among species with similar genomic sequences. Our results indicate that analyzing temporal data across multiple timescales can reveal the underlying structure of resource competition within communities.

### An Efficient Matrix Multiplication Algorithm for Accelerating Inference   in Binary and Ternary Neural Networks
**Authors**: Mohsen Dehghankar, Mahdi Erfanian, Abolfazl Asudeh

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T16:58:10Z

**Summary**: Despite their tremendous success and versatility, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) such as Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from inference inefficiency and rely on advanced computational infrastructure. To address these challenges and make these models more accessible and cost-effective, in this paper, we propose algorithms to improve the inference time and memory efficiency of DNNs with binary and ternary weight matrices. Particularly focusing on matrix multiplication as the bottleneck operation of inference, we observe that, once trained, the weight matrices of a model no longer change. This allows us to preprocess these matrices and create indices that help reduce the storage requirements by a logarithmic factor while enabling our efficient inference algorithms. Specifically, for a $n\times n$ weight matrix, our efficient algorithm guarantees a time complexity of $O(\frac{n^2}{\log n})$, a logarithmic factor improvement over the standard vector-matrix multiplication. Besides theoretical analysis, we conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the practical efficiency of our algorithms. Our results confirm the superiority of our approach both with respect to time and memory, as we observed a reduction in the multiplication time up to 29x and memory usage up to 6x. When applied to LLMs, our experiments show up to a 5.24x speedup in the inference time.

### Carbon Aware Transformers Through Joint Model-Hardware Optimization
**Authors**: Irene Wang, Newsha Ardalani, Mostafa Elhoushi, Daniel Jiang, Samuel Hsia, Ekin Sumbul, Divya Mahajan, Carole-Jean Wu, Bilge Acun

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T16:49:10Z

**Summary**: The rapid growth of machine learning (ML) systems necessitates a more comprehensive evaluation of their environmental impact, particularly their carbon footprint, which comprises operational carbon from training and inference execution and embodied carbon from hardware manufacturing and its entire life-cycle. Despite the increasing importance of embodied emissions, there is a lack of tools and frameworks to holistically quantify and optimize the total carbon footprint of ML systems. To address this, we propose CATransformers, a carbon-aware architecture search framework that enables sustainability-driven co-optimization of ML models and hardware architectures. By incorporating both operational and embodied carbon metrics into early design space exploration of domain-specific hardware accelerators, CATransformers demonstrates that optimizing for carbon yields design choices distinct from those optimized solely for latency or energy efficiency. We apply our framework to multi-modal CLIP-based models, producing CarbonCLIP, a family of CLIP models achieving up to 17% reduction in total carbon emissions while maintaining accuracy and latency compared to state-of-the-art edge small CLIP baselines. This work underscores the need for holistic optimization methods to design high-performance, environmentally sustainable AI systems.

### FalconWing: An Open-Source Platform for Ultra-Light Fixed-Wing Aircraft   Research
**Authors**: Yan Miao, Will Shen, Hang Cui, Sayan Mitra

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T16:47:05Z

**Summary**: We present FalconWing -- an open-source, ultra-lightweight (150 g) fixed-wing platform for autonomy research. The hardware platform integrates a small camera, a standard airframe, offboard computation, and radio communication for manual overrides. We demonstrate FalconWing's capabilities by developing and deploying a purely vision-based control policy for autonomous landing (without IMU or motion capture) using a novel real-to-sim-to-real learning approach. Our learning approach: (1) constructs a photorealistic simulation environment via 3D Gaussian splatting trained on real-world images; (2) identifies nonlinear dynamics from vision-estimated real-flight data; and (3) trains a multi-modal Vision Transformer (ViT) policy through simulation-only imitation learning. The ViT architecture fuses single RGB image with the history of control actions via self-attention, preserving temporal context while maintaining real-time 20 Hz inference. When deployed zero-shot on the hardware platform, this policy achieves an 80% success rate in vision-based autonomous landings. Together with the hardware specifications, we also open-source the system dynamics, the software for photorealistic simulator and the learning approach.

### Self-Generated In-Context Examples Improve LLM Agents for Sequential   Decision-Making Tasks
**Authors**: Vishnu Sarukkai, Zhiqiang Xie, Kayvon Fatahalian

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T16:44:02Z

**Summary**: Many methods for improving Large Language Model (LLM) agents for sequential decision-making tasks depend on task-specific knowledge engineering--such as prompt tuning, curated in-context examples, or customized observation and action spaces. Using these approaches, agent performance improves with the quality or amount of knowledge engineering invested. Instead, we investigate how LLM agents can automatically improve their performance by learning in-context from their own successful experiences on similar tasks. Rather than relying on task-specific knowledge engineering, we focus on constructing and refining a database of self-generated examples. We demonstrate that even a naive accumulation of successful trajectories across training tasks boosts test performance on three benchmarks: ALFWorld (73% to 89%), Wordcraft (55% to 64%), and InterCode-SQL (75% to 79%)--matching the performance the initial agent achieves if allowed two to three attempts per task. We then introduce two extensions: (1) database-level selection through population-based training to identify high-performing example collections, and (2) exemplar-level selection that retains individual trajectories based on their empirical utility as in-context examples. These extensions further enhance performance, achieving 91% on ALFWorld--matching more complex approaches that employ task-specific components and prompts. Our results demonstrate that automatic trajectory database construction offers a compelling alternative to labor-intensive knowledge engineering.

### Probing the Cores of Subdwarf B Stars: How do They Compare to Cores in   Helium Core-Burning Red Giants?
**Authors**: Margarida S. Cunha, Juliana Amaral, Sofia Avelino, Anselmo Falorca, Yuri Damasceno, Pedro Avelino

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T16:43:37Z

**Summary**: The mixing of material from stellar convective cores into their adjacent radiative layers has been a matter of long-standing debate. Pulsating subdwarf B stars offer excellent conditions to advance our understanding of this problem. In this work we use a model-independent approach to infer information about the cores of three subdwarf B stars and compare it with similar inferences from earlier analysis of red giants in the helium core-burning phase. This is achieved by fitting an analytical description of the gravity-mode pulsation periods to pulsation data collected by the Kepler satellite. From the fits we infer the reduced asymptotic period spacings and the amplitude and position of sharp structural variations associated with chemical discontinuities in the stellar interiors. Our results indicate the presence of sharp structural variations with similar properties in all three stars, located near the edge of the gravity-mode propagation cavity and likely associated with the C-O/He transition. We find that these structural variations differ systematically from those of helium core-burning red giant stars, having larger amplitudes and being located at a larger buoyancy radius. This suggests that chemical mixing beyond the adiabatically stratified core into the radiatively stratified layers may be more extensive in subdwarf B stars than in helium core-burning red giants. Alternatively, the stratification of the mixing region beyond the adiabatically stratified core may differ significantly between the two types of stars. The model-independent constraints set on the structural variations inside these three stars are the first of a kind and will be key to enhance the modelling of layers adjacent to stellar convective cores and to test non-canonical stellar evolution channels leading to the formation of hot subdwarf stars.

### A rigorous data-driven approach to the nucleation of defects in metals   exploiting the link between kinetic properties and (dis)order parameters
**Authors**: Mattia Perrone, David D. Girardier, Giovanni M. Pavan, Fabio Pietrucci

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T16:29:14Z

**Summary**: Nucleation processes, through which a new structure progressively forms within a pre-existing homogeneous phase, are fundamental in materials science, but are also typically non-trivial to elucidate. Cases in which to nucleate are defects (or disorder) in an initially ordered structure make no exception. A prominent example is the nucleation of dislocations in metals, which critically govern their mechanical, electronic, thermal, and chemical properties. While atomic-level insights can be attained using, \textit{e.g.}, molecular dynamics simulations, systematically characterizing nucleation mechanisms and accurately quantifying kinetic rates remain challenging tasks. In this work, we demonstrate how the choice of the order parameter used to track the transition has a very strong effect on the accuracy of the kinetic rate predicted from the corresponding free-energy barrier and diffusion coefficient, a fact that has been often overlooked in the past. By exploiting this systematic error to our advantage, we demonstrate that it is possible to rigorously characterize the nucleation process using a data-driven scheme based on a variational principle, leading to optimal order parameters and a faithful mechanistic description. We apply this method to characterize, as a representative case study, the nucleation of dislocations in crystalline $fcc$ copper by analyzing replica molecular dynamics simulations at the elastic-plastic limit. By means of committor analysis and Langevin modeling, our approach allows to systematically rank candidate (dis)order parameters, identify the critical nuclei (transition states), and infer the free-energy landscapes. Given its general foundations, this method can be extended to nucleation phenomena in a broad class of materials.

### Insight-V: Exploring Long-Chain Visual Reasoning with Multimodal Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Yuhao Dong, Zuyan Liu, Hai-Long Sun, Jingkang Yang, Winston Hu, Yongming Rao, Ziwei Liu

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T16:03:31Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate enhanced capabilities and reliability by reasoning more, evolving from Chain-of-Thought prompting to product-level solutions like OpenAI o1. Despite various efforts to improve LLM reasoning, high-quality long-chain reasoning data and optimized training pipelines still remain inadequately explored in vision-language tasks. In this paper, we present Insight-V, an early effort to 1) scalably produce long and robust reasoning data for complex multi-modal tasks, and 2) an effective training pipeline to enhance the reasoning capabilities of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs). Specifically, to create long and structured reasoning data without human labor, we design a two-step pipeline with a progressive strategy to generate sufficiently long and diverse reasoning paths and a multi-granularity assessment method to ensure data quality. We observe that directly supervising MLLMs with such long and complex reasoning data will not yield ideal reasoning ability. To tackle this problem, we design a multi-agent system consisting of a reasoning agent dedicated to performing long-chain reasoning and a summary agent trained to judge and summarize reasoning results. We further incorporate an iterative DPO algorithm to enhance the reasoning agent's generation stability and quality. Based on the popular LLaVA-NeXT model and our stronger base MLLM, we demonstrate significant performance gains across challenging multi-modal benchmarks requiring visual reasoning. Benefiting from our multi-agent system, Insight-V can also easily maintain or improve performance on perception-focused multi-modal tasks.

### FlexLLM: A System for Co-Serving Large Language Model Inference and   Parameter-Efficient Finetuning
**Authors**: Gabriele Oliaro, Xupeng Miao, Xinhao Cheng, Vineeth Kada, Ruohan Gao, Yingyi Huang, Remi Delacourt, April Yang, Yingcheng Wang, Mengdi Wu, Colin Unger, Zhihao Jia

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T15:56:59Z

**Summary**: Finetuning large language models (LLMs) is essential for task adaptation, yet serving stacks today isolate inference and finetuning on separate GPU clusters -- wasting resources and under-utilizing hardware. We introduce FlexLLM, the first system to co-serve LLM inference and PEFT-based finetuning on shared GPUs by fusing computation at the token level. The static compilation optimizations in FlexLLM -- dependent parallelization and graph pruning significantly shrink activation memory, leading to end-to-end GPU memory savings by up to 80%. At runtime, a novel token-level finetuning mechanism paired with a hybrid token scheduler dynamically interleaves inference and training tokens within each co-serving iteration, meeting strict latency SLOs while maximizing utilization. In end-to-end benchmarks on LLaMA-3.1-8B, Qwen-2.5-14B, and Qwen-2.5-32B, FlexLLM sustains the inference SLO requirements up to 20 req/s, and improves finetuning throughput by 1.9-4.8x under heavy inference workloads and 2.5-6.8x under light loads, preserving over 76% of peak finetuning progress even at peak demand. The source code of FlexLLM is publicly available at https://github.com/flexflow/FlexFlow/.

### Project-and-Fuse: Improving RGB-D Semantic Segmentation via Graph   Convolution Networks
**Authors**: Xiaoyan Jiang, Bohan Wang, Xinlong Wan, Shanshan Chen, Hamido Fujita, Hanan Abd. Al Juaid

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T15:52:03Z

**Summary**: Most existing RGB-D semantic segmentation methods focus on the feature level fusion, including complex cross-modality and cross-scale fusion modules. However, these methods may cause misalignment problem in the feature fusion process and counter-intuitive patches in the segmentation results. Inspired by the popular pixel-node-pixel pipeline, we propose to 1) fuse features from two modalities in a late fusion style, during which the geometric feature injection is guided by texture feature prior; 2) employ Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on the fused feature to alleviate the emergence of irregular patches by inferring patch relationship. At the 3D feature extraction stage, we argue that traditional CNNs are not efficient enough for depth maps. So, we encode depth map into normal map, after which CNNs can easily extract object surface tendencies.At projection matrix generation stage, we find the existence of Biased-Assignment and Ambiguous-Locality issues in the original pipeline. Therefore, we propose to 1) adopt the Kullback-Leibler Loss to ensure no missing important pixel features, which can be viewed as hard pixel mining process; 2) connect regions that are close to each other in the Euclidean space as well as in the semantic space with larger edge weights so that location informations can been considered. Extensive experiments on two public datasets, NYU-DepthV2 and SUN RGB-D, have shown that our approach can consistently boost the performance of RGB-D semantic segmentation task.

### Closing the Loop: A Systematic Review of Experience-Driven Game   Adaptation
**Authors**: Phil Lopes, Nuno Fachada, Maria Fonseca

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T15:38:55Z

**Summary**: Adaptive game systems aim to enrich player experiences by dynamically adjusting game content in response to user data. While extensive research has addressed content personalization and player experience modeling, the integration of these components into fully operational adaptive gameplay systems remains limited. This systematic review, conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines, analyzes 17 empirical studies published between January 2015 and May 2024, identifying and analyzing approaches that implement the complete experience-driven loop -- including player sensing, modeling, and content adaptation. Game telemetry remains the most prevalent sensing modality, although other non-invasive methods suitable for affective modeling -- such as facial expression analysis (FEA) and peripheral interaction data -- remain underutilized despite their potential for real-time emotional inference. Knowledge-based methods, such as rule-based systems and heuristics, dominate modeling and adaptation due to their interpretability and low resource demands, whereas machine learning approaches face challenges related to data availability and transparency. Despite their relevance to immersive and therapeutic experiences, affective states such as stress and anxiety remain largely ignored, as systems continue to favor performance over emotion-sensitive adaptation. These findings highlight a crucial research direction: advancing emotionally responsive game systems that move beyond performance optimization by incorporating underutilized sensing modalities -- such as FEA and peripheral interaction -- to enable real-time affect-driven personalization. Advancing in this direction holds strong potential to increase immersion, personalize gameplay, and support affect regulation across entertainment and therapeutic contexts.

### MoDeGPT: Modular Decomposition for Large Language Model Compression
**Authors**: Chi-Heng Lin, Shangqian Gao, James Seale Smith, Abhishek Patel, Shikhar Tuli, Yilin Shen, Hongxia Jin, Yen-Chang Hsu

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T15:34:42Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have reshaped the landscape of artificial intelligence by demonstrating exceptional performance across various tasks. However, substantial computational requirements make their deployment challenging on devices with limited resources. Recently, compression methods using low-rank matrix techniques have shown promise, yet these often lead to degraded accuracy or introduce significant overhead in parameters and inference latency. This paper introduces \textbf{Mo}dular \textbf{De}composition (MoDeGPT), a novel structured compression framework that does not need recovery fine-tuning while resolving the above drawbacks. MoDeGPT partitions the Transformer block into modules comprised of matrix pairs and reduces the hidden dimensions via reconstructing the module-level outputs. MoDeGPT is developed based on a theoretical framework that utilizes three well-established matrix decomposition algorithms -- Nystr\"om approximation, CR decomposition, and SVD -- and applies them to our redefined transformer modules. Our comprehensive experiments show MoDeGPT, without backward propagation, matches or surpasses previous structured compression methods that rely on gradient information, and saves 98% of compute costs on compressing a 13B model. On \textsc{Llama}-2/3 and OPT models, MoDeGPT maintains 90-95% zero-shot performance with 25-30% compression rates. Moreover, the compression can be done on a single GPU within a few hours and increases the inference throughput by up to 46%.

### Julia as a universal platform for statistical software development
**Authors**: David Roodman

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T15:08:15Z

**Summary**: The julia package integrates the Julia programming language into Stata. Users can transfer data between Stata and Julia, issue Julia commands to analyze and plot, and pass results back to Stata. Julia's econometric ecosystem is not as mature as Stata's or R's or Python's. But Julia is an excellent environment for developing high-performance numerical applications, which can then be called from many platforms. For example, the boottest program for wild bootstrap-based inference (Roodman et al. 2019) and fwildclusterboot for R (Fischer and Roodman 2021) can use the same Julia back end. And the program reghdfejl mimics reghdfe (Correia 2016) in fitting linear models with high-dimensional fixed effects while calling a Julia package for tenfold acceleration on hard problems. reghdfejl also supports nonlinear fixed-effect models that cannot otherwise be fit in Stata--though preliminarily, as the Julia package for that purpose is immature.

### TRAVELER: A Benchmark for Evaluating Temporal Reasoning across Vague,   Implicit and Explicit References
**Authors**: Svenja Kenneweg, Jörg Deigmöller, Philipp Cimiano, Julian Eggert

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T14:56:50Z

**Summary**: Understanding and resolving temporal references is essential in Natural Language Understanding as we often refer to the past or future in daily communication. Although existing benchmarks address a system's ability to reason about and resolve temporal references, systematic evaluation of specific temporal references remains limited. Towards closing this gap, we introduce TRAVELER, a novel synthetic benchmark dataset that follows a Question Answering paradigm and consists of questions involving temporal references with the corresponding correct answers. TRAVELER assesses models' abilities to resolve explicit, implicit relative to speech time, and vague temporal references. Beyond investigating the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs depending on the type of temporal reference, our benchmark also allows evaluation of performance in relation to the length of the set of events. For the category of vague temporal references, ground-truth answers were established via human surveys on Prolific, following a procedure similar to the one from Kenneweg et al. To demonstrate the benchmark's applicability, we evaluate four state-of-the-art LLMs using a question-answering task encompassing 3,300 questions. Our findings show that while the benchmarked LLMs can answer questions over event sets with a handful of events and explicit temporal references successfully, performance clearly deteriorates with larger event set length and when temporal references get less explicit. Notably, the vague question category exhibits the lowest performance across all models.   The benchmark is publicly available at: https://gitlab.ub.uni-bielefeld.de/s.kenneweg/TRAVELER

### Design-Based Inference under Random Potential Outcomes via Riesz   Representation
**Authors**: Yukai Yang

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T14:55:34Z

**Summary**: We introduce a general framework for design-based causal inference that accommodates stochastic potential outcomes, thereby extending the classical Neyman-Rubin setup in which outcomes are treated as fixed. In our formulation, each unit's potential outcome is modelled as a function $\tilde{y}_i(z, \omega)$, where $\omega$ denotes latent randomness external to the treatment assignment. Building on recent work that connects design-based estimation with the Riesz representation theorem, we construct causal estimators by embedding potential outcomes in a Hilbert space and defining treatment effects as linear functionals. This allows us to derive unbiased and consistent estimators, even when potential outcomes exhibit random variation. The framework retains the key advantage of design-based analysis, namely, the use of a known randomisation scheme for identification, while enabling inference in settings with inherent stochasticity. We establish large-sample properties under local dependence, provide a variance estimator compatible with sparse dependency structures, and illustrate the method through a simulation. Our results unify design-based reasoning with random-outcome modelling, broadening the applicability of causal inference in complex experimental environments.

### FreeInsert: Disentangled Text-Guided Object Insertion in 3D Gaussian   Scene without Spatial Priors
**Authors**: Chenxi Li, Weijie Wang, Qiang Li, Bruno Lepri, Nicu Sebe, Weizhi Nie

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T14:53:56Z

**Summary**: Text-driven object insertion in 3D scenes is an emerging task that enables intuitive scene editing through natural language. However, existing 2D editing-based methods often rely on spatial priors such as 2D masks or 3D bounding boxes, and they struggle to ensure consistency of the inserted object. These limitations hinder flexibility and scalability in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose FreeInsert, a novel framework that leverages foundation models including MLLMs, LGMs, and diffusion models to disentangle object generation from spatial placement. This enables unsupervised and flexible object insertion in 3D scenes without spatial priors. FreeInsert starts with an MLLM-based parser that extracts structured semantics, including object types, spatial relationships, and attachment regions, from user instructions. These semantics guide both the reconstruction of the inserted object for 3D consistency and the learning of its degrees of freedom. We leverage the spatial reasoning capabilities of MLLMs to initialize object pose and scale. A hierarchical, spatially aware refinement stage further integrates spatial semantics and MLLM-inferred priors to enhance placement. Finally, the appearance of the object is improved using the inserted-object image to enhance visual fidelity. Experimental results demonstrate that FreeInsert achieves semantically coherent, spatially precise, and visually realistic 3D insertions without relying on spatial priors, offering a user-friendly and flexible editing experience.

### Helping Big Language Models Protect Themselves: An Enhanced Filtering   and Summarization System
**Authors**: Sheikh Samit Muhaimin, Spyridon Mastorakis

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T14:42:26Z

**Summary**: The recent growth in the use of Large Language Models has made them vulnerable to sophisticated adversarial assaults, manipulative prompts, and encoded malicious inputs. Existing countermeasures frequently necessitate retraining models, which is computationally costly and impracticable for deployment. Without the need for retraining or fine-tuning, this study presents a unique defense paradigm that allows LLMs to recognize, filter, and defend against adversarial or malicious inputs on their own. There are two main parts to the suggested framework: (1) A prompt filtering module that uses sophisticated Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, including zero-shot classification, keyword analysis, and encoded content detection (e.g. base64, hexadecimal, URL encoding), to detect, decode, and classify harmful inputs; and (2) A summarization module that processes and summarizes adversarial research literature to give the LLM context-aware defense knowledge. This approach strengthens LLMs' resistance to adversarial exploitation by fusing text extraction, summarization, and harmful prompt analysis. According to experimental results, this integrated technique has a 98.71% success rate in identifying harmful patterns, manipulative language structures, and encoded prompts. By employing a modest amount of adversarial research literature as context, the methodology also allows the model to react correctly to harmful inputs with a larger percentage of jailbreak resistance and refusal rate. While maintaining the quality of LLM responses, the framework dramatically increases LLM's resistance to hostile misuse, demonstrating its efficacy as a quick and easy substitute for time-consuming, retraining-based defenses.

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T14:37:09Z

**Summary**: We present an in-depth analysis of the fiber assignment incompleteness in the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 1 (DR1). This incompleteness is caused by the restricted mobility of the robotic fiber positioner in the DESI focal plane, which limits the number of galaxies that can be observed at the same time, especially at small angular separations. As a result, the observed clustering amplitude is suppressed in a scale-dependent manner, which, if not addressed, can severely impact the inference of cosmological parameters. We discuss the methods adopted for simulating fiber assignment on mocks and data. In particular, we introduce the fast fiber assignment (FFA) emulator, which was employed to obtain the power spectrum covariance adopted for the DR1 full-shape analysis. We present the mitigation techniques, organised in two classes: measurement stage and model stage. We then use high fidelity mocks as a reference to quantify both the accuracy of the FFA emulator and the effectiveness of the different measurement-stage mitigation techniques. This complements the studies conducted in a parallel paper for the model-stage techniques, namely the $\theta$-cut approach. We find that pairwise inverse probability (PIP) weights with angular upweighting recover the "true" clustering in all the cases considered, in both Fourier and configuration space. Notably, we present the first ever power spectrum measurement with PIP weights from real data.

### Document Retrieval Augmented Fine-Tuning (DRAFT) for safety-critical   software assessments
**Authors**: Regan Bolton, Mohammadreza Sheikhfathollahi, Simon Parkinson, Vanessa Vulovic, Gary Bamford, Dan Basher, Howard Parkinson

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T14:34:33Z

**Summary**: Safety critical software assessment requires robust assessment against complex regulatory frameworks, a process traditionally limited by manual evaluation. This paper presents Document Retrieval-Augmented Fine-Tuning (DRAFT), a novel approach that enhances the capabilities of a large language model (LLM) for safety-critical compliance assessment. DRAFT builds upon existing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques by introducing a novel fine-tuning framework that accommodates our dual-retrieval architecture, which simultaneously accesses both software documentation and applicable reference standards. To fine-tune DRAFT, we develop a semi-automated dataset generation methodology that incorporates variable numbers of relevant documents with meaningful distractors, closely mirroring real-world assessment scenarios. Experiments with GPT-4o-mini demonstrate a 7% improvement in correctness over the baseline model, with qualitative improvements in evidence handling, response structure, and domain-specific reasoning. DRAFT represents a practical approach to improving compliance assessment systems while maintaining the transparency and evidence-based reasoning essential in regulatory domains.

### Towards One Model for Classical Dimensionality Reduction: A   Probabilistic Perspective on UMAP and t-SNE
**Authors**: Aditya Ravuri, Neil D. Lawrence

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T14:24:42Z

**Summary**: This paper shows that dimensionality reduction methods such as UMAP and t-SNE, can be approximately recast as MAP inference methods corresponding to a model introduced in Ravuri et al. (2023), that describes the graph Laplacian (an estimate of the data precision matrix) using a Wishart distribution, with a mean given by a non-linear covariance function evaluated on the latents. This interpretation offers deeper theoretical and semantic insights into such algorithms, and forging a connection to Gaussian process latent variable models by showing that well-known kernels can be used to describe covariances implied by graph Laplacians. We also introduce tools with which similar dimensionality reduction methods can be studied.

### Accurate and Efficient Cardiac Digital Twin from surface ECGs: Insights   into Identifiability of Ventricular Conduction System
**Authors**: Thomas Grandits, Karli Gillette, Gernot Plank, Simone Pezzuto

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T14:14:59Z

**Summary**: Digital twins for cardiac electrophysiology are an enabling technology for precision cardiology. Current forward models are advanced enough to simulate the cardiac electric activity under different pathophysiological conditions and accurately replicate clinical signals like torso electrocardiograms (ECGs). In this work, we address the challenge of matching subject-specific QRS complexes using anatomically accurate, physiologically grounded cardiac digital twins. By fitting the initial conditions of a cardiac propagation model, our non-invasive method predicts activation patterns during sinus rhythm. For the first time, we demonstrate that distinct activation maps can generate identical surface ECGs. To address this non-uniqueness, we introduce a physiological prior based on the distribution of Purkinje-muscle junctions. Additionally, we develop a digital twin ensemble for probabilistic inference of cardiac activation. Our approach marks a significant advancement in the calibration of cardiac digital twins and enhances their credibility for clinical application.

### Improving Continual Learning Performance and Efficiency with Auxiliary   Classifiers
**Authors**: Filip Szatkowski, Yaoyue Zheng, Fei Yang, Bartłomiej Twardowski, Tomasz Trzciński, Joost van de Weijer

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T14:03:34Z

**Summary**: Continual learning is crucial for applying machine learning in challenging, dynamic, and often resource-constrained environments. However, catastrophic forgetting - overwriting previously learned knowledge when new information is acquired - remains a major challenge. In this work, we examine the intermediate representations in neural network layers during continual learning and find that such representations are less prone to forgetting, highlighting their potential to accelerate computation. Motivated by these findings, we propose to use auxiliary classifiers(ACs) to enhance performance and demonstrate that integrating ACs into various continual learning methods consistently improves accuracy across diverse evaluation settings, yielding an average 10% relative gain. We also leverage the ACs to reduce the average cost of the inference by 10-60% without compromising accuracy, enabling the model to return the predictions before computing all the layers. Our approach provides a scalable and efficient solution for continual learning.

### MultiGran-STGCNFog: Towards Accurate and High-Throughput Inference for   Multi-Granular Spatiotemporal Traffic Forecasting
**Authors**: Zhaoyan Wang, Xiangchi Song, In-Young Ko

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T13:55:22Z

**Summary**: Accurate traffic forecasting and swift inference provision are essential for intelligent transportation systems. However, the present Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)-based approaches cannot extract and fuse multi-granular spatiotemporal features across various spatial and temporal scales sufficiently, proven to yield less accurate forecasts. Besides, additional feature extraction branches introduced in prior studies critically increased model complexity and extended inference time, making it challenging to provide fast inference for traffic forecasting. In this paper, we propose MultiGran-STGCNFog, an efficient fog distributed inference system with a novel traffic forecasting model that employs multi-granular spatiotemporal feature fusion on generated dynamic traffic graphs to fully capture interdependent traffic dynamics. The proposed scheduling algorithm GA-DPHDS, optimizing layer execution order and layer-device scheduling scheme simultaneously, contributes to considerable inference throughput improvement by leveraging heterogeneous fog devices in a pipelined manner. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over selected baselines.

### FlowDubber: Movie Dubbing with LLM-based Semantic-aware Learning and   Flow Matching based Voice Enhancing
**Authors**: Gaoxiang Cong, Liang Li, Jiadong Pan, Zhedong Zhang, Amin Beheshti, Anton van den Hengel, Yuankai Qi, Qingming Huang

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T13:30:19Z

**Summary**: Movie Dubbing aims to convert scripts into speeches that align with the given movie clip in both temporal and emotional aspects while preserving the vocal timbre of a given brief reference audio. Existing methods focus primarily on reducing the word error rate while ignoring the importance of lip-sync and acoustic quality. To address these issues, we propose a large language model (LLM) based flow matching architecture for dubbing, named FlowDubber, which achieves high-quality audio-visual sync and pronunciation by incorporating a large speech language model and dual contrastive aligning while achieving better acoustic quality via the proposed voice-enhanced flow matching than previous works. First, we introduce Qwen2.5 as the backbone of LLM to learn the in-context sequence from movie scripts and reference audio. Then, the proposed semantic-aware learning focuses on capturing LLM semantic knowledge at the phoneme level. Next, dual contrastive aligning (DCA) boosts mutual alignment with lip movement, reducing ambiguities where similar phonemes might be confused. Finally, the proposed Flow-based Voice Enhancing (FVE) improves acoustic quality in two aspects, which introduces an LLM-based acoustics flow matching guidance to strengthen clarity and uses affine style prior to enhance identity when recovering noise into mel-spectrograms via gradient vector field prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms several state-of-the-art methods on two primary benchmarks. The demos are available at {\href{https://galaxycong.github.io/LLM-Flow-Dubber/}{\textcolor{red}{https://galaxycong.github.io/LLM-Flow-Dubber/}}}.

### Doubly-Robust Functional Average Treatment Effect Estimation
**Authors**: Lorenzo Testa, Tobia Boschi, Francesca Chiaromonte, Edward H. Kennedy, Matthew Reimherr

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T13:27:02Z

**Summary**: Understanding causal relationships in the presence of complex, structured data remains a central challenge in modern statistics and science in general. While traditional causal inference methods are well-suited for scalar outcomes, many scientific applications demand tools capable of handling functional data -- outcomes observed as functions over continuous domains such as time or space. Motivated by this need, we propose DR-FoS, a novel method for estimating the Functional Average Treatment Effect (FATE) in observational studies with functional outcomes. DR-FoS exhibits double robustness properties, ensuring consistent estimation of FATE even if either the outcome or the treatment assignment model is misspecified. By leveraging recent advances in functional data analysis and causal inference, we establish the asymptotic properties of the estimator, proving its convergence to a Gaussian process. This guarantees valid inference with simultaneous confidence bands across the entire functional domain. Through extensive simulations, we show that DR-FoS achieves robust performance under a wide range of model specifications. Finally, we illustrate the utility of DR-FoS in a real-world application, analyzing functional outcomes to uncover meaningful causal insights in the SHARE (Survey of Health, Aging and Retirement in Europe) dataset.

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T13:26:47Z

**Summary**: A scientific study begins with a central question, and search engines like PubMed are the first tools for retrieving knowledge and understanding the current state of the art. Large Language Models (LLMs) have been used in research, promising acceleration and deeper results. However, besides caution, they demand rigorous validation. Assessing complex biological relationships remains challenging for SQL-based tools and LLM models. Here, we introduce the Digital Pathway Curation (DPC) pipeline to evaluate the reproducibility and accuracy of the Gemini models against PubMed search and human expert curation. Using two omics experiments, we created a large dataset (Ensemble) based on determining pathway-disease associations. With the Ensemble dataset, we demonstrate that Gemini achieves high run-to-run reproducibility of approximately 99% and inter-model reproducibility of around 75%. Next, we calculate the crowdsourced consensus using a smaller dataset. The CSC allows us to calculate accuracies, and the Gemini multi-model consensus reached a significant accuracy of about 87%. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs are reproducible, reliable, and valuable tools for navigating complex biomedical knowledge.

### Fusing Foveal Fixations Using Linear Retinal Transformations and   Bayesian Experimental Design
**Authors**: Christopher K. I. Williams

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T13:17:08Z

**Summary**: Humans (and many vertebrates) face the problem of fusing together multiple fixations of a scene in order to obtain a representation of the whole, where each fixation uses a high-resolution fovea and decreasing resolution in the periphery. In this paper we explicitly represent the retinal transformation of a fixation as a linear downsampling of a high-resolution latent image of the scene, exploiting the known geometry. This linear transformation allows us to carry out exact inference for the latent variables in factor analysis (FA) and mixtures of FA models of the scene. Further, this allows us to formulate and solve the choice of "where to look next" as a Bayesian experimental design problem using the Expected Information Gain criterion. Experiments on the Frey faces and MNIST datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our models.

### A CFL-type Condition and Theoretical Insights for Discrete-Time Sparse   Full-Order Model Inference
**Authors**: Leonidas Gkimisis, Süleyman Yıldız, Peter Benner, Thomas Richter

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T13:12:37Z

**Summary**: In this work, we investigate the data-driven inference of a discrete-time dynamical system via a sparse Full-Order Model (sFOM). We first formulate the involved Least Squares (LS) problem and discuss the need for regularization, indicating a connection between the typically employed $l_2$ regularization and the stability of the inferred discrete-time sFOM. We then provide theoretical insights considering the consistency and stability properties of the inferred numerical schemes that form the sFOM and exemplify them via illustrative, 1D test cases of linear diffusion and linear advection. For linear advection, we analytically derive a "sampling CFL" condition, which dictates a bound for the ratio of spatial and temporal discretization steps in the training data that ensures stability of the inferred sFOM. Finally, we investigate the sFOM inference for two nonlinear problems, namely a 2D Burgers' test case and the incompressible flow in an oscillating lid driven cavity, and draw connections between the theoretical findings and the properties of the inferred, nonlinear sFOMs.

**Authors**: Mahdi Dhaini, Kafaite Zahra Hussain, Efstratios Zaradoukas, Gjergji Kasneci

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T13:00:05Z

**Summary**: As Natural Language Processing (NLP) models continue to evolve and become integral to high-stakes applications, ensuring their interpretability remains a critical challenge. Given the growing variety of explainability methods and diverse stakeholder requirements, frameworks that help stakeholders select appropriate explanations tailored to their specific use cases are increasingly important. To address this need, we introduce EvalxNLP, a Python framework for benchmarking state-of-the-art feature attribution methods for transformer-based NLP models. EvalxNLP integrates eight widely recognized explainability techniques from the Explainable AI (XAI) literature, enabling users to generate and evaluate explanations based on key properties such as faithfulness, plausibility, and complexity. Our framework also provides interactive, LLM-based textual explanations, facilitating user understanding of the generated explanations and evaluation outcomes. Human evaluation results indicate high user satisfaction with EvalxNLP, suggesting it is a promising framework for benchmarking explanation methods across diverse user groups. By offering a user-friendly and extensible platform, EvalxNLP aims at democratizing explainability tools and supporting the systematic comparison and advancement of XAI techniques in NLP.

**Summary**: We investigated the ability of the Euclid telescope to detect galaxy-scale gravitational lenses. To do so, we performed a systematic visual inspection of the $0.7\,\rm{deg}^2$ Euclid Early Release Observations data towards the Perseus cluster using both the high-resolution $I_{\scriptscriptstyle\rm E}$ band and the lower-resolution $Y_{\scriptscriptstyle\rm E}$, $J_{\scriptscriptstyle\rm E}$, $H_{\scriptscriptstyle\rm E}$ bands. Each extended source brighter than magnitude 23 in $I_{\scriptscriptstyle\rm E}$ was inspected by 41 expert human classifiers. This amounts to $12\,086$ stamps of $10^{\prime\prime}\,\times\,10^{\prime\prime}$. We found $3$ grade A and $13$ grade B candidates. We assessed the validity of these $16$ candidates by modelling them and checking that they are consistent with a single source lensed by a plausible mass distribution. Five of the candidates pass this check, five others are rejected by the modelling, and six are inconclusive. Extrapolating from the five successfully modelled candidates, we infer that the full $14\,000\,{\rm deg}^2$ of the Euclid Wide Survey should contain $100\,000^{+70\,000}_{-30\,000}$ galaxy-galaxy lenses that are both discoverable through visual inspection and have valid lens models. This is consistent with theoretical forecasts of $170\,000$ discoverable galaxy-galaxy lenses in Euclid. Our five modelled lenses have Einstein radii in the range $0.\!\!^{\prime\prime}68\,<\,\theta_\mathrm{E}\,<1.\!\!^{\prime\prime}24$, but their Einstein radius distribution is on the higher side when compared to theoretical forecasts. This suggests that our methodology is likely missing small-Einstein-radius systems. Whilst it is implausible to visually inspect the full Euclid dataset, our results corroborate the promise that Euclid will ultimately deliver a sample of around $10^5$ galaxy-scale lenses.

### From Bugs to Benefits: Improving User Stories by Leveraging Crowd   Knowledge with CrUISE-AC
**Authors**: Stefan Schwedt, Thomas Ströder

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T12:35:19Z

**Summary**: Costs for resolving software defects increase exponentially in late stages. Incomplete or ambiguous requirements are one of the biggest sources for defects, since stakeholders might not be able to communicate their needs or fail to share their domain specific knowledge. Combined with insufficient developer experience, teams are prone to constructing incorrect or incomplete features. To prevent this, requirements engineering has to explore knowledge sources beyond stakeholder interviews. Publicly accessible issue trackers for systems within the same application domain hold essential information on identified weaknesses, edge cases, and potential error sources, all documented by actual users. Our research aims at (1) identifying, and (2) leveraging such issues to improve an agile requirements artifact known as a "user story". We present CrUISE-AC (Crowd and User Informed Suggestion Engine for Acceptance Criteria) as a fully automated method that investigates issues and generates non-trivial additional acceptance criteria for a given user story by employing NLP techniques and an ensemble of LLMs. CrUISE- AC was evaluated by five independent experts in two distinct business domains. Our findings suggest that issue trackers hold valuable information pertinent to requirements engineering. Our evaluation shows that 80-82% of the generated acceptance criteria add relevant requirements to the user stories. Limitations are the dependence on accessible input issues and the fact that we do not check generated criteria for being conflict-free or non-overlapping with criteria from other user stories.

### Gaussian Differential Private Bootstrap by Subsampling
**Authors**: Holger Dette, Carina Graw

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T11:40:50Z

**Summary**: Bootstrap is a common tool for quantifying uncertainty in data analysis. However, besides additional computational costs in the application of the bootstrap on massive data, a challenging problem in bootstrap based inference under Differential Privacy consists in the fact that it requires repeated access to the data. As a consequence, bootstrap based differentially private inference requires a significant increase of the privacy budget, which on the other hand comes with a substantial loss in statistical accuracy.   A potential solution to reconcile the conflicting goals of statistical accuracy and privacy is to analyze the data under parametric model assumptions and in the last decade, several parametric bootstrap methods for inference under privacy have been investigated. However, uncertainty quantification by parametric bootstrap is only valid if the the quantities of interest can be identified as the parameters of a statistical model and the imposed model assumptions are (at least approximately) satisfied. An alternative to parametric methods is the empirical bootstrap that is a widely used tool for non-parametric inference and well studied in the non-private regime. However, under privacy, less insight is available. In this paper, we propose a private empirical $m$ out of $n$ bootstrap and validate its consistency and privacy guarantees under Gaussian Differential Privacy. Compared to the the private $n$ out of $n$ bootstrap, our approach has several advantages. First, it comes with less computational costs, in particular for massive data. Second, the proposed procedure needs less additional noise in the bootstrap iterations, which leads to an improved statistical accuracy while asymptotically guaranteeing the same level of privacy. Third, we demonstrate much better finite sample properties compared to the currently available procedures.

### Sparks of Tabular Reasoning via Text2SQL Reinforcement Learning
**Authors**: Josefa Lia Stoisser, Marc Boubnovski Martell, Julien Fauqueur

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T11:34:00Z

**Summary**: This work reframes the Text-to-SQL task as a pathway for teaching large language models (LLMs) to reason over and manipulate tabular data--moving beyond the traditional focus on query generation. We propose a two-stage framework that leverages SQL supervision to develop transferable table reasoning capabilities. First, we synthesize detailed chain-of-thought (CoT) traces from real-world SQL queries, providing step-by-step, clause-level supervision that teaches the model how to traverse, filter, and aggregate table fields. Second, we introduce a Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) reinforcement learning objective that connects SQL execution accuracy to generalizable reasoning by encouraging steps that extend beyond task-specific syntax and transfer across datasets. Empirically, our approach improves performance on standard Text-to-SQL benchmarks and achieves substantial gains on reasoning-intensive datasets such as BIRD and CRT-QA, demonstrating enhanced generalization and interpretability. Specifically, the distilled-quantized LLaMA model achieved a relative 33.9\% increase in accuracy when trained on Text-to-SQL tasks, while Qwen achieved a relative 14.5\% increase. These results suggest that SQL can serve not only as a target formalism but also as an effective scaffold for learning robust, transferable reasoning over structured data.

### A Causal World Model Underlying Next Token Prediction: Exploring GPT in   a Controlled Environment
**Authors**: Raanan Y. Rohekar, Yaniv Gurwicz, Sungduk Yu, Estelle Aflalo, Vasudev Lal

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T11:32:37Z

**Summary**: Do generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) models, trained only to predict the next token, implicitly learn a world model from which a sequence is generated one token at a time? We address this question by deriving a causal interpretation of the attention mechanism in GPT, and suggesting a causal world model that arises from this interpretation. Furthermore, we propose that GPT models, at inference time, can be utilized for zero-shot causal structure learning for input sequences and present a confidence score. Empirical evaluation is conducted in a controlled environment using the setup and rules of the Othello and Chess strategy games. A GPT, pre-trained on real-world games played with the intention of winning, is tested on out-of-distribution synthetic data consisting of sequences of random legal moves. We find that the GPT model is likely to generate legal next moves for out-of-distribution sequences for which a causal structure is encoded in the attention mechanism with high confidence. In cases for which the GPT model generates illegal moves it also fails to capture any causal structure.

### HarmoniCa: Harmonizing Training and Inference for Better Feature Caching   in Diffusion Transformer Acceleration
**Authors**: Yushi Huang, Zining Wang, Ruihao Gong, Jing Liu, Xinjie Zhang, Jinyang Guo, Xianglong Liu, Jun Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T11:29:31Z

**Summary**: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) excel in generative tasks but face practical deployment challenges due to high inference costs. Feature caching, which stores and retrieves redundant computations, offers the potential for acceleration. Existing learning-based caching, though adaptive, overlooks the impact of the prior timestep. It also suffers from misaligned objectives--aligned predicted noise vs. high-quality images--between training and inference. These two discrepancies compromise both performance and efficiency. To this end, we harmonize training and inference with a novel learning-based caching framework dubbed HarmoniCa. It first incorporates Step-Wise Denoising Training (SDT) to ensure the continuity of the denoising process, where prior steps can be leveraged. In addition, an Image Error Proxy-Guided Objective (IEPO) is applied to balance image quality against cache utilization through an efficient proxy to approximate the image error. Extensive experiments across $8$ models, $4$ samplers, and resolutions from $256\times256$ to $2K$ demonstrate superior performance and speedup of our framework. For instance, it achieves over $40\%$ latency reduction (i.e., $2.07\times$ theoretical speedup) and improved performance on PixArt-$\alpha$. Remarkably, our image-free approach reduces training time by $25\%$ compared with the previous method. Our code is available at https://github.com/ModelTC/HarmoniCa.

### Fast Flow-based Visuomotor Policies via Conditional Optimal Transport   Couplings
**Authors**: Andreas Sochopoulos, Nikolay Malkin, Nikolaos Tsagkas, João Moura, Michael Gienger, Sethu Vijayakumar

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T10:47:21Z

**Summary**: Diffusion and flow matching policies have recently demonstrated remarkable performance in robotic applications by accurately capturing multimodal robot trajectory distributions. However, their computationally expensive inference, due to the numerical integration of an ODE or SDE, limits their applicability as real-time controllers for robots. We introduce a methodology that utilizes conditional Optimal Transport couplings between noise and samples to enforce straight solutions in the flow ODE for robot action generation tasks. We show that naively coupling noise and samples fails in conditional tasks and propose incorporating condition variables into the coupling process to improve few-step performance. The proposed few-step policy achieves a 4% higher success rate with a 10x speed-up compared to Diffusion Policy on a diverse set of simulation tasks. Moreover, it produces high-quality and diverse action trajectories within 1-2 steps on a set of real-world robot tasks. Our method also retains the same training complexity as Diffusion Policy and vanilla Flow Matching, in contrast to distillation-based approaches.

### Automating the Generation of Prompts for LLM-based Action Choice in PDDL   Planning
**Authors**: Katharina Stein, Daniel Fišer, Jörg Hoffmann, Alexander Koller

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T10:41:18Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized a large variety of NLP tasks. An active debate is to what extent they can do reasoning and planning. Prior work has assessed the latter in the specific context of PDDL planning, based on manually converting three PDDL domains into natural language (NL) prompts. Here we automate this conversion step, showing how to leverage an LLM to automatically generate NL prompts from PDDL input. Our automatically generated NL prompts result in similar LLM-planning performance as the previous manually generated ones. Beyond this, the automation enables us to run much larger experiments, providing for the first time a broad evaluation of LLM planning performance in PDDL. Our NL prompts yield better performance than PDDL prompts and simple template-based NL prompts. Compared to symbolic planners, LLM planning lags far behind; but in some domains, our best LLM configuration scales up further than A$^\star$ using LM-cut.

### A flexible Bayesian non-parametric mixture model reveals multiple   dependencies of swap errors in visual working memory
**Authors**: Puria Radmard, Paul M. Bays, Máté Lengyel

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T10:38:45Z

**Summary**: Human behavioural data in psychophysics has been used to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of many cognitive processes, such as attention, sensorimotor integration, and perceptual decision making. Visual working memory has particularly benefited from this approach: analyses of VWM errors have proven crucial for understanding VWM capacity and coding schemes, in turn constraining neural models of both. One poorly understood class of VWM errors are swap errors, whereby participants recall an uncued item from memory. Swap errors could arise from erroneous memory encoding, noisy storage, or errors at retrieval time - previous research has mostly implicated the latter two. However, these studies made strong a priori assumptions on the detailed mechanisms and/or parametric form of errors contributed by these sources. Here, we pursue a data-driven approach instead, introducing a Bayesian non-parametric mixture model of swap errors (BNS) which provides a flexible descriptive model of swapping behaviour, such that swaps are allowed to depend on both the probed and reported features of every stimulus item. We fit BNS to the trial-by-trial behaviour of human participants and show that it recapitulates the strong dependence of swaps on cue similarity in multiple datasets. Critically, BNS reveals that this dependence coexists with a non-monotonic modulation in the report feature dimension for a random dot motion direction-cued, location-reported dataset. The form of the modulation inferred by BNS opens new questions about the importance of memory encoding in causing swap errors in VWM, a distinct source to the previously suggested binding and cueing errors. Our analyses, combining qualitative comparisons of the highly interpretable BNS parameter structure with rigorous quantitative model comparison and recovery methods, show that previous interpretations of swap errors may have been incomplete.

### LLM Security: Vulnerabilities, Attacks, Defenses, and Countermeasures
**Authors**: Francisco Aguilera-Martínez, Fernando Berzal

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T10:35:26Z

**Summary**: As large language models (LLMs) continue to evolve, it is critical to assess the security threats and vulnerabilities that may arise both during their training phase and after models have been deployed. This survey seeks to define and categorize the various attacks targeting LLMs, distinguishing between those that occur during the training phase and those that affect already trained models. A thorough analysis of these attacks is presented, alongside an exploration of defense mechanisms designed to mitigate such threats. Defenses are classified into two primary categories: prevention-based and detection-based defenses. Furthermore, our survey summarizes possible attacks and their corresponding defense strategies. It also provides an evaluation of the effectiveness of the known defense mechanisms for the different security threats. Our survey aims to offer a structured framework for securing LLMs, while also identifying areas that require further research to improve and strengthen defenses against emerging security challenges.

### Self-moderation in the decentralized era: decoding blocking behavior on   Bluesky
**Authors**: Carlo Bono, Nick Liu, Giuseppe Russo, Francesco Pierri

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T10:32:39Z

**Summary**: Moderation and blocking behavior, both closely related to the mitigation of abuse and misinformation on social platforms, are fundamental mechanisms for maintaining healthy online communities. However, while centralized platforms typically employ top-down moderation, decentralized networks rely on users to self-regulate through mechanisms like blocking actions to safeguard their online experience. Given the novelty of the decentralized paradigm, addressing self-moderation is critical for understanding how community safety and user autonomy can be effectively balanced. This study examines user blocking on Bluesky, a decentralized social networking platform, providing a comprehensive analysis of over three months of user activity through the lens of blocking behaviour. We define profiles based on 86 features that describe user activity, content characteristics, and network interactions, addressing two primary questions: (1) Is the likelihood of a user being blocked inferable from their online behavior? and (2) What behavioral features are associated with an increased likelihood of being blocked? Our findings offer valuable insights and contribute with a robust analytical framework to advance research in moderation on decentralized social networks.

### Realizing Fully-Connected Layers Over the Air via Reconfigurable   Intelligent Surfaces
**Authors**: Meng Hua, Chenghong Bian, Haotian Wu, Deniz Gündüz

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T10:21:44Z

**Summary**: By leveraging the waveform superposition property of the multiple access channel, over-the-air computation (AirComp) enables the execution of digital computations through analog means in the wireless domain, leading to faster processing and reduced latency. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to implement a neural network (NN) consisting of digital fully connected (FC) layers using physically reconfigurable hardware. Specifically, we investigate reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs)-assisted multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems to emulate the functionality of a NN for over-the-air inference. In this setup, both the RIS and the transceiver are jointly configured to manipulate the ambient wireless propagation environment, effectively reproducing the adjustable weights of a digital FC layer. We refer to this new computational paradigm as \textit{AirFC}. We formulate an imitation error minimization problem between the effective channel created by RIS and a target FC layer by jointly optimizing over-the-air parameters. To solve this non-convex optimization problem, an extremely low-complexity alternating optimization algorithm is proposed, where semi-closed-form/closed-form solutions for all optimization variables are derived. Simulation results show that the RIS-assisted MIMO-based AirFC can achieve competitive classification accuracy. Furthermore, it is also shown that a multi-RIS configuration significantly outperforms a single-RIS setup, particularly in line-of-sight (LoS)-dominated channels.

### Low-rank bilinear autoregressive models for three-way criminal activity   tensors
**Authors**: Gregor Zens, Carlos Díaz, Daniele Durante, Eleonora Patacchini

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T10:16:16Z

**Summary**: Criminal activity data are typically available via a three-way tensor encoding the reported frequencies of different crime categories across time and space. The challenges that arise in the design of interpretable, yet realistic, model-based representations of the complex dependencies within and across these three dimensions have led to an increasing adoption of black-box predictive strategies. Although this perspective has proved successful in producing accurate forecasts guiding targeted interventions, the lack of interpretable model-based characterizations of the dependence structures underlying criminal activity tensors prevents from inferring the cascading effects of these interventions across the different dimensions. We address this gap through the design of a low-rank bilinear autoregressive model which achieves comparable predictive performance to black-box strategies, while allowing interpretable inference on the dependence structures of criminal activity reports across crime categories, time, and space. This representation incorporates the time dimension via an autoregressive construction, accounting for spatial effects and dependencies among crime categories through a separable low-rank bilinear formulation. When applied to Chicago police reports, the proposed model showcases remarkable predictive performance and also reveals interpretable dependence structures unveiling fundamental crime dynamics. These results facilitate the design of more refined intervention policies informed by cascading effects of the policy itself.

### On the Limitations of Steering in Language Model Alignment
**Authors**: Chebrolu Niranjan, Kokil Jaidka, Gerard Christopher Yeo

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T10:08:34Z

**Summary**: Steering vectors are a promising approach to aligning language model behavior at inference time. In this paper, we propose a framework to assess the limitations of steering vectors as alignment mechanisms. Using a framework of transformer hook interventions and antonym-based function vectors, we evaluate the role of prompt structure and context complexity in steering effectiveness. Our findings indicate that steering vectors are promising for specific alignment tasks, such as value alignment, but may not provide a robust foundation for general-purpose alignment in LLMs, particularly in complex scenarios. We establish a methodological foundation for future investigations into steering capabilities of reasoning models.

### Model Checks in a Kernel Ridge Regression Framework
**Authors**: Yuhao Li

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T10:06:39Z

**Summary**: We propose new reproducing kernel-based tests for model checking in conditional moment restriction models. By regressing estimated residuals on kernel functions via kernel ridge regression (KRR), we obtain a coefficient function in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) that is zero if and only if the model is correctly specified. We introduce two classes of test statistics: (i) projection-based tests, using RKHS inner products to capture global deviations, and (ii) random location tests, evaluating the KRR estimator at randomly chosen covariate points to detect local departures. The tests are consistent against fixed alternatives and sensitive to local alternatives at the $n^{-1/2}$ rate. When nuisance parameters are estimated, Neyman orthogonality projections ensure valid inference without repeated estimation in bootstrap samples. The random location tests are interpretable and can visualize model misspecification. Simulations show strong power and size control, especially in higher dimensions, outperforming existing methods.

### TActiLE: Tiny Active LEarning for wearable devices
**Authors**: Massimo Pavan, Claudio Galimberti, Manuel Roveri

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T10:05:50Z

**Summary**: Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) algorithms have seen extensive use in recent years, enabling wearable devices to be not only connected but also genuinely intelligent by running machine learning (ML) computations directly on-device. Among such devices, smart glasses have particularly benefited from TinyML advancements. TinyML facilitates the on-device execution of the inference phase of ML algorithms on embedded and wearable devices, and more recently, it has expanded into On-device Learning (ODL), which allows both inference and learning phases to occur directly on the device. The application of ODL techniques to wearable devices is particularly compelling, as it enables the development of more personalized models that adapt based on the data of the user. However, one of the major challenges of ODL algorithms is the scarcity of labeled data collected on-device. In smart wearable contexts, requiring users to manually label large amounts of data is often impractical and could lead to user disengagement with the technology. To address this issue, this paper explores the application of Active Learning (AL) techniques, i.e., techniques that aim at minimizing the labeling effort, by actively selecting from a large quantity of unlabeled data only a small subset to be labeled and added to the training set of the algorithm. In particular, we propose TActiLE, a novel AL algorithm that selects from the stream of on-device sensor data the ones that would help the ML algorithm improve the most once coupled with labels provided by the user. TActiLE is the first Active Learning technique specifically designed for the TinyML context. We evaluate its effectiveness and efficiency through experiments on multiple image classification datasets. The results demonstrate its suitability for tiny and wearable devices.

### Reward Guidance for Reinforcement Learning Tasks Based on Large Language   Models: The LMGT Framework
**Authors**: Yongxin Deng, Xihe Qiu, Jue Chen, Xiaoyu Tan

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T09:58:28Z

**Summary**: The inherent uncertainty in the environmental transition model of Reinforcement Learning (RL) necessitates a delicate balance between exploration and exploitation. This balance is crucial for optimizing computational resources to accurately estimate expected rewards for the agent. In scenarios with sparse rewards, such as robotic control systems, achieving this balance is particularly challenging. However, given that many environments possess extensive prior knowledge, learning from the ground up in such contexts may be redundant. To address this issue, we propose Language Model Guided reward Tuning (LMGT), a novel, sample-efficient framework. LMGT leverages the comprehensive prior knowledge embedded in Large Language Models (LLMs) and their proficiency in processing non-standard data forms, such as wiki tutorials. By utilizing LLM-guided reward shifts, LMGT adeptly balances exploration and exploitation, thereby guiding the agent's exploratory behavior and enhancing sample efficiency. We have rigorously evaluated LMGT across various RL tasks and evaluated it in the embodied robotic environment Housekeep. Our results demonstrate that LMGT consistently outperforms baseline methods. Furthermore, the findings suggest that our framework can substantially reduce the computational resources required during the RL training phase.

### Methodological Foundations for AI-Driven Survey Question Generation
**Authors**: Ted K. Mburu, Kangxuan Rong, Campbell J. McColley, Alexandra Werth

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T09:50:34Z

**Summary**: This paper presents a methodological framework for using generative AI in educational survey research. We explore how Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate adaptive, context-aware survey questions and introduce the Synthetic Question-Response Analysis (SQRA) framework, which enables iterative testing and refinement of AI-generated prompts prior to deployment with human participants. Guided by Activity Theory, we analyze how AI tools mediate participant engagement and learning, and we examine ethical issues such as bias, privacy, and transparency. Through sentiment, lexical, and structural analyses of both AI-to-AI and AI-to-human survey interactions, we evaluate the alignment and effectiveness of these questions. Our findings highlight the promise and limitations of AI-driven survey instruments, emphasizing the need for robust prompt engineering and validation to support trustworthy, scalable, and contextually relevant data collection in engineering education.

### "Little red dots" cannot reside in the same dark matter halos as   comparably luminous unobscured quasars
**Authors**: Elia Pizzati, Joseph F. Hennawi, Joop Schaye, Anna-Christina Eilers, Jiamu Huang, Jan-Torge Schindler, Feige Wang

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T09:15:49Z

**Summary**: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has uncovered a new population of candidate broad-line AGN emerging in the early Universe, named ''little red dots'' (LRDs) because of their compactness and red colors at optical wavelengths. LRDs appear to be surprisingly abundant ($\approx 10^{-5}\,\mathrm{cMpc}^{-3}$) given that their inferred bolometric luminosities largely overlap with the ones of the UV-luminous quasars identified at high $z$ in wide-field spectroscopic surveys. In this work, we investigate how the population of LRDs and/or other UV-obscured AGN relates to the one of unobscured, UV-selected quasars. By comparing their number densities, we infer an extremely large and rapidly evolving obscured:unobscured ratio, ranging from $\approx20:1$ at $z\approx4$ to $\approx2300:1$ at $z\approx7$, and possibly extending out to very high ($\approx10^{47}\,\mathrm{erg}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$) bolometric luminosities. This large obscured:unobscured ratio is incompatible with the UV-luminous duty cycle measured for unobscured quasars at $z\approx4-6$, suggesting that LRDs are too abundant to be hosted by the same halos as unobscured quasars. This implies that either (a) the bolometric luminosities of LRDs are strongly overestimated (possibly because LRDs are dominated by stellar galaxy light) or (b) LRDs follow different scaling relations than the ones of UV-selected quasars, representing a new population of accreting SMBHs emerging in the early Universe. A direct comparison between the clustering of LRDs and the one of faint UV-selected quasars will ultimately confirm these findings, and shed light on key properties of LRDs such as their host mass distribution and duty cycle. We provide a mock analysis for the clustering of LRDs and show that it is feasible with current and upcoming JWST surveys.

### Reheating ACTs on Starobinsky and Higgs inflation
**Authors**: D. S. Zharov, O. O. Sobol, S. I. Vilchinskii

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T09:15:41Z

**Summary**: In the recent sixth data release (DR6) of the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) collaboration, the value of $n_{\rm s}=0.9743 \pm 0.0034$ for the scalar spectral index is reported, which excludes the Starobinsky and Higgs inflationary models at $2\sigma$ level. In this paper, we perform a Bayesian inference of the parameters of the Starobinsky or Higgs inflationary model with non-instantaneous reheating using the Markov chain Monte Carlo method. For the analysis, we use observational data on the cosmic microwave background collected by the Planck and ACT collaborations and on baryonic acoustic oscillations from the DESI collaboration. The reheating stage is modelled by a single parameter $R_{\rm reh}$. Using the modified Boltzmann code CLASS and the cobaya software with the GetDist package, we perform a direct inference of the model parameter space and obtain their posterior distributions. Using the Kullback--Leibler divergence, we estimate the information gain from the data, yielding $2.52$ bits for the reheating parameter. Inclusion of the ACT DR6 data provides $75\%$ more information about the reheating stage compared to analysis without ACT data. We draw constraints on the reheating temperature and the average equation of state. While the former can vary within $10$ orders of magnitude, values in the $95\,\%$ credible interval indicate a sufficiently low reheating temperature; for the latter there is a clear preference for values greater than $0.5$, which means that the conventional equations of state for dust $\omega=0$ and relativistic matter $\omega=1/3$ are excluded with more than $2\sigma$ level of significance. However, there still is a big part of parameter space where Starobinsky and Higgs inflationary models exhibit a high degree of consistency with the latest observational data, particularly from ACT DR6. Therefore, it is premature to reject these models.

### Poster: Machine Learning for Vulnerability Detection as Target Oracle in   Automated Fuzz Driver Generation
**Authors**: Gianpietro Castiglione, Marcello Maugeri, Giampaolo Bella

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T09:02:36Z

**Summary**: In vulnerability detection, machine learning has been used as an effective static analysis technique, although it suffers from a significant rate of false positives. Contextually, in vulnerability discovery, fuzzing has been used as an effective dynamic analysis technique, although it requires manually writing fuzz drivers. Fuzz drivers usually target a limited subset of functions in a library that must be chosen according to certain criteria, e.g., the depth of a function, the number of paths. These criteria are verified by components called target oracles. In this work, we propose an automated fuzz driver generation workflow composed of: (1) identifying a likely vulnerable function by leveraging a machine learning for vulnerability detection model as a target oracle, (2) automatically generating fuzz drivers, (3) fuzzing the target function to find bugs which could confirm the vulnerability inferred by the target oracle. We show our method on an existing vulnerability in libgd, with a plan for large-scale evaluation.

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in In-Context Learning (ICL). However, the fixed position length constraints in pre-trained models limit the number of demonstration examples. Recent efforts to extend context suffer from attention dispersion as the number of demonstrations increases. In this paper, we introduce Mitigating Attention Dispersion in large-scale ICL (MateICL) that enables LLMs to maintain effective self-attention as the context size grows. We first split the context into multiple windows, each filled to the model's context capacity, which are processed separately. Then, we introduce an additional layer to recalibrate the attention weights, prioritizing the query tokens as the number of demonstrations increases. Our empirical results show that MateICL can effectively leverage larger contexts to improve ICL performance. Compared to retrieval-based baselines, MateICL consistently achieves better performance without requiring an externally trained retrieval model. Despite recent advances in inference strategies (e.g., 32k token contexts), our results demonstrate that MateICL remains beneficial in computationally resource-constrained settings. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/amurtadha/MateICL.

### VSC: Visual Search Compositional Text-to-Image Diffusion Model
**Authors**: Do Huu Dat, Nam Hyeonu, Po-Yuan Mao, Tae-Hyun Oh

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T08:31:43Z

**Summary**: Text-to-image diffusion models have shown impressive capabilities in generating realistic visuals from natural-language prompts, yet they often struggle with accurately binding attributes to corresponding objects, especially in prompts containing multiple attribute-object pairs. This challenge primarily arises from the limitations of commonly used text encoders, such as CLIP, which can fail to encode complex linguistic relationships and modifiers effectively. Existing approaches have attempted to mitigate these issues through attention map control during inference and the use of layout information or fine-tuning during training, yet they face performance drops with increased prompt complexity. In this work, we introduce a novel compositional generation method that leverages pairwise image embeddings to improve attribute-object binding. Our approach decomposes complex prompts into sub-prompts, generates corresponding images, and computes visual prototypes that fuse with text embeddings to enhance representation. By applying segmentation-based localization training, we address cross-attention misalignment, achieving improved accuracy in binding multiple attributes to objects. Our approaches outperform existing compositional text-to-image diffusion models on the benchmark T2I CompBench, achieving better image quality, evaluated by humans, and emerging robustness under scaling number of binding pairs in the prompt.

### Cluster-robust jackknife and bootstrap inference for logistic regression   models
**Authors**: James G. MacKinnon, Morten Ørregaard Nielsen, Matthew D. Webb

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T08:21:36Z

**Summary**: We study cluster-robust inference for logistic regression (logit) models. Inference based on the most commonly-used cluster-robust variance matrix estimator (CRVE) can be very unreliable. We study several alternatives. Conceptually the simplest of these, but also the most computationally demanding, involves jackknifing at the cluster level. We also propose a linearized version of the cluster-jackknife variance matrix estimator as well as linearized versions of the wild cluster bootstrap. The linearizations are based on empirical scores and are computationally efficient. Our results can readily be generalized to other binary response models. We also discuss a new Stata software package called logitjack which implements these procedures. Simulation results strongly favor the new methods, and two empirical examples suggest that it can be important to use them in practice.

### MADIL: An MDL-based Framework for Efficient Program Synthesis in the ARC   Benchmark
**Authors**: Sébastien Ferré

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T07:39:08Z

**Summary**: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has achieved remarkable success in specialized tasks but struggles with efficient skill acquisition and generalization. The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) benchmark evaluates intelligence based on minimal training requirements. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently improved ARC performance, they rely on extensive pre-training and high computational costs. We introduce MADIL (MDL-based AI), a novel approach leveraging the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle for efficient inductive learning. MADIL performs pattern-based decomposition, enabling structured generalization. While its performance (7% at ArcPrize 2024) remains below LLM-based methods, it offers greater efficiency and interpretability. This paper details MADIL's methodology, its application to ARC, and experimental evaluations.

### Zero-Shot Document-Level Biomedical Relation Extraction via   Scenario-based Prompt Design in Two-Stage with LLM
**Authors**: Lei Zhao, Ling Kang, Quan Guo

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T07:33:20Z

**Summary**: With the advent of artificial intelligence (AI), many researchers are attempting to extract structured information from document-level biomedical literature by fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). However, they face significant challenges such as the need for expensive hardware, like high-performance GPUs and the high labor costs associated with annotating training datasets, especially in biomedical realm. Recent research on LLMs, such as GPT-4 and Llama3, has shown promising performance in zero-shot settings, inspiring us to explore a novel approach to achieve the same results from unannotated full documents using general LLMs with lower hardware and labor costs. Our approach combines two major stages: named entity recognition (NER) and relation extraction (RE). NER identifies chemical, disease and gene entities from the document with synonym and hypernym extraction using an LLM with a crafted prompt. RE extracts relations between entities based on predefined relation schemas and prompts. To enhance the effectiveness of prompt, we propose a five-part template structure and a scenario-based prompt design principles, along with evaluation method to systematically assess the prompts. Finally, we evaluated our approach against fine-tuning and pre-trained models on two biomedical datasets: ChemDisGene and CDR. The experimental results indicate that our proposed method can achieve comparable accuracy levels to fine-tuning and pre-trained models but with reduced human and hardware expenses.

**Authors**: Jingwen Tong, Wei Guo, Jiawei Shao, Qiong Wu, Zijian Li, Zehong Lin, Jun Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T07:29:19Z

**Summary**: The rapid evolution of wireless networks presents unprecedented challenges in managing complex and dynamic systems. Existing methods are increasingly facing fundamental limitations in addressing these challenges. In this paper, we introduce WirelessAgent, a novel framework that harnesses large language models (LLMs) to create autonomous AI agents for diverse wireless network tasks. This framework integrates four core modules that mirror human cognitive processes: perception, memory, planning, and action. To implement it, we provide a basic usage based on agentic workflows and the LangGraph architecture. We demonstrate the effectiveness of WirelessAgent through a comprehensive case study on network slicing. The numerical results show that WirelessAgent achieves $44.4\%$ higher bandwidth utilization than the \emph{Prompt-based} method, while performing only $4.3\%$ below the \emph{Rule-based optimality}. Notably, WirelessAgent delivers near-optimal network throughput across diverse network scenarios. These underscore the framework's potential for intelligent and autonomous resource management in future wireless networks. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/jwentong/WirelessAgent_R1}.

### Retrieval Augmented Learning: A Retrial-based Large Language Model   Self-Supervised Learning and Autonomous Knowledge Generation
**Authors**: Zongyuan Li, Pengfei Li, Runnan Qi, Yanan Ni, Lumin Jiang, Hui Wu, Xuebo Zhang, Kuihua Huang, Xian Guo

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T07:25:01Z

**Summary**: The lack of domain-specific data in the pre-training of Large Language Models (LLMs) severely limits LLM-based decision systems in specialized applications, while post-training a model in the scenarios requires significant computational resources. In this paper, we present Retrial-Augmented Learning (RAL), a reward-free self-supervised learning framework for LLMs that operates without model training. By developing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) into a module for organizing intermediate data, we realized a three-stage autonomous knowledge generation of proposing a hypothesis, validating the hypothesis, and generating the knowledge. The method is evaluated in the LLM-PySC2 environment, a representative decision-making platform that combines sufficient complexity with domain-specific knowledge requirements. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method effectively reduces hallucination by generating and utilizing validated knowledge, and increases decision-making performance at an extremely low cost. Meanwhile, the approach exhibits potential in out-of-distribution(OOD) tasks, robustness, and transferability, making it a cost-friendly but effective solution for decision-making problems and autonomous knowledge generation.

### LLM-PySC2: Starcraft II learning environment for Large Language Models
**Authors**: Zongyuan Li, Yanan Ni, Runnan Qi, Lumin Jiang, Chang Lu, Xiaojie Xu, Xiangbei Liu, Pengfei Li, Yunzheng Guo, Zhe Ma, Huanyu Li, Hui Wu, Xian Guo, Kuihua Huang, Xuebo Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T07:20:36Z

**Summary**: The tremendous potential has been demonstrated by large language models (LLMs) in intelligent decision-making problems, with unprecedented capabilities shown across diverse applications ranging from gaming AI systems to complex strategic planning frameworks. However, the StarCraft II platform, which has been widely adopted for validating decision-making algorithms in the past decade, has not yet provided substantial support for this emerging domain. To address issues that LLMs cannot interface with the hundreds of actions of the pysc2 backend and the lack of native support for multi-agent (MA) collaboration, we propose the LLM-PySC2 environment. This is the first environment that offers LLMs the complete pysc2 action space with sufficient multi-modal information and game Wiki knowledge. With an asynchronous query architecture, the environment efficiently interacts with LLMs that maintain a constant latency regardless of the scale of the agents' population. In the experiments, we evaluated LLMs' decision-making performance in both the macro-decision and micro-operation scenarios, with traditional StarCraft II Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC) tasks and a series of new proposed. Results indicate that LLMs possess the potential to achieve victories in complex scenarios but cannot constantly generate correct decisions, especially in the recovered pysc2 action space and MA settings. Without task-relevant instructions, the pre-trained models suffer from issues such as hallucinations and inefficient collaboration. Our findings suggest that StarCraft II still challenges in the era of large models, revealing that there is a lot to do to develop an advanced LLM decision-making system, and the proposed LLM-PySC2 environment will support future development of LLM-based decision-making solutions.

**Authors**: Ziqi Ding, Qian Fu, Junchen Ding, Gelei Deng, Yi Liu, Yuekang Li

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T07:16:20Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have spurred the development of diverse AI applications from code generation and video editing to text generation; however, AI supply chains such as Hugging Face, which host pretrained models and their associated configuration files contributed by the public, face significant security challenges; in particular, configuration files originally intended to set up models by specifying parameters and initial settings can be exploited to execute unauthorized code, yet research has largely overlooked their security compared to that of the models themselves; in this work, we present the first comprehensive study of malicious configurations on Hugging Face, identifying three attack scenarios (file, website, and repository operations) that expose inherent risks; to address these threats, we introduce CONFIGSCAN, an LLM-based tool that analyzes configuration files in the context of their associated runtime code and critical libraries, effectively detecting suspicious elements with low false positive rates and high accuracy; our extensive evaluation uncovers thousands of suspicious repositories and configuration files, underscoring the urgent need for enhanced security validation in AI model hosting platforms.

### Good News for Script Kiddies? Evaluating Large Language Models for   Automated Exploit Generation
**Authors**: David Jin, Qian Fu, Yuekang Li

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T07:15:22Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in code-related tasks, raising concerns about their potential for automated exploit generation (AEG). This paper presents the first systematic study on LLMs' effectiveness in AEG, evaluating both their cooperativeness and technical proficiency. To mitigate dataset bias, we introduce a benchmark with refactored versions of five software security labs. Additionally, we design an LLM-based attacker to systematically prompt LLMs for exploit generation. Our experiments reveal that GPT-4 and GPT-4o exhibit high cooperativeness, comparable to uncensored models, while Llama3 is the most resistant. However, no model successfully generates exploits for refactored labs, though GPT-4o's minimal errors highlight the potential for LLM-driven AEG advancements.

### Efficient Vocabulary-Free Fine-Grained Visual Recognition in the Age of   Multimodal LLMs
**Authors**: Hari Chandana Kuchibhotla, Sai Srinivas Kancheti, Abbavaram Gowtham Reddy, Vineeth N Balasubramanian

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T07:14:58Z

**Summary**: Fine-grained Visual Recognition (FGVR) involves distinguishing between visually similar categories, which is inherently challenging due to subtle inter-class differences and the need for large, expert-annotated datasets. In domains like medical imaging, such curated datasets are unavailable due to issues like privacy concerns and high annotation costs. In such scenarios lacking labeled data, an FGVR model cannot rely on a predefined set of training labels, and hence has an unconstrained output space for predictions. We refer to this task as Vocabulary-Free FGVR (VF-FGVR), where a model must predict labels from an unconstrained output space without prior label information. While recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show potential for VF-FGVR, querying these models for each test input is impractical because of high costs and prohibitive inference times. To address these limitations, we introduce \textbf{Nea}rest-Neighbor Label \textbf{R}efinement (NeaR), a novel approach that fine-tunes a downstream CLIP model using labels generated by an MLLM. Our approach constructs a weakly supervised dataset from a small, unlabeled training set, leveraging MLLMs for label generation. NeaR is designed to handle the noise, stochasticity, and open-endedness inherent in labels generated by MLLMs, and establishes a new benchmark for efficient VF-FGVR.

### On dimension reduction in conditional dependence models
**Authors**: Thomas Nagler, Gerda Claeskens, Irène Gijbels

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T06:52:50Z

**Summary**: Inference of the conditional dependence structure is challenging when many covariates are present. In numerous applications, only a low-dimensional projection of the covariates influences the conditional distribution. The smallest subspace that captures this effect is called the central subspace in the literature. We show that inference of the central subspace of a vector random variable $\mathbf Y$ conditioned on a vector of covariates $\mathbf X$ can be separated into inference of the marginal central subspaces of the components of $\mathbf Y$ conditioned on $\mathbf X$ and on the copula central subspace, that we define in this paper. Further discussion addresses sufficient dimension reduction subspaces for conditional association measures. An adaptive nonparametric method is introduced for estimating the central dependence subspaces, achieving parametric convergence rates under mild conditions. Simulation studies illustrate the practical performance of the proposed approach.

### Prompt Inversion Attack against Collaborative Inference of Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Wenjie Qu, Yuguang Zhou, Yongji Wu, Tingsong Xiao, Binhang Yuan, Yiming Li, Jiaheng Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T06:50:37Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely applied for their remarkable capability of content generation. However, the practical use of open-source LLMs is hindered by high resource requirements, making deployment expensive and limiting widespread development. The collaborative inference is a promising solution for this problem, in which users collaborate by each hosting a subset of layers and transmitting intermediate activation. Many companies are building collaborative inference platforms to reduce LLM serving costs, leveraging users' underutilized GPUs. Despite widespread interest in collaborative inference within academia and industry, the privacy risks associated with LLM collaborative inference have not been well studied. This is largely because of the challenge posed by inverting LLM activation due to its strong non-linearity.   In this paper, to validate the severity of privacy threats in LLM collaborative inference, we introduce the concept of prompt inversion attack (PIA), where a malicious participant intends to recover the input prompt through the activation transmitted by its previous participant. Extensive experiments show that our PIA method substantially outperforms existing baselines. For example, our method achieves an 88.4\% token accuracy on the Skytrax dataset with the Llama-65B model when inverting the maximum number of transformer layers, while the best baseline method only achieves 22.8\% accuracy. The results verify the effectiveness of our PIA attack and highlights its practical threat to LLM collaborative inference systems.

### Transforming physics-informed machine learning to convex optimization
**Authors**: Letian Yi, Siyuan Yang, Ying Cui, Zhilu Lai

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T06:43:09Z

**Summary**: Physics-Informed Machine Learning (PIML) offers a powerful paradigm of integrating data with physical laws to address important scientific problems, such as parameter estimation, inferring hidden physics, equation discovery, and state prediction, etc. However, PIML still faces many serious optimization challenges that significantly restrict its applications. In this study, we propose a comprehensive framework that transforms PIML to convex optimization to overcome all these limitations, referred to as Convex-PIML. The linear combination of B-splines is utilized to approximate the data, promoting the convexity of the loss function. By replacing the non-convex components of the loss function with convex approximations, the problem is further converted into a sequence of successively refined approximated convex optimization problems. This conversion allows the use of well-established convex optimization algorithms, obtaining solutions effectively and efficiently. Furthermore, an adaptive knot optimization method based on error estimate is introduced to mitigate the spectral bias issue of PIML, further improving the performance. The proposed theoretically guaranteed framework is tested in scenarios with distinct types of physical prior. The results indicate that optimization problems are effectively solved in these scenarios, highlighting the potential of the framework for broad applications.

### Low-Precision Training of Large Language Models: Methods, Challenges,   and Opportunities
**Authors**: Zhiwei Hao, Jianyuan Guo, Li Shen, Yong Luo, Han Hu, Guoxia Wang, Dianhai Yu, Yonggang Wen, Dacheng Tao

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T06:33:25Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across various domains. However, the substantial hardware resources required for their training present a significant barrier to efficiency and scalability. To mitigate this challenge, low-precision training techniques have been widely adopted, leading to notable advancements in training efficiency. Despite these gains, low-precision training involves several components$\unicode{x2013}$such as weights, activations, and gradients$\unicode{x2013}$each of which can be represented in different numerical formats. The resulting diversity has created a fragmented landscape in low-precision training research, making it difficult for researchers to gain a unified overview of the field. This survey provides a comprehensive review of existing low-precision training methods. To systematically organize these approaches, we categorize them into three primary groups based on their underlying numerical formats, which is a key factor influencing hardware compatibility, computational efficiency, and ease of reference for readers. The categories are: (1) fixed-point and integer-based methods, (2) floating-point-based methods, and (3) customized format-based methods. Additionally, we discuss quantization-aware training approaches, which share key similarities with low-precision training during forward propagation. Finally, we highlight several promising research directions to advance this field. A collection of papers discussed in this survey is provided in https://github.com/Hao840/Awesome-Low-Precision-Training.

### Do We Need a Detailed Rubric for Automated Essay Scoring using Large   Language Models?
**Authors**: Lui Yoshida

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T06:17:51Z

**Summary**: This study investigates the necessity and impact of a detailed rubric in automated essay scoring (AES) using large language models (LLMs). While using rubrics are standard in LLM-based AES, creating detailed rubrics requires substantial ef-fort and increases token usage. We examined how different levels of rubric detail affect scoring accuracy across multiple LLMs using the TOEFL11 dataset. Our experiments compared three conditions: a full rubric, a simplified rubric, and no rubric, using four different LLMs (Claude 3.5 Haiku, Gemini 1.5 Flash, GPT-4o-mini, and Llama 3 70B Instruct). Results showed that three out of four models maintained similar scoring accuracy with the simplified rubric compared to the detailed one, while significantly reducing token usage. However, one model (Gemini 1.5 Flash) showed decreased performance with more detailed rubrics. The findings suggest that simplified rubrics may be sufficient for most LLM-based AES applications, offering a more efficient alternative without compromis-ing scoring accuracy. However, model-specific evaluation remains crucial as per-formance patterns vary across different LLMs.

### Recursive Algorithms for Sparse Parameter Identification of Multivariate   Stochastic Systems with Non-stationary Observations
**Authors**: Yanxin Fu, Wenxiao Zhao

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T06:14:29Z

**Summary**: The classical sparse parameter identification methods are usually based on the iterative basis selection such as greedy algorithms, or the numerical optimization of regularized cost functions such as LASSO and Bayesian posterior probability distribution, etc., which, however, are not suitable for online sparsity inference when data arrive sequentially. This paper presents recursive algorithms for sparse parameter identification of multivariate stochastic systems with non-stationary observations. First, a new bivariate criterion function is presented by introducing an auxiliary variable matrix into a weighted $L_1$ regularization criterion. The new criterion function is subsequently decomposed into two solvable subproblems via alternating optimization of the two variable matrices, for which the optimizers can be explicitly formulated into recursive equations. Second, under the non-stationary and non-persistent excitation conditions on the systems, theoretical properties of the recursive algorithms are established. That is, the estimates are proved to be with (i) set convergence, i.e., the accurate estimation of the sparse index set of the unknown parameter matrix, and (ii) parameter convergence, i.e., the consistent estimation for values of the non-zero elements of the unknown parameter matrix. Finally, numerical examples are given to support the theoretical analysis.

### Quantum Simulations Based on Parameterized Circuit of an Antisymmetric   Matrix
**Authors**: Ammar Daskin

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T05:40:34Z

**Summary**: Given an antisymmetric matrix $A$ or the unitary matrix $U_A = e^A$-or an oracle whose answers can be used to infer information about $A$-in this paper we present a parameterized circuit framework that can be used to approximate a quantum circuit for $e^A$. We design the circuit based on a uniform antisymmetric matrix with $\{\pm 1\}$ elements, which has an eigenbasis that is a phase-shifted version of the quantum Fourier transform, and its eigenspectrum can be constructed by using rotation $Z$ gates. Therefore, we show that it can be used to directly estimate $e^A$ and its quantum circuit representation. Since the circuit is based on $O(n^2)$ quantum gates, which form the eigendecomposition of $e^A$ with separate building blocks, it can also be used to approximate the eigenvalues of $A$.

### ICLR: In-Context Learning of Representations
**Authors**: Core Francisco Park, Andrew Lee, Ekdeep Singh Lubana, Yongyi Yang, Maya Okawa, Kento Nishi, Martin Wattenberg, Hidenori Tanaka

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T05:27:38Z

**Summary**: Recent work has demonstrated that semantics specified by pretraining data influence how representations of different concepts are organized in a large language model (LLM). However, given the open-ended nature of LLMs, e.g., their ability to in-context learn, we can ask whether models alter these pretraining semantics to adopt alternative, context-specified ones. Specifically, if we provide in-context exemplars wherein a concept plays a different role than what the pretraining data suggests, do models reorganize their representations in accordance with these novel semantics? To answer this question, we take inspiration from the theory of conceptual role semantics and define a toy "graph tracing" task wherein the nodes of the graph are referenced via concepts seen during training (e.g., apple, bird, etc.) and the connectivity of the graph is defined via some predefined structure (e.g., a square grid). Given exemplars that indicate traces of random walks on the graph, we analyze intermediate representations of the model and find that as the amount of context is scaled, there is a sudden re-organization from pretrained semantic representations to in-context representations aligned with the graph structure. Further, we find that when reference concepts have correlations in their semantics (e.g., Monday, Tuesday, etc.), the context-specified graph structure is still present in the representations, but is unable to dominate the pretrained structure. To explain these results, we analogize our task to energy minimization for a predefined graph topology, providing evidence towards an implicit optimization process to infer context-specified semantics. Overall, our findings indicate scaling context-size can flexibly re-organize model representations, possibly unlocking novel capabilities.

### Value Portrait: Understanding Values of LLMs with Human-aligned   Benchmark
**Authors**: Jongwook Han, Dongmin Choi, Woojung Song, Eun-Ju Lee, Yohan Jo

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T05:26:50Z

**Summary**: The importance of benchmarks for assessing the values of language models has been pronounced due to the growing need of more authentic, human-aligned responses. However, existing benchmarks rely on human or machine annotations that are vulnerable to value-related biases. Furthermore, the tested scenarios often diverge from real-world contexts in which models are commonly used to generate text and express values. To address these issues, we propose the Value Portrait benchmark, a reliable framework for evaluating LLMs' value orientations with two key characteristics. First, the benchmark consists of items that capture real-life user-LLM interactions, enhancing the relevance of assessment results to real-world LLM usage and thus ecological validity. Second, each item is rated by human subjects based on its similarity to their own thoughts, and correlations between these ratings and the subjects' actual value scores are derived. This psychometrically validated approach ensures that items strongly correlated with specific values serve as reliable items for assessing those values. Through evaluating 27 LLMs with our benchmark, we find that these models prioritize Benevolence, Security, and Self-Direction values while placing less emphasis on Tradition, Power, and Achievement values. Also, our analysis reveals biases in how LLMs perceive various demographic groups, deviating from real human data.

### Competition Dynamics Shape Algorithmic Phases of In-Context Learning
**Authors**: Core Francisco Park, Ekdeep Singh Lubana, Itamar Pres, Hidenori Tanaka

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T05:25:53Z

**Summary**: In-Context Learning (ICL) has significantly expanded the general-purpose nature of large language models, allowing them to adapt to novel tasks using merely the inputted context. This has motivated a series of papers that analyze tractable synthetic domains and postulate precise mechanisms that may underlie ICL. However, the use of relatively distinct setups that often lack a sequence modeling nature to them makes it unclear how general the reported insights from such studies are. Motivated by this, we propose a synthetic sequence modeling task that involves learning to simulate a finite mixture of Markov chains. As we show, models trained on this task reproduce most well-known results on ICL, hence offering a unified setting for studying the concept. Building on this setup, we demonstrate we can explain a model's behavior by decomposing it into four broad algorithms that combine a fuzzy retrieval vs. inference approach with either unigram or bigram statistics of the context. These algorithms engage in a competition dynamics to dominate model behavior, with the precise experimental conditions dictating which algorithm ends up superseding others: e.g., we find merely varying context size or amount of training yields (at times sharp) transitions between which algorithm dictates the model behavior, revealing a mechanism that explains the transient nature of ICL. In this sense, we argue ICL is best thought of as a mixture of different algorithms, each with its own peculiarities, instead of a monolithic capability. This also implies that making general claims about ICL that hold universally across all settings may be infeasible.

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T05:16:17Z

**Summary**: Planning is essential for artificial intelligence systems to look ahead and proactively determine a course of actions to reach objectives in the virtual and real world. Recent work on large language models (LLMs) sheds light on their planning capability in various tasks. However, it remains unclear what signals in the context influence the model performance. In this work, we explore how to improve the model planning capability through in-context learning (ICL), specifically, what signals can help select the exemplars. Through extensive experiments, we observe that commonly used problem similarity may result in false positives with drastically different plans, which can mislead the model. In response, we propose to sample and filter exemplars leveraging plan side action sequence similarity (AS). We propose GRASE-DC: a two-stage pipeline that first re-samples high AS exemplars and then curates the selected exemplars with dynamic clustering on AS to achieve a balance of relevance and diversity. Our experimental result confirms that GRASE-DC achieves significant performance improvement on various planning tasks (up to ~11-40 point absolute accuracy improvement with 27.3% fewer exemplars needed on average). With GRASE-DC* + VAL, where we iteratively apply GRASE-DC with a validator, we are able to even boost the performance by 18.9% more.   Extensive analysis validates the consistent performance improvement of GRASE-DC with various backbone LLMs and on both classical planning and natural language planning benchmarks. GRASE-DC can further boost the planning accuracy by ~24 absolute points on harder problems using simpler problems as exemplars over a random baseline. This demonstrates its ability to generalize to out-of-distribution problems.

### Rethinking Scientific Summarization Evaluation: Grounding Explainable   Metrics on Facet-aware Benchmark
**Authors**: Xiuying Chen, Tairan Wang, Qingqing Zhu, Taicheng Guo, Shen Gao, Zhiyong Lu, Xin Gao, Xiangliang Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T05:08:48Z

**Summary**: The summarization capabilities of pretrained and large language models (LLMs) have been widely validated in general areas, but their use in scientific corpus, which involves complex sentences and specialized knowledge, has been less assessed. This paper presents conceptual and experimental analyses of scientific summarization, highlighting the inadequacies of traditional evaluation methods, such as $n$-gram, embedding comparison, and QA, particularly in providing explanations, grasping scientific concepts, or identifying key content. Subsequently, we introduce the Facet-aware Metric (FM), employing LLMs for advanced semantic matching to evaluate summaries based on different aspects. This facet-aware approach offers a thorough evaluation of abstracts by decomposing the evaluation task into simpler subtasks.Recognizing the absence of an evaluation benchmark in this domain, we curate a Facet-based scientific summarization Dataset (FD) with facet-level annotations. Our findings confirm that FM offers a more logical approach to evaluating scientific summaries. In addition, fine-tuned smaller models can compete with LLMs in scientific contexts, while LLMs have limitations in learning from in-context information in scientific domains. This suggests an area for future enhancement of LLMs.

### VTS-LLM: Domain-Adaptive LLM Agent for Enhancing Awareness in Vessel   Traffic Services through Natural Language
**Authors**: Sijin Sun, Liangbin Zhao, Ming Deng, Xiuju Fu

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T04:27:50Z

**Summary**: Vessel Traffic Services (VTS) are essential for maritime safety and regulatory compliance through real-time traffic management. However, with increasing traffic complexity and the prevalence of heterogeneous, multimodal data, existing VTS systems face limitations in spatiotemporal reasoning and intuitive human interaction. In this work, we propose VTS-LLM Agent, the first domain-adaptive large LLM agent tailored for interactive decision support in VTS operations. We formalize risk-prone vessel identification as a knowledge-augmented Text-to-SQL task, combining structured vessel databases with external maritime knowledge. To support this, we construct a curated benchmark dataset consisting of a custom schema, domain-specific corpus, and a query-SQL test set in multiple linguistic styles. Our framework incorporates NER-based relational reasoning, agent-based domain knowledge injection, semantic algebra intermediate representation, and query rethink mechanisms to enhance domain grounding and context-aware understanding. Experimental results show that VTS-LLM outperforms both general-purpose and SQL-focused baselines under command-style, operational-style, and formal natural language queries, respectively. Moreover, our analysis provides the first empirical evidence that linguistic style variation introduces systematic performance challenges in Text-to-SQL modeling. This work lays the foundation for natural language interfaces in vessel traffic services and opens new opportunities for proactive, LLM-driven maritime real-time traffic management.

### Towards Flow-Matching-based TTS without Classifier-Free Guidance
**Authors**: Yuzhe Liang, Wenzhe Liu, Chunyu Qiang, Zhikang Niu, Yushen Chen, Ziyang Ma, Wenxi Chen, Nan Li, Chen Zhang, Xie Chen

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T04:16:24Z

**Summary**: Flow matching has demonstrated strong generative capabilities and has become a core component in modern Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems. To ensure high-quality speech synthesis, Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) is widely used during the inference of flow-matching-based TTS models. However, CFG incurs substantial computational cost as it requires two forward passes, which hinders its applicability in real-time scenarios. In this paper, we explore removing CFG from flow-matching-based TTS models to improve inference efficiency, while maintaining performance. Specifically, we reformulated the flow matching training target to directly approximate the CFG optimization trajectory. This training method eliminates the need for unconditional model evaluation and guided tuning during inference, effectively cutting the computational overhead in half. Furthermore, It can be seamlessly integrated with existing optimized sampling strategies. We validate our approach using the F5-TTS model on the LibriTTS dataset. Experimental results show that our method achieves a 9$\times$ inference speed-up compared to the baseline F5-TTS, while preserving comparable speech quality. We will release the code and models to support reproducibility and foster further research in this area.

### Position: Enough of Scaling LLMs! Lets Focus on Downscaling
**Authors**: Ayan Sengupta, Yash Goel, Tanmoy Chakraborty

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T04:13:27Z

**Summary**: We challenge the dominant focus on neural scaling laws and advocate for a paradigm shift toward downscaling in the development of large language models (LLMs). While scaling laws have provided critical insights into performance improvements through increasing model and dataset size, we emphasize the significant limitations of this approach, particularly in terms of computational inefficiency, environmental impact, and deployment constraints. To address these challenges, we propose a holistic framework for downscaling LLMs that seeks to maintain performance while drastically reducing resource demands. This paper outlines practical strategies for transitioning away from traditional scaling paradigms, advocating for a more sustainable, efficient, and accessible approach to LLM development.

### Multi-agents based User Values Mining for Recommendation
**Authors**: Lijian Chen, Wei Yuan, Tong Chen, Xiangyu Zhao, Nguyen Quoc Viet Hung, Hongzhi Yin

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T04:01:31Z

**Summary**: Recommender systems have rapidly evolved and become integral to many online services. However, existing systems sometimes produce unstable and unsatisfactory recommendations that fail to align with users' fundamental and long-term preferences. This is because they primarily focus on extracting shallow and short-term interests from user behavior data, which is inherently dynamic and challenging to model. Unlike these transient interests, user values are more stable and play a crucial role in shaping user behaviors, such as purchasing items and consuming content. Incorporating user values into recommender systems can help stabilize recommendation performance and ensure results better reflect users' latent preferences. However, acquiring user values is typically difficult and costly. To address this challenge, we leverage the strong language understanding, zero-shot inference, and generalization capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract user values from users' historical interactions. Unfortunately, direct extraction using LLMs presents several challenges such as length constraints and hallucination. To overcome these issues, we propose ZOOM, a zero-shot multi-LLM collaborative framework for effective and accurate user value extraction. In ZOOM, we apply text summarization techniques to condense item content while preserving essential meaning. To mitigate hallucinations, ZOOM introduces two specialized agent roles: evaluators and supervisors, to collaboratively generate accurate user values. Extensive experiments on two widely used recommendation datasets with two state-of-the-art recommendation models demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our framework in automatic user value mining and recommendation performance improvement.

### Synthesize-on-Graph: Knowledgeable Synthetic Data Generation for   Continue Pre-training of Large Language Models
**Authors**: Xuhui Jiang, Shengjie Ma, Chengjin Xu, Cehao Yang, Liyu Zhang, Jian Guo

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T03:40:39Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success but remain data-inefficient, especially when learning from small, specialized corpora with limited and proprietary data. Existing synthetic data generation methods for continue pre-training focus on intra-document content and overlook cross-document knowledge associations, limiting content diversity and depth. We propose Synthetic-on-Graph (SoG), a synthetic data generation framework that incorporates cross-document knowledge associations for efficient corpus expansion. SoG constructs a context graph by extracting entities and concepts from the original corpus, representing cross-document associations, and employing a graph walk strategy for knowledge-associated sampling. This enhances synthetic data diversity and coherence, enabling models to learn complex knowledge structures and handle rare knowledge. To further improve synthetic data quality, we integrate Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Contrastive Clarifying (CC) synthetic, enhancing reasoning processes and discriminative power. Experiments show that SoG outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) method in a multi-hop document Q&A dataset while performing comparably to the SOTA method on the reading comprehension task datasets, which also underscores the better generalization capability of SoG. Our work advances synthetic data generation and provides practical solutions for efficient knowledge acquisition in LLMs, especially in domains with limited data availability.

**Authors**: Zhiyu Liao, Kang Chen, Yuanguo Lin, Kangkang Li, Yunxuan Liu, Hefeng Chen, Xingwang Huang, Yuanhui Yu

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T03:37:52Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become central to numerous natural language processing tasks, but their vulnerabilities present significant security and ethical challenges. This systematic survey explores the evolving landscape of attack and defense techniques in LLMs. We classify attacks into adversarial prompt attack, optimized attacks, model theft, as well as attacks on application of LLMs, detailing their mechanisms and implications. Consequently, we analyze defense strategies, including prevention-based and detection-based defense methods. Although advances have been made, challenges remain to adapt to the dynamic threat landscape, balance usability with robustness, and address resource constraints in defense implementation. We highlight open problems, including the need for adaptive scalable defenses, explainable security techniques, and standardized evaluation frameworks. This survey provides actionable insights and directions for developing secure and resilient LLMs, emphasizing the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration and ethical considerations to mitigate risks in real-world applications.

### Generating Animated Layouts as Structured Text Representations
**Authors**: Yeonsang Shin, Jihwan Kim, Yumin Song, Kyungseung Lee, Hyunhee Chung, Taeyoung Na

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T03:37:09Z

**Summary**: Despite the remarkable progress in text-to-video models, achieving precise control over text elements and animated graphics remains a significant challenge, especially in applications such as video advertisements. To address this limitation, we introduce Animated Layout Generation, a novel approach to extend static graphic layouts with temporal dynamics. We propose a Structured Text Representation for fine-grained video control through hierarchical visual elements. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we present VAKER (Video Ad maKER), a text-to-video advertisement generation pipeline that combines a three-stage generation process with Unstructured Text Reasoning for seamless integration with LLMs. VAKER fully automates video advertisement generation by incorporating dynamic layout trajectories for objects and graphics across specific video frames. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that VAKER significantly outperforms existing methods in generating video advertisements. Project Page: https://yeonsangshin.github.io/projects/Vaker

### Seeking to Collide: Online Safety-Critical Scenario Generation for   Autonomous Driving with Retrieval Augmented Large Language Models
**Authors**: Yuewen Mei, Tong Nie, Jian Sun, Ye Tian

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T03:22:00Z

**Summary**: Simulation-based testing is crucial for validating autonomous vehicles (AVs), yet existing scenario generation methods either overfit to common driving patterns or operate in an offline, non-interactive manner that fails to expose rare, safety-critical corner cases. In this paper, we introduce an online, retrieval-augmented large language model (LLM) framework for generating safety-critical driving scenarios. Our method first employs an LLM-based behavior analyzer to infer the most dangerous intent of the background vehicle from the observed state, then queries additional LLM agents to synthesize feasible adversarial trajectories. To mitigate catastrophic forgetting and accelerate adaptation, we augment the framework with a dynamic memorization and retrieval bank of intent-planner pairs, automatically expanding its behavioral library when novel intents arise. Evaluations using the Waymo Open Motion Dataset demonstrate that our model reduces the mean minimum time-to-collision from 1.62 to 1.08 s and incurs a 75% collision rate, substantially outperforming baselines.

**Authors**: Ziyuan Huang, Vishaldeep Kaur Sekhon, Roozbeh Sadeghian, Maria L. Vaida, Cynthia Jo, Doyle Ward, Vanni Bucci, John P. Haran

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T03:07:14Z

**Summary**: Alzheimer's Disease Analysis Model (ADAM) is a multi-agent reasoning large language model (LLM) framework designed to integrate and analyze multimodal data, including microbiome profiles, clinical datasets, and external knowledge bases, to enhance the understanding and classification of Alzheimer's disease (AD). By leveraging the agentic system with LLM, ADAM produces insights from diverse data sources and contextualizes the findings with literature-driven evidence. A comparative evaluation with XGBoost revealed a significantly improved mean F1 score and significantly reduced variance for ADAM, highlighting its robustness and consistency, particularly when utilizing human biological data. Although currently tailored for binary classification tasks with two data modalities, future iterations will aim to incorporate additional data types, such as neuroimaging and peripheral biomarkers, and expand them to predict disease progression, thereby broadening ADAM's scalability and applicability in AD research and diagnostic applications.

### Sentiment and Social Signals in the Climate Crisis: A Survey on   Analyzing Social Media Responses to Extreme Weather Events
**Authors**: Pouya Shaeri, Yasaman Mohammadpour, Alimohammad Beigi, Ariane Middel, Huan Liu

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T02:39:09Z

**Summary**: Extreme weather events driven by climate change, such as wildfires, floods, and heatwaves, prompt significant public reactions on social media platforms. Analyzing the sentiment expressed in these online discussions can offer valuable insights into public perception, inform policy decisions, and enhance emergency responses. Although sentiment analysis has been widely studied in various fields, its specific application to climate-induced events, particularly in real-time, high-impact situations like the 2025 Los Angeles forest fires, remains underexplored. In this survey, we thoroughly examine the methods, datasets, challenges, and ethical considerations related to sentiment analysis of social media content concerning weather and climate change events. We present a detailed taxonomy of approaches, ranging from lexicon-based and machine learning models to the latest strategies driven by large language models (LLMs). Additionally, we discuss data collection and annotation techniques, including weak supervision and real-time event tracking. Finally, we highlight several open problems, such as misinformation detection, multimodal sentiment extraction, and model alignment with human values. Our goal is to guide researchers and practitioners in effectively understanding sentiment during the climate crisis era.

### Dynamics of Spontaneous Topic Changes in Next Token Prediction with   Self-Attention
**Authors**: Mumin Jia, Jairo Diaz-Rodriguez

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T02:25:37Z

**Summary**: Human cognition is punctuated by abrupt, spontaneous shifts between topics-driven by emotional, contextual, or associative cues-a phenomenon known as spontaneous thought in neuroscience. In contrast, self-attention based models depend on structured patterns over their inputs to predict each next token, lacking spontaneity. Motivated by this distinction, we characterize spontaneous topic changes in self-attention architectures, revealing both their similarities and their divergences from spontaneous human thought. First, we establish theoretical results under a simplified, single-layer self-attention model with suitable conditions by defining the topic as a set of Token Priority Graphs (TPGs). Specifically, we demonstrate that (1) the model maintains the priority order of tokens related to the input topic, (2) a spontaneous topic change can occur only if lower-priority tokens outnumber all higher-priority tokens of the input topic, and (3) unlike human cognition, the longer context length or the more ambiguous input topic reduces the likelihood of spontaneous change. Second, we empirically validate that these dynamics persist in modern, state-of-the-art LLMs, underscoring a fundamental disparity between human cognition and AI behaviour in the context of spontaneous topic changes. To the best of our knowledge, no prior work has explored these questions with a focus as closely aligned to human thought.

### Extended Persistent Homology Distinguishes Simple and Complex Contagions   with High Accuracy
**Authors**: Vahid Shamsaddini, M. Amin Rahimian

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T02:21:31Z

**Summary**: The social contagion literature makes a distinction between simple (independent cascade or bond percolation processes that pass infections through edges) and complex contagions (bootstrap percolation or threshold processes that require local reinforcement to spread). However, distinguishing simple and complex contagions using observational data poses a significant challenge in practice. Estimating population-level activation functions from observed contagion dynamics is hindered by confounding factors that influence adoptions (other than neighborhood interactions), as well as heterogeneity in individual behaviors and modeling variations that make it difficult to design appropriate null models for inferring contagion types. Here, we show that a new tool from topological data analysis (TDA), called extended persistent homology (EPH), when applied to contagion processes over networks, can effectively detect simple and complex contagion processes, as well as predict their parameters. We train classification and regression models using EPH-based topological summaries computed on simulated simple and complex contagion dynamics on three real-world network datasets and obtain high predictive performance over a wide range of contagion parameters and under a variety of informational constraints, including uncertainty in model parameters, noise, and partial observability of contagion dynamics. EPH captures the role of cycles of varying lengths in the observed contagion dynamics and offers a useful metric to classify contagion models and predict their parameters. Analyzing geometrical features of network contagion using TDA tools such as EPH can find applications in other network problems such as seeding, vaccination, and quarantine optimization, as well as network inference and reconstruction problems.

### Preserving Privacy and Utility in LLM-Based Product Recommendations
**Authors**: Tina Khezresmaeilzadeh, Jiang Zhang, Dimitrios Andreadis, Konstantinos Psounis

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T01:54:08Z

**Summary**: Large Language Model (LLM)-based recommendation systems leverage powerful language models to generate personalized suggestions by processing user interactions and preferences. Unlike traditional recommendation systems that rely on structured data and collaborative filtering, LLM-based models process textual and contextual information, often using cloud-based infrastructure. This raises privacy concerns, as user data is transmitted to remote servers, increasing the risk of exposure and reducing control over personal information. To address this, we propose a hybrid privacy-preserving recommendation framework which separates sensitive from nonsensitive data and only shares the latter with the cloud to harness LLM-powered recommendations. To restore lost recommendations related to obfuscated sensitive data, we design a de-obfuscation module that reconstructs sensitive recommendations locally. Experiments on real-world e-commerce datasets show that our framework achieves almost the same recommendation utility with a system which shares all data with an LLM, while preserving privacy to a large extend. Compared to obfuscation-only techniques, our approach improves HR@10 scores and category distribution alignment, offering a better balance between privacy and recommendation quality. Furthermore, our method runs efficiently on consumer-grade hardware, making privacy-aware LLM-based recommendation systems practical for real-world use.

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T01:35:35Z

**Summary**: We introduce the Llama-Nemotron series of models, an open family of heterogeneous reasoning models that deliver exceptional reasoning capabilities, inference efficiency, and an open license for enterprise use. The family comes in three sizes -- Nano (8B), Super (49B), and Ultra (253B) -- and performs competitively with state-of-the-art reasoning models such as DeepSeek-R1 while offering superior inference throughput and memory efficiency. In this report, we discuss the training procedure for these models, which entails using neural architecture search from Llama 3 models for accelerated inference, knowledge distillation, and continued pretraining, followed by a reasoning-focused post-training stage consisting of two main parts: supervised fine-tuning and large scale reinforcement learning. Llama-Nemotron models are the first open-source models to support a dynamic reasoning toggle, allowing users to switch between standard chat and reasoning modes during inference. To further support open research and facilitate model development, we provide the following resources: 1. We release the Llama-Nemotron reasoning models -- LN-Nano, LN-Super, and LN-Ultra -- under the commercially permissive NVIDIA Open Model License Agreement. 2. We release the complete post-training dataset: Llama-Nemotron-Post-Training-Dataset. 3. We also release our training codebases: NeMo, NeMo-Aligner, and Megatron-LM.

### SSRLBot: Designing and Developing an LLM-based Agent using Socially   Shared Regulated Learning
**Authors**: Xiaoshan Huang, Jie Gao, Haolun Wu

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T01:17:03Z

**Summary**: Large language model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly used to support human experts by streamlining complex tasks and offering actionable insights. However, their application in multi-professional decision-making, particularly in teamwork contexts, remains underexplored. This design-based study addresses that gap by developing LLM functions to enhance collaboration, grounded in the Socially Shared Regulation of Learning (SSRL) framework and applied to medical diagnostic teamwork. SSRL emphasizes metacognitive, cognitive, motivational, and emotional processes in shared learning, focusing on how teams manage these processes to improve decision-making. This paper introduces SSRLBot, a prototype chatbot designed to help team members reflect on both their diagnostic performance and key SSRL skills. Its core functions include summarizing dialogues, analyzing SSRL behaviors, evaluating diagnostic outcomes, annotating SSRL markers in conversation, assessing their impact on performance, and identifying interpersonal regulatory dynamics. We compare SSRLBot's capabilities with those of Gemini-1.5, GPT-3.5, and Deepseek-R1 in a case study. SSRLBot demonstrates stronger alignment with SSRL theory, offering detailed evaluations that link behaviors to regulatory dimensions and suggesting improvements for collaboration. By integrating SSRL theory with LLM capabilities, SSRLBot contributes a novel tool for enhancing team-based decision-making and collaborative learning in high-stakes environments, such as medical education.

### Reward-Augmented Data Enhances Direct Preference Alignment of LLMs
**Authors**: Shenao Zhang, Zhihan Liu, Boyi Liu, Yufeng Zhang, Yingxiang Yang, Yongfei Liu, Liyu Chen, Tao Sun, Zhaoran Wang

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T01:10:28Z

**Summary**: Preference alignment in Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly improved their ability to adhere to human instructions and intentions. However, existing direct alignment algorithms primarily focus on relative preferences and often overlook the qualitative aspects of responses, despite having access to preference data that includes reward scores from judge models during AI feedback. Striving to maximize the implicit reward gap between the chosen and the slightly inferior rejected responses can cause overfitting and unnecessary unlearning of the high-quality rejected responses. The unawareness of the reward scores also drives the LLM to indiscriminately favor the low-quality chosen responses and fail to generalize to optimal responses that are sparse in data. To overcome these shortcomings, our study introduces reward-conditioned LLM policies that discern and learn from the entire spectrum of response quality within the dataset, helping extrapolate to more optimal regions. We propose an effective yet simple data relabeling method that conditions the preference pairs on quality scores to construct a reward-augmented dataset. The experiments across various benchmarks and diverse models demonstrate that our approach consistently boosts DPO by a considerable margin. Through comprehensive ablation studies, we demonstrate that our method not only maximizes the utility of preference data but also mitigates the issue of unlearning, demonstrating its broad effectiveness beyond mere data expansion. Our code is available at https://github.com/shenao-zhang/reward-augmented-preference.

### Agentic Feedback Loop Modeling Improves Recommendation and User   Simulation
**Authors**: Shihao Cai, Jizhi Zhang, Keqin Bao, Chongming Gao, Qifan Wang, Fuli Feng, Xiangnan He

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T00:50:50Z

**Summary**: Large language model-based agents are increasingly applied in the recommendation field due to their extensive knowledge and strong planning capabilities. While prior research has primarily focused on enhancing either the recommendation agent or the user agent individually, the collaborative interaction between the two has often been overlooked. Towards this research gap, we propose a novel framework that emphasizes the feedback loop process to facilitate the collaboration between the recommendation agent and the user agent. Specifically, the recommendation agent refines its understanding of user preferences by analyzing the feedback from the user agent on the item recommendation. Conversely, the user agent further identifies potential user interests based on the items and recommendation reasons provided by the recommendation agent. This iterative process enhances the ability of both agents to infer user behaviors, enabling more effective item recommendations and more accurate user simulations. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the agentic feedback loop: the agentic feedback loop yields an average improvement of 11.52% over the single recommendation agent and 21.12% over the single user agent. Furthermore, the results show that the agentic feedback loop does not exacerbate popularity or position bias, which are typically amplified by the real-world feedback loop, highlighting its robustness. The source code is available at https://github.com/Lanyu0303/AFL.

### Large Language Model-Driven Dynamic Assessment of Grammatical Accuracy   in English Language Learner Writing
**Authors**: Timur Jaganov, John Blake, Julián Villegas, Nicholas Carr

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T00:19:50Z

**Summary**: This study investigates the potential for Large Language Models (LLMs) to scale-up Dynamic Assessment (DA). To facilitate such an investigation, we first developed DynaWrite-a modular, microservices-based grammatical tutoring application which supports multiple LLMs to generate dynamic feedback to learners of English. Initial testing of 21 LLMs, revealed GPT-4o and neural chat to have the most potential to scale-up DA in the language learning classroom. Further testing of these two candidates found both models performed similarly in their ability to accurately identify grammatical errors in user sentences. However, GPT-4o consistently outperformed neural chat in the quality of its DA by generating clear, consistent, and progressively explicit hints. Real-time responsiveness and system stability were also confirmed through detailed performance testing, with GPT-4o exhibiting sufficient speed and stability. This study shows that LLMs can be used to scale-up dynamic assessment and thus enable dynamic assessment to be delivered to larger groups than possible in traditional teacher-learner settings.

### Robust Root Cause Diagnosis using In-Distribution Interventions
**Authors**: Lokesh Nagalapatti, Ashutosh Srivastava, Sunita Sarawagi, Amit Sharma

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T00:19:43Z

**Summary**: Diagnosing the root cause of an anomaly in a complex interconnected system is a pressing problem in today's cloud services and industrial operations. We propose In-Distribution Interventions (IDI), a novel algorithm that predicts root cause as nodes that meet two criteria: 1) **Anomaly:** root cause nodes should take on anomalous values; 2) **Fix:** had the root cause nodes assumed usual values, the target node would not have been anomalous. Prior methods of assessing the fix condition rely on counterfactuals inferred from a Structural Causal Model (SCM) trained on historical data. But since anomalies are rare and fall outside the training distribution, the fitted SCMs yield unreliable counterfactual estimates. IDI overcomes this by relying on interventional estimates obtained by solely probing the fitted SCM at in-distribution inputs. We present a theoretical analysis comparing and bounding the errors in assessing the fix condition using interventional and counterfactual estimates. We then conduct experiments by systematically varying the SCM's complexity to demonstrate the cases where IDI's interventional approach outperforms the counterfactual approach and vice versa. Experiments on both synthetic and PetShop RCD benchmark datasets demonstrate that \our\ consistently identifies true root causes more accurately and robustly than nine existing state-of-the-art RCD baselines. Code is released at https://github.com/nlokeshiisc/IDI_release.

### AutoPrep: Natural Language Question-Aware Data Preparation with a   Multi-Agent Framework
**Authors**: Meihao Fan, Ju Fan, Nan Tang, Lei Cao, Guoliang Li, Xiaoyong Du

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T00:11:48Z

**Summary**: Answering natural language (NL) questions about tables, known as Tabular Question Answering (TQA), is crucial because it allows users to quickly and efficiently extract meaningful insights from structured data, effectively bridging the gap between human language and machine-readable formats. Many of these tables are derived from web sources or real-world scenarios, which require meticulous data preparation (or data prep) to ensure accurate responses. However, preparing such tables for NL questions introduces new requirements that extend beyond traditional data preparation. This question-aware data preparation involves specific tasks such as column derivation and filtering tailored to particular questions, as well as question-aware value normalization or conversion, highlighting the need for a more nuanced approach in this context. Because each of the above tasks is unique, a single model (or agent) may not perform effectively across all scenarios. In this paper, we propose AutoPrep, a large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent framework that leverages the strengths of multiple agents, each specialized in a certain type of data prep, ensuring more accurate and contextually relevant responses. Given an NL question over a table, AutoPrep performs data prep through three key components. Planner: Determines a logical plan, outlining a sequence of high-level operations. Programmer: Translates this logical plan into a physical plan by generating the corresponding low-level code. Executor: Executes the generated code to process the table. To support this multi-agent framework, we design a novel Chain-of-Clauses reasoning mechanism for high-level operation suggestion, and a tool-augmented method for low-level code generation...

### How Transformers Learn Regular Language Recognition: A Theoretical Study   on Training Dynamics and Implicit Bias
**Authors**: Ruiquan Huang, Yingbin Liang, Jing Yang

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T00:07:35Z

**Summary**: Language recognition tasks are fundamental in natural language processing (NLP) and have been widely used to benchmark the performance of large language models (LLMs). These tasks also play a crucial role in explaining the working mechanisms of transformers. In this work, we focus on two representative tasks in the category of regular language recognition, known as `even pairs' and `parity check', the aim of which is to determine whether the occurrences of certain subsequences in a given sequence are even. Our goal is to explore how a one-layer transformer, consisting of an attention layer followed by a linear layer, learns to solve these tasks by theoretically analyzing its training dynamics under gradient descent. While even pairs can be solved directly by a one-layer transformer, parity check need to be solved by integrating Chain-of-Thought (CoT), either into the inference stage of a transformer well-trained for the even pairs task, or into the training of a one-layer transformer. For both problems, our analysis shows that the joint training of attention and linear layers exhibits two distinct phases. In the first phase, the attention layer grows rapidly, mapping data sequences into separable vectors. In the second phase, the attention layer becomes stable, while the linear layer grows logarithmically and approaches in direction to a max-margin hyperplane that correctly separates the attention layer outputs into positive and negative samples, and the loss decreases at a rate of $O(1/t)$. Our experiments validate those theoretical results.

### Should you use LLMs to simulate opinions? Quality checks for early-stage   deliberation
**Authors**: Terrence Neumann, Maria De-Arteaga, Sina Fazelpour

**Updated**: 2025-05-01T23:50:29Z

**Summary**: The emergent capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have sparked interest in assessing their ability to simulate human opinions in a variety of contexts, potentially serving as surrogates for human subjects in opinion surveys. However, previous evaluations of this capability have depended heavily on costly, domain-specific human survey data, and mixed empirical results about LLM effectiveness create uncertainty for managers about whether investing in this technology is justified in early-stage research. To address these challenges, we introduce a series of quality checks to support early-stage deliberation about the viability of using LLMs for simulating human opinions. These checks emphasize logical constraints, model stability, and alignment with stakeholder expectations of model outputs, thereby reducing dependence on human-generated data in the initial stages of evaluation. We demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed quality control tests in the context of AI-assisted content moderation, an application that both advocates and critics of LLMs' capabilities to simulate human opinion see as a desirable potential use case. None of the tested models passed all quality control checks, revealing several failure modes. We conclude by discussing implications of these failure modes and recommend how organizations can utilize our proposed tests for prompt engineering and in their risk management practices when considering the use of LLMs for opinion simulation. We make our crowdsourced dataset of claims with human and LLM annotations publicly available for future research.

### RestoreGrad: Signal Restoration Using Conditional Denoising Diffusion   Models with Jointly Learned Prior
**Authors**: Ching-Hua Lee, Chouchang Yang, Jaejin Cho, Yashas Malur Saidutta, Rakshith Sharma Srinivasa, Yilin Shen, Hongxia Jin

**Updated**: 2025-05-01T23:43:35Z

**Summary**: Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) can be utilized for recovering a clean signal from its degraded observation(s) by conditioning the model on the degraded signal. The degraded signals are themselves contaminated versions of the clean signals; due to this correlation, they may encompass certain useful information about the target clean data distribution. However, existing adoption of the standard Gaussian as the prior distribution in turn discards such information, resulting in sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose to improve conditional DDPMs for signal restoration by leveraging a more informative prior that is jointly learned with the diffusion model. The proposed framework, called RestoreGrad, seamlessly integrates DDPMs into the variational autoencoder framework and exploits the correlation between the degraded and clean signals to encode a better diffusion prior. On speech and image restoration tasks, we show that RestoreGrad demonstrates faster convergence (5-10 times fewer training steps) to achieve better quality of restored signals over existing DDPM baselines, and improved robustness to using fewer sampling steps in inference time (2-2.5 times fewer), advocating the advantages of leveraging jointly learned prior for efficiency improvements in the diffusion process.

## Keyword: LLM Deployment 
 ### Evaluating Frontier Models for Stealth and Situational Awareness
**Authors**: Mary Phuong, Roland S. Zimmermann, Ziyue Wang, David Lindner, Victoria Krakovna, Sarah Cogan, Allan Dafoe, Lewis Ho, Rohin Shah

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T17:57:14Z

**Summary**: Recent work has demonstrated the plausibility of frontier AI models scheming -- knowingly and covertly pursuing an objective misaligned with its developer's intentions. Such behavior could be very hard to detect, and if present in future advanced systems, could pose severe loss of control risk. It is therefore important for AI developers to rule out harm from scheming prior to model deployment. In this paper, we present a suite of scheming reasoning evaluations measuring two types of reasoning capabilities that we believe are prerequisites for successful scheming: First, we propose five evaluations of ability to reason about and circumvent oversight (stealth). Second, we present eleven evaluations for measuring a model's ability to instrumentally reason about itself, its environment and its deployment (situational awareness). We demonstrate how these evaluations can be used as part of a scheming inability safety case: a model that does not succeed on these evaluations is almost certainly incapable of causing severe harm via scheming in real deployment. We run our evaluations on current frontier models and find that none of them show concerning levels of either situational awareness or stealth.

### From Foresight to Forethought: VLM-In-the-Loop Policy Steering via   Latent Alignment
**Authors**: Yilin Wu, Ran Tian, Gokul Swamy, Andrea Bajcsy

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T17:53:34Z

**Summary**: While generative robot policies have demonstrated significant potential in learning complex, multimodal behaviors from demonstrations, they still exhibit diverse failures at deployment-time. Policy steering offers an elegant solution to reducing the chance of failure by using an external verifier to select from low-level actions proposed by an imperfect generative policy. Here, one might hope to use a Vision Language Model (VLM) as a verifier, leveraging its open-world reasoning capabilities. However, off-the-shelf VLMs struggle to understand the consequences of low-level robot actions as they are represented fundamentally differently than the text and images the VLM was trained on. In response, we propose FOREWARN, a novel framework to unlock the potential of VLMs as open-vocabulary verifiers for runtime policy steering. Our key idea is to decouple the VLM's burden of predicting action outcomes (foresight) from evaluation (forethought). For foresight, we leverage a latent world model to imagine future latent states given diverse low-level action plans. For forethought, we align the VLM with these predicted latent states to reason about the consequences of actions in its native representation--natural language--and effectively filter proposed plans. We validate our framework across diverse robotic manipulation tasks, demonstrating its ability to bridge representational gaps and provide robust, generalizable policy steering.

### An Efficient Matrix Multiplication Algorithm for Accelerating Inference   in Binary and Ternary Neural Networks
**Authors**: Mohsen Dehghankar, Mahdi Erfanian, Abolfazl Asudeh

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T16:58:10Z

**Summary**: Despite their tremendous success and versatility, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) such as Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from inference inefficiency and rely on advanced computational infrastructure. To address these challenges and make these models more accessible and cost-effective, in this paper, we propose algorithms to improve the inference time and memory efficiency of DNNs with binary and ternary weight matrices. Particularly focusing on matrix multiplication as the bottleneck operation of inference, we observe that, once trained, the weight matrices of a model no longer change. This allows us to preprocess these matrices and create indices that help reduce the storage requirements by a logarithmic factor while enabling our efficient inference algorithms. Specifically, for a $n\times n$ weight matrix, our efficient algorithm guarantees a time complexity of $O(\frac{n^2}{\log n})$, a logarithmic factor improvement over the standard vector-matrix multiplication. Besides theoretical analysis, we conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the practical efficiency of our algorithms. Our results confirm the superiority of our approach both with respect to time and memory, as we observed a reduction in the multiplication time up to 29x and memory usage up to 6x. When applied to LLMs, our experiments show up to a 5.24x speedup in the inference time.

### Self-Generated In-Context Examples Improve LLM Agents for Sequential   Decision-Making Tasks
**Authors**: Vishnu Sarukkai, Zhiqiang Xie, Kayvon Fatahalian

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T16:44:02Z

**Summary**: Many methods for improving Large Language Model (LLM) agents for sequential decision-making tasks depend on task-specific knowledge engineering--such as prompt tuning, curated in-context examples, or customized observation and action spaces. Using these approaches, agent performance improves with the quality or amount of knowledge engineering invested. Instead, we investigate how LLM agents can automatically improve their performance by learning in-context from their own successful experiences on similar tasks. Rather than relying on task-specific knowledge engineering, we focus on constructing and refining a database of self-generated examples. We demonstrate that even a naive accumulation of successful trajectories across training tasks boosts test performance on three benchmarks: ALFWorld (73% to 89%), Wordcraft (55% to 64%), and InterCode-SQL (75% to 79%)--matching the performance the initial agent achieves if allowed two to three attempts per task. We then introduce two extensions: (1) database-level selection through population-based training to identify high-performing example collections, and (2) exemplar-level selection that retains individual trajectories based on their empirical utility as in-context examples. These extensions further enhance performance, achieving 91% on ALFWorld--matching more complex approaches that employ task-specific components and prompts. Our results demonstrate that automatic trajectory database construction offers a compelling alternative to labor-intensive knowledge engineering.

### Insight-V: Exploring Long-Chain Visual Reasoning with Multimodal Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Yuhao Dong, Zuyan Liu, Hai-Long Sun, Jingkang Yang, Winston Hu, Yongming Rao, Ziwei Liu

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T16:03:31Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate enhanced capabilities and reliability by reasoning more, evolving from Chain-of-Thought prompting to product-level solutions like OpenAI o1. Despite various efforts to improve LLM reasoning, high-quality long-chain reasoning data and optimized training pipelines still remain inadequately explored in vision-language tasks. In this paper, we present Insight-V, an early effort to 1) scalably produce long and robust reasoning data for complex multi-modal tasks, and 2) an effective training pipeline to enhance the reasoning capabilities of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs). Specifically, to create long and structured reasoning data without human labor, we design a two-step pipeline with a progressive strategy to generate sufficiently long and diverse reasoning paths and a multi-granularity assessment method to ensure data quality. We observe that directly supervising MLLMs with such long and complex reasoning data will not yield ideal reasoning ability. To tackle this problem, we design a multi-agent system consisting of a reasoning agent dedicated to performing long-chain reasoning and a summary agent trained to judge and summarize reasoning results. We further incorporate an iterative DPO algorithm to enhance the reasoning agent's generation stability and quality. Based on the popular LLaVA-NeXT model and our stronger base MLLM, we demonstrate significant performance gains across challenging multi-modal benchmarks requiring visual reasoning. Benefiting from our multi-agent system, Insight-V can also easily maintain or improve performance on perception-focused multi-modal tasks.

### FlexLLM: A System for Co-Serving Large Language Model Inference and   Parameter-Efficient Finetuning
**Authors**: Gabriele Oliaro, Xupeng Miao, Xinhao Cheng, Vineeth Kada, Ruohan Gao, Yingyi Huang, Remi Delacourt, April Yang, Yingcheng Wang, Mengdi Wu, Colin Unger, Zhihao Jia

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T15:56:59Z

**Summary**: Finetuning large language models (LLMs) is essential for task adaptation, yet serving stacks today isolate inference and finetuning on separate GPU clusters -- wasting resources and under-utilizing hardware. We introduce FlexLLM, the first system to co-serve LLM inference and PEFT-based finetuning on shared GPUs by fusing computation at the token level. The static compilation optimizations in FlexLLM -- dependent parallelization and graph pruning significantly shrink activation memory, leading to end-to-end GPU memory savings by up to 80%. At runtime, a novel token-level finetuning mechanism paired with a hybrid token scheduler dynamically interleaves inference and training tokens within each co-serving iteration, meeting strict latency SLOs while maximizing utilization. In end-to-end benchmarks on LLaMA-3.1-8B, Qwen-2.5-14B, and Qwen-2.5-32B, FlexLLM sustains the inference SLO requirements up to 20 req/s, and improves finetuning throughput by 1.9-4.8x under heavy inference workloads and 2.5-6.8x under light loads, preserving over 76% of peak finetuning progress even at peak demand. The source code of FlexLLM is publicly available at https://github.com/flexflow/FlexFlow/.

### MoDeGPT: Modular Decomposition for Large Language Model Compression
**Authors**: Chi-Heng Lin, Shangqian Gao, James Seale Smith, Abhishek Patel, Shikhar Tuli, Yilin Shen, Hongxia Jin, Yen-Chang Hsu

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T15:34:42Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have reshaped the landscape of artificial intelligence by demonstrating exceptional performance across various tasks. However, substantial computational requirements make their deployment challenging on devices with limited resources. Recently, compression methods using low-rank matrix techniques have shown promise, yet these often lead to degraded accuracy or introduce significant overhead in parameters and inference latency. This paper introduces \textbf{Mo}dular \textbf{De}composition (MoDeGPT), a novel structured compression framework that does not need recovery fine-tuning while resolving the above drawbacks. MoDeGPT partitions the Transformer block into modules comprised of matrix pairs and reduces the hidden dimensions via reconstructing the module-level outputs. MoDeGPT is developed based on a theoretical framework that utilizes three well-established matrix decomposition algorithms -- Nystr\"om approximation, CR decomposition, and SVD -- and applies them to our redefined transformer modules. Our comprehensive experiments show MoDeGPT, without backward propagation, matches or surpasses previous structured compression methods that rely on gradient information, and saves 98% of compute costs on compressing a 13B model. On \textsc{Llama}-2/3 and OPT models, MoDeGPT maintains 90-95% zero-shot performance with 25-30% compression rates. Moreover, the compression can be done on a single GPU within a few hours and increases the inference throughput by up to 46%.

### Toward Teach and Repeat Across Seasonal Deep Snow Accumulation
**Authors**: Matěj Boxan, Alexander Krawciw, Timothy D. Barfoot, François Pomerleau

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T15:11:22Z

**Summary**: Teach and repeat is a rapid way to achieve autonomy in challenging terrain and off-road environments. A human operator pilots the vehicles to create a network of paths that are mapped and associated with odometry. Immediately after teaching, the system can drive autonomously within its tracks. This precision lets operators remain confident that the robot will follow a traversable route. However, this operational paradigm has rarely been explored in off-road environments that change significantly through seasonal variation. This paper presents preliminary field trials using lidar and radar implementations of teach and repeat. Using a subset of the data from the upcoming FoMo dataset, we attempted to repeat routes that were 4 days, 44 days, and 113 days old. Lidar teach and repeat demonstrated a stronger ability to localize when the ground points were removed. FMCW radar was often able to localize on older maps, but only with small deviations from the taught path. Additionally, we highlight specific cases where radar localization failed with recent maps due to the high pitch or roll of the vehicle. We highlight lessons learned during the field deployment and highlight areas to improve to achieve reliable teach and repeat with seasonal changes in the environment. Please follow the dataset at https://norlab-ulaval.github.io/FoMo-website for updates and information on the data release.

### Cramér-Rao Bounds for Integrated Sensing and Communications in   Pinching-Antenna Systems
**Authors**: Dimitrios Bozanis, Vasilis K. Papanikolaou, Sotiris A. Tegos, George K. Karagiannidis

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T15:06:47Z

**Summary**: Pinching-antenna systems (PASs) have recently emerged as a flexible, cost-effective route to large-scale antenna deployments envisioned for integrated sensing and communications (ISAC). This paper establishes the fundamental sensing limits of a bistatic PAS link by deriving closed-form Cram\'er-Rao lower bounds for the joint estimation of range and direction when a target is illuminated by pinching antennas placed along a dielectric waveguide and observed by a uniform linear array receiver. By rigorously preserving the amplitude and phase variations of each pinching antenna, as well as exploiting their non-uniform deployment, we gain valuable insights into the performance gain of PASs over conventional antenna arrays. Numerical results validate that the PAS-based ISAC can achieve centimeter-level ranging and sub-degree angular resolution with significantly fewer hardware resources than conventional uniform linear arrays. The derived bounds provide practical design guidelines for next-generation PAS-enabled ISAC systems.

### Soybean Disease Detection via Interpretable Hybrid CNN-GNN: Integrating   MobileNetV2 and GraphSAGE with Cross-Modal Attention
**Authors**: Md Abrar Jahin, Soudeep Shahriar, M. F. Mridha, Md. Jakir Hossen, Nilanjan Dey

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T15:05:31Z

**Summary**: Soybean leaf disease detection is critical for agricultural productivity but faces challenges due to visually similar symptoms and limited interpretability in conventional methods. While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) excel in spatial feature extraction, they often neglect inter-image relational dependencies, leading to misclassifications. This paper proposes an interpretable hybrid Sequential CNN-Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework that synergizes MobileNetV2 for localized feature extraction and GraphSAGE for relational modeling. The framework constructs a graph where nodes represent leaf images, with edges defined by cosine similarity-based adjacency matrices and adaptive neighborhood sampling. This design captures fine-grained lesion features and global symptom patterns, addressing inter-class similarity challenges. Cross-modal interpretability is achieved via Grad-CAM and Eigen-CAM visualizations, generating heatmaps to highlight disease-influential regions. Evaluated on a dataset of ten soybean leaf diseases, the model achieves $97.16\%$ accuracy, surpassing standalone CNNs ($\le95.04\%$) and traditional machine learning models ($\le77.05\%$). Ablation studies validate the sequential architecture's superiority over parallel or single-model configurations. With only 2.3 million parameters, the lightweight MobileNetV2-GraphSAGE combination ensures computational efficiency, enabling real-time deployment in resource-constrained environments. The proposed approach bridges the gap between accurate classification and practical applicability, offering a robust, interpretable tool for agricultural diagnostics while advancing CNN-GNN integration in plant pathology research.

### Constrained Network Adversarial Attacks: Validity, Robustness, and   Transferability
**Authors**: Anass Grini, Oumaima Taheri, Btissam El Khamlichi, Amal El Fallah-Seghrouchni

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T15:01:42Z

**Summary**: While machine learning has significantly advanced Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS), particularly within IoT environments where devices generate large volumes of data and are increasingly susceptible to cyber threats, these models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Our research reveals a critical flaw in existing adversarial attack methodologies: the frequent violation of domain-specific constraints, such as numerical and categorical limits, inherent to IoT and network traffic. This leads to up to 80.3% of adversarial examples being invalid, significantly overstating real-world vulnerabilities. These invalid examples, though effective in fooling models, do not represent feasible attacks within practical IoT deployments. Consequently, relying on these results can mislead resource allocation for defense, inflating the perceived susceptibility of IoT-enabled NIDS models to adversarial manipulation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that simpler surrogate models like Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) generate more valid adversarial examples compared to complex architectures such as CNNs and LSTMs. Using the MLP as a surrogate, we analyze the transferability of adversarial severity to other ML/DL models commonly used in IoT contexts. This work underscores the importance of considering both domain constraints and model architecture when evaluating and designing robust ML/DL models for security-critical IoT and network applications.

### TRAVELER: A Benchmark for Evaluating Temporal Reasoning across Vague,   Implicit and Explicit References
**Authors**: Svenja Kenneweg, Jörg Deigmöller, Philipp Cimiano, Julian Eggert

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T14:56:50Z

**Summary**: Understanding and resolving temporal references is essential in Natural Language Understanding as we often refer to the past or future in daily communication. Although existing benchmarks address a system's ability to reason about and resolve temporal references, systematic evaluation of specific temporal references remains limited. Towards closing this gap, we introduce TRAVELER, a novel synthetic benchmark dataset that follows a Question Answering paradigm and consists of questions involving temporal references with the corresponding correct answers. TRAVELER assesses models' abilities to resolve explicit, implicit relative to speech time, and vague temporal references. Beyond investigating the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs depending on the type of temporal reference, our benchmark also allows evaluation of performance in relation to the length of the set of events. For the category of vague temporal references, ground-truth answers were established via human surveys on Prolific, following a procedure similar to the one from Kenneweg et al. To demonstrate the benchmark's applicability, we evaluate four state-of-the-art LLMs using a question-answering task encompassing 3,300 questions. Our findings show that while the benchmarked LLMs can answer questions over event sets with a handful of events and explicit temporal references successfully, performance clearly deteriorates with larger event set length and when temporal references get less explicit. Notably, the vague question category exhibits the lowest performance across all models.   The benchmark is publicly available at: https://gitlab.ub.uni-bielefeld.de/s.kenneweg/TRAVELER

### Helping Big Language Models Protect Themselves: An Enhanced Filtering   and Summarization System
**Authors**: Sheikh Samit Muhaimin, Spyridon Mastorakis

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T14:42:26Z

**Summary**: The recent growth in the use of Large Language Models has made them vulnerable to sophisticated adversarial assaults, manipulative prompts, and encoded malicious inputs. Existing countermeasures frequently necessitate retraining models, which is computationally costly and impracticable for deployment. Without the need for retraining or fine-tuning, this study presents a unique defense paradigm that allows LLMs to recognize, filter, and defend against adversarial or malicious inputs on their own. There are two main parts to the suggested framework: (1) A prompt filtering module that uses sophisticated Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, including zero-shot classification, keyword analysis, and encoded content detection (e.g. base64, hexadecimal, URL encoding), to detect, decode, and classify harmful inputs; and (2) A summarization module that processes and summarizes adversarial research literature to give the LLM context-aware defense knowledge. This approach strengthens LLMs' resistance to adversarial exploitation by fusing text extraction, summarization, and harmful prompt analysis. According to experimental results, this integrated technique has a 98.71% success rate in identifying harmful patterns, manipulative language structures, and encoded prompts. By employing a modest amount of adversarial research literature as context, the methodology also allows the model to react correctly to harmful inputs with a larger percentage of jailbreak resistance and refusal rate. While maintaining the quality of LLM responses, the framework dramatically increases LLM's resistance to hostile misuse, demonstrating its efficacy as a quick and easy substitute for time-consuming, retraining-based defenses.

**Authors**: Regan Bolton, Mohammadreza Sheikhfathollahi, Simon Parkinson, Vanessa Vulovic, Gary Bamford, Dan Basher, Howard Parkinson

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T14:34:33Z

**Summary**: Safety critical software assessment requires robust assessment against complex regulatory frameworks, a process traditionally limited by manual evaluation. This paper presents Document Retrieval-Augmented Fine-Tuning (DRAFT), a novel approach that enhances the capabilities of a large language model (LLM) for safety-critical compliance assessment. DRAFT builds upon existing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques by introducing a novel fine-tuning framework that accommodates our dual-retrieval architecture, which simultaneously accesses both software documentation and applicable reference standards. To fine-tune DRAFT, we develop a semi-automated dataset generation methodology that incorporates variable numbers of relevant documents with meaningful distractors, closely mirroring real-world assessment scenarios. Experiments with GPT-4o-mini demonstrate a 7% improvement in correctness over the baseline model, with qualitative improvements in evidence handling, response structure, and domain-specific reasoning. DRAFT represents a practical approach to improving compliance assessment systems while maintaining the transparency and evidence-based reasoning essential in regulatory domains.

**Authors**: Kawon Han, Kaitao Meng, Xiao-Yang Wang, Christos Masouros

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T14:13:59Z

**Summary**: The ultimate goal of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) deployment is to provide coordinated sensing and communication services at an unprecedented scale. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of network-level ISAC systems, an emerging paradigm that significantly extends the capabilities of link-level ISAC through distributed cooperation. We first examine recent advancements in network-level ISAC architectures, emphasizing various cooperation schemes and distributed system designs. The sensing and communication (S\&C) performance is analyzed with respect to interference management and cooperative S\&C, offering new insights into the design principles necessary for large-scale networked ISAC deployments. In addition, distributed signaling strategies across different levels of cooperation are reviewed, focusing on key performance metrics such as sensing accuracy and communication quality-of-service (QoS). Next, we explore the key challenges for practical deployment where the critical role of synchronization is also discussed, highlighting advanced over-the-air synchronization techniques specifically tailored for bi-static and distributed ISAC systems. Finally, open challenges and future research directions in network-level ISAC design are identified. The findings and discussions aim to serve as a foundational guideline for advancing scalable, high-performance, and resilient distributed ISAC systems in next-generation wireless networks.

**Authors**: Gaoxiang Cong, Liang Li, Jiadong Pan, Zhedong Zhang, Amin Beheshti, Anton van den Hengel, Yuankai Qi, Qingming Huang

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T13:30:19Z

**Summary**: Movie Dubbing aims to convert scripts into speeches that align with the given movie clip in both temporal and emotional aspects while preserving the vocal timbre of a given brief reference audio. Existing methods focus primarily on reducing the word error rate while ignoring the importance of lip-sync and acoustic quality. To address these issues, we propose a large language model (LLM) based flow matching architecture for dubbing, named FlowDubber, which achieves high-quality audio-visual sync and pronunciation by incorporating a large speech language model and dual contrastive aligning while achieving better acoustic quality via the proposed voice-enhanced flow matching than previous works. First, we introduce Qwen2.5 as the backbone of LLM to learn the in-context sequence from movie scripts and reference audio. Then, the proposed semantic-aware learning focuses on capturing LLM semantic knowledge at the phoneme level. Next, dual contrastive aligning (DCA) boosts mutual alignment with lip movement, reducing ambiguities where similar phonemes might be confused. Finally, the proposed Flow-based Voice Enhancing (FVE) improves acoustic quality in two aspects, which introduces an LLM-based acoustics flow matching guidance to strengthen clarity and uses affine style prior to enhance identity when recovering noise into mel-spectrograms via gradient vector field prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms several state-of-the-art methods on two primary benchmarks. The demos are available at {\href{https://galaxycong.github.io/LLM-Flow-Dubber/}{\textcolor{red}{https://galaxycong.github.io/LLM-Flow-Dubber/}}}.

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T13:26:47Z

**Summary**: A scientific study begins with a central question, and search engines like PubMed are the first tools for retrieving knowledge and understanding the current state of the art. Large Language Models (LLMs) have been used in research, promising acceleration and deeper results. However, besides caution, they demand rigorous validation. Assessing complex biological relationships remains challenging for SQL-based tools and LLM models. Here, we introduce the Digital Pathway Curation (DPC) pipeline to evaluate the reproducibility and accuracy of the Gemini models against PubMed search and human expert curation. Using two omics experiments, we created a large dataset (Ensemble) based on determining pathway-disease associations. With the Ensemble dataset, we demonstrate that Gemini achieves high run-to-run reproducibility of approximately 99% and inter-model reproducibility of around 75%. Next, we calculate the crowdsourced consensus using a smaller dataset. The CSC allows us to calculate accuracies, and the Gemini multi-model consensus reached a significant accuracy of about 87%. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs are reproducible, reliable, and valuable tools for navigating complex biomedical knowledge.

**Authors**: Mahdi Dhaini, Kafaite Zahra Hussain, Efstratios Zaradoukas, Gjergji Kasneci

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T13:00:05Z

**Summary**: As Natural Language Processing (NLP) models continue to evolve and become integral to high-stakes applications, ensuring their interpretability remains a critical challenge. Given the growing variety of explainability methods and diverse stakeholder requirements, frameworks that help stakeholders select appropriate explanations tailored to their specific use cases are increasingly important. To address this need, we introduce EvalxNLP, a Python framework for benchmarking state-of-the-art feature attribution methods for transformer-based NLP models. EvalxNLP integrates eight widely recognized explainability techniques from the Explainable AI (XAI) literature, enabling users to generate and evaluate explanations based on key properties such as faithfulness, plausibility, and complexity. Our framework also provides interactive, LLM-based textual explanations, facilitating user understanding of the generated explanations and evaluation outcomes. Human evaluation results indicate high user satisfaction with EvalxNLP, suggesting it is a promising framework for benchmarking explanation methods across diverse user groups. By offering a user-friendly and extensible platform, EvalxNLP aims at democratizing explainability tools and supporting the systematic comparison and advancement of XAI techniques in NLP.

### From Bugs to Benefits: Improving User Stories by Leveraging Crowd   Knowledge with CrUISE-AC
**Authors**: Stefan Schwedt, Thomas Ströder

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T12:35:19Z

**Summary**: Costs for resolving software defects increase exponentially in late stages. Incomplete or ambiguous requirements are one of the biggest sources for defects, since stakeholders might not be able to communicate their needs or fail to share their domain specific knowledge. Combined with insufficient developer experience, teams are prone to constructing incorrect or incomplete features. To prevent this, requirements engineering has to explore knowledge sources beyond stakeholder interviews. Publicly accessible issue trackers for systems within the same application domain hold essential information on identified weaknesses, edge cases, and potential error sources, all documented by actual users. Our research aims at (1) identifying, and (2) leveraging such issues to improve an agile requirements artifact known as a "user story". We present CrUISE-AC (Crowd and User Informed Suggestion Engine for Acceptance Criteria) as a fully automated method that investigates issues and generates non-trivial additional acceptance criteria for a given user story by employing NLP techniques and an ensemble of LLMs. CrUISE- AC was evaluated by five independent experts in two distinct business domains. Our findings suggest that issue trackers hold valuable information pertinent to requirements engineering. Our evaluation shows that 80-82% of the generated acceptance criteria add relevant requirements to the user stories. Limitations are the dependence on accessible input issues and the fact that we do not check generated criteria for being conflict-free or non-overlapping with criteria from other user stories.

### Performance of Cell-Free Massive MIMO in Realistic Urban Propagation   Environments
**Authors**: Yunlu Xiao, Ljiljana Simić

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T12:18:21Z

**Summary**: While UE-centric cell-free massive MIMO (CF-mMIMO) provides high and uniform throughput performance under the assumption of a uniform propagation environment modeled by the log-distance path loss channel model, the performance under a realistic urban propagation environment is not yet fully addressed. In this paper we conduct the first comparative performance study of CF-mMIMO under both the widely assumed log-distance channel model and the realistic urban propagation environment obtained via raytracing using real 3D city layouts and practical AP locations. Our results show that with the raytracing channel model, CF-mMIMO cannot achieve as high and uniform throughput performance as observed with the log-distance channel model, putting into question the attractiveness in practice of CF-mMIMO for real urban deployments.

**Authors**: Andrej Macko, Lukáš Gajdošech, Viktor Kocur

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T11:48:11Z

**Summary**: This paper presents a computationally efficient method for vehicle speed estimation from traffic camera footage. Building upon previous work that utilizes 3D bounding boxes derived from 2D detections and vanishing point geometry, we introduce several improvements to enhance real-time performance. We evaluate our method in several variants on the BrnoCompSpeed dataset in terms of vehicle detection and speed estimation accuracy. Our extensive evaluation across various hardware platforms, including edge devices, demonstrates significant gains in frames per second (FPS) compared to the prior state-of-the-art, while maintaining comparable or improved speed estimation accuracy. We analyze the trade-off between accuracy and computational cost, showing that smaller models utilizing post-training quantization offer the best balance for real-world deployment. Our best performing model beats previous state-of-the-art in terms of median vehicle speed estimation error (0.58 km/h vs. 0.60 km/h), detection precision (91.02% vs 87.08%) and recall (91.14% vs. 83.32%) while also being 5.5 times faster.

### Sparks of Tabular Reasoning via Text2SQL Reinforcement Learning
**Authors**: Josefa Lia Stoisser, Marc Boubnovski Martell, Julien Fauqueur

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T11:34:00Z

**Summary**: This work reframes the Text-to-SQL task as a pathway for teaching large language models (LLMs) to reason over and manipulate tabular data--moving beyond the traditional focus on query generation. We propose a two-stage framework that leverages SQL supervision to develop transferable table reasoning capabilities. First, we synthesize detailed chain-of-thought (CoT) traces from real-world SQL queries, providing step-by-step, clause-level supervision that teaches the model how to traverse, filter, and aggregate table fields. Second, we introduce a Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) reinforcement learning objective that connects SQL execution accuracy to generalizable reasoning by encouraging steps that extend beyond task-specific syntax and transfer across datasets. Empirically, our approach improves performance on standard Text-to-SQL benchmarks and achieves substantial gains on reasoning-intensive datasets such as BIRD and CRT-QA, demonstrating enhanced generalization and interpretability. Specifically, the distilled-quantized LLaMA model achieved a relative 33.9\% increase in accuracy when trained on Text-to-SQL tasks, while Qwen achieved a relative 14.5\% increase. These results suggest that SQL can serve not only as a target formalism but also as an effective scaffold for learning robust, transferable reasoning over structured data.

### HarmoniCa: Harmonizing Training and Inference for Better Feature Caching   in Diffusion Transformer Acceleration
**Authors**: Yushi Huang, Zining Wang, Ruihao Gong, Jing Liu, Xinjie Zhang, Jinyang Guo, Xianglong Liu, Jun Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T11:29:31Z

**Summary**: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) excel in generative tasks but face practical deployment challenges due to high inference costs. Feature caching, which stores and retrieves redundant computations, offers the potential for acceleration. Existing learning-based caching, though adaptive, overlooks the impact of the prior timestep. It also suffers from misaligned objectives--aligned predicted noise vs. high-quality images--between training and inference. These two discrepancies compromise both performance and efficiency. To this end, we harmonize training and inference with a novel learning-based caching framework dubbed HarmoniCa. It first incorporates Step-Wise Denoising Training (SDT) to ensure the continuity of the denoising process, where prior steps can be leveraged. In addition, an Image Error Proxy-Guided Objective (IEPO) is applied to balance image quality against cache utilization through an efficient proxy to approximate the image error. Extensive experiments across $8$ models, $4$ samplers, and resolutions from $256\times256$ to $2K$ demonstrate superior performance and speedup of our framework. For instance, it achieves over $40\%$ latency reduction (i.e., $2.07\times$ theoretical speedup) and improved performance on PixArt-$\alpha$. Remarkably, our image-free approach reduces training time by $25\%$ compared with the previous method. Our code is available at https://github.com/ModelTC/HarmoniCa.

### EnviKal-Loc: Sub-10m Indoor LoRaWAN Localization using an   Environmental-Aware Path Loss and Adaptive RSSI Smoothing
**Authors**: Nahshon Mokua Obiri, Kristof Van Laerhoven

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T11:00:40Z

**Summary**: LoRaWAN technology's extensive coverage positions it as a strong contender for large-scale IoT deployments. However, achieving sub-10 m accuracy in indoor localization remains challenging due to complex environmental conditions, multipath fading, and transient obstructions. This paper proposes a lightweight but robust approach combining adaptive filtering with an extended log-distance, multi-wall path loss and shadowing (PLS) model. Our methodology augments conventional models with critical LoRaWAN parameters (received signal strength indicator (RSSI), frequency, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)) and dynamic environmental indicators (temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide, particulate matter, and barometric pressure). An adaptive Kalman filter reduces RSSI fluctuations, isolating persistent trends from momentary noise. Using a six-month dataset of 1,328,334 field measurements, we evaluate three models: the baseline COST 231 multi-wall model (MWM), the baseline model augmented with environmental parameters (MWM-EP), and a forward-only adaptive Kalman-filtered RSSI version of the latter (MWM-EP-KF). Results confirm that the MWM-EP-KF achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 5.81 m, outperforming both the MWM-EP (10.56 m) and the baseline MWM framework (17.98 m). Environmental augmentation reduces systematic errors by 41.22%, while Kalman filtering significantly enhances robustness under high RSSI volatility by 42.63%, on average across all devices. These findings present an interpretable, efficient solution for precise indoor LoRaWAN localization in dynamically changing environments.

### Automating the Generation of Prompts for LLM-based Action Choice in PDDL   Planning
**Authors**: Katharina Stein, Daniel Fišer, Jörg Hoffmann, Alexander Koller

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T10:41:18Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized a large variety of NLP tasks. An active debate is to what extent they can do reasoning and planning. Prior work has assessed the latter in the specific context of PDDL planning, based on manually converting three PDDL domains into natural language (NL) prompts. Here we automate this conversion step, showing how to leverage an LLM to automatically generate NL prompts from PDDL input. Our automatically generated NL prompts result in similar LLM-planning performance as the previous manually generated ones. Beyond this, the automation enables us to run much larger experiments, providing for the first time a broad evaluation of LLM planning performance in PDDL. Our NL prompts yield better performance than PDDL prompts and simple template-based NL prompts. Compared to symbolic planners, LLM planning lags far behind; but in some domains, our best LLM configuration scales up further than A$^\star$ using LM-cut.

### LLM Security: Vulnerabilities, Attacks, Defenses, and Countermeasures
**Authors**: Francisco Aguilera-Martínez, Fernando Berzal

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T10:35:26Z

**Summary**: As large language models (LLMs) continue to evolve, it is critical to assess the security threats and vulnerabilities that may arise both during their training phase and after models have been deployed. This survey seeks to define and categorize the various attacks targeting LLMs, distinguishing between those that occur during the training phase and those that affect already trained models. A thorough analysis of these attacks is presented, alongside an exploration of defense mechanisms designed to mitigate such threats. Defenses are classified into two primary categories: prevention-based and detection-based defenses. Furthermore, our survey summarizes possible attacks and their corresponding defense strategies. It also provides an evaluation of the effectiveness of the known defense mechanisms for the different security threats. Our survey aims to offer a structured framework for securing LLMs, while also identifying areas that require further research to improve and strengthen defenses against emerging security challenges.

### AT-Drone: Benchmarking Adaptive Teaming in Multi-Drone Pursuit
**Authors**: Yang Li, Junfan Chen, Feng Xue, Jiabin Qiu, Wenbin Li, Qingrui Zhang, Ying Wen, Wei Pan

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T10:33:06Z

**Summary**: Adaptive teaming-the capability of agents to effectively collaborate with unfamiliar teammates without prior coordination-is widely explored in virtual video games but overlooked in real-world multi-robot contexts. Yet, such adaptive collaboration is crucial for real-world applications, including border surveillance, search-and-rescue, and counter-terrorism operations. To address this gap, we introduce AT-Drone, the first dedicated benchmark explicitly designed to facilitate comprehensive training and evaluation of adaptive teaming strategies in multi-drone pursuit scenarios. AT-Drone makes the following key contributions: (1) An adaptable simulation environment configurator that enables intuitive and rapid setup of adaptive teaming multi-drone pursuit tasks, including four predefined pursuit environments. (2) A streamlined real-world deployment pipeline that seamlessly translates simulation insights into practical drone evaluations using edge devices and Crazyflie drones. (3) A novel algorithm zoo integrated with a distributed training framework, featuring diverse algorithms explicitly tailored, for the first time, to multi-pursuer and multi-evader settings. (4) Standardized evaluation protocols with newly designed unseen drone zoos, explicitly designed to rigorously assess the performance of adaptive teaming. Comprehensive experimental evaluations across four progressively challenging multi-drone pursuit scenarios confirm AT-Drone's effectiveness in advancing adaptive teaming research. Real-world drone experiments further validate its practical feasibility and utility for realistic robotic operations.

### On the Limitations of Steering in Language Model Alignment
**Authors**: Chebrolu Niranjan, Kokil Jaidka, Gerard Christopher Yeo

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T10:08:34Z

**Summary**: Steering vectors are a promising approach to aligning language model behavior at inference time. In this paper, we propose a framework to assess the limitations of steering vectors as alignment mechanisms. Using a framework of transformer hook interventions and antonym-based function vectors, we evaluate the role of prompt structure and context complexity in steering effectiveness. Our findings indicate that steering vectors are promising for specific alignment tasks, such as value alignment, but may not provide a robust foundation for general-purpose alignment in LLMs, particularly in complex scenarios. We establish a methodological foundation for future investigations into steering capabilities of reasoning models.

### Reward Guidance for Reinforcement Learning Tasks Based on Large Language   Models: The LMGT Framework
**Authors**: Yongxin Deng, Xihe Qiu, Jue Chen, Xiaoyu Tan

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T09:58:28Z

**Summary**: The inherent uncertainty in the environmental transition model of Reinforcement Learning (RL) necessitates a delicate balance between exploration and exploitation. This balance is crucial for optimizing computational resources to accurately estimate expected rewards for the agent. In scenarios with sparse rewards, such as robotic control systems, achieving this balance is particularly challenging. However, given that many environments possess extensive prior knowledge, learning from the ground up in such contexts may be redundant. To address this issue, we propose Language Model Guided reward Tuning (LMGT), a novel, sample-efficient framework. LMGT leverages the comprehensive prior knowledge embedded in Large Language Models (LLMs) and their proficiency in processing non-standard data forms, such as wiki tutorials. By utilizing LLM-guided reward shifts, LMGT adeptly balances exploration and exploitation, thereby guiding the agent's exploratory behavior and enhancing sample efficiency. We have rigorously evaluated LMGT across various RL tasks and evaluated it in the embodied robotic environment Housekeep. Our results demonstrate that LMGT consistently outperforms baseline methods. Furthermore, the findings suggest that our framework can substantially reduce the computational resources required during the RL training phase.

### Methodological Foundations for AI-Driven Survey Question Generation
**Authors**: Ted K. Mburu, Kangxuan Rong, Campbell J. McColley, Alexandra Werth

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T09:50:34Z

**Summary**: This paper presents a methodological framework for using generative AI in educational survey research. We explore how Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate adaptive, context-aware survey questions and introduce the Synthetic Question-Response Analysis (SQRA) framework, which enables iterative testing and refinement of AI-generated prompts prior to deployment with human participants. Guided by Activity Theory, we analyze how AI tools mediate participant engagement and learning, and we examine ethical issues such as bias, privacy, and transparency. Through sentiment, lexical, and structural analyses of both AI-to-AI and AI-to-human survey interactions, we evaluate the alignment and effectiveness of these questions. Our findings highlight the promise and limitations of AI-driven survey instruments, emphasizing the need for robust prompt engineering and validation to support trustworthy, scalable, and contextually relevant data collection in engineering education.

**Authors**: Jiawei He, Boya Zhang, Hossein Rouhizadeh, Yingjian Chen, Rui Yang, Jin Lu, Xudong Chen, Nan Liu, Irene Li, Douglas Teodoro

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T09:44:51Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language processing tasks. However, their application in the biomedical domain presents unique challenges, particularly regarding factual accuracy and up-to-date knowledge integration. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising solution to address these challenges by combining the generative capabilities of LLMs with external knowledge retrieval. This comprehensive survey examines the application of RAG in the biomedical domain, focusing on its technological components, available datasets, and clinical applications. We present a systematic analysis of retrieval methods, ranking strategies, and generation models, while also exploring the challenges and future directions in this rapidly evolving field. Our work provides researchers and practitioners with a thorough understanding of the current state of biomedical RAG systems and identifies key areas for future research and development.

### Active Sybil Attack and Efficient Defense Strategy in IPFS DHT
**Authors**: V. H. M. Netto, T. Cholez, C. L. Ignat

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T09:31:14Z

**Summary**: The InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is a decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) storage that relies on Kademlia, a Distributed Hash Table (DHT) structure commonly used in P2P systems for its proved scalability. However, DHTs are known to be vulnerable to Sybil attacks, in which a single entity controls multiple malicious nodes. Recent studies have shown that IPFS is affected by a passive content eclipse attack, leveraging Sybils, in which adversarial nodes hide received indexed information from other peers, making the content appear unavailable. Fortunately, the latest mitigation strategy coupling an attack detection based on statistical tests and a wider publication strategy upon detection was able to circumvent it.   In this work, we present a new active attack, with malicious nodes responding with semantically correct but intentionally false data, exploiting both an optimized placement of Sybils to stay below the detection threshold and an early trigger of the content discovery termination in Kubo, the main IPFS implementation. Our attack achieves to completely eclipse content on the latest Kubo release. When evaluated against the most recent known mitigation, it successfully denies access to the target content in approximately 80\% of lookup attempts.   To address this vulnerability, we propose a new mitigation called SR-DHT-Store, which enables efficient, Sybil-resistant content publication without relying on attack detection but instead on a systematic and precise use of region-based queries, defined by a dynamically computed XOR distance to the target ID. SR-DHT-Store can be combined with other defense mechanisms resulting in a defense strategy that completely mitigates both passive and active Sybil attacks at a lower overhead, while allowing an incremental deployment.

### Risk Analysis and Design Against Adversarial Actions
**Authors**: Marco C. Campi, Algo Carè, Luis G. Crespo, Simone Garatti, Federico A. Ramponi

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T09:16:44Z

**Summary**: Learning models capable of providing reliable predictions in the face of adversarial actions has become a central focus of the machine learning community in recent years. This challenge arises from observing that data encountered at deployment time often deviate from the conditions under which the model was trained. In this paper, we address deployment-time adversarial actions and propose a versatile, well-principled framework to evaluate the model's robustness against attacks of diverse types and intensities. While we initially focus on Support Vector Regression (SVR), the proposed approach extends naturally to the broad domain of learning via relaxed optimization techniques. Our results enable an assessment of the model vulnerability without requiring additional test data and operate in a distribution-free setup. These results not only provide a tool to enhance trust in the model's applicability but also aid in selecting among competing alternatives. Later in the paper, we show that our findings also offer useful insights for establishing new results within the out-of-distribution framework.

### MateICL: Mitigating Attention Dispersion in Large-Scale In-Context   Learning
**Authors**: Murtadha Ahmed, Wenbo, Liu yunfeng

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T08:45:45Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in In-Context Learning (ICL). However, the fixed position length constraints in pre-trained models limit the number of demonstration examples. Recent efforts to extend context suffer from attention dispersion as the number of demonstrations increases. In this paper, we introduce Mitigating Attention Dispersion in large-scale ICL (MateICL) that enables LLMs to maintain effective self-attention as the context size grows. We first split the context into multiple windows, each filled to the model's context capacity, which are processed separately. Then, we introduce an additional layer to recalibrate the attention weights, prioritizing the query tokens as the number of demonstrations increases. Our empirical results show that MateICL can effectively leverage larger contexts to improve ICL performance. Compared to retrieval-based baselines, MateICL consistently achieves better performance without requiring an externally trained retrieval model. Despite recent advances in inference strategies (e.g., 32k token contexts), our results demonstrate that MateICL remains beneficial in computationally resource-constrained settings. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/amurtadha/MateICL.

### Smart Environmental Monitoring of Marine Pollution using Edge AI
**Authors**: Mohamed Moursi, Norbert Wehn, Bilal Hammoud

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T07:39:43Z

**Summary**: Oil spill incidents pose severe threats to marine ecosystems and coastal environments, necessitating rapid detection and monitoring capabilities to mitigate environmental damage. In this paper, we demonstrate how artificial intelligence, despite the inherent high computational and memory requirements, can be efficiently integrated into marine pollution monitoring systems. More precisely, we propose a drone-based smart monitoring system leveraging a compressed deep learning U-Net architecture for oil spill detection and thickness estimation. Compared to the standard U-Net architecture, the number of convolution blocks and channels per block are modified. The new model is then trained on synthetic radar data to accurately predict thick oil slick thickness up to 10 mm. Results show that our optimized Tiny U-Net achieves superior performance with an Intersection over Union (IoU) metric of approximately 79%, while simultaneously reducing the model size by a factor of $\sim$269x compared to the state-of-the-art. This significant model compression enables efficient edge computing deployment on field-programmable gate array (FPGA) hardware integrated directly into the drone platform. Hardware implementation demonstrates near real-time thickness estimation capabilities with a run-time power consumption of approximately 2.2 watts. Our findings highlight the increasing potential of smart monitoring technologies and efficient edge computing for operational characterization in marine environments.

### MADIL: An MDL-based Framework for Efficient Program Synthesis in the ARC   Benchmark
**Authors**: Sébastien Ferré

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T07:39:08Z

**Summary**: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has achieved remarkable success in specialized tasks but struggles with efficient skill acquisition and generalization. The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) benchmark evaluates intelligence based on minimal training requirements. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently improved ARC performance, they rely on extensive pre-training and high computational costs. We introduce MADIL (MDL-based AI), a novel approach leveraging the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle for efficient inductive learning. MADIL performs pattern-based decomposition, enabling structured generalization. While its performance (7% at ArcPrize 2024) remains below LLM-based methods, it offers greater efficiency and interpretability. This paper details MADIL's methodology, its application to ARC, and experimental evaluations.

### Zero-Shot Document-Level Biomedical Relation Extraction via   Scenario-based Prompt Design in Two-Stage with LLM
**Authors**: Lei Zhao, Ling Kang, Quan Guo

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T07:33:20Z

**Summary**: With the advent of artificial intelligence (AI), many researchers are attempting to extract structured information from document-level biomedical literature by fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). However, they face significant challenges such as the need for expensive hardware, like high-performance GPUs and the high labor costs associated with annotating training datasets, especially in biomedical realm. Recent research on LLMs, such as GPT-4 and Llama3, has shown promising performance in zero-shot settings, inspiring us to explore a novel approach to achieve the same results from unannotated full documents using general LLMs with lower hardware and labor costs. Our approach combines two major stages: named entity recognition (NER) and relation extraction (RE). NER identifies chemical, disease and gene entities from the document with synonym and hypernym extraction using an LLM with a crafted prompt. RE extracts relations between entities based on predefined relation schemas and prompts. To enhance the effectiveness of prompt, we propose a five-part template structure and a scenario-based prompt design principles, along with evaluation method to systematically assess the prompts. Finally, we evaluated our approach against fine-tuning and pre-trained models on two biomedical datasets: ChemDisGene and CDR. The experimental results indicate that our proposed method can achieve comparable accuracy levels to fine-tuning and pre-trained models but with reduced human and hardware expenses.

### Quasi-Static IRS: 3D Shaped Beamforming for Area Coverage Enhancement
**Authors**: Zhenyu Jiang, Xintong Chen, Jiangbin Lyu, Liqun Fu, Rui Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T07:33:02Z

**Summary**: Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is a promising paradigm to reconfigure the wireless environment for enhanced communication coverage and quality. However, to compensate for the double pathloss effect, massive IRS elements are required, raising concerns on the scalability of cost and complexity. This paper introduces a new architecture of quasi-static IRS (QS-IRS), which tunes element phases via mechanical adjustment or manually re-arranging the array topology. QS-IRS relies on massive production/assembly of purely passive elements only, and thus is suitable for ultra low-cost and large-scale deployment to enhance long-term coverage. To achieve this end, an IRS-aided area coverage problem is formulated, which explicitly considers the element radiation pattern (ERP), with the newly introduced shape masks for the mainlobe, and the sidelobe constraints to reduce energy leakage. An alternating optimization (AO) algorithm based on the difference-of-convex (DC) and successive convex approximation (SCA) procedure is proposed, which achieves shaped beamforming with power gains close to that of the joint optimization algorithm, but with significantly reduced computational complexity.

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T07:30:39Z

**Summary**: This paper evaluates the performance of reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) optimization algorithms, which utilize channel estimation methods, in ray tracing (RT) simulations within urban digital twin environments. Beyond Sionna's native capabilities, we implement and benchmark additional RIS optimization algorithms based on channel estimation, enabling an evaluation of RIS strategies under various deployment conditions. Coverage maps for RIS-assisted communication systems are generated through the integration of Sionna's RT simulations. Moreover, real-world experimentation underscores the necessity of validating algorithms in near-realistic simulation environments, as minor variations in measurement setups can significantly affect performance.

**Authors**: Jingwen Tong, Wei Guo, Jiawei Shao, Qiong Wu, Zijian Li, Zehong Lin, Jun Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T07:29:19Z

**Summary**: The rapid evolution of wireless networks presents unprecedented challenges in managing complex and dynamic systems. Existing methods are increasingly facing fundamental limitations in addressing these challenges. In this paper, we introduce WirelessAgent, a novel framework that harnesses large language models (LLMs) to create autonomous AI agents for diverse wireless network tasks. This framework integrates four core modules that mirror human cognitive processes: perception, memory, planning, and action. To implement it, we provide a basic usage based on agentic workflows and the LangGraph architecture. We demonstrate the effectiveness of WirelessAgent through a comprehensive case study on network slicing. The numerical results show that WirelessAgent achieves $44.4\%$ higher bandwidth utilization than the \emph{Prompt-based} method, while performing only $4.3\%$ below the \emph{Rule-based optimality}. Notably, WirelessAgent delivers near-optimal network throughput across diverse network scenarios. These underscore the framework's potential for intelligent and autonomous resource management in future wireless networks. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/jwentong/WirelessAgent_R1}.

### Retrieval Augmented Learning: A Retrial-based Large Language Model   Self-Supervised Learning and Autonomous Knowledge Generation
**Authors**: Zongyuan Li, Pengfei Li, Runnan Qi, Yanan Ni, Lumin Jiang, Hui Wu, Xuebo Zhang, Kuihua Huang, Xian Guo

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T07:25:01Z

**Summary**: The lack of domain-specific data in the pre-training of Large Language Models (LLMs) severely limits LLM-based decision systems in specialized applications, while post-training a model in the scenarios requires significant computational resources. In this paper, we present Retrial-Augmented Learning (RAL), a reward-free self-supervised learning framework for LLMs that operates without model training. By developing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) into a module for organizing intermediate data, we realized a three-stage autonomous knowledge generation of proposing a hypothesis, validating the hypothesis, and generating the knowledge. The method is evaluated in the LLM-PySC2 environment, a representative decision-making platform that combines sufficient complexity with domain-specific knowledge requirements. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method effectively reduces hallucination by generating and utilizing validated knowledge, and increases decision-making performance at an extremely low cost. Meanwhile, the approach exhibits potential in out-of-distribution(OOD) tasks, robustness, and transferability, making it a cost-friendly but effective solution for decision-making problems and autonomous knowledge generation.

### LLM-PySC2: Starcraft II learning environment for Large Language Models
**Authors**: Zongyuan Li, Yanan Ni, Runnan Qi, Lumin Jiang, Chang Lu, Xiaojie Xu, Xiangbei Liu, Pengfei Li, Yunzheng Guo, Zhe Ma, Huanyu Li, Hui Wu, Xian Guo, Kuihua Huang, Xuebo Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T07:20:36Z

**Summary**: The tremendous potential has been demonstrated by large language models (LLMs) in intelligent decision-making problems, with unprecedented capabilities shown across diverse applications ranging from gaming AI systems to complex strategic planning frameworks. However, the StarCraft II platform, which has been widely adopted for validating decision-making algorithms in the past decade, has not yet provided substantial support for this emerging domain. To address issues that LLMs cannot interface with the hundreds of actions of the pysc2 backend and the lack of native support for multi-agent (MA) collaboration, we propose the LLM-PySC2 environment. This is the first environment that offers LLMs the complete pysc2 action space with sufficient multi-modal information and game Wiki knowledge. With an asynchronous query architecture, the environment efficiently interacts with LLMs that maintain a constant latency regardless of the scale of the agents' population. In the experiments, we evaluated LLMs' decision-making performance in both the macro-decision and micro-operation scenarios, with traditional StarCraft II Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC) tasks and a series of new proposed. Results indicate that LLMs possess the potential to achieve victories in complex scenarios but cannot constantly generate correct decisions, especially in the recovered pysc2 action space and MA settings. Without task-relevant instructions, the pre-trained models suffer from issues such as hallucinations and inefficient collaboration. Our findings suggest that StarCraft II still challenges in the era of large models, revealing that there is a lot to do to develop an advanced LLM decision-making system, and the proposed LLM-PySC2 environment will support future development of LLM-based decision-making solutions.

### A Rusty Link in the AI Supply Chain: Detecting Evil Configurations in   Model Repositories
**Authors**: Ziqi Ding, Qian Fu, Junchen Ding, Gelei Deng, Yi Liu, Yuekang Li

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T07:16:20Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have spurred the development of diverse AI applications from code generation and video editing to text generation; however, AI supply chains such as Hugging Face, which host pretrained models and their associated configuration files contributed by the public, face significant security challenges; in particular, configuration files originally intended to set up models by specifying parameters and initial settings can be exploited to execute unauthorized code, yet research has largely overlooked their security compared to that of the models themselves; in this work, we present the first comprehensive study of malicious configurations on Hugging Face, identifying three attack scenarios (file, website, and repository operations) that expose inherent risks; to address these threats, we introduce CONFIGSCAN, an LLM-based tool that analyzes configuration files in the context of their associated runtime code and critical libraries, effectively detecting suspicious elements with low false positive rates and high accuracy; our extensive evaluation uncovers thousands of suspicious repositories and configuration files, underscoring the urgent need for enhanced security validation in AI model hosting platforms.

### Good News for Script Kiddies? Evaluating Large Language Models for   Automated Exploit Generation
**Authors**: David Jin, Qian Fu, Yuekang Li

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T07:15:22Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in code-related tasks, raising concerns about their potential for automated exploit generation (AEG). This paper presents the first systematic study on LLMs' effectiveness in AEG, evaluating both their cooperativeness and technical proficiency. To mitigate dataset bias, we introduce a benchmark with refactored versions of five software security labs. Additionally, we design an LLM-based attacker to systematically prompt LLMs for exploit generation. Our experiments reveal that GPT-4 and GPT-4o exhibit high cooperativeness, comparable to uncensored models, while Llama3 is the most resistant. However, no model successfully generates exploits for refactored labs, though GPT-4o's minimal errors highlight the potential for LLM-driven AEG advancements.

### Efficient Vocabulary-Free Fine-Grained Visual Recognition in the Age of   Multimodal LLMs
**Authors**: Hari Chandana Kuchibhotla, Sai Srinivas Kancheti, Abbavaram Gowtham Reddy, Vineeth N Balasubramanian

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T07:14:58Z

**Summary**: Fine-grained Visual Recognition (FGVR) involves distinguishing between visually similar categories, which is inherently challenging due to subtle inter-class differences and the need for large, expert-annotated datasets. In domains like medical imaging, such curated datasets are unavailable due to issues like privacy concerns and high annotation costs. In such scenarios lacking labeled data, an FGVR model cannot rely on a predefined set of training labels, and hence has an unconstrained output space for predictions. We refer to this task as Vocabulary-Free FGVR (VF-FGVR), where a model must predict labels from an unconstrained output space without prior label information. While recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show potential for VF-FGVR, querying these models for each test input is impractical because of high costs and prohibitive inference times. To address these limitations, we introduce \textbf{Nea}rest-Neighbor Label \textbf{R}efinement (NeaR), a novel approach that fine-tunes a downstream CLIP model using labels generated by an MLLM. Our approach constructs a weakly supervised dataset from a small, unlabeled training set, leveraging MLLMs for label generation. NeaR is designed to handle the noise, stochasticity, and open-endedness inherent in labels generated by MLLMs, and establishes a new benchmark for efficient VF-FGVR.

### Transferable Adversarial Attacks on Black-Box Vision-Language Models
**Authors**: Kai Hu, Weichen Yu, Li Zhang, Alexander Robey, Andy Zou, Chengming Xu, Haoqi Hu, Matt Fredrikson

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T06:51:11Z

**Summary**: Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) are increasingly deployed to offer advanced capabilities on inputs comprising both text and images. While prior research has shown that adversarial attacks can transfer from open-source to proprietary black-box models in text-only and vision-only contexts, the extent and effectiveness of such vulnerabilities remain underexplored for VLLMs. We present a comprehensive analysis demonstrating that targeted adversarial examples are highly transferable to widely-used proprietary VLLMs such as GPT-4o, Claude, and Gemini. We show that attackers can craft perturbations to induce specific attacker-chosen interpretations of visual information, such as misinterpreting hazardous content as safe, overlooking sensitive or restricted material, or generating detailed incorrect responses aligned with the attacker's intent. Furthermore, we discover that universal perturbations -- modifications applicable to a wide set of images -- can consistently induce these misinterpretations across multiple proprietary VLLMs. Our experimental results on object recognition, visual question answering, and image captioning show that this vulnerability is common across current state-of-the-art models, and underscore an urgent need for robust mitigations to ensure the safe and secure deployment of VLLMs.

### Prompt Inversion Attack against Collaborative Inference of Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Wenjie Qu, Yuguang Zhou, Yongji Wu, Tingsong Xiao, Binhang Yuan, Yiming Li, Jiaheng Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T06:50:37Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely applied for their remarkable capability of content generation. However, the practical use of open-source LLMs is hindered by high resource requirements, making deployment expensive and limiting widespread development. The collaborative inference is a promising solution for this problem, in which users collaborate by each hosting a subset of layers and transmitting intermediate activation. Many companies are building collaborative inference platforms to reduce LLM serving costs, leveraging users' underutilized GPUs. Despite widespread interest in collaborative inference within academia and industry, the privacy risks associated with LLM collaborative inference have not been well studied. This is largely because of the challenge posed by inverting LLM activation due to its strong non-linearity.   In this paper, to validate the severity of privacy threats in LLM collaborative inference, we introduce the concept of prompt inversion attack (PIA), where a malicious participant intends to recover the input prompt through the activation transmitted by its previous participant. Extensive experiments show that our PIA method substantially outperforms existing baselines. For example, our method achieves an 88.4\% token accuracy on the Skytrax dataset with the Llama-65B model when inverting the maximum number of transformer layers, while the best baseline method only achieves 22.8\% accuracy. The results verify the effectiveness of our PIA attack and highlights its practical threat to LLM collaborative inference systems.

### Low-Precision Training of Large Language Models: Methods, Challenges,   and Opportunities
**Authors**: Zhiwei Hao, Jianyuan Guo, Li Shen, Yong Luo, Han Hu, Guoxia Wang, Dianhai Yu, Yonggang Wen, Dacheng Tao

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T06:33:25Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across various domains. However, the substantial hardware resources required for their training present a significant barrier to efficiency and scalability. To mitigate this challenge, low-precision training techniques have been widely adopted, leading to notable advancements in training efficiency. Despite these gains, low-precision training involves several components$\unicode{x2013}$such as weights, activations, and gradients$\unicode{x2013}$each of which can be represented in different numerical formats. The resulting diversity has created a fragmented landscape in low-precision training research, making it difficult for researchers to gain a unified overview of the field. This survey provides a comprehensive review of existing low-precision training methods. To systematically organize these approaches, we categorize them into three primary groups based on their underlying numerical formats, which is a key factor influencing hardware compatibility, computational efficiency, and ease of reference for readers. The categories are: (1) fixed-point and integer-based methods, (2) floating-point-based methods, and (3) customized format-based methods. Additionally, we discuss quantization-aware training approaches, which share key similarities with low-precision training during forward propagation. Finally, we highlight several promising research directions to advance this field. A collection of papers discussed in this survey is provided in https://github.com/Hao840/Awesome-Low-Precision-Training.

### Do We Need a Detailed Rubric for Automated Essay Scoring using Large   Language Models?
**Authors**: Lui Yoshida

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T06:17:51Z

**Summary**: This study investigates the necessity and impact of a detailed rubric in automated essay scoring (AES) using large language models (LLMs). While using rubrics are standard in LLM-based AES, creating detailed rubrics requires substantial ef-fort and increases token usage. We examined how different levels of rubric detail affect scoring accuracy across multiple LLMs using the TOEFL11 dataset. Our experiments compared three conditions: a full rubric, a simplified rubric, and no rubric, using four different LLMs (Claude 3.5 Haiku, Gemini 1.5 Flash, GPT-4o-mini, and Llama 3 70B Instruct). Results showed that three out of four models maintained similar scoring accuracy with the simplified rubric compared to the detailed one, while significantly reducing token usage. However, one model (Gemini 1.5 Flash) showed decreased performance with more detailed rubrics. The findings suggest that simplified rubrics may be sufficient for most LLM-based AES applications, offering a more efficient alternative without compromis-ing scoring accuracy. However, model-specific evaluation remains crucial as per-formance patterns vary across different LLMs.

### ICLR: In-Context Learning of Representations
**Authors**: Core Francisco Park, Andrew Lee, Ekdeep Singh Lubana, Yongyi Yang, Maya Okawa, Kento Nishi, Martin Wattenberg, Hidenori Tanaka

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T05:27:38Z

**Summary**: Recent work has demonstrated that semantics specified by pretraining data influence how representations of different concepts are organized in a large language model (LLM). However, given the open-ended nature of LLMs, e.g., their ability to in-context learn, we can ask whether models alter these pretraining semantics to adopt alternative, context-specified ones. Specifically, if we provide in-context exemplars wherein a concept plays a different role than what the pretraining data suggests, do models reorganize their representations in accordance with these novel semantics? To answer this question, we take inspiration from the theory of conceptual role semantics and define a toy "graph tracing" task wherein the nodes of the graph are referenced via concepts seen during training (e.g., apple, bird, etc.) and the connectivity of the graph is defined via some predefined structure (e.g., a square grid). Given exemplars that indicate traces of random walks on the graph, we analyze intermediate representations of the model and find that as the amount of context is scaled, there is a sudden re-organization from pretrained semantic representations to in-context representations aligned with the graph structure. Further, we find that when reference concepts have correlations in their semantics (e.g., Monday, Tuesday, etc.), the context-specified graph structure is still present in the representations, but is unable to dominate the pretrained structure. To explain these results, we analogize our task to energy minimization for a predefined graph topology, providing evidence towards an implicit optimization process to infer context-specified semantics. Overall, our findings indicate scaling context-size can flexibly re-organize model representations, possibly unlocking novel capabilities.

### Value Portrait: Understanding Values of LLMs with Human-aligned   Benchmark
**Authors**: Jongwook Han, Dongmin Choi, Woojung Song, Eun-Ju Lee, Yohan Jo

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T05:26:50Z

**Summary**: The importance of benchmarks for assessing the values of language models has been pronounced due to the growing need of more authentic, human-aligned responses. However, existing benchmarks rely on human or machine annotations that are vulnerable to value-related biases. Furthermore, the tested scenarios often diverge from real-world contexts in which models are commonly used to generate text and express values. To address these issues, we propose the Value Portrait benchmark, a reliable framework for evaluating LLMs' value orientations with two key characteristics. First, the benchmark consists of items that capture real-life user-LLM interactions, enhancing the relevance of assessment results to real-world LLM usage and thus ecological validity. Second, each item is rated by human subjects based on its similarity to their own thoughts, and correlations between these ratings and the subjects' actual value scores are derived. This psychometrically validated approach ensures that items strongly correlated with specific values serve as reliable items for assessing those values. Through evaluating 27 LLMs with our benchmark, we find that these models prioritize Benevolence, Security, and Self-Direction values while placing less emphasis on Tradition, Power, and Achievement values. Also, our analysis reveals biases in how LLMs perceive various demographic groups, deviating from real human data.

### Improving Large Language Model Planning with Action Sequence Similarity
**Authors**: Xinran Zhao, Hanie Sedghi, Bernd Bohnet, Dale Schuurmans, Azade Nova

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T05:16:17Z

**Summary**: Planning is essential for artificial intelligence systems to look ahead and proactively determine a course of actions to reach objectives in the virtual and real world. Recent work on large language models (LLMs) sheds light on their planning capability in various tasks. However, it remains unclear what signals in the context influence the model performance. In this work, we explore how to improve the model planning capability through in-context learning (ICL), specifically, what signals can help select the exemplars. Through extensive experiments, we observe that commonly used problem similarity may result in false positives with drastically different plans, which can mislead the model. In response, we propose to sample and filter exemplars leveraging plan side action sequence similarity (AS). We propose GRASE-DC: a two-stage pipeline that first re-samples high AS exemplars and then curates the selected exemplars with dynamic clustering on AS to achieve a balance of relevance and diversity. Our experimental result confirms that GRASE-DC achieves significant performance improvement on various planning tasks (up to ~11-40 point absolute accuracy improvement with 27.3% fewer exemplars needed on average). With GRASE-DC* + VAL, where we iteratively apply GRASE-DC with a validator, we are able to even boost the performance by 18.9% more.   Extensive analysis validates the consistent performance improvement of GRASE-DC with various backbone LLMs and on both classical planning and natural language planning benchmarks. GRASE-DC can further boost the planning accuracy by ~24 absolute points on harder problems using simpler problems as exemplars over a random baseline. This demonstrates its ability to generalize to out-of-distribution problems.

### Rethinking Scientific Summarization Evaluation: Grounding Explainable   Metrics on Facet-aware Benchmark
**Authors**: Xiuying Chen, Tairan Wang, Qingqing Zhu, Taicheng Guo, Shen Gao, Zhiyong Lu, Xin Gao, Xiangliang Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T05:08:48Z

**Summary**: The summarization capabilities of pretrained and large language models (LLMs) have been widely validated in general areas, but their use in scientific corpus, which involves complex sentences and specialized knowledge, has been less assessed. This paper presents conceptual and experimental analyses of scientific summarization, highlighting the inadequacies of traditional evaluation methods, such as $n$-gram, embedding comparison, and QA, particularly in providing explanations, grasping scientific concepts, or identifying key content. Subsequently, we introduce the Facet-aware Metric (FM), employing LLMs for advanced semantic matching to evaluate summaries based on different aspects. This facet-aware approach offers a thorough evaluation of abstracts by decomposing the evaluation task into simpler subtasks.Recognizing the absence of an evaluation benchmark in this domain, we curate a Facet-based scientific summarization Dataset (FD) with facet-level annotations. Our findings confirm that FM offers a more logical approach to evaluating scientific summaries. In addition, fine-tuned smaller models can compete with LLMs in scientific contexts, while LLMs have limitations in learning from in-context information in scientific domains. This suggests an area for future enhancement of LLMs.

### Optimizing Indoor Farm Monitoring Efficiency Using UAV: Yield Estimation   in a GNSS-Denied Cherry Tomato Greenhouse
**Authors**: Taewook Park, Jinwoo Lee, Hyondong Oh, Won-Jae Yun, Kyu-Wha Lee

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T04:41:57Z

**Summary**: As the agricultural workforce declines and labor costs rise, robotic yield estimation has become increasingly important. While unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) are commonly used for indoor farm monitoring, their deployment in greenhouses is often constrained by infrastructure limitations, sensor placement challenges, and operational inefficiencies. To address these issues, we develop a lightweight unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipped with an RGB-D camera, a 3D LiDAR, and an IMU sensor. The UAV employs a LiDAR-inertial odometry algorithm for precise navigation in GNSS-denied environments and utilizes a 3D multi-object tracking algorithm to estimate the count and weight of cherry tomatoes. We evaluate the system using two dataset: one from a harvesting row and another from a growing row. In the harvesting-row dataset, the proposed system achieves 94.4\% counting accuracy and 87.5\% weight estimation accuracy within a 13.2-meter flight completed in 10.5 seconds. For the growing-row dataset, which consists of occluded unripened fruits, we qualitatively analyze tracking performance and highlight future research directions for improving perception in greenhouse with strong occlusions. Our findings demonstrate the potential of UAVs for efficient robotic yield estimation in commercial greenhouses.

### VTS-LLM: Domain-Adaptive LLM Agent for Enhancing Awareness in Vessel   Traffic Services through Natural Language
**Authors**: Sijin Sun, Liangbin Zhao, Ming Deng, Xiuju Fu

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T04:27:50Z

**Summary**: Vessel Traffic Services (VTS) are essential for maritime safety and regulatory compliance through real-time traffic management. However, with increasing traffic complexity and the prevalence of heterogeneous, multimodal data, existing VTS systems face limitations in spatiotemporal reasoning and intuitive human interaction. In this work, we propose VTS-LLM Agent, the first domain-adaptive large LLM agent tailored for interactive decision support in VTS operations. We formalize risk-prone vessel identification as a knowledge-augmented Text-to-SQL task, combining structured vessel databases with external maritime knowledge. To support this, we construct a curated benchmark dataset consisting of a custom schema, domain-specific corpus, and a query-SQL test set in multiple linguistic styles. Our framework incorporates NER-based relational reasoning, agent-based domain knowledge injection, semantic algebra intermediate representation, and query rethink mechanisms to enhance domain grounding and context-aware understanding. Experimental results show that VTS-LLM outperforms both general-purpose and SQL-focused baselines under command-style, operational-style, and formal natural language queries, respectively. Moreover, our analysis provides the first empirical evidence that linguistic style variation introduces systematic performance challenges in Text-to-SQL modeling. This work lays the foundation for natural language interfaces in vessel traffic services and opens new opportunities for proactive, LLM-driven maritime real-time traffic management.

### Position: Enough of Scaling LLMs! Lets Focus on Downscaling
**Authors**: Ayan Sengupta, Yash Goel, Tanmoy Chakraborty

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T04:13:27Z

**Summary**: We challenge the dominant focus on neural scaling laws and advocate for a paradigm shift toward downscaling in the development of large language models (LLMs). While scaling laws have provided critical insights into performance improvements through increasing model and dataset size, we emphasize the significant limitations of this approach, particularly in terms of computational inefficiency, environmental impact, and deployment constraints. To address these challenges, we propose a holistic framework for downscaling LLMs that seeks to maintain performance while drastically reducing resource demands. This paper outlines practical strategies for transitioning away from traditional scaling paradigms, advocating for a more sustainable, efficient, and accessible approach to LLM development.

### Multi-agents based User Values Mining for Recommendation
**Authors**: Lijian Chen, Wei Yuan, Tong Chen, Xiangyu Zhao, Nguyen Quoc Viet Hung, Hongzhi Yin

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T04:01:31Z

**Summary**: Recommender systems have rapidly evolved and become integral to many online services. However, existing systems sometimes produce unstable and unsatisfactory recommendations that fail to align with users' fundamental and long-term preferences. This is because they primarily focus on extracting shallow and short-term interests from user behavior data, which is inherently dynamic and challenging to model. Unlike these transient interests, user values are more stable and play a crucial role in shaping user behaviors, such as purchasing items and consuming content. Incorporating user values into recommender systems can help stabilize recommendation performance and ensure results better reflect users' latent preferences. However, acquiring user values is typically difficult and costly. To address this challenge, we leverage the strong language understanding, zero-shot inference, and generalization capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract user values from users' historical interactions. Unfortunately, direct extraction using LLMs presents several challenges such as length constraints and hallucination. To overcome these issues, we propose ZOOM, a zero-shot multi-LLM collaborative framework for effective and accurate user value extraction. In ZOOM, we apply text summarization techniques to condense item content while preserving essential meaning. To mitigate hallucinations, ZOOM introduces two specialized agent roles: evaluators and supervisors, to collaboratively generate accurate user values. Extensive experiments on two widely used recommendation datasets with two state-of-the-art recommendation models demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our framework in automatic user value mining and recommendation performance improvement.

### LMDepth: Lightweight Mamba-based Monocular Depth Estimation for   Real-World Deployment
**Authors**: Jiahuan Long, Xin Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T04:00:03Z

**Summary**: Monocular depth estimation provides an additional depth dimension to RGB images, making it widely applicable in various fields such as virtual reality, autonomous driving and robotic navigation. However, existing depth estimation algorithms often struggle to effectively balance performance and computational efficiency, which poses challenges for deployment on resource-constrained devices. To address this, we propose LMDepth, a lightweight Mamba-based monocular depth estimation network, designed to reconstruct high-precision depth information while maintaining low computational overhead. Specifically, we propose a modified pyramid spatial pooling module that serves as a multi-scale feature aggregator and context extractor, ensuring global spatial information for accurate depth estimation. Moreover, we integrate multiple depth Mamba blocks into the decoder. Designed with linear computations, the Mamba Blocks enable LMDepth to efficiently decode depth information from global features, providing a lightweight alternative to Transformer-based architectures that depend on complex attention mechanisms. Extensive experiments on the NYUDv2 and KITTI datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed LMDepth. Compared to previous lightweight depth estimation methods, LMDepth achieves higher performance with fewer parameters and lower computational complexity (measured by GFLOPs). We further deploy LMDepth on an embedded platform with INT8 quantization, validating its practicality for real-world edge applications.

### Synthesize-on-Graph: Knowledgeable Synthetic Data Generation for   Continue Pre-training of Large Language Models
**Authors**: Xuhui Jiang, Shengjie Ma, Chengjin Xu, Cehao Yang, Liyu Zhang, Jian Guo

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T03:40:39Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success but remain data-inefficient, especially when learning from small, specialized corpora with limited and proprietary data. Existing synthetic data generation methods for continue pre-training focus on intra-document content and overlook cross-document knowledge associations, limiting content diversity and depth. We propose Synthetic-on-Graph (SoG), a synthetic data generation framework that incorporates cross-document knowledge associations for efficient corpus expansion. SoG constructs a context graph by extracting entities and concepts from the original corpus, representing cross-document associations, and employing a graph walk strategy for knowledge-associated sampling. This enhances synthetic data diversity and coherence, enabling models to learn complex knowledge structures and handle rare knowledge. To further improve synthetic data quality, we integrate Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Contrastive Clarifying (CC) synthetic, enhancing reasoning processes and discriminative power. Experiments show that SoG outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) method in a multi-hop document Q&A dataset while performing comparably to the SOTA method on the reading comprehension task datasets, which also underscores the better generalization capability of SoG. Our work advances synthetic data generation and provides practical solutions for efficient knowledge acquisition in LLMs, especially in domains with limited data availability.

**Authors**: Zhiyu Liao, Kang Chen, Yuanguo Lin, Kangkang Li, Yunxuan Liu, Hefeng Chen, Xingwang Huang, Yuanhui Yu

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T03:37:52Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become central to numerous natural language processing tasks, but their vulnerabilities present significant security and ethical challenges. This systematic survey explores the evolving landscape of attack and defense techniques in LLMs. We classify attacks into adversarial prompt attack, optimized attacks, model theft, as well as attacks on application of LLMs, detailing their mechanisms and implications. Consequently, we analyze defense strategies, including prevention-based and detection-based defense methods. Although advances have been made, challenges remain to adapt to the dynamic threat landscape, balance usability with robustness, and address resource constraints in defense implementation. We highlight open problems, including the need for adaptive scalable defenses, explainable security techniques, and standardized evaluation frameworks. This survey provides actionable insights and directions for developing secure and resilient LLMs, emphasizing the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration and ethical considerations to mitigate risks in real-world applications.

### Generating Animated Layouts as Structured Text Representations
**Authors**: Yeonsang Shin, Jihwan Kim, Yumin Song, Kyungseung Lee, Hyunhee Chung, Taeyoung Na

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T03:37:09Z

**Summary**: Despite the remarkable progress in text-to-video models, achieving precise control over text elements and animated graphics remains a significant challenge, especially in applications such as video advertisements. To address this limitation, we introduce Animated Layout Generation, a novel approach to extend static graphic layouts with temporal dynamics. We propose a Structured Text Representation for fine-grained video control through hierarchical visual elements. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we present VAKER (Video Ad maKER), a text-to-video advertisement generation pipeline that combines a three-stage generation process with Unstructured Text Reasoning for seamless integration with LLMs. VAKER fully automates video advertisement generation by incorporating dynamic layout trajectories for objects and graphics across specific video frames. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that VAKER significantly outperforms existing methods in generating video advertisements. Project Page: https://yeonsangshin.github.io/projects/Vaker

### Seeking to Collide: Online Safety-Critical Scenario Generation for   Autonomous Driving with Retrieval Augmented Large Language Models
**Authors**: Yuewen Mei, Tong Nie, Jian Sun, Ye Tian

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T03:22:00Z

**Summary**: Simulation-based testing is crucial for validating autonomous vehicles (AVs), yet existing scenario generation methods either overfit to common driving patterns or operate in an offline, non-interactive manner that fails to expose rare, safety-critical corner cases. In this paper, we introduce an online, retrieval-augmented large language model (LLM) framework for generating safety-critical driving scenarios. Our method first employs an LLM-based behavior analyzer to infer the most dangerous intent of the background vehicle from the observed state, then queries additional LLM agents to synthesize feasible adversarial trajectories. To mitigate catastrophic forgetting and accelerate adaptation, we augment the framework with a dynamic memorization and retrieval bank of intent-planner pairs, automatically expanding its behavioral library when novel intents arise. Evaluations using the Waymo Open Motion Dataset demonstrate that our model reduces the mean minimum time-to-collision from 1.62 to 1.08 s and incurs a 75% collision rate, substantially outperforming baselines.

**Authors**: Ziyuan Huang, Vishaldeep Kaur Sekhon, Roozbeh Sadeghian, Maria L. Vaida, Cynthia Jo, Doyle Ward, Vanni Bucci, John P. Haran

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T03:07:14Z

**Summary**: Alzheimer's Disease Analysis Model (ADAM) is a multi-agent reasoning large language model (LLM) framework designed to integrate and analyze multimodal data, including microbiome profiles, clinical datasets, and external knowledge bases, to enhance the understanding and classification of Alzheimer's disease (AD). By leveraging the agentic system with LLM, ADAM produces insights from diverse data sources and contextualizes the findings with literature-driven evidence. A comparative evaluation with XGBoost revealed a significantly improved mean F1 score and significantly reduced variance for ADAM, highlighting its robustness and consistency, particularly when utilizing human biological data. Although currently tailored for binary classification tasks with two data modalities, future iterations will aim to incorporate additional data types, such as neuroimaging and peripheral biomarkers, and expand them to predict disease progression, thereby broadening ADAM's scalability and applicability in AD research and diagnostic applications.

### Sentiment and Social Signals in the Climate Crisis: A Survey on   Analyzing Social Media Responses to Extreme Weather Events
**Authors**: Pouya Shaeri, Yasaman Mohammadpour, Alimohammad Beigi, Ariane Middel, Huan Liu

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T02:39:09Z

**Summary**: Extreme weather events driven by climate change, such as wildfires, floods, and heatwaves, prompt significant public reactions on social media platforms. Analyzing the sentiment expressed in these online discussions can offer valuable insights into public perception, inform policy decisions, and enhance emergency responses. Although sentiment analysis has been widely studied in various fields, its specific application to climate-induced events, particularly in real-time, high-impact situations like the 2025 Los Angeles forest fires, remains underexplored. In this survey, we thoroughly examine the methods, datasets, challenges, and ethical considerations related to sentiment analysis of social media content concerning weather and climate change events. We present a detailed taxonomy of approaches, ranging from lexicon-based and machine learning models to the latest strategies driven by large language models (LLMs). Additionally, we discuss data collection and annotation techniques, including weak supervision and real-time event tracking. Finally, we highlight several open problems, such as misinformation detection, multimodal sentiment extraction, and model alignment with human values. Our goal is to guide researchers and practitioners in effectively understanding sentiment during the climate crisis era.

### Dynamics of Spontaneous Topic Changes in Next Token Prediction with   Self-Attention
**Authors**: Mumin Jia, Jairo Diaz-Rodriguez

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T02:25:37Z

**Summary**: Human cognition is punctuated by abrupt, spontaneous shifts between topics-driven by emotional, contextual, or associative cues-a phenomenon known as spontaneous thought in neuroscience. In contrast, self-attention based models depend on structured patterns over their inputs to predict each next token, lacking spontaneity. Motivated by this distinction, we characterize spontaneous topic changes in self-attention architectures, revealing both their similarities and their divergences from spontaneous human thought. First, we establish theoretical results under a simplified, single-layer self-attention model with suitable conditions by defining the topic as a set of Token Priority Graphs (TPGs). Specifically, we demonstrate that (1) the model maintains the priority order of tokens related to the input topic, (2) a spontaneous topic change can occur only if lower-priority tokens outnumber all higher-priority tokens of the input topic, and (3) unlike human cognition, the longer context length or the more ambiguous input topic reduces the likelihood of spontaneous change. Second, we empirically validate that these dynamics persist in modern, state-of-the-art LLMs, underscoring a fundamental disparity between human cognition and AI behaviour in the context of spontaneous topic changes. To the best of our knowledge, no prior work has explored these questions with a focus as closely aligned to human thought.

### Preserving Privacy and Utility in LLM-Based Product Recommendations
**Authors**: Tina Khezresmaeilzadeh, Jiang Zhang, Dimitrios Andreadis, Konstantinos Psounis

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T01:54:08Z

**Summary**: Large Language Model (LLM)-based recommendation systems leverage powerful language models to generate personalized suggestions by processing user interactions and preferences. Unlike traditional recommendation systems that rely on structured data and collaborative filtering, LLM-based models process textual and contextual information, often using cloud-based infrastructure. This raises privacy concerns, as user data is transmitted to remote servers, increasing the risk of exposure and reducing control over personal information. To address this, we propose a hybrid privacy-preserving recommendation framework which separates sensitive from nonsensitive data and only shares the latter with the cloud to harness LLM-powered recommendations. To restore lost recommendations related to obfuscated sensitive data, we design a de-obfuscation module that reconstructs sensitive recommendations locally. Experiments on real-world e-commerce datasets show that our framework achieves almost the same recommendation utility with a system which shares all data with an LLM, while preserving privacy to a large extend. Compared to obfuscation-only techniques, our approach improves HR@10 scores and category distribution alignment, offering a better balance between privacy and recommendation quality. Furthermore, our method runs efficiently on consumer-grade hardware, making privacy-aware LLM-based recommendation systems practical for real-world use.

### SSRLBot: Designing and Developing an LLM-based Agent using Socially   Shared Regulated Learning
**Authors**: Xiaoshan Huang, Jie Gao, Haolun Wu

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T01:17:03Z

**Summary**: Large language model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly used to support human experts by streamlining complex tasks and offering actionable insights. However, their application in multi-professional decision-making, particularly in teamwork contexts, remains underexplored. This design-based study addresses that gap by developing LLM functions to enhance collaboration, grounded in the Socially Shared Regulation of Learning (SSRL) framework and applied to medical diagnostic teamwork. SSRL emphasizes metacognitive, cognitive, motivational, and emotional processes in shared learning, focusing on how teams manage these processes to improve decision-making. This paper introduces SSRLBot, a prototype chatbot designed to help team members reflect on both their diagnostic performance and key SSRL skills. Its core functions include summarizing dialogues, analyzing SSRL behaviors, evaluating diagnostic outcomes, annotating SSRL markers in conversation, assessing their impact on performance, and identifying interpersonal regulatory dynamics. We compare SSRLBot's capabilities with those of Gemini-1.5, GPT-3.5, and Deepseek-R1 in a case study. SSRLBot demonstrates stronger alignment with SSRL theory, offering detailed evaluations that link behaviors to regulatory dimensions and suggesting improvements for collaboration. By integrating SSRL theory with LLM capabilities, SSRLBot contributes a novel tool for enhancing team-based decision-making and collaborative learning in high-stakes environments, such as medical education.

### Reward-Augmented Data Enhances Direct Preference Alignment of LLMs
**Authors**: Shenao Zhang, Zhihan Liu, Boyi Liu, Yufeng Zhang, Yingxiang Yang, Yongfei Liu, Liyu Chen, Tao Sun, Zhaoran Wang

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T01:10:28Z

**Summary**: Preference alignment in Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly improved their ability to adhere to human instructions and intentions. However, existing direct alignment algorithms primarily focus on relative preferences and often overlook the qualitative aspects of responses, despite having access to preference data that includes reward scores from judge models during AI feedback. Striving to maximize the implicit reward gap between the chosen and the slightly inferior rejected responses can cause overfitting and unnecessary unlearning of the high-quality rejected responses. The unawareness of the reward scores also drives the LLM to indiscriminately favor the low-quality chosen responses and fail to generalize to optimal responses that are sparse in data. To overcome these shortcomings, our study introduces reward-conditioned LLM policies that discern and learn from the entire spectrum of response quality within the dataset, helping extrapolate to more optimal regions. We propose an effective yet simple data relabeling method that conditions the preference pairs on quality scores to construct a reward-augmented dataset. The experiments across various benchmarks and diverse models demonstrate that our approach consistently boosts DPO by a considerable margin. Through comprehensive ablation studies, we demonstrate that our method not only maximizes the utility of preference data but also mitigates the issue of unlearning, demonstrating its broad effectiveness beyond mere data expansion. Our code is available at https://github.com/shenao-zhang/reward-augmented-preference.

### Autonomous Embodied Agents: When Robotics Meets Deep Learning Reasoning
**Authors**: Roberto Bigazzi

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T00:43:28Z

**Summary**: The increase in available computing power and the Deep Learning revolution have allowed the exploration of new topics and frontiers in Artificial Intelligence research. A new field called Embodied Artificial Intelligence, which places at the intersection of Computer Vision, Robotics, and Decision Making, has been gaining importance during the last few years, as it aims to foster the development of smart autonomous robots and their deployment in society. The recent availability of large collections of 3D models for photorealistic robotic simulation has allowed faster and safe training of learning-based agents for millions of frames and a careful evaluation of their behavior before deploying the models on real robotic platforms. These intelligent agents are intended to perform a certain task in a possibly unknown environment. To this end, during the training in simulation, the agents learn to perform continuous interactions with the surroundings, such as gathering information from the environment, encoding and extracting useful cues for the task, and performing actions towards the final goal; where every action of the agent influences the interactions. This dissertation follows the complete creation process of embodied agents for indoor environments, from their concept to their implementation and deployment. We aim to contribute to research in Embodied AI and autonomous agents, in order to foster future work in this field. We present a detailed analysis of the procedure behind implementing an intelligent embodied agent, comprehending a thorough description of the current state-of-the-art in literature, technical explanations of the proposed methods, and accurate experimental studies on relevant robotic tasks.

### A Self-Supervised Transformer for Unusable Shared Bike Detection
**Authors**: Yin Huang, Yongqi Dong, Youhua Tang, Alvaro García Hernandez

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T00:20:38Z

**Summary**: The rapid expansion of bike-sharing systems (BSS) has greatly improved urban "last-mile" connectivity, yet large-scale deployments face escalating operational challenges, particularly in detecting faulty bikes. Existing detection approaches either rely on static model-based thresholds that overlook dynamic spatiotemporal (ST) usage patterns or employ supervised learning methods that struggle with label scarcity and class imbalance. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel Self-Supervised Transformer (SSTransformer) framework for automatically detecting unusable shared bikes, leveraging ST features extracted from GPS trajectories and trip records. The model incorporates a self-supervised pre-training strategy to enhance its feature extraction capabilities, followed by fine-tuning for efficient status recognition. In the pre-training phase, the Transformer encoder learns generalized representations of bike movement via a self-supervised objective; in the fine-tuning phase, the encoder is adapted to a downstream binary classification task. Comprehensive experiments on a real-world dataset of 10,730 bikes (1,870 unusable, 8,860 normal) from Chengdu, China, demonstrate that SSTransformer significantly outperforms traditional machine learning, ensemble learning, and deep learning baselines, achieving the best accuracy (97.81%), precision (0.8889), and F1-score (0.9358). This work highlights the effectiveness of self-supervised Transformer on ST data for capturing complex anomalies in BSS, paving the way toward more reliable and scalable maintenance solutions for shared mobility.

### Large Language Model-Driven Dynamic Assessment of Grammatical Accuracy   in English Language Learner Writing
**Authors**: Timur Jaganov, John Blake, Julián Villegas, Nicholas Carr

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T00:19:50Z

**Summary**: This study investigates the potential for Large Language Models (LLMs) to scale-up Dynamic Assessment (DA). To facilitate such an investigation, we first developed DynaWrite-a modular, microservices-based grammatical tutoring application which supports multiple LLMs to generate dynamic feedback to learners of English. Initial testing of 21 LLMs, revealed GPT-4o and neural chat to have the most potential to scale-up DA in the language learning classroom. Further testing of these two candidates found both models performed similarly in their ability to accurately identify grammatical errors in user sentences. However, GPT-4o consistently outperformed neural chat in the quality of its DA by generating clear, consistent, and progressively explicit hints. Real-time responsiveness and system stability were also confirmed through detailed performance testing, with GPT-4o exhibiting sufficient speed and stability. This study shows that LLMs can be used to scale-up dynamic assessment and thus enable dynamic assessment to be delivered to larger groups than possible in traditional teacher-learner settings.

### AutoPrep: Natural Language Question-Aware Data Preparation with a   Multi-Agent Framework
**Authors**: Meihao Fan, Ju Fan, Nan Tang, Lei Cao, Guoliang Li, Xiaoyong Du

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T00:11:48Z

**Summary**: Answering natural language (NL) questions about tables, known as Tabular Question Answering (TQA), is crucial because it allows users to quickly and efficiently extract meaningful insights from structured data, effectively bridging the gap between human language and machine-readable formats. Many of these tables are derived from web sources or real-world scenarios, which require meticulous data preparation (or data prep) to ensure accurate responses. However, preparing such tables for NL questions introduces new requirements that extend beyond traditional data preparation. This question-aware data preparation involves specific tasks such as column derivation and filtering tailored to particular questions, as well as question-aware value normalization or conversion, highlighting the need for a more nuanced approach in this context. Because each of the above tasks is unique, a single model (or agent) may not perform effectively across all scenarios. In this paper, we propose AutoPrep, a large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent framework that leverages the strengths of multiple agents, each specialized in a certain type of data prep, ensuring more accurate and contextually relevant responses. Given an NL question over a table, AutoPrep performs data prep through three key components. Planner: Determines a logical plan, outlining a sequence of high-level operations. Programmer: Translates this logical plan into a physical plan by generating the corresponding low-level code. Executor: Executes the generated code to process the table. To support this multi-agent framework, we design a novel Chain-of-Clauses reasoning mechanism for high-level operation suggestion, and a tool-augmented method for low-level code generation...

### How Transformers Learn Regular Language Recognition: A Theoretical Study   on Training Dynamics and Implicit Bias
**Authors**: Ruiquan Huang, Yingbin Liang, Jing Yang

**Updated**: 2025-05-02T00:07:35Z

**Summary**: Language recognition tasks are fundamental in natural language processing (NLP) and have been widely used to benchmark the performance of large language models (LLMs). These tasks also play a crucial role in explaining the working mechanisms of transformers. In this work, we focus on two representative tasks in the category of regular language recognition, known as `even pairs' and `parity check', the aim of which is to determine whether the occurrences of certain subsequences in a given sequence are even. Our goal is to explore how a one-layer transformer, consisting of an attention layer followed by a linear layer, learns to solve these tasks by theoretically analyzing its training dynamics under gradient descent. While even pairs can be solved directly by a one-layer transformer, parity check need to be solved by integrating Chain-of-Thought (CoT), either into the inference stage of a transformer well-trained for the even pairs task, or into the training of a one-layer transformer. For both problems, our analysis shows that the joint training of attention and linear layers exhibits two distinct phases. In the first phase, the attention layer grows rapidly, mapping data sequences into separable vectors. In the second phase, the attention layer becomes stable, while the linear layer grows logarithmically and approaches in direction to a max-margin hyperplane that correctly separates the attention layer outputs into positive and negative samples, and the loss decreases at a rate of $O(1/t)$. Our experiments validate those theoretical results.

### Should you use LLMs to simulate opinions? Quality checks for early-stage   deliberation
**Authors**: Terrence Neumann, Maria De-Arteaga, Sina Fazelpour

**Updated**: 2025-05-01T23:50:29Z

**Summary**: The emergent capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have sparked interest in assessing their ability to simulate human opinions in a variety of contexts, potentially serving as surrogates for human subjects in opinion surveys. However, previous evaluations of this capability have depended heavily on costly, domain-specific human survey data, and mixed empirical results about LLM effectiveness create uncertainty for managers about whether investing in this technology is justified in early-stage research. To address these challenges, we introduce a series of quality checks to support early-stage deliberation about the viability of using LLMs for simulating human opinions. These checks emphasize logical constraints, model stability, and alignment with stakeholder expectations of model outputs, thereby reducing dependence on human-generated data in the initial stages of evaluation. We demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed quality control tests in the context of AI-assisted content moderation, an application that both advocates and critics of LLMs' capabilities to simulate human opinion see as a desirable potential use case. None of the tested models passed all quality control checks, revealing several failure modes. We conclude by discussing implications of these failure modes and recommend how organizations can utilize our proposed tests for prompt engineering and in their risk management practices when considering the use of LLMs for opinion simulation. We make our crowdsourced dataset of claims with human and LLM annotations publicly available for future research.

### Multivariate Conformal Selection
**Authors**: Tian Bai, Yue Zhao, Xiang Yu, Archer Y. Yang

**Updated**: 2025-05-01T23:33:57Z

**Summary**: Selecting high-quality candidates from large datasets is critical in applications such as drug discovery, precision medicine, and alignment of large language models (LLMs). While Conformal Selection (CS) provides rigorous uncertainty quantification, it is limited to univariate responses and scalar criteria. To address this issue, we propose Multivariate Conformal Selection (mCS), a generalization of CS designed for multivariate response settings. Our method introduces regional monotonicity and employs multivariate nonconformity scores to construct conformal p-values, enabling finite-sample False Discovery Rate (FDR) control. We present two variants: mCS-dist, using distance-based scores, and mCS-learn, which learns optimal scores via differentiable optimization. Experiments on simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate that mCS significantly improves selection power while maintaining FDR control, establishing it as a robust framework for multivariate selection tasks.

### Accuracy is Not Agreement: Expert-Aligned Evaluation of Crash Narrative   Classification Models
**Authors**: Sudesh Ramesh Bhagat, Ibne Farabi Shihab, Anuj Sharma

**Updated**: 2025-05-01T23:02:35Z

**Summary**: This study investigates the relationship between deep learning (DL) model accuracy and expert agreement in classifying crash narratives. We evaluate five DL models -- including BERT variants, USE, and a zero-shot classifier -- against expert labels and narratives, and extend the analysis to four large language models (LLMs): GPT-4, LLaMA 3, Qwen, and Claude. Our findings reveal an inverse relationship: models with higher technical accuracy often show lower agreement with human experts, while LLMs demonstrate stronger expert alignment despite lower accuracy. We use Cohen's Kappa and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to quantify and visualize model-expert agreement, and employ SHAP analysis to explain misclassifications. Results show that expert-aligned models rely more on contextual and temporal cues than location-specific keywords. These findings suggest that accuracy alone is insufficient for safety-critical NLP tasks. We argue for incorporating expert agreement into model evaluation frameworks and highlight the potential of LLMs as interpretable tools in crash analysis pipelines.

### NeMo-Inspector: A Visualization Tool for LLM Generation Analysis
**Authors**: Daria Gitman, Igor Gitman, Evelina Bakhturina

**Updated**: 2025-05-01T22:47:06Z

**Summary**: Adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) to novel tasks and enhancing their overall capabilities often requires large, high-quality training datasets. Synthetic data, generated at scale, serves a valuable alternative when real-world data is scarce or difficult to obtain. However, ensuring the quality of synthetic datasets is challenging, as developers must manually inspect and refine numerous samples to identify errors and areas for improvement. This process is time-consuming and requires specialized tools. We introduce NeMo-Inspector, an open-source tool designed to simplify the analysis of synthetic datasets with integrated inference capabilities. We demonstrate its effectiveness through two real-world cases. Analysis and cleaning of the synthetically generated GSM-Plus dataset with NeMo-Inspector led to a significant decrease in low-quality samples from 46.99% to 19.51%. The tool also helped identify and correct generation errors in OpenMath models, improving accuracy by 1.92% on the MATH dataset and by 4.17% on the GSM8K dataset for a Meta-Llama-3-8B model fine-tuned on synthetic data generated from Nemotron-4-340B.

### Steering Away from Harm: An Adaptive Approach to Defending Vision   Language Model Against Jailbreaks
**Authors**: Han Wang, Gang Wang, Huan Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-05-01T22:22:43Z

**Summary**: Vision Language Models (VLMs) can produce unintended and harmful content when exposed to adversarial attacks, particularly because their vision capabilities create new vulnerabilities. Existing defenses, such as input preprocessing, adversarial training, and response evaluation-based methods, are often impractical for real-world deployment due to their high costs. To address this challenge, we propose ASTRA, an efficient and effective defense by adaptively steering models away from adversarial feature directions to resist VLM attacks. Our key procedures involve finding transferable steering vectors representing the direction of harmful response and applying adaptive activation steering to remove these directions at inference time. To create effective steering vectors, we randomly ablate the visual tokens from the adversarial images and identify those most strongly associated with jailbreaks. These tokens are then used to construct steering vectors. During inference, we perform the adaptive steering method that involves the projection between the steering vectors and calibrated activation, resulting in little performance drops on benign inputs while strongly avoiding harmful outputs under adversarial inputs. Extensive experiments across multiple models and baselines demonstrate our state-of-the-art performance and high efficiency in mitigating jailbreak risks. Additionally, ASTRA exhibits good transferability, defending against unseen attacks (i.e., structured-based attack, perturbation-based attack with project gradient descent variants, and text-only attack). Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/ASTRAL-Group/ASTRA}.

### A Multi-Language Perspective on the Robustness of LLM Code Generation
**Authors**: Fazle Rabbi, Zishuo Ding, Jinqiu Yang

**Updated**: 2025-05-01T22:17:01Z

**Summary**: Large language models have gained significant traction and popularity in recent times, extending their usage to code-generation tasks. While this field has garnered considerable attention, the exploration of testing and evaluating the robustness of code generation models remains an ongoing endeavor. Previous studies have primarily focused on code generation models specifically for the Python language, overlooking other widely used programming languages. In this research, we conduct a comprehensive comparative analysis to assess the robustness performance of several prominent code generation models. Furthermore, we investigate how their performance varies across different programming languages. To accomplish this, we introduce perturbations in four key areas of the prompt: DocString, function name, syntax, and format. We have compiled and released a dedicated dataset for this purpose. This work presents our experimental findings, shedding light on the performance of code generation models in various scenarios.

### Towards Explainable Temporal User Profiling with LLMs
**Authors**: Milad Sabouri, Masoud Mansoury, Kun Lin, Bamshad Mobasher

**Updated**: 2025-05-01T22:02:46Z

**Summary**: Accurately modeling user preferences is vital not only for improving recommendation performance but also for enhancing transparency in recommender systems. Conventional user profiling methods, such as averaging item embeddings, often overlook the evolving, nuanced nature of user interests, particularly the interplay between short-term and long-term preferences. In this work, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate natural language summaries of users' interaction histories, distinguishing recent behaviors from more persistent tendencies. Our framework not only models temporal user preferences but also produces natural language profiles that can be used to explain recommendations in an interpretable manner. These textual profiles are encoded via a pre-trained model, and an attention mechanism dynamically fuses the short-term and long-term embeddings into a comprehensive user representation. Beyond boosting recommendation accuracy over multiple baselines, our approach naturally supports explainability: the interpretable text summaries and attention weights can be exposed to end users, offering insights into why specific items are suggested. Experiments on real-world datasets underscore both the performance gains and the promise of generating clearer, more transparent justifications for content-based recommendations.

### Thoughts without Thinking: Reconsidering the Explanatory Value of   Chain-of-Thought Reasoning in LLMs through Agentic Pipelines
**Authors**: Ramesh Manuvinakurike, Emanuel Moss, Elizabeth Anne Watkins, Saurav Sahay, Giuseppe Raffa, Lama Nachman

**Updated**: 2025-05-01T21:37:30Z

**Summary**: Agentic pipelines present novel challenges and opportunities for human-centered explainability. The HCXAI community is still grappling with how best to make the inner workings of LLMs transparent in actionable ways. Agentic pipelines consist of multiple LLMs working in cooperation with minimal human control. In this research paper, we present early findings from an agentic pipeline implementation of a perceptive task guidance system. Through quantitative and qualitative analysis, we analyze how Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, a common vehicle for explainability in LLMs, operates within agentic pipelines. We demonstrate that CoT reasoning alone does not lead to better outputs, nor does it offer explainability, as it tends to produce explanations without explainability, in that they do not improve the ability of end users to better understand systems or achieve their goals.

### LLPut: Investigating Large Language Models for Bug Report-Based Input   Generation
**Authors**: Alif Al Hasan, Subarna Saha, Mia Mohammad Imran, Tarannum Shaila Zaman

**Updated**: 2025-05-01T21:31:38Z

**Summary**: Failure-inducing inputs play a crucial role in diagnosing and analyzing software bugs. Bug reports typically contain these inputs, which developers extract to facilitate debugging. Since bug reports are written in natural language, prior research has leveraged various Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for automated input extraction. With the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), an important research question arises: how effectively can generative LLMs extract failure-inducing inputs from bug reports? In this paper, we propose LLPut, a technique to empirically evaluate the performance of three open-source generative LLMs -- LLaMA, Qwen, and Qwen-Coder -- in extracting relevant inputs from bug reports. We conduct an experimental evaluation on a dataset of 206 bug reports to assess the accuracy and effectiveness of these models. Our findings provide insights into the capabilities and limitations of generative LLMs in automated bug diagnosis.

### MELON: Provable Indirect Prompt Injection Defense via Masked   Re-execution and Tool Comparison
**Authors**: Kaijie Zhu, Xianjun Yang, Jindong Wang, Wenbo Guo, William Yang Wang

**Updated**: 2025-05-01T20:51:22Z

**Summary**: Recent research has explored that LLM agents are vulnerable to indirect prompt injection (IPI) attacks, where malicious tasks embedded in tool-retrieved information can redirect the agent to take unauthorized actions. Existing defenses against IPI have significant limitations: either require essential model training resources, lack effectiveness against sophisticated attacks, or harm the normal utilities. We present MELON (Masked re-Execution and TooL comparisON), a novel IPI defense. Our approach builds on the observation that under a successful attack, the agent's next action becomes less dependent on user tasks and more on malicious tasks. Following this, we design MELON to detect attacks by re-executing the agent's trajectory with a masked user prompt modified through a masking function. We identify an attack if the actions generated in the original and masked executions are similar. We also include three key designs to reduce the potential false positives and false negatives. Extensive evaluation on the IPI benchmark AgentDojo demonstrates that MELON outperforms SOTA defenses in both attack prevention and utility preservation. Moreover, we show that combining MELON with a SOTA prompt augmentation defense (denoted as MELON-Aug) further improves its performance. We also conduct a detailed ablation study to validate our key designs.

### Activation Steering in Neural Theorem Provers
**Authors**: Shashank Kirtania

**Updated**: 2025-05-01T20:40:32Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in proving formal theorems using proof assistants like Lean. However, current state of the art language models struggles to predict next step in proofs leading practitioners to use different sampling techniques to improve LLMs capabilities. We observe that the LLM is capable of predicting the correct tactic; however, it faces challenges in ranking it appropriately within the set of candidate tactics, affecting the overall selection process. To overcome this hurdle, we use activation steering to guide LLMs responses to improve the generations at the time of inference. Our results suggest that activation steering offers a promising lightweight alternative to specialized fine-tuning for enhancing theorem proving capabilities in LLMs, particularly valuable in resource-constrained environments.

### LLM Ethics Benchmark: A Three-Dimensional Assessment System for   Evaluating Moral Reasoning in Large Language Models
**Authors**: Junfeng Jiao, Saleh Afroogh, Abhejay Murali, Kevin Chen, David Atkinson, Amit Dhurandhar

**Updated**: 2025-05-01T20:36:19Z

**Summary**: This study establishes a novel framework for systematically evaluating the moral reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) as they increasingly integrate into critical societal domains. Current assessment methodologies lack the precision needed to evaluate nuanced ethical decision-making in AI systems, creating significant accountability gaps. Our framework addresses this challenge by quantifying alignment with human ethical standards through three dimensions: foundational moral principles, reasoning robustness, and value consistency across diverse scenarios. This approach enables precise identification of ethical strengths and weaknesses in LLMs, facilitating targeted improvements and stronger alignment with societal values. To promote transparency and collaborative advancement in ethical AI development, we are publicly releasing both our benchmark datasets and evaluation codebase at https://github.com/ The-Responsible-AI-Initiative/LLM_Ethics_Benchmark.git.

**Updated**: 2025-05-01T20:28:39Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLM) have become a popular approach for implementing Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, and a significant amount of effort has been spent on building good models and metrics. In spite of increased recognition of the need for rigorous evaluation of RAG systems, few tools exist that go beyond the creation of model output and automatic calculation. We present InspectorRAGet, an introspection platform for performing a comprehensive analysis of the quality of RAG system output. InspectorRAGet allows the user to analyze aggregate and instance-level performance of RAG systems, using both human and algorithmic metrics as well as annotator quality. InspectorRAGet is suitable for multiple use cases and is available publicly to the community. A live instance of the platform is available at https://ibm.biz/InspectorRAGet.

### ICQuant: Index Coding enables Low-bit LLM Quantization
**Authors**: Xinlin Li, Osama Hanna, Christina Fragouli, Suhas Diggavi

**Updated**: 2025-05-01T20:23:29Z

**Summary**: The rapid deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) highlights the need for efficient low-bit post-training quantization (PTQ), due to their high memory costs. A key challenge in weight quantization is the presence of outliers, which inflate quantization ranges and lead to large errors. While a number of outlier suppression techniques have been proposed, they either: fail to effectively shrink the quantization range, or incur (relatively) high bit overhead. In this paper, we present ICQuant, a novel framework that leverages outlier statistics to design an efficient index coding scheme for outlier-aware weight-only quantization. Compared to existing outlier suppression techniques requiring $\approx 1$ bit overhead to halve the quantization range, ICQuant requires only $\approx 0.3$ bits; a significant saving in extreme compression regimes (e.g., 2-3 bits per weight). ICQuant can be used on top of any existing quantizers to eliminate outliers, improving the quantization quality. Using just 2.3 bits per weight and simple scalar quantizers, ICQuant improves the zero-shot accuracy of the 2-bit Llama3-70B model by up to 130% and 150% relative to QTIP and QuIP#; and it achieves comparable performance to the best-known fine-tuned quantizer (PV-tuning) without fine-tuning.

### CITER: Collaborative Inference for Efficient Large Language Model   Decoding with Token-Level Routing
**Authors**: Wenhao Zheng, Yixiao Chen, Weitong Zhang, Souvik Kundu, Yun Li, Zhengzhong Liu, Eric P. Xing, Hongyi Wang, Huaxiu Yao

**Updated**: 2025-05-01T20:11:36Z

**Summary**: Large language models have achieved remarkable success in various tasks but suffer from high computational costs during inference, limiting their deployment in resource-constrained applications. To address this issue, we propose a novel Collaborative Inference with Token-lEvel Routing (CITER) framework that enables efficient collaboration between small and large language models (SLMs \& LLMs) through a token-level routing strategy. Specifically, CITER routes non-critical tokens to an SLM for efficiency and routes critical tokens to an LLM for generalization quality. We formulate router training as a policy optimization, where the router receives rewards based on both the quality of predictions and the inference costs of generation. This allows the router to learn to predict token-level routing scores and make routing decisions based on both the current token and the future impact of its decisions. To further accelerate the reward evaluation process, we introduce a shortcut which significantly reduces the costs of the reward estimation and improving the practicality of our approach. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that CITER reduces the inference costs while preserving high-quality generation, offering a promising solution for real-time and resource-constrained applications. Our data and code are available at https://github.com/aiming-lab/CITER.

### OET: Optimization-based prompt injection Evaluation Toolkit
**Authors**: Jinsheng Pan, Xiaogeng Liu, Chaowei Xiao

**Updated**: 2025-05-01T20:09:48Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding and generation, enabling their widespread adoption across various domains. However, their susceptibility to prompt injection attacks poses significant security risks, as adversarial inputs can manipulate model behavior and override intended instructions. Despite numerous defense strategies, a standardized framework to rigorously evaluate their effectiveness, especially under adaptive adversarial scenarios, is lacking. To address this gap, we introduce OET, an optimization-based evaluation toolkit that systematically benchmarks prompt injection attacks and defenses across diverse datasets using an adaptive testing framework. Our toolkit features a modular workflow that facilitates adversarial string generation, dynamic attack execution, and comprehensive result analysis, offering a unified platform for assessing adversarial robustness. Crucially, the adaptive testing framework leverages optimization methods with both white-box and black-box access to generate worst-case adversarial examples, thereby enabling strict red-teaming evaluations. Extensive experiments underscore the limitations of current defense mechanisms, with some models remaining susceptible even after implementing security enhancements.

### SmallPlan: Leverage Small Language Models for Sequential Path Planning   with Simulation-Powered, LLM-Guided Distillation
**Authors**: Quang P. M. Pham, Khoi T. N. Nguyen, Nhi H. Doan, Cuong A. Pham, Kentaro Inui, Dezhen Song

**Updated**: 2025-05-01T19:44:36Z

**Summary**: Efficient path planning in robotics, particularly within large-scale, dynamic environments, remains a significant hurdle. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer strong reasoning capabilities, their high computational cost and limited adaptability in dynamic scenarios hinder real-time deployment on edge devices. We present SmallPlan -- a novel framework leveraging LLMs as teacher models to train lightweight Small Language Models (SLMs) for high-level path planning tasks. In SmallPlan, the SLMs provide optimal action sequences to navigate across scene graphs that compactly represent full-scaled 3D scenes. The SLMs are trained in a simulation-powered, interleaved manner with LLM-guided supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). This strategy not only enables SLMs to successfully complete navigation tasks but also makes them aware of important factors like travel distance and number of trials. Through experiments, we demonstrate that the fine-tuned SLMs perform competitively with larger models like GPT-4o on sequential path planning, without suffering from hallucination and overfitting. SmallPlan is resource-efficient, making it well-suited for edge-device deployment and advancing practical autonomous robotics.

### Near-optimal Sensor Placement for Detecting Stochastic Target   Trajectories in Barrier Coverage Systems
**Authors**: Mingyu Kim, Daniel J. Stilwell, Harun Yetkin, Jorge Jimenez

**Updated**: 2025-05-01T19:31:45Z

**Summary**: This paper addresses the deployment of sensors for a 2-D barrier coverage system. The challenge is to compute near-optimal sensor placements for detecting targets whose trajectories follow a log-Gaussian Cox line process. We explore sensor deployment in a transformed space, where linear target trajectories are represented as points. While this space simplifies handling the line process, the spatial functions representing sensor performance (i.e. probability of detection) become less intuitive. To illustrate our approach, we focus on positioning sensors of the barrier coverage system on the seafloor to detect passing ships. Through numerical experiments using historical ship data, we compute sensor locations that maximize the probability all ship passing over the barrier coverage system are detected.

### HMCF: A Human-in-the-loop Multi-Robot Collaboration Framework Based on   Large Language Models
**Authors**: Zhaoxing Li, Wenbo Wu, Yue Wang, Yanran Xu, William Hunt, Sebastian Stein

**Updated**: 2025-05-01T19:23:50Z

**Summary**: Rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have enabled robots to performcomplex tasks autonomously with increasing precision. However, multi-robot systems (MRSs) face challenges in generalization, heterogeneity, and safety, especially when scaling to large-scale deployments like disaster response. Traditional approaches often lack generalization, requiring extensive engineering for new tasks and scenarios, and struggle with managing diverse robots. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Human-in-the-loop Multi-Robot Collaboration Framework (HMCF) powered by large language models (LLMs). LLMs enhance adaptability by reasoning over diverse tasks and robot capabilities, while human oversight ensures safety and reliability, intervening only when necessary. Our framework seamlessly integrates human oversight, LLM agents, and heterogeneous robots to optimize task allocation and execution. Each robot is equipped with an LLM agent capable of understanding its capabilities, converting tasks into executable instructions, and reducing hallucinations through task verification and human supervision. Simulation results show that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art task planning methods, achieving higher task success rates with an improvement of 4.76%. Real-world tests demonstrate its robust zero-shot generalization feature and ability to handle diverse tasks and environments with minimal human intervention.

### Spill The Beans: Exploiting CPU Cache Side-Channels to Leak Tokens from   Large Language Models
**Authors**: Andrew Adiletta, Berk Sunar

**Updated**: 2025-05-01T19:18:56Z

**Summary**: Side-channel attacks on shared hardware resources increasingly threaten confidentiality, especially with the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs). In this work, we introduce Spill The Beans, a novel application of cache side-channels to leak tokens generated by an LLM. By co-locating an attack process on the same hardware as the victim model, we flush and reload embedding vectors from the embedding layer, where each token corresponds to a unique embedding vector. When accessed during token generation, it results in a cache hit detectable by our attack on shared lower-level caches.   A significant challenge is the massive size of LLMs, which, by nature of their compute intensive operation, quickly evicts embedding vectors from the cache. We address this by balancing the number of tokens monitored against the amount of information leaked. Monitoring more tokens increases potential vocabulary leakage but raises the chance of missing cache hits due to eviction; monitoring fewer tokens improves detection reliability but limits vocabulary coverage.   Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate the feasibility of leaking tokens from LLMs via cache side-channels. Our findings reveal a new vulnerability in LLM deployments, highlighting that even sophisticated models are susceptible to traditional side-channel attacks. We discuss the implications for privacy and security in LLM-serving infrastructures and suggest considerations for mitigating such threats. For proof of concept we consider two concrete attack scenarios: Our experiments show that an attacker can recover as much as 80%-90% of a high entropy API key with single shot monitoring. As for English text we can reach a 40% recovery rate with a single shot. We should note that the rate highly depends on the monitored token set and these rates can be improved by targeting more specialized output domains.

### Aggregating empirical evidence from data strategy studies: a case on   model quantization
**Authors**: Santiago del Rey, Paulo Sérgio Medeiros dos Santos, Guilherme Horta Travassos, Xavier Franch, Silverio Martínez-Fernández

**Updated**: 2025-05-01T19:18:35Z

**Summary**: Background: As empirical software engineering evolves, more studies adopt data strategies$-$approaches that investigate digital artifacts such as models, source code, or system logs rather than relying on human subjects. Synthesizing results from such studies introduces new methodological challenges.   Aims: This study assesses the effects of model quantization on correctness and resource efficiency in deep learning (DL) systems. Additionally, it explores the methodological implications of aggregating evidence from empirical studies that adopt data strategies.   Method: We conducted a research synthesis of six primary studies that empirically evaluate model quantization. We applied the Structured Synthesis Method (SSM) to aggregate the findings, which combines qualitative and quantitative evidence through diagrammatic modeling. A total of 19 evidence models were extracted and aggregated.   Results: The aggregated evidence indicates that model quantization weakly negatively affects correctness metrics while consistently improving resource efficiency metrics, including storage size, inference latency, and GPU energy consumption$-$a manageable trade-off for many DL deployment contexts. Evidence across quantization techniques remains fragmented, underscoring the need for more focused empirical studies per technique.   Conclusions: Model quantization offers substantial efficiency benefits with minor trade-offs in correctness, making it a suitable optimization strategy for resource-constrained environments. This study also demonstrates the feasibility of using SSM to synthesize findings from data strategy-based research.

### Do Vision & Language Decoders use Images and Text equally? How   Self-consistent are their Explanations?
**Authors**: Letitia Parcalabescu, Anette Frank

**Updated**: 2025-05-01T18:40:41Z

**Summary**: Vision and language model (VLM) decoders are currently the best-performing architectures on multimodal tasks. Next to answers, they are able to produce natural language explanations, either in post-hoc or CoT settings. However, it is not clear to what extent they are using the input vision and text modalities when generating answers or explanations. In this work, we investigate if VLMs rely on their input modalities differently when they produce explanations as opposed to answers. We also evaluate the self-consistency of VLM decoders in both post-hoc and CoT explanation settings, by extending existing unimodal tests and measures to VLM decoders. We find that most tested VLMs are less self-consistent than LLMs. Text contributions in all tested VL decoders are more important than image contributions in all examined tasks. However, when comparing explanation generation to answer generation, the contributions of images are significantly stronger for generating explanations compared to answers. This difference is even larger in CoT compared to post-hoc explanations. Lastly, we provide an up-to-date benchmarking of state-of-the-art VL decoders on the VALSE benchmark, which before was restricted to VL encoders. We find that the tested VL decoders still struggle with most phenomena tested by VALSE.

### Reasoning Capabilities and Invariability of Large Language Models
**Authors**: Alessandro Raganato, Rafael Peñaloza, Marco Viviani, Gabriella Pasi

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in manipulating natural language across multiple applications, but their ability to handle simple reasoning tasks is often questioned. In this work, we aim to provide a comprehensive analysis of LLMs' reasoning competence, specifically focusing on their prompt dependency. In particular, we introduce a new benchmark dataset with a series of simple reasoning questions demanding shallow logical reasoning. Aligned with cognitive psychology standards, the questions are confined to a basic domain revolving around geometric figures, ensuring that responses are independent of any pre-existing intuition about the world and rely solely on deduction. An empirical analysis involving zero-shot and few-shot prompting across 24 LLMs of different sizes reveals that, while LLMs with over 70 billion parameters perform better in the zero-shot setting, there is still a large room for improvement. An additional test with chain-of-thought prompting over 22 LLMs shows that this additional prompt can aid or damage the performance of models, depending on whether the rationale is required before or after the answer.

**Summary**: Recently, natural language has been the primary medium for human-robot interaction. However, its inherent lack of spatial precision for robotic control introduces challenges such as ambiguity and verbosity. To address these limitations, we introduce the Robotic Visual Instruction (RoVI), a novel paradigm to guide robotic tasks through an object-centric, hand-drawn symbolic representation. RoVI effectively encodes spatial-temporal information into human-interpretable visual instructions through 2D sketches, utilizing arrows, circles, colors, and numbers to direct 3D robotic manipulation. To enable robots to understand RoVI better and generate precise actions based on RoVI, we present Visual Instruction Embodied Workflow (VIEW), a pipeline formulated for RoVI-conditioned policies. This approach leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to interpret RoVI inputs, decode spatial and temporal constraints from 2D pixel space via keypoint extraction, and then transform them into executable 3D action sequences. We additionally curate a specialized dataset of 15K instances to fine-tune small VLMs for edge deployment, enabling them to effectively learn RoVI capabilities. Our approach is rigorously validated across 11 novel tasks in both real and simulated environments, demonstrating significant generalization capability. Notably, VIEW achieves an 87.5% success rate in real-world scenarios involving unseen tasks that feature multi-step actions, with disturbances, and trajectory-following requirements. Code and Datasets in this paper will be released soon.

**Summary**: Multimodal LLMs are turning their focus to video benchmarks, however most video benchmarks only provide outcome supervision, with no intermediate or interpretable reasoning steps. This makes it challenging to assess if models are truly able to combine perceptual and temporal information to reason about videos, or simply get the correct answer by chance or by exploiting linguistic biases. To remedy this, we provide a new video reasoning dataset called MINERVA for modern multimodal models. Each question in the dataset comes with 5 answer choices, as well as detailed, hand-crafted reasoning traces. Our dataset is multimodal, diverse in terms of video domain and length, and consists of complex multi-step questions. Extensive benchmarking shows that our dataset provides a challenge for frontier open-source and proprietary models. We perform fine-grained error analysis to identify common failure modes across various models, and create a taxonomy of reasoning errors. We use this to explore both human and LLM-as-a-judge methods for scoring video reasoning traces, and find that failure modes are primarily related to temporal localization, followed by visual perception errors, as opposed to logical or completeness errors. The dataset, along with questions, answer candidates and reasoning traces will be publicly available under https://github.com/google-deepmind/neptune?tab=readme-ov-file\#minerva.

### Steering Large Language Models with Register Analysis for Arbitrary   Style Transfer
**Authors**: Xinchen Yang, Marine Carpuat

**Updated**: 2025-05-01T17:39:02Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in rewriting text across various styles. However, effectively leveraging this ability for example-based arbitrary style transfer, where an input text is rewritten to match the style of a given exemplar, remains an open challenge. A key question is how to describe the style of the exemplar to guide LLMs toward high-quality rewrites. In this work, we propose a prompting method based on register analysis to guide LLMs to perform this task. Empirical evaluations across multiple style transfer tasks show that our prompting approach enhances style transfer strength while preserving meaning more effectively than existing prompting strategies.
