**Authors**: Shai Bergman, Anne-Marie Kermarrec, Diana Petrescu, Rafael Pires, Mathis Randl, Martijn de Vos, Ji Zhang

**Summary**: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) improves the reliability of large language model (LLM) answers by integrating external knowledge. However, RAG increases the end-to-end inference time since looking for relevant documents from large vector databases is computationally expensive. To address this, we introduce Proximity, an approximate key-value cache that optimizes the RAG workflow by leveraging similarities in user queries. Instead of treating each query independently, Proximity reuses previously retrieved documents when similar queries appear, substantially reducing the reliance on expensive vector database lookups. To efficiently scale, Proximity employs a locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) scheme that enables fast cache lookups while preserving retrieval accuracy. We evaluate Proximity using the MMLU and MedRAG question-answering benchmarks. Our experiments demonstrate that Proximity with our LSH scheme and a realistically-skewed MedRAG workload reduces database calls by 77.2% while maintaining database recall and test accuracy. We experiment with different similarity tolerances and cache capacities, and show that the time spent within the Proximity cache remains low and constant (4.8 microseconds) even as the cache grows substantially in size. Our results demonstrate that approximate caching is a practical and effective strategy for optimizing RAG-based systems.

### A Data-driven ML Approach for Maximizing Performance in LLM-Adapter   Serving
**Authors**: Ferran Agullo, Joan Oliveras, Chen Wang, Alberto Gutierrez-Torre, Olivier Tardieu, Alaa Youssef, Jordi Torres, Josep Ll. Berral

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T14:59:46Z

**Summary**: With the rapid adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs), LLM-adapters have become increasingly common, providing lightweight specialization of large-scale models. Serving hundreds or thousands of these adapters on a single GPU allows request aggregation, increasing throughput, but may also cause request starvation if GPU memory limits are exceeded. To address this issue, this study focuses on determining the joint configuration of concurrent and parallel adapters that maximizes GPU throughput without inducing starvation, given heterogeneous adapter and traffic properties. We propose a data-driven ML approach leveraging interpretable models to tackle this caching problem and introduce the first Digital Twin capable of reproducing an LLM-adapter serving system, enabling efficient training data generation. Experiments with the vLLM framework and LoRA adapters show that the Digital Twin reproduces throughput within 5.1% of real results, while the ML approach predicts optimal numbers of concurrent and parallel adapters with an error of at most 7.2% under heterogeneous, real-world workloads.

### PESTO: Real-Time Pitch Estimation with Self-supervised   Transposition-equivariant Objective
**Authors**: Alain Riou, Bernardo Torres, Ben Hayes, Stefan Lattner, Gaëtan Hadjeres, Gaël Richard, Geoffroy Peeters

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T11:55:07Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we introduce PESTO, a self-supervised learning approach for single-pitch estimation using a Siamese architecture. Our model processes individual frames of a Variable-$Q$ Transform (VQT) and predicts pitch distributions. The neural network is designed to be equivariant to translations, notably thanks to a Toeplitz fully-connected layer. In addition, we construct pitch-shifted pairs by translating and cropping the VQT frames and train our model with a novel class-based transposition-equivariant objective, eliminating the need for annotated data. Thanks to this architecture and training objective, our model achieves remarkable performances while being very lightweight ($130$k parameters). Evaluations on music and speech datasets (MIR-1K, MDB-stem-synth, and PTDB) demonstrate that PESTO not only outperforms self-supervised baselines but also competes with supervised methods, exhibiting superior cross-dataset generalization. Finally, we enhance PESTO's practical utility by developing a streamable VQT implementation using cached convolutions. Combined with our model's low latency (less than 10 ms) and minimal parameter count, this makes PESTO particularly suitable for real-time applications.

### Batch Speculative Decoding Done Right
**Authors**: Ranran Haoran Zhang, Soumik Dey, Ashirbad Mishra, Hansi Wu, Binbin Li, Rui Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-10-26T23:59:23Z

**Summary**: Speculative decoding speeds up LLM inference by using a small draft model to propose multiple tokens that a target model verifies in parallel. Extending this idea to batches is essential for production serving, but it introduces the ragged tensor problem: sequences in the same batch accept different numbers of draft tokens, breaking right-alignment and corrupting position IDs, attention masks, and KV-cache state. We show that several existing batch implementations violate output equivalence-the fundamental requirement that speculative decoding must produce identical token sequences to standard autoregressive generation. These violations occur precisely due to improper handling of the ragged tensor problem. In response, we (1) characterize the synchronization requirements that guarantee correctness, (2) present a correctness-first batch speculative decoding EQSPEC that exposes realignment as consuming 40% of overhead, and (3) introduce EXSPEC, which maintains a sliding pool of sequences and dynamically forms same-length groups, to reduce the realignment overhead while preserving per-sequence speculative speedups. On the SpecBench dataset, across Vicuna-7B/68M, Qwen3-8B/0.6B, and GLM-4-9B/0.6B target/draft pairs, our approach achieves up to 3$\times$ throughput improvement at batch size 8 compared to batch size 1, with efficient scaling through batch size 8, while maintaining 95% output equivalence. Our method requires no custom kernels and integrates cleanly with existing inference stacks. Our code is available at https://github.com/eBay/spec_dec.

### Jarvis: Towards Personalized AI Assistant via Personal KV-Cache   Retrieval
**Authors**: Binxiao Xu, Junyu Feng, Ruichuan An, Yulin Luo, Shilin Yan, Hao Liang, Ming Lu, Wentao Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-10-26T17:28:05Z

**Summary**: The rapid development of Vision-language models (VLMs) enables open-ended perception and reasoning. Recent works have started to investigate how to adapt general-purpose VLMs into personalized assistants. Even commercial models such as ChatGPT now support model personalization by incorporating user-specific information. However, existing methods either learn a set of concept tokens or train a VLM to utilize user-specific information. However, both pipelines struggle to generate accurate answers as personalized assistants. We introduce Jarvis, an innovative framework for a personalized AI assistant through personal KV-Cache retrieval, which stores user-specific information in the KV-Caches of both textual and visual tokens. The textual tokens are created by summarizing user information into metadata, while the visual tokens are produced by extracting distinct image patches from the user's images. When answering a question, Jarvis first retrieves related KV-Caches from personal storage and uses them to ensure accuracy in responses. We also introduce a fine-grained benchmark built with the same distinct image patch mining pipeline, emphasizing accurate question answering based on fine-grained user-specific information. Jarvis is capable of providing more accurate responses, particularly when they depend on specific local details. Jarvis achieves state-of-the-art results in both visual question answering and text-only tasks across multiple datasets, indicating a practical path toward personalized AI assistants. The code and dataset will be released.

### FalconFS: Distributed File System for Large-Scale Deep Learning Pipeline
**Authors**: Jingwei Xu, Junbin Kang, Mingkai Dong, Mingyu Liu, Lu Zhang, Shaohong Guo, Ziyan Qiu, Mingzhen You, Ziyi Tian, Anqi Yu, Tianhong Ding, Xinwei Hu, Haibo Chen

**Updated**: 2025-10-26T13:31:41Z

**Summary**: Client-side metadata caching has long been considered an effective method for accelerating metadata operations in distributed file systems (DFSs). However, we have found that client-side state (e.g., caching) is not only ineffective but also consumes valuable memory resources in the deep learning pipelines. We thus propose FalconFS, a DFS optimized for deep learning pipelines with the stateless-client architecture. Specifically, instead of performing client-side path resolution and caching, FalconFS efficiently resolves paths on the server side using hybrid metadata indexing and lazy namespace replication. FalconFS also boosts server concurrency with concurrent request merging and provides easy deployment with VFS shortcut. Evaluations against CephFS and Lustre show that FalconFS achieves up to 5.72$\times$ throughput for small file read/write and up to 12.81$\times$ throughput for deep learning model training. FalconFS has been running in Huawei autonomous driving system's production environment with 10,000 NPUs for one year and has been open-sourced.

### FastKV: KV Cache Compression for Fast Long-Context Processing with   Token-Selective Propagation
**Authors**: Dongwon Jo, Jiwon Song, Yulhwa Kim, Jae-Joon Kim

**Updated**: 2025-10-28T04:00:18Z

**Summary**: While large language models (LLMs) excel at handling long-context sequences, they require substantial prefill computation and key-value (KV) cache, which can heavily burden computational efficiency and memory usage in both prefill and decoding stages. Recent works that compress KV caches with prefill acceleration reduce this cost but inadvertently tie the prefill compute reduction to the decoding KV budget. This coupling arises from overlooking the layer-dependent variation of critical context, often leading to accuracy degradation. To address this issue, we introduce FastKV, a KV cache compression framework designed to reduce latency in both prefill and decoding by leveraging the stabilization of token importance in later layers. FastKV performs full-context computation until a Token-Selective Propagation (TSP) layer, which forwards only the most informative tokens to subsequent layers. From these propagated tokens, FastKV independently selects salient KV entries for caching, thereby decoupling KV budget from the prefill compute reduction based on the TSP decision. This independent control of the TSP rate and KV retention rate enables flexible optimization of efficiency and accuracy. Experimental results show that FastKV achieves speedups of up to 1.82$\times$ in prefill and 2.87$\times$ in decoding compared to the full-context baseline, while matching the accuracy of the baselines that only accelerate the decoding stage. Our code is available at https://github.com/dongwonjo/FastKV.

### SABlock: Semantic-Aware KV Cache Eviction with Adaptive Compression   Block Size
**Authors**: Jinhan Chen, Jianchun Liu, Hongli Xu, Xianjun Gao, Shilong Wang

**Updated**: 2025-10-26T07:17:10Z

**Summary**: The growing memory footprint of the Key-Value (KV) cache poses a severe scalability bottleneck for long-context Large Language Model (LLM) inference. While KV cache eviction has emerged as an effective solution by discarding less critical tokens, existing token-, block-, and sentence-level compression methods struggle to balance semantic coherence and memory efficiency. To this end, we introduce SABlock, a \underline{s}emantic-aware KV cache eviction framework with \underline{a}daptive \underline{block} sizes. Specifically, SABlock first performs semantic segmentation to align compression boundaries with linguistic structures, then applies segment-guided token scoring to refine token importance estimation. Finally, for each segment, a budget-driven search strategy adaptively determines the optimal block size that preserves semantic integrity while improving compression efficiency under a given cache budget. Extensive experiments on long-context benchmarks demonstrate that SABlock consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines under the same memory budgets. For instance, on Needle-in-a-Haystack (NIAH), SABlock achieves 99.9% retrieval accuracy with only 96 KV entries, nearly matching the performance of the full-cache baseline that retains up to 8K entries. Under a fixed cache budget of 1,024, SABlock further reduces peak memory usage by 46.28% and achieves up to 9.5x faster decoding on a 128K context length.

### AttentionPredictor: Temporal Patterns Matter for KV Cache Compression
**Authors**: Qingyue Yang, Jie Wang, Xing Li, Zhihai Wang, Chen Chen, Lei Chen, Xianzhi Yu, Wulong Liu, Jianye Hao, Mingxuan Yuan, Bin Li

**Updated**: 2025-10-26T04:25:10Z

**Summary**: With the development of large language models (LLMs), efficient inference through Key-Value (KV) cache compression has attracted considerable attention, especially for long-context generation. To compress the KV cache, recent methods identify critical KV tokens through static modeling of attention scores. However, these methods often struggle to accurately determine critical tokens as they neglect the temporal patterns in attention scores, resulting in a noticeable degradation in LLM performance. To address this challenge, we propose AttentionPredictor, which is the first learning-based method to directly predict attention patterns for KV cache compression and critical token identification. Specifically, AttentionPredictor learns a lightweight, unified convolution model to dynamically capture spatiotemporal patterns and predict the next-token attention scores. An appealing feature of AttentionPredictor is that it accurately predicts the attention score and shares the unified prediction model, which consumes negligible memory, among all transformer layers. Moreover, we propose a cross-token critical cache prefetching framework that hides the token estimation time overhead to accelerate the decoding stage. By retaining most of the attention information, AttentionPredictor achieves 13$\times$ KV cache compression and 5.6$\times$ speedup in a cache offloading scenario with comparable LLM performance, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-arts. The code is available at https://github.com/MIRALab-USTC/LLM-AttentionPredictor.

### Backward-Friendly Optimization: Training Large Language Models with   Approximate Gradients under Memory Constraints
**Authors**: Jing Yang, Kaitong Cai, Yijia Fan, Yufeng Yang, Keze Wang

**Updated**: 2025-10-26T00:50:12Z

**Summary**: Full fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs) is notoriously memory-intensive, primarily because conventional optimizers such as SGD or Adam assume access to exact gradients derived from cached activations. Existing solutions either alter the model architecture (e.g., reversible networks) or trade memory for computation (e.g., activation checkpointing), but the optimizer itself remains untouched. In this work, we introduce GradLite, a backward-friendly optimizer that relaxes the requirement of exact gradients, enabling efficient training even when intermediate activations are aggressively discarded or approximated. GradLite leverages two key techniques: (i) low-rank Jacobian approximation, which reduces the dimensionality of backpropagated error signals, and (ii) error-feedback correction, which accumulates and compensates approximation errors across iterations to preserve convergence guarantees. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that GradLite maintains unbiased gradient estimates with bounded variance, ensuring convergence rates comparable to Adam. Empirically, GradLite reduces optimizer-state and activation memory consumption by up to 50\% without architectural changes, and achieves on-par or superior downstream performance on reasoning (MMLU, GSM8K), multilingual, and dialogue benchmarks compared to checkpointing and optimizer-centric baselines (LoMo, GaLore).

### Mixture-of-Recursions: Learning Dynamic Recursive Depths for Adaptive   Token-Level Computation
**Authors**: Sangmin Bae, Yujin Kim, Reza Bayat, Sungnyun Kim, Jiyoun Ha, Tal Schuster, Adam Fisch, Hrayr Harutyunyan, Ziwei Ji, Aaron Courville, Se-Young Yun

**Updated**: 2025-10-25T14:12:56Z

**Summary**: Scaling language models unlocks impressive capabilities, but the accompanying computational and memory demands make both training and deployment expensive. Existing efficiency efforts typically target either parameter sharing or adaptive computation, leaving open the question of how to attain both simultaneously. We introduce Mixture-of-Recursions (MoR), a unified framework that combines the two axes of efficiency inside a single Recursive Transformer. MoR reuses a shared stack of layers across recursion steps to achieve parameter efficiency, while lightweight routers enable adaptive token-level thinking by dynamically assigning different recursion depths to individual tokens. This allows MoR to focus quadratic attention computation only among tokens still active at a given recursion depth, further improving memory access efficiency by selectively caching only their key-value pairs. Beyond these core mechanisms, we also propose a KV sharing variant that reuses KV pairs from the first recursion, specifically designed to further decrease memory footprint. Across model scales ranging from 135M to 1.7B parameters, MoR forms a new Pareto frontier: at equal training FLOPs and smaller model sizes, it significantly lowers validation perplexity and improves few-shot accuracy, while delivering higher throughput compared with vanilla and existing recursive baselines. These gains demonstrate that MoR is an effective path towards large-model quality without incurring large-model cost.

### Fundamental Limits of Coded Caching with Fixed Subpacketization
**Authors**: Minquan Cheng, Yifei Huang, Youlong Wu, Jinyan Wang

**Updated**: 2025-10-25T03:34:34Z

**Summary**: Coded caching is a promising technique to create coded multicast opportunities for cache-aided networks. By splitting each file into $F$ equal packets (i.e., the subpacketization level $F$) and letting each user cache a set of packets, the transmission load can be significantly reduced via coded multicasting. It has been shown that a higher subpacketization level could potentially lead to a lower transmission load, as more packets can be combined for efficient transmission. On the other hand, a larger $F$ indicates a higher coding complexity and is problematic from a practical perspective when $F$ is extremely large. Despite many works attempting to design coded caching schemes with low subpacketization levels, a fundamental problem remains open: What is the minimum transmission load given any fixed subpacketization level? In this paper, we consider the classical cache-aided networks with identically uncoded placement and one-shot delivery strategy, and investigate the fundamental trade-off between the transmission load and the subpacketization level. We propose a \emph{general} lower bound on the transmission load for any fixed subpacketization by reformulating the centralized coded caching schemes via the combinatorial structure of the corresponding placement delivery array. The lower bound also recovers existing optimality results for the bipartite graph scheme (including the well-known Maddah-Ali and Niesen (MN) scheme and the conjugate MN scheme) as well as the grouping bipartite graph scheme. Furthermore, by carefully exploiting the combinatorial structure and computing the union size of sorted sets, we establish a new optimality result, i.e., the partition scheme can achieve the optimal rate-subpacketization trade-off.

### EEdit: Rethinking the Spatial and Temporal Redundancy for Efficient   Image Editing
**Authors**: Zexuan Yan, Yue Ma, Chang Zou, Wenteng Chen, Qifeng Chen, Linfeng Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-10-25T02:29:47Z

**Summary**: Inversion-based image editing is rapidly gaining momentum while suffering from significant computation overhead, hindering its application in real-time interactive scenarios. In this paper, we rethink that the redundancy in inversion-based image editing exists in both the spatial and temporal dimensions, such as the unnecessary computation in unedited regions and the redundancy in the inversion progress. To tackle these challenges, we propose a practical framework, named EEdit, to achieve efficient image editing. Specifically, we introduce three techniques to solve them one by one. For spatial redundancy, spatial locality caching is introduced to compute the edited region and its neighboring regions while skipping the unedited regions, and token indexing preprocessing is designed to further accelerate the caching. For temporal redundancy, inversion step skipping is proposed to reuse the latent for efficient editing. Our experiments demonstrate an average of 2.46 $\times$ acceleration without performance drop in a wide range of editing tasks including prompt-guided image editing, dragging and image composition.

### Twilight: Adaptive Attention Sparsity with Hierarchical Top-$p$ Pruning
**Authors**: Chaofan Lin, Jiaming Tang, Shuo Yang, Hanshuo Wang, Tian Tang, Boyu Tian, Ion Stoica, Mingyu Gao

**Updated**: 2025-10-25T00:33:14Z

**Summary**: Leveraging attention sparsity to accelerate long-context large language models (LLMs) has been a hot research topic. However, current algorithms such as sparse attention or key-value (KV) cache compression tend to use a fixed budget, which presents a significant challenge during deployment because it fails to account for the dynamic nature of real-world scenarios, where the optimal balance between accuracy and efficiency can vary greatly. In this paper, we find that borrowing top-$p$ sampling (nucleus sampling) to sparse attention can surprisingly achieve adaptive budgeting. Based on this, we propose Twilight, a framework to bring adaptive sparsity to any existing sparse attention algorithm without sacrificing their accuracy. Empirical results show that Twilight can adaptively prune at most 98% of redundant tokens, leading to $15.4\times$ acceleration in self-attention operations and $3.9\times$ acceleration in end-to-end per token latency in long context LLM decoding.

### Massive Memorization with Hundreds of Trillions of Parameters for   Sequential Transducer Generative Recommenders
**Authors**: Zhimin Chen, Chenyu Zhao, Ka Chun Mo, Yunjiang Jiang, Jane H. Lee, Shouwei Chen, Khushhall Chandra Mahajan, Ning Jiang, Kai Ren, Jinhui Li, Wen-Yun Yang

**Updated**: 2025-10-24T22:17:49Z

**Summary**: Modern large-scale recommendation systems rely heavily on user interaction history sequences to enhance the model performance. The advent of large language models and sequential modeling techniques, particularly transformer-like architectures, has led to significant advancements recently (e.g., HSTU, SIM, and TWIN models). While scaling to ultra-long user histories (10k to 100k items) generally improves model performance, it also creates significant challenges on latency, queries per second (QPS) and GPU cost in industry-scale recommendation systems. Existing models do not adequately address these industrial scalability issues. In this paper, we propose a novel two-stage modeling framework, namely VIrtual Sequential Target Attention (VISTA), which decomposes traditional target attention from a candidate item to user history items into two distinct stages: (1) user history summarization into a few hundred tokens; followed by (2) candidate item attention to those tokens. These summarization token embeddings are then cached in storage system and then utilized as sequence features for downstream model training and inference. This novel design for scalability enables VISTA to scale to lifelong user histories (up to one million items) while keeping downstream training and inference costs fixed, which is essential in industry. Our approach achieves significant improvements in offline and online metrics and has been successfully deployed on an industry leading recommendation platform serving billions of users.

### BachVid: Training-Free Video Generation with Consistent Background and   Character
**Authors**: Han Yan, Xibin Song, Yifu Wang, Hongdong Li, Pan Ji, Chao Ma

**Updated**: 2025-10-24T17:56:37Z

**Summary**: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have recently driven significant progress in text-to-video (T2V) generation. However, generating multiple videos with consistent characters and backgrounds remains a significant challenge. Existing methods typically rely on reference images or extensive training, and often only address character consistency, leaving background consistency to image-to-video models. We introduce BachVid, the first training-free method that achieves consistent video generation without needing any reference images. Our approach is based on a systematic analysis of DiT's attention mechanism and intermediate features, revealing its ability to extract foreground masks and identify matching points during the denoising process. Our method leverages this finding by first generating an identity video and caching the intermediate variables, and then inject these cached variables into corresponding positions in newly generated videos, ensuring both foreground and background consistency across multiple videos. Experimental results demonstrate that BachVid achieves robust consistency in generated videos without requiring additional training, offering a novel and efficient solution for consistent video generation without relying on reference images or additional training.

### Alleviating Forgetfulness of Linear Attention by Hybrid Sparse Attention   and Contextualized Learnable Token Eviction
**Authors**: Mutian He, Philip N. Garner

**Updated**: 2025-10-24T16:56:22Z

**Summary**: Linear-attention models that compress the entire input sequence into a fixed-size recurrent state offer an efficient alternative to Transformers, but their finite memory induces forgetfulness that harms retrieval-intensive tasks. To mitigate the issue, we explore a series of hybrid models that restore direct access to past tokens. We interleave token mixers with intermediate time and space complexity between linear and full attention, including sparse attention with token eviction, and the query-aware native sparse attention. Particularly, we propose a novel learnable token eviction approach. Combined with sliding-window attention, an end-to-end trainable lightweight CNN aggregates information from both past and future adjacent tokens to adaptively retain a limited set of critical KV-pairs per head, maintaining linear attention's constant time and space complexity. Efficient Triton kernels for the sparse attention mechanisms are provided. Empirical evaluations on retrieval-intensive benchmarks support the effectiveness of our approaches.

### Prefetching in Deep Memory Hierarchies with NVRAM as Main Memory
**Authors**: Manel Lurbe, Miguel Avargues, Salvador Petit, Maria E. Gomez, Rui Yang, Guanhao Wang, Julio Sahuquillo

**Updated**: 2025-10-24T14:55:42Z

**Summary**: Emerging applications, such as big data analytics and machine learning, require increasingly large amounts of main memory, often exceeding the capacity of current commodity processors built on DRAM technology. To address this, recent research has focused on off-chip memory controllers that facilitate access to diverse memory media, each with unique density and latency characteristics. While these solutions improve memory system performance, they also exacerbate the already significant memory latency. As a result, multi-level prefetching techniques are essential to mitigate these extended latencies.   This paper investigates the advantages of prefetching across both sides of the memory system: the off-chip memory and the on-chip cache hierarchy. Our primary objective is to assess the impact of a multi-level prefetching engine on overall system performance. Additionally, we analyze the individual contribution of each prefetching level to system efficiency. To achieve this, the study evaluates two key prefetching approaches: HMC (Hybrid Memory Controller) and HMC+L1, both of which employ prefetching mechanisms commonly used by processor vendors. The HMC approach integrates a prefetcher within the off-chip hybrid memory controller, while the HMC+L1 approach combines this with additional L1 on-chip prefetchers.   Experimental results on an out-of-order execution processor show that on-chip cache prefetchers are crucial for maximizing the benefits of off-chip prefetching, which in turn further enhances performance. Specifically, the off-chip HMC prefetcher achieves coverage and accuracy rates exceeding 60% and up to 80%, while the combined HMC+L1 approach boosts off-chip prefetcher coverage to as much as 92%. Consequently, overall performance increases from 9% with the HMC approach to 12% when L1 prefetching is also employed.

### Global Predecessor Indexing: Avoiding Binary Search in Weighted Job   Scheduling
**Authors**: Amit Joshi

**Updated**: 2025-10-24T11:53:34Z

**Summary**: We present an improved solution to the Weighted Job Scheduling (WJS) problem. While the classical dynamic programming (DP) solution for $n$ jobs runs in $O(n \log(n))$ time due to comparison-based sorting and per-job binary search, we eliminate the binary search bottleneck. In its place, we introduce a novel multi-phase preprocessing technique called \emph{Global Predecessor Indexing (GPI)}, which computes the latest non-overlapping job (i.e., the predecessor) for all jobs via a two-pointer linear-time pass after sorting. This yields a time complexity of $O(S(n) + n)$ where $S(n)$ is the time to sort all jobs. GPI enables direct use in the classical DP recurrence. When combined with linear-time sorting, GPI yields a complete $O(n)$ solution. Even with comparison-based sorting, GPI significantly outperforms the classical solution in practice by avoiding repeated binary searches in favor of the more cache-efficient extra sort and two-pointer pass.

### Compositional Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion for Extendable Planning
**Authors**: Jaesik Yoon, Hyeonseo Cho, Sungjin Ahn

**Updated**: 2025-10-24T11:42:38Z

**Summary**: Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion (MCTD) integrates diffusion models with structured tree search to enable effective trajectory exploration through stepwise reasoning. However, MCTD remains fundamentally limited by training trajectory lengths. While periodic replanning allows plan concatenation for longer plan generation, the planning process remains locally confined, as MCTD searches within individual trajectories without access to global context. We propose Compositional Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion (C-MCTD), a framework that elevates planning from individual trajectory optimization to reasoning over complete plan compositions. C-MCTD introduces three complementary components: (1) Online Composer, which performs globally-aware planning by searching across entire plan compositions; (2) Distributed Composer, which reduces search complexity through parallel exploration from multiple starting points; and (3) Preplan Composer, which accelerates inference by leveraging cached plan graphs.

### Robustifying Learning-Augmented Caching Efficiently without Compromising   1-Consistency
**Authors**: Peng Chen, Hailiang Zhao, Jiaji Zhang, Xueyan Tang, Yixuan Wang, Shuiguang Deng

**Updated**: 2025-10-24T08:41:38Z

**Summary**: The online caching problem aims to minimize cache misses when serving a sequence of requests under a limited cache size. While naive learning-augmented caching algorithms achieve ideal $1$-consistency, they lack robustness guarantees. Existing robustification methods either sacrifice $1$-consistency or introduce excessive computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce Guard, a lightweight robustification framework that enhances the robustness of a broad class of learning-augmented caching algorithms to $2H_k + 2$, while preserving their $1$-consistency. Guard achieves the current best-known trade-off between consistency and robustness, with only $O(1)$ additional per-request overhead, thereby maintaining the original time complexity of the base algorithm. Extensive experiments across multiple real-world datasets and prediction models validate the effectiveness of Guard in practice.

**Authors**: Behnam Agahi, Hamed Farbeh

**Updated**: 2025-10-24T08:35:21Z

**Summary**: With the growing use of embedded systems in various industries, the need for automated platforms for the development and deployment of customized Linux-based operating systems has become more important. This research was conducted with the aim of designing and implementing an integrated and reproducible infrastructure for the development, building, and testing of a Linux-based operating system using the Yocto Project. The proposed structure was implemented based on a three-layer architecture consisting of the main Yocto repositories, a custom layer (meta-custom), and a coordinating manifest layer to ensure version synchronization, scalability, and reproducibility. Three sample projects, including libhelloworld, helloworld, and the kernel module hello mod, were developed and integrated into the build process. Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment pipelines were implemented with GitLab CI and combined with an isolated Docker environment to automate and streamline the build and testing workflows. Using a local cache server containing hashserv, downloads and sstate cache significantly reduced the build time. The functionality and stability of the system were verified through six boot test scenarios in the QEMU simulator. The results show that the proposed design not only ensures reproducibility but also can be extended to advanced applications such as continuous deployment of real-time Linux versions. Future recommendations include expanding automated tests, implementing system monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana, using distributed builds, optimizing with Docker multi-stage builds, and enabling continuous deployment of real-time Linux changes to provide a stable and scalable model for industrial and research projects in embedded systems with a rapid and reliable development cycle.

### InfiniPot-V: Memory-Constrained KV Cache Compression for Streaming Video   Understanding
**Authors**: Minsoo Kim, Kyuhong Shim, Jungwook Choi, Simyung Chang

**Updated**: 2025-10-24T05:39:03Z

**Summary**: Modern multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can reason over hour-long video, yet their key-value (KV) cache grows linearly with time-quickly exceeding the fixed memory of phones, AR glasses, and edge robots. Prior compression schemes either assume the whole video and user query are available offline or must first build the full cache, so memory still scales with stream length. InfiniPot-V is the first training-free, query-agnostic framework that enforces a hard, length-independent memory cap for streaming video understanding. During video encoding it monitors the cache and, once a user-set threshold is reached, runs a lightweight compression pass that (i) removes temporally redundant tokens via Temporal-axis Redundancy (TaR) metric and (ii) keeps semantically significant tokens via Value-Norm (VaN) ranking. Across four open-source MLLMs and four long-video and streaming-video benchmarks, InfiniPot-V cuts peak GPU memory by up to 94%, sustains real-time generation, and matches or surpasses full-cache accuracy-even in multi-turn dialogues. By dissolving the KV cache bottleneck without retraining or query knowledge, InfiniPot-V closes the gap for on-device streaming video assistants.

### Reasoning Path Compression: Compressing Generation Trajectories for   Efficient LLM Reasoning
**Authors**: Jiwon Song, Dongwon Jo, Yulhwa Kim, Jae-Joon Kim

**Updated**: 2025-10-24T04:48:06Z

**Summary**: Recent reasoning-focused language models achieve high accuracy by generating lengthy intermediate reasoning paths before producing final answers. While this approach is effective in solving problems that require logical thinking, long reasoning paths significantly increase memory usage and reduce throughput of token generation, limiting the practical deployment of such models. We propose Reasoning Path Compression (RPC), a training-free method that accelerates inference by leveraging the semantic sparsity of reasoning paths. RPC periodically compresses the KV cache by retaining cache entries that receive high importance score, which are computed using a selector window composed of recently generated queries. Experiments show that RPC improves generation throughput of QwQ-32B by up to 1.60$\times$ compared to the inference with full KV cache, with an accuracy drop of 1.2\% on the AIME 2024 benchmark. Our findings demonstrate that semantic sparsity in reasoning traces can be effectively exploited for compression, offering a practical path toward efficient deployment of reasoning LLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/jiwonsong-dev/ReasoningPathCompression.

### Tensor Product Attention Is All You Need
**Authors**: Yifan Zhang, Yifeng Liu, Huizhuo Yuan, Zhen Qin, Yang Yuan, Quanquan Gu, Andrew Chi-Chih Yao

**Updated**: 2025-10-23T23:35:32Z

**Summary**: Scaling language models to handle longer input sequences typically necessitates large key-value (KV) caches, resulting in substantial memory overhead during inference. In this paper, we propose Tensor Product Attention (TPA), a novel attention mechanism that uses tensor decompositions to represent queries, keys, and values compactly, substantially shrinking the KV cache size at inference time. By factorizing these representations into contextual low-rank components and seamlessly integrating with Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE), TPA achieves improved model quality alongside memory efficiency. Based on TPA, we introduce the Tensor ProducT ATTenTion Transformer (T6), a new model architecture for sequence modeling. Through extensive empirical evaluation on language modeling tasks, we demonstrate that T6 surpasses or matches the performance of standard Transformer baselines including Multi-Head Attention (MHA), Multi-Query Attention (MQA), Grouped-Query Attention (GQA), and Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA) across various metrics, including perplexity and a range of established evaluation benchmarks. Notably, TPA's memory efficiency and computational efficiency at decoding stage enables processing longer sequences under fixed resource constraints, addressing a critical scalability challenge in modern language models.

**Authors**: Amartya Chakraborty, Paresh Dashore, Nadia Bathaee, Anmol Jain, Anirban Das, Shi-Xiong Zhang, Sambit Sahu, Milind Naphade, Genta Indra Winata

**Updated**: 2025-10-23T21:31:35Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities as intelligent agents capable of solving complex problems. However, effective planning in scenarios involving dependencies between API or tool calls-particularly in multi-turn conversations-remains a significant challenge. To address this, we introduce T1, a tool-augmented, multi-domain, multi-turn conversational dataset specifically designed to capture and manage inter-tool dependencies across diverse domains. T1 enables rigorous evaluation of agents' ability to coordinate tool use across nine distinct domains (4 single domain and 5 multi-domain) with the help of an integrated caching mechanism for both short- and long-term memory, while supporting dynamic replanning-such as deciding whether to recompute or reuse cached results. Beyond facilitating research on tool use and planning, T1 also serves as a benchmark for evaluating the performance of open-weight and proprietary large language models. We present results powered by T1-Agent, highlighting their ability to plan and reason in complex, tool-dependent scenarios.

### Panorama: Fast-Track Nearest Neighbors
**Authors**: Vansh Ramani, Alexis Schlomer, Akash Nayar, Sayan Ranu, Jignesh M. Patel, Panagiotis Karras

**Updated**: 2025-10-23T19:45:39Z

**Summary**: Approximate Nearest-Neighbor Search (ANNS) efficiently finds data items whose embeddings are close to that of a given query in a high-dimensional space, aiming to balance accuracy with speed. Used in recommendation systems, image and video retrieval, natural language processing, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), ANNS algorithms such as IVFPQ, HNSW graphs, Annoy, and MRPT utilize graph, tree, clustering, and quantization techniques to navigate large vector spaces. Despite this progress, ANNS systems spend up to 99% of query time to compute distances in their final refinement phase. In this paper, we present PANORAMA, a machine learning-driven approach that tackles the ANNS verification bottleneck through data-adaptive learned orthogonal transforms that facilitate the accretive refinement of distance bounds. Such transforms compact over 90% of signal energy into the first half of dimensions, enabling early candidate pruning with partial distance computations. We integrate PANORAMA into state-of-the-art ANNS methods, namely IVFPQ/Flat, HNSW, MRPT, and Annoy, without index modification, using level-major memory layouts, SIMD-vectorized partial distance computations, and cache-aware access patterns. Experiments across diverse datasets -- from image-based CIFAR-10 and GIST to modern embedding spaces including OpenAI's Ada 2 and Large 3 -- demonstrate that PANORAMA affords a 2--30$\times$ end-to-end speedup with no recall loss.

### A Stable Whitening Optimizer for Efficient Neural Network Training
**Authors**: Kevin Frans, Sergey Levine, Pieter Abbeel

**Updated**: 2025-10-23T18:52:25Z

**Summary**: In this work, we take an experimentally grounded look at neural network optimization. Building on the Shampoo family of algorithms, we identify and alleviate three key issues, resulting in the proposed SPlus method. First, we find that naive Shampoo is prone to divergence when matrix-inverses are cached for long periods. We introduce an alternate bounded update combining a historical eigenbasis with instantaneous normalization, resulting in across-the-board stability and significantly lower computational requirements. Second, we adapt a shape-aware scaling to enable learning rate transfer across network width. Third, we find that high learning rates result in large parameter noise, and propose a simple iterate-averaging scheme which unblocks faster learning. To properly confirm these findings, we introduce a pointed Transformer training benchmark, considering three objectives (language modelling, image classification, and diffusion modelling) across different stages of training. On average, SPlus is able to reach the validation performance of Adam within 44-58% of the gradient steps and 62-83% of the wallclock time.

### Mixing Importance with Diversity: Joint Optimization for KV Cache   Compression in Large Vision-Language Models
**Authors**: Xuyang Liu, Xiyan Gui, Yuchao Zhang, Linfeng Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-10-23T16:17:47Z

**Summary**: Recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in processing extended multi-modal sequences, yet the resulting key-value (KV) cache expansion creates a critical memory bottleneck that fundamentally limits deployment scalability. While existing KV cache compression methods focus on retaining high-importance KV pairs to minimize storage, they often overlook the modality-specific semantic redundancy patterns that emerge distinctively in multi-modal KV caches. In this work, we first analyze how, beyond simple importance, the KV cache in LVLMs exhibits varying levels of redundancy across attention heads. We show that relying solely on importance can only cover a subset of the full KV cache information distribution, leading to potential loss of semantic coverage. To address this, we propose \texttt{MixKV}, a novel method that mixes importance with diversity for optimized KV cache compression in LVLMs. \texttt{MixKV} adapts to head-wise semantic redundancy, selectively balancing diversity and importance when compressing KV pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \texttt{MixKV} consistently enhances existing methods across multiple LVLMs. Under extreme compression (budget=64), \texttt{MixKV} improves baseline methods by an average of \textbf{5.1\%} across five multi-modal understanding benchmarks and achieves remarkable gains of \textbf{8.0\%} and \textbf{9.0\%} for SnapKV and AdaKV on GUI grounding tasks, all while maintaining comparable inference efficiency. Furthermore, \texttt{MixKV} extends seamlessly to LLMs with comparable performance gains. Our code is available at \href{https://github.com/xuyang-liu16/MixKV}{\textcolor{citeblue}{https://github.com/xuyang-liu16/MixKV}}.

### WarpSpeed: A High-Performance Library for Concurrent GPU Hash Tables
**Authors**: Hunter McCoy, Prashant Pandey

**Updated**: 2025-10-23T15:26:38Z

**Summary**: GPU hash tables are increasingly used to accelerate data processing, but their limited functionality restricts adoption in large-scale data processing applications. Current limitations include incomplete concurrency support and missing compound operations such as upserts.   This paper presents WarpSpeed, a library of high-performance concurrent GPU hash tables with a unified benchmarking framework for performance analysis. WarpSpeed implements eight state-of-the-art Nvidia GPU hash table designs and provides a rich API designed for modern GPU applications. Our evaluation uses diverse benchmarks to assess both correctness and scalability, and we demonstrate real-world impact by integrating these hash tables into three downstream applications.   We propose several optimization techniques to reduce concurrency overhead, including fingerprint-based metadata to minimize cache line probes and specialized Nvidia GPU instructions for lock-free queries. Our findings provide new insights into concurrent GPU hash table design and offer practical guidance for developing efficient, scalable data structures on modern GPUs.

### Neural Attention Search
**Authors**: Difan Deng, Marius Lindauer

**Updated**: 2025-10-23T14:23:24Z

**Summary**: We present Neural Attention Search (NAtS), a framework that automatically evaluates the importance of each token within a sequence and determines if the corresponding token can be dropped after several steps. This approach can efficiently reduce the KV cache sizes required by transformer-based models during inference and thus reduce inference costs. In this paper, we design a search space that contains three token types: (i) Global Tokens will be preserved and queried by all the following tokens. (ii) Local Tokens survive until the next global token appears. (iii) Sliding Window Tokens have an impact on the inference of a fixed size of the next following tokens. Similar to the One-Shot Neural Architecture Search approach, this token-type information can be learned jointly with the architecture weights via a learnable attention mask. Experiments on both training a new transformer from scratch and fine-tuning existing large language models show that NAtS can efficiently reduce the KV cache size required for the models while maintaining the models' performance.

**Authors**: Akif Çördük, Piotr Sielski, Alice Boucher, Kumar Aatish

**Updated**: 2025-10-23T12:39:59Z

**Summary**: We introduce a fusion of GPU accelerated primal heuristics for Mixed Integer Programming. Leveraging GPU acceleration enables exploration of larger search regions and faster iterations. A GPU-accelerated PDLP serves as an approximate LP solver, while a new probing cache facilitates rapid roundings and early infeasibility detection. Several state-of-the-art heuristics, including Feasibility Pump, Feasibility Jump, and Fix-and-Propagate, are further accelerated and enhanced. The combined approach of these GPU-driven algorithms yields significant improvements over existing methods, both in the number of feasible solutions and the quality of objectives by achieving 221 feasible solutions and 22% objective gap in the MIPLIB2017 benchmark on a presolved dataset.

### HA-RAG: Hotness-Aware RAG Acceleration via Mixed Precision and Data   Placement
**Authors**: Danying Ge, Jianhua Gao, Yixue Yang, Weixing Ji

**Updated**: 2025-10-23T12:28:58Z

**Summary**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves model output accuracy by leveraging external knowledge bases, serving as an effective solution to address hallucination issues and knowledge-update delays in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the introduction of external knowledge bases presents RAG with challenges in long-context processing, significantly increasing memory consumption and inference latency. Existing research accelerates inference by precomputing Key and Value (KV) of the knowledge base and loading them on-demand during inference. Based on the access frequency of different KV chunks within the external knowledge base, this paper proposes a hotness-aware RAG (HA-RAG) inference optimization system. First, leveraging the numerical distribution of KV chunks, we introduce a hotness-aware mixed-precision compressing and loading method to reduce disk I/O and memory access overhead. Second, we design a hotness-aware data placement strategy that prioritizes storing frequently accessed KV chunks in high-speed memory to improve data access efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with TurboRAG, the proposed HA-RAG achieves an average speedup of 2.10x and maximum speedup of 10.49x in Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) with negligible accuracy loss.

### Prefetching Cache Optimization Using Graph Neural Networks: A Modular   Framework and Conceptual Analysis
**Authors**: F. I. Qowy

**Updated**: 2025-10-23T10:35:35Z

**Summary**: Caching and prefetching techniques are fundamental to modern computing, serving to bridge the growing performance gap between processors and memory. Traditional prefetching strategies are often limited by their reliance on predefined heuristics or simplified statistical models, which fail to capture the complex, non-linear dependencies in modern data access patterns. This paper introduces a modular framework leveraging Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to model and predict access patterns within graph-structured data, focusing on web navigation and hierarchical file systems. The toolchain consists of: a route mapper for extracting structural information, a graph constructor for creating graph representations, a walk session generator for simulating user behaviors, and a gnn prefetch module for training and inference. We provide a detailed conceptual analysis showing how GNN-based approaches can outperform conventional methods by learning intricate dependencies. This work offers both theoretical foundations and a practical, replicable pipeline for future research in graph-driven systems optimization.

### Squire: A General-Purpose Accelerator to Exploit Fine-Grain Parallelism   on Dependency-Bound Kernels
**Authors**: Rubén Langarita, Jesús Alastruey-Benedé, Pablo Ibáñez-Marín, Santiago Marco-Sola, Miquel Moretó, Adrià Armejach

**Updated**: 2025-10-23T10:06:48Z

**Summary**: Multiple HPC applications are often bottlenecked by compute-intensive kernels implementing complex dependency patterns (data-dependency bound). Traditional general-purpose accelerators struggle to effectively exploit fine-grain parallelism due to limitations in implementing convoluted data-dependency patterns (like SIMD) and overheads due to synchronization and data transfers (like GPGPUs). In contrast, custom FPGA and ASIC designs offer improved performance and energy efficiency at a high cost in hardware design and programming complexity and often lack the flexibility to process different workloads. We propose Squire, a general-purpose accelerator designed to exploit fine-grain parallelism effectively on dependency-bound kernels. Each Squire accelerator has a set of general-purpose low-power in-order cores that can rapidly communicate among themselves and directly access data from the L2 cache. Our proposal integrates one Squire accelerator per core in a typical multicore system, allowing the acceleration of dependency-bound kernels within parallel tasks with minimal software changes. As a case study, we evaluate Squire's effectiveness by accelerating five kernels that implement complex dependency patterns. We use three of these kernels to build an end-to-end read-mapping tool that will be used to evaluate Squire. Squire obtains speedups up to 7.64$\times$ in dynamic programming kernels. Overall, Squire provides an acceleration for an end-to-end application of 3.66$\times$. In addition, Squire reduces energy consumption by up to 56% with a minimal area overhead of 10.5% compared to a Neoverse-N1 baseline.

### Bi-Mamba: Towards Accurate 1-Bit State Space Models
**Authors**: Shengkun Tang, Liqun Ma, Haonan Li, Mingjie Sun, Zhiqiang Shen

**Updated**: 2025-10-23T09:55:50Z

**Summary**: The typical Selective State-Space Model (SSM) used in Mamba addresses several limitations of Transformers, such as the quadratic computational complexity with respect to sequence length and the significant memory requirements during inference due to the key-value (KV) cache. However, the increasing size of Mamba models continues to pose challenges for training and deployment, particularly due to their substantial computational demands during both training and inference. In this work, we introduce $\texttt{Bi-Mamba}$, a scalable and powerful 1-bit Mamba architecture designed to enable more efficient large language models (LLMs), with model sizes of 780M, 1.3B, and 2.7B parameters. $\texttt{Bi-Mamba}$ models are trained from scratch on a standard LLM-scale dataset using an autoregressive distillation loss. Extensive experiments on language modeling benchmarks demonstrate that $\texttt{Bi-Mamba}$ achieves performance comparable to its full-precision (FP16 or BF16) counterparts, while outperforming post-training binarization (PTB) Mamba and binarization-aware training (BAT) Transformer baselines. Moreover, $\texttt{Bi-Mamba}$ drastically reduces memory usage and computational cost compared to the original Mamba. Our work pioneers a new line of linear-complexity LLMs under low-bit representation and provides the way for the design of specialized hardware optimized for efficient 1-bit Mamba-based models. Code and the pre-trained weights are available at https://github.com/Tangshengku/Bi-Mamba.

### A Survey on Cache Methods in Diffusion Models: Toward Efficient   Multi-Modal Generation
**Authors**: Jiacheng Liu, Xinyu Wang, Yuqi Lin, Zhikai Wang, Peiru Wang, Peiliang Cai, Qinming Zhou, Zhengan Yan, Zexuan Yan, Zhengyi Shi, Chang Zou, Yue Ma, Linfeng Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-10-23T09:09:15Z

**Summary**: Diffusion Models have become a cornerstone of modern generative AI for their exceptional generation quality and controllability. However, their inherent \textit{multi-step iterations} and \textit{complex backbone networks} lead to prohibitive computational overhead and generation latency, forming a major bottleneck for real-time applications. Although existing acceleration techniques have made progress, they still face challenges such as limited applicability, high training costs, or quality degradation.   Against this backdrop, \textbf{Diffusion Caching} offers a promising training-free, architecture-agnostic, and efficient inference paradigm. Its core mechanism identifies and reuses intrinsic computational redundancies in the diffusion process. By enabling feature-level cross-step reuse and inter-layer scheduling, it reduces computation without modifying model parameters. This paper systematically reviews the theoretical foundations and evolution of Diffusion Caching and proposes a unified framework for its classification and analysis.   Through comparative analysis of representative methods, we show that Diffusion Caching evolves from \textit{static reuse} to \textit{dynamic prediction}. This trend enhances caching flexibility across diverse tasks and enables integration with other acceleration techniques such as sampling optimization and model distillation, paving the way for a unified, efficient inference framework for future multimodal and interactive applications. We argue that this paradigm will become a key enabler of real-time and efficient generative AI, injecting new vitality into both theory and practice of \textit{Efficient Generative Intelligence}.

### Improving Model Representation and Reducing KV Cache via Skip   Connections with First Value Heads
**Authors**: Zhoutong Wu, Yuan Zhang, Yiming Dong, Chenheng Zhang, Cong Fang, Kun Yuan, Zhouchen Lin

**Updated**: 2025-10-23T08:29:11Z

**Summary**: Transformer models have driven breakthroughs across various language tasks by their strong capability to learn rich contextual representations. Scaling them to improve representation, however, often demands substantial memory and compute costs, such as the Key-Value (KV) cache used during auto-regressive decoding. Skip connections offer a promising way to improve representation without bloating resource usage, yet most prior works either improve expressivity while leaving KV costs unchanged, or reduce memory at the cost of weaker representation. In this work, we propose SkipV1Former, a Transformer variant that uses skip connections from the first layer's Value heads to strengthen model representation and reduce KV cache. Specifically, from the second block onward, each layer reuses half of its Value heads from the very first layer, while computing the other half as usual-cutting Value projections and V cache by nearly 50 \%. Theoretically, we show that routing uncompressed first-layer Values into deeper layers restores information lost to compression and accelerates the model's implicit mesa-optimization-a key pattern of Transformer in auto-regressive tasks. Empirically, across different model scales, SkipV1Former delivers consistent reductions of approximately 25 \% in KV cache while improving perplexity relative to standard Multi-Head Attention (MHA) Transformers and some advanced variants. Moreover, we propose a recipe for uptraining existing MHA Transformer checkpoints to SkipV1Former with only 10-15\% additional compute. Finally, SkipV1Former can seamlessly combine advanced methods like Group-Query Attention and Multi-Latent Attention to achieve further KV cache savings and performance improvement. When combined with YOCO, it cuts KV cache size by nearly 50 \% while still improving performance.

### Soft Phonon Charge-Density Wave Formation in the Kagome Metal   KV$_3$Sb$_5$
**Authors**: Yifan Wang, Chenchao Xu, Zhimian Wu, Huachen Rao, Zhaoyang Shan, Yi Liu, Guanghan Cao, Michael Smidman, Ming Shi, Huiqiu Yuan, Tao Wu, Xianhui Chen, Chao Cao, Yu Song

**Updated**: 2025-10-23T05:22:09Z

**Summary**: A range of of unusual emergent behaviors have been reported in the charge-density wave (CDW) state of the $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A=~$K, Rb, Cs) kagome metals, including a CDW formation process without soft phonons, which points to an unconventional CDW mechanism. Here, we use inelastic x-ray scattering to show that the CDW in KV$_3$Sb$_5$ forms via phonons that soften to zero energy at the CDW ordering vector ($L$-point) around $T_{\rm CDW}=78$~K. These soft phonons exhibit a remarkable in-plane anisotropy, extending over a much larger momentum range along $L$-$A$ relative to $L$-$H$, which leads to diffuse scattering common among $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$. Using first-principles calculations, we find that the momentum-dependent electron-phonon coupling (EPC) is peaked at $L$ and exhibits the same in-plane anisotropy as the phonon softening. Conversely, the electronic susceptibility is not peaked at $L$ and shows the opposite in-plane anisotropy. Our findings favor momentum-dependent EPC as the driving mechanism of the CDW in KV$_3$Sb$_5$, with a CDW formation process similar to that of transition metal dichalcogenides.

### Not All Heads Matter: A Head-Level KV Cache Compression Method with   Integrated Retrieval and Reasoning
**Authors**: Yu Fu, Zefan Cai, Abedelkadir Asi, Wayne Xiong, Yue Dong, Wen Xiao

**Updated**: 2025-10-23T00:47:24Z

**Summary**: Key-Value (KV) caching is a common technique to enhance the computational efficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs), but its memory overhead grows rapidly with input length. Prior work has shown that not all tokens are equally important for text generation, proposing layer-level KV cache compression to selectively retain key information. Recognizing the distinct roles of attention heads in generation, we propose HeadKV, a head-level KV cache compression method, and HeadKV-R2, which leverages a novel contextual reasoning ability estimation for compression. Our approach operates at the level of individual heads, estimating their importance for contextual QA tasks that require both retrieval and reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks (LongBench, LooGLE), model architectures (e.g., Llama-3-8B-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct), and long-context abilities tests demonstrate that our head-level KV cache compression significantly outperforms strong baselines, particularly in low-resource settings (KV size = 64 & 128). Notably, our method retains just 1.5% of the KV cache while achieving 97% of the performance of the full KV cache on the contextual question answering benchmark.

### Blending Complementary Memory Systems in Hybrid Quadratic-Linear   Transformers
**Authors**: Kazuki Irie, Morris Yau, Samuel J. Gershman

**Updated**: 2025-10-23T00:40:38Z

**Summary**: We develop hybrid memory architectures for general-purpose sequence processing neural networks, that combine key-value memory using softmax attention (KV-memory) with fast weight memory through dynamic synaptic modulation (FW-memory) -- the core principles of quadratic and linear transformers, respectively. These two memory systems have complementary but individually limited properties: KV-memory offers precise retrieval but is constrained by quadratic complexity in sequence length, while FW-memory supports arbitrarily long sequences and enables more expressive computation but sacrifices precise recall. We propose and compare three methods to blend these two systems into a single memory system, differing in how and when input information is delivered to each system, to leverage the strengths of both. We conduct experiments on general language modeling and retrieval tasks by training 340M- and 1.3B-parameter models from scratch, as well as on synthetic algorithmic tasks designed to precisely illustrate the benefits of certain hybrid methods over others. We also evaluate our hybrid memory systems on reinforcement learning in partially observable environments. Overall, we demonstrate how a well-designed hybrid can overcome the limitations of its individual components, offering new insights into the design principle of neural memory systems.

### Detecting and Preventing Latent Risk Accumulation in High-Performance   Software Systems
**Authors**: Jahidul Arafat, Kh. M. Moniruzzaman, Shamim Hossain, Fariha Tasmin

**Updated**: 2025-10-22T23:56:45Z

**Summary**: Modern distributed systems employ aggressive optimization strategies that create latent risks - hidden vulnerabilities where exceptional performance masks catastrophic fragility when optimizations fail. Cache layers achieving 99% hit rates can obscure database bottlenecks until cache failures trigger 100x load amplification and cascading collapse. Current reliability engineering focuses on reactive incident response rather than proactive detection of optimization-induced vulnerabilities. This paper presents the first comprehensive framework for systematic latent risk detection, prevention, and optimization through integrated mathematical modeling, intelligent perturbation testing, and risk-aware performance optimization. We introduce the Latent Risk Index (LRI) that correlates strongly with incident severity (r=0.863, p<0.001), enabling predictive risk assessment. Our framework integrates three systems: HYDRA employing six optimization-aware perturbation strategies achieving 89.7% risk discovery rates, RAVEN providing continuous production monitoring with 92.9% precision and 93.8% recall across 1,748 scenarios, and APEX enabling risk-aware optimization maintaining 96.6% baseline performance while reducing latent risks by 59.2%. Evaluation across three testbed environments demonstrates strong statistical validation with large effect sizes (Cohen d>2.0) and exceptional reproducibility (r>0.92). Production deployment over 24 weeks shows 69.1% mean time to recovery reduction, 78.6% incident severity reduction, and 81 prevented incidents generating 1.44M USD average annual benefits with 3.2-month ROI. Our approach transforms reliability engineering from reactive incident management to proactive risk-aware optimization.

### CoSense-LLM: Semantics at the Edge with Cost- and Uncertainty-Aware   Cloud-Edge Cooperation
**Authors**: Hasan Akgul, Mari Eplik, Javier Rojas, Aina Binti Abdullah, Pieter van der Merwe

**Updated**: 2025-10-22T15:16:56Z

**Summary**: We present CoSense-LLM, an edge-first framework that turns continuous multimodal sensor streams (for example Wi-Fi CSI, IMU, audio, RFID, and lightweight vision) into compact, verifiable semantic tokens and coordinates with large language models under explicit latency, energy, bandwidth, and privacy constraints. CoSense-LLM has four parts: (i) SenseFusion, a lightweight encoder that aligns sensor embeddings with language and compresses them into short discrete code sequences; (ii) Edge-RAG, a local hybrid retrieval layer that grounds generation in site specific policies and notes; (iii) PromptRouter, a cost and uncertainty aware policy that selects edge only generation, edge plus retrieval, or compact cloud escalation; and (iv) Secure Execution, an auditable redaction path that enforces data minimization so raw waveforms never leave the device. The system works with modern serving optimizations, including paged or streaming KV caches, FlashAttention style kernels, speculative decoding, and quantized LoRA adapters, and supports on device personalization and federated updates under non IID drift. Across home, office, and clinic deployments, CoSense-LLM delivers grounded explanations while meeting tight service level objectives: it sustains sub second (p95) end to end latency on edge dominant paths, reduces inter tier token and bandwidth costs by preferring local retrieval grounded responses, and preserves privacy by transmitting only discrete codes and redacted metadata. Ablations show that Edge-RAG improves factual consistency and reduces contradictions, calibrated uncertainty enables selective abstention and controlled escalations, and KV plus decoding accelerators lower energy per decision. The results support an edge first design that treats semantics, privacy, and predictable latency as co equal goals for large model deployments in interference prone environments.

**Updated**: 2025-10-22T14:33:49Z

**Summary**: Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to autoregressive (AR) LLMs, leveraging denoising-based generation to enable inherent parallelism. Even more and more open-sourced dLLM models emerge, yet their widespread adoption remains constrained by the lack of a standardized and efficient inference framework. We present dInfer, an efficient and extensible framework for dLLM inference. dInfer decomposes the inference pipeline into four modular components--model, diffusion iteration manager, decoding strategy, and KV-cache manager--and integrates novel algorithms for each component alongside system-level optimizations. Through this combination of algorithmic innovations and system enhancements, dInfer achieves substantial efficiency gains without compromising output quality on LLaDA-MoE. At batch size 1, it surpasses 1,100 tokens per second on HumanEval and averages over 800 tokens per second across six benchmarks on $8\times$ H800 GPUs. Compared to prior systems, dInfer delivers a $10\times$ speedup over Fast-dLLM while maintaining similar model performance. Even compared to the AR model (with a comparable number of activation parameters and performance) QWen2.5-3B, which is highly optimized with the latest vLLM inference engine, dInfer still delivers a $2$-$3\times$ speedup. The implementation of dInfer is open-sourced at https://github.com/inclusionAI/dInfer.

### Stream: Scaling up Mechanistic Interpretability to Long Context in LLMs   via Sparse Attention
**Authors**: J Rosser, José Luis Redondo García, Gustavo Penha, Konstantina Palla, Hugues Bouchard

**Updated**: 2025-10-22T09:42:29Z

**Summary**: As Large Language Models (LLMs) scale to million-token contexts, traditional Mechanistic Interpretability techniques for analyzing attention scale quadratically with context length, demanding terabytes of memory beyond 100,000 tokens. We introduce Sparse Tracing, a novel technique that leverages dynamic sparse attention to efficiently analyze long context attention patterns. We present Stream, a compilable hierarchical pruning algorithm that estimates per-head sparse attention masks in near-linear time $O(T \log T)$ and linear space $O(T)$, enabling one-pass interpretability at scale. Stream performs a binary-search-style refinement to retain only the top-$k$ key blocks per query while preserving the model's next-token behavior. We apply Stream to long chain-of-thought reasoning traces and identify thought anchors while pruning 97-99\% of token interactions. On the RULER benchmark, Stream preserves critical retrieval paths while discarding 90-96\% of interactions and exposes layer-wise routes from the needle to output. Our method offers a practical drop-in tool for analyzing attention patterns and tracing information flow without terabytes of caches. By making long context interpretability feasible on consumer GPUs, Sparse Tracing helps democratize chain-of-thought monitoring. Code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/stream-03B8/.

### LAPRAD: LLM-Assisted PRotocol Attack Discovery
**Authors**: R. Can Aygun, Yehuda Afek, Anat Bremler-Barr, Leonard Kleinrock

**Updated**: 2025-10-22T05:47:41Z

**Summary**: With the goal of improving the security of Internet protocols, we seek faster, semi-automatic methods to discover new vulnerabilities in protocols such as DNS, BGP, and others. To this end, we introduce the LLM-Assisted Protocol Attack Discovery (LAPRAD) methodology, enabling security researchers with some DNS knowledge to efficiently uncover vulnerabilities that would otherwise be hard to detect.   LAPRAD follows a three-stage process. In the first, we consult an LLM (GPT-o1) that has been trained on a broad corpus of DNS-related sources and previous DDoS attacks to identify potential exploits. In the second stage, a different LLM automatically constructs the corresponding attack configurations using the ReACT approach implemented via LangChain (DNS zone file generation). Finally, in the third stage, we validate the attack's functionality and effectiveness.   Using LAPRAD, we uncovered three new DDoS attacks on the DNS protocol and rediscovered two recently reported ones that were not included in the LLM's training data. The first new attack employs a bait-and-switch technique to trick resolvers into caching large, bogus DNSSEC RRSIGs, reducing their serving capacity to as little as 6%. The second exploits large DNSSEC encryption algorithms (RSA-4096) with multiple keys, thereby bypassing a recently implemented default RRSet limit. The third leverages ANY-type responses to produce a similar effect.   These variations of a cache-flushing DDoS attack, called SigCacheFlush, circumvent existing patches, severely degrade resolver query capacity, and impact the latest versions of major DNS resolver implementations.

### PruneHal: Reducing Hallucinations in Multi-modal Large Language Models   through Adaptive KV Cache Pruning
**Authors**: Fengyuan Sun, Hui Chen, Xinhao Xu, Dandan Zheng, Jingdong Chen, Jun Zhou, Jungong Han, Guiguang Ding

**Updated**: 2025-10-22T02:41:07Z

**Summary**: While multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in recent years, the issue of hallucinations remains a major challenge. To mitigate this phenomenon, existing solutions either introduce additional data for further training or incorporate external or internal information during inference. However, these approaches inevitably introduce extra computational costs. In this paper, we observe that hallucinations in MLLMs are strongly associated with insufficient attention allocated to visual tokens. In particular, the presence of redundant visual tokens disperses the model's attention, preventing it from focusing on the most informative ones. As a result, critical visual cues are often under-attended, which in turn exacerbates the occurrence of hallucinations. Building on this observation, we propose \textbf{PruneHal}, a training-free, simple yet effective method that leverages adaptive KV cache pruning to enhance the model's focus on critical visual information, thereby mitigating hallucinations. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to apply token pruning for hallucination mitigation in MLLMs. Notably, our method don't require additional training and incurs nearly no extra inference cost. Moreover, PruneHal is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated with different decoding strategies, including those specifically designed for hallucination mitigation. We evaluate PruneHal on several widely used hallucination evaluation benchmarks using four mainstream MLLMs, achieving robust and outstanding results that highlight the effectiveness and superiority of our method. Our code will be publicly available.

### Think Straight, Stop Smart: Structured Reasoning for Efficient Multi-Hop   RAG
**Authors**: Jihwan Bang, Juntae Lee, Seunghan Yang, Sungha Choi

**Updated**: 2025-10-22T02:09:23Z

**Summary**: Multi-hop retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a promising strategy for complex reasoning, yet existing iterative prompting approaches remain inefficient. They often regenerate predictable token sequences at every step and rely on stochastic stopping, leading to excessive token usage and unstable termination. We propose TSSS (Think Straight, Stop Smart), a structured multi-hop RAG framework designed for efficiency. TSSS introduces (i) a template-based reasoning that caches recurring prefixes and anchors sub-queries to the main question, reducing token generation cost while promoting stable reasoning, and (ii) a retriever-based terminator, which deterministically halts reasoning once additional sub-queries collapse into repetition. This separation of structured reasoning and termination control enables both faster inference and more reliable answers. On HotpotQA, 2WikiMultiHop, and MuSiQue, TSSS achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and competitive efficiency among RAG-CoT approaches, highlighting its effectiveness in efficiency-constrained scenarios such as on-device inference.

### LLMBridge: Reducing Costs to Access LLMs in a Prompt-Centric Internet
**Authors**: Noah Martin, Abdullah Bin Faisal, Hiba Eltigani, Rukhshan Haroon, Swaminathan Lamelas, Fahad Dogar

**Updated**: 2025-10-21T22:37:11Z

**Summary**: Today's Internet infrastructure is centered around content retrieval over HTTP, with middleboxes (e.g., HTTP proxies) playing a crucial role in performance, security, and cost-effectiveness. We envision a future where Internet communication will be dominated by "prompts" sent to generative AI models. For this, we will need proxies that provide similar functions to HTTP proxies (e.g., caching, routing, compression) while dealing with unique challenges and opportunities of prompt-based communication. As a first step toward supporting prompt-based communication, we present LLMBridge, an LLM proxy designed for cost-conscious users, such as those in developing regions and education (e.g., students, instructors). LLMBridge supports three key optimizations: model selection (routing prompts to the most suitable model), context management (intelligently reducing the amount of context), and semantic caching (serving prompts using local models and vector databases). These optimizations introduce trade-offs between cost and quality, which applications navigate through a high-level, bidirectional interface. As case studies, we deploy LLMBridge in two cost-sensitive settings: a WhatsApp-based Q&A service and a university classroom environment. The WhatsApp service has been live for over twelve months, serving 100+ users and handling more than 14.7K requests. In parallel, we exposed LLMBridge to students across three computer science courses over a semester, where it supported diverse LLM-powered applications - such as reasoning agents and chatbots - and handled an average of 500 requests per day. We report on deployment experiences across both settings and use the collected workloads to benchmark the effectiveness of various cost-optimization strategies, analyzing their trade-offs in cost, latency, and response quality.

### DFUSE: Strongly Consistent Write-Back Kernel Caching for Distributed   Userspace File Systems
**Authors**: Haoyu Li, Jingkai Fu, Qing Li, Windsor Hsu, Asaf Cidon

**Updated**: 2025-10-21T21:07:17Z

**Summary**: Cloud platforms host thousands of tenants that demand POSIX semantics, high throughput, and rapid evolution from their storage layer. Kernel-native distributed file systems supply raw speed, but their privileged code base couples every release to the kernel, widens the blast radius of crashes, and slows innovation. FUSE-based distributed file systems flip those trade-offs: they run in user space for fast deployment and strong fault isolation, yet the FUSE interface disables the kernel's write-back page cache whenever strong consistency is required. Practitioners must therefore choose between (i) weak consistency with fast write-back caching or (ii) strong consistency with slow write-through I/O, a limitation that has kept FUSE distributed file systems out of write-intensive cloud workloads.   To this end, we present DFUSE, the first distributed FUSE file system that delivers write-back kernel caching and strong consistency. DFUSE achieves this by offloading userspace consistency control to the kernel driver, allowing coordinated access to the kernel's page cache across nodes. This design eliminates blind local cache updates and ensures cluster-wide strong consistency without compromising performance. In our evaluation, DFUSE achieves up to 68.0% higher throughput and 40.4% lower latency than the existing write-through design of FUSE-based distributed file systems.

### Putting the Context back into Memory
**Authors**: David A. Roberts

**Updated**: 2025-10-21T16:32:50Z

**Summary**: Requests arriving at main memory are often different from what programmers can observe or estimate by using CPU-based monitoring. Hardware cache prefetching, memory request scheduling and interleaving cause a loss of observability that limits potential data movement and tiering optimizations. In response, memory-side telemetry hardware like page access heat map units (HMU) and page prefetchers were proposed to inform Operating Systems with accurate usage data. However, it is still hard to map memory activity to software program functions and objects because of the decoupled nature of host processors and memory devices. Valuable program context is stripped out from the memory bus, leaving only commands, addresses and data. Programmers have expert knowledge of future data accesses, priorities, and access to processor state, which could be useful hints for runtime memory device optimization. This paper makes context visible at memory devices by encoding any user-visible state as detectable packets in the memory read address stream, in a nondestructive manner without significant capacity overhead, drivers or special access privileges. We prototyped an end-to-end system with metadata injection that can be reliably detected and decoded from a memory address trace, either by a host processor, or a memory module. We illustrate a use case with precise code execution markers and object address range tracking. In the future, real time metadata decoding with near-memory computing (NMC) could provide customized telemetry and statistics to users, or act on application hints to perform functions like prioritizing requests, remapping data and reconfiguring devices.

### SSD: Spatial-Semantic Head Decoupling for Efficient Autoregressive Image   Generation
**Authors**: Siyong Jian, Huan Wang

**Updated**: 2025-10-21T15:17:37Z

**Summary**: Autoregressive image generation models like Janus-Pro produce high-quality images, but at the significant cost of high memory and ever-growing computational demands due to the large number of visual tokens. While KV cache compression has been extensively studied in language modeling, it still remains largely unexplored for the image generation domain. In this work, we begin by identifying a distinct and prominent attention phenomenon, which we term spatial locality and emergent semantic sink. To leverage this key insight, we introduce a novel KV cache compression framework. Specifically, we compress the KV cache for all visual tokens by adaptively decoupling attention heads into two separate types: for spatial-locality heads, our method maintains a short recent token window; for semantic-sink heads, it strategically preserves a compact set of highly-attended tokens. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a 5$\times$ reduction in memory usage and a notable 6.6$\times$ speedup in overall throughput with only minimal visual quality loss, thereby enabling highly efficient native autoregressive image generation on resource-constrained hardware.

### ParaLog: Consistent Host-side Logging for Parallel Checkpoints
**Authors**: Steven W. D. Chien, Kento Sato, Artur Podobas, Niclas Jansson, Stefano Markidis, Michio Honda

**Updated**: 2025-10-21T15:13:47Z

**Summary**: Output-intensive scientific applications are highly sensitive to low storage throughput. While existing scientific application stacks are optimized for traditional High-Performance Computing (HPC) environments with high remote storage and network bandwidth, these assumptions often fail in modern settings like cloud deployment. This is because the existing scientific application I/O stack fails to leverage the available resources. At the same time, scientific applications exhibit special synchronization and data output requirements that are difficult to satisfy using traditional approaches such as block-level or filesystem-level caching. We introduce ParaLog, a distributed host-side logging approach designed to accelerate scientific applications transparently. ParaLog emphasizes deployability, enabling support for unmodified message passing interface (MPI) applications and implementations while preserving crash consistency semantics. We evaluate ParaLog across traditional HPC, cloud HPC, local clusters, and hybrid environments, demonstrating its capability to reduce end-to-end execution time by 13-26% for popular scientific applications in cloud settings.

### Reasoning Language Model Inference Serving Unveiled: An Empirical Study
**Authors**: Qi Li, Junpan Wu, Xiang Liu, Yuxin Wang, Zeyu Li, Zhenheng Tang, Yuhan Chen, Shaohuai Shi, Xiaowen Chu

**Updated**: 2025-10-21T14:25:51Z

**Summary**: The reasoning large language model (RLLM) has been proven competitive in solving complex reasoning tasks such as mathematics, coding, compared to general LLM. However, the serving performance and behavior of RLLM remains unexplored, which may undermine the deployment and utilization of RLLM in real-world scenario. To close this gap, in this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study of RLLM service. We first perform a pilot study on comparing the serving performance between RLLM and traditional LLM and reveal that there are several distinct differences regarding serving behavior: (1) significant memory usage and fluctuations; (2) straggler requests; (3) adaptive running time; (4) domain preference. Then we further investigate whether existing inference optimization techniques are valid for RLLM. Our main takeaways are that model quantization methods and speculative decoding can improve service system efficiency with small compromise to RLLM accuracy, while prefix caching, KV cache quantization may even degrade accuracy or serving performance for small RLLM. Lastly, we conduct evaluation under real world workload modeled by Gamma distribution to verify our findings. Empirical results of real world workload evaluation across different dataset are aligned with our main findings regarding RLLM serving. We hope our work can provide the research community and industry with insights to advance RLLM inference serving.

### Tokencake: A KV-Cache-centric Serving Framework for LLM-based   Multi-Agent Applications
**Authors**: Zhuohang Bian, Feiyang Wu, Teng Ma, Youwei Zhuo

**Updated**: 2025-10-21T12:39:32Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in complex multi-agent applications that use external function calls. This workload creates severe performance challenges for the KV Cache: space contention leads to the eviction of critical agents' caches and time underutilization leaves the cache of agents stalled on long-running tool calls idling in GPU memory. We present Tokencake, a KV-Cache-centric serving framework that co-optimizes scheduling and memory management with an agent-aware design. Tokencake's Space Scheduler uses dynamic memory partitioning to shield critical agents from contention, while its Time Scheduler employs a proactive offload and predictive upload mechanism to repurpose GPU memory during function call stalls. Our evaluation on representative multi-agent benchmarks shows that Tokencake can reduce end-to-end latency by over 47.06%, improve effective GPU memory utilization by up to 16.9% compared to vLLM.

### EfficientNav: Towards On-Device Object-Goal Navigation with Navigation   Map Caching and Retrieval
**Authors**: Zebin Yang, Sunjian Zheng, Tong Xie, Tianshi Xu, Bo Yu, Fan Wang, Jie Tang, Shaoshan Liu, Meng Li

**Updated**: 2025-10-21T11:52:44Z

**Summary**: Object-goal navigation (ObjNav) tasks an agent with navigating to the location of a specific object in an unseen environment. Embodied agents equipped with large language models (LLMs) and online constructed navigation maps can perform ObjNav in a zero-shot manner. However, existing agents heavily rely on giant LLMs on the cloud, e.g., GPT-4, while directly switching to small LLMs, e.g., LLaMA3.2-11b, suffer from significant success rate drops due to limited model capacity for understanding complex navigation maps, which prevents deploying ObjNav on local devices. At the same time, the long prompt introduced by the navigation map description will cause high planning latency on local devices. In this paper, we propose EfficientNav to enable on-device efficient LLM-based zero-shot ObjNav. To help the smaller LLMs better understand the environment, we propose semantics-aware memory retrieval to prune redundant information in navigation maps. To reduce planning latency, we propose discrete memory caching and attention-based memory clustering to efficiently save and re-use the KV cache. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that EfficientNav achieves 11.1% improvement in success rate on HM3D benchmark over GPT-4-based baselines, and demonstrates 6.7x real-time latency reduction and 4.7x end-to-end latency reduction over GPT-4 planner. Our code will be released soon.

### VLA-Cache: Efficient Vision-Language-Action Manipulation via Adaptive   Token Caching
**Authors**: Siyu Xu, Yunke Wang, Chenghao Xia, Dihao Zhu, Tao Huang, Chang Xu

**Updated**: 2025-10-21T10:33:29Z

**Summary**: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated strong multi-modal reasoning capabilities, enabling direct action generation from visual perception and language instructions in an end-to-end manner. However, their substantial computational cost poses a challenge for real-time robotic control, where rapid decision-making is essential. This paper introduces VLA-Cache, a training-free inference acceleration method that reduces computational overhead by adaptively caching and reusing static visual tokens across frames. Exploiting the temporal continuity in robotic manipulation, VLA-Cache identifies minimally changed tokens between adjacent frames and reuses their cached key-value representations, thereby circumventing redundant computations. Additionally, to maintain action precision, VLA-Cache selectively re-computes task-relevant tokens that are environmentally sensitive, ensuring the fidelity of critical visual information. To further optimize efficiency, we introduce a layer adaptive token reusing strategy that dynamically adjusts the reuse ratio based on attention concentration across decoder layers, prioritizing critical tokens for recomputation. Extensive experiments on two simulation platforms (LIBERO and SIMPLER) and a real-world robotic system demonstrate that VLA-Cache achieves up to 1.7x speedup in CUDA latency and a 15% increase in control frequency, with negligible loss on task success rate.

### Tree of Agents: Improving Long-Context Capabilities of Large Language   Models through Multi-Perspective Reasoning
**Authors**: Song Yu, Xiaofei Xu, Ke Deng, Li Li, Lin Tian

**Updated**: 2025-10-21T10:08:33Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) face persistent challenges when handling long-context tasks, most notably the lost in the middle issue, where information located in the middle of a long input tends to be underutilized. Some existing methods that reduce input have the risk of discarding key information, while others that extend context windows often lead to attention dispersion. To address these limitations, we propose Tree of Agents (TOA), a multi-agent reasoning framework that segments the input into chunks processed by independent agents. Each agent generates its local cognition, then agents dynamically exchange information for collaborative reasoning along tree-structured paths. TOA enables agents to probe different reasoning orders for multi-perspective understanding, effectively mitigating position bias and reducing hallucinations. To improve processing efficiency, we incorporate prefix-hash caching and adaptive pruning strategies, achieving significant performance improvements with comparable API overhead. Experiments show that TOA, powered by compact LLaMA3.1-8B, significantly outperforms multiple baselines and demonstrates comparable performance to the latest and much larger commercial models, such as Gemini1.5-pro, on various long-context tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/Aireduce952/Tree-of-Agents.

**Updated**: 2025-10-21T10:00:32Z

**Summary**: Diffusion language models (DLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to the long-dominant autoregressive (AR) paradigm, offering a parallelable decoding process that could yield greater efficiency. Yet, in practice, current open-source DLMs often underperform their AR counterparts in speed, limiting their real-world utility. This work presents a systematic study of DLM efficiency, identifying key issues in prior evaluation methods. Through empirical benchmarking and a roofline-based theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that AR models generally achieve higher throughput, while DLMs consistently lag. We also investigate acceleration strategies, finding that techniques like dual cache and parallel decoding mainly offer gains at small batch sizes, with their benefits diminishing upon scaling. Our findings underscore the necessity of robust evaluation methods and improved acceleration strategies to advance research on DLMs.

### Adamas: Hadamard Sparse Attention for Efficient Long-Context Inference
**Authors**: Siyuan Yan, Guo-Qing Jiang, Yuchen Zhang, Xiaoxing Ma, Ran Zhu, Chun Cao, Jingwei Xu

**Updated**: 2025-10-21T08:44:47Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) now support context windows of hundreds of thousands to millions of tokens, enabling applications such as long-document summarization, large-scale code synthesis, multi-document question answering and persistent multi-turn dialogue. However, such extended contexts exacerbate the quadratic cost of self-attention, leading to severe latency in autoregressive decoding. Existing sparse attention methods alleviate these costs but rely on heuristic patterns that struggle to recall critical key-value (KV) pairs for each query, resulting in accuracy degradation. We introduce Adamas, a lightweight yet highly accurate sparse attention mechanism designed for long-context inference. Adamas applies the Hadamard transform, bucketization and 2-bit compression to produce compact representations, and leverages Manhattan-distance estimation for efficient top-k selections. Experiments show that Adamas matches the accuracy of full attention with only a 64-token budget, achieves near-lossless performance at 128, and supports up to 8x higher sparsity than prior state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods while delivering up to 4.4x self-attention and 1.5x end-to-end speedups on 32K-length sequences. Remarkably, Adamas attains comparable or even lower perplexity than full attention, underscoring its effectiveness in maintaining accuracy under aggressive sparsity.

### The Early Bird Catches the Leak: Unveiling Timing Side Channels in LLM   Serving Systems
**Authors**: Linke Song, Zixuan Pang, Wenhao Wang, Zihao Wang, XiaoFeng Wang, Hongbo Chen, Wei Song, Yier Jin, Dan Meng, Rui Hou

**Updated**: 2025-10-21T06:47:29Z

**Summary**: The wide deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) has given rise to strong demands for optimizing their inference performance. Today's techniques serving this purpose primarily focus on reducing latency and improving throughput through algorithmic and hardware enhancements, while largely overlooking their privacy side effects, particularly in a multi-user environment. In our research, for the first time, we discovered a set of new timing side channels in LLM systems, arising from shared caches and GPU memory allocations, which can be exploited to infer both confidential system prompts and those issued by other users. These vulnerabilities echo security challenges observed in traditional computing systems, highlighting an urgent need to address potential information leakage in LLM serving infrastructures. In this paper, we report novel attack strategies designed to exploit such timing side channels inherent in LLM deployments, specifically targeting the Key-Value (KV) cache and semantic cache widely used to enhance LLM inference performance. Our approach leverages timing measurements and classification models to detect cache hits, allowing an adversary to infer private prompts with high accuracy. We also propose a token-by-token search algorithm to efficiently recover shared prompt prefixes in the caches, showing the feasibility of stealing system prompts and those produced by peer users. Our experimental studies on black-box testing of popular online LLM services demonstrate that such privacy risks are completely realistic, with significant consequences. Our findings underscore the need for robust mitigation to protect LLM systems against such emerging threats.

### A fast MPI-based Distributed Hash-Table as Surrogate Model demonstrated   in a coupled reactive transport HPC simulation
**Authors**: Max Lübke, Marco De Lucia, Steffen Christgau, Stefan Petri, Bettina Schnor

**Updated**: 2025-10-21T06:30:21Z

**Summary**: Surrogate models can play a pivotal role in enhancing performance in contemporary High-Performance Computing applications. Cache-based surrogates use already calculated simulation results to interpolate or extrapolate further simulation output values. But this approach only pays off if the access time to retrieve the needed values is much faster than the actual simulation. While the most existing key-value stores use a Client-Server architecture with dedicated storage nodes, this is not the most suitable architecture for HPC applications. Instead, we propose a distributed architecture where the parallel processes offer a part of their available memory to build a shared distributed hash table based on MPI. This paper presents three DHT approaches with the special requirements of HPC applications in mind. The presented lock-free design outperforms both DHT versions which use explicit synchronization by coarse-grained resp. fine-grained locking. The lock-free DHT shows very good scaling regarding read and write performance. The runtime of a coupled reactive transport simulation was improved between 14% and 42% using the lock-free DHT as a surrogate model.

### StreamingTOM: Streaming Token Compression for Efficient Video   Understanding
**Authors**: Xueyi Chen, Keda Tao, Kele Shao, Huan Wang

**Updated**: 2025-10-21T03:39:41Z

**Summary**: Unlike offline processing, streaming video vision-language models face two fundamental constraints: causality and accumulation. Causality prevents access to future frames that offline methods exploit, while accumulation causes tokens to grow unbounded, creating efficiency bottlenecks. However, existing approaches only regulate post-LLM kv-cache, leaving costly pre-LLM prefill unchanged. We introduce StreamingTOM, a training-free, plug-and-play two-stage framework that addresses both pre-LLM and post-LLM bottlenecks with predictable latency. Causal Temporal Reduction imposes a fixed per-frame budget and selects tokens based on adjacent-frame changes and token saliency, drastically reducing per-frame prefill cost by processing only a compact subset of visual tokens per frame instead of all visual tokens. Online Quantized Memory stores tokens in 4-bit format, retrieves relevant groups on demand, and dequantizes them, keeping the active kv-cache bounded regardless of stream length. Experiments demonstrate our method achieves $15.7\times$ kv-cache compression, $1.2\times$ lower peak memory and $2\times$ faster TTFT compared to prior SOTA. StreamingTOM maintains state-of-the-art accuracy among training-free methods with an average of $63.8\%$ on offline benchmarks and $55.8\%/3.7$ on RVS. These results highlight the practical benefits of our two-stage approach for efficient streaming video understanding with bounded growth.

### SparseVILA: Decoupling Visual Sparsity for Efficient VLM Inference
**Authors**: Samir Khaki, Junxian Guo, Jiaming Tang, Shang Yang, Yukang Chen, Konstantinos N. Plataniotis, Yao Lu, Song Han, Zhijian Liu

**Updated**: 2025-10-20T17:35:47Z

**Summary**: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have rapidly advanced in integrating visual and textual reasoning, powering applications across high-resolution image understanding, long-video analysis, and multi-turn conversation. However, their scalability remains limited by the growing number of visual tokens that dominate inference latency. We present SparseVILA, a new paradigm for efficient VLM inference that decouples visual sparsity across the prefilling and decoding stages. SparseVILA distributes sparsity across stages by pruning redundant visual tokens during prefill and retrieving only query-relevant tokens during decoding. This decoupled design matches leading prefill pruning methods while preserving multi-turn fidelity by retaining most of the visual cache so that query-aware tokens can be retrieved at each conversation round. Built on an AWQ-optimized inference pipeline, SparseVILA achieves up to 4.0 times faster prefilling, 2.5 times faster decoding, and an overall 2.6 times end-to-end speedup on long-context video tasks -- while improving accuracy on document-understanding and reasoning tasks. By decoupling query-agnostic pruning and query-aware retrieval, SparseVILA establishes a new direction for efficient multimodal inference, offering a training-free, architecture-agnostic framework for accelerating large VLMs without sacrificing capability.

### StreamingThinker: Large Language Models Can Think While Reading
**Authors**: Junlong Tong, Yingqi Fan, Anhao Zhao, Yunpu Ma, Xiaoyu Shen

**Updated**: 2025-10-20T07:27:37Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in chain of thought (CoT) reasoning. However, the current LLM reasoning paradigm initiates thinking only after the entire input is available, which introduces unnecessary latency and weakens attention to earlier information in dynamic scenarios. Inspired by human cognition of thinking while reading, we first design a \textit{\textbf{streaming thinking}} paradigm for LLMs, where reasoning unfolds in the order of input and further adjusts its depth once reading is complete. We instantiate this paradigm with \textit{StreamingThinker}, a framework that enables LLMs to think while reading through the integration of streaming CoT generation, streaming-constraint training, and streaming parallel inference. Specifically, StreamingThinker employs streaming reasoning units with quality control for CoT generation, enforces order-preserving reasoning through streaming attention masks and position encoding, and leverages parallel KV caches that decouple input encoding from reasoning generation, thereby ensuring alignment and enabling true concurrency. We evaluate StreamingThinker on the Qwen3 model family across math reasoning, logical reasoning, and context-based QA reasoning tasks. Experimental results show that the StreamingThinker preserves performance comparable to batch thinking, while yielding an 80\% reduction in token waiting before the onset of reasoning and a more than 60\% reduction in time-level latency for producing the final answer, demonstrating the effectiveness of the streaming paradigm for LLM reasoning. Code will be released at \href{https://github.com/EIT-NLP/StreamingLLM/tree/main/StreamingThinker}{this repository.}

### Can Transformer Memory Be Corrupted? Investigating Cache-Side   Vulnerabilities in Large Language Models
**Authors**: Elias Hossain, Swayamjit Saha, Somshubhra Roy, Ravi Prasad

**Updated**: 2025-10-20T02:04:18Z

**Summary**: Even when prompts and parameters are secured, transformer language models remain vulnerable because their key-value (KV) cache during inference constitutes an overlooked attack surface. This paper introduces Malicious Token Injection (MTI), a modular framework that systematically perturbs cached key vectors at selected layers and timesteps through controlled magnitude and frequency, using additive Gaussian noise, zeroing, and orthogonal rotations. A theoretical analysis quantifies how these perturbations propagate through attention, linking logit deviations to the Frobenius norm of corruption and softmax Lipschitz dynamics. Empirical results show that MTI significantly alters next-token distributions and downstream task performance across GPT-2 and LLaMA-2/7B, as well as destabilizes retrieval-augmented and agentic reasoning pipelines. These findings identify cache integrity as a critical yet underexplored vulnerability in current LLM deployments, positioning cache corruption as a reproducible and theoretically grounded threat model for future robustness and security research.

**Updated**: 2025-10-19T23:17:13Z

**Summary**: Video reasoning using Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) relies on costly reinforcement learning (RL) and verbose chain-of-thought, resulting in substantial computational overhead during both training and inference. Moreover, the mechanisms that control the thinking process in these reasoning models are very limited. In this paper, using entropy of the model's output as a signal, we discover that the high-quality models go through a series of micro-explorations and micro-exploitations which keep the reasoning process grounded (i.e., avoid excessive randomness while the model is exploring or thinking through an answer). We further observe that once this "thinking" process is over, more accurate models demonstrate a better convergence by reducing the entropy significantly via a final exploitation phase (i.e., a more certain convergence towards a solution trajectory). We then use these novel, theoretically-grounded insights to tune the model's behavior directly at inference, without using any RL or supervised fine-tuning. Specifically, during inference, our proposed approach called V-Reason (Video-Reason) adapts the value cache of the LMM via a few optimization steps on a small, trainable controller using an entropy-based objective, i.e., no supervision from any dataset or RL is necessary. This tuning improves the model's micro-exploration and exploitation behavior during inference. Our experiments show that our proposed method achieves significant improvements over the base instruction-tuned models across several video reasoning datasets, narrowing the gap with RL-trained models to within 0.6% average accuracy without any training, while offering massive efficiency benefits: output tokens are reduced by 58.6% compared to the RL model.

### Addendum: Systematic Evaluation of Randomized Cache Designs against   Cache Occupancy
**Authors**: Anirban Chakraborty, Nimish Mishra, Sayandeep Saha, Sarani Bhattacharya, Debdeep Mukhopadhyay

**Updated**: 2025-10-19T15:13:25Z

**Summary**: In the main text published at USENIX Security 2025, we presented a systematic analysis of the role of cache occupancy in the design considerations for randomized caches (from the perspectives of performance and security). On the performance front, we presented a uniform benchmarking strategy that allows for a fair comparison among different randomized cache designs. Likewise, from the security perspective, we presented three threat assumptions: (1) covert channels; (2) process fingerprinting side-channel; and (3) AES key recovery. The main takeaway of our work is an open problem of designing a randomized cache of comparable efficiency with modern set-associative LLCs, while still resisting both contention-based and occupancy-based attacks. This note is meant as an addendum to the main text in light of the observations made in [2]. To summarize, the authors in [2] argue that (1) L1d cache size plays a role in adversarial success, and that (2) a patched version of MIRAGE with randomized initial seeding of global eviction map prevents leakage of AES key. We discuss the same in this addendum.

**Authors**: Mariam Rakka, Marios Fournarakis, Olga Krestinskaya, Jinane Bazzi, Khaled N. Salama, Fadi Kurdahi, Ahmed M. Eltawil, Mohammed E. Fouda

**Updated**: 2025-10-19T12:16:40Z

**Summary**: The rapid scaling of language models (LMs) has resulted in unprecedented computational, memory, and energy requirements, making their training and deployment increasingly unsustainable. Quantization has emerged as an essential compression technique to reduce model size, alleviate memory bottlenecks, and accelerate inference. However, while uniform low-bit quantization (e.g., INT8, INT4) provides significant efficiency gains, it can degrade accuracy in sensitive components of transformer-based LMs. Mixed-precision quantization offers a promising alternative by selectively allocating precision across layers or within tensors to balance efficiency and accuracy. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of Mixed-Precision quantization frameworks for LMs (MXPLMs). We first review quantization fundamentals, including uniform and non-uniform quantizers, quantization granularity, and methods widely used in post-training quantization. We then categorize and compare recent MXPLM frameworks according to their bit allocation strategies and precision configurations across weights, activations, and key-value caches. A comparative analysis highlights differences in perplexity, zero-shot task performance, and deployment trade-offs. Furthermore, we contrast MXPLMs with earlier mixed-precision quantization methods for deep neural networks, identifying strategies that transfer and those that face challenges in the LM setting. Finally, we summarize open issues and future directions, including hardware-aware design, activation quantization, and scalable optimization methods for billion-parameter models. By consolidating recent advances, this work serves as a reference for understanding the current landscape and research prospects of mixed-precision quantization for large-scale language models.

### AnTKV: Anchor Token-Aware Sub-Bit Vector Quantization for KV Cache in   Large Language Models
**Authors**: Zeyu Li, Chuanfu Xiao, Yang Wang, Xiang Liu, Zhenheng Tang, Baotong Lu, Mao Yang, Xinyu Chen, Xiaowen Chu

**Updated**: 2025-10-18T11:29:52Z

**Summary**: Quantization has emerged as an effective and lightweight solution to reduce the memory footprint of the KV cache in Large Language Models. Nevertheless, minimizing the accuracy degradation caused by ultra-low-bit KV cache quantization remains a significant challenge. While scalar quantization is constrained by 1-bit bound, vector quantization exploits intra-vector correlations and enables sub-bit regimes, making it more suitable for ultra-low-bit quantization. To further mitigate quantization-induced degradation, we reveal that the degradation is highly uneven across tokens in attention quality. To investigate this unevenness, we introduce anchor score to measure each token's sensitivity to quantization. Our analysis and experiments show that preserving a small subset (1\%) of tokens with the highest Anchor Score significantly mitigates accuracy loss under aggressive quantization.   We propose AnTKV, a dual-stage framework that leverages anchor token-aware vector quantization to compress the KV cache. It combines offline token-aware centroids learning and online anchor token selection to balance compression and accuracy. To enable efficient deployment, we design an online anchor token selection kernel compatible with FlashAttention. It allows LLaMA3-8B to scale to 840K tokens on a single 80GB A100, while delivering up to $3.5\times$ higher decoding throughput over the FP16 baseline. Experiments demonstrate that AnTKV matches or surpasses prior methods at 4-bit, and significantly reduce perplexity under ultra-low-bit quantization, achieving 6.32 at 1-bit on Mistral-7B, compared to 7.25 for CQ and 15.36 for KVQuant.

### MPCache: MPC-Friendly KV Cache Eviction for Efficient Private LLM   Inference
**Authors**: Wenxuan Zeng, Ye Dong, Jinjin Zhou, Jin Tan, Lei Wang, Tao Wei, Runsheng Wang, Meng Li

**Updated**: 2025-10-18T06:04:53Z

**Summary**: Private large language model (LLM) inference based on secure multi-party computation (MPC) achieves formal data privacy protection but suffers from significant latency overhead, especially for long input sequences. While key-value (KV) cache eviction and sparse attention algorithms have been proposed for efficient LLM inference in plaintext, they are not designed for MPC and cannot benefit private LLM inference directly. In this paper, we propose an accurate and MPC-friendly KV cache eviction framework, dubbed MPCache, building on the observation that historical tokens in a long sequence may have different effects on the downstream decoding. Hence, MPCache combines a look-once static eviction algorithm to discard unimportant KV cache and a query-aware dynamic selection algorithm to activate only a small subset of KV cache for attention computation. MPCache further incorporates a series of optimizations for efficient dynamic KV cache selection, including MPC-friendly similarity approximation, hierarchical KV cache clustering, and cross-layer index-sharing strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MPCache consistently outperforms prior-art KV cache eviction baselines across different generation tasks and achieves 1.8 ~ 2.01x and 3.39 ~ 8.37x decoding latency and communication reduction on different sequence lengths, respectively.

### Autoencoding-Free Context Compression for LLMs via Contextual Semantic   Anchors
**Authors**: Xin Liu, Runsong Zhao, Pengcheng Huang, Xinyu Liu, Junyi Xiao, Chunyang Xiao, Tong Xiao, Shengxiang Gao, Zhengtao Yu, Jingbo Zhu

**Updated**: 2025-10-18T02:48:35Z

**Summary**: Context compression presents a promising approach for accelerating large language model (LLM) inference by compressing long contexts into compact representations. Current context compression methods predominantly rely on autoencoding tasks to train context-agnostic compression tokens to compress contextual semantics. While autoencoding tasks enable compression tokens to acquire compression capabilities, compression via autoencoding tasks creates a fundamental mismatch: the models are optimized for reconstruction that diverge from actual downstream tasks, thereby weakening the features more beneficial for real-world usage. We propose Semantic-Anchor Compression (SAC), a novel method that shifts from autoencoding task based compression to an architecture that is equipped with this compression capability \textit{a priori}. Instead of training models to compress contexts through autoencoding tasks, SAC directly selects so-called anchor tokens from the original context and aggregates contextual information into their key-value (KV) representations. By deriving representations directly from the contextual tokens, SAC eliminates the need for autoencoding training. To ensure compression performance while directly leveraging anchor tokens, SAC incorporates two key designs: (1) anchor embeddings that enable the compressor to identify critical tokens, and (2) bidirectional attention modification that allows anchor tokens to capture information from the entire context. Experimental results demonstrate that SAC consistently outperforms existing context compression methods across various compression ratios. On out-of-distribution evaluation using MRQA, SAC achieves 1 EM improvement at 5x compression over strong baselines, with increasing advantages at higher compression ratios.

### QSVD: Efficient Low-rank Approximation for Unified Query-Key-Value   Weight Compression in Low-Precision Vision-Language Models
**Authors**: Yutong Wang, Haiyu Wang, Sai Qian Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-10-18T01:31:14Z

**Summary**: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are integral to tasks such as image captioning and visual question answering, but their high computational cost, driven by large memory footprints and processing time, limits their scalability and real-time applicability. In this work, we propose leveraging Singular-Value Decomposition (SVD) over the joint query (Q), key (K), and value (V) weight matrices to reduce KV cache size and computational overhead. We in addition introduce an efficient rank allocation strategy that dynamically adjusts the SVD rank based on its impact on VLM accuracy, achieving a significant reduction in both memory usage and computational cost. Finally, we extend this approach by applying quantization to both VLM weights and activations, resulting in a highly efficient VLM. Our method outperforms previous approaches that rely solely on quantization or SVD by achieving more than $10\%$ accuracy improvement while consuming less hardware cost, making it better for real-time deployment on resource-constrained devices. We open source our code at \href{https://github.com/SAI-Lab-NYU/QSVD}{\texttt{https://github.com/SAI-Lab-NYU/QSVD}}.

### What Limits Agentic Systems Efficiency?
**Authors**: Song Bian, Minghao Yan, Anand Jayarajan, Gennady Pekhimenko, Shivaram Venkataraman

**Updated**: 2025-10-18T00:21:45Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs), such as OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1, have demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities. To further enhance LLM capabilities, recent agentic systems, such as Deep Research, incorporate web interactions into LLM reasoning to mitigate uncertainties and reduce potential errors. However, existing research predominantly focuses on reasoning performance, often neglecting the efficiency of agentic systems. In this work, we present a comprehensive empirical study that identifies efficiency bottlenecks in web-interactive agentic systems. We decompose end-to-end latency into two primary components: LLM API latency and web environment latency. We conduct a comprehensive empirical study across 15 models and 5 providers to demonstrate high variability in API-based agentic systems. We observe that web environment latency can contribute as much as 53.7% to the overall latency in a web-based agentic system. To improve latency, we propose SpecCache, a caching framework augmented with speculative execution that can reduce web environment overhead. Extensive evaluations on two standard benchmarks show that our approach improves the cache hit rate by up to 58x compared to a random caching strategy, while reducing web environment overhead by up to 3.2x, without degrading agentic system performance.

**Summary**: Electron spin resonance spectroscopy is a widely used technique for analyzing the microscopic structure, local environment and reorientation of atomic and molecular systems. Conventional inductive detection methods typically require to probe more than a billion of electron spins such that single atom motion is hidden through ensemble averaging. While several single spin spectroscopy methods are currently available, they have been so far limited to static systems. Here we demonstrate single spin spectroscopy of a fluorescent tumbling defect in silicon called the G center, behaving as a pseudo-molecule randomly reorienting itself in the crystalline matrix. Using high-resolution spin spectroscopy, we reveal a fine magnetic structure resulting from the spin principal axes jumping between discrete orientations in the crystal. By modeling the atomic reorientation of the defect, we demonstrate that spin tumbling induces variations in the coupling to the microwave magnetic field, enabling position-dependent Rabi frequencies to be detected in coherent spin control experiments. By virtue of its pseudo-molecule configuration, the G center in silicon is a unique quantum system to investigate the mutual interaction between optical, spin and rotation properties in a highly versatile material.

### FHE-SQL: Fully Homomorphic Encrypted SQL Database
**Authors**: Po-Yu Tseng, Po-Chu Hsu, Shih-Wei Liao

**Updated**: 2025-10-17T08:07:27Z

**Summary**: FHE-SQL is a privacy-preserving database system that enables secure query processing on encrypted data using Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), providing privacy guaranties where an untrusted server can execute encrypted queries without learning either the query contents or the underlying data. Unlike property-preserving encryption-based systems such as CryptDB, which rely on deterministic or order-preserving encryption and are vulnerable to frequency, order, and equality-pattern inference attacks, FHE-SQL performs computations entirely under encryption, eliminating these leakage channels. Compared to trusted-hardware approaches such as TrustedDB, which depend on a hardware security module and thus inherit its trust and side-channel limitations, our design achieves end-to-end cryptographic protection without requiring trusted execution environments. In contrast to high-performance FHE-based engines-Hermes, which target specialized workloads such as vector search, FHE-SQL supports general SQL query semantics with schema-aware, type-safe definitions suitable for relational data management. FHE-SQL mitigates the high cost of ciphertext space by using an indirection architecture that separates metadata in RocksDB from large ciphertexts in blob storage. It supports oblivious selection via homomorphic boolean masks, multi-tier caching, and garbage collection, with security proven under the Universal Composability framework.

### PrefixKV: Adaptive Prefix KV Cache is What Vision Instruction-Following   Models Need for Efficient Generation
**Authors**: Ao Wang, Hui Chen, Jiaxin Li, Jianchao Tan, Kefeng Zhang, Xunliang Cai, Zijia Lin, Jungong Han, Guiguang Ding

**Updated**: 2025-10-17T06:54:10Z

**Summary**: Recently, large vision-language models (LVLMs) have rapidly gained popularity for their strong generation and reasoning capabilities given diverse multimodal inputs. However, these models incur significant computational and memory overhead during inference, which greatly hinders the efficient deployment in practical scenarios. The extensive key-value (KV) cache, necessitated by the lengthy input and output sequences, notably contributes to the high inference cost. Based on this, recent works have investigated ways to reduce the KV cache size for higher efficiency. Although effective, they generally overlook the distinct importance distributions of KV vectors across layers and maintain the same cache size for each layer during the next token prediction. This results in the significant contextual information loss for certain layers, leading to notable performance decline. To address this, we present PrefixKV, where "Prefix" means the top-ranked KV based on importance rather than position in the original sequence. It reframes the challenge of determining KV cache sizes for all layers into the task of searching for the optimal global prefix configuration. With an adaptive layer-wise KV retention recipe based on binary search, the maximum contextual information can thus be preserved in each layer, facilitating the generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance compared with others. It exhibits superior inference efficiency and generation quality trade-offs, showing promising potential for practical applications. Code is available at https://github.com/THU-MIG/PrefixKV.

**Summary**: To enhance the efficiency of the attention mechanism within large language models (LLMs), previous works primarily compress the KV cache or group attention heads, while largely overlooking redundancy between layers. Our comprehensive analyses across various LLMs show that highly similar attention patterns persist within most layers. It's intuitive to reduce the redundancy by sharing attention weights across layers. However, further analysis reveals two challenges: (1) Directly sharing the weight matrix without carefully rearranging the attention heads proves to be ineffective; (2) Shallow layers are vulnerable to small deviations in attention weights.   Driven by these insights, we introduce LISA, a lightweight substitute for self-attention in well-trained LLMs. LISA employs tiny feed-forward networks to align attention heads between adjacent layers and low-rank matrices to approximate differences in layer-wise attention weights. Evaluations encompassing 13 typical benchmarks demonstrate that LISA maintains high response quality in terms of accuracy and perplexity while reducing redundant attention calculations within 53%-84% of the total layers. Our implementations of LISA achieve a 6x compression of Q and K matrices within the attention mechanism, with maximum throughput improvements 19.5%, 32.3%, and 40.1% for LLaMA3-8B, LLaMA2-7B, and LLaMA2-13B, respectively.

### Tail-Optimized Caching for LLM Inference
**Authors**: Wenxin Zhang, Yueying Li, Ciamac C. Moallemi, Tianyi Peng

**Updated**: 2025-10-16T21:22:16Z

**Summary**: Prompt caching is critical for reducing latency and cost in LLM inference: OpenAI and Anthropic report up to 50-90% cost savings through prompt reuse. Despite its widespread success, little is known about what constitutes an optimal prompt caching policy, particularly when optimizing tail latency, a metric of central importance to practitioners. The widely used Least Recently Used (LRU) policy can perform arbitrarily poor on this metric, as it is oblivious to the heterogeneity of conversation lengths. To address this gap, we propose Tail-Optimized LRU, a simple two-line modification that reallocates KV cache capacity to prioritize high-latency conversations by evicting cache entries that are unlikely to affect future turns. Though the implementation is simple, we prove its optimality under a natural stochastic model of conversation dynamics, providing the first theoretical justification for LRU in this setting, a result that may be of independent interest to the caching community. Experimentally, on real conversation data WildChat, Tail-Optimized LRU achieves up to 27.5% reduction in P90 tail Time to First Token latency and 23.9% in P95 tail latency compared to LRU, along with up to 38.9% decrease in SLO violations of 200ms. We believe this provides a practical and theoretically grounded option for practitioners seeking to optimize tail latency in real-world LLM deployments.

### Hive Hash Table: A Warp-Cooperative, Dynamically Resizable Hash Table   for GPUs
**Authors**: Md Sabbir Hossain Polak, David Troendle, Byunghyun Jang

**Updated**: 2025-10-16T19:28:30Z

**Summary**: Hash tables are essential building blocks in data-intensive applications, yet existing GPU implementations often struggle with concurrent updates, high load factors, and irregular memory access patterns. We present Hive hash table, a high-performance, warp-cooperative and dynamically resizable GPU hash table that adapts to varying workloads without global rehashing.   Hive hash table makes three key contributions. First, a cache-aligned packed bucket layout stores key-value pairs as 64-bit words, enabling coalesced memory access and atomic updates via single-CAS operations. Second, warp-synchronous concurrency protocols - Warp-Aggregated-Bitmask-Claim (WABC) and Warp-Cooperative Match-and-Elect (WCME) - reduce contention to one atomic operation per warp while ensuring lock-free progress. Third, a load-factor-aware dynamic resizing strategy expands or contracts capacity in warp-parallel K-bucket batches using linear hashing, maintaining balanced occupancy. To handle insertions under heavy contention, Hive hash table employs a four-step strategy: replace, claim-and-commit, bounded cuckoo eviction, and overflow-stash fallback. This design provides lock-free fast paths and bounded recovery cost under contention determined by a fixed eviction depth, while eliminating ABA hazards during concurrent updates.   Experimental evaluation on an NVIDIA RTX 4090 shows Hive hash table sustains load factors up to 95% while delivering 1.5-2x higher throughput than state-of-the-art GPU hash tables (Slab-Hash, DyCuckoo, WarpCore) under mixed insert-delete-lookup workloads. On balanced workload, Hive hash table reaches 3.5 billion updates/s and nearly 4 billion lookups/s, demonstrating scalability and efficiency for GPU-accelerated data processing.

### Attention Is All You Need for KV Cache in Diffusion LLMs
**Authors**: Quan Nguyen-Tri, Mukul Ranjan, Zhiqiang Shen

**Updated**: 2025-10-16T17:59:48Z

**Summary**: This work studies how to adaptively recompute key-value (KV) caches for diffusion large language models (DLMs) to maximize prediction accuracy while minimizing decoding latency. Prior methods' decoders recompute QKV for all tokens at every denoising step and layer, despite KV states changing little across most steps, especially in shallow layers, leading to substantial redundancy. We make three observations: (1) distant ${\bf MASK}$ tokens primarily act as a length-bias and can be cached block-wise beyond the active prediction window; (2) KV dynamics increase with depth, suggesting that selective refresh starting from deeper layers is sufficient; and (3) the most-attended token exhibits the smallest KV drift, providing a conservative lower bound on cache change for other tokens. Building on these, we propose ${\bf Elastic-Cache}$, a training-free, architecture-agnostic strategy that jointly decides ${when}$ to refresh (via an attention-aware drift test on the most-attended token) and ${where}$ to refresh (via a depth-aware schedule that recomputes from a chosen layer onward while reusing shallow-layer caches and off-window MASK caches). Unlike fixed-period schemes, Elastic-Cache performs adaptive, layer-aware cache updates for diffusion LLMs, reducing redundant computation and accelerating decoding with negligible loss in generation quality. Experiments on LLaDA-Instruct, LLaDA-1.5, and LLaDA-V across mathematical reasoning and code generation tasks demonstrate consistent speedups: $8.7\times$ on GSM8K (256 tokens), $45.1\times$ on longer sequences, and $4.8\times$ on HumanEval, while consistently maintaining higher accuracy than the baseline. Our method achieves significantly higher throughput ($6.8\times$ on GSM8K) than existing confidence-based approaches while preserving generation quality, enabling practical deployment of diffusion LLMs.

### A Performance Portable Matrix Free Dense MTTKRP in GenTen
**Authors**: Gabriel Kosmacher, Eric T. Phipps, Sivasankaran Rajamanickam

**Updated**: 2025-10-16T17:10:03Z

**Summary**: We extend the GenTen tensor decomposition package by introducing an accelerated dense matricized tensor times Khatri-Rao product (MTTKRP), the workhorse kernel for canonical polyadic (CP) tensor decompositions, that is portable and performant on modern CPU and GPU architectures. In contrast to the state-of-the-art matrix multiply based MTTKRP kernels used by Tensor Toolbox, TensorLy, etc., that explicitly form Khatri-Rao matrices, we develop a matrix-free element-wise parallelization approach whose memory cost grows with the rank R like the sum of the tensor shape O(R(n+m+k)), compared to matrix-based methods whose memory cost grows like the product of the tensor shape O(R(mnk)). For the largest problem we study, a rank 2000 MTTKRP, the smaller growth rate yields a matrix-free memory cost of just 2% of the matrix-based methods, a 50x improvement. In practice, the reduced memory impact means our matrix-free MTTKRP can compute a rank 2000 tensor decomposition on a single NVIDIA H100 instead of six H100s using a matrix-based MTTKRP. We also compare our optimized matrix-free MTTKRP to baseline matrix-free implementations on different devices, showing a 3x single-device speedup on an Intel 8480+ CPU and an 11x speedup on a H100 GPU. In addition to numerical results, we provide fine grained performance models for an ideal multi-level cache machine, compare analytical performance predictions to empirical results, and provide a motivated heuristic selection for selecting an algorithmic hyperparameter.

**Updated**: 2025-10-16T13:53:47Z

**Summary**: We introduce xLLM, an intelligent and efficient Large Language Model (LLM) inference framework designed for high-performance, large-scale enterprise-grade serving, with deep optimizations for diverse AI accelerators. To address these challenges, xLLM builds a novel decoupled service-engine architecture. At the service layer, xLLM-Service features an intelligent scheduling module that efficiently processes multimodal requests and co-locates online and offline tasks through unified elastic scheduling to maximize cluster utilization. This module also relies on a workload-adaptive dynamic Prefill-Decode (PD) disaggregation policy and a novel Encode-Prefill-Decode (EPD) disaggregation policy designed for multimodal inputs. Furthermore, it incorporates a distributed architecture to provide global KV Cache management and robust fault-tolerant capabilities for high availability. At the engine layer, xLLM-Engine co-optimizes system and algorithm designs to fully saturate computing resources. This is achieved through comprehensive multi-layer execution pipeline optimizations, an adaptive graph mode and an xTensor memory management. xLLM-Engine also further integrates algorithmic enhancements such as optimized speculative decoding and dynamic EPLB, collectively serving to substantially boost throughput and inference efficiency. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that xLLM delivers significantly superior performance and resource efficiency. Under identical TPOT constraints, xLLM achieves throughput up to 1.7x that of MindIE and 2.2x that of vLLM-Ascend with Qwen-series models, while maintaining an average throughput of 1.7x that of MindIE with Deepseek-series models. xLLM framework is publicly available at https://github.com/jd-opensource/xllm and https://github.com/jd-opensource/xllm-service.

### Ada-KV: Optimizing KV Cache Eviction by Adaptive Budget Allocation for   Efficient LLM Inference
**Authors**: Yuan Feng, Junlin Lv, Yukun Cao, Xike Xie, S. Kevin Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-10-16T13:25:38Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models have excelled in various domains but face efficiency challenges due to the growing Key-Value (KV) cache required for long-sequence inference. Recent efforts aim to reduce KV cache size by evicting vast non-critical cache elements during runtime while preserving generation quality. However, these methods typically allocate compression budgets uniformly across all attention heads, ignoring the unique attention patterns of each head. In this paper, we establish a theoretical loss upper bound between pre- and post-eviction attention output, explaining the optimization target of prior cache eviction methods, while guiding the optimization of adaptive budget allocation. Base on this, we propose {\it Ada-KV}, the first head-wise adaptive budget allocation strategy. It offers plug-and-play benefits, enabling seamless integration with prior cache eviction methods. Extensive evaluations on 13 datasets from Ruler and 16 datasets from LongBench, all conducted under both question-aware and question-agnostic scenarios, demonstrate substantial quality improvements over existing methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/FFY0/AdaKV.

**Updated**: 2025-10-16T12:32:51Z

**Summary**: MPI implementations commonly rely on explicit memory-copy operations, incurring overhead from redundant data movement and buffer management. This overhead notably impacts HPC workloads involving intensive inter-processor communication. In response, we introduce MPI-over-CXL, a novel MPI communication paradigm leveraging CXL, which provides cache-coherent shared memory across multiple hosts. MPI-over-CXL replaces traditional data-copy methods with direct shared memory access, significantly reducing communication latency and memory bandwidth usage. By mapping shared memory regions directly into the virtual address spaces of MPI processes, our design enables efficient pointer-based communication, eliminating redundant copying operations. To validate this approach, we implement a comprehensive hardware and software environment, including a custom CXL 3.2 controller, FPGA-based multi-host emulation, and dedicated software stack. Our evaluations using representative benchmarks demonstrate substantial performance improvements over conventional MPI systems, underscoring MPI-over-CXL's potential to enhance efficiency and scalability in large-scale HPC environments.

**Authors**: Sebastian Onder, Philipp Gaggl, Jürgen Burin, Andreas Gsponer, Matthias Knopf, Simon Waid, Neil Moffat, Giulio Pellegrini, Thomas Bergauer

**Updated**: 2025-10-16T10:21:35Z

**Summary**: We present the design and simulation of a 30 $\mathrm{\mu m}$ thick 4H-SiC Low Gain Avalanche Diode (LGAD) optimized for high-voltage operation. A 2.4 $\mathrm{\mu m}$ thick epitaxially grown gain layer enables controlled internal amplification up to 1 kV reverse bias, while maintaining full depletion below 500 V. Electrical characteristics, including I-V, C-V, and gain behavior, were simulated in Synopsys Sentaurus Technology Computer-Aided Design (TCAD) using a quasi-1D geometry and verified across process-related variations in gain layer parameters. To ensure high-voltage stability and proper edge termination, a guard structure combining deep etched trenches and deep $p^+$ junction termination extension (JTE) implants was designed. TCAD simulations varying the guard structure dimensions yielded an optimized design with a breakdown voltage above 2.4 kV. A corresponding wafer run is currently processed at IMB-CNM, Barcelona.

### Kelle: Co-design KV Caching and eDRAM for Efficient LLM Serving in Edge   Computing
**Authors**: Tianhua Xia, Sai Qian Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-10-16T07:12:08Z

**Summary**: Running Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge devices is crucial for reducing latency, improving real-time processing, and enhancing privacy. By performing inference directly on the device, data does not need to be sent to the cloud, ensuring faster responses and reducing reliance on network connectivity. However, implementing LLMs on edge devices presents challenges, particularly with managing key-value (KV) caches, which plays a pivotal role in LLM serving. As the input text lengthens, the size of the KV cache increases linearly with the sequence length, leading to a significant memory footprint and data access costs. On the other hand, edge devices have limited memory and computational power, making it hard to store and efficiently access the large caches needed for LLM inference.   To mitigate the substantial overhead caused by KV cache, we propose using embedded DRAM (eDRAM) as the primary storage for LLM serving in edge device, which offers higher storage density compared to SRAM. However, to ensure data integrity, eDRAM needs periodic refresh operations, which are power-intensive. To reduce eDRAM costs and improve overall system performance, we propose~\textit{Kelle}, a software-hardware co-design solution optimized for deploying LLMs on eDRAM-based edge systems. Combined with our fine-grained memory eviction, recomputation, and refresh control algorithms, the \textit{Kelle} accelerator delivers a $3.9\times$ speedup and $4.5\times$ energy savings compared to existing baseline solutions.

### Cortex: Workflow-Aware Resource Pooling and Scheduling for Agentic   Serving
**Authors**: Nikos Pagonas, Yeounoh Chung, Kostis Kaffes, Arvind Krishnamurthy

**Updated**: 2025-10-15T21:49:38Z

**Summary**: We introduce Cortex, a prototype workflow-aware serving platform designed for agentic workloads. The core principle of Cortex is stage isolation: it provisions dedicated resource pools for each distinct stage of an agentic workflow. This simple yet powerful strategy mitigates inter-stage interference in compute and memory, leading to better KV cache utilization, higher throughput, and more predictable performance. By customizing resource allocation and scheduling within each distinct stage of agentic workflows, Cortex lays the groundwork for more advanced, agent-native serving paradigms, including malleable resource management, speculative execution of workflow branches, and a shared, multi-tiered cache for "agentic state."

### Less is More: Improving LLM Reasoning with Minimal Test-Time   Intervention
**Authors**: Zhen Yang, Mingyang Zhang, Feng Chen, Ganggui Ding, Liang Hou, Xin Tao, Pengfei Wan, Ying-Cong Chen

**Updated**: 2025-10-15T17:59:45Z

**Summary**: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has focused on test-time scaling to improve reasoning via increased inference computation, but often at the cost of efficiency. We revisit test-time behavior and uncover a simple yet underexplored phenomenon: reasoning uncertainty is highly localized-only a small subset of high-entropy tokens dominantly affects output correctness. Motivated by this, we propose Minimal Test-Time Intervention (MTI), a training-free framework that enhances reasoning accuracy and stability with minimal overhead. MTI includes: (i) Selective CFG intervention, applying classifier-free guidance only at uncertain positions; and (ii) Lightweight negative-prompt guidance, reusing the main model's KV cache to approximate unconditional decoding efficiently. MTI yields consistent gains across general, coding, and STEM tasks-e.g., +1.35% average improvement on eight benchmarks for Qwen3-8B-Base and +5% on AIME2024 using Qwen3-32B-Reasoning-while remaining highly efficient.

### Breadcrumbs Reasoning: Memory-Efficient Reasoning with Compression   Beacons
**Authors**: Giovanni Monea, Yair Feldman, Shankar Padmanabhan, Kianté Brantley, Yoav Artzi

**Updated**: 2025-10-15T17:57:21Z

**Summary**: The scalability of large language models for long-context reasoning is severely constrained by the linear growth of their Transformer key-value cache, which incurs significant memory and computational costs. We posit that as a model generates reasoning tokens, the informational value of past generated tokens diminishes, creating an opportunity for compression. In this work, we propose to periodically compress the generation KV cache with a learned, special-purpose token and evict compressed entries. We train the model to perform this compression via a modified joint distillation and reinforcement learning (RL) framework. Our training method minimizes overhead over the conventional RL process, as it leverages RL outputs for distillation. Empirically, our method achieves a superior memory-accuracy Pareto frontier compared to both the model without cache compression and training-free compression techniques.

### Quantize What Counts: More for Keys, Less for Values
**Authors**: Mohsen Hariri, Alan Luo, Weicong Chen, Shaochen Zhong, Tianyi Zhang, Qifan Wang, Xia Hu, Xiaotian Han, Vipin Chaudhary

**Updated**: 2025-10-15T16:03:13Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer inference-time memory bottlenecks dominated by the attention Key-Value (KV) cache, which scales with model size and context length. While KV-cache quantization alleviates this cost, bit allocation between keys and values is often tuned heuristically, lacking theoretical grounding and generalizability. This paper proposes two theorems that anchor mixed-precision KV quantization in the intrinsic geometry of Transformer models. First, key projections systematically have larger spectral and Frobenius norms than value matrices, implying higher information density along the key path. Second, for any given memory budget, prioritizing precision for keys over values strictly reduces quantization error and better preserves accuracy. Empirical evaluations across various prominent LLMs and benchmarks show that key-favored allocations (e.g., 4-bit keys, 2-bit values) retain up to 98.3\% accuracy compared to uniform allocations (e.g., 4-bit for both), while conserving memory. These results transform bit allocation from ad hoc tuning into a theoretically grounded, geometry-driven design principle for efficient LLM inference.

### NOSA: Native and Offloadable Sparse Attention
**Authors**: Yuxiang Huang, Chaojun Xiao, Xu Han, Zhiyuan Liu

**Updated**: 2025-10-15T14:33:16Z

**Summary**: Trainable sparse attention has emerged as a promising solution to address the decoding efficiency bottleneck of LLMs in long-context processing, significantly saving memory accesses while minimally impacting task performance. However, existing sparse attention methods leave a crucial limitation unresolved: the size of the key-value (KV) cache remains unreduced, which constrains on-GPU batch sizes and throttles decoding throughput, especially in large-scale batched inference. In this paper, we show that trainable sparse attention naturally exhibits strong locality in token selection across adjacent decoding steps, thereby enabling KV cache offloading without altering the underlying attention computation. However, the inherent locality remains insufficient to achieve efficient offloading, as the transfer of selected KV pairs between the CPU and GPU continues to dominate the overall decoding cost. Building on this insight, we present NOSA, a trainable sparse attention framework designed to natively support KV cache offloading. NOSA introduces explicit locality constraints by decomposing token selection into query-aware and query-agnostic components, thereby reducing KV transfers while preserving the same attention computation as used during training. We pretrain a 1B-parameter model with NOSA and conduct extensive benchmarks, showing that it preserves near-lossless performance while achieving up to a 2.3x improvement in decoding throughput compared with the vanilla trainable sparse attention baseline (InfLLM-V2).

### F-BFQ: Flexible Block Floating-Point Quantization Accelerator for LLMs
**Authors**: Jude Haris, José Cano

**Updated**: 2025-10-15T10:56:37Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly prominent for daily tasks, from improving sound-totext translation to generating additional frames for the latest video games. With the help of LLM inference frameworks, such as llama.cpp, which support optimizations such as KV-caching and quantization, it is now easier than ever to deploy LLMs on edge devices. Quantization is fundamental to enable LLMs on resource-constrained edge devices, and llama.cpp utilizes block floating point (BFP) quantization to drastically reduce the bit width of weights and input tensors, the memory footprint, and the computational power required to run LLMs. LLMs are typically quantized with mixed BFP quantization across the model layers to reduce the loss of model accuracy due to quantization. Therefore, to efficiently accelerate across the layers of BFP-quantized LLMs, specialized accelerators need to support different BFP variants without reconfiguration. To address this issue, we propose a Flexible Block FloatingPoint Quantization (F-BFQ) accelerator, which can dynamically switch between two BFP quantization variants and perform matrix multiplication (MatMul) operations. Our initial F-BFQ accelerator design, deployed on the AMD Kria board, reduces inference time by 1.4x on average over the Arm NEON-based CPU execution across three BFP quantized LLMs while achieving 5.2 tokens per second (~3.9 words per second).

### Taming the Fragility of KV Cache Eviction in LLM Inference
**Authors**: Yuan Feng, Haoyu Guo, JunLin Lv, S. Kevin Zhou, Xike Xie

**Updated**: 2025-10-15T09:18:58Z

**Summary**: Large language models have revolutionized natural language processing, yet their deployment remains hampered by the substantial memory and runtime overhead of the transformer's Key-Value cache. To mitigate this, recent methods employ a scoring-aggregation framework to evict unimportant cache entries, based on the stability assumption-that a fixed subset of entries remains consistently important during generation. However, prior work has largely focused on refining importance indicators for scoring, while defaulting to mean aggregation due to a faithful trust in the stability assumption. In this work, we argue that this underlying assumption is inherently fragile, making mean aggregation highly vulnerable in extreme cases. To counter this, we propose a simple yet elegant defensive aggregation strategy: a two-step, linear-time approach that controls worst-case risk, thereby defending against extreme cases with negligible computational overhead. Embodying this strategy, we propose a novel cache eviction method, DefensiveKV and its extension, Layer-DefensiveKV, which incorporates layer-wise budget allocation. Across seven task domains (18 datasets), our methods reduce generation quality loss by 2.3x and 4.3x respectively, versus the strongest baseline under a 20% cache size. These results set new performance benchmarks and pioneer a promising direction for optimizing cache eviction against underlying fragility through worst-case risk management. Our code is available at https://github.com/FFY0/DefensiveKV.

### Partitioned Scheduling for DAG Tasks Considering Probabilistic Execution   Time
**Authors**: Fuma Omori, Atsushi Yano, Takuya Azumi

**Updated**: 2025-10-15T08:25:13Z

**Summary**: Autonomous driving systems, critical for safety, require real-time guarantees and can be modeled as DAGs. Their acceleration features, such as caches and pipelining, often result in execution times below the worst-case. Thus, a probabilistic approach ensuring constraint satisfaction within a probability threshold is more suitable than worst-case guarantees for these systems. This paper considers probabilistic guarantees for DAG tasks by utilizing the results of probabilistic guarantees for single processors, which have been relatively more advanced than those for multi-core processors. This paper proposes a task set partitioning method that guarantees schedulability under the partitioned scheduling. The evaluation on randomly generated DAG task sets demonstrates that the proposed method schedules more task sets with a smaller mean analysis time compared to existing probabilistic schedulability analysis for DAGs. The evaluation also compares four bin-packing heuristics, revealing Item-Centric Worst-Fit-Decreasing schedules the most task sets.

### BanaServe: Unified KV Cache and Dynamic Module Migration for Balancing   Disaggregated LLM Serving in AI Infrastructure
**Authors**: Yiyuan He, Minxian Xu, Jingfeng Wu, Jianmin Hu, Chong Ma, Min Shen, Le Chen, Chengzhong Xu, Lin Qu, Kejiang Ye

**Updated**: 2025-10-15T07:20:14Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in AI infrastructure, driving the need for high throughput, resource efficient serving systems. Disaggregated LLM serving, which separates prompt prefill from auto-regressive decode, has emerged as a promising architecture by isolating their heterogeneous compute and memory demands. However, current disaggregated systems face three key limitations: (i) static resource allocation cannot adapt to highly dynamic workloads, causing over-provisioning that wastes resources or under-provisioning that violates service level objectives (SLOs); (ii) inherent load imbalance between prefill and decode stages, where prefill is compute-bound and decode is memory-bound, causes under-utilization in one tier while the other becomes a bottleneck; and (iii) prefix cache aware routing skews load distribution, as high cache hit rate prefill nodes attract disproportionately more requests, further degrading balance and efficiency. To address these issues, we present BanaServe, a dynamic orchestration framework that continuously rebalances computational and memory resources across prefill and decode instances while eliminating hotspots induced by cache. BanaServe introduces layer level weight migration, attention level Key Value Cache (KV Cache) migration, and Global KV Cache Store sharing with layer wise overlapped transmission, enabling both coarse grained (layer level) and fine grained (attention level) load redistribution with minimal latency overhead. These mechanisms allow routers to perform purely load aware scheduling, unconstrained by cache placement. Compared to vLLM, BanaServe achieves 1.2x-3.9x higher throughput with 3.9%-78.4% lower total processing time, and outperforms DistServe by 1.1x-2.8x in throughput with 1.4%-70.1% latency reduction.

**Updated**: 2025-10-15T01:55:32Z

**Summary**: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have recently demonstrated significant progress in video editing.   However, existing video editing methods are severely limited by their high computational overhead and memory consumption.   Furthermore, these approaches often sacrifice visual fidelity, leading to undesirable temporal inconsistencies and artifacts such as blurring and pronounced mosaic-like patterns.   We propose Edit-Your-Interest, a lightweight, text-driven, zero-shot video editing method.   Edit-Your-Interest introduces a spatio-temporal feature memory to cache features from previous frames, significantly reducing computational overhead compared to full-sequence spatio-temporal modeling approaches.   Specifically, we first introduce a Spatio-Temporal Feature Memory bank (SFM), which is designed to efficiently cache and retain the crucial image tokens processed by spatial attention.   Second, we propose the Feature Most-Similar Propagation (FMP) method. FMP propagates the most relevant tokens from previous frames to subsequent ones, preserving temporal consistency.   Finally, we introduce an SFM update algorithm that continuously refreshes the cached features, ensuring their long-term relevance and effectiveness throughout the video sequence.   Furthermore, we leverage cross-attention maps to automatically extract masks for the instances of interest.   These masks are seamlessly integrated into the diffusion denoising process, enabling fine-grained control over target objects and allowing Edit-Your-Interest to perform highly accurate edits while robustly preserving the background integrity.   Extensive experiments decisively demonstrate that the proposed Edit-Your-Interest outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both efficiency and visual fidelity, validating its superior effectiveness and practicality.

### LazyEviction: Lagged KV Eviction with Attention Pattern Observation for   Efficient Long Reasoning
**Authors**: Haoyue Zhang, Hualei Zhang, Xiaosong Ma, Jie Zhang, Song Guo

**Updated**: 2025-10-15T01:55:31Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit enhanced capabilities by Chain-of-Thought reasoning. However, the extended reasoning sequences introduce significant GPU memory overhead due to increased key-value (KV) cache. Existing KV cache compression methods mitigate memory bottlenecks but struggle in long reasoning tasks. In this paper, we analyze attention patterns in reasoning tasks and reveal a Token Importance Recurrence phenomenon: a large proportion of tokens regain high attention after multiple decoding steps, which is failed to capture by existing works and may lead to unpredictable eviction on such periodically critical tokens. To address this, we propose LazyEviction, an observation window-based lagged eviction framework retaining latent recurring tokens by prioritized eviction based on tokens' recurrence patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LazyEviction reduces KV cache by 50%~70% while maintaining comparable accuracy, outperforming existing KV cache compression baselines. Our implementation code can be found at https://github.com/Halo-949/LazyEviction.

### Dodoor: Efficient Randomized Decentralized Scheduling with Load Caching   for Heterogeneous Tasks and Clusters
**Authors**: Wei Da, Evangelia Kalyvianaki

**Updated**: 2025-10-14T18:04:00Z

**Summary**: This paper introduces Dodoor, an efficient randomized decentralized scheduler designed for task scheduling in modern data centers. Dodoor leverages advanced research on the weighted balls-into-bins model with b-batched setting. Unlike other decentralized schedulers that rely on real-time probing of remote servers, Dodoor makes scheduling decisions based on cached server information, which is updated in batches, to reduce communication overheads. To schedule tasks with dynamic, multidimensional resource requirements in heterogeneous cluster, Dodoor uses a novel load score to measure servers' loads for each scheduled task. This score captures the anti-affinity between servers and tasks in contrast to the commonly used heuristic of counting pending tasks to balance load. On a 101-node heterogeneous cluster, Dodoor is evaluated using two workloads: (i) simulated Azure virtual machines placements and (ii) real serverless Python functions executions in Docker. The evaluation shows that Dodoor reduces scheduling messages by 55--66% on both workloads. Dodoor can also increase throughput by up to 33.2% and 21.5%, reduce mean makespan latency by 12.1% and 7.2%, and improve tail latency by 21.9% and 24.6% across the two workloads.

### KVCOMM: Online Cross-context KV-cache Communication for Efficient   LLM-based Multi-agent Systems
**Authors**: Hancheng Ye, Zhengqi Gao, Mingyuan Ma, Qinsi Wang, Yuzhe Fu, Ming-Yu Chung, Yueqian Lin, Zhijian Liu, Jianyi Zhang, Danyang Zhuo, Yiran Chen

**Updated**: 2025-10-14T18:00:01Z

**Summary**: Multi-agent large language model (LLM) systems are increasingly adopted for complex language processing tasks that require communication and coordination among agents. However, these systems often suffer substantial overhead from repeated reprocessing of overlapping contexts across agents. In typical pipelines, once an agent receives a message from its predecessor, the full context-including prior turns-must be reprocessed from scratch, leading to inefficient processing. While key-value (KV) caching is an effective solution for avoiding redundant computation in single-agent settings where prefixes remain unchanged, it cannot be directly reused in multi-agent scenarios due to diverging prefixes introduced by agent-specific context extensions. We identify that the core challenge lies in the offset variance of KV-caches across agents. To address this, we propose KVCOMM, a training-free framework that enables efficient prefilling in multi-agent inference by reusing KV-caches and aligning cache offsets of overlapping contexts under diverse prefix contexts. KVCOMM estimates and adjusts KV-caches for shared content by referencing a pool of cached examples-termed anchors-that store observed cache deviations under varying prefixes. The anchor pool is maintained and updated online, allowing dynamic adaptation to distinct user requests and context structures. KVCOMM achieves over 70% reuse rate across diverse multi-agent workloads, including retrieval-augmented generation, math reasoning, and collaborative coding tasks, all without quality degradation. Particularly, when each fully-connected agent receives 1K input tokens with 512 prefix tokens and 512 output tokens under a five-agent setting, KVCOMM achieves up to 7.8x speedup compared to the standard prefill pipeline, reducing TTFT from ~430 ms to ~55 ms.

 ### Variational Masked Diffusion Models
**Authors**: Yichi Zhang, Alex Schwing, Zhizhen Zhao

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T17:59:57Z

**Summary**: Masked diffusion models have recently emerged as a flexible framework for discrete generative modeling. However, a key limitation of standard masked diffusion is its inability to effectively capture dependencies among tokens that are predicted concurrently, leading to degraded generation quality when dependencies among tokens are important. To explicitly model dependencies among tokens, we propose Variational Masked Diffusion (VMD), a framework that introduces latent variables into the masked diffusion process. Through controlled experiments on synthetic datasets, we demonstrate that VMD successfully learns dependencies that conventional masked diffusion fails to capture. We further validate the effectiveness of our approach on Sudoku puzzles and text datasets, where learning of dependencies among tokens improves global consistency. Across these domains, VMD enhances both generation quality and dependency awareness, highlighting the value of integrating variational inference into masked diffusion. Our code is available at: https://riccizz.github.io/VMD.

### PixelRefer: A Unified Framework for Spatio-Temporal Object Referring   with Arbitrary Granularity
**Authors**: Yuqian Yuan, Wenqiao Zhang, Xin Li, Shihao Wang, Kehan Li, Wentong Li, Jun Xiao, Lei Zhang, Beng Chin Ooi

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T17:59:32Z

**Summary**: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong general-purpose capabilities in open-world visual comprehension. However, most existing MLLMs primarily focus on holistic, scene-level understanding, often overlooking the need for fine-grained, object-centric reasoning. In this paper, we present PixelRefer, a unified region-level MLLM framework that enables advanced fine-grained understanding over user-specified regions across both images and videos. Motivated by the observation that LLM attention predominantly focuses on object-level tokens, we propose a Scale-Adaptive Object Tokenizer (SAOT) to generate compact and semantically rich object representations from free-form regions. Our analysis reveals that global visual tokens contribute mainly in early LLM layers, inspiring the design of PixelRefer-Lite, an efficient variant that employs an Object-Centric Infusion module to pre-fuse global context into object tokens. This yields a lightweight Object-Only Framework that substantially reduces computational cost while maintaining high semantic fidelity. To facilitate fine-grained instruction tuning, we curate PixelRefer-2.2M, a high-quality object-centric instruction dataset. Extensive experiments across a range of benchmarks validate that PixelRefer achieves leading performance with fewer training samples, while PixelRefer-Lite offers competitive accuracy with notable gains in efficiency.

### Alita-G: Self-Evolving Generative Agent for Agent Generation
**Authors**: Jiahao Qiu, Xuan Qi, Hongru Wang, Xinzhe Juan, Yimin Wang, Zelin Zhao, Jiayi Geng, Jiacheng Guo, Peihang Li, Jingzhe Shi, Shilong Liu, Mengdi Wang

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T17:59:14Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to perform better when scaffolded into agents with memory, tools, and feedback. Beyond this, self-evolving agents have emerged, but current work largely limits adaptation to prompt rewriting or failure retries. Therefore, we present ALITA-G, a self-evolution framework that transforms a general-purpose agent into a domain expert by systematically generating, abstracting, and curating Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools. In this framework, a generalist agent executes a curated suite of target-domain tasks and synthesizes candidate MCPs from successful trajectories. These are then abstracted to parameterized primitives and consolidated into an MCP Box. At inference time, ALITA-G performs retrieval-augmented MCP selection with the help of each tool's descriptions and use cases, before executing an agent equipped with the MCP Executor. Across several benchmarks GAIA, PathVQA, and Humanity's Last Exam, ALITA-G attains strong gains while reducing computation costs. On GAIA validation, it achieves 83.03% pass@1 and 89.09% pass@3, establishing a new state-of-the-art result while reducing mean tokens per example by approximately 15% relative to a strong baseline agent. ALITA-G thus provides a principled pathway from generalist capability to reusable, domain-specific competence, improving both accuracy and efficiency on complex reasoning tasks.

### Constrained Entropic Unlearning: A Primal-Dual Framework for Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Taha Entesari, Arman Hatami, Rinat Khaziev, Anil Ramakrishna, Mahyar Fazlyab

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T17:59:13Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) deployed in real-world settings increasingly face the need to unlearn sensitive, outdated, or proprietary information. Existing unlearning methods typically formulate forgetting and retention as a regularized trade-off, combining both objectives into a single scalarized loss. This often leads to unstable optimization and degraded performance on retained data, especially under aggressive forgetting. We propose a new formulation of LLM unlearning as a constrained optimization problem: forgetting is enforced via a novel logit-margin flattening loss that explicitly drives the output distribution toward uniformity on a designated forget set, while retention is preserved through a hard constraint on a separate retain set. Compared to entropy-based objectives, our loss is softmax-free, numerically stable, and maintains non-vanishing gradients, enabling more efficient and robust optimization. We solve the constrained problem using a scalable primal-dual algorithm that exposes the trade-off between forgetting and retention through the dynamics of the dual variable, all without any extra computational overhead. Evaluations on the TOFU and MUSE benchmarks across diverse LLM architectures demonstrate that our approach consistently matches or exceeds state-of-the-art baselines, effectively removing targeted information while preserving downstream utility.

### Think Twice: Branch-and-Rethink Reasoning Reward Model
**Authors**: Yizhu Jiao, Jiaqi Zeng, Julien Veron Vialard, Oleksii Kuchaiev, Jiawei Han, Olivier Delalleau

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T17:58:07Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on thinking models that externalize intermediate steps and allocate extra test-time compute, with think-twice strategies showing that a deliberate second pass can elicit stronger reasoning. In contrast, most reward models (RMs) still compress many quality dimensions into a single scalar in one shot, a design that induces judgment diffusion: attention spreads across evaluation criteria, yielding diluted focus and shallow analysis. We introduce branch-and-rethink (BR-RM), a two-turn RM that transfers the think-twice principle to reward modeling. Turn 1 performs adaptive branching, selecting a small set of instance-critical dimensions (such as factuality and safety) and sketching concise, evidence-seeking hypotheses. Turn 2 executes branch-conditioned rethinking, a targeted reread that tests those hypotheses and scrutinizes only what matters most. We train with GRPO-style reinforcement learning over structured two-turn traces using a simple binary outcome reward with strict format checks, making the approach compatible with standard RLHF pipelines. By converting all-at-oncescoringintofocused, second-lookreasoning, BR-RMreducesjudgmentdiffusionandimproves sensitivity to subtle yet consequential errors while remaining practical and scalable. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on three challenging reward modeling benchmarks across diverse domains. The code and the model will be released soon.

### Multi-Agent Evolve: LLM Self-Improve through Co-evolution
**Authors**: Yixing Chen, Yiding Wang, Siqi Zhu, Haofei Yu, Tao Feng, Muhan Zhang, Mostofa Patwary, Jiaxuan You

**Updated**: 2025-10-28T03:30:44Z

**Summary**: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated significant potential in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, the success of RL for LLMs heavily relies on human-curated datasets and verifiable rewards, which limit their scalability and generality. Recent Self-Play RL methods, inspired by the success of the paradigm in games and Go, aim to enhance LLM reasoning capabilities without human-annotated data. However, their methods primarily depend on a grounded environment for feedback (e.g., a Python interpreter or a game engine); extending them to general domains remains challenging. To address these challenges, we propose Multi-Agent Evolve (MAE), a framework that enables LLMs to self-evolve in solving diverse tasks, including mathematics, reasoning, and general knowledge Q&A. The core design of MAE is based on a triplet of interacting agents (Proposer, Solver, Judge) that are instantiated from a single LLM, and applies reinforcement learning to optimize their behaviors. The Proposer generates questions, the Solver attempts solutions, and the Judge evaluates both while co-evolving. Experiments on Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct demonstrate that MAE achieves an average improvement of 4.54% on multiple benchmarks. These results highlight MAE as a scalable, data-efficient method for enhancing the general reasoning abilities of LLMs with minimal reliance on human-curated supervision.

### Lightweight Robust Direct Preference Optimization
**Authors**: Cheol Woo Kim, Shresth Verma, Mauricio Tec, Milind Tambe

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T17:55:06Z

**Summary**: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has become a popular method for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) due to its stability and simplicity. However, it is also known to be sensitive to noise in the data and prone to overfitting. Recent works have proposed using distributionally robust optimization (DRO) to address potential noise and distributional shift in the data. However, these methods often suffer from excessive conservatism and high computational cost. We propose DPO-PRO (DPO with Preference Robustness), a robust fine-tuning algorithm based on DPO which accounts for uncertainty in the preference distribution through a lightweight DRO formulation. Unlike prior DRO-based variants, DPO-PRO focuses solely on uncertainty in preferences, avoiding unnecessary conservatism and incurring negligible computational overhead. We further show that DPO-PRO is equivalent to a regularized DPO objective that penalizes model overconfidence under weak preference signals. We evaluate DPO-PRO on standard alignment benchmarks and a real-world public health task. Experimental results show that our method consistently improves robustness to noisy preference signals compared to existing DPO variants.

### FARMER: Flow AutoRegressive Transformer over Pixels
**Authors**: Guangting Zheng, Qinyu Zhao, Tao Yang, Fei Xiao, Zhijie Lin, Jie Wu, Jiajun Deng, Yanyong Zhang, Rui Zhu

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T17:54:08Z

**Summary**: Directly modeling the explicit likelihood of the raw data distribution is key topic in the machine learning area, which achieves the scaling successes in Large Language Models by autoregressive modeling. However, continuous AR modeling over visual pixel data suffer from extremely long sequences and high-dimensional spaces. In this paper, we present FARMER, a novel end-to-end generative framework that unifies Normalizing Flows (NF) and Autoregressive (AR) models for tractable likelihood estimation and high-quality image synthesis directly from raw pixels. FARMER employs an invertible autoregressive flow to transform images into latent sequences, whose distribution is modeled implicitly by an autoregressive model. To address the redundancy and complexity in pixel-level modeling, we propose a self-supervised dimension reduction scheme that partitions NF latent channels into informative and redundant groups, enabling more effective and efficient AR modeling. Furthermore, we design a one-step distillation scheme to significantly accelerate inference speed and introduce a resampling-based classifier-free guidance algorithm to boost image generation quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FARMER achieves competitive performance compared to existing pixel-based generative models while providing exact likelihoods and scalable training.

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T17:54:07Z

**Summary**: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has spurred the emergence of data agents--autonomous systems designed to orchestrate Data + AI ecosystems for tackling complex data-related tasks. However, the term "data agent" currently suffers from terminological ambiguity and inconsistent adoption, conflating simple query responders with sophisticated autonomous architectures. This terminological ambiguity fosters mismatched user expectations, accountability challenges, and barriers to industry growth. Inspired by the SAE J3016 standard for driving automation, this survey introduces the first systematic hierarchical taxonomy for data agents, comprising six levels that delineate and trace progressive shifts in autonomy, from manual operations (L0) to a vision of generative, fully autonomous data agents (L5), thereby clarifying capability boundaries and responsibility allocation. Through this lens, we offer a structured review of existing research arranged by increasing autonomy, encompassing specialized data agents for data management, preparation, and analysis, alongside emerging efforts toward versatile, comprehensive systems with enhanced autonomy. We further analyze critical evolutionary leaps and technical gaps for advancing data agents, especially the ongoing L2-to-L3 transition, where data agents evolve from procedural execution to autonomous orchestration. Finally, we conclude with a forward-looking roadmap, envisioning the advent of proactive, generative data agents.

### Hope Speech Detection in Social Media English Corpora: Performance of   Traditional and Transformer Models
**Authors**: Luis Ramos, Hiram Calvo, Olga Kolesnikova

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T17:53:40Z

**Summary**: The identification of hope speech has become a promised NLP task, considering the need to detect motivational expressions of agency and goal-directed behaviour on social media platforms. This proposal evaluates traditional machine learning models and fine-tuned transformers for a previously split hope speech dataset as train, development and test set. On development test, a linear-kernel SVM and logistic regression both reached a macro-F1 of 0.78; SVM with RBF kernel reached 0.77, and Na\"ive Bayes hit 0.75. Transformer models delivered better results, the best model achieved weighted precision of 0.82, weighted recall of 0.80, weighted F1 of 0.79, macro F1 of 0.79, and 0.80 accuracy. These results suggest that while optimally configured traditional machine learning models remain agile, transformer architectures detect some subtle semantics of hope to achieve higher precision and recall in hope speech detection, suggesting that larges transformers and LLMs could perform better in small datasets.

### Cosmic magnification on multi-catalogue Herschel submillimetre galaxies
**Authors**: R. Fernandez-Fernandez, M. M. Cueli, J. González-Nuevo, L. Bonavera, D. Crespo, E. Goitia, J. M. Casas, J. A. Cano, M. Migliaccio

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T17:51:22Z

**Summary**: {Submillimetre galaxies (SMGs) are excellent background sources for magnification-bias studies, but the limited sky coverage in the submillimetre (sub-mm) band constrains their statistical power. Beyond H-ATLAS, Herschel produced additional sub-mm catalogues, though not optimised for spatial statistical lensing analyses.} {Our goal is to refine cosmological constraints from SMG magnification bias by exploiting the full sub-mm sky surveyed by Herschel.} {We expanded the SMG sample by incorporating other Herschel catalogues overlapping SDSS spectroscopic lenses. Random catalogues were generated via kernel density estimation to compute cross-correlations, and Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods were applied to infer astrophysical and cosmological parameters for each catalogue and for the combined dataset.} {We report the first detection of magnification bias in SMGs beyond H-ATLAS, reinforcing the robustness of this observable. Individual Herschel catalogues yield reasonable central values for $\Omega_m$ and $\sigma_8$, although with large uncertainties. The combined analysis, dominated by the more powerful H-ATLAS sample, gives results consistent with $\Lambda$CDM: $\Omega_m = 0.30^{+0.05}_{-0.07}$, $\sigma_8 = 0.80 (+/- 0.07)$, and $h < 0.80$, in better agreement with \textit{Planck} 2018 than previous non-tomographic studies.} {SMGs are promising tracers for magnification bias, but the narrow sub-mm coverage remains a major limitation. Wider surveys optimised for lensing would enable cross-correlations on larger scales, yielding tighter cosmological constraints.}

### ESCA: Contextualizing Embodied Agents via Scene-Graph Generation
**Authors**: Jiani Huang, Amish Sethi, Matthew Kuo, Mayank Keoliya, Neelay Velingker, JungHo Jung, Ser-Nam Lim, Ziyang Li, Mayur Naik

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T17:51:21Z

**Summary**: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) are making rapid progress toward general-purpose embodied agents. However, existing MLLMs do not reliably capture fine-grained links between low-level visual features and high-level textual semantics, leading to weak grounding and inaccurate perception. To overcome this challenge, we propose ESCA, a framework that contextualizes embodied agents by grounding their perception in spatial-temporal scene graphs. At its core is SGCLIP, a novel, open-domain, promptable foundation model for generating scene graphs that is based on CLIP. SGCLIP is trained on 87K+ open-domain videos using a neurosymbolic pipeline that aligns automatically generated captions with scene graphs produced by the model itself, eliminating the need for human-labeled annotations. We demonstrate that SGCLIP excels in both prompt-based inference and task-specific fine-tuning, achieving state-of-the-art results on scene graph generation and action localization benchmarks. ESCA with SGCLIP improves perception for embodied agents based on both open-source and commercial MLLMs, achieving state of-the-art performance across two embodied environments. Notably, ESCA significantly reduces agent perception errors and enables open-source models to surpass proprietary baselines. We release the source code for SGCLIP model training at https://github.com/video-fm/LASER and for the embodied agent at https://github.com/video-fm/ESCA.

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T17:46:32Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) and emerging agentic frameworks are beginning to transform single-cell biology by enabling natural-language reasoning, generative annotation, and multimodal data integration. However, progress remains fragmented across data modalities, architectures, and evaluation standards. LLM4Cell presents the first unified survey of 58 foundation and agentic models developed for single-cell research, spanning RNA, ATAC, multi-omic, and spatial modalities. We categorize these methods into five families-foundation, text-bridge, spatial, multimodal, epigenomic, and agentic-and map them to eight key analytical tasks including annotation, trajectory and perturbation modeling, and drug-response prediction. Drawing on over 40 public datasets, we analyze benchmark suitability, data diversity, and ethical or scalability constraints, and evaluate models across 10 domain dimensions covering biological grounding, multi-omics alignment, fairness, privacy, and explainability. By linking datasets, models, and evaluation domains, LLM4Cell provides the first integrated view of language-driven single-cell intelligence and outlines open challenges in interpretability, standardization, and trustworthy model development.

### SafeMERGE: Preserving Safety Alignment in Fine-Tuned Large Language   Models via Selective Layer-Wise Model Merging
**Authors**: Aladin Djuhera, Swanand Ravindra Kadhe, Farhan Ahmed, Syed Zawad, Holger Boche

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T17:40:05Z

**Summary**: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) is a common practice to adapt generalist models to specialized domains. However, recent studies show that fine-tuning can erode safety alignment, causing LLMs to respond to harmful or unethical prompts. Many methods to realign safety have been proposed, but often introduce custom algorithms that are difficult to implement or compromise task utility. In this work, we propose SafeMERGE, a lightweight, post-fine-tuning framework that preserves safety while maintaining downstream performance. SafeMERGE selectively merges fine-tuned with safety-aligned model layers only when they deviate from safe behavior, measured by a cosine similarity criterion. Across three LLMs and two tasks, SafeMERGE consistently reduces harmful outputs compared to other defenses, with negligible or even positive impact on utility. Our results demonstrate that selective layer-wise merging offers an effective safeguard against the inadvertent loss of safety during fine-tuning, establishing SafeMERGE as a simple post-fine-tuning defense.

### EgoThinker: Unveiling Egocentric Reasoning with Spatio-Temporal CoT
**Authors**: Baoqi Pei, Yifei Huang, Jilan Xu, Yuping He, Guo Chen, Fei Wu, Yu Qiao, Jiangmiao Pang

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T17:38:17Z

**Summary**: Egocentric video reasoning centers on an unobservable agent behind the camera who dynamically shapes the environment, requiring inference of hidden intentions and recognition of fine-grained interactions. This core challenge limits current multimodal large language models MLLMs, which excel at visible event reasoning but lack embodied, first-person understanding. To bridge this gap, we introduce EgoThinker, a novel framework that endows MLLMs with robust egocentric reasoning capabilities through spatio-temporal chain-of-thought supervision and a two-stage learning curriculum. First, we introduce EgoRe-5M, a large-scale egocentric QA dataset constructed from 13M diverse egocentric video clips. This dataset features multi-minute segments annotated with detailed CoT rationales and dense hand-object grounding. Second, we employ SFT on EgoRe-5M to instill reasoning skills, followed by reinforcement fine-tuning RFT to further enhance spatio-temporal localization. Experimental results show that EgoThinker outperforms existing methods across multiple egocentric benchmarks, while achieving substantial improvements in fine-grained spatio-temporal localization tasks. Full code and data are released at https://github.com/InternRobotics/EgoThinker.

**Summary**: Real-world tasks require decisions at varying granularities, and humans excel at this by leveraging a unified cognitive representation where planning is fundamentally understood as a high-level form of action. However, current Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents lack this crucial capability to operate fluidly across decision granularities. This limitation stems from existing paradigms that enforce a rigid separation between high-level planning and low-level action, which impairs dynamic adaptability and limits generalization. We propose ReCode (Recursive Code Generation), a novel paradigm that addresses this limitation by unifying planning and action within a single code representation. In this representation, ReCode treats high-level plans as abstract placeholder functions, which the agent then recursively decomposes into finer-grained sub-functions until reaching primitive actions. This recursive approach dissolves the rigid boundary between plan and action, enabling the agent to dynamically control its decision granularity. Furthermore, the recursive structure inherently generates rich, multi-granularity training data, enabling models to learn hierarchical decision-making processes. Extensive experiments show ReCode significantly surpasses advanced baselines in inference performance and demonstrates exceptional data efficiency in training, validating our core insight that unifying planning and action through recursive code generation is a powerful and effective approach to achieving universal granularity control. The code is available at https://github.com/FoundationAgents/ReCode.

### SafeCOMM: A Study on Safety Degradation in Fine-Tuned Telecom Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Aladin Djuhera, Swanand Ravindra Kadhe, Farhan Ahmed, Syed Zawad, Fernando Koch, Walid Saad, Holger Boche

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T17:35:06Z

**Summary**: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on telecom datasets is a common practice to adapt general-purpose models to the telecom domain. However, little attention has been paid to how this process may compromise model safety. Recent research has shown that even benign fine-tuning can degrade the safety alignment of LLMs, causing them to respond to harmful or unethical user queries. In this paper, we investigate this issue by fine-tuning LLMs on three representative telecom datasets and show that safety degrades even for light telecom domain adaptation. To this end, we introduce TeleHarm, the first telecom-specific red-teaming benchmark, which we use alongside established Direct-Harm and HexPhi datasets to systematically assess harmful behavior. We further extend our analysis to publicly available TeleLLMs that were continually pre-trained on large telecom corpora, revealing that safety alignment is severely lacking, primarily due to the omission of safety-focused instruction tuning. To address these issues, we evaluate three realignment defenses: SafeInstruct, SafeLoRA, SafeMERGE. We show that, across all settings, the proposed defenses can effectively restore safety without compromising telecom task performance, leading to Safe teleCOMMunication (SafeCOMM) models. Our work serves as both a diagnostic study and practical guide for safety realignment in telecom-tuned LLMs, underscoring the need for safety-aware instruction and fine-tuning in the telecom domain.

**Authors**: Jiaqi Lv, Esha Sadia Nasir, Kesi Xu, Mostafa Jahanifar, Brinder Singh Chohan, Behnaz Elhaminia, Shan E Ahmed Raza

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T17:31:42Z

**Summary**: Accurate detection and classification of nuclei in histopathology images are critical for diagnostic and research applications. We present KongNet, a multi-headed deep learning architecture featuring a shared encoder and parallel, cell-type-specialised decoders. Through multi-task learning, each decoder jointly predicts nuclei centroids, segmentation masks, and contours, aided by Spatial and Channel Squeeze-and-Excitation (SCSE) attention modules and a composite loss function. We validate KongNet in three Grand Challenges. The proposed model achieved first place on track 1 and second place on track 2 during the MONKEY Challenge. Its lightweight variant (KongNet-Det) secured first place in the 2025 MIDOG Challenge. KongNet pre-trained on the MONKEY dataset and fine-tuned on the PUMA dataset ranked among the top three in the PUMA Challenge without further optimisation. Furthermore, KongNet established state-of-the-art performance on the publicly available PanNuke and CoNIC datasets. Our results demonstrate that the specialised multi-decoder design is highly effective for nuclei detection and classification across diverse tissue and stain types. The pre-trained model weights along with the inference code have been publicly released to support future research.

### ISA-Bench: Benchmarking Instruction Sensitivity for Large Audio Language   Models
**Authors**: Bohan Li, Wenbin Huang, Yuhang Qiu, Yiwei Guo, Hankun Wang, Zhihan Li, Jing Peng, Ziyang Ma, Xie Chen, Kai Yu

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T17:31:25Z

**Summary**: Large Audio Language Models (LALMs), which couple acoustic perception with large language models (LLMs) to extract and understand diverse information from audio, have attracted intense interest from both academic and industrial communities. However, existing LALMs are highly sensitive to how instructions are phrased, affecting both (i) instruction-following rates and (ii) task performance. Yet, no existing benchmarks offer a systematic and comprehensive evaluation of this sensitivity. We introduce ISA-Bench, a dynamic benchmark evaluating instruction sensitivity for LALMs along three axes: instruction description, output format, and task composition. We assess recent open-source and proprietary LALMs using ISA-Bench, profiling both compliance and accuracy under controlled instruction variations. Experimental results reveal that even state-of-the-art LALMs suffer significant instruction sensitivity, leading to degraded performance on fundamental audio understanding tasks. To mitigate this issue, we fine-tune Qwen2-Audio on a specifically constructed complex instruction-variant dataset, achieving a marked improvement in instruction-following performance. However, this also induces nontrivial catastrophic forgetting: the model loses some previously mastered task capabilities when exposed to new instruction styles. Our benchmark provides a standardized basis for assessing and improving instruction sensitivity in LALMs, underscoring the need for instruction-robust audio understanding in real-world pipelines.

### Fixing It in Post: A Comparative Study of LLM Post-Training Data Quality   and Model Performance
**Authors**: Aladin Djuhera, Swanand Ravindra Kadhe, Syed Zawad, Farhan Ahmed, Heiko Ludwig, Holger Boche

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T17:31:21Z

**Summary**: Recent work on large language models (LLMs) has increasingly focused on post-training and alignment with datasets curated to enhance instruction following, world knowledge, and specialized skills. However, most post-training datasets used in leading open- and closed-source LLMs remain inaccessible to the public, with limited information about their construction process. This lack of transparency has motivated the recent development of open-source post-training corpora. While training on these open alternatives can yield performance comparable to that of leading models, systematic comparisons remain challenging due to the significant computational cost of conducting them rigorously at scale, and are therefore largely absent. As a result, it remains unclear how specific samples, task types, or curation strategies influence downstream performance when assessing data quality. In this work, we conduct the first comprehensive side-by-side analysis of two prominent open post-training datasets: Tulu-3-SFT-Mix and SmolTalk. Using the Magpie framework, we annotate each sample with detailed quality metrics, including turn structure (single-turn vs. multi-turn), task category, input quality, and response quality, and we derive statistics that reveal structural and qualitative similarities and differences between the two datasets. Based on these insights, we design a principled curation recipe that produces a new data mixture, TuluTalk, which contains 14% fewer samples than either source dataset while matching or exceeding their performance on key benchmarks. Our findings offer actionable insights for constructing more effective post-training datasets that improve model performance within practical resource limits. To support future research, we publicly release both the annotated source datasets and our curated TuluTalk mixture.

### Bayesian Nonlinear PDE Inference via Gaussian Process Collocation with   Application to the Richards Equation
**Authors**: Yumo Yang, Anass Ben Bouazza, Xuejun Dong, Quan Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T17:27:18Z

**Summary**: The estimation of unknown parameters in nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) offers valuable insights across a wide range of scientific domains. In this work, we focus on estimating plant root parameters in the Richards equation, which is essential for understanding the soil-plant system in agricultural studies. Since conventional methods are computationally intensive and often yield unstable estimates, we develop a new Gaussian process collocation method for efficient Bayesian inference. Unlike existing Gaussian process-based approaches, our method constructs an approximate posterior distribution using samples drawn from a Gaussian process model fitted to the observed data, which does not require any structural assumption about the underlying PDE. Further, we propose to use an importance sampling procedure to correct for the discrepancy between the approximate and true posterior distributions. As an alternative, we also devise a prior-guided Bayesian optimization algorithm leveraging the approximate posterior. Simulation studies demonstrate that our method yields robust estimates under various settings. Finally, we apply our method on a real agricultural data set and estimate the plant root parameters with uncertainty quantification.

### Enhancing Graph Neural Networks: A Mutual Learning Approach
**Authors**: Paul Agbaje, Arkajyoti Mitra, Afia Anjum, Pranali Khose, Ebelechukwu Nwafor, Habeeb Olufowobi

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T17:26:39Z

**Summary**: Knowledge distillation (KD) techniques have emerged as a powerful tool for transferring expertise from complex teacher models to lightweight student models, particularly beneficial for deploying high-performance models in resource-constrained devices. This approach has been successfully applied to graph neural networks (GNNs), harnessing their expressive capabilities to generate node embeddings that capture structural and feature-related information. In this study, we depart from the conventional KD approach by exploring the potential of collaborative learning among GNNs. In the absence of a pre-trained teacher model, we show that relatively simple and shallow GNN architectures can synergetically learn efficient models capable of performing better during inference, particularly in tackling multiple tasks. We propose a collaborative learning framework where ensembles of student GNNs mutually teach each other throughout the training process. We introduce an adaptive logit weighting unit to facilitate efficient knowledge exchange among models and an entropy enhancement technique to improve mutual learning. These components dynamically empower the models to adapt their learning strategies during training, optimizing their performance for downstream tasks. Extensive experiments conducted on three datasets each for node and graph classification demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

### Human-Aligned Faithfulness in Toxicity Explanations of LLMs
**Authors**: Ramaravind K. Mothilal, Joanna Roy, Syed Ishtiaque Ahmed, Shion Guha

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T17:23:28Z

**Summary**: The discourse around toxicity and LLMs in NLP largely revolves around detection tasks. This work shifts the focus to evaluating LLMs' reasoning about toxicity -- from their explanations that justify a stance -- to enhance their trustworthiness in downstream tasks. Despite extensive research on explainability, it is not straightforward to adopt existing methods to evaluate free-form toxicity explanation due to their over-reliance on input text perturbations, among other challenges. To account for these, we propose a novel, theoretically-grounded multi-dimensional criterion, Human-Aligned Faithfulness (HAF), that measures the extent to which LLMs' free-form toxicity explanations align with those of a rational human under ideal conditions. We develop six metrics, based on uncertainty quantification, to comprehensively evaluate HAF of LLMs' toxicity explanations with no human involvement, and highlight how "non-ideal" the explanations are. We conduct several experiments on three Llama models (of size up to 70B) and an 8B Ministral model on five diverse toxicity datasets. Our results show that while LLMs generate plausible explanations to simple prompts, their reasoning about toxicity breaks down when prompted about the nuanced relations between the complete set of reasons, the individual reasons, and their toxicity stances, resulting in inconsistent and irrelevant responses. We open-source our code at https://github.com/uofthcdslab/HAF and LLM-generated explanations at https://huggingface.co/collections/uofthcdslab/haf.

### LimRank: Less is More for Reasoning-Intensive Information Reranking
**Authors**: Tingyu Song, Yilun Zhao, Siyue Zhang, Chen Zhao, Arman Cohan

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T17:19:37Z

**Summary**: Existing approaches typically rely on large-scale fine-tuning to adapt LLMs for information reranking tasks, which is computationally expensive. In this work, we demonstrate that modern LLMs can be effectively adapted using only minimal, high-quality supervision. To enable this, we design LIMRANK-SYNTHESIZER, a reusable and open-source pipeline for generating diverse, challenging, and realistic reranking examples. Using this synthetic data, we fine-tune our reranker model, LIMRANK. We evaluate LIMRANK on two challenging benchmarks, i.e., BRIGHT for reasoning-intensive retrieval and FollowIR for instruction-following retrieval. Our experiments demonstrate that LIMRANK achieves competitive performance, while being trained on less than 5% of the data typically used in prior work. Further ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of LIMRANK-SYNTHESIZER and the strong generalization capabilities of LIMRANK across downstream tasks, including scientific literature search and retrieval-augmented generation for knowledge-intensive problem solving.

### IPQA: A Benchmark for Core Intent Identification in Personalized   Question Answering
**Authors**: Jieyong Kim, Maryam Amirizaniani, Soojin Yoon, Dongha Lee

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T17:12:49Z

**Summary**: Intent identification serves as the foundation for generating appropriate responses in personalized question answering (PQA). However, existing benchmarks evaluate only response quality or retrieval performance without directly measuring intent identification capabilities. This gap is critical because without understanding which intents users prioritize, systems cannot generate responses satisfying individual information needs. To address this, we introduce the concept of core intents: intents users prioritize when selecting answers to satisfy their information needs. To evaluate these core intents, we propose IPQA, a benchmark for core Intent identification in Personalized Question Answering. Since users do not explicitly state their prioritized intents, we derive core intents from observable behavior patterns in answer selection, grounded in satisficing theory where users choose answers meeting their acceptance thresholds. We construct a dataset with various domains through systematic filtering, LLM-based annotation, and rigorous quality control combining automated verification with human validation. Experimental evaluations across state-of-the-art language models reveal that current systems struggle with core intent identification in personalized contexts. Models fail to identify core intents from user histories, with performance degrading as question complexity increases. The code and dataset will be made publicly available to facilitate future research in this direction.

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T17:09:22Z

**Summary**: We present the discovery of SN 2025wny (ZTF25abnjznp/GOTO25gtq) and spectroscopic classification of this event as the first gravitationally lensed Type I superluminous supernovae (SLSN-I). Deep ground-based follow-up observations resolves four images of the supernova with ~1.7" angular separation from the main lens galaxy, each coincident with the lensed images of a background galaxy seen in archival imaging of the field. Spectroscopy of the brightest point image shows narrow features matching absorption lines at a redshift of z = 2.011 and broad features matching those seen in superluminous SNe with Far-UV coverage. We infer a magnification factor of 20 to 50 for the brightest image in the system, based on photometric and spectroscopic comparisons to other SLSNe-I. SN 2025wny demonstrates that gravitationally-lensed SNe are in reach of ground-based facilities out to redshifts far higher than what has been previously assumed, and provide a unique window into studying distant supernovae, internal properties of dwarf galaxies, as well as for time-delay cosmography.

### AttentionRAG: Attention-Guided Context Pruning in Retrieval-Augmented   Generation
**Authors**: Yixiong Fang, Tianran Sun, Yuling Shi, Xiaodong Gu

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T16:55:55Z

**Summary**: While RAG demonstrates remarkable capabilities in LLM applications, its effectiveness is hindered by the ever-increasing length of retrieved contexts, which introduces information redundancy and substantial computational overhead. Existing context pruning methods, such as LLMLingua, lack contextual awareness and offer limited flexibility in controlling compression rates, often resulting in either insufficient pruning or excessive information loss. In this paper, we propose AttentionRAG, an attention-guided context pruning method for RAG systems. The core idea of AttentionRAG lies in its attention focus mechanism, which reformulates RAG queries into a next-token prediction paradigm. This mechanism isolates the query's semantic focus to a single token, enabling precise and efficient attention calculation between queries and retrieved contexts. Extensive experiments on LongBench and Babilong benchmarks show that AttentionRAG achieves up to 6.3$\times$ context compression while outperforming LLMLingua methods by around 10\% in key metrics.

### FreeFuse: Multi-Subject LoRA Fusion via Auto Masking at Test Time
**Authors**: Yaoli Liu, Yao-Xiang Ding, Kun Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T16:54:08Z

**Summary**: This paper proposes FreeFuse, a novel training-free approach for multi-subject text-to-image generation through automatic fusion of multiple subject LoRAs. In contrast to existing methods that either focus on pre-inference LoRA weight merging or rely on segmentation models and complex techniques like noise blending to isolate LoRA outputs, our key insight is that context-aware dynamic subject masks can be automatically derived from cross-attention layer weights. Mathematical analysis shows that directly applying these masks to LoRA outputs during inference well approximates the case where the subject LoRA is integrated into the diffusion model and used individually for the masked region. FreeFuse demonstrates superior practicality and efficiency as it requires no additional training, no modification to LoRAs, no auxiliary models, and no user-defined prompt templates or region specifications. Alternatively, it only requires users to provide the LoRA activation words for seamless integration into standard workflows. Extensive experiments validate that FreeFuse outperforms existing approaches in both generation quality and usability under the multi-subject generation tasks.

### Deductive Chain-of-Thought Augmented Socially-aware Robot Navigation   World Model
**Authors**: Weizheng Wang, Obi Ike, Soyun Choi, Sungeun Hong, Byung-Cheol Min

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T16:47:15Z

**Summary**: Social robot navigation increasingly relies on large language models for reasoning, path planning, and enabling movement in dynamic human spaces. However, relying solely on LLMs for planning often leads to unpredictable and unsafe behaviors, especially in dynamic human spaces, due to limited physical grounding and weak logical consistency. In this work, we introduce NaviWM, a socially-aware robot Navigation World Model that augments LLM reasoning with a structured world model and a logic-driven chain-of-thought process. NaviWM consists of two main components: (1) a spatial-temporal world model that captures the positions, velocities, and activities of agents in the environment, and (2) a deductive reasoning module that guides LLMs through a multi-step, logic-based inference process. This integration enables the robot to generate navigation decisions that are both socially compliant and physically safe, under well-defined constraints such as personal space, collision avoidance, and timing. Unlike previous methods based on prompting or fine-tuning, NaviWM encodes social norms as first-order logic, enabling interpretable and verifiable reasoning. Experiments show that NaviWM improves success rates and reduces social violations, particularly in crowded environments. These results demonstrate the benefit of combining formal reasoning with LLMs for robust social navigation. Additional experimental details and demo videos for this work can be found at: https://sites.google.com/view/NaviWM.

### Synthesize Privacy-Preserving High-Resolution Images via Private Textual   Intermediaries
**Authors**: Haoxiang Wang, Zinan Lin, Da Yu, Huishuai Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T16:44:01Z

**Summary**: Generating high fidelity, differentially private (DP) synthetic images offers a promising route to share and analyze sensitive visual data without compromising individual privacy. However, existing DP image synthesis methods struggle to produce high resolution outputs that faithfully capture the structure of the original data. In this paper, we introduce a novel method, referred to as Synthesis via Private Textual Intermediaries (SPTI), that can generate high resolution DP images with easy adoption. The key idea is to shift the challenge of DP image synthesis from the image domain to the text domain by leveraging state of the art DP text generation methods. SPTI first summarizes each private image into a concise textual description using image to text models, then applies a modified Private Evolution algorithm to generate DP text, and finally reconstructs images using text to image models. Notably, SPTI requires no model training, only inference with off the shelf models. Given a private dataset, SPTI produces synthetic images of substantially higher quality than prior DP approaches. On the LSUN Bedroom dataset, SPTI attains an FID equal to 26.71 under epsilon equal to 1.0, improving over Private Evolution FID of 40.36. Similarly, on MM CelebA HQ, SPTI achieves an FID equal to 33.27 at epsilon equal to 1.0, compared to 57.01 from DP fine tuning baselines. Overall, our results demonstrate that Synthesis via Private Textual Intermediaries provides a resource efficient and proprietary model compatible framework for generating high resolution DP synthetic images, greatly expanding access to private visual datasets.

### Emotion-Coherent Reasoning for Multimodal LLMs via Emotional Rationale   Verifier
**Authors**: Hyeongseop Rha, Jeong Hun Yeo, Yeonju Kim, Yong Man Ro

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T16:40:17Z

**Summary**: The recent advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is transforming human-computer interaction (HCI) from surface-level exchanges into more nuanced and emotionally intelligent communication. To realize this shift, emotion understanding becomes essential allowing systems to capture subtle cues underlying user intent. Furthermore, providing faithful explanations for predicted emotions is crucial to ensure interpretability and build user trust. However, current MLLM-based methods often generate emotion explanations that diverge from the target labels and sometimes even contradict their own predicted emotions. This inconsistency poses a critical risk for misunderstanding and erodes reliability in interactive settings. To address this, we propose a novel approach: the Emotional Rationale Verifier (ERV) and an Explanation Reward. Our method guides the model to produce reasoning that is explicitly consistent with the target emotion during multimodal emotion recognition without modifying the model architecture or requiring additional paired video-description annotations. Our method significantly improves faithful explanation-prediction consistency and explanation emotion accuracy on the MAFW and DFEW datasets. Through extensive experiments and human evaluations, we show that our approach not only enhances alignment between explanation and prediction but also empowers MLLMs to deliver emotionally coherent, trustworthy interactions, marking a key step toward truly human-like HCI systems.

### Cancer-Myth: Evaluating AI Chatbot on Patient Questions with False   Presuppositions
**Authors**: Wang Bill Zhu, Tianqi Chen, Xinyan Velocity Yu, Ching Ying Lin, Jade Law, Mazen Jizzini, Jorge J. Nieva, Ruishan Liu, Robin Jia

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T16:39:30Z

**Summary**: Cancer patients are increasingly turning to large language models (LLMs) for medical information, making it critical to assess how well these models handle complex, personalized questions. However, current medical benchmarks focus on medical exams or consumer-searched questions and do not evaluate LLMs on real patient questions with patient details. In this paper, we first have three hematology-oncology physicians evaluate cancer-related questions drawn from real patients. While LLM responses are generally accurate, the models frequently fail to recognize or address false presuppositions in the questions, posing risks to safe medical decision-making. To study this limitation systematically, we introduce Cancer-Myth, an expert-verified adversarial dataset of 585 cancer-related questions with false presuppositions. On this benchmark, no frontier LLM -- including GPT-5, Gemini-2.5-Pro, and Claude-4-Sonnet -- corrects these false presuppositions more than $43\%$ of the time. To study mitigation strategies, we further construct a 150-question Cancer-Myth-NFP set, in which physicians confirm the absence of false presuppositions. We find typical mitigation strategies, such as adding precautionary prompts with GEPA optimization, can raise accuracy on Cancer-Myth to $80\%$, but at the cost of misidentifying presuppositions in $41\%$ of Cancer-Myth-NFP questions and causing a $10\%$ relative performance drop on other medical benchmarks. These findings highlight a critical gap in the reliability of LLMs, show that prompting alone is not a reliable remedy for false presuppositions, and underscore the need for more robust safeguards in medical AI systems.

### Topology Sculptor, Shape Refiner: Discrete Diffusion Model for   High-Fidelity 3D Meshes Generation
**Authors**: Kaiyu Song, Hanjiang Lai, Yaqing Zhang, Chuangjian Cai, Yan Pan Kun Yue, Jian Yin

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T16:38:35Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we introduce Topology Sculptor, Shape Refiner (TSSR), a novel method for generating high-quality, artist-style 3D meshes based on Discrete Diffusion Models (DDMs). Our primary motivation for TSSR is to achieve highly accurate token prediction while enabling parallel generation, a significant advantage over sequential autoregressive methods. By allowing TSSR to "see" all mesh tokens concurrently, we unlock a new level of efficiency and control. We leverage this parallel generation capability through three key innovations: 1) Decoupled Training and Hybrid Inference, which distinctly separates the DDM-based generation into a topology sculpting stage and a subsequent shape refinement stage. This strategic decoupling enables TSSR to effectively capture both intricate local topology and overarching global shape. 2) An Improved Hourglass Architecture, featuring bidirectional attention enriched by face-vertex-sequence level Rotational Positional Embeddings (RoPE), thereby capturing richer contextual information across the mesh structure. 3) A novel Connection Loss, which acts as a topological constraint to further enhance the realism and fidelity of the generated meshes. Extensive experiments on complex datasets demonstrate that TSSR generates high-quality 3D artist-style meshes, capable of achieving up to 10,000 faces at a remarkable spatial resolution of $1024^3$. The code will be released at: https://github.com/psky1111/Tencent-TSSR.

### Bayes-Split-Edge: Bayesian Optimization for Constrained Collaborative   Inference in Wireless Edge Systems
**Authors**: Fatemeh Zahra Safaeipour, Jacob Chakareski, Morteza Hashemi

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T16:36:51Z

**Summary**: Mobile edge devices (e.g., AR/VR headsets) typically need to complete timely inference tasks while operating with limited on-board computing and energy resources. In this paper, we investigate the problem of collaborative inference in wireless edge networks, where energy-constrained edge devices aim to complete inference tasks within given deadlines. These tasks are carried out using neural networks, and the edge device seeks to optimize inference performance under energy and delay constraints. The inference process can be split between the edge device and an edge server, thereby achieving collaborative inference over wireless networks. We formulate an inference utility optimization problem subject to energy and delay constraints, and propose a novel solution called Bayes-Split-Edge, which leverages Bayesian optimization for collaborative split inference over wireless edge networks. Our solution jointly optimizes the transmission power and the neural network split point. The Bayes-Split-Edge framework incorporates a novel hybrid acquisition function that balances inference task utility, sample efficiency, and constraint violation penalties. We evaluate our approach using the VGG19 model on the ImageNet-Mini dataset, and Resnet101 on Tiny-ImageNet, and real-world mMobile wireless channel datasets. Numerical results demonstrate that Bayes-Split-Edge achieves up to 2.4x reduction in evaluation cost compared to standard Bayesian optimization and achieves near-linear convergence. It also outperforms several baselines, including CMA-ES, DIRECT, exhaustive search, and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), while matching exhaustive search performance under tight constraints. These results confirm that the proposed framework provides a sample-efficient solution requiring maximum 20 function evaluations and constraint-aware optimization for wireless split inference in edge computing systems.

### VOLD: Reasoning Transfer from LLMs to Vision-Language Models via   On-Policy Distillation
**Authors**: Walid Bousselham, Hilde Kuehne, Cordelia Schmid

**Updated**: 2025-10-28T11:09:37Z

**Summary**: Training vision-language models (VLMs) for complex reasoning remains a challenging task, i.a. due to the scarcity of high-quality image-text reasoning data. Conversely, text-based reasoning resources are abundant and scalable, but it is still an open question how to leveraging them for VLM reasoning. To address this problem, we propose VOLD, a framework to transfer reasoning capabilities from text-only teacher models to VLM student models. To this end, VOLD combines reinforcement learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with on-policy distillation, which allows the student reasoning traces to be guided by the teacher model, resulting in a significant gain over using GRPO alone. We further show that a cold-start alignment is essential for an effective transfer during the online training phase in this scenario and that without sufficient distributional alignment between teacher and student, on-policy distillation fails to provide meaningful guidance. We evaluate VOLD across diverse benchmarks including MMMU-Pro, MathVision, MathVista, and LogicVista, showing that VOLD outperforms the baseline model significantly and improves over the state of the art by a margin. Our ablation shows the importance of a cold-start alignment via SFT for on-policy distillation with a text-only teacher.

### COOPERA: Continual Open-Ended Human-Robot Assistance
**Authors**: Chenyang Ma, Kai Lu, Ruta Desai, Xavier Puig, Andrew Markham, Niki Trigoni

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T16:29:11Z

**Summary**: To understand and collaborate with humans, robots must account for individual human traits, habits, and activities over time. However, most robotic assistants lack these abilities, as they primarily focus on predefined tasks in structured environments and lack a human model to learn from. This work introduces COOPERA, a novel framework for COntinual, OPen-Ended human-Robot Assistance, where simulated humans, driven by psychological traits and long-term intentions, interact with robots in complex environments. By integrating continuous human feedback, our framework, for the first time, enables the study of long-term, open-ended human-robot collaboration (HRC) in different collaborative tasks across various time-scales. Within COOPERA, we introduce a benchmark and an approach to personalize the robot's collaborative actions by learning human traits and context-dependent intents. Experiments validate the extent to which our simulated humans reflect realistic human behaviors and demonstrate the value of inferring and personalizing to human intents for open-ended and long-term HRC.

### Are Agents Just Automata? On the Formal Equivalence Between Agentic AI   and the Chomsky Hierarchy
**Authors**: Roham Koohestani, Ziyou Li, Anton Podkopaev, Maliheh Izadi

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T16:22:02Z

**Summary**: This paper establishes a formal equivalence between the architectural classes of modern agentic AI systems and the abstract machines of the Chomsky hierarchy. We posit that the memory architecture of an AI agent is the definitive feature determining its computational power and that it directly maps it to a corresponding class of automaton. Specifically, we demonstrate that simple reflex agents are equivalent to Finite Automata, hierarchical task-decomposition agents are equivalent to Pushdown Automata, and agents employing readable/writable memory for reflection are equivalent to TMs. This Automata-Agent Framework provides a principled methodology for right-sizing agent architectures to optimize computational efficiency and cost. More critically, it creates a direct pathway to formal verification, enables the application of mature techniques from automata theory to guarantee agent safety and predictability. By classifying agents, we can formally delineate the boundary between verifiable systems and those whose behavior is fundamentally undecidable. We address the inherent probabilistic nature of LLM-based agents by extending the framework to probabilistic automata that allow quantitative risk analysis. The paper concludes by outlining an agenda for developing static analysis tools and grammars for agentic frameworks.

### Leveraging Approximate Caching for Faster Retrieval-Augmented Generation
**Authors**: Shai Bergman, Anne-Marie Kermarrec, Diana Petrescu, Rafael Pires, Mathis Randl, Martijn de Vos, Ji Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T16:20:28Z

**Summary**: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) improves the reliability of large language model (LLM) answers by integrating external knowledge. However, RAG increases the end-to-end inference time since looking for relevant documents from large vector databases is computationally expensive. To address this, we introduce Proximity, an approximate key-value cache that optimizes the RAG workflow by leveraging similarities in user queries. Instead of treating each query independently, Proximity reuses previously retrieved documents when similar queries appear, substantially reducing the reliance on expensive vector database lookups. To efficiently scale, Proximity employs a locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) scheme that enables fast cache lookups while preserving retrieval accuracy. We evaluate Proximity using the MMLU and MedRAG question-answering benchmarks. Our experiments demonstrate that Proximity with our LSH scheme and a realistically-skewed MedRAG workload reduces database calls by 77.2% while maintaining database recall and test accuracy. We experiment with different similarity tolerances and cache capacities, and show that the time spent within the Proximity cache remains low and constant (4.8 microseconds) even as the cache grows substantially in size. Our results demonstrate that approximate caching is a practical and effective strategy for optimizing RAG-based systems.

### Validating LLM-as-a-Judge Systems under Rating Indeterminacy
**Authors**: Luke Guerdan, Solon Barocas, Kenneth Holstein, Hanna Wallach, Zhiwei Steven Wu, Alexandra Chouldechova

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T16:18:11Z

**Summary**: The LLM-as-a-judge paradigm, in which a judge LLM system replaces human raters in rating the outputs of other generative AI (GenAI) systems, plays a critical role in scaling and standardizing GenAI evaluations. To validate such judge systems, evaluators assess human--judge agreement by first collecting multiple human ratings for each item in a validation corpus, then aggregating the ratings into a single, per-item gold label rating. For many items, however, rating criteria may admit multiple valid interpretations, so a human or LLM rater may deem multiple ratings "reasonable" or "correct." We call this condition rating indeterminacy. Problematically, many rating tasks that contain rating indeterminacy rely on forced-choice elicitation, whereby raters are instructed to select only one rating for each item. In this paper, we introduce a framework for validating LLM-as-a-judge systems under rating indeterminacy. We draw theoretical connections between different measures of judge system performance under different human--judge agreement metrics, and different rating elicitation and aggregation schemes. We demonstrate that differences in how humans and LLMs resolve rating indeterminacy when responding to forced-choice rating instructions can heavily bias LLM-as-a-judge validation. Through extensive experiments involving 11 real-world rating tasks and 9 commercial LLMs, we show that standard validation approaches that rely upon forced-choice ratings select judge systems that are highly suboptimal, performing as much as 31% worse than judge systems selected by our approach that uses multi-label "response set" ratings to account for rating indeterminacy. We conclude with concrete recommendations for more principled approaches to LLM-as-a-judge validation.

### Less is More: Local Intrinsic Dimensions of Contextual Language Models
**Authors**: Benjamin Matthias Ruppik, Julius von Rohrscheidt, Carel van Niekerk, Michael Heck, Renato Vukovic, Shutong Feng, Hsien-chin Lin, Nurul Lubis, Bastian Rieck, Marcus Zibrowius, Milica Gašić

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T16:17:17Z

**Summary**: Understanding the internal mechanisms of large language models (LLMs) remains a challenging and complex endeavor. Even fundamental questions, such as how fine-tuning affects model behavior, often require extensive empirical evaluation. In this paper, we introduce a novel perspective based on the geometric properties of contextual latent embeddings to study the effects of training and fine-tuning. To that end, we measure the local dimensions of a contextual language model's latent space and analyze their shifts during training and fine-tuning. We show that the local dimensions provide insights into the model's training dynamics and generalization ability. Specifically, the mean of the local dimensions predicts when the model's training capabilities are exhausted, as exemplified in a dialogue state tracking task, overfitting, as demonstrated in an emotion recognition task, and grokking, as illustrated with an arithmetic task. Furthermore, our experiments suggest a practical heuristic: reductions in the mean local dimension tend to accompany and predict subsequent performance gains. Through this exploration, we aim to provide practitioners with a deeper understanding of the implications of fine-tuning on embedding spaces, facilitating informed decisions when configuring models for specific applications. The results of this work contribute to the ongoing discourse on the interpretability, adaptability, and generalizability of LLMs by bridging the gap between intrinsic model mechanisms and geometric properties in the respective embeddings.

### Effortless, Simulation-Efficient Bayesian Inference using Tabular   Foundation Models
**Authors**: Julius Vetter, Manuel Gloeckler, Daniel Gedon, Jakob H. Macke

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T16:14:05Z

**Summary**: Simulation-based inference (SBI) offers a flexible and general approach to performing Bayesian inference: In SBI, a neural network is trained on synthetic data simulated from a model and used to rapidly infer posterior distributions for observed data. A key goal for SBI is to achieve accurate inference with as few simulations as possible, especially for expensive simulators. In this work, we address this challenge by repurposing recent probabilistic foundation models for tabular data: We show how tabular foundation models -- specifically TabPFN -- can be used as pre-trained autoregressive conditional density estimators for SBI. We propose Neural Posterior Estimation with Prior-data Fitted Networks (NPE-PFN) and show that it is competitive with current SBI approaches in terms of accuracy for both benchmark tasks and two complex scientific inverse problems. Crucially, it often substantially outperforms them in terms of simulation efficiency, sometimes requiring orders of magnitude fewer simulations. NPE-PFN eliminates the need for inference network selection, training, and hyperparameter tuning. We also show that it exhibits superior robustness to model misspecification and can be scaled to simulation budgets that exceed the context size limit of TabPFN. NPE-PFN provides a new direction for SBI, where training-free, general-purpose inference models offer efficient, easy-to-use, and flexible solutions for a wide range of stochastic inverse problems.

### MMTutorBench: The First Multimodal Benchmark for AI Math Tutoring
**Authors**: Tengchao Yang, Sichen Guo, Mengzhao Jia, Jiaming Su, Yuanyang Liu, Zhihan Zhang, Meng Jiang

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T16:11:49Z

**Summary**: Effective math tutoring requires not only solving problems but also diagnosing students' difficulties and guiding them step by step. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show promise, existing benchmarks largely overlook these tutoring skills. We introduce MMTutorBench, the first benchmark for AI math tutoring, consisting of 685 problems built around pedagogically significant key-steps. Each problem is paired with problem-specific rubrics that enable fine-grained evaluation across six dimensions, and structured into three tasks-Insight Discovery, Operation Formulation, and Operation Execution. We evaluate 12 leading MLLMs and find clear performance gaps between proprietary and open-source systems, substantial room compared to human tutors, and consistent trends across input variants: OCR pipelines degrade tutoring quality, few-shot prompting yields limited gains, and our rubric-based LLM-as-a-Judge proves highly reliable. These results highlight both the difficulty and diagnostic value of MMTutorBench for advancing AI tutoring.

### Policy-Aware Generative AI for Safe, Auditable Data Access Governance
**Authors**: Shames Al Mandalawi, Muzakkiruddin Ahmed Mohammed, Hendrika Maclean, Mert Can Cakmak, John R. Talburt

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T16:10:55Z

**Summary**: Enterprises need access decisions that satisfy least privilege, comply with regulations, and remain auditable. We present a policy aware controller that uses a large language model (LLM) to interpret natural language requests against written policies and metadata, not raw data. The system, implemented with Google Gemini~2.0 Flash, executes a six-stage reasoning framework (context interpretation, user validation, data classification, business purpose test, compliance mapping, and risk synthesis) with early hard policy gates and deny by default. It returns APPROVE, DENY, CONDITIONAL together with cited controls and a machine readable rationale. We evaluate on fourteen canonical cases across seven scenario families using a privacy preserving benchmark. Results show Exact Decision Match improving from 10/14 to 13/14 (92.9\%) after applying policy gates, DENY recall rising to 1.00, False Approval Rate on must-deny families dropping to 0, and Functional Appropriateness and Compliance Adherence at 14/14. Expert ratings of rationale quality are high, and median latency is under one minute. These findings indicate that policy constrained LLM reasoning, combined with explicit gates and audit trails, can translate human readable policies into safe, compliant, and traceable machine decisions.

### Video-Thinker: Sparking "Thinking with Videos" via Reinforcement   Learning
**Authors**: Shijian Wang, Jiarui Jin, Xingjian Wang, Linxin Song, Runhao Fu, Hecheng Wang, Zongyuan Ge, Yuan Lu, Xuelian Cheng

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T16:10:45Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in image reasoning methods, particularly "Thinking with Images", have demonstrated remarkable success in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs); however, this dynamic reasoning paradigm has not yet been extended to video reasoning tasks. In this paper, we propose Video-Thinker, which empowers MLLMs to think with videos by autonomously leveraging their intrinsic "grounding" and "captioning" capabilities to generate reasoning clues throughout the inference process. To spark this capability, we construct Video-Thinker-10K, a curated dataset featuring autonomous tool usage within chain-of-thought reasoning sequences. Our training strategy begins with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to learn the reasoning format, followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to strengthen this reasoning capability. Through this approach, Video-Thinker enables MLLMs to autonomously navigate grounding and captioning tasks for video reasoning, eliminating the need for constructing and calling external tools. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Video-Thinker achieves significant performance gains on both in-domain tasks and challenging out-of-domain video reasoning benchmarks, including Video-Holmes, CG-Bench-Reasoning, and VRBench. Our Video-Thinker-7B substantially outperforms existing baselines such as Video-R1 and establishes state-of-the-art performance among 7B-sized MLLMs.

### Evaluating Large Language Models for Stance Detection on Financial   Targets from SEC Filing Reports and Earnings Call Transcripts
**Authors**: Nikesh Gyawali, Doina Caragea, Alex Vasenkov, Cornelia Caragea

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T16:03:20Z

**Summary**: Financial narratives from U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing reports and quarterly earnings call transcripts (ECTs) are very important for investors, auditors, and regulators. However, their length, financial jargon, and nuanced language make fine-grained analysis difficult. Prior sentiment analysis in the financial domain required a large, expensive labeled dataset, making the sentence-level stance towards specific financial targets challenging. In this work, we introduce a sentence-level corpus for stance detection focused on three core financial metrics: debt, earnings per share (EPS), and sales. The sentences were extracted from Form 10-K annual reports and ECTs, and labeled for stance (positive, negative, neutral) using the advanced ChatGPT-o3-pro model under rigorous human validation. Using this corpus, we conduct a systematic evaluation of modern large language models (LLMs) using zero-shot, few-shot, and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting strategies. Our results show that few-shot with CoT prompting performs best compared to supervised baselines, and LLMs' performance varies across the SEC and ECT datasets. Our findings highlight the practical viability of leveraging LLMs for target-specific stance in the financial domain without requiring extensive labeled data.

### BrowseConf: Confidence-Guided Test-Time Scaling for Web Agents
**Authors**: Litu Ou, Kuan Li, Huifeng Yin, Liwen Zhang, Zhongwang Zhang, Xixi Wu, Rui Ye, Zile Qiao, Yong Jiang, Pengjun Xie, Fei Huang, Jingren Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T15:58:51Z

**Summary**: Confidence in LLMs is a useful indicator of model uncertainty and answer reliability. Existing work mainly focused on single-turn scenarios, while research on confidence in complex multi-turn interactions is limited. In this paper, we investigate whether LLM-based search agents have the ability to communicate their own confidence through verbalized confidence scores after long sequences of actions, a significantly more challenging task compared to outputting confidence in a single interaction. Experimenting on open-source agentic models, we first find that models exhibit much higher task accuracy at high confidence while having near-zero accuracy when confidence is low. Based on this observation, we propose Test-Time Scaling (TTS) methods that use confidence scores to determine answer quality, encourage the model to try again until reaching a satisfactory confidence level. Results show that our proposed methods significantly reduce token consumption while demonstrating competitive performance compared to baseline fixed budget TTS methods.

### Detect Any Sound: Open-Vocabulary Sound Event Detection with Multi-Modal   Queries
**Authors**: Pengfei Cai, Yan Song, Qing Gu, Nan Jiang, Haoyu Song, Ian McLoughlin

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T15:55:48Z

**Summary**: Most existing sound event detection~(SED) algorithms operate under a closed-set assumption, restricting their detection capabilities to predefined classes. While recent efforts have explored language-driven zero-shot SED by exploiting audio-language models, their performance is still far from satisfactory due to the lack of fine-grained alignment and cross-modal feature fusion. In this work, we propose the Detect Any Sound Model (DASM), a query-based framework for open-vocabulary SED guided by multi-modal queries. DASM formulates SED as a frame-level retrieval task, where audio features are matched against query vectors derived from text or audio prompts. To support this formulation, DASM introduces a dual-stream decoder that explicitly decouples event recognition and temporal localization: a cross-modality event decoder performs query-feature fusion and determines the presence of sound events at the clip-level, while a context network models temporal dependencies for frame-level localization. Additionally, an inference-time attention masking strategy is proposed to leverage semantic relations between base and novel classes, substantially enhancing generalization to novel classes. Experiments on the AudioSet Strong dataset demonstrate that DASM effectively balances localization accuracy with generalization to novel classes, outperforming CLAP-based methods in open-vocabulary setting (+ 7.8 PSDS) and the baseline in the closed-set setting (+ 6.9 PSDS). Furthermore, in cross-dataset zero-shot evaluation on DESED, DASM achieves a PSDS1 score of 42.2, even exceeding the supervised CRNN baseline. The project page is available at https://cai525.github.io/Transformer4SED/demo_page/DASM/.

### A Physics-Informed Variational Inference Framework for Identifying   Attributions of Extreme Stress Events in Low-Grain Polycrystals
**Authors**: Yinling Zhang, Samuel D. Dunham, Curt A. Bronkhorst, Nan Chen

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T15:39:17Z

**Summary**: Polycrystalline metal failure often begins with stress concentration at grain boundaries. Identifying which microstructural features trigger these events is important but challenging because these extreme damage events are rare and the failure mechanisms involve multiple complex processes across scales. Most existing inference methods focus on average behavior rather than rare events, whereas standard sample-based methods are computationally expensive for high-dimensional complex systems. In this paper, we develop a new variational inference framework that integrates a recently developed computationally efficient physics-informed statistical model with extreme value statistics to significantly facilitate the identification of material failure attributions. First, we reformulate the objective to emphasize observed exceedances by incorporating extreme-value theory into the likelihood, thereby highlighting tail behavior. Second, we constrain inference via a physics-informed statistical model that characterizes microstructure-stress relationships, which uniquely provides physically consistent predictions for these rare events. Third, mixture models in a reduced latent space are developed to capture the non-Gaussian characteristics of microstructural features, allowing the identification of multiple underlying mechanisms. In both controlled and realistic experimental tests for the bicrystal configuration, the framework achieves reliable extreme-event prediction and reveals the microstructural features associated with material failure, providing physical insights for material design with uncertainty quantification.

### Education Paradigm Shift To Maintain Human Competitive Advantage Over AI
**Authors**: Stanislav Selitskiy, Chihiro Inoue

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T15:38:20Z

**Summary**: Discussion about the replacement of intellectual human labour by ``thinking machines'' has been present in the public and expert discourse since the creation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) as an idea and terminology since the middle of the twentieth century. Until recently, it was more of a hypothetical concern. However, in recent years, with the rise of Generative AI, especially Large Language Models (LLM), and particularly with the widespread popularity of the ChatGPT model, that concern became practical. Many domains of human intellectual labour have to adapt to the new AI tools that give humans new functionality and opportunity, but also question the viability and necessity of some human work that used to be considered intellectual yet has now become an easily automatable commodity. Education, unexpectedly, has now become burdened by an especially crucial role of charting long-range strategies for discovering viable human skills that would guarantee their place in the world of the ubiquitous use of AI in the intellectual sphere. We highlight weaknesses of the current AI and, especially, of its LLM-based core, show that root causes of LLMs' weaknesses are unfixable by the current technologies, and propose directions in the constructivist paradigm for the changes in Education that ensure long-term advantages of humans over AI tools.

### Causal Deep Q Network
**Authors**: Elouanes Khelifi, Amir Saki, Usef Faghihi

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T15:28:17Z

**Summary**: Deep Q Networks (DQN) have shown remarkable success in various reinforcement learning tasks. However, their reliance on associative learning often leads to the acquisition of spurious correlations, hindering their problem-solving capabilities. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to integrate causal principles into DQNs, leveraging the PEACE (Probabilistic Easy vAriational Causal Effect) formula for estimating causal effects. By incorporating causal reasoning during training, our proposed framework enhances the DQN's understanding of the underlying causal structure of the environment, thereby mitigating the influence of confounding factors and spurious correlations. We demonstrate that integrating DQNs with causal capabilities significantly enhances their problem-solving capabilities without compromising performance. Experimental results on standard benchmark environments showcase that our approach outperforms conventional DQNs, highlighting the effectiveness of causal reasoning in reinforcement learning. Overall, our work presents a promising avenue for advancing the capabilities of deep reinforcement learning agents through principled causal inference.

### ARCS: Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Code Synthesis with Iterative   Refinement
**Authors**: Manish Bhattarai, Miguel Cordova, Minh Vu, Javier Santos, Ismael Boureima, Dan O'Malley

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T15:23:02Z

**Summary**: We present Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Code Synthesis (ARCS), a system that improves LLM-based code generation without fine-tuning. ARCS operates through a budgeted synthesize-execute-repair loop over a frozen model: it retrieves relevant code context before generation, proposes candidates, executes them against tests, and repairs based on execution feedback. This retrieval-before-generation design reduces hallucination and accelerates convergence. We formalize ARCS as a state-action process with provable guarantees on termination, monotonic improvement, and bounded cost. A tiered controller (Small/Medium/Large) trades latency for accuracy predictably. On HumanEval, ARCS achieves up to 87.2% pass@1 with Llama-3.1-405B, surpassing CodeAgent (82.3%) while using simpler control than tree-search methods. On TransCoder, it achieves >= 90% accuracy on most translation pairs. On a LANL scientific corpus, it improves CodeBLEU by +0.115 over baseline RAG. ARCS provides a practical, reproducible approach to reliable code synthesis using existing LLM checkpoints.

### Psi-Sampler: Initial Particle Sampling for SMC-Based Inference-Time   Reward Alignment in Score Models
**Authors**: Taehoon Yoon, Yunhong Min, Kyeongmin Yeo, Minhyuk Sung

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T15:22:41Z

**Summary**: We introduce $\Psi$-Sampler, an SMC-based framework incorporating pCNL-based initial particle sampling for effective inference-time reward alignment with a score-based generative model. Inference-time reward alignment with score-based generative models has recently gained significant traction, following a broader paradigm shift from pre-training to post-training optimization. At the core of this trend is the application of Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) to the denoising process. However, existing methods typically initialize particles from the Gaussian prior, which inadequately captures reward-relevant regions and results in reduced sampling efficiency. We demonstrate that initializing from the reward-aware posterior significantly improves alignment performance. To enable posterior sampling in high-dimensional latent spaces, we introduce the preconditioned Crank-Nicolson Langevin (pCNL) algorithm, which combines dimension-robust proposals with gradient-informed dynamics. This approach enables efficient and scalable posterior sampling and consistently improves performance across various reward alignment tasks, including layout-to-image generation, quantity-aware generation, and aesthetic-preference generation, as demonstrated in our experiments.

### How Can We Effectively Expand the Vocabulary of LLMs with 0.01GB of   Target Language Text?
**Authors**: Atsuki Yamaguchi, Aline Villavicencio, Nikolaos Aletras

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T15:19:39Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in many languages beyond English. Yet, LLMs require more inference steps when generating non-English text due to their reliance on English-centric tokenizers and vocabulary, resulting in higher usage costs to non-English speakers. Vocabulary expansion with target language tokens is a widely used cross-lingual vocabulary adaptation approach to remedy this issue. Despite its effectiveness in inference speedup, previous work on vocabulary expansion has focused on high-resource settings assuming access to a substantial amount of target language data to effectively initialize the embeddings of the new tokens and adapt the LLM to the target language. However, vocabulary expansion in low-resource settings has yet to be explored. In this article, we investigate vocabulary expansion in low-resource settings by considering embedding initialization methods and continual pre-training strategies. Through extensive experiments across typologically diverse languages, tasks and models, we establish a set of strategies to perform vocabulary expansion for faster inference, while striving to maintain competitive downstream performance to baselines. This is achieved with only 30K sentences ($\sim$0.01GB text data) from the target language.

**Summary**: Elasticity is fundamental to cloud computing, as it enables quickly allocating resources to match the demand of each workload as it arrives, rather than pre-provisioning resources to meet performance objectives. However, even serverless platforms -- which boot sandboxes in 10s to 100s of milliseconds -- are not sufficiently elastic to avoid over-provisioning expensive resources. Today's FaaS platforms rely on pre-provisioning many idle sandboxes in memory to reduce the occurrence of slow, cold starts. A key obstacle for high elasticity is booting a guest OS and configuring features like networking in sandboxes, which are required to expose an isolated POSIX-like interface to user functions. Our key insight is that redesigning the interface for applications in the cloud-native era enables co-designing a much more efficient and elastic execution system. Now is a good time to rethink cloud abstractions as developers are building applications to be cloud-native. Cloud-native applications typically consist of user-provided compute logic interacting with cloud services (for storage, AI inference, query processing, etc) exposed over REST APIs. Hence, we propose Dandelion, an elastic cloud platform with a declarative programming model that expresses applications as DAGs of pure compute functions and higher-level communication functions. Dandelion can securely execute untrusted user compute functions in lightweight sandboxes that cold start in hundreds of microseconds, since pure functions do not rely on extra software environments such as a guest OS. Dandelion makes it practical to boot a sandbox on-demand for each request, decreasing performance variability by two to three orders of magnitude compared to Firecracker and reducing committed memory by 96% on average when running the Azure Functions trace.

### A Principle of Targeted Intervention for Multi-Agent Reinforcement   Learning
**Authors**: Anjie Liu, Jianhong Wang, Samuel Kaski, Jun Wang, Mengyue Yang

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T15:15:26Z

**Summary**: Steering cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) towards desired outcomes is challenging, particularly when the global guidance from a human on the whole multi-agent system is impractical in a large-scale MARL. On the other hand, designing external mechanisms (e.g., intrinsic rewards and human feedback) to coordinate agents mostly relies on empirical studies, lacking a easy-to-use research tool. In this work, we employ multi-agent influence diagrams (MAIDs) as a graphical framework to address the above issues. First, we introduce the concept of MARL interaction paradigms (orthogonal to MARL learning paradigms), using MAIDs to analyze and visualize both unguided self-organization and global guidance mechanisms in MARL. Then, we design a new MARL interaction paradigm, referred to as the targeted intervention paradigm that is applied to only a single targeted agent, so the problem of global guidance can be mitigated. In implementation, we introduce a causal inference technique, referred to as Pre-Strategy Intervention (PSI), to realize the targeted intervention paradigm. Since MAIDs can be regarded as a special class of causal diagrams, a composite desired outcome that integrates the primary task goal and an additional desired outcome can be achieved by maximizing the corresponding causal effect through the PSI. Moreover, the bundled relevance graph analysis of MAIDs provides a tool to identify whether an MARL learning paradigm is workable under the design of an MARL interaction paradigm. In experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed targeted intervention, and verify the result of relevance graph analysis.

### Neural variational inference for cutting feedback during uncertainty   propagation
**Authors**: Jiafang Song, Sandipan Pramanik, Abhirup Datta

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T15:13:18Z

**Summary**: In many scientific applications, uncertainty of estimates from an earlier (upstream) analysis needs to be propagated in subsequent (downstream) Bayesian analysis, without feedback. Cutting feedback methods, also termed cut-Bayes, achieve this by constructing a cut-posterior distribution that prevents backward information flow. Cutting feedback like nested MCMC is computationally challenging while variational inference (VI) cut-Bayes methods need two variational approximations and require access to the upstream data and model. In this manuscript we propose, NeVI-Cut, a provably accurate and modular neural network-based variational inference method for cutting feedback. We directly utilize samples from the upstream analysis without requiring access to the upstream data or model. This simultaneously preserves modularity of analysis and reduces approximation errors by avoiding a variational approximation for the upstream model. We then use normalizing flows to specify the conditional variational family for the downstream parameters and estimate the conditional cut-posterior as a variational solution of Monte Carlo average loss over all the upstream samples. We provide theoretical guarantees on the NeVI-Cut estimate to approximate any cut-posterior. Our results are in a fixed-data regime and provide convergence rates of the actual variational solution, quantifying how richness of the neural architecture and the complexity of the target cut-posterior dictate the approximation quality. In the process, we establish new results on uniform Kullback-Leibler approximation rates of conditional normalizing flows. Simulation studies and two real-world analyses illustrate how NeVI-Cut achieves significant computational gains over traditional cutting feedback methods and is considerably more accurate than parametric variational cut approaches.

### AutoStreamPipe: LLM Assisted Automatic Generation of Data Stream   Processing Pipelines
**Authors**: Abolfazl Younesi, Zahra Najafabadi Samani, Thomas Fahringer

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T15:11:31Z

**Summary**: Data pipelines are essential in stream processing as they enable the efficient collection, processing, and delivery of real-time data, supporting rapid data analysis. In this paper, we present AutoStreamPipe, a novel framework that employs Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the design, generation, and deployment of stream processing pipelines. AutoStreamPipe bridges the semantic gap between high-level user intent and platform-specific implementations across distributed stream processing systems for structured multi-agent reasoning by integrating a Hypergraph of Thoughts (HGoT) as an extended version of GoT. AutoStreamPipe combines resilient execution strategies, advanced query analysis, and HGoT to deliver pipelines with good accuracy. Experimental evaluations on diverse pipelines demonstrate that AutoStreamPipe significantly reduces development time (x6.3) and error rates (x5.19), as measured by a novel Error-Free Score (EFS), compared to LLM code-generation methods.

### Multi-Task Surrogate-Assisted Search with Bayesian Competitive Knowledge   Transfer for Expensive Optimization
**Authors**: Yi Lu, Xiaoming Xue, Kai Zhang, Liming Zhang, Guodong Chen, Chenming Cao, Piyang Liu, Kay Chen Tan

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T15:09:31Z

**Summary**: Expensive optimization problems (EOPs) present significant challenges for traditional evolutionary optimization due to their limited evaluation calls. Although surrogate-assisted search (SAS) has become a popular paradigm for addressing EOPs, it still suffers from the cold-start issue. In response to this challenge, knowledge transfer has been gaining popularity for its ability to leverage search experience from potentially related instances, ultimately facilitating head-start optimization for more efficient decision-making. However, the curse of negative transfer persists when applying knowledge transfer to EOPs, primarily due to the inherent limitations of existing methods in assessing knowledge transferability. On the one hand, a priori transferability assessment criteria are intrinsically inaccurate due to their imprecise understandings. On the other hand, a posteriori methods often necessitate sufficient observations to make correct inferences, rendering them inefficient when applied to EOPs. Considering the above, this paper introduces a Bayesian competitive knowledge transfer (BCKT) method developed to improve multi-task SAS (MSAS) when addressing multiple EOPs simultaneously. Specifically, the transferability of knowledge is estimated from a Bayesian perspective that accommodates both prior beliefs and empirical evidence, enabling accurate competition between inner-task and inter-task solutions, ultimately leading to the adaptive use of promising solutions while effectively suppressing inferior ones. The effectiveness of our method in boosting various SAS algorithms for both multi-task and many-task problems is empirically validated, complemented by comparative studies that demonstrate its superiority over peer algorithms and its applicability to real-world scenarios. The source code of our method is available at https://github.com/XmingHsueh/MSAS-BCKT.

### MIGHTEE-HI: The HI mass-stellar mass relation of massive galaxies and   the HI mass function at 0.25<z<0.5
**Authors**: Hengxing Pan, Matt J. Jarvis, Ian Heywood, Tariq Yasin, Natasha Maddox, Mario G. Santos, Maarten Baes, Anastasia A. Ponomareva, Sambatriniaina H. A. Rajohnson

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T15:09:09Z

**Summary**: The relationship between the already formed stellar mass in a galaxy and the gas reservoir of neutral atomic hydrogen, is a key element in our understanding of how gas is turned into stars in galaxy haloes. In this paper, we measure the $M_{\rm HI}-M_{\star}$ relation based on a stellar-mass selected sample at $0.25 < z < 0.5$ and the MIGHTEE-HI DR1 spectral data. Using a powerful Bayesian stacking technique, for the first time we are also able to measure the underlying bivariate distribution of HI mass and stellar mass of galaxies with $M_\star > 10^{9.5}$ M$_{\odot}$, finding that an asymmetric underlying HI distribution is strongly preferred by our complete samples. We define the concepts of the average of the logarithmic HI mass, $\langle\log_{10}(M_{\rm HI})\rangle$, and the logarithmic average of the HI mass, $\log_{10}(\langle M_{\rm HI}\rangle)$, and find that the difference between $\langle\log_{10}(M_{\rm HI})\rangle$ and $\log_{10}(\langle M_{\rm HI}\rangle)$ can be as large as $\sim$0.5 dex for the preferred asymmetric HI distribution. We observe shallow slopes in the underlying $M_{\rm HI}-M_{\star}$ scaling relations, suggesting the presence of an upper HI mass limit beyond which a galaxy can no longer retain further HI gas. From our bivariate distribution we also infer the HI mass function at this redshift and find tentative evidence for a decrease of 2-10 times in the co-moving space density of the most HI massive galaxies up to $z\sim 0.5$.

### The Complexity Trap: Simple Observation Masking Is as Efficient as LLM   Summarization for Agent Context Management
**Authors**: Tobias Lindenbauer, Igor Slinko, Ludwig Felder, Egor Bogomolov, Yaroslav Zharov

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T15:08:54Z

**Summary**: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents solve complex tasks through iterative reasoning, exploration, and tool-use, a process that can result in long, expensive context histories. While state-of-the-art Software Engineering (SE) agents like OpenHands or Cursor use LLM-based summarization to tackle this issue, it is unclear whether the increased complexity offers tangible performance benefits compared to simply omitting older observations. We present a systematic comparison of these approaches within SWE-agent on SWE-bench Verified across five diverse model configurations. Moreover, we show initial evidence of our findings generalizing to the OpenHands agent scaffold. We find that a simple environment observation masking strategy halves cost relative to the raw agent while matching, and sometimes slightly exceeding, the solve rate of LLM summarization. Additionally, we introduce a novel hybrid approach that further reduces costs by 7% and 11% compared to just observation masking or LLM summarization, respectively. Our findings raise concerns regarding the trend towards pure LLM summarization and provide initial evidence of untapped cost reductions by pushing the efficiency-effectiveness frontier. We release code and data for reproducibility.

### Observable Signatures of Quarkyonic Phase in Neutron Stars
**Authors**: Probit J Kalita, Tuhin Malik, Tianqi Zhao, Bharat Kumar, James M. Lattimer

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T15:08:36Z

**Summary**: In this letter, we perform Bayesian inference on quarkyonic equation-of-state models and find they remain viable under all current astrophysical constraints. Crucially, we identify a novel observational diagnostic: the slope of the M-R relation at fixed mass versus the central sound speed. Quarkyonic stars occupy a distinct region (high central $c_s^2$ and positive $\frac{dR}{dM}$) from purely nucleonic stars. This could be tested by future radius measurements of two stars of different mass. Our results indicate that if a neutron star falls in the quarkyonic region, it would be strong evidence for quarkyonic matter in its core.

### Interpretable Neural ODEs for Gene Regulatory Network Discovery under   Perturbations
**Authors**: Zaikang Lin, Sei Chang, Aaron Zweig, Minseo Kang, Elham Azizi, David A. Knowles

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T15:06:54Z

**Summary**: Modern high-throughput biological datasets with thousands of perturbations provide the opportunity for large-scale discovery of causal graphs that represent the regulatory interactions between genes. Differentiable causal graphical models have been proposed to infer a gene regulatory network (GRN) from large scale interventional datasets, capturing the causal gene regulatory relationships from genetic perturbations. However, existing models are limited in their expressivity and scalability while failing to address the dynamic nature of biological processes such as cellular differentiation. We propose PerturbODE, a novel framework that incorporates biologically informative neural ordinary differential equations (neural ODEs) to model cell state trajectories under perturbations and derive the causal GRN from the neural ODE's parameters. We demonstrate PerturbODE's efficacy in trajectory prediction and GRN inference across simulated and real over-expression datasets.

### A Data-driven ML Approach for Maximizing Performance in LLM-Adapter   Serving
**Authors**: Ferran Agullo, Joan Oliveras, Chen Wang, Alberto Gutierrez-Torre, Olivier Tardieu, Alaa Youssef, Jordi Torres, Josep Ll. Berral

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T14:59:46Z

**Summary**: With the rapid adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs), LLM-adapters have become increasingly common, providing lightweight specialization of large-scale models. Serving hundreds or thousands of these adapters on a single GPU allows request aggregation, increasing throughput, but may also cause request starvation if GPU memory limits are exceeded. To address this issue, this study focuses on determining the joint configuration of concurrent and parallel adapters that maximizes GPU throughput without inducing starvation, given heterogeneous adapter and traffic properties. We propose a data-driven ML approach leveraging interpretable models to tackle this caching problem and introduce the first Digital Twin capable of reproducing an LLM-adapter serving system, enabling efficient training data generation. Experiments with the vLLM framework and LoRA adapters show that the Digital Twin reproduces throughput within 5.1% of real results, while the ML approach predicts optimal numbers of concurrent and parallel adapters with an error of at most 7.2% under heterogeneous, real-world workloads.

### EMTSF:Extraordinary Mixture of SOTA Models for Time Series Forecasting
**Authors**: Musleh Alharthi, Kaleel Mahmood, Sarosh Patel, Ausif Mahmood

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T14:55:30Z

**Summary**: The immense success of the Transformer architecture   in Natural Language Processing has led to its adoption in Time Se ries Forecasting (TSF), where superior performance has been shown.   However, a recent important paper questioned their effectiveness by   demonstrating that a simple single layer linear model outperforms   Transformer-based models. This was soon shown to be not as valid,   by a better transformer-based model termed PatchTST. More re cently, TimeLLM demonstrated even better results by repurposing a   Large Language Model (LLM) for the TSF domain. Again, a follow   up paper challenged this by demonstrating that removing the LLM   component or replacing it with a basic attention layer in fact yields   better performance. One of the challenges in forecasting is the fact   that TSF data favors the more recent past, and is sometimes subject   to unpredictable events. Based upon these recent insights in TSF, we   propose a strong Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework. Our method   combines the state-of-the-art (SOTA) models including xLSTM, en hanced Linear, PatchTST, and minGRU, among others. This set of   complimentary and diverse models for TSF are integrated in a Trans former based MoE gating network. Our proposed model outperforms   all existing TSF models on standard benchmarks, surpassing even the   latest approaches based on MoE frameworks.

### Detecting Religious Language in Climate Discourse
**Authors**: Evy Beijen, Pien Pieterse, Yusuf Çelik, Willem Th. van Peursen, Sandjai Bhulai, Meike Morren

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T14:54:51Z

**Summary**: Religious language continues to permeate contemporary discourse, even in ostensibly secular domains such as environmental activism and climate change debates. This paper investigates how explicit and implicit forms of religious language appear in climate-related texts produced by secular and religious nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). We introduce a dual methodological approach: a rule-based model using a hierarchical tree of religious terms derived from ecotheology literature, and large language models (LLMs) operating in a zero-shot setting. Using a dataset of more than 880,000 sentences, we compare how these methods detect religious language and analyze points of agreement and divergence. The results show that the rule-based method consistently labels more sentences as religious than LLMs. These findings highlight not only the methodological challenges of computationally detecting religious language but also the broader tension over whether religious language should be defined by vocabulary alone or by contextual meaning. This study contributes to digital methods in religious studies by demonstrating both the potential and the limitations of approaches for analyzing how the sacred persists in climate discourse.

### The Best of N Worlds: Aligning Reinforcement Learning with Best-of-N   Sampling via max@k Optimisation
**Authors**: Farid Bagirov, Mikhail Arkhipov, Ksenia Sycheva, Evgeniy Glukhov, Egor Bogomolov

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T14:47:30Z

**Summary**: The application of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to mathematical and coding domains has demonstrated significant improvements in the reasoning and problem-solving abilities of Large Language Models. Despite its success in single generation problem solving, the reinforcement learning fine-tuning process may harm the model's exploration ability, as reflected in decreased diversity of generations and a resulting degradation of performance during Best-of-N sampling for large N values. In this work, we focus on optimizing the max@k metric, a continuous generalization of pass@k. We derive an unbiased on-policy gradient estimate for direct optimization of this metric. Furthermore, we extend our derivations to the off-policy updates, a common element in modern RLVR algorithms, that allows better sample efficiency. Empirically, we show that our objective effectively optimizes max@k metric in off-policy scenarios, aligning the model with the Best-of-N inference strategy.

### Steering Evaluation-Aware Language Models to Act Like They Are Deployed
**Authors**: Tim Tian Hua, Andrew Qin, Samuel Marks, Neel Nanda

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T14:43:39Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) can sometimes detect when they are being evaluated and adjust their behavior to appear more aligned, compromising the reliability of safety evaluations. In this paper, we show that adding a steering vector to an LLM's activations can suppress evaluation-awareness and make the model act like it is deployed during evaluation. To study our steering technique, we train an LLM to exhibit evaluation-aware behavior using a two-step training process designed to mimic how this behavior could emerge naturally. First, we perform continued pretraining on documents with factual descriptions of the model (1) using Python type hints during evaluation but not during deployment and (2) recognizing that the presence of a certain evaluation cue always means that it is being tested. Then, we train the model with expert iteration to use Python type hints in evaluation settings. The resulting model is evaluation-aware: it writes type hints in evaluation contexts more than deployment contexts. We find that activation steering can suppress evaluation awareness and make the model act like it is deployed even when the cue is present. Importantly, we constructed our steering vector using the original model before our additional training. Our results suggest that AI evaluators could improve the reliability of safety evaluations by steering models to act like they are deployed.

### Estimating LLM Consistency: A User Baseline vs Surrogate Metrics
**Authors**: Xiaoyuan Wu, Weiran Lin, Omer Akgul, Lujo Bauer

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T14:42:01Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are prone to hallucinations and sensitiveto prompt perturbations, often resulting in inconsistent or unreliablegenerated text. Different methods have been proposed to mitigate suchhallucinations and fragility, one of which is to measure theconsistency of LLM responses -- the model's confidence in the responseor likelihood of generating a similar response when resampled. Inprevious work, measuring LLM response consistency often relied oncalculating the probability of a response appearing within a pool of resampledresponses, analyzing internal states, or evaluating logits of resopnses.However, it was not clear how well theseapproaches approximated users' perceptions of consistency of LLMresponses. To find out, we performed a user study ($n=2,976$)demonstrating that current methods for measuring LLM responseconsistency typically do not align well with humans' perceptions of LLMconsistency. We propose a logit-based ensemble method for estimatingLLM consistency and show that our method matches the performance of thebest-performing existing metric in estimating human ratings of LLMconsistency. Our results suggest that methods for estimating LLMconsistency without human evaluation are sufficiently imperfect towarrant broader use of evaluation with human input; this would avoidmisjudging the adequacy of models because of the imperfections ofautomated consistency metrics.

### NestedFP: High-Performance, Memory-Efficient Dual-Precision Floating   Point Support for LLMs
**Authors**: Haeun Lee, Omin Kwon, Yeonhong Park, Jae W. Lee

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T14:40:22Z

**Summary**: Meeting service-level objectives (SLOs) in Large Language Models (LLMs) serving is critical, but managing the high variability in load presents a significant challenge. Recent advancements in FP8 inference, backed by native hardware support, offer a potential solution: executing FP16 models by default, while switching to FP8 models during sudden load surges to achieve higher throughput at the cost of a slight quality degradation. Although this approach facilitates effective SLO management, it introduces additional memory overhead due to storing two versions of the same model. In response, this paper proposes NestedFP, an LLM serving technique that supports both FP16 and FP8 models in a memory efficient manner by overlaying FP8 parameters onto FP16 parameters, allowing both models to share the same FP16 memory footprint. By leveraging a compact data format for the overlay and a specialized GEMM kernel optimized for this format, NestedFP ensures minimal degradation in both model quality and inference throughput across both FP8 and FP16 modes. NestedFP provides a flexible platform for dynamic, SLO-aware precision selection. The code is available at https://github.com/SNU-ARC/NestedFP.

### Can Large Language Models Unlock Novel Scientific Research Ideas?
**Authors**: Sandeep Kumar, Tirthankar Ghosal, Vinayak Goyal, Asif Ekbal

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T14:39:52Z

**Summary**: The widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) and publicly available ChatGPT have marked a significant turning point in the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into people's everyday lives. This study examines the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate future research ideas from scientific papers. Unlike tasks such as summarization or translation, idea generation lacks a clearly defined reference set or structure, making manual evaluation the default standard. However, human evaluation in this setting is extremely challenging ie: it requires substantial domain expertise, contextual understanding of the paper, and awareness of the current research landscape. This makes it time-consuming, costly, and fundamentally non-scalable, particularly as new LLMs are being released at a rapid pace. Currently, there is no automated evaluation metric specifically designed for this task. To address this gap, we propose two automated evaluation metrics: Idea Alignment Score (IAScore) and Idea Distinctness Index. We further conducted human evaluation to assess the novelty, relevance, and feasibility of the generated future research ideas. This investigation offers insights into the evolving role of LLMs in idea generation, highlighting both its capability and limitations. Our work contributes to the ongoing efforts in evaluating and utilizing language models for generating future research ideas. We make our datasets and codes publicly available

### One-Timestep is Enough: Achieving High-performance ANN-to-SNN Conversion   via Scale-and-Fire Neurons
**Authors**: Qiuyang Chen, Huiqi Yang, Qingyan Meng, Zhengyu Ma

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T14:35:14Z

**Summary**: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are gaining attention as energy-efficient alternatives to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), especially in resource-constrained settings. While ANN-to-SNN conversion (ANN2SNN) achieves high accuracy without end-to-end SNN training, existing methods rely on large time steps, leading to high inference latency and computational cost. In this paper, we propose a theoretical and practical framework for single-timestep ANN2SNN. We establish the Temporal-to-Spatial Equivalence Theory, proving that multi-timestep integrate-and-fire (IF) neurons can be equivalently replaced by single-timestep multi-threshold neurons (MTN). Based on this theory, we introduce the Scale-and-Fire Neuron (SFN), which enables effective single-timestep ($T=1$) spiking through adaptive scaling and firing. Furthermore, we develop the SFN-based Spiking Transformer (SFormer), a specialized instantiation of SFN within Transformer architectures, where spike patterns are aligned with attention distributions to mitigate the computational, energy, and hardware overhead of the multi-threshold design. Extensive experiments on image classification, object detection, and instance segmentation demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance under single-timestep inference. Notably, we achieve 88.8% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K at $T=1$, surpassing existing conversion methods.

### An Efficient Remote Sensing Super Resolution Method Exploring Diffusion   Priors and Multi-Modal Constraints for Crop Type Mapping
**Authors**: Songxi Yang, Tang Sui, Qunying Huang

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T14:34:52Z

**Summary**: Super resolution offers a way to harness medium even lowresolution but historically valuable remote sensing image archives. Generative models, especially diffusion models, have recently been applied to remote sensing super resolution (RSSR), yet several challenges exist. First, diffusion models are effective but require expensive training from scratch resources and have slow inference speeds. Second, current methods have limited utilization of auxiliary information as real-world constraints to reconstruct scientifically realistic images. Finally, most current methods lack evaluation on downstream tasks. In this study, we present a efficient LSSR framework for RSSR, supported by a new multimodal dataset of paired 30 m Landsat 8 and 10 m Sentinel 2 imagery. Built on frozen pretrained Stable Diffusion, LSSR integrates crossmodal attention with auxiliary knowledge (Digital Elevation Model, land cover, month) and Synthetic Aperture Radar guidance, enhanced by adapters and a tailored Fourier NDVI loss to balance spatial details and spectral fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LSSR significantly improves crop boundary delineation and recovery, achieving state-of-the-art performance with Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio/Structural Similarity Index Measure of 32.63/0.84 (RGB) and 23.99/0.78 (IR), and the lowest NDVI Mean Squared Error (0.042), while maintaining efficient inference (0.39 sec/image). Moreover, LSSR transfers effectively to NASA Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel (HLS) super resolution, yielding more reliable crop classification (F1: 0.86) than Sentinel-2 (F1: 0.85). These results highlight the potential of RSSR to advance precision agriculture.

### Symbolic Neural Generation with Applications to Lead Discovery in Drug   Design
**Authors**: Ashwin Srinivasan, A Baskar, Tirtharaj Dash, Michael Bain, Sanjay Kumar Dey, Mainak Banerjee

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T14:29:22Z

**Summary**: We investigate a relatively underexplored class of hybrid neurosymbolic models integrating symbolic learning with neural reasoning to construct data generators meeting formal correctness criteria. In \textit{Symbolic Neural Generators} (SNGs), symbolic learners examine logical specifications of feasible data from a small set of instances -- sometimes just one. Each specification in turn constrains the conditional information supplied to a neural-based generator, which rejects any instance violating the symbolic specification. Like other neurosymbolic approaches, SNG exploits the complementary strengths of symbolic and neural methods. The outcome of an SNG is a triple $(H, X, W)$, where $H$ is a symbolic description of feasible instances constructed from data, $X$ a set of generated new instances that satisfy the description, and $W$ an associated weight. We introduce a semantics for such systems, based on the construction of appropriate \textit{base} and \textit{fibre} partially-ordered sets combined into an overall partial order, and outline a probabilistic extension relevant to practical applications. In this extension, SNGs result from searching over a weighted partial ordering. We implement an SNG combining a restricted form of Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) with a large language model (LLM) and evaluate it on early-stage drug design. Our main interest is the description and the set of potential inhibitor molecules generated by the SNG. On benchmark problems -- where drug targets are well understood -- SNG performance is statistically comparable to state-of-the-art methods. On exploratory problems with poorly understood targets, generated molecules exhibit binding affinities on par with leading clinical candidates. Experts further find the symbolic specifications useful as preliminary filters, with several generated molecules identified as viable for synthesis and wet-lab testing.

### Reasoning as an Adaptive Defense for Safety
**Authors**: Taeyoun Kim, Fahim Tajwar, Aditi Raghunathan, Aviral Kumar

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T14:28:11Z

**Summary**: Reasoning methods that adaptively allocate test-time compute have advanced LLM performance on easy to verify domains such as math and code. In this work, we study how to utilize this approach to train models that exhibit a degree of robustness to safety vulnerabilities, and show that doing so can provide benefits. We build a recipe called $\textit{TARS}$ (Training Adaptive Reasoners for Safety), a reinforcement learning (RL) approach that trains models to reason about safety using chain-of-thought traces and a reward signal that balances safety with task completion. To build TARS, we identify three critical design choices: (1) a ``lightweight'' warmstart SFT stage, (2) a mix of harmful, harmless, and ambiguous prompts to prevent shortcut behaviors such as too many refusals, and (3) a reward function to prevent degeneration of reasoning capabilities during training. Models trained with TARS exhibit adaptive behaviors by spending more compute on ambiguous queries, leading to better safety-refusal trade-offs. They also internally learn to better distinguish between safe and unsafe prompts and attain greater robustness to both white-box (e.g., GCG) and black-box attacks (e.g., PAIR). Overall, our work provides an effective, open recipe for training LLMs against jailbreaks and harmful requests by reasoning per prompt.

### Are LLMs Empathetic to All? Investigating the Influence of   Multi-Demographic Personas on a Model's Empathy
**Authors**: Ananya Malik, Nazanin Sabri, Melissa Karnaze, Mai Elsherief

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T14:25:32Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models' (LLMs) ability to converse naturally is empowered by their ability to empathetically understand and respond to their users. However, emotional experiences are shaped by demographic and cultural contexts. This raises an important question: Can LLMs demonstrate equitable empathy across diverse user groups? We propose a framework to investigate how LLMs' cognitive and affective empathy vary across user personas defined by intersecting demographic attributes. Our study introduces a novel intersectional analysis spanning 315 unique personas, constructed from combinations of age, culture, and gender, across four LLMs. Results show that attributes profoundly shape a model's empathetic responses. Interestingly, we see that adding multiple attributes at once can attenuate and reverse expected empathy patterns. We show that they broadly reflect real-world empathetic trends, with notable misalignments for certain groups, such as those from Confucian culture. We complement our quantitative findings with qualitative insights to uncover model behaviour patterns across different demographic groups. Our findings highlight the importance of designing empathy-aware LLMs that account for demographic diversity to promote more inclusive and equitable model behaviour.

### The MiMO Catalog: Physical Parameters and Stellar Mass Functions of   1,232 Open Clusters from Gaia DR3
**Authors**: Lu Li, Zhengyi Shao, Zhaozhou Li, Xiaoting Fu

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T14:22:50Z

**Summary**: We present a homogeneous catalog of 1,232 open clusters with precisely determined ages, metallicities, distances, extinctions, and stellar mass function (MF) slopes, derived from Gaia DR3 data. The parameters are inferred using the Mixture Model for Open clusters (MiMO), a novel Bayesian framework for modeling clusters in the color-magnitude diagram. By explicitly accounting for field-star contamination as a model component, MiMO removes the conventional need for stringent membership preselection, allowing for a more complete inclusion of member stars and thereby enhancing both precision and robustness. Our results broadly agree with existing catalogs but offer improved precision. For each cluster, we provide the best-fit age, metallicity, distance, extinction, and MF slope, along with their full likelihood chains and photometric membership probabilities for individual stars. We further identify an ``MF Prime'' subsample of 163 clusters with high-quality data, for which the MF estimates are considered most reliable. The catalog and an open-source implementation of MiMO are made publicly available to the community.

### Tiny but Mighty: A Software-Hardware Co-Design Approach for Efficient   Multimodal Inference on Battery-Powered Small Devices
**Authors**: Yilong Li, Shuai Zhang, Yijing Zeng, Hao Zhang, Xinmiao Xiong, Jingyu Liu, Pan Hu, Suman Banerjee

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T14:17:43Z

**Summary**: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) are inherently modular, consisting of vision and audio encoders, projectors, and large language models. Yet, they are almost always executed monolithically, which underutilizes the heterogeneous accelerators (NPUs, GPUs, DSPs) in modern SoCs and leads to high end-to-end latency. In this paper, we present NANOMIND, a hardware--software co-design inference framework for Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) that breaks large models into modular ``bricks'' (vision, language, audio, etc.) and maps each to its ideal accelerator. The key insight is that large models can be broken into modular components and scheduled to run on the most appropriate compute units. It performs module-level dynamic offloading across accelerators on unified-memory SoCs. By combining customized hardware design, system-level scheduling, and optimized low-bit computation kernels, we demonstrate our framework with a compact, battery-powered device capable of running LMMs entirely on device. This prototype functions as a self-contained intelligent assistant that requires no network connectivity, while achieving higher throughput and superior power efficiency under strict resource constraints. The design further bypasses CPU bottlenecks and reduces redundant memory usage through token-aware buffer management and module-level coordination. Our system outperforms existing implementations in resource efficiency, cutting energy consumption by 42.3\% and GPU memory usage by 11.2\%. This enables a battery-powered device to run LLaVA-OneVision with a camera for nearly half a day and LLaMA-3-8B for voice interactions up to almost 20.8 hours.

### SimBench: Benchmarking the Ability of Large Language Models to Simulate   Human Behaviors
**Authors**: Tiancheng Hu, Joachim Baumann, Lorenzo Lupo, Nigel Collier, Dirk Hovy, Paul Röttger

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T14:17:13Z

**Summary**: Large language model (LLM) simulations of human behavior have the potential to revolutionize the social and behavioral sciences, if and only if they faithfully reflect real human behaviors. Current evaluations are fragmented, based on bespoke tasks and metrics, creating a patchwork of incomparable results. To address this, we introduce SimBench, the first large-scale, standardized benchmark for a robust, reproducible science of LLM simulation. By unifying 20 diverse datasets covering tasks from moral decision-making to economic choice across a large global participant pool, SimBench provides the necessary foundation to ask fundamental questions about when, how, and why LLM simulations succeed or fail. We show that, while even the best LLMs today have limited simulation ability (score: 40.80/100), performance scales log-linearly with model size. Simulation performance is not improved by increased inference-time compute. We demonstrate an alignment-simulation trade-off: instruction-tuning improves performance on low-entropy (consensus) questions but degrades it on high-entropy (diverse) ones. Models particularly struggle when simulating specific demographic groups. Finally, we demonstrate that simulation ability correlates most strongly with deep, knowledge-intensive reasoning (MMLU-Pro, r=0.939). By making progress measurable, we aim to accelerate the development of more faithful LLM simulators.

### From Rare Events to a Population: Discovering Overlooked Extragalactic   Magnetar Giant Flare Candidates in Archival Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor   Data
**Authors**: Aaron C. Trigg, Eric Burns, Michela Negro, Suman Bala, P. N. Bhat, William H. Cleveland, Dmitry D. Frederiks, Adam Goldstein, Boyan A. Hristov, Daniel Kocevski, Niccolò Di Lalla, Stephen Lesage, Bagrat Mailyan, Eliza Neights, Nicola Omodei, Oliver J. Roberts, Lorenzo Scotton, Dmitry S. Svinkin, Joshua Wood

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T14:17:12Z

**Summary**: Magnetar giant flares (MGFs) are rare, extremely bright bursts of gamma-rays from highly magnetized neutron stars. These events are challenging to identify because, at extragalactic distances, they can appear similar to other astrophysical phenomena. Only a handful have been confidently identified to date, limiting our understanding of their origin and physical properties. This study focuses on expanding the sample of known events and enabling a more detailed characterization of their observational features and intrinsic properties, while introducing significant improvements in the methods used to identify and analyze them. When applied to archival data from the Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) on the \Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, this approach added four previously unidentified events the known sample, expanding the total to 13 MGFs. This demonstrates both the effectiveness of the method and the likelihood that additional MGFs remain hidden in existing gamma-ray burst catalogs. We utilize this expanded sample to gain a deeper understanding of the broader population of MGFs. We develop a statistical modeling framework that combines previously considered data with modern observations from Fermi/GBM. The model accounts for instrumental sensitivity and the expected diversity in event characteristics. We infer a volumetric rate of events above $1.2\times10^{44}\,\rm{erg}$ of $R_{MGF}=5.5^{+4.5}_{-2.7}\times10^5\rm{Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}}$. The results show that individual magnetars must produce multiple flares throughout their lifetimes, reinforcing the idea that these are recurring phenomena rather than singular explosive events. Expanding the sample of known MGFs improves our understanding of magnetars and their role in other astrophysical phenomena, including possible links to fast radio bursts, gravitational waves, and the creation of heavy elements in extreme astrophysical environments.

### MOOSE-Chem: Large Language Models for Rediscovering Unseen Chemistry   Scientific Hypotheses
**Authors**: Zonglin Yang, Wanhao Liu, Ben Gao, Tong Xie, Yuqiang Li, Wanli Ouyang, Soujanya Poria, Erik Cambria, Dongzhan Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T14:10:54Z

**Summary**: Scientific discovery plays a pivotal role in advancing human society, and recent progress in large language models (LLMs) suggests their potential to accelerate this process. However, it remains unclear whether LLMs can autonomously generate novel and valid hypotheses in chemistry. In this work, we investigate whether LLMs can discover high-quality chemistry hypotheses given only a research background-comprising a question and/or a survey-without restriction on the domain of the question. We begin with the observation that hypothesis discovery is a seemingly intractable task. To address this, we propose a formal mathematical decomposition grounded in a fundamental assumption: that most chemistry hypotheses can be composed from a research background and a set of inspirations. This decomposition leads to three practical subtasks-retrieving inspirations, composing hypotheses with inspirations, and ranking hypotheses - which together constitute a sufficient set of subtasks for the overall scientific discovery task. We further develop an agentic LLM framework, MOOSE-Chem, that is a direct implementation of this mathematical decomposition. To evaluate this framework, we construct a benchmark of 51 high-impact chemistry papers published and online after January 2024, each manually annotated by PhD chemists with background, inspirations, and hypothesis. The framework is able to rediscover many hypotheses with high similarity to the groundtruth, successfully capturing the core innovations-while ensuring no data contamination since it uses an LLM with knowledge cutoff date prior to 2024. Finally, based on LLM's surprisingly high accuracy on inspiration retrieval, a task with inherently out-of-distribution nature, we propose a bold assumption: that LLMs may already encode latent scientific knowledge associations not yet recognized by humans.

### How AI Forecasts AI Jobs: Benchmarking LLM Predictions of Labor Market   Changes
**Authors**: Sheri Osborn, Rohit Valecha, H. Raghav Rao, Dan Sass, Anthony Rios

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T14:08:27Z

**Summary**: Artificial intelligence is reshaping labor markets, yet we lack tools to systematically forecast its effects on employment. This paper introduces a benchmark for evaluating how well large language models (LLMs) can anticipate changes in job demand, especially in occupations affected by AI. Existing research has shown that LLMs can extract sentiment, summarize economic reports, and emulate forecaster behavior, but little work has assessed their use for forward-looking labor prediction. Our benchmark combines two complementary datasets: a high-frequency index of sector-level job postings in the United States, and a global dataset of projected occupational changes due to AI adoption. We format these data into forecasting tasks with clear temporal splits, minimizing the risk of information leakage. We then evaluate LLMs using multiple prompting strategies, comparing task-scaffolded, persona-driven, and hybrid approaches across model families. We assess both quantitative accuracy and qualitative consistency over time. Results show that structured task prompts consistently improve forecast stability, while persona prompts offer advantages on short-term trends. However, performance varies significantly across sectors and horizons, highlighting the need for domain-aware prompting and rigorous evaluation protocols. By releasing our benchmark, we aim to support future research on labor forecasting, prompt design, and LLM-based economic reasoning. This work contributes to a growing body of research on how LLMs interact with real-world economic data, and provides a reproducible testbed for studying the limits and opportunities of AI as a forecasting tool in the context of labor markets.

### Prompting is not Enough: Exploring Knowledge Integration and   Controllable Generation
**Authors**: Tingjia Shen, Hao Wang, Chuan Qin, Ruijun Sun, Yang Song, Defu Lian, Hengshu Zhu, Enhong Chen

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T14:08:24Z

**Summary**: Open-domain question answering (OpenQA) represents a cornerstone in natural language processing (NLP), primarily focused on extracting answers from unstructured textual data. With the rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), LLM-based OpenQA methods have reaped the benefits of emergent understanding and answering capabilities enabled by massive parameters compared to traditional methods. However, most of these methods encounter two critical challenges: how to integrate knowledge into LLMs effectively and how to adaptively generate results with specific answer formats for various task situations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework named GenKI, which aims to improve the OpenQA performance by exploring Knowledge Integration and controllable Generation on LLMs simultaneously. Specifically, we first train a dense passage retrieval model to retrieve associated knowledge from a given knowledge base. Subsequently, we introduce a novel knowledge integration model that incorporates the retrieval knowledge into instructions during fine-tuning to intensify the model. Furthermore, to enable controllable generation in LLMs, we leverage a certain fine-tuned LLM and an ensemble based on text consistency incorporating all coherence, fluency, and answer format assurance. Finally, extensive experiments conducted on the TriviaQA, MSMARCO, and CMRC2018 datasets, featuring diverse answer formats, have demonstrated the effectiveness of GenKI with comparison of state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, ablation studies have disclosed a linear relationship between the frequency of retrieved knowledge and the model's ability to recall knowledge accurately against the ground truth. Our code of GenKI is available at https://github.com/USTC-StarTeam/GenKI

**Authors**: Shaohan Bian, Ying Zhang, Guohui Tian, Zhiqiang Miao, Edmond Q. Wu, Simon X. Yang, Changchun Hua

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T14:06:40Z

**Summary**: With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) and robotics, service robots are increasingly becoming an integral part of daily life, offering a wide range of services in complex environments. To deliver these services intelligently and efficiently, robust and accurate task planning capabilities are essential. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of the integration of LLMs into service robotics, with a particular focus on their role in enhancing robotic task planning. First, the development and foundational techniques of LLMs, including pre-training, fine-tuning, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and prompt engineering, are reviewed. We then explore the application of LLMs as the cognitive core-`brain'-of service robots, discussing how LLMs contribute to improved autonomy and decision-making. Furthermore, recent advancements in LLM-driven task planning across various input modalities are analyzed, including text, visual, audio, and multimodal inputs. Finally, we summarize key challenges and limitations in current research and propose future directions to advance the task planning capabilities of service robots in complex, unstructured domestic environments. This review aims to serve as a valuable reference for researchers and practitioners in the fields of artificial intelligence and robotics.

### Validating Formal Specifications with LLM-generated Test Cases
**Authors**: Alcino Cunha, Nuno Macedo

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T14:02:20Z

**Summary**: Validation is a central activity when developing formal specifications. Similarly to coding, a possible validation technique is to define upfront test cases or scenarios that a future specification should satisfy or not. Unfortunately, specifying such test cases is burdensome and error prone, which could cause users to skip this validation task. This paper reports the results of an empirical evaluation of using pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to automate the generation of test cases from natural language requirements. In particular, we focus on test cases for structural requirements of simple domain models formalized in the Alloy specification language. Our evaluation focuses on the state-of-art GPT-5 model, but results from other closed- and open-source LLMs are also reported. The results show that, in this context, GPT-5 is already quite effective at generating positive (and negative) test cases that are syntactically correct and that satisfy (or not) the given requirement, and that can detect many wrong specifications written by humans.

### Block-Diagonal LoRA for Eliminating Communication Overhead in Tensor   Parallel LoRA Serving
**Authors**: Xinyu Wang, Jonas M. Kübler, Kailash Budhathoki, Yida Wang, Matthäus Kleindessner

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T14:01:29Z

**Summary**: When serving a single base LLM with several different LoRA adapters simultaneously, the adapters cannot simply be merged with the base model's weights as the adapter swapping would create overhead and requests using different adapters could not be batched. Rather, the LoRA computations have to be separated from the base LLM computations, and in a multi-device setup the LoRA adapters can be sharded in a way that is well aligned with the base model's tensor parallel execution, as proposed in S-LoRA. However, the S-LoRA sharding strategy encounters some communication overhead, which may be small in theory, but can be large in practice. In this paper, we propose to constrain certain LoRA factors to be block-diagonal, which allows for an alternative way of sharding LoRA adapters that does not require any additional communication for the LoRA computations. We demonstrate in extensive experiments that our block-diagonal LoRA approach is similarly parameter efficient as standard LoRA (i.e., for a similar number of parameters it achieves similar downstream performance) and that it leads to significant end-to-end speed-up over S-LoRA. For example, when serving on eight A100 GPUs, we observe up to 1.79x (1.23x) end-to-end speed-up with 0.87x (1.74x) the number of adapter parameters for Llama-3.1-70B, and up to 1.63x (1.3x) end-to-end speed-up with 0.86x (1.73x) the number of adapter parameters for Llama-3.1-8B.

### TrajAgent: An LLM-Agent Framework for Trajectory Modeling via   Large-and-Small Model Collaboration
**Authors**: Yuwei Du, Jie Feng, Jie Zhao, Yong Li

**Updated**: 2025-10-28T04:18:04Z

**Summary**: Trajectory modeling, which includes research on trajectory data pattern mining and future prediction, has widespread applications in areas such as life services, urban transportation, and public administration. Numerous methods have been proposed to address specific problems within trajectory modeling. However, the heterogeneity of data and the diversity of trajectory tasks make effective and reliable trajectory modeling an important yet highly challenging endeavor, even for domain experts. In this paper, we propose TrajAgent, an agent framework powered by large language models, designed to facilitate robust and efficient trajectory modeling through automation modeling. This framework leverages and optimizes diverse specialized models to address various trajectory modeling tasks across different datasets effectively. In TrajAgent, we first develop UniEnv, an execution environment with a unified data and model interface, to support the execution and training of various models. Building on UniEnv, we introduce an agentic workflow designed for automatic trajectory modeling across various trajectory tasks and data. Furthermore, we introduce collaborative learning schema between LLM-based agents and small speciallized models, to enhance the performance of the whole framework effectively. Extensive experiments on five tasks using four real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of TrajAgent in automated trajectory modeling, achieving a performance improvement of 2.38%-69.91% over baseline methods. The codes and data can be accessed via https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/TrajAgent.

### LightKGG: Simple and Efficient Knowledge Graph Generation from Textual   Data
**Authors**: Teng Lin

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T13:55:13Z

**Summary**: The scarcity of high-quality knowledge graphs (KGs) remains a critical bottleneck for downstream AI applications, as existing extraction methods rely heavily on error-prone pattern-matching techniques or resource-intensive large language models (LLMs). While recent tools leverage LLMs to generate KGs, their computational demands limit accessibility for low-resource environments. Our paper introduces LightKGG, a novel framework that enables efficient KG extraction from textual data using small-scale language models (SLMs) through two key technical innovations: (1) Context-integrated Graph extraction integrates contextual information with nodes and edges into a unified graph structure, reducing the reliance on complex semantic processing while maintaining more key information; (2) Topology-enhanced relationship inference leverages the inherent topology of the extracted graph to efficiently infer relationships, enabling relationship discovery without relying on complex language understanding capabilities of LLMs. By enabling accurate KG construction with minimal hardware requirements, this work bridges the gap between automated knowledge extraction and practical deployment scenarios while introducing scientifically rigorous methods for optimizing SLM efficiency in structured NLP tasks.

### LLMs can hide text in other text of the same length
**Authors**: Antonio Norelli, Michael Bronstein

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T13:54:40Z

**Summary**: A meaningful text can be hidden inside another, completely different yet still coherent and plausible, text of the same length. For example, a tweet containing a harsh political critique could be embedded in a tweet that celebrates the same political leader, or an ordinary product review could conceal a secret manuscript. This uncanny state of affairs is now possible thanks to Large Language Models, and in this paper we present a simple and efficient protocol to achieve it. We show that even modest 8-billion-parameter open-source LLMs are sufficient to obtain high-quality results, and a message as long as this abstract can be encoded and decoded locally on a laptop in seconds. The existence of such a protocol demonstrates a radical decoupling of text from authorial intent, further eroding trust in written communication, already shaken by the rise of LLM chatbots. We illustrate this with a concrete scenario: a company could covertly deploy an unfiltered LLM by encoding its answers within the compliant responses of a safe model. This possibility raises urgent questions for AI safety and challenges our understanding of what it means for a Large Language Model to know something.

### BaZi-Based Character Simulation Benchmark: Evaluating AI on Temporal and   Persona Reasoning
**Authors**: Siyuan Zheng, Pai Liu, Xi Chen, Jizheng Dong, Sihan Jia

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T13:51:13Z

**Summary**: Human-like virtual characters are crucial for games, storytelling, and virtual reality, yet current methods rely heavily on annotated data or handcrafted persona prompts, making it difficult to scale up and generate realistic, contextually coherent personas. We create the first QA dataset for BaZi-based persona reasoning, where real human experiences categorized into wealth, health, kinship, career, and relationships are represented as life-event questions and answers. Furthermore, we propose the first BaZi-LLM system that integrates symbolic reasoning with large language models to generate temporally dynamic and fine-grained virtual personas. Compared with mainstream LLMs such as DeepSeek-v3 and GPT-5-mini, our method achieves a 30.3%-62.6% accuracy improvement. In addition, when incorrect BaZi information is used, our model's accuracy drops by 20%-45%, showing the potential of culturally grounded symbolic-LLM integration for realistic character simulation.

### Adaptive Blockwise Search: Inference-Time Alignment for Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Mohammad Atif Quamar, Mohammad Areeb, Nishant Sharma, Ananth Shreekumar, Jonathan Rosenthal, Muslum Ozgur Ozmen, Mikhail Kuznetsov, Z. Berkay Celik

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T13:48:59Z

**Summary**: LLM alignment remains a critical challenge. Inference-time methods provide a flexible alternative to fine-tuning, but their uniform computational effort often yields suboptimal alignment. We hypothesize that for many alignment tasks, the initial tokens of a response are disproportionately more critical. To leverage this principle, we introduce AdaSearch, a novel blockwise search strategy. It adaptively allocates a fixed computational budget using a sampling schedule, focusing search effort on these critical tokens. We apply AdaSearch to sequential decoding and introduce its tree-search counterpart, AdaBeam. Our comprehensive evaluation across eight LLMs demonstrates that AdaSearch outperforms strong Best-of-N and fine-tuning baselines. Specifically, win-rates improve by over 10% for harmlessness generation, controlled sentiment generation, and for mathematical reasoning tasks relative to Best-of-N.

### Nonparametric Bayesian Multi-Treatment Mixture Cure Survival Model with   Application in Pediatric Oncology
**Authors**: Peter Chang, John Kairalla, Arkaprava Roy

**Updated**: 2025-10-28T02:31:05Z

**Summary**: Heterogeneous treatment effect estimation is critical in oncology, particularly in multi-arm trials with overlapping therapeutic components and long-term survivors. These shared mechanisms pose a central challenge to identifying causal effects in precision medicine. We propose a novel covariate-dependent nonparametric Bayesian multi-treatment cure survival model that jointly accounts for common structures among treatments and cure fractions. Through latent link functions, our model leverages sharing among treatments through a flexible modeling approach, enabling individualized survival inference. We adopt a Bayesian route for inference and implement an efficient MCMC algorithm for approximating the posterior. Simulation studies demonstrate the method's robustness and superiority in various specification scenarios. Finally, application to the AALL0434 trial reveals clinically meaningful differences in survival across methotrexate-based regimens and their associations with different covariates, underscoring its practical utility for learning treatment effects in real-world pediatric oncology data.

### Method: Using generalized additive models in the livestock animal   sciences
**Authors**: Gavin L. Simpson

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T13:47:52Z

**Summary**: Nonlinear relationships between covariates and a response variable of interest are frequently encountered in animal science research. Within statistical models, these nonlinear effects have, traditionally, been handled using a range of approaches including transformation of the response, parametric nonlinear models based on theory or phenomenological grounds, or through fixed degree spline or polynomial terms. If it is desirable to learn the shape of these relationships then generalized additive models (GAMs) are an excellent alternative. GAMs extend the generalized linear model such that the linear predictor includes one or more smooth functions, parameterised using penalised splines. A wiggliness penalty on each function is used to avoid over fitting while estimating the parameters of the spline basis functions to maximise fit to the data. Modern GAMs include automatic smoothness selection methods to find an optimal balance between fit and complexity of the estimated functions. Because GAMs learn the shapes of functions from the data, the user can avoid forcing a particular model to their data. Here, I provide a brief description of GAMs and visually illustrate how they work. I then demonstrate the utility of GAMs on three example data sets of increasing complexity, to show i) how learning from data can produce a better fit to data than that of parametric models, ii) how hierarchical GAMs can be used to estimate growth data from multiple animals in a single model, and iii) how hierarchical GAMs can be used for formal statistical inference in a designed experiment. The examples are supported by R code that demonstrates how to fit each of the models considered, and reproduces the results of the statistical analyses reported here. Ultimately, I show that GAMs are a modern, flexible, and highly usable statistical model that is amenable to many research problems in animal science.

### Partnering with Generative AI: Experimental Evaluation of Human-Led and   Model-Led Interaction in Human-AI Co-Creation
**Authors**: Sebastian Maier, Manuel Schneider, Stefan Feuerriegel

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T13:41:33Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) show strong potential to support creative tasks, but the role of the interface design is poorly understood. In particular, the effect of different modes of collaboration between humans and LLMs on co-creation outcomes is unclear. To test this, we conducted a randomized controlled experiment ($N = 486$) comparing: (a) two variants of reflective, human-led modes in which the LLM elicits elaboration through suggestions or questions, against (b) a proactive, model-led mode in which the LLM independently rewrites ideas. By assessing the effects on idea quality, diversity, and perceived ownership, we found that the model-led mode substantially improved idea quality but reduced idea diversity and users' perceived idea ownership. The reflective, human-led mode also improved idea quality, yet while preserving diversity and ownership. Our findings highlight the importance of designing interactions with generative AI systems as reflective thought partners that complement human strengths and augment creative processes.

### Noise-corrected GRPO: From Noisy Rewards to Unbiased Gradients
**Authors**: Omar El Mansouri, Mohamed El Amine Seddik, Salem Lahlou

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T13:24:50Z

**Summary**: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) or verifiable rewards (RLVR), the standard paradigm for aligning LLMs or building recent SOTA reasoning models, is highly sensitive to noise from inconsistent or erroneous rewards. Yet, the interaction between such noise and widely used group-based policy optimization methods remains underexplored. We introduce a noise-robust Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and Done Right GRPO (Dr.GRPO) framework that explicitly models reward corruption as Bernoulli noise. Our method applies noise correction after estimating reward flip probabilities to debias the learning signal, yielding provably unbiased gradient estimates. Theoretical analysis shows that group-based methods inherently mitigate individual-level noise, and our correction strategy amplifies this robustness. Empirically, we observe consistent improvements across math and code tasks when applying our noise correction to standard reward model usage, with particular gains of up to 6.7 percentage points in accuracy on math tasks and 1.5 on code tasks under realistic reward model conditions. This work bridges label-noise correction from supervised learning with modern RLHF, offering both theoretical insights and a practical algorithm for noisy real-world deployment.

### Network Intrusion Detection: Evolution from Conventional Approaches to   LLM Collaboration and Emerging Risks
**Authors**: Yaokai Feng, Kouichi Sakurai

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T13:21:32Z

**Summary**: This survey systematizes the evolution of network intrusion detection systems (NIDS), from conventional methods such as signature-based and neural network (NN)-based approaches to recent integrations with large language models (LLMs). It clearly and concisely summarizes the current status, strengths, and limitations of conventional techniques, and explores the practical benefits of integrating LLMs into NIDS. Recent research on the application of LLMs to NIDS in diverse environments is reviewed, including conventional network infrastructures, autonomous vehicle environments and IoT environments.   From this survey, readers will learn that: 1) the earliest methods, signature-based IDSs, continue to make significant contributions to modern systems, despite their well-known weaknesses; 2) NN-based detection, although considered promising and under development for more than two decades, and despite numerous related approaches, still faces significant challenges in practical deployment; 3) LLMs are useful for NIDS in many cases, and a number of related approaches have been proposed; however, they still face significant challenges in practical applications. Moreover, they can even be exploited as offensive tools, such as for generating malware, crafting phishing messages, or launching cyberattacks. Recently, several studies have been proposed to address these challenges, which are also reviewed in this survey; and 4) strategies for constructing domain-specific LLMs have been proposed and are outlined in this survey, as it is nearly impossible to train a NIDS-specific LLM from scratch.

### First-Passage-Time Asymmetry for Biased Run-and-Tumble Processes
**Authors**: Yonathan Sarmiento, Benjamin Walter, Debraj Das, Samvit Mahapatra, Édgar Roldán, Rosemary J. Harris

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T13:17:00Z

**Summary**: We explore first-passage phenomenology for biased active processes with a renewal-type structure, focusing in particular on paradigmatic run-and-tumble models in both discrete and continuous state spaces. In general, we show there is no equality between distributions of conditional first-passage times to symmetric barriers positioned in and against the bias direction. However, we give conditions for such a duality to be restored asymptotically (in the limit of a large barrier distance) and highlight connections to the Gallavotti-Cohen fluctuation relation and the method of images. Our general trajectory arguments of first-passage-time distributions for asymmetric run-and-tumble processes to escape from an interval of arbitrary width are supported by exact analytical results, which we derive extending Montroll's defect technique. Furthermore, we quantify the degree of violation of first-passage duality using Kullback-Leibler divergence and signal-to-noise ratios associated with the first-passage times to the two barriers. We reveal an intriguing dependence of such measures of first-passage asymmetry on the underlying often hidden tumbling dynamics which may inspire inference techniques based on first-passage-time statistics in active systems.

### MOOSE-Chem2: Exploring LLM Limits in Fine-Grained Scientific Hypothesis   Discovery via Hierarchical Search
**Authors**: Zonglin Yang, Wanhao Liu, Ben Gao, Yujie Liu, Wei Li, Tong Xie, Lidong Bing, Wanli Ouyang, Erik Cambria, Dongzhan Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T13:16:36Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in automating scientific hypothesis generation, yet existing approaches primarily yield coarse-grained hypotheses lacking critical methodological and experimental details. We introduce and formally define the new task of fine-grained scientific hypothesis discovery, which entails generating detailed, experimentally actionable hypotheses from coarse initial research directions. We frame this as a combinatorial optimization problem and investigate the upper limits of LLMs' capacity to solve it when maximally leveraged. Specifically, we explore four foundational questions: (1) how to best harness an LLM's internal heuristics to formulate the fine-grained hypothesis it itself would judge as the most promising among all the possible hypotheses it might generate, based on its own internal scoring-thus defining a latent reward landscape over the hypothesis space; (2) whether such LLM-judged better hypotheses exhibit stronger alignment with ground-truth hypotheses; (3) whether shaping the reward landscape using an ensemble of diverse LLMs of similar capacity yields better outcomes than defining it with repeated instances of the strongest LLM among them; and (4) whether an ensemble of identical LLMs provides a more reliable reward landscape than a single LLM. To address these questions, we propose a hierarchical search method that incrementally proposes and integrates details into the hypothesis, progressing from general concepts to specific experimental configurations. We show that this hierarchical process smooths the reward landscape and enables more effective optimization. Empirical evaluations on a new benchmark of expert-annotated fine-grained hypotheses from recent literature show that our method consistently outperforms strong baselines.

### Sharpening Kubernetes Audit Logs with Context Awareness
**Authors**: Matteo Franzil, Valentino Armani, Luis Augusto Dias Knob, Domenico Siracusa

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T13:15:09Z

**Summary**: Kubernetes has emerged as the de facto orchestrator of microservices, providing scalability and extensibility to a highly dynamic environment. It builds an intricate and deeply connected system that requires extensive monitoring capabilities to be properly managed. To this account, K8s natively offers audit logs, a powerful feature for tracking API interactions in the cluster. Audit logs provide a detailed and chronological record of all activities in the system. Unfortunately, K8s auditing suffers from several practical limitations: it generates large volumes of data continuously, as all components within the cluster interact and respond to user actions. Moreover, each action can trigger a cascade of secondary events dispersed across the log, with little to no explicit linkage, making it difficult to reconstruct the context behind user-initiated operations. In this paper, we introduce K8NTEXT, a novel approach for streamlining K8s audit logs by reconstructing contexts, i.e., grouping actions performed by actors on the cluster with the subsequent events these actions cause. Correlated API calls are automatically identified, labeled, and consistently grouped using a combination of inference rules and a Machine Learning model, largely simplifying data consumption. We evaluate K8NTEXT's performance, scalability, and expressiveness both in systematic tests and with a series of use cases. We show that it consistently provides accurate context reconstruction, even for complex operations involving 50, 100 or more correlated actions, achieving over 95 percent accuracy across the entire spectrum, from simple to highly composite actions.

### ReconViaGen: Towards Accurate Multi-view 3D Object Reconstruction via   Generation
**Authors**: Jiahao Chang, Chongjie Ye, Yushuang Wu, Yuantao Chen, Yidan Zhang, Zhongjin Luo, Chenghong Li, Yihao Zhi, Xiaoguang Han

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T13:15:06Z

**Summary**: Existing multi-view 3D object reconstruction methods heavily rely on sufficient overlap between input views, where occlusions and sparse coverage in practice frequently yield severe reconstruction incompleteness. Recent advancements in diffusion-based 3D generative techniques offer the potential to address these limitations by leveraging learned generative priors to hallucinate invisible parts of objects, thereby generating plausible 3D structures. However, the stochastic nature of the inference process limits the accuracy and reliability of generation results, preventing existing reconstruction frameworks from integrating such 3D generative priors. In this work, we comprehensively analyze the reasons why diffusion-based 3D generative methods fail to achieve high consistency, including (a) the insufficiency in constructing and leveraging cross-view connections when extracting multi-view image features as conditions, and (b) the poor controllability of iterative denoising during local detail generation, which easily leads to plausible but inconsistent fine geometric and texture details with inputs. Accordingly, we propose ReconViaGen to innovatively integrate reconstruction priors into the generative framework and devise several strategies that effectively address these issues. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our ReconViaGen can reconstruct complete and accurate 3D models consistent with input views in both global structure and local details.Project page: https://jiahao620.github.io/reconviagen.

 ### PixelRefer: A Unified Framework for Spatio-Temporal Object Referring   with Arbitrary Granularity
**Authors**: Yuqian Yuan, Wenqiao Zhang, Xin Li, Shihao Wang, Kehan Li, Wentong Li, Jun Xiao, Lei Zhang, Beng Chin Ooi

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T17:59:32Z

**Summary**: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong general-purpose capabilities in open-world visual comprehension. However, most existing MLLMs primarily focus on holistic, scene-level understanding, often overlooking the need for fine-grained, object-centric reasoning. In this paper, we present PixelRefer, a unified region-level MLLM framework that enables advanced fine-grained understanding over user-specified regions across both images and videos. Motivated by the observation that LLM attention predominantly focuses on object-level tokens, we propose a Scale-Adaptive Object Tokenizer (SAOT) to generate compact and semantically rich object representations from free-form regions. Our analysis reveals that global visual tokens contribute mainly in early LLM layers, inspiring the design of PixelRefer-Lite, an efficient variant that employs an Object-Centric Infusion module to pre-fuse global context into object tokens. This yields a lightweight Object-Only Framework that substantially reduces computational cost while maintaining high semantic fidelity. To facilitate fine-grained instruction tuning, we curate PixelRefer-2.2M, a high-quality object-centric instruction dataset. Extensive experiments across a range of benchmarks validate that PixelRefer achieves leading performance with fewer training samples, while PixelRefer-Lite offers competitive accuracy with notable gains in efficiency.

### Alita-G: Self-Evolving Generative Agent for Agent Generation
**Authors**: Jiahao Qiu, Xuan Qi, Hongru Wang, Xinzhe Juan, Yimin Wang, Zelin Zhao, Jiayi Geng, Jiacheng Guo, Peihang Li, Jingzhe Shi, Shilong Liu, Mengdi Wang

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T17:59:14Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to perform better when scaffolded into agents with memory, tools, and feedback. Beyond this, self-evolving agents have emerged, but current work largely limits adaptation to prompt rewriting or failure retries. Therefore, we present ALITA-G, a self-evolution framework that transforms a general-purpose agent into a domain expert by systematically generating, abstracting, and curating Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools. In this framework, a generalist agent executes a curated suite of target-domain tasks and synthesizes candidate MCPs from successful trajectories. These are then abstracted to parameterized primitives and consolidated into an MCP Box. At inference time, ALITA-G performs retrieval-augmented MCP selection with the help of each tool's descriptions and use cases, before executing an agent equipped with the MCP Executor. Across several benchmarks GAIA, PathVQA, and Humanity's Last Exam, ALITA-G attains strong gains while reducing computation costs. On GAIA validation, it achieves 83.03% pass@1 and 89.09% pass@3, establishing a new state-of-the-art result while reducing mean tokens per example by approximately 15% relative to a strong baseline agent. ALITA-G thus provides a principled pathway from generalist capability to reusable, domain-specific competence, improving both accuracy and efficiency on complex reasoning tasks.

### Constrained Entropic Unlearning: A Primal-Dual Framework for Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Taha Entesari, Arman Hatami, Rinat Khaziev, Anil Ramakrishna, Mahyar Fazlyab

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T17:59:13Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) deployed in real-world settings increasingly face the need to unlearn sensitive, outdated, or proprietary information. Existing unlearning methods typically formulate forgetting and retention as a regularized trade-off, combining both objectives into a single scalarized loss. This often leads to unstable optimization and degraded performance on retained data, especially under aggressive forgetting. We propose a new formulation of LLM unlearning as a constrained optimization problem: forgetting is enforced via a novel logit-margin flattening loss that explicitly drives the output distribution toward uniformity on a designated forget set, while retention is preserved through a hard constraint on a separate retain set. Compared to entropy-based objectives, our loss is softmax-free, numerically stable, and maintains non-vanishing gradients, enabling more efficient and robust optimization. We solve the constrained problem using a scalable primal-dual algorithm that exposes the trade-off between forgetting and retention through the dynamics of the dual variable, all without any extra computational overhead. Evaluations on the TOFU and MUSE benchmarks across diverse LLM architectures demonstrate that our approach consistently matches or exceeds state-of-the-art baselines, effectively removing targeted information while preserving downstream utility.

### Think Twice: Branch-and-Rethink Reasoning Reward Model
**Authors**: Yizhu Jiao, Jiaqi Zeng, Julien Veron Vialard, Oleksii Kuchaiev, Jiawei Han, Olivier Delalleau

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T17:58:07Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on thinking models that externalize intermediate steps and allocate extra test-time compute, with think-twice strategies showing that a deliberate second pass can elicit stronger reasoning. In contrast, most reward models (RMs) still compress many quality dimensions into a single scalar in one shot, a design that induces judgment diffusion: attention spreads across evaluation criteria, yielding diluted focus and shallow analysis. We introduce branch-and-rethink (BR-RM), a two-turn RM that transfers the think-twice principle to reward modeling. Turn 1 performs adaptive branching, selecting a small set of instance-critical dimensions (such as factuality and safety) and sketching concise, evidence-seeking hypotheses. Turn 2 executes branch-conditioned rethinking, a targeted reread that tests those hypotheses and scrutinizes only what matters most. We train with GRPO-style reinforcement learning over structured two-turn traces using a simple binary outcome reward with strict format checks, making the approach compatible with standard RLHF pipelines. By converting all-at-oncescoringintofocused, second-lookreasoning, BR-RMreducesjudgmentdiffusionandimproves sensitivity to subtle yet consequential errors while remaining practical and scalable. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on three challenging reward modeling benchmarks across diverse domains. The code and the model will be released soon.

### Multi-Agent Evolve: LLM Self-Improve through Co-evolution
**Authors**: Yixing Chen, Yiding Wang, Siqi Zhu, Haofei Yu, Tao Feng, Muhan Zhang, Mostofa Patwary, Jiaxuan You

**Updated**: 2025-10-28T03:30:44Z

**Summary**: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated significant potential in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, the success of RL for LLMs heavily relies on human-curated datasets and verifiable rewards, which limit their scalability and generality. Recent Self-Play RL methods, inspired by the success of the paradigm in games and Go, aim to enhance LLM reasoning capabilities without human-annotated data. However, their methods primarily depend on a grounded environment for feedback (e.g., a Python interpreter or a game engine); extending them to general domains remains challenging. To address these challenges, we propose Multi-Agent Evolve (MAE), a framework that enables LLMs to self-evolve in solving diverse tasks, including mathematics, reasoning, and general knowledge Q&A. The core design of MAE is based on a triplet of interacting agents (Proposer, Solver, Judge) that are instantiated from a single LLM, and applies reinforcement learning to optimize their behaviors. The Proposer generates questions, the Solver attempts solutions, and the Judge evaluates both while co-evolving. Experiments on Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct demonstrate that MAE achieves an average improvement of 4.54% on multiple benchmarks. These results highlight MAE as a scalable, data-efficient method for enhancing the general reasoning abilities of LLMs with minimal reliance on human-curated supervision.

### Lightweight Robust Direct Preference Optimization
**Authors**: Cheol Woo Kim, Shresth Verma, Mauricio Tec, Milind Tambe

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T17:55:06Z

**Summary**: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has become a popular method for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) due to its stability and simplicity. However, it is also known to be sensitive to noise in the data and prone to overfitting. Recent works have proposed using distributionally robust optimization (DRO) to address potential noise and distributional shift in the data. However, these methods often suffer from excessive conservatism and high computational cost. We propose DPO-PRO (DPO with Preference Robustness), a robust fine-tuning algorithm based on DPO which accounts for uncertainty in the preference distribution through a lightweight DRO formulation. Unlike prior DRO-based variants, DPO-PRO focuses solely on uncertainty in preferences, avoiding unnecessary conservatism and incurring negligible computational overhead. We further show that DPO-PRO is equivalent to a regularized DPO objective that penalizes model overconfidence under weak preference signals. We evaluate DPO-PRO on standard alignment benchmarks and a real-world public health task. Experimental results show that our method consistently improves robustness to noisy preference signals compared to existing DPO variants.

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T17:54:07Z

**Summary**: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has spurred the emergence of data agents--autonomous systems designed to orchestrate Data + AI ecosystems for tackling complex data-related tasks. However, the term "data agent" currently suffers from terminological ambiguity and inconsistent adoption, conflating simple query responders with sophisticated autonomous architectures. This terminological ambiguity fosters mismatched user expectations, accountability challenges, and barriers to industry growth. Inspired by the SAE J3016 standard for driving automation, this survey introduces the first systematic hierarchical taxonomy for data agents, comprising six levels that delineate and trace progressive shifts in autonomy, from manual operations (L0) to a vision of generative, fully autonomous data agents (L5), thereby clarifying capability boundaries and responsibility allocation. Through this lens, we offer a structured review of existing research arranged by increasing autonomy, encompassing specialized data agents for data management, preparation, and analysis, alongside emerging efforts toward versatile, comprehensive systems with enhanced autonomy. We further analyze critical evolutionary leaps and technical gaps for advancing data agents, especially the ongoing L2-to-L3 transition, where data agents evolve from procedural execution to autonomous orchestration. Finally, we conclude with a forward-looking roadmap, envisioning the advent of proactive, generative data agents.

### Hope Speech Detection in Social Media English Corpora: Performance of   Traditional and Transformer Models
**Authors**: Luis Ramos, Hiram Calvo, Olga Kolesnikova

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T17:53:40Z

**Summary**: The identification of hope speech has become a promised NLP task, considering the need to detect motivational expressions of agency and goal-directed behaviour on social media platforms. This proposal evaluates traditional machine learning models and fine-tuned transformers for a previously split hope speech dataset as train, development and test set. On development test, a linear-kernel SVM and logistic regression both reached a macro-F1 of 0.78; SVM with RBF kernel reached 0.77, and Na\"ive Bayes hit 0.75. Transformer models delivered better results, the best model achieved weighted precision of 0.82, weighted recall of 0.80, weighted F1 of 0.79, macro F1 of 0.79, and 0.80 accuracy. These results suggest that while optimally configured traditional machine learning models remain agile, transformer architectures detect some subtle semantics of hope to achieve higher precision and recall in hope speech detection, suggesting that larges transformers and LLMs could perform better in small datasets.

### Reduced AI Acceptance After the Generative AI Boom: Evidence From a   Two-Wave Survey Study
**Authors**: Joachim Baumann, Aleksandra Urman, Ulrich Leicht-Deobald, Zachary J. Roman, Anikó Hannák, Markus Christen

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T17:47:58Z

**Summary**: The rapid adoption of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) technologies has led many organizations to integrate AI into their products and services, often without considering user preferences. Yet, public attitudes toward AI use, especially in impactful decision-making scenarios, are underexplored. Using a large-scale two-wave survey study (n_wave1=1514, n_wave2=1488) representative of the Swiss population, we examine shifts in public attitudes toward AI before and after the launch of ChatGPT. We find that the GenAI boom is significantly associated with reduced public acceptance of AI (see Figure 1) and increased demand for human oversight in various decision-making contexts. The proportion of respondents finding AI "not acceptable at all" increased from 23% to 30%, while support for human-only decision-making rose from 18% to 26%. These shifts have amplified existing social inequalities in terms of widened educational, linguistic, and gender gaps post-boom. Our findings challenge industry assumptions about public readiness for AI deployment and highlight the critical importance of aligning technological development with evolving public preferences.

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) and emerging agentic frameworks are beginning to transform single-cell biology by enabling natural-language reasoning, generative annotation, and multimodal data integration. However, progress remains fragmented across data modalities, architectures, and evaluation standards. LLM4Cell presents the first unified survey of 58 foundation and agentic models developed for single-cell research, spanning RNA, ATAC, multi-omic, and spatial modalities. We categorize these methods into five families-foundation, text-bridge, spatial, multimodal, epigenomic, and agentic-and map them to eight key analytical tasks including annotation, trajectory and perturbation modeling, and drug-response prediction. Drawing on over 40 public datasets, we analyze benchmark suitability, data diversity, and ethical or scalability constraints, and evaluate models across 10 domain dimensions covering biological grounding, multi-omics alignment, fairness, privacy, and explainability. By linking datasets, models, and evaluation domains, LLM4Cell provides the first integrated view of language-driven single-cell intelligence and outlines open challenges in interpretability, standardization, and trustworthy model development.

### SafeMERGE: Preserving Safety Alignment in Fine-Tuned Large Language   Models via Selective Layer-Wise Model Merging
**Authors**: Aladin Djuhera, Swanand Ravindra Kadhe, Farhan Ahmed, Syed Zawad, Holger Boche

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T17:40:05Z

**Summary**: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) is a common practice to adapt generalist models to specialized domains. However, recent studies show that fine-tuning can erode safety alignment, causing LLMs to respond to harmful or unethical prompts. Many methods to realign safety have been proposed, but often introduce custom algorithms that are difficult to implement or compromise task utility. In this work, we propose SafeMERGE, a lightweight, post-fine-tuning framework that preserves safety while maintaining downstream performance. SafeMERGE selectively merges fine-tuned with safety-aligned model layers only when they deviate from safe behavior, measured by a cosine similarity criterion. Across three LLMs and two tasks, SafeMERGE consistently reduces harmful outputs compared to other defenses, with negligible or even positive impact on utility. Our results demonstrate that selective layer-wise merging offers an effective safeguard against the inadvertent loss of safety during fine-tuning, establishing SafeMERGE as a simple post-fine-tuning defense.

### ReCode: Unify Plan and Action for Universal Granularity Control
**Authors**: Zhaoyang Yu, Jiayi Zhang, Huixue Su, Yufan Zhao, Yifan Wu, Mingyi Deng, Jinyu Xiang, Yizhang Lin, Lingxiao Tang, Yingchao Li, Yuyu Luo, Bang Liu, Chenglin Wu

**Updated**: 2025-10-28T03:22:35Z

**Summary**: Real-world tasks require decisions at varying granularities, and humans excel at this by leveraging a unified cognitive representation where planning is fundamentally understood as a high-level form of action. However, current Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents lack this crucial capability to operate fluidly across decision granularities. This limitation stems from existing paradigms that enforce a rigid separation between high-level planning and low-level action, which impairs dynamic adaptability and limits generalization. We propose ReCode (Recursive Code Generation), a novel paradigm that addresses this limitation by unifying planning and action within a single code representation. In this representation, ReCode treats high-level plans as abstract placeholder functions, which the agent then recursively decomposes into finer-grained sub-functions until reaching primitive actions. This recursive approach dissolves the rigid boundary between plan and action, enabling the agent to dynamically control its decision granularity. Furthermore, the recursive structure inherently generates rich, multi-granularity training data, enabling models to learn hierarchical decision-making processes. Extensive experiments show ReCode significantly surpasses advanced baselines in inference performance and demonstrates exceptional data efficiency in training, validating our core insight that unifying planning and action through recursive code generation is a powerful and effective approach to achieving universal granularity control.

### SafeCOMM: A Study on Safety Degradation in Fine-Tuned Telecom Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Aladin Djuhera, Swanand Ravindra Kadhe, Farhan Ahmed, Syed Zawad, Fernando Koch, Walid Saad, Holger Boche

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T17:35:06Z

**Summary**: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on telecom datasets is a common practice to adapt general-purpose models to the telecom domain. However, little attention has been paid to how this process may compromise model safety. Recent research has shown that even benign fine-tuning can degrade the safety alignment of LLMs, causing them to respond to harmful or unethical user queries. In this paper, we investigate this issue by fine-tuning LLMs on three representative telecom datasets and show that safety degrades even for light telecom domain adaptation. To this end, we introduce TeleHarm, the first telecom-specific red-teaming benchmark, which we use alongside established Direct-Harm and HexPhi datasets to systematically assess harmful behavior. We further extend our analysis to publicly available TeleLLMs that were continually pre-trained on large telecom corpora, revealing that safety alignment is severely lacking, primarily due to the omission of safety-focused instruction tuning. To address these issues, we evaluate three realignment defenses: SafeInstruct, SafeLoRA, SafeMERGE. We show that, across all settings, the proposed defenses can effectively restore safety without compromising telecom task performance, leading to Safe teleCOMMunication (SafeCOMM) models. Our work serves as both a diagnostic study and practical guide for safety realignment in telecom-tuned LLMs, underscoring the need for safety-aware instruction and fine-tuning in the telecom domain.

### ISA-Bench: Benchmarking Instruction Sensitivity for Large Audio Language   Models
**Authors**: Bohan Li, Wenbin Huang, Yuhang Qiu, Yiwei Guo, Hankun Wang, Zhihan Li, Jing Peng, Ziyang Ma, Xie Chen, Kai Yu

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T17:31:25Z

**Summary**: Large Audio Language Models (LALMs), which couple acoustic perception with large language models (LLMs) to extract and understand diverse information from audio, have attracted intense interest from both academic and industrial communities. However, existing LALMs are highly sensitive to how instructions are phrased, affecting both (i) instruction-following rates and (ii) task performance. Yet, no existing benchmarks offer a systematic and comprehensive evaluation of this sensitivity. We introduce ISA-Bench, a dynamic benchmark evaluating instruction sensitivity for LALMs along three axes: instruction description, output format, and task composition. We assess recent open-source and proprietary LALMs using ISA-Bench, profiling both compliance and accuracy under controlled instruction variations. Experimental results reveal that even state-of-the-art LALMs suffer significant instruction sensitivity, leading to degraded performance on fundamental audio understanding tasks. To mitigate this issue, we fine-tune Qwen2-Audio on a specifically constructed complex instruction-variant dataset, achieving a marked improvement in instruction-following performance. However, this also induces nontrivial catastrophic forgetting: the model loses some previously mastered task capabilities when exposed to new instruction styles. Our benchmark provides a standardized basis for assessing and improving instruction sensitivity in LALMs, underscoring the need for instruction-robust audio understanding in real-world pipelines.

### Fixing It in Post: A Comparative Study of LLM Post-Training Data Quality   and Model Performance
**Authors**: Aladin Djuhera, Swanand Ravindra Kadhe, Syed Zawad, Farhan Ahmed, Heiko Ludwig, Holger Boche

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T17:31:21Z

**Summary**: Recent work on large language models (LLMs) has increasingly focused on post-training and alignment with datasets curated to enhance instruction following, world knowledge, and specialized skills. However, most post-training datasets used in leading open- and closed-source LLMs remain inaccessible to the public, with limited information about their construction process. This lack of transparency has motivated the recent development of open-source post-training corpora. While training on these open alternatives can yield performance comparable to that of leading models, systematic comparisons remain challenging due to the significant computational cost of conducting them rigorously at scale, and are therefore largely absent. As a result, it remains unclear how specific samples, task types, or curation strategies influence downstream performance when assessing data quality. In this work, we conduct the first comprehensive side-by-side analysis of two prominent open post-training datasets: Tulu-3-SFT-Mix and SmolTalk. Using the Magpie framework, we annotate each sample with detailed quality metrics, including turn structure (single-turn vs. multi-turn), task category, input quality, and response quality, and we derive statistics that reveal structural and qualitative similarities and differences between the two datasets. Based on these insights, we design a principled curation recipe that produces a new data mixture, TuluTalk, which contains 14% fewer samples than either source dataset while matching or exceeding their performance on key benchmarks. Our findings offer actionable insights for constructing more effective post-training datasets that improve model performance within practical resource limits. To support future research, we publicly release both the annotated source datasets and our curated TuluTalk mixture.

### Human-Aligned Faithfulness in Toxicity Explanations of LLMs
**Authors**: Ramaravind K. Mothilal, Joanna Roy, Syed Ishtiaque Ahmed, Shion Guha

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T17:23:28Z

**Summary**: The discourse around toxicity and LLMs in NLP largely revolves around detection tasks. This work shifts the focus to evaluating LLMs' reasoning about toxicity -- from their explanations that justify a stance -- to enhance their trustworthiness in downstream tasks. Despite extensive research on explainability, it is not straightforward to adopt existing methods to evaluate free-form toxicity explanation due to their over-reliance on input text perturbations, among other challenges. To account for these, we propose a novel, theoretically-grounded multi-dimensional criterion, Human-Aligned Faithfulness (HAF), that measures the extent to which LLMs' free-form toxicity explanations align with those of a rational human under ideal conditions. We develop six metrics, based on uncertainty quantification, to comprehensively evaluate HAF of LLMs' toxicity explanations with no human involvement, and highlight how "non-ideal" the explanations are. We conduct several experiments on three Llama models (of size up to 70B) and an 8B Ministral model on five diverse toxicity datasets. Our results show that while LLMs generate plausible explanations to simple prompts, their reasoning about toxicity breaks down when prompted about the nuanced relations between the complete set of reasons, the individual reasons, and their toxicity stances, resulting in inconsistent and irrelevant responses. We open-source our code at https://github.com/uofthcdslab/HAF and LLM-generated explanations at https://huggingface.co/collections/uofthcdslab/haf.

### On the Stability of Graph Convolutional Neural Networks: A Probabilistic   Perspective
**Authors**: Ning Zhang, Henry Kenlay, Li Zhang, Mihai Cucuringu, Xiaowen Dong

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T17:20:28Z

**Summary**: Graph convolutional neural networks (GCNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for analyzing graph-structured data, achieving remarkable success across diverse applications. However, the theoretical understanding of the stability of these models, i.e., their sensitivity to small changes in the graph structure, remains in rather limited settings, hampering the development and deployment of robust and trustworthy models in practice. To fill this gap, we study how perturbations in the graph topology affect GCNN outputs and propose a novel formulation for analyzing model stability. Unlike prior studies that focus only on worst-case perturbations, our distribution-aware formulation characterizes output perturbations across a broad range of input data. This way, our framework enables, for the first time, a probabilistic perspective on the interplay between the statistical properties of the node data and perturbations in the graph topology. We conduct extensive experiments to validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate their benefits over existing baselines, in terms of both representation stability and adversarial attacks on downstream tasks. Our results demonstrate the practical significance of the proposed formulation and highlight the importance of incorporating data distribution into stability analysis.

### LimRank: Less is More for Reasoning-Intensive Information Reranking
**Authors**: Tingyu Song, Yilun Zhao, Siyue Zhang, Chen Zhao, Arman Cohan

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T17:19:37Z

**Summary**: Existing approaches typically rely on large-scale fine-tuning to adapt LLMs for information reranking tasks, which is computationally expensive. In this work, we demonstrate that modern LLMs can be effectively adapted using only minimal, high-quality supervision. To enable this, we design LIMRANK-SYNTHESIZER, a reusable and open-source pipeline for generating diverse, challenging, and realistic reranking examples. Using this synthetic data, we fine-tune our reranker model, LIMRANK. We evaluate LIMRANK on two challenging benchmarks, i.e., BRIGHT for reasoning-intensive retrieval and FollowIR for instruction-following retrieval. Our experiments demonstrate that LIMRANK achieves competitive performance, while being trained on less than 5% of the data typically used in prior work. Further ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of LIMRANK-SYNTHESIZER and the strong generalization capabilities of LIMRANK across downstream tasks, including scientific literature search and retrieval-augmented generation for knowledge-intensive problem solving.

### IPQA: A Benchmark for Core Intent Identification in Personalized   Question Answering
**Authors**: Jieyong Kim, Maryam Amirizaniani, Soojin Yoon, Dongha Lee

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T17:12:49Z

**Summary**: Intent identification serves as the foundation for generating appropriate responses in personalized question answering (PQA). However, existing benchmarks evaluate only response quality or retrieval performance without directly measuring intent identification capabilities. This gap is critical because without understanding which intents users prioritize, systems cannot generate responses satisfying individual information needs. To address this, we introduce the concept of core intents: intents users prioritize when selecting answers to satisfy their information needs. To evaluate these core intents, we propose IPQA, a benchmark for core Intent identification in Personalized Question Answering. Since users do not explicitly state their prioritized intents, we derive core intents from observable behavior patterns in answer selection, grounded in satisficing theory where users choose answers meeting their acceptance thresholds. We construct a dataset with various domains through systematic filtering, LLM-based annotation, and rigorous quality control combining automated verification with human validation. Experimental evaluations across state-of-the-art language models reveal that current systems struggle with core intent identification in personalized contexts. Models fail to identify core intents from user histories, with performance degrading as question complexity increases. The code and dataset will be made publicly available to facilitate future research in this direction.

### Toward Carbon-Neutral Human AI: Rethinking Data, Computation, and   Learning Paradigms for Sustainable Intelligence
**Authors**: KC Santosh, Rodrigue Rizk, Longwei Wang

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T17:02:30Z

**Summary**: The rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has led to unprecedented computational demands, raising significant environmental and ethical concerns. This paper critiques the prevailing reliance on large-scale, static datasets and monolithic training paradigms, advocating for a shift toward human-inspired, sustainable AI solutions. We introduce a novel framework, Human AI (HAI), which emphasizes incremental learning, carbon-aware optimization, and human-in-the-loop collaboration to enhance adaptability, efficiency, and accountability. By drawing parallels with biological cognition and leveraging dynamic architectures, HAI seeks to balance performance with ecological responsibility. We detail the theoretical foundations, system design, and operational principles that enable AI to learn continuously and contextually while minimizing carbon footprints and human annotation costs. Our approach addresses pressing challenges in active learning, continual adaptation, and energy-efficient model deployment, offering a pathway toward responsible, human-centered artificial intelligence.

### AttentionRAG: Attention-Guided Context Pruning in Retrieval-Augmented   Generation
**Authors**: Yixiong Fang, Tianran Sun, Yuling Shi, Xiaodong Gu

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T16:55:55Z

**Summary**: While RAG demonstrates remarkable capabilities in LLM applications, its effectiveness is hindered by the ever-increasing length of retrieved contexts, which introduces information redundancy and substantial computational overhead. Existing context pruning methods, such as LLMLingua, lack contextual awareness and offer limited flexibility in controlling compression rates, often resulting in either insufficient pruning or excessive information loss. In this paper, we propose AttentionRAG, an attention-guided context pruning method for RAG systems. The core idea of AttentionRAG lies in its attention focus mechanism, which reformulates RAG queries into a next-token prediction paradigm. This mechanism isolates the query's semantic focus to a single token, enabling precise and efficient attention calculation between queries and retrieved contexts. Extensive experiments on LongBench and Babilong benchmarks show that AttentionRAG achieves up to 6.3$\times$ context compression while outperforming LLMLingua methods by around 10\% in key metrics.

### Deductive Chain-of-Thought Augmented Socially-aware Robot Navigation   World Model
**Authors**: Weizheng Wang, Obi Ike, Soyun Choi, Sungeun Hong, Byung-Cheol Min

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T16:47:15Z

**Summary**: Social robot navigation increasingly relies on large language models for reasoning, path planning, and enabling movement in dynamic human spaces. However, relying solely on LLMs for planning often leads to unpredictable and unsafe behaviors, especially in dynamic human spaces, due to limited physical grounding and weak logical consistency. In this work, we introduce NaviWM, a socially-aware robot Navigation World Model that augments LLM reasoning with a structured world model and a logic-driven chain-of-thought process. NaviWM consists of two main components: (1) a spatial-temporal world model that captures the positions, velocities, and activities of agents in the environment, and (2) a deductive reasoning module that guides LLMs through a multi-step, logic-based inference process. This integration enables the robot to generate navigation decisions that are both socially compliant and physically safe, under well-defined constraints such as personal space, collision avoidance, and timing. Unlike previous methods based on prompting or fine-tuning, NaviWM encodes social norms as first-order logic, enabling interpretable and verifiable reasoning. Experiments show that NaviWM improves success rates and reduces social violations, particularly in crowded environments. These results demonstrate the benefit of combining formal reasoning with LLMs for robust social navigation. Additional experimental details and demo videos for this work can be found at: https://sites.google.com/view/NaviWM.

### Emotion-Coherent Reasoning for Multimodal LLMs via Emotional Rationale   Verifier
**Authors**: Hyeongseop Rha, Jeong Hun Yeo, Yeonju Kim, Yong Man Ro

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T16:40:17Z

**Summary**: The recent advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is transforming human-computer interaction (HCI) from surface-level exchanges into more nuanced and emotionally intelligent communication. To realize this shift, emotion understanding becomes essential allowing systems to capture subtle cues underlying user intent. Furthermore, providing faithful explanations for predicted emotions is crucial to ensure interpretability and build user trust. However, current MLLM-based methods often generate emotion explanations that diverge from the target labels and sometimes even contradict their own predicted emotions. This inconsistency poses a critical risk for misunderstanding and erodes reliability in interactive settings. To address this, we propose a novel approach: the Emotional Rationale Verifier (ERV) and an Explanation Reward. Our method guides the model to produce reasoning that is explicitly consistent with the target emotion during multimodal emotion recognition without modifying the model architecture or requiring additional paired video-description annotations. Our method significantly improves faithful explanation-prediction consistency and explanation emotion accuracy on the MAFW and DFEW datasets. Through extensive experiments and human evaluations, we show that our approach not only enhances alignment between explanation and prediction but also empowers MLLMs to deliver emotionally coherent, trustworthy interactions, marking a key step toward truly human-like HCI systems.

### Cancer-Myth: Evaluating AI Chatbot on Patient Questions with False   Presuppositions
**Authors**: Wang Bill Zhu, Tianqi Chen, Xinyan Velocity Yu, Ching Ying Lin, Jade Law, Mazen Jizzini, Jorge J. Nieva, Ruishan Liu, Robin Jia

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T16:39:30Z

**Summary**: Cancer patients are increasingly turning to large language models (LLMs) for medical information, making it critical to assess how well these models handle complex, personalized questions. However, current medical benchmarks focus on medical exams or consumer-searched questions and do not evaluate LLMs on real patient questions with patient details. In this paper, we first have three hematology-oncology physicians evaluate cancer-related questions drawn from real patients. While LLM responses are generally accurate, the models frequently fail to recognize or address false presuppositions in the questions, posing risks to safe medical decision-making. To study this limitation systematically, we introduce Cancer-Myth, an expert-verified adversarial dataset of 585 cancer-related questions with false presuppositions. On this benchmark, no frontier LLM -- including GPT-5, Gemini-2.5-Pro, and Claude-4-Sonnet -- corrects these false presuppositions more than $43\%$ of the time. To study mitigation strategies, we further construct a 150-question Cancer-Myth-NFP set, in which physicians confirm the absence of false presuppositions. We find typical mitigation strategies, such as adding precautionary prompts with GEPA optimization, can raise accuracy on Cancer-Myth to $80\%$, but at the cost of misidentifying presuppositions in $41\%$ of Cancer-Myth-NFP questions and causing a $10\%$ relative performance drop on other medical benchmarks. These findings highlight a critical gap in the reliability of LLMs, show that prompting alone is not a reliable remedy for false presuppositions, and underscore the need for more robust safeguards in medical AI systems.

### VOLD: Reasoning Transfer from LLMs to Vision-Language Models via   On-Policy Distillation
**Authors**: Walid Bousselham, Hilde Kuehne, Cordelia Schmid

**Updated**: 2025-10-28T11:09:37Z

**Summary**: Training vision-language models (VLMs) for complex reasoning remains a challenging task, i.a. due to the scarcity of high-quality image-text reasoning data. Conversely, text-based reasoning resources are abundant and scalable, but it is still an open question how to leveraging them for VLM reasoning. To address this problem, we propose VOLD, a framework to transfer reasoning capabilities from text-only teacher models to VLM student models. To this end, VOLD combines reinforcement learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with on-policy distillation, which allows the student reasoning traces to be guided by the teacher model, resulting in a significant gain over using GRPO alone. We further show that a cold-start alignment is essential for an effective transfer during the online training phase in this scenario and that without sufficient distributional alignment between teacher and student, on-policy distillation fails to provide meaningful guidance. We evaluate VOLD across diverse benchmarks including MMMU-Pro, MathVision, MathVista, and LogicVista, showing that VOLD outperforms the baseline model significantly and improves over the state of the art by a margin. Our ablation shows the importance of a cold-start alignment via SFT for on-policy distillation with a text-only teacher.

### Are Agents Just Automata? On the Formal Equivalence Between Agentic AI   and the Chomsky Hierarchy
**Authors**: Roham Koohestani, Ziyou Li, Anton Podkopaev, Maliheh Izadi

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T16:22:02Z

**Summary**: This paper establishes a formal equivalence between the architectural classes of modern agentic AI systems and the abstract machines of the Chomsky hierarchy. We posit that the memory architecture of an AI agent is the definitive feature determining its computational power and that it directly maps it to a corresponding class of automaton. Specifically, we demonstrate that simple reflex agents are equivalent to Finite Automata, hierarchical task-decomposition agents are equivalent to Pushdown Automata, and agents employing readable/writable memory for reflection are equivalent to TMs. This Automata-Agent Framework provides a principled methodology for right-sizing agent architectures to optimize computational efficiency and cost. More critically, it creates a direct pathway to formal verification, enables the application of mature techniques from automata theory to guarantee agent safety and predictability. By classifying agents, we can formally delineate the boundary between verifiable systems and those whose behavior is fundamentally undecidable. We address the inherent probabilistic nature of LLM-based agents by extending the framework to probabilistic automata that allow quantitative risk analysis. The paper concludes by outlining an agenda for developing static analysis tools and grammars for agentic frameworks.

### Leveraging Approximate Caching for Faster Retrieval-Augmented Generation
**Authors**: Shai Bergman, Anne-Marie Kermarrec, Diana Petrescu, Rafael Pires, Mathis Randl, Martijn de Vos, Ji Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T16:20:28Z

**Summary**: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) improves the reliability of large language model (LLM) answers by integrating external knowledge. However, RAG increases the end-to-end inference time since looking for relevant documents from large vector databases is computationally expensive. To address this, we introduce Proximity, an approximate key-value cache that optimizes the RAG workflow by leveraging similarities in user queries. Instead of treating each query independently, Proximity reuses previously retrieved documents when similar queries appear, substantially reducing the reliance on expensive vector database lookups. To efficiently scale, Proximity employs a locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) scheme that enables fast cache lookups while preserving retrieval accuracy. We evaluate Proximity using the MMLU and MedRAG question-answering benchmarks. Our experiments demonstrate that Proximity with our LSH scheme and a realistically-skewed MedRAG workload reduces database calls by 77.2% while maintaining database recall and test accuracy. We experiment with different similarity tolerances and cache capacities, and show that the time spent within the Proximity cache remains low and constant (4.8 microseconds) even as the cache grows substantially in size. Our results demonstrate that approximate caching is a practical and effective strategy for optimizing RAG-based systems.

### Validating LLM-as-a-Judge Systems under Rating Indeterminacy
**Authors**: Luke Guerdan, Solon Barocas, Kenneth Holstein, Hanna Wallach, Zhiwei Steven Wu, Alexandra Chouldechova

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T16:18:11Z

**Summary**: The LLM-as-a-judge paradigm, in which a judge LLM system replaces human raters in rating the outputs of other generative AI (GenAI) systems, plays a critical role in scaling and standardizing GenAI evaluations. To validate such judge systems, evaluators assess human--judge agreement by first collecting multiple human ratings for each item in a validation corpus, then aggregating the ratings into a single, per-item gold label rating. For many items, however, rating criteria may admit multiple valid interpretations, so a human or LLM rater may deem multiple ratings "reasonable" or "correct." We call this condition rating indeterminacy. Problematically, many rating tasks that contain rating indeterminacy rely on forced-choice elicitation, whereby raters are instructed to select only one rating for each item. In this paper, we introduce a framework for validating LLM-as-a-judge systems under rating indeterminacy. We draw theoretical connections between different measures of judge system performance under different human--judge agreement metrics, and different rating elicitation and aggregation schemes. We demonstrate that differences in how humans and LLMs resolve rating indeterminacy when responding to forced-choice rating instructions can heavily bias LLM-as-a-judge validation. Through extensive experiments involving 11 real-world rating tasks and 9 commercial LLMs, we show that standard validation approaches that rely upon forced-choice ratings select judge systems that are highly suboptimal, performing as much as 31% worse than judge systems selected by our approach that uses multi-label "response set" ratings to account for rating indeterminacy. We conclude with concrete recommendations for more principled approaches to LLM-as-a-judge validation.

### Less is More: Local Intrinsic Dimensions of Contextual Language Models
**Authors**: Benjamin Matthias Ruppik, Julius von Rohrscheidt, Carel van Niekerk, Michael Heck, Renato Vukovic, Shutong Feng, Hsien-chin Lin, Nurul Lubis, Bastian Rieck, Marcus Zibrowius, Milica Gašić

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T16:17:17Z

**Summary**: Understanding the internal mechanisms of large language models (LLMs) remains a challenging and complex endeavor. Even fundamental questions, such as how fine-tuning affects model behavior, often require extensive empirical evaluation. In this paper, we introduce a novel perspective based on the geometric properties of contextual latent embeddings to study the effects of training and fine-tuning. To that end, we measure the local dimensions of a contextual language model's latent space and analyze their shifts during training and fine-tuning. We show that the local dimensions provide insights into the model's training dynamics and generalization ability. Specifically, the mean of the local dimensions predicts when the model's training capabilities are exhausted, as exemplified in a dialogue state tracking task, overfitting, as demonstrated in an emotion recognition task, and grokking, as illustrated with an arithmetic task. Furthermore, our experiments suggest a practical heuristic: reductions in the mean local dimension tend to accompany and predict subsequent performance gains. Through this exploration, we aim to provide practitioners with a deeper understanding of the implications of fine-tuning on embedding spaces, facilitating informed decisions when configuring models for specific applications. The results of this work contribute to the ongoing discourse on the interpretability, adaptability, and generalizability of LLMs by bridging the gap between intrinsic model mechanisms and geometric properties in the respective embeddings.

### MMTutorBench: The First Multimodal Benchmark for AI Math Tutoring
**Authors**: Tengchao Yang, Sichen Guo, Mengzhao Jia, Jiaming Su, Yuanyang Liu, Zhihan Zhang, Meng Jiang

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T16:11:49Z

**Summary**: Effective math tutoring requires not only solving problems but also diagnosing students' difficulties and guiding them step by step. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show promise, existing benchmarks largely overlook these tutoring skills. We introduce MMTutorBench, the first benchmark for AI math tutoring, consisting of 685 problems built around pedagogically significant key-steps. Each problem is paired with problem-specific rubrics that enable fine-grained evaluation across six dimensions, and structured into three tasks-Insight Discovery, Operation Formulation, and Operation Execution. We evaluate 12 leading MLLMs and find clear performance gaps between proprietary and open-source systems, substantial room compared to human tutors, and consistent trends across input variants: OCR pipelines degrade tutoring quality, few-shot prompting yields limited gains, and our rubric-based LLM-as-a-Judge proves highly reliable. These results highlight both the difficulty and diagnostic value of MMTutorBench for advancing AI tutoring.

### Policy-Aware Generative AI for Safe, Auditable Data Access Governance
**Authors**: Shames Al Mandalawi, Muzakkiruddin Ahmed Mohammed, Hendrika Maclean, Mert Can Cakmak, John R. Talburt

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T16:10:55Z

**Summary**: Enterprises need access decisions that satisfy least privilege, comply with regulations, and remain auditable. We present a policy aware controller that uses a large language model (LLM) to interpret natural language requests against written policies and metadata, not raw data. The system, implemented with Google Gemini~2.0 Flash, executes a six-stage reasoning framework (context interpretation, user validation, data classification, business purpose test, compliance mapping, and risk synthesis) with early hard policy gates and deny by default. It returns APPROVE, DENY, CONDITIONAL together with cited controls and a machine readable rationale. We evaluate on fourteen canonical cases across seven scenario families using a privacy preserving benchmark. Results show Exact Decision Match improving from 10/14 to 13/14 (92.9\%) after applying policy gates, DENY recall rising to 1.00, False Approval Rate on must-deny families dropping to 0, and Functional Appropriateness and Compliance Adherence at 14/14. Expert ratings of rationale quality are high, and median latency is under one minute. These findings indicate that policy constrained LLM reasoning, combined with explicit gates and audit trails, can translate human readable policies into safe, compliant, and traceable machine decisions.

**Summary**: Financial narratives from U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing reports and quarterly earnings call transcripts (ECTs) are very important for investors, auditors, and regulators. However, their length, financial jargon, and nuanced language make fine-grained analysis difficult. Prior sentiment analysis in the financial domain required a large, expensive labeled dataset, making the sentence-level stance towards specific financial targets challenging. In this work, we introduce a sentence-level corpus for stance detection focused on three core financial metrics: debt, earnings per share (EPS), and sales. The sentences were extracted from Form 10-K annual reports and ECTs, and labeled for stance (positive, negative, neutral) using the advanced ChatGPT-o3-pro model under rigorous human validation. Using this corpus, we conduct a systematic evaluation of modern large language models (LLMs) using zero-shot, few-shot, and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting strategies. Our results show that few-shot with CoT prompting performs best compared to supervised baselines, and LLMs' performance varies across the SEC and ECT datasets. Our findings highlight the practical viability of leveraging LLMs for target-specific stance in the financial domain without requiring extensive labeled data.

### SQOUT: A Risk-Based Threat Analysis Framework for Quantum Communication   Systems
**Authors**: Michal Krelina, Tom Sorger, Bob Dirks

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T16:01:15Z

**Summary**: This paper addresses the urgent need for a cybersecurity framework tailored to quantum communication systems as the world transitions to quantum-safe infrastructures. While quantum communication promises unbreakable security, real-world deployments are vulnerable to physical, protocol, and operational risks. Our work presents a structured framework for analysing these threats, combining a TTP-style (Tactic, Technique, Procedure) approach with a specific risk assessment methodology. We introduce SQOUT, a quantum threat intelligence platform, and illustrate its application using a Photon-Number-Splitting (PNS) attack kill chain. Furthermore, we apply established international standards and best practices for information security risk management to assess quantum-specific risk scenarios, providing practical guidance for safeguarding emerging quantum infrastructures.

### BrowseConf: Confidence-Guided Test-Time Scaling for Web Agents
**Authors**: Litu Ou, Kuan Li, Huifeng Yin, Liwen Zhang, Zhongwang Zhang, Xixi Wu, Rui Ye, Zile Qiao, Yong Jiang, Pengjun Xie, Fei Huang, Jingren Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T15:58:51Z

**Summary**: Confidence in LLMs is a useful indicator of model uncertainty and answer reliability. Existing work mainly focused on single-turn scenarios, while research on confidence in complex multi-turn interactions is limited. In this paper, we investigate whether LLM-based search agents have the ability to communicate their own confidence through verbalized confidence scores after long sequences of actions, a significantly more challenging task compared to outputting confidence in a single interaction. Experimenting on open-source agentic models, we first find that models exhibit much higher task accuracy at high confidence while having near-zero accuracy when confidence is low. Based on this observation, we propose Test-Time Scaling (TTS) methods that use confidence scores to determine answer quality, encourage the model to try again until reaching a satisfactory confidence level. Results show that our proposed methods significantly reduce token consumption while demonstrating competitive performance compared to baseline fixed budget TTS methods.

### Onboard Mission Replanning for Adaptive Cooperative Multi-Robot Systems
**Authors**: Elim Kwan, Rehman Qureshi, Liam Fletcher, Colin Laganier, Victoria Nockles, Richard Walters

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T15:42:48Z

**Summary**: Cooperative autonomous robotic systems have significant potential for executing complex multi-task missions across space, air, ground, and maritime domains. But they commonly operate in remote, dynamic and hazardous environments, requiring rapid in-mission adaptation without reliance on fragile or slow communication links to centralised compute. Fast, on-board replanning algorithms are therefore needed to enhance resilience. Reinforcement Learning shows strong promise for efficiently solving mission planning tasks when formulated as Travelling Salesperson Problems (TSPs), but existing methods: 1) are unsuitable for replanning, where agents do not start at a single location; 2) do not allow cooperation between agents; 3) are unable to model tasks with variable durations; or 4) lack practical considerations for on-board deployment. Here we define the Cooperative Mission Replanning Problem as a novel variant of multiple TSP with adaptations to overcome these issues, and develop a new encoder/decoder-based model using Graph Attention Networks and Attention Models to solve it effectively and efficiently. Using a simple example of cooperative drones, we show our replanner consistently (90% of the time) maintains performance within 10% of the state-of-the-art LKH3 heuristic solver, whilst running 85-370 times faster on a Raspberry Pi. This work paves the way for increased resilience in autonomous multi-agent systems.

### Education Paradigm Shift To Maintain Human Competitive Advantage Over AI
**Authors**: Stanislav Selitskiy, Chihiro Inoue

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T15:38:20Z

**Summary**: Discussion about the replacement of intellectual human labour by ``thinking machines'' has been present in the public and expert discourse since the creation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) as an idea and terminology since the middle of the twentieth century. Until recently, it was more of a hypothetical concern. However, in recent years, with the rise of Generative AI, especially Large Language Models (LLM), and particularly with the widespread popularity of the ChatGPT model, that concern became practical. Many domains of human intellectual labour have to adapt to the new AI tools that give humans new functionality and opportunity, but also question the viability and necessity of some human work that used to be considered intellectual yet has now become an easily automatable commodity. Education, unexpectedly, has now become burdened by an especially crucial role of charting long-range strategies for discovering viable human skills that would guarantee their place in the world of the ubiquitous use of AI in the intellectual sphere. We highlight weaknesses of the current AI and, especially, of its LLM-based core, show that root causes of LLMs' weaknesses are unfixable by the current technologies, and propose directions in the constructivist paradigm for the changes in Education that ensure long-term advantages of humans over AI tools.

### Med-R1: Reinforcement Learning for Generalizable Medical Reasoning in   Vision-Language Models
**Authors**: Yuxiang Lai, Jike Zhong, Ming Li, Shitian Zhao, Yuheng Li, Konstantinos Psounis, Xiaofeng Yang

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T15:33:53Z

**Summary**: Vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved impressive progress in natural image reasoning, yet their potential in medical imaging remains underexplored. Medical vision-language tasks demand precise understanding and clinically coherent answers, which are difficult to achieve due to the complexity of medical data and the scarcity of high-quality expert annotations. These challenges limit the effectiveness of conventional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) strategies that work well in general domains. To address these challenges, we propose Med-R1, a reinforcement learning (RL)-enhanced vision-language model designed to improve generalization and reliability in medical reasoning. Built on the DeepSeek strategy, Med-R1 adopts Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to encourage reward-guided learning beyond static annotations. We comprehensively evaluate Med-R1 across eight distinct medical imaging modalities. Med-R1 achieves a 29.94% improvement in average accuracy over its base model Qwen2-VL-2B, and even outperforms Qwen2-VL-72B-a model with 36x more parameters. To assess cross-task generalization, we further evaluate Med-R1 on five question types. Med-R1 outperforms Qwen2-VL-2B by 32.06% in question-type generalization, also surpassing Qwen2-VL-72B. We further explore the thinking process in Med-R1, a crucial component for the success of Deepseek-R1. Our results show that omitting intermediate rationales (No-Thinking-Med-R1) not only improves in-domain and cross-domain generalization with less training, but also challenges the assumption that more reasoning always helps. These findings suggest that in medical VQA, it is not reasoning itself, but its quality and domain alignment, that determine effectiveness. Together, these results highlight that RL improves medical reasoning and generalization, enabling efficient and reliable VLMs for real-world deployment.

### ARCS: Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Code Synthesis with Iterative   Refinement
**Authors**: Manish Bhattarai, Miguel Cordova, Minh Vu, Javier Santos, Ismael Boureima, Dan O'Malley

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T15:23:02Z

**Summary**: We present Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Code Synthesis (ARCS), a system that improves LLM-based code generation without fine-tuning. ARCS operates through a budgeted synthesize-execute-repair loop over a frozen model: it retrieves relevant code context before generation, proposes candidates, executes them against tests, and repairs based on execution feedback. This retrieval-before-generation design reduces hallucination and accelerates convergence. We formalize ARCS as a state-action process with provable guarantees on termination, monotonic improvement, and bounded cost. A tiered controller (Small/Medium/Large) trades latency for accuracy predictably. On HumanEval, ARCS achieves up to 87.2% pass@1 with Llama-3.1-405B, surpassing CodeAgent (82.3%) while using simpler control than tree-search methods. On TransCoder, it achieves >= 90% accuracy on most translation pairs. On a LANL scientific corpus, it improves CodeBLEU by +0.115 over baseline RAG. ARCS provides a practical, reproducible approach to reliable code synthesis using existing LLM checkpoints.

### Towards Generalisable Foundation Models for 3D Brain MRI
**Authors**: Moona Mazher, Geoff J. M. Parker, Daniel C. Alexander

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T15:19:46Z

**Summary**: Foundation models in artificial intelligence (AI) are transforming medical imaging by enabling general-purpose feature learning from large-scale, unlabeled datasets. In this work, we introduce BrainFound, a self-supervised foundation model for brain MRI, built by extending DINO-v2, a vision transformer originally designed for 2D natural images. BrainFound adapts DINO-v2 to model full 3D brain anatomy by incorporating volumetric information from sequential MRI slices, moving beyond conventional single-slice paradigms. It supports both single- and multimodal inputs, enabling a broad range of downstream tasks, including disease detection and image segmentation, while generalising across varied imaging protocols and clinical scenarios. We show that BrainFound consistently outperforms existing self-supervised pretraining strategies and supervised baselines, particularly in label-scarce and multi-contrast settings. By integrating information from diverse 3D MRI modalities (e.g., T1, T2, FLAIR), it enhances diagnostic accuracy and reduces dependency on extensive expert annotations. This flexibility makes BrainFound a scalable and practical solution for 3D neuroimaging pipelines, with significant potential for clinical deployment and research innovation.

### How Can We Effectively Expand the Vocabulary of LLMs with 0.01GB of   Target Language Text?
**Authors**: Atsuki Yamaguchi, Aline Villavicencio, Nikolaos Aletras

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T15:19:39Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in many languages beyond English. Yet, LLMs require more inference steps when generating non-English text due to their reliance on English-centric tokenizers and vocabulary, resulting in higher usage costs to non-English speakers. Vocabulary expansion with target language tokens is a widely used cross-lingual vocabulary adaptation approach to remedy this issue. Despite its effectiveness in inference speedup, previous work on vocabulary expansion has focused on high-resource settings assuming access to a substantial amount of target language data to effectively initialize the embeddings of the new tokens and adapt the LLM to the target language. However, vocabulary expansion in low-resource settings has yet to be explored. In this article, we investigate vocabulary expansion in low-resource settings by considering embedding initialization methods and continual pre-training strategies. Through extensive experiments across typologically diverse languages, tasks and models, we establish a set of strategies to perform vocabulary expansion for faster inference, while striving to maintain competitive downstream performance to baselines. This is achieved with only 30K sentences ($\sim$0.01GB text data) from the target language.

### Eigen-Value: Efficient Domain-Robust Data Valuation via Eigenvalue-Based   Approach
**Authors**: Youngjun Choi, Joonseong Kang, Sungjun Lim, Kyungwoo Song

**Updated**: 2025-10-28T02:35:45Z

**Summary**: Data valuation has become central in the era of data-centric AI. It drives efficient training pipelines and enables objective pricing in data markets by assigning a numeric value to each data point. Most existing data valuation methods estimate the effect of removing individual data points by evaluating changes in model validation performance under in-distribution (ID) settings, as opposed to out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios where data follow different patterns. Since ID and OOD data behave differently, data valuation methods based on ID loss often fail to generalize to OOD settings, particularly when the validation set contains no OOD data. Furthermore, although OOD-aware methods exist, they involve heavy computational costs, which hinder practical deployment. To address these challenges, we introduce \emph{Eigen-Value} (EV), a plug-and-play data valuation framework for OOD robustness that uses only an ID data subset, including during validation. EV provides a new spectral approximation of domain discrepancy, which is the gap of loss between ID and OOD using ratios of eigenvalues of ID data's covariance matrix. EV then estimates the marginal contribution of each data point to this discrepancy via perturbation theory, alleviating the computational burden. Subsequently, EV plugs into ID loss-based methods by adding an EV term without any additional training loop. We demonstrate that EV achieves improved OOD robustness and stable value rankings across real-world datasets, while remaining computationally lightweight. These results indicate that EV is practical for large-scale settings with domain shift, offering an efficient path to OOD-robust data valuation.

### AutoStreamPipe: LLM Assisted Automatic Generation of Data Stream   Processing Pipelines
**Authors**: Abolfazl Younesi, Zahra Najafabadi Samani, Thomas Fahringer

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T15:11:31Z

**Summary**: Data pipelines are essential in stream processing as they enable the efficient collection, processing, and delivery of real-time data, supporting rapid data analysis. In this paper, we present AutoStreamPipe, a novel framework that employs Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the design, generation, and deployment of stream processing pipelines. AutoStreamPipe bridges the semantic gap between high-level user intent and platform-specific implementations across distributed stream processing systems for structured multi-agent reasoning by integrating a Hypergraph of Thoughts (HGoT) as an extended version of GoT. AutoStreamPipe combines resilient execution strategies, advanced query analysis, and HGoT to deliver pipelines with good accuracy. Experimental evaluations on diverse pipelines demonstrate that AutoStreamPipe significantly reduces development time (x6.3) and error rates (x5.19), as measured by a novel Error-Free Score (EFS), compared to LLM code-generation methods.

### The Complexity Trap: Simple Observation Masking Is as Efficient as LLM   Summarization for Agent Context Management
**Authors**: Tobias Lindenbauer, Igor Slinko, Ludwig Felder, Egor Bogomolov, Yaroslav Zharov

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T15:08:54Z

**Summary**: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents solve complex tasks through iterative reasoning, exploration, and tool-use, a process that can result in long, expensive context histories. While state-of-the-art Software Engineering (SE) agents like OpenHands or Cursor use LLM-based summarization to tackle this issue, it is unclear whether the increased complexity offers tangible performance benefits compared to simply omitting older observations. We present a systematic comparison of these approaches within SWE-agent on SWE-bench Verified across five diverse model configurations. Moreover, we show initial evidence of our findings generalizing to the OpenHands agent scaffold. We find that a simple environment observation masking strategy halves cost relative to the raw agent while matching, and sometimes slightly exceeding, the solve rate of LLM summarization. Additionally, we introduce a novel hybrid approach that further reduces costs by 7% and 11% compared to just observation masking or LLM summarization, respectively. Our findings raise concerns regarding the trend towards pure LLM summarization and provide initial evidence of untapped cost reductions by pushing the efficiency-effectiveness frontier. We release code and data for reproducibility.

### A Data-driven ML Approach for Maximizing Performance in LLM-Adapter   Serving
**Authors**: Ferran Agullo, Joan Oliveras, Chen Wang, Alberto Gutierrez-Torre, Olivier Tardieu, Alaa Youssef, Jordi Torres, Josep Ll. Berral

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T14:59:46Z

**Summary**: With the rapid adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs), LLM-adapters have become increasingly common, providing lightweight specialization of large-scale models. Serving hundreds or thousands of these adapters on a single GPU allows request aggregation, increasing throughput, but may also cause request starvation if GPU memory limits are exceeded. To address this issue, this study focuses on determining the joint configuration of concurrent and parallel adapters that maximizes GPU throughput without inducing starvation, given heterogeneous adapter and traffic properties. We propose a data-driven ML approach leveraging interpretable models to tackle this caching problem and introduce the first Digital Twin capable of reproducing an LLM-adapter serving system, enabling efficient training data generation. Experiments with the vLLM framework and LoRA adapters show that the Digital Twin reproduces throughput within 5.1% of real results, while the ML approach predicts optimal numbers of concurrent and parallel adapters with an error of at most 7.2% under heterogeneous, real-world workloads.

### EMTSF:Extraordinary Mixture of SOTA Models for Time Series Forecasting
**Authors**: Musleh Alharthi, Kaleel Mahmood, Sarosh Patel, Ausif Mahmood

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T14:55:30Z

**Summary**: The immense success of the Transformer architecture   in Natural Language Processing has led to its adoption in Time Se ries Forecasting (TSF), where superior performance has been shown.   However, a recent important paper questioned their effectiveness by   demonstrating that a simple single layer linear model outperforms   Transformer-based models. This was soon shown to be not as valid,   by a better transformer-based model termed PatchTST. More re cently, TimeLLM demonstrated even better results by repurposing a   Large Language Model (LLM) for the TSF domain. Again, a follow   up paper challenged this by demonstrating that removing the LLM   component or replacing it with a basic attention layer in fact yields   better performance. One of the challenges in forecasting is the fact   that TSF data favors the more recent past, and is sometimes subject   to unpredictable events. Based upon these recent insights in TSF, we   propose a strong Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework. Our method   combines the state-of-the-art (SOTA) models including xLSTM, en hanced Linear, PatchTST, and minGRU, among others. This set of   complimentary and diverse models for TSF are integrated in a Trans former based MoE gating network. Our proposed model outperforms   all existing TSF models on standard benchmarks, surpassing even the   latest approaches based on MoE frameworks.

### Detecting Religious Language in Climate Discourse
**Authors**: Evy Beijen, Pien Pieterse, Yusuf Çelik, Willem Th. van Peursen, Sandjai Bhulai, Meike Morren

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T14:54:51Z

**Summary**: Religious language continues to permeate contemporary discourse, even in ostensibly secular domains such as environmental activism and climate change debates. This paper investigates how explicit and implicit forms of religious language appear in climate-related texts produced by secular and religious nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). We introduce a dual methodological approach: a rule-based model using a hierarchical tree of religious terms derived from ecotheology literature, and large language models (LLMs) operating in a zero-shot setting. Using a dataset of more than 880,000 sentences, we compare how these methods detect religious language and analyze points of agreement and divergence. The results show that the rule-based method consistently labels more sentences as religious than LLMs. These findings highlight not only the methodological challenges of computationally detecting religious language but also the broader tension over whether religious language should be defined by vocabulary alone or by contextual meaning. This study contributes to digital methods in religious studies by demonstrating both the potential and the limitations of approaches for analyzing how the sacred persists in climate discourse.

### Controllable Collision Scenario Generation via Collision Pattern   Prediction
**Authors**: Pin-Lun Chen, Chi-Hsi Kung, Che-Han Chang, Wei-Chen Chiu, Yi-Ting Chen

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T14:53:32Z

**Summary**: Evaluating the safety of autonomous vehicles (AVs) requires diverse, safety-critical scenarios, with collisions being especially important yet rare and unsafe to collect in the real world. Therefore, the community has been focusing on generating safety-critical scenarios in simulation. However, controlling attributes such as collision type and time-to-accident (TTA) remains challenging. We introduce a new task called controllable collision scenario generation, where the goal is to produce trajectories that realize a user-specified collision type and TTA, to investigate the feasibility of automatically generating desired collision scenarios. To support this task, we present COLLIDE, a large-scale collision scenario dataset constructed by transforming real-world driving logs into diverse collisions, balanced across five representative collision types and different TTA intervals. We propose a framework that predicts Collision Pattern, a compact and interpretable representation that captures the spatial configuration of the ego and the adversarial vehicles at impact, before rolling out full adversarial trajectories. Experiments show that our approach outperforms strong baselines in both collision rate and controllability. Furthermore, generated scenarios consistently induce higher planner failure rates, revealing limitations of existing planners. We demonstrate that these scenarios fine-tune planners for robustness improvements, contributing to safer AV deployment in different collision scenarios.

### Unveiling m-Sharpness Through the Structure of Stochastic Gradient Noise
**Authors**: Haocheng Luo, Mehrtash Harandi, Dinh Phung, Trung Le

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T14:49:07Z

**Summary**: Sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) has emerged as a highly effective technique for improving model generalization, but its underlying principles are not fully understood. We investigated the phenomenon known as m-sharpness, where the performance of SAM improves monotonically as the micro-batch size for computing perturbations decreases. In practice, the empirical m-sharpness effect underpins the deployment of SAM in distributed training, yet a rigorous theoretical account has remained lacking. To provide a theoretical explanation for m-sharpness, we leverage an extended Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) framework and analyze the structure of stochastic gradient noise (SGN) to characterize the dynamics of various SAM variants, including n-SAM and m-SAM. Our findings reveal that the stochastic noise introduced during SAM perturbations inherently induces a variance-based sharpness regularization effect. Motivated by our theoretical insights, we introduce Reweighted SAM (RW-SAM), which employs sharpness-weighted sampling to mimic the generalization benefits of m-SAM while remaining parallelizable. Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our theoretical analysis and proposed method.

### Steering Evaluation-Aware Language Models to Act Like They Are Deployed
**Authors**: Tim Tian Hua, Andrew Qin, Samuel Marks, Neel Nanda

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T14:43:39Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) can sometimes detect when they are being evaluated and adjust their behavior to appear more aligned, compromising the reliability of safety evaluations. In this paper, we show that adding a steering vector to an LLM's activations can suppress evaluation-awareness and make the model act like it is deployed during evaluation. To study our steering technique, we train an LLM to exhibit evaluation-aware behavior using a two-step training process designed to mimic how this behavior could emerge naturally. First, we perform continued pretraining on documents with factual descriptions of the model (1) using Python type hints during evaluation but not during deployment and (2) recognizing that the presence of a certain evaluation cue always means that it is being tested. Then, we train the model with expert iteration to use Python type hints in evaluation settings. The resulting model is evaluation-aware: it writes type hints in evaluation contexts more than deployment contexts. We find that activation steering can suppress evaluation awareness and make the model act like it is deployed even when the cue is present. Importantly, we constructed our steering vector using the original model before our additional training. Our results suggest that AI evaluators could improve the reliability of safety evaluations by steering models to act like they are deployed.

### Floating-Point Neural Network Verification at the Software Level
**Authors**: Edoardo Manino, Bruno Farias, Rafael Sá Menezes, Fedor Shmarov, Lucas C. Cordeiro

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T14:43:19Z

**Summary**: The behaviour of neural network components must be proven correct before deployment in safety-critical systems. Unfortunately, existing neural network verification techniques cannot certify the absence of faults at the software level. In this paper, we show how to specify and verify that neural networks are safe, by explicitly reasoning about their floating-point implementation. In doing so, we construct NeuroCodeBench 2.0, a benchmark comprising 912 neural network verification examples that cover activation functions, common layers, and full neural networks of up to 170K parameters. Our verification suite is written in plain C and is compatible with the format of the International Competition on Software Verification (SV-COMP). Thanks to it, we can conduct the first rigorous evaluation of eight state-of-the-art software verifiers on neural network code. The results show that existing automated verification tools can correctly solve an average of 11% of our benchmark, while producing around 3% incorrect verdicts. At the same time, a historical analysis reveals that the release of our benchmark has already had a significantly positive impact on the latter.

### Estimating LLM Consistency: A User Baseline vs Surrogate Metrics
**Authors**: Xiaoyuan Wu, Weiran Lin, Omer Akgul, Lujo Bauer

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T14:42:01Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are prone to hallucinations and sensitiveto prompt perturbations, often resulting in inconsistent or unreliablegenerated text. Different methods have been proposed to mitigate suchhallucinations and fragility, one of which is to measure theconsistency of LLM responses -- the model's confidence in the responseor likelihood of generating a similar response when resampled. Inprevious work, measuring LLM response consistency often relied oncalculating the probability of a response appearing within a pool of resampledresponses, analyzing internal states, or evaluating logits of resopnses.However, it was not clear how well theseapproaches approximated users' perceptions of consistency of LLMresponses. To find out, we performed a user study ($n=2,976$)demonstrating that current methods for measuring LLM responseconsistency typically do not align well with humans' perceptions of LLMconsistency. We propose a logit-based ensemble method for estimatingLLM consistency and show that our method matches the performance of thebest-performing existing metric in estimating human ratings of LLMconsistency. Our results suggest that methods for estimating LLMconsistency without human evaluation are sufficiently imperfect towarrant broader use of evaluation with human input; this would avoidmisjudging the adequacy of models because of the imperfections ofautomated consistency metrics.

### NestedFP: High-Performance, Memory-Efficient Dual-Precision Floating   Point Support for LLMs
**Authors**: Haeun Lee, Omin Kwon, Yeonhong Park, Jae W. Lee

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T14:40:22Z

**Summary**: Meeting service-level objectives (SLOs) in Large Language Models (LLMs) serving is critical, but managing the high variability in load presents a significant challenge. Recent advancements in FP8 inference, backed by native hardware support, offer a potential solution: executing FP16 models by default, while switching to FP8 models during sudden load surges to achieve higher throughput at the cost of a slight quality degradation. Although this approach facilitates effective SLO management, it introduces additional memory overhead due to storing two versions of the same model. In response, this paper proposes NestedFP, an LLM serving technique that supports both FP16 and FP8 models in a memory efficient manner by overlaying FP8 parameters onto FP16 parameters, allowing both models to share the same FP16 memory footprint. By leveraging a compact data format for the overlay and a specialized GEMM kernel optimized for this format, NestedFP ensures minimal degradation in both model quality and inference throughput across both FP8 and FP16 modes. NestedFP provides a flexible platform for dynamic, SLO-aware precision selection. The code is available at https://github.com/SNU-ARC/NestedFP.

### Can Large Language Models Unlock Novel Scientific Research Ideas?
**Authors**: Sandeep Kumar, Tirthankar Ghosal, Vinayak Goyal, Asif Ekbal

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T14:39:52Z

**Summary**: The widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) and publicly available ChatGPT have marked a significant turning point in the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into people's everyday lives. This study examines the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate future research ideas from scientific papers. Unlike tasks such as summarization or translation, idea generation lacks a clearly defined reference set or structure, making manual evaluation the default standard. However, human evaluation in this setting is extremely challenging ie: it requires substantial domain expertise, contextual understanding of the paper, and awareness of the current research landscape. This makes it time-consuming, costly, and fundamentally non-scalable, particularly as new LLMs are being released at a rapid pace. Currently, there is no automated evaluation metric specifically designed for this task. To address this gap, we propose two automated evaluation metrics: Idea Alignment Score (IAScore) and Idea Distinctness Index. We further conducted human evaluation to assess the novelty, relevance, and feasibility of the generated future research ideas. This investigation offers insights into the evolving role of LLMs in idea generation, highlighting both its capability and limitations. Our work contributes to the ongoing efforts in evaluating and utilizing language models for generating future research ideas. We make our datasets and codes publicly available

### Symbolic Neural Generation with Applications to Lead Discovery in Drug   Design
**Authors**: Ashwin Srinivasan, A Baskar, Tirtharaj Dash, Michael Bain, Sanjay Kumar Dey, Mainak Banerjee

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T14:29:22Z

**Summary**: We investigate a relatively underexplored class of hybrid neurosymbolic models integrating symbolic learning with neural reasoning to construct data generators meeting formal correctness criteria. In \textit{Symbolic Neural Generators} (SNGs), symbolic learners examine logical specifications of feasible data from a small set of instances -- sometimes just one. Each specification in turn constrains the conditional information supplied to a neural-based generator, which rejects any instance violating the symbolic specification. Like other neurosymbolic approaches, SNG exploits the complementary strengths of symbolic and neural methods. The outcome of an SNG is a triple $(H, X, W)$, where $H$ is a symbolic description of feasible instances constructed from data, $X$ a set of generated new instances that satisfy the description, and $W$ an associated weight. We introduce a semantics for such systems, based on the construction of appropriate \textit{base} and \textit{fibre} partially-ordered sets combined into an overall partial order, and outline a probabilistic extension relevant to practical applications. In this extension, SNGs result from searching over a weighted partial ordering. We implement an SNG combining a restricted form of Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) with a large language model (LLM) and evaluate it on early-stage drug design. Our main interest is the description and the set of potential inhibitor molecules generated by the SNG. On benchmark problems -- where drug targets are well understood -- SNG performance is statistically comparable to state-of-the-art methods. On exploratory problems with poorly understood targets, generated molecules exhibit binding affinities on par with leading clinical candidates. Experts further find the symbolic specifications useful as preliminary filters, with several generated molecules identified as viable for synthesis and wet-lab testing.

### Reasoning as an Adaptive Defense for Safety
**Authors**: Taeyoun Kim, Fahim Tajwar, Aditi Raghunathan, Aviral Kumar

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T14:28:11Z

**Summary**: Reasoning methods that adaptively allocate test-time compute have advanced LLM performance on easy to verify domains such as math and code. In this work, we study how to utilize this approach to train models that exhibit a degree of robustness to safety vulnerabilities, and show that doing so can provide benefits. We build a recipe called $\textit{TARS}$ (Training Adaptive Reasoners for Safety), a reinforcement learning (RL) approach that trains models to reason about safety using chain-of-thought traces and a reward signal that balances safety with task completion. To build TARS, we identify three critical design choices: (1) a ``lightweight'' warmstart SFT stage, (2) a mix of harmful, harmless, and ambiguous prompts to prevent shortcut behaviors such as too many refusals, and (3) a reward function to prevent degeneration of reasoning capabilities during training. Models trained with TARS exhibit adaptive behaviors by spending more compute on ambiguous queries, leading to better safety-refusal trade-offs. They also internally learn to better distinguish between safe and unsafe prompts and attain greater robustness to both white-box (e.g., GCG) and black-box attacks (e.g., PAIR). Overall, our work provides an effective, open recipe for training LLMs against jailbreaks and harmful requests by reasoning per prompt.

### Are LLMs Empathetic to All? Investigating the Influence of   Multi-Demographic Personas on a Model's Empathy
**Authors**: Ananya Malik, Nazanin Sabri, Melissa Karnaze, Mai Elsherief

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T14:25:32Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models' (LLMs) ability to converse naturally is empowered by their ability to empathetically understand and respond to their users. However, emotional experiences are shaped by demographic and cultural contexts. This raises an important question: Can LLMs demonstrate equitable empathy across diverse user groups? We propose a framework to investigate how LLMs' cognitive and affective empathy vary across user personas defined by intersecting demographic attributes. Our study introduces a novel intersectional analysis spanning 315 unique personas, constructed from combinations of age, culture, and gender, across four LLMs. Results show that attributes profoundly shape a model's empathetic responses. Interestingly, we see that adding multiple attributes at once can attenuate and reverse expected empathy patterns. We show that they broadly reflect real-world empathetic trends, with notable misalignments for certain groups, such as those from Confucian culture. We complement our quantitative findings with qualitative insights to uncover model behaviour patterns across different demographic groups. Our findings highlight the importance of designing empathy-aware LLMs that account for demographic diversity to promote more inclusive and equitable model behaviour.

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T14:21:05Z

**Summary**: Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a powerful accelerator of materials discovery, yet most existing models remain problem-specific, requiring additional data collection and retraining for each new property. Here we introduce and validate GATE (Geometrically Aligned Transfer Encoder) -- a generalizable AI framework that jointly learns 34 physicochemical properties spanning thermal, electrical, mechanical, and optical domains. By aligning these properties within a shared geometric space, GATE captures cross-property correlations that reduce disjoint-property bias -- a key factor causing false negatives in multi-criteria screening. To demonstrate its generalizability, GATE -- without any problem-specific reconfiguration -- was directly applied to the discovery of immersion cooling fluids for data centers, a stringent real-world challenge defined by the Open Compute Project (OCP). Screening billions of candidates, GATE identified 92,861 molecules as promising for practical deployment. Four were experimentally or literarily validated, showing strong agreement with wet-lab measurements and performance comparable to or exceeding a commercial coolant. These results establish GATE as a ready-to-use, generalizable AI platform readily applicable across diverse materials discovery tasks.

### SimBench: Benchmarking the Ability of Large Language Models to Simulate   Human Behaviors
**Authors**: Tiancheng Hu, Joachim Baumann, Lorenzo Lupo, Nigel Collier, Dirk Hovy, Paul Röttger

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T14:17:13Z

**Summary**: Large language model (LLM) simulations of human behavior have the potential to revolutionize the social and behavioral sciences, if and only if they faithfully reflect real human behaviors. Current evaluations are fragmented, based on bespoke tasks and metrics, creating a patchwork of incomparable results. To address this, we introduce SimBench, the first large-scale, standardized benchmark for a robust, reproducible science of LLM simulation. By unifying 20 diverse datasets covering tasks from moral decision-making to economic choice across a large global participant pool, SimBench provides the necessary foundation to ask fundamental questions about when, how, and why LLM simulations succeed or fail. We show that, while even the best LLMs today have limited simulation ability (score: 40.80/100), performance scales log-linearly with model size. Simulation performance is not improved by increased inference-time compute. We demonstrate an alignment-simulation trade-off: instruction-tuning improves performance on low-entropy (consensus) questions but degrades it on high-entropy (diverse) ones. Models particularly struggle when simulating specific demographic groups. Finally, we demonstrate that simulation ability correlates most strongly with deep, knowledge-intensive reasoning (MMLU-Pro, r=0.939). By making progress measurable, we aim to accelerate the development of more faithful LLM simulators.

### MOOSE-Chem: Large Language Models for Rediscovering Unseen Chemistry   Scientific Hypotheses
**Authors**: Zonglin Yang, Wanhao Liu, Ben Gao, Tong Xie, Yuqiang Li, Wanli Ouyang, Soujanya Poria, Erik Cambria, Dongzhan Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T14:10:54Z

**Summary**: Scientific discovery plays a pivotal role in advancing human society, and recent progress in large language models (LLMs) suggests their potential to accelerate this process. However, it remains unclear whether LLMs can autonomously generate novel and valid hypotheses in chemistry. In this work, we investigate whether LLMs can discover high-quality chemistry hypotheses given only a research background-comprising a question and/or a survey-without restriction on the domain of the question. We begin with the observation that hypothesis discovery is a seemingly intractable task. To address this, we propose a formal mathematical decomposition grounded in a fundamental assumption: that most chemistry hypotheses can be composed from a research background and a set of inspirations. This decomposition leads to three practical subtasks-retrieving inspirations, composing hypotheses with inspirations, and ranking hypotheses - which together constitute a sufficient set of subtasks for the overall scientific discovery task. We further develop an agentic LLM framework, MOOSE-Chem, that is a direct implementation of this mathematical decomposition. To evaluate this framework, we construct a benchmark of 51 high-impact chemistry papers published and online after January 2024, each manually annotated by PhD chemists with background, inspirations, and hypothesis. The framework is able to rediscover many hypotheses with high similarity to the groundtruth, successfully capturing the core innovations-while ensuring no data contamination since it uses an LLM with knowledge cutoff date prior to 2024. Finally, based on LLM's surprisingly high accuracy on inspiration retrieval, a task with inherently out-of-distribution nature, we propose a bold assumption: that LLMs may already encode latent scientific knowledge associations not yet recognized by humans.

### How AI Forecasts AI Jobs: Benchmarking LLM Predictions of Labor Market   Changes
**Authors**: Sheri Osborn, Rohit Valecha, H. Raghav Rao, Dan Sass, Anthony Rios

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T14:08:27Z

**Summary**: Artificial intelligence is reshaping labor markets, yet we lack tools to systematically forecast its effects on employment. This paper introduces a benchmark for evaluating how well large language models (LLMs) can anticipate changes in job demand, especially in occupations affected by AI. Existing research has shown that LLMs can extract sentiment, summarize economic reports, and emulate forecaster behavior, but little work has assessed their use for forward-looking labor prediction. Our benchmark combines two complementary datasets: a high-frequency index of sector-level job postings in the United States, and a global dataset of projected occupational changes due to AI adoption. We format these data into forecasting tasks with clear temporal splits, minimizing the risk of information leakage. We then evaluate LLMs using multiple prompting strategies, comparing task-scaffolded, persona-driven, and hybrid approaches across model families. We assess both quantitative accuracy and qualitative consistency over time. Results show that structured task prompts consistently improve forecast stability, while persona prompts offer advantages on short-term trends. However, performance varies significantly across sectors and horizons, highlighting the need for domain-aware prompting and rigorous evaluation protocols. By releasing our benchmark, we aim to support future research on labor forecasting, prompt design, and LLM-based economic reasoning. This work contributes to a growing body of research on how LLMs interact with real-world economic data, and provides a reproducible testbed for studying the limits and opportunities of AI as a forecasting tool in the context of labor markets.

### Prompting is not Enough: Exploring Knowledge Integration and   Controllable Generation
**Authors**: Tingjia Shen, Hao Wang, Chuan Qin, Ruijun Sun, Yang Song, Defu Lian, Hengshu Zhu, Enhong Chen

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T14:08:24Z

**Summary**: Open-domain question answering (OpenQA) represents a cornerstone in natural language processing (NLP), primarily focused on extracting answers from unstructured textual data. With the rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), LLM-based OpenQA methods have reaped the benefits of emergent understanding and answering capabilities enabled by massive parameters compared to traditional methods. However, most of these methods encounter two critical challenges: how to integrate knowledge into LLMs effectively and how to adaptively generate results with specific answer formats for various task situations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework named GenKI, which aims to improve the OpenQA performance by exploring Knowledge Integration and controllable Generation on LLMs simultaneously. Specifically, we first train a dense passage retrieval model to retrieve associated knowledge from a given knowledge base. Subsequently, we introduce a novel knowledge integration model that incorporates the retrieval knowledge into instructions during fine-tuning to intensify the model. Furthermore, to enable controllable generation in LLMs, we leverage a certain fine-tuned LLM and an ensemble based on text consistency incorporating all coherence, fluency, and answer format assurance. Finally, extensive experiments conducted on the TriviaQA, MSMARCO, and CMRC2018 datasets, featuring diverse answer formats, have demonstrated the effectiveness of GenKI with comparison of state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, ablation studies have disclosed a linear relationship between the frequency of retrieved knowledge and the model's ability to recall knowledge accurately against the ground truth. Our code of GenKI is available at https://github.com/USTC-StarTeam/GenKI

**Authors**: Shaohan Bian, Ying Zhang, Guohui Tian, Zhiqiang Miao, Edmond Q. Wu, Simon X. Yang, Changchun Hua

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T14:06:40Z

**Summary**: With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) and robotics, service robots are increasingly becoming an integral part of daily life, offering a wide range of services in complex environments. To deliver these services intelligently and efficiently, robust and accurate task planning capabilities are essential. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of the integration of LLMs into service robotics, with a particular focus on their role in enhancing robotic task planning. First, the development and foundational techniques of LLMs, including pre-training, fine-tuning, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and prompt engineering, are reviewed. We then explore the application of LLMs as the cognitive core-`brain'-of service robots, discussing how LLMs contribute to improved autonomy and decision-making. Furthermore, recent advancements in LLM-driven task planning across various input modalities are analyzed, including text, visual, audio, and multimodal inputs. Finally, we summarize key challenges and limitations in current research and propose future directions to advance the task planning capabilities of service robots in complex, unstructured domestic environments. This review aims to serve as a valuable reference for researchers and practitioners in the fields of artificial intelligence and robotics.

### Validating Formal Specifications with LLM-generated Test Cases
**Authors**: Alcino Cunha, Nuno Macedo

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T14:02:20Z

**Summary**: Validation is a central activity when developing formal specifications. Similarly to coding, a possible validation technique is to define upfront test cases or scenarios that a future specification should satisfy or not. Unfortunately, specifying such test cases is burdensome and error prone, which could cause users to skip this validation task. This paper reports the results of an empirical evaluation of using pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to automate the generation of test cases from natural language requirements. In particular, we focus on test cases for structural requirements of simple domain models formalized in the Alloy specification language. Our evaluation focuses on the state-of-art GPT-5 model, but results from other closed- and open-source LLMs are also reported. The results show that, in this context, GPT-5 is already quite effective at generating positive (and negative) test cases that are syntactically correct and that satisfy (or not) the given requirement, and that can detect many wrong specifications written by humans.

### Block-Diagonal LoRA for Eliminating Communication Overhead in Tensor   Parallel LoRA Serving
**Authors**: Xinyu Wang, Jonas M. Kübler, Kailash Budhathoki, Yida Wang, Matthäus Kleindessner

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T14:01:29Z

**Summary**: When serving a single base LLM with several different LoRA adapters simultaneously, the adapters cannot simply be merged with the base model's weights as the adapter swapping would create overhead and requests using different adapters could not be batched. Rather, the LoRA computations have to be separated from the base LLM computations, and in a multi-device setup the LoRA adapters can be sharded in a way that is well aligned with the base model's tensor parallel execution, as proposed in S-LoRA. However, the S-LoRA sharding strategy encounters some communication overhead, which may be small in theory, but can be large in practice. In this paper, we propose to constrain certain LoRA factors to be block-diagonal, which allows for an alternative way of sharding LoRA adapters that does not require any additional communication for the LoRA computations. We demonstrate in extensive experiments that our block-diagonal LoRA approach is similarly parameter efficient as standard LoRA (i.e., for a similar number of parameters it achieves similar downstream performance) and that it leads to significant end-to-end speed-up over S-LoRA. For example, when serving on eight A100 GPUs, we observe up to 1.79x (1.23x) end-to-end speed-up with 0.87x (1.74x) the number of adapter parameters for Llama-3.1-70B, and up to 1.63x (1.3x) end-to-end speed-up with 0.86x (1.73x) the number of adapter parameters for Llama-3.1-8B.

### Towards Responsible AI: Advances in Safety, Fairness, and Accountability   of Autonomous Systems
**Authors**: Filip Cano

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T14:00:26Z

**Summary**: Ensuring responsible use of artificial intelligence (AI) has become imperative as autonomous systems increasingly influence critical societal domains. However, the concept of trustworthy AI remains broad and multi-faceted. This thesis advances knowledge in the safety, fairness, transparency, and accountability of AI systems. In safety, we extend classical deterministic shielding techniques to become resilient against delayed observations, enabling practical deployment in real-world conditions. We also implement both deterministic and probabilistic safety shields into simulated autonomous vehicles to prevent collisions with road users, validating the use of these techniques in realistic driving simulators. We introduce fairness shields, a novel post-processing approach to enforce group fairness in sequential decision-making settings over finite and periodic time horizons. By optimizing intervention costs while strictly ensuring fairness constraints, this method efficiently balances fairness with minimal interference. For transparency and accountability, we propose a formal framework for assessing intentional behaviour in probabilistic decision-making agents, introducing quantitative metrics of agency and intention quotient. We use these metrics to propose a retrospective analysis of intention, useful for determining responsibility when autonomous systems cause unintended harm. Finally, we unify these contributions through the ``reactive decision-making'' framework, providing a general formalization that consolidates previous approaches. Collectively, the advancements presented contribute practically to the realization of safer, fairer, and more accountable AI systems, laying the foundations for future research in trustworthy AI.

### TrajAgent: An LLM-Agent Framework for Trajectory Modeling via   Large-and-Small Model Collaboration
**Authors**: Yuwei Du, Jie Feng, Jie Zhao, Yong Li

**Updated**: 2025-10-28T04:18:04Z

**Summary**: Trajectory modeling, which includes research on trajectory data pattern mining and future prediction, has widespread applications in areas such as life services, urban transportation, and public administration. Numerous methods have been proposed to address specific problems within trajectory modeling. However, the heterogeneity of data and the diversity of trajectory tasks make effective and reliable trajectory modeling an important yet highly challenging endeavor, even for domain experts. In this paper, we propose TrajAgent, an agent framework powered by large language models, designed to facilitate robust and efficient trajectory modeling through automation modeling. This framework leverages and optimizes diverse specialized models to address various trajectory modeling tasks across different datasets effectively. In TrajAgent, we first develop UniEnv, an execution environment with a unified data and model interface, to support the execution and training of various models. Building on UniEnv, we introduce an agentic workflow designed for automatic trajectory modeling across various trajectory tasks and data. Furthermore, we introduce collaborative learning schema between LLM-based agents and small speciallized models, to enhance the performance of the whole framework effectively. Extensive experiments on five tasks using four real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of TrajAgent in automated trajectory modeling, achieving a performance improvement of 2.38%-69.91% over baseline methods. The codes and data can be accessed via https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/TrajAgent.

### Reciprocity Deficits: Observing AI in the street with everyday publics
**Authors**: Alex S. Taylor, Noortje Marres, Mercedes Bunz, Thao Phan, Maya Indira Ganesh, Dominique Barron, Yasmine Boudiaf, Rachel Coldicutt, Iain Emsley, Beatrice Gobbo, Louise Hickman, Bettina Nissen, Mukul Patel, Luis Soares

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T13:56:25Z

**Summary**: The street has emerged as a primary site where everyday publics are confronted with AI as an infrastructural phenomenon, as machine learning-based systems are now commonly deployed in this setting in the form of automated cars, facial recognition, smart billboards and the like. While these deployments of AI in the street have attracted significant media attention and public controversy in recent years, the presence of AI in the street often remains inscrutable, and many everyday publics are unaware of it. In this paper, we explore the challenges and possibilities of everyday public engagement with AI in the situated environment of city streets under these paradoxical conditions. Combining perspectives and approaches from social and cultural studies of AI, Design Research and Science and Technology Studies (STS), we explore the affordances of the street as a site for 'material participation' in AI through design-based interventions: the creation of 'everyday AI observatories.' We narrate and reflect on our participatory observations of AI in five city streets in the UK and Australia and highlight a set of tensions that emerged from them: 1) the framing of the street as a transactional environment, 2) the designed invisibility of AI and its publics in the street 3) the stratification of street environments through statistical governance. Based on this discussion and drawing on Jane Jacobs' notion of "eyes on the street," we put forward the relational notion of "reciprocity deficits" between AI infrastructures and everyday publics in the street. The conclusion reflects on the consequences of this form of social invisibility of AI for situated engagement with AI by everyday publics in the street and for public trust in urban governance.

### LightKGG: Simple and Efficient Knowledge Graph Generation from Textual   Data
**Authors**: Teng Lin

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T13:55:13Z

**Summary**: The scarcity of high-quality knowledge graphs (KGs) remains a critical bottleneck for downstream AI applications, as existing extraction methods rely heavily on error-prone pattern-matching techniques or resource-intensive large language models (LLMs). While recent tools leverage LLMs to generate KGs, their computational demands limit accessibility for low-resource environments. Our paper introduces LightKGG, a novel framework that enables efficient KG extraction from textual data using small-scale language models (SLMs) through two key technical innovations: (1) Context-integrated Graph extraction integrates contextual information with nodes and edges into a unified graph structure, reducing the reliance on complex semantic processing while maintaining more key information; (2) Topology-enhanced relationship inference leverages the inherent topology of the extracted graph to efficiently infer relationships, enabling relationship discovery without relying on complex language understanding capabilities of LLMs. By enabling accurate KG construction with minimal hardware requirements, this work bridges the gap between automated knowledge extraction and practical deployment scenarios while introducing scientifically rigorous methods for optimizing SLM efficiency in structured NLP tasks.

### LLMs can hide text in other text of the same length
**Authors**: Antonio Norelli, Michael Bronstein

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T13:54:40Z

**Summary**: A meaningful text can be hidden inside another, completely different yet still coherent and plausible, text of the same length. For example, a tweet containing a harsh political critique could be embedded in a tweet that celebrates the same political leader, or an ordinary product review could conceal a secret manuscript. This uncanny state of affairs is now possible thanks to Large Language Models, and in this paper we present a simple and efficient protocol to achieve it. We show that even modest 8-billion-parameter open-source LLMs are sufficient to obtain high-quality results, and a message as long as this abstract can be encoded and decoded locally on a laptop in seconds. The existence of such a protocol demonstrates a radical decoupling of text from authorial intent, further eroding trust in written communication, already shaken by the rise of LLM chatbots. We illustrate this with a concrete scenario: a company could covertly deploy an unfiltered LLM by encoding its answers within the compliant responses of a safe model. This possibility raises urgent questions for AI safety and challenges our understanding of what it means for a Large Language Model to know something.

### BaZi-Based Character Simulation Benchmark: Evaluating AI on Temporal and   Persona Reasoning
**Authors**: Siyuan Zheng, Pai Liu, Xi Chen, Jizheng Dong, Sihan Jia

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T13:51:13Z

**Summary**: Human-like virtual characters are crucial for games, storytelling, and virtual reality, yet current methods rely heavily on annotated data or handcrafted persona prompts, making it difficult to scale up and generate realistic, contextually coherent personas. We create the first QA dataset for BaZi-based persona reasoning, where real human experiences categorized into wealth, health, kinship, career, and relationships are represented as life-event questions and answers. Furthermore, we propose the first BaZi-LLM system that integrates symbolic reasoning with large language models to generate temporally dynamic and fine-grained virtual personas. Compared with mainstream LLMs such as DeepSeek-v3 and GPT-5-mini, our method achieves a 30.3%-62.6% accuracy improvement. In addition, when incorrect BaZi information is used, our model's accuracy drops by 20%-45%, showing the potential of culturally grounded symbolic-LLM integration for realistic character simulation.

### Adaptive Blockwise Search: Inference-Time Alignment for Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Mohammad Atif Quamar, Mohammad Areeb, Nishant Sharma, Ananth Shreekumar, Jonathan Rosenthal, Muslum Ozgur Ozmen, Mikhail Kuznetsov, Z. Berkay Celik

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T13:48:59Z

**Summary**: LLM alignment remains a critical challenge. Inference-time methods provide a flexible alternative to fine-tuning, but their uniform computational effort often yields suboptimal alignment. We hypothesize that for many alignment tasks, the initial tokens of a response are disproportionately more critical. To leverage this principle, we introduce AdaSearch, a novel blockwise search strategy. It adaptively allocates a fixed computational budget using a sampling schedule, focusing search effort on these critical tokens. We apply AdaSearch to sequential decoding and introduce its tree-search counterpart, AdaBeam. Our comprehensive evaluation across eight LLMs demonstrates that AdaSearch outperforms strong Best-of-N and fine-tuning baselines. Specifically, win-rates improve by over 10% for harmlessness generation, controlled sentiment generation, and for mathematical reasoning tasks relative to Best-of-N.

### Partnering with Generative AI: Experimental Evaluation of Human-Led and   Model-Led Interaction in Human-AI Co-Creation
**Authors**: Sebastian Maier, Manuel Schneider, Stefan Feuerriegel

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T13:41:33Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) show strong potential to support creative tasks, but the role of the interface design is poorly understood. In particular, the effect of different modes of collaboration between humans and LLMs on co-creation outcomes is unclear. To test this, we conducted a randomized controlled experiment ($N = 486$) comparing: (a) two variants of reflective, human-led modes in which the LLM elicits elaboration through suggestions or questions, against (b) a proactive, model-led mode in which the LLM independently rewrites ideas. By assessing the effects on idea quality, diversity, and perceived ownership, we found that the model-led mode substantially improved idea quality but reduced idea diversity and users' perceived idea ownership. The reflective, human-led mode also improved idea quality, yet while preserving diversity and ownership. Our findings highlight the importance of designing interactions with generative AI systems as reflective thought partners that complement human strengths and augment creative processes.

### Noise-corrected GRPO: From Noisy Rewards to Unbiased Gradients
**Authors**: Omar El Mansouri, Mohamed El Amine Seddik, Salem Lahlou

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T13:24:50Z

**Summary**: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) or verifiable rewards (RLVR), the standard paradigm for aligning LLMs or building recent SOTA reasoning models, is highly sensitive to noise from inconsistent or erroneous rewards. Yet, the interaction between such noise and widely used group-based policy optimization methods remains underexplored. We introduce a noise-robust Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and Done Right GRPO (Dr.GRPO) framework that explicitly models reward corruption as Bernoulli noise. Our method applies noise correction after estimating reward flip probabilities to debias the learning signal, yielding provably unbiased gradient estimates. Theoretical analysis shows that group-based methods inherently mitigate individual-level noise, and our correction strategy amplifies this robustness. Empirically, we observe consistent improvements across math and code tasks when applying our noise correction to standard reward model usage, with particular gains of up to 6.7 percentage points in accuracy on math tasks and 1.5 on code tasks under realistic reward model conditions. This work bridges label-noise correction from supervised learning with modern RLHF, offering both theoretical insights and a practical algorithm for noisy real-world deployment.

### Network Intrusion Detection: Evolution from Conventional Approaches to   LLM Collaboration and Emerging Risks
**Authors**: Yaokai Feng, Kouichi Sakurai

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T13:21:32Z

**Summary**: This survey systematizes the evolution of network intrusion detection systems (NIDS), from conventional methods such as signature-based and neural network (NN)-based approaches to recent integrations with large language models (LLMs). It clearly and concisely summarizes the current status, strengths, and limitations of conventional techniques, and explores the practical benefits of integrating LLMs into NIDS. Recent research on the application of LLMs to NIDS in diverse environments is reviewed, including conventional network infrastructures, autonomous vehicle environments and IoT environments.   From this survey, readers will learn that: 1) the earliest methods, signature-based IDSs, continue to make significant contributions to modern systems, despite their well-known weaknesses; 2) NN-based detection, although considered promising and under development for more than two decades, and despite numerous related approaches, still faces significant challenges in practical deployment; 3) LLMs are useful for NIDS in many cases, and a number of related approaches have been proposed; however, they still face significant challenges in practical applications. Moreover, they can even be exploited as offensive tools, such as for generating malware, crafting phishing messages, or launching cyberattacks. Recently, several studies have been proposed to address these challenges, which are also reviewed in this survey; and 4) strategies for constructing domain-specific LLMs have been proposed and are outlined in this survey, as it is nearly impossible to train a NIDS-specific LLM from scratch.

**Authors**: Kamil Wojcicki, Yusuf Ziya Isik, Laura Lechler, Mansur Yesilbursa, Ivana Balić, Wolfgang Mack, Rafał Łaganowski, Guoqing Zhang, Yossi Adi, Minje Kim, Shinji Watanabe

**Updated**: 2025-10-28T03:07:28Z

**Summary**: While recent neural audio codecs deliver superior speech quality at ultralow bitrates over traditional methods, their practical adoption is hindered by obstacles related to low-resource operation and robustness to acoustic distortions. Edge deployment scenarios demand codecs that operate under stringent compute constraints while maintaining low latency and bitrate. The presence of background noise and reverberation further necessitates designs that are resilient to such degradations. The performance of neural codecs under these constraints and their integration with speech enhancement remain largely unaddressed. To catalyze progress in this area, we introduce the 2025 Low-Resource Audio Codec Challenge, which targets the development of neural and hybrid codecs for resource-constrained applications. Participants are supported with a standardized training dataset, two baseline systems, and a comprehensive evaluation framework. The challenge is expected to yield valuable insights applicable to both codec design and related downstream audio tasks.

### MOOSE-Chem2: Exploring LLM Limits in Fine-Grained Scientific Hypothesis   Discovery via Hierarchical Search
**Authors**: Zonglin Yang, Wanhao Liu, Ben Gao, Yujie Liu, Wei Li, Tong Xie, Lidong Bing, Wanli Ouyang, Erik Cambria, Dongzhan Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T13:16:36Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in automating scientific hypothesis generation, yet existing approaches primarily yield coarse-grained hypotheses lacking critical methodological and experimental details. We introduce and formally define the new task of fine-grained scientific hypothesis discovery, which entails generating detailed, experimentally actionable hypotheses from coarse initial research directions. We frame this as a combinatorial optimization problem and investigate the upper limits of LLMs' capacity to solve it when maximally leveraged. Specifically, we explore four foundational questions: (1) how to best harness an LLM's internal heuristics to formulate the fine-grained hypothesis it itself would judge as the most promising among all the possible hypotheses it might generate, based on its own internal scoring-thus defining a latent reward landscape over the hypothesis space; (2) whether such LLM-judged better hypotheses exhibit stronger alignment with ground-truth hypotheses; (3) whether shaping the reward landscape using an ensemble of diverse LLMs of similar capacity yields better outcomes than defining it with repeated instances of the strongest LLM among them; and (4) whether an ensemble of identical LLMs provides a more reliable reward landscape than a single LLM. To address these questions, we propose a hierarchical search method that incrementally proposes and integrates details into the hypothesis, progressing from general concepts to specific experimental configurations. We show that this hierarchical process smooths the reward landscape and enables more effective optimization. Empirical evaluations on a new benchmark of expert-annotated fine-grained hypotheses from recent literature show that our method consistently outperforms strong baselines.

### TaoSR1: The Thinking Model for E-commerce Relevance Search
**Authors**: Chenhe Dong, Shaowei Yao, Pengkun Jiao, Jianhui Yang, Yiming Jin, Zerui Huang, Xiaojiang Zhou, Dan Ou, Haihong Tang, Bo Zheng

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T13:03:18Z

**Summary**: Query-product relevance prediction is a core task in e-commerce search. BERT-based models excel at semantic matching but lack complex reasoning capabilities. While Large Language Models (LLMs) are explored, most still use discriminative fine-tuning or distill to smaller models for deployment. We propose a framework to directly deploy LLMs for this task, addressing key challenges: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) error accumulation, discriminative hallucination, and deployment feasibility. Our framework, TaoSR1, involves three stages: (1) Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with CoT to instill reasoning; (2) Offline sampling with a pass@N strategy and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to improve generation quality; and (3) Difficulty-based dynamic sampling with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to mitigate discriminative hallucination. Additionally, post-CoT processing and a cumulative probability-based partitioning method enable efficient online deployment. TaoSR1 significantly outperforms baselines on offline datasets and achieves substantial gains in online side-by-side human evaluations, introducing a novel paradigm for applying CoT reasoning to relevance classification.

**Authors**: Benjamin F. Maier, Ulf Aslak, Luca Fiaschi, Nina Rismal, Kemble Fletcher, Christian C. Luhmann, Robbie Dow, Kli Pappas, Thomas V. Wiecki

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T12:39:25Z

**Summary**: Consumer research costs companies billions annually yet suffers from panel biases and limited scale. Large language models (LLMs) offer an alternative by simulating synthetic consumers, but produce unrealistic response distributions when asked directly for numerical ratings. We present semantic similarity rating (SSR), a method that elicits textual responses from LLMs and maps these to Likert distributions using embedding similarity to reference statements. Testing on an extensive dataset comprising 57 personal care product surveys conducted by a leading corporation in that market (9,300 human responses), SSR achieves 90% of human test-retest reliability while maintaining realistic response distributions (KS similarity > 0.85). Additionally, these synthetic respondents provide rich qualitative feedback explaining their ratings. This framework enables scalable consumer research simulations while preserving traditional survey metrics and interpretability.

### Thought Anchors: Which LLM Reasoning Steps Matter?
**Authors**: Paul C. Bogdan, Uzay Macar, Neel Nanda, Arthur Conmy

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T12:36:23Z

**Summary**: Current frontier large-language models rely on reasoning to achieve state-of-the-art performance. Many existing interpretability are limited in this area, as standard methods have been designed to study single forward passes of a model rather than the multi-token computational steps that unfold during reasoning. We argue that analyzing reasoning traces at the sentence level is a promising approach to understanding reasoning processes. We introduce a black-box method that measures each sentence's counterfactual importance by repeatedly sampling replacement sentences from the model, filtering for semantically different ones, and continuing the chain of thought from that point onwards to quantify the sentence's impact on the distribution of final answers. We discover that certain sentences can have an outsized impact on the trajectory of the reasoning trace and final answer. We term these sentences \textit{thought anchors}. These are generally planning or uncertainty management sentences, and specialized attention heads consistently attend from subsequent sentences to thought anchors. We further show that examining sentence-sentence causal links within a reasoning trace gives insight into a model's behavior. Such information can be used to predict a problem's difficulty and the extent different question domains involve sequential or diffuse reasoning. As a proof-of-concept, we demonstrate that our techniques together provide a practical toolkit for analyzing reasoning models by conducting a detailed case study of how the model solves a difficult math problem, finding that our techniques yield a consistent picture of the reasoning trace's structure. We provide an open-source tool (thought-anchors.com) for visualizing the outputs of our methods on further problems. The convergence across our methods shows the potential of sentence-level analysis for a deeper understanding of reasoning models.

### Code Aesthetics with Agentic Reward Feedback
**Authors**: Bang Xiao, Lingjie Jiang, Shaohan Huang, Tengchao Lv, Yupan Huang, Xun Wu, Lei Cui, Furu Wei

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T12:32:33Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become valuable assistants for developers in code-related tasks. While LLMs excel at traditional programming tasks such as code generation and bug fixing, they struggle with visually-oriented coding tasks, often producing suboptimal aesthetics. In this paper, we introduce a new pipeline to enhance the aesthetic quality of LLM-generated code. We first construct AesCode-358K, a large-scale instruction-tuning dataset focused on code aesthetics. Next, we propose agentic reward feedback, a multi-agent system that evaluates executability, static aesthetics, and interactive aesthetics. Building on this, we develop GRPO-AR, which integrates these signals into the GRPO algorithm for joint optimization of functionality and code aesthetics. Finally, we develop OpenDesign, a benchmark for assessing code aesthetics. Experimental results show that combining supervised fine-tuning on AesCode-358K with reinforcement learning using agentic reward feedback significantly improves performance on OpenDesign and also enhances results on existing benchmarks such as PandasPlotBench. Notably, our AesCoder-4B surpasses GPT-4o and GPT-4.1, and achieves performance comparable to large open-source models with 480B-685B parameters, underscoring the effectiveness of our approach.

### Code Digital Twin: Empowering LLMs with Tacit Knowledge for Complex   Software Development
**Authors**: Xin Peng, Chong Wang

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T12:13:29Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in software engineering tasks, raising expectations of revolutionary productivity gains. However, enterprise software development is largely driven by incremental evolution, where challenges extend far beyond routine coding and depend critically on tacit knowledge, including design decisions at different levels and historical trade-offs. To achieve effective AI-powered support for complex software development, we should align emerging AI capabilities with the practical realities of enterprise development. To this end, we systematically identify challenges from both software and LLM perspectives. Alongside these challenges, we outline opportunities where AI and structured knowledge frameworks can enhance decision-making in tasks such as issue localization and impact analysis. To address these needs, we propose the Code Digital Twin, a living framework that models both the physical and conceptual layers of software, preserves tacit knowledge, and co-evolves with the codebase. By integrating hybrid knowledge representations, multi-stage extraction pipelines, incremental updates, LLM-empowered applications, and human-in-the-loop feedback, the Code Digital Twin transforms fragmented knowledge into explicit and actionable representations. Our vision positions it as a bridge between AI advancements and enterprise software realities, providing a concrete roadmap toward sustainable, intelligent, and resilient development and evolution of ultra-complex systems.

### WikiDBGraph: A Data Management Benchmark Suite for Collaborative   Learning over Database Silos
**Authors**: Zhaomin Wu, Ziyang Wang, Bingsheng He

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T12:12:05Z

**Summary**: Relational databases are often fragmented across organizations, creating data silos that hinder distributed data management and mining. Collaborative learning (CL) -- techniques that enable multiple parties to train models jointly without sharing raw data -- offers a principled approach to this challenge. However, existing CL frameworks (e.g., federated and split learning) remain limited in real-world deployments. Current CL benchmarks and algorithms primarily target the learning step under assumptions of isolated, aligned, and joinable databases, and they typically neglect the end-to-end data management pipeline, especially preprocessing steps such as table joins and data alignment. In contrast, our analysis of the real-world corpus WikiDBs shows that databases are interconnected, unaligned, and sometimes unjoinable, exposing a significant gap between CL algorithm design and practical deployment. To close this evaluation gap, we build WikiDBGraph, a large-scale dataset constructed from 100{,}000 real-world relational databases linked by 17 million weighted edges. Each node (database) and edge (relationship) is annotated with 13 and 12 properties, respectively, capturing a hybrid of instance- and feature-level overlap across databases. Experiments on WikiDBGraph demonstrate both the effectiveness and limitations of existing CL methods under realistic conditions, highlighting previously overlooked gaps in managing real-world data silos and pointing to concrete directions for practical deployment of collaborative learning systems.

### Multi-Stakeholder Alignment in LLM-Powered Collaborative AI Systems: A   Multi-Agent Framework for Intelligent Tutoring
**Authors**: Alexandre P Uchoa, Carlo E T Oliveira, Claudia L R Motta, Daniel Schneider

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T12:06:27Z

**Summary**: The integration of Large Language Models into Intelligent Tutoring Systems pre-sents significant challenges in aligning with diverse and often conflicting values from students, parents, teachers, and institutions. Existing architectures lack for-mal mechanisms for negotiating these multi-stakeholder tensions, creating risks in accountability and bias. This paper introduces the Advisory Governance Layer (AGL), a non-intrusive, multi-agent framework designed to enable distributed stakeholder participation in AI governance. The AGL employs specialized agents representing stakeholder groups to evaluate pedagogical actions against their spe-cific policies in a privacy-preserving manner, anticipating future advances in per-sonal assistant technology that will enhance stakeholder value expression. Through a novel policy taxonomy and conflict-resolution protocols, the frame-work provides structured, auditable governance advice to the ITS without altering its core pedagogical decision-making. This work contributes a reference architec-ture and technical specifications for aligning educational AI with multi-stakeholder values, bridging the gap between high-level ethical principles and practical implementation.

### SBAN: A Framework & Multi-Dimensional Dataset for Large Language Model   Pre-Training and Software Code Mining
**Authors**: Hamed Jelodar, Mohammad Meymani, Samita Bai, Roozbeh Razavi-Far, Ali A. Ghorbani

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T12:01:51Z

**Summary**: This paper introduces SBAN (Source code, Binary, Assembly, and Natural Language Description), a large-scale, multi-dimensional dataset designed to advance the pre-training and evaluation of large language models (LLMs) for software code analysis. SBAN comprises more than 3 million samples, including 2.9 million benign and 672,000 malware respectively, each represented across four complementary layers: binary code, assembly instructions, natural language descriptions, and source code. This unique multimodal structure enables research on cross-representation learning, semantic understanding of software, and automated malware detection. Beyond security applications, SBAN supports broader tasks such as code translation, code explanation, and other software mining tasks involving heterogeneous data. It is particularly suited for scalable training of deep models, including transformers and other LLM architectures. By bridging low-level machine representations and high-level human semantics, SBAN provides a robust foundation for building intelligent systems that reason about code. We believe that this dataset opens new opportunities for mining software behavior, improving security analytics, and enhancing LLM capabilities in pre-training and fine-tuning tasks for software code mining.

### When Personalization Meets Reality: A Multi-Faceted Analysis of   Personalized Preference Learning
**Authors**: Yijiang River Dong, Tiancheng Hu, Yinhong Liu, Ahmet Üstün, Nigel Collier

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T11:53:22Z

**Summary**: While Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is widely used to align Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences, it typically assumes homogeneous preferences across users, overlooking diverse human values and minority viewpoints. Although personalized preference learning addresses this by tailoring separate preferences for individual users, the field lacks standardized methods to assess its effectiveness. We present a multi-faceted evaluation framework that measures not only performance but also fairness, unintended effects, and adaptability across varying levels of preference divergence. Through extensive experiments comparing eight personalization methods across three preference datasets, we demonstrate that performance differences between methods could reach 36% when users strongly disagree, and personalization can introduce up to 20% safety misalignment. These findings highlight the critical need for holistic evaluation approaches to advance the development of more effective and inclusive preference learning systems.

### Input Matters: Evaluating Input Structure's Impact on LLM Summaries of   Sports Play-by-Play
**Authors**: Barkavi Sundararajan, Somayajulu Sripada, Ehud Reiter

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T11:49:08Z

**Summary**: A major concern when deploying LLMs in accuracy-critical domains such as sports reporting is that the generated text may not faithfully reflect the input data. We quantify how input structure affects hallucinations and other factual errors in LLM-generated summaries of NBA play-by-play data, across three formats: row-structured, JSON and unstructured. We manually annotated 3,312 factual errors across 180 game summaries produced by two models, Llama-3.1-70B and Qwen2.5-72B. Input structure has a strong effect: JSON input reduces error rates by 69% for Llama and 65% for Qwen compared to unstructured input, while row-structured input reduces errors by 54% for Llama and 51% for Qwen. A two-way repeated measures ANOVA shows that input structure accounts for over 80% of the variance in error rates, with Tukey HSD post hoc tests confirming statistically significant differences between all input formats.

### Secure and Confidential Certificates of Online Fairness
**Authors**: Olive Franzese, Ali Shahin Shamsabadi, Carter Luck, Hamed Haddadi

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T11:37:07Z

**Summary**: The black-box service model enables ML service providers to serve clients while keeping their intellectual property and client data confidential. Confidentiality is critical for delivering ML services legally and responsibly, but makes it difficult for outside parties to verify important model properties such as fairness. Existing methods that assess model fairness confidentially lack either (i) reliability because they certify fairness with respect to a static set of data, and therefore fail to guarantee fairness in the presence of distribution shift or service provider malfeasance; and/or (ii) scalability due to the computational overhead of confidentiality-preserving cryptographic primitives. We address these problems by introducing online fairness certificates, which verify that a model is fair with respect to data received by the service provider online during deployment. We then present OATH, a deployably efficient and scalable zero-knowledge proof protocol for confidential online group fairness certification. OATH exploits statistical properties of group fairness via a cut-and-choose style protocol, enabling scalability improvements over baselines.

### LinearRAG: Linear Graph Retrieval Augmented Generation on Large-scale   Corpora
**Authors**: Luyao Zhuang, Shengyuan Chen, Yilin Xiao, Huachi Zhou, Yujing Zhang, Hao Chen, Qinggang Zhang, Xiao Huang

**Updated**: 2025-10-28T07:51:04Z

**Summary**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is widely used to mitigate hallucinations of Large Language Models (LLMs) by leveraging external knowledge. While effective for simple queries, traditional RAG systems struggle with large-scale, unstructured corpora where information is fragmented. Recent advances incorporate knowledge graphs to capture relational structures, enabling more comprehensive retrieval for complex, multi-hop reasoning tasks. However, existing graph-based RAG (GraphRAG) methods rely on unstable and costly relation extraction for graph construction, often producing noisy graphs with incorrect or inconsistent relations that degrade retrieval quality. In this paper, we revisit the pipeline of existing GraphRAG systems and propose LinearRAG (Linear Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation), an efficient framework that enables reliable graph construction and precise passage retrieval. Specifically, LinearRAG constructs a relation-free hierarchical graph, termed Tri-Graph, using only lightweight entity extraction and semantic linking, avoiding unstable relation modeling. This new paradigm of graph construction scales linearly with corpus size and incurs no extra token consumption, providing an economical and reliable indexing of the original passages. For retrieval, LinearRAG adopts a two-stage strategy: (i) relevant entity activation via local semantic bridging, followed by (ii) passage retrieval through global importance aggregation. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate that LinearRAG significantly outperforms baseline models. Our code and datasets are available at https://github.com/DEEP-PolyU/LinearRAG.

### Multi-turn Training with Basic Human Feedback Helps Little on LLM   Reasoning
**Authors**: Qiang Liu, Wuganjing Song, Zhenzhou Lin, Feifan Chen, Qiaolong Cai, Chen Li, Yongduo Sui

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T11:23:40Z

**Summary**: The reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically developed through the single-turn reinforcement learning, whereas real-world applications often involve multi-turn interactions with human feedback, leading to a potential mismatch between training and deployment conditions. In this work, we study whether multi-turn training with human feedback is necessary for reasoning tasks. We compare conventional single-turn training with three multi-turn strategies and reach contrary conclusions to previous research. We find that models trained in a single-turn setting generalize effectively to both single- and multi-turn evaluations, while models trained with multi-turn strategies exhibit a significant degradation in single-turn reasoning performance. These results suggest that for tasks with complete information, robust single-turn training remains more effective and reliable, as multi-turn training with basic feedback provides limited benefits and can even degrade reasoning capabilities.

### A Guardrail for Safety Preservation: When Safety-Sensitive Subspace   Meets Harmful-Resistant Null-Space
**Authors**: Bingjie Zhang, Yibo Yang, Zhe Ren, Dandan Guo, Jindong Gu, Philip Torr, Bernard Ghanem

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T11:11:28Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in diverse tasks, yet their safety alignment remains fragile during adaptation. Even when fine-tuning on benign data or with low-rank adaptation, pre-trained safety behaviors are easily degraded, leading to harmful responses in the fine-tuned models. To address this challenge, we propose GuardSpace, a guardrail framework for preserving safety alignment throughout fine-tuning, composed of two key components: a safety-sensitive subspace and a harmful-resistant null space. First, we explicitly decompose pre-trained weights into safety-relevant and safety-irrelevant components using covariance-preconditioned singular value decomposition, and initialize low-rank adapters from the safety-irrelevant ones, while freezing safety-relevant components to preserve their associated safety mechanism. Second, we construct a null space projector that restricts adapter updates from altering safe outputs on harmful prompts, thereby maintaining the original refusal behavior. Experiments with various pre-trained models on multiple downstream tasks demonstrate that GuardSpace achieves superior performance over existing methods. Notably, for Llama-2-7B-Chat fine-tuned on GSM8K, GuardSpace outperforms the state-of-the-art method AsFT, reducing the average harmful score from 14.4% to 3.6%, while improving the accuracy from from 26.0% to 28.0%.

### Cohort Discovery: A Survey on LLM-Assisted Clinical Trial Recruitment
**Authors**: Shrestha Ghosh, Moritz Schneider, Carina Reinicke, Carsten Eickhoff

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T10:59:03Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in LLMs have greatly improved general-domain NLP tasks. Yet, their adoption in critical domains, such as clinical trial recruitment, remains limited. As trials are designed in natural language and patient data is represented as both structured and unstructured text, the task of matching trials and patients benefits from knowledge aggregation and reasoning abilities of LLMs. Classical approaches are trial-specific and LLMs with their ability to consolidate distributed knowledge hold the potential to build a more general solution. Yet recent applications of LLM-assisted methods rely on proprietary models and weak evaluation benchmarks. In this survey, we are the first to analyze the task of trial-patient matching and contextualize emerging LLM-based approaches in clinical trial recruitment. We critically examine existing benchmarks, approaches and evaluation frameworks, the challenges to adopting LLM technologies in clinical research and exciting future directions.

### Increasing LLM Coding Capabilities through Diverse Synthetic Coding   Tasks
**Authors**: Amal Abed, Ivan Lukic, Jörg K. H. Franke, Frank Hutter

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T10:54:25Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive promise in code generation, yet their progress remains limited by the shortage of large-scale datasets that are both diverse and well-aligned with human reasoning. Most existing resources pair problems with solutions, but omit the intermediate thought process that guides coding. To close this gap, we present a scalable synthetic data generation pipeline that produces nearly 800k instruction-reasoning-code-test quadruplets. Each sample combines a task, a step-by-step reasoning trace, a working solution, and executable tests, enabling models to learn not just the what but also the how of problem solving. Our pipeline combines four key components: curated contest problems, web-mined content filtered by relevance classifiers, data expansion guided by reasoning patterns, and multi-stage execution-based validation. A genetic mutation algorithm further increases task diversity while maintaining consistency between reasoning traces and code implementations. Our key finding is that fine-tuning LLMs on this dataset yields consistent improvements on coding benchmarks. Beyond raw accuracy, reasoning-aware data can substitute for model scaling, generalize across architectures, and outperform leading open-source alternatives under identical sample budgets. Our work establishes reasoning-centered synthetic data generation as an efficient approach for advancing coding capabilities in LLMs. We publish our dataset and generation pipeline to facilitate further research.

### VR-Drive: Viewpoint-Robust End-to-End Driving with Feed-Forward 3D   Gaussian Splatting
**Authors**: Hoonhee Cho, Jae-Young Kang, Giwon Lee, Hyemin Yang, Heejun Park, Seokwoo Jung, Kuk-Jin Yoon

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T10:49:39Z

**Summary**: End-to-end autonomous driving (E2E-AD) has emerged as a promising paradigm that unifies perception, prediction, and planning into a holistic, data-driven framework. However, achieving robustness to varying camera viewpoints, a common real-world challenge due to diverse vehicle configurations, remains an open problem. In this work, we propose VR-Drive, a novel E2E-AD framework that addresses viewpoint generalization by jointly learning 3D scene reconstruction as an auxiliary task to enable planning-aware view synthesis. Unlike prior scene-specific synthesis approaches, VR-Drive adopts a feed-forward inference strategy that supports online training-time augmentation from sparse views without additional annotations. To further improve viewpoint consistency, we introduce a viewpoint-mixed memory bank that facilitates temporal interaction across multiple viewpoints and a viewpoint-consistent distillation strategy that transfers knowledge from original to synthesized views. Trained in a fully end-to-end manner, VR-Drive effectively mitigates synthesis-induced noise and improves planning under viewpoint shifts. In addition, we release a new benchmark dataset to evaluate E2E-AD performance under novel camera viewpoints, enabling comprehensive analysis. Our results demonstrate that VR-Drive is a scalable and robust solution for the real-world deployment of end-to-end autonomous driving systems.

### Neural Networks for AC Optimal Power Flow: Improving Worst-Case   Guarantees during Training
**Authors**: Bastien Giraud, Rahul Nellikath, Johanna Vorwerk, Maad Alowaifeer, Spyros Chatzivasileiadis

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T10:32:56Z

**Summary**: The AC Optimal Power Flow (AC-OPF) problem is central to power system operation but challenging to solve efficiently due to its nonconvex and nonlinear nature. Neural networks (NNs) offer fast surrogates, yet their black-box behavior raises concerns about constraint violations that can compromise safety. We propose a verification-informed NN framework that incorporates worst-case constraint violations directly into training, producing models that are both accurate and provably safer. Through post-hoc verification, we achieve substantial reductions in worst-case violations and, for the first time, verify all operational constraints of large-scale AC-OPF proxies. Practical feasibility is further enhanced via restoration and warm-start strategies for infeasible operating points. Experiments on systems ranging from 57 to 793 buses demonstrate scalability, speed, and reliability, bridging the gap between ML acceleration and safe, real-time deployment of AC-OPF solutions - and paving the way toward data-driven optimal control.

### GVPO: Group Variance Policy Optimization for Large Language Model   Post-Training
**Authors**: Kaichen Zhang, Yuzhong Hong, Junwei Bao, Hongfei Jiang, Yang Song, Dingqian Hong, Hui Xiong

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T10:30:01Z

**Summary**: Post-training plays a crucial role in refining and aligning large language models to meet specific tasks and human preferences. While recent advancements in post-training techniques, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), leverage increased sampling with relative reward scoring to achieve superior performance, these methods often suffer from training instability that limits their practical adoption. As a next step, we present Group Variance Policy Optimization (GVPO). GVPO incorporates the analytical solution to KL-constrained reward maximization directly into its gradient weights, ensuring alignment with the optimal policy. The method provides intuitive physical interpretations: its gradient mirrors the mean squared error between the central distance of implicit rewards and that of actual rewards. GVPO offers two key advantages: (1) it guarantees a unique optimal solution, exactly the KL-constrained reward maximization objective, (2) it supports flexible sampling distributions that avoids on-policy and importance sampling limitations. By unifying theoretical guarantees with practical adaptability, GVPO establishes a new paradigm for reliable and versatile LLM post-training.

### Evaluation of Vision-LLMs in Surveillance Video
**Authors**: Pascal Benschop, Cristian Meo, Justin Dauwels, Jelte P. Mense

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T10:27:02Z

**Summary**: The widespread use of cameras in our society has created an overwhelming amount of video data, far exceeding the capacity for human monitoring. This presents a critical challenge for public safety and security, as the timely detection of anomalous or criminal events is crucial for effective response and prevention. The ability for an embodied agent to recognize unexpected events is fundamentally tied to its capacity for spatial reasoning. This paper investigates the spatial reasoning of vision-language models (VLMs) by framing anomalous action recognition as a zero-shot, language-grounded task, addressing the embodied perception challenge of interpreting dynamic 3D scenes from sparse 2D video. Specifically, we investigate whether small, pre-trained vision--LLMs can act as spatially-grounded, zero-shot anomaly detectors by converting video into text descriptions and scoring labels via textual entailment. We evaluate four open models on UCF-Crime and RWF-2000 under prompting and privacy-preserving conditions. Few-shot exemplars can improve accuracy for some models, but may increase false positives, and privacy filters -- especially full-body GAN transforms -- introduce inconsistencies that degrade accuracy. These results chart where current vision--LLMs succeed (simple, spatially salient events) and where they falter (noisy spatial cues, identity obfuscation). Looking forward, we outline concrete paths to strengthen spatial grounding without task-specific training: structure-aware prompts, lightweight spatial memory across clips, scene-graph or 3D-pose priors during description, and privacy methods that preserve action-relevant geometry. This positions zero-shot, language-grounded pipelines as adaptable building blocks for embodied, real-world video understanding. Our implementation for evaluating VLMs is publicly available at: https://github.com/pascalbenschopTU/VLLM_AnomalyRecognition

### DREaM: Drug-Drug Relation Extraction via Transfer Learning Method
**Authors**: Ali Fata, Hossein Rahmani, Parinaz Soltanzadeh, Amirhossein Derakhshan, Behrouz Minaei Bidgoli

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T10:27:00Z

**Summary**: Relation extraction between drugs plays a crucial role in identifying drug drug interactions and predicting side effects. The advancement of machine learning methods in relation extraction, along with the development of large medical text databases, has enabled the low cost extraction of such relations compared to other approaches that typically require expert knowledge. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are limited datasets specifically designed for drug drug relation extraction currently available. Therefore, employing transfer learning becomes necessary to apply machine learning methods in this domain. In this study, we propose DREAM, a method that first employs a trained relation extraction model to discover relations between entities and then applies this model to a corpus of medical texts to construct an ontology of drug relationships. The extracted relations are subsequently validated using a large language model. Quantitative results indicate that the LLM agreed with 71 of the relations extracted from a subset of PubMed abstracts. Furthermore, our qualitative analysis indicates that this approach can uncover ambiguities in the medical domain, highlighting the challenges inherent in relation extraction in this field.

### SI-Bench: Benchmarking Social Intelligence of Large Language Models in   Human-to-Human Conversations
**Authors**: Shuai Huang, Wenxuan Zhao, Jun Gao

**Updated**: 2025-10-27T10:21:46Z

**Summary**: As large language models (LLMs) develop anthropomorphic abilities, they are increasingly being deployed as autonomous agents to interact with humans. However, evaluating their performance in realistic and complex social interactions remains a significant challenge. Most previous research built datasets through simulated agent-to-agent interactions, which fails to capture the authentic linguistic styles and relational dynamics found in real human conversations. To address this gap, we introduce SI-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate aspects of social intelligence in LLMs. Grounded in broad social science theories, SI-Bench contains 2,221 authentic multi-turn dialogues collected from a social networking application. We further selected a subset of 312 dialogues for manual annotation across 8 major models. The experiments show that SOTA models have surpassed the human expert in process reasoning under complex social situations, yet they still fall behind humans in reply quality. Moreover, introducing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning may degrade the performance of LLMs in social dialogue tasks. All datasets are openly available at https://github.com/SI-Bench/SI-Bench.git.
