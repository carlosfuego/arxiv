**Authors**: Kun Ding, Qiang Yu, Haojian Zhang, Gaofeng Meng, Shiming Xiang

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T15:12:30Z

**Summary**: Cache-based approaches stand out as both effective and efficient for adapting vision-language models (VLMs). Nonetheless, the existing cache model overlooks three crucial aspects. 1) Pre-trained VLMs are mainly optimized for image-text similarity, neglecting the importance of image-image similarity, leading to a gap between pre-training and adaptation. 2) The current cache model is based on the Nadaraya-Watson (N-W) estimator, which disregards the intricate relationships among training samples while constructing weight function. 3) Under the condition of limited samples, the logits generated by cache model are of high uncertainty, directly using these logits without accounting for the confidence could be problematic. This work presents three calibration modules aimed at addressing the above challenges. Similarity Calibration refines the image-image similarity by using unlabeled images. We add a learnable projection layer with residual connection on top of the pre-trained image encoder of CLIP and optimize the parameters by minimizing self-supervised contrastive loss. Weight Calibration introduces a precision matrix into the weight function to adequately model the relation between training samples, transforming the existing cache model to a Gaussian Process (GP) regressor, which could be more accurate than N-W estimator. Confidence Calibration leverages the predictive variances computed by GP Regression to dynamically re-scale the logits of cache model, ensuring that the cache model's outputs are appropriately adjusted based on their confidence levels. Besides, to reduce the high complexity of GPs, we further propose a group-based learning strategy. Integrating the above designs, we propose both training-free and training-required variants. Extensive experiments on 11 few-shot classification datasets validate that the proposed methods can achieve state-of-the-art performance.

### Unlocking FedNL: Self-Contained Compute-Optimized Implementation
**Authors**: Konstantin Burlachenko, Peter Richt√°rik

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T12:19:18Z

**Summary**: Federated Learning (FL) is an emerging paradigm that enables intelligent agents to collaboratively train Machine Learning (ML) models in a distributed manner, eliminating the need for sharing their local data. The recent work (arXiv:2106.02969) introduces a family of Federated Newton Learn (FedNL) algorithms, marking a significant step towards applying second-order methods to FL and large-scale optimization. However, the reference FedNL prototype exhibits three serious practical drawbacks: (i) It requires 4.8 hours to launch a single experiment in a sever-grade workstation; (ii) The prototype only simulates multi-node setting; (iii) Prototype integration into resource-constrained applications is challenging. To bridge the gap between theory and practice, we present a self-contained implementation of FedNL, FedNL-LS, FedNL-PP for single-node and multi-node settings. Our work resolves the aforementioned issues and reduces the wall clock time by x1000. With this FedNL outperforms alternatives for training logistic regression in a single-node -- CVXPY (arXiv:1603.00943), and in a multi-node -- Apache Spark (arXiv:1505.06807), Ray/Scikit-Learn (arXiv:1712.05889). Finally, we propose two practical-orientated compressors for FedNL - adaptive TopLEK and cache-aware RandSeqK, which fulfill the theory of FedNL.

### AsyncFS: Metadata Updates Made Asynchronous for Distributed Filesystems   with In-Network Coordination
**Authors**: Jingwei Xu, Mingkai Dong, Qiulin Tian, Ziyi Tian, Tong Xin, Haibo Chen

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T08:33:58Z

**Summary**: Distributed filesystems typically employ synchronous metadata updates, facing inherent challenges for access efficiency, load balancing, and directory contention, especially under dynamic and skewed workloads. This paper argues that synchronous updates are overly conservative for distributed filesystems. We propose AsyncFS with asynchronous metadata updates, allowing operations to return early and defer directory updates until respective read to enable latency hiding and conflict resolution. The key challenge is efficiently maintaining the synchronous semantics of metadata updates. To address this, AsyncFS is co-designed with a programmable switch, leveraging the constrained on-switch resources to holistically track directory states in the network with negligible cost. This allows AsyncFS to timely aggregate and efficiently apply delayed updates using batching and consolidation before directory reads. Evaluation shows that AsyncFS achieves up to 13.34$\times$ and 3.85$\times$ higher throughput, and 61.6% and 57.3% lower latency than two state-of-the-art distributed filesystems, InfiniFS and CFS-KV, respectively, on skewed workloads. For real-world workloads, AsyncFS improves end-to-end throughput by 21.1$\times$, 1.1$\times$ and 30.1% over Ceph, IndexFS and CFS-KV, respectively.

### ZipVL: Efficient Large Vision-Language Models with Dynamic Token   Sparsification and KV Cache Compression
**Authors**: Yefei He, Feng Chen, Jing Liu, Wenqi Shao, Hong Zhou, Kaipeng Zhang, Bohan Zhuang

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T07:24:21Z

**Summary**: The efficiency of large vision-language models (LVLMs) is constrained by the computational bottleneck of the attention mechanism during the prefill phase and the memory bottleneck of fetching the key-value (KV) cache in the decoding phase, particularly in scenarios involving high-resolution images or videos. Visual content often exhibits substantial redundancy, resulting in highly sparse attention maps within LVLMs. This sparsity can be leveraged to accelerate attention computation or compress the KV cache through various approaches. However, most studies focus on addressing only one of these bottlenecks and do not adequately support dynamic adjustment of sparsity concerning distinct layers or tasks. In this paper, we present ZipVL, an efficient inference framework designed for LVLMs that resolves both computation and memory bottlenecks through a dynamic ratio allocation strategy of important tokens. This ratio is adaptively determined based on the layer-specific distribution of attention scores, rather than fixed hyper-parameters, thereby improving efficiency for less complex tasks while maintaining high performance for more challenging ones. Then we select important tokens based on their normalized attention scores and perform attention mechanism solely on those important tokens to accelerate the prefill phase. To mitigate the memory bottleneck in the decoding phase, we employ mixed-precision quantization to the KV cache, where high-bit quantization is used for caches of important tokens, while low-bit quantization is applied to those of less importance. Our experiments demonstrate that ZipVL can accelerate the prefill phase by 2.6$\times$ and reduce GPU memory usage by 50.0%, with a minimal accuracy reduction of only 0.2% on Video-MME benchmark over LongVA-7B model, effectively enhancing the generation efficiency of LVLMs.

### Long Context Compression with Activation Beacon
**Authors**: Peitian Zhang, Zheng Liu, Shitao Xiao, Ninglu Shao, Qiwei Ye, Zhicheng Dou

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T02:18:24Z

**Summary**: Long context compression is a critical research problem due to its significance in reducing the high computational and memory costs associated with LLMs. In this paper, we propose Activation Beacon, a plug-in module for transformer-based LLMs that targets effective, efficient, and flexible compression of long contexts. To achieve this, our method introduces the following technical designs. 1) We directly compress the activations (i.e. keys and values at every layer), rather than leveraging soft prompts to relay information (which constitute a major bottleneck to encapsulate the complex information within long contexts). 2) We tailor the compression workflow, where each fine-grained input unit is progressively compressed, enabling high-quality compression and efficient computation during both training and inference. 3) We train the model through compression-based auto-regression, making full use of plain texts and instructional data to optimize the model's compression performance. 4) During training, we randomly sample a compression ratio at each step, teaching the model to support a wide range of compression configurations. Extensive evaluations are conducted on various long-context tasks whose lengths (e.g., 128K) may far exceed the maximum training length (20K), such as document understanding, few-shot learning, and Needle-in-a-Haystack. Whilst existing methods struggle to handle these challenging tasks, Activation Beacon maintains a comparable performance to the uncompressed baseline across various scenarios, achieving a 2x acceleration in inference time and an 8x reduction of memory costs for KV cache. Our data, model, and code have been released at \url{https://github.com/FlagOpen/FlagEmbedding/}.

### KV Prediction for Improved Time to First Token
**Authors**: Maxwell Horton, Qingqing Cao, Chenfan Sun, Yanzi Jin, Sachin Mehta, Mohammad Rastegari, Moin Nabi

**Updated**: 2024-10-10T21:55:11Z

**Summary**: Inference with transformer-based language models begins with a prompt processing step. In this step, the model generates the first output token and stores the KV cache needed for future generation steps. This prompt processing step can be computationally expensive, taking 10s of seconds or more for billion-parameter models on edge devices when prompt lengths or batch sizes rise. This degrades user experience by introducing significant latency into the model's outputs. To reduce the time spent producing the first output (known as the ``time to first token'', or TTFT) of a pretrained model, we introduce a novel method called KV Prediction. In our method, a small auxiliary model is used to process the prompt and produce an approximation of the KV cache used by a base model. This approximated KV cache is then used with the base model for autoregressive generation without the need to query the auxiliary model again. We demonstrate that our method produces a pareto-optimal efficiency-accuracy trade-off when compared to baselines. On TriviaQA, we demonstrate relative accuracy improvements in the range of $15\%-50\%$ across a range of TTFT FLOPs budgets. We also demonstrate accuracy improvements of up to $30\%$ on HumanEval python code completion at fixed TTFT FLOPs budgets. Additionally, we benchmark models on an Apple M2 Pro CPU and demonstrate that our improvement in FLOPs translates to a TTFT speedup on hardware. We release our code at https://github.com/apple/corenet/tree/main/projects/kv-prediction .

### Amplifying Main Memory-Based Timing Covert and Side Channels using   Processing-in-Memory Operations
**Authors**: Konstantinos Kanellopoulos, F. Nisa Bostanci, Ataberk Olgun, A. Giray Yaglikci, Ismail Emir Yuksel, Nika Mansouri Ghiasi, Zulal Bingol, Mohammad Sadrosadati, Onur Mutlu

**Updated**: 2024-10-10T16:57:34Z

**Summary**: The adoption of processing-in-memory (PiM) architectures has been gaining momentum because they provide high performance and low energy consumption by alleviating the data movement bottleneck. Yet, the security of such architectures has not been thoroughly explored. The adoption of PiM solutions provides a new way to directly access main memory, which malicious user applications can exploit. We show that this new way to access main memory opens opportunities for high-throughput timing attacks that are hard-to-mitigate without significant performance overhead.   We introduce IMPACT, a set of high-throughput main memory-based timing attacks that leverage characteristics of PiM architectures to establish covert and side channels. IMPACT enables high-throughput communication and private information leakage by exploiting the shared DRAM row buffer. To achieve high throughput, IMPACT (i) eliminates cache bypassing steps required by processor-centric main memory and cache-based timing attacks and (ii) leverages the intrinsic parallelism of PiM operations. We showcase two applications of IMPACT. First, we build two covert-channel attacks that run on the host CPU and leverage different PiM approaches to gain direct and fast access to main memory and establish high-throughput communication covert channels. Second, we showcase a side-channel attack that leaks private information of concurrently running victim applications that are accelerated with PiM. Our results demonstrate that (i) our covert channels achieve 12.87 Mb/s and 14.16 Mb/s communication throughput, respectively, which is up to 4.91x and 5.41x faster than the state-of-the-art main memory-based covert channels, and (ii) our side-channel attack allows the attacker to leak secrets with a low error rate. To avoid such covert and side channels in emerging PiM systems, we propose and evaluate three defenses.

### C$^3$P-VoxelMap: Compact, Cumulative and Coalescible Probabilistic Voxel   Mapping
**Authors**: Xu Yang, Wenhao Li, Qijie Ge, Lulu Suo, Weijie Tang, Zhengyu Wei, Longxiang Huang, Bo Wang

**Updated**: 2024-10-10T11:01:44Z

**Summary**: This work presents a compact, cumulative and coalescible probabilistic voxel mapping method to enhance performance, accuracy and memory efficiency in LiDAR odometry. Probabilistic voxel mapping requires storing past point clouds and re-iterating on them to update the uncertainty every iteration, which consumes large memory space and CPU cycles. To solve this problem, we propose a two-folded strategy. First, we introduce a compact point-free representation for probabilistic voxels and derive a cumulative update of the planar uncertainty without caching original point clouds. Our voxel structure only keeps track of a predetermined set of statistics for points that lie inside it. This method reduces the runtime complexity from $O(MN)$ to $O(N)$ and the space complexity from $O(N)$ to $O(1)$ where $M$ is the number of iterations and $N$ is the number of points. Second, to further minimize memory usage and enhance mapping accuracy, we provide a strategy to dynamically merge voxels associated with the same physical planes by taking advantage of the geometric features in the real world. Rather than scanning for these coalescible voxels constantly at every iteration, our merging strategy accumulates voxels in a locality-sensitive hash and triggers merging lazily. On-demand merging not only reduces memory footprint with minimal computational overhead but also improves localization accuracy thanks to cross-voxel denoising. Experiments exhibit 20% higher accuracy, 20% faster performance and 70% lower memory consumption than the state-of-the-art.

### SqueezeAttention: 2D Management of KV-Cache in LLM Inference via   Layer-wise Optimal Budget
**Authors**: Zihao Wang, Bin Cui, Shaoduo Gan

**Updated**: 2024-10-10T05:11:52Z

**Summary**: Optimizing the Key-Value (KV) cache of the Large Language Model (LLM) has been considered critical to saving the cost of inference. Most of the existing KV-cache compression algorithms attempted to sparsify the sequence of tokens by taking advantage of the different importance of tokens. However, most of these methods treat all layers equally, allocating the same KV budget to each layer. This approach is suboptimal, as some layers may be less sensitive to input tokens yet still receive the same budget as others. In this work, we found that by identifying the importance of attention layers, we could optimize the KV-cache jointly from two dimensions, i.e., sequence-wise and layer-wise. Based on our observations regarding layer-wise importance in inference, we propose SqueezeAttention to precisely optimize the allocation of KV-cache budget among layers on-the-fly and then incorporate three representative sequence-wise algorithms to compress the KV-cache for each layer with its very own budget. Specifically, we first measure each layer's importance by calculating the cosine similarity of the input prompt differences before and after the self-attention layers. Based on this similarity, we then categorize the layers into two groups and adjust their KV budgets accordingly. By optimizing the KV-cache from both sequence's and layer's dimensions, SqueezeAttention achieves around 30% to 70% of the memory reductions and up to 2.2 times of throughput improvements in a wide range of LLMs and benchmarks. The code is available at https://github.com/hetailang/SqueezeAttention.

### TurboRAG: Accelerating Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Precomputed   KV Caches for Chunked Text
**Authors**: Songshuo Lu, Hua Wang, Yutian Rong, Zhi Chen, Yaohua Tang

**Updated**: 2024-10-10T03:52:54Z

**Summary**: Current Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems concatenate and process numerous retrieved document chunks for prefill which requires a large volume of computation, therefore leading to significant latency in time-to-first-token (TTFT). To reduce the computation overhead as well as TTFT, we introduce TurboRAG, a novel RAG system that redesigns the inference paradigm of the current RAG system by first pre-computing and storing the key-value (KV) caches of documents offline, and then directly retrieving the saved KV cache for prefill. Hence, online computation of KV caches is eliminated during inference. In addition, we provide a number of insights into the mask matrix and positional embedding mechanisms, plus fine-tune a pretrained language model to maintain model accuracy of TurboRAG. Our approach is applicable to most existing large language models and their applications without any requirement in modification of models and inference systems. Experimental results across a suite of RAG benchmarks demonstrate that TurboRAG reduces TTFT by up to 9.4x compared to the conventional RAG systems (on an average of 8.6x), but reserving comparable performance to the standard RAG systems.

### Teddy: Efficient Large-Scale Dataset Distillation via   Taylor-Approximated Matching
**Authors**: Ruonan Yu, Songhua Liu, Jingwen Ye, Xinchao Wang

**Updated**: 2024-10-10T03:28:46Z

**Summary**: Dataset distillation or condensation refers to compressing a large-scale dataset into a much smaller one, enabling models trained on this synthetic dataset to generalize effectively on real data. Tackling this challenge, as defined, relies on a bi-level optimization algorithm: a novel model is trained in each iteration within a nested loop, with gradients propagated through an unrolled computation graph. However, this approach incurs high memory and time complexity, posing difficulties in scaling up to large datasets such as ImageNet. Addressing these concerns, this paper introduces Teddy, a Taylor-approximated dataset distillation framework designed to handle large-scale dataset and enhance efficiency. On the one hand, backed up by theoretical analysis, we propose a memory-efficient approximation derived from Taylor expansion, which transforms the original form dependent on multi-step gradients to a first-order one. On the other hand, rather than repeatedly training a novel model in each iteration, we unveil that employing a pre-cached pool of weak models, which can be generated from a single base model, enhances both time efficiency and performance concurrently, particularly when dealing with large-scale datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed Teddy attains state-of-the-art efficiency and performance on the Tiny-ImageNet and original-sized ImageNet-1K dataset, notably surpassing prior methods by up to 12.8%, while reducing 46.6% runtime. Our code will be available at https://github.com/Lexie-YU/Teddy.

**Updated**: 2024-10-09T15:57:03Z

**Summary**: Understanding the physics of electromagnetic pulse emission and nozzle damage is critical for the long-term operation of laser experiments with gas targets, particularly at facilities looking to produce stable sources of radiation at high repetition rate. We present a theoretical model of plasma formation and electrostatic charging when high-power lasers are focused inside gases. The model can be used to estimate the amplitude of gigahertz electromagnetic pulses (EMPs) produced by the laser and the extent of damage to the gas jet nozzle. Looking at a range of laser and target properties relevant to existing high-power laser systems, we find that EMP fields of tens to hundreds of kV/m can be generated several metres from the gas jet. Model predictions are compared with measurements of EMP, plasma formation and nozzle damage from two experiments on the VEGA-3 laser and one experiment on the Vulcan Petawatt laser.

### VEC-Sim: A Simulation Platform for Evaluating Service Caching and   Computation Offloading Policies in Vehicular Edge Networks
**Authors**: Fan Wu, Xiaolong Xu, Muhammad Bilal, Xiangwei Wang, Hao Cheng, Siyu Wu

**Updated**: 2024-10-09T14:28:59Z

**Summary**: Computer simulation platforms offer an alternative solution by emulating complex systems in a controlled manner. However, existing Edge Computing (EC) simulators, as well as general-purpose vehicular network simulators, are not tailored for VEC and lack dedicated support for modeling the distinct access pattern, entity mobility trajectory and other unique characteristics of VEC networks. To fill this gap, this paper proposes VEC-Sim, a versatile simulation platform for in-depth evaluation and analysis of various service caching and computation offloading policies in VEC networks. VEC-Sim incorporates realistic mechanisms to replicate real-world access patterns, including service feature vector, vehicle mobility modeling, evolving service popularity, new service upload and user preference shifts, etc. Moreover, its modular architecture and extensive Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) allow seamless integration of customized scheduling policies and user-defined metrics. A comprehensive evaluation of VEC-Sim's capabilities is undertaken in comparison to real-world ground truths. Results prove it to be accurate in reproducing classical scheduling algorithms and extremely effective in conducting case studies.

### LayerKV: Optimizing Large Language Model Serving with Layer-wise KV   Cache Management
**Authors**: Yi Xiong, Hao Wu, Changxu Shao, Ziqing Wang, Rui Zhang, Yuhong Guo, Junping Zhao, Ke Zhang, Zhenxuan Pan

**Updated**: 2024-10-09T11:40:31Z

**Summary**: The expanding context windows in large language models (LLMs) have greatly enhanced their capabilities in various applications, but they also introduce significant challenges in maintaining low latency, particularly in Time to First Token (TTFT). This paper identifies that the sharp rise in TTFT as context length increases is predominantly driven by queuing delays, which are caused by the growing demands for GPU Key-Value (KV) cache allocation clashing with the limited availability of KV cache blocks. To address this issue, we propose LayerKV, a simple yet effective plug-in method that effectively reduces TTFT without requiring additional hardware or compromising output performance, while seamlessly integrating with existing parallelism strategies and scheduling techniques. Specifically, LayerKV introduces layer-wise KV block allocation, management, and offloading for fine-grained control over system memory, coupled with an SLO-aware scheduler to optimize overall Service Level Objectives (SLOs). Comprehensive evaluations on representative models, ranging from 7B to 70B parameters, across various GPU configurations, demonstrate that LayerKV improves TTFT latency up to 69x and reduces SLO violation rates by 28.7%, significantly enhancing the user experience.

### Variations in Multi-Agent Actor-Critic Frameworks for Joint   Optimizations in UAV Swarm Networks: Recent Evolution, Challenges, and   Directions
**Authors**: Muhammad Morshed Alam, Muhammad Yeasir Aarafat, Tamim Hossain

**Updated**: 2024-10-09T07:22:40Z

**Summary**: Autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm networks (UAVSNs) can effectively execute surveillance, connectivity, and computing services to ground users (GUs). These missions require trajectory planning, UAV-GUs association, task offloading, next-hop selection, and resources such as transmit power, bandwidth, caching, and computing allocation to improve network performances. Owing to the highly dynamic topology, limited resources, and non-availability of global knowledge, optimizing network performance in UAVSNs is very intricate. Hence, it requires an adaptive joint optimization framework that can tackle both discrete and continuous decision variables to ensure optimal network performance under dynamic constraints. Multi-agent deep reinforcement learning-based adaptive actor-critic framework can efficiently address these problems. This paper investigates the recent evolutions of actor-critic frameworks to deal with joint optimization problems in UAVSNs. In addition, challenges and potential solutions are addressed as research directions.

### UpDLRM: Accelerating Personalized Recommendation using Real-World PIM   Architecture
**Authors**: Sitian Chen, Haobin Tan, Amelie Chi Zhou, Yusen Li, Pavan Balaji

**Updated**: 2024-10-09T04:11:28Z

**Summary**: Deep Learning Recommendation Models (DLRMs) have gained popularity in recommendation systems due to their effectiveness in handling large-scale recommendation tasks. The embedding layers of DLRMs have become the performance bottleneck due to their intensive needs on memory capacity and memory bandwidth. In this paper, we propose UpDLRM, which utilizes real-world processingin-memory (PIM) hardware, UPMEM DPU, to boost the memory bandwidth and reduce recommendation latency. The parallel nature of the DPU memory can provide high aggregated bandwidth for the large number of irregular memory accesses in embedding lookups, thus offering great potential to reduce the inference latency. To fully utilize the DPU memory bandwidth, we further studied the embedding table partitioning problem to achieve good workload-balance and efficient data caching. Evaluations using real-world datasets show that, UpDLRM achieves much lower inference time for DLRM compared to both CPU-only and CPU-GPU hybrid counterparts.

**Updated**: 2024-10-09T02:51:27Z

**Summary**: The increasing complexity of deep learning models used for calculating user representations presents significant challenges, particularly with limited computational resources and strict service-level agreements (SLAs). Previous research efforts have focused on optimizing model inference but have overlooked a critical question: is it necessary to perform user model inference for every ad request in large-scale social networks? To address this question and these challenges, we first analyze user access patterns at Meta and find that most user model inferences occur within a short timeframe. T his observation reveals a triangular relationship among model complexity, embedding freshness, and service SLAs. Building on this insight, we designed, implemented, and evaluated ERCache, an efficient and robust caching framework for large-scale user representations in ads recommendation systems on social networks. ERCache categorizes cache into direct and failover types and applies customized settings and eviction policies for each model, effectively balancing model complexity, embedding freshness, and service SLAs, even considering the staleness introduced by caching. ERCache has been deployed at Meta for over six months, supporting more than 30 ranking models while efficiently conserving computational resources and complying with service SLA requirements.

### Simultaneous Masking, Not Prompting Optimization: A Paradigm Shift in   Fine-tuning LLMs for Simultaneous Translation
**Authors**: Matthew Raffel, Victor Agostinelli, Lizhong Chen

**Updated**: 2024-10-09T01:12:19Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various language processing tasks, motivating their adoption in simultaneous translation. Current fine-tuning methods to adapt LLMs for simultaneous translation focus on prompting optimization strategies using either data augmentation or prompt structure modifications. However, these methods suffer from several issues, such as unnecessarily expanded training sets, computational inefficiency from dumping the key and value cache, increased prompt sizes, or restriction to a single decision policy. To eliminate these issues, in this work, we propose SimulMask, a new paradigm for fine-tuning LLMs for simultaneous translation. It utilizes a novel attention mask approach that models simultaneous translation during fine-tuning by masking attention for a desired decision policy. Applying the proposed SimulMask on a Falcon LLM for the IWSLT 2017 dataset, we have observed a significant translation quality improvement compared to state-of-the-art prompting optimization strategies on five language pairs while reducing the computational cost.

### KV Cache Compression, But What Must We Give in Return? A Comprehensive   Benchmark of Long Context Capable Approaches
**Authors**: Jiayi Yuan, Hongyi Liu, Shaochen Zhong, Yu-Neng Chuang, Songchen Li, Guanchu Wang, Duy Le, Hongye Jin, Vipin Chaudhary, Zhaozhuo Xu, Zirui Liu, Xia Hu

**Updated**: 2024-10-08T19:34:03Z

**Summary**: Long context capability is a crucial competency for large language models (LLMs) as it mitigates the human struggle to digest long-form texts. This capability enables complex task-solving scenarios such as book summarization, code assistance, and many more tasks that are traditionally manpower-intensive. However, transformer-based LLMs face significant challenges with long context input due to the growing size of the KV cache and the intrinsic complexity of attending to extended inputs; where multiple schools of efficiency-driven approaches - such as KV cache quantization, token dropping, prompt compression, linear-time sequence models, and hybrid architectures - have been proposed to produce efficient yet long context-capable models. Despite these advancements, no existing work has comprehensively benchmarked these methods in a reasonably aligned environment. In this work, we fill this gap by providing a taxonomy of current methods and evaluating 10+ state-of-the-art approaches across seven categories of long context tasks. Our work reveals numerous previously unknown phenomena and offers insights - as well as a friendly workbench - for the future development of long context-capable LLMs. The source code is available at https://github.com/henryzhongsc/longctx_bench.

### Numerical analysis of partial discharge ignition in H2 bubbles floating   in dielectric oils, for High-Voltage Solid State Transformer applications
**Authors**: Konstantinos Kourtzanidis, Panagiotis Dimitrakellis, Dimitrios Rakopoulos

**Updated**: 2024-10-08T11:28:30Z

**Summary**: We report on a self-consistent numerical analysis campaign of partial discharge (PD) ignition in H2 bubbles floating in biobased dielectric oils. We investigate various configurations (bubble sizes, bubble position, existence of protrusion) on a cylinder-to-cylinder setup that emulates a specific SST module (from SSTAR Horizon Europe project) under transient overvoltage as well as in its design operational conditions (VRMS = 66 kV, AC excitation of 50 Hz). Our results on electrical characteristics and plasma dynamics leading to the PD ignition, indicate that under transient overvoltage and for mm size bubbles (diameter 1 -4.5 mm), the smaller the bubble the less the inception voltage, while the peak inception voltage is higher than 70 kV. The existence of metallic protrusion can affect the inception voltage of a remote floating bubble only slightly and when this is close to the sharp tip. The extreme scenario of a protrusion in contact (inside) a gas bubble severely affects the insulation properties and drops the PD inception voltage remarkably. The larger the bubble and the sharper the tip of the protrusion the lower the inception peak voltage, that can reach values well below 40 kV. On the contrary and under design operation, larger bubbles increase the severity and probability of PD events, leading to lower instantaneous inception voltages. Current pulses produced in bubbles can quickly transit to intense streamer discharges (which can also transit to catastrophic arcing) if the operational frequency is reduced and/or under transient, HF overvoltage.

### Enhancing Playback Performance in Video Recommender Systems with an   On-Device Gating and Ranking Framework
**Authors**: Yunfei Yang, Zhenghao Qi, Honghuan Wu, Qi Song, Tieyao Zhang, Hao Li, Yimin Tu, Kaiqiao Zhan, Ben Wang

**Updated**: 2024-10-08T09:53:10Z

**Summary**: Video recommender systems (RSs) have gained increasing attention in recent years. Existing mainstream RSs focus on optimizing the matching function between users and items. However, we noticed that users frequently encounter playback issues such as slow loading or stuttering while browsing the videos, especially in weak network conditions, which will lead to a subpar browsing experience, and may cause users to leave, even when the video content and recommendations are superior. It is quite a serious issue, yet easily overlooked. To tackle this issue, we propose an on-device Gating and Ranking Framework (GRF) that cooperates with server-side RS. Specifically, we utilize a gate model to identify videos that may have playback issues in real-time, and then we employ a ranking model to select the optimal result from a locally-cached pool to replace the stuttering videos. Our solution has been fully deployed on Kwai, a large-scale short video platform with hundreds of millions of users globally. Moreover, it significantly enhances video playback performance and improves overall user experience and retention rates.

### A Scalable State Sharing Protocol for Low-Resource Validator Nodes in   Blockchain Networks
**Authors**: Ruben Hias, Weihong Wang, Jan Vanhoof, Tom Van Cutsem

**Updated**: 2024-10-08T09:46:38Z

**Summary**: The perpetual growth of data stored on popular blockchains such as Ethereum leads to significant scalability challenges and substantial storage costs for operators of full nodes. Increasing costs may lead to fewer independently operated nodes in the network, which poses risks to decentralization (and hence network security), but also pushes decentralized app developers towards centrally hosted API services.   This paper introduces a new protocol that allows validator nodes to participate in a blockchain network without the need to store the full state of the network on each node. The key idea is to use the blockchain network as both a replicated state machine and as a distributed storage system. By distributing states across nodes and enabling efficient data retrieval through a Kademlia-inspired routing protocol, we reduce storage costs for validators. Cryptographic proofs (such as Merkle proofs) are used to allow nodes to verify data stored by other nodes without having to trust those nodes directly. While the protocol trades off data storage for increased network bandwidth, we show how gossiping and caching can minimize the increased bandwidth needs.   To validate our state sharing protocol, we conduct an extensive quantitative analysis of Ethereum's data storage and data access patterns. Our findings indicate that while our protocol significantly lowers storage needs, it comes with an increased bandwidth usage ranging from 1.5 MB to 5 MB per block, translating to an additional monthly bandwidth of 319 GB to 1,065 GB. Despite this, the size remains small enough such that it can be passed to all nodes and validated within Ethereum's 12-second block validation window. Further analysis shows that Merkle proofs are the most significant contributor to the additional bandwidth. To address this concern, we also analyze the impact of switching to the more space-efficient Verkle Proofs.

### CItruS: Chunked Instruction-aware State Eviction for Long Sequence   Modeling
**Authors**: Yu Bai, Xiyuan Zou, Heyan Huang, Sanxing Chen, Marc-Antoine Rondeau, Yang Gao, Jackie Chi Kit Cheung

**Updated**: 2024-10-08T04:25:41Z

**Summary**: Long sequence modeling has gained broad interest as large language models (LLMs) continue to advance. Recent research has identified that a large portion of hidden states within the key-value caches of Transformer models can be discarded (also termed evicted) without affecting the perplexity performance in generating long sequences. However, we show that these methods, despite preserving perplexity performance, often drop information that is important for solving downstream tasks, a problem which we call information neglect. To address this issue, we introduce Chunked Instruction-aware State Eviction (CItruS), a novel modeling technique that integrates the attention preferences useful for a downstream task into the eviction process of hidden states. In addition, we design a method for chunked sequence processing to further improve efficiency. Our training-free method exhibits superior performance on long sequence comprehension and retrieval tasks over several strong baselines under the same memory budget, while preserving language modeling perplexity. The code and data have been released at https://github.com/ybai-nlp/CItruS.

### PrefixQuant: Static Quantization Beats Dynamic through Prefixed Outliers   in LLMs
**Authors**: Mengzhao Chen, Yi Liu, Jiahao Wang, Yi Bin, Wenqi Shao, Ping Luo

**Updated**: 2024-10-07T17:59:35Z

**Summary**: Quantization is essential for deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) by enhancing memory efficiency and inference speed. Existing methods for activation quantization mainly address channel-wise outliers, often neglecting token-wise outliers, leading to reliance on costly per-token dynamic quantization. To address this, we introduce PrefixQuant, a novel technique that isolates outlier tokens offline without re-training. Specifically, PrefixQuant identifies high-frequency outlier tokens and prefixes them in the KV cache, preventing the generation of outlier tokens during inference and simplifying quantization. To our knowledge, PrefixQuant is the first to enable efficient per-tensor static quantization to outperform expensive per-token dynamic quantization. For instance, in W4A4KV4 (4- bit weight, 4-bit activation, and 4-bit KV cache) Llama-3-8B, PrefixQuant with per-tensor static quantization achieves a 7.43 WikiText2 perplexity and 71.08% average accuracy on 5 common-sense reasoning tasks, outperforming previous per-token dynamic quantization methods like QuaRot with 0.98 perplexity improvement and +5.98 points accuracy. Additionally, the inference speed of W4A4 quantized models using PrefixQuant is 1.60x to 2.81x faster than FP16 models and exceeds QuaRot models by 1.2x to 1.3x. Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/ChenMnZ/PrefixQuant}.

### Stateful Large Language Model Serving with Pensieve
**Authors**: Lingfan Yu, Jinkun Lin, Jinyang Li

**Updated**: 2024-10-07T17:21:57Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are wildly popular today and it is important to serve them efficiently. Existing LLM serving systems are stateless across requests. Consequently, when LLMs are used in the common setting of multi-turn conversations, a growing log of the conversation history must be processed alongside any request by the serving system at each turn, resulting in repeated processing.   In this paper, we design $Pensieve$, a system optimized for multi-turn conversation LLM serving. $Pensieve$ maintains the conversation state across requests by caching previously processed history to avoid duplicate processing. $Pensieve$'s multi-tier caching strategy can utilize both GPU and CPU memory to efficiently store and retrieve cached data. $Pensieve$ also generalizes the recent PagedAttention kernel to support attention between multiple input tokens with a GPU cache spread over non-contiguous memory. Our evaluation shows that $Pensieve$ can achieve $1.14$-$3.0\times$ the throughput of vLLM and TensorRT-LLM and significantly reduce latency.

### KV-Compress: Paged KV-Cache Compression with Variable Compression Rates   per Attention Head
**Authors**: Isaac Rehg

**Updated**: 2024-10-07T15:07:09Z

**Summary**: Context lengths of Large Language Models (LLMs) have exploded in recent years, with 128k-token context becoming a standard and million-token context becoming a reality. Efficiently supporting long-context inference remains challenging as the memory that must be allocated in key-value (KV) cache for a generation scales with its context length, limiting the number of long-context requests that can be served concurrently under a given memory budget. KV cache compression can mitigate this issue by removing under-utilized KVs from each attention head's cache and reducing its memory footprint. Higher theoretical compression rates can be achieved when the number of removed KVs varies across attention heads, but application of such a strategy within existing inference frameworks adds fragmentation and cannot realize the theoretical compression rates in physical memory. We introduce KV-Compress, a novel compression method that evicts contiguous KV blocks within a PagedAttention framework, reducing the memory footprint of the KV cache proportionally to this theoretical compression rate. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on LongBench for both Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct while lowering the total number of compressed KVs by 4x compared with prior methods. Evaluations on Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-FP8 achieve compression rates up to 8x with negligible impact on performance, and up to 64x while retaining over 90% of full-cache performance for all but three of the suite's subsets. We benchmark an integration of our method with vLLM that increases total throughput by up to 5.18x by enabling larger decoding batches.

### TidalDecode: Fast and Accurate LLM Decoding with Position Persistent   Sparse Attention
**Authors**: Lijie Yang, Zhihao Zhang, Zhuofu Chen, Zikun Li, Zhihao Jia

**Updated**: 2024-10-07T14:30:27Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have driven significant advancements across diverse NLP tasks, with long-context models gaining prominence for handling extended inputs. However, the expanding key-value (KV) cache size required by Transformer architectures intensifies the memory constraints, particularly during the decoding phase, creating a significant bottleneck. Existing sparse attention mechanisms designed to address this bottleneck have two limitations: (1) they often fail to reliably identify the most relevant tokens for attention, and (2) they overlook the spatial coherence of token selection across consecutive Transformer layers, which can lead to performance degradation and substantial overhead in token selection. This paper introduces TidalDecode, a simple yet effective algorithm and system for fast and accurate LLM decoding through position persistent sparse attention. TidalDecode leverages the spatial coherence of tokens selected by existing sparse attention methods and introduces a few token selection layers that perform full attention to identify the tokens with the highest attention scores, while all other layers perform sparse attention with the pre-selected tokens. This design enables TidalDecode to substantially reduce the overhead of token selection for sparse attention without sacrificing the quality of the generated results. Evaluation on a diverse set of LLMs and tasks shows that TidalDecode closely matches the generative performance of full attention methods while reducing the LLM decoding latency by up to 2.1x.

### Extended Functional Representation Lemma: A Tool For Privacy, Semantic   Representation, Caching, and Compression Design
**Authors**: Amirreza Zamani, Mikael Skoglund

**Updated**: 2024-10-07T13:33:23Z

**Summary**: This paper provides an overview of a problem in information-theoretic privacy mechanism design, addressing two scenarios in which private data is either observable or hidden. In each scenario, different privacy measures are used, including bounded mutual information and two types of per-letter privacy constraints. Considering the first scenario, an agent observes useful data that is correlated with private data, and wants to disclose the useful information to a user. Due to the privacy concerns, direct disclosure is prohibited. Hence, a privacy mechanism is designed to generate disclosed data which maximizes the revealed information about the useful data while satisfying a privacy constraint. In the second scenario, the agent has additionally access to the private data. We discuss how the Functional Representation Lemma, the Strong Functional Representation Lemma, and their extended versions are useful for designing low-complexity privacy mechanisms that achieve optimal privacy-utility trade-offs under certain constraints. Furthermore, another privacy design problem is presented where part of the private attribute is more private than the remaining part. Finally, we provide applications including semantic communications, caching and delivery, and compression designs, where the approach can be applied.

### Fast State Restoration in LLM Serving with HCache
**Authors**: Shiwei Gao, Youmin Chen, Jiwu Shu

**Updated**: 2024-10-07T13:03:45Z

**Summary**: The growing complexity of LLM usage today, e.g., multi-round conversation and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), makes contextual states (i.e., KV cache) reusable across user requests. Given the capacity constraints of GPU memory, only a limited number of contexts can be cached on GPU for reusing. Existing inference systems typically evict part of the KV cache and restore it by recomputing it from the original tokens or offloading it to host storage for later retrieval, both of which introduce substantial computational or I/O overheads. We propose HCache, a novel LLM state restoration method. Its key idea is to restore LLM states from intermediate activations and thus utilize computational and I/O resources with low overhead. We enhance HCache with two techniques, including i) a bubble-free restoration scheduler that integrates resource-complementary methods to optimize the balance between computation and IO tasks; and ii) a chunk-based storage manager to address the layout mismatch issue (i.e., layer-before-token saving versus token-before-layer restoration). Our evaluations, conducted using real-world tasks, show that HCache reduces the TTFT by up to 1.93X compared to KV offload while consuming 1.92-2.40X less storage space; compared to token recomputation, HCache achieves up to 5.73X reduction in TTFT.

### SpinQuant: LLM quantization with learned rotations
**Authors**: Zechun Liu, Changsheng Zhao, Igor Fedorov, Bilge Soran, Dhruv Choudhary, Raghuraman Krishnamoorthi, Vikas Chandra, Yuandong Tian, Tijmen Blankevoort

**Updated**: 2024-10-07T01:27:59Z

**Summary**: Post-training quantization (PTQ) techniques applied to weights, activations, and the KV cache greatly reduce memory usage, latency, and power consumption of Large Language Models (LLMs), but may lead to large quantization errors when outliers are present. Rotating activation or weight matrices helps remove outliers and benefits quantization. In this work, we identify a collection of applicable rotation parameterizations that lead to identical outputs in full-precision Transformer architectures while enhancing quantization accuracy. In addition, we find that some random rotations lead to much better quantization than others, with an up to 13 points difference in downstream zero-shot reasoning performance. As a result, we propose SpinQuant, a novel approach that incorporates learned rotation matrices for optimal quantized network accuracy. With 4-bit quantization of weight, activation, and KV-cache, SpinQuant narrows the accuracy gap on zero-shot reasoning tasks with full precision to merely 2.9 points on the LLaMA-2 7B model, surpassing LLM-QAT by 19.1 points and SmoothQuant by 25.0 points. Furthermore, SpinQuant also outperforms concurrent work QuaRot, which applies random rotations to remove outliers. In particular, for LLaMA-3 8B models that are hard to quantize, SpinQuant reduces the gap to full precision by up to 45.1% relative to QuaRot.

### Superposed Decoding: Multiple Generations from a Single Autoregressive   Inference Pass
**Authors**: Ethan Shen, Alan Fan, Sarah M. Pratt, Jae Sung Park, Matthew Wallingford, Sham M. Kakade, Ari Holtzman, Ranjay Krishna, Ali Farhadi, Aditya Kusupati

**Updated**: 2024-10-06T22:13:16Z

**Summary**: Many applications today provide users with multiple auto-complete drafts as they type, including GitHub's code completion, Gmail's smart compose, and Apple's messaging auto-suggestions. Under the hood, language models support this by running an autoregressive inference pass to provide a draft. Consequently, providing $k$ drafts to the user requires running an expensive language model $k$ times. To alleviate the computation cost of running $k$ inference passes, we propose Superposed Decoding, a new decoding algorithm that generates $k$ drafts at the computation cost of one autoregressive inference pass. We achieve this by feeding a superposition of the most recent token embeddings from the $k$ drafts as input to the next decoding step of the language model. At every inference step we combine the $k$ drafts with the top-$k$ tokens to get $k^2$ new drafts and cache the $k$ most likely options, using an n-gram interpolation with minimal compute overhead to filter out incoherent generations. Our experiments show that $k$ drafts from Superposed Decoding are at least as coherent and factual as Nucleus Sampling and Greedy Decoding respectively, while being at least $2.44\times$ faster for $k\ge3$. In a compute-normalized setting, user evaluations demonstrably favor text generated by Superposed Decoding over Nucleus Sampling. Superposed Decoding can also be combined with other decoding strategies, resulting in universal coverage gains when scaling inference time compute. Code and more examples open-sourced at https://github.com/RAIVNLab/SuperposedDecoding.

### Self-compensating Light Calorimetry with Liquid Argon Time Projection   Chamber for GeV Neutrino Physics
**Authors**: Xuyang Ning, Wei Shi, Chao Zhang, Ciro Riccio, Jay Hyun Jo

**Updated**: 2024-10-06T19:36:34Z

**Summary**: Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LArTPC) is an exceptional dual calorimeter capable of estimating the energy of incident particles through both the ionization charge and the scintillation light. Our studies show that due to the mechanisms of charge recombination and light generation involved in the energy dissipation in liquid argon, light calorimetry in LArTPCs is inherently self-compensating: the missing energy in the hadronic component is compensated for by the extra recombination luminescence compared to the electromagnetic component. Good compensation of the electron-to-hadron response ratio (e/h) around unity can be achieved across a broad range of drift electric fields from 0.2 to 1.8 kV/cm.This inherent self-compensation enhances the appeal of light calorimetry in LArTPCs, complementing the well-established charge calorimetry. Using GeV neutrinos as a case study, we show that light calorimetry can achieve an energy resolution comparable to the more sophisticated charge imaging calorimetry. The synergy between light and charge calorimetry offers a novel approach to evaluating and mitigating systematic uncertainties in energy measurements with LArTPCs.

### Lazy Qubit Reordering for Accelerating Parallel State-Vector-based   Quantum Circuit Simulation
**Authors**: Yusuke Teranishi, Shoma Hiraoka, Wataru Mizukami, Masao Okita, Fumihiko Ino

**Updated**: 2024-10-05T18:20:37Z

**Summary**: This paper proposes two quantum operation scheduling methods for accelerating parallel state-vector-based quantum circuit simulation using multiple graphics processing units (GPUs). The proposed methods reduce all-to-all communication caused by qubit reordering (QR), which can dominate the overhead of parallel simulation. Our approach eliminates redundant QRs by introducing intentional delays in QR communications such that multiple QRs can be aggregated into a single QR. The delays are carefully introduced based on the principles of time-space tiling, or a cache optimization technique for classical computers, which we use to arrange the execution order of quantum operations. Moreover, we present an extended scheduling method for the hierarchical interconnection of GPU cluster systems to avoid slow inter-node communication. We develop these methods tailored for two primary procedures in variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) simulation: quantum state update (QSU) and expectation value computation (EVC). Experimental validation on 32-GPU executions demonstrates acceleration in QSU and EVC -- up to 54$\times$ and 606$\times$, respectively -- compared to existing methods. Moreover, our extended scheduling method further reduced communication time by up to 15\% in a two-layered interconnected cluster system. Our approach is useful for any quantum circuit simulations, including QSU and/or EVC.

### Accelerating Diffusion Transformers with Token-wise Feature Caching
**Authors**: Chang Zou, Xuyang Liu, Ting Liu, Siteng Huang, Linfeng Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-10-05T03:47:06Z

**Summary**: Diffusion transformers have shown significant effectiveness in both image and video synthesis at the expense of huge computation costs. To address this problem, feature caching methods have been introduced to accelerate diffusion transformers by caching the features in previous timesteps and reusing them in the following timesteps. However, previous caching methods ignore that different tokens exhibit different sensitivities to feature caching, and feature caching on some tokens may lead to 10$\times$ more destruction to the overall generation quality compared with other tokens. In this paper, we introduce token-wise feature caching, allowing us to adaptively select the most suitable tokens for caching, and further enable us to apply different caching ratios to neural layers in different types and depths. Extensive experiments on PixArt-$\alpha$, OpenSora, and DiT demonstrate our effectiveness in both image and video generation with no requirements for training. For instance, 2.36$\times$ and 1.93$\times$ acceleration are achieved on OpenSora and PixArt-$\alpha$ with almost no drop in generation quality.

### SwiftKV: Fast Prefill-Optimized Inference with Knowledge-Preserving   Model Transformation
**Authors**: Aurick Qiao, Zhewei Yao, Samyam Rajbhandari, Yuxiong He

**Updated**: 2024-10-04T22:45:26Z

**Summary**: LLM inference for popular enterprise use cases, such as summarization, RAG, and code-generation, typically observes orders of magnitude longer prompt lengths than generation lengths. This characteristic leads to high cost of prefill and increased response latency. In this paper, we present SwiftKV, a novel model transformation and distillation procedure specifically designed to reduce the time and cost of processing prompt tokens while preserving high quality of generated tokens. SwiftKV combines three key mechanisms: i) SingleInputKV, which prefills later layers' KV cache using a much earlier layer's output, allowing prompt tokens to skip much of the model computation, ii) AcrossKV, which merges the KV caches of neighboring layers to reduce the memory footprint and support larger batch size for higher throughput, and iii) a knowledge-preserving distillation procedure that can adapt existing LLMs for SwiftKV with minimal accuracy impact and low compute and data requirement. For Llama-3.1-8B and 70B, SwiftKV reduces the compute requirement of prefill by 50% and the memory requirement of the KV cache by 62.5% while incurring minimum quality degradation across a wide range of tasks. In the end-to-end inference serving using an optimized vLLM implementation, SwiftKV realizes up to 2x higher aggregate throughput and 60% lower time per output token. It can achieve a staggering 560 TFlops/GPU of normalized inference throughput, which translates to 16K tokens/s for Llama-3.1-70B in 16-bit precision on 4x H100 GPUs.

### HarmoniCa: Harmonizing Training and Inference for Better Feature Cache   in Diffusion Transformer Acceleration
**Authors**: Yushi Huang, Zining Wang, Ruihao Gong, Jing Liu, Xinjie Zhang, Jun Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-10-04T10:14:17Z

**Summary**: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have gained prominence for outstanding scalability and extraordinary performance in generative tasks. However, their considerable inference costs impede practical deployment. The feature cache mechanism, which involves storing and retrieving redundant computations across timesteps, holds promise for reducing per-step inference time in diffusion models. Most existing caching methods for DiT are manually designed. Although the learning-based approach attempts to optimize strategies adaptively, it suffers from discrepancies between training and inference, which hampers both the performance and acceleration ratio. Upon detailed analysis, we pinpoint that these discrepancies primarily stem from two aspects: (1) Prior Timestep Disregard, where training ignores the effect of cache usage at earlier timesteps, and (2) Objective Mismatch, where the training target (align predicted noise in each timestep) deviates from the goal of inference (generate the high-quality image). To alleviate these discrepancies, we propose HarmoniCa, a novel method that Harmonizes training and inference with a novel learning-based Caching framework built upon Step-Wise Denoising Training (SDT) and Image Error Proxy-Guided Objective (IEPO). Compared to the traditional training paradigm, the newly proposed SDT maintains the continuity of the denoising process, enabling the model to leverage information from prior timesteps during training, similar to the way it operates during inference. Furthermore, we design IEPO, which integrates an efficient proxy mechanism to approximate the final image error caused by reusing the cached feature. Therefore, IEPO helps balance final image quality and cache utilization, resolving the issue of training that only considers the impact of cache usage on the predicted output at each timestep.

### Unleashing the Potential of the Diffusion Model in Few-shot Semantic   Segmentation
**Authors**: Muzhi Zhu, Yang Liu, Zekai Luo, Chenchen Jing, Hao Chen, Guangkai Xu, Xinlong Wang, Chunhua Shen

**Updated**: 2024-10-04T07:54:58Z

**Summary**: The Diffusion Model has not only garnered noteworthy achievements in the realm of image generation but has also demonstrated its potential as an effective pretraining method utilizing unlabeled data. Drawing from the extensive potential unveiled by the Diffusion Model in both semantic correspondence and open vocabulary segmentation, our work initiates an investigation into employing the Latent Diffusion Model for Few-shot Semantic Segmentation. Recently, inspired by the in-context learning ability of large language models, Few-shot Semantic Segmentation has evolved into In-context Segmentation tasks, morphing into a crucial element in assessing generalist segmentation models. In this context, we concentrate on Few-shot Semantic Segmentation, establishing a solid foundation for the future development of a Diffusion-based generalist model for segmentation. Our initial focus lies in understanding how to facilitate interaction between the query image and the support image, resulting in the proposal of a KV fusion method within the self-attention framework. Subsequently, we delve deeper into optimizing the infusion of information from the support mask and simultaneously re-evaluating how to provide reasonable supervision from the query mask. Based on our analysis, we establish a simple and effective framework named DiffewS, maximally retaining the original Latent Diffusion Model's generative framework and effectively utilizing the pre-training prior. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the previous SOTA models in multiple settings.

### Prefixing Attention Sinks can Mitigate Activation Outliers for Large   Language Model Quantization

**Summary**: Despite recent advances in LLM quantization, activation quantization remains to be challenging due to the activation outliers. Conventional remedies, e.g., mixing precisions for different channels, introduce extra overhead and reduce the speedup. In this work, we develop a simple yet effective strategy to facilitate per-tensor activation quantization by preventing the generation of problematic tokens. Precisely, we propose a method to find a set of key-value cache, coined CushionCache, which mitigates outliers in subsequent tokens when inserted as a prefix. CushionCache works in two steps: First, we greedily search for a prompt token sequence that minimizes the maximum activation values in subsequent tokens. Then, we further tune the token cache to regularize the activations of subsequent tokens to be more quantization-friendly. The proposed method successfully addresses activation outliers of LLMs, providing a substantial performance boost for per-tensor activation quantization methods. We thoroughly evaluate our method over a wide range of models and benchmarks and find that it significantly surpasses the established baseline of per-tensor W8A8 quantization and can be seamlessly integrated with the recent activation quantization method.

### LoRC: Low-Rank Compression for LLMs KV Cache with a Progressive   Compression Strategy
**Authors**: Rongzhi Zhang, Kuang Wang, Liyuan Liu, Shuohang Wang, Hao Cheng, Chao Zhang, Yelong Shen

**Updated**: 2024-10-04T03:10:53Z

**Summary**: The Key-Value (KV) cache is a crucial component in serving transformer-based autoregressive large language models (LLMs), enabling faster inference by storing previously computed KV vectors. However, its memory consumption scales linearly with sequence length and batch size, posing a significant bottleneck in LLM deployment. Existing approaches to mitigate this issue include: (1) efficient attention variants integrated in upcycling stages, which requires extensive parameter tuning thus unsuitable for pre-trained LLMs; (2) KV cache compression at test time, primarily through token eviction policies, which often overlook inter-layer dependencies and can be task-specific.   This paper introduces an orthogonal approach to KV cache compression. We propose a low-rank approximation of KV weight matrices, allowing for plug-in integration with existing transformer-based LLMs without model retraining. To effectively compress KV cache at the weight level, we adjust for layerwise sensitivity and introduce a progressive compression strategy, which is supported by our theoretical analysis on how compression errors accumulate in deep networks. Our method is designed to function without model tuning in upcycling stages or task-specific profiling in test stages. Extensive experiments with LLaMA models ranging from 8B to 70B parameters across various tasks show that our approach significantly reduces the GPU memory footprint while maintaining performance.

### UNComp: Uncertainty-Aware Long-Context Compressor for Efficient Large   Language Model Inference
**Authors**: Jing Xiong, Jianghan Shen, Fanghua Ye, Chaofan Tao, Zhongwei Wan, Jianqiao Lu, Xun Wu, Chuanyang Zheng, Zhijiang Guo, Lingpeng Kong, Ngai Wong

**Updated**: 2024-10-04T02:32:36Z

**Summary**: Deploying large language models (LLMs) is challenging due to their high memory and computational demands, especially during long-context inference. While key-value (KV) caching accelerates inference by reusing previously computed keys and values, it also introduces significant memory overhead. Existing KV cache compression methods such as eviction and merging typically compress the KV cache after it is generated and overlook the eviction of hidden states, failing to improve the speed of the prefilling stage. Additionally, applying a uniform compression rate across different attention heads can harm crucial retrieval heads in needle-in-a-haystack tasks due to excessive compression. In this paper, we propose UNComp, an uncertainty-aware compression scheme that leverages matrix entropy to estimate model uncertainty across layers and heads at the token sequence level. By grouping layers and heads based on their uncertainty, UNComp adaptively compresses both the hidden states and the KV cache. Our method achieves a 1.6x speedup in the prefilling stage and reduces the KV cache to 4.74% of its original size, resulting in a 6.4x increase in throughput and a 1.4x speedup in inference with only a 1.41% performance loss. Remarkably, in needle-in-a-haystack tasks, UNComp outperforms the full-size KV cache even when compressed to 9.38% of its original size. Our approach offers an efficient, training-free Grouped-Query Attention paradigm that can be seamlessly integrated into existing KV cache schemes.

### Compute Or Load KV Cache? Why Not Both?
**Authors**: Shuowei Jin, Xueshen Liu, Qingzhao Zhang, Z. Morley Mao

**Updated**: 2024-10-04T01:11:09Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly increased context window sizes, enabling sophisticated applications but also introducing substantial computational overheads, particularly computing key-value (KV) cache in the prefill stage. Prefix caching has emerged to save GPU power in this scenario, which saves KV cache at disks and reuse them across multiple queries. However, traditional prefix caching mechanisms often suffer from substantial latency because the speed of loading KV cache from disks to GPU memory is bottlenecked by the throughput of I/O devices. To optimize the latency of long-context prefill, we propose Cake, a novel KV cache loader, which employs a bidirectional parallelized KV cache generation strategy. Upon receiving a prefill task, Cake simultaneously and dynamically loads saved KV cache from prefix cache locations and computes KV cache on local GPUs, maximizing the utilization of available computation and I/O bandwidth resources. Additionally, Cake automatically adapts to diverse system statuses without manual parameter. tuning. In experiments on various prompt datasets, GPUs, and I/O devices, Cake offers up to 68.1% Time To First Token (TTFT) reduction compare with compute-only method and 94.6% TTFT reduction compare with I/O-only method.

### DeFT: Decoding with Flash Tree-attention for Efficient Tree-structured   LLM Inference
**Authors**: Jinwei Yao, Kaiqi Chen, Kexun Zhang, Jiaxuan You, Binhang Yuan, Zeke Wang, Tao Lin

**Updated**: 2024-10-03T22:17:01Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly employed for complex tasks that process multiple generation calls in a tree structure with shared prefixes of tokens, including few-shot prompting, multi-step reasoning, speculative decoding, etc. However, existing inference systems for tree-based applications are inefficient due to improper partitioning of queries and KV cache during attention calculation. This leads to two main issues: (1) a lack of memory access (IO) reuse for KV cache of shared prefixes, and (2) poor load balancing.As a result, there is redundant KV cache IO between GPU global memory and shared memory, along with low GPU utilization. To address these challenges, we propose DeFT(Decoding with Flash Tree-Attention), a hardware-efficient attention algorithm with prefix-aware and load-balanced KV cache partitions. DeFT reduces the number of read/write operations of KV cache during attention calculation through KV-Guided Grouping, a method that avoids repeatedly loading KV cache of shared prefixes in attention computation. Additionally, we propose Flattened Tree KV Splitting, a mechanism that ensures even distribution of the KV cache across partitions with little computation redundancy, enhancing GPU utilization during attention computations. By reducing 73-99 KV cache IO and nearly 100 IO for partial results during attention calculation, DeFT achieves up to 2.52/3.82x speedup in the end-to-end/attention latency across three practical tree-based workloads compared to state-of-the-art attention algorithms.

### GaNI: Global and Near Field Illumination Aware Neural Inverse Rendering
**Authors**: Jiaye Wu, Saeed Hadadan, Geng Lin, Matthias Zwicker, David Jacobs, Roni Sengupta

**Updated**: 2024-10-03T22:11:19Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we present GaNI, a Global and Near-field Illumination-aware neural inverse rendering technique that can reconstruct geometry, albedo, and roughness parameters from images of a scene captured with co-located light and camera. Existing inverse rendering techniques with co-located light-camera focus on single objects only, without modeling global illumination and near-field lighting more prominent in scenes with multiple objects. We introduce a system that solves this problem in two stages; we first reconstruct the geometry powered by neural volumetric rendering NeuS, followed by inverse neural radiosity that uses the previously predicted geometry to estimate albedo and roughness. However, such a naive combination fails and we propose multiple technical contributions that enable this two-stage approach. We observe that NeuS fails to handle near-field illumination and strong specular reflections from the flashlight in a scene. We propose to implicitly model the effects of near-field illumination and introduce a surface angle loss function to handle specular reflections. Similarly, we observe that invNeRad assumes constant illumination throughout the capture and cannot handle moving flashlights during capture. We propose a light position-aware radiance cache network and additional smoothness priors on roughness to reconstruct reflectance. Experimental evaluation on synthetic and real data shows that our method outperforms the existing co-located light-camera-based inverse rendering techniques. Our approach produces significantly better reflectance and slightly better geometry than capture strategies that do not require a dark room.

### ReLIC: A Recipe for 64k Steps of In-Context Reinforcement Learning for   Embodied AI
**Authors**: Ahmad Elawady, Gunjan Chhablani, Ram Ramrakhya, Karmesh Yadav, Dhruv Batra, Zsolt Kira, Andrew Szot

**Updated**: 2024-10-03T17:58:11Z

**Summary**: Intelligent embodied agents need to quickly adapt to new scenarios by integrating long histories of experience into decision-making. For instance, a robot in an unfamiliar house initially wouldn't know the locations of objects needed for tasks and might perform inefficiently. However, as it gathers more experience, it should learn the layout of its environment and remember where objects are, allowing it to complete new tasks more efficiently. To enable such rapid adaptation to new tasks, we present ReLIC, a new approach for in-context reinforcement learning (RL) for embodied agents. With ReLIC, agents are capable of adapting to new environments using 64,000 steps of in-context experience with full attention while being trained through self-generated experience via RL. We achieve this by proposing a novel policy update scheme for on-policy RL called "partial updates'' as well as a Sink-KV mechanism that enables effective utilization of a long observation history for embodied agents. Our method outperforms a variety of meta-RL baselines in adapting to unseen houses in an embodied multi-object navigation task. In addition, we find that ReLIC is capable of few-shot imitation learning despite never being trained with expert demonstrations. We also provide a comprehensive analysis of ReLIC, highlighting that the combination of large-scale RL training, the proposed partial updates scheme, and the Sink-KV are essential for effective in-context learning. The code for ReLIC and all our experiments is at https://github.com/aielawady/relic

### Preble: Efficient Distributed Prompt Scheduling for LLM Serving
**Authors**: Vikranth Srivatsa, Zijian He, Reyna Abhyankar, Dongming Li, Yiying Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-10-03T17:50:33Z

**Summary**: Prompts to large language models (LLMs) have evolved beyond simple user questions. For LLMs to solve complex problems, today's practices are to include domain-specific instructions, illustration of tool usages, and/or long context such as textbook chapters in prompts. As such, many parts of prompts are repetitive across requests. Recent works propose to cache and reuse KV state of prompts. However, they are all confined to a single-GPU optimization, while production LLM serving systems are distributed by nature.   This paper proposes Preble, the first distributed LLM serving platform that targets and optimizes for prompt sharing. We designed a distributed scheduling system that co-optimizes KV state reuse and computation load-balancing with a new scheduling algorithm and a hierarchical scheduling mechanism. Our evaluation of Preble with real workloads and request arrival patterns on two open-source LLMs shows that Preble outperforms the SOTA serving systems by 1.5X to 14.5X on average latency and 2X to 10X on p99 latency.

### Disaggregated Memory with SmartNIC Offloading: a Case Study on Graph   Processing
**Authors**: Jacob Wahlgren, Gabin Schieffer, Maya Gokhale, Roger Pearce, Ivy Peng

**Updated**: 2024-10-03T15:41:31Z

**Summary**: Disaggregated memory breaks the boundary of monolithic servers to enable memory provisioning on demand. Using network-attached memory to provide memory expansion for memory-intensive applications on compute nodes can improve the overall memory utilization on a cluster and reduce the total cost of ownership. However, current software solutions for leveraging network-attached memory must consume resources on the compute node for memory management tasks. Emerging off-path smartNICs provide general-purpose programmability at low-cost low-power cores. This work provides a general architecture design that enables network-attached memory and offloading tasks onto off-path programmable SmartNIC. We provide a prototype implementation called SODA on Nvidia BlueField DPU. SODA adapts communication paths and data transfer alternatives, pipelines data movement stages, and enables customizable data caching and prefetching optimizations. We evaluate SODA in five representative graph applications on real-world graphs. Our results show that SODA can achieve up to 7.9x speedup compared to node-local SSD and reduce network traffic by 42% compared to disaggregated memory without SmartNIC offloading at similar or better performance.

### Learning from Offline Foundation Features with Tensor Augmentations
**Authors**: Emir Konuk, Christos Matsoukas, Moein Sorkhei, Phitchapha Lertsiravaramet, Kevin Smith

**Updated**: 2024-10-03T14:35:35Z

**Summary**: We introduce Learning from Offline Foundation Features with Tensor Augmentations (LOFF-TA), an efficient training scheme designed to harness the capabilities of foundation models in limited resource settings where their direct development is not feasible. LOFF-TA involves training a compact classifier on cached feature embeddings from a frozen foundation model, resulting in up to $37\times$ faster training and up to $26\times$ reduced GPU memory usage. Because the embeddings of augmented images would be too numerous to store, yet the augmentation process is essential for training, we propose to apply tensor augmentations to the cached embeddings of the original non-augmented images. LOFF-TA makes it possible to leverage the power of foundation models, regardless of their size, in settings with limited computational capacity. Moreover, LOFF-TA can be used to apply foundation models to high-resolution images without increasing compute. In certain scenarios, we find that training with LOFF-TA yields better results than directly fine-tuning the foundation model.

### Sub-cycle Nanotip Field Emission of Electrons Driven by Air Plasma   Generated THz Pulses
**Authors**: Benjamin Colmey, Rodrigo T. Paulino, Gaspard Beaufort, David G. Cooke

**Updated**: 2024-10-03T11:47:21Z

**Summary**: Terahertz pulses generated by two-color laser plasmas have reported peak field strengths exceeding MV/cm, and when illuminating metal nanotips the near-field enhancement at the tip apex should result in extremely high bunch charges and electron energies via sub-cycle cold field emission. Here, electron emission from tungsten nanotips driven by THz pulses generated by a long filament air-plasma are reported. Electron energies up to 1.1 keV and bunch charges up to 2x$10^5$ electrons per pulse were detected, well below values expected for peak field calculated via the time averaged Poynting vector. Investigations revealed a failure in the use of the time-averaged Poynting vector when applied to long filament THz pulses, due to spatio-temporal restructuring of the THz pulse in the focus. Accounting for this restructuring significantly reduces the field strength to approximately 160 ~kV/cm, consistent with the observed electron bunch charges, peak energies and their dependence on the tip position in the THz focus. Despite these findings, our results surpass previous THz plasma-driven electron generation by an order of magnitude in both electron energy and bunch charge and a path to increasing these by an additional order of magnitude by modification of the THz optics is proposed.

### PyramidKV: Dynamic KV Cache Compression based on Pyramidal Information   Funneling
**Authors**: Zefan Cai, Yichi Zhang, Bofei Gao, Yuliang Liu, Tianyu Liu, Keming Lu, Wayne Xiong, Yue Dong, Baobao Chang, Junjie Hu, Wen Xiao

**Updated**: 2024-10-03T08:46:42Z

**Summary**: In this study, we investigate whether attention-based information flow inside large language models (LLMs) is aggregated through noticeable patterns for long context processing. Our observations reveal that LLMs aggregate information through Pyramidal Information Funneling where attention is scattering widely in lower layers, progressively consolidating within specific contexts, and ultimately focusing on critical tokens (a.k.a massive activation or attention sink) in higher layers. Motivated by these insights, we developed PyramidKV, a novel and effective KV cache compression method. This approach dynamically adjusts the KV cache size across different layers, allocating more cache in lower layers and less in higher ones, diverging from traditional methods that maintain a uniform KV cache size. Our experimental evaluations, utilizing the LongBench benchmark, show that PyramidKV matches the performance of models with a full KV cache while retaining only 12% of the KV cache, thus significantly reducing memory usage. In scenarios emphasizing memory efficiency, where only 0.7% of the KV cache is maintained, PyramidKV surpasses other KV cache compression techniques, achieving up to a 20.5 absolute accuracy improvement on TREC dataset. In the Needle-in-a-Haystack experiment, PyramidKV outperforms competing methods in maintaining long-context comprehension in LLMs; notably, retaining just 128 KV cache entries enables the LLAMA-3-70B model to achieve 100% Acc. performance, matching that of a full KV cache.

### ThinK: Thinner Key Cache by Query-Driven Pruning
**Authors**: Yuhui Xu, Zhanming Jie, Hanze Dong, Lei Wang, Xudong Lu, Aojun Zhou, Amrita Saha, Caiming Xiong, Doyen Sahoo

**Updated**: 2024-10-03T03:03:29Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized the field of natural language processing, achieving unprecedented performance across a variety of applications. However, their increased computational and memory demands present significant challenges, especially when handling long sequences. This paper focuses on the long-context scenario, addressing the inefficiencies in KV cache memory consumption during inference. Unlike existing approaches that optimize the memory based on the sequence length, we identify substantial redundancy in the channel dimension of the KV cache, as indicated by an uneven magnitude distribution and a low-rank structure in the attention weights. In response, we propose ThinK, a novel query-dependent KV cache pruning method designed to minimize attention weight loss while selectively pruning the least significant channels. Our approach not only maintains or enhances model accuracy but also achieves a reduction in KV cache memory costs by over 20% compared with vanilla KV cache eviction and quantization methods. For instance, ThinK integrated with KIVI can achieve a 2.8x reduction in peak memory usage while maintaining nearly the same quality, enabling up to a 5x increase in batch size when using a single GPU. Extensive evaluations on the LLaMA and Mistral models across various long-sequence datasets verified the efficiency of ThinK, establishing a new baseline algorithm for efficient LLM deployment without compromising performance.

### Locret: Enhancing Eviction in Long-Context LLM Inference with Trained   Retaining Heads
**Authors**: Yuxiang Huang, Binhang Yuan, Xu Han, Chaojun Xiao, Zhiyuan Liu

**Updated**: 2024-10-02T17:59:52Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable advances in supporting long-context comprehension and processing tasks. However, scaling the generation inference of LLMs to such long contexts incurs significant additional computation load, and demands a substantial GPU memory footprint to maintain the key-value (KV) cache of transformer-based LLMs. Existing KV cache compression methods, such as quantization, face memory bottlenecks as context length increases, while static-sized caches, such as eviction, suffer from inefficient policies. These limitations restrict deployment on consumer-grade devices like a single Nvidia 4090 GPU. To overcome this, we propose Locret, a framework for long-context LLM inference that introduces retaining heads to evaluate the causal importance of KV cache units, allowing for more accurate eviction within a fixed cache size. Locret is fine-tuned on top of the frozen backbone LLM using a minimal amount of data from standard long-context SFT datasets. During inference, we evict low-importance cache units along with a chunked prefill pattern, significantly reducing peak GPU memory usage. We conduct an extensive empirical study to evaluate Locret, where the experimental results show that Locret outperforms the recent competitive approaches, including InfLLM, Quantization, SirLLM, and MInference, in terms of memory efficiency and the quality of generated contents -- Locret achieves over a 20x and 8x KV cache compression ratio compared to the full KV cache for Phi-3-mini-128K and Llama-3.1-8B-instruct. Additionally, Locret can be combined with other methods, such as quantization and token merging. To our knowledge, Locret is the first framework capable of deploying Llama-3.1-8B or similar models on a single Nvidia 4090 GPU, enabling 128K long-context inference without compromising generation quality, and requiring little additional system optimizations.

**Summary**: We address the problem of learning-augmented online caching in the scenario when each request is accompanied by a prediction of the next occurrence of the requested page. We improve currently known bounds on the competitive ratio of the BlindOracle algorithm, which evicts a page predicted to be requested last. We also prove a lower bound on the competitive ratio of any randomized algorithm and show that a combination of the BlindOracle with the Marker algorithm achieves a competitive ratio that is optimal up to some constant.

**Updated**: 2024-10-02T15:22:08Z

**Summary**: We address the challenge of efficient auto-regressive generation in sequence prediction models by introducing FutureFill: a method for fast generation that applies to any sequence prediction algorithm based on convolutional operators. Our approach reduces the generation time requirement from linear to square root relative to the context length. Additionally, FutureFill requires a prefill cache sized only by the number of tokens generated, which is smaller than the cache requirements for standard convolutional and attention-based models. We validate our theoretical findings with experimental evidence demonstrating correctness and efficiency gains in a synthetic generation task.

**Updated**: 2024-10-02T13:09:41Z

**Summary**: Handling long input contexts remains a significant challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly in resource-constrained environments such as mobile devices. Our work aims to address this limitation by introducing InfiniPot, a novel KV cache control framework designed to enable pre-trained LLMs to manage extensive sequences within fixed memory constraints efficiently, without requiring additional training. InfiniPot leverages Continual Context Distillation (CCD), an iterative process that compresses and retains essential information through novel importance metrics, effectively maintaining critical data even without access to future context. Our comprehensive evaluations indicate that InfiniPot significantly outperforms models trained for long contexts in various NLP tasks, establishing its efficacy and versatility. This work represents a substantial advancement toward making LLMs applicable to a broader range of real-world scenarios.

### A Little Goes a Long Way: Efficient Long Context Training and Inference   with Partial Contexts
**Authors**: Suyu Ge, Xihui Lin, Yunan Zhang, Jiawei Han, Hao Peng

**Updated**: 2024-10-02T12:35:53Z

**Summary**: Training and serving long-context large language models (LLMs) incurs substantial overhead. To address this, two critical steps are often required: a pretrained LLM typically undergoes a separate stage for context length extension by training on long-context data, followed by architectural modifications to reduce the overhead of KV cache during serving. This paper argues that integrating length extension with a GPU-friendly KV cache reduction architecture not only reduces training overhead during length extension, but also achieves better long-context performance. This leads to our proposed LongGen, which finetunes a pretrained LLM into an efficient architecture during length extension. LongGen builds on three key insights: (1) Sparse attention patterns, such as window attention (attending to recent tokens), attention sink (initial ones), and blockwise sparse attention (strided token blocks) are well-suited for building efficient long-context models, primarily due to their GPU-friendly memory access patterns, enabling efficiency gains not just theoretically but in practice as well. (2) It is essential for the model to have direct access to all tokens. A hybrid architecture with 1/3 full attention layers and 2/3 efficient ones achieves a balanced trade-off between efficiency and long-context performance. (3) Lightweight training on 5B long-context data is sufficient to extend the hybrid model's context length from 4K to 128K.   We evaluate LongGen on both Llama-2 7B and Llama-2 70B, demonstrating its effectiveness across different scales. During training with 128K-long contexts, LongGen achieves 1.55x training speedup and reduces wall-clock time by 36%, compared to a full-attention baseline. During inference, LongGen reduces KV cache memory by 62%, achieving 1.67x prefilling speedup and 1.41x decoding speedup.

### Attention Score is not All You Need for Token Importance Indicator in KV   Cache Reduction: Value Also Matters
**Authors**: Zhiyu Guo, Hidetaka Kamigaito, Taro Watanabe

**Updated**: 2024-10-02T00:19:13Z

**Summary**: Scaling the context size of large language models (LLMs) enables them to perform various new tasks, e.g., book summarization. However, the memory cost of the Key and Value (KV) cache in attention significantly limits the practical applications of LLMs. Recent works have explored token pruning for KV cache reduction in LLMs, relying solely on attention scores as a token importance indicator. However, our investigation into value vector norms revealed a notably non-uniform pattern questioning their reliance only on attention scores. Inspired by this, we propose a new method: Value-Aware Token Pruning (VATP) which uses both attention scores and the $ \ell_{1} $ norm of value vectors to evaluate token importance. Extensive experiments on LLaMA2-7B-chat and Vicuna-v1.5-7B across 16 LongBench tasks demonstrate that VATP outperforms attention-score-only baselines in over 12 tasks, confirming the effectiveness of incorporating value vector norms into token importance evaluation of LLMs.

### PARSIR: a Package for Effective Parallel Discrete Event Simulation on   Multi-processor Machines
**Authors**: Francesco Quaglia

**Updated**: 2024-10-01T12:55:47Z

**Summary**: In this article we present PARSIR (PARallel SImulation Runner), a package that enables the effective exploitation of shared-memory multi-processor machines for running discrete event simulation models. PARSIR is a compile/run-time environment for discrete event simulation models developed with the {\tt C} programming language. The architecture of PARSIR has been designed in order to keep low the amount of CPU-cycles required for running models. This is achieved via the combination of a set of techniques like: 1) causally consistent batch-processing of simulation events at an individual simulation object for caching effectiveness; 2) high likelihood of disjoint access parallelism; 3) the favoring of memory accesses on local NUMA (Non-Uniform-Memory-Access) nodes in the architecture, while still enabling well balanced workload distribution via work-stealing from remote nodes; 4) the use of RMW (Read-Modify-Write) machine instructions for fast access to simulation engine data required by the worker threads for managing the concurrent simulation objects and distributing the workload. Furthermore, any architectural solution embedded in the PARSIR engine is fully transparent to the application level code implementing the simulation model. We also provide experimental results showing the effectiveness of PARSIR when running the reference PHOLD benchmark on a NUMA shared-memory multi-processor machine equipped with 40 CPUs.

**Summary**: Merge sort as a divide-sort-merge paradigm has been widely applied in computer science fields. As modern reduced instruction set computing architectures like the fifth generation (RISC-V) regard multiple registers as a vector register group for wide instruction parallelism, optimizing merge sort with this vectorized property is becoming increasingly common. In this paper, we overhaul the divide-sort-merge paradigm, from its register-level sort to the cache-aware merge, to develop a fine-grained RISC-V vectorized merge sort (RVMS). From the register-level view, the inline vectorized transpose instruction is missed in RISC-V, so implementing it efficiently is non-trivial. Besides, the vectorized comparisons do not always work well in the merging networks. Both issues primarily stem from the expensive data shuffle instruction. To bypass it, RVMS strides to take register data as the proxy of data shuffle to accelerate the transpose operation, and meanwhile replaces vectorized comparisons with scalar cousin for more light real value swap. On the other hand, as cache-aware merge makes larger data merge in the cache, most merge schemes have two drawbacks: the in-cache merge usually has low cache utilization, while the out-of-cache merging network remains an ineffectively symmetric structure. To this end, we propose the half-merge scheme to employ the auxiliary space of in-place merge to halve the footprint of naive merge sort, and meanwhile copy one sequence to this space to avoid the former data exchange. Furthermore, an asymmetric merging network is developed to adapt to two different input sizes.

### Block-Attention for Efficient RAG
**Authors**: East Sun, Yan Wang, Lan Tian

**Updated**: 2024-10-01T03:40:08Z

**Summary**: We introduce Block-Attention, an attention mechanism designed to address the increased inference latency and cost in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) scenarios. Traditional approaches often encode the entire context. Instead, Block-Attention divides retrieved documents into discrete blocks, with each block independently calculating key-value (KV) states except for the final block. In RAG scenarios, by defining each passage as a block, Block-Attention enables us to reuse the KV states of passages that have been seen before, thereby significantly reducing the latency and the computation overhead during inference. The implementation of Block-Attention involves block segmentation, position re-encoding, and fine-tuning the LLM to adapt to the Block-Attention mechanism. Experiments on four RAG benchmarks demonstrate that after block fine-tuning, the Block-Attention model achieves performance comparable to self-attention models (68.4\% vs 67.9\% on Llama3) or even superior performance (62.8\% vs 59.6\% on Mistral). Notably, Block-Attention significantly reduces the time to first token (TTFT) and floating point operations (FLOPs) to a very low level. It only takes 45 ms to output the first token for an input sequence with a total length of 32K. Compared to the self-attention models, the time consumption and corresponding FLOPs are reduced by 98.7\% and 99.8\%, respectively.

### Self-controller: Controlling LLMs with Multi-round Step-by-step   Self-awareness
**Authors**: Xiao Peng, Xufan Geng

**Updated**: 2024-10-01T03:14:12Z

**Summary**: The applications of large language models (LLMs) have been widely spread across all domains. However, the basic abilities such as the controllability of LLMs are still limited. To address this, we propose "Self-controller", a novel agentic framework bringing self-awareness into LLMs' reasoning logic. The core idea of this work is to maintain states based on the LLM's response, letting the LLM become self-aware of current status and think step by step in a multi-round chain-of-thought paradigm. Our experiment on the state of textual length has shown the controllability and effectiveness of the Self-controller. We further implement a binary search algorithm to accelerate the generation process based on the linearity and monotonicity of the textual length state. Another advantage of the Self-controller comes with DeepSeek's Context Caching technology, which significantly saves computational token consumption when a cluster of conversations shares the same prefix of context. Theoretically, we prove that in this scenario the extra time complexity is $O(c \log n)$. Results of the back-of-the-envelope estimation suggest that the token consumption of our method is no more than twice as much as that of the trivial single-round generation. Furthermore, our ablation study on word constraints demonstrates the Self-controller's consistent controllability across all foundation models.

### GEAR: An Efficient KV Cache Compression Recipe for Near-Lossless   Generative Inference of LLM
**Authors**: Hao Kang, Qingru Zhang, Souvik Kundu, Geonhwa Jeong, Zaoxing Liu, Tushar Krishna, Tuo Zhao

**Updated**: 2024-09-30T22:44:58Z

**Summary**: Key-value (KV) caching has become the de-facto to accelerate generation speed for large language models (LLMs) inference. However, the growing cache demand with increasing sequence length has transformed LLM inference to be a memory bound problem, significantly constraining the system throughput. Existing methods rely on dropping unimportant tokens or quantizing all entries uniformly. Such methods, however, often incur high approximation errors to represent the compressed matrices. The autoregressive decoding process further compounds the error of each step, resulting in critical deviation in model generation and deterioration of performance. To tackle this challenge, we propose GEAR, an efficient KV cache compression framework that achieves near-lossless high-ratio compression. GEAR first applies quantization to majority of entries of similar magnitudes to ultra-low precision. It then employs a low rank matrix to approximate the quantization error, and a sparse matrix to remedy individual errors from outlier entries. By adeptly integrating three techniques, GEAR is able to fully exploit their synergistic potentials. Our experiments demonstrate that compared to alternatives, GEAR achieves near-lossless 4-bit KV cache compression with up to 2.38x throughput improvement, while reducing peak-memory size up to 2.29x. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/HaoKang-Timmy/GEAR.

### Cache-Oblivious Representation of B-Tree Structures
**Authors**: Luk√°≈° Ondr√°ƒçek, Ond≈ôej Miƒçka

**Updated**: 2024-09-30T18:23:07Z

**Summary**: We propose a general data structure CORoBTS for storing B-tree-like search trees dynamically in a cache-oblivious way combining the van Emde Boas memory layout with packed memory array.   In the use of the vEB layout mostly search complexity was considered, so far. We show the complexity of depth-first search of a subtree and contiguous memory area and provide better insight into the relationship between positions of vertices in tree and in memory. We describe how to build an arbitrary tree in vEB layout if we can simulate its depth-first search. Similarly, we examine batch updates of packed memory array.   In CORoBTS, the stored search tree has to satisfy that all leaves are at the same depth and vertices have arity between the chosen constants $a$ and $b$. The data structure allows searching with an optimal I/O complexity $\mathcal{O}(\log_B{N})$ and is stored in linear space. It provides operations for inserting and removing a subtree; both have an amortized I/O complexity $\mathcal{O}(S\cdot(\log^2 N)/B + \log_B N\cdot\log\log S + 1)$ and amortized time complexity $\mathcal{O}(S\cdot\log^2 N)$, where $S$ is the size of the subtree and $N$ the size of the whole stored tree. Rebuilding an existing subtree saves the multiplicative $\mathcal{O}(\log^2 N)$ in both complexities if the number of vertices on individual tree levels is not changed; it is paid only for the inserted/removed vertices otherwise.   Modifying cache-oblivious partially persistent array proposed by Davoodi et al. [ESA, pages 296-308. Springer, 2014] to use CORoBTS improves its space complexity from $\mathcal{O}(U^{\log_2 3} + V \log U)$ to $\mathcal{O}(U + V \log U)$, where $U$ is the maximal size of the array and $V$ is the number of versions; the data locality and I/O complexity of both present and persistent reads are kept unchanged; I/O complexity of writes is worsened by a polylogarithmic factor.

### Impact of Device Caching and Handovers on the Performance of 3D UAV   Networks with Blockages
**Authors**: Neetu R R, Gourab Ghatak, Vivek Ashok Bohara

**Updated**: 2024-09-30T15:53:36Z

**Summary**: We investigate an urban network characterized by blockages, where unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) offer ad-hoc coverage to mobile users with distinct service rate requirements. The UAV-BSs are modeled using a two-dimensional (2-D) marked-poisson point process (MPPP), where the marks represent the altitude of each UAV-base station (UAV-BS). Initially, we model the network blockages and analyze the association probabilities of line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) UAV-BSs using stochastic geometry. Subsequently, we derive the bth moment of the conditional success probability (CSP) and employ a meta distribution (MD)-based analytical framework of signal-to-interference noise ratio (SINR) taking into account the blockage distribution in the network. Furthermore, we proposea cache-based handover management strategy that dynamically selects the cell search time and delays the received signal strength (RSS)-based base station (BS) associations. This strategy aims to minimize unnecessary handovers (HOs) experienced by users by leveraging caching capabilities at user equipment (UE). We evaluate the HO rate and average throughput experienced by users ensuring their service rate requirements are met. We demonstrate that LoS associations decrease as the network density increases due to the substantial increase of NLoS UAV-BSs in the network. Additionally, we show that the presence of blockages does not necessarily have a negative impact on network reliability

### Multi-Antenna Coded Caching for Multi-Access Networks with Cyclic   Wrap-Around
**Authors**: Elizabath Peter, K. K. Krishnan Namboodiri, B. Sundar Rajan

**Updated**: 2024-09-30T14:38:41Z

**Summary**: This work explores a multiple transmit antenna setting in a multi-access coded caching (MACC) network where each user accesses more than one cache. A MACC network has $K$ users and $K$ caches, and each user has access to $r < K$ consecutive caches in a cyclic wrap-around manner. There are $L$ antennas at the server, and each cache has a normalized size of $M/N \leq 1$. The cyclic wrap-around MACC network with a single antenna at the server has been a well-investigated topic, and several coded caching schemes and improved lower bounds on the performance are known for the same. However, this MACC network has not yet been studied under multi-antenna settings in the coded caching literature. We study the multi-antenna MACC problem and propose a solution for the same by constructing a pair of arrays called caching and delivery arrays. We present three constructions of caching and delivery arrays for different scenarios and obtain corresponding multi-antenna MACC schemes for the same. Two schemes resulting from the above constructions achieve optimal performance under uncoded placement and one-shot delivery. The optimality is shown by matching the performance of the multi-antenna MACC scheme to that of an optimal multi-antenna scheme for a dedicated cache network having an identical number of users, and each user has a normalized cache size of $rM/N$. Further, as a special case, one of the proposed schemes subsumes an existing optimal MACC scheme for the single-antenna setting.

### Improving Achievability of Cache-Aided Private Variable-Length Coding   with Zero Leakage
**Authors**: Amirreza Zamani, Mikael Skoglund

**Updated**: 2024-09-30T09:33:37Z

**Summary**: A statistical cache-aided compression problem with a privacy constraint is studied, where a server has access to a database of $N$ files, $(Y_1,...,Y_N)$, each of size $F$ bits and is linked through a shared channel to $K$ users, where each has access to a local cache memory of size $MF$ bits. During the placement phase, the server fills the users' caches without prior knowledge of their demands, while the delivery phase takes place after the users send their demands to the server. We assume that each file in database $Y_i$ is arbitrarily correlated with a private attribute $X$, and an adversary is assumed to have access to the shared channel. The users and the server have access to a shared key $W$. The goal is to design the cache contents and the delivered message $\cal C$ such that the average length of $\mathcal{C}$ is minimized, while satisfying: i. The response $\cal C$ does not reveal any information about $X$, i.e., $I(X;\mathcal{C})=0$; ii. User $i$ can decode its demand, $Y_{d_i}$, by using the shared key $W$, $\cal C$, and its local cache $Z_i$. In a previous work, we have proposed a variable-length coding scheme that combines privacy-aware compression with coded caching techniques. In this paper, we propose a new achievability scheme using minimum entropy coupling concept and a greedy entropy-based algorithm. We show that the proposed scheme improves the previous results. Moreover, considering two special cases we improve the obtained bounds using the common information concept.

### The Early Bird Catches the Leak: Unveiling Timing Side Channels in LLM   Serving Systems
**Authors**: Linke Song, Zixuan Pang, Wenhao Wang, Zihao Wang, XiaoFeng Wang, Hongbo Chen, Wei Song, Yier Jin, Dan Meng, Rui Hou

**Updated**: 2024-09-30T06:55:00Z

**Summary**: The wide deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) has given rise to strong demands for optimizing their inference performance. Today's techniques serving this purpose primarily focus on reducing latency and improving throughput through algorithmic and hardware enhancements, while largely overlooking their privacy side effects, particularly in a multi-user environment. In our research, for the first time, we discovered a set of new timing side channels in LLM systems, arising from shared caches and GPU memory allocations, which can be exploited to infer both confidential system prompts and those issued by other users. These vulnerabilities echo security challenges observed in traditional computing systems, highlighting an urgent need to address potential information leakage in LLM serving infrastructures. In this paper, we report novel attack strategies designed to exploit such timing side channels inherent in LLM deployments, specifically targeting the Key-Value (KV) cache and semantic cache widely used to enhance LLM inference performance. Our approach leverages timing measurements and classification models to detect cache hits, allowing an adversary to infer private prompts with high accuracy. We also propose a token-by-token search algorithm to efficiently recover shared prompt prefixes in the caches, showing the feasibility of stealing system prompts and those produced by peer users. Our experimental studies on black-box testing of popular online LLM services demonstrate that such privacy risks are completely realistic, with significant consequences. Our findings underscore the need for robust mitigation to protect LLM systems against such emerging threats.

### FAST: A Dual-tier Few-Shot Learning Paradigm for Whole Slide Image   Classification
**Authors**: Kexue Fu, Xiaoyuan Luo, Linhao Qu, Shuo Wang, Ying Xiong, Ilias Maglogiannis, Longxiang Gao, Manning Wang

**Updated**: 2024-09-29T14:31:52Z

**Summary**: The expensive fine-grained annotation and data scarcity have become the primary obstacles for the widespread adoption of deep learning-based Whole Slide Images (WSI) classification algorithms in clinical practice. Unlike few-shot learning methods in natural images that can leverage the labels of each image, existing few-shot WSI classification methods only utilize a small number of fine-grained labels or weakly supervised slide labels for training in order to avoid expensive fine-grained annotation. They lack sufficient mining of available WSIs, severely limiting WSI classification performance. To address the above issues, we propose a novel and efficient dual-tier few-shot learning paradigm for WSI classification, named FAST. FAST consists of a dual-level annotation strategy and a dual-branch classification framework. Firstly, to avoid expensive fine-grained annotation, we collect a very small number of WSIs at the slide level, and annotate an extremely small number of patches. Then, to fully mining the available WSIs, we use all the patches and available patch labels to build a cache branch, which utilizes the labeled patches to learn the labels of unlabeled patches and through knowledge retrieval for patch classification. In addition to the cache branch, we also construct a prior branch that includes learnable prompt vectors, using the text encoder of visual-language models for patch classification. Finally, we integrate the results from both branches to achieve WSI classification. Extensive experiments on binary and multi-class datasets demonstrate that our proposed method significantly surpasses existing few-shot classification methods and approaches the accuracy of fully supervised methods with only 0.22$\%$ annotation costs. All codes and models will be publicly available on https://github.com/fukexue/FAST.

### Development of a 3D-printed canine head phantom for veterinary   radiotherapy
**Authors**: Sandhya Rottoo, Luke Frangella, Magdalena Bazalova-Carter, Olivia Masella

**Updated**: 2024-09-29T12:53:29Z

**Summary**: Purpose: To develop the Ultimate Phantom Dog for Orthovoltage Glioma Treatment (UPDOG), an anatomically-correct phantom which mimics a dog's head, for quality assurance (QA) of kilovoltage (kV) radiotherapy treatments.   Methods: A computed tomography (CT) scan of a canine glioma patient was segmented into bone and soft tissue using 3DSlicer. The segments were converted to stereolithographic (STL) files and smoothed in Fusion360. A slit to accommodate a radiochromic film (RCF) was added at the location of the glioma tumor. UPDOG was 3D printed on a polyjet printer using VeroUltraWhite ($\rho$ = 1.19-1.20 g/cm\textsuperscript{3}) for the bone and Agilus30 ($\rho$ = 1.14-1.15 g/cm\textsuperscript{3}) for the soft tissue. CT scans of UPDOG were acquired on a clinical CT scanner. An LD-V1 RCF was inserted into UPDOG and irradiated with a kV x-ray source from two angles. The delivered dose to the RCF was compared to Monte Carlo (MC) simulations performed in TOPAS.   Results: The bone and soft tissue segments in UPDOG were mimicked the patient anatomy well with tube voltage-dependent CT numbers. The contrast in HU was of 49, 47 and 50 HU for the 80, 100, and 120 kVp scans, respectively, sufficient for anatomy visualization. The irradiations delivered a maximum dose to RCF of 284 mGy which was compared to the results of MC simulations using a depth dose curve and central-axis (CAX) beam profiles. The mean difference in CAX profiles and PDD between RCF and MC results was 15.9\% and 2.3\%, respectively.   Conclusions: We have demonstrated that UPDOG is a useful QA tool for kV canine radiotherapy. UPDOG successfully anatomically mimicked the dog anatomy, with a reduced but sufficient bone contrast. We showed that dose delivered to a canine glioma with kV x-rays can be successfully measured with an RCF positioned at the tumor location.

### RTL2M$Œº$PATH: Multi-$Œº$PATH Synthesis with Applications to Hardware   Security Verification
**Authors**: Yao Hsiao, Nikos Nikoleris, Artem Khyzha, Dominic P. Mulligan, Gustavo Petri, Christopher W. Fletcher, Caroline Trippel

**Updated**: 2024-09-28T23:01:48Z

**Summary**: The Check tools automate formal memory consistency model and security verification of processors by analyzing abstract models of microarchitectures, called $\mu$SPEC models. Despite the efficacy of this approach, a verification gap between $\mu$SPEC models, which must be manually written, and RTL limits the Check tools' broad adoption. Our prior work, called RTL2$\mu$SPEC, narrows this gap by automatically synthesizing formally verified $\mu$SPEC models from SystemVerilog implementations of simple processors. But, RTL2$\mu$SPEC assumes input designs where an instruction (e.g., a load) cannot exhibit more than one microarchitectural execution path ($\mu$PATH, e.g., a cache hit or miss path) -- its single-execution-path assumption.   In this paper, we first propose an automated approach and tool, called RTL2M$\mu$PATH, that resolves RTL2$\mu$SPEC's single-execution-path assumption. Given a SystemVerilog processor design, instruction encodings, and modest design metadata, RTL2M$\mu$PATH finds a complete set of formally verified $\mu$PATHs for each instruction. Next, we make an important observation: an instruction that can exhibit more than one $\mu$PATH strongly indicates the presence of a microarchitectural side channel in the input design. Based on this observation, we then propose an automated approach and tool, called SynthLC, that extends RTL2M$\mu$PATH with a symbolic information flow analysis to support synthesizing a variety of formally verified leakage contracts from SystemVerilog processor designs. Leakage contracts are foundational to state-of-the-art defenses against hardware side-channel attacks. SynthLC is the first automated methodology for formally verifying hardware adherence to them.

### DOTA: Distributional Test-Time Adaptation of Vision-Language Models
**Authors**: Zongbo Han, Jialong Yang, Junfan Li, Qinghua Hu, Qianli Xu, Mike Zheng Shou, Changqing Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-09-28T15:03:28Z

**Summary**: Vision-language foundation models (e.g., CLIP) have shown remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks. However, deploying these models may be unreliable when significant distribution gaps exist between the training and test data. The training-free test-time dynamic adapter (TDA) is a promising approach to address this issue by storing representative test samples to guide the classification of subsequent ones. However, TDA only naively maintains a limited number of reference samples in the cache, leading to severe test-time catastrophic forgetting when the cache is updated by dropping samples. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective method for DistributiOnal Test-time Adaptation (Dota). Instead of naively memorizing representative test samples, Dota continually estimates the distributions of test samples, allowing the model to continually adapt to the deployment environment. The test-time posterior probabilities are then computed using the estimated distributions based on Bayes' theorem for adaptation purposes. To further enhance the adaptability on the uncertain samples, we introduce a new human-in-the-loop paradigm which identifies uncertain samples, collects human-feedback, and incorporates it into the Dota framework. Extensive experiments validate that Dota enables CLIP to continually learn, resulting in a significant improvement compared to current state-of-the-art methods.

### Analog In-Memory Computing Attention Mechanism for Fast and   Energy-Efficient Large Language Models
**Authors**: Nathan Leroux, Paul-Philipp Manea, Chirag Sudarshan, Jan Finkbeiner, Sebastian Siegel, John Paul Strachan, Emre Neftci

**Updated**: 2024-09-28T11:00:11Z

**Summary**: Transformer neural networks, driven by self-attention mechanisms, are core components of foundational and Large Language Models. In generative transformers, self-attention uses cache memory to store token projections, avoiding recomputation at each time step. However, GPU-stored projections must be loaded into SRAM for each new generation step, causing latency and energy bottlenecks for long sequences. In this work, we propose a fast and energy-efficient hardware implementation of self-attention using analog in-memory computing based on gain cell memories. Volatile gain cell memories can be efficiently written to store new tokens during sequence generation, while performing analog signed weight multiplications to compute the dot-products required for self-attention. We implement Sliding Window Attention, which keeps memory of a finite set of past steps. A charge-to-pulse converter for array readout eliminates the need for analog-to-digital conversion between self-attention stages. Using a co-designed initialization algorithm to adapt pre-trained weights to gain cell non-idealities, we achieve NLP performance comparable to ChatGPT-2 with minimal training iterations, despite hardware constraints. Our end-to-end hardware design includes digital controls, estimating area, latency, and energy. The system reduces attention latency by up to two orders of magnitude and energy consumption by up to five orders compared to GPUs, marking a significant step toward ultra-fast, low-power sequence generation in Large Language Models.

### Token Caching for Diffusion Transformer Acceleration
**Authors**: Jinming Lou, Wenyang Luo, Yufan Liu, Bing Li, Xinmiao Ding, Weiming Hu, Jiajiong Cao, Yuming Li, Chenguang Ma

**Updated**: 2024-09-27T08:05:34Z

**Summary**: Diffusion transformers have gained substantial interest in diffusion generative modeling due to their outstanding performance. However, their high computational cost, arising from the quadratic computational complexity of attention mechanisms and multi-step inference, presents a significant bottleneck. To address this challenge, we propose TokenCache, a novel post-training acceleration method that leverages the token-based multi-block architecture of transformers to reduce redundant computations among tokens across inference steps. TokenCache specifically addresses three critical questions in the context of diffusion transformers: (1) which tokens should be pruned to eliminate redundancy, (2) which blocks should be targeted for efficient pruning, and (3) at which time steps caching should be applied to balance speed and quality. In response to these challenges, TokenCache introduces a Cache Predictor that assigns importance scores to tokens, enabling selective pruning without compromising model performance. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive block selection strategy to focus on blocks with minimal impact on the network's output, along with a Two-Phase Round-Robin (TPRR) scheduling policy to optimize caching intervals throughout the denoising process. Experimental results across various models demonstrate that TokenCache achieves an effective trade-off between generation quality and inference speed for diffusion transformers. Our code will be publicly available.

### In-place Switch: Reprogramming based SLC Cache Design for Hybrid 3D SSDs
**Authors**: Xufeng Yang, Zhengjian Cong, Congming Gao

**Updated**: 2024-10-12T02:11:14Z

**Summary**: Recently, 3D SSDs are widely adopted in PCs, data centers, and cloud storage systems. To increase capacity, high bit-density cells, such as Triple-Level Cell (TLC), are utilized within 3D SSDs. However, due to the inferior performance of TLC, a portion of TLCs is configured to operate as Single-Level Cell (SLC) to provide high performance, with host data initially directed to the SLCs. In SLC/TLC hybrid 3D SSDs, a portion of the TLC space is designated as an SLC cache to achieve high SSD performance by writing host data at the SLC speed. Given the limited size of the SLC cache, block reclamation is necessary to free up the SLC cache during idle periods. However, our preliminary studies indicate that the SLC cache can lead to a performance cliff if filled rapidly and cause significant write amplification when data migration occurs during idle times.   In this work, we propose leveraging a reprogram operation to address these challenges. Specifically, when the SLC cache is full or during idle periods, a reprogram operation is performed to switch used SLC pages to TLC pages in place (termed In-place Switch, IPS). Subsequently, other free TLC space is allocated as the new SLC cache. IPS can continuously provide sufficient SLC cache within SSDs, significantly improving write performance and reducing write amplification. Experimental results demonstrate that IPS can reduce write latency and write amplification by up to 0.75 times and 0.53 times, respectively, compared to state-of-the-art SLC cache technologies.

### FlooNoC: A 645 Gbps/link 0.15 pJ/B/hop Open-Source NoC with Wide   Physical Links and End-to-End AXI4 Parallel Multi-Stream Support
**Authors**: Tim Fischer, Michael Rogenmoser, Thomas Benz, Frank K. G√ºrkaynak, Luca Benini

**Updated**: 2024-09-26T07:44:47Z

**Summary**: The new generation of domain-specific AI accelerators is characterized by rapidly increasing demands for bulk data transfers, as opposed to small, latency-critical cache line transfers typical of traditional cache-coherent systems. In this paper, we address this critical need by introducing the FlooNoC Network-on-Chip (NoC), featuring very wide, fully Advanced eXtensible Interface (AXI4) compliant links designed to meet the massive bandwidth needs at high energy efficiency. At the transport level, non-blocking transactions are supported for latency tolerance. Additionally, a novel end-to-end ordering approach for AXI4, enabled by a multi-stream capable Direct Memory Access (DMA) engine simplifies network interfaces and eliminates inter-stream dependencies. Furthermore, dedicated physical links are instantiated for short, latency-critical messages. A complete end-to-end reference implementation in 12nm FinFET technology demonstrates the physical feasibility and power performance area (PPA) benefits of our approach. Utilizing wide links on high levels of metal, we achieve a bandwidth of 645 Gbps per link and a total aggregate bandwidth of 103 Tbps for an 8x4 mesh of processors cluster tiles, with a total of 288 RISC-V cores. The NoC imposes a minimal area overhead of only 3.5% per compute tile and achieves a leading-edge energy efficiency of 0.15 pJ/B/hop at 0.8 V. Compared to state-of-the-art NoCs, our system offers three times the energy efficiency and more than double the link bandwidth. Furthermore, compared to a traditional AXI4-based multi-layer interconnect, our NoC achieves a 30% reduction in area, corresponding to a 47% increase in GFLOPSDP within the same floorplan.

### NiOx/\b{eta}-Ga2O3 Heterojunction Diode Achieving Breakdown Voltage >3   kV with Plasma Etch Field-Termination
**Authors**: Yizheng Liu, Saurav Roy, Carl Peterson, Arkka Bhattacharyya, Sriram Krishnamoorthy

**Updated**: 2024-09-25T21:37:01Z

**Summary**: This work reports the fabrication and characterization of a NiOx/\b{eta}-Ga2O3 heterojunction diode (HJD) that uses a metallic nickel (Ni) target to deposit NiOx layers via reactive RF magnetron sputtering and lift-off processing with >3 kV breakdown voltage, record-low reverse current leakage under high reverse bias, and high junction electric fields (>3.34 MV/cm). The heterojunction diodes are fabricated via bilayer NiOx sputtering followed by self-aligned mesa-etching for field-termination on both large (1-mm2) and small area (100-{\mu}m diameter) devices. The HJD exhibits a ~135 A/cm2 forward current density at 5 V with a rectifying ratio of ~1010. The minimum differential specific on-resistance is measured to be 17.26 m{\Omega} cm2. The breakdown voltage on 100-{\mu}m diameter pads was measured to be greater than 3 kV with a noise floor-level reverse leakage current density (10-8~10-6 A/cm2) until 3 kV, accomplishing a parallel-plane junction electric field to be at least 3.34 MV/cm at 3 kV with a power figure of merit (PFOM) >0.52 GW/cm2. Temperature-dependent forward current density-voltage (J-V) measurements are performed from room temperature (25 C) to 200 C which showed a temperature coefficient of resistance ({\alpha}) equaling 1.56, higher than that of \b{eta}-Ga2O3 Schottky barrier diodes (SBDs), indicating potential conductivity degradation within NiOx at elevated temperatures.

### Mnemosyne: Parallelization Strategies for Efficiently Serving   Multi-Million Context Length LLM Inference Requests Without Approximations
**Authors**: Amey Agrawal, Junda Chen, √ç√±igo Goiri, Ramachandran Ramjee, Chaojie Zhang, Alexey Tumanov, Esha Choukse

**Updated**: 2024-09-25T18:21:05Z

**Summary**: As large language models (LLMs) evolve to handle increasingly longer contexts, serving inference requests for context lengths in the range of millions of tokens presents unique challenges. While existing techniques are effective for training, they fail to address the unique challenges of inference, such as varying prefill and decode phases and their associated latency constraints - like Time to First Token (TTFT) and Time Between Tokens (TBT). Furthermore, there are no long context inference solutions that allow batching requests to increase the hardware utilization today.   In this paper, we propose three key innovations for efficient interactive long context LLM inference, without resorting to any approximation: adaptive chunking to reduce prefill overheads in mixed batching, Sequence Pipeline Parallelism (SPP) to lower TTFT, and KV Cache Parallelism (KVP) to minimize TBT. These contributions are combined into a 3D parallelism strategy, enabling Mnemosyne to scale interactive inference to context lengths at least up to 10 million tokens with high throughput enabled with batching. To our knowledge, Mnemosyne is the first to be able to achieve support for 10 million long context inference efficiently, while satisfying production-grade SLOs on TBT (30ms) on contexts up to and including 10 million.

### Adaptive Cost Model for Query Optimization
**Authors**: Nikita Vasilenko, Alexander Demin, Denis Ponomaryov

**Updated**: 2024-09-25T17:55:07Z

**Summary**: The principal component of conventional database query optimizers is a cost model that is used to estimate expected performance of query plans. The accuracy of the cost model has direct impact on the optimality of execution plans selected by the optimizer and thus, on the resulting query latency. Several common parameters of cost models in modern DBMS are related to the performance of CPU and I/O and are typically set by a database administrator upon system tuning. However these performance characteristics are not stable and therefore, a single point estimation may not suffice for all DB load regimes. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Cost Model (ACM) which dynamically optimizes CPU- and I/O-related plan cost parameters at DB runtime. By continuously monitoring query execution statistics and the state of DB buffer cache ACM adjusts cost parameters without the need for manual intervention from a database administrator. This allows for responding to changes in the workload and system performance ensuring more optimal query execution plans. We describe the main ideas in the implementation of ACM and report on a preliminary experimental evaluation showing 20\% end-to-end latency improvement on TPC-H benchmark.

### Event-Triggered Non-Linear Control of Offshore MMC Grids for   Asymmetrical AC Faults
**Authors**: Naajein Cherat, Vaibhav Nougain, Milovan Majstoroviƒá, Peter Palensky, Aleksandra Lekiƒá

**Updated**: 2024-09-25T08:52:07Z

**Summary**: Fault ride-through capability studies of MMC-HVDC connected wind power plants have focused primarily on the DC link and onshore AC grid faults. Offshore AC faults, mainly asymmetrical faults have not gained much attention in the literature despite being included in the future development at national levels in the ENTSO-E HVDC code. The proposed work gives an event-triggered control to stabilize the system once the offshore AC fault has occurred, identified, and isolated. Different types of control actions such as proportional-integral (PI) controller and super-twisted sliding mode control (STSMC) are used to smoothly transition the post-fault system to a new steady state operating point by suppressing the negative sequence control. Initially, the effect of a negative sequence current control scheme on the transient behavior of the power system with a PI controller is discussed in this paper. Further, a non-linear control strategy (STSMC) is proposed which gives quicker convergence of the system post-fault in comparison to PI control action. These post-fault control operations are only triggered in the presence of a fault in the system, i.e., they are event-triggered. The validity of the proposed strategy is demonstrated by simulation on a $\pm$525 kV, three-terminal meshed MMC-HVDC system model in Real Time Digital Simulator (RTDS).

### AlignedKV: Reducing Memory Access of KV-Cache with Precision-Aligned   Quantization
**Authors**: Yifan Tan, Haoze Wang, Chao Yan, Yangdong Deng

**Updated**: 2024-09-25T01:39:02Z

**Summary**: Model quantization has become a crucial technique to address the issues of large memory consumption and long inference times associated with LLMs. Mixed-precision quantization, which distinguishes between important and unimportant parameters, stands out among numerous quantization schemes as it achieves a balance between precision and compression rate. However, existing approaches can only identify important parameters through qualitative analysis and manual experiments without quantitatively analyzing how their importance is determined. We propose a new criterion, so-called 'precision alignment', to build a quantitative framework to holistically evaluate the importance of parameters in mixed-precision quantization. Our observations on floating point addition under various real-world scenarios suggest that two addends should have identical precision, otherwise the information in the higher-precision number will be wasted. Such an observation offers an essential principle to determine the precision of each parameter in matrix multiplication operation. As the first step towards applying the above discovery to large model inference, we develop a dynamic KV-Cache quantization technique to effectively reduce memory access latency. Different from existing quantization approaches that focus on memory saving, this work directly aims to accelerate LLM inference through quantifying floating numbers. The proposed technique attains a 25% saving of memory access and delivers up to 1.3x speedup in the computation of attention in the decoding phase of LLM, with almost no loss of precision.

### SWARM: Replicating Shared Disaggregated-Memory Data in No Time
**Authors**: Antoine Murat, Cl√©ment Burgelin, Athanasios Xygkis, Igor Zablotchi, Marcos K. Aguilera, Rachid Guerraoui

**Updated**: 2024-09-24T17:28:47Z

**Summary**: Memory disaggregation is an emerging data center architecture that improves resource utilization and scalability. Replication is key to ensure the fault tolerance of applications, but replicating shared data in disaggregated memory is hard. We propose SWARM (Swift WAit-free Replication in disaggregated Memory), the first replication scheme for in-disaggregated-memory shared objects to provide (1) single-roundtrip reads and writes in the common case, (2) strong consistency (linearizability), and (3) strong liveness (wait-freedom). SWARM makes two independent contributions. The first is Safe-Guess, a novel wait-free replication protocol with single-roundtrip operations. The second is In-n-Out, a novel technique to provide conditional atomic update and atomic retrieval of large buffers in disaggregated memory in one roundtrip. Using SWARM, we build SWARM-KV, a low-latency, strongly consistent and highly available disaggregated key-value store. We evaluate SWARM-KV and find that it has marginal latency overhead compared to an unreplicated key-value store, and that it offers much lower latency and better availability than FUSEE, a state-of-the-art replicated disaggregated key-value store.

### Wind lulls and slews; consequences for the stability of future UK   electricity systems
**Authors**: Anthony D Stephens, David R Walwyn

**Updated**: 2024-09-24T14:16:26Z

**Summary**: As the United Kingdom wind fleet increases in size, wind lulls and slews will increasingly challenge the stability of its electricity system. The paper describes the use of models based on real time records and including solar slews, to investigate the most extreme wind variations likely to be encountered in future, enabling strategies to be devised to mitigate them. Wind lulls are surprisingly frequent, occasionally lasting a week or more, and are always likely to be beyond the capabilities of stored or imported electrical energy to mitigate them. The models indicate that there will be a continuing need for gas powered generation to mitigate wind lulls. Currently, Combined Cycle Gas Turbines (CCGTs) provide most of the dispatchable generation. However, CCGTs are not sufficiently fast acting to cope with the wind and solar slews anticipated in future. The paper suggests that a range of already proven fast-acting sources of dispatchable generation, including Open Cycle Gas Turbines (OCGTs), Internal Combustion Gas-Fired Reciprocating engines (ICGRs) and stored electrical energy systems, should be capable of coping with the largest wind and solar slews likely to be encountered up to the year 2035. Examples are given of the recent introduction of these fast-acting sources of generation which, it is suggested, will progressively replace CCGTs as the wind and solar fleets increase in size. Moreover, we see the pattern of recent investments, summarised in the paper, as a good indication of likely future investments, with OCGT investments mainly serving the 440 kV grid, and ICGRs and stored electrical energy more local networks.

### The Bicameral Cache: a split cache for vector architectures
**Authors**: Susana Rebolledo, Borja Perez, Jose Luis Bosque, Peter Hsu

**Updated**: 2024-09-24T11:37:43Z

**Summary**: The Bicameral Cache is a cache organization proposal for a vector architecture that segregates data according to their access type, distinguishing scalar from vector references. Its aim is to avoid both types of references from interfering in each other's data locality, with a special focus on prioritizing the performance on vector references. The proposed system incorporates an additional, non-polluting prefetching mechanism to help populate the long vector cache lines in advance to increase the hit rate by further exploiting the spatial locality on vector data. Its evaluation was conducted on the Cavatools simulator, comparing the performance to a standard conventional cache, over different typical vector benchmarks for several vector lengths. The results proved the proposed cache speeds up performance on stride-1 vector benchmarks, while hardly impacting non-stride-1's. In addition, the prefetching feature consistently provided an additional value.

### SEAL: Suite for Evaluating API-use of LLMs
**Authors**: Woojeong Kim, Ashish Jagmohan, Aditya Vempaty

**Updated**: 2024-09-23T20:16:49Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have limitations in handling tasks that require real-time access to external APIs. While several benchmarks like ToolBench and APIGen have been developed to assess LLMs' API-use capabilities, they often suffer from issues such as lack of generalizability, limited multi-step reasoning coverage, and instability due to real-time API fluctuations. In this paper, we introduce SEAL, an end-to-end testbed designed to evaluate LLMs in real-world API usage. SEAL standardizes existing benchmarks, integrates an agent system for testing API retrieval and planning, and addresses the instability of real-time APIs by introducing a GPT-4-powered API simulator with caching for deterministic evaluations. Our testbed provides a comprehensive evaluation pipeline that covers API retrieval, API calls, and final responses, offering a reliable framework for structured performance comparison in diverse real-world scenarios. SEAL is publicly available, with ongoing updates for new benchmarks.

### BlockLLM: Multi-tenant Finer-grained Serving for Large Language Models
**Authors**: Bodun Hu, Jiamin Li, Le Xu, Myungjin Lee, Akshay Jajoo, Geon-Woo Kim, Hong Xu, Aditya Akella

**Updated**: 2024-09-23T20:09:28Z

**Summary**: The increasing demand for Large Language Models (LLMs) across various applications has led to a significant shift in the design of deep learning serving systems. Deploying LLMs, particularly in multi-tenant environments, poses substantial challenges due to their high computational and memory demands. We introduce BlockLLM, a serving system that leverages component sharing among fine-tuned LLM models to provide an efficient and flexible solution for LLM workloads. BlockLLM partitions models into finer-grained blocks, enabling the reuse of model components and independent provisioning to improve computation efficiency. BlockLLM comprises an offline block zoo for storing blocks and an online system to serve requests through chains of blocks. It offers multi-fold flexibilities: (1) Adaptive assembly of blocks on-the-fly through equivalence evaluation among blocks in the zoo; (2) Per-block batch size configuration and best-effort KV cache coordination at the individual block level; (3) Speculative execution and locality-aware block placement to reduce communication costs from dynamic block resource allocation. Our evaluation shows that BlockLLM reduces memory and storage footprints and improves computational efficiency, outperforming existing serving approach in 95%ile latency and GPU utilization by 33.5% and 20.1%, respectively, with minimal impact on accuracy

### RepoGenReflex: Enhancing Repository-Level Code Completion with Verbal   Reinforcement and Retrieval-Augmented Generation
**Authors**: Jicheng Wang, Yifeng He, Hao Chen

**Updated**: 2024-09-23T19:53:37Z

**Summary**: In real-world software engineering tasks, solving a problem often requires understanding and modifying multiple functions, classes, and files across a large codebase. Therefore, on the repository level, it is crucial to extract the relevant information to achieve accurate code completion effectively. Existing code completion tools have achieved some success, but they struggle to optimize the retrieval and generation process dynamically. In this paper, we propose RepoGenReflex, a generic, dynamic, effective framework to address this challenge. By leveraging the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhanced with Verbal Reinforcement Learning (VRL), it can dynamically choose the optimal results for repository-level code completion. RepoGenReflex uses Reflector to give directional feedback to the next loop. RepoGenReflex chooses the optimal results stored in the Experience cache based on the RAG-VRL loop. To validate the framework's generalization ability, we propose a new benchmark RepoGenEval, which consists of the latest, high-quality real-world repositories in line completion scenarios. Our experiments demonstrate that RepoGenReflex achieves significant improvements after optimizing the Reflector component, resulting in enhanced accuracy and relevance of code completions. Additionally, RepoGenReflex consistently demonstrates superior performance and effectiveness across standard code completion tasks, highlighting the robustness and adaptability of our framework.

### Steward: Natural Language Web Automation
**Authors**: Brian Tang, Kang G. Shin

**Updated**: 2024-09-23T18:06:32Z

**Summary**: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in serving as the foundation for AI assistants. One emerging application of LLMs, navigating through websites and interacting with UI elements across various web pages, remains somewhat underexplored. We introduce Steward, a novel LLM-powered web automation tool designed to serve as a cost-effective, scalable, end-to-end solution for automating web interactions. Traditional browser automation frameworks like Selenium, Puppeteer, and Playwright are not scalable for extensive web interaction tasks, such as studying recommendation algorithms on platforms like YouTube and Twitter. These frameworks require manual coding of interactions, limiting their utility in large-scale or dynamic contexts. Steward addresses these limitations by integrating LLM capabilities with browser automation, allowing for natural language-driven interaction with websites. Steward operates by receiving natural language instructions and reactively planning and executing a sequence of actions on websites, looping until completion, making it a practical tool for developers and researchers to use. It achieves high efficiency, completing actions in 8.52 to 10.14 seconds at a cost of $0.028 per action or an average of $0.18 per task, which is further reduced to 4.8 seconds and $0.022 through a caching mechanism. It runs tasks on real websites with a 40% completion success rate. We discuss various design and implementation challenges, including state representation, action sequence selection, system responsiveness, detecting task completion, and caching implementation.

### CSPS: A Communication-Efficient Sequence-Parallelism based Serving   System for Transformer based Models with Long Prompts
**Authors**: Zeyu Zhang, Haiying Shen

**Updated**: 2024-09-23T15:16:29Z

**Summary**: Long-sequence generative large-language model (LLM) applications have become increasingly popular. In this paper, through trace-based experiments, we found that the existing method for long sequences results in a high Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) due to sequential chunk processing, long Time-Between-Tokens (TBT) from batching long-sequence prefills and decodes, and low throughput due to constrained key-value cache (KVC) for long sequences. To address these issues, we propose two Sequence-Parallelism (SP) architectures for both tensor parallelism (TP) and non-TP. However, SP introduces two challenges: 1) network communication and computation become performance bottlenecks; 2) the latter two issues above are mitigated but not resolved, and SP's resultant KV value distribution across GPUs still requires communication for decode, increasing TBT. Hence, we propose a Communication-efficient Sparse Attention (CSA) and communication-computation-communication three-phase pipelining. We also propose SP-based decode that processes decode separately from prefill, distributes KV values of a request across different GPUs, and novelly moves Query (Q) values instead of KV values to reduce communication overhead. These methods constitute a communication-efficient Sequence-Parallelism based LLM Serving System (SPS2). Our trace-driven evaluation demonstrates that SPS2 improves the average TTFT, TBT, and response time by up to 7.5x, 1.92x, and 9.8x and improves the prefill and decode throughput by 8.2x and 5.2x while maintaining the accuracy compared to Sarathi-Serve. We distributed our source code.

### Inference-Friendly Models With MixAttention
**Authors**: Shashank Rajput, Ying Sheng, Sean Owen, Vitaliy Chiley

**Updated**: 2024-09-23T13:37:25Z

**Summary**: The size of the key-value (KV) cache plays a critical role in determining both the maximum context length and the number of concurrent requests supported during inference in modern language models. The KV cache size grows proportionally with the number of attention heads and the tokens processed, leading to increased memory consumption and slower inference for long inputs. In this work, we explore the use of MixAttention, a model architecture modification closely related to a blog published by Character.AI. MixAttention combines sliding window attention, where only a small subset of recent tokens is stored in the KV cache, with KV cache sharing across layers. Our experiments demonstrate that MixAttention significantly reduces memory usage and improves inference speed without sacrificing model performance in both short and long-context tasks. We also explore various configurations of this architecture, identifying those that maintain quality across evaluation metrics while optimizing resource efficiency.

### Mutation-Based Deep Learning Framework Testing Method in JavaScript   Environment
**Authors**: Yinglong Zou, Juan Zhai, Chunrong Fang, Jiawei Liu, Tao Zheng, Zhenyu Chen

**Updated**: 2024-09-23T12:37:56Z

**Summary**: In recent years, Deep Learning (DL) applications in JavaScript environment have become increasingly popular. As the infrastructure for DL applications, JavaScript DL frameworks play a crucial role in the development and deployment. It is essential to ensure the quality of JavaScript DL frameworks. However, the bottleneck of limited computational resources in the JavaScript environment brings new challenges to framework testing. Specifically, JavaScript DL frameworks are equipped with various optimization mechanisms (e.g., cache reuse, inference acceleration) to overcome the bottleneck of limited computational resources. These optimization mechanisms are overlooked by existing methods, resulting in many bugs in JavaScript DL frameworks being missed. To address the above challenges, we propose a mutation-based JavaScript DL framework testing method named DLJSFuzzer. DLJSFuzzer designs 13 tensor mutation rules targeting the cache reuse mechanism to generate test input tensors. Besides, DLJSFuzzer designs eight model mutation rules targeting the inference acceleration mechanism to generate test input models. To evaluate the effectiveness of DLJSFuzzer, we conduct experiments on the most widely-used JavaScript DL framework, TensorFlow.js. The experimental results show that DLJSFuzzer outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both effectiveness and efficiency. DLJSFuzzer successfully detects 21 unique crashes and 126 unique NaN & Inconsistency bugs. All detected crashes have been reported to the open-source community, with 12 of them already confirmed by developers. Additionally, DLJSFuzzer has improved by over 47% in model generation efficiency and over 91% in bug detection efficiency compared to all baselines.

### A-VL: Adaptive Attention for Large Vision-Language Models
**Authors**: Junyang Zhang, Mu Yuan, Ruiguang Zhong, Puhan Luo, Huiyou Zhan, Ningkang Zhang, Chengchen Hu, Xiangyang Li

**Updated**: 2024-09-23T09:22:59Z

**Summary**: The Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM) integrates computer vision and natural language processing techniques, offering substantial application potential. However, these models demand extensive resources during inference. Adaptive attention techniques can dynamically reduce computational redundancy and thus improve efficiency. Although current adaptive attention methods significantly reduce the memory requirements of Transformer-based language models, they are not tailored for LVLMs. We observe that LVLMs generate responses from both remote image tokens and local text tokens, and different modalities have different attention patterns. This observation inspires us to manage the attention for each modality separately. Specifically, for visual input, we store the cache of potentially useful information but only compute the most critical parts. For language input, we care more about local information. Based on our observation and analysis of vision-language attention patterns, we develop A-VL, a plug-and-play adaptive attention tailored for LVLM inference. Extensive evaluations on three vision-language tasks and five datasets show the effectiveness of our designs. Our approach A-VL outperforms existing adaptive attention methods in reducing memory usage and computational load without compromising performance.

### CritiPrefill: A Segment-wise Criticality-based Approach for Prefilling   Acceleration in LLMs
**Authors**: Junlin Lv, Yuan Feng, Xike Xie, Xin Jia, Qirong Peng, Guiming Xie

**Updated**: 2024-09-23T02:24:33Z

**Summary**: Large language models have achieved notable success across various domains, yet efficient inference is still limited by the quadratic computation complexity of the attention mechanism. The inference consists of prefilling and decoding phases. Although several attempts have been made to accelerate decoding, the inefficiency of the prefilling phase, especially for long-context tasks, remains a challenge. In this paper, we observe a locality in query criticality during the prefilling phase of long-context processing: adjacent query tokens tend to focus on similar subsets of the past Key-Value (KV) cache. Based on this observation, we propose CritiPrefill, a criticality-based segment-wise prefilling method. This method partitions the input sequence's queries and KV cache into segments and blocks, utilizing a segment-wise algorithm to estimate the query criticality. By pruning non-critical computations between query segments and cache blocks in the self-attention mechanism, the prefilling process can be significantly accelerated. Extensive evaluations on multiple long-context datasets show up to 2.7x speedup on Llama3-8B and 3.0x speedup on Yi-9B for 128K context length on a single A100 GPU, with minimal quality degradation.

### D2D Coded Caching from Two Classes of Optimal DPDAs using Cross   Resolvable Designs
**Authors**: Rashid Ummer N. T., B. Sundar Rajan

**Updated**: 2024-09-22T07:24:02Z

**Summary**: Coded caching in a wireless device-to-device (D2D) network was first studied by Ji \textit{et al.} in [4] (referred to as the JCM scheme). In a D2D network, a central server first places the data in the user cache memories and all the user's demands are served by inter-user coded multicast transmissions. Low subpacketization level D2D coded caching schemes are desirable for practical implementations. Wang \textit{et al.} in [7] proposed an array called D2D placement delivery array (DPDA) which characterizes the placement phase and the delivery phase in a D2D network. A lower bound on the transmission load of a DPDA is derived and only the JCM scheme achieves this lower bound, but requires a subpacketization level that grows exponentially with the number of users. Low subpacketization level D2D schemes can be obtained by constructing appropriate DPDAs. In this paper, we propose two new classes of DPDA constructions that give low subpacketization level D2D schemes using cross resolvable designs. The first class of constructed DPDA achieves the known lower bound on the transmission load of DPDA while requiring a subpacketization level lesser than that of the JCM scheme. We propose another lower bound on the transmission load of a DPDA and show that the second class of constructed DPDA achieves this lower bound.

### Sub-millisecond electric field sensing with an individual rare-earth   doped ferroelectric nanocrystal
**Authors**: Athulya Muraleedharan, Jingye Zou, Maxime Vallet, Abdelali Zaki, Christine Bogicevic, Charles Paillard, Karen Perronet, Fran√ßois Treussart

**Updated**: 2024-09-21T20:45:41Z

**Summary**: Understanding the dynamics of electrical signals within neuronal assemblies is crucial to unraveling complex brain function. Despite recent advances in employing optically active nanostructures in transmembrane potential sensing, there remains room for improvement in terms of response time and sensitivity. Here, we report the development of such a nanosensor capable of detecting electric fields with a submillisecond response time at the single particle level. We achieve this by using ferroelectric nanocrystals doped with rare earth ions producing upconversion (UC). When such a nanocrystal experiences a variation of surrounding electric potential, its surface charge density changes, inducing electric polarization modifications that vary, via converse piezoelectric effect, the crystal field around the ions. The latter variation is finally converted into UC spectral changes, enabling optical detection of electric potential. To develop such a sensor, we synthesized erbium and ytterbium-doped barium titanate crystals of size $\approx160$~nm. We observed distinct changes in the UC spectrum when individual nanocrystals were subjected to an external field via a conductive AFM tip, with a response time of 100~$\mu$s. Furthermore, our sensor exhibits a remarkable sensitivity of 4.8~kV/cm/$\sqrt{\rm Hz}$, enabling time-resolved detection of fast changing electric field of amplitude comparable to that generated during a neuron action potential.

### CSKV: Training-Efficient Channel Shrinking for KV Cache in Long-Context   Scenarios
**Authors**: Luning Wang, Shiyao Li, Xuefei Ning, Zhihang Yuan, Shengen Yan, Guohao Dai, Yu Wang

**Updated**: 2024-09-21T13:01:43Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely adopted to process long-context tasks. However, the large memory overhead of the key-value (KV) cache poses significant challenges in long-context scenarios. Existing training-free KV cache compression methods typically focus on quantization and token pruning, which have compression limits, and excessive sparsity can lead to severe performance degradation. Other methods design new architectures with less KV overhead but require significant training overhead. To address the above two drawbacks, we further explore the redundancy in the channel dimension and apply an architecture-level design with minor training costs. Therefore, we introduce CSKV, a training-efficient Channel Shrinking technique for KV cache compression: (1) We first analyze the singular value distribution of the KV cache, revealing significant redundancy and compression potential along the channel dimension. Based on this observation, we propose using low-rank decomposition for key and value layers and storing the low-dimension features. (2) To preserve model performance, we introduce a bi-branch KV cache, including a window-based full-precision KV cache and a low-precision compressed KV cache. (3) To reduce the training costs, we minimize the layer-wise reconstruction loss for the compressed KV cache instead of retraining the entire LLMs. Extensive experiments show that CSKV can reduce the memory overhead of the KV cache by 80% while maintaining the model's long-context capability. Moreover, we show that our method can be seamlessly combined with quantization to further reduce the memory overhead, achieving a compression ratio of up to 95%.

### A Simple and Effective $L_2$ Norm-Based Strategy for KV Cache   Compression
**Authors**: Alessio Devoto, Yu Zhao, Simone Scardapane, Pasquale Minervini

**Updated**: 2024-09-21T12:33:00Z

**Summary**: The deployment of large language models (LLMs) is often hindered by the extensive memory requirements of the Key-Value (KV) cache, especially as context lengths increase. Existing approaches to reduce the KV cache size involve either fine-tuning the model to learn a compression strategy or leveraging attention scores to reduce the sequence length. We analyse the attention distributions in decoder-only Transformers-based models and observe that attention allocation patterns stay consistent across most layers. Surprisingly, we find a clear correlation between the $L_2$ and the attention scores over cached KV pairs, where a low $L_2$ of a key embedding usually leads to a high attention score during decoding. This finding indicates that the influence of a KV pair is potentially determined by the key embedding itself before being queried. Based on this observation, we compress the KV cache based on the $L_2$ of key embeddings. Our experimental results show that this simple strategy can reduce the KV cache size by 50% on language modelling and needle-in-a-haystack tasks and 90% on passkey retrieval tasks without losing accuracy. Moreover, without relying on the attention scores, this approach remains compatible with FlashAttention, enabling broader applicability.

**Authors**: Simranjit Singh, Michael Fore, Andreas Karatzas, Chaehong Lee, Yanan Jian, Longfei Shangguan, Fuxun Yu, Iraklis Anagnostopoulos, Dimitrios Stamoulis

**Updated**: 2024-09-21T09:10:02Z

**Summary**: As Large Language Models (LLMs) broaden their capabilities to manage thousands of API calls, they are confronted with complex data operations across vast datasets with significant overhead to the underlying system. In this work, we introduce LLM-dCache to optimize data accesses by treating cache operations as callable API functions exposed to the tool-augmented agent. We grant LLMs the autonomy to manage cache decisions via prompting, seamlessly integrating with existing function-calling mechanisms. Tested on an industry-scale massively parallel platform that spans hundreds of GPT endpoints and terabytes of imagery, our method improves Copilot times by an average of 1.24x across various LLMs and prompting techniques.

**Authors**: Tommaso Bonato, Abdul Kabbani, Ahmad Ghalayini, Mohammad Dohadwala, Michael Papamichael, Daniele De Sensi, Torsten Hoefler

**Updated**: 2024-09-20T16:59:29Z

**Summary**: Most datacenter transport protocols traditionally depend on in-order packet delivery, a legacy design choice that prioritizes simplicity. However, technological advancements, such as RDMA, now enable the relaxation of this requirement, allowing for more efficient utilization of modern datacenter topologies like FatTree and Dragonfly. With the growing prevalence of AI/ML workloads, the demand for improved link utilization has intensified, creating challenges for single-path load balancers due to problems like ECMP collisions. In this paper, we present ARCANE, a novel, adaptive per-packet traffic load-balancing algorithm designed to work seamlessly with existing congestion control mechanisms. ARCANE dynamically routes packets to bypass congested areas and network failures, all while maintaining a lightweight footprint with minimal state requirements. Our evaluation shows that ARCANE delivers significant performance gains over traditional load-balancing methods, including packet spraying and other advanced solutions, substantially enhancing both performance and link utilization in modern datacenter networks.

**Authors**: Ayush RoyChowdhury, Mulong Luo, Prateek Sahu, Sarbartha Banerjee, Mohit Tiwari

**Updated**: 2024-09-20T15:51:17Z

**Summary**: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is a process where a large language model (LLM) retrieves useful information from a database and then generates the responses. It is becoming popular in enterprise settings for daily business operations. For example, Copilot for Microsoft 365 has accumulated millions of businesses. However, the security implications of adopting such RAG-based systems are unclear.   In this paper, we introduce ConfusedPilot, a class of security vulnerabilities of RAG systems that confuse Copilot and cause integrity and confidentiality violations in its responses. First, we investigate a vulnerability that embeds malicious text in the modified prompt in RAG, corrupting the responses generated by the LLM. Second, we demonstrate a vulnerability that leaks secret data, which leverages the caching mechanism during retrieval. Third, we investigate how both vulnerabilities can be exploited to propagate misinformation within the enterprise and ultimately impact its operations, such as sales and manufacturing. We also discuss the root cause of these attacks by investigating the architecture of a RAG-based system. This study highlights the security vulnerabilities in today's RAG-based systems and proposes design guidelines to secure future RAG-based systems.

### RPAF: A Reinforcement Prediction-Allocation Framework for Cache   Allocation in Large-Scale Recommender Systems
**Authors**: Shuo Su, Xiaoshuang Chen, Yao Wang, Yulin Wu, Ziqiang Zhang, Kaiqiao Zhan, Ben Wang, Kun Gai

**Updated**: 2024-09-20T03:02:42Z

**Summary**: Modern recommender systems are built upon computation-intensive infrastructure, and it is challenging to perform real-time computation for each request, especially in peak periods, due to the limited computational resources. Recommending by user-wise result caches is widely used when the system cannot afford a real-time recommendation. However, it is challenging to allocate real-time and cached recommendations to maximize the users' overall engagement. This paper shows two key challenges to cache allocation, i.e., the value-strategy dependency and the streaming allocation. Then, we propose a reinforcement prediction-allocation framework (RPAF) to address these issues. RPAF is a reinforcement-learning-based two-stage framework containing prediction and allocation stages. The prediction stage estimates the values of the cache choices considering the value-strategy dependency, and the allocation stage determines the cache choices for each individual request while satisfying the global budget constraint. We show that the challenge of training RPAF includes globality and the strictness of budget constraints, and a relaxed local allocator (RLA) is proposed to address this issue. Moreover, a PoolRank algorithm is used in the allocation stage to deal with the streaming allocation problem. Experiments show that RPAF significantly improves users' engagement under computational budget constraints.

### 3DGS-LM: Faster Gaussian-Splatting Optimization with Levenberg-Marquardt
**Authors**: Lukas H√∂llein, Alja≈æ Bo≈æiƒç, Michael Zollh√∂fer, Matthias Nie√üner

**Updated**: 2024-09-19T16:31:44Z

**Summary**: We present 3DGS-LM, a new method that accelerates the reconstruction of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) by replacing its ADAM optimizer with a tailored Levenberg-Marquardt (LM). Existing methods reduce the optimization time by decreasing the number of Gaussians or by improving the implementation of the differentiable rasterizer. However, they still rely on the ADAM optimizer to fit Gaussian parameters of a scene in thousands of iterations, which can take up to an hour. To this end, we change the optimizer to LM that runs in conjunction with the 3DGS differentiable rasterizer. For efficient GPU parallization, we propose a caching data structure for intermediate gradients that allows us to efficiently calculate Jacobian-vector products in custom CUDA kernels. In every LM iteration, we calculate update directions from multiple image subsets using these kernels and combine them in a weighted mean. Overall, our method is 30% faster than the original 3DGS while obtaining the same reconstruction quality. Our optimization is also agnostic to other methods that acclerate 3DGS, thus enabling even faster speedups compared to vanilla 3DGS.

## Keyword: LLM Inference 
 ### Towards Trustworthy LLMs for Code: A Data-Centric Synergistic Auditing   Framework
**Authors**: Chong Wang, Zhenpeng Chen, Tianlin Li, Yilun Zhao, Yang Liu

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T17:59:58Z

**Summary**: LLM-powered coding and development assistants have become prevalent to programmers' workflows. However, concerns about the trustworthiness of LLMs for code persist despite their widespread use. Much of the existing research focused on either training or evaluation, raising questions about whether stakeholders in training and evaluation align in their understanding of model trustworthiness and whether they can move toward a unified direction. In this paper, we propose a vision for a unified trustworthiness auditing framework, DataTrust, which adopts a data-centric approach that synergistically emphasizes both training and evaluation data and their correlations. DataTrust aims to connect model trustworthiness indicators in evaluation with data quality indicators in training. It autonomously inspects training data and evaluates model trustworthiness using synthesized data, attributing potential causes from specific evaluation data to corresponding training data and refining indicator connections. Additionally, a trustworthiness arena powered by DataTrust will engage crowdsourced input and deliver quantitative outcomes. We outline the benefits that various stakeholders can gain from DataTrust and discuss the challenges and opportunities it presents.

### Generative Verifiers: Reward Modeling as Next-Token Prediction
**Authors**: Lunjun Zhang, Arian Hosseini, Hritik Bansal, Mehran Kazemi, Aviral Kumar, Rishabh Agarwal

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T17:59:32Z

**Summary**: Verifiers or reward models are often used to enhance the reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs). A common approach is the Best-of-N method, where N candidate solutions generated by the LLM are ranked by a verifier, and the best one is selected. While LLM-based verifiers are typically trained as discriminative classifiers to score solutions, they do not utilize the text generation capabilities of pretrained LLMs. To overcome this limitation, we instead propose training verifiers using the ubiquitous next-token prediction objective, jointly on verification and solution generation. Compared to standard verifiers, such generative verifiers (GenRM) can benefit from several advantages of LLMs: they integrate seamlessly with instruction tuning, enable chain-of-thought reasoning, and can utilize additional test-time compute via majority voting for better verification. We demonstrate that GenRM outperforms discriminative, DPO verifiers, and LLM-as-a-Judge, resulting in a 16-40% improvement in the number of problems solved with Best-of-N on algorithmic and math reasoning tasks. Furthermore, we find that training GenRM with synthetic verification rationales is sufficient to pick out subtle errors on math problems. Finally, we demonstrate that generative verifiers scale favorably with model size and inference-time compute.

### Unraveling and Mitigating Safety Alignment Degradation of   Vision-Language Models
**Authors**: Qin Liu, Chao Shang, Ling Liu, Nikolaos Pappas, Jie Ma, Neha Anna John, Srikanth Doss, Lluis Marquez, Miguel Ballesteros, Yassine Benajiba

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T17:59:31Z

**Summary**: The safety alignment ability of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) is prone to be degraded by the integration of the vision module compared to its LLM backbone. We investigate this phenomenon, dubbed as ''safety alignment degradation'' in this paper, and show that the challenge arises from the representation gap that emerges when introducing vision modality to VLMs. In particular, we show that the representations of multi-modal inputs shift away from that of text-only inputs which represent the distribution that the LLM backbone is optimized for. At the same time, the safety alignment capabilities, initially developed within the textual embedding space, do not successfully transfer to this new multi-modal representation space. To reduce safety alignment degradation, we introduce Cross-Modality Representation Manipulation (CMRM), an inference time representation intervention method for recovering the safety alignment ability that is inherent in the LLM backbone of VLMs, while simultaneously preserving the functional capabilities of VLMs. The empirical results show that our framework significantly recovers the alignment ability that is inherited from the LLM backbone with minimal impact on the fluency and linguistic capabilities of pre-trained VLMs even without additional training. Specifically, the unsafe rate of LLaVA-7B on multi-modal input can be reduced from 61.53% to as low as 3.15% with only inference-time intervention.   WARNING: This paper contains examples of toxic or harmful language.

### MiRAGeNews: Multimodal Realistic AI-Generated News Detection
**Authors**: Runsheng Huang, Liam Dugan, Yue Yang, Chris Callison-Burch

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T17:58:02Z

**Summary**: The proliferation of inflammatory or misleading "fake" news content has become increasingly common in recent years. Simultaneously, it has become easier than ever to use AI tools to generate photorealistic images depicting any scene imaginable. Combining these two -- AI-generated fake news content -- is particularly potent and dangerous. To combat the spread of AI-generated fake news, we propose the MiRAGeNews Dataset, a dataset of 12,500 high-quality real and AI-generated image-caption pairs from state-of-the-art generators. We find that our dataset poses a significant challenge to humans (60% F-1) and state-of-the-art multi-modal LLMs (< 24% F-1). Using our dataset we train a multi-modal detector (MiRAGe) that improves by +5.1% F-1 over state-of-the-art baselines on image-caption pairs from out-of-domain image generators and news publishers. We release our code and data to aid future work on detecting AI-generated content.

### Transforming In-Vehicle Network Intrusion Detection: VAE-based Knowledge   Distillation Meets Explainable AI
**Authors**: Muhammet Anil Yagiz, Pedram MohajerAnsari, Mert D. Pese, Polat Goktas

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T17:57:16Z

**Summary**: In the evolving landscape of autonomous vehicles, ensuring robust in-vehicle network (IVN) security is paramount. This paper introduces an advanced intrusion detection system (IDS) called KD-XVAE that uses a Variational Autoencoder (VAE)-based knowledge distillation approach to enhance both performance and efficiency. Our model significantly reduces complexity, operating with just 1669 parameters and achieving an inference time of 0.3 ms per batch, making it highly suitable for resource-constrained automotive environments. Evaluations in the HCRL Car-Hacking dataset demonstrate exceptional capabilities, attaining perfect scores (Recall, Precision, F1 Score of 100%, and FNR of 0%) under multiple attack types, including DoS, Fuzzing, Gear Spoofing, and RPM Spoofing. Comparative analysis on the CICIoV2024 dataset further underscores its superiority over traditional machine learning models, achieving perfect detection metrics. We furthermore integrate Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to ensure transparency in the model's decisions. The VAE compresses the original feature space into a latent space, on which the distilled model is trained. SHAP(SHapley Additive exPlanations) values provide insights into the importance of each latent dimension, mapped back to original features for intuitive understanding. Our paper advances the field by integrating state-of-the-art techniques, addressing critical challenges in the deployment of efficient, trustworthy, and reliable IDSes for autonomous vehicles, ensuring enhanced protection against emerging cyber threats.

### Inferring birth versus death dynamics for ecological interactions in   stochastic heterogeneous populations
**Authors**: Erin Beckman, Heyrim Cho, Linh Huynh

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T17:55:48Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we study the significance of ecological interactions and separation of birth and death dynamics in heterogeneous stochastic populations. Interactions can manifest through the birth dynamics, the death dynamics, or some combination of the two. The underlying mechanisms are important but often implicit in data. We propose an inference method for disambiguating the types of interaction and the birth and death processes from time series data of a stochastic n-type heterogeneous population. The interspecies interactions considered can be competitive, antagonistic, or mutualistic. The inference method is then validated in the example of two-type Lotka-Volterra dynamics. Utilizing stochastic fluctuations enables us to estimate additional parameters in a stochastic Lotka-Volterra model, which are not identifiable in a deterministic model. We also show that different pairs of birth and death rates with the same net growth rate manifest different time series statistics and survival probabilities.

### AttnGCG: Enhancing Jailbreaking Attacks on LLMs with Attention   Manipulation
**Authors**: Zijun Wang, Haoqin Tu, Jieru Mei, Bingchen Zhao, Yisen Wang, Cihang Xie

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T17:55:09Z

**Summary**: This paper studies the vulnerabilities of transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) to jailbreaking attacks, focusing specifically on the optimization-based Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) strategy. We first observe a positive correlation between the effectiveness of attacks and the internal behaviors of the models. For instance, attacks tend to be less effective when models pay more attention to system prompts designed to ensure LLM safety alignment. Building on this discovery, we introduce an enhanced method that manipulates models' attention scores to facilitate LLM jailbreaking, which we term AttnGCG. Empirically, AttnGCG shows consistent improvements in attack efficacy across diverse LLMs, achieving an average increase of ~7% in the Llama-2 series and ~10% in the Gemma series. Our strategy also demonstrates robust attack transferability against both unseen harmful goals and black-box LLMs like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. Moreover, we note our attention-score visualization is more interpretable, allowing us to gain better insights into how our targeted attention manipulation facilitates more effective jailbreaking. We release the code at https://github.com/UCSC-VLAA/AttnGCG-attack.

### SimpleStrat: Diversifying Language Model Generation with Stratification
**Authors**: Justin Wong, Yury Orlovskiy, Michael Luo, Sanjit A. Seshia, Joseph E. Gonzalez

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T17:54:14Z

**Summary**: Generating diverse responses from large language models (LLMs) is crucial for applications such as planning/search and synthetic data generation, where diversity provides distinct answers across generations. Prior approaches rely on increasing temperature to increase diversity. However, contrary to popular belief, we show not only does this approach produce lower quality individual generations as temperature increases, but it depends on model's next-token probabilities being similar to the true distribution of answers. We propose \method{}, an alternative approach that uses the language model itself to partition the space into strata. At inference, a random stratum is selected and a sample drawn from within the strata. To measure diversity, we introduce CoverageQA, a dataset of underspecified questions with multiple equally plausible answers, and assess diversity by measuring KL Divergence between the output distribution and uniform distribution over valid ground truth answers. As computing probability per response/solution for proprietary models is infeasible, we measure recall on ground truth solutions. Our evaluation show using SimpleStrat achieves higher recall by 0.05 compared to GPT-4o and 0.36 average reduction in KL Divergence compared to Llama 3.

### Mentor-KD: Making Small Language Models Better Multi-step Reasoners
**Authors**: Hojae Lee, Junho Kim, SangKeun Lee

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T17:53:27Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have displayed remarkable performances across various complex tasks by leveraging Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. Recently, studies have proposed a Knowledge Distillation (KD) approach, reasoning distillation, which transfers such reasoning ability of LLMs through fine-tuning language models of multi-step rationales generated by LLM teachers. However, they have inadequately considered two challenges regarding insufficient distillation sets from the LLM teacher model, in terms of 1) data quality and 2) soft label provision. In this paper, we propose Mentor-KD, which effectively distills the multi-step reasoning capability of LLMs to smaller LMs while addressing the aforementioned challenges. Specifically, we exploit a mentor, intermediate-sized task-specific fine-tuned model, to augment additional CoT annotations and provide soft labels for the student model during reasoning distillation. We conduct extensive experiments and confirm Mentor-KD's effectiveness across various models and complex reasoning tasks.

### PEAR: A Robust and Flexible Automation Framework for Ptychography   Enabled by Multiple Large Language Model Agents
**Authors**: Xiangyu Yin, Chuqiao Shi, Yimo Han, Yi Jiang

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T17:50:59Z

**Summary**: Ptychography is an advanced computational imaging technique in X-ray and electron microscopy. It has been widely adopted across scientific research fields, including physics, chemistry, biology, and materials science, as well as in industrial applications such as semiconductor characterization. In practice, obtaining high-quality ptychographic images requires simultaneous optimization of numerous experimental and algorithmic parameters. Traditionally, parameter selection often relies on trial and error, leading to low-throughput workflows and potential human bias. In this work, we develop the "Ptychographic Experiment and Analysis Robot" (PEAR), a framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to automate data analysis in ptychography. To ensure high robustness and accuracy, PEAR employs multiple LLM agents for tasks including knowledge retrieval, code generation, parameter recommendation, and image reasoning. Our study demonstrates that PEAR's multi-agent design significantly improves the workflow success rate, even with smaller open-weight models such as LLaMA 3.1 8B. PEAR also supports various automation levels and is designed to work with customized local knowledge bases, ensuring flexibility and adaptability across different research environments.

### DeLLMa: Decision Making Under Uncertainty with Large Language Models
**Authors**: Ollie Liu, Deqing Fu, Dani Yogatama, Willie Neiswanger

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T17:43:48Z

**Summary**: The potential of large language models (LLMs) as decision support tools is increasingly being explored in fields such as business, engineering, and medicine, which often face challenging tasks of decision-making under uncertainty. In this paper, we show that directly prompting LLMs on these types of decision-making problems can yield poor results, especially as the problem complexity increases. To aid in these tasks, we propose DeLLMa (Decision-making Large Language Model assistant), a framework designed to enhance decision-making accuracy in uncertain environments. DeLLMa involves a multi-step reasoning procedure that integrates recent best practices in scaling inference-time reasoning, drawing upon principles from decision theory and utility theory, to provide an accurate and human-auditable decision-making process. We validate our procedure on multiple realistic decision-making environments, demonstrating that DeLLMa can consistently enhance the decision-making performance of leading language models, and achieve up to a 40% increase in accuracy over competing methods. Additionally, we show how performance improves when scaling compute at test time, and carry out human evaluations to benchmark components of DeLLMa.

### AgentHarm: A Benchmark for Measuring Harmfulness of LLM Agents
**Authors**: Maksym Andriushchenko, Alexandra Souly, Mateusz Dziemian, Derek Duenas, Maxwell Lin, Justin Wang, Dan Hendrycks, Andy Zou, Zico Kolter, Matt Fredrikson, Eric Winsor, Jerome Wynne, Yarin Gal, Xander Davies

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T17:39:22Z

**Summary**: The robustness of LLMs to jailbreak attacks, where users design prompts to circumvent safety measures and misuse model capabilities, has been studied primarily for LLMs acting as simple chatbots. Meanwhile, LLM agents -- which use external tools and can execute multi-stage tasks -- may pose a greater risk if misused, but their robustness remains underexplored. To facilitate research on LLM agent misuse, we propose a new benchmark called AgentHarm. The benchmark includes a diverse set of 110 explicitly malicious agent tasks (440 with augmentations), covering 11 harm categories including fraud, cybercrime, and harassment. In addition to measuring whether models refuse harmful agentic requests, scoring well on AgentHarm requires jailbroken agents to maintain their capabilities following an attack to complete a multi-step task. We evaluate a range of leading LLMs, and find (1) leading LLMs are surprisingly compliant with malicious agent requests without jailbreaking, (2) simple universal jailbreak templates can be adapted to effectively jailbreak agents, and (3) these jailbreaks enable coherent and malicious multi-step agent behavior and retain model capabilities. We publicly release AgentHarm to enable simple and reliable evaluation of attacks and defenses for LLM-based agents. We publicly release the benchmark at https://huggingface.co/ai-safety-institute/AgentHarm.

### Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning of State Space Models
**Authors**: Kevin Galim, Wonjun Kang, Yuchen Zeng, Hyung Il Koo, Kangwook Lee

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T17:30:28Z

**Summary**: Deep State Space Models (SSMs), such as Mamba (Gu & Dao, 2024), have emerged as powerful tools for language modeling, offering high performance with efficient inference and linear scaling in sequence length. However, the application of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods to SSM-based models remains largely unexplored. This paper aims to systematically study two key questions: (i) How do existing PEFT methods perform on SSM-based models? (ii) Which modules are most effective for fine-tuning? We conduct an empirical benchmark of four basic PEFT methods on SSM-based models. Our findings reveal that prompt-based methods (e.g., prefix-tuning) are no longer effective, an empirical result further supported by theoretical analysis. In contrast, LoRA remains effective for SSM-based models. We further investigate the optimal application of LoRA within these models, demonstrating both theoretically and experimentally that applying LoRA to linear projection matrices without modifying SSM modules yields the best results, as LoRA is not effective at tuning SSM modules. To further improve performance, we introduce LoRA with Selective Dimension tuning (SDLoRA), which selectively updates certain channels and states on SSM modules while applying LoRA to linear projection matrices. Extensive experimental results show that this approach outperforms standard LoRA.

### The Impact of Visual Information in Chinese Characters: Evaluating Large   Models' Ability to Recognize and Utilize Radicals
**Authors**: Xiaofeng Wu, Karl Stratos, Wei Xu

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T17:30:02Z

**Summary**: The glyphic writing system of Chinese incorporates information-rich visual features in each character, such as radicals that provide hints about meaning or pronunciation. However, there has been no investigation into whether contemporary Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can harness these sub-character features in Chinese through prompting. In this study, we establish a benchmark to evaluate LLMs' and VLMs' understanding of visual elements in Chinese characters, including radicals, composition structures, strokes, and stroke counts. Our results reveal that models surprisingly exhibit some, but still limited, knowledge of the visual information, regardless of whether images of characters are provided. To incite models' ability to use radicals, we further experiment with incorporating radicals into the prompts for Chinese language understanding tasks. We observe consistent improvement in Part-Of-Speech tagging when providing additional information about radicals, suggesting the potential to enhance CLP by integrating sub-character information.

### Software Engineering and Foundation Models: Insights from Industry Blogs   Using a Jury of Foundation Models
**Authors**: Hao Li, Cor-Paul Bezemer, Ahmed E. Hassan

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T17:27:04Z

**Summary**: Foundation models (FMs) such as large language models (LLMs) have significantly impacted many fields, including software engineering (SE). The interaction between SE and FMs has led to the integration of FMs into SE practices (FM4SE) and the application of SE methodologies to FMs (SE4FM). While several literature surveys exist on academic contributions to these trends, we are the first to provide a practitioner's view. We analyze 155 FM4SE and 997 SE4FM blog posts from leading technology companies, leveraging an FM-powered surveying approach to systematically label and summarize the discussed activities and tasks. We observed that while code generation is the most prominent FM4SE task, FMs are leveraged for many other SE activities such as code understanding, summarization, and API recommendation. The majority of blog posts on SE4FM are about model deployment & operation, and system architecture & orchestration. Although the emphasis is on cloud deployments, there is a growing interest in compressing FMs and deploying them on smaller devices such as edge or mobile devices. We outline eight future research directions inspired by our gained insights, aiming to bridge the gap between academic findings and real-world applications. Our study not only enriches the body of knowledge on practical applications of FM4SE and SE4FM but also demonstrates the utility of FMs as a powerful and efficient approach in conducting literature surveys within technical and grey literature domains. Our dataset, results, code and used prompts can be found in our online replication package at https://github.com/SAILResearch/fmse-blogs.

### SuperCorrect: Supervising and Correcting Language Models with   Error-Driven Insights
**Authors**: Ling Yang, Zhaochen Yu, Tianjun Zhang, Minkai Xu, Joseph E. Gonzalez, Bin Cui, Shuicheng Yan

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T17:25:52Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4, PaLM, and LLaMA have shown significant improvements in various reasoning tasks. However, smaller models such as Llama-3-8B and DeepSeekMath-Base still struggle with complex mathematical reasoning because they fail to effectively identify and correct reasoning errors. Recent reflection-based methods aim to address these issues by enabling self-reflection and self-correction, but they still face challenges in independently detecting errors in their reasoning steps. To overcome these limitations, we propose SuperCorrect, a novel two-stage framework that uses a large teacher model to supervise and correct both the reasoning and reflection processes of a smaller student model. In the first stage, we extract hierarchical high-level and detailed thought templates from the teacher model to guide the student model in eliciting more fine-grained reasoning thoughts. In the second stage, we introduce cross-model collaborative direct preference optimization (DPO) to enhance the self-correction abilities of the student model by following the teacher's correction traces during training. This cross-model DPO approach teaches the student model to effectively locate and resolve erroneous thoughts with error-driven insights from the teacher model, breaking the bottleneck of its thoughts and acquiring new skills and knowledge to tackle challenging problems. Extensive experiments consistently demonstrate our superiority over previous methods. Notably, our SuperCorrect-7B model significantly surpasses powerful DeepSeekMath-7B by 7.8%/5.3% and Qwen2.5-Math-7B by 15.1%/6.3% on MATH/GSM8K benchmarks, achieving new SOTA performance among all 7B models.

### From Interaction to Impact: Towards Safer AI Agents Through   Understanding and Evaluating UI Operation Impacts
**Authors**: Zhuohao Jerry Zhang, Eldon Schoop, Jeffrey Nichols, Anuj Mahajan, Amanda Swearngin

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T17:24:00Z

**Summary**: With advances in generative AI, there is increasing work towards creating autonomous agents that can manage daily tasks by operating user interfaces (UIs). While prior research has studied the mechanics of how AI agents might navigate UIs and understand UI structure, the effects of agents and their autonomous actions-particularly those that may be risky or irreversible-remain under-explored. In this work, we investigate the real-world impacts and consequences of UI actions by AI agents. We began by developing a taxonomy of the impacts of UI actions through a series of workshops with domain experts. Following this, we conducted a data synthesis study to gather realistic UI screen traces and action data that users perceive as impactful. We then used our impact categories to annotate our collected data and data repurposed from existing UI navigation datasets. Our quantitative evaluations of different large language models (LLMs) and variants demonstrate how well different LLMs can understand the impacts of UI actions that might be taken by an agent. We show that our taxonomy enhances the reasoning capabilities of these LLMs for understanding the impacts of UI actions, but our findings also reveal significant gaps in their ability to reliably classify more nuanced or complex categories of impact.

### Controlling Whisper: Universal Acoustic Adversarial Attacks to Control   Speech Foundation Models
**Authors**: Vyas Raina, Mark Gales

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T17:21:40Z

**Summary**: Speech enabled foundation models, either in the form of flexible speech recognition based systems or audio-prompted large language models (LLMs), are becoming increasingly popular. One of the interesting aspects of these models is their ability to perform tasks other than automatic speech recognition (ASR) using an appropriate prompt. For example, the OpenAI Whisper model can perform both speech transcription and speech translation. With the development of audio-prompted LLMs there is the potential for even greater control options. In this work we demonstrate that with this greater flexibility the systems can be susceptible to model-control adversarial attacks. Without any access to the model prompt it is possible to modify the behaviour of the system by appropriately changing the audio input. To illustrate this risk, we demonstrate that it is possible to prepend a short universal adversarial acoustic segment to any input speech signal to override the prompt setting of an ASR foundation model. Specifically, we successfully use a universal adversarial acoustic segment to control Whisper to always perform speech translation, despite being set to perform speech transcription. Overall, this work demonstrates a new form of adversarial attack on multi-tasking speech enabled foundation models that needs to be considered prior to the deployment of this form of model.

### Characterization of uncertainties in electron-argon collision cross   sections
**Authors**: Seung Whan Chung, Todd A. Oliver, Laxminarayan L. Raja, Robert D. Moser

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T17:21:34Z

**Summary**: The predictive capability of a plasma discharge model depends on accurate representations of electron-impact collision cross sections, which determine the key reaction rates and transport properties of the plasma. Although many cross sections have been identified through experiments and quantum mechanical simulations, their uncertainties are not well-investigated. We characterize the uncertainties in electron-argon collision cross sections using a Bayesian framework. Six collision processes -- elastic momentum transfer, ionization, and four excitations -- are characterized with semi-empirical models, whose parametric uncertainties effectively capture the features important to the macroscopic properties of the plasma, namely transport properties and chemical reaction rates. The method is designed to capture the effects of systematic errors that lead to large discrepancies between some data sets. Specifically, for the purposes of Bayesian inference, each of the parametric cross section models is augmented with a Gaussian process representing systematic measurement errors as well as model inadequacies in the parametric form. The results show that the method is able to capture scatter in the data between the electron-beam experiments and ab-initio quantum simulations. The calibrated cross section models are further validated against measurements from swarm-parameter experiments.

### DA-Ada: Learning Domain-Aware Adapter for Domain Adaptive Object   Detection
**Authors**: Haochen Li, Rui Zhang, Hantao Yao, Xin Zhang, Yifan Hao, Xinkai Song, Xiaqing Li, Yongwei Zhao, Ling Li, Yunji Chen

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T17:20:04Z

**Summary**: Domain adaptive object detection (DAOD) aims to generalize detectors trained on an annotated source domain to an unlabelled target domain. As the visual-language models (VLMs) can provide essential general knowledge on unseen images, freezing the visual encoder and inserting a domain-agnostic adapter can learn domain-invariant knowledge for DAOD. However, the domain-agnostic adapter is inevitably biased to the source domain. It discards some beneficial knowledge discriminative on the unlabelled domain, i.e., domain-specific knowledge of the target domain. To solve the issue, we propose a novel Domain-Aware Adapter (DA-Ada) tailored for the DAOD task. The key point is exploiting domain-specific knowledge between the essential general knowledge and domain-invariant knowledge. DA-Ada consists of the Domain-Invariant Adapter (DIA) for learning domain-invariant knowledge and the Domain-Specific Adapter (DSA) for injecting the domain-specific knowledge from the information discarded by the visual encoder. Comprehensive experiments over multiple DAOD tasks show that DA-Ada can efficiently infer a domain-aware visual encoder for boosting domain adaptive object detection. Our code is available at https://github.com/Therock90421/DA-Ada.

### LLM-Generated Black-box Explanations Can Be Adversarially Helpful
**Authors**: Rohan Ajwani, Shashidhar Reddy Javaji, Frank Rudzicz, Zining Zhu

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T17:16:30Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming vital tools that help us solve and understand complex problems by acting as digital assistants. LLMs can generate convincing explanations, even when only given the inputs and outputs of these problems, i.e., in a ``black-box'' approach. However, our research uncovers a hidden risk tied to this approach, which we call *adversarial helpfulness*. This happens when an LLM's explanations make a wrong answer look right, potentially leading people to trust incorrect solutions. In this paper, we show that this issue affects not just humans, but also LLM evaluators. Digging deeper, we identify and examine key persuasive strategies employed by LLMs. Our findings reveal that these models employ strategies such as reframing the questions, expressing an elevated level of confidence, and cherry-picking evidence to paint misleading answers in a credible light. To examine if LLMs are able to navigate complex-structured knowledge when generating adversarially helpful explanations, we create a special task based on navigating through graphs. Most LLMs are not able to find alternative paths along simple graphs, indicating that their misleading explanations aren't produced by only logical deductions using complex knowledge. These findings shed light on the limitations of the black-box explanation setting and allow us to provide advice on the safe usage of LLMs.

### Hypothesis-only Biases in Large Language Model-Elicited Natural Language   Inference
**Authors**: Grace Proebsting, Adam Poliak

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T17:09:22Z

**Summary**: We test whether replacing crowdsource workers with LLMs to write Natural Language Inference (NLI) hypotheses similarly results in annotation artifacts. We recreate a portion of the Stanford NLI corpus using GPT-4, Llama-2 and Mistral 7b, and train hypothesis-only classifiers to determine whether LLM-elicited hypotheses contain annotation artifacts. On our LLM-elicited NLI datasets, BERT-based hypothesis-only classifiers achieve between 86-96% accuracy, indicating these datasets contain hypothesis-only artifacts. We also find frequent "give-aways" in LLM-generated hypotheses, e.g. the phrase "swimming in a pool" appears in more than 10,000 contradictions generated by GPT-4. Our analysis provides empirical evidence that well-attested biases in NLI can persist in LLM-generated data.

### Science is Exploration: Computational Frontiers for Conceptual Metaphor   Theory
**Authors**: Rebecca M. M. Hicke, Ross Deans Kristensen-McLachlan

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T17:03:13Z

**Summary**: Metaphors are everywhere. They appear extensively across all domains of natural language, from the most sophisticated poetry to seemingly dry academic prose. A significant body of research in the cognitive science of language argues for the existence of conceptual metaphors, the systematic structuring of one domain of experience in the language of another. Conceptual metaphors are not simply rhetorical flourishes but are crucial evidence of the role of analogical reasoning in human cognition. In this paper, we ask whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can accurately identify and explain the presence of such conceptual metaphors in natural language data. Using a novel prompting technique based on metaphor annotation guidelines, we demonstrate that LLMs are a promising tool for large-scale computational research on conceptual metaphors. Further, we show that LLMs are able to apply procedural guidelines designed for human annotators, displaying a surprising depth of linguistic knowledge.

### SubZero: Random Subspace Zeroth-Order Optimization for Memory-Efficient   LLM Fine-Tuning
**Authors**: Ziming Yu, Pan Zhou, Sike Wang, Jia Li, Hua Huang

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T17:01:43Z

**Summary**: Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) has proven effective for a variety of downstream tasks. However, as LLMs grow in size, the memory demands for backpropagation become increasingly prohibitive. Zeroth-order (ZO) optimization methods offer a memory-efficient alternative by using forward passes to estimate gradients, but the variance of gradient estimates typically scales linearly with the model's parameter dimension$\unicode{x2013}$a significant issue for LLMs. In this paper, we propose the random Subspace Zeroth-order (SubZero) optimization to address the challenges posed by LLMs' high dimensionality. We introduce a low-rank perturbation tailored for LLMs that significantly reduces memory consumption while improving training performance. Additionally, we prove that our gradient estimation closely approximates the backpropagation gradient, exhibits lower variance than traditional ZO methods, and ensures convergence when combined with SGD. Experimental results show that SubZero enhances fine-tuning performance and achieves faster convergence compared to standard ZO approaches like MeZO across various language modeling tasks.

### Towards Trustworthy Knowledge Graph Reasoning: An Uncertainty Aware   Perspective
**Authors**: Bo Ni, Yu Wang, Lu Cheng, Erik Blasch, Tyler Derr

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T16:57:30Z

**Summary**: Recently, Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have been successfully coupled with Large Language Models (LLMs) to mitigate their hallucinations and enhance their reasoning capability, such as in KG-based retrieval-augmented frameworks. However, current KG-LLM frameworks lack rigorous uncertainty estimation, limiting their reliable deployment in high-stakes applications. Directly incorporating uncertainty quantification into KG-LLM frameworks presents challenges due to their complex architectures and the intricate interactions between the knowledge graph and language model components. To address this gap, we propose a new trustworthy KG-LLM framework, Uncertainty Aware Knowledge-Graph Reasoning (UAG), which incorporates uncertainty quantification into the KG-LLM framework. We design an uncertainty-aware multi-step reasoning framework that leverages conformal prediction to provide a theoretical guarantee on the prediction set. To manage the error rate of the multi-step process, we additionally introduce an error rate control module to adjust the error rate within the individual components. Extensive experiments show that our proposed UAG can achieve any pre-defined coverage rate while reducing the prediction set/interval size by 40% on average over the baselines.

### Learning Representations of Instruments for Partial Identification of   Treatment Effects
**Authors**: Jonas Schweisthal, Dennis Frauen, Maresa Schr√∂der, Konstantin Hess, Niki Kilbertus, Stefan Feuerriegel

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T16:48:32Z

**Summary**: Reliable estimation of treatment effects from observational data is important in many disciplines such as medicine. However, estimation is challenging when unconfoundedness as a standard assumption in the causal inference literature is violated. In this work, we leverage arbitrary (potentially high-dimensional) instruments to estimate bounds on the conditional average treatment effect (CATE). Our contributions are three-fold: (1) We propose a novel approach for partial identification through a mapping of instruments to a discrete representation space so that we yield valid bounds on the CATE. This is crucial for reliable decision-making in real-world applications. (2) We derive a two-step procedure that learns tight bounds using a tailored neural partitioning of the latent instrument space. As a result, we avoid instability issues due to numerical approximations or adversarial training. Furthermore, our procedure aims to reduce the estimation variance in finite-sample settings to yield more reliable estimates. (3) We show theoretically that our procedure obtains valid bounds while reducing estimation variance. We further perform extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness across various settings. Overall, our procedure offers a novel path for practitioners to make use of potentially high-dimensional instruments (e.g., as in Mendelian randomization).

### ALVIN: Active Learning Via INterpolation
**Authors**: Michalis Korakakis, Andreas Vlachos, Adrian Weller

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T16:44:39Z

**Summary**: Active Learning aims to minimize annotation effort by selecting the most useful instances from a pool of unlabeled data. However, typical active learning methods overlook the presence of distinct example groups within a class, whose prevalence may vary, e.g., in occupation classification datasets certain demographics are disproportionately represented in specific classes. This oversight causes models to rely on shortcuts for predictions, i.e., spurious correlations between input attributes and labels occurring in well-represented groups. To address this issue, we propose Active Learning Via INterpolation (ALVIN), which conducts intra-class interpolations between examples from under-represented and well-represented groups to create anchors, i.e., artificial points situated between the example groups in the representation space. By selecting instances close to the anchors for annotation, ALVIN identifies informative examples exposing the model to regions of the representation space that counteract the influence of shortcuts. Crucially, since the model considers these examples to be of high certainty, they are likely to be ignored by typical active learning methods. Experimental results on six datasets encompassing sentiment analysis, natural language inference, and paraphrase detection demonstrate that ALVIN outperforms state-of-the-art active learning methods in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution generalization.

### NoVo: Norm Voting off Hallucinations with Attention Heads in Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Zheng Yi Ho, Siyuan Liang, Sen Zhang, Yibing Zhan, Dacheng Tao

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T16:40:03Z

**Summary**: Hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) remain a major obstacle, particularly in high-stakes applications where factual accuracy is critical. While representation editing and reading methods have made strides in reducing hallucinations, their heavy reliance on specialised tools and training on in-domain samples, makes them difficult to scale and prone to overfitting. This limits their accuracy gains and generalizability to diverse datasets. This paper presents a lightweight method, Norm Voting (NoVo), which harnesses the untapped potential of attention head norms to dramatically enhance factual accuracy in zero-shot multiple-choice questions (MCQs). NoVo begins by automatically selecting truth-correlated head norms with an efficient, inference-only algorithm using only 30 random samples, allowing NoVo to effortlessly scale to diverse datasets. Afterwards, selected head norms are employed in a simple voting algorithm, which yields significant gains in prediction accuracy. On TruthfulQA MC1, NoVo surpasses the current state-of-the-art and all previous methods by an astounding margin -- at least 19 accuracy points. NoVo demonstrates exceptional generalization to 20 diverse datasets, with significant gains in over 90\% of them, far exceeding all current representation editing and reading methods. NoVo also reveals promising gains to finetuning strategies and building textual adversarial defence. NoVo's effectiveness with head norms opens new frontiers in LLM interpretability, robustness and reliability.

### Controllable Safety Alignment: Inference-Time Adaptation to Diverse   Safety Requirements
**Authors**: Jingyu Zhang, Ahmed Elgohary, Ahmed Magooda, Daniel Khashabi, Benjamin Van Durme

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T16:38:01Z

**Summary**: The current paradigm for safety alignment of large language models (LLMs) follows a one-size-fits-all approach: the model refuses to interact with any content deemed unsafe by the model provider. This approach lacks flexibility in the face of varying social norms across cultures and regions. In addition, users may have diverse safety needs, making a model with static safety standards too restrictive to be useful, as well as too costly to be re-aligned.   We propose Controllable Safety Alignment (CoSA), a framework designed to adapt models to diverse safety requirements without re-training. Instead of aligning a fixed model, we align models to follow safety configs -- free-form natural language descriptions of the desired safety behaviors -- that are provided as part of the system prompt. To adjust model safety behavior, authorized users only need to modify such safety configs at inference time. To enable that, we propose CoSAlign, a data-centric method for aligning LLMs to easily adapt to diverse safety configs. Furthermore, we devise a novel controllability evaluation protocol that considers both helpfulness and configured safety, summarizing them into CoSA-Score, and construct CoSApien, a human-authored benchmark that consists of real-world LLM use cases with diverse safety requirements and corresponding evaluation prompts.   We show that CoSAlign leads to substantial gains of controllability over strong baselines including in-context alignment. Our framework encourages better representation and adaptation to pluralistic human values in LLMs, and thereby increasing their practicality.

### Language Imbalance Driven Rewarding for Multilingual Self-improving
**Authors**: Wen Yang, Junhong Wu, Chen Wang, Chengqing Zong, Jiajun Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T16:32:05Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance across numerous tasks. However, these advancements have predominantly benefited "first-class" languages such as English and Chinese, leaving many other languages underrepresented. This imbalance, while limiting broader applications, generates a natural preference ranking between languages, offering an opportunity to bootstrap the multilingual capabilities of LLM in a self-improving manner. Thus, we propose $\textit{Language Imbalance Driven Rewarding}$, where the inherent imbalance between dominant and non-dominant languages within LLMs is leveraged as a reward signal. Iterative DPO training demonstrates that this approach not only enhances LLM performance in non-dominant languages but also improves the dominant language's capacity, thereby yielding an iterative reward signal. Fine-tuning Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct over two iterations of this approach results in continuous improvements in multilingual performance across instruction-following and arithmetic reasoning tasks, evidenced by an average improvement of 7.46% win rate on the X-AlpacaEval leaderboard and 13.9% accuracy on the MGSM benchmark. This work serves as an initial exploration, paving the way for multilingual self-improvement of LLMs.

### Interpretable Contrastive Monte Carlo Tree Search Reasoning
**Authors**: Zitian Gao, Boye Niu, Xuzheng He, Haotian Xu, Hongzhang Liu, Aiwei Liu, Xuming Hu, Lijie Wen

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T16:28:36Z

**Summary**: We propose SC-MCTS*: a novel Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) reasoning algorithm for Large Language Models (LLMs), significantly improves both reasoning accuracy and speed. Our motivation comes from: 1. Previous MCTS LLM reasoning works often overlooked its biggest drawback--slower speed compared to CoT; 2. Previous research mainly used MCTS as a tool for LLM reasoning on various tasks with limited quantitative analysis or ablation studies of its components from reasoning interpretability perspective. 3. The reward model is the most crucial component in MCTS, however previous work has rarely conducted in-depth study or improvement of MCTS's reward models. Thus, we conducted extensive ablation studies and quantitative analysis on components of MCTS, revealing the impact of each component on the MCTS reasoning performance of LLMs. Building on this, (i) we designed a highly interpretable reward model based on the principle of contrastive decoding and (ii) achieved an average speed improvement of 51.9% per node using speculative decoding. Additionally, (iii) we improved UCT node selection strategy and backpropagation used in previous works, resulting in significant performance improvement. We outperformed o1-mini by an average of 17.4% on the Blocksworld multi-step reasoning dataset using Llama-3.1-70B with SC-MCTS*.

### Token Erasure as a Footprint of Implicit Vocabulary Items in LLMs
**Authors**: Sheridan Feucht, David Atkinson, Byron Wallace, David Bau

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T16:20:16Z

**Summary**: LLMs process text as sequences of tokens that roughly correspond to words, where less common words are represented by multiple tokens. However, individual tokens are often semantically unrelated to the meanings of the words/concepts they comprise. For example, Llama-2-7b's tokenizer splits the word "northeastern" into the tokens ['_n', 'ort', 'he', 'astern'], none of which correspond to semantically meaningful units like "north" or "east." Similarly, the overall meanings of named entities like "Neil Young" and multi-word expressions like "break a leg" cannot be directly inferred from their constituent tokens. Mechanistically, how do LLMs convert such arbitrary groups of tokens into useful higher-level representations? In this work, we find that last token representations of named entities and multi-token words exhibit a pronounced "erasure" effect, where information about previous and current tokens is rapidly forgotten in early layers. Using this observation, we propose a method to "read out" the implicit vocabulary of an autoregressive LLM by examining differences in token representations across layers, and present results of this method for Llama-2-7b and Llama-3-8B. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to probe the implicit vocabulary of an LLM.

### PostMark: A Robust Blackbox Watermark for Large Language Models
**Authors**: Yapei Chang, Kalpesh Krishna, Amir Houmansadr, John Wieting, Mohit Iyyer

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T16:19:55Z

**Summary**: The most effective techniques to detect LLM-generated text rely on inserting a detectable signature -- or watermark -- during the model's decoding process. Most existing watermarking methods require access to the underlying LLM's logits, which LLM API providers are loath to share due to fears of model distillation. As such, these watermarks must be implemented independently by each LLM provider. In this paper, we develop PostMark, a modular post-hoc watermarking procedure in which an input-dependent set of words (determined via a semantic embedding) is inserted into the text after the decoding process has completed. Critically, PostMark does not require logit access, which means it can be implemented by a third party. We also show that PostMark is more robust to paraphrasing attacks than existing watermarking methods: our experiments cover eight baseline algorithms, five base LLMs, and three datasets. Finally, we evaluate the impact of PostMark on text quality using both automated and human assessments, highlighting the trade-off between quality and robustness to paraphrasing. We release our code, outputs, and annotations at https://github.com/lilakk/PostMark.

### On the Adversarial Transferability of Generalized "Skip Connections"
**Authors**: Yisen Wang, Yichuan Mo, Dongxian Wu, Mingjie Li, Xingjun Ma, Zhouchen Lin

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T16:17:47Z

**Summary**: Skip connection is an essential ingredient for modern deep models to be deeper and more powerful. Despite their huge success in normal scenarios (state-of-the-art classification performance on natural examples), we investigate and identify an interesting property of skip connections under adversarial scenarios, namely, the use of skip connections allows easier generation of highly transferable adversarial examples. Specifically, in ResNet-like models (with skip connections), we find that using more gradients from the skip connections rather than the residual modules according to a decay factor during backpropagation allows one to craft adversarial examples with high transferability. The above method is termed as Skip Gradient Method (SGM). Although starting from ResNet-like models in vision domains, we further extend SGM to more advanced architectures, including Vision Transformers (ViTs) and models with length-varying paths and other domains, i.e. natural language processing. We conduct comprehensive transfer attacks against various models including ResNets, Transformers, Inceptions, Neural Architecture Search, and Large Language Models (LLMs). We show that employing SGM can greatly improve the transferability of crafted attacks in almost all cases. Furthermore, considering the big complexity for practical use, we further demonstrate that SGM can even improve the transferability on ensembles of models or targeted attacks and the stealthiness against current defenses. At last, we provide theoretical explanations and empirical insights on how SGM works. Our findings not only motivate new adversarial research into the architectural characteristics of models but also open up further challenges for secure model architecture design.

### The Dynamics of Social Conventions in LLM populations: Spontaneous   Emergence, Collective Biases and Tipping Points
**Authors**: Ariel Flint Ashery, Luca Maria Aiello, Andrea Baronchelli

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T16:16:38Z

**Summary**: Social conventions are the foundation for social and economic life. As legions of AI agents increasingly interact with each other and with humans, their ability to form shared conventions will determine how effectively they will coordinate behaviors, integrate into society and influence it. Here, we investigate the dynamics of conventions within populations of Large Language Model (LLM) agents using simulated interactions. First, we show that globally accepted social conventions can spontaneously arise from local interactions between communicating LLMs. Second, we demonstrate how strong collective biases can emerge during this process, even when individual agents appear to be unbiased. Third, we examine how minority groups of committed LLMs can drive social change by establishing new social conventions. We show that once these minority groups reach a critical size, they can consistently overturn established behaviors. In all cases, contrasting the experimental results with predictions from a minimal multi-agent model allows us to isolate the specific role of LLM agents. Our results clarify how AI systems can autonomously develop norms without explicit programming and have implications for designing AI systems that align with human values and societal goals.

### Distributed Quantum Hypothesis Testing under Zero-rate Communication   Constraints
**Authors**: Sreejith Sreekumar, Christoph Hirche, Hao-Chung Cheng, Mario Berta

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T16:03:10Z

**Summary**: The trade-offs between error probabilities in quantum hypothesis testing are by now well-understood in the centralized setting, but much less is known for distributed settings. Here, we study a distributed binary hypothesis testing problem to infer a bipartite quantum state shared between two remote parties, where one of these parties communicates classical information to the tester at zero-rate (while the other party communicates classical or quantum information to the tester at zero-rate or higher). As our main contribution, we derive an efficiently computable single-letter formula for the Stein's exponent of this problem, when the state under the alternative is product. For the general case, we show that the Stein's exponent is given by a multi-letter expression involving max-min optimization of regularized measured relative entropy. While this becomes single-letter for the fully classical case, we further prove that this already does not happen in the same way for classical-quantum states in general. As a key tool for proving the converse direction of our results, we develop a quantum version of the blowing-up lemma which may be of independent interest.

### Automated Deep Neural Network Inference Partitioning for Distributed   Embedded Systems
**Authors**: Fabian Kre√ü, El Mahdi El Annabi, Tim Hotfilter, Julian Hoefer, Tanja Harbaum, Juergen Becker

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T15:55:00Z

**Summary**: Distributed systems can be found in various applications, e.g., in robotics or autonomous driving, to achieve higher flexibility and robustness. Thereby, data flow centric applications such as Deep Neural Network (DNN) inference benefit from partitioning the workload over multiple compute nodes in terms of performance and energy-efficiency. However, mapping large models on distributed embedded systems is a complex task, due to low latency and high throughput requirements combined with strict energy and memory constraints. In this paper, we present a novel approach for hardware-aware layer scheduling of DNN inference in distributed embedded systems. Therefore, our proposed framework uses a graph-based algorithm to automatically find beneficial partitioning points in a given DNN. Each of these is evaluated based on several essential system metrics such as accuracy and memory utilization, while considering the respective system constraints. We demonstrate our approach in terms of the impact of inference partitioning on various performance metrics of six different DNNs. As an example, we can achieve a 47.5 % throughput increase for EfficientNet-B0 inference partitioned onto two platforms while observing high energy-efficiency.

**Authors**: Klaudia Thellmann, Bernhard Stadler, Michael Fromm, Jasper Schulze Buschhoff, Alex Jude, Fabio Barth, Johannes Leveling, Nicolas Flores-Herr, Joachim K√∂hler, Ren√© J√§kel, Mehdi Ali

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T15:53:24Z

**Summary**: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized natural language processing across numerous languages and tasks. However, evaluating LLM performance in a consistent and meaningful way across multiple European languages remains challenging, especially due to the scarcity of multilingual benchmarks. We introduce a cross-lingual evaluation approach tailored for European languages. We employ translated versions of five widely-used benchmarks to assess the capabilities of 40 LLMs across 21 European languages. Our contributions include examining the effectiveness of translated benchmarks, assessing the impact of different translation services, and offering a multilingual evaluation framework for LLMs that includes newly created datasets: EU20-MMLU, EU20-HellaSwag, EU20-ARC, EU20-TruthfulQA, and EU20-GSM8K. The benchmarks and results are made publicly available to encourage further research in multilingual LLM evaluation.

### DiffPO: A causal diffusion model for learning distributions of potential   outcomes
**Authors**: Yuchen Ma, Valentyn Melnychuk, Jonas Schweisthal, Stefan Feuerriegel

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T15:50:17Z

**Summary**: Predicting potential outcomes of interventions from observational data is crucial for decision-making in medicine, but the task is challenging due to the fundamental problem of causal inference. Existing methods are largely limited to point estimates of potential outcomes with no uncertain quantification; thus, the full information about the distributions of potential outcomes is typically ignored. In this paper, we propose a novel causal diffusion model called DiffPO, which is carefully designed for reliable inferences in medicine by learning the distribution of potential outcomes. In our DiffPO, we leverage a tailored conditional denoising diffusion model to learn complex distributions, where we address the selection bias through a novel orthogonal diffusion loss. Another strength of our DiffPO method is that it is highly flexible (e.g., it can also be used to estimate different causal quantities such as CATE). Across a wide range of experiments, we show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

### Path-minimizing Latent ODEs for improved extrapolation and inference
**Authors**: Matt L. Sampson, Peter Melchior

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T15:50:01Z

**Summary**: Latent ODE models provide flexible descriptions of dynamic systems, but they can struggle with extrapolation and predicting complicated non-linear dynamics. The latent ODE approach implicitly relies on encoders to identify unknown system parameters and initial conditions, whereas the evaluation times are known and directly provided to the ODE solver. This dichotomy can be exploited by encouraging time-independent latent representations. By replacing the common variational penalty in latent space with an $\ell_2$ penalty on the path length of each system, the models learn data representations that can easily be distinguished from those of systems with different configurations. This results in faster training, smaller models, more accurate interpolation and long-time extrapolation compared to the baseline ODE models with GRU, RNN, and LSTM encoder/decoders on tests with damped harmonic oscillator, self-gravitating fluid, and predator-prey systems. We also demonstrate superior results for simulation-based inference of the Lotka-Volterra parameters and initial conditions by using the latents as data summaries for a conditional normalizing flow. Our change to the training loss is agnostic to the specific recognition network used by the decoder and can therefore easily be adopted by other latent ODE models.

### Exploring the Design Space of Cognitive Engagement Techniques with   AI-Generated Code for Enhanced Learning
**Authors**: Majeed Kazemitabaar, Oliver Huang, Sangho Suh, Austin Z. Henley, Tovi Grossman

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T15:49:42Z

**Summary**: Novice programmers are increasingly relying on Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate code for learning programming concepts. However, this interaction can lead to superficial engagement, giving learners an illusion of learning and hindering skill development. To address this issue, we conducted a systematic design exploration to develop seven cognitive engagement techniques aimed at promoting deeper engagement with AI-generated code. In this paper, we describe our design process, the initial seven techniques and results from a between-subjects study (N=82). We then iteratively refined the top techniques and further evaluated them through a within-subjects study (N=42). We evaluate the friction each technique introduces, their effectiveness in helping learners apply concepts to isomorphic tasks without AI assistance, and their success in aligning learners' perceived and actual coding abilities. Ultimately, our results highlight the most effective technique: guiding learners through the step-by-step problem-solving process, where they engage in an interactive dialog with the AI, prompting what needs to be done at each stage before the corresponding code is revealed.

### Wikimedia data for AI: a review of Wikimedia datasets for NLP tasks and   AI-assisted editing
**Authors**: Isaac Johnson, Lucie-Aim√©e Kaffee, Miriam Redi

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T15:46:09Z

**Summary**: Wikimedia content is used extensively by the AI community and within the language modeling community in particular. In this paper, we provide a review of the different ways in which Wikimedia data is curated to use in NLP tasks across pre-training, post-training, and model evaluations. We point to opportunities for greater use of Wikimedia content but also identify ways in which the language modeling community could better center the needs of Wikimedia editors. In particular, we call for incorporating additional sources of Wikimedia data, a greater focus on benchmarks for LLMs that encode Wikimedia principles, and greater multilingualism in Wikimedia-derived datasets.

### Revisiting Hierarchical Text Classification: Inference and Metrics
**Authors**: Roman Plaud, Matthieu Labeau, Antoine Saillenfest, Thomas Bonald

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T15:44:28Z

**Summary**: Hierarchical text classification (HTC) is the task of assigning labels to a text within a structured space organized as a hierarchy. Recent works treat HTC as a conventional multilabel classification problem, therefore evaluating it as such. We instead propose to evaluate models based on specifically designed hierarchical metrics and we demonstrate the intricacy of metric choice and prediction inference method. We introduce a new challenging dataset and we evaluate fairly, recent sophisticated models, comparing them with a range of simple but strong baselines, including a new theoretically motivated loss. Finally, we show that those baselines are very often competitive with the latest models. This highlights the importance of carefully considering the evaluation methodology when proposing new methods for HTC. Code implementation and dataset are available at \url{https://github.com/RomanPlaud/revisitingHTC}.

### Test-driven Software Experimentation with LASSO: an LLM Benchmarking   Example
**Authors**: Marcus Kessel

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T15:32:48Z

**Summary**: Empirical software engineering faces a critical gap: the lack of standardized tools for rapid development and execution of Test-Driven Software Experiments (TDSEs) - that is, experiments that involve the execution of software subjects and the observation and analysis of their "de facto" run-time behavior. In this paper we present a general-purpose analysis platform called LASSO that provides a minimal set of domain-specific languages and data structures to conduct TDSEs. By empowering users with an executable scripting language to design and execute TDSEs, LASSO enables efficient evaluation of run-time semantics and execution characteristics in addition to statically determined properties. We present an example TDSE that demonstrates the practical benefits of LASSO's scripting capabilities for assessing the reliability of LLMs for code generation by means of a self-contained, reusable and extensible study script. The LASSO platform is freely available at: https://softwareobservatorium.github.io/, and a demo video is available on YouTube: https://youtu.be/tzY9oNTWXzw

### Generalized Median of Means Principle for Bayesian Inference
**Authors**: Stanislav Minsker, Shunan Yao

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T15:32:07Z

**Summary**: The topic of robustness is experiencing a resurgence of interest in the statistical and machine learning communities. In particular, robust algorithms making use of the so-called median of means estimator were shown to satisfy strong performance guarantees for many problems, including estimation of the mean, covariance structure as well as linear regression. In this work, we propose an extension of the median of means principle to the Bayesian framework, leading to the notion of the robust posterior distribution. In particular, we (a) quantify robustness of this posterior to outliers, (b) show that it satisfies a version of the Bernstein-von Mises theorem that connects Bayesian credible sets to the traditional confidence intervals, and (c) demonstrate that our approach performs well in applications.

### Modular Multimodal Machine Learning for Extraction of Theorems and   Proofs in Long Scientific Documents (Extended Version)
**Authors**: Shrey Mishra, Antoine Gauquier, Pierre Senellart

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T15:26:14Z

**Summary**: We address the extraction of mathematical statements and their proofs from scholarly PDF articles as a multimodal classification problem, utilizing text, font features, and bitmap image renderings of PDFs as distinct modalities. We propose a modular sequential multimodal machine learning approach specifically designed for extracting theorem-like environments and proofs. This is based on a cross-modal attention mechanism to generate multimodal paragraph embeddings, which are then fed into our novel multimodal sliding window transformer architecture to capture sequential information across paragraphs. Our document AI methodology stands out as it eliminates the need for OCR preprocessing, LaTeX sources during inference, or custom pre-training on specialized losses to understand cross-modality relationships. Unlike many conventional approaches that operate at a single-page level, ours can be directly applied to multi-page PDFs and seamlessly handles the page breaks often found in lengthy scientific mathematical documents. Our approach demonstrates performance improvements obtained by transitioning from unimodality to multimodality, and finally by incorporating sequential modeling over paragraphs.

**Authors**: Pooriya Jamie, Reyhaneh Hajihashemi, Sharareh Alipour

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T15:18:48Z

**Summary**: Integrating large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT is revolutionizing the field of computer science education. These models offer new possibilities for enriching student learning and supporting teaching assistants (TAs) in providing prompt feedback and supplementary learning resources. This research delves into the use of ChatGPT in a data structures and algorithms (DSA) course, particularly when combined with TA supervision. The findings demonstrate that incorporating ChatGPT with structured prompts and active TA guidance enhances students' understanding of intricate algorithmic concepts, boosts engagement, and elevates academic performance. However, challenges exist in addressing academic integrity and the limitations of LLMs in tackling complex problems. The study underscores the importance of active TA involvement in reducing students' reliance on AI-generated content and amplifying the overall educational impact. The results suggest that while LLMs can be advantageous for education, their successful integration demands continuous oversight and a thoughtful balance between AI and human guidance.

### A Quick, trustworthy spectral knowledge Q&A system leveraging   retrieval-augmented generation on LLM
**Authors**: Jiheng Liang, Ziru Yu, Zujie Xie, Xiangyang Yu

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T15:13:51Z

**Summary**: Large Language Model (LLM) has demonstrated significant success in a range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks within general domain. The emergence of LLM has introduced innovative methodologies across diverse fields, including the natural sciences. Researchers aim to implement automated, concurrent process driven by LLM to supplant conventional manual, repetitive and labor-intensive work. In the domain of spectral analysis and detection, it is imperative for researchers to autonomously acquire pertinent knowledge across various research objects, which encompasses the spectroscopic techniques and the chemometric methods that are employed in experiments and analysis. Paradoxically, despite the recognition of spectroscopic detection as an effective analytical method, the fundamental process of knowledge retrieval remains both time-intensive and repetitive. In response to this challenge, we first introduced the Spectral Detection and Analysis Based Paper(SDAAP) dataset, which is the first open-source textual knowledge dataset for spectral analysis and detection and contains annotated literature data as well as corresponding knowledge instruction data. Subsequently, we also designed an automated Q\&A framework based on the SDAAP dataset, which can retrieve relevant knowledge and generate high-quality responses by extracting entities in the input as retrieval parameters. It is worth noting that: within this framework, LLM is only used as a tool to provide generalizability, while RAG technique is used to accurately capture the source of the knowledge.This approach not only improves the quality of the generated responses, but also ensures the traceability of the knowledge. Experimental results show that our framework generates responses with more reliable expertise compared to the baseline.

### Federated Learning in Practice: Reflections and Projections
**Authors**: Katharine Daly, Hubert Eichner, Peter Kairouz, H. Brendan McMahan, Daniel Ramage, Zheng Xu

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T15:10:38Z

**Summary**: Federated Learning (FL) is a machine learning technique that enables multiple entities to collaboratively learn a shared model without exchanging their local data. Over the past decade, FL systems have achieved substantial progress, scaling to millions of devices across various learning domains while offering meaningful differential privacy (DP) guarantees. Production systems from organizations like Google, Apple, and Meta demonstrate the real-world applicability of FL. However, key challenges remain, including verifying server-side DP guarantees and coordinating training across heterogeneous devices, limiting broader adoption. Additionally, emerging trends such as large (multi-modal) models and blurred lines between training, inference, and personalization challenge traditional FL frameworks. In response, we propose a redefined FL framework that prioritizes privacy principles rather than rigid definitions. We also chart a path forward by leveraging trusted execution environments and open-source ecosystems to address these challenges and facilitate future advancements in FL.

### Bridge the Points: Graph-based Few-shot Segment Anything Semantically
**Authors**: Anqi Zhang, Guangyu Gao, Jianbo Jiao, Chi Harold Liu, Yunchao Wei

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T15:09:44Z

**Summary**: The recent advancements in large-scale pre-training techniques have significantly enhanced the capabilities of vision foundation models, notably the Segment Anything Model (SAM), which can generate precise masks based on point and box prompts. Recent studies extend SAM to Few-shot Semantic Segmentation (FSS), focusing on prompt generation for SAM-based automatic semantic segmentation. However, these methods struggle with selecting suitable prompts, require specific hyperparameter settings for different scenarios, and experience prolonged one-shot inference times due to the overuse of SAM, resulting in low efficiency and limited automation ability. To address these issues, we propose a simple yet effective approach based on graph analysis. In particular, a Positive-Negative Alignment module dynamically selects the point prompts for generating masks, especially uncovering the potential of the background context as the negative reference. Another subsequent Point-Mask Clustering module aligns the granularity of masks and selected points as a directed graph, based on mask coverage over points. These points are then aggregated by decomposing the weakly connected components of the directed graph in an efficient manner, constructing distinct natural clusters. Finally, the positive and overshooting gating, benefiting from graph-based granularity alignment, aggregate high-confident masks and filter out the false-positive masks for final prediction, reducing the usage of additional hyperparameters and redundant mask generation. Extensive experimental analysis across standard FSS, One-shot Part Segmentation, and Cross Domain FSS datasets validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach, surpassing state-of-the-art generalist models with a mIoU of 58.7% on COCO-20i and 35.2% on LVIS-92i. The code is available in https://andyzaq.github.io/GF-SAM/.

### Unraveling Cross-Modality Knowledge Conflicts in Large Vision-Language   Models
**Authors**: Tinghui Zhu, Qin Liu, Fei Wang, Zhengzhong Tu, Muhao Chen

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T15:07:31Z

**Summary**: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities for capturing and reasoning over multimodal inputs. However, these models are prone to parametric knowledge conflicts, which arise from inconsistencies of represented knowledge between their vision and language components. In this paper, we formally define the problem of $\textbf{cross-modality parametric knowledge conflict}$ and present a systematic approach to detect, interpret, and mitigate them. We introduce a pipeline that identifies conflicts between visual and textual answers, showing a persistently high conflict rate across modalities in recent LVLMs regardless of the model size. We further investigate how these conflicts interfere with the inference process and propose a contrastive metric to discern the conflicting samples from the others. Building on these insights, we develop a novel dynamic contrastive decoding method that removes undesirable logits inferred from the less confident modality components based on answer confidence. For models that do not provide logits, we also introduce two prompt-based strategies to mitigate the conflicts. Our methods achieve promising improvements in accuracy on both the ViQuAE and InfoSeek datasets. Specifically, using LLaVA-34B, our proposed dynamic contrastive decoding improves an average accuracy of 2.24%.

### Many wrong models approach to localize an odor source in turbulence with   static sensors
**Authors**: Lorenzo Piro, Robin A. Heinonen, Massimo Cencini, Luca Biferale

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T15:03:53Z

**Summary**: The problem of locating an odor source in turbulent flows is central to key applications such as environmental monitoring and disaster response. We address this challenge by designing an algorithm based on Bayesian inference, which uses odor measurements from an ensemble of static sensors to estimate the source position through a stochastic model of the environment. The problem is hard because of the multi-scale and out-of-equilibrium properties of turbulent transport, which lacks accurate analytical and phenomenological modeling, thus preventing a guaranteed convergence for Bayesian approaches. To overcome the risk of relying on a single unavoidably wrong model approximation, we propose a method to rank "many wrong models" and to blend their predictions. We evaluate our weighted Bayesian update algorithm by its ability to estimate the source location with predefined accuracy and/or within a specified time frame, and compare it to standard Monte Carlo sampling methods. To demonstrate the robustness and potential applications of both approaches under realistic environmental conditions, we use high-quality direct numerical simulations of the Navier-Stokes equations to mimic the transport of odors in the atmospheric boundary layer. Despite minimal prior information about the source and environmental conditions, our proposed approach consistently proves to be more accurate, reliable, and robust than Monte Carlo methods, thus showing promise as a new tool for addressing the odor source localization problem in real-world scenarios.

### Probabilistic Inversion Modeling of Gas Emissions: A Gradient-Based MCMC   Estimation of Gaussian Plume Parameters
**Authors**: Thomas Newman, Christopher Nemeth, Matthew Jones, Philip Jonathan

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T14:58:31Z

**Summary**: In response to global concerns regarding air quality and the environmental impact of greenhouse gas emissions, detecting and quantifying sources of emissions has become critical. To understand this impact and target mitigations effectively, methods for accurate quantification of greenhouse gas emissions are required. In this paper, we focus on the inversion of concentration measurements to estimate source location and emission rate. In practice, such methods often rely on atmospheric stability class-based Gaussian plume dispersion models. However, incorrectly identifying the atmospheric stability class can lead to significant bias in estimates of source characteristics. We present a robust approach that reduces this bias by jointly estimating the horizontal and vertical dispersion parameters of the Gaussian plume model, together with source location and emission rate, atmospheric background concentration, and sensor measurement error variance. Uncertainty in parameter estimation is quantified through probabilistic inversion using gradient-based MCMC methods. A simulation study is performed to assess the inversion methodology. We then focus on inference for the published Chilbolton dataset which contains controlled methane releases and demonstrates the practical benefits of estimating dispersion parameters in source inversion problems.

### Do Large Language Models have Shared Weaknesses in Medical Question   Answering?
**Authors**: Andrew M. Bean, Karolina Korgul, Felix Krones, Robert McCraith, Adam Mahdi

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T14:55:44Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have made rapid improvement on medical benchmarks, but their unreliability remains a persistent challenge for safe real-world uses. To design for the use LLMs as a category, rather than for specific models, requires developing an understanding of shared strengths and weaknesses which appear across models. To address this challenge, we benchmark a range of top LLMs and identify consistent patterns across models. We test $16$ well-known LLMs on $874$ newly collected questions from Polish medical licensing exams. For each question, we score each model on the top-1 accuracy and the distribution of probabilities assigned. We then compare these results with factors such as question difficulty for humans, question length, and the scores of the other models. LLM accuracies were positively correlated pairwise ($0.39$ to $0.58$). Model performance was also correlated with human performance ($0.09$ to $0.13$), but negatively correlated to the difference between the question-level accuracy of top-scoring and bottom-scoring humans ($-0.09$ to $-0.14$). The top output probability and question length were positive and negative predictors of accuracy respectively (p$< 0.05$). The top scoring LLM, GPT-4o Turbo, scored $84\%$, with Claude Opus, Gemini 1.5 Pro and Llama 3/3.1 between $74\%$ and $79\%$. We found evidence of similarities between models in which questions they answer correctly, as well as similarities with human test takers. Larger models typically performed better, but differences in training, architecture, and data were also highly impactful. Model accuracy was positively correlated with confidence, but negatively correlated with question length. We find similar results with older models, and argue that these patterns are likely to persist across future models using similar training methods.

### Evolution of SAE Features Across Layers in LLMs
**Authors**: Daniel Balcells, Benjamin Lerner, Michael Oesterle, Ediz Ucar, Stefan Heimersheim

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T14:46:49Z

**Summary**: Sparse Autoencoders for transformer-based language models are typically defined independently per layer. In this work we analyze statistical relationships between features in adjacent layers to understand how features evolve through a forward pass. We provide a graph visualization interface for features and their most similar next-layer neighbors, and build communities of related features across layers. We find that a considerable amount of features are passed through from a previous layer, some features can be expressed as quasi-boolean combinations of previous features, and some features become more specialized in later layers.

### Efficient, Multimodal, and Derivative-Free Bayesian Inference With   Fisher-Rao Gradient Flows
**Authors**: Yifan Chen, Daniel Zhengyu Huang, Jiaoyang Huang, Sebastian Reich, Andrew M. Stuart

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T14:45:41Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we study efficient approximate sampling for probability distributions known up to normalization constants. We specifically focus on a problem class arising in Bayesian inference for large-scale inverse problems in science and engineering applications. The computational challenges we address with the proposed methodology are: (i) the need for repeated evaluations of expensive forward models; (ii) the potential existence of multiple modes; and (iii) the fact that gradient of, or adjoint solver for, the forward model might not be feasible.   While existing Bayesian inference methods meet some of these challenges individually, we propose a framework that tackles all three systematically. Our approach builds upon the Fisher-Rao gradient flow in probability space, yielding a dynamical system for probability densities that converges towards the target distribution at a uniform exponential rate. This rapid convergence is advantageous for the computational burden outlined in (i). We apply Gaussian mixture approximations with operator splitting techniques to simulate the flow numerically; the resulting approximation can capture multiple modes thus addressing (ii). Furthermore, we employ the Kalman methodology to facilitate a derivative-free update of these Gaussian components and their respective weights, addressing the issue in (iii).   The proposed methodology results in an efficient derivative-free sampler flexible enough to handle multi-modal distributions: Gaussian Mixture Kalman Inversion (GMKI). The effectiveness of GMKI is demonstrated both theoretically and numerically in several experiments with multimodal target distributions, including proof-of-concept and two-dimensional examples, as well as a large-scale application: recovering the Navier-Stokes initial condition from solution data at positive times.

### A test for LISA foreground Gaussianity and stationarity. II. Extreme   mass-ratio inspirals
**Authors**: Manuel Piarulli, Riccardo Buscicchio, Federico Pozzoli, Ollie Burke, Matteo Bonetti, Alberto Sesana

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T14:42:20Z

**Summary**: Extreme Mass Ratio Inspirals (EMRIs) are key observational targets for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission. Unresolvable EMRI signals contribute to forming a gravitational wave background (GWB). Characterizing the statistical features of the GWB from EMRIs is of great importance, as EMRIs will ubiquitously affect large segments of the inference scheme. In this work, we apply a frequentist test for GWB Gaussianity and stationarity, exploring three astrophysically-motivated EMRI populations. We construct the resulting signal by combining state-of-the-art EMRI waveforms and a detailed description of the LISA response with time-delay interferometric variables. Depending on the brightness of the GWB, our analysis demonstrates that the resultant EMRI foregrounds show varying degrees of departure from the usual statistical assumptions that the GWBs are both Gaussian and Stationary. If the GWB is non-stationary with non-Gaussian features, this will challenge the robustness of Gaussian-likelihood model, when applied to global inference results, e.g. foreground estimation, background detection, and individual-source parameters reconstruction.

### Audio Description Generation in the Era of LLMs and VLMs: A Review of   Transferable Generative AI Technologies
**Authors**: Yingqiang Gao, Lukas Fischer, Alexa Lintner, Sarah Ebling

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T14:40:51Z

**Summary**: Audio descriptions (ADs) function as acoustic commentaries designed to assist blind persons and persons with visual impairments in accessing digital media content on television and in movies, among other settings. As an accessibility service typically provided by trained AD professionals, the generation of ADs demands significant human effort, making the process both time-consuming and costly. Recent advancements in natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV), particularly in large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs), have allowed for getting a step closer to automatic AD generation. This paper reviews the technologies pertinent to AD generation in the era of LLMs and VLMs: we discuss how state-of-the-art NLP and CV technologies can be applied to generate ADs and identify essential research directions for the future.

### Decoding Secret Memorization in Code LLMs Through Token-Level   Characterization
**Authors**: Yuqing Nie, Chong Wang, Kailong Wang, Guoai Xu, Guosheng Xu, Haoyu Wang

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T14:39:24Z

**Summary**: Code Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating, understanding, and manipulating programming code. However, their training process inadvertently leads to the memorization of sensitive information, posing severe privacy risks. Existing studies on memorization in LLMs primarily rely on prompt engineering techniques, which suffer from limitations such as widespread hallucination and inefficient extraction of the target sensitive information. In this paper, we present a novel approach to characterize real and fake secrets generated by Code LLMs based on token probabilities. We identify four key characteristics that differentiate genuine secrets from hallucinated ones, providing insights into distinguishing real and fake secrets. To overcome the limitations of existing works, we propose DESEC, a two-stage method that leverages token-level features derived from the identified characteristics to guide the token decoding process. DESEC consists of constructing an offline token scoring model using a proxy Code LLM and employing the scoring model to guide the decoding process by reassigning token likelihoods. Through extensive experiments on four state-of-the-art Code LLMs using a diverse dataset, we demonstrate the superior performance of DESEC in achieving a higher plausible rate and extracting more real secrets compared to existing baselines. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of our token-level approach in enabling an extensive assessment of the privacy leakage risks associated with Code LLMs.

**Authors**: Weichao Zhao, Hao Feng, Qi Liu, Jingqun Tang, Shu Wei, Binghong Wu, Lei Liao, Yongjie Ye, Hao Liu, Wengang Zhou, Houqiang Li, Can Huang

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T14:38:40Z

**Summary**: Tables contain factual and quantitative data accompanied by various structures and contents that pose challenges for machine comprehension. Previous methods generally design task-specific architectures and objectives for individual tasks, resulting in modal isolation and intricate workflows. In this paper, we present a novel large vision-language model, TabPedia, equipped with a concept synergy mechanism. In this mechanism, all the involved diverse visual table understanding (VTU) tasks and multi-source visual embeddings are abstracted as concepts. This unified framework allows TabPedia to seamlessly integrate VTU tasks, such as table detection, table structure recognition, table querying, and table question answering, by leveraging the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Moreover, the concept synergy mechanism enables table perception-related and comprehension-related tasks to work in harmony, as they can effectively leverage the needed clues from the corresponding source perception embeddings. Furthermore, to better evaluate the VTU task in real-world scenarios, we establish a new and comprehensive table VQA benchmark, ComTQA, featuring approximately 9,000 QA pairs. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments on both table perception and comprehension tasks, conducted across various public benchmarks, validate the effectiveness of our TabPedia. The superior performance further confirms the feasibility of using LLMs for understanding visual tables when all concepts work in synergy. The benchmark ComTQA has been open-sourced at https://huggingface.co/datasets/ByteDance/ComTQA. The source code and model also have been released athttps://github.com/zhaowc-ustc/TabPedia.

### MATCH: Model-Aware TVM-based Compilation for Heterogeneous Edge Devices
**Authors**: Mohamed Amine Hamdi, Francesco Daghero, Giuseppe Maria Sarda, Josse Van Delm, Arne Symons, Luca Benini, Marian Verhelst, Daniele Jahier Pagliari, Alessio Burrello

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T14:32:06Z

**Summary**: Streamlining the deployment of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) on heterogeneous edge platforms, coupling within the same micro-controller unit (MCU) instruction processors and hardware accelerators for tensor computations, is becoming one of the crucial challenges of the TinyML field.   The best-performing DNN compilation toolchains are usually deeply customized for a single MCU family, and porting to a different heterogeneous MCU family implies labor-intensive re-development of almost the entire compiler. On the opposite side, retargetable toolchains, such as TVM, fail to exploit the capabilities of custom accelerators, resulting in the generation of general but unoptimized code. To overcome this duality, we introduce MATCH, a novel TVM-based DNN deployment framework designed for easy agile retargeting across different MCU processors and accelerators, thanks to a customizable model-based hardware abstraction.   We show that a general and retargetable mapping framework enhanced with hardware cost models can compete with and even outperform custom toolchains on diverse targets while only needing the definition of an abstract hardware model and a SoC-specific API.   We tested MATCH on two state-of-the-art heterogeneous MCUs, GAP9 and DIANA.   On the four DNN models of the MLPerf Tiny suite MATCH reduces inference latency by up to 60.88 times on DIANA, compared to using the plain TVM, thanks to the exploitation of the on-board HW accelerator. Compared to HTVM, a fully customized toolchain for DIANA, we still reduce the latency by 16.94%. On GAP9, using the same benchmarks, we improve the latency by 2.15 times compared to the dedicated DORY compiler, thanks to our heterogeneous DNN mapping approach that synergically exploits the DNN accelerator and the eight-cores cluster available on board.

### Hybrid LLM-DDQN based Joint Optimization of V2I Communication and   Autonomous Driving
**Authors**: Zijiang Yan, Hao Zhou, Hina Tabassum, Xue Liu

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T14:30:04Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have received considerable interest recently due to their outstanding reasoning and comprehension capabilities. This work explores applying LLMs to vehicular networks, aiming to jointly optimize vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications and autonomous driving (AD) policies. We deploy LLMs for AD decision-making to maximize traffic flow and avoid collisions for road safety, and a double deep Q-learning algorithm (DDQN) is used for V2I optimization to maximize the received data rate and reduce frequent handovers. In particular, for LLM-enabled AD, we employ the Euclidean distance to identify previously explored AD experiences, and then LLMs can learn from past good and bad decisions for further improvement. Then, LLM-based AD decisions will become part of states in V2I problems, and DDQN will optimize the V2I decisions accordingly. After that, the AD and V2I decisions are iteratively optimized until convergence. Such an iterative optimization approach can better explore the interactions between LLMs and conventional reinforcement learning techniques, revealing the potential of using LLMs for network optimization and management. Finally, the simulations demonstrate that our proposed hybrid LLM-DDQN approach outperforms the conventional DDQN algorithm, showing faster convergence and higher average rewards.

### Measuring the Inconsistency of Large Language Models in Preferential   Ranking
**Authors**: Xiutian Zhao, Ke Wang, Wei Peng

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T14:27:18Z

**Summary**: Despite large language models' (LLMs) recent advancements, their bias and hallucination issues persist, and their ability to offer consistent preferential rankings remains underexplored. This study investigates the capacity of LLMs to provide consistent ordinal preferences, a crucial aspect in scenarios with dense decision space or lacking absolute answers. We introduce a formalization of consistency based on order theory, outlining criteria such as transitivity, asymmetry, reversibility, and independence from irrelevant alternatives. Our diagnostic experiments on selected state-of-the-art LLMs reveal their inability to meet these criteria, indicating a strong positional bias and poor transitivity, with preferences easily swayed by irrelevant alternatives. These findings highlight a significant inconsistency in LLM-generated preferential rankings, underscoring the need for further research to address these limitations.

### Causal inference targeting a concentration index for studies of health   inequalities
**Authors**: Mohammad Ghasempour, Xavier de Luna, Per E. Gustafsson

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T14:25:39Z

**Summary**: A concentration index, a standardized covariance between a health variable and relative income ranks, is often used to quantify income-related health inequalities. There is a lack of formal approach to study the effect of an exposure, e.g., education, on such measures of inequality. In this paper we contribute by filling this gap and developing the necessary theory and method. Thus, we define a counterfactual concentration index for different levels of an exposure. We give conditions for their identification, and then deduce their efficient influence function. This allows us to propose estimators, which are regular asymptotic linear under certain conditions. In particular, these estimators are $\sqrt n$-consistent and asymptotically normal, as well as locally efficient. The implementation of the estimators is based on the fit of several nuisance functions. The estimators proposed have rate robustness properties allowing for convergence rates slower than $\sqrt{n}$-rate for some of the nuisance function fits. The relevance of the asymptotic results for finite samples is studied with simulation experiments. We also present a case study of the effect of education on income-related health inequalities for a Swedish cohort.

### ELMO: Enhanced Real-time LiDAR Motion Capture through Upsampling
**Authors**: Deok-Kyeong Jang, Dongseok Yang, Deok-Yun Jang, Byeoli Choi, Donghoon Shin, Sung-hee Lee

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T14:12:48Z

**Summary**: This paper introduces ELMO, a real-time upsampling motion capture framework designed for a single LiDAR sensor. Modeled as a conditional autoregressive transformer-based upsampling motion generator, ELMO achieves 60 fps motion capture from a 20 fps LiDAR point cloud sequence. The key feature of ELMO is the coupling of the self-attention mechanism with thoughtfully designed embedding modules for motion and point clouds, significantly elevating the motion quality. To facilitate accurate motion capture, we develop a one-time skeleton calibration model capable of predicting user skeleton offsets from a single-frame point cloud. Additionally, we introduce a novel data augmentation technique utilizing a LiDAR simulator, which enhances global root tracking to improve environmental understanding. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we compare ELMO with state-of-the-art methods in both image-based and point cloud-based motion capture. We further conduct an ablation study to validate our design principles. ELMO's fast inference time makes it well-suited for real-time applications, exemplified in our demo video featuring live streaming and interactive gaming scenarios. Furthermore, we contribute a high-quality LiDAR-mocap synchronized dataset comprising 20 different subjects performing a range of motions, which can serve as a valuable resource for future research. The dataset and evaluation code are available at {\blue \url{https://movin3d.github.io/ELMO_SIGASIA2024/}}

### Distribution-free uncertainty quantification for inverse problems:   application to weak lensing mass mapping
**Authors**: Hubert Leterme, Jalal Fadili, Jean-Luc Starck

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T14:08:17Z

**Summary**: In inverse problems, distribution-free uncertainty quantification (UQ) aims to obtain error bars with coverage guarantees that are independent of any prior assumptions about the data distribution. In the context of mass mapping, uncertainties could lead to errors that affects our understanding of the underlying mass distribution, or could propagate to cosmological parameter estimation, thereby impacting the precision and reliability of cosmological models. Current surveys, such as Euclid or Rubin, will provide new weak lensing datasets of very high quality. Accurately quantifying uncertainties in mass maps is therefore critical to perform reliable cosmological parameter inference. In this paper, we extend the conformalized quantile regression (CQR) algorithm, initially proposed for scalar regression, to inverse problems. We compare our approach with another distribution-free approach based on risk-controlling prediction sets (RCPS). Both methods are based on a calibration dataset, and offer finite-sample coverage guarantees that are independent of the data distribution. Furthermore, they are applicable to any mass mapping method, including blackbox predictors. In our experiments, we apply UQ on three mass-mapping method: the Kaiser-Squires inversion, iterative Wiener filtering, and the MCALens algorithm. Our experiments reveal that RCPS tends to produce overconservative confidence bounds with small calibration sets, whereas CQR is designed to avoid this issue. Although the expected miscoverage rate is guaranteed to stay below a user-prescribed threshold regardless of the mass mapping method, selecting an appropriate reconstruction algorithm remains crucial for obtaining accurate estimates, especially around peak-like structures, which are particularly important for inferring cosmological parameters. Additionally, the choice of mass mapping method influences the size of the error bars.

### Unveiling Molecular Secrets: An LLM-Augmented Linear Model for   Explainable and Calibratable Molecular Property Prediction
**Authors**: Zhuoran Li, Xu Sun, Wanyu Lin, Jiannong Cao

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T14:07:57Z

**Summary**: Explainable molecular property prediction is essential for various scientific fields, such as drug discovery and material science. Despite delivering intrinsic explainability, linear models struggle with capturing complex, non-linear patterns. Large language models (LLMs), on the other hand, yield accurate predictions through powerful inference capabilities yet fail to provide chemically meaningful explanations for their predictions. This work proposes a novel framework, called MoleX, which leverages LLM knowledge to build a simple yet powerful linear model for accurate molecular property prediction with faithful explanations. The core of MoleX is to model complicated molecular structure-property relationships using a simple linear model, augmented by LLM knowledge and a crafted calibration strategy. Specifically, to extract the maximum amount of task-relevant knowledge from LLM embeddings, we employ information bottleneck-inspired fine-tuning and sparsity-inducing dimensionality reduction. These informative embeddings are then used to fit a linear model for explainable inference. Moreover, we introduce residual calibration to address prediction errors stemming from linear models' insufficient expressiveness of complex LLM embeddings, thus recovering the LLM's predictive power and boosting overall accuracy. Theoretically, we provide a mathematical foundation to justify MoleX's explainability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoleX outperforms existing methods in molecular property prediction, establishing a new milestone in predictive performance, explainability, and efficiency. In particular, MoleX enables CPU inference and accelerates large-scale dataset processing, achieving comparable performance 300x faster with 100,000 fewer parameters than LLMs. Additionally, the calibration improves model performance by up to 12.7% without compromising explainability.

### Towards virtual painting recolouring using Vision Transformer on X-Ray   Fluorescence datacubes
**Authors**: Alessandro Bombini, Fernando Garc√≠a-Avello Bof√≠as, Francesca Giambi, Chiara Ruberto

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T14:05:28Z

**Summary**: In this contribution, we define (and test) a pipeline to perform virtual painting recolouring using raw data of X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) analysis on pictorial artworks. To circumvent the small dataset size, we generate a synthetic dataset, starting from a database of XRF spectra; furthermore, to ensure a better generalisation capacity (and to tackle the issue of in-memory size and inference time), we define a Deep Variational Embedding network to embed the XRF spectra into a lower dimensional, K-Means friendly, metric space.   We thus train a set of models to assign coloured images to embedded XRF images. We report here the devised pipeline performances in terms of visual quality metrics, and we close on a discussion on the results.

### Retriever-and-Memory: Towards Adaptive Note-Enhanced Retrieval-Augmented   Generation
**Authors**: Ruobing Wang, Daren Zha, Shi Yu, Qingfei Zhao, Yuxuan Chen, Yixuan Wang, Shuo Wang, Yukun Yan, Zhenghao Liu, Xu Han, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T14:03:29Z

**Summary**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates issues of the factual errors and hallucinated outputs generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) in open-domain question-answering tasks (OpenQA) via introducing external knowledge. For complex QA, however, existing RAG methods use LLMs to actively predict retrieval timing and directly use the retrieved information for generation, regardless of whether the retrieval timing accurately reflects the actual information needs, or sufficiently considers prior retrieved knowledge, which may result in insufficient information gathering and interaction, yielding low-quality answers. To address these, we propose a generic RAG approach called Adaptive Note-Enhanced RAG (Adaptive-Note) for complex QA tasks, which includes the iterative information collector, adaptive memory reviewer, and task-oriented generator, while following a new Retriever-and-Memory paradigm. Specifically, Adaptive-Note introduces an overarching view of knowledge growth, iteratively gathering new information in the form of notes and updating them into the existing optimal knowledge structure, enhancing high-quality knowledge interactions. In addition, we employ an adaptive, note-based stop-exploration strategy to decide "what to retrieve and when to stop" to encourage sufficient knowledge exploration. We conduct extensive experiments on five complex QA datasets, and the results demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our method and its components. The code and data are at https://github.com/thunlp/Adaptive-Note.

### Which Demographics do LLMs Default to During Annotation?

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T14:02:42Z

**Summary**: Demographics and cultural background of annotators influence the labels they assign in text annotation -- for instance, an elderly woman might find it offensive to read a message addressed to a "bro", but a male teenager might find it appropriate. It is therefore important to acknowledge label variations to not under-represent members of a society. Two research directions developed out of this observation in the context of using large language models (LLM) for data annotations, namely (1) studying biases and inherent knowledge of LLMs and (2) injecting diversity in the output by manipulating the prompt with demographic information. We combine these two strands of research and ask the question to which demographics an LLM resorts to when no demographics is given. To answer this question, we evaluate which attributes of human annotators LLMs inherently mimic. Furthermore, we compare non-demographic conditioned prompts and placebo-conditioned prompts (e.g., "you are an annotator who lives in house number 5") to demographics-conditioned prompts ("You are a 45 year old man and an expert on politeness annotation. How do you rate {instance}"). We study these questions for politeness and offensiveness annotations on the POPQUORN data set, a corpus created in a controlled manner to investigate human label variations based on demographics which has not been used for LLM-based analyses so far. We observe notable influences related to gender, race, and age in demographic prompting, which contrasts with previous studies that found no such effects.

### StructRAG: Boosting Knowledge Intensive Reasoning of LLMs via   Inference-time Hybrid Information Structurization
**Authors**: Zhuoqun Li, Xuanang Chen, Haiyang Yu, Hongyu Lin, Yaojie Lu, Qiaoyu Tang, Fei Huang, Xianpei Han, Le Sun, Yongbin Li

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T13:52:44Z

**Summary**: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a key means to effectively enhance large language models (LLMs) in many knowledge-based tasks. However, existing RAG methods struggle with knowledge-intensive reasoning tasks, because useful information required to these tasks are badly scattered. This characteristic makes it difficult for existing RAG methods to accurately identify key information and perform global reasoning with such noisy augmentation. In this paper, motivated by the cognitive theories that humans convert raw information into various structured knowledge when tackling knowledge-intensive reasoning, we proposes a new framework, StructRAG, which can identify the optimal structure type for the task at hand, reconstruct original documents into this structured format, and infer answers based on the resulting structure. Extensive experiments across various knowledge-intensive tasks show that StructRAG achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly excelling in challenging scenarios, demonstrating its potential as an effective solution for enhancing LLMs in complex real-world applications.

### PoisonBench: Assessing Large Language Model Vulnerability to Data   Poisoning
**Authors**: Tingchen Fu, Mrinank Sharma, Philip Torr, Shay B. Cohen, David Krueger, Fazl Barez

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T13:50:50Z

**Summary**: Preference learning is a central component for aligning current LLMs, but this process can be vulnerable to data poisoning attacks. To address this concern, we introduce PoisonBench, a benchmark for evaluating large language models' susceptibility to data poisoning during preference learning. Data poisoning attacks can manipulate large language model responses to include hidden malicious content or biases, potentially causing the model to generate harmful or unintended outputs while appearing to function normally. We deploy two distinct attack types across eight realistic scenarios, assessing 21 widely-used models. Our findings reveal concerning trends: (1) Scaling up parameter size does not inherently enhance resilience against poisoning attacks; (2) There exists a log-linear relationship between the effects of the attack and the data poison ratio; (3) The effect of data poisoning can generalize to extrapolated triggers that are not included in the poisoned data. These results expose weaknesses in current preference learning techniques, highlighting the urgent need for more robust defenses against malicious models and data manipulation.

### Tally: Non-Intrusive Performance Isolation for Concurrent Deep Learning   Workloads
**Authors**: Wei Zhao, Anand Jayarajan, Gennady Pekhimenko

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T13:49:16Z

**Summary**: GPU underutilization is a significant concern in many production deep learning clusters, leading to prolonged job queues and increased operational expenses. A promising solution to this inefficiency is GPU sharing, which improves resource utilization by allowing multiple workloads to execute concurrently on a single GPU. However, the practical deployment of GPU sharing in production settings faces critical obstacles due to the limitations of existing mechanisms, such as high integration costs, inadequate performance isolation, and limited application compatibility. To address these issues, we introduce \emph{Tally}, a non-intrusive GPU sharing mechanism that provides robust performance isolation and comprehensive workload compatibility. Tally operates as a virtualization layer between applications and GPUs, transparently orchestrating the device execution of concurrent workloads. The key to Tally's robust performance isolation capability lies in its fine-grained thread-block level GPU kernel scheduling strategy, which allows the system to effectively mitigate interference caused by workload co-execution. Our evaluation, conducted on a diverse set of workload combinations, demonstrates that Tally on average incurs a mere $7.2\%$ overhead on the $99^{th}$-percentile latency of high-priority inference tasks when executed concurrently with best-effort training workloads compared to $188.9\%$ overhead exhibited by the state-of-the-art GPU sharing systems like TGS, while achieving over $80\%$ of TGS's system throughput.

### Don't Transform the Code, Code the Transforms: Towards Precise Code   Rewriting using LLMs
**Authors**: Chris Cummins, Volker Seeker, Jordi Armengol-Estap√©, Aram H. Markosyan, Gabriel Synnaeve, Hugh Leather

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T13:45:16Z

**Summary**: Tools for rewriting, refactoring and optimizing code should be fast and correct. Large language models (LLMs), by their nature, possess neither of these qualities. Yet, there remains tremendous opportunity in using LLMs to improve code.   We explore the use of LLMs not to transform code, but to code transforms. We propose a chain-of-thought approach to synthesizing code transformations from a small number of input/output code examples that incorporates execution and feedback. Unlike the direct rewrite approach, LLM-generated transformations are easy to inspect, debug, and validate. The logic of the rewrite is explicitly coded and easy to adapt. The compute required to run code transformations is minute compared to that of LLM rewriting.   We test our approach on 16 Python code transformations and find that LLM- generated transforms are perfectly precise for 7 of them and less imprecise than direct LLM rewriting on the others. We hope to encourage further research to improving the precision of LLM code rewriting.

### Learn Your Reference Model for Real Good Alignment
**Authors**: Alexey Gorbatovski, Boris Shaposhnikov, Alexey Malakhov, Nikita Surnachev, Yaroslav Aksenov, Ian Maksimov, Nikita Balagansky, Daniil Gavrilov

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T13:42:12Z

**Summary**: Despite the fact that offline methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) alignment do not require a direct reward model, they remain susceptible to overoptimization. This issue arises when the trained model deviates excessively from the reference policy, leading to a decrease in sample quality. We propose a new paradigm of offline alignment methods, called Trust Region (including variants TR-DPO, TR-IPO, TR-KTO), which dynamically updates the reference policy throughout the training process. Our results show that TR alignment methods effectively mitigate overoptimization, enabling models to maintain strong performance even when substantially deviating from the initial reference policy. We demonstrate the efficacy of these approaches not only through toy examples that exhibit reduced overoptimization, but also through direct, side-by-side comparisons in specific tasks such as helpful and harmless dialogue, as well as summarization, where they surpass conventional methods. Additionally, we report significant improvements in general-purpose assistant setups with the Llama3 model on the AlpacaEval 2 and Arena-Hard benchmarks, highlighting the advantages of Trust Region methods over classical approaches.

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T13:34:24Z

**Summary**: This paper presents a comprehensive overview of the data preparation pipeline developed for the OpenGPT-X project, a large-scale initiative aimed at creating open and high-performance multilingual large language models (LLMs). The project goal is to deliver models that cover all major European languages, with a particular focus on real-world applications within the European Union. We explain all data processing steps, starting with the data selection and requirement definition to the preparation of the final datasets for model training. We distinguish between curated data and web data, as each of these categories is handled by distinct pipelines, with curated data undergoing minimal filtering and web data requiring extensive filtering and deduplication. This distinction guided the development of specialized algorithmic solutions for both pipelines. In addition to describing the processing methodologies, we provide an in-depth analysis of the datasets, increasing transparency and alignment with European data regulations. Finally, we share key insights and challenges faced during the project, offering recommendations for future endeavors in large-scale multilingual data preparation for LLMs.

### Designing a Classifier for Active Fire Detection from Multispectral   Satellite Imagery Using Neural Architecture Search
**Authors**: Amber Cassimon, Phil Reiter, Siegfried Mercelis, Kevin Mets

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T13:32:32Z

**Summary**: This paper showcases the use of a reinforcement learning-based Neural Architecture Search (NAS) agent to design a small neural network to perform active fire detection on multispectral satellite imagery. Specifically, we aim to design a neural network that can determine if a single multispectral pixel is a part of a fire, and do so within the constraints of a Low Earth Orbit (LEO) nanosatellite with a limited power budget, to facilitate on-board processing of sensor data. In order to use reinforcement learning, a reward function is needed. We supply this reward function in the shape of a regression model that predicts the F1 score obtained by a particular architecture, following quantization to INT8 precision, from purely architectural features. This model is trained by collecting a random sample of neural network architectures, training these architectures, and collecting their classification performance statistics. Besides the F1 score, we also include the total number of trainable parameters in our reward function to limit the size of the designed model and ensure it fits within the resource constraints imposed by nanosatellite platforms. Finally, we deployed the best neural network to the Google Coral Micro Dev Board and evaluated its inference latency and power consumption. This neural network consists of 1,716 trainable parameters, takes on average 984{\mu}s to inference, and consumes around 800mW to perform inference. These results show that our reinforcement learning-based NAS approach can be successfully applied to novel problems not tackled before.

### Superpipeline: A Universal Approach for Reducing GPU Memory Usage in   Large Models
**Authors**: Reza Abbasi, Sernam Lim

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T13:17:05Z

**Summary**: The rapid growth in machine learning models, especially in natural language processing and computer vision, has led to challenges when running these models on hardware with limited resources. This paper introduces Superpipeline, a new framework designed to optimize the execution of large AI models on constrained hardware during both training and inference. Our approach involves dynamically managing model execution by dividing models into individual layers and efficiently transferring these layers between GPU and CPU memory. Superpipeline reduces GPU memory usage by up to 60% in our experiments while maintaining model accuracy and acceptable processing speeds. This allows models that would otherwise exceed available GPU memory to run effectively. Unlike existing solutions that focus mainly on inference or specific model types, Superpipeline can be applied to large language models (LLMs), vision-language models (VLMs), and vision-based models. We tested Superpipeline's performance across various models and hardware setups. The method includes two key parameters that allow fine-tuning the balance between GPU memory use and processing speed. Importantly, Superpipeline does not require retraining or changing model parameters, ensuring that the original model's output remains unchanged. Superpipeline's simplicity and flexibility make it useful for researchers and professionals working with advanced AI models on limited hardware. It enables the use of larger models or bigger batch sizes on existing hardware, potentially speeding up innovation across many machine learning applications. This work marks an important step toward making advanced AI models more accessible and optimizing their deployment in resource-limited environments. The code for Superpipeline is available at https://github.com/abbasiReza/super-pipeline.

### F2A: An Innovative Approach for Prompt Injection by Utilizing Feign   Security Detection Agents
**Authors**: Yupeng Ren

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T12:49:05Z

**Summary**: With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), numerous mature applications of LLMs have emerged in the field of content safety detection. However, we have found that LLMs exhibit blind trust in safety detection agents. The general LLMs can be compromised by hackers with this vulnerability. Hence, this paper proposed an attack named Feign Agent Attack (F2A).Through such malicious forgery methods, adding fake safety detection results into the prompt, the defense mechanism of LLMs can be bypassed, thereby obtaining harmful content and hijacking the normal conversation.Continually, a series of experiments were conducted. In these experiments, the hijacking capability of F2A on LLMs was analyzed and demonstrated, exploring the fundamental reasons why LLMs blindly trust safety detection results. The experiments involved various scenarios where fake safety detection results were injected into prompts, and the responses were closely monitored to understand the extent of the vulnerability. Also, this paper provided a reasonable solution to this attack, emphasizing that it is important for LLMs to critically evaluate the results of augmented agents to prevent the generating harmful content. By doing so, the reliability and security can be significantly improved, protecting the LLMs from F2A.

### KnobGen: Controlling the Sophistication of Artwork in Sketch-Based   Diffusion Models
**Authors**: Pouyan Navard, Amin Karimi Monsefi, Mengxi Zhou, Wei-Lun Chao, Alper Yilmaz, Rajiv Ramnath

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T12:47:48Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in diffusion models have significantly improved text-to-image (T2I) generation, but they often struggle to balance fine-grained precision with high-level control. Methods like ControlNet and T2I-Adapter excel at following sketches by seasoned artists but tend to be overly rigid, replicating unintentional flaws in sketches from novice users. Meanwhile, coarse-grained methods, such as sketch-based abstraction frameworks, offer more accessible input handling but lack the precise control needed for detailed, professional use. To address these limitations, we propose KnobGen, a dual-pathway framework that democratizes sketch-based image generation by seamlessly adapting to varying levels of sketch complexity and user skill. KnobGen uses a Coarse-Grained Controller (CGC) module for high-level semantics and a Fine-Grained Controller (FGC) module for detailed refinement. The relative strength of these two modules can be adjusted through our knob inference mechanism to align with the user's specific needs. These mechanisms ensure that KnobGen can flexibly generate images from both novice sketches and those drawn by seasoned artists. This maintains control over the final output while preserving the natural appearance of the image, as evidenced on the MultiGen-20M dataset and a newly collected sketch dataset.

### OAEI-LLM: A Benchmark Dataset for Understanding Large Language Model   Hallucinations in Ontology Matching
**Authors**: Zhangcheng Qiang, Kerry Taylor, Weiqing Wang, Jing Jiang

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T12:40:50Z

**Summary**: Hallucinations of large language models (LLMs) commonly occur in domain-specific downstream tasks, with no exception in ontology matching (OM). The prevalence of using LLMs for OM raises the need for benchmarks to better understand LLM hallucinations. The OAEI-LLM dataset is an extended version of the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI) datasets that evaluate LLM-specific hallucinations in OM tasks. We outline the methodology used in dataset construction and schema extension, and provide examples of potential use cases.

### Measuring the Groundedness of Legal Question-Answering Systems
**Authors**: Dietrich Trautmann, Natalia Ostapuk, Quentin Grail, Adrian Alan Pol, Guglielmo Bonifazi, Shang Gao, Martin Gajek

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T12:23:45Z

**Summary**: In high-stakes domains like legal question-answering, the accuracy and trustworthiness of generative AI systems are of paramount importance. This work presents a comprehensive benchmark of various methods to assess the groundedness of AI-generated responses, aiming to significantly enhance their reliability. Our experiments include similarity-based metrics and natural language inference models to evaluate whether responses are well-founded in the given contexts. We also explore different prompting strategies for large language models to improve the detection of ungrounded responses. We validated the effectiveness of these methods using a newly created grounding classification corpus, designed specifically for legal queries and corresponding responses from retrieval-augmented prompting, focusing on their alignment with source material. Our results indicate potential in groundedness classification of generated responses, with the best method achieving a macro-F1 score of 0.8. Additionally, we evaluated the methods in terms of their latency to determine their suitability for real-world applications, as this step typically follows the generation process. This capability is essential for processes that may trigger additional manual verification or automated response regeneration. In summary, this study demonstrates the potential of various detection methods to improve the trustworthiness of generative AI in legal settings.

### Federated Instruction Tuning of LLMs with Domain Coverage Augmentation
**Authors**: Zezhou Wang, Yaxin Du, Zhuzhong Qian, Siheng Chen

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T12:19:57Z

**Summary**: Federated Domain-specific Instruction Tuning (FedDIT) utilizes limited cross-client private data together with server-side public data for instruction augmentation, ultimately boosting model performance within specific domains. To date, the factors affecting FedDIT remain unclear, and existing instruction augmentation methods primarily focus on the centralized setting without considering distributed environments. Our experiments reveal that the cross-client domain coverage, rather than data heterogeneity, drives model performance in FedDIT. In response, we propose FedDCA, which optimizes domain coverage through greedy client center selection and retrieval-based augmentation. For client-side computational efficiency and system scalability, FedDCA$^*$, the variant of FedDCA, utilizes heterogeneous encoders with server-side feature alignment. Extensive experiments across four distinct domains (code, medical, financial, and mathematical) substantiate the effectiveness of both methods. Additionally, we investigate privacy preservation against memory extraction attacks utilizing various amounts of public data. Results show that there is no significant correlation between the volume of public data and the privacy-preserving capability. However, as the fine-tuning rounds increase, the risk of privacy leakage reduces or converges.

### PILLAR: an AI-Powered Privacy Threat Modeling Tool
**Authors**: Majid Mollaeefar, Andrea Bissoli, Silvio Ranise

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T12:13:03Z

**Summary**: The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has unlocked new possibilities for applying artificial intelligence across a wide range of fields, including privacy engineering. As modern applications increasingly handle sensitive user data, safeguarding privacy has become more critical than ever. To protect privacy effectively, potential threats need to be identified and addressed early in the system development process. Frameworks like LINDDUN offer structured approaches for uncovering these risks, but despite their value, they often demand substantial manual effort, expert input, and detailed system knowledge. This makes the process time-consuming and prone to errors. Current privacy threat modeling methods, such as LINDDUN, typically rely on creating and analyzing complex data flow diagrams (DFDs) and system descriptions to pinpoint potential privacy issues. While these approaches are thorough, they can be cumbersome, relying heavily on the precision of the data provided by users. Moreover, they often generate a long list of threats without clear guidance on how to prioritize them, leaving developers unsure of where to focus their efforts. In response to these challenges, we introduce PILLAR (Privacy risk Identification with LINDDUN and LLM Analysis Report), a new tool that integrates LLMs with the LINDDUN framework to streamline and enhance privacy threat modeling. PILLAR automates key parts of the LINDDUN process, such as generating DFDs, classifying threats, and prioritizing risks. By leveraging the capabilities of LLMs, PILLAR can take natural language descriptions of systems and transform them into comprehensive threat models with minimal input from users, reducing the workload on developers and privacy experts while improving the efficiency and accuracy of the process.

### Auditing Differential Privacy Guarantees Using Density Estimation
**Authors**: Antti Koskela, Jafar Mohammadi

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T12:06:32Z

**Summary**: We present a novel method for accurately auditing the differential privacy (DP) guarantees of DP mechanisms. In particular, our solution is applicable to auditing DP guarantees of machine learning (ML) models. Previous auditing methods tightly capture the privacy guarantees of DP-SGD trained models in the white-box setting where the auditor has access to all intermediate models; however, the success of these methods depends on a priori information about the parametric form of the noise and the subsampling ratio used for sampling the gradients. We present a method that does not require such information and is agnostic to the randomization used for the underlying mechanism. Similarly to several previous DP auditing methods, we assume that the auditor has access to a set of independent observations from two one-dimensional distributions corresponding to outputs from two neighbouring datasets. Furthermore, our solution is based on a simple histogram-based density estimation technique to find lower bounds for the statistical distance between these distributions when measured using the hockey-stick divergence. We show that our approach also naturally generalizes the previously considered class of threshold membership inference auditing methods. We improve upon accurate auditing methods such as the $f$-DP auditing. Moreover, we address an open problem on how to accurately audit the subsampled Gaussian mechanism without any knowledge of the parameters of the underlying mechanism.

### EmoDynamiX: Emotional Support Dialogue Strategy Prediction by Modelling   MiXed Emotions and Discourse Dynamics
**Authors**: Chenwei Wan, Matthieu Labeau, Chlo√© Clavel

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T12:04:11Z

**Summary**: Designing emotionally intelligent conversational systems to provide comfort and advice to people experiencing distress is a compelling area of research. Recently, with advancements in large language models (LLMs), end-to-end dialogue agents without explicit strategy prediction steps have become prevalent. However, implicit strategy planning lacks transparency, and recent studies show that LLMs' inherent preference bias towards certain socio-emotional strategies hinders the delivery of high-quality emotional support. To address this challenge, we propose decoupling strategy prediction from language generation, and introduce a novel dialogue strategy prediction framework, EmoDynamiX, which models the discourse dynamics between user fine-grained emotions and system strategies using a heterogeneous graph for better performance and transparency. Experimental results on two ESC datasets show EmoDynamiX outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods with a significant margin (better proficiency and lower preference bias). Our approach also exhibits better transparency by allowing backtracing of decision making.

### Hespi: A pipeline for automatically detecting information from hebarium   specimen sheets
**Authors**: Robert Turnbull, Emily Fitzgerald, Karen Thompson, Joanne L. Birch

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T11:59:40Z

**Summary**: Specimen associated biodiversity data are sought after for biological, environmental, climate, and conservation sciences. A rate shift is required for the extraction of data from specimen images to eliminate the bottleneck that the reliance on human-mediated transcription of these data represents. We applied advanced computer vision techniques to develop the `Hespi' (HErbarium Specimen sheet PIpeline), which extracts a pre-catalogue subset of collection data on the institutional labels on herbarium specimens from their digital images. The pipeline integrates two object detection models; the first detects bounding boxes around text-based labels and the second detects bounding boxes around text-based data fields on the primary institutional label. The pipeline classifies text-based institutional labels as printed, typed, handwritten, or a combination and applies Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) for data extraction. The recognized text is then corrected against authoritative databases of taxon names. The extracted text is also corrected with the aide of a multimodal Large Language Model (LLM). Hespi accurately detects and extracts text for test datasets including specimen sheet images from international herbaria. The components of the pipeline are modular and users can train their own models with their own data and use them in place of the models provided.

### Verification and Refinement of Natural Language Explanations through   LLM-Symbolic Theorem Proving
**Authors**: Xin Quan, Marco Valentino, Louise A. Dennis, Andr√© Freitas

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T11:54:35Z

**Summary**: Natural language explanations represent a proxy for evaluating explanation-based and multi-step Natural Language Inference (NLI) models. However, assessing the validity of explanations for NLI is challenging as it typically involves the crowd-sourcing of apposite datasets, a process that is time-consuming and prone to logical errors. To address existing limitations, this paper investigates the verification and refinement of natural language explanations through the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Theorem Provers (TPs). Specifically, we present a neuro-symbolic framework, named Explanation-Refiner, that integrates TPs with LLMs to generate and formalise explanatory sentences and suggest potential inference strategies for NLI. In turn, the TP is employed to provide formal guarantees on the logical validity of the explanations and to generate feedback for subsequent improvements. We demonstrate how Explanation-Refiner can be jointly used to evaluate explanatory reasoning, autoformalisation, and error correction mechanisms of state-of-the-art LLMs as well as to automatically enhance the quality of explanations of variable complexity in different domains.

### Developing a Pragmatic Benchmark for Assessing Korean Legal Language   Understanding in Large Language Models
**Authors**: Yeeun Kim, Young Rok Choi, Eunkyung Choi, Jinhwan Choi, Hai Jin Park, Wonseok Hwang

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T11:41:02Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in the legal domain, with GPT-4 even passing the Uniform Bar Exam in the U.S. However their efficacy remains limited for non-standardized tasks and tasks in languages other than English. This underscores the need for careful evaluation of LLMs within each legal system before application. Here, we introduce KBL, a benchmark for assessing the Korean legal language understanding of LLMs, consisting of (1) 7 legal knowledge tasks (510 examples), (2) 4 legal reasoning tasks (288 examples), and (3) the Korean bar exam (4 domains, 53 tasks, 2,510 examples). First two datasets were developed in close collaboration with lawyers to evaluate LLMs in practical scenarios in a certified manner. Furthermore, considering legal practitioners' frequent use of extensive legal documents for research, we assess LLMs in both a closed book setting, where they rely solely on internal knowledge, and a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) setting, using a corpus of Korean statutes and precedents. The results indicate substantial room and opportunities for improvement.

### Ant Colony Sampling with GFlowNets for Combinatorial Optimization
**Authors**: Minsu Kim, Sanghyeok Choi, Hyeonah Kim, Jiwoo Son, Jinkyoo Park, Yoshua Bengio

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T11:36:39Z

**Summary**: We present the Generative Flow Ant Colony Sampler (GFACS), a novel meta-heuristic method that hierarchically combines amortized inference and parallel stochastic search. Our method first leverages Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) to amortize a multi-modal prior distribution over combinatorial solution space that encompasses both high-reward and diversified solutions. This prior is iteratively updated via parallel stochastic search in the spirit of Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), leading to the posterior distribution that generates near-optimal solutions. Extensive experiments across seven combinatorial optimization problems demonstrate GFACS's promising performances.

### Beyond Prompts: Dynamic Conversational Benchmarking of Large Language   Models
**Authors**: David Castillo-Bolado, Joseph Davidson, Finlay Gray, Marek Rosa

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T11:32:16Z

**Summary**: We introduce a dynamic benchmarking system for conversational agents that evaluates their performance through a single, simulated, and lengthy user$\leftrightarrow$agent interaction. The interaction is a conversation between the user and agent, where multiple tasks are introduced and then undertaken concurrently. We context switch regularly to interleave the tasks, which constructs a realistic testing scenario in which we assess the Long-Term Memory, Continual Learning, and Information Integration capabilities of the agents. Results from both proprietary and open-source Large-Language Models show that LLMs in general perform well on single-task interactions, but they struggle on the same tasks when they are interleaved. Notably, short-context LLMs supplemented with an LTM system perform as well as or better than those with larger contexts. Our benchmark suggests that there are other challenges for LLMs responding to more natural interactions that contemporary benchmarks have heretofore not been able to capture.

### Investigating Human-Computer Interaction and Visual Comprehension in   Text Generation Process of Natural Language Generation Models
**Authors**: Yunchao Wang, Zihang Fu, Chaoqing Xu, Guodao Sun, Ronghua Liang

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T11:23:26Z

**Summary**: Natural language generation (NLG) models are becoming a highly sought-after research focus in the field of natural language processing (NLP), demonstrating strong capabilities in text generation tasks such as writing and dialogue generation. Despite the impressive performance of NLG models, their complex architecture and extensive model weights result in a lack of interpretability. This limitation hampers their adoption in many critical decision-making scenarios. Fortunately, the intervention of human-computer interaction and visual comprehension provides users with the possibility of opening the "black box". In this paper, we conduct a investigation addressing the roles and limitations of human-computer interactive and visual comprehension in text generation process of NLG models. We present a taxonomy of interaction methods and visualization techniques, providing a structured overview of the three main research subjects and their corresponding six tasks within the application process of large language models (LLMs). Finally, we summarize the shortcomings in the existing work and investigate the key challenges and emerging opportunities in the era of LLMs.

### On-Chip Learning via Transformer In-Context Learning
**Authors**: Jan Finkbeiner, Emre Neftci

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T10:54:09Z

**Summary**: Autoregressive decoder-only transformers have become key components for scalable sequence processing and generation models. However, the transformer's self-attention mechanism requires transferring prior token projections from the main memory at each time step (token), thus severely limiting their performance on conventional processors. Self-attention can be viewed as a dynamic feed-forward layer, whose matrix is input sequence-dependent similarly to the result of local synaptic plasticity. Using this insight, we present a neuromorphic decoder-only transformer model that utilizes an on-chip plasticity processor to compute self-attention. Interestingly, the training of transformers enables them to ``learn'' the input context during inference. We demonstrate this in-context learning ability of transformers on the Loihi 2 processor by solving a few-shot classification problem. With this we emphasize the importance of pretrained models especially their ability to find simple, local, backpropagation free, learning rules enabling on-chip learning and adaptation in a hardware friendly manner.

### Preferential Normalizing Flows
**Authors**: Petrus Mikkola, Luigi Acerbi, Arto Klami

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T10:53:38Z

**Summary**: Eliciting a high-dimensional probability distribution from an expert via noisy judgments is notoriously challenging, yet useful for many applications, such as prior elicitation and reward modeling. We introduce a method for eliciting the expert's belief density as a normalizing flow based solely on preferential questions such as comparing or ranking alternatives. This allows eliciting in principle arbitrarily flexible densities, but flow estimation is susceptible to the challenge of collapsing or diverging probability mass that makes it difficult in practice. We tackle this problem by introducing a novel functional prior for the flow, motivated by a decision-theoretic argument, and show empirically that the belief density can be inferred as the function-space maximum a posteriori estimate. We demonstrate our method by eliciting multivariate belief densities of simulated experts, including the prior belief of a general-purpose large language model over a real-world dataset.

### Koopman correlations underlie linear response and causality
**Authors**: Gabriele Di Antonio, Gianni Valerio Vinci

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T10:53:00Z

**Summary**: The inference of causal relationships among observed variables is a pivotal, longstanding problem in the scientific community. An intuitive method for quantifying these causal links involves examining the response of one variable to perturbations in another. The fluctuation-dissipation theorem elegantly connects this response to the correlation functions of the unperturbed system, thereby bridging the concepts of causality and correlation. However, this relationship becomes intricate in nonlinear systems, where knowledge of the invariant measure is required but elusive, especially in high-dimensional spaces. In this study, we establish a novel link between the Koopman operator of nonlinear stochastic systems and the response function. This connection provides an alternative method for computing the response function using generalized correlation functions, even when the invariant measure is unknown. We validate our theoretical framework by applying it to a nonlinear high-dimensional system amenable to exact solutions, demonstrating convergence and consistency with established results. Finally, we discuss a significant interplay between the resulting causal network and the relevant time scales of the system.

### Goal-Oriented Communications for Real-time Inference with Two-Way Delay
**Authors**: Cagri Ari, Md Kamran Chowdhury Shisher, Yin Sun, Elif Uysal

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T10:48:51Z

**Summary**: We design a goal-oriented communication strategy for remote inference, where an intelligent model (e.g., a pre-trained neural network) at the receiver side predicts the real-time value of a target signal based on data packets transmitted from a remote location. The inference error depends on both the Age of Information (AoI) and the length of the data packets. Previous formulations of this problem either assumed IID transmission delays with immediate feedback or focused only on monotonic relations where inference performance degrades as the input data ages. In contrast, we consider a possibly non-monotonic relationship between the inference error and AoI. We show how to minimize the expected time-average inference error under two-way delay, where the delay process can have memory. Simulation results highlight the significant benefits of adopting such a goal-oriented communication strategy for remote inference, especially under highly variable delay scenarios.

### Adapting Large Language Models for Document-Level Machine Translation
**Authors**: Minghao Wu, Thuy-Trang Vu, Lizhen Qu, George Foster, Gholamreza Haffari

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T10:48:15Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Recent research indicates that moderately-sized LLMs often outperform larger ones after task-specific fine-tuning. This study focuses on adapting LLMs for document-level machine translation (DocMT) for specific language pairs. We first investigate the impact of prompt strategies on translation performance and then conduct extensive experiments using two fine-tuning methods, three LLM backbones, and 18 translation tasks across nine language pairs. Our results show that specialized models can sometimes surpass GPT-4 in translation performance but still face issues like off-target translation due to error propagation in decoding. We provide an in-depth analysis of these LLMs tailored for DocMT, examining translation errors, discourse phenomena, strategies for training and inference, the data efficiency of parallel documents, recent test set evaluations, and zero-shot crosslingual transfer. Our findings highlight the strengths and limitations of LLM-based DocMT models and provide a foundation for future research.

### SocialGaze: Improving the Integration of Human Social Norms in Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Anvesh Rao Vijjini, Rakesh R. Menon, Jiayi Fu, Shashank Srivastava, Snigdha Chaturvedi

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T10:35:58Z

**Summary**: While much research has explored enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in the last few years, there is a gap in understanding the alignment of these models with social values and norms. We introduce the task of judging social acceptance. Social acceptance requires models to judge and rationalize the acceptability of people's actions in social situations. For example, is it socially acceptable for a neighbor to ask others in the community to keep their pets indoors at night? We find that LLMs' understanding of social acceptance is often misaligned with human consensus. To alleviate this, we introduce SocialGaze, a multi-step prompting framework, in which a language model verbalizes a social situation from multiple perspectives before forming a judgment. Our experiments demonstrate that the SocialGaze approach improves the alignment with human judgments by up to 11 F1 points with the GPT-3.5 model. We also identify biases and correlations in LLMs in assigning blame that is related to features such as the gender (males are significantly more likely to be judged unfairly) and age (LLMs are more aligned with humans for older narrators).

**Authors**: Sheng Yang, Yurong Wu, Yan Gao, Zineng Zhou, Bin Benjamin Zhu, Xiaodi Sun, Jian-Guang Lou, Zhiming Ding, Anbang Hu, Yuan Fang, Yunsong Li, Junyan Chen, Linjun Yang

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T10:34:28Z

**Summary**: Prompt engineering is very important to enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs). When dealing with complex issues, prompt engineers tend to distill multiple patterns from examples and inject relevant solutions to optimize the prompts, achieving satisfying results. However, existing automatic prompt optimization techniques are only limited to producing single flow instructions, struggling with handling diverse patterns. In this paper, we present AMPO, an automatic prompt optimization method that can iteratively develop a multi-branched prompt using failure cases as feedback. Our goal is to explore a novel way of structuring prompts with multi-branches to better handle multiple patterns in complex tasks, for which we introduce three modules: Pattern Recognition, Branch Adjustment, and Branch Pruning. In experiments across five tasks, AMPO consistently achieves the best results. Additionally, our approach demonstrates significant optimization efficiency due to our adoption of a minimal search strategy.

### JavaBench: A Benchmark of Object-Oriented Code Generation for Evaluating   Large Language Models
**Authors**: Jialun Cao, Zhiyong Chen, Jiarong Wu, Shing-chi Cheung, Chang Xu

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T10:27:16Z

**Summary**: Code generation benchmarks such as HumanEval are widely adopted to evaluate LLMs' capabilities. However, after consolidating the latest 24 benchmarks, we noticed three significant imbalances. First, imbalanced programming language. 95.8% of benchmarks involve Python, while only 5 benchmarks involve Java. Second, imbalanced code granularity. Function-/statement-level benchmarks account for over 83.3% of benchmarks. Only a mere handful extends to class-/project-levels, and all are limited to Python. Third, lacking advanced features. Existing benchmarks primarily assess basic coding skills, while overlooking advanced Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) features (i.e., encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism).   To fill these gaps, we propose JavaBench, a project-level Java benchmark that exercises OOP features. It comprises four Java projects with 389 methods in 106 Java classes. The test coverage is up to 92%, and JavaBench is attested by 282 undergraduate students, reaching a 90.93/100 average score (i.e., pass rate against the test suite), ensuring the quality of documentation, code skeleton, and tests. To better evaluate LLM's capability against JavaBench, we introduce a systematic evaluation design covering three context settings and five synthesis strategies at two granularities using three hierarchical metrics. Our extensive experiment yields several interesting findings. First, we noticed that regarding project-level Java programming, LLMs are far behind undergraduate students (no project can be correctly completed by any studied LLMs, and at most 41.17% Pass@5 in a more relaxed evaluation). Second, using method signature as prompt context may strike an ideal balance for project-level code generation. JavaBench is publicly available at https://github.com/java-bench/JavaBench.

 ### Towards Trustworthy LLMs for Code: A Data-Centric Synergistic Auditing   Framework
**Authors**: Chong Wang, Zhenpeng Chen, Tianlin Li, Yilun Zhao, Yang Liu

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T17:59:58Z

**Summary**: LLM-powered coding and development assistants have become prevalent to programmers' workflows. However, concerns about the trustworthiness of LLMs for code persist despite their widespread use. Much of the existing research focused on either training or evaluation, raising questions about whether stakeholders in training and evaluation align in their understanding of model trustworthiness and whether they can move toward a unified direction. In this paper, we propose a vision for a unified trustworthiness auditing framework, DataTrust, which adopts a data-centric approach that synergistically emphasizes both training and evaluation data and their correlations. DataTrust aims to connect model trustworthiness indicators in evaluation with data quality indicators in training. It autonomously inspects training data and evaluates model trustworthiness using synthesized data, attributing potential causes from specific evaluation data to corresponding training data and refining indicator connections. Additionally, a trustworthiness arena powered by DataTrust will engage crowdsourced input and deliver quantitative outcomes. We outline the benefits that various stakeholders can gain from DataTrust and discuss the challenges and opportunities it presents.

### Generative Verifiers: Reward Modeling as Next-Token Prediction
**Authors**: Lunjun Zhang, Arian Hosseini, Hritik Bansal, Mehran Kazemi, Aviral Kumar, Rishabh Agarwal

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T17:59:32Z

**Summary**: Verifiers or reward models are often used to enhance the reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs). A common approach is the Best-of-N method, where N candidate solutions generated by the LLM are ranked by a verifier, and the best one is selected. While LLM-based verifiers are typically trained as discriminative classifiers to score solutions, they do not utilize the text generation capabilities of pretrained LLMs. To overcome this limitation, we instead propose training verifiers using the ubiquitous next-token prediction objective, jointly on verification and solution generation. Compared to standard verifiers, such generative verifiers (GenRM) can benefit from several advantages of LLMs: they integrate seamlessly with instruction tuning, enable chain-of-thought reasoning, and can utilize additional test-time compute via majority voting for better verification. We demonstrate that GenRM outperforms discriminative, DPO verifiers, and LLM-as-a-Judge, resulting in a 16-40% improvement in the number of problems solved with Best-of-N on algorithmic and math reasoning tasks. Furthermore, we find that training GenRM with synthetic verification rationales is sufficient to pick out subtle errors on math problems. Finally, we demonstrate that generative verifiers scale favorably with model size and inference-time compute.

### Unraveling and Mitigating Safety Alignment Degradation of   Vision-Language Models
**Authors**: Qin Liu, Chao Shang, Ling Liu, Nikolaos Pappas, Jie Ma, Neha Anna John, Srikanth Doss, Lluis Marquez, Miguel Ballesteros, Yassine Benajiba

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T17:59:31Z

**Summary**: The safety alignment ability of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) is prone to be degraded by the integration of the vision module compared to its LLM backbone. We investigate this phenomenon, dubbed as ''safety alignment degradation'' in this paper, and show that the challenge arises from the representation gap that emerges when introducing vision modality to VLMs. In particular, we show that the representations of multi-modal inputs shift away from that of text-only inputs which represent the distribution that the LLM backbone is optimized for. At the same time, the safety alignment capabilities, initially developed within the textual embedding space, do not successfully transfer to this new multi-modal representation space. To reduce safety alignment degradation, we introduce Cross-Modality Representation Manipulation (CMRM), an inference time representation intervention method for recovering the safety alignment ability that is inherent in the LLM backbone of VLMs, while simultaneously preserving the functional capabilities of VLMs. The empirical results show that our framework significantly recovers the alignment ability that is inherited from the LLM backbone with minimal impact on the fluency and linguistic capabilities of pre-trained VLMs even without additional training. Specifically, the unsafe rate of LLaVA-7B on multi-modal input can be reduced from 61.53% to as low as 3.15% with only inference-time intervention.   WARNING: This paper contains examples of toxic or harmful language.

### MiRAGeNews: Multimodal Realistic AI-Generated News Detection
**Authors**: Runsheng Huang, Liam Dugan, Yue Yang, Chris Callison-Burch

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T17:58:02Z

**Summary**: The proliferation of inflammatory or misleading "fake" news content has become increasingly common in recent years. Simultaneously, it has become easier than ever to use AI tools to generate photorealistic images depicting any scene imaginable. Combining these two -- AI-generated fake news content -- is particularly potent and dangerous. To combat the spread of AI-generated fake news, we propose the MiRAGeNews Dataset, a dataset of 12,500 high-quality real and AI-generated image-caption pairs from state-of-the-art generators. We find that our dataset poses a significant challenge to humans (60% F-1) and state-of-the-art multi-modal LLMs (< 24% F-1). Using our dataset we train a multi-modal detector (MiRAGe) that improves by +5.1% F-1 over state-of-the-art baselines on image-caption pairs from out-of-domain image generators and news publishers. We release our code and data to aid future work on detecting AI-generated content.

### Transforming In-Vehicle Network Intrusion Detection: VAE-based Knowledge   Distillation Meets Explainable AI
**Authors**: Muhammet Anil Yagiz, Pedram MohajerAnsari, Mert D. Pese, Polat Goktas

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T17:57:16Z

**Summary**: In the evolving landscape of autonomous vehicles, ensuring robust in-vehicle network (IVN) security is paramount. This paper introduces an advanced intrusion detection system (IDS) called KD-XVAE that uses a Variational Autoencoder (VAE)-based knowledge distillation approach to enhance both performance and efficiency. Our model significantly reduces complexity, operating with just 1669 parameters and achieving an inference time of 0.3 ms per batch, making it highly suitable for resource-constrained automotive environments. Evaluations in the HCRL Car-Hacking dataset demonstrate exceptional capabilities, attaining perfect scores (Recall, Precision, F1 Score of 100%, and FNR of 0%) under multiple attack types, including DoS, Fuzzing, Gear Spoofing, and RPM Spoofing. Comparative analysis on the CICIoV2024 dataset further underscores its superiority over traditional machine learning models, achieving perfect detection metrics. We furthermore integrate Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to ensure transparency in the model's decisions. The VAE compresses the original feature space into a latent space, on which the distilled model is trained. SHAP(SHapley Additive exPlanations) values provide insights into the importance of each latent dimension, mapped back to original features for intuitive understanding. Our paper advances the field by integrating state-of-the-art techniques, addressing critical challenges in the deployment of efficient, trustworthy, and reliable IDSes for autonomous vehicles, ensuring enhanced protection against emerging cyber threats.

### AttnGCG: Enhancing Jailbreaking Attacks on LLMs with Attention   Manipulation
**Authors**: Zijun Wang, Haoqin Tu, Jieru Mei, Bingchen Zhao, Yisen Wang, Cihang Xie

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T17:55:09Z

**Summary**: This paper studies the vulnerabilities of transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) to jailbreaking attacks, focusing specifically on the optimization-based Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) strategy. We first observe a positive correlation between the effectiveness of attacks and the internal behaviors of the models. For instance, attacks tend to be less effective when models pay more attention to system prompts designed to ensure LLM safety alignment. Building on this discovery, we introduce an enhanced method that manipulates models' attention scores to facilitate LLM jailbreaking, which we term AttnGCG. Empirically, AttnGCG shows consistent improvements in attack efficacy across diverse LLMs, achieving an average increase of ~7% in the Llama-2 series and ~10% in the Gemma series. Our strategy also demonstrates robust attack transferability against both unseen harmful goals and black-box LLMs like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. Moreover, we note our attention-score visualization is more interpretable, allowing us to gain better insights into how our targeted attention manipulation facilitates more effective jailbreaking. We release the code at https://github.com/UCSC-VLAA/AttnGCG-attack.

### SimpleStrat: Diversifying Language Model Generation with Stratification
**Authors**: Justin Wong, Yury Orlovskiy, Michael Luo, Sanjit A. Seshia, Joseph E. Gonzalez

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T17:54:14Z

**Summary**: Generating diverse responses from large language models (LLMs) is crucial for applications such as planning/search and synthetic data generation, where diversity provides distinct answers across generations. Prior approaches rely on increasing temperature to increase diversity. However, contrary to popular belief, we show not only does this approach produce lower quality individual generations as temperature increases, but it depends on model's next-token probabilities being similar to the true distribution of answers. We propose \method{}, an alternative approach that uses the language model itself to partition the space into strata. At inference, a random stratum is selected and a sample drawn from within the strata. To measure diversity, we introduce CoverageQA, a dataset of underspecified questions with multiple equally plausible answers, and assess diversity by measuring KL Divergence between the output distribution and uniform distribution over valid ground truth answers. As computing probability per response/solution for proprietary models is infeasible, we measure recall on ground truth solutions. Our evaluation show using SimpleStrat achieves higher recall by 0.05 compared to GPT-4o and 0.36 average reduction in KL Divergence compared to Llama 3.

### Mentor-KD: Making Small Language Models Better Multi-step Reasoners
**Authors**: Hojae Lee, Junho Kim, SangKeun Lee

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T17:53:27Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have displayed remarkable performances across various complex tasks by leveraging Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. Recently, studies have proposed a Knowledge Distillation (KD) approach, reasoning distillation, which transfers such reasoning ability of LLMs through fine-tuning language models of multi-step rationales generated by LLM teachers. However, they have inadequately considered two challenges regarding insufficient distillation sets from the LLM teacher model, in terms of 1) data quality and 2) soft label provision. In this paper, we propose Mentor-KD, which effectively distills the multi-step reasoning capability of LLMs to smaller LMs while addressing the aforementioned challenges. Specifically, we exploit a mentor, intermediate-sized task-specific fine-tuned model, to augment additional CoT annotations and provide soft labels for the student model during reasoning distillation. We conduct extensive experiments and confirm Mentor-KD's effectiveness across various models and complex reasoning tasks.

### PEAR: A Robust and Flexible Automation Framework for Ptychography   Enabled by Multiple Large Language Model Agents
**Authors**: Xiangyu Yin, Chuqiao Shi, Yimo Han, Yi Jiang

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T17:50:59Z

**Summary**: Ptychography is an advanced computational imaging technique in X-ray and electron microscopy. It has been widely adopted across scientific research fields, including physics, chemistry, biology, and materials science, as well as in industrial applications such as semiconductor characterization. In practice, obtaining high-quality ptychographic images requires simultaneous optimization of numerous experimental and algorithmic parameters. Traditionally, parameter selection often relies on trial and error, leading to low-throughput workflows and potential human bias. In this work, we develop the "Ptychographic Experiment and Analysis Robot" (PEAR), a framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to automate data analysis in ptychography. To ensure high robustness and accuracy, PEAR employs multiple LLM agents for tasks including knowledge retrieval, code generation, parameter recommendation, and image reasoning. Our study demonstrates that PEAR's multi-agent design significantly improves the workflow success rate, even with smaller open-weight models such as LLaMA 3.1 8B. PEAR also supports various automation levels and is designed to work with customized local knowledge bases, ensuring flexibility and adaptability across different research environments.

### DeLLMa: Decision Making Under Uncertainty with Large Language Models
**Authors**: Ollie Liu, Deqing Fu, Dani Yogatama, Willie Neiswanger

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T17:43:48Z

**Summary**: The potential of large language models (LLMs) as decision support tools is increasingly being explored in fields such as business, engineering, and medicine, which often face challenging tasks of decision-making under uncertainty. In this paper, we show that directly prompting LLMs on these types of decision-making problems can yield poor results, especially as the problem complexity increases. To aid in these tasks, we propose DeLLMa (Decision-making Large Language Model assistant), a framework designed to enhance decision-making accuracy in uncertain environments. DeLLMa involves a multi-step reasoning procedure that integrates recent best practices in scaling inference-time reasoning, drawing upon principles from decision theory and utility theory, to provide an accurate and human-auditable decision-making process. We validate our procedure on multiple realistic decision-making environments, demonstrating that DeLLMa can consistently enhance the decision-making performance of leading language models, and achieve up to a 40% increase in accuracy over competing methods. Additionally, we show how performance improves when scaling compute at test time, and carry out human evaluations to benchmark components of DeLLMa.

### AgentHarm: A Benchmark for Measuring Harmfulness of LLM Agents
**Authors**: Maksym Andriushchenko, Alexandra Souly, Mateusz Dziemian, Derek Duenas, Maxwell Lin, Justin Wang, Dan Hendrycks, Andy Zou, Zico Kolter, Matt Fredrikson, Eric Winsor, Jerome Wynne, Yarin Gal, Xander Davies

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T17:39:22Z

**Summary**: The robustness of LLMs to jailbreak attacks, where users design prompts to circumvent safety measures and misuse model capabilities, has been studied primarily for LLMs acting as simple chatbots. Meanwhile, LLM agents -- which use external tools and can execute multi-stage tasks -- may pose a greater risk if misused, but their robustness remains underexplored. To facilitate research on LLM agent misuse, we propose a new benchmark called AgentHarm. The benchmark includes a diverse set of 110 explicitly malicious agent tasks (440 with augmentations), covering 11 harm categories including fraud, cybercrime, and harassment. In addition to measuring whether models refuse harmful agentic requests, scoring well on AgentHarm requires jailbroken agents to maintain their capabilities following an attack to complete a multi-step task. We evaluate a range of leading LLMs, and find (1) leading LLMs are surprisingly compliant with malicious agent requests without jailbreaking, (2) simple universal jailbreak templates can be adapted to effectively jailbreak agents, and (3) these jailbreaks enable coherent and malicious multi-step agent behavior and retain model capabilities. We publicly release AgentHarm to enable simple and reliable evaluation of attacks and defenses for LLM-based agents. We publicly release the benchmark at https://huggingface.co/ai-safety-institute/AgentHarm.

### The Impact of Visual Information in Chinese Characters: Evaluating Large   Models' Ability to Recognize and Utilize Radicals
**Authors**: Xiaofeng Wu, Karl Stratos, Wei Xu

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T17:30:02Z

**Summary**: The glyphic writing system of Chinese incorporates information-rich visual features in each character, such as radicals that provide hints about meaning or pronunciation. However, there has been no investigation into whether contemporary Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can harness these sub-character features in Chinese through prompting. In this study, we establish a benchmark to evaluate LLMs' and VLMs' understanding of visual elements in Chinese characters, including radicals, composition structures, strokes, and stroke counts. Our results reveal that models surprisingly exhibit some, but still limited, knowledge of the visual information, regardless of whether images of characters are provided. To incite models' ability to use radicals, we further experiment with incorporating radicals into the prompts for Chinese language understanding tasks. We observe consistent improvement in Part-Of-Speech tagging when providing additional information about radicals, suggesting the potential to enhance CLP by integrating sub-character information.

### Software Engineering and Foundation Models: Insights from Industry Blogs   Using a Jury of Foundation Models
**Authors**: Hao Li, Cor-Paul Bezemer, Ahmed E. Hassan

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T17:27:04Z

**Summary**: Foundation models (FMs) such as large language models (LLMs) have significantly impacted many fields, including software engineering (SE). The interaction between SE and FMs has led to the integration of FMs into SE practices (FM4SE) and the application of SE methodologies to FMs (SE4FM). While several literature surveys exist on academic contributions to these trends, we are the first to provide a practitioner's view. We analyze 155 FM4SE and 997 SE4FM blog posts from leading technology companies, leveraging an FM-powered surveying approach to systematically label and summarize the discussed activities and tasks. We observed that while code generation is the most prominent FM4SE task, FMs are leveraged for many other SE activities such as code understanding, summarization, and API recommendation. The majority of blog posts on SE4FM are about model deployment & operation, and system architecture & orchestration. Although the emphasis is on cloud deployments, there is a growing interest in compressing FMs and deploying them on smaller devices such as edge or mobile devices. We outline eight future research directions inspired by our gained insights, aiming to bridge the gap between academic findings and real-world applications. Our study not only enriches the body of knowledge on practical applications of FM4SE and SE4FM but also demonstrates the utility of FMs as a powerful and efficient approach in conducting literature surveys within technical and grey literature domains. Our dataset, results, code and used prompts can be found in our online replication package at https://github.com/SAILResearch/fmse-blogs.

### SuperCorrect: Supervising and Correcting Language Models with   Error-Driven Insights
**Authors**: Ling Yang, Zhaochen Yu, Tianjun Zhang, Minkai Xu, Joseph E. Gonzalez, Bin Cui, Shuicheng Yan

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T17:25:52Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4, PaLM, and LLaMA have shown significant improvements in various reasoning tasks. However, smaller models such as Llama-3-8B and DeepSeekMath-Base still struggle with complex mathematical reasoning because they fail to effectively identify and correct reasoning errors. Recent reflection-based methods aim to address these issues by enabling self-reflection and self-correction, but they still face challenges in independently detecting errors in their reasoning steps. To overcome these limitations, we propose SuperCorrect, a novel two-stage framework that uses a large teacher model to supervise and correct both the reasoning and reflection processes of a smaller student model. In the first stage, we extract hierarchical high-level and detailed thought templates from the teacher model to guide the student model in eliciting more fine-grained reasoning thoughts. In the second stage, we introduce cross-model collaborative direct preference optimization (DPO) to enhance the self-correction abilities of the student model by following the teacher's correction traces during training. This cross-model DPO approach teaches the student model to effectively locate and resolve erroneous thoughts with error-driven insights from the teacher model, breaking the bottleneck of its thoughts and acquiring new skills and knowledge to tackle challenging problems. Extensive experiments consistently demonstrate our superiority over previous methods. Notably, our SuperCorrect-7B model significantly surpasses powerful DeepSeekMath-7B by 7.8%/5.3% and Qwen2.5-Math-7B by 15.1%/6.3% on MATH/GSM8K benchmarks, achieving new SOTA performance among all 7B models.

### From Interaction to Impact: Towards Safer AI Agents Through   Understanding and Evaluating UI Operation Impacts
**Authors**: Zhuohao Jerry Zhang, Eldon Schoop, Jeffrey Nichols, Anuj Mahajan, Amanda Swearngin

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T17:24:00Z

**Summary**: With advances in generative AI, there is increasing work towards creating autonomous agents that can manage daily tasks by operating user interfaces (UIs). While prior research has studied the mechanics of how AI agents might navigate UIs and understand UI structure, the effects of agents and their autonomous actions-particularly those that may be risky or irreversible-remain under-explored. In this work, we investigate the real-world impacts and consequences of UI actions by AI agents. We began by developing a taxonomy of the impacts of UI actions through a series of workshops with domain experts. Following this, we conducted a data synthesis study to gather realistic UI screen traces and action data that users perceive as impactful. We then used our impact categories to annotate our collected data and data repurposed from existing UI navigation datasets. Our quantitative evaluations of different large language models (LLMs) and variants demonstrate how well different LLMs can understand the impacts of UI actions that might be taken by an agent. We show that our taxonomy enhances the reasoning capabilities of these LLMs for understanding the impacts of UI actions, but our findings also reveal significant gaps in their ability to reliably classify more nuanced or complex categories of impact.

### Controlling Whisper: Universal Acoustic Adversarial Attacks to Control   Speech Foundation Models
**Authors**: Vyas Raina, Mark Gales

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T17:21:40Z

**Summary**: Speech enabled foundation models, either in the form of flexible speech recognition based systems or audio-prompted large language models (LLMs), are becoming increasingly popular. One of the interesting aspects of these models is their ability to perform tasks other than automatic speech recognition (ASR) using an appropriate prompt. For example, the OpenAI Whisper model can perform both speech transcription and speech translation. With the development of audio-prompted LLMs there is the potential for even greater control options. In this work we demonstrate that with this greater flexibility the systems can be susceptible to model-control adversarial attacks. Without any access to the model prompt it is possible to modify the behaviour of the system by appropriately changing the audio input. To illustrate this risk, we demonstrate that it is possible to prepend a short universal adversarial acoustic segment to any input speech signal to override the prompt setting of an ASR foundation model. Specifically, we successfully use a universal adversarial acoustic segment to control Whisper to always perform speech translation, despite being set to perform speech transcription. Overall, this work demonstrates a new form of adversarial attack on multi-tasking speech enabled foundation models that needs to be considered prior to the deployment of this form of model.

### LLM-Generated Black-box Explanations Can Be Adversarially Helpful
**Authors**: Rohan Ajwani, Shashidhar Reddy Javaji, Frank Rudzicz, Zining Zhu

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T17:16:30Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming vital tools that help us solve and understand complex problems by acting as digital assistants. LLMs can generate convincing explanations, even when only given the inputs and outputs of these problems, i.e., in a ``black-box'' approach. However, our research uncovers a hidden risk tied to this approach, which we call *adversarial helpfulness*. This happens when an LLM's explanations make a wrong answer look right, potentially leading people to trust incorrect solutions. In this paper, we show that this issue affects not just humans, but also LLM evaluators. Digging deeper, we identify and examine key persuasive strategies employed by LLMs. Our findings reveal that these models employ strategies such as reframing the questions, expressing an elevated level of confidence, and cherry-picking evidence to paint misleading answers in a credible light. To examine if LLMs are able to navigate complex-structured knowledge when generating adversarially helpful explanations, we create a special task based on navigating through graphs. Most LLMs are not able to find alternative paths along simple graphs, indicating that their misleading explanations aren't produced by only logical deductions using complex knowledge. These findings shed light on the limitations of the black-box explanation setting and allow us to provide advice on the safe usage of LLMs.

### Hypothesis-only Biases in Large Language Model-Elicited Natural Language   Inference
**Authors**: Grace Proebsting, Adam Poliak

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T17:09:22Z

**Summary**: We test whether replacing crowdsource workers with LLMs to write Natural Language Inference (NLI) hypotheses similarly results in annotation artifacts. We recreate a portion of the Stanford NLI corpus using GPT-4, Llama-2 and Mistral 7b, and train hypothesis-only classifiers to determine whether LLM-elicited hypotheses contain annotation artifacts. On our LLM-elicited NLI datasets, BERT-based hypothesis-only classifiers achieve between 86-96% accuracy, indicating these datasets contain hypothesis-only artifacts. We also find frequent "give-aways" in LLM-generated hypotheses, e.g. the phrase "swimming in a pool" appears in more than 10,000 contradictions generated by GPT-4. Our analysis provides empirical evidence that well-attested biases in NLI can persist in LLM-generated data.

### Science is Exploration: Computational Frontiers for Conceptual Metaphor   Theory
**Authors**: Rebecca M. M. Hicke, Ross Deans Kristensen-McLachlan

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T17:03:13Z

**Summary**: Metaphors are everywhere. They appear extensively across all domains of natural language, from the most sophisticated poetry to seemingly dry academic prose. A significant body of research in the cognitive science of language argues for the existence of conceptual metaphors, the systematic structuring of one domain of experience in the language of another. Conceptual metaphors are not simply rhetorical flourishes but are crucial evidence of the role of analogical reasoning in human cognition. In this paper, we ask whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can accurately identify and explain the presence of such conceptual metaphors in natural language data. Using a novel prompting technique based on metaphor annotation guidelines, we demonstrate that LLMs are a promising tool for large-scale computational research on conceptual metaphors. Further, we show that LLMs are able to apply procedural guidelines designed for human annotators, displaying a surprising depth of linguistic knowledge.

### SubZero: Random Subspace Zeroth-Order Optimization for Memory-Efficient   LLM Fine-Tuning
**Authors**: Ziming Yu, Pan Zhou, Sike Wang, Jia Li, Hua Huang

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T17:01:43Z

**Summary**: Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) has proven effective for a variety of downstream tasks. However, as LLMs grow in size, the memory demands for backpropagation become increasingly prohibitive. Zeroth-order (ZO) optimization methods offer a memory-efficient alternative by using forward passes to estimate gradients, but the variance of gradient estimates typically scales linearly with the model's parameter dimension$\unicode{x2013}$a significant issue for LLMs. In this paper, we propose the random Subspace Zeroth-order (SubZero) optimization to address the challenges posed by LLMs' high dimensionality. We introduce a low-rank perturbation tailored for LLMs that significantly reduces memory consumption while improving training performance. Additionally, we prove that our gradient estimation closely approximates the backpropagation gradient, exhibits lower variance than traditional ZO methods, and ensures convergence when combined with SGD. Experimental results show that SubZero enhances fine-tuning performance and achieves faster convergence compared to standard ZO approaches like MeZO across various language modeling tasks.

### Towards Trustworthy Knowledge Graph Reasoning: An Uncertainty Aware   Perspective
**Authors**: Bo Ni, Yu Wang, Lu Cheng, Erik Blasch, Tyler Derr

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T16:57:30Z

**Summary**: Recently, Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have been successfully coupled with Large Language Models (LLMs) to mitigate their hallucinations and enhance their reasoning capability, such as in KG-based retrieval-augmented frameworks. However, current KG-LLM frameworks lack rigorous uncertainty estimation, limiting their reliable deployment in high-stakes applications. Directly incorporating uncertainty quantification into KG-LLM frameworks presents challenges due to their complex architectures and the intricate interactions between the knowledge graph and language model components. To address this gap, we propose a new trustworthy KG-LLM framework, Uncertainty Aware Knowledge-Graph Reasoning (UAG), which incorporates uncertainty quantification into the KG-LLM framework. We design an uncertainty-aware multi-step reasoning framework that leverages conformal prediction to provide a theoretical guarantee on the prediction set. To manage the error rate of the multi-step process, we additionally introduce an error rate control module to adjust the error rate within the individual components. Extensive experiments show that our proposed UAG can achieve any pre-defined coverage rate while reducing the prediction set/interval size by 40% on average over the baselines.

### NoVo: Norm Voting off Hallucinations with Attention Heads in Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Zheng Yi Ho, Siyuan Liang, Sen Zhang, Yibing Zhan, Dacheng Tao

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T16:40:03Z

**Summary**: Hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) remain a major obstacle, particularly in high-stakes applications where factual accuracy is critical. While representation editing and reading methods have made strides in reducing hallucinations, their heavy reliance on specialised tools and training on in-domain samples, makes them difficult to scale and prone to overfitting. This limits their accuracy gains and generalizability to diverse datasets. This paper presents a lightweight method, Norm Voting (NoVo), which harnesses the untapped potential of attention head norms to dramatically enhance factual accuracy in zero-shot multiple-choice questions (MCQs). NoVo begins by automatically selecting truth-correlated head norms with an efficient, inference-only algorithm using only 30 random samples, allowing NoVo to effortlessly scale to diverse datasets. Afterwards, selected head norms are employed in a simple voting algorithm, which yields significant gains in prediction accuracy. On TruthfulQA MC1, NoVo surpasses the current state-of-the-art and all previous methods by an astounding margin -- at least 19 accuracy points. NoVo demonstrates exceptional generalization to 20 diverse datasets, with significant gains in over 90\% of them, far exceeding all current representation editing and reading methods. NoVo also reveals promising gains to finetuning strategies and building textual adversarial defence. NoVo's effectiveness with head norms opens new frontiers in LLM interpretability, robustness and reliability.

### Controllable Safety Alignment: Inference-Time Adaptation to Diverse   Safety Requirements
**Authors**: Jingyu Zhang, Ahmed Elgohary, Ahmed Magooda, Daniel Khashabi, Benjamin Van Durme

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T16:38:01Z

**Summary**: The current paradigm for safety alignment of large language models (LLMs) follows a one-size-fits-all approach: the model refuses to interact with any content deemed unsafe by the model provider. This approach lacks flexibility in the face of varying social norms across cultures and regions. In addition, users may have diverse safety needs, making a model with static safety standards too restrictive to be useful, as well as too costly to be re-aligned.   We propose Controllable Safety Alignment (CoSA), a framework designed to adapt models to diverse safety requirements without re-training. Instead of aligning a fixed model, we align models to follow safety configs -- free-form natural language descriptions of the desired safety behaviors -- that are provided as part of the system prompt. To adjust model safety behavior, authorized users only need to modify such safety configs at inference time. To enable that, we propose CoSAlign, a data-centric method for aligning LLMs to easily adapt to diverse safety configs. Furthermore, we devise a novel controllability evaluation protocol that considers both helpfulness and configured safety, summarizing them into CoSA-Score, and construct CoSApien, a human-authored benchmark that consists of real-world LLM use cases with diverse safety requirements and corresponding evaluation prompts.   We show that CoSAlign leads to substantial gains of controllability over strong baselines including in-context alignment. Our framework encourages better representation and adaptation to pluralistic human values in LLMs, and thereby increasing their practicality.

### Language Imbalance Driven Rewarding for Multilingual Self-improving
**Authors**: Wen Yang, Junhong Wu, Chen Wang, Chengqing Zong, Jiajun Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T16:32:05Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance across numerous tasks. However, these advancements have predominantly benefited "first-class" languages such as English and Chinese, leaving many other languages underrepresented. This imbalance, while limiting broader applications, generates a natural preference ranking between languages, offering an opportunity to bootstrap the multilingual capabilities of LLM in a self-improving manner. Thus, we propose $\textit{Language Imbalance Driven Rewarding}$, where the inherent imbalance between dominant and non-dominant languages within LLMs is leveraged as a reward signal. Iterative DPO training demonstrates that this approach not only enhances LLM performance in non-dominant languages but also improves the dominant language's capacity, thereby yielding an iterative reward signal. Fine-tuning Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct over two iterations of this approach results in continuous improvements in multilingual performance across instruction-following and arithmetic reasoning tasks, evidenced by an average improvement of 7.46% win rate on the X-AlpacaEval leaderboard and 13.9% accuracy on the MGSM benchmark. This work serves as an initial exploration, paving the way for multilingual self-improvement of LLMs.

### Interpretable Contrastive Monte Carlo Tree Search Reasoning
**Authors**: Zitian Gao, Boye Niu, Xuzheng He, Haotian Xu, Hongzhang Liu, Aiwei Liu, Xuming Hu, Lijie Wen

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T16:28:36Z

**Summary**: We propose SC-MCTS*: a novel Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) reasoning algorithm for Large Language Models (LLMs), significantly improves both reasoning accuracy and speed. Our motivation comes from: 1. Previous MCTS LLM reasoning works often overlooked its biggest drawback--slower speed compared to CoT; 2. Previous research mainly used MCTS as a tool for LLM reasoning on various tasks with limited quantitative analysis or ablation studies of its components from reasoning interpretability perspective. 3. The reward model is the most crucial component in MCTS, however previous work has rarely conducted in-depth study or improvement of MCTS's reward models. Thus, we conducted extensive ablation studies and quantitative analysis on components of MCTS, revealing the impact of each component on the MCTS reasoning performance of LLMs. Building on this, (i) we designed a highly interpretable reward model based on the principle of contrastive decoding and (ii) achieved an average speed improvement of 51.9% per node using speculative decoding. Additionally, (iii) we improved UCT node selection strategy and backpropagation used in previous works, resulting in significant performance improvement. We outperformed o1-mini by an average of 17.4% on the Blocksworld multi-step reasoning dataset using Llama-3.1-70B with SC-MCTS*.

### Token Erasure as a Footprint of Implicit Vocabulary Items in LLMs
**Authors**: Sheridan Feucht, David Atkinson, Byron Wallace, David Bau

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T16:20:16Z

**Summary**: LLMs process text as sequences of tokens that roughly correspond to words, where less common words are represented by multiple tokens. However, individual tokens are often semantically unrelated to the meanings of the words/concepts they comprise. For example, Llama-2-7b's tokenizer splits the word "northeastern" into the tokens ['_n', 'ort', 'he', 'astern'], none of which correspond to semantically meaningful units like "north" or "east." Similarly, the overall meanings of named entities like "Neil Young" and multi-word expressions like "break a leg" cannot be directly inferred from their constituent tokens. Mechanistically, how do LLMs convert such arbitrary groups of tokens into useful higher-level representations? In this work, we find that last token representations of named entities and multi-token words exhibit a pronounced "erasure" effect, where information about previous and current tokens is rapidly forgotten in early layers. Using this observation, we propose a method to "read out" the implicit vocabulary of an autoregressive LLM by examining differences in token representations across layers, and present results of this method for Llama-2-7b and Llama-3-8B. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to probe the implicit vocabulary of an LLM.

### PostMark: A Robust Blackbox Watermark for Large Language Models
**Authors**: Yapei Chang, Kalpesh Krishna, Amir Houmansadr, John Wieting, Mohit Iyyer

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T16:19:55Z

**Summary**: The most effective techniques to detect LLM-generated text rely on inserting a detectable signature -- or watermark -- during the model's decoding process. Most existing watermarking methods require access to the underlying LLM's logits, which LLM API providers are loath to share due to fears of model distillation. As such, these watermarks must be implemented independently by each LLM provider. In this paper, we develop PostMark, a modular post-hoc watermarking procedure in which an input-dependent set of words (determined via a semantic embedding) is inserted into the text after the decoding process has completed. Critically, PostMark does not require logit access, which means it can be implemented by a third party. We also show that PostMark is more robust to paraphrasing attacks than existing watermarking methods: our experiments cover eight baseline algorithms, five base LLMs, and three datasets. Finally, we evaluate the impact of PostMark on text quality using both automated and human assessments, highlighting the trade-off between quality and robustness to paraphrasing. We release our code, outputs, and annotations at https://github.com/lilakk/PostMark.

### On the Adversarial Transferability of Generalized "Skip Connections"
**Authors**: Yisen Wang, Yichuan Mo, Dongxian Wu, Mingjie Li, Xingjun Ma, Zhouchen Lin

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T16:17:47Z

**Summary**: Skip connection is an essential ingredient for modern deep models to be deeper and more powerful. Despite their huge success in normal scenarios (state-of-the-art classification performance on natural examples), we investigate and identify an interesting property of skip connections under adversarial scenarios, namely, the use of skip connections allows easier generation of highly transferable adversarial examples. Specifically, in ResNet-like models (with skip connections), we find that using more gradients from the skip connections rather than the residual modules according to a decay factor during backpropagation allows one to craft adversarial examples with high transferability. The above method is termed as Skip Gradient Method (SGM). Although starting from ResNet-like models in vision domains, we further extend SGM to more advanced architectures, including Vision Transformers (ViTs) and models with length-varying paths and other domains, i.e. natural language processing. We conduct comprehensive transfer attacks against various models including ResNets, Transformers, Inceptions, Neural Architecture Search, and Large Language Models (LLMs). We show that employing SGM can greatly improve the transferability of crafted attacks in almost all cases. Furthermore, considering the big complexity for practical use, we further demonstrate that SGM can even improve the transferability on ensembles of models or targeted attacks and the stealthiness against current defenses. At last, we provide theoretical explanations and empirical insights on how SGM works. Our findings not only motivate new adversarial research into the architectural characteristics of models but also open up further challenges for secure model architecture design. Our code is available at https://github.com/mo666666/SGM.

### The Dynamics of Social Conventions in LLM populations: Spontaneous   Emergence, Collective Biases and Tipping Points
**Authors**: Ariel Flint Ashery, Luca Maria Aiello, Andrea Baronchelli

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T16:16:38Z

**Summary**: Social conventions are the foundation for social and economic life. As legions of AI agents increasingly interact with each other and with humans, their ability to form shared conventions will determine how effectively they will coordinate behaviors, integrate into society and influence it. Here, we investigate the dynamics of conventions within populations of Large Language Model (LLM) agents using simulated interactions. First, we show that globally accepted social conventions can spontaneously arise from local interactions between communicating LLMs. Second, we demonstrate how strong collective biases can emerge during this process, even when individual agents appear to be unbiased. Third, we examine how minority groups of committed LLMs can drive social change by establishing new social conventions. We show that once these minority groups reach a critical size, they can consistently overturn established behaviors. In all cases, contrasting the experimental results with predictions from a minimal multi-agent model allows us to isolate the specific role of LLM agents. Our results clarify how AI systems can autonomously develop norms without explicit programming and have implications for designing AI systems that align with human values and societal goals.

**Authors**: Klaudia Thellmann, Bernhard Stadler, Michael Fromm, Jasper Schulze Buschhoff, Alex Jude, Fabio Barth, Johannes Leveling, Nicolas Flores-Herr, Joachim K√∂hler, Ren√© J√§kel, Mehdi Ali

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T15:53:24Z

**Summary**: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized natural language processing across numerous languages and tasks. However, evaluating LLM performance in a consistent and meaningful way across multiple European languages remains challenging, especially due to the scarcity of multilingual benchmarks. We introduce a cross-lingual evaluation approach tailored for European languages. We employ translated versions of five widely-used benchmarks to assess the capabilities of 40 LLMs across 21 European languages. Our contributions include examining the effectiveness of translated benchmarks, assessing the impact of different translation services, and offering a multilingual evaluation framework for LLMs that includes newly created datasets: EU20-MMLU, EU20-HellaSwag, EU20-ARC, EU20-TruthfulQA, and EU20-GSM8K. The benchmarks and results are made publicly available to encourage further research in multilingual LLM evaluation.

**Authors**: Virmarie Maquiling, Sean Anthony Byrne, Diederick C. Niehorster, Marco Carminati, Enkelejda Kasneci

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T15:50:53Z

**Summary**: We explore the transformative potential of SAM 2, a vision foundation model, in advancing gaze estimation and eye tracking technologies. By significantly reducing annotation time, lowering technical barriers through its ease of deployment, and enhancing segmentation accuracy, SAM 2 addresses critical challenges faced by researchers and practitioners. Utilizing its zero-shot segmentation capabilities with minimal user input-a single click per video-we tested SAM 2 on over 14 million eye images from diverse datasets, including virtual reality setups and the world's largest unified dataset recorded using wearable eye trackers. Remarkably, in pupil segmentation tasks, SAM 2 matches the performance of domain-specific models trained solely on eye images, achieving competitive mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) scores of up to 93% without fine-tuning. Additionally, we provide our code and segmentation masks for these widely used datasets to promote further research.

### Exploring the Design Space of Cognitive Engagement Techniques with   AI-Generated Code for Enhanced Learning
**Authors**: Majeed Kazemitabaar, Oliver Huang, Sangho Suh, Austin Z. Henley, Tovi Grossman

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T15:49:42Z

**Summary**: Novice programmers are increasingly relying on Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate code for learning programming concepts. However, this interaction can lead to superficial engagement, giving learners an illusion of learning and hindering skill development. To address this issue, we conducted a systematic design exploration to develop seven cognitive engagement techniques aimed at promoting deeper engagement with AI-generated code. In this paper, we describe our design process, the initial seven techniques and results from a between-subjects study (N=82). We then iteratively refined the top techniques and further evaluated them through a within-subjects study (N=42). We evaluate the friction each technique introduces, their effectiveness in helping learners apply concepts to isomorphic tasks without AI assistance, and their success in aligning learners' perceived and actual coding abilities. Ultimately, our results highlight the most effective technique: guiding learners through the step-by-step problem-solving process, where they engage in an interactive dialog with the AI, prompting what needs to be done at each stage before the corresponding code is revealed.

**Summary**: Wikimedia content is used extensively by the AI community and within the language modeling community in particular. In this paper, we provide a review of the different ways in which Wikimedia data is curated to use in NLP tasks across pre-training, post-training, and model evaluations. We point to opportunities for greater use of Wikimedia content but also identify ways in which the language modeling community could better center the needs of Wikimedia editors. In particular, we call for incorporating additional sources of Wikimedia data, a greater focus on benchmarks for LLMs that encode Wikimedia principles, and greater multilingualism in Wikimedia-derived datasets.

### Test-driven Software Experimentation with LASSO: an LLM Benchmarking   Example
**Authors**: Marcus Kessel

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T15:32:48Z

**Summary**: Empirical software engineering faces a critical gap: the lack of standardized tools for rapid development and execution of Test-Driven Software Experiments (TDSEs) - that is, experiments that involve the execution of software subjects and the observation and analysis of their "de facto" run-time behavior. In this paper we present a general-purpose analysis platform called LASSO that provides a minimal set of domain-specific languages and data structures to conduct TDSEs. By empowering users with an executable scripting language to design and execute TDSEs, LASSO enables efficient evaluation of run-time semantics and execution characteristics in addition to statically determined properties. We present an example TDSE that demonstrates the practical benefits of LASSO's scripting capabilities for assessing the reliability of LLMs for code generation by means of a self-contained, reusable and extensible study script. The LASSO platform is freely available at: https://softwareobservatorium.github.io/, and a demo video is available on YouTube: https://youtu.be/tzY9oNTWXzw

### Utilizing ChatGPT in a Data Structures and Algorithms Course: A Teaching   Assistant's Perspective
**Authors**: Pooriya Jamie, Reyhaneh Hajihashemi, Sharareh Alipour

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T15:18:48Z

**Summary**: Integrating large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT is revolutionizing the field of computer science education. These models offer new possibilities for enriching student learning and supporting teaching assistants (TAs) in providing prompt feedback and supplementary learning resources. This research delves into the use of ChatGPT in a data structures and algorithms (DSA) course, particularly when combined with TA supervision. The findings demonstrate that incorporating ChatGPT with structured prompts and active TA guidance enhances students' understanding of intricate algorithmic concepts, boosts engagement, and elevates academic performance. However, challenges exist in addressing academic integrity and the limitations of LLMs in tackling complex problems. The study underscores the importance of active TA involvement in reducing students' reliance on AI-generated content and amplifying the overall educational impact. The results suggest that while LLMs can be advantageous for education, their successful integration demands continuous oversight and a thoughtful balance between AI and human guidance.

### A Quick, trustworthy spectral knowledge Q&A system leveraging   retrieval-augmented generation on LLM
**Authors**: Jiheng Liang, Ziru Yu, Zujie Xie, Xiangyang Yu

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T15:13:51Z

**Summary**: Large Language Model (LLM) has demonstrated significant success in a range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks within general domain. The emergence of LLM has introduced innovative methodologies across diverse fields, including the natural sciences. Researchers aim to implement automated, concurrent process driven by LLM to supplant conventional manual, repetitive and labor-intensive work. In the domain of spectral analysis and detection, it is imperative for researchers to autonomously acquire pertinent knowledge across various research objects, which encompasses the spectroscopic techniques and the chemometric methods that are employed in experiments and analysis. Paradoxically, despite the recognition of spectroscopic detection as an effective analytical method, the fundamental process of knowledge retrieval remains both time-intensive and repetitive. In response to this challenge, we first introduced the Spectral Detection and Analysis Based Paper(SDAAP) dataset, which is the first open-source textual knowledge dataset for spectral analysis and detection and contains annotated literature data as well as corresponding knowledge instruction data. Subsequently, we also designed an automated Q\&A framework based on the SDAAP dataset, which can retrieve relevant knowledge and generate high-quality responses by extracting entities in the input as retrieval parameters. It is worth noting that: within this framework, LLM is only used as a tool to provide generalizability, while RAG technique is used to accurately capture the source of the knowledge.This approach not only improves the quality of the generated responses, but also ensures the traceability of the knowledge. Experimental results show that our framework generates responses with more reliable expertise compared to the baseline.

### Do Large Language Models have Shared Weaknesses in Medical Question   Answering?
**Authors**: Andrew M. Bean, Karolina Korgul, Felix Krones, Robert McCraith, Adam Mahdi

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T14:55:44Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have made rapid improvement on medical benchmarks, but their unreliability remains a persistent challenge for safe real-world uses. To design for the use LLMs as a category, rather than for specific models, requires developing an understanding of shared strengths and weaknesses which appear across models. To address this challenge, we benchmark a range of top LLMs and identify consistent patterns across models. We test $16$ well-known LLMs on $874$ newly collected questions from Polish medical licensing exams. For each question, we score each model on the top-1 accuracy and the distribution of probabilities assigned. We then compare these results with factors such as question difficulty for humans, question length, and the scores of the other models. LLM accuracies were positively correlated pairwise ($0.39$ to $0.58$). Model performance was also correlated with human performance ($0.09$ to $0.13$), but negatively correlated to the difference between the question-level accuracy of top-scoring and bottom-scoring humans ($-0.09$ to $-0.14$). The top output probability and question length were positive and negative predictors of accuracy respectively (p$< 0.05$). The top scoring LLM, GPT-4o Turbo, scored $84\%$, with Claude Opus, Gemini 1.5 Pro and Llama 3/3.1 between $74\%$ and $79\%$. We found evidence of similarities between models in which questions they answer correctly, as well as similarities with human test takers. Larger models typically performed better, but differences in training, architecture, and data were also highly impactful. Model accuracy was positively correlated with confidence, but negatively correlated with question length. We find similar results with older models, and argue that these patterns are likely to persist across future models using similar training methods.

**Authors**: Daniel Balcells, Benjamin Lerner, Michael Oesterle, Ediz Ucar, Stefan Heimersheim

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T14:46:49Z

**Summary**: Sparse Autoencoders for transformer-based language models are typically defined independently per layer. In this work we analyze statistical relationships between features in adjacent layers to understand how features evolve through a forward pass. We provide a graph visualization interface for features and their most similar next-layer neighbors, and build communities of related features across layers. We find that a considerable amount of features are passed through from a previous layer, some features can be expressed as quasi-boolean combinations of previous features, and some features become more specialized in later layers.

### Audio Description Generation in the Era of LLMs and VLMs: A Review of   Transferable Generative AI Technologies
**Authors**: Yingqiang Gao, Lukas Fischer, Alexa Lintner, Sarah Ebling

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T14:40:51Z

**Summary**: Audio descriptions (ADs) function as acoustic commentaries designed to assist blind persons and persons with visual impairments in accessing digital media content on television and in movies, among other settings. As an accessibility service typically provided by trained AD professionals, the generation of ADs demands significant human effort, making the process both time-consuming and costly. Recent advancements in natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV), particularly in large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs), have allowed for getting a step closer to automatic AD generation. This paper reviews the technologies pertinent to AD generation in the era of LLMs and VLMs: we discuss how state-of-the-art NLP and CV technologies can be applied to generate ADs and identify essential research directions for the future.

### Decoding Secret Memorization in Code LLMs Through Token-Level   Characterization
**Authors**: Yuqing Nie, Chong Wang, Kailong Wang, Guoai Xu, Guosheng Xu, Haoyu Wang

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T14:39:24Z

**Summary**: Code Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating, understanding, and manipulating programming code. However, their training process inadvertently leads to the memorization of sensitive information, posing severe privacy risks. Existing studies on memorization in LLMs primarily rely on prompt engineering techniques, which suffer from limitations such as widespread hallucination and inefficient extraction of the target sensitive information. In this paper, we present a novel approach to characterize real and fake secrets generated by Code LLMs based on token probabilities. We identify four key characteristics that differentiate genuine secrets from hallucinated ones, providing insights into distinguishing real and fake secrets. To overcome the limitations of existing works, we propose DESEC, a two-stage method that leverages token-level features derived from the identified characteristics to guide the token decoding process. DESEC consists of constructing an offline token scoring model using a proxy Code LLM and employing the scoring model to guide the decoding process by reassigning token likelihoods. Through extensive experiments on four state-of-the-art Code LLMs using a diverse dataset, we demonstrate the superior performance of DESEC in achieving a higher plausible rate and extracting more real secrets compared to existing baselines. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of our token-level approach in enabling an extensive assessment of the privacy leakage risks associated with Code LLMs.

**Authors**: Weichao Zhao, Hao Feng, Qi Liu, Jingqun Tang, Shu Wei, Binghong Wu, Lei Liao, Yongjie Ye, Hao Liu, Wengang Zhou, Houqiang Li, Can Huang

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T14:38:40Z

**Summary**: Tables contain factual and quantitative data accompanied by various structures and contents that pose challenges for machine comprehension. Previous methods generally design task-specific architectures and objectives for individual tasks, resulting in modal isolation and intricate workflows. In this paper, we present a novel large vision-language model, TabPedia, equipped with a concept synergy mechanism. In this mechanism, all the involved diverse visual table understanding (VTU) tasks and multi-source visual embeddings are abstracted as concepts. This unified framework allows TabPedia to seamlessly integrate VTU tasks, such as table detection, table structure recognition, table querying, and table question answering, by leveraging the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Moreover, the concept synergy mechanism enables table perception-related and comprehension-related tasks to work in harmony, as they can effectively leverage the needed clues from the corresponding source perception embeddings. Furthermore, to better evaluate the VTU task in real-world scenarios, we establish a new and comprehensive table VQA benchmark, ComTQA, featuring approximately 9,000 QA pairs. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments on both table perception and comprehension tasks, conducted across various public benchmarks, validate the effectiveness of our TabPedia. The superior performance further confirms the feasibility of using LLMs for understanding visual tables when all concepts work in synergy. The benchmark ComTQA has been open-sourced at https://huggingface.co/datasets/ByteDance/ComTQA. The source code and model also have been released athttps://github.com/zhaowc-ustc/TabPedia.

**Authors**: Mohamed Amine Hamdi, Francesco Daghero, Giuseppe Maria Sarda, Josse Van Delm, Arne Symons, Luca Benini, Marian Verhelst, Daniele Jahier Pagliari, Alessio Burrello

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T14:32:06Z

**Summary**: Streamlining the deployment of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) on heterogeneous edge platforms, coupling within the same micro-controller unit (MCU) instruction processors and hardware accelerators for tensor computations, is becoming one of the crucial challenges of the TinyML field.   The best-performing DNN compilation toolchains are usually deeply customized for a single MCU family, and porting to a different heterogeneous MCU family implies labor-intensive re-development of almost the entire compiler. On the opposite side, retargetable toolchains, such as TVM, fail to exploit the capabilities of custom accelerators, resulting in the generation of general but unoptimized code. To overcome this duality, we introduce MATCH, a novel TVM-based DNN deployment framework designed for easy agile retargeting across different MCU processors and accelerators, thanks to a customizable model-based hardware abstraction.   We show that a general and retargetable mapping framework enhanced with hardware cost models can compete with and even outperform custom toolchains on diverse targets while only needing the definition of an abstract hardware model and a SoC-specific API.   We tested MATCH on two state-of-the-art heterogeneous MCUs, GAP9 and DIANA.   On the four DNN models of the MLPerf Tiny suite MATCH reduces inference latency by up to 60.88 times on DIANA, compared to using the plain TVM, thanks to the exploitation of the on-board HW accelerator. Compared to HTVM, a fully customized toolchain for DIANA, we still reduce the latency by 16.94%. On GAP9, using the same benchmarks, we improve the latency by 2.15 times compared to the dedicated DORY compiler, thanks to our heterogeneous DNN mapping approach that synergically exploits the DNN accelerator and the eight-cores cluster available on board.

### Hybrid LLM-DDQN based Joint Optimization of V2I Communication and   Autonomous Driving
**Authors**: Zijiang Yan, Hao Zhou, Hina Tabassum, Xue Liu

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T14:30:04Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have received considerable interest recently due to their outstanding reasoning and comprehension capabilities. This work explores applying LLMs to vehicular networks, aiming to jointly optimize vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications and autonomous driving (AD) policies. We deploy LLMs for AD decision-making to maximize traffic flow and avoid collisions for road safety, and a double deep Q-learning algorithm (DDQN) is used for V2I optimization to maximize the received data rate and reduce frequent handovers. In particular, for LLM-enabled AD, we employ the Euclidean distance to identify previously explored AD experiences, and then LLMs can learn from past good and bad decisions for further improvement. Then, LLM-based AD decisions will become part of states in V2I problems, and DDQN will optimize the V2I decisions accordingly. After that, the AD and V2I decisions are iteratively optimized until convergence. Such an iterative optimization approach can better explore the interactions between LLMs and conventional reinforcement learning techniques, revealing the potential of using LLMs for network optimization and management. Finally, the simulations demonstrate that our proposed hybrid LLM-DDQN approach outperforms the conventional DDQN algorithm, showing faster convergence and higher average rewards.

### Conformalized Interactive Imitation Learning: Handling Expert Shift and   Intermittent Feedback
**Authors**: Michelle Zhao, Reid Simmons, Henny Admoni, Aaditya Ramdas, Andrea Bajcsy

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T14:27:56Z

**Summary**: In interactive imitation learning (IL), uncertainty quantification offers a way for the learner (i.e. robot) to contend with distribution shifts encountered during deployment by actively seeking additional feedback from an expert (i.e. human) online. Prior works use mechanisms like ensemble disagreement or Monte Carlo dropout to quantify when black-box IL policies are uncertain; however, these approaches can lead to overconfident estimates when faced with deployment-time distribution shifts. Instead, we contend that we need uncertainty quantification algorithms that can leverage the expert human feedback received during deployment time to adapt the robot's uncertainty online. To tackle this, we draw upon online conformal prediction, a distribution-free method for constructing prediction intervals online given a stream of ground-truth labels. Human labels, however, are intermittent in the interactive IL setting. Thus, from the conformal prediction side, we introduce a novel uncertainty quantification algorithm called intermittent quantile tracking (IQT) that leverages a probabilistic model of intermittent labels, maintains asymptotic coverage guarantees, and empirically achieves desired coverage levels. From the interactive IL side, we develop ConformalDAgger, a new approach wherein the robot uses prediction intervals calibrated by IQT as a reliable measure of deployment-time uncertainty to actively query for more expert feedback. We compare ConformalDAgger to prior uncertainty-aware DAgger methods in scenarios where the distribution shift is (and isn't) present because of changes in the expert's policy. We find that in simulated and hardware deployments on a 7DOF robotic manipulator, ConformalDAgger detects high uncertainty when the expert shifts and increases the number of interventions compared to baselines, allowing the robot to more quickly learn the new behavior.

### Measuring the Inconsistency of Large Language Models in Preferential   Ranking
**Authors**: Xiutian Zhao, Ke Wang, Wei Peng

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T14:27:18Z

**Summary**: Despite large language models' (LLMs) recent advancements, their bias and hallucination issues persist, and their ability to offer consistent preferential rankings remains underexplored. This study investigates the capacity of LLMs to provide consistent ordinal preferences, a crucial aspect in scenarios with dense decision space or lacking absolute answers. We introduce a formalization of consistency based on order theory, outlining criteria such as transitivity, asymmetry, reversibility, and independence from irrelevant alternatives. Our diagnostic experiments on selected state-of-the-art LLMs reveal their inability to meet these criteria, indicating a strong positional bias and poor transitivity, with preferences easily swayed by irrelevant alternatives. These findings highlight a significant inconsistency in LLM-generated preferential rankings, underscoring the need for further research to address these limitations.

### Unveiling Molecular Secrets: An LLM-Augmented Linear Model for   Explainable and Calibratable Molecular Property Prediction
**Authors**: Zhuoran Li, Xu Sun, Wanyu Lin, Jiannong Cao

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T14:07:57Z

**Summary**: Explainable molecular property prediction is essential for various scientific fields, such as drug discovery and material science. Despite delivering intrinsic explainability, linear models struggle with capturing complex, non-linear patterns. Large language models (LLMs), on the other hand, yield accurate predictions through powerful inference capabilities yet fail to provide chemically meaningful explanations for their predictions. This work proposes a novel framework, called MoleX, which leverages LLM knowledge to build a simple yet powerful linear model for accurate molecular property prediction with faithful explanations. The core of MoleX is to model complicated molecular structure-property relationships using a simple linear model, augmented by LLM knowledge and a crafted calibration strategy. Specifically, to extract the maximum amount of task-relevant knowledge from LLM embeddings, we employ information bottleneck-inspired fine-tuning and sparsity-inducing dimensionality reduction. These informative embeddings are then used to fit a linear model for explainable inference. Moreover, we introduce residual calibration to address prediction errors stemming from linear models' insufficient expressiveness of complex LLM embeddings, thus recovering the LLM's predictive power and boosting overall accuracy. Theoretically, we provide a mathematical foundation to justify MoleX's explainability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoleX outperforms existing methods in molecular property prediction, establishing a new milestone in predictive performance, explainability, and efficiency. In particular, MoleX enables CPU inference and accelerates large-scale dataset processing, achieving comparable performance 300x faster with 100,000 fewer parameters than LLMs. Additionally, the calibration improves model performance by up to 12.7% without compromising explainability.

### Retriever-and-Memory: Towards Adaptive Note-Enhanced Retrieval-Augmented   Generation
**Authors**: Ruobing Wang, Daren Zha, Shi Yu, Qingfei Zhao, Yuxuan Chen, Yixuan Wang, Shuo Wang, Yukun Yan, Zhenghao Liu, Xu Han, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T14:03:29Z

**Summary**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates issues of the factual errors and hallucinated outputs generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) in open-domain question-answering tasks (OpenQA) via introducing external knowledge. For complex QA, however, existing RAG methods use LLMs to actively predict retrieval timing and directly use the retrieved information for generation, regardless of whether the retrieval timing accurately reflects the actual information needs, or sufficiently considers prior retrieved knowledge, which may result in insufficient information gathering and interaction, yielding low-quality answers. To address these, we propose a generic RAG approach called Adaptive Note-Enhanced RAG (Adaptive-Note) for complex QA tasks, which includes the iterative information collector, adaptive memory reviewer, and task-oriented generator, while following a new Retriever-and-Memory paradigm. Specifically, Adaptive-Note introduces an overarching view of knowledge growth, iteratively gathering new information in the form of notes and updating them into the existing optimal knowledge structure, enhancing high-quality knowledge interactions. In addition, we employ an adaptive, note-based stop-exploration strategy to decide "what to retrieve and when to stop" to encourage sufficient knowledge exploration. We conduct extensive experiments on five complex QA datasets, and the results demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our method and its components. The code and data are at https://github.com/thunlp/Adaptive-Note.

### Which Demographics do LLMs Default to During Annotation?

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T14:02:42Z

**Summary**: Demographics and cultural background of annotators influence the labels they assign in text annotation -- for instance, an elderly woman might find it offensive to read a message addressed to a "bro", but a male teenager might find it appropriate. It is therefore important to acknowledge label variations to not under-represent members of a society. Two research directions developed out of this observation in the context of using large language models (LLM) for data annotations, namely (1) studying biases and inherent knowledge of LLMs and (2) injecting diversity in the output by manipulating the prompt with demographic information. We combine these two strands of research and ask the question to which demographics an LLM resorts to when no demographics is given. To answer this question, we evaluate which attributes of human annotators LLMs inherently mimic. Furthermore, we compare non-demographic conditioned prompts and placebo-conditioned prompts (e.g., "you are an annotator who lives in house number 5") to demographics-conditioned prompts ("You are a 45 year old man and an expert on politeness annotation. How do you rate {instance}"). We study these questions for politeness and offensiveness annotations on the POPQUORN data set, a corpus created in a controlled manner to investigate human label variations based on demographics which has not been used for LLM-based analyses so far. We observe notable influences related to gender, race, and age in demographic prompting, which contrasts with previous studies that found no such effects.

### StructRAG: Boosting Knowledge Intensive Reasoning of LLMs via   Inference-time Hybrid Information Structurization
**Authors**: Zhuoqun Li, Xuanang Chen, Haiyang Yu, Hongyu Lin, Yaojie Lu, Qiaoyu Tang, Fei Huang, Xianpei Han, Le Sun, Yongbin Li

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T13:52:44Z

**Summary**: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a key means to effectively enhance large language models (LLMs) in many knowledge-based tasks. However, existing RAG methods struggle with knowledge-intensive reasoning tasks, because useful information required to these tasks are badly scattered. This characteristic makes it difficult for existing RAG methods to accurately identify key information and perform global reasoning with such noisy augmentation. In this paper, motivated by the cognitive theories that humans convert raw information into various structured knowledge when tackling knowledge-intensive reasoning, we proposes a new framework, StructRAG, which can identify the optimal structure type for the task at hand, reconstruct original documents into this structured format, and infer answers based on the resulting structure. Extensive experiments across various knowledge-intensive tasks show that StructRAG achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly excelling in challenging scenarios, demonstrating its potential as an effective solution for enhancing LLMs in complex real-world applications.

### PoisonBench: Assessing Large Language Model Vulnerability to Data   Poisoning
**Authors**: Tingchen Fu, Mrinank Sharma, Philip Torr, Shay B. Cohen, David Krueger, Fazl Barez

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T13:50:50Z

**Summary**: Preference learning is a central component for aligning current LLMs, but this process can be vulnerable to data poisoning attacks. To address this concern, we introduce PoisonBench, a benchmark for evaluating large language models' susceptibility to data poisoning during preference learning. Data poisoning attacks can manipulate large language model responses to include hidden malicious content or biases, potentially causing the model to generate harmful or unintended outputs while appearing to function normally. We deploy two distinct attack types across eight realistic scenarios, assessing 21 widely-used models. Our findings reveal concerning trends: (1) Scaling up parameter size does not inherently enhance resilience against poisoning attacks; (2) There exists a log-linear relationship between the effects of the attack and the data poison ratio; (3) The effect of data poisoning can generalize to extrapolated triggers that are not included in the poisoned data. These results expose weaknesses in current preference learning techniques, highlighting the urgent need for more robust defenses against malicious models and data manipulation.

### Tally: Non-Intrusive Performance Isolation for Concurrent Deep Learning   Workloads
**Authors**: Wei Zhao, Anand Jayarajan, Gennady Pekhimenko

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T13:49:16Z

**Summary**: GPU underutilization is a significant concern in many production deep learning clusters, leading to prolonged job queues and increased operational expenses. A promising solution to this inefficiency is GPU sharing, which improves resource utilization by allowing multiple workloads to execute concurrently on a single GPU. However, the practical deployment of GPU sharing in production settings faces critical obstacles due to the limitations of existing mechanisms, such as high integration costs, inadequate performance isolation, and limited application compatibility. To address these issues, we introduce \emph{Tally}, a non-intrusive GPU sharing mechanism that provides robust performance isolation and comprehensive workload compatibility. Tally operates as a virtualization layer between applications and GPUs, transparently orchestrating the device execution of concurrent workloads. The key to Tally's robust performance isolation capability lies in its fine-grained thread-block level GPU kernel scheduling strategy, which allows the system to effectively mitigate interference caused by workload co-execution. Our evaluation, conducted on a diverse set of workload combinations, demonstrates that Tally on average incurs a mere $7.2\%$ overhead on the $99^{th}$-percentile latency of high-priority inference tasks when executed concurrently with best-effort training workloads compared to $188.9\%$ overhead exhibited by the state-of-the-art GPU sharing systems like TGS, while achieving over $80\%$ of TGS's system throughput.

### Don't Transform the Code, Code the Transforms: Towards Precise Code   Rewriting using LLMs
**Authors**: Chris Cummins, Volker Seeker, Jordi Armengol-Estap√©, Aram H. Markosyan, Gabriel Synnaeve, Hugh Leather

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T13:45:16Z

**Summary**: Tools for rewriting, refactoring and optimizing code should be fast and correct. Large language models (LLMs), by their nature, possess neither of these qualities. Yet, there remains tremendous opportunity in using LLMs to improve code.   We explore the use of LLMs not to transform code, but to code transforms. We propose a chain-of-thought approach to synthesizing code transformations from a small number of input/output code examples that incorporates execution and feedback. Unlike the direct rewrite approach, LLM-generated transformations are easy to inspect, debug, and validate. The logic of the rewrite is explicitly coded and easy to adapt. The compute required to run code transformations is minute compared to that of LLM rewriting.   We test our approach on 16 Python code transformations and find that LLM- generated transforms are perfectly precise for 7 of them and less imprecise than direct LLM rewriting on the others. We hope to encourage further research to improving the precision of LLM code rewriting.

### Learn Your Reference Model for Real Good Alignment
**Authors**: Alexey Gorbatovski, Boris Shaposhnikov, Alexey Malakhov, Nikita Surnachev, Yaroslav Aksenov, Ian Maksimov, Nikita Balagansky, Daniil Gavrilov

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T13:42:12Z

**Summary**: Despite the fact that offline methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) alignment do not require a direct reward model, they remain susceptible to overoptimization. This issue arises when the trained model deviates excessively from the reference policy, leading to a decrease in sample quality. We propose a new paradigm of offline alignment methods, called Trust Region (including variants TR-DPO, TR-IPO, TR-KTO), which dynamically updates the reference policy throughout the training process. Our results show that TR alignment methods effectively mitigate overoptimization, enabling models to maintain strong performance even when substantially deviating from the initial reference policy. We demonstrate the efficacy of these approaches not only through toy examples that exhibit reduced overoptimization, but also through direct, side-by-side comparisons in specific tasks such as helpful and harmless dialogue, as well as summarization, where they surpass conventional methods. Additionally, we report significant improvements in general-purpose assistant setups with the Llama3 model on the AlpacaEval 2 and Arena-Hard benchmarks, highlighting the advantages of Trust Region methods over classical approaches.

**Summary**: This paper presents a comprehensive overview of the data preparation pipeline developed for the OpenGPT-X project, a large-scale initiative aimed at creating open and high-performance multilingual large language models (LLMs). The project goal is to deliver models that cover all major European languages, with a particular focus on real-world applications within the European Union. We explain all data processing steps, starting with the data selection and requirement definition to the preparation of the final datasets for model training. We distinguish between curated data and web data, as each of these categories is handled by distinct pipelines, with curated data undergoing minimal filtering and web data requiring extensive filtering and deduplication. This distinction guided the development of specialized algorithmic solutions for both pipelines. In addition to describing the processing methodologies, we provide an in-depth analysis of the datasets, increasing transparency and alignment with European data regulations. Finally, we share key insights and challenges faced during the project, offering recommendations for future endeavors in large-scale multilingual data preparation for LLMs.

### Online Learning for Intelligent Thermal Management of   Interference-coupled and Passively Cooled Base Stations
**Authors**: Zhanwei Yu, Yi Zhao, Xiaoli Chu, Di Yuan

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T13:33:53Z

**Summary**: Passively cooled base stations (PCBSs) have emerged to deliver better cost and energy efficiency. However, passive cooling necessitates intelligent thermal control via traffic management, i.e., the instantaneous data traffic or throughput of a PCBS directly impacts its thermal performance. This is particularly challenging for outdoor deployment of PCBSs because the heat dissipation efficiency is uncertain and fluctuates over time. What is more, the PCBSs are interference-coupled in multi-cell scenarios. Thus, a higher-throughput PCBS leads to higher interference to the other PCBSs, which, in turn, would require more resource consumption to meet their respective throughput targets. In this paper, we address online decision-making for maximizing the total downlink throughput for a multi-PCBS system subject to constraints related on operating temperature. We demonstrate that a reinforcement learning (RL) approach, specifically soft actor-critic (SAC), can successfully perform throughput maximization while keeping the PCBSs cool, by adapting the throughput to time-varying heat dissipation conditions. Furthermore, we design a denial and reward mechanism that effectively mitigates the risk of overheating during the exploration phase of RL. Simulation results show that our approach achieves up to 88.6% of the global optimum. This is very promising, as our approach operates without prior knowledge of future heat dissipation efficiency, which is required by the global optimum.

### Superpipeline: A Universal Approach for Reducing GPU Memory Usage in   Large Models
**Authors**: Reza Abbasi, Sernam Lim

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T13:17:05Z

**Summary**: The rapid growth in machine learning models, especially in natural language processing and computer vision, has led to challenges when running these models on hardware with limited resources. This paper introduces Superpipeline, a new framework designed to optimize the execution of large AI models on constrained hardware during both training and inference. Our approach involves dynamically managing model execution by dividing models into individual layers and efficiently transferring these layers between GPU and CPU memory. Superpipeline reduces GPU memory usage by up to 60% in our experiments while maintaining model accuracy and acceptable processing speeds. This allows models that would otherwise exceed available GPU memory to run effectively. Unlike existing solutions that focus mainly on inference or specific model types, Superpipeline can be applied to large language models (LLMs), vision-language models (VLMs), and vision-based models. We tested Superpipeline's performance across various models and hardware setups. The method includes two key parameters that allow fine-tuning the balance between GPU memory use and processing speed. Importantly, Superpipeline does not require retraining or changing model parameters, ensuring that the original model's output remains unchanged. Superpipeline's simplicity and flexibility make it useful for researchers and professionals working with advanced AI models on limited hardware. It enables the use of larger models or bigger batch sizes on existing hardware, potentially speeding up innovation across many machine learning applications. This work marks an important step toward making advanced AI models more accessible and optimizing their deployment in resource-limited environments. The code for Superpipeline is available at https://github.com/abbasiReza/super-pipeline.

### F2A: An Innovative Approach for Prompt Injection by Utilizing Feign   Security Detection Agents
**Authors**: Yupeng Ren

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T12:49:05Z

**Summary**: With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), numerous mature applications of LLMs have emerged in the field of content safety detection. However, we have found that LLMs exhibit blind trust in safety detection agents. The general LLMs can be compromised by hackers with this vulnerability. Hence, this paper proposed an attack named Feign Agent Attack (F2A).Through such malicious forgery methods, adding fake safety detection results into the prompt, the defense mechanism of LLMs can be bypassed, thereby obtaining harmful content and hijacking the normal conversation.Continually, a series of experiments were conducted. In these experiments, the hijacking capability of F2A on LLMs was analyzed and demonstrated, exploring the fundamental reasons why LLMs blindly trust safety detection results. The experiments involved various scenarios where fake safety detection results were injected into prompts, and the responses were closely monitored to understand the extent of the vulnerability. Also, this paper provided a reasonable solution to this attack, emphasizing that it is important for LLMs to critically evaluate the results of augmented agents to prevent the generating harmful content. By doing so, the reliability and security can be significantly improved, protecting the LLMs from F2A.

### OAEI-LLM: A Benchmark Dataset for Understanding Large Language Model   Hallucinations in Ontology Matching
**Authors**: Zhangcheng Qiang, Kerry Taylor, Weiqing Wang, Jing Jiang

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T12:40:50Z

**Summary**: Hallucinations of large language models (LLMs) commonly occur in domain-specific downstream tasks, with no exception in ontology matching (OM). The prevalence of using LLMs for OM raises the need for benchmarks to better understand LLM hallucinations. The OAEI-LLM dataset is an extended version of the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI) datasets that evaluate LLM-specific hallucinations in OM tasks. We outline the methodology used in dataset construction and schema extension, and provide examples of potential use cases.

### Federated Instruction Tuning of LLMs with Domain Coverage Augmentation
**Authors**: Zezhou Wang, Yaxin Du, Zhuzhong Qian, Siheng Chen

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T12:19:57Z

**Summary**: Federated Domain-specific Instruction Tuning (FedDIT) utilizes limited cross-client private data together with server-side public data for instruction augmentation, ultimately boosting model performance within specific domains. To date, the factors affecting FedDIT remain unclear, and existing instruction augmentation methods primarily focus on the centralized setting without considering distributed environments. Our experiments reveal that the cross-client domain coverage, rather than data heterogeneity, drives model performance in FedDIT. In response, we propose FedDCA, which optimizes domain coverage through greedy client center selection and retrieval-based augmentation. For client-side computational efficiency and system scalability, FedDCA$^*$, the variant of FedDCA, utilizes heterogeneous encoders with server-side feature alignment. Extensive experiments across four distinct domains (code, medical, financial, and mathematical) substantiate the effectiveness of both methods. Additionally, we investigate privacy preservation against memory extraction attacks utilizing various amounts of public data. Results show that there is no significant correlation between the volume of public data and the privacy-preserving capability. However, as the fine-tuning rounds increase, the risk of privacy leakage reduces or converges.

### PILLAR: an AI-Powered Privacy Threat Modeling Tool
**Authors**: Majid Mollaeefar, Andrea Bissoli, Silvio Ranise

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T12:13:03Z

**Summary**: The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has unlocked new possibilities for applying artificial intelligence across a wide range of fields, including privacy engineering. As modern applications increasingly handle sensitive user data, safeguarding privacy has become more critical than ever. To protect privacy effectively, potential threats need to be identified and addressed early in the system development process. Frameworks like LINDDUN offer structured approaches for uncovering these risks, but despite their value, they often demand substantial manual effort, expert input, and detailed system knowledge. This makes the process time-consuming and prone to errors. Current privacy threat modeling methods, such as LINDDUN, typically rely on creating and analyzing complex data flow diagrams (DFDs) and system descriptions to pinpoint potential privacy issues. While these approaches are thorough, they can be cumbersome, relying heavily on the precision of the data provided by users. Moreover, they often generate a long list of threats without clear guidance on how to prioritize them, leaving developers unsure of where to focus their efforts. In response to these challenges, we introduce PILLAR (Privacy risk Identification with LINDDUN and LLM Analysis Report), a new tool that integrates LLMs with the LINDDUN framework to streamline and enhance privacy threat modeling. PILLAR automates key parts of the LINDDUN process, such as generating DFDs, classifying threats, and prioritizing risks. By leveraging the capabilities of LLMs, PILLAR can take natural language descriptions of systems and transform them into comprehensive threat models with minimal input from users, reducing the workload on developers and privacy experts while improving the efficiency and accuracy of the process.

### EmoDynamiX: Emotional Support Dialogue Strategy Prediction by Modelling   MiXed Emotions and Discourse Dynamics
**Authors**: Chenwei Wan, Matthieu Labeau, Chlo√© Clavel

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T12:04:11Z

**Summary**: Designing emotionally intelligent conversational systems to provide comfort and advice to people experiencing distress is a compelling area of research. Recently, with advancements in large language models (LLMs), end-to-end dialogue agents without explicit strategy prediction steps have become prevalent. However, implicit strategy planning lacks transparency, and recent studies show that LLMs' inherent preference bias towards certain socio-emotional strategies hinders the delivery of high-quality emotional support. To address this challenge, we propose decoupling strategy prediction from language generation, and introduce a novel dialogue strategy prediction framework, EmoDynamiX, which models the discourse dynamics between user fine-grained emotions and system strategies using a heterogeneous graph for better performance and transparency. Experimental results on two ESC datasets show EmoDynamiX outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods with a significant margin (better proficiency and lower preference bias). Our approach also exhibits better transparency by allowing backtracing of decision making.

### Hespi: A pipeline for automatically detecting information from hebarium   specimen sheets
**Authors**: Robert Turnbull, Emily Fitzgerald, Karen Thompson, Joanne L. Birch

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T11:59:40Z

**Summary**: Specimen associated biodiversity data are sought after for biological, environmental, climate, and conservation sciences. A rate shift is required for the extraction of data from specimen images to eliminate the bottleneck that the reliance on human-mediated transcription of these data represents. We applied advanced computer vision techniques to develop the `Hespi' (HErbarium Specimen sheet PIpeline), which extracts a pre-catalogue subset of collection data on the institutional labels on herbarium specimens from their digital images. The pipeline integrates two object detection models; the first detects bounding boxes around text-based labels and the second detects bounding boxes around text-based data fields on the primary institutional label. The pipeline classifies text-based institutional labels as printed, typed, handwritten, or a combination and applies Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) for data extraction. The recognized text is then corrected against authoritative databases of taxon names. The extracted text is also corrected with the aide of a multimodal Large Language Model (LLM). Hespi accurately detects and extracts text for test datasets including specimen sheet images from international herbaria. The components of the pipeline are modular and users can train their own models with their own data and use them in place of the models provided.

### Verification and Refinement of Natural Language Explanations through   LLM-Symbolic Theorem Proving
**Authors**: Xin Quan, Marco Valentino, Louise A. Dennis, Andr√© Freitas

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T11:54:35Z

**Summary**: Natural language explanations represent a proxy for evaluating explanation-based and multi-step Natural Language Inference (NLI) models. However, assessing the validity of explanations for NLI is challenging as it typically involves the crowd-sourcing of apposite datasets, a process that is time-consuming and prone to logical errors. To address existing limitations, this paper investigates the verification and refinement of natural language explanations through the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Theorem Provers (TPs). Specifically, we present a neuro-symbolic framework, named Explanation-Refiner, that integrates TPs with LLMs to generate and formalise explanatory sentences and suggest potential inference strategies for NLI. In turn, the TP is employed to provide formal guarantees on the logical validity of the explanations and to generate feedback for subsequent improvements. We demonstrate how Explanation-Refiner can be jointly used to evaluate explanatory reasoning, autoformalisation, and error correction mechanisms of state-of-the-art LLMs as well as to automatically enhance the quality of explanations of variable complexity in different domains.

### Developing a Pragmatic Benchmark for Assessing Korean Legal Language   Understanding in Large Language Models
**Authors**: Yeeun Kim, Young Rok Choi, Eunkyung Choi, Jinhwan Choi, Hai Jin Park, Wonseok Hwang

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T11:41:02Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in the legal domain, with GPT-4 even passing the Uniform Bar Exam in the U.S. However their efficacy remains limited for non-standardized tasks and tasks in languages other than English. This underscores the need for careful evaluation of LLMs within each legal system before application. Here, we introduce KBL, a benchmark for assessing the Korean legal language understanding of LLMs, consisting of (1) 7 legal knowledge tasks (510 examples), (2) 4 legal reasoning tasks (288 examples), and (3) the Korean bar exam (4 domains, 53 tasks, 2,510 examples). First two datasets were developed in close collaboration with lawyers to evaluate LLMs in practical scenarios in a certified manner. Furthermore, considering legal practitioners' frequent use of extensive legal documents for research, we assess LLMs in both a closed book setting, where they rely solely on internal knowledge, and a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) setting, using a corpus of Korean statutes and precedents. The results indicate substantial room and opportunities for improvement.

### Beyond Prompts: Dynamic Conversational Benchmarking of Large Language   Models
**Authors**: David Castillo-Bolado, Joseph Davidson, Finlay Gray, Marek Rosa

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T11:32:16Z

**Summary**: We introduce a dynamic benchmarking system for conversational agents that evaluates their performance through a single, simulated, and lengthy user$\leftrightarrow$agent interaction. The interaction is a conversation between the user and agent, where multiple tasks are introduced and then undertaken concurrently. We context switch regularly to interleave the tasks, which constructs a realistic testing scenario in which we assess the Long-Term Memory, Continual Learning, and Information Integration capabilities of the agents. Results from both proprietary and open-source Large-Language Models show that LLMs in general perform well on single-task interactions, but they struggle on the same tasks when they are interleaved. Notably, short-context LLMs supplemented with an LTM system perform as well as or better than those with larger contexts. Our benchmark suggests that there are other challenges for LLMs responding to more natural interactions that contemporary benchmarks have heretofore not been able to capture.

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T11:27:57Z

**Summary**: The increasing demand for highly customized products, as well as flexible production lines, can be seen as trigger for the "fourth industrial revolution", referred to as "Industrie 4.0". Current systems usually rely on wire-line technologies to connect sensors and actuators. To enable a higher flexibility such as moving robots or drones, these connections need to be replaced by wireless technologies in the future. Furthermore, this facilitates the renewal of brownfield deployments to address Industrie 4.0 requirements. This paper proposes representative use cases, which have been examined in the German Tactile Internet 4.0 (TACNET 4.0) research project. In order to analyze these use cases, this paper identifies the main challenges and requirements of communication networks in Industrie 4.0 and discusses the applicability of 5th generation wireless communication systems (5G).

**Authors**: Yunchao Wang, Zihang Fu, Chaoqing Xu, Guodao Sun, Ronghua Liang

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T11:23:26Z

**Summary**: Natural language generation (NLG) models are becoming a highly sought-after research focus in the field of natural language processing (NLP), demonstrating strong capabilities in text generation tasks such as writing and dialogue generation. Despite the impressive performance of NLG models, their complex architecture and extensive model weights result in a lack of interpretability. This limitation hampers their adoption in many critical decision-making scenarios. Fortunately, the intervention of human-computer interaction and visual comprehension provides users with the possibility of opening the "black box". In this paper, we conduct a investigation addressing the roles and limitations of human-computer interactive and visual comprehension in text generation process of NLG models. We present a taxonomy of interaction methods and visualization techniques, providing a structured overview of the three main research subjects and their corresponding six tasks within the application process of large language models (LLMs). Finally, we summarize the shortcomings in the existing work and investigate the key challenges and emerging opportunities in the era of LLMs.

### Adapting Large Language Models for Document-Level Machine Translation
**Authors**: Minghao Wu, Thuy-Trang Vu, Lizhen Qu, George Foster, Gholamreza Haffari

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T10:48:15Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Recent research indicates that moderately-sized LLMs often outperform larger ones after task-specific fine-tuning. This study focuses on adapting LLMs for document-level machine translation (DocMT) for specific language pairs. We first investigate the impact of prompt strategies on translation performance and then conduct extensive experiments using two fine-tuning methods, three LLM backbones, and 18 translation tasks across nine language pairs. Our results show that specialized models can sometimes surpass GPT-4 in translation performance but still face issues like off-target translation due to error propagation in decoding. We provide an in-depth analysis of these LLMs tailored for DocMT, examining translation errors, discourse phenomena, strategies for training and inference, the data efficiency of parallel documents, recent test set evaluations, and zero-shot crosslingual transfer. Our findings highlight the strengths and limitations of LLM-based DocMT models and provide a foundation for future research.

### SocialGaze: Improving the Integration of Human Social Norms in Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Anvesh Rao Vijjini, Rakesh R. Menon, Jiayi Fu, Shashank Srivastava, Snigdha Chaturvedi

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T10:35:58Z

**Summary**: While much research has explored enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in the last few years, there is a gap in understanding the alignment of these models with social values and norms. We introduce the task of judging social acceptance. Social acceptance requires models to judge and rationalize the acceptability of people's actions in social situations. For example, is it socially acceptable for a neighbor to ask others in the community to keep their pets indoors at night? We find that LLMs' understanding of social acceptance is often misaligned with human consensus. To alleviate this, we introduce SocialGaze, a multi-step prompting framework, in which a language model verbalizes a social situation from multiple perspectives before forming a judgment. Our experiments demonstrate that the SocialGaze approach improves the alignment with human judgments by up to 11 F1 points with the GPT-3.5 model. We also identify biases and correlations in LLMs in assigning blame that is related to features such as the gender (males are significantly more likely to be judged unfairly) and age (LLMs are more aligned with humans for older narrators).

**Authors**: Sheng Yang, Yurong Wu, Yan Gao, Zineng Zhou, Bin Benjamin Zhu, Xiaodi Sun, Jian-Guang Lou, Zhiming Ding, Anbang Hu, Yuan Fang, Yunsong Li, Junyan Chen, Linjun Yang

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T10:34:28Z

**Summary**: Prompt engineering is very important to enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs). When dealing with complex issues, prompt engineers tend to distill multiple patterns from examples and inject relevant solutions to optimize the prompts, achieving satisfying results. However, existing automatic prompt optimization techniques are only limited to producing single flow instructions, struggling with handling diverse patterns. In this paper, we present AMPO, an automatic prompt optimization method that can iteratively develop a multi-branched prompt using failure cases as feedback. Our goal is to explore a novel way of structuring prompts with multi-branches to better handle multiple patterns in complex tasks, for which we introduce three modules: Pattern Recognition, Branch Adjustment, and Branch Pruning. In experiments across five tasks, AMPO consistently achieves the best results. Additionally, our approach demonstrates significant optimization efficiency due to our adoption of a minimal search strategy.

### JavaBench: A Benchmark of Object-Oriented Code Generation for Evaluating   Large Language Models
**Authors**: Jialun Cao, Zhiyong Chen, Jiarong Wu, Shing-chi Cheung, Chang Xu

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T10:27:16Z

**Summary**: Code generation benchmarks such as HumanEval are widely adopted to evaluate LLMs' capabilities. However, after consolidating the latest 24 benchmarks, we noticed three significant imbalances. First, imbalanced programming language. 95.8% of benchmarks involve Python, while only 5 benchmarks involve Java. Second, imbalanced code granularity. Function-/statement-level benchmarks account for over 83.3% of benchmarks. Only a mere handful extends to class-/project-levels, and all are limited to Python. Third, lacking advanced features. Existing benchmarks primarily assess basic coding skills, while overlooking advanced Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) features (i.e., encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism).   To fill these gaps, we propose JavaBench, a project-level Java benchmark that exercises OOP features. It comprises four Java projects with 389 methods in 106 Java classes. The test coverage is up to 92%, and JavaBench is attested by 282 undergraduate students, reaching a 90.93/100 average score (i.e., pass rate against the test suite), ensuring the quality of documentation, code skeleton, and tests. To better evaluate LLM's capability against JavaBench, we introduce a systematic evaluation design covering three context settings and five synthesis strategies at two granularities using three hierarchical metrics. Our extensive experiment yields several interesting findings. First, we noticed that regarding project-level Java programming, LLMs are far behind undergraduate students (no project can be correctly completed by any studied LLMs, and at most 41.17% Pass@5 in a more relaxed evaluation). Second, using method signature as prompt context may strike an ideal balance for project-level code generation. JavaBench is publicly available at https://github.com/java-bench/JavaBench.

### Chain-of-Restoration: Multi-Task Image Restoration Models are Zero-Shot   Step-by-Step Universal Image Restorers
**Authors**: Jin Cao, Deyu Meng, Xiangyong Cao

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T10:21:42Z

**Summary**: Despite previous works typically targeting isolated degradation types, recent research has increasingly focused on addressing composite degradations which involve a complex interplay of multiple different isolated degradations. Recognizing the challenges posed by the exponential number of possible degradation combinations, we propose Universal Image Restoration (UIR), a new task setting that requires models to be trained on a set of degradation bases and then remove any degradation that these bases can potentially compose in a zero-shot manner. Inspired by the Chain-of-Thought which prompts LLMs to address problems step-by-step, we propose the Chain-of-Restoration (CoR), which instructs models to step-by-step remove unknown composite degradations. By integrating a simple Degradation Discriminator into pre-trained multi-task models, CoR facilitates the process where models remove one degradation basis per step, continuing this process until the image is fully restored from the unknown composite degradation. Extensive experiments show that CoR significantly improves model performance in removing composite degradations, achieving results comparable to or surpassing those of State-of-The-Art (SoTA) methods trained on all degradations. The code will be released at https://github.com/toummHus/Chain-of-Restoration.

### DeltaDQ: Ultra-High Delta Compression for Fine-Tuned LLMs via Group-wise   Dropout and Separate Quantization
**Authors**: Yanfeng Jiang, Zelan Yang, Bohua Chen, Shen Li, Yong Li, Tao Li

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T09:44:16Z

**Summary**: Large language models achieve exceptional performance on various downstream tasks through supervised fine-tuning. However, the diversity of downstream tasks and practical requirements makes deploying multiple full-parameter fine-tuned models challenging. Current methods that compress the delta weight struggle to achieve ultra-high compression, failing to minimize the deployment overhead. To address the above issue, we propose a novel distribution-driven delta compression framework DeltaDQ, which utilizes Group-wise Dropout and Separate Quantization to achieve ultra-high compression for the delta weight. We have observed that the matrix-computed intermediate results for the delta weight exhibit extremely small variance and min-max range characteristics, referred to as Balanced Intermediate Results. Exploiting this phenomenon, we introduce Group-wise Dropout to perform dropout on the delta weight using an optimal group size. Furthermore, using Separate Quantization, sparse weights are quantized and decomposed to achieve a lower bit. Experimental results show that DeltaDQ achieves 16x compression with improved accuracy compared to baselines for WizardMath and WizardCoder models across different parameter scales. Moreover, DeltaDQ demonstrates the ability for ultra-high compression ratio, achieving 128x compression for the WizardMath-7B model and 512x compression for the WizardMath-70B model.

### ShortGPT: Layers in Large Language Models are More Redundant Than You   Expect
**Authors**: Xin Men, Mingyu Xu, Qingyu Zhang, Bingning Wang, Hongyu Lin, Yaojie Lu, Xianpei Han, Weipeng Chen

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T09:43:32Z

**Summary**: As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to advance in performance, their size has escalated significantly, with current LLMs containing billions or even trillions of parameters. However, in this study, we discovered that many layers of LLMs exhibit high similarity, and some layers play a negligible role in network functionality. Based on this observation, we define a metric called Block Influence (BI) to gauge the significance of each layer in LLMs. We then propose a straightforward pruning approach: layer removal, in which we directly delete the redundant layers in LLMs based on their BI scores. Experiments demonstrate that our method, which we call ShortGPT, significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in model pruning. Moreover, ShortGPT is orthogonal to quantization-like methods, enabling further reduction in parameters and computation. The ability to achieve better results through simple layer removal, as opposed to more complex pruning techniques, suggests a high degree of redundancy in the model architecture.

### Influence of Solution Efficiency and Valence of Instruction on Additive   and Subtractive Solution Strategies in Humans and GPT-4
**Authors**: Lydia Uhler, Verena Jordan, J√ºrgen Buder, Markus Huff, Frank Papenmeier

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T09:42:34Z

**Summary**: Generative artificial intelligences, especially large language models (LLMs), are increasingly being used, necessitating transparency about their capabilities. While prior studies have shown addition biases in humans (Adams et al., 2021) and OpenAI's GPT-3 (Winter et al., 2023), this study extends the research by comparing human and GPT-4 problem-solving across both spatial and linguistic tasks, with variations in solution efficiency and valence of task instruction. Four preregistered experiments with 588 participants from the U.S. and 680 GPT-4 iterations revealed a stronger tendency towards additive transformations in GPT-4 than in humans. Human participants were less likely to use additive strategies when subtraction was relatively more efficient than when addition and subtraction were equally efficient. GPT-4 exhibited the opposite behavior, with a strong addition bias when subtraction was more efficient. In terms of valence of task instruction, GPT-4's use of additive strategies increased when instructed to "improve" (positive valence) rather than "edit" (neutral valence). These findings demonstrate that biases in human problem-solving are amplified in the outputs of GPT-4, and that LLM's solution strategies differ from human efficiency-based strategies. This highlights the evolving limitations of LLMs and the need for caution when using them in real-world applications.

### QEFT: Quantization for Efficient Fine-Tuning of LLMs
**Authors**: Changhun Lee, Jun-gyu Jin, Younghyun Cho, Eunhyeok Park

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T09:39:33Z

**Summary**: With the rapid growth in the use of fine-tuning for large language models (LLMs), optimizing fine-tuning while keeping inference efficient has become highly important. However, this is a challenging task as it requires improvements in all aspects, including inference speed, fine-tuning speed, memory consumption, and, most importantly, model quality. Previous studies have attempted to achieve this by combining quantization with fine-tuning, but they have failed to enhance all four aspects simultaneously. In this study, we propose a new lightweight technique called Quantization for Efficient Fine-Tuning (QEFT). QEFT accelerates both inference and fine-tuning, is supported by robust theoretical foundations, offers high flexibility, and maintains good hardware compatibility. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that QEFT matches the quality and versatility of full-precision parameter-efficient fine-tuning, while using fewer resources. Our code is available at https://github.com/xvyaward/qeft.

### RePD: Defending Jailbreak Attack through a Retrieval-based Prompt   Decomposition Process
**Authors**: Peiran Wang, Xiaogeng Liu, Chaowei Xiao

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T09:39:11Z

**Summary**: In this study, we introduce RePD, an innovative attack Retrieval-based Prompt Decomposition framework designed to mitigate the risk of jailbreak attacks on large language models (LLMs). Despite rigorous pretraining and finetuning focused on ethical alignment, LLMs are still susceptible to jailbreak exploits. RePD operates on a one-shot learning model, wherein it accesses a database of pre-collected jailbreak prompt templates to identify and decompose harmful inquiries embedded within user prompts. This process involves integrating the decomposition of the jailbreak prompt into the user's original query into a one-shot learning example to effectively teach the LLM to discern and separate malicious components. Consequently, the LLM is equipped to first neutralize any potentially harmful elements before addressing the user's prompt in a manner that aligns with its ethical guidelines. RePD is versatile and compatible with a variety of open-source LLMs acting as agents. Through comprehensive experimentation with both harmful and benign prompts, we have demonstrated the efficacy of our proposed RePD in enhancing the resilience of LLMs against jailbreak attacks, without compromising their performance in responding to typical user requests.

**Summary**: We find that, simply via a sampling-and-voting method, the performance of large language models (LLMs) scales with the number of agents instantiated. Also, this method, termed as Agent Forest, is orthogonal to existing complicated methods to further enhance LLMs, while the degree of enhancement is correlated to the task difficulty. We conduct comprehensive experiments on a wide range of LLM benchmarks to verify the presence of our finding, and to study the properties that can facilitate its occurrence.

**Summary**: Despite the advances in the abstractive summarization task using Large Language Models (LLM), there is a lack of research that asses their abilities to easily adapt to different domains. We evaluate the domain adaptation abilities of a wide range of LLMs on the summarization task across various domains in both fine-tuning and in-context learning settings. We also present AdaptEval, the first domain adaptation evaluation suite. AdaptEval includes a domain benchmark and a set of metrics to facilitate the analysis of domain adaptation. Our results demonstrate that LLMs exhibit comparable performance in the in-context learning setting, regardless of their parameter scale.

### Towards Generating Executable Metamorphic Relations Using Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Seung Yeob Shin, Fabrizio Pastore, Domenico Bianculli, Alexandra Baicoianu

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T09:07:22Z

**Summary**: Metamorphic testing (MT) has proven to be a successful solution to automating testing and addressing the oracle problem. However, it entails manually deriving metamorphic relations (MRs) and converting them into an executable form; these steps are time-consuming and may prevent the adoption of MT. In this paper, we propose an approach for automatically deriving executable MRs (EMRs) from requirements using large language models (LLMs). Instead of merely asking the LLM to produce EMRs, our approach relies on a few-shot prompting strategy to instruct the LLM to perform activities in the MT process, by providing requirements and API specifications, as one would do with software engineers. To assess the feasibility of our approach, we conducted a questionnaire-based survey in collaboration with Siemens Industry Software, a worldwide leader in providing industry software and services, focusing on four of their software applications. Additionally, we evaluated the accuracy of the generated EMRs for a Web application. The outcomes of our study are highly promising, as they demonstrate the capability of our approach to generate MRs and EMRs that are both comprehensible and pertinent for testing purposes.

### Robots Can Multitask Too: Integrating a Memory Architecture and LLMs for   Enhanced Cross-Task Robot Action Generation
**Authors**: Hassan Ali, Philipp Allgeuer, Carlo Mazzola, Giulia Belgiovine, Burak Can Kaplan, Luk√°≈° Gajdo≈°ech, Stefan Wermter

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T08:58:20Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been recently used in robot applications for grounding LLM common-sense reasoning with the robot's perception and physical abilities. In humanoid robots, memory also plays a critical role in fostering real-world embodiment and facilitating long-term interactive capabilities, especially in multi-task setups where the robot must remember previous task states, environment states, and executed actions. In this paper, we address incorporating memory processes with LLMs for generating cross-task robot actions, while the robot effectively switches between tasks. Our proposed dual-layered architecture features two LLMs, utilizing their complementary skills of reasoning and following instructions, combined with a memory model inspired by human cognition. Our results show a significant improvement in performance over a baseline of five robotic tasks, demonstrating the potential of integrating memory with LLMs for combining the robot's action and perception for adaptive task execution.

### Words as Beacons: Guiding RL Agents with High-Level Language Prompts
**Authors**: Unai Ruiz-Gonzalez, Alain Andres, Pedro G. Bascoy, Javier Del Ser

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T08:54:45Z

**Summary**: Sparse reward environments in reinforcement learning (RL) pose significant challenges for exploration, often leading to inefficient or incomplete learning processes. To tackle this issue, this work proposes a teacher-student RL framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) as "teachers" to guide the agent's learning process by decomposing complex tasks into subgoals. Due to their inherent capability to understand RL environments based on a textual description of structure and purpose, LLMs can provide subgoals to accomplish the task defined for the environment in a similar fashion to how a human would do. In doing so, three types of subgoals are proposed: positional targets relative to the agent, object representations, and language-based instructions generated directly by the LLM. More importantly, we show that it is possible to query the LLM only during the training phase, enabling agents to operate within the environment without any LLM intervention. We assess the performance of this proposed framework by evaluating three state-of-the-art open-source LLMs (Llama, DeepSeek, Qwen) eliciting subgoals across various procedurally generated environment of the MiniGrid benchmark. Experimental results demonstrate that this curriculum-based approach accelerates learning and enhances exploration in complex tasks, achieving up to 30 to 200 times faster convergence in training steps compared to recent baselines designed for sparse reward environments.

### Measuring and Enhancing Trustworthiness of LLMs in RAG through Grounded   Attributions and Learning to Refuse
**Authors**: Maojia Song, Shang Hong Sim, Rishabh Bhardwaj, Hai Leong Chieu, Navonil Majumder, Soujanya Poria

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T08:53:31Z

**Summary**: LLMs are an integral component of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. While many studies focus on evaluating the overall quality of end-to-end RAG systems, there is a gap in understanding the appropriateness of LLMs for the RAG task. To address this, we introduce Trust-Score, a holistic metric that evaluates the trustworthiness of LLMs within the RAG framework. Our results show that various prompting methods, such as in-context learning, fail to effectively adapt LLMs to the RAG task as measured by Trust-Score. Consequently, we propose Trust-Align, a method to align LLMs for improved Trust-Score performance. The LLaMA-3 family, aligned using our method, significantly outperforms open-source LLMs of similar sizes on ASQA (up 14.0), QAMPARI (up 28.9), and ELI5 (up 13.7). We also demonstrate the effectiveness of Trust-Align across different open-weight models, including the LLaMA series (1b to 8b), Qwen-2.5 series (0.5b to 7b), and Phi3.5 (3.8b). We release our code at \url{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/trust-align}

### LLMs hallucinate graphs too: a structural perspective
**Authors**: Erwan Le Merrer, Gilles Tredan

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T08:29:07Z

**Summary**: It is known that LLMs do hallucinate, that is, they return incorrect information as facts. In this paper, we introduce the possibility to study these hallucinations under a structured form: graphs. Hallucinations in this context are incorrect outputs when prompted for well known graphs from the literature (e.g. Karate club, Les Mis\'erables, graph atlas). These hallucinated graphs have the advantage of being much richer than the factual accuracy -- or not -- of a statement; this paper thus argues that such rich hallucinations can be used to characterize the outputs of LLMs. Our first contribution observes the diversity of topological hallucinations from major modern LLMs. Our second contribution is the proposal of a metric for the amplitude of such hallucinations: the Graph Atlas Distance, that is the average graph edit distance from several graphs in the graph atlas set. We compare this metric to the Hallucination Leaderboard, a hallucination rank that leverages 10,000 times more prompts to obtain its ranking.

### Controllable Preference Optimization: Toward Controllable   Multi-Objective Alignment
**Authors**: Yiju Guo, Ganqu Cui, Lifan Yuan, Ning Ding, Zexu Sun, Bowen Sun, Huimin Chen, Ruobing Xie, Jie Zhou, Yankai Lin, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T08:21:50Z

**Summary**: Alignment in artificial intelligence pursues the consistency between model responses and human preferences as well as values. In practice, the multifaceted nature of human preferences inadvertently introduces what is known as the "alignment tax" -a compromise where enhancements in alignment within one objective (e.g.,harmlessness) can diminish performance in others (e.g.,helpfulness). However, existing alignment techniques are mostly unidirectional, leading to suboptimal trade-offs and poor flexibility over various objectives. To navigate this challenge, we argue the prominence of grounding LLMs with evident preferences. We introduce controllable preference optimization (CPO), which explicitly specifies preference scores for different objectives, thereby guiding the model to generate responses that meet the requirements. Our experimental analysis reveals that the aligned models can provide responses that match various preferences among the "3H" (helpfulness, honesty, harmlessness) desiderata. Furthermore, by introducing diverse data and alignment goals, we surpass baseline methods in aligning with single objectives, hence mitigating the impact of the alignment tax and achieving improvements in multi-objective alignment.

### CMD: a framework for Context-aware Model self-Detoxification
**Authors**: Zecheng Tang, Keyan Zhou, Juntao Li, Yuyang Ding, Pinzheng Wang, Bowen Yan, Rejie Hua, Min Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T08:11:10Z

**Summary**: Text detoxification aims to minimize the risk of language models producing toxic content. Existing detoxification methods of directly constraining the model output or further training the model on the non-toxic corpus fail to achieve a decent balance between detoxification effectiveness and generation quality. This issue stems from the neglect of constrain imposed by the context since language models are designed to generate output that closely matches the context while detoxification methods endeavor to ensure the safety of the output even if it semantically deviates from the context. In view of this, we introduce a Context-aware Model self-Detoxification~(CMD) framework that pays attention to both the context and the detoxification process, i.e., first detoxifying the context and then making the language model generate along the safe context. Specifically, CMD framework involves two phases: utilizing language models to synthesize data and applying these data for training. We also introduce a toxic contrastive loss that encourages the model generation away from the negative toxic samples. Experiments on various LLMs have verified the effectiveness of our MSD framework, which can yield the best performance compared to baselines.

### Can Graph Learning Improve Planning in LLM-based Agents?
**Authors**: Xixi Wu, Yifei Shen, Caihua Shan, Kaitao Song, Siwei Wang, Bohang Zhang, Jiarui Feng, Hong Cheng, Wei Chen, Yun Xiong, Dongsheng Li

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T08:03:04Z

**Summary**: Task planning in language agents is emerging as an important research topic alongside the development of large language models (LLMs). It aims to break down complex user requests in natural language into solvable sub-tasks, thereby fulfilling the original requests. In this context, the sub-tasks can be naturally viewed as a graph, where the nodes represent the sub-tasks, and the edges denote the dependencies among them. Consequently, task planning is a decision-making problem that involves selecting a connected path or subgraph within the corresponding graph and invoking it. In this paper, we explore graph learning-based methods for task planning, a direction that is orthogonal to the prevalent focus on prompt design. Our interest in graph learning stems from a theoretical discovery: the biases of attention and auto-regressive loss impede LLMs' ability to effectively navigate decision-making on graphs, which is adeptly addressed by graph neural networks (GNNs). This theoretical insight led us to integrate GNNs with LLMs to enhance overall performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GNN-based methods surpass existing solutions even without training, and minimal training can further enhance their performance. The performance gain increases with a larger task graph size.

### MergePrint: Robust Fingerprinting against Merging Large Language Models
**Authors**: Shojiro Yamabe, Tsubasa Takahashi, Futa Waseda, Koki Wataoka

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T08:00:49Z

**Summary**: As the cost of training large language models (LLMs) rises, protecting their intellectual property has become increasingly critical. Model merging, which integrates multiple expert models into a single model capable of performing multiple tasks, presents a growing risk of unauthorized and malicious usage. While fingerprinting techniques have been studied for asserting model ownership, existing methods have primarily focused on fine-tuning, leaving model merging underexplored. To address this gap, we propose a novel fingerprinting method MergePrint that embeds robust fingerprints designed to preserve ownership claims even after model merging. By optimizing against a pseudo-merged model, which simulates post-merged model weights, MergePrint generates fingerprints that remain detectable after merging. Additionally, we optimize the fingerprint inputs to minimize performance degradation, enabling verification through specific outputs from targeted inputs. This approach provides a practical fingerprinting strategy for asserting ownership in cases of misappropriation through model merging.

### StraGo: Harnessing Strategic Guidance for Prompt Optimization
**Authors**: Yurong Wu, Yan Gao, Bin Benjamin Zhu, Zineng Zhou, Xiaodi Sun, Sheng Yang, Jian-Guang Lou, Zhiming Ding, Linjun Yang

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T07:55:42Z

**Summary**: Prompt engineering is pivotal for harnessing the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) across diverse applications. While existing prompt optimization methods improve prompt effectiveness, they often lead to prompt drifting, where newly generated prompts can adversely impact previously successful cases while addressing failures. Furthermore, these methods tend to rely heavily on LLMs' intrinsic capabilities for prompt optimization tasks. In this paper, we introduce StraGo (Strategic-Guided Optimization), a novel approach designed to mitigate prompt drifting by leveraging insights from both successful and failed cases to identify critical factors for achieving optimization objectives. StraGo employs a how-to-do methodology, integrating in-context learning to formulate specific, actionable strategies that provide detailed, step-by-step guidance for prompt optimization. Extensive experiments conducted across a range of tasks, including reasoning, natural language understanding, domain-specific knowledge, and industrial applications, demonstrate StraGo's superior performance. It establishes a new state-of-the-art in prompt optimization, showcasing its ability to deliver stable and effective prompt improvements.

### Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models using Semantic   Knowledge Tuning
**Authors**: Nusrat Jahan Prottasha, Asif Mahmud, Md. Shohanur Islam Sobuj, Prakash Bhat, Md Kowsher, Niloofar Yousefi, Ozlem Ozmen Garibay

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T07:55:09Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are gaining significant popularity in recent years for specialized tasks using prompts due to their low computational cost. Standard methods like prefix tuning utilize special, modifiable tokens that lack semantic meaning and require extensive training for best performance, often falling short. In this context, we propose a novel method called Semantic Knowledge Tuning (SK-Tuning) for prompt and prefix tuning that employs meaningful words instead of random tokens. This method involves using a fixed LLM to understand and process the semantic content of the prompt through zero-shot capabilities. Following this, it integrates the processed prompt with the input text to improve the model's performance on particular tasks. Our experimental results show that SK-Tuning exhibits faster training times, fewer parameters, and superior performance on tasks such as text classification and understanding compared to other tuning methods. This approach offers a promising method for optimizing the efficiency and effectiveness of LLMs in processing language tasks.

### VERIFIED: A Video Corpus Moment Retrieval Benchmark for Fine-Grained   Video Understanding
**Authors**: Houlun Chen, Xin Wang, Hong Chen, Zeyang Zhang, Wei Feng, Bin Huang, Jia Jia, Wenwu Zhu

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T07:42:36Z

**Summary**: Existing Video Corpus Moment Retrieval (VCMR) is limited to coarse-grained understanding, which hinders precise video moment localization when given fine-grained queries. In this paper, we propose a more challenging fine-grained VCMR benchmark requiring methods to localize the best-matched moment from the corpus with other partially matched candidates. To improve the dataset construction efficiency and guarantee high-quality data annotations, we propose VERIFIED, an automatic \underline{V}id\underline{E}o-text annotation pipeline to generate captions with \underline{R}el\underline{I}able \underline{FI}n\underline{E}-grained statics and \underline{D}ynamics. Specifically, we resort to large language models (LLM) and large multimodal models (LMM) with our proposed Statics and Dynamics Enhanced Captioning modules to generate diverse fine-grained captions for each video. To filter out the inaccurate annotations caused by the LLM hallucination, we propose a Fine-Granularity Aware Noise Evaluator where we fine-tune a video foundation model with disturbed hard-negatives augmented contrastive and matching losses. With VERIFIED, we construct a more challenging fine-grained VCMR benchmark containing Charades-FIG, DiDeMo-FIG, and ActivityNet-FIG which demonstrate a high level of annotation quality. We evaluate several state-of-the-art VCMR models on the proposed dataset, revealing that there is still significant scope for fine-grained video understanding in VCMR. Code and Datasets are in \href{https://github.com/hlchen23/VERIFIED}{https://github.com/hlchen23/VERIFIED}.

### Retraining-Free Merging of Sparse Mixture-of-Experts via Hierarchical   Clustering
**Authors**: I-Chun Chen, Hsu-Shen Liu, Wei-Fang Sun, Chen-Hao Chao, Yen-Chang Hsu, Chun-Yi Lee

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T07:36:14Z

**Summary**: Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) models represent a significant breakthrough in large language model development. These models enable performance improvements without a proportional increase in inference costs. By selectively activating a small set of parameters during task execution, SMoEs enhance model capacity. However, their deployment remains challenging due to the substantial memory footprint required to accommodate the growing number of experts. This constraint renders them less feasible in environments with limited hardware resources. To address this challenge, we propose Hierarchical Clustering for Sparsely activated Mixture of Experts (HC-SMoE), a task-agnostic expert merging framework that reduces SMoE model parameters without retraining. Unlike previous methods, HC-SMoE employs hierarchical clustering based on expert outputs. This approach ensures that the merging process remains unaffected by routing decisions. The output-based clustering strategy captures functional similarities between experts, offering an adaptable solution for models with numerous experts. We validate our approach through extensive experiments on eight zero-shot language tasks and demonstrate its effectiveness in large-scale SMoE models such as Qwen and Mixtral. Our comprehensive results demonstrate that HC-SMoE consistently achieves strong performance, which highlights its potential for real-world deployment.

### SPO: Multi-Dimensional Preference Sequential Alignment With Implicit   Reward Modeling
**Authors**: Xingzhou Lou, Junge Zhang, Jian Xie, Lifeng Liu, Dong Yan, Kaiqi Huang

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T06:18:30Z

**Summary**: Human preference alignment is critical in building powerful and reliable large language models (LLMs). However, current methods either ignore the multi-dimensionality of human preferences (e.g. helpfulness and harmlessness) or struggle with the complexity of managing multiple reward models. To address these issues, we propose Sequential Preference Optimization (SPO), a method that sequentially fine-tunes LLMs to align with multiple dimensions of human preferences. SPO avoids explicit reward modeling, directly optimizing the models to align with nuanced human preferences. We theoretically derive closed-form optimal SPO policy and loss function. Gradient analysis is conducted to show how SPO manages to fine-tune the LLMs while maintaining alignment on previously optimized dimensions. Empirical results on LLMs of different size and multiple evaluation datasets demonstrate that SPO successfully aligns LLMs across multiple dimensions of human preferences and significantly outperforms the baselines.

### Humanity in AI: Detecting the Personality of Large Language Models
**Authors**: Baohua Zhan, Yongyi Huang, Wenyao Cui, Huaping Zhang, Jianyun Shang

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T05:53:11Z

**Summary**: Questionnaires are a common method for detecting the personality of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, their reliability is often compromised by two main issues: hallucinations (where LLMs produce inaccurate or irrelevant responses) and the sensitivity of responses to the order of the presented options. To address these issues, we propose combining text mining with questionnaires method. Text mining can extract psychological features from the LLMs' responses without being affected by the order of options. Furthermore, because this method does not rely on specific answers, it reduces the influence of hallucinations. By normalizing the scores from both methods and calculating the root mean square error, our experiment results confirm the effectiveness of this approach. To further investigate the origins of personality traits in LLMs, we conduct experiments on both pre-trained language models (PLMs), such as BERT and GPT, as well as conversational models (ChatLLMs), such as ChatGPT. The results show that LLMs do contain certain personalities, for example, ChatGPT and ChatGLM exhibit the personality traits of 'Conscientiousness'. Additionally, we find that the personalities of LLMs are derived from their pre-trained data. The instruction data used to train ChatLLMs can enhance the generation of data containing personalities and expose their hidden personality. We compare the results with the human average personality score, and we find that the personality of FLAN-T5 in PLMs and ChatGPT in ChatLLMs is more similar to that of a human, with score differences of 0.34 and 0.22, respectively.

### Sentiment Reasoning for Healthcare
**Authors**: Khai-Nguyen Nguyen, Khai Le-Duc, Bach Phan Tat, Duy Le, Long Vo-Dang, Truong-Son Hy

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T05:43:19Z

**Summary**: Transparency in AI healthcare decision-making is crucial for building trust among AI and users. Incorporating reasoning capabilities enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand emotions in context, handle nuanced language, and infer unstated sentiments. In this work, we introduce a new task -- Sentiment Reasoning -- for both speech and text modalities, along with our proposed multimodal multitask framework and dataset. Sentiment Reasoning is an auxiliary task in sentiment analysis where the model predicts both the sentiment label and generates the rationale behind it based on the input transcript. Our study conducted on both human transcripts and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) transcripts shows that Sentiment Reasoning helps improve model transparency by providing rationale for model prediction with quality semantically comparable to humans while also improving model performance (1% increase in both accuracy and macro-F1) via rationale-augmented fine-tuning. Also, no significant difference in the semantic quality of generated rationales between human and ASR transcripts. All code, data (English-translated and Vietnamese) and models are published online: https://github.com/leduckhai/MultiMed.

### Can LLM Graph Reasoning Generalize beyond Pattern Memorization?
**Authors**: Yizhuo Zhang, Heng Wang, Shangbin Feng, Zhaoxuan Tan, Xiaochuang Han, Tianxing He, Yulia Tsvetkov

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T05:42:01Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate great potential for problems with implicit graphical structures, while recent works seek to enhance the graph reasoning capabilities of LLMs through specialized instruction tuning. The resulting 'graph LLMs' are evaluated with in-distribution settings only, thus it remains underexplored whether LLMs are learning generalizable graph reasoning skills or merely memorizing patterns in the synthetic training data. To this end, we propose the NLGift benchmark, an evaluation suite of LLM graph reasoning generalization: whether LLMs could go beyond semantic, numeric, structural, reasoning patterns in the synthetic training data and improve utility on real-world graph-based tasks. Extensive experiments with two LLMs across four graph reasoning tasks demonstrate that while generalization on simple patterns (semantic, numeric) is somewhat satisfactory, LLMs struggle to generalize across reasoning and real-world patterns, casting doubt on the benefit of synthetic graph tuning for real-world tasks with underlying network structures. We explore three strategies to improve LLM graph reasoning generalization, and we find that while post-training alignment is most promising for real-world tasks, empowering LLM graph reasoning to go beyond pattern memorization remains an open research question.

### Towards Synergistic, Generalized, and Efficient Dual-System for Robotic   Manipulation
**Authors**: Qingwen Bu, Hongyang Li, Li Chen, Jisong Cai, Jia Zeng, Heming Cui, Maoqing Yao, Yu Qiao

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T05:38:13Z

**Summary**: The increasing demand for versatile robotic systems to operate in diverse and dynamic environments has emphasized the importance of a generalist policy, which leverages a large cross-embodiment data corpus to facilitate broad adaptability and high-level reasoning. However, the generalist would struggle with inefficient inference and cost-expensive training. The specialist policy, instead, is curated for specific domain data and excels at task-level precision with efficiency. Yet, it lacks the generalization capacity for a wide range of applications. Inspired by these observations, we introduce RoboDual, a synergistic dual-system that supplements the merits of both generalist and specialist policy. A diffusion transformer-based specialist is devised for multi-step action rollouts, exquisitely conditioned on the high-level task understanding and discretized action output of a vision-language-action (VLA) based generalist. Compared to OpenVLA, RoboDual achieves 26.7% improvement in real-world setting and 12% gain on CALVIN by introducing a specialist policy with merely 20M trainable parameters. It maintains strong performance with 5% of demonstration data only, and enables a 3.8 times higher control frequency in real-world deployment. Code would be made publicly available.

### Enhancing Large Language Model-based Speech Recognition by   Contextualization for Rare and Ambiguous Words
**Authors**: Kento Nozawa, Takashi Masuko, Toru Taniguchi

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T05:31:50Z

**Summary**: We develop a large language model (LLM) based automatic speech recognition (ASR) system that can be contextualized by providing keywords as prior information in text prompts. We adopt decoder-only architecture and use our in-house LLM, PLaMo-100B, pre-trained from scratch using datasets dominated by Japanese and English texts as the decoder. We adopt a pre-trained Whisper encoder as an audio encoder, and the audio embeddings from the audio encoder are projected to the text embedding space by an adapter layer and concatenated with text embeddings converted from text prompts to form inputs to the decoder. By providing keywords as prior information in the text prompts, we can contextualize our LLM-based ASR system without modifying the model architecture to transcribe ambiguous words in the input audio accurately. Experimental results demonstrate that providing keywords to the decoder can significantly improve the recognition performance of rare and ambiguous words.

### Judging the Judges: Evaluating Alignment and Vulnerabilities in   LLMs-as-Judges
**Authors**: Aman Singh Thakur, Kartik Choudhary, Venkat Srinik Ramayapally, Sankaran Vaidyanathan, Dieuwke Hupkes

**Updated**: 2024-10-11T05:29:18Z

**Summary**: Offering a promising solution to the scalability challenges associated with human evaluation, the LLM-as-a-judge paradigm is rapidly gaining traction as an approach to evaluating large language models (LLMs). However, there are still many open questions about the strengths and weaknesses of this paradigm, and what potential biases it may hold. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of the performance of various LLMs acting as judges, focusing on a clean scenario in which inter-human agreement is high. Investigating thirteen judge models of different model sizes and families, judging answers of nine different 'examtaker models' - both base and instruction-tuned - we find that only the best (and largest) models achieve reasonable alignment with humans. However, they are still quite far behind inter-human agreement and their assigned scores may still differ with up to 5 points from human-assigned scores. In terms of their ranking of the nine exam-taker models, instead, also smaller models and even the lexical metric contains may provide a reasonable signal. Through error analysis and other studies, we identify vulnerabilities in judge models, such as their sensitivity to prompt complexity and length, and a tendency toward leniency. The fact that even the best judges differ from humans in this comparatively simple setup suggest that caution may be wise when using judges in more complex setups. Lastly, our research rediscovers the importance of using alignment metrics beyond simple percent alignment, showing that judges with high percent agreement can still assign vastly different scores.

### Chip-Tuning: Classify Before Language Models Say
**Authors**: Fangwei Zhu, Dian Li, Jiajun Huang, Gang Liu, Hui Wang, Zhifang Sui

**Summary**: The rapid development in the performance of large language models (LLMs) is accompanied by the escalation of model size, leading to the increasing cost of model training and inference. Previous research has discovered that certain layers in LLMs exhibit redundancy, and removing these layers brings only marginal loss in model performance. In this paper, we adopt the probing technique to explain the layer redundancy in LLMs and demonstrate that language models can be effectively pruned with probing classifiers. We propose chip-tuning, a simple and effective structured pruning framework specialized for classification problems. Chip-tuning attaches tiny probing classifiers named chips to different layers of LLMs, and trains chips with the backbone model frozen. After selecting a chip for classification, all layers subsequent to the attached layer could be removed with marginal performance loss. Experimental results on various LLMs and datasets demonstrate that chip-tuning significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art baselines in both accuracy and pruning ratio, achieving a pruning ratio of up to 50%. We also find that chip-tuning could be applied on multimodal models, and could be combined with model finetuning, proving its excellent compatibility.
