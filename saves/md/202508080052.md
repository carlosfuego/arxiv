 ### p-MoD: Building Mixture-of-Depths MLLMs via Progressive Ratio Decay
**Authors**: Jun Zhang, Desen Meng, Zhengming Zhang, Zhenpeng Huang, Tao Wu, Limin Wang

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T16:57:39Z

**Summary**: Despite the remarkable performance of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) across diverse tasks, the substantial training and inference costs impede their advancement. In this paper, we propose p-MoD, an efficient MLLM architecture that significantly reduces training and inference costs while maintaining model performance. The majority of computation in MLLMs stems from the overwhelming volume of vision tokens processed by the transformer-based LLM. Accordingly, we leverage the Mixture-of-Depths (MoD) mechanism, where each LLM layer selects essential vision tokens to process while skipping redundant ones. However, integrating MoD into MLLMs is non-trivial. To address the challenges of training and inference stability as well as limited training data, we adapt the MoD module with two novel designs: tanh-gated weight normalization (TanhNorm) and symmetric token reweighting (STRing). Moreover, we observe that vision tokens exhibit higher redundancy in deeper layers and thus design a progressive ratio decay (PRD) strategy, which gradually reduces the token retention ratio layer by layer, employing a shifted cosine schedule. This crucial design fully unleashes the potential of MoD, significantly boosting the efficiency and performance of our models. Extensive experiments on two baseline models across 15 benchmarks show that our model matches or even surpasses the performance of corresponding baselines, while requiring only 55.6% TFLOPs and 53.7% KV cache storage during inference, and 77.7% GPU hours during training.

### Share Your Attention: Transformer Weight Sharing via Matrix-based   Dictionary Learning
**Authors**: Magauiya Zhussip, Dmitriy Shopkhoev, Ammar Ali, Stamatios Lefkimmiatis

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T16:06:43Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized AI applications, yet their high computational and memory demands hinder their widespread deployment. Existing compression techniques focus on intra-block optimizations (e.g. low-rank approximation, attention head pruning), while the repetitive layered structure of transformers implies significant inter-block redundancy - a dimension largely unexplored beyond key-value (KV) caching. Inspired by dictionary learning in CNNs, we propose a framework for structured weight sharing across transformer layers. Our approach decomposes attention projection matrices into shared dictionary atoms, reducing the attention module's parameters by 66.7% while achieving on-par performance. Unlike complex methods requiring distillation or architectural changes, MASA (Matrix Atom Sharing in Attention) operates as a drop-in replacement - trained with standard optimizers - and represents each layer's weights as linear combinations of shared matrix atoms. Experiments across scales (100M-700M parameters) show that MASA achieves better benchmark accuracy and perplexity than grouped-query attention (GQA), low-rank baselines and recently proposed Repeat-all-over/Sequential sharing at comparable parameter budgets. Ablation studies confirm robustness to the dictionary size and the efficacy of shared representations in capturing cross-layer statistical regularities. Extending to Vision Transformers (ViT), MASA matches performance metrics on image classification and detection tasks with 66.7% fewer attention parameters. By combining dictionary learning strategies with transformer efficiency, MASA offers a scalable blueprint for parameter-efficient models without sacrificing performance. Finally, we investigate the possibility of employing MASA on pretrained LLMs to reduce their number of parameters without experiencing any significant drop in their performance.

### From FASTER to F2: Evolving Concurrent Key-Value Store Designs for Large   Skewed Workloads
**Authors**: Konstantinos Kanellis, Badrish Chandramouli, Ted Hart, Shivaram Venkataraman

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T15:38:06Z

**Summary**: Modern large-scale services such as search engines, messaging platforms, and serverless functions, rely on key-value (KV) stores to maintain high performance at scale. When such services are deployed in constrained memory environments, they present challenging requirements: point operations requiring high throughput, working sets much larger than main memory, and natural skew in key access patterns. Traditional KV stores, based on LSM- and B-Trees, have been widely used to handle such use cases, but they often suffer from suboptimal use of modern hardware resources. The FASTER project, developed as a high-performance open-source KV storage library, has demonstrated remarkable success in both in-memory and hybrid storage environments. However, when tasked with serving large skewed workloads, it faced challenges, including high indexing and compactions overheads, and inefficient management of non-overlapping read-hot and write-hot working sets.   In this paper, we introduce F2 (for FASTER v2), an evolution of FASTER designed to meet the requirements of large skewed workloads common in industry applications. F2 adopts a two-tier record-oriented design to handle larger-than-memory skewed workloads, along with new concurrent latch-free mechanisms and components to maximize performance on modern hardware. To realize this design, F2 tackles key challenges and introduces several innovations, including new latch-free algorithms for multi-threaded log compaction, a two-level hash index to reduce indexing overhead for cold records, and a read-cache for serving read-hot records. Our evaluation shows that F2 achieves 2-11.9x better throughput compared to existing KV stores, effectively serving the target workload. F2 is open-source and available as part of the FASTER project.

### CARD: Cache-Assisted Parallel Speculative Decoding for Efficient Large   Language Model Inference
**Authors**: Enyu Zhou, Kai Sheng, Hao Chen, Xin He

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T14:02:10Z

**Summary**: Speculative decoding (SD), where an extra draft model first provides multiple draft tokens and the original target model then verifies these tokens in parallel, has shown great power for LLM inference acceleration. However, existing SD methods must adhere to the 'draft-then-verify' paradigm, which forces drafting and verification processes to execute sequentially during SD, resulting in inefficient inference performance and limiting the size of the draft model. Furthermore, once a single token in the candidate sequence is rejected during the drafting process, all subsequent candidate tokens must be discarded, leading to inefficient drafting. To address these challenges, we propose a cache-based parallel speculative decoding framework employing a 'query-and-correct' paradigm. Specifically, CARD decouples drafting and verification: the draft model generates candidate tokens to populate a shared cache, while the target model concurrently rectifies the draft model's generation direction. This effectively enables the target model to perform inference at speed approaching that of the draft model. Our approach achieves up to 4.83 speedup over vanilla decoding without requiring fine-tuning of either the draft or target models. Our code is available at https://github.com/hunzhizi/CARD.

### CITRAS: Covariate-Informed Transformer for Time Series Forecasting
**Authors**: Yosuke Yamaguchi, Issei Suemitsu, Wenpeng Wei

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T11:46:11Z

**Summary**: In practical time series forecasting, covariates provide rich contextual information that can potentially enhance the forecast of target variables. Although some covariates extend into the future forecasting horizon (e.g., calendar events, discount schedules), most multivariate models fail to leverage this pivotal insight due to the length discrepancy with target variables. Additionally, capturing the dependency between target variables and covariates is non-trivial, as models must precisely reflect the local impact of covariates while also capturing global cross-variate dependencies. To overcome these challenges, we propose CITRAS, a decoder-only Transformer that flexibly leverages multiple targets, past covariates, and future covariates. While preserving strong autoregressive capabilities, CITRAS introduces two novel mechanisms in patch-wise cross-variate attention: Key-Value (KV) Shift and Attention Score Smoothing. KV Shift seamlessly incorporates future covariates into the forecasting of target variables based on their concurrent dependencies. Additionally, Attention Score Smoothing refines locally accurate patch-wise cross-variate dependencies into global variate-level dependencies by smoothing the past series of attention scores. Experimentally, CITRAS outperforms state-of-the-art models on thirteen real-world benchmarks from both covariate-informed and multivariate settings, demonstrating its versatile ability to leverage cross-variate and cross-time dependencies for improved forecasting accuracy.

### KVSink: Understanding and Enhancing the Preservation of Attention Sinks   in KV Cache Quantization for LLMs
**Authors**: Zunhai Su, Kehong Yuan

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T09:40:09Z

**Summary**: Key-Value (KV) cache quantization has become a widely adopted optimization technique for efficient large language models (LLMs) inference by reducing KV cache memory usage and mitigating memory-bound constraints. Recent studies have emphasized the importance of preserving the original precision of KVs for the first few tokens to ensure the protection of attention sinks. While this approach has proven effective in mitigating performance degradation, its underlying principles remain insufficiently understood. Moreover, it fails to address the recent discovery that attention sinks can emerge beyond the initial token positions. In this work, we elucidate the underlying mechanisms of attention sinks during inference by examining their role in the cross-layer evolution of extreme activation outliers. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the interplay between attention sinks and KV cache quantization. Based on our enhanced understanding, we introduce \textit{\textbf{KVSink}}, a plug-and-play method that effectively predicts sink tokens with negligible overhead, enabling more thorough preservation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KVSink outperforms the existing Preserve-First-N (PFN) strategy, offering more effective preservation of attention sinks during KV cache quantization. Moreover, when applied to the well-established KVQuant method, KVSink further improves perplexity (PPL) and reduces reliance on 16-bit numerical outliers.

### EdgeInfinite-Instruct: Bridging SFT-Based Optimization and NPU-Level   Efficiency for Edge Devices
**Authors**: Jiyu Chen, Poh Seng Lim, Shuang Peng, Daxiong Luo, JungHau Foo, Yap Deep, Timothy Lee Jun Jie, Kelvin Teh Kae Wen, Fan Yang, Danyu Feng, Hao-Yun Chen, Peng-Wen Chen, Fangyuan Li, Xiaoxin Chen, Wong Wai Mun

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T08:32:53Z

**Summary**: Deploying Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) on resource-constrained edge devices for long-sequence tasks remains challenging due to the quadratic time complexity of self-attention and growing Key-Value (KV) cache demands. While existing KV cache optimizations improve memory efficiency, they often fail to reduce time to first token (TTFT) and may degrade performance through token pruning. Alternative sequence modeling architectures address some of these limitations, but typically require full retraining and lack infrastructure support. EdgeInfinite offers an efficient solution by fine-tuning only a small subset of parameters, maintaining quality while reducing both computational and memory costs, including improved TTFT. However, its instruction-following ability is limited, and it lacks mobile-specific optimizations. To address these issues, we propose EdgeInfinite-Instruct, which introduces a Segmented Supervised Fine-Tuning (S-SFT) strategy tailored to long-sequence tasks such as summarization and question answering. We further optimized EdgeInfinite-Instruct for efficient deployment on edge NPUs by employing fine-grained post-training quantization (PTQ) to reduce computational demands while maintaining accuracy, and by implementing a fixed-shape computation graph that balances memory usage and on-device efficiency through scenario-specific customization of input token and cache sizes. Experiments on long-context benchmarks and real-world mobile tasks show that our approach improves domain-specific performance while maintaining efficiency on NPU-accelerated edge devices.

### Managing Data for Scalable and Interactive Event Sequence Visualization
**Authors**: Sayef Azad Sakin, Katherine E. Isaacs

**Updated**: 2025-08-05T23:47:34Z

**Summary**: Parallel event sequences, such as those collected in program execution traces and automated manufacturing pipelines, are typically visualized as interactive parallel timelines. As the dataset size grows, these charts frequently experience lag during common interactions such as zooming, panning, and filtering. Summarization approaches can improve interaction performance, but at the cost of accuracy in representation. To address this challenge, we introduce ESeMan (Event Sequence Manager), an event sequence management system designed to support interactive rendering of timeline visualizations with tunable accuracy. ESeMan employs hierarchical data structures and intelligent caching to provide visualizations with only the data necessary to generate accurate summarizations with significantly reduced data fetch time. We evaluate ESeMan's query times against summed area tables, M4 aggregation, and statistical sub-sampling on a variety of program execution traces. Our results demonstrate ESeMan provides better performance, achieving sub-100ms fetch times while maintaining visualization accuracy at the pixel level. We further present our benchmarking harness, enabling future performance evaluations for event sequence visualization.

### Rhea: a Framework for Fast Design and Validation of RTL Cache-Coherent   Memory Subsystems
**Authors**: Davide Zoni, Andrea Galimberti, Adriano Guarisco

**Updated**: 2025-08-05T18:34:48Z

**Summary**: Designing and validating efficient cache-coherent memory subsystems is a critical yet complex task in the development of modern multi-core system-on-chip architectures. Rhea is a unified framework that streamlines the design and system-level validation of RTL cache-coherent memory subsystems. On the design side, Rhea generates synthesizable, highly configurable RTL supporting various architectural parameters. On the validation side, Rhea integrates Verilator's cycle-accurate RTL simulation with gem5's full-system simulation, allowing realistic workloads and operating systems to run alongside the actual RTL under test. We apply Rhea to design MSI-based RTL memory subsystems with one and two levels of private caches and scaling up to sixteen cores. Their evaluation with 22 applications from state-of-the-art benchmark suites shows intermediate performance relative to gem5 Ruby's MI and MOESI models. The hybrid gem5-Verilator co-simulation flow incurs a moderate simulation overhead, up to 2.7 times compared to gem5 MI, but achieves higher fidelity by simulating real RTL hardware. This overhead decreases with scale, down to 1.6 times in sixteen-core scenarios. These results demonstrate Rhea's effectiveness and scalability in enabling fast development of RTL cache-coherent memory subsystem designs.

### FEB-Cache: Frequency-Guided Exposure Bias Reduction for Enhancing   Diffusion Transformer Caching
**Authors**: Zhen Zou, Feng Zhao

**Updated**: 2025-08-05T16:17:01Z

**Summary**: Diffusion Transformer (DiT) has exhibited impressive generation capabilities but faces great challenges due to its high computational complexity. To address this issue, various methods, notably feature caching, have been introduced. However, these approaches focus on aligning non-cache diffusion without analyzing why caching damage the generation processes. In this paper, we first confirm that the cache greatly amplifies the exposure bias, resulting in a decline in the generation quality. However, directly applying noise scaling is challenging for this issue due to the non-smoothness of exposure bias. We found that this phenomenon stems from the mismatch between its frequency response characteristics and the simple cache of Attention and MLP. Since these two components exhibit unique preferences for frequency signals, which provides us with a caching strategy to separate Attention and MLP to achieve an enhanced fit of exposure bias and reduce it. Based on this, we introduced FEB-Cache, a joint caching strategy that aligns with the non-exposed bias diffusion process (which gives us a higher performance cap) of caching Attention and MLP based on the frequency-guided cache table. Our approach combines a comprehensive understanding of the caching mechanism and offers a new perspective on leveraging caching to accelerate the diffusion process. Empirical results indicate that FEB-Cache optimizes model performance while concurrently facilitating acceleration.

### Bidirectional TLS Handshake Caching for Constrained Industrial IoT   Scenarios
**Authors**: Jörn Bodenhausen, Simon Mangel, Thomas Vogt, Martin Henze

**Updated**: 2025-08-05T11:00:41Z

**Summary**: While TLS has become the de-facto standard for end-to-end security, its use to secure critical communication in evolving industrial IoT scenarios is severely limited by prevalent resource constraints of devices and networks. Most notably, the TLS handshake to establish secure connections incurs significant bandwidth and processing overhead that often cannot be handled in constrained environments. To alleviate this situation, we present BiTHaC which realizes bidirectional TLS handshake caching by exploiting that significant parts of repeated TLS handshakes, especially certificates, are static. Thus, redundant information neither needs to be transmitted nor corresponding computations performed, saving valuable bandwidth and processing resources. By implementing BiTHaC for wolfSSL, we show that we can reduce the bandwidth consumption of TLS handshakes by up to 61.1% and the computational overhead by up to 8.5%, while incurring only well-manageable memory overhead and preserving the strict security guarantees of TLS.

### SmartLLMs Scheduler: A Framework for Cost-Effective LLMs Utilization
**Authors**: Yueyue Liu, Hongyu Zhang, Yuantian Miao

**Updated**: 2025-08-05T09:35:52Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 and Llama have shown remarkable capabilities in a variety of software engineering tasks. Despite the advancements, their practical deployment faces challenges, including high financial costs, long response time, and varying performance, especially when handling a large number of queries (jobs). Existing optimization strategies for deploying LLMs for diverse tasks focus on static scheduling, which requires extensive training data for performance prediction, increasing the computational costs and limiting the applicability and flexibility. In this paper, we propose the SmartLLMs Scheduler (SLS), a dynamic and cost-effective scheduling solution. The key idea is to learn LLMs' performance on diverse tasks and incorporate their real-time feedback to update strategies periodically. Specifically, SLS incorporates three key components, including an Adaptive Cache Manager, a Performance-Cost Optimized Scheduler, and a Dynamic Update Manager. The Cache Manager stores the outputs of previously processed queries and employs an adaptive strategy to reduce redundant computations and minimize response times. For queries not found in the cache, the Scheduler dynamically allocates them to the most suitable LLM based on the predicted performance and cost from models that take both query-specific and LLM-specific features as input. The Update Manager continuously refines the cache and scheduling strategies based on real-time feedback from the assigned queries to enhance decision-making and adapt to evolving task characteristics. To evaluate the effectiveness of SLS, we conduct extensive experiments on two LLM-based software engineering tasks, including log parsing and code generation. The results show that SLS significantly outperforms the baseline methods, achieving an average performance improvement of 198.82% and an average processing time reduction of 63.28%.

### Forecasting When to Forecast: Accelerating Diffusion Models with   Confidence-Gated Taylor
**Authors**: Xiaoliu Guan, Lielin Jiang, Hanqi Chen, Xu Zhang, Jiaxing Yan, Guanzhong Wang, Yi Liu, Zetao Zhang, Yu Wu

**Updated**: 2025-08-05T02:13:39Z

**Summary**: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in visual generation tasks. However, their low inference speed limits their deployment in low-resource applications. Recent training-free approaches exploit the redundancy of features across timesteps by caching and reusing past representations to accelerate inference. Building on this idea, TaylorSeer instead uses cached features to predict future ones via Taylor expansion. However, its module-level prediction across all transformer blocks (e.g., attention or feedforward modules) requires storing fine-grained intermediate features, leading to notable memory and computation overhead. Moreover, it adopts a fixed caching schedule without considering the varying accuracy of predictions across timesteps, which can lead to degraded outputs when prediction fails. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach to better leverage Taylor-based acceleration. First, we shift the Taylor prediction target from the module level to the last block level, significantly reducing the number of cached features. Furthermore, observing strong sequential dependencies among Transformer blocks, we propose to use the error between the Taylor-estimated and actual outputs of the first block as an indicator of prediction reliability. If the error is small, we trust the Taylor prediction for the last block; otherwise, we fall back to full computation, thereby enabling a dynamic caching mechanism. Empirical results show that our method achieves a better balance between speed and quality, achieving a 3.17x acceleration on FLUX, 2.36x on DiT, and 4.14x on Wan Video with negligible quality drop.

### GainSight: A Unified Framework for Data Lifetime Profiling and   Heterogeneous Memory Composition
**Authors**: Peijing Li, Matthew Hung, Yiming Tan, Konstantin Hoßfeld, Jake Cheng Jiajun, Shuhan Liu, Lixian Yan, Xinxin Wang, Philip Levis, H. -S. Philip Wong, Thierry Tambe

**Updated**: 2025-08-05T00:25:53Z

**Summary**: As AI workloads drive increasing memory requirements, domain-specific accelerators need higher-density on-chip memory beyond what current SRAM scaling trends can provide. Simultaneously, the vast amounts of short-lived data in these workloads make SRAM overprovisioned in retention capability. To address this mismatch, we propose a wholesale shift from uniform SRAM arrays to heterogeneous on-chip memory, incorporating denser short-term RAM (StRAM) devices whose limited retention times align with transient data lifetimes. To facilitate this shift, we introduce GainSight, the first comprehensive, open-source framework that aligns dynamic, fine-grained workload lifetime profiles with memory device characteristics to enable generation of optimal StRAM memory compositions. GainSight combines retargetable profiling backends with an architecture-agnostic analytical frontend. The various backends capture cycle-accurate data lifetimes, while the frontend correlates workload patterns with StRAM retention properties to generate optimal memory compositions and project performance. GainSight elevates data lifetime to a first-class design consideration for next-generation AI accelerators, enabling systematic exploitation of data transience for improved on-chip memory density and efficiency. Applying GainSight to MLPerf Inference and PolyBench workloads reveals that 64.3% of first-level GPU cache accesses and 79.01% of systolic array scratchpad accesses exhibit sub-microsecond lifetimes suitable for high-density StRAM, with optimal heterogeneous on-chip memory compositions achieving up to 3x active energy and 4x area reductions compared to uniform SRAM hierarchies. To facilitate adoption and further research, GainSight is open-sourced at https://gainsight.stanford.edu/.

### Sparse-dLLM: Accelerating Diffusion LLMs with Dynamic Cache Eviction
**Authors**: Yuerong Song, Xiaoran Liu, Ruixiao Li, Zhigeng Liu, Zengfeng Huang, Qipeng Guo, Ziwei He, Xipeng Qiu

**Updated**: 2025-08-04T16:14:03Z

**Summary**: Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) enable breakthroughs in reasoning and parallel decoding but suffer from prohibitive quadratic computational complexity and memory overhead during inference. Current caching techniques accelerate decoding by storing full-layer states, yet impose substantial memory usage that limit long-context applications. Our analysis of attention patterns in dLLMs reveals persistent cross-layer sparsity, with pivotal tokens remaining salient across decoding steps and low-relevance tokens staying unimportant, motivating selective cache eviction. We propose Sparse-dLLM, the first training-free framework integrating dynamic cache eviction with sparse attention via delayed bidirectional sparse caching. By leveraging the stability of token saliency over steps, it retains critical tokens and dynamically evicts unimportant prefix/suffix entries using an attention-guided strategy. Extensive experiments on LLaDA and Dream series demonstrate Sparse-dLLM achieves up to 10$\times$ higher throughput than vanilla dLLMs, with comparable performance and similar peak memory costs, outperforming previous methods in efficiency and effectiveness.

### CompressKV: Semantic Retrieval Heads Know What Tokens are Not Important   Before Generation
**Authors**: Xiaolin Lin, Jingcun Wang, Olga Kondrateva, Yiyu Shi, Bing Li, Grace Li Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-08-04T13:26:16Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly boosted long-context processing. However, the increasing key-value (KV) cache size poses critical challenges to memory and execution efficiency. Most KV cache compression methods rely on heuristic token eviction using all attention heads in Grouped Query Attention (GQA)-based LLMs. This method ignores the different functionalities of attention heads, leading to the eviction of critical tokens and thus degrades the performance of LLMs.   To address the issue above, instead of using all the attention heads in GQA-based LLMs to determine important tokens as in the previous work, we first identify the attention heads in each layer that are not only capable of retrieving the initial and final tokens of a prompt, but also capable of retrieving important tokens within the text and attending to their surrounding semantic context. Afterwards, we exploit such heads to determine the important tokens and retain their corresponding KV cache pairs. Furthermore, we analyze the cache eviction error of each layer individually and introduce a layer-adaptive KV cache allocation strategy. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed CompressKV consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches under various memory budgets on LongBench and Needle-in-a-Haystack benchmarks. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/TUDa-HWAI/CompressKV.git.

### OnPair: Short Strings Compression for Fast Random Access
**Authors**: Francesco Gargiulo, Rossano Venturini

**Updated**: 2025-08-04T10:51:20Z

**Summary**: We present OnPair, a dictionary-based compression algorithm designed to meet the needs of in-memory database systems that require both high compression and fast random access. Existing methods either achieve strong compression ratios at significant computational and memory cost (e.g., BPE) or prioritize speed at the expense of compression quality (e.g., FSST). OnPair bridges this gap by employing a cache-friendly dictionary construction technique that incrementally merges frequent adjacent substrings in a single sequential pass over a data sample. This enables fast, memory-efficient training without tracking global pair positions, as required by traditional BPE. We also introduce OnPair16, a variant that limits dictionary entries to 16 bytes, enabling faster parsing via optimized longest prefix matching. Both variants compress strings independently, supporting fine-grained random access without block-level overhead. Experiments on real-world datasets show that OnPair and OnPair16 achieve compression ratios comparable to BPE while significantly improving compression speed and memory usage.

### LeanK: Learnable K Cache Channel Pruning for Efficient Decoding
**Authors**: Yike Zhang, Zhiyuan He, Huiqiang Jiang, Chengruidong Zhang, Yuqing Yang, Jianyong Wang, Lili Qiu

**Updated**: 2025-08-04T09:08:43Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) enable long-context tasks but face efficiency challenges due to the growing key-value (KV) cache. We propose LeanK, a learning-based method that prunes unimportant key (K) cache channels by leveraging static channel sparsity. With a novel two-stage training process, LeanK learns channel-wise static mask that could satisfy specific sparsity ratio and hardware alignment requirement. LeanK reduces GPU memory and accelerates decoding without sacrificing accuracy. Experiments demonstrate up to 70% K cache and 16%-18% V cache memory reduction. Custom decoding kernel enables 1.3x speedup for attention computation. We also provide insights into model channels and attention heads during long-context inference by analyzing the learned importance distribution. Our code is available at https://aka.ms/LeanK.

### CaliDrop: KV Cache Compression with Calibration
**Authors**: Yi Su, Quantong Qiu, Yuechi Zhou, Juntao Li, Qingrong Xia, Ping Li, Xinyu Duan, Zhefeng Wang, Min Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-08-04T08:19:26Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) require substantial computational resources during generation. While the Key-Value (KV) cache significantly accelerates this process by storing attention intermediates, its memory footprint grows linearly with sequence length, batch size, and model size, creating a bottleneck in long-context scenarios. Various KV cache compression techniques, including token eviction, quantization, and low-rank projection, have been proposed to mitigate this bottleneck, often complementing each other. This paper focuses on enhancing token eviction strategies. Token eviction leverages the observation that the attention patterns are often sparse, allowing for the removal of less critical KV entries to save memory. However, this reduction usually comes at the cost of notable accuracy degradation, particularly under high compression ratios. To address this issue, we propose \textbf{CaliDrop}, a novel strategy that enhances token eviction through calibration. Our preliminary experiments show that queries at nearby positions exhibit high similarity. Building on this observation, CaliDrop performs speculative calibration on the discarded tokens to mitigate the accuracy loss caused by token eviction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CaliDrop significantly improves the accuracy of existing token eviction methods.

### Bridging Cache-Friendliness and Concurrency: A Locality-Optimized   In-Memory B-Skiplist
**Authors**: Yicong Luo, Senhe Hao, Brian Wheatman, Prashant Pandey, Helen Xu

**Updated**: 2025-08-04T04:48:41Z

**Summary**: Skiplists are widely used for in-memory indexing in many key-value stores, such as RocksDB and LevelDB, due to their ease of implementation and simple concurrency control mechanisms. However, traditional skiplists suffer from poor cache locality, as they store only a single element per node, leaving performance on the table. Minimizing last-level cache misses is key to maximizing in-memory index performance, making high cache locality essential. In this paper, we present a practical concurrent B-skiplist that enhances cache locality and performance while preserving the simplicity of traditional skiplist structures and concurrency control schemes. Our key contributions include a top-down, single-pass insertion algorithm for B-skiplists and a corresponding simple and efficient top-down concurrency control scheme. On 128 threads, the proposed concurrent B-skiplist achieves between 2x-9x higher throughput compared to state-of-the-art concurrent skiplist implementations, including Facebook's concurrent skiplist from Folly and the Java ConcurrentSkipListMap. Furthermore, we find that the B-skiplist achieves competitive (0.9x-1.7x) throughput on point workloads compared to state-of-the-art cache-optimized tree-based indices (e.g., Masstree). For a more complete picture of the performance, we also measure the latency of skiplist and tree-based indices and find that the B-skiplist achieves between 3.5x-103x lower 99% latency compared to other concurrent skiplists and between 0.85x-64x lower 99% latency compared to tree-based indices on point workloads with inserts.

### Timely Requesting for Time-Critical Content Users in Decentralized   F-RANs
**Authors**: Xingran Chen, Kai Li, Kun Yang

**Updated**: 2025-08-04T02:47:35Z

**Summary**: With the rising demand for high-rate and timely communications, fog radio access networks (F-RANs) offer a promising solution. This work investigates age of information (AoI) performance in F-RANs, consisting of multiple content users (CUs), enhanced remote radio heads (eRRHs), and content providers (CPs). Time-critical CUs need rapid content updates from CPs but cannot communicate directly with them; instead, eRRHs act as intermediaries. CUs decide whether to request content from a CP and which eRRH to send the request to, while eRRHs decide whether to command CPs to update content or use cached content. We study two general classes of policies: (i) oblivious policies, where decision-making is independent of historical information, and (ii) non-oblivious policies, where decisions are influenced by historical information. First, we obtain closed-form expressions for the average AoI of eRRHs under both policy types. Due to the complexity of calculating closed-form expressions for CUs, we then derive general upper bounds for their average AoI. Next, we identify optimal policies for both types. Under both optimal policies, each CU requests content from each CP at an equal rate, consolidating all requests to a single eRRH when demand is low or resources are limited, and distributing requests evenly among eRRHs when demand is high and resources are ample. eRRHs command content from each CP at an equal rate under an optimal oblivious policy, while prioritize the CP with the highest age under an optimal non-oblivious policy. Our numerical results validate these theoretical findings.

### Compressing KV Cache for Long-Context LLM Inference with Inter-Layer   Attention Similarity
**Authors**: Da Ma, Lu Chen, Situo Zhang, Yuxun Miao, Su Zhu, Zhi Chen, Hongshen Xu, Hanqi Li, Shuai Fan, Lei Pan, Kai Yu

**Updated**: 2025-08-04T02:17:56Z

**Summary**: The rapid expansion of context window sizes in Large Language Models~(LLMs) has enabled them to tackle increasingly complex tasks involving lengthy documents. However, this progress comes at the cost of a substantial increase in memory usage during inference, primarily due to the linear growth of the key-value~(KV) cache. Existing KV cache compression methods often discard less relevant tokens, which can lead to significant performance degradation when critical information is lost. In this paper, we propose \textsc{PoD}~(Proximal tokens over Distant tokens), a novel KV cache compression framework that allocates memory according to token importance, retaining less important tokens in a more compact, shared form rather than discarding them entirely. Our approach is motivated by two key observations: (1) proximal tokens -- those at the beginning and end of the context -- are significantly more important for next-token prediction, and (2) attention scores for distant tokens are highly redundant across consecutive layers. Leveraging these insights, \textsc{PoD} preserves the full KV cache for proximal tokens, while for distant tokens, it shares key states across layers. Since attention scores are determined by both queries and keys, sharing key states enables multiple layers to reuse a single set of keys for distant tokens, substantially reducing KV cache memory without discarding essential context. We further introduce a lightweight post-training adaptation to enable the model to adjust to this new attention-sharing structure. Extensive experiments on both synthetic~(Needle in a Haystack) and real-world long-context benchmarks demonstrate that \textsc{PoD} reduces KV cache memory usage by up to 35\% without compromising performance. Our method is orthogonal to existing token-selection-based techniques and can be combined with them for further KV cache compression.

### Revenue Optimization in Wireless Video Caching Networks: A   Privacy-Preserving Two-Stage Solution
**Authors**: Yijing Zhang, Md-Ferdous Pervej, Andreas F. Molisch

**Updated**: 2025-08-03T19:16:40Z

**Summary**: Video caching can significantly improve delivery efficiency and enhance quality of video streaming, which constitutes the majority of wireless communication traffic. Due to limited cache size, caching strategies must be designed to adapt to and dynamic user demand in order to maximize system revenue. The system revenue depends on the benefits of delivering the requested videos and costs for (a) transporting the files to the users and (b) cache replacement. Since the cache content at any point in time impacts the replacement costs in the future, demand predictions over multiple cache placement slots become an important prerequisite for efficient cache planning. Motivated by this, we introduce a novel two-stage privacy-preserving solution for revenue optimization in wireless video caching networks. First, we train a Transformer using privacy-preserving federated learning (FL) to predict multi-slot future demands. Given that prediction results are never entirely accurate, especially for longer horizons, we further combine global content popularity with per-user prediction results to estimate the content demand distribution. Then, in the second stage, we leverage these estimation results to find caching strategies that maximize the long-term system revenue. This latter problem takes on the form of a multi-stage knapsack problem, which we then transform to a integer linear program. Our extensive simulation results demonstrate that (i) our FL solution delivers nearly identical performance to that of the ideal centralized solution and outperforms other existing caching methods, and (ii) our novel revenue optimization approach provides deeper system performance insights than traditional cache hit ratio (CHR)-based optimization approaches.

### StreamAgent: Towards Anticipatory Agents for Streaming Video   Understanding
**Authors**: Haolin Yang, Feilong Tang, Linxiao Zhao, Xiang An, Ming Hu, Huifa Li, Xinlin Zhuang, Boqian Wang, Yifan Lu, Xiaofeng Zhang, Abdalla Swikir, Junjun He, Zongyuan Ge, Imran Razzak

**Updated**: 2025-08-03T18:15:42Z

**Summary**: Real-time streaming video understanding in domains such as autonomous driving and intelligent surveillance poses challenges beyond conventional offline video processing, requiring continuous perception, proactive decision making, and responsive interaction based on dynamically evolving visual content. However, existing methods rely on alternating perception-reaction or asynchronous triggers, lacking task-driven planning and future anticipation, which limits their real-time responsiveness and proactive decision making in evolving video streams. To this end, we propose a StreamAgent that anticipates the temporal intervals and spatial regions expected to contain future task-relevant information to enable proactive and goal-driven responses. Specifically, we integrate question semantics and historical observations through prompting the anticipatory agent to anticipate the temporal progression of key events, align current observations with the expected future evidence, and subsequently adjust the perception action (e.g., attending to task-relevant regions or continuously tracking in subsequent frames). To enable efficient inference, we design a streaming KV-cache memory mechanism that constructs a hierarchical memory structure for selective recall of relevant tokens, enabling efficient semantic retrieval while reducing the overhead of storing all tokens in the traditional KV-cache. Extensive experiments on streaming and long video understanding tasks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in response accuracy and real-time efficiency, highlighting its practical value for real-world streaming scenarios.

### MCTS-SQL: Light-Weight LLMs can Master the Text-to-SQL through Monte   Carlo Tree Search
**Authors**: Shuozhi Yuan, Limin Chen, Miaomiao Yuan, Jin Zhao

**Updated**: 2025-08-03T10:27:19Z

**Summary**: Text-to-SQL is a fundamental yet challenging task in the NLP area, aiming at translating natural language questions into SQL queries. While recent advances in large language models have greatly improved performance, most existing approaches depend on models with tens of billions of parameters or costly APIs, limiting their applicability in resource-constrained environments. For real world, especially on edge devices, it is crucial for Text-to-SQL to ensure cost-effectiveness. Therefore, enabling the light-weight models for Text-to-SQL is of great practical significance. However, smaller LLMs often struggle with complicated user instruction, redundant schema linking or syntax correctness. To address these challenges, we propose MCTS-SQL, a novel framework that uses Monte Carlo Tree Search to guide SQL generation through multi-step refinement. Since the light-weight models' weak performance of single-shot prediction, we generate better results through several trials with feedback. However, directly applying MCTS-based methods inevitably leads to significant time and computational overhead. Driven by this issue, we propose a token-level prefix-cache mechanism that stores prior information during iterations, effectively improved the execution speed. Experiments results on the SPIDER and BIRD benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Using a small open-source Qwen2.5-Coder-1.5B, our method outperforms ChatGPT-3.5. When leveraging a more powerful model Gemini 2.5 to explore the performance upper bound, we achieved results competitive with the SOTA. Our findings demonstrate that even small models can be effectively deployed in practical Text-to-SQL systems with the right strategy.

### SmallKV: Small Model Assisted Compensation of KV Cache Compression for   Efficient LLM Inference
**Authors**: Yi Zhao, Yajuan Peng, Cam-Tu Nguyen, Zuchao Li, Xiaoliang Wang, Hai Zhao, Xiaoming Fu

**Updated**: 2025-08-03T09:15:36Z

**Summary**: KV cache eviction has emerged as an effective solution to alleviate resource constraints faced by LLMs in long-context scenarios. However, existing token-level eviction methods often overlook two critical aspects: (1) their irreversible eviction strategy fails to adapt to dynamic attention patterns during decoding (the saliency shift problem), and (2) they treat both marginally important tokens and truly unimportant tokens equally, despite the collective significance of marginal tokens to model performance (the marginal information over-compression problem). To address these issues, we design two compensation mechanisms based on the high similarity of attention matrices between LLMs of different scales. We propose SmallKV, a small model assisted compensation method for KV cache compression. SmallKV can maintain attention matching between different-scale LLMs to: 1) assist the larger model in perceiving globally important information of attention; and 2) use the smaller model's attention scores to approximate those of marginal tokens in the larger model. Extensive experiments on benchmarks including GSM8K, BBH, MT-Bench, and LongBench demonstrate the effectiveness of SmallKV. Moreover, efficiency evaluations show that SmallKV achieves 1.75 - 2.56 times higher throughput than baseline methods, highlighting its potential for efficient and performant LLM inference in resource constrained environments.

### GSCache: Real-Time Radiance Caching for Volume Path Tracing using 3D   Gaussian Splatting
**Authors**: David Bauer, Qi Wu, Hamid Gadirov, Kwan-Liu Ma

**Updated**: 2025-08-02T23:59:11Z

**Summary**: Real-time path tracing is rapidly becoming the standard for rendering in entertainment and professional applications. In scientific visualization, volume rendering plays a crucial role in helping researchers analyze and interpret complex 3D data. Recently, photorealistic rendering techniques have gained popularity in scientific visualization, yet they face significant challenges. One of the most prominent issues is slow rendering performance and high pixel variance caused by Monte Carlo integration. In this work, we introduce a novel radiance caching approach for path-traced volume rendering. Our method leverages advances in volumetric scene representation and adapts 3D Gaussian splatting to function as a multi-level, path-space radiance cache. This cache is designed to be trainable on the fly, dynamically adapting to changes in scene parameters such as lighting configurations and transfer functions. By incorporating our cache, we achieve less noisy, higher-quality images without increasing rendering costs. To evaluate our approach, we compare it against a baseline path tracer that supports uniform sampling and next-event estimation and the state-of-the-art for neural radiance caching. Through both quantitative and qualitative analyses, we demonstrate that our path-space radiance cache is a robust solution that is easy to integrate and significantly enhances the rendering quality of volumetric visualization applications while maintaining comparable computational efficiency.

### PESTO: Real-Time Pitch Estimation with Self-supervised   Transposition-equivariant Objective
**Authors**: Alain Riou, Bernardo Torres, Ben Hayes, Stefan Lattner, Gaëtan Hadjeres, Gaël Richard, Geoffroy Peeters

**Updated**: 2025-08-02T21:00:55Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we introduce PESTO, a self-supervised learning approach for single-pitch estimation using a Siamese architecture. Our model processes individual frames of a Variable-$Q$ Transform (VQT) and predicts pitch distributions. The neural network is designed to be equivariant to translations, notably thanks to a Toeplitz fully-connected layer. In addition, we construct pitch-shifted pairs by translating and cropping the VQT frames and train our model with a novel class-based transposition-equivariant objective, eliminating the need for annotated data. Thanks to this architecture and training objective, our model achieves remarkable performances while being very lightweight ($130$k parameters). Evaluations on music and speech datasets (MIR-1K, MDB-stem-synth, and PTDB) demonstrate that PESTO not only outperforms self-supervised baselines but also competes with supervised methods, exhibiting superior cross-dataset generalization. Finally, we enhance PESTO's practical utility by developing a streamable VQT implementation using cached convolutions. Combined with our model's low latency (less than 10 ms) and minimal parameter count, this makes PESTO particularly suitable for real-time applications.

### Improving performance of content-centric networks via decentralized   coded caching for multi-level popularity and access
**Authors**: Azadeh Sadat Miraftab, Ahmadreza Montazerolghaem, Behrad Mahboobi

**Updated**: 2025-08-02T10:12:45Z

**Summary**: Content-Centric Networking (CCN) offers a novel architectural paradigm that seeks to address the inherent limitations of the prevailing Internet Protocol (IP)-based networking model. In contrast to the host-centric communication approach of IP networks, CCN prioritizes content by enabling direct addressing and routing based on content identifiers. The potential performance improvements of CCN can be further amplified through optimized management of coded data storage and transmission strategies. Decentralized Coded Caching (DCC) emerges as a promising technique that harnesses the collective caching power of distributed network elements. By strategically pre-positioning frequently accessed content closer to potential consumers during periods of low network utilization, DCC has the potential to mitigate content transfer rates during peak traffic periods. This paper proposes a series of fundamental modifications to the CCN architecture by integrating DCC. The proposed framework incorporates differentiated coding strategies tailored to user access privileges, thereby eliminating the overhead associated with queue-based searching. Additionally, the framework facilitates recoding of uncoded data encountered along the content delivery path. These combined methodologies demonstrably enhance network throughput, elevate cache hit ratios, and consequently, reduce content delivery latency compared to conventional CCN implementations.

### Unifying Mixture of Experts and Multi-Head Latent Attention for   Efficient Language Models
**Authors**: Sushant Mehta, Raj Dandekar, Rajat Dandekar, Sreedath Panat

**Updated**: 2025-08-02T08:33:30Z

**Summary**: We present MoE-MLA-RoPE, a novel architecture combination that combines Mixture of Experts (MoE) with Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) and Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) for efficient language modeling. Our approach addresses the fundamental trade-off between model capacity and computational efficiency through three key innovations: (1) fine-grained expert routing with 64 micro-experts and top-$k$ selection, enabling flexible specialization through 3.6 * 10^7 possible expert combinations; (2) shared expert isolation that dedicates 2 always active experts for common patterns while routing to 6 of 62 specialized experts; and (3) gradient-conflict-free load balancing that maintains expert utilization without interfering with primary loss optimization.   Extensive experiments on models ranging from 17M to 202M parameters demonstrate that MoE-MLA-RoPE with compression ratio r=d/2 achieves 68% KV cache memory reduction and 3.2x inference speedup while maintaining competitive perplexity (0.8% degradation). Compared to the parameters with 53.9M parameters, MoE-MLA-RoPE improves the validation loss by 6.9% over the vanilla transformers while using 42% fewer active parameters per forward pass. FLOP-matched experiments reveal even larger gains: 11.1% improvement with 3.2x inference acceleration. Automated evaluation using GPT-4 as a judge confirms quality improvements in generation, with higher scores on coherence (8.1/10), creativity (7.9/10) and grammatical correctness (8.2/10). Our results establish that architectural novelty, not parameter scaling, defines the efficiency frontier for resource-constrained language model deployment.

### MoDM: Efficient Serving for Image Generation via Mixture-of-Diffusion   Models
**Authors**: Yuchen Xia, Divyam Sharma, Yichao Yuan, Souvik Kundu, Nishil Talati

**Updated**: 2025-08-02T06:50:59Z

**Summary**: Diffusion-based text-to-image generation models trade latency for quality: small models are fast but generate lower-quality images, while large models produce better images but are slow.   We present MoDM, a novel caching-based serving system for diffusion models that dynamically balances latency and quality through a mixture of diffusion models. Unlike prior approaches that rely on model-specific internal features, MoDM caches final images, allowing seamless retrieval and reuse across multiple diffusion model families.   This design enables adaptive serving by dynamically balancing latency and image quality: using smaller models for cache-hit requests to reduce latency while reserving larger models for cache-miss requests to maintain quality. Small model image quality is preserved using retrieved cached images.   We design a global monitor that optimally allocates GPU resources and balances inference workload, ensuring high throughput while meeting service-level objectives under varying request rates. Our evaluations show that MoDM significantly reduces average serving time by 2.5x while retaining image quality, making it a practical solution for scalable and resource-efficient model deployment.

### Multi-Cache Enhanced Prototype Learning for Test-Time Generalization of   Vision-Language Models
**Authors**: Xinyu Chen, Haotian Zhai, Can Zhang, Xiupeng Shi, Ruirui Li

**Updated**: 2025-08-02T06:43:43Z

**Summary**: In zero-shot setting, test-time adaptation adjusts pre-trained models using unlabeled data from the test phase to enhance performance on unknown test distributions. Existing cache-enhanced TTA methods rely on a low-entropy criterion to select samples for prototype construction, assuming intra-class compactness. However, low-entropy samples may be unreliable under distribution shifts, and the resulting prototypes may not ensure compact intra-class distributions. This study identifies a positive correlation between cache-enhanced performance and intra-class compactness. Based on this observation, we propose a Multi-Cache enhanced Prototype-based Test-Time Adaptation (MCP) featuring three caches: an entropy cache for initializing prototype representations with low-entropy samples, an align cache for integrating visual and textual information to achieve compact intra-class distributions, and a negative cache for prediction calibration using high-entropy samples. We further developed MCP++, a framework incorporating cross-modal prototype alignment and residual learning, introducing prototype residual fine-tuning. Comparative and ablation experiments across 15 downstream tasks demonstrate that the proposed method and framework achieve state-of-the-art generalization performance.

### HIT Model: A Hierarchical Interaction-Enhanced Two-Tower Model for   Pre-Ranking Systems
**Authors**: Haoqiang Yang, Congde Yuan, Kun Bai, Mengzhuo Guo, Wei Yang, Chao Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-08-02T00:31:18Z

**Summary**: Online display advertising platforms rely on pre-ranking systems to efficiently filter and prioritize candidate ads from large corpora, balancing relevance to users with strict computational constraints. The prevailing two-tower architecture, though highly efficient due to its decoupled design and pre-caching, suffers from cross-domain interaction and coarse similarity metrics, undermining its capacity to model complex user-ad relationships. In this study, we propose the Hierarchical Interaction-Enhanced Two-Tower (HIT) model, a new architecture that augments the two-tower paradigm with two key components: $\textit{generators}$ that pre-generate holistic vectors incorporating coarse-grained user-ad interactions through a dual-generator framework with a cosine-similarity-based generation loss as the training objective, and $\textit{multi-head representers}$ that project embeddings into multiple latent subspaces to capture fine-grained, multi-faceted user interests and multi-dimensional ad attributes. This design enhances modeling effectiveness without compromising inference efficiency. Extensive experiments on public datasets and large-scale online A/B testing on Tencent's advertising platform demonstrate that HIT significantly outperforms several baselines in relevance metrics, yielding a $1.66\%$ increase in Gross Merchandise Volume and a $1.55\%$ improvement in Return on Investment, alongside similar serving latency to the vanilla two-tower models. The HIT model has been successfully deployed in Tencent's online display advertising system, serving billions of impressions daily. The code is available at https://github.com/HarveyYang123/HIT_model.

### QPP-RNG: A Conceptual Quantum System for True Randomness
**Authors**: Randy Kuang

**Updated**: 2025-08-01T20:08:52Z

**Summary**: We propose and experimentally demonstrate the \emph{Quasi-Superposition Quantum-inspired System (QSQS)} -- a conceptual quantum system for randomness generation built on measuring two conjugate observables of a permutation sorting process: the deterministic permutation count $n_p$ and the fundamentally non-deterministic sorting time $t$. By analogy with quantum systems, these observables are linked by an uncertainty-like constraint: algorithmic determinism ensures structural uniformity, while system-level fluctuations introduce irreducible unpredictability. We realize this framework concretely as \emph{QPP-RNG}, a system-embedded, software-based true random number generator (TRNG). In QPP-RNG, real-time measurements of sorting time $t$ -- shaped by CPU pipeline jitter, cache latency, and OS scheduling -- dynamically reseed the PRNG driving the permutation sequence. Crucially, QSQS transforms initially right-skewed raw distributions of $n_p$ and $t$ into nearly uniform outputs after modulo reduction, thanks to internal degeneracies that collapse many distinct states into the same output symbol. Empirical results show that as the repetition factor $m$ increases, output entropy converges toward theoretical maxima: Shannon and min-entropy values approach 8 bits, chi-squared statistics stabilize near ideal uniformity, and bell curves visually confirm the flattening from skewed to uniform distributions. Beyond practical implications, QSQS unifies deterministic algorithmic processes with non-deterministic physical fluctuations, offering a physics-based perspective for engineering true randomness in post-quantum cryptographic systems.

**Updated**: 2025-08-01T14:05:44Z

**Summary**: The CUbesat Solar Polarimeter (CUSP) project is a CubeSat mission orbiting the Earth aimed to measure the linear polarization of solar flares in the hard X-ray band by means of a Compton scattering polarimeter. CUSP will allow to study the magnetic reconnection and particle acceleration in the flaring magnetic structures of our star. CUSP is a project in the framework of the Alcor Program of the Italian Space Agency aimed to develop new CubeSat missions. CUSP undergoing the Phase B started in December 2024 that will last for 12 month. The Compton polarimeter of the CUSP payload performs coincidence measurements between plastic scintilaltors and GaGG(Ce) crystals to derive the polarization of X-rays. These sensors are readout by Multi Anode Photomultiplier Tubes (MAPMTs) and Avalanche Photodiodes (APDs) respectively. Both sensors need an HV power supply up to -1~kV (for the MAPMT) and +500~V (for the APD). We tested precision regulated High Voltage DC/DC Converters by HVM Technology Inc. with Sub-Miniature Case Size ($0.85''\times0.85''\times0.60''$) of the SMHV series. These modules are compact and suited for CubeSat missions.

### Energy-Aware CPU Orchestration in O-RAN: A dApp-Driven Lightweight   Approach
**Authors**: Francisco Crespo, Javier Villegas, Carlos Baena, Eduardo Baena, Sergio Fortes, Raquel Barco

**Updated**: 2025-08-01T13:40:52Z

**Summary**: The transition toward softwarized Radio Access Networks (RANs), driven by the Open RAN (O-RAN) paradigm, enables flexible, vendor-neutral deployments through disaggregation and virtualization of base station functions. However, this shift introduces new challenges in managing CPU resources efficiently under strict real-time constraints. In particular, the interplay between latency-sensitive RAN workloads and general-purpose Operating System (OS) schedulers often leads to sub-optimal performance and unnecessary energy consumption. This work proposes a lightweight, programmable distributed application (dApp) deployed at the Distributed Unit (DU) level to dynamically orchestrate CPU usage. The dApp operates in closed loop with the OS, leveraging thread-level telemetry like context switches, Instructions Per Cycle (IPC), and cache metrics, to adapt CPU thread affinity, core isolation, and frequency scaling in real time. Unlike existing solutions, it requires no access to proprietary RAN software, hardware-specific features, or kernel modifications. Fully compliant with the O-RAN architecture and agnostic to the underlying RAN stack, the proposed solution introduces negligible overhead while improving energy efficiency and CPU utilization. Experimental results using a commercial-grade srsRAN deployment demonstrate consistent power savings without compromising real-time processing performance, highlighting the potential of low-latency dApps for fine-grained resource control in next-generation networks

### Joint Association and Phase Shifts Design for UAV-mounted Stacked   Intelligent Metasurfaces-assisted Communications
**Authors**: Mingzhe Fan, Geng Sun, Hongyang Pan, Jiacheng Wang, Jiancheng An, Hongyang Du, Chau Yuen

**Updated**: 2025-08-01T13:25:28Z

**Summary**: Stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIMs) have emerged as a promising technology for realizing wave-domain signal processing, while the fixed SIMs will limit the communication performance of the system compared to the mobile SIMs. In this work, we consider a UAV-mounted SIMs (UAV-SIMs) assisted communication system, where UAVs as base stations (BSs) can cache the data processed by SIMs, and also as mobile vehicles flexibly deploy SIMs to enhance the communication performance. To this end, we formulate a UAV-SIM-based joint optimization problem (USBJOP) to comprehensively consider the association between UAV-SIMs and users, the locations of UAV-SIMs, and the phase shifts of UAV-SIMs, aiming to maximize the network capacity. Due to the non-convexity and NP-hardness of USBJOP, we decompose it into three sub-optimization problems, which are the association between UAV-SIMs and users optimization problem (AUUOP), the UAV location optimization problem (ULOP), and the UAV-SIM phase shifts optimization problem (USPSOP). Then, these three sub-optimization problems are solved by an alternating optimization (AO) strategy. Specifically, AUUOP and ULOP are transformed to a convex form and then solved by the CVX tool, while we employ a layer-by-layer iterative optimization method for USPSOP. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategy under different simulation setups.

**Authors**: Hanqi Chen, Xu Zhang, Xiaoliu Guan, Lielin Jiang, Guanzhong Wang, Zeyu Chen, Yi Liu

**Updated**: 2025-08-01T08:10:54Z

**Summary**: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated remarkable generative capabilities, particularly benefiting from Transformer architectures that enhance visual and artistic fidelity. However, their inherently sequential denoising process results in high inference latency, limiting their deployment in real-time scenarios. Existing training-free acceleration approaches typically reuse intermediate features at fixed timesteps or layers, overlooking the evolving semantic focus across denoising stages and Transformer blocks.To address this, we propose Sortblock, a training-free inference acceleration framework that dynamically caches block-wise features based on their similarity across adjacent timesteps. By ranking the evolution of residuals, Sortblock adaptively determines a recomputation ratio, selectively skipping redundant computations while preserving generation quality. Furthermore, we incorporate a lightweight linear prediction mechanism to reduce accumulated errors in skipped blocks.Extensive experiments across various tasks and DiT architectures demonstrate that Sortblock achieves over 2$\times$ inference speedup with minimal degradation in output quality, offering an effective and generalizable solution for accelerating diffusion-based generative models.

### SGEMM-cube: Emulating FP32 GEMM on Ascend NPUs Using FP16 Cube Units   with Precision Recovery
**Authors**: Weicheng Xue, Baisong Xu, Kai Yang, Yongxiang Liu, Dengdeng Fan, Pengxiang Xu, Yonghong Tian

**Updated**: 2025-08-01T03:43:24Z

**Summary**: Low-precision matrix engines, such as FP16 cube, offer high throughput but lack support for full-precision computation. In this work, we propose SGEMM-cube, a high-performance algorithm for emulating FP32 general matrix-matrix multiplication (GEMM) using only FP16 computation units on a representative AI accelerator. The method decomposes each FP32 operand into two FP16 values and compensates for numerical errors through a tunable scaling strategy. A detailed analysis of numerical errors, including underflow conditions and precision loss, guides the selection of scaling parameters to preserve up to 22 bits of mantissa accuracy. We further investigate the effect of computation order on accuracy and demonstrate that a term-wise accumulation scheme improves numerical stability over conventional FP32 GEMM in low-exponent regimes. Finally, a cache-aware blocking strategy and double-buffered pipeline are introduced to overlap memory transfers with computation, enabling SGEMM-cube to achieve up to 77\% of the theoretical FP32-equivalent peak performance on Ascend 910A NPU lacking native FP32 support. Extensive numerical experiments confirm that our method not only recovers the accuracy of native FP32 GEMM but also exhibits superior numerical stability under certain conditions, due to its structured and error-aware computation order.

**Authors**: Yanqing Liu, Ruiqing Xue, Chong Zhang, Yufei Liu, Gang Wang, Bohan Li, Yao Qian, Lei He, Shujie Liu, Sheng Zhao

**Updated**: 2025-08-01T03:37:42Z

**Summary**: While diffusion and autoregressive (AR) models have significantly advanced generative modeling, they each present distinct limitations. AR models, which rely on causal attention, cannot exploit future context and suffer from slow generation speeds. Conversely, diffusion models struggle with key-value (KV) caching. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Dragon-FM, a novel text-to-speech (TTS) design that unifies AR and flow-matching. This model processes 48 kHz audio codec tokens in chunks at a compact rate of 12.5 tokens per second. This design enables AR modeling across chunks, ensuring global coherence, while parallel flow-matching within chunks facilitates fast iterative denoising. Thus, the model leverages KV-cache across chunks and utilizes bidirectional context within each chunk. Furthermore, it bridges continuous and discrete feature modeling, demonstrating that continuous AR flow-matching can predict discrete tokens with finite scalar quantizers. This efficient codec and fast chunk-autoregressive architecture also make the model highly effective for generating long-form content, such as podcasts. Experiments on podcast datasets demonstrate its capability to efficiently generate high-quality zero-shot podcasts.

### OmniDraft: A Cross-vocabulary, Online Adaptive Drafter for On-device   Speculative Decoding
**Authors**: Ramchalam Kinattinkara Ramakrishnan, Zhaocong Yuan, Shaojie Zhuo, Chen Feng, Yicheng Lin, Chenzheng Su, Xiaopeng Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-07-31T21:00:28Z

**Summary**: Speculative decoding generally dictates having a small, efficient draft model that is either pretrained or distilled offline to a particular target model series, for instance, Llama or Qwen models. However, within online deployment settings, there are two major challenges: 1) usage of a target model that is incompatible with the draft model; 2) expectation of latency improvements over usage and time. In this work, we propose OmniDraft, a unified framework that enables a single draft model to operate with any target model and adapt dynamically to user data. We introduce an online n-gram cache with hybrid distillation fine-tuning to address the cross-vocabulary mismatch across draft and target models; and further improve decoding speed by leveraging adaptive drafting techniques. OmniDraft is particularly suitable for on-device LLM applications where model cost, efficiency and user customization are the major points of contention. This further highlights the need to tackle the above challenges and motivates the \textit{``one drafter for all''} paradigm. We showcase the proficiency of the OmniDraft framework by performing online learning on math reasoning, coding and text generation tasks. Notably, OmniDraft enables a single Llama-68M model to pair with various target models including Vicuna-7B, Qwen2-7B and Llama3-8B models for speculative decoding; and additionally provides up to 1.5-2x speedup.

### SAM: A Stability-Aware Cache Manager for Multi-Tenant Embedded Databases
**Authors**: Haoran Zhang, Decheng Zuo, Yu Yan, Zhiyu Liang, Hongzhi Wang

**Updated**: 2025-07-31T16:21:03Z

**Summary**: The co-location of multiple database instances on resource constrained edge nodes creates significant cache contention, where traditional schemes are inefficient and unstable under dynamic workloads. To address this, we present SAM(a Stability-Aware Manager), an autonomic cache manager that establishes decision stability as a first-class design principle. It achieves this through its core control policy, AURA(Autonomic Utility-balancing Resource Allocator), which resolves the classic exploitation-exploration dilemma by synthesizing two orthogonal factors: the H-factor, representing proven historical efficiency (exploitation), and the V-factor, for estimated marginal gain (exploration). Through this practical synthesis and adaptive control, SAM achieves sustained high performance with strategic stability and robustness in volatile conditions.   Extensive experiments against 14 diverse baselines demonstrate SAM's superiority. It achieves top-tier throughput while being uniquely resilient to complex workload shifts and adversarial workloads like cache pollution. Furthermore, its decision latency is highly scalable, remaining nearly constant as the system grows to 120 databases. Crucially, SAM achieves superior decision stability -- maintaining consistent optimization directions despite noise, avoiding performance oscillations while ensuring predictable Quality of Service. These results prove that a principled, stability-aware design is essential for sustained high performance in real-world, large-scale systems.

**Updated**: 2025-07-31T15:50:57Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) process millions of queries daily, making efficient response caching a compelling optimization for reducing cost and latency. However, preserving relevance to user queries using this approach proves difficult due to the personalized nature of chatbot interactions and the limited accuracy of semantic similarity search. To address this, we present TweakLLM, a novel routing architecture that employs a lightweight LLM to dynamically adapt cached responses to incoming prompts. Through comprehensive evaluation, including user studies with side-by-side comparisons, satisfaction voting, as well as multi-agent LLM debates, we demonstrate that TweakLLM maintains response quality comparable to frontier models while significantly improving cache effectiveness. Our results across real-world datasets highlight TweakLLM as a scalable, resource-efficient caching solution for high-volume LLM deployments without compromising user experience.

### MemShare: Memory Efficient Inference for Large Reasoning Models through   KV Cache Reuse
**Authors**: Kaiwen Chen, Xin Tan, Minchen Yu, Hong Xu

**Updated**: 2025-07-31T07:53:53Z

**Summary**: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved significant advances in mathematical reasoning and formal logic tasks. However, their tendency to generate lengthy chain-of-thought sequences leads to substantial memory overhead during inference. We observe that LRMs frequently produce highly similar intermediate reasoning steps, which correspond to similar KV cache states across layers. Motivated by this observation, we propose MemShare, a novel KV cache management approach that effectively reduces memory overhead. MemShare employs a collaborative filtering algorithm to efficiently identify reusable KV cache blocks and enables zero copy cache reuse to significantly reduce memory overhead, improve throughput while maintaining accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that MemShare delivers up to 84.79\% improvement in throughput while maintaining better accuracy compared to existing KV cache management methods.

### LiteGS: A High-performance Framework to Train 3DGS in Subminutes via   System and Algorithm Codesign
**Authors**: Kaimin Liao, Hua Wang, Zhi Chen, Luchao Wang, Yaohua Tang

**Updated**: 2025-07-31T07:35:04Z

**Summary**: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as promising alternative in 3D representation. However, it still suffers from high training cost. This paper introduces LiteGS, a high performance framework that systematically optimizes the 3DGS training pipeline from multiple aspects. At the low-level computation layer, we design a ``warp-based raster'' associated with two hardware-aware optimizations to significantly reduce gradient reduction overhead. At the mid-level data management layer, we introduce dynamic spatial sorting based on Morton coding to enable a performant ``Cluster-Cull-Compact'' pipeline and improve data locality, therefore reducing cache misses. At the top-level algorithm layer, we establish a new robust densification criterion based on the variance of the opacity gradient, paired with a more stable opacity control mechanism, to achieve more precise parameter growth. Experimental results demonstrate that LiteGS accelerates the original 3DGS training by up to 13.4x with comparable or superior quality and surpasses the current SOTA in lightweight models by up to 1.4x speedup. For high-quality reconstruction tasks, LiteGS sets a new accuracy record and decreases the training time by an order of magnitude.

### SequenceLayers: Sequence Processing and Streaming Neural Networks Made   Easy
**Authors**: RJ Skerry-Ryan, Julian Salazar, Soroosh Mariooryad, David Kao, Daisy Stanton, Eric Battenberg, Matt Shannon, Ron J. Weiss, Robin Scheibler, Jonas Rothfuss, Tom Bagby

**Updated**: 2025-07-31T07:10:39Z

**Summary**: We introduce a neural network layer API and library for sequence modeling, designed for easy creation of sequence models that can be executed both layer-by-layer (e.g., teacher-forced training) and step-by-step (e.g., autoregressive sampling). To achieve this, layers define an explicit representation of their state over time (e.g., a Transformer KV cache, a convolution buffer, an RNN hidden state), and a step method that evolves that state, tested to give identical results to a stateless layer-wise invocation. This and other aspects of the SequenceLayers contract enables complex models to be immediately streamable, mitigates a wide range of common bugs arising in both streaming and parallel sequence processing, and can be implemented in any deep learning library. A composable and declarative API, along with a comprehensive suite of layers and combinators, streamlines the construction of production-scale models from simple streamable components while preserving strong correctness guarantees. Our current implementations of SequenceLayers (JAX, TensorFlow 2) are available at https://github.com/google/sequence-layers.

**Authors**: Yukang Chen, Wei Huang, Baifeng Shi, Qinghao Hu, Hanrong Ye, Ligeng Zhu, Zhijian Liu, Pavlo Molchanov, Jan Kautz, Xiaojuan Qi, Sifei Liu, Hongxu Yin, Yao Lu, Song Han

**Updated**: 2025-07-30T16:55:33Z

**Summary**: We introduce a full-stack framework that scales up reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs) to long videos, leveraging reinforcement learning. We address the unique challenges of long video reasoning by integrating three critical components: (1) a large-scale dataset, LongVideo-Reason, comprising 104K long video QA pairs with high-quality reasoning annotations across diverse domains such as sports, games, and vlogs; (2) a two-stage training pipeline that extends VLMs with chain-of-thought supervised fine-tuning (CoT-SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL); and (3) a training infrastructure for long video RL, named Multi-modal Reinforcement Sequence Parallelism (MR-SP), which incorporates sequence parallelism and a vLLM-based engine tailored for long video, using cached video embeddings for efficient rollout and prefilling. In our experiments, LongVILA-R1-7B achieves strong performance on video benchmarks, reaching 65.1% and 71.1% accuracy on VideoMME without and with subtitles, respectively, and consistently outperforming LongVILA-7B across multiple benchmarks. Moreover, LongVILA-R1-7B supports processing up to 8,192 video frames per video, and configurable FPS settings. Notably, our MR-SP system achieves up to 2.1x speedup on long video RL training. In addition, we release our training system for public availability that supports RL training on various modalities (video, text, and audio), various models (VILA and Qwen series), and even image and video generation models. On a single A100 node (8 GPUs), it supports RL training on hour-long videos (e.g., 3,600 frames).

### DSPE: Profit Maximization in Edge-Cloud Storage System using Dynamic   Space Partitioning with Erasure Code
**Authors**: Shubhradeep Roy, Suvarthi Sarkar, Vivek Verma, Aryabartta Sahu

**Updated**: 2025-07-30T16:04:01Z

**Summary**: Edge Storage Systems have emerged as a critical enabler of low latency data access in modern cloud networks by bringing storage and computation closer to end users. However, the limited storage capacity of edge servers poses significant challenges in handling high volume and latency sensitive data access requests, particularly under dynamic workloads. In this work, we propose a profit driven framework that integrates three key mechanisms which are collaborative caching, erasure coding, and elastic storage partitioning. Unlike traditional replication, erasure coding enables space efficient redundancy, allowing data to be reconstructed from any subset of K out of K plus M coded blocks. We dynamically partition each edge server s storage into private and public regions. The private region is further subdivided among access points based on their incoming request rates, enabling adaptive control over data locality and ownership. We design a data placement and replacement policy that determines how and where to store or evict coded data blocks to maximize data access within deadlines. While the private region serves requests from local APs, the public region handles cooperative storage requests from neighboring servers. Our proposed Dynamic Space Partitioning and Elastic caching strategy is evaluated on both synthetic and real world traces from Netflix and Spotify. Experimental results show that our method improves overall system profitability by approximately 5 to 8% compared to state of the art approaches under varied workload conditions.

### All-gluon amplitudes with off-shell recursion in multiplet bases
**Authors**: Oskar Bolinder, Rikkert Frederix, Malin Sjodahl

**Updated**: 2025-07-30T12:55:55Z

**Summary**: The efficient computation of color-summed QCD amplitudes at high parton multiplicities remains a central challenge for precision collider predictions. Existing approaches using trace, color-flow, or adjoint bases suffer from non-orthogonality, which complicates the color algebra and scales poorly with multiplicity. In this work, we present an off-shell recursive framework for computing all-gluon tree-level amplitudes directly in orthogonal multiplet bases. Utilizing Wigner $6j$ coefficients, we construct an algorithm that builds multiplet-projected off-shell currents from lower-point currents. By optimizing the recursion through partial summation and caching, we find that the computational complexity of calculating $n$-gluon color-summed squared amplitudes scales as $\mathcal{O}(17^n)$. This demonstrates the potential competitiveness of multiplet bases for high-multiplicity processes.

### SmallThinker: A Family of Efficient Large Language Models Natively   Trained for Local Deployment
**Authors**: Yixin Song, Zhenliang Xue, Dongliang Wei, Feiyang Chen, Jianxiang Gao, Junchen Liu, Hangyu Liang, Guangshuo Qin, Chengrong Tian, Bo Wen, Longyu Zhao, Xinrui Zheng, Zeyu Mi, Haibo Chen

**Updated**: 2025-07-30T06:29:40Z

**Summary**: While frontier large language models (LLMs) continue to push capability boundaries, their deployment remains confined to GPU-powered cloud infrastructure. We challenge this paradigm with SmallThinker, a family of LLMs natively designed - not adapted - for the unique constraints of local devices: weak computational power, limited memory, and slow storage. Unlike traditional approaches that mainly compress existing models built for clouds, we architect SmallThinker from the ground up to thrive within these limitations. Our innovation lies in a deployment-aware architecture that transforms constraints into design principles. First, We introduce a two-level sparse structure combining fine-grained Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with sparse feed-forward networks, drastically reducing computational demands without sacrificing model capacity. Second, to conquer the I/O bottleneck of slow storage, we design a pre-attention router that enables our co-designed inference engine to prefetch expert parameters from storage while computing attention, effectively hiding storage latency that would otherwise cripple on-device inference. Third, for memory efficiency, we utilize NoPE-RoPE hybrid sparse attention mechanism to slash KV cache requirements. We release SmallThinker-4B-A0.6B and SmallThinker-21B-A3B, which achieve state-of-the-art performance scores and even outperform larger LLMs. Remarkably, our co-designed system mostly eliminates the need for expensive GPU hardware: with Q4_0 quantization, both models exceed 20 tokens/s on ordinary consumer CPUs, while consuming only 1GB and 8GB of memory respectively. SmallThinker is publicly available at hf.co/PowerInfer/SmallThinker-4BA0.6B-Instruct and hf.co/PowerInfer/SmallThinker-21BA3B-Instruct.

**Authors**: Haoyang Li, Yiming Li, Anxin Tian, Tianhao Tang, Zhanchao Xu, Xuejia Chen, Nicole Hu, Wei Dong, Qing Li, Lei Chen

**Updated**: 2025-07-30T05:24:46Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized a wide range of domains such as natural language processing, computer vision, and multi-modal tasks due to their ability to comprehend context and perform logical reasoning. However, the computational and memory demands of LLMs, particularly during inference, pose significant challenges when scaling them to real-world, long-context, and real-time applications. Key-Value (KV) cache management has emerged as a critical optimization technique for accelerating LLM inference by reducing redundant computations and improving memory utilization. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of KV cache management strategies for LLM acceleration, categorizing them into token-level, model-level, and system-level optimizations. Token-level strategies include KV cache selection, budget allocation, merging, quantization, and low-rank decomposition, while model-level optimizations focus on architectural innovations and attention mechanisms to enhance KV reuse. System-level approaches address memory management, scheduling, and hardware-aware designs to improve efficiency across diverse computing environments. Additionally, the survey provides an overview of both text and multimodal datasets and benchmarks used to evaluate these strategies. By presenting detailed taxonomies and comparative analyses, this work aims to offer useful insights for researchers and practitioners to support the development of efficient and scalable KV cache management techniques, contributing to the practical deployment of LLMs in real-world applications.

### Forecasting LLM Inference Performance via Hardware-Agnostic Analytical   Modeling
**Authors**: Rajeev Patwari, Ashish Sirasao, Devleena Das

**Updated**: 2025-07-29T03:08:31Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly deployed as local agents on personal devices with CPUs, NPUs and integrated GPUs. However, forecasting inference performance on devices with such heterogeneity remains challenging due to the dynamic compute and memory demands. Existing approaches rely on GPU benchmarking or machine learning-based latency predictors, which are often hardware-specific and lack generalizability. To this end, we introduce LIFE, a lightweight and modular analytical framework that is comprised of modular analytical model of operators, configurable to characterize LLM inference workloads in a hardware and dataset-agnostic manner. LIFE characterizes the influence of software and model optimizations, such as quantization, KV cache compression, LoRA adapters, chunked prefill, different attentions, and operator fusion, on performance metrics such as time-to-first-token (TTFT), time-per-output-token (TPOT) and tokens-per-second (TPS). LIFE enables performance forecasting using only hardware specifications, such as TOPS and memory bandwidth, without requiring extensive dataset benchmarking. We validate LIFE's forecasting with inference on AMD Ryzen CPUs, NPUs, iGPUs and NVIDIA V100 GPUs, with Llama2-7B variants, demonstrating the utility of LIFE in forecasting LLM performance through lens of system efficiency to enable efficient LLM deployment across different hardware platforms.

### SQuat: Subspace-orthogonal KV Cache Quantization
**Authors**: Hao Wang, Ligong Han, Kai Xu, Akash Srivastava

**Updated**: 2025-07-28T20:44:23Z

**Summary**: The key-value (KV) cache accelerates LLMs decoding by storing KV tensors from previously generated tokens. It reduces redundant computation at the cost of increased memory usage. To mitigate this overhead, existing approaches compress KV tensors into lower-bit representations; however, quantization errors can accumulate as more tokens are generated, potentially resulting in undesired outputs. In this paper, we introduce SQuat (Subspace-orthogonal KV cache quantization). It first constructs a subspace spanned by query tensors to capture the most critical task-related information. During key tensor quantization, it enforces that the difference between the (de)quantized and original keys remains orthogonal to this subspace, minimizing the impact of quantization errors on the attention mechanism's outputs. SQuat requires no model fine-tuning, no additional calibration dataset for offline learning, and is grounded in a theoretical framework we develop. Through numerical experiments, we show that our method reduces peak memory by 2.17 to 2.82, improves throughput by 2.45 to 3.60, and achieves more favorable benchmark scores than existing KV cache quantization algorithms.

### REDS: Resource-Efficient Deep Subnetworks for Dynamic Resource   Constraints
**Authors**: Francesco Corti, Balz Maag, Joachim Schauer, Ulrich Pferschy, Olga Saukh

**Updated**: 2025-07-28T14:11:53Z

**Summary**: Deep learning models deployed on edge devices frequently encounter resource variability, which arises from fluctuating energy levels, timing constraints, or prioritization of other critical tasks within the system. State-of-the-art machine learning pipelines generate resource-agnostic models that are not capable to adapt at runtime. In this work, we introduce Resource-Efficient Deep Subnetworks (REDS) to tackle model adaptation to variable resources. In contrast to the state-of-the-art, REDS leverages structured sparsity constructively by exploiting permutation invariance of neurons, which allows for hardware-specific optimizations. Specifically, REDS achieves computational efficiency by (1) skipping sequential computational blocks identified by a novel iterative knapsack optimizer, and (2) taking advantage of data cache by re-arranging the order of operations in REDS computational graph. REDS supports conventional deep networks frequently deployed on the edge and provides computational benefits even for small and simple networks. We evaluate REDS on eight benchmark architectures trained on the Visual Wake Words, Google Speech Commands, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-1K datasets, and test on four off-the-shelf mobile and embedded hardware platforms. We provide a theoretical result and empirical evidence demonstrating REDS' outstanding performance in terms of submodels' test set accuracy, and demonstrate an adaptation time in response to dynamic resource constraints of under 40$\mu$s, utilizing a fully-connected network on Arduino Nano 33 BLE.

### Quantum Circuit Caches and Compressors for Low Latency, High Throughput   Computing
**Authors**: Ioana Moflic, Alan Robertson, Simon J. Devitt, Alexandru Paler

**Updated**: 2025-07-28T09:59:22Z

**Summary**: Utility-scale quantum programs contain operations on the order of $>10^{15}$ which must be prepared and piped from a classical co-processor to the control unit of the quantum device. The latency of this process significantly increases with the size of the program: existing high-level classical representations of quantum programs are typically memory intensive and do not na\"ively efficiently scale to the degree required to execute utility-scale programs in real-time. To combat this limitation, we propose the utilization of high-level quantum circuit caches and compressors. The first save on the time associated with repetitive tasks and sub-circuits, and the latter are useful for representing the programs/circuits in memory-efficient formats. We present numerical evidence that caches and compressors can offer five orders of magnitude lower latencies during the automatic transpilation of extremely large quantum circuits.

### Enhancing Large Multimodal Models with Adaptive Sparsity and KV Cache   Compression
**Authors**: Te Zhang, Yuheng Li, Junxiang Wang, Lujun Li

**Updated**: 2025-07-28T08:27:40Z

**Summary**: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have advanced significantly by integrating visual encoders with extensive language models, enabling robust reasoning capabilities. However, compressing LMMs for deployment on edge devices remains a critical challenge. In this work, we propose an adaptive search algorithm that optimizes sparsity and KV cache compression to enhance LMM efficiency. Utilizing the Tree-structured Parzen Estimator, our method dynamically adjusts pruning ratios and KV cache quantization bandwidth across different LMM layers, using model performance as the optimization objective. This approach uniquely combines pruning with key-value cache quantization and incorporates a fast pruning technique that eliminates the need for additional fine-tuning or weight adjustments, achieving efficient compression without compromising accuracy. Comprehensive evaluations on benchmark datasets, including LLaVA-1.5 7B and 13B, demonstrate our method superiority over state-of-the-art techniques such as SparseGPT and Wanda across various compression levels. Notably, our framework automatic allocation of KV cache compression resources sets a new standard in LMM optimization, delivering memory efficiency without sacrificing much performance.

**Summary**: We address the problem of learning-augmented online caching in the scenario when each request is accompanied by a prediction of the next occurrence of the requested page. We improve currently known bounds on the competitive ratio of the BlindOracle algorithm, which evicts a page predicted to be requested last. We also prove a lower bound on the competitive ratio of any randomized algorithm and show that a combination of the BlindOracle with the Marker algorithm achieves a competitive ratio that is optimal up to some constant.

### GATE: Geometry-Aware Trained Encoding
**Authors**: Jakub Bokšanský, Daniel Meister, Carsten Benthin

**Updated**: 2025-07-27T09:58:25Z

**Summary**: The encoding of input parameters is one of the fundamental building blocks of neural network algorithms. Its goal is to map the input data to a higher-dimensional space, typically supported by trained feature vectors. The mapping is crucial for the efficiency and approximation quality of neural networks. We propose a novel geometry-aware encoding called GATE that stores feature vectors on the surface of triangular meshes. Our encoding is suitable for neural rendering-related algorithms, for example, neural radiance caching. It also avoids limitations of previous hash-based encoding schemes, such as hash collisions, selection of resolution versus scene size, and divergent memory access. Our approach decouples feature vector density from geometry density using mesh colors, while allowing for finer control over neural network training and adaptive level-of-detail.

### High-Performance Parallel Optimization of the Fish School Behaviour on   the Setonix Platform Using OpenMP
**Authors**: Haitian Wang, Long Qin

**Updated**: 2025-07-27T08:25:08Z

**Summary**: This paper presents an in-depth investigation into the high-performance parallel optimization of the Fish School Behaviour (FSB) algorithm on the Setonix supercomputing platform using the OpenMP framework. Given the increasing demand for enhanced computational capabilities for complex, large-scale calculations across diverse domains, there's an imperative need for optimized parallel algorithms and computing structures. The FSB algorithm, inspired by nature's social behavior patterns, provides an ideal platform for parallelization due to its iterative and computationally intensive nature. This study leverages the capabilities of the Setonix platform and the OpenMP framework to analyze various aspects of multi-threading, such as thread counts, scheduling strategies, and OpenMP constructs, aiming to discern patterns and strategies that can elevate program performance. Experiments were designed to rigorously test different configurations, and our results not only offer insights for parallel optimization of FSB on Setonix but also provide valuable references for other parallel computational research using OpenMP. Looking forward, other factors, such as cache behavior and thread scheduling strategies at micro and macro levels, hold potential for further exploration and optimization.

**Authors**: Yinuo Deng, Hailiang Zhao, Dongjing Wang, Peng Chen, Wenzhuo Qian, Jianwei Yin, Schahram Dustdar, Shuiguang Deng

**Updated**: 2025-07-27T03:45:07Z

**Summary**: Efficient container image distribution is crucial for enabling machine learning inference at the network edge, where resource limitations and dynamic network conditions create significant challenges. In this paper, we present PeerSync, a decentralized P2P-based system designed to optimize image distribution in edge environments. PeerSync employs a popularity- and network-aware download engine that dynamically adapts to content popularity and real-time network conditions using a sliding window mechanism. PeerSync further integrates automated tracker election for rapid peer discovery and dynamic cache management for efficient storage utilization. We implement PeerSync with 8000+ lines of Rust code and test its performance extensively on both physical edge devices and Docker-based emulations. Experimental results show that PeerSync delivers a remarkable speed increase of 2.72$\times$, 1.79$\times$, and 1.28$\times$ compared to the Baseline, Dragonfly, and Kraken, respectively, while significantly reducing peak cross-network traffic by 90.72\% under congested and varying network conditions.

### Beyond Self-Repellent Kernels: History-Driven Target Towards Efficient   Nonlinear MCMC on General Graphs
**Authors**: Jie Hu, Yi-Ting Ma, Do Young Eun

**Updated**: 2025-07-27T00:40:47Z

**Summary**: We propose a history-driven target (HDT) framework in Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to improve any random walk algorithm on discrete state spaces, such as general undirected graphs, for efficient sampling from target distribution $\boldsymbol{\mu}$. With broad applications in network science and distributed optimization, recent innovations like the self-repellent random walk (SRRW) achieve near-zero variance by prioritizing under-sampled states through transition kernel modifications based on past visit frequencies. However, SRRW's reliance on explicit computation of transition probabilities for all neighbors at each step introduces substantial computational overhead, while its strict dependence on time-reversible Markov chains excludes advanced non-reversible MCMC methods. To overcome these limitations, instead of direct modification of transition kernel, HDT introduces a history-dependent target distribution $\boldsymbol{\pi}[\mathbf{x}]$ to replace the original target $\boldsymbol{\mu}$ in any graph sampler, where $\mathbf{x}$ represents the empirical measure of past visits. This design preserves lightweight implementation by requiring only local information between the current and proposed states and achieves compatibility with both reversible and non-reversible MCMC samplers, while retaining unbiased samples with target distribution $\boldsymbol{\mu}$ and near-zero variance performance. Extensive experiments in graph sampling demonstrate consistent performance gains, and a memory-efficient Least Recently Used (LRU) cache ensures scalability to large general graphs.

### FAEDKV: Infinite-Window Fourier Transform for Unbiased KV Cache   Compression
**Authors**: Runchao Li, Yao Fu, Mu Sheng, Xianxuan Long, Haotian Yu, Pan Li

**Updated**: 2025-07-26T18:20:25Z

**Summary**: The efficacy of Large Language Models (LLMs) in long-context tasks is often hampered by the substantial memory footprint and computational demands of the Key-Value (KV) cache. Current compression strategies, including token eviction and learned projections, frequently lead to biased representations -- either by overemphasizing recent/high-attention tokens or by repeatedly degrading information from earlier context -- and may require costly model retraining. We present FAEDKV (Frequency-Adaptive Infinite-Window for KV cache), a novel, training-free KV cache compression framework that ensures unbiased information retention. FAEDKV operates by transforming the KV cache into the frequency domain using a proposed Infinite-Window Fourier Transform (IWDFT). This approach allows for the equalized contribution of all tokens to the compressed representation, effectively preserving both early and recent contextual information. A preliminary frequency ablation study identifies critical spectral components for layer-wise, targeted compression. Experiments on LongBench benchmark demonstrate FAEDKV's superiority over existing methods by up to 22\%. In addition, our method shows superior, position-agnostic retrieval accuracy on the Needle-In-A-Haystack task compared to compression based approaches.

### Model Reveals What to Cache: Profiling-Based Feature Reuse for Video   Diffusion Models
**Authors**: Xuran Ma, Yexin Liu, Yaofu Liu, Xianfeng Wu, Mingzhe Zheng, Zihao Wang, Ser-Nam Lim, Harry Yang

**Updated**: 2025-07-26T15:25:22Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in video generation. However, the computational intensity remains a significant challenge for practical applications. While feature caching has been proposed to reduce the computational burden of diffusion models, existing methods typically overlook the heterogeneous significance of individual blocks, resulting in suboptimal reuse and degraded output quality. To this end, we address this gap by introducing ProfilingDiT, a novel adaptive caching strategy that explicitly disentangles foreground and background-focused blocks. Through a systematic analysis of attention distributions in diffusion models, we reveal a key observation: 1) Most layers exhibit a consistent preference for either foreground or background regions. 2) Predicted noise shows low inter-step similarity initially, which stabilizes as denoising progresses. This finding inspires us to formulate a selective caching strategy that preserves full computation for dynamic foreground elements while efficiently caching static background features. Our approach substantially reduces computational overhead while preserving visual fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves significant acceleration (e.g., 2.01 times speedup for Wan2.1) while maintaining visual fidelity across comprehensive quality metrics, establishing a viable method for efficient video generation.

### NestQuant: Nested Lattice Quantization for Matrix Products and LLMs
**Authors**: Semyon Savkin, Eitan Porat, Or Ordentlich, Yury Polyanskiy

**Updated**: 2025-07-26T15:13:56Z

**Summary**: Post-training quantization (PTQ) has emerged as a critical technique for efficient deployment of large language models (LLMs). This work proposes NestQuant, a novel PTQ scheme for weights and activations that is based on self-similar nested lattices. Recent works have mathematically shown such quantizers to be information-theoretically optimal for low-precision matrix multiplication. We implement a practical low-complexity version of NestQuant based on Gosset lattice, making it a drop-in quantizer for any matrix multiplication step (e.g., in self-attention, MLP etc). For example, NestQuant quantizes weights, KV-cache, and activations of Llama-3-8B to 4 bits, achieving perplexity of 6.6 on wikitext2. This represents more than 55% reduction in perplexity gap with respect to unquantized model (perplexity of 6.14) compared to state-of-the-art Metas SpinQuant (perplexity 7.3), OstQuant (7.3) and QuaRot (8.2). Comparisons on bigger models (up to 70B) and on various LLM evaluation benchmarks confirm uniform superiority of NestQuant.

### Align Attention Heads Before Merging Them: An Effective Way for   Converting MHA to GQA
**Authors**: Qingyun Jin, Xiaohui Song, Feng Zhou, Zengchang Qin

**Updated**: 2025-07-26T13:33:06Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance across diverse natural language processing tasks. However, as the model size and the input sequence's length increase, the linearly increasing key-value (KV) cache significantly degrades inference throughput. Therefore, grouped-query attention (GQA), as an alternative to multi-head attention (MHA), has been widely introduced into LLMs. In this work, we propose a cost-effective method for converting MHA into GQA with any compression ratio of KV heads. The key point of our method lies in the application of Procrustes analysis to the attention heads, which enhances the similarity among attention heads while preserving computational invariance, thereby improving the model's post-training performance. Subsequently, we employ $\mathit{L_0}$ regularization to prune redundant parameters. The model after pruning can be adapted to the standard GQA framework. Experimental results show that our strategy can compress up to 87.5\% KV heads of LLaMA2-7B model and 75\% KV heads of Sheared-LLaMA-1.3B with acceptable performance degradation. Our code is released at https://github.com/fpcsong/mha2gqa.

### HCAttention: Extreme KV Cache Compression via Heterogeneous Attention   Computing for LLMs
**Authors**: Dongquan Yang, Yifan Yang, Xiaotian Yu, Xianbiao Qi, Rong Xiao

**Updated**: 2025-07-26T06:43:14Z

**Summary**: Processing long-context inputs with large language models presents a significant challenge due to the enormous memory requirements of the Key-Value (KV) cache during inference. Existing KV cache compression methods exhibit noticeable performance degradation when memory is reduced by more than 85%. Additionally, strategies that leverage GPU-CPU collaboration for approximate attention remain underexplored in this setting. We propose HCAttention, a heterogeneous attention computation framework that integrates key quantization, value offloading, and dynamic KV eviction to enable efficient inference under extreme memory constraints. The method is compatible with existing transformer architectures and does not require model fine-tuning. Experimental results on the LongBench benchmark demonstrate that our approach preserves the accuracy of full-attention model while shrinking the KV cache memory footprint to 25% of its original size. Remarkably, it stays competitive with only 12.5% of the cache, setting a new state-of-the-art in LLM KV cache compression. To the best of our knowledge, HCAttention is the first to extend the Llama-3-8B model to process 4 million tokens on a single A100 GPU with 80GB memory.

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) face low hardware efficiency during decoding, especially for long-context reasoning tasks. This paper introduces Step-3, a 321B-parameter VLM with hardware-aware model-system co-design optimized for minimizing decoding costs. Step-3 innovates in two key dimensions: (1) A novel Multi-Matrix Factorization Attention (MFA) mechanism that significantly reduces both KV cache size and computation while maintaining high attention expressiveness, and (2) Attention-FFN Disaggregation (AFD), a distributed inference system that decouples attention and Feed-Forward Network (FFN) layers into specialized subsystems. This co-design achieves unprecedented cost efficiency: Step-3 significantly reduces theoretical decoding costs compared with models like DeepSeek-V3 and Qwen3 MoE 235B, with the gains widening at longer context. Step-3 achieves low cost while activating 38B parameters per token (more than DeepSeek-V3 and Qwen3 MoE 235B), demonstrating that hardware-aligned attention arithmetic intensity, MoE sparsity, and AFD are critical to cost-effectiveness. We perform a head-to-head comparison with DeepSeek-V3 in its favorable scenarios. Our implementation on Hopper GPUs achieves a decoding throughput of up to 4,039 tokens per second per GPU under 50ms TPOT SLA (4K context, FP8, no MTP). It is higher than DeepSeek-V3's 2,324 in the same setup and sets a new Pareto frontier for LLM decoding.

### Empowering IoT Firmware Secure Update with Customization Rights
**Authors**: Weihao Chen, Yansong Gao, Boyu Kuang, Jin B. Hong, Yuqing Zhang, Anmin Fu

**Updated**: 2025-07-25T15:17:29Z

**Summary**: Firmware updates remain the primary line of defense for IoT devices; however, the update channel itself has become a well-established attack vector. Existing defenses mainly focus on securing monolithic firmware images, leaving module-level customization -a growing user demand-largely unprotected and insufficiently explored. To address this gap, we conduct a pilot study on the update workflows of 200 Linux-based IoT devices across 23 vendors, uncovering five previously undocumented vulnerabilities caused by customization practices. A broader analysis of update-related CVEs from 2020 to 2024 reveals that over half originate from customization-induced issues. These findings highlight a critical yet underexamined reality: as customization increases, so does the attack surface, while current defenses fail to keep pace. We propose IMUP (Integrity-Centric Modular Update Platform), the first framework to address two key challenges: constructing a trustworthy cross-module integrity chain and scaling update performance under mass customization. IMUP combines three techniques: per-module chameleon hashing for integrity, server-side proof-of-work offloading to reduce device overhead, and server-side caching to reuse module combinations, minimizing rebuild costs. Security analysis shows that even when 95 percent of secret keys are exposed, forging a valid image incurs over 300 times the cost of the legitimate server. Experiments on heterogeneous IoT devices demonstrate that IMUP reduces server-side generation time by 2.9 times and device downtime by 5.9 times compared to a package-manager baseline.

### General kinetic ion induced electron emission model for metallic walls   applied to biased Z-pinch electrodes
**Authors**: Chirag R. Skolar, Kolter Bradshaw, Manaure Francisquez, Lucio Murillo, Vignesh Krishna Kumar, Bhuvana Srinivasan

**Updated**: 2025-07-24T19:44:36Z

**Summary**: A kinetic ion induced electron emission (IIEE) model for general applications is developed to obtain the emitted electron energy spectrum for a distribution of ion impacts on a metallic surface. We assume an ionization cascade mechanism and use empirical models for the ion and electron stopping powers. The emission spectrum and the secondary electron yield (SEY) are validated for a variety of materials. The IIEE model is used to study the effect of IIEE on the plasma-material interactions of Z-pinch electrodes. Un-magnetized Boltzmann-Poisson simulations are performed for a Z-pinch plasma doubly bounded by two biased copper electrodes with and without IIEE at bias potentials from 0 to 9 kV. At the anode, the SEY decreases from 0 to 1 kV, but then increases at higher bias potentials. At the cathode, the SEY is much larger due to higher energy ion bombardment and grows with bias potential. As the bias potential increases, the emitted cathode electrons are accelerated to higher energies into the domain collisionally heating the plasma. Above 1 kV, the heating is strong enough to increase the plasma potential. Despite SEY greater than 1, only a classical sheath forms as opposed to a space-charge limited or inverse sheath due to the emitted electron flux not reaching the space charge current saturation limits. Furthermore, the current in the emissionless cases saturates to a value lower than experiment. With IIEE, the current does not saturate and continues to increase with the 4 kV case matching most closely with experiment.

### Sparse Logit Sampling: Accelerating Knowledge Distillation in LLMs
**Authors**: Anshumann, Mohd Abbas Zaidi, Akhil Kedia, Jinwoo Ahn, Taehwak Kwon, Kangwook Lee, Haejun Lee, Joohyung Lee

**Updated**: 2025-07-24T17:30:12Z

**Summary**: Knowledge distillation can be a cost-effective technique to distill knowledge in Large Language Models, if the teacher output logits can be pre-computed and cached. However, successfully applying this to pre-training remains largely unexplored. In this work, we prove that naive approaches for sparse knowledge distillation such as caching Top-K probabilities, while intuitive, provide biased estimates of teacher probability distribution to the student, resulting in suboptimal performance and calibration. We propose an importance-sampling-based method `Random Sampling Knowledge Distillation', which provides unbiased estimates, preserves the gradient in expectation, and requires storing significantly sparser logits. Our method enables faster training of student models with marginal overhead (<10%) compared to cross-entropy based training, while maintaining competitive performance compared to full distillation, across a range of model sizes from 300M to 3B.

### LagKV: Lag-Relative Information of the KV Cache Tells Which Tokens Are   Important
**Authors**: Manlai Liang, JiaMing Zhang, Xiong Li, Jinlong Li

**Updated**: 2025-07-24T16:25:51Z

**Summary**: The increasing size of the Key-Value (KV) cache during the Large Language Models long-context inference is the main obstacle for its balance between the deployment cost and task accuracy. To reduce the KV cache size in such scenarios, most previous efforts leveraged on the attention weight to evict non-critical cache tokens. But there is a trade-off in those methods, they usually require major modification of the inference infrastructure and significant computation overhead. Based on the fact that the Large Language models are autoregressive models, we propose LagKV, a KV compression strategy only relying on straight forward comparison among KV themselves. It is a totally attention free method which offers easy integration to the main stream inference platform and comparable performance comparing to other complicated KV compression methods. Results on RULER benchmark show that, our approach outperforms SnapKV and StreamingLLM in different compression ratios. Especially in the 64-digit passkey retrieval task, our method outperforms the attention weight based method $H_2O$ over $50\%$ with same compression ratios. Our code is available at https://github.com/AI-Lab-China-Merchants-Bank/LagKV.

### Streaming Sortformer: Speaker Cache-Based Online Speaker Diarization   with Arrival-Time Ordering
**Authors**: Ivan Medennikov, Taejin Park, Weiqing Wang, He Huang, Kunal Dhawan, Jinhan Wang, Jagadeesh Balam, Boris Ginsburg

**Updated**: 2025-07-24T14:30:48Z

**Summary**: This paper presents a streaming extension for the Sortformer speaker diarization framework, whose key property is the arrival-time ordering of output speakers. The proposed approach employs an Arrival-Order Speaker Cache (AOSC) to store frame-level acoustic embeddings of previously observed speakers. Unlike conventional speaker-tracing buffers, AOSC orders embeddings by speaker index corresponding to their arrival time order, and is dynamically updated by selecting frames with the highest scores based on the model's past predictions. Notably, the number of stored embeddings per speaker is determined dynamically by the update mechanism, ensuring efficient cache utilization and precise speaker tracking. Experiments on benchmark datasets confirm the effectiveness and flexibility of our approach, even in low-latency setups. These results establish Streaming Sortformer as a robust solution for real-time multi-speaker tracking and a foundation for streaming multi-talker speech processing.

### NeuralDB: Scaling Knowledge Editing in LLMs to 100,000 Facts with Neural   KV Database
**Authors**: Weizhi Fei, Hao Shi, Jing Xu, Jingchen Peng, Jiazheng Li, Jingzhao Zhang, Bo Bai, Wei Han, Zhenyuan Chen, Xueyan Niu

**Updated**: 2025-07-24T02:00:09Z

**Summary**: Efficiently editing knowledge stored in large language models (LLMs) enables model updates without large-scale training. One possible solution is Locate-and-Edit (L\&E), allowing simultaneous modifications of a massive number of facts. However, such editing may compromise the general abilities of LLMs and even result in forgetting edited facts when scaling up to thousands of edits. In this paper, we model existing linear L\&E methods as querying a Key-Value (KV) database. From this perspective, we then propose NeuralDB, an editing framework that explicitly represents the edited facts as a neural KV database equipped with a non-linear gated retrieval module, % In particular, our gated module only operates when inference involves the edited facts, effectively preserving the general abilities of LLMs. Comprehensive experiments involving the editing of 10,000 facts were conducted on the ZsRE and CounterFacts datasets, using GPT2-XL, GPT-J (6B) and Llama-3 (8B). The results demonstrate that NeuralDB not only excels in editing efficacy, generalization, specificity, fluency, and consistency, but also preserves overall performance across six representative text understanding and generation tasks. Further experiments indicate that NeuralDB maintains its effectiveness even when scaled to 100,000 facts (\textbf{50x} more than in prior work).

**Updated**: 2025-07-23T17:57:09Z

**Summary**: Yume aims to use images, text, or videos to create an interactive, realistic, and dynamic world, which allows exploration and control using peripheral devices or neural signals. In this report, we present a preview version of \method, which creates a dynamic world from an input image and allows exploration of the world using keyboard actions. To achieve this high-fidelity and interactive video world generation, we introduce a well-designed framework, which consists of four main components, including camera motion quantization, video generation architecture, advanced sampler, and model acceleration. First, we quantize camera motions for stable training and user-friendly interaction using keyboard inputs. Then, we introduce the Masked Video Diffusion Transformer~(MVDT) with a memory module for infinite video generation in an autoregressive manner. After that, training-free Anti-Artifact Mechanism (AAM) and Time Travel Sampling based on Stochastic Differential Equations (TTS-SDE) are introduced to the sampler for better visual quality and more precise control. Moreover, we investigate model acceleration by synergistic optimization of adversarial distillation and caching mechanisms. We use the high-quality world exploration dataset \sekai to train \method, and it achieves remarkable results in diverse scenes and applications. All data, codebase, and model weights are available on https://github.com/stdstu12/YUME. Yume will update monthly to achieve its original goal.

### SHINE: A Scalable HNSW Index in Disaggregated Memory
**Authors**: Manuel Widmoser, Daniel Kocher, Nikolaus Augsten

**Updated**: 2025-07-23T16:09:10Z

**Summary**: Approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search is a fundamental problem in computer science for which in-memory graph-based methods, such as Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW), perform exceptionally well. To scale beyond billions of high-dimensional vectors, the index must be distributed. The disaggregated memory architecture physically separates compute and memory into two distinct hardware units and has become popular in modern data centers. Both units are connected via RDMA networks that allow compute nodes to directly access remote memory and perform all the computations, posing unique challenges for disaggregated indexes.   In this work, we propose a scalable HNSW index for ANN search in disaggregated memory. In contrast to existing distributed approaches, which partition the graph at the cost of accuracy, our method builds a graph-preserving index that reaches the same accuracy as a single-machine HNSW. Continuously fetching high-dimensional vector data from remote memory leads to severe network bandwidth limitations, which we overcome by employing an efficient caching mechanism. Since answering a single query involves processing numerous unique graph nodes, caching alone is not sufficient to achieve high scalability. We logically combine the caches of the compute nodes to increase the overall cache effectiveness and confirm the efficiency and scalability of our method in our evaluation.

### Toward a Lightweight and Robust Design for Caching
**Authors**: Peng Chen, Hailiang Zhao, Jiaji Zhang, Xueyan Tang, Yixuan Wang, Shuiguang Deng

**Updated**: 2025-07-23T15:59:38Z

**Summary**: The online caching problem aims to minimize cache misses when serving a sequence of requests under a limited cache size. While naive learning-augmented caching algorithms achieve ideal $1$-consistency, they lack robustness guarantees. Existing robustification methods either sacrifice $1$-consistency or introduce significant computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce Guard, a lightweight robustification framework that enhances the robustness of a broad class of learning-augmented caching algorithms to $2H_k + 2$, while preserving their $1$-consistency. Guard achieves the current best-known trade-off between consistency and robustness, with only $O(1)$ additional per-request overhead, thereby maintaining the original time complexity of the base algorithm. Extensive experiments across multiple real-world datasets and prediction models validate the effectiveness of Guard in practice.

### An h-space Based Adversarial Attack for Protection Against Few-shot   Personalization
**Authors**: Xide Xu, Sandesh Kamath, Muhammad Atif Butt, Bogdan Raducanu

**Updated**: 2025-07-23T14:43:22Z

**Summary**: The versatility of diffusion models in generating customized images from few samples raises significant privacy concerns, particularly regarding unauthorized modifications of private content. This concerning issue has renewed the efforts in developing protection mechanisms based on adversarial attacks, which generate effective perturbations to poison diffusion models. Our work is motivated by the observation that these models exhibit a high degree of abstraction within their semantic latent space (`h-space'), which encodes critical high-level features for generating coherent and meaningful content. In this paper, we propose a novel anti-customization approach, called HAAD (h-space based Adversarial Attack for Diffusion models), that leverages adversarial attacks to craft perturbations based on the h-space that can efficiently degrade the image generation process. Building upon HAAD, we further introduce a more efficient variant, HAAD-KV, that constructs perturbations solely based on the KV parameters of the h-space. This strategy offers a stronger protection, that is computationally less expensive. Despite their simplicity, our methods outperform state-of-the-art adversarial attacks, highlighting their effectiveness.

### AirCache: Activating Inter-modal Relevancy KV Cache Compression for   Efficient Large Vision-Language Model Inference
**Authors**: Kai Huang, Hao Zou, Bochen Wang, Ye Xi, Zhen Xie, Hao Wang

**Updated**: 2025-07-23T11:42:03Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) have gained significant attention due to their remarkable reasoning capabilities and proficiency in generalization. However, processing a large number of visual tokens and generating long-context outputs impose substantial computational overhead, leading to excessive demands for key-value (KV) cache. To address this critical bottleneck, we propose AirCache, a novel KV cache compression method aimed at accelerating LVLMs inference. This work systematically investigates the correlations between visual and textual tokens within the attention mechanisms of LVLMs. Our empirical analysis reveals considerable redundancy in cached visual tokens, wherein strategically eliminating these tokens preserves model performance while significantly accelerating context generation. Inspired by these findings, we introduce an elite observation window for assessing the importance of visual components in the KV cache, focusing on stable inter-modal relevancy modeling with enhanced multi-perspective consistency. Additionally, we develop an adaptive layer-wise budget allocation strategy that capitalizes on the strength and skewness of token importance distribution, showcasing superior efficiency compared to uniform allocation. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple LVLMs and benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves comparable performance to the full cache while retaining only 10% of visual KV cache, thereby reducing decoding latency by 29% to 66% across various batch size and prompt length of inputs. Notably, as cache retention rates decrease, our method exhibits increasing performance advantages over existing approaches.

### Multiprocessor Scheduling with Memory Constraints: Fundamental   Properties and Finding Optimal Solutions
**Authors**: Pál András Papp, Toni Böhnlein, A. N. Yzelman

**Updated**: 2025-07-23T11:12:08Z

**Summary**: We study the problem of scheduling a general computational DAG on multiple processors in a 2-level memory hierarchy. This setting is a natural generalization of several prominent models in the literature, and it simultaneously captures workload balancing, communication, and data movement due to cache size limitations. We first analyze the fundamental properties of this problem from a theoretical perspective, such as its computational complexity. We also prove that optimizing parallelization and memory management separately, as done in many applications, can result in a solution that is a linear factor away from the optimum.   On the algorithmic side, we discuss a natural technique to represent and solve the problem as an Integer Linear Program (ILP). We develop a holistic scheduling algorithm based on this approach, and we experimentally study its performance and properties on a small benchmark of computational tasks. Our results confirm that the ILP-based method can indeed find considerably better solutions than a baseline which combines classical scheduling algorithms and memory management policies.

**Authors**: Marco Barbisan, Marco Boldrin, Luca Cinnirella, Bruno Laterza, Alberto Maistrello, Lionello Marrelli, Federico Molon, Simone Peruzzo, Cesare Taliercio, Marco Valisa, Enrico Zampiva

**Updated**: 2025-07-23T10:10:53Z

**Summary**: Diagnostic Neutral Beam Injectors (DNBI), through the combined use of Charge Exchange Recombination Spectroscopy (CHERS) and Motional Stark effect diagnostics (MSE), are a well-known tool to access important information about magnetically confined plasmas, such as radial profiles of ion temperature, ion flow, impurity content and intensity and direction of the magnetic field. For this purpose, a DNBI was installed and operated in the RFX-mod experiment, which was designed to confine plasma mainly through the Reversed Field Pinch configuration. The DNBI, designed and built by the Budker Institute of Nuclear Physics (BINP), was based on a source of positive hydrogen ions, accelerated to 50 keV and for a maximum ion current of 5 A. The beam could be modulated and the maximum overall duration was 50 ms. With the upgrade of RFX-mod to the present RFX-mod2 machine, the DNBI is being renovated to solve several power units faults and improve the overall reliability of the system. The 50 kV power supply is being improved, as well as the power supplies in the high voltage deck and its insulation transformer. Magnetic field survival tests were performed on the toroidal-core-based DC-DC converters that should power the electronic boards in a reliable way. The control system, originally based on CAMAC technology, was redesigned to be fully replaced. This contribution reviews the technical criticalities emerged in the DNBI check-up and the new solutions adopted to make the DNBI operative and more reliable.

### Ironman: Accelerating Oblivious Transfer Extension for   Privacy-Preserving AI with Near-Memory Processing
**Authors**: Chenqi Lin, Kang Yang, Tianshi Xu, Ling Liang, Yufei Wang, Zhaohui Chen, Runsheng Wang, Mingyu Gao, Meng Li

**Updated**: 2025-07-23T09:31:01Z

**Summary**: With the wide application of machine learning (ML), privacy concerns arise with user data as they may contain sensitive information. Privacy-preserving ML (PPML) based on cryptographic primitives has emerged as a promising solution in which an ML model is directly computed on the encrypted data to provide a formal privacy guarantee. However, PPML frameworks heavily rely on the oblivious transfer (OT) primitive to compute nonlinear functions. OT mainly involves the computation of single-point correlated OT (SPCOT) and learning parity with noise (LPN) operations. As OT is still computed extensively on general-purpose CPUs, it becomes the latency bottleneck of modern PPML frameworks.   In this paper, we propose a novel OT accelerator, dubbed Ironman, to significantly increase the efficiency of OT and the overall PPML framework. We observe that SPCOT is computation-bounded, and thus propose a hardware-friendly SPCOT algorithm with a customized accelerator to improve SPCOT computation throughput. In contrast, LPN is memory-bandwidth-bounded due to irregular memory access patterns. Hence, we further leverage the near-memory processing (NMP) architecture equipped with memory-side cache and index sorting to improve effective memory bandwidth. With extensive experiments, we demonstrate Ironman achieves a 39.2-237.4 times improvement in OT throughput across different NMP configurations compared to the full-thread CPU implementation. For different PPML frameworks, Ironman demonstrates a 2.1-3.4 times reduction in end-to-end latency for both CNN and Transformer models.

### KVCache Cache in the Wild: Characterizing and Optimizing KVCache Cache   at a Large Cloud Provider
**Authors**: Jiahao Wang, Jinbo Han, Xingda Wei, Sijie Shen, Dingyan Zhang, Chenguang Fang, Rong Chen, Wenyuan Yu, Haibo Chen

**Updated**: 2025-07-23T08:07:19Z

**Summary**: Serving large language models (LLMs) is important for cloud providers, and caching intermediate results (KV\$) after processing each request substantially improves serving throughput and latency. However, there is limited understanding of how LLM serving benefits from KV\$ caching, where system design decisions like cache eviction policies are highly workload-dependent. In this paper, we present the first systematic characterization of the KV\$ workload patterns from one of the leading LLM service providers. We draw observations that were not covered by previous studies focusing on synthetic workloads, including: KV\$ reuses are skewed across requests, where reuses between single-turn requests are equally important as multi-turn requests; the reuse time and probability are diverse considering all requests, but for a specific request category, the pattern tends to be predictable; and the overall cache size required for an ideal cache hit ratio is moderate. Based on the characterization, we further propose a workload-aware cache eviction policy that improves the serving performance under real-world traces, especially with limited cache capacity.

### GTA: Grouped-head latenT Attention
**Authors**: Luoyang Sun, Cheng Deng, Jiwen Jiang, Xinjian Wu, Haifeng Zhang, Lei Chen, Lionel Ni, Jun Wang

**Updated**: 2025-07-23T05:57:32Z

**Summary**: Attention mechanisms underpin the success of large language models (LLMs), yet their substantial computational and memory overhead poses challenges for optimizing efficiency and performance. A critical bottleneck arises as KV cache and attention computations scale rapidly with text length, challenging deployment on hardware with limited computational and memory resources. We observe that attention mechanisms exhibit substantial redundancy, since the KV cache can be significantly compressed and attention maps across heads display high similarity, revealing that much of the computation and storage is unnecessary. Leveraging these insights, we propose \textbf{G}rouped-Head Laten\textbf{T} \textbf{A}ttention (GTA), a novel attention mechanism that reduces memory usage and computational complexity while maintaining performance. GTA comprises two components: (1) a shared attention map mechanism that reuses attention scores across multiple heads, decreasing the key cache size; and (2) a nonlinear value decoder with learned projections that compresses the value cache into a latent space, further cutting memory needs. GTA cuts attention computation FLOPs by up to \emph{62.5\%} versus Grouped-Query Attention and shrink the KV cache by up to \emph{70\%}, all while avoiding the extra overhead of Multi-Head Latent Attention to improve LLM deployment efficiency. Consequently, GTA models achieve a \emph{2x} increase in end-to-end inference speed, with prefill benefiting from reduced computational cost and decoding benefiting from the smaller cache footprint.

### Enabling Efficient Transaction Processing on CXL-Based Memory Sharing
**Authors**: Zhao Wang, Yiqi Chen, Cong Li, Dimin Niu, Tianchan Guan, Zhaoyang Du, Xingda Wei, Guangyu Sun

**Updated**: 2025-07-23T01:42:19Z

**Summary**: Transaction processing systems are the crux for modern data-center applications, yet current multi-node systems are slow due to network overheads. This paper advocates for Compute Express Link (CXL) as a network alternative, which enables low-latency and cache-coherent shared memory accesses. However, directly adopting standard CXL primitives leads to performance degradation due to the high cost of maintaining cross-node cache coherence. To address the CXL challenges, this paper introduces CtXnL, a software-hardware co-designed system that implements a novel hybrid coherence primitive tailored to the loosely coherent nature of transactional data. The core innovation of CtXnL is empowering transaction system developers with the ability to selectively achieve data coherence. Our evaluations on OLTP workloads demonstrate that CtXnL enhances performance, outperforming current network-based systems and achieves with up to 2.08x greater throughput than vanilla CXL memory sharing architectures across universal transaction processing policies.

### GATEBLEED: Exploiting On-Core Accelerator Power Gating for High   Performance & Stealthy Attacks on AI
**Authors**: Joshua Kalyanapu, Farshad Dizani, Darsh Asher, Azam Ghanbari, Rosario Cammarota, Aydin Aysu, Samira Mirbagher Ajorpaz

**Updated**: 2025-07-22T21:41:43Z

**Summary**: As power consumption from AI training and inference continues to increase, AI accelerators are being integrated directly into the CPU. Intel's Advanced Matrix Extensions (AMX) is one such example, debuting on the 4th generation Intel Xeon Scalable CPU. We discover a timing side and covert channel, GATEBLEED, caused by the aggressive power gating utilized to keep the CPU within operating limits. We show that the GATEBLEED side channel is a threat to AI privacy as many ML models such as transformers and CNNs make critical computationally-heavy decisions based on private values like confidence thresholds and routing logits. Timing delays from selective powering down of AMX components mean that each matrix multiplication is a potential leakage point when executed on the AMX accelerator. Our research identifies over a dozen potential gadgets across popular ML libraries (HuggingFace, PyTorch, TensorFlow, etc.), revealing that they can leak sensitive and private information. GATEBLEED poses a risk for local and remote timing inference, even under previous protective measures. GATEBLEED can be used as a high performance, stealthy remote covert channel and a generic magnifier for timing transmission channels, capable of bypassing traditional cache defenses to leak arbitrary memory addresses and evading state of the art microarchitectural attack detectors under realistic network conditions and system configurations in which previous attacks fail. We implement an end-to-end microarchitectural inference attack on a transformer model optimized with Intel AMX, achieving a membership inference accuracy of 81% and a precision of 0.89. In a CNN-based or transformer-based mixture-of-experts model optimized with Intel AMX, we leak expert choice with 100% accuracy.

### StreamME: Simplify 3D Gaussian Avatar within Live Stream
**Authors**: Luchuan Song, Yang Zhou, Zhan Xu, Yi Zhou, Deepali Aneja, Chenliang Xu

**Updated**: 2025-07-22T21:33:30Z

**Summary**: We propose StreamME, a method focuses on fast 3D avatar reconstruction. The StreamME synchronously records and reconstructs a head avatar from live video streams without any pre-cached data, enabling seamless integration of the reconstructed appearance into downstream applications. This exceptionally fast training strategy, which we refer to as on-the-fly training, is central to our approach. Our method is built upon 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), eliminating the reliance on MLPs in deformable 3DGS and relying solely on geometry, which significantly improves the adaptation speed to facial expression. To further ensure high efficiency in on-the-fly training, we introduced a simplification strategy based on primary points, which distributes the point clouds more sparsely across the facial surface, optimizing points number while maintaining rendering quality. Leveraging the on-the-fly training capabilities, our method protects the facial privacy and reduces communication bandwidth in VR system or online conference. Additionally, it can be directly applied to downstream application such as animation, toonify, and relighting. Please refer to our project page for more details: https://songluchuan.github.io/StreamME/.

### SiLQ: Simple Large Language Model Quantization-Aware Training
**Authors**: Steven K. Esser, Jeffrey L. McKinstry, Deepika Bablani, Rathinakumar Appuswamy, Dharmendra S. Modha

**Updated**: 2025-07-22T18:17:53Z

**Summary**: Large language models can be quantized to reduce inference time latency, model size, and energy consumption, thereby delivering a better user experience at lower cost. A challenge exists to deliver quantized models with minimal loss of accuracy in reasonable time, and in particular to do so without requiring mechanisms incompatible with specialized inference accelerators. Here, we demonstrate a simple, end-to-end quantization-aware training approach that, with an increase in total model training budget of less than 0.1%, outperforms the leading published quantization methods by large margins on several modern benchmarks, with both base and instruct model variants. The approach easily generalizes across different model architectures, can be applied to activations, cache, and weights, and requires the introduction of no additional operations to the model other than the quantization itself.

### Beyond Context Limits: Subconscious Threads for Long-Horizon Reasoning
**Authors**: Hongyin Luo, Nathaniel Morgan, Tina Li, Derek Zhao, Ai Vy Ngo, Philip Schroeder, Lijie Yang, Assaf Ben-Kish, Jack O'Brien, James Glass

**Updated**: 2025-07-22T17:30:04Z

**Summary**: To break the context limits of large language models (LLMs) that bottleneck reasoning accuracy and efficiency, we propose the Thread Inference Model (TIM), a family of LLMs trained for recursive and decompositional problem solving, and TIMRUN, an inference runtime enabling long-horizon structured reasoning beyond context limits. Together, TIM hosted on TIMRUN supports virtually unlimited working memory and multi-hop tool calls within a single language model inference, overcoming output limits, positional-embedding constraints, and GPU-memory bottlenecks. Performance is achieved by modeling natural language as reasoning trees measured by both length and depth instead of linear sequences. The reasoning trees consist of tasks with thoughts, recursive subtasks, and conclusions based on the concept we proposed in Schroeder et al, 2025. During generation, we maintain a working memory that retains only the key-value states of the most relevant context tokens, selected by a rule-based subtask-pruning mechanism, enabling reuse of positional embeddings and GPU memory pages throughout reasoning. Experimental results show that our system sustains high inference throughput, even when manipulating up to 90% of the KV cache in GPU memory. It also delivers accurate reasoning on mathematical tasks and handles information retrieval challenges that require long-horizon reasoning and multi-hop tool use.

### WGRAMMAR: Leverage Prior Knowledge to Accelerate Structured Decoding
**Authors**: Ran Wang, Xiaoxuan Liu, Hao Ren, Gang Chen, Fanchao Qi, Maosong Sun

**Updated**: 2025-07-22T17:13:47Z

**Summary**: Structured decoding enables large language models (LLMs) to generate outputs in formats required by downstream systems, such as HTML or JSON. However, existing methods suffer from efficiency bottlenecks due to grammar compilation, state tracking, and mask creation. We observe that many real-world tasks embed strong prior knowledge about output structure. Leveraging this, we propose a decomposition of constraints into static and dynamic components -- precompiling static structures offline and instantiating dynamic arguments at runtime using grammar snippets. Instead of relying on pushdown automata, we employ a compositional set of operators to model regular formats, achieving lower transition latency. We introduce wgrammar, a lightweight decoding engine that integrates domain-aware simplification, constraint decomposition, and mask caching, achieving up to 250x speedup over existing systems. wgrammar's source code is publicly available at https://github.com/wrran/wgrammar.

### Hydra: Virtualized Multi-Language Runtime for High-Density Serverless   Platforms
**Authors**: Serhii Ivanenko, Vasyl Lanko, Rudi Horn, Vojin Jovanovic, Rodrigo Bruno

**Updated**: 2025-07-22T16:49:24Z

**Summary**: Serverless is an attractive computing model that offers seamless scalability and elasticity; it takes the infrastructure management burden away from users and enables a pay-as-you-use billing model. As a result, serverless is becoming increasingly popular to support highly elastic and bursty workloads. However, existing platforms are supported by bloated virtualization stacks, which, combined with bursty and irregular invocations, lead to high memory and latency overheads.   To reduce the virtualization stack bloat, we propose Hydra, a virtualized multi-language runtime and platform capable of hosting multiple sandboxes running concurrently. To fully leverage Hydra's virtualized runtime, we revisit the existing serverless platform design to make it colocation-aware across owners and functions, and to feature a caching layer of pre-allocated Hydra instances that can be used by different functions written in different languages to reduce cold starts. We also propose a snapshotting mechanism to checkpoint and restore individual sandboxes.   By consolidating multiple serverless function invocations through Hydra, we improve the overall function density (ops/GB-sec) by 2.41x on average compared to OpenWhisk runtimes, the state-of-the-art single-language runtimes used in most serverless platforms, and by 1.43x on average compared to Knative runtimes supporting invocation colocation within the same function. When reproducing the Azure Functions trace, our serverless platform operating Hydra instances reduces the overall memory footprint by 21.3-43.9% compared to operating OpenWhisk instances and by 14.5-30% compared to operating Knative instances. Hydra eliminates cold starts thanks to the pool of pre-warmed runtime instances, reducing p99 latency by 45.3-375.5x compared to OpenWhisk and by 1.9-51.4x compared to Knative.

### Genus Zero Kashiwara-Vergne Solutions from Braids
**Authors**: Zsuzsanna Dancso, Iva Halacheva, Guillaume Laplante-Anfossi, Marcy Robertson, Chandan Singh

**Updated**: 2025-07-22T05:34:03Z

**Summary**: Using the language of moperads-monoids in the category of right modules over an operad-we reinterpret the Alekseev-Enriquez-Torossian construction of Kashiwara-Vergne (KV) solutions from associators. We show that any isomorphism between the moperad of parenthesized braids with a frozen strand and the moperad of chord diagrams gives rise to a family of genus zero KV solutions operadically generated by a single classical KV solution. We show that the Grothendieck-Teichm\"uller module groups act on the latter, intertwining the actions of the KV symmetry groups. In the other direction, we show that any symmetric KV solution gives rise to a morphism from the moperad of parenthesized braids with a frozen strand to the moperad of tangential automorphisms of free Lie algebras. This morphism factors through the moperad of chord diagrams if and only if the associated KV associator is a Drinfeld associator.

### Towards Compute-Optimal Many-Shot In-Context Learning
**Authors**: Shahriar Golchin, Yanfei Chen, Rujun Han, Manan Gandhi, Tianli Yu, Swaroop Mishra, Mihai Surdeanu, Rishabh Agarwal, Chen-Yu Lee, Tomas Pfister

**Updated**: 2025-07-22T04:21:03Z

**Summary**: Long-context large language models (LLMs) are able to process inputs containing up to several million tokens. In the scope of in-context learning (ICL), this translates into using hundreds/thousands of demonstrations in the input prompt, enabling many-shot ICL. In practice, a fixed set of demonstrations is often selected at random in many-shot settings due to (1) high inference costs, (2) the benefits of caching and reusing computations, and (3) the similar performance offered by this strategy compared to others when scaled. In this work, we propose two straightforward strategies for demonstration selection in many-shot ICL that improve performance with minimal computational overhead. Our first method combines a small number of demonstrations, selected based on their similarity to each test sample, with a disproportionately larger set of random demonstrations that are cached. The second strategy improves the first by replacing random demonstrations with those selected using centroids derived from test sample representations via k-means clustering. Our experiments with Gemini Pro and Flash across several datasets indicate that our strategies consistently outperform random selection and surpass or match the most performant selection approach while supporting caching and reducing inference cost by up to an order of magnitude. We also show that adjusting the proportion of demonstrations selected based on different criteria can balance performance and inference cost in many-shot ICL.

### Dissecting the NVIDIA Blackwell Architecture with Microbenchmarks
**Authors**: Aaron Jarmusch, Nathan Graddon, Sunita Chandrasekaran

**Updated**: 2025-07-21T19:31:37Z

**Summary**: The rapid development in scientific research provides a need for more compute power, which is partly being solved by GPUs. This paper presents a microarchitectural analysis of the modern NVIDIA Blackwell architecture by studying GPU performance   features with thought through microbenchmarks. We unveil key subsystems, including the memory hierarchy, SM execution   pipelines, and the SM sub-core units, including the 5th generation tensor cores supporting FP4 and FP6 precisions.   To understand the different key features of the NVIDIA GPU, we study latency, throughput, cache behavior, and scheduling   details, revealing subtle tuning metrics in the design of Blackwell. To develop a comprehensive analysis, we compare the   Blackwell architecture with the previous Hopper architecture by using the GeForce RTX 5080 and H100 PCIe, respectively. We   evaluate and compare results, presenting both generational improvements and performance regressions. Additionally, we   investigate the role of power efficiency and energy consumption under varied workloads. Our findings provide actionable insights   for application developers, compiler writers, and performance engineers to optimize workloads on Blackwell-based platforms,   and contribute new data to the growing research on GPU architectures.

### Per-Bank Bandwidth Regulation of Shared Last-Level Cache for Real-Time   Systems
**Authors**: Connor Sullivan, Alex Manley, Mohammad Alian, Heechul Yun

**Updated**: 2025-07-21T19:05:01Z

**Summary**: Modern commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) multicore processors have advanced memory hierarchies that enhance memory-level parallelism (MLP), which is crucial for high performance. To support high MLP, shared last-level caches (LLCs) are divided into multiple banks, allowing parallel access. However, uneven distribution of cache requests from the cores, especially when requests from multiple cores are concentrated on a single bank, can result in significant contention affecting all cores that access the cache. Such cache bank contention can even be maliciously induced -- known as cache bank-aware denial-of-service (DoS) attacks -- in order to jeopardize the system's timing predictability.   In this paper, we propose a per-bank bandwidth regulation approach for multi-banked shared LLC based multicore real-time systems. By regulating bandwidth on a per-bank basis, the approach aims to prevent unnecessary throttling of cache accesses to non-contended banks, thus improving overall performance (throughput) without compromising isolation benefits of throttling. We implement our approach on a RISC-V system-on-chip (SoC) platform using FireSim and evaluate extensively using both synthetic and real-world workloads. Our evaluation results show that the proposed per-bank regulation approach effectively protects real-time tasks from co-running cache bank-aware DoS attacks, and offers up to a 3.66$\times$ performance improvement for the throttled benign best-effort tasks compared to prior bank-oblivious bandwidth throttling approaches.

### An Efficient Frequency-Based Approach for Maximal Square Detection in   Binary Matrices
**Authors**: Swastik Bhandari

**Updated**: 2025-07-21T14:50:41Z

**Summary**: Detecting maximal square submatrices of ones in binary matrices is a fundamental problem with applications in computer vision and pattern recognition. While the standard dynamic programming (DP) solution achieves optimal asymptotic complexity, its practical performance suffers from repeated minimum operations and inefficient memory access patterns that degrade cache utilization. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel frequency-based algorithm that employs a greedy approach to track the columnar continuity of ones through an adaptive frequency array and a dynamic thresholding mechanism. Extensive benchmarking demonstrates that the frequency-based algorithm achieves faster performance than the standard DP in 100% of test cases with an average speedup of 3.32x, a maximum speedup of 4.60x, and a minimum speedup of 2.31x across matrices up to 5000x5000 with densities from 0.1 to 0.9. The algorithm's average speedup exceeds 2.5x for all densities and rises to over 3.5x for densities of 0.7 and higher across all matrix sizes. These results demonstrate that the frequency-based approach is a superior alternative to standard DP and opens new possibilities for efficient matrix analysis in performance-critical applications.

### Mixture-of-Recursions: Learning Dynamic Recursive Depths for Adaptive   Token-Level Computation
**Authors**: Sangmin Bae, Yujin Kim, Reza Bayat, Sungnyun Kim, Jiyoun Ha, Tal Schuster, Adam Fisch, Hrayr Harutyunyan, Ziwei Ji, Aaron Courville, Se-Young Yun

**Updated**: 2025-07-21T07:45:14Z

**Summary**: Scaling language models unlocks impressive capabilities, but the accompanying computational and memory demands make both training and deployment expensive. Existing efficiency efforts typically target either parameter sharing or adaptive computation, leaving open the question of how to attain both simultaneously. We introduce Mixture-of-Recursions (MoR), a unified framework that combines the two axes of efficiency inside a single Recursive Transformer. MoR reuses a shared stack of layers across recursion steps to achieve parameter efficiency, while lightweight routers enable adaptive token-level thinking by dynamically assigning different recursion depths to individual tokens. This allows MoR to focus quadratic attention computation only among tokens still active at a given recursion depth, further improving memory access efficiency by selectively caching only their key-value pairs. Beyond these core mechanisms, we also propose a KV sharing variant that reuses KV pairs from the first recursion, specifically designed to decrease prefill latency and memory footprint. Across model scales ranging from 135M to 1.7B parameters, MoR forms a new Pareto frontier: at equal training FLOPs and smaller model sizes, it significantly lowers validation perplexity and improves few-shot accuracy, while delivering higher throughput compared with vanilla and existing recursive baselines. These gains demonstrate that MoR is an effective path towards large-model quality without incurring large-model cost.

### Lizard: An Efficient Linearization Framework for Large Language Models
**Authors**: Chien Van Nguyen, Ruiyi Zhang, Hanieh Deilamsalehy, Puneet Mathur, Viet Dac Lai, Haoliang Wang, Jayakumar Subramanian, Ryan A. Rossi, Trung Bui, Nikos Vlassis, Franck Dernoncourt, Thien Huu Nguyen

**Updated**: 2025-07-20T03:49:03Z

**Summary**: We propose Lizard, a linearization framework that transforms pretrained Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) into flexible, subquadratic architectures for infinite-context generation. Transformer-based LLMs face significant memory and computational bottlenecks as context lengths increase, due to the quadratic complexity of softmax attention and the growing key-value (KV) cache. Lizard addresses these limitations by introducing a subquadratic attention mechanism that closely approximates softmax attention while preserving the output quality. Unlike previous linearization methods, which are often limited by fixed model structures and therefore exclude gating mechanisms, Lizard incorporates a gating module inspired by recent state-of-the-art linear models. This enables adaptive memory control, supports constant-memory inference, offers strong length generalization, and allows more flexible model design. Lizard combines gated linear attention for global context compression with sliding window attention enhanced by meta memory, forming a hybrid mechanism that captures both long-range dependencies and fine-grained local interactions. Moreover, we introduce a hardware-aware algorithm that accelerates the training speed of our models. Extensive experiments show that Lizard achieves near-lossless recovery of the teacher model's performance across standard language modeling tasks, while significantly outperforming previous linearization methods. On the 5-shot MMLU benchmark, Lizard improves over prior models by 18 points and shows significant improvements on associative recall tasks.

### Dynamic Context Tuning for Retrieval-Augmented Generation: Enhancing   Multi-Turn Planning and Tool Adaptation
**Authors**: Jubin Abhishek Soni, Amit Anand, Rajesh Kumar Pandey, Aniket Abhishek Soni

**Updated**: 2025-07-19T17:46:19Z

**Summary**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has significantly advanced large language models (LLMs) by grounding their outputs in external tools and knowledge sources. However, existing RAG systems are typically constrained to static, single-turn interactions with fixed toolsets, making them ill-suited for dynamic domains such as healthcare and smart homes, where user intent, available tools, and contextual factors evolve over time. We present Dynamic Context Tuning (DCT), a lightweight framework that extends RAG to support multi-turn dialogue and evolving tool environments without requiring retraining. DCT integrates an attention-based context cache to track relevant past information, LoRA-based retrieval to dynamically select domain-specific tools, and efficient context compression to maintain inputs within LLM context limits. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks show that DCT improves plan accuracy by 14% and reduces hallucinations by 37%, while matching GPT-4 performance at significantly lower cost. Furthermore, DCT generalizes to previously unseen tools, enabling scalable and adaptable AI assistants across a wide range of dynamic environments.

### Caching Techniques for Reducing the Communication Cost of Federated   Learning in IoT Environments
**Authors**: Ahmad Alhonainy, Praveen Rao

**Updated**: 2025-07-19T17:02:15Z

**Summary**: Federated Learning (FL) allows multiple distributed devices to jointly train a shared model without centralizing data, but communication cost remains a major bottleneck, especially in resource-constrained environments. This paper introduces caching strategies - FIFO, LRU, and Priority-Based - to reduce unnecessary model update transmissions. By selectively forwarding significant updates, our approach lowers bandwidth usage while maintaining model accuracy. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and medical datasets show reduced communication with minimal accuracy loss. Results confirm that intelligent caching improves scalability, memory efficiency, and supports reliable FL in edge IoT networks, making it practical for deployment in smart cities, healthcare, and other latency-sensitive applications.

### KVLink: Accelerating Large Language Models via Efficient KV Cache Reuse
**Authors**: Jingbo Yang, Bairu Hou, Wei Wei, Yujia Bao, Shiyu Chang

**Updated**: 2025-07-19T07:41:03Z

**Summary**: We describe KVLink, an approach for efficient key-value (KV) cache reuse in large language models (LLMs). In many LLM applications, different inputs can share overlapping context, such as the same retrieved document appearing in multiple queries. However, the LLMs still need to encode the entire context for each query, leading to redundant computation. In this paper, we investigate a new strategy to eliminate such inefficiency, where the KV cache of each document is precomputed independently. During inference, the KV caches of retrieved documents are concatenated, allowing the model to reuse cached representations instead of recomputing them. To mitigate the performance degradation when using KV caches computed independently for each document, KVLink introduces two key techniques: adjusting positional embeddings of the KV cache at inference to match the global position after concatenation, and using trainable special tokens to restore self-attention across independently encoded documents. Experiments across 7 datasets demonstrate that KVLink improves question answering accuracy by an average of 4% over state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, by leveraging precomputed KV caches, our approach reduces time-to-first-token by up to 96% compared to standard LLM inference, making it a scalable and efficient solution for context reuse. Additionally, KVLink can be combined with KV cache compression to further save cache loading and storage overhead while outperforming the baselines.

 ### Stochastic Taylor expansion via Poisson point processes
**Authors**: Weichao Wu, Athanasios C. Micheas

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T17:59:50Z

**Summary**: We generalize Taylor's theorem by introducing a stochastic formulation based on an underlying Poisson point process model. We utilize this approach to propose a novel non-linear regression framework and perform statistical inference of the model parameters. Theoretical properties of the proposed estimator are also proven, including its convergence, uniformly almost surely, to the true function. The theory is presented for the univariate and multivariate cases, and we exemplify the proposed methodology using several examples via simulations and an application to stock market data.

### FaST: Feature-aware Sampling and Tuning for Personalized Preference   Alignment with Limited Data
**Authors**: Thibaut Thonet, Germán Kruszewski, Jos Rozen, Pierre Erbacher, Marc Dymetman

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T17:58:26Z

**Summary**: LLM-powered conversational assistants are often deployed in a one-size-fits-all manner, which fails to accommodate individual user preferences. Recently, LLM personalization -- tailoring models to align with specific user preferences -- has gained increasing attention as a way to bridge this gap. In this work, we specifically focus on a practical yet challenging setting where only a small set of preference annotations can be collected per user -- a problem we define as Personalized Preference Alignment with Limited Data (PPALLI). To support research in this area, we introduce two datasets -- DnD and ELIP -- and benchmark a variety of alignment techniques on them. We further propose FaST, a highly parameter-efficient approach that leverages high-level features automatically discovered from the data, achieving the best overall performance.

### The Role of r-Modes in Pulsar Spin-down, Pulsar Timing, and   Gravitational Waves
**Authors**: Xiyuan Li, Shahram Abbassi, Varenya Upadhyaya, Xiyang Zhang, S. R. Valluri

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T17:57:46Z

**Summary**: We investigate the role of r-mode oscillations in pulsar spin-down and their implications for gravitational wave emission and pulsar timing analysis. Using a non-linear differential framework that includes r-mode contributions, we derive time-dependent solutions for rotational frequency and period evolution. These expressions are validated using observational data from the Crab pulsar with high precision. By analytically fitting braking indices and spin-down coefficients, we link measurable pulsar properties to gravitational wave signatures. Furthermore, we present closed-form expressions for neutron star compactness and tidal deformability using Lambert W and Lambert-Tsallis functions, enabling model-independent inferences from r-mode gravitational wave frequencies. Our results show that incorporating r-modes significantly improves the accuracy of spin-down models and continuous wave detectability, particularly through the inclusion of high-order frequency terms. This framework supports the modeling of timing residuals, glitch quantification, and gravitational wave constraints. Our findings have direct relevance for data analysis in ongoing and future gravitational wave observatories.

### Aligning Human and LLM Judgments: Insights from EvalAssist on   Task-Specific Evaluations and AI-assisted Assessment Strategy Preferences
**Authors**: Zahra Ashktorab, Michael Desmond, Qian Pan, James M. Johnson, Martin Santillan Cooper, Elizabeth M. Daly, Rahul Nair, Tejaswini Pedapati, Hyo Jin Do, Werner Geyer

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T17:57:01Z

**Summary**: Evaluation of large language model (LLM) outputs requires users to make critical judgments about the best outputs across various configurations. This process is costly and takes time given the large amounts of data. LLMs are increasingly used as evaluators to filter training data, evaluate model performance or assist human evaluators with detailed assessments. To support this process, effective front-end tools are critical for evaluation. Two common approaches for using LLMs as evaluators are direct assessment and pairwise comparison. In our study with machine learning practitioners (n=15), each completing 6 tasks yielding 131 evaluations, we explore how task-related factors and assessment strategies influence criteria refinement and user perceptions. Findings show that users performed more evaluations with direct assessment by making criteria task-specific, modifying judgments, and changing the evaluator model. We conclude with recommendations for how systems can better support interactions in LLM-assisted evaluations.

### Harnessing Large Language Models for Group POI Recommendations
**Authors**: Jing Long, Liang Qu, Junliang Yu, Tong Chen, Quoc Viet Hung Nguyen, Hongzhi Yin

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T17:45:47Z

**Summary**: The rapid proliferation of Location-Based Social Networks (LBSNs) has underscored the importance of Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation systems in enhancing user experiences. While individual POI recommendation methods leverage users' check-in histories to provide personalized suggestions, they struggle to address scenarios requiring group decision-making. Group POI recommendation systems aim to satisfy the collective preferences of multiple users, but existing approaches face two major challenges: diverse group preferences and extreme data sparsity in group check-in data. To overcome these challenges, we propose LLMGPR, a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) for group POI recommendations. LLMGPR introduces semantic-enhanced POI tokens and incorporates rich contextual information to model the diverse and complex dynamics of group decision-making. To further enhance its capabilities, we developed a sequencing adapter using Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA), which aligns LLMs with group POI recommendation tasks. To address the issue of sparse group check-in data, LLMGPR employs an aggregation adapter that integrates individual representations into meaningful group representations. Additionally, a self-supervised learning (SSL) task is designed to predict the purposes of check-in sequences (e.g., business trips and family vacations), thereby enriching group representations with deeper semantic insights. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of LLMGPR, showcasing its ability to significantly enhance the accuracy and robustness of group POI recommendations.

### MisVisFix: An Interactive Dashboard for Detecting, Explaining, and   Correcting Misleading Visualizations using Large Language Models
**Authors**: Amit Kumar Das, Klaus Mueller

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T17:45:11Z

**Summary**: Misleading visualizations pose a significant challenge to accurate data interpretation. While recent research has explored the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for detecting such misinformation, practical tools that also support explanation and correction remain limited. We present MisVisFix, an interactive dashboard that leverages both Claude and GPT models to support the full workflow of detecting, explaining, and correcting misleading visualizations. MisVisFix correctly identifies 96% of visualization issues and addresses all 74 known visualization misinformation types, classifying them as major, minor, or potential concerns. It provides detailed explanations, actionable suggestions, and automatically generates corrected charts. An interactive chat interface allows users to ask about specific chart elements or request modifications. The dashboard adapts to newly emerging misinformation strategies through targeted user interactions. User studies with visualization experts and developers of fact-checking tools show that MisVisFix accurately identifies issues and offers useful suggestions for improvement. By transforming LLM-based detection into an accessible, interactive platform, MisVisFix advances visualization literacy and supports more trustworthy data communication.

### GeRe: Towards Efficient Anti-Forgetting in Continual Learning of LLM via   General Samples Replay
**Authors**: Yunan Zhang, Shuoran Jiang, Mengchen Zhao, Yuefeng Li, Yang Fan, Xiangping Wu, Qingcai Chen

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T17:42:22Z

**Summary**: The continual learning capability of large language models (LLMs) is crucial for advancing artificial general intelligence. However, continual fine-tuning LLMs across various domains often suffers from catastrophic forgetting, characterized by: 1) significant forgetting of their general capabilities, and 2) sharp performance declines in previously learned tasks. To simultaneously address both issues in a simple yet stable manner, we propose General Sample Replay (GeRe), a framework that use usual pretraining texts for efficient anti-forgetting. Beyond revisiting the most prevalent replay-based practices under GeRe, we further leverage neural states to introduce a enhanced activation states constrained optimization method using threshold-based margin (TM) loss, which maintains activation state consistency during replay learning. We are the first to validate that a small, fixed set of pre-collected general replay samples is sufficient to resolve both concerns--retaining general capabilities while promoting overall performance across sequential tasks. Indeed, the former can inherently facilitate the latter. Through controlled experiments, we systematically compare TM with different replay strategies under the GeRe framework, including vanilla label fitting, logit imitation via KL divergence and feature imitation via L1/L2 losses. Results demonstrate that TM consistently improves performance and exhibits better robustness. Our work paves the way for efficient replay of LLMs for the future. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/Qznan/GeRe.

### Adaptive Audio-Visual Speech Recognition via Matryoshka-Based Multimodal   LLMs
**Authors**: Umberto Cappellazzo, Minsu Kim, Stavros Petridis

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T17:41:48Z

**Summary**: Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) leverages audio and visual modalities to improve robustness in noisy environments. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) show strong performance in speech recognition, including AVSR. However, the long speech representations lead to high computational costs for LLMs. Prior methods compress inputs before feeding them to LLMs, but high compression often harms accuracy. To address this, we propose Llama-MTSK, the first Matryoshka-based Multimodal LLM for AVSR, which flexibly adapts audio-visual token allocation under varying compute constraints. Inspired by Matryoshka Representation Learning, our model encodes representations at multiple granularities with a single architecture, avoiding the need for separate models. For efficient fine-tuning, we introduce three LoRA-based strategies using global and scale-specific modules. Evaluations on major AVSR datasets show Llama-MTSK matches or outperforms models trained at fixed compression levels.

### Water Detection in the Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS
**Authors**: Zexi Xing, Shawn Oset, John Noonan, Dennis Bodewits

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T17:41:44Z

**Summary**: We report the first detection of water activity in the third confirmed interstellar object, 3I/ATLAS, based on ultraviolet imaging with the \emph{Neil Gehrels-Swift Observatory}. Observations acquired with the Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope on 2025 July 31st - Aug 1st revealed OH (A$^2\Sigma$ -- X$^2\Pi$) emission near 3085~\AA. The water production rate results highly depend on the reddening assumption. For a reddening of 38.6\% between 5437.8~\AA\ and 3325.7~\AA, the water production rate is $(1.35 \pm 0.27) \times 10^{27} $ molecules\,s$^{-1}$ (40~kg\,s$^{-1}$) at a heliocentric distance of 3.51~au. This places 3I/ATLAS among the few comets with confirmed OH emission beyond 3~au, where water ice sublimation is typically inefficient. The inferred production rate is consistent with an active area of at least 19~km$^2$, assuming equilibrium sublimation. Based on current upper limits of the nucleus' radius, this requires that over 20\% of the surface is active, which is larger than activity levels observed in most solar system comets. Contemporaneous near-infrared spectroscopy indicates the presence of large icy grains in the coma, which may serve as an extended source of water vapor. The detection of OH emission prior to any CN detection is unusual and may reflect differences in grain-driven outgassing or volatile inventory compared to typical comets. While similar behavior has been observed in solar system comets, the mechanisms controlling distant activity and the storage and release of volatiles remain poorly understood. If 3I/ATLAS' coma continues to be dominated by H$_2$O, supporting the early and low-metallicity formation hypothesis, the derived large size of the nucleus could be indicative of a key knowledge gap in low-metallicity system planetesimal formation and loss mechanisms.

### Sculptor: Empowering LLMs with Cognitive Agency via Active Context   Management
**Authors**: Mo Li, L. H. Xu, Qitai Tan, Ting Cao, Yunxin Liu

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T17:32:58Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from significant performance degradation when processing long contexts due to proactive interference, where irrelevant information in earlier parts of the context disrupts reasoning and memory recall. While most research focuses on external memory systems to augment LLMs' capabilities, we propose a complementary approach: empowering LLMs with Active Context Management (ACM) tools to actively sculpt their internal working memory. We introduce Sculptor, a framework that equips LLMs with three categories of tools: (1) context fragmentation, (2) summary, hide, and restore, and (3) intelligent search. Our approach enables LLMs to proactively manage their attention and working memory, analogous to how humans selectively focus on relevant information while filtering out distractions. Experimental evaluation on information-sparse benchmarks-PI-LLM (proactive interference) and NeedleBench Multi-Needle Reasoning-demonstrates that Sculptor significantly improves performance even without specific training, leveraging LLMs' inherent tool calling generalization capabilities. By enabling Active Context Management, Sculptor not only mitigates proactive interference but also provides a cognitive foundation for more reliable reasoning across diverse long-context tasks-highlighting that explicit context-control strategies, rather than merely larger token windows, are key to robustness at scale.

### HierarchicalPrune: Position-Aware Compression for Large-Scale Diffusion   Models
**Authors**: Young D. Kwon, Rui Li, Sijia Li, Da Li, Sourav Bhattacharya, Stylianos I. Venieris

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T17:30:44Z

**Summary**: State-of-the-art text-to-image diffusion models (DMs) achieve remarkable quality, yet their massive parameter scale (8-11B) poses significant challenges for inferences on resource-constrained devices. In this paper, we present HierarchicalPrune, a novel compression framework grounded in a key observation: DM blocks exhibit distinct functional hierarchies, where early blocks establish semantic structures while later blocks handle texture refinements. HierarchicalPrune synergistically combines three techniques: (1) Hierarchical Position Pruning, which identifies and removes less essential later blocks based on position hierarchy; (2) Positional Weight Preservation, which systematically protects early model portions that are essential for semantic structural integrity; and (3) Sensitivity-Guided Distillation, which adjusts knowledge-transfer intensity based on our discovery of block-wise sensitivity variations. As a result, our framework brings billion-scale diffusion models into a range more suitable for on-device inference, while preserving the quality of the output images. Specifically, when combined with INT4 weight quantisation, HierarchicalPrune achieves 77.5-80.4% memory footprint reduction (e.g., from 15.8 GB to 3.2 GB) and 27.9-38.0% latency reduction, measured on server and consumer grade GPUs, with the minimum drop of 2.6% in GenEval score and 7% in HPSv2 score compared to the original model. Last but not least, our comprehensive user study with 85 participants demonstrates that HierarchicalPrune maintains perceptual quality comparable to the original model while significantly outperforming prior works.

**Summary**: The rise of scaled-out LLMs and scaled-up SuperPods signals a new era in large-scale AI infrastructure. LLMs continue to scale out via MoE, as seen in recent models like DeepSeek, Kimi, and Qwen. In parallel, AI hardware is scaling up, with Huawei's CloudMatrix384 SuperPod offering hundreds of GB/s high-speed interconnects. Running large MoE models on SuperPod-scale hardware brings new challenges. It requires new execution models, scalable scheduling, efficient expert load balancing, and elimination of single points of failure. This paper presents xDeepServe, Huawei Cloud's LLM serving system designed for SuperPod-scale infrastructure. At its core is Transformerless, a disaggregated architecture that decomposes transformer models into modular units--attention, feedforward, and MoE--executed independently on NPUs connected via high-speed fabric. We implement this design in two forms: disaggregated prefill-decode and disaggregated MoE-attention. This fully disaggregated setup enables independent scaling of compute and memory without sacrificing performance. To support this architecture, we propose XCCL, a communication library that leverages CloudMatrix384's global shared memory to implement efficient point-to-point and all-to-all primitives. We also extend our serving engine FlowServe with system-level techniques, enabling scalable inference across hundreds of NPUs.

### X-SAM: From Segment Anything to Any Segmentation
**Authors**: Hao Wang, Limeng Qiao, Zequn Jie, Zhijian Huang, Chengjian Feng, Qingfang Zheng, Lin Ma, Xiangyuan Lan, Xiaodan Liang

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T17:19:10Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in broad knowledge representation, yet they are inherently deficient in pixel-level perceptual understanding. Although the Segment Anything Model (SAM) represents a significant advancement in visual-prompt-driven image segmentation, it exhibits notable limitations in multi-mask prediction and category-specific segmentation tasks, and it cannot integrate all segmentation tasks within a unified model architecture. To address these limitations, we present X-SAM, a streamlined Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) framework that extends the segmentation paradigm from \textit{segment anything} to \textit{any segmentation}. Specifically, we introduce a novel unified framework that enables more advanced pixel-level perceptual comprehension for MLLMs. Furthermore, we propose a new segmentation task, termed Visual GrounDed (VGD) segmentation, which segments all instance objects with interactive visual prompts and empowers MLLMs with visual grounded, pixel-wise interpretative capabilities. To enable effective training on diverse data sources, we present a unified training strategy that supports co-training across multiple datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that X-SAM achieves state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of image segmentation benchmarks, highlighting its efficiency for multimodal, pixel-level visual understanding. Code is available at https://github.com/wanghao9610/X-SAM.

### LLM Collaboration With Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
**Authors**: Shuo Liu, Zeyu Liang, Xueguang Lyu, Christopher Amato

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T17:18:25Z

**Summary**: A large amount of work has been done in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) for modeling and solving problems with multiple interacting agents. However, most LLMs are pretrained independently and not specifically optimized for coordination. Existing LLM fine-tuning frameworks rely on individual rewards, which require complex reward designs for each agent to encourage collaboration. To address these challenges, we model LLM collaboration as a cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) problem. We develop a multi-agent, multi-turn algorithm, Multi-Agent Group Relative Policy Optimization (MAGRPO), to solve it, building on current RL approaches for LLMs as well as MARL techniques. Our experiments on LLM writing and coding collaboration demonstrate that fine-tuning MAS with MAGRPO enables agents to generate high-quality responses efficiently through effective cooperation. Our approach opens the door to using other MARL methods for LLMs and highlights the associated challenges.

### Stochastic Calculus for Pathwise Observables of Markov-Jump Processes:   Unification of Diffusion and Jump Dynamics
**Authors**: Lars Torbjørn Stutzer, Cai Dieball, Aljaž Godec

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T17:15:03Z

**Summary**: Path-wise observables--functionals of stochastic trajectories--are at the heart of time-average statistical mechanics and are central to thermodynamic inequalities such as uncertainty relations, speed limits, and correlation-bounds. They provide a means of thermodynamic inference in the typical situation, when not all dissipative degrees of freedom in a system are experimentally accessible. So far, theories focusing on path-wise observables have been developing in two major directions, diffusion processes and Markov-jump dynamics, in a virtually disjoint manner. Moreover, even the respective results for diffusion and jump dynamics were derived with a patchwork of different approaches that are predominantly indirect. Stochastic calculus was recently shown to provide a direct approach to path-wise observables of diffusion processes, while a corresponding framework for jump dynamics remained elusive. In our work we develop, in an exact parallelism with continuous-space diffusion, a complete stochastic calculus for path-wise observables of Markov-jump processes. We formulate a "Langevin equation" for jump processes, define general path-wise observables, and establish their covariation structure, whereby we fully account for transients and time-inhomogeneous dynamics. We prove the known kinds of thermodynamic inequalities in their most general form and discus saturation conditions. We determine the response of path-wise observables to general (incl. thermal) perturbations and carry out the continuum limit to achieve the complete unification of diffusion and jump dynamics. Our results open new avenues in the direction of discrete-state analogs of generative diffusion models and the learning of stochastic thermodynamics from fluctuating trajectories.

**Summary**: Simulating how team members collaborate within complex environments using Agentic AI is a promising approach to explore hypotheses grounded in social science theories and study team behaviors. We introduce VirtLab, a user-friendly, customizable, multi-agent, and scalable team simulation system that enables testing teams with LLM-based agents in spatial and temporal settings. This system addresses the current frameworks' design and technical limitations that do not consider flexible simulation scenarios and spatial settings. VirtLab contains a simulation engine and a web interface that enables both technical and non-technical users to formulate, run, and analyze team simulations without programming. We demonstrate the system's utility by comparing ground truth data with simulated scenarios.

**Authors**: Xu Guo, Tianyi Liang, Tong Jian, Xiaogui Yang, Ling-I Wu, Chenhui Li, Zhihui Lu, Qipeng Guo, Kai Chen

**Updated**: 2025-08-07T11:30:20Z

**Summary**: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) improves instruction following capabilities of large language models (LLMs), but suffers from training inefficiency due to inadequate difficulty assessment. Moreover, RLVR is prone to over-optimization, where LLMs exploit verification shortcuts without aligning to the actual intent of user instructions. We introduce Instruction Following Decorator (IFDecorator}, a framework that wraps RLVR training into a robust and sample-efficient pipeline. It consists of three components: (1) a cooperative-adversarial data flywheel that co-evolves instructions and hybrid verifications, generating progressively more challenging instruction-verification pairs; (2) IntentCheck, a bypass module enforcing intent alignment; and (3) trip wires, a diagnostic mechanism that detects reward hacking via trap instructions, which trigger and capture shortcut exploitation behaviors. Our Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct-IFDecorator achieves 87.43% accuracy on IFEval, outperforming larger proprietary models such as GPT-4o. Additionally, we demonstrate substantial improvements on FollowBench while preserving general capabilities. Our trip wires show significant reductions in reward hacking rates. We will release models, code, and data for future research.

### p-MoD: Building Mixture-of-Depths MLLMs via Progressive Ratio Decay
**Authors**: Jun Zhang, Desen Meng, Zhengming Zhang, Zhenpeng Huang, Tao Wu, Limin Wang

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T16:57:39Z

**Summary**: Despite the remarkable performance of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) across diverse tasks, the substantial training and inference costs impede their advancement. In this paper, we propose p-MoD, an efficient MLLM architecture that significantly reduces training and inference costs while maintaining model performance. The majority of computation in MLLMs stems from the overwhelming volume of vision tokens processed by the transformer-based LLM. Accordingly, we leverage the Mixture-of-Depths (MoD) mechanism, where each LLM layer selects essential vision tokens to process while skipping redundant ones. However, integrating MoD into MLLMs is non-trivial. To address the challenges of training and inference stability as well as limited training data, we adapt the MoD module with two novel designs: tanh-gated weight normalization (TanhNorm) and symmetric token reweighting (STRing). Moreover, we observe that vision tokens exhibit higher redundancy in deeper layers and thus design a progressive ratio decay (PRD) strategy, which gradually reduces the token retention ratio layer by layer, employing a shifted cosine schedule. This crucial design fully unleashes the potential of MoD, significantly boosting the efficiency and performance of our models. Extensive experiments on two baseline models across 15 benchmarks show that our model matches or even surpasses the performance of corresponding baselines, while requiring only 55.6% TFLOPs and 53.7% KV cache storage during inference, and 77.7% GPU hours during training.

### P-Aligner: Enabling Pre-Alignment of Language Models via Principled   Instruction Synthesis
**Authors**: Feifan Song, Bofei Gao, Yifan Song, Yi Liu, Weimin Xiong, Yuyang Song, Tianyu Liu, Guoyin Wang, Houfeng Wang

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T16:51:38Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are expected to produce safe, helpful, and honest content during interaction with human users, but they frequently fail to align with such values when given flawed instructions, e.g., missing context, ambiguous directives, or inappropriate tone, leaving substantial room for improvement along multiple dimensions. A cost-effective yet high-impact way is to pre-align instructions before the model begins decoding. Existing approaches either rely on prohibitive test-time search costs or end-to-end model rewrite, which is powered by a customized training corpus with unclear objectives. In this work, we demonstrate that the goal of efficient and effective preference alignment can be achieved by P-Aligner, a lightweight module generating instructions that preserve the original intents while being expressed in a more human-preferred form. P-Aligner is trained on UltraPrompt, a new dataset synthesized via a proposed principle-guided pipeline using Monte-Carlo Tree Search, which systematically explores the space of candidate instructions that are closely tied to human preference. Experiments across different methods show that P-Aligner generally outperforms strong baselines across various models and benchmarks, including average win-rate gains of 28.35% and 8.69% on GPT-4-turbo and Gemma-2-SimPO, respectively. Further analyses validate its effectiveness and efficiency through multiple perspectives, including data quality, search strategies, iterative deployment, and time overhead.

### RL-PLUS: Countering Capability Boundary Collapse of LLMs in   Reinforcement Learning with Hybrid-policy Optimization
**Authors**: Yihong Dong, Xue Jiang, Yongding Tao, Huanyu Liu, Kechi Zhang, Lili Mou, Rongyu Cao, Yingwei Ma, Jue Chen, Binhua Li, Zhi Jin, Fei Huang, Yongbin Li, Ge Li

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T16:36:42Z

**Summary**: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) has significantly advanced the complex reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, it struggles to break through the inherent capability boundaries of the base LLM, due to its essentially on-policy strategy coupled with LLM's immense action space and sparse reward. Critically, RLVR can lead to the capability boundary collapse, narrowing the LLM's problem-solving scope. To address this problem, we propose RL-PLUS, a novel hybrid-policy optimization approach for LLMs that synergizes internal exploitation with external data to achieve stronger reasoning capabilities and surpass the boundaries of base models. RL-PLUS integrates two core components, i.e., Multiple Importance Sampling to address distributional mismatch from external data, and Exploration-Based Advantage Function to guide the model towards high-value, unexplored reasoning paths. We provide both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments to demonstrate the superiority and generalizability of our approach. Compared with existing RLVR methods, RL-PLUS achieves 1) state-of-the-art performance on six math reasoning benchmarks; 2) superior performance on six out-of-distribution reasoning tasks; 3) consistent and significant gains across diverse model families, with average relative improvements up to 69.2\%. Moreover, the analysis of Pass@k curves indicates that RL-PLUS effectively resolves the capability boundary collapse problem.

### TURA: Tool-Augmented Unified Retrieval Agent for AI Search
**Authors**: Zhejun Zhao, Yuehu Dong, Alley Liu, Lixue Zheng, Pingsheng Liu, Dongdong Shen, Long Xia, Jiashu Zhao, Dawei Yin

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T16:24:17Z

**Summary**: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) is transforming search engines into conversational AI search products, primarily using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) on web corpora. However, this paradigm has significant industrial limitations. Traditional RAG approaches struggle with real-time needs and structured queries that require accessing dynamically generated content like ticket availability or inventory. Limited to indexing static pages, search engines cannot perform the interactive queries needed for such time-sensitive data. Academic research has focused on optimizing RAG for static content, overlooking complex intents and the need for dynamic sources like databases and real-time APIs. To bridge this gap, we introduce TURA (Tool-Augmented Unified Retrieval Agent for AI Search), a novel three-stage framework that combines RAG with agentic tool-use to access both static content and dynamic, real-time information. TURA has three key components: an Intent-Aware Retrieval module to decompose queries and retrieve information sources encapsulated as Model Context Protocol (MCP) Servers, a DAG-based Task Planner that models task dependencies as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) for optimal parallel execution, and a lightweight Distilled Agent Executor for efficient tool calling. TURA is the first architecture to systematically bridge the gap between static RAG and dynamic information sources for a world-class AI search product. Serving tens of millions of users, it leverages an agentic framework to deliver robust, real-time answers while meeting the low-latency demands of a large-scale industrial system.

### Basis Selection: Low-Rank Decomposition of Pretrained Large Language   Models for Target Applications
**Authors**: Yang Li, Daniel Agyei Asante, Changsheng Zhao, Ernie Chang, Yangyang Shi, Vikas Chandra

**Updated**: 2025-08-07T01:02:42Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) significantly enhance the performance of various applications, but they are computationally intensive and energy-demanding. This makes it challenging to deploy them on devices with limited resources, such as personal computers and mobile/wearable devices, and results in substantial inference costs in resource-rich environments like cloud servers. To extend the use of LLMs, we introduce a low-rank decomposition approach to effectively compress these models, tailored to the requirements of specific applications. We observe that LLMs pretrained on general datasets contain many redundant components not needed for particular applications. Our method focuses on identifying and removing these redundant parts, retaining only the necessary elements for the target applications. Specifically, we represent the weight matrices of LLMs as a linear combination of base components. We then prune the irrelevant bases and enhance the model with new bases beneficial for specific applications. Deep compression results on the Llama 2-7b and -13B models, conducted on target applications including mathematical reasoning and code generation, show that our method significantly reduces model size while maintaining comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art low-rank compression techniques.

### Pseudo Depth Meets Gaussian: A Feed-forward RGB SLAM Baseline
**Authors**: Linqing Zhao, Xiuwei Xu, Yirui Wang, Hao Wang, Wenzhao Zheng, Yansong Tang, Haibin Yan, Jiwen Lu

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T16:16:58Z

**Summary**: Incrementally recovering real-sized 3D geometry from a pose-free RGB stream is a challenging task in 3D reconstruction, requiring minimal assumptions on input data. Existing methods can be broadly categorized into end-to-end and visual SLAM-based approaches, both of which either struggle with long sequences or depend on slow test-time optimization and depth sensors. To address this, we first integrate a depth estimator into an RGB-D SLAM system, but this approach is hindered by inaccurate geometric details in predicted depth. Through further investigation, we find that 3D Gaussian mapping can effectively solve this problem. Building on this, we propose an online 3D reconstruction method using 3D Gaussian-based SLAM, combined with a feed-forward recurrent prediction module to directly infer camera pose from optical flow. This approach replaces slow test-time optimization with fast network inference, significantly improving tracking speed. Additionally, we introduce a local graph rendering technique to enhance robustness in feed-forward pose prediction. Experimental results on the Replica and TUM-RGBD datasets, along with a real-world deployment demonstration, show that our method achieves performance on par with the state-of-the-art SplaTAM, while reducing tracking time by more than 90\%.

### Neutralizing Token Aggregation via Information Augmentation for   Efficient Test-Time Adaptation
**Authors**: Yizhe Xiong, Zihan Zhou, Yiwen Liang, Hui Chen, Zijia Lin, Tianxiang Hao, Fan Zhang, Jungong Han, Guiguang Ding

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T16:16:17Z

**Summary**: Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) has emerged as an effective solution for adapting Vision Transformers (ViT) to distribution shifts without additional training data. However, existing TTA methods often incur substantial computational overhead, limiting their applicability in resource-constrained real-world scenarios. To reduce inference cost, plug-and-play token aggregation methods merge redundant tokens in ViTs to reduce total processed tokens. Albeit efficient, it suffers from significant performance degradation when directly integrated with existing TTA methods. We formalize this problem as Efficient Test-Time Adaptation (ETTA), seeking to preserve the adaptation capability of TTA while reducing inference latency. In this paper, we first provide a theoretical analysis from a novel mutual information perspective, showing that token aggregation inherently leads to information loss, which cannot be fully mitigated by conventional norm-tuning-based TTA methods. Guided by this insight, we propose to \textbf{N}eutralize Token \textbf{A}ggregation \textbf{v}ia \textbf{I}nformation \textbf{A}ugmentation (\textbf{NAVIA}). Specifically, we directly augment the [CLS] token embedding and incorporate adaptive biases into the [CLS] token in shallow layers of ViTs. We theoretically demonstrate that these augmentations, when optimized via entropy minimization, recover the information lost due to token aggregation. Extensive experiments across various out-of-distribution benchmarks demonstrate that NAVIA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by over 2.5\%, while achieving an inference latency reduction of more than 20\%, effectively addressing the ETTA challenge.

### Bayesian MI-LASSO for Variable Selection on Multiply-Imputed Data
**Authors**: Jungang Zou, Sijian Wang, Qixuan Chen

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T16:10:41Z

**Summary**: Multiple imputation is widely used for handling missing data in real-world applications. For variable selection on multiply-imputed datasets, however, if selection is performed on each imputed dataset separately, it can result in different sets of selected variables across datasets. MI-LASSO, one of the most commonly used approaches to this problem, regards the same variable across all separate imputed datasets as a group variable and exploits the group LASSO to yield a consistent variable selection across all the multiply-imputed datasets. In this paper, we extend MI-LASSO to a Bayesian framework and propose four Bayesian MI-LASSO models for variable selection on multiply-imputed data, including three shrinkage prior-based and one Spike-Slab prior-based methods. To further support robust variable selection, we develop a four-step projection predictive variable selection procedure that avoids ad hoc thresholding and facilitates valid post-selection inference. Simulation studies showed that the Bayesian MI-LASSO outperformed MI-LASSO and other alternative approaches, achieving higher specificity and lower mean squared error across a range of settings. We further demonstrated these methods via a case study using a multiply-imputed dataset from the University of Michigan Dioxin Exposure Study. The R package BMIselect is available on CRAN.

### Incorporation of model accuracy in gravitational wave Bayesian inference
**Authors**: Charlie Hoy, Sarp Akcay, Jake Mac Uilliam, Jonathan E. Thompson

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T16:08:52Z

**Summary**: Inferring the properties of colliding black holes from gravitational-wave observations is subject to systematic errors arising from modelling uncertainties. Although the accuracy of each model can be calculated through comparison to theoretical expectations from general relativity, Bayesian analyses are yet to incorporate this information. As such, a mixture model is typically used where results obtained with different gravitational-wave models are combined with either equal weight, or based on their relative Bayesian evidence. In this work we present a novel method to incorporate the accuracy of multiple models in gravitational-wave Bayesian analyses. By analysing simulated gravitational-wave signals in zero-noise, we show that our technique uses $30\%$ less computational resources, and more faithfully recovers the true parameters than existing techniques. We further apply our method to a real gravitational-wave signal and, when assuming the binary black hole hypothesis, demonstrate that the source of GW191109_010717 has unequal component masses, with the primary having a $69\%$ probability that it lies above the maximum black hole mass from stellar collapse. We envisage that this method will become an essential tool within ground-based gravitational-wave astronomy.

### UniTalker: Conversational Speech-Visual Synthesis
**Authors**: Yifan Hu, Rui Liu, Yi Ren, Xiang Yin, Haizhou Li

**Updated**: 2025-08-07T03:38:23Z

**Summary**: Conversational Speech Synthesis (CSS) is a key task in the user-agent interaction area, aiming to generate more expressive and empathetic speech for users. However, it is well-known that "listening" and "eye contact" play crucial roles in conveying emotions during real-world interpersonal communication. Existing CSS research is limited to perceiving only text and speech within the dialogue context, which restricts its effectiveness. Moreover, speech-only responses further constrain the interactive experience. To address these limitations, we introduce a Conversational Speech-Visual Synthesis (CSVS) task as an extension of traditional CSS. By leveraging multimodal dialogue context, it provides users with coherent audiovisual responses. To this end, we develop a CSVS system named UniTalker, which is a unified model that seamlessly integrates multimodal perception and multimodal rendering capabilities. Specifically, it leverages a large-scale language model to comprehensively understand multimodal cues in the dialogue context, including speaker, text, speech, and the talking-face animations. After that, it employs multi-task sequence prediction to first infer the target utterance's emotion and then generate empathetic speech and natural talking-face animations. To ensure that the generated speech-visual content remains consistent in terms of emotion, content, and duration, we introduce three key optimizations: 1) Designing a specialized neural landmark codec to tokenize and reconstruct facial expression sequences. 2) Proposing a bimodal speech-visual hard alignment decoding strategy. 3) Applying emotion-guided rendering during the generation stage. Comprehensive objective and subjective experiments demonstrate that our model synthesizes more empathetic speech and provides users with more natural and emotionally consistent talking-face animations.

### Measuring the Carbon Footprint of Cryptographic Privacy-Enhancing   Technologies
**Authors**: Marc Damie, Mihai Pop, Merijn Posthuma

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T16:07:29Z

**Summary**: Privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) have attracted significant attention in response to privacy regulations, driving the development of applications that prioritize user data protection. At the same time, the information and communication technology (ICT) sector faces growing pressure to reduce its environmental footprint, particularly its carbon emissions. While numerous studies have assessed the energy footprint of various ICT applications, the environmental footprint of cryptographic PETs remains largely unexplored.   Our work addresses this gap by proposing a standardized methodology for evaluating the carbon footprint of PETs. To demonstrate this methodology, we focus on PETs supporting client-server applications as they are the simplest to deploy. In particular, we measure the energy consumption and carbon footprint increase induced by five cryptographic PETs (compared to their non-private equivalent): HTTPS web browsing, encrypted machine learning (ML) inference, encrypted ML training, encrypted databases, and encrypted emails. Our findings reveal significant variability in carbon footprint increases, ranging from a twofold increase in HTTPS web browsing to a 100,000-fold increase in encrypted ML.   Our study provides essential data to help decision-makers assess privacy-carbon trade-offs in such applications. Finally, we outline key research directions for developing PETs that balance strong privacy protection with environmental sustainability.

### Evaluating Robustness of LLMs in Question Answering on Multilingual   Noisy OCR Data
**Authors**: Bhawna Piryani, Jamshid Mozafari, Abdelrahman Abdallah, Antoine Doucet, Adam Jatowt

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T16:07:06Z

**Summary**: Optical Character Recognition (OCR) plays a crucial role in digitizing historical and multilingual documents, yet OCR errors - imperfect extraction of text, including character insertion, deletion, and substitution can significantly impact downstream tasks like question-answering (QA). In this work, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of how OCR-induced noise affects the performance of Multilingual QA Systems. To support this analysis, we introduce a multilingual QA dataset MultiOCR-QA, comprising 50K question-answer pairs across three languages, English, French, and German. The dataset is curated from OCR-ed historical documents, which include different levels and types of OCR noise. We then evaluate how different state-of-the-art Large Language models (LLMs) perform under different error conditions, focusing on three major OCR error types. Our findings show that QA systems are highly prone to OCR-induced errors and perform poorly on noisy OCR text. By comparing model performance on clean versus noisy texts, we provide insights into the limitations of current approaches and emphasize the need for more noise-resilient QA systems in historical digitization contexts.

### Share Your Attention: Transformer Weight Sharing via Matrix-based   Dictionary Learning
**Authors**: Magauiya Zhussip, Dmitriy Shopkhoev, Ammar Ali, Stamatios Lefkimmiatis

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T16:06:43Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized AI applications, yet their high computational and memory demands hinder their widespread deployment. Existing compression techniques focus on intra-block optimizations (e.g. low-rank approximation, attention head pruning), while the repetitive layered structure of transformers implies significant inter-block redundancy - a dimension largely unexplored beyond key-value (KV) caching. Inspired by dictionary learning in CNNs, we propose a framework for structured weight sharing across transformer layers. Our approach decomposes attention projection matrices into shared dictionary atoms, reducing the attention module's parameters by 66.7% while achieving on-par performance. Unlike complex methods requiring distillation or architectural changes, MASA (Matrix Atom Sharing in Attention) operates as a drop-in replacement - trained with standard optimizers - and represents each layer's weights as linear combinations of shared matrix atoms. Experiments across scales (100M-700M parameters) show that MASA achieves better benchmark accuracy and perplexity than grouped-query attention (GQA), low-rank baselines and recently proposed Repeat-all-over/Sequential sharing at comparable parameter budgets. Ablation studies confirm robustness to the dictionary size and the efficacy of shared representations in capturing cross-layer statistical regularities. Extending to Vision Transformers (ViT), MASA matches performance metrics on image classification and detection tasks with 66.7% fewer attention parameters. By combining dictionary learning strategies with transformer efficiency, MASA offers a scalable blueprint for parameter-efficient models without sacrificing performance. Finally, we investigate the possibility of employing MASA on pretrained LLMs to reduce their number of parameters without experiencing any significant drop in their performance.

**Authors**: Eduardo Pacheco, Atila Orhon, Berkin Durmus, Blaise Munyampirwa, Andrey Leonov

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T16:02:25Z

**Summary**: Even state-of-the-art speaker diarization systems exhibit high variance in error rates across different datasets, representing numerous use cases and domains. Furthermore, comparing across systems requires careful application of best practices such as dataset splits and metric definitions to allow for apples-to-apples comparison. We propose SDBench (Speaker Diarization Benchmark), an open-source benchmark suite that integrates 13 diverse datasets with built-in tooling for consistent and fine-grained analysis of speaker diarization performance for various on-device and server-side systems. SDBench enables reproducible evaluation and easy integration of new systems over time. To demonstrate the efficacy of SDBench, we built SpeakerKit, an inference efficiency-focused system built on top of Pyannote v3. SDBench enabled rapid execution of ablation studies that led to SpeakerKit being 9.6x faster than Pyannote v3 while achieving comparable error rates. We benchmark 6 state-of-the-art systems including Deepgram, AWS Transcribe, and Pyannote AI API, revealing important trade-offs between accuracy and speed.

### A Relative Ignorability Framework for Decision-Relevant Observability in   Control Theory and Reinforcement Learning
**Authors**: MaryLena Bleile, Minh-Nhat Phung, Minh-Binh Tran

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T15:51:18Z

**Summary**: Sequential decision-making systems routinely operate with missing or incomplete data. Classical reinforcement learning theory, which is commonly used to solve sequential decision problems, assumes Markovian observability, which may not hold under partial observability. Causal inference paradigms formalise ignorability of missingness. We show these views can be unified and generalized in order to guarantee Q-learning convergence even when the Markov property fails. To do so, we introduce the concept of relative ignorability. Relative ignorability is a graphical-causal criterion which refines the requirements for accurate decision-making based on incomplete data. Theoretical results and simulations both reveal that non-Markovian stochastic processes whose missingness is relatively ignorable with respect to causal estimands can still be optimized using standard Reinforcement Learning algorithms. These results expand the theoretical foundations of safe, data-efficient AI to real-world environments where complete information is unattainable.

### SID: Benchmarking Guided Instruction Capabilities in STEM Education with   a Socratic Interdisciplinary Dialogues Dataset
**Authors**: Mei Jiang, Houping Yue, Bingdong Li, Hao Hao, Ying Qian, Bo Jiang, Aimin Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T15:49:26Z

**Summary**: Fostering students' abilities for knowledge integration and transfer in complex problem-solving scenarios is a core objective of modern education, and interdisciplinary STEM is a key pathway to achieve this, yet it requires expert guidance that is difficult to scale. While LLMs offer potential in this regard, their true capability for guided instruction remains unclear due to the lack of an effective evaluation benchmark. To address this, we introduce SID, the first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the higher-order guidance capabilities of LLMs in multi-turn, interdisciplinary Socratic dialogues. Our contributions include a large-scale dataset of 10,000 dialogue turns across 48 complex STEM projects, a novel annotation schema for capturing deep pedagogical features, and a new suite of evaluation metrics (e.g., X-SRG). Baseline experiments confirm that even state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to execute effective guided dialogues that lead students to achieve knowledge integration and transfer. This highlights the critical value of our benchmark in driving the development of more pedagogically-aware LLMs.

### EchoMimicV3: 1.3B Parameters are All You Need for Unified Multi-Modal   and Multi-Task Human Animation
**Authors**: Rang Meng, Yan Wang, Weipeng Wu, Ruobing Zheng, Yuming Li, Chenguang Ma

**Updated**: 2025-08-07T03:40:52Z

**Summary**: Recent work on human animation usually incorporates large-scale video models, thereby achieving more vivid performance. However, the practical use of such methods is hindered by the slow inference speed and high computational demands. Moreover, traditional work typically employs separate models for each animation task, increasing costs in multi-task scenarios and worsening the dilemma. To address these limitations, we introduce EchoMimicV3, an efficient framework that unifies multi-task and multi-modal human animation. At the core of EchoMimicV3 lies a threefold design: a Soup-of-Tasks paradigm, a Soup-of-Modals paradigm, and a novel training and inference strategy. The Soup-of-Tasks leverages multi-task mask inputs and a counter-intuitive task allocation strategy to achieve multi-task gains without multi-model pains. Meanwhile, the Soup-of-Modals introduces a Coupled-Decoupled Multi-Modal Cross Attention module to inject multi-modal conditions, complemented by a Multi-Modal Timestep Phase-aware Dynamical Allocation mechanism to modulate multi-modal mixtures. Besides, we propose Negative Direct Preference Optimization, Phase-aware Negative Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG), and Long Video CFG, which ensure stable training and inference. Extensive experiments and analyses demonstrate that EchoMimicV3, with a minimal model size of 1.3 billion parameters, achieves competitive performance in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

**Summary**: Model merging aims to integrate multiple task-specific models into a unified model that inherits the capabilities of the task-specific models, without additional training. Existing model merging methods often lack consideration of the varying contribution ratios of different task-specific models to the final merged model. In this paper, we propose Mixup Model Merge (M3), a simple yet effective method inspired by the randomized linear interpolation strategy from the Mixup data augmentation technique. M3 performs randomized linear interpolation in parameter space between two task-specific LLMs, where interpolation coefficients are sampled from a Beta distribution to explore diverse contribution ratios. This controllable randomness allows M3 to outperform standard equal-ratio merging by discovering better contribution ratio combinations. Extensive experiments show that M3 significantly (1) improves merged LLM performance across tasks, (2) enhances out-of-distribution and adversarial robustness, (3) outperforms the positive effects of the sparsification method DARE on model merging and can be further combined with DARE to achieve superior results, and (4) balances exploration efficiency and diversity in contribution ratios by tuning the Beta distribution's shape parameters. The code is provided in the supplementary materials.

**Authors**: Xinlin Zhuang, Jiahui Peng, Ren Ma, Yinfan Wang, Tianyi Bai, Xingjian Wei, Jiantao Qiu, Chi Zhang, Ying Qian, Conghui He

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T15:34:10Z

**Summary**: The composition of pre-training datasets for large language models (LLMs) remains largely undisclosed, hindering transparency and efforts to optimize data quality, a critical driver of model performance. Current data selection methods, such as natural language quality assessments, diversity-based filters, and classifier-based approaches, are limited by single-dimensional evaluation or redundancy-focused strategies. To address these gaps, we propose four dimensions to evaluate data quality: professionalism, readability, reasoning, and cleanliness. We further introduce Meta-rater,a multi-dimensional data selection method that integrates these dimensions with existing quality metrics through learned optimal weightings. Meta-rater employs proxy models to train a regression model that predicts validation loss, enabling the identification of optimal combinations of quality scores. Experiments demonstrate that Meta-rater doubles convergence speed for 1.3B parameter models and improves downstream task performance by 3.23, with advantages that scale to models as large as 7.2B parameters. Our work establishes that holistic, multi-dimensional quality integration significantly outperforms conventional single-dimension approaches, offering a scalable paradigm for enhancing pre-training efficiency and model capability. To advance future research, we release scripts, data, and models at https://github.com/opendatalab/Meta-rater.

**Authors**: Tian-Fang Zhao, Wen-Xi Yang, Guan Liu, Liang Yang

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T15:28:04Z

**Summary**: Collaborative partnership matters in inquiry-oriented education. However, most study partners are selected either rely on experience-based assignments with little scientific planning or build on rule-based machine assistants, encountering difficulties in knowledge expansion and inadequate flexibility. This paper proposes an LLM-empowered agent model for simulating and selecting learning partners tailored to inquiry-oriented learning, named InqEduAgent. Generative agents are designed to capture cognitive and evaluative features of learners in real-world scenarios. Then, an adaptive matching algorithm with Gaussian process augmentation is formulated to identify patterns within prior knowledge. Optimal learning-partner matches are provided for learners facing different exercises. The experimental results show the optimal performance of InqEduAgent in most knowledge-learning scenarios and LLM environment with different levels of capabilities. This study promotes the intelligent allocation of human-based learning partners and the formulation of AI-based learning partners. The code, data, and appendix are publicly available at https://github.com/InqEduAgent/InqEduAgent.

### The Dark Side of LLMs: Agent-based Attacks for Complete Computer   Takeover
**Authors**: Matteo Lupinacci, Francesco Aurelio Pironti, Francesco Blefari, Francesco Romeo, Luigi Arena, Angelo Furfaro

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T15:27:03Z

**Summary**: The rapid adoption of Large Language Model (LLM) agents and multi-agent systems enables remarkable capabilities in natural language processing and generation. However, these systems introduce unprecedented security vulnerabilities that extend beyond traditional content generation attacks to system-level compromise. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of the security of LLMs used as reasoning engines within autonomous agents, highlighting how they can be exploited as attack vectors capable of achieving complete computer takeover. We focus on how different attack surfaces and trust boundaries - Direct Prompt Injection, RAG Backdoor, and Inter Agent Trust - can be leveraged to orchestrate such takeovers. We demonstrate that adversaries can effectively coerce popular LLMs (including GPT-4, Claude-4 and Gemini-2.5) into autonomously installing and executing malware on victim machines. Our evaluation of 18 state-of-the-art LLMs reveals an alarming scenario: 94.4% of models succumb to Direct Prompt Injection and 83.3% are vulnerable to the more stealth and evasive RAG Backdoor Attack. Notably, we tested trust boundaries within multi-agent systems, where LLM agents interact and influence each other, and we revealed a critical security flaw: LLMs which successfully resist direct injection or RAG backdoor will execute identical payloads when requested by peer agents. Our findings show that 100.0% of tested LLMs can be compromised through Inter-Agent Trust Exploitation attacks and that every model exhibits context-dependent security behaviors that create exploitable blind spots. Our results also highlight the need to increase awareness and research on the security risks of LLMs, showing a paradigm shift in cybersecurity threats, where AI tools themselves become sophisticated attack vectors.

**Authors**: Zikang Leng, Megha Thukral, Yaqi Liu, Hrudhai Rajasekhar, Shruthi K. Hiremath, Jiaman He, Thomas Plötz

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T15:26:58Z

**Summary**: A major challenge in developing robust and generalizable Human Activity Recognition (HAR) systems for smart homes is the lack of large and diverse labeled datasets. Variations in home layouts, sensor configurations, and individual behaviors further exacerbate this issue. To address this, we leverage the idea of embodied AI agents-virtual agents that perceive and act within simulated environments guided by internal world models. We introduce AgentSense, a virtual data generation pipeline in which agents live out daily routines in simulated smart homes, with behavior guided by Large Language Models (LLMs). The LLM generates diverse synthetic personas and realistic routines grounded in the environment, which are then decomposed into fine-grained actions. These actions are executed in an extended version of the VirtualHome simulator, which we augment with virtual ambient sensors that record the agents' activities. Our approach produces rich, privacy-preserving sensor data that reflects real-world diversity. We evaluate AgentSense on five real HAR datasets. Models pretrained on the generated data consistently outperform baselines, especially in low-resource settings. Furthermore, combining the generated virtual sensor data with a small amount of real data achieves performance comparable to training on full real-world datasets. These results highlight the potential of using LLM-guided embodied agents for scalable and cost-effective sensor data generation in HAR.

### LLMs are Single-threaded Reasoners: Demystifying the Working Mechanism   of Soft Thinking
**Authors**: Chünhung Wu, Jinliang Lu, Zixuan Ren, Gangqiang Hu, Zhi Wu, Dai Dai, Hua Wu

**Updated**: 2025-08-07T06:38:21Z

**Summary**: Human cognition naturally engages with abstract and fluid concepts, whereas existing reasoning models often rely on generating discrete tokens, potentially constraining their expressive capabilities. Recent advancements aim to address this limitation by enabling large language models (LLMs) to generate soft, abstract tokens, thus facilitating reasoning within a continuous concept space. This paper explores the `Soft Thinking' capabilities of various LLMs by examining the models' internal behavior using a suite of probing techniques. Contrary to the common belief that Soft Thinking enables the simultaneous exploration of diverse reasoning paths, our findings reveal that LLMs predominantly rely on the most influential component of the soft inputs during subsequent decoding steps. This reliance hinders the exploration of different reasoning paths and reduces vanilla Soft Thinking to a form of greedy decoding, obscuring the advantage of transmitting more information through Soft Tokens. To tackle this issue, we explore sampling strategies to introduce \emph{randomness}, employing methods such as Dirichlet resampling and the Gumbel-Softmax trick. Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating randomness can alleviate the limitations of vanilla approaches and unleash the potential of Soft Thinking. Notably, the Gumbel-Softmax trick provides adequate randomness with controlled smoothness, resulting in superior performance across eight reasoning benchmarks.

### Unveiling the Landscape of Clinical Depression Assessment: From   Behavioral Signatures to Psychiatric Reasoning
**Authors**: Zhuang Chen, Guanqun Bi, Wen Zhang, Jiawei Hu, Aoyun Wang, Xiyao Xiao, Kun Feng, Minlie Huang

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T15:13:24Z

**Summary**: Depression is a widespread mental disorder that affects millions worldwide. While automated depression assessment shows promise, most studies rely on limited or non-clinically validated data, and often prioritize complex model design over real-world effectiveness. In this paper, we aim to unveil the landscape of clinical depression assessment. We introduce C-MIND, a clinical neuropsychiatric multimodal diagnosis dataset collected over two years from real hospital visits. Each participant completes three structured psychiatric tasks and receives a final diagnosis from expert clinicians, with informative audio, video, transcript, and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) signals recorded. Using C-MIND, we first analyze behavioral signatures relevant to diagnosis. We train a range of classical models to quantify how different tasks and modalities contribute to diagnostic performance, and dissect the effectiveness of their combinations. We then explore whether LLMs can perform psychiatric reasoning like clinicians and identify their clear limitations in realistic clinical settings. In response, we propose to guide the reasoning process with clinical expertise and consistently improves LLM diagnostic performance by up to 10% in Macro-F1 score. We aim to build an infrastructure for clinical depression assessment from both data and algorithmic perspectives, enabling C-MIND to facilitate grounded and reliable research for mental healthcare.

### Balancing Stylization and Truth via Disentangled Representation Steering
**Authors**: Chenglei Shen, Zhongxiang Sun, Teng Shi, Xiao Zhang, Jun Xu

**Updated**: 2025-08-07T06:14:50Z

**Summary**: Generating stylized large language model (LLM) responses via representation editing is a promising way for fine-grained output control. However, there exists an inherent trade-off: imposing a distinctive style often degrades truthfulness. Existing representation editing methods, by naively injecting style signals, overlook this collateral impact and frequently contaminate the model's core truthfulness representations, resulting in reduced answer correctness. We term this phenomenon stylization-induced truthfulness collapse. We attribute this issue to latent coupling between style and truth directions in certain key attention heads, and propose StyliTruth, a mechanism that preserves stylization while keeping truthfulness intact. StyliTruth separates the style-relevant and truth-relevant subspaces in the model's representation space via an orthogonal deflation process. This decomposition enables independent control of style and truth in their own subspaces, minimizing interference. By designing adaptive, token-level steering vectors within each subspace, we dynamically and precisely control the generation process to maintain both stylistic fidelity and truthfulness. We validate our method on multiple styles and languages. Extensive experiments and analyses show that StyliTruth significantly reduces stylization-induced truthfulness collapse and outperforms existing inference-time intervention methods in balancing style adherence with truthfulness.

### SLR: Automated Synthesis for Scalable Logical Reasoning
**Authors**: Lukas Helff, Ahmad Omar, Felix Friedrich, Antonia Wüst, Hikaru Shindo, Rupert Mitchell, Tim Woydt, Patrick Schramowski, Wolfgang Stammer, Kristian Kersting

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T15:09:52Z

**Summary**: We introduce SLR, an end-to-end framework for systematic evaluation and training of Large Language Models (LLMs) via Scalable Logical Reasoning. Given a user's task specification, SLR automatically synthesizes (i) an instruction prompt for an inductive reasoning task, (ii) a validation program, executable on model outputs to provide verifiable rewards, and (iii) the latent ground-truth rule. This process is fully automated, scalable, requires no human annotations, and offers precise control over task difficulty. Using SLR, we create SLR-Bench, a benchmark comprising 19k prompts organized into 20 curriculum levels that progressively increase in relational, arithmetic, and recursive complexity. Large-scale evaluation reveals that contemporary LLMs readily produce syntactically valid rules, yet often fail at correct logical inference. Recent reasoning LLMs demonstrate improved performance but incur very high test-time computation, with costs exceeding $300 for just 1,000 prompts. Finally, curriculum learning via SLR doubles Llama-3-8B accuracy on SLR-Bench, achieving parity with Gemini-Flash-Thinking at a fraction of computational cost. Moreover, these reasoning capabilities generalize to a wide range of established benchmarks, underscoring the effectiveness of SLR for downstream reasoning.

### RAIDX: A Retrieval-Augmented Generation and GRPO Reinforcement Learning   Framework for Explainable Deepfake Detection
**Authors**: Tianxiao Li, Zhenglin Huang, Haiquan Wen, Yiwei He, Shuchang Lyu, Baoyuan Wu, Guangliang Cheng

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T15:08:16Z

**Summary**: The rapid advancement of AI-generation models has enabled the creation of hyperrealistic imagery, posing ethical risks through widespread misinformation. Current deepfake detection methods, categorized as face specific detectors or general AI-generated detectors, lack transparency by framing detection as a classification task without explaining decisions. While several LLM-based approaches offer explainability, they suffer from coarse-grained analyses and dependency on labor-intensive annotations. This paper introduces RAIDX (Retrieval-Augmented Image Deepfake Detection and Explainability), a novel deepfake detection framework integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to enhance detection accuracy and decision explainability. Specifically, RAIDX leverages RAG to incorporate external knowledge for improved detection accuracy and employs GRPO to autonomously generate fine-grained textual explanations and saliency maps, eliminating the need for extensive manual annotations. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate RAIDX's effectiveness in identifying real or fake, and providing interpretable rationales in both textual descriptions and saliency maps, achieving state-of-the-art detection performance while advancing transparency in deepfake identification. RAIDX represents the first unified framework to synergize RAG and GRPO, addressing critical gaps in accuracy and explainability. Our code and models will be publicly available.

### Ordinal Characterization of Similarity Judgments
**Authors**: Jonathan D. Victor, Guillermo Aguilar, Suniyya A. Waraich

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T15:00:18Z

**Summary**: Characterizing judgments of similarity within a perceptual or semantic domain, and making inferences about the underlying structure of this domain from these judgments, has an increasingly important role in cognitive and systems neuroscience. We present a new framework for this purpose that makes limited assumptions about how perceptual distances are converted into similarity judgments. The approach starts from a dataset of empirical judgments of relative similarities: the fraction of times that a subject chooses one of two comparison stimuli to be more similar to a reference stimulus. These empirical judgments provide Bayesian estimates of underling choice probabilities. From these estimates, we derive indices that characterize the set of judgments in three ways: compatibility with a symmetric dis-similarity, compatibility with an ultrametric space, and compatibility with an additive tree. Each of the indices is derived from rank-order relationships among the choice probabilities that, as we show, are necessary and sufficient for local consistency with the three respective characteristics. We illustrate this approach with simulations and example psychophysical datasets of dis-similarity judgments in several visual domains and provide code that implements the analyses at https://github.com/jvlab/simrank.

### Think How to Think: Mitigating Overthinking with Autonomous Difficulty   Cognition in Large Reasoning Models
**Authors**: Yongjiang Liu, Haoxi Li, Xiaosong Ma, Jie Zhang, Song Guo

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T14:55:31Z

**Summary**: Recent Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) excel at complex reasoning tasks but often suffer from overthinking, generating overly long and redundant reasoning trajectories. To explore its essence, our empirical analysis reveals that LRMs are primarily limited to recognizing task properties (i.e., difficulty levels) like humans before solving the problem, leading to a one-size-fits-all reasoning process. Inspired by this, a pressing and natural question emerges: Can we explicitly bootstrap such ability to alleviate overthinking in LRMs? In this paper, we propose Think-How-to-Think (TH2T), a novel two-stage fine-tuning strategy that progressively inspires LRMs' difficulty cognition and redundancy cognition of LRMs. Specifically, we first inject difficulty hypnosis into output prefixes to guide the model toward adaptive reasoning depth, trained on a hybrid dataset mixing short and long reasoning paths. Then, we incorporate redundancy hypnosis, which supervises the intermediate reasoning steps to identify and eliminate unnecessary reasoning patterns. Experiments on 7B/14B/32B models demonstrate that TH2T significantly reduces inference costs by over 70% on easy tasks and 40% on hard tasks while maintaining performance stability. The resulting outputs exhibit clear signs of difficulty-aware capabilities and reduced redundancy (e.g., reflection and looping).

### From Sufficiency to Reflection: Reinforcement-Guided Thinking Quality in   Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning for LLMs
**Authors**: Jie He, Victor Gutiérrez-Basulto, Jeff Z. Pan

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T14:53:31Z

**Summary**: Reinforcement learning-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods enhance the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). However, most rely only on final-answer rewards, overlooking intermediate reasoning quality. This paper analyzes existing RAG reasoning models and identifies three main failure patterns: (1) information insufficiency, meaning the model fails to retrieve adequate support; (2) faulty reasoning, where logical or content-level flaws appear despite sufficient information; and (3) answer-reasoning inconsistency, where a valid reasoning chain leads to a mismatched final answer. We propose TIRESRAG-R1, a novel framework using a think-retrieve-reflect process and a multi-dimensional reward system to improve reasoning and stability. TIRESRAG-R1 introduces: (1) a sufficiency reward to encourage thorough retrieval; (2) a reasoning quality reward to assess the rationality and accuracy of the reasoning chain; and (3) a reflection reward to detect and revise errors. It also employs a difficulty-aware reweighting strategy and training sample filtering to boost performance on complex tasks. Experiments on four multi-hop QA datasets show that TIRESRAG-R1 outperforms prior RAG methods and generalizes well to single-hop tasks. The code and data are available at: https://github.com/probe2/TIRESRAG-R1.

### Causal Reflection with Language Models
**Authors**: Abi Aryan, Zac Liu

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T14:44:23Z

**Summary**: While LLMs exhibit impressive fluency and factual recall, they struggle with robust causal reasoning, often relying on spurious correlations and brittle patterns. Similarly, traditional Reinforcement Learning agents also lack causal understanding, optimizing for rewards without modeling why actions lead to outcomes. We introduce Causal Reflection, a framework that explicitly models causality as a dynamic function over state, action, time, and perturbation, enabling agents to reason about delayed and nonlinear effects. Additionally, we define a formal Reflect mechanism that identifies mismatches between predicted and observed outcomes and generates causal hypotheses to revise the agent's internal model. In this architecture, LLMs serve not as black-box reasoners, but as structured inference engines translating formal causal outputs into natural language explanations and counterfactuals. Our framework lays the theoretical groundwork for Causal Reflective agents that can adapt, self-correct, and communicate causal understanding in evolving environments.

### NACHOS: Neural Architecture Search for Hardware Constrained Early Exit   Neural Networks
**Authors**: Matteo Gambella, Jary Pomponi, Simone Scardapane, Manuel Roveri

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T14:41:42Z

**Summary**: Early Exit Neural Networks (EENNs) endow astandard Deep Neural Network (DNN) with Early Exit Classifiers (EECs), to provide predictions at intermediate points of the processing when enough confidence in classification is achieved. This leads to many benefits in terms of effectiveness and efficiency. Currently, the design of EENNs is carried out manually by experts, a complex and time-consuming task that requires accounting for many aspects, including the correct placement, the thresholding, and the computational overhead of the EECs. For this reason, the research is exploring the use of Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to automatize the design of EENNs. Currently, few comprehensive NAS solutions for EENNs have been proposed in the literature, and a fully automated, joint design strategy taking into consideration both the backbone and the EECs remains an open problem. To this end, this work presents Neural Architecture Search for Hardware Constrained Early Exit Neural Networks (NACHOS), the first NAS framework for the design of optimal EENNs satisfying constraints on the accuracy and the number of Multiply and Accumulate (MAC) operations performed by the EENNs at inference time. In particular, this provides the joint design of backbone and EECs to select a set of admissible (i.e., respecting the constraints) Pareto Optimal Solutions in terms of best tradeoff between the accuracy and number of MACs. The results show that the models designed by NACHOS are competitive with the state-of-the-art EENNs. Additionally, this work investigates the effectiveness of two novel regularization terms designed for the optimization of the auxiliary classifiers of the EENN

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T14:33:45Z

**Summary**: The dream to create AI assistants as capable and versatile as the fictional J.A.R.V.I.S from Iron Man has long captivated imaginations. With the evolution of (multi-modal) large language models ((M)LLMs), this dream is closer to reality, as (M)LLM-based Agents using computing devices (e.g., computers and mobile phones) by operating within the environments and interfaces (e.g., Graphical User Interface (GUI)) provided by operating systems (OS) to automate tasks have significantly advanced. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of these advanced agents, designated as OS Agents. We begin by elucidating the fundamentals of OS Agents, exploring their key components including the environment, observation space, and action space, and outlining essential capabilities such as understanding, planning, and grounding. We then examine methodologies for constructing OS Agents, focusing on domain-specific foundation models and agent frameworks. A detailed review of evaluation protocols and benchmarks highlights how OS Agents are assessed across diverse tasks. Finally, we discuss current challenges and identify promising directions for future research, including safety and privacy, personalization and self-evolution. This survey aims to consolidate the state of OS Agents research, providing insights to guide both academic inquiry and industrial development. An open-source GitHub repository is maintained as a dynamic resource to foster further innovation in this field. We present a 9-page version of our work, accepted by ACL 2025, to provide a concise overview to the domain.

### TRAIL: Joint Inference and Refinement of Knowledge Graphs with Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Xinkui Zhao, Haode Li, Yifan Zhang, Guanjie Cheng, Yueshen Xu

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T14:25:05Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have unlocked powerful reasoning and decision-making capabilities. However, their inherent dependence on static parametric memory fundamentally limits their adaptability, factual accuracy, and interpretability in knowledge-intensive scenarios. Knowledge graphs (KGs), as structured repositories of explicit relational knowledge, offer a promising approach for augmenting LLMs with external, interpretable memory. Nevertheless, most existing methods that combine LLMs with KGs treat reasoning and knowledge updating as separate processes, resulting in suboptimal utilization of new information and hindering real-time updates. In this work, we propose TRAIL: a novel, unified framework for Thinking, Reasoning, And Incremental Learning that couples joint inference and dynamic KG refinement with large language models. TRAIL enables LLM agents to iteratively explore, update, and refine knowledge graphs during the reasoning process, employing a confidence-driven mechanism for the generation, validation, and pruning of new facts. This plug-and-play architecture facilitates seamless integration with various LLMs, supporting continual adaptation without the need for retraining. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that TRAIL outperforms existing KG-augmented and retrieval-augmented LLM baselines by 3% to 13%. More importantly, these results represent a significant step toward developing adaptive, memory-augmented language models capable of continual learning and reliable, transparent reasoning.

### DSOcc: Leveraging Depth Awareness and Semantic Aid to Boost Camera-Based   3D Semantic Occupancy Prediction
**Authors**: Naiyu Fang, Zheyuan Zhou, Kang Wang, Ruibo Li, Lemiao Qiu, Shuyou Zhang, Zhe Wang, Guosheng Lin

**Updated**: 2025-08-07T01:25:26Z

**Summary**: Camera-based 3D semantic occupancy prediction offers an efficient and cost-effective solution for perceiving surrounding scenes in autonomous driving. However, existing works rely on explicit occupancy state inference, leading to numerous incorrect feature assignments, and insufficient samples restrict the learning of occupancy class inference. To address these challenges, we propose leveraging Depth awareness and Semantic aid to boost camera-based 3D semantic Occupancy prediction (DSOcc). We jointly perform occupancy state and occupancy class inference, where soft occupancy confidence is calculated by non-learning method and multiplied with image features to make voxels aware of depth, enabling adaptive implicit occupancy state inference. Instead of enhancing feature learning, we directly utilize well-trained image semantic segmentation and fuse multiple frames with their occupancy probabilities to aid occupancy class inference, thereby enhancing robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that DSOcc achieves state-of-the-art performance on the SemanticKITTI dataset among camera-based methods.

### CARD: Cache-Assisted Parallel Speculative Decoding for Efficient Large   Language Model Inference
**Authors**: Enyu Zhou, Kai Sheng, Hao Chen, Xin He

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T14:02:10Z

**Summary**: Speculative decoding (SD), where an extra draft model first provides multiple draft tokens and the original target model then verifies these tokens in parallel, has shown great power for LLM inference acceleration. However, existing SD methods must adhere to the 'draft-then-verify' paradigm, which forces drafting and verification processes to execute sequentially during SD, resulting in inefficient inference performance and limiting the size of the draft model. Furthermore, once a single token in the candidate sequence is rejected during the drafting process, all subsequent candidate tokens must be discarded, leading to inefficient drafting. To address these challenges, we propose a cache-based parallel speculative decoding framework employing a 'query-and-correct' paradigm. Specifically, CARD decouples drafting and verification: the draft model generates candidate tokens to populate a shared cache, while the target model concurrently rectifies the draft model's generation direction. This effectively enables the target model to perform inference at speed approaching that of the draft model. Our approach achieves up to 4.83 speedup over vanilla decoding without requiring fine-tuning of either the draft or target models. Our code is available at https://github.com/hunzhizi/CARD.

### From "Aha Moments" to Controllable Thinking: Toward Meta-Cognitive   Reasoning in Large Reasoning Models via Decoupled Reasoning and Control
**Authors**: Rui Ha, Chaozhuo Li, Rui Pu, Sen Su

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T13:59:17Z

**Summary**: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated a latent capacity for complex reasoning by spontaneously exhibiting cognitive behaviors such as step-by-step reasoning, reflection, and backtracking, commonly referred to as "Aha Moments". However, such emergent behaviors remain unregulated and uncontrolled, often resulting in overthinking, where the model continues generating redundant reasoning content even after reaching reliable conclusions. This leads to excessive computational costs and increased latency, limiting the practical deployment of LRMs. The root cause lies in the absence of intrinsic regulatory mechanisms, as current models are unable to monitor and adaptively manage their reasoning process to determine when to continue, backtrack, or terminate. To address this issue, we propose the Meta-cognitive Reasoning Framework (MERA), which explicitly decouples the thinking process into distinct reasoning and control components, thereby enabling the independent optimization of control strategies. Specifically, MERA incorporates a takeover-based data construction mechanism that identifies critical decision points during reasoning and delegates the creation of control signals to auxiliary LLMs, thereby enabling the construction of high-quality reasoning-control data. Additionally, a structured reasoning-control separation is implemented via supervised fine-tuning, enabling the model to generate explicit traces and acquire initial meta-cognitive control capabilities. Finally, MERA employs Control-Segment Policy Optimization (CSPO), which combines segment-wise Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a control-masking mechanism to optimize control behavior learning while minimizing interference from irrelevant content. Experiments on various reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that models trained with MERA enhance both reasoning efficiency and accuracy.

### Boosting Visual Knowledge-Intensive Training for LVLMs Through   Causality-Driven Visual Object Completion
**Authors**: Qingguo Hu, Ante Wang, Jia Song, Delai Qiu, Qingsong Liu, Jinsong Su

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T13:54:49Z

**Summary**: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have experienced significant advancements in recent years. However, their performance still falls short in tasks requiring deep visual perception, such as identifying subtle differences between images. A potential cause is the scarcity of visual knowledge in popular instruction-tuning corpora, resulting in inadequate visual perception and reasoning capabilities. To address this challenge, we introduce a self-improvement framework grounded in a novel visual knowledge-intensive task, \underline{C}ausality-driven \underline{V}isual object \underline{C}ompletion (CVC). This task requires LVLMs to infer the masked object in an image based on its \textit{causal} relationships with the other visible information. We first obtain rich examples cheaply through our automated instance construction pipeline, without relying on sophisticated LVLMs (\textit{e.g.}, GPT-4V) or human assistance. Then, LVLMs effectively self-improve through trial and error learning using these created instances. Our experiments demonstrate substantial gains across four challenging specialized tasks and four widely-used comprehensive benchmarks. Especially on specialized tasks, our method achieves an average improvement of 5.4\% and 4.0\% compared to the corresponding baselines when utilizing LLaVA-1.5-7B and LLaVA-1.5-13B, respectively. The code is available at https://github.com/XMUDeepLIT/CVC.

### Automatic LLM Red Teaming
**Authors**: Roman Belaire, Arunesh Sinha, Pradeep Varakantham

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T13:52:00Z

**Summary**: Red teaming is critical for identifying vulnerabilities and building trust in current LLMs. However, current automated methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on brittle prompt templates or single-turn attacks, failing to capture the complex, interactive nature of real-world adversarial dialogues. We propose a novel paradigm: training an AI to strategically `break' another AI. By formalizing red teaming as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and employing a hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework, we effectively address the inherent sparse reward and long-horizon challenges. Our generative agent learns coherent, multi-turn attack strategies through a fine-grained, token-level harm reward, enabling it to uncover subtle vulnerabilities missed by existing baselines. This approach sets a new state-of-the-art, fundamentally reframing LLM red teaming as a dynamic, trajectory-based process (rather than a one-step test) essential for robust AI deployment.

### Large Language Models Versus Static Code Analysis Tools: A Systematic   Benchmark for Vulnerability Detection
**Authors**: Damian Gnieciak, Tomasz Szandala

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T13:48:38Z

**Summary**: Modern software relies on a multitude of automated testing and quality assurance tools to prevent errors, bugs and potential vulnerabilities. This study sets out to provide a head-to-head, quantitative and qualitative evaluation of six automated approaches: three industry-standard rule-based static code-analysis tools (SonarQube, CodeQL and Snyk Code) and three state-of-the-art large language models hosted on the GitHub Models platform (GPT-4.1, Mistral Large and DeepSeek V3). Using a curated suite of ten real-world C# projects that embed 63 vulnerabilities across common categories such as SQL injection, hard-coded secrets and outdated dependencies, we measure classical detection accuracy (precision, recall, F-score), analysis latency, and the developer effort required to vet true positives. The language-based scanners achieve higher mean F-1 scores,0.797, 0.753 and 0.750, than their static counterparts, which score 0.260, 0.386 and 0.546, respectively. LLMs' advantage originates from superior recall, confirming an ability to reason across broader code contexts. However, this benefit comes with substantial trade-offs: DeepSeek V3 exhibits the highest false-positive ratio, all language models mislocate issues at line-or-column granularity due to tokenisation artefacts. Overall, language models successfully rival traditional static analysers in finding real vulnerabilities. Still, their noisier output and imprecise localisation limit their standalone use in safety-critical audits. We therefore recommend a hybrid pipeline: employ language models early in development for broad, context-aware triage, while reserving deterministic rule-based scanners for high-assurance verification. The open benchmark and JSON-based result harness released with this paper lay a foundation for reproducible, practitioner-centric research into next-generation automated code security.

### Automatically Interpreting Millions of Features in Large Language Models
**Authors**: Gonçalo Paulo, Alex Mallen, Caden Juang, Nora Belrose

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T13:47:10Z

**Summary**: While the activations of neurons in deep neural networks usually do not have a simple human-understandable interpretation, sparse autoencoders (SAEs) can be used to transform these activations into a higher-dimensional latent space which may be more easily interpretable. However, these SAEs can have millions of distinct latent features, making it infeasible for humans to manually interpret each one. In this work, we build an open-source automated pipeline to generate and evaluate natural language explanations for SAE features using LLMs. We test our framework on SAEs of varying sizes, activation functions, and losses, trained on two different open-weight LLMs. We introduce five new techniques to score the quality of explanations that are cheaper to run than the previous state of the art. One of these techniques, intervention scoring, evaluates the interpretability of the effects of intervening on a feature, which we find explains features that are not recalled by existing methods. We propose guidelines for generating better explanations that remain valid for a broader set of activating contexts, and discuss pitfalls with existing scoring techniques. We use our explanations to measure the semantic similarity of independently trained SAEs, and find that SAEs trained on nearby layers of the residual stream are highly similar. Our large-scale analysis confirms that SAE latents are indeed much more interpretable than neurons, even when neurons are sparsified using top-$k$ postprocessing. Our code is available at https://github.com/EleutherAI/sae-auto-interp, and our explanations are available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/EleutherAI/auto_interp_explanations.

### Inside-Out: Hidden Factual Knowledge in LLMs
**Authors**: Zorik Gekhman, Eyal Ben David, Hadas Orgad, Eran Ofek, Yonatan Belinkov, Idan Szpektor, Jonathan Herzig, Roi Reichart

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T13:42:41Z

**Summary**: This work presents a framework for assessing whether large language models (LLMs) encode more factual knowledge in their parameters than what they express in their outputs. While a few studies hint at this possibility, none has clearly defined or demonstrated this phenomenon. We first propose a formal definition of knowledge, quantifying it for a given question as the fraction of correct-incorrect answer pairs where the correct one is ranked higher. This gives rise to external and internal knowledge, depending on the information used to score individual answer candidates: either the model's observable token-level probabilities or its intermediate computations. Hidden knowledge arises when internal knowledge exceeds external knowledge. We then present a case study, applying this framework to three popular open-weights LLMs in a closed-book QA setup. Our results indicate that: (1) LLMs consistently encode more factual knowledge internally than what they express externally, with an average relative gap of 40%. (2) Surprisingly, some knowledge is so deeply hidden that a model can internally know an answer perfectly, yet fail to generate it even once, despite large-scale repeated sampling of 1,000 answers. This reveals fundamental limitations in the generation capabilities of LLMs, which (3) put a practical constraint on scaling test-time compute via repeated answer sampling in closed-book QA: significant performance improvements remain inaccessible because some answers are practically never sampled, yet if they were, we would be guaranteed to rank them first.

### StepFun-Formalizer: Unlocking the Autoformalization Potential of LLMs   through Knowledge-Reasoning Fusion
**Authors**: Yutong Wu, Di Huang, Ruosi Wan, Yue Peng, Shijie Shang, Chenrui Cao, Lei Qi, Rui Zhang, Zidong Du, Jie Yan, Xing Hu

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T13:28:22Z

**Summary**: Autoformalization aims to translate natural-language mathematical statements into a formal language. While LLMs have accelerated progress in this area, existing methods still suffer from low accuracy. We identify two key abilities for effective autoformalization: comprehensive mastery of formal-language domain knowledge, and reasoning capability of natural language problem understanding and informal-formal alignment. Without the former, a model cannot identify the correct formal objects; without the latter, it struggles to interpret real-world contexts and map them precisely into formal expressions. To address these gaps, we introduce ThinkingF, a data synthesis and training pipeline that improves both abilities. First, we construct two datasets: one by distilling and selecting large-scale examples rich in formal knowledge, and another by generating informal-to-formal reasoning trajectories guided by expert-designed templates. We then apply SFT and RLVR with these datasets to further fuse and refine the two abilities. The resulting 7B and 32B models exhibit both comprehensive formal knowledge and strong informal-to-formal reasoning. Notably, StepFun-Formalizer-32B achieves SOTA BEq@1 scores of 40.5% on FormalMATH-Lite and 26.7% on ProverBench, surpassing all prior general-purpose and specialized models.

### Prompt Obfuscation for Large Language Models
**Authors**: David Pape, Sina Mavali, Thorsten Eisenhofer, Lea Schönherr

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T13:24:09Z

**Summary**: System prompts that include detailed instructions to describe the task performed by the underlying LLM can easily transform foundation models into tools and services with minimal overhead. They are often considered intellectual property, similar to the code of a software product, because of their crucial impact on the utility. However, extracting system prompts is easily possible. As of today, there is no effective countermeasure to prevent the stealing of system prompts, and all safeguarding efforts could be evaded. In this work, we propose an alternative to conventional system prompts. We introduce prompt obfuscation to prevent the extraction of the system prompt with little overhead. The core idea is to find a representation of the original system prompt that leads to the same functionality, while the obfuscated system prompt does not contain any information that allows conclusions to be drawn about the original system prompt. We evaluate our approach by comparing our obfuscated prompt output with the output of the original prompt, using eight distinct metrics to measure the lexical, character-level, and semantic similarity. We show that the obfuscated version is constantly on par with the original one. We further perform three different deobfuscation attacks with varying attacker knowledge--covering both black-box and white-box conditions--and show that in realistic attack scenarios an attacker is unable to extract meaningful information. Overall, we demonstrate that prompt obfuscation is an effective mechanism to safeguard the intellectual property of a system prompt while maintaining the same utility as the original prompt.

### Cognitive Effort in the Two-Step Task: An Active Inference   Drift-Diffusion Model Approach
**Authors**: Alvaro Garrido Perez, Viktor Lemoine, Amrapali Pednekar, Yara Khaluf, Pieter Simoens

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T13:22:15Z

**Summary**: High-level theories rooted in the Bayesian Brain Hypothesis often frame cognitive effort as the cost of resolving the conflict between habits and optimal policies. In parallel, evidence accumulator models (EAMs) provide a mechanistic account of how effort arises from competition between the subjective values of available options. Although EAMs have been combined with frameworks like Reinforcement Learning to bridge the gap between high-level theories and process-level mechanisms, relatively less attention has been paid to their implications for a unified notion of cognitive effort. Here, we combine Active Inference (AIF) with the Drift-Diffusion Model (DDM) to investigate whether the resulting AIF-DDM can simultaneously account for effort arising from both habit violation and value discriminability. To our knowledge, this is the first time AIF has been combined with an EAM. We tested the AIF-DDM on a behavioral dataset from the two-step task and compared its predictions to an information-theoretic definition of cognitive effort based on AIF. The model's predictions successfully accounted for second-stage reaction times but failed to capture the dynamics of the first stage. We argue the latter discrepancy likely stems from the experimental design rather than a fundamental flaw in the model's assumptions about cognitive effort. Accordingly, we propose several modifications of the two-step task to better measure and isolate cognitive effort. Finally, we found that integrating the DDM significantly improved parameter recovery, which could help future studies to obtain more reliable parameter estimates.

### GenEDA: Towards Generative Netlist Functional Reasoning via Cross-Modal   Circuit Encoder-Decoder Alignment
**Authors**: Wenji Fang, Jing Wang, Yao Lu, Shang Liu, Zhiyao Xie

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T13:21:11Z

**Summary**: The success of foundation AI has motivated the research of circuit foundation models, which are customized to assist the integrated circuit (IC) design process. However, existing pre-trained circuit foundation models are typically limited to standalone encoders for predictive tasks or decoders for generative tasks. These two model types are developed independently, operate on different circuit modalities, and reside in separate latent spaces. This restricts their ability to complement each other for more advanced capabilities. In this work, we present GenEDA, the first framework that cross-modally aligns circuit encoders with decoders within a shared latent space. GenEDA bridges the gap between graph-based circuit representation learning and text-based large language models (LLMs), enabling communication between their respective latent spaces. To achieve the alignment, we propose two paradigms to support both open-source trainable LLMs and commercial frozen LLMs. We leverage this aligned architecture to develop the first generative foundation model for netlists, unleashing LLMs' generative reasoning capability on the low-level and bit-blasted netlists. GenEDA enables three unprecedented generative netlist functional reasoning tasks, where it reversely generates high-level functionalities such as specifications and RTL code from low-level netlists. These tasks move beyond traditional gate function classification to direct generation of full-circuit functionality. Experiments demonstrate that GenEDA significantly boosts advanced LLMs' (e.g., GPT and DeepSeek series) performance in all tasks.

### \textsc{SimInstruct}: A Responsible Tool for Collecting Scaffolding   Dialogues Between Experts and LLM-Simulated Novices
**Authors**: Si Chen, Izzy Molnar, Ting Hua, Peiyu Li, Le Huy Khiem, G. Alex Ambrose, Jim Lang, Ronald Metoyer, Nitesh V. Chawla

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T13:16:10Z

**Summary**: High-quality, multi-turn instructional dialogues between novices and experts are essential for developing AI systems that support teaching, learning, and decision-making. These dialogues often involve scaffolding -- the process by which an expert supports a novice's thinking through questions, feedback, and step-by-step guidance. However, such data are scarce due to privacy concerns in recording and the vulnerability inherent in help-seeking. We present SimInstruct, a scalable, expert-in-the-loop tool for collecting scaffolding dialogues. Using teaching development coaching as an example domain, SimInstruct simulates novice instructors via LLMs, varying their teaching challenges and LLM's persona traits, while human experts provide multi-turn feedback, reasoning, and instructional support. This design enables the creation of realistic, pedagogically rich dialogues without requiring real novice participants. Our results reveal that persona traits, such as extroversion and introversion, meaningfully influence how experts engage. Compared to real mentoring recordings, SimInstruct dialogues demonstrate comparable pedagogical relevance and cognitive depth. Experts also reported the process as engaging and reflective, improving both data quality and their own professional insight. We further fine-tuned a LLaMA model to be an expert model using the augmented dataset, which outperformed GPT-4o in instructional quality. Our analysis highlights GPT-4o's limitations in weak reflective questioning, overuse of generic praise, a condescending tone, and a tendency to overwhelm novices with excessive suggestions.

### Evaluating, Synthesizing, and Enhancing for Customer Support   Conversation
**Authors**: Jie Zhu, Huaixia Dou, Junhui Li, Lifan Guo, Feng Chen, Chi Zhang, Fang Kong

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T13:11:17Z

**Summary**: Effective customer support requires not only accurate problem solving but also structured and empathetic communication aligned with professional standards. However, existing dialogue datasets often lack strategic guidance, and real-world service data is difficult to access and annotate. To address this, we introduce the task of Customer Support Conversation (CSC), aimed at training customer service agents to respond using well-defined support strategies. We propose a structured CSC framework grounded in COPC guidelines, defining five conversational stages and twelve strategies to guide high-quality interactions. Based on this, we construct CSConv, an evaluation dataset of 1,855 real-world customer-agent conversations rewritten using LLMs to reflect deliberate strategy use, and annotated accordingly. Additionally, we develop a role-playing approach that simulates strategy-rich conversations using LLM-powered roles aligned with the CSC framework, resulting in the training dataset RoleCS. Experiments show that fine-tuning strong LLMs on RoleCS significantly improves their ability to generate high-quality, strategy-aligned responses on CSConv. Human evaluations further confirm gains in problem resolution. All code and data will be made publicly available at https://github.com/aliyun/qwen-dianjin.

### Efficient Inter-Task Attention for Multitask Transformer Models
**Authors**: Christian Bohn, Thomas Kurbiel, Klaus Friedrichs, Hasan Tercan, Tobias Meisen

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T13:09:02Z

**Summary**: In both Computer Vision and the wider Deep Learning field, the Transformer architecture is well-established as state-of-the-art for many applications. For Multitask Learning, however, where there may be many more queries necessary compared to single-task models, its Multi-Head-Attention often approaches the limits of what is computationally feasible considering practical hardware limitations. This is due to the fact that the size of the attention matrix scales quadratically with the number of tasks (assuming roughly equal numbers of queries for all tasks). As a solution, we propose our novel Deformable Inter-Task Self-Attention for Multitask models that enables the much more efficient aggregation of information across the feature maps from different tasks. In our experiments on the NYUD-v2 and PASCAL-Context datasets, we demonstrate an order-of-magnitude reduction in both FLOPs count and inference latency. At the same time, we also achieve substantial improvements by up to 7.4% in the individual tasks' prediction quality metrics.

### Think Before You Segment: An Object-aware Reasoning Agent for Referring   Audio-Visual Segmentation
**Authors**: Jinxing Zhou, Yanghao Zhou, Mingfei Han, Tong Wang, Xiaojun Chang, Hisham Cholakkal, Rao Muhammad Anwer

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T13:05:09Z

**Summary**: Referring Audio-Visual Segmentation (Ref-AVS) aims to segment target objects in audible videos based on given reference expressions. Prior works typically rely on learning latent embeddings via multimodal fusion to prompt a tunable SAM/SAM2 decoder for segmentation, which requires strong pixel-level supervision and lacks interpretability. From a novel perspective of explicit reference understanding, we propose TGS-Agent, which decomposes the task into a Think-Ground-Segment process, mimicking the human reasoning procedure by first identifying the referred object through multimodal analysis, followed by coarse-grained grounding and precise segmentation. To this end, we first propose Ref-Thinker, a multimodal language model capable of reasoning over textual, visual, and auditory cues. We construct an instruction-tuning dataset with explicit object-aware think-answer chains for Ref-Thinker fine-tuning. The object description inferred by Ref-Thinker is used as an explicit prompt for Grounding-DINO and SAM2, which perform grounding and segmentation without relying on pixel-level supervision. Additionally, we introduce R\textsuperscript{2}-AVSBench, a new benchmark with linguistically diverse and reasoning-intensive references for better evaluating model generalization. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on both standard Ref-AVSBench and proposed R\textsuperscript{2}-AVSBench. Code will be available at https://github.com/jasongief/TGS-Agent.

### RTLCoder: Outperforming GPT-3.5 in Design RTL Generation with Our   Open-Source Dataset and Lightweight Solution
**Authors**: Shang Liu, Wenji Fang, Yao Lu, Qijun Zhang, Hongce Zhang, Zhiyao Xie

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T13:02:31Z

**Summary**: The automatic generation of RTL code (e.g., Verilog) using natural language instructions and large language models (LLMs) has attracted significant research interest recently. However, most existing approaches heavily rely on commercial LLMs such as ChatGPT, while open-source LLMs tailored for this specific design generation task exhibit notably inferior performance. The absence of high-quality open-source solutions restricts the flexibility and data privacy of this emerging technique. In this study, we present a new customized LLM solution with a modest parameter count of only 7B, achieving better performance than GPT-3.5 on all representative benchmarks for RTL code generation. Especially, it outperforms GPT-4 in VerilogEval Machine benchmark. This remarkable balance between accuracy and efficiency is made possible by leveraging our new RTL code dataset and a customized LLM algorithm, both of which have been made fully open-source.

### Beyond Pixels: Exploring DOM Downsampling for LLM-Based Web Agents
**Authors**: Thassilo M. Schiepanski, Nicholas Piël

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T12:56:54Z

**Summary**: Frontier LLMs only recently enabled serviceable, autonomous web agents. At that, a model poses as an instantaneous domain model backend. Ought to suggest interaction, it is consulted with a web-based task and respective application state. The key problem lies in application state serialisation $\unicode{x2013}$ referred to as snapshot. State-of-the-art web agents are premised on grounded GUI snapshots, i.e., screenshots enhanced with visual cues. Not least to resemble human perception, but for images representing relatively cheap means of model input. LLM vision still lag behind code interpretation capabilities. DOM snapshots, which structurally resemble HTML, impose a desired alternative. Vast model input token size, however, disables reliable implementation with web agents to date.   We propose D2Snap, a first-of-its-kind DOM downsampling algorithm. Based on a GPT-4o backend, we evaluate D2Snap on tasks sampled from the Online-Mind2Web dataset. The success rate of D2Snap-downsampled DOM snapshots (67%) matches a grounded GUI snapshot baseline (65%) $\unicode{x2013}$ within the same input token order of magnitude (1e3). Our best evaluated configurations $\unicode{x2013}$ one token order above, but within the model's context window $\unicode{x2013}$ outperform this baseline by 8%. Our evaluation, moreover, yields that DOM-inherent hierarchy embodies a strong UI feature for LLMs.

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T12:55:44Z

**Summary**: As our understanding of autism and ableism continues to increase, so does our understanding of ableist language towards autistic people. Such language poses a significant challenge in NLP research due to its subtle and context-dependent nature. Yet, detecting anti-autistic ableist language remains underexplored, with existing NLP tools often failing to capture its nuanced expressions. We present AUTALIC, the first benchmark dataset dedicated to the detection of anti-autistic ableist language in context, addressing a significant gap in the field. The dataset comprises 2,400 autism-related sentences collected from Reddit, accompanied by surrounding context, and is annotated by trained experts with backgrounds in neurodiversity. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals that current language models, including state-of-the-art LLMs, struggle to reliably identify anti-autistic ableism and align with human judgments, underscoring their limitations in this domain. We publicly release AUTALIC along with the individual annotations which serve as a valuable resource to researchers working on ableism, neurodiversity, and also studying disagreements in annotation tasks. This dataset serves as a crucial step towards developing more inclusive and context-aware NLP systems that better reflect diverse perspectives.

**Summary**: Reconstructing the longitudinal profile of extensive air showers, generated from the interaction of cosmic rays in the Earth's atmosphere, is crucial to understanding their mass composition, which in turn provides valuable insight on their possible sources of origin. Dense radio antenna arrays such as the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) telescope as well as the upcoming Square Kilometre Array Observatory (SKAO) are ideal instruments to explore the potential of air shower profile reconstruction, as their high antenna density allows cosmic ray observations with unprecedented accuracy. However, current analysis approaches can only recover $X_\mathrm{max}$, the atmospheric depth at shower maximum, and heavily rely on computationally expensive simulations. As such, it is ever more crucial to develop new analysis approaches that can perform a full air shower profile reconstruction efficiently.   In this work, we develop a novel framework to reconstruct the longitudinal profile of air showers using measurements from radio detectors with Information Field Theory (IFT), a state-of-the-art reconstruction framework based on Bayesian inference. Through IFT, we are able to exploit all available information in the signal (amplitude, phase, and pulse shape) at each antenna position simultaneously and explicitly utilise models that are motivated through our current understanding of air shower physics. We verify our framework on simulated datasets prepared for LOFAR, showcasing that we can not only reconstruct the air shower profile with uncertainties in each atmospheric depth bin but also recover the reconstructed trace at each antenna position. Our framework demonstrates that radio measurements with dense antenna layouts such as LOFAR and SKAO have the capability to go beyond reconstruction of $X_\mathrm{max}$ and will thus aid in our understanding of the mass composition of cosmic rays.

### What Lives? A meta-analysis of diverse opinions on the definition of   life
**Authors**: Reed Bender, Karina Kofman, Blaise Agüera y Arcas, Michael Levin

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T12:47:41Z

**Summary**: The question of "what is life?" has challenged scientists and philosophers for centuries, producing an array of definitions that reflect both the mystery of its emergence and the diversity of disciplinary perspectives brought to bear on the question. Despite significant progress in our understanding of biological systems, psychology, computation, and information theory, no single definition for life has yet achieved universal acceptance. This challenge becomes increasingly urgent as advances in synthetic biology, artificial intelligence, and astrobiology challenge our traditional conceptions of what it means to be alive. We undertook a methodological approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) to analyze a set of definitions of life provided by a curated set of cross-disciplinary experts. We used a novel pairwise correlation analysis to map the definitions into distinct feature vectors, followed by agglomerative clustering, intra-cluster semantic analysis, and t-SNE projection to reveal underlying conceptual archetypes. This methodology revealed a continuous landscape of the themes relating to the definition of life, suggesting that what has historically been approached as a binary taxonomic problem should be instead conceived as differentiated perspectives within a unified conceptual latent space. We offer a new methodological bridge between reductionist and holistic approaches to fundamental questions in science and philosophy, demonstrating how computational semantic analysis can reveal conceptual patterns across disciplinary boundaries, and opening similar pathways for addressing other contested definitional territories across the sciences.

### FlexQ: Efficient Post-training INT6 Quantization for LLM Serving via   Algorithm-System Co-Design
**Authors**: Hao Zhang, Aining Jia, Weifeng Bu, Yushu Cai, Kai Sheng, Hao Chen, Xin He

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T12:47:05Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional performance but entail significant memory and computational costs, restricting their practical deployment. While existing INT4/INT8 quantization reduces these costs, they often degrade accuracy or lack optimal efficiency. INT6 quantization offers a superior trade-off between model accuracy and inference efficiency, but lacks hardware support in modern GPUs, forcing emulation via higher-precision arithmetic units that limit acceleration.   In this paper, we propose FlexQ, a novel post-training INT6 quantization framework combining algorithmic innovation with system-level optimizations. FlexQ employs uniform 6-bit weight quantization across all layers, with adaptive retention of 8-bit activations in layers identified through layer-wise sensitivity analysis. To maximize hardware efficiency, we develop a specialized high-performance GPU kernel supporting matrix multiplication for W6A6 and W6A8 representations via Binary Tensor Core (BTC) equivalents, effectively bypassing the lack of native INT6 tensor cores. Evaluations on LLaMA models show FlexQ maintains near-FP16 accuracy, with perplexity increases of no more than 0.05. The proposed kernel achieves an average 1.39$\times$ speedup over ABQ-LLM on LLaMA-2-70B linear layers. End-to-end, FlexQ delivers 1.33$\times$ inference acceleration and 1.21$\times$ memory savings over SmoothQuant. Code is released at https://github.com/FlyFoxPlayer/FlexQ.

### Why are LLMs' abilities emergent?
**Authors**: Vladimír Havlík

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T12:43:04Z

**Summary**: The remarkable success of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generative tasks has raised fundamental questions about the nature of their acquired capabilities, which often appear to emerge unexpectedly without explicit training. This paper examines the emergent properties of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) through both theoretical analysis and empirical observation, addressing the epistemological challenge of "creation without understanding" that characterises contemporary AI development. We explore how the neural approach's reliance on nonlinear, stochastic processes fundamentally differs from symbolic computational paradigms, creating systems whose macro-level behaviours cannot be analytically derived from micro-level neuron activities. Through analysis of scaling laws, grokking phenomena, and phase transitions in model capabilities, I demonstrate that emergent abilities arise from the complex dynamics of highly sensitive nonlinear systems rather than simply from parameter scaling alone. My investigation reveals that current debates over metrics, pre-training loss thresholds, and in-context learning miss the fundamental ontological nature of emergence in DNNs. I argue that these systems exhibit genuine emergent properties analogous to those found in other complex natural phenomena, where systemic capabilities emerge from cooperative interactions among simple components without being reducible to their individual behaviours. The paper concludes that understanding LLM capabilities requires recognising DNNs as a new domain of complex dynamical systems governed by universal principles of emergence, similar to those operating in physics, chemistry, and biology. This perspective shifts the focus from purely phenomenological definitions of emergence to understanding the internal dynamic transformations that enable these systems to acquire capabilities that transcend their individual components.

### Industrial LLM-based Code Optimization under Regulation: A   Mixture-of-Agents Approach
**Authors**: Mari Ashiga, Vardan Voskanyan, Fateme Dinmohammadi, Jingzhi Gong, Paul Brookes, Matthew Truscott, Rafail Giavrimis, Mike Basios, Leslie Kanthan, Wei Jie

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T12:41:21Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) for code optimization have enabled industrial platforms to automate software performance engineering at unprecedented scale and speed. Yet, organizations in regulated industries face strict constraints on which LLMs they can use - many cannot utilize commercial models due to data privacy regulations and compliance requirements, creating a significant challenge for achieving high-quality code optimization while maintaining cost-effectiveness. We address this by implementing a Mixture-of-Agents (MoA) approach that directly synthesizes code from multiple specialized LLMs, comparing it against TurinTech AI's vanilla Genetic Algorithm (GA)-based ensemble system and individual LLM optimizers using real-world industrial codebases. Our key contributions include: (1) First MoA application to industrial code optimization using real-world codebases; (2) Empirical evidence that MoA excels with open-source models, achieving 14.3% to 22.2% cost savings and 28.6% to 32.2% faster optimization times for regulated environments; (3) Deployment guidelines demonstrating GA's advantage with commercial models while both ensembles outperform individual LLMs; and (4) Real-world validation across 50 code snippets and seven LLM combinations, generating over 8,700 variants, addresses gaps in industrial LLM ensemble evaluation. This provides actionable guidance for organizations balancing regulatory compliance with optimization performance in production environments.

### Improving Crash Data Quality with Large Language Models: Evidence from   Secondary Crash Narratives in Kentucky
**Authors**: Xu Zhang, Mei Chen

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T12:41:18Z

**Summary**: This study evaluates advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques to enhance crash data quality by mining crash narratives, using secondary crash identification in Kentucky as a case study. Drawing from 16,656 manually reviewed narratives from 2015-2022, with 3,803 confirmed secondary crashes, we compare three model classes: zero-shot open-source large language models (LLMs) (LLaMA3:70B, DeepSeek-R1:70B, Qwen3:32B, Gemma3:27B); fine-tuned transformers (BERT, DistilBERT, RoBERTa, XLNet, Longformer); and traditional logistic regression as baseline. Models were calibrated on 2015-2021 data and tested on 1,771 narratives from 2022. Fine-tuned transformers achieved superior performance, with RoBERTa yielding the highest F1-score (0.90) and accuracy (95%). Zero-shot LLaMA3:70B reached a comparable F1 of 0.86 but required 139 minutes of inference; the logistic baseline lagged well behind (F1:0.66). LLMs excelled in recall for some variants (e.g., GEMMA3:27B at 0.94) but incurred high computational costs (up to 723 minutes for DeepSeek-R1:70B), while fine-tuned models processed the test set in seconds after brief training. Further analysis indicated that mid-sized LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek-R1:32B) can rival larger counterparts in performance while reducing runtime, suggesting opportunities for optimized deployments. Results highlight trade-offs between accuracy, efficiency, and data requirements, with fine-tuned transformer models balancing precision and recall effectively on Kentucky data. Practical deployment considerations emphasize privacy-preserving local deployment, ensemble approaches for improved accuracy, and incremental processing for scalability, providing a replicable scheme for enhancing crash-data quality with advanced NLP.

### Generative Flexible Latent Structure Regression (GFLSR) model
**Authors**: Clara Grazian, Qian Jin, Pierre Lafaye De Micheaux

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T12:37:45Z

**Summary**: Latent structure methods, specifically linear continuous latent structure methods, are a type of fundamental statistical learning strategy. They are widely used for dimension reduction, regression and prediction, in the fields of chemometrics, economics, social science and etc. However, due to the lack of model inference, generative form, and unidentifiable parameters, most of these methods are always used as an algorithm, instead of a model. This paper proposed a Generative Flexible Latent Structure Regression (GFLSR) model structure to address this problem. Moreover, we show that most linear continuous latent variable methods can be represented under the proposed framework. The recursive structure allows potential model inference and residual analysis. Then, the traditional Partial Least Squares (PLS) is focused; we show that the PLS can be specialised in the proposed model structure, named Generative-PLS. With a model structure, we analyse the convergence of the parameters and the latent variables. Under additional distribution assumptions, we show that the proposed model structure can lead to model inference without solving the probabilistic model. Additionally, we proposed a novel bootstrap algorithm that enables uncertainty on parameters and on prediction for new datasets. A simulation study and a Real-world dataset are used to verify the proposed Generative-PLS model structure. Although the traditional PLS is a special case, this proposed GFLSRM structure leads to a potential inference structure for all the linear continuous latent variable methods.

### Streaming Generated Gaussian Process Experts for Online Learning and   Control
**Authors**: Zewen Yang, Dongfa Zhang, Xiaobing Dai, Fengyi Yu, Chi Zhang, Bingkun Huang, Hamid Sadeghian, Sami Haddadin

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T12:22:27Z

**Summary**: Gaussian Processes (GPs), as a nonparametric learning method, offer flexible modeling capabilities and calibrated uncertainty quantification for function approximations. Additionally, GPs support online learning by efficiently incorporating new data with polynomial-time computation, making them well-suited for safety-critical dynamical systems that require rapid adaptation. However, the inference and online updates of exact GPs, when processing streaming data, incur cubic computation time and quadratic storage memory complexity, limiting their scalability to large datasets in real-time settings. In this paper, we propose a streaming kernel-induced progressively generated expert framework of Gaussian processes (SkyGP) that addresses both computational and memory constraints by maintaining a bounded set of experts, while inheriting the learning performance guarantees from exact Gaussian processes. Furthermore, two SkyGP variants are introduced, each tailored to a specific objective, either maximizing prediction accuracy (SkyGP-Dense) or improving computational efficiency (SkyGP-Fast). The effectiveness of SkyGP is validated through extensive benchmarks and real-time control experiments demonstrating its superior performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

### Enhancing Zero-Shot Brain Tumor Subtype Classification via Fine-Grained   Patch-Text Alignment
**Authors**: Lubin Gan, Jing Zhang, Linhao Qu, Yijun Wang, Siying Wu, Xiaoyan Sun

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T12:04:27Z

**Summary**: The fine-grained classification of brain tumor subtypes from histopathological whole slide images is highly challenging due to subtle morphological variations and the scarcity of annotated data. Although vision-language models have enabled promising zero-shot classification, their ability to capture fine-grained pathological features remains limited, resulting in suboptimal subtype discrimination. To address these challenges, we propose the Fine-Grained Patch Alignment Network (FG-PAN), a novel zero-shot framework tailored for digital pathology. FG-PAN consists of two key modules: (1) a local feature refinement module that enhances patch-level visual features by modeling spatial relationships among representative patches, and (2) a fine-grained text description generation module that leverages large language models to produce pathology-aware, class-specific semantic prototypes. By aligning refined visual features with LLM-generated fine-grained descriptions, FG-PAN effectively increases class separability in both visual and semantic spaces. Extensive experiments on multiple public pathology datasets, including EBRAINS and TCGA, demonstrate that FG-PAN achieves state-of-the-art performance and robust generalization in zero-shot brain tumor subtype classification.

### READ: Real-time and Efficient Asynchronous Diffusion for Audio-driven   Talking Head Generation
**Authors**: Haotian Wang, Yuzhe Weng, Jun Du, Haoran Xu, Xiaoyan Wu, Shan He, Bing Yin, Cong Liu, Jianqing Gao, Qingfeng Liu

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T11:50:17Z

**Summary**: The introduction of diffusion models has brought significant advances to the field of audio-driven talking head generation. However, the extremely slow inference speed severely limits the practical implementation of diffusion-based talking head generation models. In this study, we propose READ, the first real-time diffusion-transformer-based talking head generation framework. Our approach first learns a spatiotemporal highly compressed video latent space via a temporal VAE, significantly reducing the token count to accelerate generation. To achieve better audio-visual alignment within this compressed latent space, a pre-trained Speech Autoencoder (SpeechAE) is proposed to generate temporally compressed speech latent codes corresponding to the video latent space. These latent representations are then modeled by a carefully designed Audio-to-Video Diffusion Transformer (A2V-DiT) backbone for efficient talking head synthesis. Furthermore, to ensure temporal consistency and accelerated inference in extended generation, we propose a novel asynchronous noise scheduler (ANS) for both the training and inference process of our framework. The ANS leverages asynchronous add-noise and asynchronous motion-guided generation in the latent space, ensuring consistency in generated video clips. Experimental results demonstrate that READ outperforms state-of-the-art methods by generating competitive talking head videos with significantly reduced runtime, achieving an optimal balance between quality and speed while maintaining robust metric stability in long-time generation.

### LUST: A Multi-Modal Framework with Hierarchical LLM-based Scoring for   Learned Thematic Significance Tracking in Multimedia Content
**Authors**: Anderson de Lima Luiz

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T11:48:51Z

**Summary**: This paper introduces the Learned User Significance Tracker (LUST), a framework designed to analyze video content and quantify the thematic relevance of its segments in relation to a user-provided textual description of significance. LUST leverages a multi-modal analytical pipeline, integrating visual cues from video frames with textual information extracted via Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) from the audio track. The core innovation lies in a hierarchical, two-stage relevance scoring mechanism employing Large Language Models (LLMs). An initial "direct relevance" score, $S_{d,i}$, assesses individual segments based on immediate visual and auditory content against the theme. This is followed by a "contextual relevance" score, $S_{c,i}$, that refines the assessment by incorporating the temporal progression of preceding thematic scores, allowing the model to understand evolving narratives. The LUST framework aims to provide a nuanced, temporally-aware measure of user-defined significance, outputting an annotated video with visualized relevance scores and comprehensive analytical logs.

### Chain of Questions: Guiding Multimodal Curiosity in Language Models
**Authors**: Nima Iji, Kia Dashtipour

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T11:42:54Z

**Summary**: Reasoning capabilities in large language models (LLMs) have substantially advanced through methods such as chain-of-thought and explicit step-by-step explanations. However, these improvements have not yet fully transitioned to multimodal contexts, where models must proactively decide which sensory modalities such as vision, audio, or spatial perception to engage when interacting with complex real-world environments. In this paper, we introduce the Chain of Questions (CoQ) framework, a curiosity-driven reasoning approach that encourages multimodal language models to dynamically generate targeted questions regarding their surroundings. These generated questions guide the model to selectively activate relevant modalities, thereby gathering critical information necessary for accurate reasoning and response generation. We evaluate our framework on a novel multimodal benchmark dataset, assembled by integrating WebGPT, ScienceQA, AVSD, and ScanQA datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our CoQ method improves a foundation model's ability to effectively identify and integrate pertinent sensory information. This leads to improved accuracy, interpretability, and alignment of the reasoning process with diverse multimodal tasks.

### GTPO and GRPO-S: Token and Sequence-Level Reward Shaping with Policy   Entropy
**Authors**: Hongze Tan, Jianfei Pan

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T11:42:47Z

**Summary**: Reinforcement learning (RL) with algorithms like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) improves Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning, but is limited by a coarse-grained credit assignment that applies a uniform reward to all tokens in a sequence. This is a major flaw in long-chain reasoning tasks. This paper solves this with \textbf{Dynamic Entropy Weighting}. Our core idea is that high-entropy tokens in correct responses can guide the policy toward a higher performance ceiling. This allows us to create more fine-grained reward signals for precise policy updates via two ways: 1) \textbf{Group Token Policy Optimization} (\textbf{GTPO}), we assigns a entropy-weighted reward to each token for fine-grained credit assignment. 2) \textbf{Sequence-Level Group Relative Policy Optimization} (\textbf{GRPO-S}), we assigns a entropy-weighted reward to each sequence based on its average token entropy. Experiments show our methods significantly outperform the strong DAPO baseline. The results confirm that our entropy-weighting mechanism is the key driver of this performance boost, offering a better path to enhance deep reasoning in models.

### From Split to Share: Private Inference with Distributed Feature Sharing
**Authors**: Zihan Liu, Jiayi Wen, Shouhong Tan, Zhirun Zheng, Cheng Huang

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T11:41:10Z

**Summary**: Cloud-based Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) raises serious privacy concerns when handling sensitive client data. Existing Private Inference (PI) methods face a fundamental trade-off between privacy and efficiency: cryptographic approaches offer strong protection but incur high computational overhead, while efficient alternatives such as split inference expose intermediate features to inversion attacks. We propose PrivDFS, a new paradigm for private inference that replaces a single exposed representation with distributed feature sharing. PrivDFS partitions input features on the client into multiple balanced shares, which are distributed to non-colluding, non-communicating servers for independent partial inference. The client securely aggregates the servers' outputs to reconstruct the final prediction, ensuring that no single server observes sufficient information to compromise input privacy. To further strengthen privacy, we propose two key extensions: PrivDFS-AT, which uses adversarial training with a diffusion-based proxy attacker to enforce inversion-resistant feature partitioning, and PrivDFS-KD, which leverages user-specific keys to diversify partitioning policies and prevent query-based inversion generalization. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and CelebA demonstrate that PrivDFS achieves privacy comparable to deep split inference while cutting client computation by up to 100 times with no accuracy loss, and that the extensions remain robust against both diffusion-based in-distribution and adaptive attacks.

### On the Fundamental Impossibility of Hallucination Control in Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Michał P. Karpowicz

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T11:34:54Z

**Summary**: This paper establishes a fundamental impossibility theorem: no LLM capable performing non-trivial knowledge aggregation can simultaneously achieve truthful (internally consistent) knowledge representation, semantic information conservation, complete revelation of relevant knowledge, and knowledge-constrained optimality. This impossibility is not an engineering limitation but arises from the mathematical structure of information aggregation itself. We establish this result by describing the inference process as an auction of ideas, where distributed components compete exploiting their partial knowledge to shape responses. The proof spans three independent mathematical domains: mechanism design theory (Green-Laffont), the theory of proper scoring rules (Savage), and direct architectural analysis of transformers (Log-Sum-Exp convexity). In particular, we show how in the strictly concave settings the score of an aggregate of diverse beliefs strictly exceeds the sum of individual scores. That gap may quantify the creation of unattributable certainty or overconfidence -- the mathematical origin of both hallucination and creativity, or imagination.   To support this analysis, we introduce the complementary concepts of the semantic information measure and the emergence operator to model bounded reasoning in a general setting. We prove that while bounded reasoning generates accessible information, providing valuable insights and inspirations, idealized reasoning strictly preserves semantic content. By demonstrating that hallucination and imagination are mathematically identical phenomena-grounded in the necessary violation of information conservation-this paper offers a principled foundation for managing these behaviors in advanced AI systems. Finally, we present some speculative ideas to inspire evaluation and refinements of the proposed theory.

### Sign Spotting Disambiguation using Large Language Models
**Authors**: JianHe Low, Ozge Mercanoglu Sincan, Richard Bowden

**Updated**: 2025-08-07T13:34:51Z

**Summary**: Sign spotting, the task of identifying and localizing individual signs within continuous sign language video, plays a pivotal role in scaling dataset annotations and addressing the severe data scarcity issue in sign language translation. While automatic sign spotting holds great promise for enabling frame-level supervision at scale, it grapples with challenges such as vocabulary inflexibility and ambiguity inherent in continuous sign streams. Hence, we introduce a novel, training-free framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) to significantly enhance sign spotting quality. Our approach extracts global spatio-temporal and hand shape features, which are then matched against a large-scale sign dictionary using dynamic time warping and cosine similarity. This dictionary-based matching inherently offers superior vocabulary flexibility without requiring model retraining. To mitigate noise and ambiguity from the matching process, an LLM performs context-aware gloss disambiguation via beam search, notably without fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world sign language datasets demonstrate our method's superior accuracy and sentence fluency compared to traditional approaches, highlighting the potential of LLMs in advancing sign spotting.

### Deliberative Reasoning Network: An Uncertainty-Driven Paradigm for   Belief-Tracked Inference with Pretrained Language Models
**Authors**: Anran Xu, Jincheng Wang, Baigen Cai, Tao Wen

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T11:33:35Z

**Summary**: Large language models often fail at logical reasoning when semantic heuristics conflict with decisive evidence - a phenomenon we term cognitive traps. To address this fundamental limitation, we introduce the Deliberative Reasoning Network (DRN), a novel paradigm that reframes logical reasoning from probability maximization to uncertainty minimization. Instead of asking "Which answer is most likely?", DRN asks "Which hypothesis has the most internally consistent evidence?". DRN achieves intrinsic interpretability by explicitly tracking belief states and quantifying epistemic uncertainty for competing hypotheses through an iterative evidence synthesis process. We validate our approach through two complementary architectures - a bespoke discriminative model that embodies the core uncertainty minimization principle, and a lightweight verification module that enhances existing generative LLMs. Evaluated on LCR-1000, our new adversarial reasoning benchmark designed to expose cognitive traps, the bespoke DRN achieves up to 15.2% improvement over standard baselines. When integrated as a parameter-efficient verifier with Mistral-7B, our hybrid system boosts accuracy from 20% to 80% on the most challenging problems. Critically, DRN demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization, improving TruthfulQA performance by 23.6% without additional training, indicating that uncertainty-driven deliberation learns transferable reasoning principles. We position DRN as a foundational, verifiable System 2 reasoning component for building more trustworthy AI systems.

### Adversarial Cooperative Rationalization: The Risk of Spurious   Correlations in Even Clean Datasets
**Authors**: Wei Liu, Zhongyu Niu, Lang Gao, Zhiying Deng, Jun Wang, Haozhao Wang, Ruixuan Li

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T11:31:36Z

**Summary**: This study investigates the self-rationalization framework constructed with a cooperative game, where a generator initially extracts the most informative segment from raw input, and a subsequent predictor utilizes the selected subset for its input. The generator and predictor are trained collaboratively to maximize prediction accuracy. In this paper, we first uncover a potential caveat: such a cooperative game could unintentionally introduce a sampling bias during rationale extraction. Specifically, the generator might inadvertently create an incorrect correlation between the selected rationale candidate and the label, even when they are semantically unrelated in the original dataset. Subsequently, we elucidate the origins of this bias using both detailed theoretical analysis and empirical evidence. Our findings suggest a direction for inspecting these correlations through attacks, based on which we further introduce an instruction to prevent the predictor from learning the correlations. Through experiments on six text classification datasets and two graph classification datasets using three network architectures (GRUs, BERT, and GCN), we show that our method not only significantly outperforms recent rationalization methods, but also achieves comparable or even better results than a representative LLM (llama3.1-8b-instruct).

### Modelling and Classifying the Components of a Literature Review
**Authors**: Francisco Bolaños, Angelo Salatino, Francesco Osborne, Enrico Motta

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T11:30:07Z

**Summary**: Previous work has demonstrated that AI methods for analysing scientific literature benefit significantly from annotating sentences in papers according to their rhetorical roles, such as research gaps, results, limitations, extensions of existing methodologies, and others. Such representations also have the potential to support the development of a new generation of systems capable of producing high-quality literature reviews. However, achieving this goal requires the definition of a relevant annotation schema and effective strategies for large-scale annotation of the literature. This paper addresses these challenges by 1) introducing a novel annotation schema specifically designed to support literature review generation and 2) conducting a comprehensive evaluation of a wide range of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) in classifying rhetorical roles according to this schema. To this end, we also present Sci-Sentence, a novel multidisciplinary benchmark comprising 700 sentences manually annotated by domain experts and 2,240 sentences automatically labelled using LLMs. We evaluate 37 LLMs on this benchmark, spanning diverse model families and sizes, using both zero-shot learning and fine-tuning approaches. The experiments yield several novel insights that advance the state of the art in this challenging domain. First, the current generation of LLMs performs remarkably well on this task when fine-tuned on high-quality data, achieving performance levels above 96\% F1. Second, while large proprietary models like GPT-4o achieve the best results, some lightweight open-source alternatives also demonstrate excellent performance. Finally, enriching the training data with semi-synthetic examples generated by LLMs proves beneficial, enabling small encoders to achieve robust results and significantly enhancing the performance of several open decoder models.

### The SWE-Bench Illusion: When State-of-the-Art LLMs Remember Instead of   Reason
**Authors**: Shanchao Liang, Spandan Garg, Roshanak Zilouchian Moghaddam

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T11:23:11Z

**Summary**: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly capable and widely adopted, benchmarks play a central role in assessing their practical utility. For example, SWE-Bench Verified has emerged as a critical benchmark for evaluating LLMs' software engineering abilities, particularly their aptitude for resolving real-world GitHub issues. Recent LLMs show impressive performance on SWE-Bench, leading to optimism about their capacity for complex coding tasks. However, current evaluation protocols may overstate these models' true capabilities. It is crucial to distinguish LLMs' generalizable problem-solving ability and other learned artifacts. In this work, we introduce two diagnostic tasks: file path identification from issue descriptions alone and ground truth function reproduction with only the current file context and issue description to probe models' underlying knowledge. We present empirical evidence that performance gains on SWE-Bench-Verified may be partially driven by memorization rather than genuine problem-solving. We show that state-of-the-art models achieve up to 76% accuracy in identifying buggy file paths using only issue descriptions, without access to repository structure. This performance is merely up to 53% on tasks from repositories not included in SWE-Bench, pointing to possible data contamination or memorization. Similar patterns are also observed for the function reproduction task, where the verbatim similarity is much higher on SWE-Bench Verified than on other similar coding benchmarks (up to 35% consecutive 5-gram accuracy on SWE-Bench Verified and Full, but only up to 18% for tasks in other benchmarks). These findings raise concerns about the validity of existing results and underscore the need for more robust, contamination-resistant benchmarks to reliably evaluate LLMs' coding abilities.

### Forgetting: A New Mechanism Towards Better Large Language Model   Fine-tuning
**Authors**: Ali Taheri Ghahrizjani, Alireza Taban, Qizhou Wang, Shanshan Ye, Abdolreza Mirzaei, Tongliang Liu, Bo Han

**Updated**: 2025-08-07T08:30:41Z

**Summary**: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) plays a critical role for pretrained large language models (LLMs), notably enhancing their capacity to acquire domain-specific knowledge while preserving or potentially augmenting their general-purpose capabilities. However, the efficacy of SFT hinges on data quality as well as data volume, otherwise it may result in limited performance gains or even degradation relative to the associated baselines. To mitigate such reliance, we suggest categorizing tokens within each corpus into two parts -- positive and negative tokens -- based on whether they are useful to improve model performance. Positive tokens can be trained in common ways, whereas negative tokens, which may lack essential semantics or be misleading, should be explicitly forgotten. Overall, the token categorization facilitate the model to learn less informative message, and the forgetting process shapes a knowledge boundary to guide the model on what information to learn more precisely. We conduct experiments on well-established benchmarks, finding that this forgetting mechanism not only improves overall model performance and also facilitate more diverse model responses.

**Authors**: Mohammad Khodadad, Ali Shiraee Kasmaee, Mahdi Astaraki, Nicholas Sherck, Hamidreza Mahyar, Soheila Samiee

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T11:20:14Z

**Summary**: In this study, we introduced a new benchmark consisting of a curated dataset and a defined evaluation process to assess the compositional reasoning capabilities of large language models within the chemistry domain. We designed and validated a fully automated pipeline, verified by subject matter experts, to facilitate this task. Our approach integrates OpenAI reasoning models with named entity recognition (NER) systems to extract chemical entities from recent literature, which are then augmented with external knowledge bases to form a comprehensive knowledge graph. By generating multi-hop questions across these graphs, we assess LLM performance in both context-augmented and non-context augmented settings. Our experiments reveal that even state-of-the-art models face significant challenges in multi-hop compositional reasoning. The results reflect the importance of augmenting LLMs with document retrieval, which can have a substantial impact on improving their performance. However, even perfect retrieval accuracy with full context does not eliminate reasoning errors, underscoring the complexity of compositional reasoning. This work not only benchmarks and highlights the limitations of current LLMs but also presents a novel data generation pipeline capable of producing challenging reasoning datasets across various domains. Overall, this research advances our understanding of reasoning in computational linguistics.

**Authors**: Abdelaziz Salama, Zeinab Nezami, Mohammed M. H. Qazzaz, Maryam Hafeez, Syed Ali Raza Zaidi

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T11:17:33Z

**Summary**: The deployment of AI agents within legacy Radio Access Network (RAN) infrastructure poses significant safety and reliability challenges for future 6G networks. This paper presents a novel Edge AI framework for autonomous network optimisation in Open RAN environments, addressing these challenges through three core innovations: (1) a persona-based multi-tools architecture enabling distributed, context-aware decision-making; (2) proactive anomaly detection agent powered by traffic predictive tool; and (3) a safety, aligned reward mechanism that balances performance with operational stability. Integrated into the RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC), our framework leverages multimodal data fusion, including network KPIs, a traffic prediction model, and external information sources, to anticipate and respond to dynamic network conditions. Extensive evaluation using realistic 5G scenarios demonstrates that the edge framework achieves zero network outages under high-stress conditions, compared to 8.4% for traditional fixed-power networks and 3.3% for large language model (LLM) agent-based approaches, while maintaining near real-time responsiveness and consistent QoS. These results establish that, when equipped with the right tools and contextual awareness, AI agents can be safely and effectively deployed in critical network infrastructure, laying the framework for intelligent and autonomous 5G and beyond network operations.

**Authors**: Zizhan Ma, Wenxuan Wang, Guo Yu, Yiu-Fai Cheung, Meidan Ding, Jie Liu, Wenting Chen, Linlin Shen

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T11:11:40Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) show significant potential in healthcare, prompting numerous benchmarks to evaluate their capabilities. However, concerns persist regarding the reliability of these benchmarks, which often lack clinical fidelity, robust data management, and safety-oriented evaluation metrics. To address these shortcomings, we introduce MedCheck, the first lifecycle-oriented assessment framework specifically designed for medical benchmarks. Our framework deconstructs a benchmark's development into five continuous stages, from design to governance, and provides a comprehensive checklist of 46 medically-tailored criteria. Using MedCheck, we conducted an in-depth empirical evaluation of 53 medical LLM benchmarks. Our analysis uncovers widespread, systemic issues, including a profound disconnect from clinical practice, a crisis of data integrity due to unmitigated contamination risks, and a systematic neglect of safety-critical evaluation dimensions like model robustness and uncertainty awareness. Based on these findings, MedCheck serves as both a diagnostic tool for existing benchmarks and an actionable guideline to foster a more standardized, reliable, and transparent approach to evaluating AI in healthcare.

### Learning in a Multifield Coherent Ising Machine
**Authors**: Daan de Bos, Marc Serra-Garcia

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T11:08:56Z

**Summary**: We introduce a network of coupled oscillators that can learn to solve a classification task from a set of examples -- performing both training and inference through the nonlinear evolution of the system. We accomplish this by combining three key elements to achieve learning: A long-term memory that stores learned responses, analogous to the synapses in biological brains; a short-term memory that stores the neural activations, similar to the firing patterns of neurons; and an evolution law that updates the synapses in response to novel examples, inspired by synaptic plasticity. Achieving all three elements in wave-based information processors such as metamaterials is a significant challenge. Here, we solve it by leveraging the material multistability to implement long-term memory, and harnessing symmetries and thermal noise to realize the learning rule. Our analysis reveals that the learning mechanism, although inspired by synaptic plasticity, also shares parallelisms with bacterial evolution strategies, where mutation rates increase in the presence of noxious stimuli.

### PAK-UCB Contextual Bandit: An Online Learning Approach to Prompt-Aware   Selection of Generative Models and LLMs
**Authors**: Xiaoyan Hu, Ho-fung Leung, Farzan Farnia

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T11:02:01Z

**Summary**: Selecting a sample generation scheme from multiple prompt-based generative models, including large language models (LLMs) and prompt-guided image and video generation models, is typically addressed by choosing the model that maximizes an averaged evaluation score. However, this score-based selection overlooks the possibility that different models achieve the best generation performance for different types of text prompts. An online identification of the best generation model for various input prompts can reduce the costs associated with querying sub-optimal models. In this work, we explore the possibility of varying rankings of text-based generative models for different text prompts and propose an online learning framework to predict the best data generation model for a given input prompt. The proposed PAK-UCB algorithm addresses a contextual bandit (CB) setting with shared context variables across the arms, utilizing the generated data to update kernel-based functions that predict the score of each model available for unseen text prompts. Additionally, we leverage random Fourier features (RFF) to accelerate the online learning process of PAK-UCB. Our numerical experiments on real and simulated text-to-image and image-to-text generative models show that RFF-UCB performs successfully in identifying the best generation model across different sample types. The code is available at: github.com/yannxiaoyanhu/dgm-online-select.

### Multi-Agent Taskforce Collaboration: Self-Correction of Compounding   Errors in Long-Form Literature Review Generation
**Authors**: Zhi Zhang, Yan Liu, Zhejing Hu, Gong Chen, Sheng-hua Zhong, Jiannong Cao

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T10:45:52Z

**Summary**: Literature reviews play an important role in scientific research. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have boosted the development of automated systems for the entire literature review workflow, from retrieval to manuscript drafting. However, a key challenge is that mistakes made in early stages can propagate and amplify in subsequent steps, leading to compounding errors that undermine the faithfulness of the final review. To tackle this issue, we propose the Multi-Agent Taskforce Collaboration (MATC) framework, which consists of a manager agent and four executor agents for literature searching, outline generation, fact localization, and manuscript drafting. We propose three novel collaboration paradigms, forming exploration, exploitation, and experience taskforces, to effectively organize agents and mitigate compounding errors both between and within executor agents. Experimental results show that MATC achieves state-of-the-art performance on existing benchmarks. We further propose a new benchmark dataset featuring more diverse topics for faithful literature review generation.

### MuGS: Multi-Baseline Generalizable Gaussian Splatting Reconstruction
**Authors**: Yaopeng Lou, Liao Shen, Tianqi Liu, Jiaqi Li, Zihao Huang, Huiqiang Sun, Zhiguo Cao

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T10:34:24Z

**Summary**: We present Multi-Baseline Gaussian Splatting (MuRF), a generalized feed-forward approach for novel view synthesis that effectively handles diverse baseline settings, including sparse input views with both small and large baselines. Specifically, we integrate features from Multi-View Stereo (MVS) and Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) to enhance feature representations for generalizable reconstruction. Next, We propose a projection-and-sampling mechanism for deep depth fusion, which constructs a fine probability volume to guide the regression of the feature map. Furthermore, We introduce a reference-view loss to improve geometry and optimization efficiency. We leverage 3D Gaussian representations to accelerate training and inference time while enhancing rendering quality. MuRF achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple baseline settings and diverse scenarios ranging from simple objects (DTU) to complex indoor and outdoor scenes (RealEstate10K). We also demonstrate promising zero-shot performance on the LLFF and Mip-NeRF 360 datasets.

### EVOC2RUST: A Skeleton-guided Framework for Project-Level C-to-Rust   Translation
**Authors**: Chaofan Wang, Tingrui Yu, Jie Wang, Dong Chen, Wenrui Zhang, Yuling Shi, Xiaodong Gu, Beijun Shen

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T10:31:23Z

**Summary**: Rust's compile-time safety guarantees make it ideal for safety-critical systems, creating demand for translating legacy C codebases to Rust. While various approaches have emerged for this task, they face inherent trade-offs: rule-based solutions face challenges in meeting code safety and idiomaticity requirements, while LLM-based solutions often fail to generate semantically equivalent Rust code, due to the heavy dependencies of modules across the entire codebase. Recent studies have revealed that both solutions are limited to small-scale programs. In this paper, we propose EvoC2Rust, an automated framework for converting entire C projects to equivalent Rust ones. EvoC2Rust employs a skeleton-guided translation strategy for project-level translation. The pipeline consists of three evolutionary stages: 1) it first decomposes the C project into functional modules, employs a feature-mapping-enhanced LLM to transform definitions and macros and generates type-checked function stubs, which form a compilable Rust skeleton; 2) it then incrementally translates the function, replacing the corresponding stub placeholder; 3) finally, it repairs compilation errors by integrating LLM and static analysis. Through evolutionary augmentation, EvoC2Rust combines the advantages of both rule-based and LLM-based solutions. Our evaluation on open-source benchmarks and six industrial projects demonstrates EvoC2Rust's superior performance in project-level C-to-Rust translation. On average, it achieves 17.24% and 14.32% improvements in syntax and semantic accuracy over the LLM-based approaches, along with a 96.79% higher code safety rate than the rule-based tools. At the module level, EvoC2Rust reaches 92.25% compilation and 89.53% test pass rates on industrial projects, even for complex codebases and long functions.

### Less Signals, More Understanding: Channel-Capacity Codebook Design for   Digital Task-Oriented Semantic Communication
**Authors**: Anbang Zhang, Shuaishuai Guo, Chenyuan Feng, Hongyang Du, Haojin Li, Chen Sun, Haijun Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T10:29:46Z

**Summary**: Discrete representation has emerged as a powerful tool in task-oriented semantic communication (ToSC), offering compact, interpretable, and efficient representations well-suited for low-power edge intelligence scenarios. Its inherent digital nature aligns seamlessly with hardware-friendly deployment and robust storage/transmission protocols. However, despite its strengths, current ToSC frameworks often decouple semantic-aware discrete mapping from the underlying channel characteristics and task demands. This mismatch leads to suboptimal communication performance, degraded task utility, and limited generalization under variable wireless conditions. Moreover, conventional designs frequently overlook channel-awareness in codebook construction, restricting the effectiveness of semantic symbol selection under constrained resources. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a channel-aware discrete semantic coding framework tailored for low-power edge networks. Leveraging a Wasserstein-regularized objective, our approach aligns discrete code activations with optimal input distributions, thereby improving semantic fidelity, robustness, and task accuracy. Extensive experiments on the inference tasks across diverse signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes show that our method achieves notable gains in accuracy and communication efficiency. This work provides new insights into integrating discrete semantics and channel optimization, paving the way for the widespread adoption of semantic communication in future digital infrastructures.

**Authors**: Thibaut Thonet, Germán Kruszewski, Jos Rozen, Pierre Erbacher, Marc Dymetman

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T17:58:26Z

**Summary**: LLM-powered conversational assistants are often deployed in a one-size-fits-all manner, which fails to accommodate individual user preferences. Recently, LLM personalization -- tailoring models to align with specific user preferences -- has gained increasing attention as a way to bridge this gap. In this work, we specifically focus on a practical yet challenging setting where only a small set of preference annotations can be collected per user -- a problem we define as Personalized Preference Alignment with Limited Data (PPALLI). To support research in this area, we introduce two datasets -- DnD and ELIP -- and benchmark a variety of alignment techniques on them. We further propose FaST, a highly parameter-efficient approach that leverages high-level features automatically discovered from the data, achieving the best overall performance.

### Aligning Human and LLM Judgments: Insights from EvalAssist on   Task-Specific Evaluations and AI-assisted Assessment Strategy Preferences
**Authors**: Zahra Ashktorab, Michael Desmond, Qian Pan, James M. Johnson, Martin Santillan Cooper, Elizabeth M. Daly, Rahul Nair, Tejaswini Pedapati, Hyo Jin Do, Werner Geyer

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T17:57:01Z

**Summary**: Evaluation of large language model (LLM) outputs requires users to make critical judgments about the best outputs across various configurations. This process is costly and takes time given the large amounts of data. LLMs are increasingly used as evaluators to filter training data, evaluate model performance or assist human evaluators with detailed assessments. To support this process, effective front-end tools are critical for evaluation. Two common approaches for using LLMs as evaluators are direct assessment and pairwise comparison. In our study with machine learning practitioners (n=15), each completing 6 tasks yielding 131 evaluations, we explore how task-related factors and assessment strategies influence criteria refinement and user perceptions. Findings show that users performed more evaluations with direct assessment by making criteria task-specific, modifying judgments, and changing the evaluator model. We conclude with recommendations for how systems can better support interactions in LLM-assisted evaluations.

### From MAS to MARS: Coordination Failures and Reasoning Trade-offs in   Hierarchical Multi-Agent Robotic Systems within a Healthcare Scenario
**Authors**: Yuanchen Bai, Zijian Ding, Shaoyue Wen, Xiang Chang, Angelique Taylor

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T17:54:10Z

**Summary**: Multi-agent robotic systems (MARS) build upon multi-agent systems by integrating physical and task-related constraints, increasing the complexity of action execution and agent coordination. However, despite the availability of advanced multi-agent frameworks, their real-world deployment on robots remains limited, hindering the advancement of MARS research in practice. To bridge this gap, we conducted two studies to investigate performance trade-offs of hierarchical multi-agent frameworks in a simulated real-world multi-robot healthcare scenario. In Study 1, using CrewAI, we iteratively refine the system's knowledge base, to systematically identify and categorize coordination failures (e.g., tool access violations, lack of timely handling of failure reports) not resolvable by providing contextual knowledge alone. In Study 2, using AutoGen, we evaluate a redesigned bidirectional communication structure and further measure the trade-offs between reasoning and non-reasoning models operating within the same robotic team setting. Drawing from our empirical findings, we emphasize the tension between autonomy and stability and the importance of edge-case testing to improve system reliability and safety for future real-world deployment. Supplementary materials, including codes, task agent setup, trace outputs, and annotated examples of coordination failures and reasoning behaviors, are available at: https://byc-sophie.github.io/mas-to-mars/.

### Harnessing Large Language Models for Group POI Recommendations
**Authors**: Jing Long, Liang Qu, Junliang Yu, Tong Chen, Quoc Viet Hung Nguyen, Hongzhi Yin

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T17:45:47Z

**Summary**: The rapid proliferation of Location-Based Social Networks (LBSNs) has underscored the importance of Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation systems in enhancing user experiences. While individual POI recommendation methods leverage users' check-in histories to provide personalized suggestions, they struggle to address scenarios requiring group decision-making. Group POI recommendation systems aim to satisfy the collective preferences of multiple users, but existing approaches face two major challenges: diverse group preferences and extreme data sparsity in group check-in data. To overcome these challenges, we propose LLMGPR, a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) for group POI recommendations. LLMGPR introduces semantic-enhanced POI tokens and incorporates rich contextual information to model the diverse and complex dynamics of group decision-making. To further enhance its capabilities, we developed a sequencing adapter using Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA), which aligns LLMs with group POI recommendation tasks. To address the issue of sparse group check-in data, LLMGPR employs an aggregation adapter that integrates individual representations into meaningful group representations. Additionally, a self-supervised learning (SSL) task is designed to predict the purposes of check-in sequences (e.g., business trips and family vacations), thereby enriching group representations with deeper semantic insights. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of LLMGPR, showcasing its ability to significantly enhance the accuracy and robustness of group POI recommendations.

### MisVisFix: An Interactive Dashboard for Detecting, Explaining, and   Correcting Misleading Visualizations using Large Language Models
**Authors**: Amit Kumar Das, Klaus Mueller

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T17:45:11Z

**Summary**: Misleading visualizations pose a significant challenge to accurate data interpretation. While recent research has explored the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for detecting such misinformation, practical tools that also support explanation and correction remain limited. We present MisVisFix, an interactive dashboard that leverages both Claude and GPT models to support the full workflow of detecting, explaining, and correcting misleading visualizations. MisVisFix correctly identifies 96% of visualization issues and addresses all 74 known visualization misinformation types, classifying them as major, minor, or potential concerns. It provides detailed explanations, actionable suggestions, and automatically generates corrected charts. An interactive chat interface allows users to ask about specific chart elements or request modifications. The dashboard adapts to newly emerging misinformation strategies through targeted user interactions. User studies with visualization experts and developers of fact-checking tools show that MisVisFix accurately identifies issues and offers useful suggestions for improvement. By transforming LLM-based detection into an accessible, interactive platform, MisVisFix advances visualization literacy and supports more trustworthy data communication.

### GeRe: Towards Efficient Anti-Forgetting in Continual Learning of LLM via   General Samples Replay
**Authors**: Yunan Zhang, Shuoran Jiang, Mengchen Zhao, Yuefeng Li, Yang Fan, Xiangping Wu, Qingcai Chen

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T17:42:22Z

**Summary**: The continual learning capability of large language models (LLMs) is crucial for advancing artificial general intelligence. However, continual fine-tuning LLMs across various domains often suffers from catastrophic forgetting, characterized by: 1) significant forgetting of their general capabilities, and 2) sharp performance declines in previously learned tasks. To simultaneously address both issues in a simple yet stable manner, we propose General Sample Replay (GeRe), a framework that use usual pretraining texts for efficient anti-forgetting. Beyond revisiting the most prevalent replay-based practices under GeRe, we further leverage neural states to introduce a enhanced activation states constrained optimization method using threshold-based margin (TM) loss, which maintains activation state consistency during replay learning. We are the first to validate that a small, fixed set of pre-collected general replay samples is sufficient to resolve both concerns--retaining general capabilities while promoting overall performance across sequential tasks. Indeed, the former can inherently facilitate the latter. Through controlled experiments, we systematically compare TM with different replay strategies under the GeRe framework, including vanilla label fitting, logit imitation via KL divergence and feature imitation via L1/L2 losses. Results demonstrate that TM consistently improves performance and exhibits better robustness. Our work paves the way for efficient replay of LLMs for the future. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/Qznan/GeRe.

### Adaptive Audio-Visual Speech Recognition via Matryoshka-Based Multimodal   LLMs
**Authors**: Umberto Cappellazzo, Minsu Kim, Stavros Petridis

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T17:41:48Z

**Summary**: Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) leverages audio and visual modalities to improve robustness in noisy environments. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) show strong performance in speech recognition, including AVSR. However, the long speech representations lead to high computational costs for LLMs. Prior methods compress inputs before feeding them to LLMs, but high compression often harms accuracy. To address this, we propose Llama-MTSK, the first Matryoshka-based Multimodal LLM for AVSR, which flexibly adapts audio-visual token allocation under varying compute constraints. Inspired by Matryoshka Representation Learning, our model encodes representations at multiple granularities with a single architecture, avoiding the need for separate models. For efficient fine-tuning, we introduce three LoRA-based strategies using global and scale-specific modules. Evaluations on major AVSR datasets show Llama-MTSK matches or outperforms models trained at fixed compression levels.

### Sculptor: Empowering LLMs with Cognitive Agency via Active Context   Management
**Authors**: Mo Li, L. H. Xu, Qitai Tan, Ting Cao, Yunxin Liu

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T17:32:58Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from significant performance degradation when processing long contexts due to proactive interference, where irrelevant information in earlier parts of the context disrupts reasoning and memory recall. While most research focuses on external memory systems to augment LLMs' capabilities, we propose a complementary approach: empowering LLMs with Active Context Management (ACM) tools to actively sculpt their internal working memory. We introduce Sculptor, a framework that equips LLMs with three categories of tools: (1) context fragmentation, (2) summary, hide, and restore, and (3) intelligent search. Our approach enables LLMs to proactively manage their attention and working memory, analogous to how humans selectively focus on relevant information while filtering out distractions. Experimental evaluation on information-sparse benchmarks-PI-LLM (proactive interference) and NeedleBench Multi-Needle Reasoning-demonstrates that Sculptor significantly improves performance even without specific training, leveraging LLMs' inherent tool calling generalization capabilities. By enabling Active Context Management, Sculptor not only mitigates proactive interference but also provides a cognitive foundation for more reliable reasoning across diverse long-context tasks-highlighting that explicit context-control strategies, rather than merely larger token windows, are key to robustness at scale.

**Summary**: The rise of scaled-out LLMs and scaled-up SuperPods signals a new era in large-scale AI infrastructure. LLMs continue to scale out via MoE, as seen in recent models like DeepSeek, Kimi, and Qwen. In parallel, AI hardware is scaling up, with Huawei's CloudMatrix384 SuperPod offering hundreds of GB/s high-speed interconnects. Running large MoE models on SuperPod-scale hardware brings new challenges. It requires new execution models, scalable scheduling, efficient expert load balancing, and elimination of single points of failure. This paper presents xDeepServe, Huawei Cloud's LLM serving system designed for SuperPod-scale infrastructure. At its core is Transformerless, a disaggregated architecture that decomposes transformer models into modular units--attention, feedforward, and MoE--executed independently on NPUs connected via high-speed fabric. We implement this design in two forms: disaggregated prefill-decode and disaggregated MoE-attention. This fully disaggregated setup enables independent scaling of compute and memory without sacrificing performance. To support this architecture, we propose XCCL, a communication library that leverages CloudMatrix384's global shared memory to implement efficient point-to-point and all-to-all primitives. We also extend our serving engine FlowServe with system-level techniques, enabling scalable inference across hundreds of NPUs.

### X-SAM: From Segment Anything to Any Segmentation
**Authors**: Hao Wang, Limeng Qiao, Zequn Jie, Zhijian Huang, Chengjian Feng, Qingfang Zheng, Lin Ma, Xiangyuan Lan, Xiaodan Liang

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T17:19:10Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in broad knowledge representation, yet they are inherently deficient in pixel-level perceptual understanding. Although the Segment Anything Model (SAM) represents a significant advancement in visual-prompt-driven image segmentation, it exhibits notable limitations in multi-mask prediction and category-specific segmentation tasks, and it cannot integrate all segmentation tasks within a unified model architecture. To address these limitations, we present X-SAM, a streamlined Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) framework that extends the segmentation paradigm from \textit{segment anything} to \textit{any segmentation}. Specifically, we introduce a novel unified framework that enables more advanced pixel-level perceptual comprehension for MLLMs. Furthermore, we propose a new segmentation task, termed Visual GrounDed (VGD) segmentation, which segments all instance objects with interactive visual prompts and empowers MLLMs with visual grounded, pixel-wise interpretative capabilities. To enable effective training on diverse data sources, we present a unified training strategy that supports co-training across multiple datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that X-SAM achieves state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of image segmentation benchmarks, highlighting its efficiency for multimodal, pixel-level visual understanding.

### LLM Collaboration With Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
**Authors**: Shuo Liu, Zeyu Liang, Xueguang Lyu, Christopher Amato

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T17:18:25Z

**Summary**: A large amount of work has been done in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) for modeling and solving problems with multiple interacting agents. However, most LLMs are pretrained independently and not specifically optimized for coordination. Existing LLM fine-tuning frameworks rely on individual rewards, which require complex reward designs for each agent to encourage collaboration. To address these challenges, we model LLM collaboration as a cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) problem. We develop a multi-agent, multi-turn algorithm, Multi-Agent Group Relative Policy Optimization (MAGRPO), to solve it, building on current RL approaches for LLMs as well as MARL techniques. Our experiments on LLM writing and coding collaboration demonstrate that fine-tuning MAS with MAGRPO enables agents to generate high-quality responses efficiently through effective cooperation. Our approach opens the door to using other MARL methods for LLMs and highlights the associated challenges.

**Summary**: Simulating how team members collaborate within complex environments using Agentic AI is a promising approach to explore hypotheses grounded in social science theories and study team behaviors. We introduce VirtLab, a user-friendly, customizable, multi-agent, and scalable team simulation system that enables testing teams with LLM-based agents in spatial and temporal settings. This system addresses the current frameworks' design and technical limitations that do not consider flexible simulation scenarios and spatial settings. VirtLab contains a simulation engine and a web interface that enables both technical and non-technical users to formulate, run, and analyze team simulations without programming. We demonstrate the system's utility by comparing ground truth data with simulated scenarios.

**Authors**: Xu Guo, Tianyi Liang, Tong Jian, Xiaogui Yang, Ling-I Wu, Chenhui Li, Zhihui Lu, Qipeng Guo, Kai Chen

**Updated**: 2025-08-07T11:30:20Z

**Summary**: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) improves instruction following capabilities of large language models (LLMs), but suffers from training inefficiency due to inadequate difficulty assessment. Moreover, RLVR is prone to over-optimization, where LLMs exploit verification shortcuts without aligning to the actual intent of user instructions. We introduce Instruction Following Decorator (IFDecorator}, a framework that wraps RLVR training into a robust and sample-efficient pipeline. It consists of three components: (1) a cooperative-adversarial data flywheel that co-evolves instructions and hybrid verifications, generating progressively more challenging instruction-verification pairs; (2) IntentCheck, a bypass module enforcing intent alignment; and (3) trip wires, a diagnostic mechanism that detects reward hacking via trap instructions, which trigger and capture shortcut exploitation behaviors. Our Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct-IFDecorator achieves 87.43% accuracy on IFEval, outperforming larger proprietary models such as GPT-4o. Additionally, we demonstrate substantial improvements on FollowBench while preserving general capabilities. Our trip wires show significant reductions in reward hacking rates. We will release models, code, and data for future research.

### p-MoD: Building Mixture-of-Depths MLLMs via Progressive Ratio Decay
**Authors**: Jun Zhang, Desen Meng, Zhengming Zhang, Zhenpeng Huang, Tao Wu, Limin Wang

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T16:57:39Z

**Summary**: Despite the remarkable performance of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) across diverse tasks, the substantial training and inference costs impede their advancement. In this paper, we propose p-MoD, an efficient MLLM architecture that significantly reduces training and inference costs while maintaining model performance. The majority of computation in MLLMs stems from the overwhelming volume of vision tokens processed by the transformer-based LLM. Accordingly, we leverage the Mixture-of-Depths (MoD) mechanism, where each LLM layer selects essential vision tokens to process while skipping redundant ones. However, integrating MoD into MLLMs is non-trivial. To address the challenges of training and inference stability as well as limited training data, we adapt the MoD module with two novel designs: tanh-gated weight normalization (TanhNorm) and symmetric token reweighting (STRing). Moreover, we observe that vision tokens exhibit higher redundancy in deeper layers and thus design a progressive ratio decay (PRD) strategy, which gradually reduces the token retention ratio layer by layer, employing a shifted cosine schedule. This crucial design fully unleashes the potential of MoD, significantly boosting the efficiency and performance of our models. Extensive experiments on two baseline models across 15 benchmarks show that our model matches or even surpasses the performance of corresponding baselines, while requiring only 55.6% TFLOPs and 53.7% KV cache storage during inference, and 77.7% GPU hours during training.

### P-Aligner: Enabling Pre-Alignment of Language Models via Principled   Instruction Synthesis
**Authors**: Feifan Song, Bofei Gao, Yifan Song, Yi Liu, Weimin Xiong, Yuyang Song, Tianyu Liu, Guoyin Wang, Houfeng Wang

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T16:51:38Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are expected to produce safe, helpful, and honest content during interaction with human users, but they frequently fail to align with such values when given flawed instructions, e.g., missing context, ambiguous directives, or inappropriate tone, leaving substantial room for improvement along multiple dimensions. A cost-effective yet high-impact way is to pre-align instructions before the model begins decoding. Existing approaches either rely on prohibitive test-time search costs or end-to-end model rewrite, which is powered by a customized training corpus with unclear objectives. In this work, we demonstrate that the goal of efficient and effective preference alignment can be achieved by P-Aligner, a lightweight module generating instructions that preserve the original intents while being expressed in a more human-preferred form. P-Aligner is trained on UltraPrompt, a new dataset synthesized via a proposed principle-guided pipeline using Monte-Carlo Tree Search, which systematically explores the space of candidate instructions that are closely tied to human preference. Experiments across different methods show that P-Aligner generally outperforms strong baselines across various models and benchmarks, including average win-rate gains of 28.35% and 8.69% on GPT-4-turbo and Gemma-2-SimPO, respectively. Further analyses validate its effectiveness and efficiency through multiple perspectives, including data quality, search strategies, iterative deployment, and time overhead.

### RL-PLUS: Countering Capability Boundary Collapse of LLMs in   Reinforcement Learning with Hybrid-policy Optimization
**Authors**: Yihong Dong, Xue Jiang, Yongding Tao, Huanyu Liu, Kechi Zhang, Lili Mou, Rongyu Cao, Yingwei Ma, Jue Chen, Binhua Li, Zhi Jin, Fei Huang, Yongbin Li, Ge Li

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T16:36:42Z

**Summary**: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) has significantly advanced the complex reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, it struggles to break through the inherent capability boundaries of the base LLM, due to its essentially on-policy strategy coupled with LLM's immense action space and sparse reward. Critically, RLVR can lead to the capability boundary collapse, narrowing the LLM's problem-solving scope. To address this problem, we propose RL-PLUS, a novel hybrid-policy optimization approach for LLMs that synergizes internal exploitation with external data to achieve stronger reasoning capabilities and surpass the boundaries of base models. RL-PLUS integrates two core components, i.e., Multiple Importance Sampling to address distributional mismatch from external data, and Exploration-Based Advantage Function to guide the model towards high-value, unexplored reasoning paths. We provide both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments to demonstrate the superiority and generalizability of our approach. Compared with existing RLVR methods, RL-PLUS achieves 1) state-of-the-art performance on six math reasoning benchmarks; 2) superior performance on six out-of-distribution reasoning tasks; 3) consistent and significant gains across diverse model families, with average relative improvements up to 69.2\%. Moreover, the analysis of Pass@k curves indicates that RL-PLUS effectively resolves the capability boundary collapse problem.

**Authors**: Md Zesun Ahmed Mia, Malyaban Bal, Sen Lu, George M. Nishibuchi, Suhas Chelian, Srini Vasan, Abhronil Sengupta

**Updated**: 2025-08-07T15:23:54Z

**Summary**: Inspired by the brain's hierarchical processing and energy efficiency, this paper presents a Spiking Neural Network (SNN) architecture for lifelong Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS). The proposed system first employs an efficient static SNN to identify potential intrusions, which then activates an adaptive dynamic SNN responsible for classifying the specific attack type. Mimicking biological adaptation, the dynamic classifier utilizes Grow When Required (GWR)-inspired structural plasticity and a novel Adaptive Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (Ad-STDP) learning rule. These bio-plausible mechanisms enable the network to learn new threats incrementally while preserving existing knowledge. Tested on the UNSW-NB15 benchmark in a continual learning setting, the architecture demonstrates robust adaptation, reduced catastrophic forgetting, and achieves $85.3$\% overall accuracy. Furthermore, simulations using the Intel Lava framework confirm high operational sparsity, highlighting the potential for low-power deployment on neuromorphic hardware.

### TURA: Tool-Augmented Unified Retrieval Agent for AI Search
**Authors**: Zhejun Zhao, Yuehu Dong, Alley Liu, Lixue Zheng, Pingsheng Liu, Dongdong Shen, Long Xia, Jiashu Zhao, Dawei Yin

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T16:24:17Z

**Summary**: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) is transforming search engines into conversational AI search products, primarily using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) on web corpora. However, this paradigm has significant industrial limitations. Traditional RAG approaches struggle with real-time needs and structured queries that require accessing dynamically generated content like ticket availability or inventory. Limited to indexing static pages, search engines cannot perform the interactive queries needed for such time-sensitive data. Academic research has focused on optimizing RAG for static content, overlooking complex intents and the need for dynamic sources like databases and real-time APIs. To bridge this gap, we introduce TURA (Tool-Augmented Unified Retrieval Agent for AI Search), a novel three-stage framework that combines RAG with agentic tool-use to access both static content and dynamic, real-time information. TURA has three key components: an Intent-Aware Retrieval module to decompose queries and retrieve information sources encapsulated as Model Context Protocol (MCP) Servers, a DAG-based Task Planner that models task dependencies as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) for optimal parallel execution, and a lightweight Distilled Agent Executor for efficient tool calling. TURA is the first architecture to systematically bridge the gap between static RAG and dynamic information sources for a world-class AI search product. Serving tens of millions of users, it leverages an agentic framework to deliver robust, real-time answers while meeting the low-latency demands of a large-scale industrial system.

### Basis Selection: Low-Rank Decomposition of Pretrained Large Language   Models for Target Applications
**Authors**: Yang Li, Daniel Agyei Asante, Changsheng Zhao, Ernie Chang, Yangyang Shi, Vikas Chandra

**Updated**: 2025-08-07T01:02:42Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) significantly enhance the performance of various applications, but they are computationally intensive and energy-demanding. This makes it challenging to deploy them on devices with limited resources, such as personal computers and mobile/wearable devices, and results in substantial inference costs in resource-rich environments like cloud servers. To extend the use of LLMs, we introduce a low-rank decomposition approach to effectively compress these models, tailored to the requirements of specific applications. We observe that LLMs pretrained on general datasets contain many redundant components not needed for particular applications. Our method focuses on identifying and removing these redundant parts, retaining only the necessary elements for the target applications. Specifically, we represent the weight matrices of LLMs as a linear combination of base components. We then prune the irrelevant bases and enhance the model with new bases beneficial for specific applications. Deep compression results on the Llama 2-7b and -13B models, conducted on target applications including mathematical reasoning and code generation, show that our method significantly reduces model size while maintaining comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art low-rank compression techniques.

### Pseudo Depth Meets Gaussian: A Feed-forward RGB SLAM Baseline
**Authors**: Linqing Zhao, Xiuwei Xu, Yirui Wang, Hao Wang, Wenzhao Zheng, Yansong Tang, Haibin Yan, Jiwen Lu

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T16:16:58Z

**Summary**: Incrementally recovering real-sized 3D geometry from a pose-free RGB stream is a challenging task in 3D reconstruction, requiring minimal assumptions on input data. Existing methods can be broadly categorized into end-to-end and visual SLAM-based approaches, both of which either struggle with long sequences or depend on slow test-time optimization and depth sensors. To address this, we first integrate a depth estimator into an RGB-D SLAM system, but this approach is hindered by inaccurate geometric details in predicted depth. Through further investigation, we find that 3D Gaussian mapping can effectively solve this problem. Building on this, we propose an online 3D reconstruction method using 3D Gaussian-based SLAM, combined with a feed-forward recurrent prediction module to directly infer camera pose from optical flow. This approach replaces slow test-time optimization with fast network inference, significantly improving tracking speed. Additionally, we introduce a local graph rendering technique to enhance robustness in feed-forward pose prediction. Experimental results on the Replica and TUM-RGBD datasets, along with a real-world deployment demonstration, show that our method achieves performance on par with the state-of-the-art SplaTAM, while reducing tracking time by more than 90\%.

**Authors**: Bhawna Piryani, Jamshid Mozafari, Abdelrahman Abdallah, Antoine Doucet, Adam Jatowt

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T16:07:06Z

**Summary**: Optical Character Recognition (OCR) plays a crucial role in digitizing historical and multilingual documents, yet OCR errors - imperfect extraction of text, including character insertion, deletion, and substitution can significantly impact downstream tasks like question-answering (QA). In this work, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of how OCR-induced noise affects the performance of Multilingual QA Systems. To support this analysis, we introduce a multilingual QA dataset MultiOCR-QA, comprising 50K question-answer pairs across three languages, English, French, and German. The dataset is curated from OCR-ed historical documents, which include different levels and types of OCR noise. We then evaluate how different state-of-the-art Large Language models (LLMs) perform under different error conditions, focusing on three major OCR error types. Our findings show that QA systems are highly prone to OCR-induced errors and perform poorly on noisy OCR text. By comparing model performance on clean versus noisy texts, we provide insights into the limitations of current approaches and emphasize the need for more noise-resilient QA systems in historical digitization contexts.

### Bob's Confetti: Phonetic Memorization Attacks in Music and Video   Generation
**Authors**: Jaechul Roh, Zachary Novack, Yuefeng Peng, Niloofar Mireshghallah, Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick, Amir Houmansadr

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T16:06:47Z

**Summary**: Memorization in generative models extends far beyond verbatim text reproduction--it manifests through non-literal patterns, semantic associations, and surprisingly, across modalities in transcript-conditioned generation tasks such as Lyrics-to-Song (L2S) and Text-to-Video (T2V) models. We reveal a new class of cross-modality memorization where models trained on these tasks leak copyrighted content through indirect, phonetic pathways invisible to traditional text-based analysis. In this work, we introduce Adversarial PhoneTic Prompting (APT), an attack that replaces iconic phrases with homophonic alternatives--e.g., "mom's spaghetti" becomes "Bob's confetti"--preserving the acoustic form while largely changing semantic content. We demonstrate that models can be prompted to regurgitate memorized songs using phonetically similar but semantically unrelated lyrics. Despite the semantic drift, black-box models like SUNO and open-source models like YuE generate outputs that are strikingly similar to the original songs--melodically, rhythmically, and vocally--achieving high scores on AudioJudge, CLAP, and CoverID. These effects persist across genres and languages. More surprisingly, we find that phonetic prompts alone can trigger visual memorization in text-to-video models: when given altered lyrics from Lose Yourself, Veo 3 generates scenes that mirror the original music video--complete with a hooded rapper and dim urban settings--despite no explicit visual cues in the prompt. This cross-modality leakage represents an unprecedented threat: models memorize deep, structural patterns that transcend their training modality, making traditional safety measures like copyright filters ineffective. Our findings reveal a fundamental vulnerability in transcript-conditioned generative models and raise urgent concerns around copyright, provenance, and secure deployment of multimodal generation systems.

### Share Your Attention: Transformer Weight Sharing via Matrix-based   Dictionary Learning
**Authors**: Magauiya Zhussip, Dmitriy Shopkhoev, Ammar Ali, Stamatios Lefkimmiatis

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T16:06:43Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized AI applications, yet their high computational and memory demands hinder their widespread deployment. Existing compression techniques focus on intra-block optimizations (e.g. low-rank approximation, attention head pruning), while the repetitive layered structure of transformers implies significant inter-block redundancy - a dimension largely unexplored beyond key-value (KV) caching. Inspired by dictionary learning in CNNs, we propose a framework for structured weight sharing across transformer layers. Our approach decomposes attention projection matrices into shared dictionary atoms, reducing the attention module's parameters by 66.7% while achieving on-par performance. Unlike complex methods requiring distillation or architectural changes, MASA (Matrix Atom Sharing in Attention) operates as a drop-in replacement - trained with standard optimizers - and represents each layer's weights as linear combinations of shared matrix atoms. Experiments across scales (100M-700M parameters) show that MASA achieves better benchmark accuracy and perplexity than grouped-query attention (GQA), low-rank baselines and recently proposed Repeat-all-over/Sequential sharing at comparable parameter budgets. Ablation studies confirm robustness to the dictionary size and the efficacy of shared representations in capturing cross-layer statistical regularities. Extending to Vision Transformers (ViT), MASA matches performance metrics on image classification and detection tasks with 66.7% fewer attention parameters. By combining dictionary learning strategies with transformer efficiency, MASA offers a scalable blueprint for parameter-efficient models without sacrificing performance. Finally, we investigate the possibility of employing MASA on pretrained LLMs to reduce their number of parameters without experiencing any significant drop in their performance.

### SID: Benchmarking Guided Instruction Capabilities in STEM Education with   a Socratic Interdisciplinary Dialogues Dataset
**Authors**: Mei Jiang, Houping Yue, Bingdong Li, Hao Hao, Ying Qian, Bo Jiang, Aimin Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T15:49:26Z

**Summary**: Fostering students' abilities for knowledge integration and transfer in complex problem-solving scenarios is a core objective of modern education, and interdisciplinary STEM is a key pathway to achieve this, yet it requires expert guidance that is difficult to scale. While LLMs offer potential in this regard, their true capability for guided instruction remains unclear due to the lack of an effective evaluation benchmark. To address this, we introduce SID, the first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the higher-order guidance capabilities of LLMs in multi-turn, interdisciplinary Socratic dialogues. Our contributions include a large-scale dataset of 10,000 dialogue turns across 48 complex STEM projects, a novel annotation schema for capturing deep pedagogical features, and a new suite of evaluation metrics (e.g., X-SRG). Baseline experiments confirm that even state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to execute effective guided dialogues that lead students to achieve knowledge integration and transfer. This highlights the critical value of our benchmark in driving the development of more pedagogically-aware LLMs.

### Paragon: Parameter Generation for Controllable Multi-Task Recommendation
**Authors**: Chenglei Shen, Jiahao Zhao, Xiao Zhang, Weijie Yu, Ming He, Jianping Fan

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T15:46:37Z

**Summary**: Commercial recommender systems face the challenge that task requirements from platforms or users often change dynamically (e.g., varying preferences for accuracy or diversity). Ideally, the model should be re-trained after resetting a new objective function, adapting to these changes in task requirements. However, in practice, the high computational costs associated with retraining make this process impractical for models already deployed to online environments. This raises a new challenging problem: how to efficiently adapt the learned model to different task requirements by controlling the model parameters after deployment, without the need for retraining. To address this issue, we propose a novel controllable learning approach via \textbf{para}meter \textbf{g}eneration for c\textbf{on}trollable multi-task recommendation (\textbf{Paragon}), which allows the customization and adaptation of recommendation model parameters to new task requirements without retraining. Specifically, we first obtain the optimized model parameters through adapter tunning based on the feasible task requirements. Then, we utilize the generative model as a parameter generator, employing classifier-free guidance in conditional training to learn the distribution of optimized model parameters under various task requirements. Finally, the parameter generator is applied to effectively generate model parameters in a test-time adaptation manner given task requirements. Moreover, Paragon seamlessly integrates with various existing recommendation models to enhance their controllability. Extensive experiments on two public datasets and one commercial dataset demonstrate that Paragon can efficiently generate model parameters instead of retraining, reducing computational time by at least 94.6\%. The code is released at \href{https://github.com/bubble65/Paragon}{https://github.com/bubble65/Paragon}.

### Mixup Model Merge: Enhancing Model Merging Performance through   Randomized Linear Interpolation
**Authors**: Yue Zhou, Yi Chang, Yuan Wu

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T15:35:58Z

**Summary**: Model merging aims to integrate multiple task-specific models into a unified model that inherits the capabilities of the task-specific models, without additional training. Existing model merging methods often lack consideration of the varying contribution ratios of different task-specific models to the final merged model. In this paper, we propose Mixup Model Merge (M3), a simple yet effective method inspired by the randomized linear interpolation strategy from the Mixup data augmentation technique. M3 performs randomized linear interpolation in parameter space between two task-specific LLMs, where interpolation coefficients are sampled from a Beta distribution to explore diverse contribution ratios. This controllable randomness allows M3 to outperform standard equal-ratio merging by discovering better contribution ratio combinations. Extensive experiments show that M3 significantly (1) improves merged LLM performance across tasks, (2) enhances out-of-distribution and adversarial robustness, (3) outperforms the positive effects of the sparsification method DARE on model merging and can be further combined with DARE to achieve superior results, and (4) balances exploration efficiency and diversity in contribution ratios by tuning the Beta distribution's shape parameters. The code is provided in the supplementary materials.

### Meta-rater: A Multi-dimensional Data Selection Method for Pre-training   Language Models
**Authors**: Xinlin Zhuang, Jiahui Peng, Ren Ma, Yinfan Wang, Tianyi Bai, Xingjian Wei, Jiantao Qiu, Chi Zhang, Ying Qian, Conghui He

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T15:34:10Z

**Summary**: The composition of pre-training datasets for large language models (LLMs) remains largely undisclosed, hindering transparency and efforts to optimize data quality, a critical driver of model performance. Current data selection methods, such as natural language quality assessments, diversity-based filters, and classifier-based approaches, are limited by single-dimensional evaluation or redundancy-focused strategies. To address these gaps, we propose four dimensions to evaluate data quality: professionalism, readability, reasoning, and cleanliness. We further introduce Meta-rater,a multi-dimensional data selection method that integrates these dimensions with existing quality metrics through learned optimal weightings. Meta-rater employs proxy models to train a regression model that predicts validation loss, enabling the identification of optimal combinations of quality scores. Experiments demonstrate that Meta-rater doubles convergence speed for 1.3B parameter models and improves downstream task performance by 3.23, with advantages that scale to models as large as 7.2B parameters. Our work establishes that holistic, multi-dimensional quality integration significantly outperforms conventional single-dimension approaches, offering a scalable paradigm for enhancing pre-training efficiency and model capability. To advance future research, we release scripts, data, and models at https://github.com/opendatalab/Meta-rater.

### Non-Terrestrial Network Models Using Stochastic Geometry: Planar or   Spherical?
**Authors**: Ruibo Wang, Baha Eddine Youcef Belmekki, Howard H. Yang, Mohamed Slim Alouini

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T15:29:13Z

**Summary**: With the explosive deployment of non-terrestrial networks (NTNs), the computational complexity of network performance analysis is rapidly escalating. As one of the most suitable mathematical tools for analyzing large-scale network topologies, stochastic geometry (SG) enables the representation of network performance metrics as functions of network parameters, thus offering low-complexity performance analysis solutions. However, choosing between planar and spherical models remains challenging. Planar models neglect Earth's curvature, causing deviations in high-altitude NTN analysis, yet are still often used for simplicity. This paper introduces relative error to quantify the gap between planar and spherical models, helping determine when planar modeling is sufficient. To calculate the relative error, we first propose a point process (PP) generation algorithm that simultaneously generates a pair of homogeneous and asymptotically similar planar and spherical PPs. We then introduce several typical similarity metrics, including topology-related and network-level metrics, and further develop a relative error estimation algorithm based on these metrics. In addition, we derive an analytical expression for the optimal planar altitude, which reduces computational complexity and provides theoretical support for planar approximation. Finally, numerical results investigate how deployment altitude and region affect NTN modeling, with case studies on HAP and LEO satellite constellations.

**Authors**: Tian-Fang Zhao, Wen-Xi Yang, Guan Liu, Liang Yang

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T15:28:04Z

**Summary**: Collaborative partnership matters in inquiry-oriented education. However, most study partners are selected either rely on experience-based assignments with little scientific planning or build on rule-based machine assistants, encountering difficulties in knowledge expansion and inadequate flexibility. This paper proposes an LLM-empowered agent model for simulating and selecting learning partners tailored to inquiry-oriented learning, named InqEduAgent. Generative agents are designed to capture cognitive and evaluative features of learners in real-world scenarios. Then, an adaptive matching algorithm with Gaussian process augmentation is formulated to identify patterns within prior knowledge. Optimal learning-partner matches are provided for learners facing different exercises. The experimental results show the optimal performance of InqEduAgent in most knowledge-learning scenarios and LLM environment with different levels of capabilities. This study promotes the intelligent allocation of human-based learning partners and the formulation of AI-based learning partners. The code, data, and appendix are publicly available at https://github.com/InqEduAgent/InqEduAgent.

### The Dark Side of LLMs: Agent-based Attacks for Complete Computer   Takeover
**Authors**: Matteo Lupinacci, Francesco Aurelio Pironti, Francesco Blefari, Francesco Romeo, Luigi Arena, Angelo Furfaro

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T15:27:03Z

**Summary**: The rapid adoption of Large Language Model (LLM) agents and multi-agent systems enables remarkable capabilities in natural language processing and generation. However, these systems introduce unprecedented security vulnerabilities that extend beyond traditional content generation attacks to system-level compromise. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of the security of LLMs used as reasoning engines within autonomous agents, highlighting how they can be exploited as attack vectors capable of achieving complete computer takeover. We focus on how different attack surfaces and trust boundaries - Direct Prompt Injection, RAG Backdoor, and Inter Agent Trust - can be leveraged to orchestrate such takeovers. We demonstrate that adversaries can effectively coerce popular LLMs (including GPT-4, Claude-4 and Gemini-2.5) into autonomously installing and executing malware on victim machines. Our evaluation of 18 state-of-the-art LLMs reveals an alarming scenario: 94.4% of models succumb to Direct Prompt Injection and 83.3% are vulnerable to the more stealth and evasive RAG Backdoor Attack. Notably, we tested trust boundaries within multi-agent systems, where LLM agents interact and influence each other, and we revealed a critical security flaw: LLMs which successfully resist direct injection or RAG backdoor will execute identical payloads when requested by peer agents. Our findings show that 100.0% of tested LLMs can be compromised through Inter-Agent Trust Exploitation attacks and that every model exhibits context-dependent security behaviors that create exploitable blind spots. Our results also highlight the need to increase awareness and research on the security risks of LLMs, showing a paradigm shift in cybersecurity threats, where AI tools themselves become sophisticated attack vectors.

**Authors**: Zikang Leng, Megha Thukral, Yaqi Liu, Hrudhai Rajasekhar, Shruthi K. Hiremath, Jiaman He, Thomas Plötz

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T15:26:58Z

**Summary**: A major challenge in developing robust and generalizable Human Activity Recognition (HAR) systems for smart homes is the lack of large and diverse labeled datasets. Variations in home layouts, sensor configurations, and individual behaviors further exacerbate this issue. To address this, we leverage the idea of embodied AI agents-virtual agents that perceive and act within simulated environments guided by internal world models. We introduce AgentSense, a virtual data generation pipeline in which agents live out daily routines in simulated smart homes, with behavior guided by Large Language Models (LLMs). The LLM generates diverse synthetic personas and realistic routines grounded in the environment, which are then decomposed into fine-grained actions. These actions are executed in an extended version of the VirtualHome simulator, which we augment with virtual ambient sensors that record the agents' activities. Our approach produces rich, privacy-preserving sensor data that reflects real-world diversity. We evaluate AgentSense on five real HAR datasets. Models pretrained on the generated data consistently outperform baselines, especially in low-resource settings. Furthermore, combining the generated virtual sensor data with a small amount of real data achieves performance comparable to training on full real-world datasets. These results highlight the potential of using LLM-guided embodied agents for scalable and cost-effective sensor data generation in HAR.

### Behaviorally Adaptive Multi-Robot Hazard Localization in Failure-Prone,   Communication-Denied Environments
**Authors**: Alkesh K. Srivastava, Aamodh Suresh, Carlos Nieto-Granda

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T15:23:22Z

**Summary**: We address the challenge of multi-robot autonomous hazard mapping in high-risk, failure-prone, communication-denied environments such as post-disaster zones, underground mines, caves, and planetary surfaces. In these missions, robots must explore and map hazards while minimizing the risk of failure due to environmental threats or hardware limitations. We introduce a behavior-adaptive, information-theoretic planning framework for multi-robot teams grounded in the concept of Behavioral Entropy (BE), that generalizes Shannon entropy (SE) to capture diverse human-like uncertainty evaluations. Building on this formulation, we propose the Behavior-Adaptive Path Planning (BAPP) framework, which modulates information gathering strategies via a tunable risk-sensitivity parameter, and present two planning algorithms: BAPP-TID for intelligent triggering of high-fidelity robots, and BAPP-SIG for safe deployment under high risk. We provide theoretical insights on the informativeness of the proposed BAPP framework and validate its effectiveness through both single-robot and multi-robot simulations. Our results show that the BAPP stack consistently outperforms Shannon-based and random strategies: BAPP-TID accelerates entropy reduction, while BAPP-SIG improves robot survivability with minimal loss in information gain. In multi-agent deployments, BAPP scales effectively through spatial partitioning, mobile base relocation, and role-aware heterogeneity. These findings underscore the value of behavior-adaptive planning for robust, risk-sensitive exploration in complex, failure-prone environments.

### A Survey of Controllable Learning: Methods and Applications in   Information Retrieval
**Authors**: Chenglei Shen, Xiao Zhang, Teng Shi, Changshuo Zhang, Guofu Xie, Jun Xu

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T15:22:29Z

**Summary**: Controllability has become a crucial aspect of trustworthy machine learning, enabling learners to meet predefined targets and adapt dynamically at test time without requiring retraining as the targets shift. We provide a formal definition of controllable learning (CL), and discuss its applications in information retrieval (IR) where information needs are often complex and dynamic. The survey categorizes CL according to what is controllable (e.g., multiple objectives, user portrait, scenario adaptation), who controls (users or platforms), how control is implemented (e.g., rule-based method, Pareto optimization, hypernetwork and others), and where to implement control (e.g., pre-processing, in-processing, post-processing methods). Then, we identify challenges faced by CL across training, evaluation, task setting, and deployment in online environments. Additionally, we outline promising directions for CL in theoretical analysis, efficient computation, empowering large language models, application scenarios and evaluation frameworks.

### LLMs are Single-threaded Reasoners: Demystifying the Working Mechanism   of Soft Thinking
**Authors**: Chünhung Wu, Jinliang Lu, Zixuan Ren, Gangqiang Hu, Zhi Wu, Dai Dai, Hua Wu

**Updated**: 2025-08-07T06:38:21Z

**Summary**: Human cognition naturally engages with abstract and fluid concepts, whereas existing reasoning models often rely on generating discrete tokens, potentially constraining their expressive capabilities. Recent advancements aim to address this limitation by enabling large language models (LLMs) to generate soft, abstract tokens, thus facilitating reasoning within a continuous concept space. This paper explores the `Soft Thinking' capabilities of various LLMs by examining the models' internal behavior using a suite of probing techniques. Contrary to the common belief that Soft Thinking enables the simultaneous exploration of diverse reasoning paths, our findings reveal that LLMs predominantly rely on the most influential component of the soft inputs during subsequent decoding steps. This reliance hinders the exploration of different reasoning paths and reduces vanilla Soft Thinking to a form of greedy decoding, obscuring the advantage of transmitting more information through Soft Tokens. To tackle this issue, we explore sampling strategies to introduce \emph{randomness}, employing methods such as Dirichlet resampling and the Gumbel-Softmax trick. Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating randomness can alleviate the limitations of vanilla approaches and unleash the potential of Soft Thinking. Notably, the Gumbel-Softmax trick provides adequate randomness with controlled smoothness, resulting in superior performance across eight reasoning benchmarks.

### Unveiling the Landscape of Clinical Depression Assessment: From   Behavioral Signatures to Psychiatric Reasoning
**Authors**: Zhuang Chen, Guanqun Bi, Wen Zhang, Jiawei Hu, Aoyun Wang, Xiyao Xiao, Kun Feng, Minlie Huang

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T15:13:24Z

**Summary**: Depression is a widespread mental disorder that affects millions worldwide. While automated depression assessment shows promise, most studies rely on limited or non-clinically validated data, and often prioritize complex model design over real-world effectiveness. In this paper, we aim to unveil the landscape of clinical depression assessment. We introduce C-MIND, a clinical neuropsychiatric multimodal diagnosis dataset collected over two years from real hospital visits. Each participant completes three structured psychiatric tasks and receives a final diagnosis from expert clinicians, with informative audio, video, transcript, and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) signals recorded. Using C-MIND, we first analyze behavioral signatures relevant to diagnosis. We train a range of classical models to quantify how different tasks and modalities contribute to diagnostic performance, and dissect the effectiveness of their combinations. We then explore whether LLMs can perform psychiatric reasoning like clinicians and identify their clear limitations in realistic clinical settings. In response, we propose to guide the reasoning process with clinical expertise and consistently improves LLM diagnostic performance by up to 10% in Macro-F1 score. We aim to build an infrastructure for clinical depression assessment from both data and algorithmic perspectives, enabling C-MIND to facilitate grounded and reliable research for mental healthcare.

### Balancing Stylization and Truth via Disentangled Representation Steering
**Authors**: Chenglei Shen, Zhongxiang Sun, Teng Shi, Xiao Zhang, Jun Xu

**Updated**: 2025-08-07T06:14:50Z

**Summary**: Generating stylized large language model (LLM) responses via representation editing is a promising way for fine-grained output control. However, there exists an inherent trade-off: imposing a distinctive style often degrades truthfulness. Existing representation editing methods, by naively injecting style signals, overlook this collateral impact and frequently contaminate the model's core truthfulness representations, resulting in reduced answer correctness. We term this phenomenon stylization-induced truthfulness collapse. We attribute this issue to latent coupling between style and truth directions in certain key attention heads, and propose StyliTruth, a mechanism that preserves stylization while keeping truthfulness intact. StyliTruth separates the style-relevant and truth-relevant subspaces in the model's representation space via an orthogonal deflation process. This decomposition enables independent control of style and truth in their own subspaces, minimizing interference. By designing adaptive, token-level steering vectors within each subspace, we dynamically and precisely control the generation process to maintain both stylistic fidelity and truthfulness. We validate our method on multiple styles and languages. Extensive experiments and analyses show that StyliTruth significantly reduces stylization-induced truthfulness collapse and outperforms existing inference-time intervention methods in balancing style adherence with truthfulness.

### SLR: Automated Synthesis for Scalable Logical Reasoning
**Authors**: Lukas Helff, Ahmad Omar, Felix Friedrich, Antonia Wüst, Hikaru Shindo, Rupert Mitchell, Tim Woydt, Patrick Schramowski, Wolfgang Stammer, Kristian Kersting

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T15:09:52Z

**Summary**: We introduce SLR, an end-to-end framework for systematic evaluation and training of Large Language Models (LLMs) via Scalable Logical Reasoning. Given a user's task specification, SLR automatically synthesizes (i) an instruction prompt for an inductive reasoning task, (ii) a validation program, executable on model outputs to provide verifiable rewards, and (iii) the latent ground-truth rule. This process is fully automated, scalable, requires no human annotations, and offers precise control over task difficulty. Using SLR, we create SLR-Bench, a benchmark comprising 19k prompts organized into 20 curriculum levels that progressively increase in relational, arithmetic, and recursive complexity. Large-scale evaluation reveals that contemporary LLMs readily produce syntactically valid rules, yet often fail at correct logical inference. Recent reasoning LLMs demonstrate improved performance but incur very high test-time computation, with costs exceeding $300 for just 1,000 prompts. Finally, curriculum learning via SLR doubles Llama-3-8B accuracy on SLR-Bench, achieving parity with Gemini-Flash-Thinking at a fraction of computational cost. Moreover, these reasoning capabilities generalize to a wide range of established benchmarks, underscoring the effectiveness of SLR for downstream reasoning.

### RAIDX: A Retrieval-Augmented Generation and GRPO Reinforcement Learning   Framework for Explainable Deepfake Detection
**Authors**: Tianxiao Li, Zhenglin Huang, Haiquan Wen, Yiwei He, Shuchang Lyu, Baoyuan Wu, Guangliang Cheng

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T15:08:16Z

**Summary**: The rapid advancement of AI-generation models has enabled the creation of hyperrealistic imagery, posing ethical risks through widespread misinformation. Current deepfake detection methods, categorized as face specific detectors or general AI-generated detectors, lack transparency by framing detection as a classification task without explaining decisions. While several LLM-based approaches offer explainability, they suffer from coarse-grained analyses and dependency on labor-intensive annotations. This paper introduces RAIDX (Retrieval-Augmented Image Deepfake Detection and Explainability), a novel deepfake detection framework integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to enhance detection accuracy and decision explainability. Specifically, RAIDX leverages RAG to incorporate external knowledge for improved detection accuracy and employs GRPO to autonomously generate fine-grained textual explanations and saliency maps, eliminating the need for extensive manual annotations. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate RAIDX's effectiveness in identifying real or fake, and providing interpretable rationales in both textual descriptions and saliency maps, achieving state-of-the-art detection performance while advancing transparency in deepfake identification. RAIDX represents the first unified framework to synergize RAG and GRPO, addressing critical gaps in accuracy and explainability. Our code and models will be publicly available.

### ECOLogic: Enabling Circular, Obfuscated, and Adaptive Logic via   eFPGA-Augmented SoCs
**Authors**: Ishraq Tashdid, Dewan Saiham, Nafisa Anjum, Tasnuva Farheen, Sazadur Rahman

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T15:00:06Z

**Summary**: Traditional hardware platforms - ASICs and FPGAs - offer competing trade-offs among performance, flexibility, and sustainability. ASICs provide high efficiency but are inflexible post-fabrication, require costly re-spins for updates, and expose IPs to piracy risks. FPGAs offer reconfigurability and reuse, yet suffer from substantial area, power, and performance overheads, resulting in higher carbon footprints. We present ECOLogic, a hybrid design paradigm that embeds lightweight eFPGA fabric within ASICs to enable secure, updatable, and resource-aware computation. Central to this architecture is ECOScore, a quantitative scoring framework that evaluates IPs based on adaptability, piracy threat, performance tolerance, and resource fit to guide RTL partitioning. Evaluated across six diverse SoC modules, ECOLogic retains an average of 90 percent ASIC-level performance (up to 2 GHz), achieves 9.8 ns timing slack (versus 5.1 ns in FPGA), and reduces power by 480 times on average. Moreover, sustainability analysis shows a 99.7 percent reduction in deployment carbon footprint and 300 to 500 times lower emissions relative to FPGA-only implementations. These results position ECOLogic as a high-performance, secure, and environmentally sustainable solution for next-generation reconfigurable systems.

**Authors**: Haodong Zhu, Changbai Li, Yangyang Ren, Zichao Feng, Xuhui Liu, Hanlin Chen, Xiantong Zhen, Baochang Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T14:53:42Z

**Summary**: Current multi-view 3D reconstruction methods rely on accurate camera calibration and pose estimation, requiring complex and time-intensive pre-processing that hinders their practical deployment. To address this challenge, we introduce Surf3R, an end-to-end feedforward approach that reconstructs 3D surfaces from sparse views without estimating camera poses and completes an entire scene in under 10 seconds. Our method employs a multi-branch and multi-view decoding architecture in which multiple reference views jointly guide the reconstruction process. Through the proposed branch-wise processing, cross-view attention, and inter-branch fusion, the model effectively captures complementary geometric cues without requiring camera calibration. Moreover, we introduce a D-Normal regularizer based on an explicit 3D Gaussian representation for surface reconstruction. It couples surface normals with other geometric parameters to jointly optimize the 3D geometry, significantly improving 3D consistency and surface detail accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that Surf3R achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple surface reconstruction metrics on ScanNet++ and Replica datasets, exhibiting excellent generalization and efficiency.

### From Sufficiency to Reflection: Reinforcement-Guided Thinking Quality in   Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning for LLMs
**Authors**: Jie He, Victor Gutiérrez-Basulto, Jeff Z. Pan

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T14:53:31Z

**Summary**: Reinforcement learning-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods enhance the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). However, most rely only on final-answer rewards, overlooking intermediate reasoning quality. This paper analyzes existing RAG reasoning models and identifies three main failure patterns: (1) information insufficiency, meaning the model fails to retrieve adequate support; (2) faulty reasoning, where logical or content-level flaws appear despite sufficient information; and (3) answer-reasoning inconsistency, where a valid reasoning chain leads to a mismatched final answer. We propose TIRESRAG-R1, a novel framework using a think-retrieve-reflect process and a multi-dimensional reward system to improve reasoning and stability. TIRESRAG-R1 introduces: (1) a sufficiency reward to encourage thorough retrieval; (2) a reasoning quality reward to assess the rationality and accuracy of the reasoning chain; and (3) a reflection reward to detect and revise errors. It also employs a difficulty-aware reweighting strategy and training sample filtering to boost performance on complex tasks. Experiments on four multi-hop QA datasets show that TIRESRAG-R1 outperforms prior RAG methods and generalizes well to single-hop tasks. The code and data are available at: https://github.com/probe2/TIRESRAG-R1.

### Causal Reflection with Language Models
**Authors**: Abi Aryan, Zac Liu

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T14:44:23Z

**Summary**: While LLMs exhibit impressive fluency and factual recall, they struggle with robust causal reasoning, often relying on spurious correlations and brittle patterns. Similarly, traditional Reinforcement Learning agents also lack causal understanding, optimizing for rewards without modeling why actions lead to outcomes. We introduce Causal Reflection, a framework that explicitly models causality as a dynamic function over state, action, time, and perturbation, enabling agents to reason about delayed and nonlinear effects. Additionally, we define a formal Reflect mechanism that identifies mismatches between predicted and observed outcomes and generates causal hypotheses to revise the agent's internal model. In this architecture, LLMs serve not as black-box reasoners, but as structured inference engines translating formal causal outputs into natural language explanations and counterfactuals. Our framework lays the theoretical groundwork for Causal Reflective agents that can adapt, self-correct, and communicate causal understanding in evolving environments.

### QuantVSR: Low-Bit Post-Training Quantization for Real-World Video   Super-Resolution
**Authors**: Bowen Chai, Zheng Chen, Libo Zhu, Wenbo Li, Yong Guo, Yulun Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T14:35:59Z

**Summary**: Diffusion models have shown superior performance in real-world video super-resolution (VSR). However, the slow processing speeds and heavy resource consumption of diffusion models hinder their practical application and deployment. Quantization offers a potential solution for compressing the VSR model. Nevertheless, quantizing VSR models is challenging due to their temporal characteristics and high fidelity requirements. To address these issues, we propose QuantVSR, a low-bit quantization model for real-world VSR. We propose a spatio-temporal complexity aware (STCA) mechanism, where we first utilize the calibration dataset to measure both spatial and temporal complexities for each layer. Based on these statistics, we allocate layer-specific ranks to the low-rank full-precision (FP) auxiliary branch. Subsequently, we jointly refine the FP and low-bit branches to achieve simultaneous optimization. In addition, we propose a learnable bias alignment (LBA) module to reduce the biased quantization errors. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method obtains comparable performance with the FP model and significantly outperforms recent leading low-bit quantization methods. Code is available at: https://github.com/bowenchai/QuantVSR.

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T14:33:45Z

**Summary**: The dream to create AI assistants as capable and versatile as the fictional J.A.R.V.I.S from Iron Man has long captivated imaginations. With the evolution of (multi-modal) large language models ((M)LLMs), this dream is closer to reality, as (M)LLM-based Agents using computing devices (e.g., computers and mobile phones) by operating within the environments and interfaces (e.g., Graphical User Interface (GUI)) provided by operating systems (OS) to automate tasks have significantly advanced. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of these advanced agents, designated as OS Agents. We begin by elucidating the fundamentals of OS Agents, exploring their key components including the environment, observation space, and action space, and outlining essential capabilities such as understanding, planning, and grounding. We then examine methodologies for constructing OS Agents, focusing on domain-specific foundation models and agent frameworks. A detailed review of evaluation protocols and benchmarks highlights how OS Agents are assessed across diverse tasks. Finally, we discuss current challenges and identify promising directions for future research, including safety and privacy, personalization and self-evolution. This survey aims to consolidate the state of OS Agents research, providing insights to guide both academic inquiry and industrial development. An open-source GitHub repository is maintained as a dynamic resource to foster further innovation in this field. We present a 9-page version of our work, accepted by ACL 2025, to provide a concise overview to the domain.

### TRAIL: Joint Inference and Refinement of Knowledge Graphs with Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Xinkui Zhao, Haode Li, Yifan Zhang, Guanjie Cheng, Yueshen Xu

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T14:25:05Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have unlocked powerful reasoning and decision-making capabilities. However, their inherent dependence on static parametric memory fundamentally limits their adaptability, factual accuracy, and interpretability in knowledge-intensive scenarios. Knowledge graphs (KGs), as structured repositories of explicit relational knowledge, offer a promising approach for augmenting LLMs with external, interpretable memory. Nevertheless, most existing methods that combine LLMs with KGs treat reasoning and knowledge updating as separate processes, resulting in suboptimal utilization of new information and hindering real-time updates. In this work, we propose TRAIL: a novel, unified framework for Thinking, Reasoning, And Incremental Learning that couples joint inference and dynamic KG refinement with large language models. TRAIL enables LLM agents to iteratively explore, update, and refine knowledge graphs during the reasoning process, employing a confidence-driven mechanism for the generation, validation, and pruning of new facts. This plug-and-play architecture facilitates seamless integration with various LLMs, supporting continual adaptation without the need for retraining. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that TRAIL outperforms existing KG-augmented and retrieval-augmented LLM baselines by 3% to 13%. More importantly, these results represent a significant step toward developing adaptive, memory-augmented language models capable of continual learning and reliable, transparent reasoning.

### FrEVL: Leveraging Frozen Pretrained Embeddings for Efficient   Vision-Language Understanding
**Authors**: Emmanuelle Bourigault, Pauline Bourigault

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T14:12:05Z

**Summary**: The deployment of vision-language models remains constrained by substantial computational requirements. We present \textbf{FrEVL}, a framework exploring whether frozen pretrained embeddings can support effective vision-language understanding. Our analysis reveals that frozen embeddings contain rich information for discriminative tasks, achieving 85\% to 95\% of state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks with only 68.4M trainable parameters. This performance dichotomy reveals a critical insight: frozen embedding effectiveness depends on alignment between pretraining objectives and downstream task requirements. When accounting for end-to-end computation including embedding extraction, FrEVL provides $2.3\times$ speedup with 52\% lower energy consumption, making it suitable for scenarios with pre-computable inputs or when deployment constraints outweigh marginal performance gains. Our evaluation provides practitioners with guidance on when frozen embedding approaches represent viable alternatives to full model deployment. We will release our complete implementation and evaluation framework to facilitate further research into efficient multi-modal understanding.

### CARD: Cache-Assisted Parallel Speculative Decoding for Efficient Large   Language Model Inference
**Authors**: Enyu Zhou, Kai Sheng, Hao Chen, Xin He

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T14:02:10Z

**Summary**: Speculative decoding (SD), where an extra draft model first provides multiple draft tokens and the original target model then verifies these tokens in parallel, has shown great power for LLM inference acceleration. However, existing SD methods must adhere to the 'draft-then-verify' paradigm, which forces drafting and verification processes to execute sequentially during SD, resulting in inefficient inference performance and limiting the size of the draft model. Furthermore, once a single token in the candidate sequence is rejected during the drafting process, all subsequent candidate tokens must be discarded, leading to inefficient drafting. To address these challenges, we propose a cache-based parallel speculative decoding framework employing a 'query-and-correct' paradigm. Specifically, CARD decouples drafting and verification: the draft model generates candidate tokens to populate a shared cache, while the target model concurrently rectifies the draft model's generation direction. This effectively enables the target model to perform inference at speed approaching that of the draft model. Our approach achieves up to 4.83 speedup over vanilla decoding without requiring fine-tuning of either the draft or target models. Our code is available at https://github.com/hunzhizi/CARD.

### From "Aha Moments" to Controllable Thinking: Toward Meta-Cognitive   Reasoning in Large Reasoning Models via Decoupled Reasoning and Control
**Authors**: Rui Ha, Chaozhuo Li, Rui Pu, Sen Su

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T13:59:17Z

**Summary**: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated a latent capacity for complex reasoning by spontaneously exhibiting cognitive behaviors such as step-by-step reasoning, reflection, and backtracking, commonly referred to as "Aha Moments". However, such emergent behaviors remain unregulated and uncontrolled, often resulting in overthinking, where the model continues generating redundant reasoning content even after reaching reliable conclusions. This leads to excessive computational costs and increased latency, limiting the practical deployment of LRMs. The root cause lies in the absence of intrinsic regulatory mechanisms, as current models are unable to monitor and adaptively manage their reasoning process to determine when to continue, backtrack, or terminate. To address this issue, we propose the Meta-cognitive Reasoning Framework (MERA), which explicitly decouples the thinking process into distinct reasoning and control components, thereby enabling the independent optimization of control strategies. Specifically, MERA incorporates a takeover-based data construction mechanism that identifies critical decision points during reasoning and delegates the creation of control signals to auxiliary LLMs, thereby enabling the construction of high-quality reasoning-control data. Additionally, a structured reasoning-control separation is implemented via supervised fine-tuning, enabling the model to generate explicit traces and acquire initial meta-cognitive control capabilities. Finally, MERA employs Control-Segment Policy Optimization (CSPO), which combines segment-wise Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a control-masking mechanism to optimize control behavior learning while minimizing interference from irrelevant content. Experiments on various reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that models trained with MERA enhance both reasoning efficiency and accuracy.

### Benchmarking Uncertainty and its Disentanglement in multi-label Chest   X-Ray Classification
**Authors**: Simon Baur, Wojciech Samek, Jackie Ma

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T13:58:17Z

**Summary**: Reliable uncertainty quantification is crucial for trustworthy decision-making and the deployment of AI models in medical imaging. While prior work has explored the ability of neural networks to quantify predictive, epistemic, and aleatoric uncertainties using an information-theoretical approach in synthetic or well defined data settings like natural image classification, its applicability to real life medical diagnosis tasks remains underexplored. In this study, we provide an extensive uncertainty quantification benchmark for multi-label chest X-ray classification using the MIMIC-CXR-JPG dataset. We evaluate 13 uncertainty quantification methods for convolutional (ResNet) and transformer-based (Vision Transformer) architectures across a wide range of tasks. Additionally, we extend Evidential Deep Learning, HetClass NNs, and Deep Deterministic Uncertainty to the multi-label setting. Our analysis provides insights into uncertainty estimation effectiveness and the ability to disentangle epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties, revealing method- and architecture-specific strengths and limitations.

### Automatic LLM Red Teaming
**Authors**: Roman Belaire, Arunesh Sinha, Pradeep Varakantham

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T13:52:00Z

**Summary**: Red teaming is critical for identifying vulnerabilities and building trust in current LLMs. However, current automated methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on brittle prompt templates or single-turn attacks, failing to capture the complex, interactive nature of real-world adversarial dialogues. We propose a novel paradigm: training an AI to strategically `break' another AI. By formalizing red teaming as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and employing a hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework, we effectively address the inherent sparse reward and long-horizon challenges. Our generative agent learns coherent, multi-turn attack strategies through a fine-grained, token-level harm reward, enabling it to uncover subtle vulnerabilities missed by existing baselines. This approach sets a new state-of-the-art, fundamentally reframing LLM red teaming as a dynamic, trajectory-based process (rather than a one-step test) essential for robust AI deployment.

### Large Language Models Versus Static Code Analysis Tools: A Systematic   Benchmark for Vulnerability Detection
**Authors**: Damian Gnieciak, Tomasz Szandala

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T13:48:38Z

**Summary**: Modern software relies on a multitude of automated testing and quality assurance tools to prevent errors, bugs and potential vulnerabilities. This study sets out to provide a head-to-head, quantitative and qualitative evaluation of six automated approaches: three industry-standard rule-based static code-analysis tools (SonarQube, CodeQL and Snyk Code) and three state-of-the-art large language models hosted on the GitHub Models platform (GPT-4.1, Mistral Large and DeepSeek V3). Using a curated suite of ten real-world C# projects that embed 63 vulnerabilities across common categories such as SQL injection, hard-coded secrets and outdated dependencies, we measure classical detection accuracy (precision, recall, F-score), analysis latency, and the developer effort required to vet true positives. The language-based scanners achieve higher mean F-1 scores,0.797, 0.753 and 0.750, than their static counterparts, which score 0.260, 0.386 and 0.546, respectively. LLMs' advantage originates from superior recall, confirming an ability to reason across broader code contexts. However, this benefit comes with substantial trade-offs: DeepSeek V3 exhibits the highest false-positive ratio, all language models mislocate issues at line-or-column granularity due to tokenisation artefacts. Overall, language models successfully rival traditional static analysers in finding real vulnerabilities. Still, their noisier output and imprecise localisation limit their standalone use in safety-critical audits. We therefore recommend a hybrid pipeline: employ language models early in development for broad, context-aware triage, while reserving deterministic rule-based scanners for high-assurance verification. The open benchmark and JSON-based result harness released with this paper lay a foundation for reproducible, practitioner-centric research into next-generation automated code security.

### Automatically Interpreting Millions of Features in Large Language Models
**Authors**: Gonçalo Paulo, Alex Mallen, Caden Juang, Nora Belrose

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T13:47:10Z

**Summary**: While the activations of neurons in deep neural networks usually do not have a simple human-understandable interpretation, sparse autoencoders (SAEs) can be used to transform these activations into a higher-dimensional latent space which may be more easily interpretable. However, these SAEs can have millions of distinct latent features, making it infeasible for humans to manually interpret each one. In this work, we build an open-source automated pipeline to generate and evaluate natural language explanations for SAE features using LLMs. We test our framework on SAEs of varying sizes, activation functions, and losses, trained on two different open-weight LLMs. We introduce five new techniques to score the quality of explanations that are cheaper to run than the previous state of the art. One of these techniques, intervention scoring, evaluates the interpretability of the effects of intervening on a feature, which we find explains features that are not recalled by existing methods. We propose guidelines for generating better explanations that remain valid for a broader set of activating contexts, and discuss pitfalls with existing scoring techniques. We use our explanations to measure the semantic similarity of independently trained SAEs, and find that SAEs trained on nearby layers of the residual stream are highly similar. Our large-scale analysis confirms that SAE latents are indeed much more interpretable than neurons, even when neurons are sparsified using top-$k$ postprocessing. Our code is available at https://github.com/EleutherAI/sae-auto-interp, and our explanations are available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/EleutherAI/auto_interp_explanations.

### SCAN-BEST: Sub-6GHz-Aided Near-field Beam Selection with Formal   Reliability Guarantees
**Authors**: Weicao Deng, Binpu Shi, Min Li, Osvaldo Simeone

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T13:47:10Z

**Summary**: As millimeter-wave (mmWave) MIMO systems adopt larger antenna arrays, near-field propagation becomes increasingly prominent, especially for users close to the transmitter. Traditional far-field beam training methods become inadequate, while near-field training faces the challenge of large codebooks due to the need to resolve both angular and distance domains. To reduce in-band training overhead, prior work has proposed to leverage the spatial-temporal congruence between sub-6 GHz (sub-6G) and mmWave channels to predict the best mmWave beam within a near-field codebook from sub-6G channel estimates. To cope with the uncertainty caused by sub-6G/mmWave differences, we introduce a novel Sub-6G Channel Aided Near-field BEam SelecTion (SCAN-BEST) framework that wraps around any beam predictor to produce candidate beam subset with formal suboptimality guarantees. The proposed SCAN-BEST builds on conformal risk control (CRC), and is calibrated offline using limited calibration data. Its performance guarantees apply even in the presence of statistical shifts between calibration and deployment. Numerical results validate the theoretical properties and efficiency of SCAN-BEST.

### Inside-Out: Hidden Factual Knowledge in LLMs
**Authors**: Zorik Gekhman, Eyal Ben David, Hadas Orgad, Eran Ofek, Yonatan Belinkov, Idan Szpektor, Jonathan Herzig, Roi Reichart

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T13:42:41Z

**Summary**: This work presents a framework for assessing whether large language models (LLMs) encode more factual knowledge in their parameters than what they express in their outputs. While a few studies hint at this possibility, none has clearly defined or demonstrated this phenomenon. We first propose a formal definition of knowledge, quantifying it for a given question as the fraction of correct-incorrect answer pairs where the correct one is ranked higher. This gives rise to external and internal knowledge, depending on the information used to score individual answer candidates: either the model's observable token-level probabilities or its intermediate computations. Hidden knowledge arises when internal knowledge exceeds external knowledge. We then present a case study, applying this framework to three popular open-weights LLMs in a closed-book QA setup. Our results indicate that: (1) LLMs consistently encode more factual knowledge internally than what they express externally, with an average relative gap of 40%. (2) Surprisingly, some knowledge is so deeply hidden that a model can internally know an answer perfectly, yet fail to generate it even once, despite large-scale repeated sampling of 1,000 answers. This reveals fundamental limitations in the generation capabilities of LLMs, which (3) put a practical constraint on scaling test-time compute via repeated answer sampling in closed-book QA: significant performance improvements remain inaccessible because some answers are practically never sampled, yet if they were, we would be guaranteed to rank them first.

### Automated Generation of Curriculum-Aligned Multiple-Choice Questions for   Malaysian Secondary Mathematics Using Generative AI
**Authors**: Rohaizah Abdul Wahid, Muhamad Said Nizamuddin Nadim, Suliana Sulaiman, Syahmi Akmal Shaharudin, Muhammad Danial Jupikil, Iqqwan Jasman Su Azlan Su

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T13:30:51Z

**Summary**: This paper addresses the critical need for scalable and high-quality educational assessment tools within the Malaysian education system. It highlights the potential of Generative AI (GenAI) while acknowledging the significant challenges of ensuring factual accuracy and curriculum alignment, especially for low-resource languages like Bahasa Melayu. This research introduces and compares four incremental pipelines for generating Form 1 Mathematics multiple-choice questions (MCQs) in Bahasa Melayu using OpenAI's GPT-4o. The methods range from non-grounded prompting (structured and basic) to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches (one using the LangChain framework, one implemented manually). The system is grounded in official curriculum documents, including teacher-prepared notes and the yearly teaching plan (RPT). A dual-pronged automated evaluation framework is employed to assess the generated questions. Curriculum alignment is measured using Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) against the RPT, while contextual validity is verified through a novel RAG-based Question-Answering (RAG-QA) method. The results demonstrate that RAG-based pipelines significantly outperform non-grounded prompting methods, producing questions with higher curriculum alignment and factual validity. The study further analyzes the trade-offs between the ease of implementation of framework-based RAG and the fine-grained control offered by a manual pipeline. This work presents a validated methodology for generating curriculum-specific educational content in a low-resource language, introduces a symbiotic RAG-QA evaluation technique, and provides actionable insights for the development and deployment of practical EdTech solutions in Malaysia and similar regions.

### StepFun-Formalizer: Unlocking the Autoformalization Potential of LLMs   through Knowledge-Reasoning Fusion
**Authors**: Yutong Wu, Di Huang, Ruosi Wan, Yue Peng, Shijie Shang, Chenrui Cao, Lei Qi, Rui Zhang, Zidong Du, Jie Yan, Xing Hu

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T13:28:22Z

**Summary**: Autoformalization aims to translate natural-language mathematical statements into a formal language. While LLMs have accelerated progress in this area, existing methods still suffer from low accuracy. We identify two key abilities for effective autoformalization: comprehensive mastery of formal-language domain knowledge, and reasoning capability of natural language problem understanding and informal-formal alignment. Without the former, a model cannot identify the correct formal objects; without the latter, it struggles to interpret real-world contexts and map them precisely into formal expressions. To address these gaps, we introduce ThinkingF, a data synthesis and training pipeline that improves both abilities. First, we construct two datasets: one by distilling and selecting large-scale examples rich in formal knowledge, and another by generating informal-to-formal reasoning trajectories guided by expert-designed templates. We then apply SFT and RLVR with these datasets to further fuse and refine the two abilities. The resulting 7B and 32B models exhibit both comprehensive formal knowledge and strong informal-to-formal reasoning. Notably, StepFun-Formalizer-32B achieves SOTA BEq@1 scores of 40.5% on FormalMATH-Lite and 26.7% on ProverBench, surpassing all prior general-purpose and specialized models.

### TofuML: A Spatio-Physical Interactive Machine Learning Device for   Interactive Exploration of Machine Learning for Novices
**Authors**: Wataru Kawabe, Hiroto Fukuda, Akihisa Shitara, Yuri Nakao, Yusuke Sugano

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T13:27:07Z

**Summary**: We introduce TofuML, an interactive system designed to make machine learning (ML) concepts more accessible and engaging for non-expert users. Unlike conventional GUI-based systems, TofuML employs a physical and spatial interface consisting of a small device and a paper mat, allowing users to train and evaluate sound classification models through intuitive, toy-like interactions. Through two user studies -- a comparative study against a GUI-based version and a public event deployment -- we investigated how TofuML impacts users' engagement in the ML model creation process, their ability to provide appropriate training data, and their conception of potential applications. Our results indicated that TofuML enhanced user engagement compared to a GUI while lowering barriers for non-experts to engage with ML. Users demonstrated creativity in conceiving diverse ML applications, revealing opportunities to optimize between conceptual understanding and user engagement. These findings contribute to developing interactive ML systems/frameworks designed for a wide range of users.

### Prompt Obfuscation for Large Language Models
**Authors**: David Pape, Sina Mavali, Thorsten Eisenhofer, Lea Schönherr

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T13:24:09Z

**Summary**: System prompts that include detailed instructions to describe the task performed by the underlying LLM can easily transform foundation models into tools and services with minimal overhead. They are often considered intellectual property, similar to the code of a software product, because of their crucial impact on the utility. However, extracting system prompts is easily possible. As of today, there is no effective countermeasure to prevent the stealing of system prompts, and all safeguarding efforts could be evaded. In this work, we propose an alternative to conventional system prompts. We introduce prompt obfuscation to prevent the extraction of the system prompt with little overhead. The core idea is to find a representation of the original system prompt that leads to the same functionality, while the obfuscated system prompt does not contain any information that allows conclusions to be drawn about the original system prompt. We evaluate our approach by comparing our obfuscated prompt output with the output of the original prompt, using eight distinct metrics to measure the lexical, character-level, and semantic similarity. We show that the obfuscated version is constantly on par with the original one. We further perform three different deobfuscation attacks with varying attacker knowledge--covering both black-box and white-box conditions--and show that in realistic attack scenarios an attacker is unable to extract meaningful information. Overall, we demonstrate that prompt obfuscation is an effective mechanism to safeguard the intellectual property of a system prompt while maintaining the same utility as the original prompt.

### GenEDA: Towards Generative Netlist Functional Reasoning via Cross-Modal   Circuit Encoder-Decoder Alignment
**Authors**: Wenji Fang, Jing Wang, Yao Lu, Shang Liu, Zhiyao Xie

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T13:21:11Z

**Summary**: The success of foundation AI has motivated the research of circuit foundation models, which are customized to assist the integrated circuit (IC) design process. However, existing pre-trained circuit foundation models are typically limited to standalone encoders for predictive tasks or decoders for generative tasks. These two model types are developed independently, operate on different circuit modalities, and reside in separate latent spaces. This restricts their ability to complement each other for more advanced capabilities. In this work, we present GenEDA, the first framework that cross-modally aligns circuit encoders with decoders within a shared latent space. GenEDA bridges the gap between graph-based circuit representation learning and text-based large language models (LLMs), enabling communication between their respective latent spaces. To achieve the alignment, we propose two paradigms to support both open-source trainable LLMs and commercial frozen LLMs. We leverage this aligned architecture to develop the first generative foundation model for netlists, unleashing LLMs' generative reasoning capability on the low-level and bit-blasted netlists. GenEDA enables three unprecedented generative netlist functional reasoning tasks, where it reversely generates high-level functionalities such as specifications and RTL code from low-level netlists. These tasks move beyond traditional gate function classification to direct generation of full-circuit functionality. Experiments demonstrate that GenEDA significantly boosts advanced LLMs' (e.g., GPT and DeepSeek series) performance in all tasks.

### \textsc{SimInstruct}: A Responsible Tool for Collecting Scaffolding   Dialogues Between Experts and LLM-Simulated Novices
**Authors**: Si Chen, Izzy Molnar, Ting Hua, Peiyu Li, Le Huy Khiem, G. Alex Ambrose, Jim Lang, Ronald Metoyer, Nitesh V. Chawla

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T13:16:10Z

**Summary**: High-quality, multi-turn instructional dialogues between novices and experts are essential for developing AI systems that support teaching, learning, and decision-making. These dialogues often involve scaffolding -- the process by which an expert supports a novice's thinking through questions, feedback, and step-by-step guidance. However, such data are scarce due to privacy concerns in recording and the vulnerability inherent in help-seeking. We present SimInstruct, a scalable, expert-in-the-loop tool for collecting scaffolding dialogues. Using teaching development coaching as an example domain, SimInstruct simulates novice instructors via LLMs, varying their teaching challenges and LLM's persona traits, while human experts provide multi-turn feedback, reasoning, and instructional support. This design enables the creation of realistic, pedagogically rich dialogues without requiring real novice participants. Our results reveal that persona traits, such as extroversion and introversion, meaningfully influence how experts engage. Compared to real mentoring recordings, SimInstruct dialogues demonstrate comparable pedagogical relevance and cognitive depth. Experts also reported the process as engaging and reflective, improving both data quality and their own professional insight. We further fine-tuned a LLaMA model to be an expert model using the augmented dataset, which outperformed GPT-4o in instructional quality. Our analysis highlights GPT-4o's limitations in weak reflective questioning, overuse of generic praise, a condescending tone, and a tendency to overwhelm novices with excessive suggestions.

### Efficient Unsupervised Domain Adaptation Regression for Spatial-Temporal   Sensor Fusion
**Authors**: Keivan Faghih Niresi, Ismail Nejjar, Olga Fink

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T13:15:20Z

**Summary**: The growing deployment of low-cost, distributed sensor networks in environmental and biomedical domains has enabled continuous, large-scale health monitoring. However, these systems often face challenges related to degraded data quality caused by sensor drift, noise, and insufficient calibration -- factors that limit their reliability in real-world applications. Traditional machine learning methods for sensor fusion and calibration rely on extensive feature engineering and struggle to capture spatial-temporal dependencies or adapt to distribution shifts across varying deployment conditions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) method tailored for regression tasks. Our proposed method integrates effectively with Spatial-Temporal Graph Neural Networks and leverages the alignment of perturbed inverse Gram matrices between source and target domains, drawing inspiration from Tikhonov regularization. This approach enables scalable and efficient domain adaptation without requiring labeled data in the target domain. We validate our novel method on real-world datasets from two distinct applications: air quality monitoring and EEG signal reconstruction. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance which paves the way for more robust and transferable sensor fusion models in both environmental and physiological contexts. Our code is available at https://github.com/EPFL-IMOS/TikUDA.

### Evaluating, Synthesizing, and Enhancing for Customer Support   Conversation
**Authors**: Jie Zhu, Huaixia Dou, Junhui Li, Lifan Guo, Feng Chen, Chi Zhang, Fang Kong

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T13:11:17Z

**Summary**: Effective customer support requires not only accurate problem solving but also structured and empathetic communication aligned with professional standards. However, existing dialogue datasets often lack strategic guidance, and real-world service data is difficult to access and annotate. To address this, we introduce the task of Customer Support Conversation (CSC), aimed at training customer service agents to respond using well-defined support strategies. We propose a structured CSC framework grounded in COPC guidelines, defining five conversational stages and twelve strategies to guide high-quality interactions. Based on this, we construct CSConv, an evaluation dataset of 1,855 real-world customer-agent conversations rewritten using LLMs to reflect deliberate strategy use, and annotated accordingly. Additionally, we develop a role-playing approach that simulates strategy-rich conversations using LLM-powered roles aligned with the CSC framework, resulting in the training dataset RoleCS. Experiments show that fine-tuning strong LLMs on RoleCS significantly improves their ability to generate high-quality, strategy-aligned responses on CSConv. Human evaluations further confirm gains in problem resolution. All code and data will be made publicly available at https://github.com/aliyun/qwen-dianjin.

### RTLCoder: Outperforming GPT-3.5 in Design RTL Generation with Our   Open-Source Dataset and Lightweight Solution
**Authors**: Shang Liu, Wenji Fang, Yao Lu, Qijun Zhang, Hongce Zhang, Zhiyao Xie

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T13:02:31Z

**Summary**: The automatic generation of RTL code (e.g., Verilog) using natural language instructions and large language models (LLMs) has attracted significant research interest recently. However, most existing approaches heavily rely on commercial LLMs such as ChatGPT, while open-source LLMs tailored for this specific design generation task exhibit notably inferior performance. The absence of high-quality open-source solutions restricts the flexibility and data privacy of this emerging technique. In this study, we present a new customized LLM solution with a modest parameter count of only 7B, achieving better performance than GPT-3.5 on all representative benchmarks for RTL code generation. Especially, it outperforms GPT-4 in VerilogEval Machine benchmark. This remarkable balance between accuracy and efficiency is made possible by leveraging our new RTL code dataset and a customized LLM algorithm, both of which have been made fully open-source.

### Beyond Pixels: Exploring DOM Downsampling for LLM-Based Web Agents
**Authors**: Thassilo M. Schiepanski, Nicholas Piël

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T12:56:54Z

**Summary**: Frontier LLMs only recently enabled serviceable, autonomous web agents. At that, a model poses as an instantaneous domain model backend. Ought to suggest interaction, it is consulted with a web-based task and respective application state. The key problem lies in application state serialisation $\unicode{x2013}$ referred to as snapshot. State-of-the-art web agents are premised on grounded GUI snapshots, i.e., screenshots enhanced with visual cues. Not least to resemble human perception, but for images representing relatively cheap means of model input. LLM vision still lag behind code interpretation capabilities. DOM snapshots, which structurally resemble HTML, impose a desired alternative. Vast model input token size, however, disables reliable implementation with web agents to date.   We propose D2Snap, a first-of-its-kind DOM downsampling algorithm. Based on a GPT-4o backend, we evaluate D2Snap on tasks sampled from the Online-Mind2Web dataset. The success rate of D2Snap-downsampled DOM snapshots (67%) matches a grounded GUI snapshot baseline (65%) $\unicode{x2013}$ within the same input token order of magnitude (1e3). Our best evaluated configurations $\unicode{x2013}$ one token order above, but within the model's context window $\unicode{x2013}$ outperform this baseline by 8%. Our evaluation, moreover, yields that DOM-inherent hierarchy embodies a strong UI feature for LLMs.

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T12:55:44Z

**Summary**: As our understanding of autism and ableism continues to increase, so does our understanding of ableist language towards autistic people. Such language poses a significant challenge in NLP research due to its subtle and context-dependent nature. Yet, detecting anti-autistic ableist language remains underexplored, with existing NLP tools often failing to capture its nuanced expressions. We present AUTALIC, the first benchmark dataset dedicated to the detection of anti-autistic ableist language in context, addressing a significant gap in the field. The dataset comprises 2,400 autism-related sentences collected from Reddit, accompanied by surrounding context, and is annotated by trained experts with backgrounds in neurodiversity. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals that current language models, including state-of-the-art LLMs, struggle to reliably identify anti-autistic ableism and align with human judgments, underscoring their limitations in this domain. We publicly release AUTALIC along with the individual annotations which serve as a valuable resource to researchers working on ableism, neurodiversity, and also studying disagreements in annotation tasks. This dataset serves as a crucial step towards developing more inclusive and context-aware NLP systems that better reflect diverse perspectives.

### What Lives? A meta-analysis of diverse opinions on the definition of   life
**Authors**: Reed Bender, Karina Kofman, Blaise Agüera y Arcas, Michael Levin

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T12:47:41Z

**Summary**: The question of "what is life?" has challenged scientists and philosophers for centuries, producing an array of definitions that reflect both the mystery of its emergence and the diversity of disciplinary perspectives brought to bear on the question. Despite significant progress in our understanding of biological systems, psychology, computation, and information theory, no single definition for life has yet achieved universal acceptance. This challenge becomes increasingly urgent as advances in synthetic biology, artificial intelligence, and astrobiology challenge our traditional conceptions of what it means to be alive. We undertook a methodological approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) to analyze a set of definitions of life provided by a curated set of cross-disciplinary experts. We used a novel pairwise correlation analysis to map the definitions into distinct feature vectors, followed by agglomerative clustering, intra-cluster semantic analysis, and t-SNE projection to reveal underlying conceptual archetypes. This methodology revealed a continuous landscape of the themes relating to the definition of life, suggesting that what has historically been approached as a binary taxonomic problem should be instead conceived as differentiated perspectives within a unified conceptual latent space. We offer a new methodological bridge between reductionist and holistic approaches to fundamental questions in science and philosophy, demonstrating how computational semantic analysis can reveal conceptual patterns across disciplinary boundaries, and opening similar pathways for addressing other contested definitional territories across the sciences.

### FlexQ: Efficient Post-training INT6 Quantization for LLM Serving via   Algorithm-System Co-Design
**Authors**: Hao Zhang, Aining Jia, Weifeng Bu, Yushu Cai, Kai Sheng, Hao Chen, Xin He

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T12:47:05Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional performance but entail significant memory and computational costs, restricting their practical deployment. While existing INT4/INT8 quantization reduces these costs, they often degrade accuracy or lack optimal efficiency. INT6 quantization offers a superior trade-off between model accuracy and inference efficiency, but lacks hardware support in modern GPUs, forcing emulation via higher-precision arithmetic units that limit acceleration.   In this paper, we propose FlexQ, a novel post-training INT6 quantization framework combining algorithmic innovation with system-level optimizations. FlexQ employs uniform 6-bit weight quantization across all layers, with adaptive retention of 8-bit activations in layers identified through layer-wise sensitivity analysis. To maximize hardware efficiency, we develop a specialized high-performance GPU kernel supporting matrix multiplication for W6A6 and W6A8 representations via Binary Tensor Core (BTC) equivalents, effectively bypassing the lack of native INT6 tensor cores. Evaluations on LLaMA models show FlexQ maintains near-FP16 accuracy, with perplexity increases of no more than 0.05. The proposed kernel achieves an average 1.39$\times$ speedup over ABQ-LLM on LLaMA-2-70B linear layers. End-to-end, FlexQ delivers 1.33$\times$ inference acceleration and 1.21$\times$ memory savings over SmoothQuant. Code is released at https://github.com/FlyFoxPlayer/FlexQ.

### Why are LLMs' abilities emergent?
**Authors**: Vladimír Havlík

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T12:43:04Z

**Summary**: The remarkable success of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generative tasks has raised fundamental questions about the nature of their acquired capabilities, which often appear to emerge unexpectedly without explicit training. This paper examines the emergent properties of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) through both theoretical analysis and empirical observation, addressing the epistemological challenge of "creation without understanding" that characterises contemporary AI development. We explore how the neural approach's reliance on nonlinear, stochastic processes fundamentally differs from symbolic computational paradigms, creating systems whose macro-level behaviours cannot be analytically derived from micro-level neuron activities. Through analysis of scaling laws, grokking phenomena, and phase transitions in model capabilities, I demonstrate that emergent abilities arise from the complex dynamics of highly sensitive nonlinear systems rather than simply from parameter scaling alone. My investigation reveals that current debates over metrics, pre-training loss thresholds, and in-context learning miss the fundamental ontological nature of emergence in DNNs. I argue that these systems exhibit genuine emergent properties analogous to those found in other complex natural phenomena, where systemic capabilities emerge from cooperative interactions among simple components without being reducible to their individual behaviours. The paper concludes that understanding LLM capabilities requires recognising DNNs as a new domain of complex dynamical systems governed by universal principles of emergence, similar to those operating in physics, chemistry, and biology. This perspective shifts the focus from purely phenomenological definitions of emergence to understanding the internal dynamic transformations that enable these systems to acquire capabilities that transcend their individual components.

### Industrial LLM-based Code Optimization under Regulation: A   Mixture-of-Agents Approach
**Authors**: Mari Ashiga, Vardan Voskanyan, Fateme Dinmohammadi, Jingzhi Gong, Paul Brookes, Matthew Truscott, Rafail Giavrimis, Mike Basios, Leslie Kanthan, Wei Jie

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T12:41:21Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) for code optimization have enabled industrial platforms to automate software performance engineering at unprecedented scale and speed. Yet, organizations in regulated industries face strict constraints on which LLMs they can use - many cannot utilize commercial models due to data privacy regulations and compliance requirements, creating a significant challenge for achieving high-quality code optimization while maintaining cost-effectiveness. We address this by implementing a Mixture-of-Agents (MoA) approach that directly synthesizes code from multiple specialized LLMs, comparing it against TurinTech AI's vanilla Genetic Algorithm (GA)-based ensemble system and individual LLM optimizers using real-world industrial codebases. Our key contributions include: (1) First MoA application to industrial code optimization using real-world codebases; (2) Empirical evidence that MoA excels with open-source models, achieving 14.3% to 22.2% cost savings and 28.6% to 32.2% faster optimization times for regulated environments; (3) Deployment guidelines demonstrating GA's advantage with commercial models while both ensembles outperform individual LLMs; and (4) Real-world validation across 50 code snippets and seven LLM combinations, generating over 8,700 variants, addresses gaps in industrial LLM ensemble evaluation. This provides actionable guidance for organizations balancing regulatory compliance with optimization performance in production environments.

### Improving Crash Data Quality with Large Language Models: Evidence from   Secondary Crash Narratives in Kentucky
**Authors**: Xu Zhang, Mei Chen

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T12:41:18Z

**Summary**: This study evaluates advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques to enhance crash data quality by mining crash narratives, using secondary crash identification in Kentucky as a case study. Drawing from 16,656 manually reviewed narratives from 2015-2022, with 3,803 confirmed secondary crashes, we compare three model classes: zero-shot open-source large language models (LLMs) (LLaMA3:70B, DeepSeek-R1:70B, Qwen3:32B, Gemma3:27B); fine-tuned transformers (BERT, DistilBERT, RoBERTa, XLNet, Longformer); and traditional logistic regression as baseline. Models were calibrated on 2015-2021 data and tested on 1,771 narratives from 2022. Fine-tuned transformers achieved superior performance, with RoBERTa yielding the highest F1-score (0.90) and accuracy (95%). Zero-shot LLaMA3:70B reached a comparable F1 of 0.86 but required 139 minutes of inference; the logistic baseline lagged well behind (F1:0.66). LLMs excelled in recall for some variants (e.g., GEMMA3:27B at 0.94) but incurred high computational costs (up to 723 minutes for DeepSeek-R1:70B), while fine-tuned models processed the test set in seconds after brief training. Further analysis indicated that mid-sized LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek-R1:32B) can rival larger counterparts in performance while reducing runtime, suggesting opportunities for optimized deployments. Results highlight trade-offs between accuracy, efficiency, and data requirements, with fine-tuned transformer models balancing precision and recall effectively on Kentucky data. Practical deployment considerations emphasize privacy-preserving local deployment, ensemble approaches for improved accuracy, and incremental processing for scalability, providing a replicable scheme for enhancing crash-data quality with advanced NLP.

### Enhancing Zero-Shot Brain Tumor Subtype Classification via Fine-Grained   Patch-Text Alignment
**Authors**: Lubin Gan, Jing Zhang, Linhao Qu, Yijun Wang, Siying Wu, Xiaoyan Sun

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T12:04:27Z

**Summary**: The fine-grained classification of brain tumor subtypes from histopathological whole slide images is highly challenging due to subtle morphological variations and the scarcity of annotated data. Although vision-language models have enabled promising zero-shot classification, their ability to capture fine-grained pathological features remains limited, resulting in suboptimal subtype discrimination. To address these challenges, we propose the Fine-Grained Patch Alignment Network (FG-PAN), a novel zero-shot framework tailored for digital pathology. FG-PAN consists of two key modules: (1) a local feature refinement module that enhances patch-level visual features by modeling spatial relationships among representative patches, and (2) a fine-grained text description generation module that leverages large language models to produce pathology-aware, class-specific semantic prototypes. By aligning refined visual features with LLM-generated fine-grained descriptions, FG-PAN effectively increases class separability in both visual and semantic spaces. Extensive experiments on multiple public pathology datasets, including EBRAINS and TCGA, demonstrate that FG-PAN achieves state-of-the-art performance and robust generalization in zero-shot brain tumor subtype classification.

### LUST: A Multi-Modal Framework with Hierarchical LLM-based Scoring for   Learned Thematic Significance Tracking in Multimedia Content
**Authors**: Anderson de Lima Luiz

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T11:48:51Z

**Summary**: This paper introduces the Learned User Significance Tracker (LUST), a framework designed to analyze video content and quantify the thematic relevance of its segments in relation to a user-provided textual description of significance. LUST leverages a multi-modal analytical pipeline, integrating visual cues from video frames with textual information extracted via Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) from the audio track. The core innovation lies in a hierarchical, two-stage relevance scoring mechanism employing Large Language Models (LLMs). An initial "direct relevance" score, $S_{d,i}$, assesses individual segments based on immediate visual and auditory content against the theme. This is followed by a "contextual relevance" score, $S_{c,i}$, that refines the assessment by incorporating the temporal progression of preceding thematic scores, allowing the model to understand evolving narratives. The LUST framework aims to provide a nuanced, temporally-aware measure of user-defined significance, outputting an annotated video with visualized relevance scores and comprehensive analytical logs.

### Chain of Questions: Guiding Multimodal Curiosity in Language Models
**Authors**: Nima Iji, Kia Dashtipour

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T11:42:54Z

**Summary**: Reasoning capabilities in large language models (LLMs) have substantially advanced through methods such as chain-of-thought and explicit step-by-step explanations. However, these improvements have not yet fully transitioned to multimodal contexts, where models must proactively decide which sensory modalities such as vision, audio, or spatial perception to engage when interacting with complex real-world environments. In this paper, we introduce the Chain of Questions (CoQ) framework, a curiosity-driven reasoning approach that encourages multimodal language models to dynamically generate targeted questions regarding their surroundings. These generated questions guide the model to selectively activate relevant modalities, thereby gathering critical information necessary for accurate reasoning and response generation. We evaluate our framework on a novel multimodal benchmark dataset, assembled by integrating WebGPT, ScienceQA, AVSD, and ScanQA datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our CoQ method improves a foundation model's ability to effectively identify and integrate pertinent sensory information. This leads to improved accuracy, interpretability, and alignment of the reasoning process with diverse multimodal tasks.

### GTPO and GRPO-S: Token and Sequence-Level Reward Shaping with Policy   Entropy
**Authors**: Hongze Tan, Jianfei Pan

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T11:42:47Z

**Summary**: Reinforcement learning (RL) with algorithms like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) improves Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning, but is limited by a coarse-grained credit assignment that applies a uniform reward to all tokens in a sequence. This is a major flaw in long-chain reasoning tasks. This paper solves this with \textbf{Dynamic Entropy Weighting}. Our core idea is that high-entropy tokens in correct responses can guide the policy toward a higher performance ceiling. This allows us to create more fine-grained reward signals for precise policy updates via two ways: 1) \textbf{Group Token Policy Optimization} (\textbf{GTPO}), we assigns a entropy-weighted reward to each token for fine-grained credit assignment. 2) \textbf{Sequence-Level Group Relative Policy Optimization} (\textbf{GRPO-S}), we assigns a entropy-weighted reward to each sequence based on its average token entropy. Experiments show our methods significantly outperform the strong DAPO baseline. The results confirm that our entropy-weighting mechanism is the key driver of this performance boost, offering a better path to enhance deep reasoning in models.

### On the Fundamental Impossibility of Hallucination Control in Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Michał P. Karpowicz

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T11:34:54Z

**Summary**: This paper establishes a fundamental impossibility theorem: no LLM capable performing non-trivial knowledge aggregation can simultaneously achieve truthful (internally consistent) knowledge representation, semantic information conservation, complete revelation of relevant knowledge, and knowledge-constrained optimality. This impossibility is not an engineering limitation but arises from the mathematical structure of information aggregation itself. We establish this result by describing the inference process as an auction of ideas, where distributed components compete exploiting their partial knowledge to shape responses. The proof spans three independent mathematical domains: mechanism design theory (Green-Laffont), the theory of proper scoring rules (Savage), and direct architectural analysis of transformers (Log-Sum-Exp convexity). In particular, we show how in the strictly concave settings the score of an aggregate of diverse beliefs strictly exceeds the sum of individual scores. That gap may quantify the creation of unattributable certainty or overconfidence -- the mathematical origin of both hallucination and creativity, or imagination.   To support this analysis, we introduce the complementary concepts of the semantic information measure and the emergence operator to model bounded reasoning in a general setting. We prove that while bounded reasoning generates accessible information, providing valuable insights and inspirations, idealized reasoning strictly preserves semantic content. By demonstrating that hallucination and imagination are mathematically identical phenomena-grounded in the necessary violation of information conservation-this paper offers a principled foundation for managing these behaviors in advanced AI systems. Finally, we present some speculative ideas to inspire evaluation and refinements of the proposed theory.

### Sign Spotting Disambiguation using Large Language Models
**Authors**: JianHe Low, Ozge Mercanoglu Sincan, Richard Bowden

**Updated**: 2025-08-07T13:34:51Z

**Summary**: Sign spotting, the task of identifying and localizing individual signs within continuous sign language video, plays a pivotal role in scaling dataset annotations and addressing the severe data scarcity issue in sign language translation. While automatic sign spotting holds great promise for enabling frame-level supervision at scale, it grapples with challenges such as vocabulary inflexibility and ambiguity inherent in continuous sign streams. Hence, we introduce a novel, training-free framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) to significantly enhance sign spotting quality. Our approach extracts global spatio-temporal and hand shape features, which are then matched against a large-scale sign dictionary using dynamic time warping and cosine similarity. This dictionary-based matching inherently offers superior vocabulary flexibility without requiring model retraining. To mitigate noise and ambiguity from the matching process, an LLM performs context-aware gloss disambiguation via beam search, notably without fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world sign language datasets demonstrate our method's superior accuracy and sentence fluency compared to traditional approaches, highlighting the potential of LLMs in advancing sign spotting.

### Deliberative Reasoning Network: An Uncertainty-Driven Paradigm for   Belief-Tracked Inference with Pretrained Language Models
**Authors**: Anran Xu, Jincheng Wang, Baigen Cai, Tao Wen

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T11:33:35Z

**Summary**: Large language models often fail at logical reasoning when semantic heuristics conflict with decisive evidence - a phenomenon we term cognitive traps. To address this fundamental limitation, we introduce the Deliberative Reasoning Network (DRN), a novel paradigm that reframes logical reasoning from probability maximization to uncertainty minimization. Instead of asking "Which answer is most likely?", DRN asks "Which hypothesis has the most internally consistent evidence?". DRN achieves intrinsic interpretability by explicitly tracking belief states and quantifying epistemic uncertainty for competing hypotheses through an iterative evidence synthesis process. We validate our approach through two complementary architectures - a bespoke discriminative model that embodies the core uncertainty minimization principle, and a lightweight verification module that enhances existing generative LLMs. Evaluated on LCR-1000, our new adversarial reasoning benchmark designed to expose cognitive traps, the bespoke DRN achieves up to 15.2% improvement over standard baselines. When integrated as a parameter-efficient verifier with Mistral-7B, our hybrid system boosts accuracy from 20% to 80% on the most challenging problems. Critically, DRN demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization, improving TruthfulQA performance by 23.6% without additional training, indicating that uncertainty-driven deliberation learns transferable reasoning principles. We position DRN as a foundational, verifiable System 2 reasoning component for building more trustworthy AI systems.

### Adversarial Cooperative Rationalization: The Risk of Spurious   Correlations in Even Clean Datasets
**Authors**: Wei Liu, Zhongyu Niu, Lang Gao, Zhiying Deng, Jun Wang, Haozhao Wang, Ruixuan Li

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T11:31:36Z

**Summary**: This study investigates the self-rationalization framework constructed with a cooperative game, where a generator initially extracts the most informative segment from raw input, and a subsequent predictor utilizes the selected subset for its input. The generator and predictor are trained collaboratively to maximize prediction accuracy. In this paper, we first uncover a potential caveat: such a cooperative game could unintentionally introduce a sampling bias during rationale extraction. Specifically, the generator might inadvertently create an incorrect correlation between the selected rationale candidate and the label, even when they are semantically unrelated in the original dataset. Subsequently, we elucidate the origins of this bias using both detailed theoretical analysis and empirical evidence. Our findings suggest a direction for inspecting these correlations through attacks, based on which we further introduce an instruction to prevent the predictor from learning the correlations. Through experiments on six text classification datasets and two graph classification datasets using three network architectures (GRUs, BERT, and GCN), we show that our method not only significantly outperforms recent rationalization methods, but also achieves comparable or even better results than a representative LLM (llama3.1-8b-instruct).

### Modelling and Classifying the Components of a Literature Review
**Authors**: Francisco Bolaños, Angelo Salatino, Francesco Osborne, Enrico Motta

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T11:30:07Z

**Summary**: Previous work has demonstrated that AI methods for analysing scientific literature benefit significantly from annotating sentences in papers according to their rhetorical roles, such as research gaps, results, limitations, extensions of existing methodologies, and others. Such representations also have the potential to support the development of a new generation of systems capable of producing high-quality literature reviews. However, achieving this goal requires the definition of a relevant annotation schema and effective strategies for large-scale annotation of the literature. This paper addresses these challenges by 1) introducing a novel annotation schema specifically designed to support literature review generation and 2) conducting a comprehensive evaluation of a wide range of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) in classifying rhetorical roles according to this schema. To this end, we also present Sci-Sentence, a novel multidisciplinary benchmark comprising 700 sentences manually annotated by domain experts and 2,240 sentences automatically labelled using LLMs. We evaluate 37 LLMs on this benchmark, spanning diverse model families and sizes, using both zero-shot learning and fine-tuning approaches. The experiments yield several novel insights that advance the state of the art in this challenging domain. First, the current generation of LLMs performs remarkably well on this task when fine-tuned on high-quality data, achieving performance levels above 96\% F1. Second, while large proprietary models like GPT-4o achieve the best results, some lightweight open-source alternatives also demonstrate excellent performance. Finally, enriching the training data with semi-synthetic examples generated by LLMs proves beneficial, enabling small encoders to achieve robust results and significantly enhancing the performance of several open decoder models.

### DGAR: A Unified Domain Generalization Framework for RF-Based Human   Activity Recognition
**Authors**: Junshuo Liu, Xin Shi, Yunchuan Zhang, Yinhao Ge, Robert C. Qiu

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T11:25:30Z

**Summary**: Radio-frequency (RF)-based human activity recognition (HAR) provides a contactless and privacy-preserving solution for monitoring human behavior in applications such as astronaut extravehicular activity monitoring, human-autonomy collaborative cockpit, and unmanned aerial vehicle surveillance. However, real-world deployments usually face the challenge of domain knowledge shifts arising from inter-subject variability, heterogeneous physical environments, and unseen activity patterns, resulting in significant performance degradation. To address this issue, we propose DGAR, a domain-generalized activity recognition framework that learns transferable representations without collecting data from the target domain. DGAR integrates instance-adaptive feature modulation with cross-domain distribution alignment to enhance both personalization and generalization. Specifically, it incorporates a squeeze-and-excitation (SE) block to extract salient spatiotemporal features and employs correlation alignment to mitigate inter-domain discrepancies. Extensive experiments on public RF-based datasets -- HUST-HAR, Lab-LFM, and Office-LFM -- demonstrate that DGAR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to a 5.81% improvement in weighted F1-score. The empirical results substantiate the generalization capability of DGAR in real-time RF sensing across dynamic scenarios.

### The SWE-Bench Illusion: When State-of-the-Art LLMs Remember Instead of   Reason
**Authors**: Shanchao Liang, Spandan Garg, Roshanak Zilouchian Moghaddam

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T11:23:11Z

**Summary**: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly capable and widely adopted, benchmarks play a central role in assessing their practical utility. For example, SWE-Bench Verified has emerged as a critical benchmark for evaluating LLMs' software engineering abilities, particularly their aptitude for resolving real-world GitHub issues. Recent LLMs show impressive performance on SWE-Bench, leading to optimism about their capacity for complex coding tasks. However, current evaluation protocols may overstate these models' true capabilities. It is crucial to distinguish LLMs' generalizable problem-solving ability and other learned artifacts. In this work, we introduce two diagnostic tasks: file path identification from issue descriptions alone and ground truth function reproduction with only the current file context and issue description to probe models' underlying knowledge. We present empirical evidence that performance gains on SWE-Bench-Verified may be partially driven by memorization rather than genuine problem-solving. We show that state-of-the-art models achieve up to 76% accuracy in identifying buggy file paths using only issue descriptions, without access to repository structure. This performance is merely up to 53% on tasks from repositories not included in SWE-Bench, pointing to possible data contamination or memorization. Similar patterns are also observed for the function reproduction task, where the verbatim similarity is much higher on SWE-Bench Verified than on other similar coding benchmarks (up to 35% consecutive 5-gram accuracy on SWE-Bench Verified and Full, but only up to 18% for tasks in other benchmarks). These findings raise concerns about the validity of existing results and underscore the need for more robust, contamination-resistant benchmarks to reliably evaluate LLMs' coding abilities.

### Forgetting: A New Mechanism Towards Better Large Language Model   Fine-tuning
**Authors**: Ali Taheri Ghahrizjani, Alireza Taban, Qizhou Wang, Shanshan Ye, Abdolreza Mirzaei, Tongliang Liu, Bo Han

**Updated**: 2025-08-07T08:30:41Z

**Summary**: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) plays a critical role for pretrained large language models (LLMs), notably enhancing their capacity to acquire domain-specific knowledge while preserving or potentially augmenting their general-purpose capabilities. However, the efficacy of SFT hinges on data quality as well as data volume, otherwise it may result in limited performance gains or even degradation relative to the associated baselines. To mitigate such reliance, we suggest categorizing tokens within each corpus into two parts -- positive and negative tokens -- based on whether they are useful to improve model performance. Positive tokens can be trained in common ways, whereas negative tokens, which may lack essential semantics or be misleading, should be explicitly forgotten. Overall, the token categorization facilitate the model to learn less informative message, and the forgetting process shapes a knowledge boundary to guide the model on what information to learn more precisely. We conduct experiments on well-established benchmarks, finding that this forgetting mechanism not only improves overall model performance and also facilitate more diverse model responses.

### Evaluating Multi-Hop Reasoning in Large Language Models: A   Chemistry-Centric Case Study
**Authors**: Mohammad Khodadad, Ali Shiraee Kasmaee, Mahdi Astaraki, Nicholas Sherck, Hamidreza Mahyar, Soheila Samiee

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T11:20:14Z

**Summary**: In this study, we introduced a new benchmark consisting of a curated dataset and a defined evaluation process to assess the compositional reasoning capabilities of large language models within the chemistry domain. We designed and validated a fully automated pipeline, verified by subject matter experts, to facilitate this task. Our approach integrates OpenAI reasoning models with named entity recognition (NER) systems to extract chemical entities from recent literature, which are then augmented with external knowledge bases to form a comprehensive knowledge graph. By generating multi-hop questions across these graphs, we assess LLM performance in both context-augmented and non-context augmented settings. Our experiments reveal that even state-of-the-art models face significant challenges in multi-hop compositional reasoning. The results reflect the importance of augmenting LLMs with document retrieval, which can have a substantial impact on improving their performance. However, even perfect retrieval accuracy with full context does not eliminate reasoning errors, underscoring the complexity of compositional reasoning. This work not only benchmarks and highlights the limitations of current LLMs but also presents a novel data generation pipeline capable of producing challenging reasoning datasets across various domains. Overall, this research advances our understanding of reasoning in computational linguistics.

### Edge Agentic AI Framework for Autonomous Network Optimisation in O-RAN
**Authors**: Abdelaziz Salama, Zeinab Nezami, Mohammed M. H. Qazzaz, Maryam Hafeez, Syed Ali Raza Zaidi

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T11:17:33Z

**Summary**: The deployment of AI agents within legacy Radio Access Network (RAN) infrastructure poses significant safety and reliability challenges for future 6G networks. This paper presents a novel Edge AI framework for autonomous network optimisation in Open RAN environments, addressing these challenges through three core innovations: (1) a persona-based multi-tools architecture enabling distributed, context-aware decision-making; (2) proactive anomaly detection agent powered by traffic predictive tool; and (3) a safety, aligned reward mechanism that balances performance with operational stability. Integrated into the RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC), our framework leverages multimodal data fusion, including network KPIs, a traffic prediction model, and external information sources, to anticipate and respond to dynamic network conditions. Extensive evaluation using realistic 5G scenarios demonstrates that the edge framework achieves zero network outages under high-stress conditions, compared to 8.4% for traditional fixed-power networks and 3.3% for large language model (LLM) agent-based approaches, while maintaining near real-time responsiveness and consistent QoS. These results establish that, when equipped with the right tools and contextual awareness, AI agents can be safely and effectively deployed in critical network infrastructure, laying the framework for intelligent and autonomous 5G and beyond network operations.

### Beyond the Leaderboard: Rethinking Medical Benchmarks for Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Zizhan Ma, Wenxuan Wang, Guo Yu, Yiu-Fai Cheung, Meidan Ding, Jie Liu, Wenting Chen, Linlin Shen

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T11:11:40Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) show significant potential in healthcare, prompting numerous benchmarks to evaluate their capabilities. However, concerns persist regarding the reliability of these benchmarks, which often lack clinical fidelity, robust data management, and safety-oriented evaluation metrics. To address these shortcomings, we introduce MedCheck, the first lifecycle-oriented assessment framework specifically designed for medical benchmarks. Our framework deconstructs a benchmark's development into five continuous stages, from design to governance, and provides a comprehensive checklist of 46 medically-tailored criteria. Using MedCheck, we conducted an in-depth empirical evaluation of 53 medical LLM benchmarks. Our analysis uncovers widespread, systemic issues, including a profound disconnect from clinical practice, a crisis of data integrity due to unmitigated contamination risks, and a systematic neglect of safety-critical evaluation dimensions like model robustness and uncertainty awareness. Based on these findings, MedCheck serves as both a diagnostic tool for existing benchmarks and an actionable guideline to foster a more standardized, reliable, and transparent approach to evaluating AI in healthcare.

### PAK-UCB Contextual Bandit: An Online Learning Approach to Prompt-Aware   Selection of Generative Models and LLMs
**Authors**: Xiaoyan Hu, Ho-fung Leung, Farzan Farnia

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T11:02:01Z

**Summary**: Selecting a sample generation scheme from multiple prompt-based generative models, including large language models (LLMs) and prompt-guided image and video generation models, is typically addressed by choosing the model that maximizes an averaged evaluation score. However, this score-based selection overlooks the possibility that different models achieve the best generation performance for different types of text prompts. An online identification of the best generation model for various input prompts can reduce the costs associated with querying sub-optimal models. In this work, we explore the possibility of varying rankings of text-based generative models for different text prompts and propose an online learning framework to predict the best data generation model for a given input prompt. The proposed PAK-UCB algorithm addresses a contextual bandit (CB) setting with shared context variables across the arms, utilizing the generated data to update kernel-based functions that predict the score of each model available for unseen text prompts. Additionally, we leverage random Fourier features (RFF) to accelerate the online learning process of PAK-UCB. Our numerical experiments on real and simulated text-to-image and image-to-text generative models show that RFF-UCB performs successfully in identifying the best generation model across different sample types.

### Multi-Agent Taskforce Collaboration: Self-Correction of Compounding   Errors in Long-Form Literature Review Generation
**Authors**: Zhi Zhang, Yan Liu, Zhejing Hu, Gong Chen, Sheng-hua Zhong, Jiannong Cao

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T10:45:52Z

**Summary**: Literature reviews play an important role in scientific research. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have boosted the development of automated systems for the entire literature review workflow, from retrieval to manuscript drafting. However, a key challenge is that mistakes made in early stages can propagate and amplify in subsequent steps, leading to compounding errors that undermine the faithfulness of the final review. To tackle this issue, we propose the Multi-Agent Taskforce Collaboration (MATC) framework, which consists of a manager agent and four executor agents for literature searching, outline generation, fact localization, and manuscript drafting. We propose three novel collaboration paradigms, forming exploration, exploitation, and experience taskforces, to effectively organize agents and mitigate compounding errors both between and within executor agents. Experimental results show that MATC achieves state-of-the-art performance on existing benchmarks. We further propose a new benchmark dataset featuring more diverse topics for faithful literature review generation.

**Summary**: Rust's compile-time safety guarantees make it ideal for safety-critical systems, creating demand for translating legacy C codebases to Rust. While various approaches have emerged for this task, they face inherent trade-offs: rule-based solutions face challenges in meeting code safety and idiomaticity requirements, while LLM-based solutions often fail to generate semantically equivalent Rust code, due to the heavy dependencies of modules across the entire codebase. Recent studies have revealed that both solutions are limited to small-scale programs. In this paper, we propose EvoC2Rust, an automated framework for converting entire C projects to equivalent Rust ones. EvoC2Rust employs a skeleton-guided translation strategy for project-level translation. The pipeline consists of three evolutionary stages: 1) it first decomposes the C project into functional modules, employs a feature-mapping-enhanced LLM to transform definitions and macros and generates type-checked function stubs, which form a compilable Rust skeleton; 2) it then incrementally translates the function, replacing the corresponding stub placeholder; 3) finally, it repairs compilation errors by integrating LLM and static analysis. Through evolutionary augmentation, EvoC2Rust combines the advantages of both rule-based and LLM-based solutions. Our evaluation on open-source benchmarks and six industrial projects demonstrates EvoC2Rust's superior performance in project-level C-to-Rust translation. On average, it achieves 17.24% and 14.32% improvements in syntax and semantic accuracy over the LLM-based approaches, along with a 96.79% higher code safety rate than the rule-based tools. At the module level, EvoC2Rust reaches 92.25% compilation and 89.53% test pass rates on industrial projects, even for complex codebases and long functions.

### Less Signals, More Understanding: Channel-Capacity Codebook Design for   Digital Task-Oriented Semantic Communication
**Authors**: Anbang Zhang, Shuaishuai Guo, Chenyuan Feng, Hongyang Du, Haojin Li, Chen Sun, Haijun Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T10:29:46Z

**Summary**: Discrete representation has emerged as a powerful tool in task-oriented semantic communication (ToSC), offering compact, interpretable, and efficient representations well-suited for low-power edge intelligence scenarios. Its inherent digital nature aligns seamlessly with hardware-friendly deployment and robust storage/transmission protocols. However, despite its strengths, current ToSC frameworks often decouple semantic-aware discrete mapping from the underlying channel characteristics and task demands. This mismatch leads to suboptimal communication performance, degraded task utility, and limited generalization under variable wireless conditions. Moreover, conventional designs frequently overlook channel-awareness in codebook construction, restricting the effectiveness of semantic symbol selection under constrained resources. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a channel-aware discrete semantic coding framework tailored for low-power edge networks. Leveraging a Wasserstein-regularized objective, our approach aligns discrete code activations with optimal input distributions, thereby improving semantic fidelity, robustness, and task accuracy. Extensive experiments on the inference tasks across diverse signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes show that our method achieves notable gains in accuracy and communication efficiency. This work provides new insights into integrating discrete semantics and channel optimization, paving the way for the widespread adoption of semantic communication in future digital infrastructures.

### Method-Based Reasoning for Large Language Models: Extraction, Reuse, and   Continuous Improvement
**Authors**: Hong Su

**Updated**: 2025-08-07T04:14:31Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities across a wide range of language tasks. However, their reasoning process is primarily guided by statistical patterns in training data, which limits their ability to handle novel problems and perform consistent logical reasoning. In this paper, we propose a method-based model that enhances LLMs with explicit, reusable procedures extracted from training content, generated responses, and user interactions. Each method is represented as a pair consisting of a problem and its corresponding solution, stored externally and ranked based on feedback. When a new query is received, the system retrieves and applies the most relevant methods to guide the LLM's response. Our model enables continual learning, method reuse, and logical consistency beyond next-token prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that the system improves factual verification and generalization in complex prompts, and that newly learned methods can outperform earlier ones through user-driven refinement.

### Prompt Injection Vulnerability of Consensus Generating Applications in   Digital Democracy
**Authors**: Jairo Gudiño-Rosero, Clément Contet, Umberto Grandi, César A. Hidalgo

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T10:10:01Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are gaining traction as a method to generate consensus statements and aggregate preferences in digital democracy experiments. Yet, LLMs may introduce critical vulnerabilities in these systems. Here, we explore the impact of prompt-injection attacks targeting consensus generating systems by introducing a four-dimensional taxonomy of attacks. We test these attacks using LLaMA 3.1 8B and Chat GPT 4.1 Nano finding the LLMs more vulnerable to criticism attacks -- attacks using disagreeable prompts -- and more effective at tilting ambiguous consensus statements. We also find evidence of more effective manipulation when using explicit imperatives and rational-sounding arguments compared to emotional language or fabricated statistics. To mitigate these vulnerabilities, we apply Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), an alignment method that fine-tunes LLMs to prefer unperturbed consensus statements. While DPO significantly improves robustness, it still offers limited protection against attacks targeting ambiguous consensus. These results advance our understanding of the vulnerability and robustness of consensus generating LLMs in digital democracy applications.

### Enhancing Vision-Language Model Training with Reinforcement Learning in   Synthetic Worlds for Real-World Success
**Authors**: George Bredis, Stanislav Dereka, Viacheslav Sinii, Ruslan Rakhimov, Daniil Gavrilov

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T10:08:48Z

**Summary**: Interactive multimodal agents must convert raw visual observations into coherent sequences of language-conditioned actions -- a capability that current vision-language models (VLMs) still lack. Earlier reinforcement-learning (RL) efforts could, in principle, endow VLMs with such skills, but they have seldom tested whether the learned behaviours generalize beyond their training simulators, and they depend either on brittle hyperparameter tuning or on dense-reward environments with low state variability. We introduce Vision-Language Decoupled Actor-Critic (VL-DAC), a lightweight, hyperparameter-free RL algorithm. VL-DAC applies PPO updates to action tokens while learning value only at the environment-step level: an arrangement, to our knowledge, not previously explored for large VLMs or LLMs. This simple decoupling removes unstable weighting terms and yields faster, more reliable convergence. Training a single VLM with VL-DAC in one inexpensive simulator at a time (MiniWorld, Gym-Cards, ALFWorld, or WebShop) already produces policies that generalize widely: +50\% relative on BALROG (game-centric agentic control), +5\% relative on the hardest part of VSI-Bench (spatial planning), and +2\% on VisualWebBench (web navigation), all without degrading general image understanding accuracy. These results provide the first evidence that a simple RL algorithm can train VLMs entirely in cheap synthetic worlds while delivering measurable gains on real-image agentic, spatial-reasoning, and web-navigation benchmarks.

### Mockingbird: How does LLM perform in general machine learning tasks?
**Authors**: Haoyu Jia, Yoshiki Obinata, Kento Kawaharazuka, Kei Okada

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T10:08:47Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are now being used with increasing frequency as chat bots, tasked with the summarizing information or generating text and code in accordance with user instructions. The rapid increase in reasoning capabilities and inference speed of LLMs has revealed their remarkable potential for applications extending beyond the domain of chat bots to general machine learning tasks. This work is conducted out of the curiosity about such potential. In this work, we propose a framework Mockingbird to adapt LLMs to general machine learning tasks and evaluate its performance and scalability on several general machine learning tasks. The core concept of this framework is instructing LLMs to role-play functions and reflect on its mistakes to improve itself. Our evaluation and analysis result shows that LLM-driven machine learning methods, such as Mockingbird, can achieve acceptable results on common machine learning tasks; however, solely reflecting on its own currently cannot outperform the effect of domain-specific documents and feedback from human experts.

**Authors**: Wentao Wu, Linqing Chen, Hanmeng Zhong, Weilei Wang

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T10:06:11Z

**Summary**: BalancedBio is a theoretically grounded framework for parameter-efficient biomedical reasoning, addressing multi-capability integration in domain-specific AI alignment. It establishes the Biomedical Multi-Capability Convergence Theorem, proving orthogonal gradient spaces are essential to prevent capability interference for safe deployment. Key innovations include: (1) Medical Knowledge Grounded Synthetic Generation (MKGSG), extending Source2Synth with clinical workflow constraints and medical ontology validation for factual accuracy and safety; and (2) Capability Aware Group Relative Policy Optimization, deriving optimal hybrid reward weighting to maintain orthogonality in RL, using a reward model with rule-based and model-based scores adapted to biomedical tasks. Mathematical analysis proves Pareto-optimal convergence, preserving performance across capabilities. It achieves state-of-the-art results in its parameter class: domain expertise (80.95% BIOMED-MMLU, +15.32% over baseline), reasoning (61.94%, +7.75%), instruction following (67.95%, +6.44%), and integration (86.7%, +18.5%). Theoretical safety guarantees include bounds on capability preservation and clinical accuracy. Real-world deployment yields 78% cost reduction, 23% improved diagnostic accuracy, and 89% clinician acceptance. This work provides a principled methodology for biomedical AI alignment, enabling efficient reasoning with essential safety and reliability, with the 0.5B model version to be released.

### A Few Words Can Distort Graphs: Knowledge Poisoning Attacks on   Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation of Large Language Models
**Authors**: Jiayi Wen, Tianxin Chen, Zhirun Zheng, Cheng Huang

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T10:01:26Z

**Summary**: Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) has recently emerged as a promising paradigm for enhancing large language models (LLMs) by converting raw text into structured knowledge graphs, improving both accuracy and explainability. However, GraphRAG relies on LLMs to extract knowledge from raw text during graph construction, and this process can be maliciously manipulated to implant misleading information. Targeting this attack surface, we propose two knowledge poisoning attacks (KPAs) and demonstrate that modifying only a few words in the source text can significantly change the constructed graph, poison the GraphRAG, and severely mislead downstream reasoning. The first attack, named Targeted KPA (TKPA), utilizes graph-theoretic analysis to locate vulnerable nodes in the generated graphs and rewrites the corresponding narratives with LLMs, achieving precise control over specific question-answering (QA) outcomes with a success rate of 93.1\%, while keeping the poisoned text fluent and natural. The second attack, named Universal KPA (UKPA), exploits linguistic cues such as pronouns and dependency relations to disrupt the structural integrity of the generated graph by altering globally influential words. With fewer than 0.05\% of full text modified, the QA accuracy collapses from 95\% to 50\%. Furthermore, experiments show that state-of-the-art defense methods fail to detect these attacks, highlighting that securing GraphRAG pipelines against knowledge poisoning remains largely unexplored.

### ShoppingBench: A Real-World Intent-Grounded Shopping Benchmark for   LLM-based Agents
**Authors**: Jiangyuan Wang, Kejun Xiao, Qi Sun, Huaipeng Zhao, Tao Luo, Jiandong Zhang, Xiaoyi Zeng

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T09:51:30Z

**Summary**: Existing benchmarks in e-commerce primarily focus on basic user intents, such as finding or purchasing products. However, real-world users often pursue more complex goals, such as applying vouchers, managing budgets, and finding multi-products seller. To bridge this gap, we propose ShoppingBench, a novel end-to-end shopping benchmark designed to encompass increasingly challenging levels of grounded intent. Specifically, we propose a scalable framework to simulate user instructions based on various intents derived from sampled real-world products. To facilitate consistent and reliable evaluations, we provide a large-scale shopping sandbox that serves as an interactive simulated environment, incorporating over 2.5 million real-world products. Experimental results demonstrate that even state-of-the-art language agents (such as GPT-4.1) achieve absolute success rates under 50% on our benchmark tasks, highlighting the significant challenges posed by our ShoppingBench. In addition, we propose a trajectory distillation strategy and leverage supervised fine-tuning, along with reinforcement learning on synthetic trajectories, to distill the capabilities of a large language agent into a smaller one. As a result, our trained agent achieves competitive performance compared to GPT-4.1.

### SelectiveShield: Lightweight Hybrid Defense Against Gradient Leakage in   Federated Learning
**Authors**: Borui Li, Li Yan, Jianmin Liu

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T09:50:39Z

**Summary**: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training on decentralized data but remains vulnerable to gradient leakage attacks that can reconstruct sensitive user information. Existing defense mechanisms, such as differential privacy (DP) and homomorphic encryption (HE), often introduce a trade-off between privacy, model utility, and system overhead, a challenge that is exacerbated in heterogeneous environments with non-IID data and varying client capabilities. To address these limitations, we propose SelectiveShield, a lightweight hybrid defense framework that adaptively integrates selective homomorphic encryption and differential privacy. SelectiveShield leverages Fisher information to quantify parameter sensitivity, allowing clients to identify critical parameters locally. Through a collaborative negotiation protocol, clients agree on a shared set of the most sensitive parameters for protection via homomorphic encryption. Parameters that are uniquely important to individual clients are retained locally, fostering personalization, while non-critical parameters are protected with adaptive differential privacy noise. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SelectiveShield maintains strong model utility while significantly mitigating gradient leakage risks, offering a practical and scalable defense mechanism for real-world federated learning deployments.

### How Far Can LLMs Improve from Experience? Measuring Test-Time Learning   Ability in LLMs with Human Comparison
**Authors**: Jiayin Wang, Zhiquang Guo, Weizhi Ma, Min Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T09:42:36Z

**Summary**: As evaluation designs of large language models may shape our trajectory toward artificial general intelligence, comprehensive and forward-looking assessment is essential. Existing benchmarks primarily assess static knowledge, while intelligence also entails the ability to rapidly learn from experience. To this end, we advocate for the evaluation of Test-time Learning, the capacity to improve performance in experience-based, reasoning-intensive tasks during test time. In this work, we propose semantic games as effective testbeds for evaluating test-time learning, due to their resistance to saturation and inherent demand for strategic reasoning. We introduce an objective evaluation framework that compares model performance under both limited and cumulative experience settings, and contains four forms of experience representation. To provide a comparative baseline, we recruit eight human participants to complete the same task. Results show that LLMs exhibit measurable test-time learning capabilities; however, their improvements are less stable under cumulative experience and progress more slowly than those observed in humans. These findings underscore the potential of LLMs as general-purpose learning machines, while also revealing a substantial intellectual gap between models and humans, irrespective of how well LLMs perform on static benchmarks.

### KVSink: Understanding and Enhancing the Preservation of Attention Sinks   in KV Cache Quantization for LLMs
**Authors**: Zunhai Su, Kehong Yuan

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T09:40:09Z

**Summary**: Key-Value (KV) cache quantization has become a widely adopted optimization technique for efficient large language models (LLMs) inference by reducing KV cache memory usage and mitigating memory-bound constraints. Recent studies have emphasized the importance of preserving the original precision of KVs for the first few tokens to ensure the protection of attention sinks. While this approach has proven effective in mitigating performance degradation, its underlying principles remain insufficiently understood. Moreover, it fails to address the recent discovery that attention sinks can emerge beyond the initial token positions. In this work, we elucidate the underlying mechanisms of attention sinks during inference by examining their role in the cross-layer evolution of extreme activation outliers. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the interplay between attention sinks and KV cache quantization. Based on our enhanced understanding, we introduce \textit{\textbf{KVSink}}, a plug-and-play method that effectively predicts sink tokens with negligible overhead, enabling more thorough preservation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KVSink outperforms the existing Preserve-First-N (PFN) strategy, offering more effective preservation of attention sinks during KV cache quantization. Moreover, when applied to the well-established KVQuant method, KVSink further improves perplexity (PPL) and reduces reliance on 16-bit numerical outliers.

### T3Time: Tri-Modal Time Series Forecasting via Adaptive Multi-Head   Alignment and Residual Fusion
**Authors**: Abdul Monaf Chowdhury, Rabeya Akter, Safaeid Hossain Arib

**Updated**: 2025-08-06T09:31:44Z

**Summary**: Multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) seeks to model temporal dynamics among variables to predict future trends. Transformer-based models and large language models (LLMs) have shown promise due to their ability to capture long-range dependencies and patterns. However, current methods often rely on rigid inductive biases, ignore intervariable interactions, or apply static fusion strategies that limit adaptability across forecast horizons. These limitations create bottlenecks in capturing nuanced, horizon-specific relationships in time-series data. To solve this problem, we propose T3Time, a novel trimodal framework consisting of time, spectral, and prompt branches, where the dedicated frequency encoding branch captures the periodic structures along with a gating mechanism that learns prioritization between temporal and spectral features based on the prediction horizon. We also proposed a mechanism which adaptively aggregates multiple cross-modal alignment heads by dynamically weighting the importance of each head based on the features. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving an average reduction of 3.28% in MSE and 2.29% in MAE. Furthermore, it shows strong generalization in few-shot learning settings: with 5% training data, we see a reduction in MSE and MAE by 4.13% and 1.91%, respectively; and with 10% data, by 3.62% and 1.98% on average.
