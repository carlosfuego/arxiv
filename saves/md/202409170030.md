 ### Rethinking Programmed I/O for Fast Devices, Cheap Cores, and Coherent   Interconnects
**Authors**: Anastasiia Ruzhanskaia, Pengcheng Xu, David Cock, Timothy Roscoe

**Updated**: 2024-09-12T15:34:23Z

**Summary**: Conventional wisdom holds that an efficient interface between an OS running on a CPU and a high-bandwidth I/O device should be based on Direct Memory Access (DMA), descriptor rings, and interrupts: DMA offloads transfers from the CPU, descriptor rings provide buffering and queuing, and interrupts facilitate asynchronous interaction between cores and device with a lightweight notification mechanism. In this paper we question this wisdom in the light of modern hardware and workloads, particularly in cloud servers. We argue that the assumptions that led to this model are obsolete, and in many use-cases use of programmed I/O, where the CPU explicitly transfers data and control information to and from a device via loads and stores, actually results in a more efficient system. We quantitatively demonstrate these advantages using three use-cases: fine-grained RPC-style invocation of functions on an accelerator, offloading of operators in a streaming dataflow engine, and a network interface targeting for serverless functions. Moreover, we show that while these advantages are significant over a modern PCIe peripheral bus, a truly cache-coherent interconnect offers significant additional efficiency gains.

### Light Induced Orbital Magnetism in Metals via Inverse Faraday Effect
**Authors**: Priya Sharma, Alexander V. Balatsky

**Updated**: 2024-09-12T10:35:15Z

**Summary**: We present a microscopic calculation of the inverse Faraday effect in metals. We derive a static local magnetic moment induced on the application of high-frequency light, using the Eilenberger formulation of quasiclassical theory. We include the effect of disorder and formulate a theory applicable across the entire temperature range, in the absence of external applied fields. For light-induced electric fields of amplitude $\sim 100 kV/cm$, the induced fields are large, $\sim 0.1 T$ for metallic Nb! The predictions of our theory agree with recent experimental and theoretical results [1]. An extension of this approach to superconductors would open a new route of inducing orbital magnetic field and potentially vortices in superconductors.

### Super Monotonic Alignment Search
**Authors**: Junhyeok Lee, Hyeongju Kim

**Updated**: 2024-09-12T02:13:57Z

**Summary**: Monotonic alignment search (MAS), introduced by Glow-TTS, is one of the most popular algorithm in TTS to estimate unknown alignments between text and speech. Since this algorithm needs to search for the most probable alignment with dynamic programming by caching all paths, the time complexity of the algorithm is $O(T \times S)$. The authors of Glow-TTS run this algorithm on CPU, and while they mentioned it is difficult to parallelize, we found that MAS can be parallelized in text-length dimension and CPU execution consumes an inordinate amount of time for inter-device copy. Therefore, we implemented a Triton kernel and PyTorch JIT script to accelerate MAS on GPU without inter-device copy. As a result, Super-MAS Triton kernel is up to 72 times faster in the extreme-length case. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/supertone-inc/super-monotonic-align}.

### Learning to Compress Contexts for Efficient Knowledge-based Visual   Question Answering
**Authors**: Weixi Weng, Jieming Zhu, Hao Zhang, Xiaojun Meng, Rui Zhang, Chun Yuan

**Updated**: 2024-09-11T15:11:39Z

**Summary**: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated great zero-shot performance on visual question answering (VQA). However, when it comes to knowledge-based VQA (KB-VQA), MLLMs may lack human commonsense or specialized domain knowledge to answer such questions and require obtaining necessary information from external knowledge sources. Previous works like Retrival-Augmented VQA-v2 (RAVQA-v2) focus on utilizing as much input information, such as image-based textual descriptions and retrieved knowledge, as possible to improve performance, but they all overlook the issue that with the number of input tokens increasing, inference efficiency significantly decreases, which contradicts the demands of practical applications. To address this issue, we propose Retrieval-Augmented MLLM with Compressed Contexts (RACC). RACC learns to compress and aggregate retrieved contexts, from which it generates a compact modulation in the form of Key-Value (KV) cache. This modulation is then used to adapt the downstream frozen MLLM, thereby achieving effective and efficient inference. RACC achieves a state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance of 62.9% on OK-VQA. Moreover, it significantly reduces inference latency by 22.0%-59.7% compared to the prominent RAVQA-v2. Abundant experiments show RACC's broad applicability. It is compatible with various off-the-shelf MLLMs and can also handle different knowledge sources including textual and multimodal documents.

### Sub-cycle Nanotip Field Emission of Electrons Driven by Air Plasma   Generated THz Pulses
**Authors**: Benjamin Colmey, Rodrigo T. Paulino, David G. Cooke

**Updated**: 2024-09-11T11:40:23Z

**Summary**: Terahertz pulses generated by two-color laser plasmas have reported peak field strengths exceeding MV/cm, and when illuminating metal nanotips the near-field enhancement at the tip apex should result in extremely high bunch charges and electron energies via sub-cycle cold field emission. Here, electron emission from tungsten nanotips driven by THz pulses generated by a long filament air-plasma are reported. Electron energies up to 1.1 keV and bunch charges up to 2x$10^5$ electrons per pulse were detected, well below values expected for peak field calculated via the time averaged Poynting vector. Investigations revealed a failure in the use of the time-averaged Poynting vector when applied to long filament THz pulses, due to spatio-temporal restructuring of the THz pulse in the focus. Accounting for this restructuring significantly reduces the field strength to approximately 160 ~kV/cm, consistent with the observed electron bunch charges, peak energies and their dependence on the tip position in the THz focus. Despite these findings, our results surpass previous THz plasma-driven electron generation by an order of magnitude in both electron energy and bunch charge and a path to increasing these by an additional order of magnitude by modification of the THz optics is proposed.

### In-Loop Filtering via Trained Look-Up Tables
**Authors**: Zhuoyuan Li, Jiacheng Li, Yao Li, Li Li, Dong Liu, Feng Wu

**Updated**: 2024-09-11T08:12:55Z

**Summary**: In-loop filtering (ILF) is a key technology for removing the artifacts in image/video coding standards. Recently, neural network-based in-loop filtering methods achieve remarkable coding gains beyond the capability of advanced video coding standards, which becomes a powerful coding tool candidate for future video coding standards. However, the utilization of deep neural networks brings heavy time and computational complexity, and high demands of high-performance hardware, which is challenging to apply to the general uses of coding scene. To address this limitation, inspired by explorations in image restoration, we propose an efficient and practical in-loop filtering scheme by adopting the Look-up Table (LUT). We train the DNN of in-loop filtering within a fixed filtering reference range, and cache the output values of the DNN into a LUT via traversing all possible inputs. At testing time in the coding process, the filtered pixel is generated by locating input pixels (to-be-filtered pixel with reference pixels) and interpolating cached filtered pixel values. To further enable the large filtering reference range with the limited storage cost of LUT, we introduce the enhanced indexing mechanism in the filtering process, and clipping/finetuning mechanism in the training. The proposed method is implemented into the Versatile Video Coding (VVC) reference software, VTM-11.0. Experimental results show that the ultrafast, very fast, and fast mode of the proposed method achieves on average 0.13%/0.34%/0.51%, and 0.10%/0.27%/0.39% BD-rate reduction, under the all intra (AI) and random access (RA) configurations. Especially, our method has friendly time and computational complexity, only 101%/102%-104%/108% time increase with 0.13-0.93 kMACs/pixel, and only 164-1148 KB storage cost for a single model. Our solution may shed light on the journey of practical neural network-based coding tool evolution.

### Exploiting Deep Reinforcement Learning for Edge Caching in Cell-Free   Massive MIMO Systems
**Authors**: Yu Zhang, Shuaifei Chen, Jiayi Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-09-11T02:33:06Z

**Summary**: Cell-free massive multiple-input-multiple-output is promising to meet the stringent quality-of-experience (QoE) requirements of railway wireless communications by coordinating many successional access points (APs) to serve the onboard users coherently. A key challenge is how to deliver the desired contents timely due to the radical changing propagation environment caused by the growing train speed. In this paper, we propose to proactively cache the likely-requesting contents at the upcoming APs which perform the coherent transmission to reduce end-to-end delay. A long-term QoE-maximization problem is formulated and two cache placement algorithms are proposed. One is based on heuristic convex optimization (HCO) and the other exploits deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with soft actor-critic (SAC). Compared to the conventional benchmark, numerical results show the advantage of our proposed algorithms on QoE and hit probability. With the advanced DRL model, SAC outperforms HCO on QoE by predicting the user requests accurately.

### With Greater Text Comes Greater Necessity: Inference-Time Training Helps   Long Text Generation
**Authors**: Y. Wang, D. Ma, D. Cai

**Updated**: 2024-09-11T02:22:58Z

**Summary**: Long text generation, such as novel writing and discourse-level translation with extremely long contexts, presents significant challenges to current language models. Existing methods mainly focus on extending the model's context window through strategies like length extrapolation. However, these approaches demand substantial hardware resources during the training and/or inference phases. Our proposed method, Temp-Lora, introduces an alternative concept. Instead of relying on the KV cache to store all context information, we embeds this information directly into a temporary Lora module. In the process of long text generation, this module is progressively trained with text generated previously. This approach not only efficiently preserves contextual knowledge but also prevents any permanent alteration to the model's parameters given that the module is discarded post-generation. Extensive experiments on the PG19 language modeling benchmark and the GuoFeng discourse-level translation benchmark validate the effectiveness of Temp-Lora. Our results show that: 1) Temp-Lora substantially enhances generation quality for long text, as indicated by a 13.2% decrease in perplexity (PPL) on a subset of PG19, and a 29.3% decrease in PPL along with a 113.2% increase in BLEU score on a subset of GuoFeng, 2) Temp-Lora is compatible with and enhances most existing long text generation methods, and 3) Temp-Lora can greatly reduce computational costs by shortening the context window. For example, we can ensure a moderate improvement in generation quality (a decrease of 3.8% in PPL) while enabling a 51.5% memory usage reduction and a 60.0% decrease in latency for inference.

### DACAT: Dual-stream Adaptive Clip-aware Time Modeling for Robust Online   Surgical Phase Recognition
**Authors**: Kaixiang Yang, Qiang Li, Zhiwei Wang

**Updated**: 2024-09-10T04:58:48Z

**Summary**: Surgical phase recognition has become a crucial requirement in laparoscopic surgery, enabling various clinical applications like surgical risk forecasting. Current methods typically identify the surgical phase using individual frame-wise embeddings as the fundamental unit for time modeling. However, this approach is overly sensitive to current observations, often resulting in discontinuous and erroneous predictions within a complete surgical phase. In this paper, we propose DACAT, a novel dual-stream model that adaptively learns clip-aware context information to enhance the temporal relationship. In one stream, DACAT pretrains a frame encoder, caching all historical frame-wise features. In the other stream, DACAT fine-tunes a new frame encoder to extract the frame-wise feature at the current moment. Additionally, a max clip-response read-out (Max-R) module is introduced to bridge the two streams by using the current frame-wise feature to adaptively fetch the most relevant past clip from the feature cache. The clip-aware context feature is then encoded via cross-attention between the current frame and its fetched adaptive clip, and further utilized to enhance the time modeling for accurate online surgical phase recognition. The benchmark results on three public datasets, i.e., Cholec80, M2CAI16, and AutoLaparo, demonstrate the superiority of our proposed DACAT over existing state-of-the-art methods, with improvements in Jaccard scores of at least 4.5%, 4.6%, and 2.7%, respectively. Our code and models have been released at https://github.com/kk42yy/DACAT.

### Design and Implementation of Online Live Streaming System Using A 3D   Engine
**Authors**: Aizierjiang Aiersilan

**Updated**: 2024-09-10T04:24:22Z

**Summary**: With the growing demand for live video streaming, there is an increasing need for low-latency and high-quality transmission, especially with the advent of 5G networks. While 5G offers hardware-level improvements, effective software solutions for minimizing latency remain essential. Current methods, such as multi-channel streaming, fail to address latency issues fundamentally, often only adding new channels without optimizing overall performance. This thesis proposes a novel approach using a 3D engine (e.g., Unity 3D) to stream multi-input video data through a single channel with reduced latency. By leveraging 3D engine capabilities, such as World/Screen Space Cameras, 3D Canvases, and Webcam Textures, the proposed system consolidates video streams from multiple external cameras into a unified, low-latency output. The affiliated project of this thesis demonstrates the implementation of a low-latency multi-channel live video streaming system. It employs the RTSP protocol and examines video encoding techniques, alongside a client-side application based on Unity 3D. The system architecture includes a WebSocket server for persistent connections, an HTTP server for communication, a MySQL database for storage, Redis for caching, and Nginx for load balancing. Each module operates independently, ensuring flexibility and scalability in the system's design. A key innovation of this system is its use of a 3D scene to map multiple video inputs onto a virtual canvas, recorded by an in-engine camera for transmission. This design minimizes redundant data, enabling an efficient and director-guided live streaming network. The thesis concludes by discussing challenges encountered during the project and provides solutions for future improvement.

### Flash Cache: Reducing Bias in Radiance Cache Based Inverse Rendering
**Authors**: Benjamin Attal, Dor Verbin, Ben Mildenhall, Peter Hedman, Jonathan T. Barron, Matthew O'Toole, Pratul P. Srinivasan

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T17:59:57Z

**Summary**: State-of-the-art techniques for 3D reconstruction are largely based on volumetric scene representations, which require sampling multiple points to compute the color arriving along a ray. Using these representations for more general inverse rendering -- reconstructing geometry, materials, and lighting from observed images -- is challenging because recursively path-tracing such volumetric representations is expensive. Recent works alleviate this issue through the use of radiance caches: data structures that store the steady-state, infinite-bounce radiance arriving at any point from any direction. However, these solutions rely on approximations that introduce bias into the renderings and, more importantly, into the gradients used for optimization. We present a method that avoids these approximations while remaining computationally efficient. In particular, we leverage two techniques to reduce variance for unbiased estimators of the rendering equation: (1) an occlusion-aware importance sampler for incoming illumination and (2) a fast cache architecture that can be used as a control variate for the radiance from a high-quality, but more expensive, volumetric cache. We show that by removing these biases our approach improves the generality of radiance cache based inverse rendering, as well as increasing quality in the presence of challenging light transport effects such as specular reflections.

**Authors**: Yuntian Deng, Wenting Zhao, Jack Hessel, Xiang Ren, Claire Cardie, Yejin Choi

**Updated**: 2024-09-09T10:04:00Z

**Summary**: The increasing availability of real-world conversation data offers exciting opportunities for researchers to study user-chatbot interactions. However, the sheer volume of this data makes manually examining individual conversations impractical. To overcome this challenge, we introduce WildVis, an interactive tool that enables fast, versatile, and large-scale conversation analysis. WildVis provides search and visualization capabilities in the text and embedding spaces based on a list of criteria. To manage million-scale datasets, we implemented optimizations including search index construction, embedding precomputation and compression, and caching to ensure responsive user interactions within seconds. We demonstrate WildVis' utility through three case studies: facilitating chatbot misuse research, visualizing and comparing topic distributions across datasets, and characterizing user-specific conversation patterns. WildVis is open-source and designed to be extendable, supporting additional datasets and customized search and visualization functionalities.

### Cooperative Learning-Based Framework for VNF Caching and Placement   Optimization over Low Earth Orbit Satellite Networks
**Authors**: Khai Doan, Marios Avgeris, Aris Leivadeas, Ioannis Lambadaris, Wonjae Shin

**Updated**: 2024-09-08T08:39:50Z

**Summary**: Low Earth Orbit Satellite Networks (LSNs) are integral to supporting a broad range of modern applications, which are typically modeled as Service Function Chains (SFCs). Each SFC is composed of Virtual Network Functions (VNFs), where each VNF performs a specific task. In this work, we tackle two key challenges in deploying SFCs across an LSN. Firstly, we aim to optimize the long-term system performance by minimizing the average end-to-end SFC execution delay, given that each satellite comes with a pre-installed/cached subset of VNFs. To achieve optimal SFC placement, we formulate an offline Dynamic Programming (DP) equation. To overcome the challenges associated with DP, such as its complexity, the need for probability knowledge, and centralized decision-making, we put forth an online Multi-Agent Q-Learning (MAQL) solution. Our MAQL approach addresses convergence issues in the non-stationary LSN environment by enabling satellites to share learning parameters and update their Q-tables based on distinct rules for their selected actions. Secondly, to determine the optimal VNF subsets for satellite caching, we develop a Bayesian Optimization (BO)-based learning mechanism that operates both offline and continuously in the background during runtime. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our MAQL approach achieves near-optimal performance comparable to the DP model and significantly outperforms existing baselines. Moreover, the BO-based approach effectively enhances the request serving rate over time.

### InstInfer: In-Storage Attention Offloading for Cost-Effective   Long-Context LLM Inference
**Authors**: Xiurui Pan, Endian Li, Qiao Li, Shengwen Liang, Yizhou Shan, Ke Zhou, Yingwei Luo, Xiaolin Wang, Jie Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-09-08T06:06:44Z

**Summary**: The widespread of Large Language Models (LLMs) marks a significant milestone in generative AI. Nevertheless, the increasing context length and batch size in offline LLM inference escalate the memory requirement of the key-value (KV) cache, which imposes a huge burden on the GPU VRAM, especially for resource-constraint scenarios (e.g., edge computing and personal devices). Several cost-effective solutions leverage host memory or SSDs to reduce storage costs for offline inference scenarios and improve the throughput. Nevertheless, they suffer from significant performance penalties imposed by intensive KV cache accesses due to limited PCIe bandwidth. To address these issues, we propose InstInfer, a novel LLM inference system that offloads the most performance-critical computation (i.e., attention in decoding phase) and data (i.e., KV cache) parts to Computational Storage Drives (CSDs), which minimize the enormous KV transfer overheads. InstInfer designs a dedicated flash-aware in-storage attention engine with KV cache management mechanisms to exploit the high internal bandwidths of CSDs instead of being limited by the PCIe bandwidth. The optimized P2P transmission between GPU and CSDs further reduces data migration overheads. Experimental results demonstrate that for a 13B model using an NVIDIA A6000 GPU, InstInfer improves throughput for long-sequence inference by up to 11.1$\times$, compared to existing SSD-based solutions such as FlexGen.

### Training-Free Style Consistent Image Synthesis with Condition and Mask   Guidance in E-Commerce
**Authors**: Guandong Li

**Updated**: 2024-09-07T07:50:13Z

**Summary**: Generating style-consistent images is a common task in the e-commerce field, and current methods are largely based on diffusion models, which have achieved excellent results. This paper introduces the concept of the QKV (query/key/value) level, referring to modifications in the attention maps (self-attention and cross-attention) when integrating UNet with image conditions. Without disrupting the product's main composition in e-commerce images, we aim to use a train-free method guided by pre-set conditions. This involves using shared KV to enhance similarity in cross-attention and generating mask guidance from the attention map to cleverly direct the generation of style-consistent images. Our method has shown promising results in practical applications.

### MiniCache: KV Cache Compression in Depth Dimension for Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Akide Liu, Jing Liu, Zizheng Pan, Yefei He, Gholamreza Haffari, Bohan Zhuang

**Updated**: 2024-09-07T02:52:29Z

**Summary**: A critical approach for efficiently deploying computationally demanding large language models (LLMs) is Key-Value (KV) caching. The KV cache stores key-value states of previously generated tokens, significantly reducing the need for repetitive computations and thereby lowering latency in autoregressive generation. However, the size of the KV cache grows linearly with sequence length, posing challenges for applications requiring long context input and extensive sequence generation. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective approach, called MiniCache, to compress the KV cache across layers from a novel depth perspective, significantly reducing the memory footprint for LLM inference. Our approach is based on the observation that KV cache states exhibit high similarity between the adjacent layers in the middle-to-deep portion of LLMs. To facilitate merging, we propose disentangling the states into the magnitude and direction components, interpolating the directions of the state vectors while preserving their lengths unchanged. Furthermore, we introduce a token retention strategy to keep highly distinct state pairs unmerged, thus preserving the information with minimal additional storage overhead. Our MiniCache is training-free and general, complementing existing KV cache compression strategies, such as quantization and sparsity. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of MiniCache utilizing various models including LLaMA-2, LLaMA-3, Phi-3, Mistral, and Mixtral across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating its exceptional performance in achieving superior compression ratios and high throughput. On the ShareGPT dataset, LLaMA-2-7B with 4-bit MiniCache achieves a remarkable compression ratio of up to 5.02x, enhances inference throughput by approximately 5x, and reduces the memory footprint by 41% compared to the FP16 full cache baseline, all while maintaining near-lossless performance.

### QET: Enhancing Quantized LLM Parameters and KV cache Compression through   Element Substitution and Residual Clustering
**Authors**: Yanshu Wang, Wang Li, Zhaoqian Yao, Tong Yang

**Updated**: 2024-09-06T08:28:01Z

**Summary**: The matrix quantization entails representing matrix elements in a more space-efficient form to reduce storage usage, with dequantization restoring the original matrix for use. We formulate the Quantization Error Minimization (QEM) problem as minimizing the distance between a matrix before and after quantization, under the condition that the quantized matrix occupies the same memory space. Matrix quantization is crucial in various applications, including Large Language Models (LLMs) weight quantization, vector databases, KV cache quantization, graph compression, and image compression. Recent advancements in LLMs, such as GPT-4 and BERT, have highlighted the importance of matrix compression due to the large size of parameters and KV cache, which are stored as matrices.   We propose Quantum Entanglement Trees (QET) to address the QEM problem by leveraging the local orderliness of matrix elements, involving iterative element swapping to form a locally ordered matrix. This matrix is then grouped and quantized by columns. To enhance QET, we introduce two optimizations: further quantizing residuals to reduce MSE, and using masking and batch processing to accelerate the algorithm.   Experimental results demonstrate that QET can effectively reduce MSE to 5.05%, 13.33%, and 11.89% of the current best method on the LLM dataset, K cache, and V cache, respectively. Our contributions include the abstraction of the QEM problem, the design of the QET algorithm, and the proposal of two optimizations to improve accuracy and speed.

### A First Look At Efficient And Secure On-Device LLM Inference Against KV   Leakage
**Authors**: Huan Yang, Deyu Zhang, Yudong Zhao, Yuanchun Li, Yunxin Liu

**Updated**: 2024-09-06T06:16:55Z

**Summary**: Running LLMs on end devices has garnered significant attention recently due to their advantages in privacy preservation. With the advent of lightweight LLM models and specially designed GPUs, on-device LLM inference has achieved the necessary accuracy and performance metrics. However, we have identified that LLM inference on GPUs can leak privacy-sensitive intermediate information, specifically the KV pairs. An attacker could exploit these KV pairs to reconstruct the entire user conversation, leading to significant vulnerabilities. Existing solutions, such as Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) and Trusted Execution Environments (TEE), are either too computation-intensive or resource-limited. To address these issues, we designed KV-Shield, which operates in two phases. In the initialization phase, it permutes the weight matrices so that all KV pairs are correspondingly permuted. During the runtime phase, the attention vector is inversely permuted to ensure the correctness of the layer output. All permutation-related operations are executed within the TEE, ensuring that insecure GPUs cannot access the original KV pairs, thus preventing conversation reconstruction. Finally, we theoretically analyze the correctness of KV-Shield, along with its advantages and overhead.

### Potential and Limitation of High-Frequency Cores and Caches
**Authors**: Kunal Pai, Anusheel Nand, Jason Lowe-Power

**Updated**: 2024-09-05T20:21:54Z

**Summary**: This paper explores the potential of cryogenic semiconductor computing and superconductor electronics as promising alternatives to traditional semiconductor devices. As semiconductor devices face challenges such as increased leakage currents and reduced performance at higher temperatures, these novel technologies offer high performance and low power computation. Conventional semiconductor electronics operating at cryogenic temperatures (below -150{\deg}C or 123.15 K) can benefit from reduced leakage currents and improved electron mobility. On the other hand, superconductor electronics, operating below 10 K, allow electrons to flow without resistance, offering the potential for ultra-low-power, high-speed computation. This study presents a comprehensive performance modeling and analysis of these technologies and provides insights into their potential benefits and limitations. We implement models of in-order and out-of-order cores operating at high clock frequencies associated with superconductor electronics and cryogenic semiconductor computing in gem5. We evaluate the performance of these components using workloads representative of real-world applications like NPB, SPEC CPU2006, and GAPBS. Our results show the potential speedups achievable by these components and the limitations posed by cache bandwidth. This work provides valuable insights into the performance implications and design trade-offs associated with cryogenic and superconductor technologies, laying the foundation for future research in this field using gem5.

### Libra: Architectural Support For Principled, Secure And Efficient   Balanced Execution On High-End Processors (Extended Version)
**Authors**: Hans Winderix, Marton Bognar, Lesly-Ann Daniel, Frank Piessens

**Updated**: 2024-09-05T17:56:19Z

**Summary**: Control-flow leakage (CFL) attacks enable an attacker to expose control-flow decisions of a victim program via side-channel observations. Linearization (i.e., elimination) of secret-dependent control flow is the main countermeasure against these attacks, yet it comes at a non-negligible cost. Conversely, balancing secret-dependent branches often incurs a smaller overhead, but is notoriously insecure on high-end processors. Hence, linearization has been widely believed to be the only effective countermeasure against CFL attacks. In this paper, we challenge this belief and investigate an unexplored alternative: how to securely balance secret-dependent branches on higher-end processors?   We propose Libra, a generic and principled hardware-software codesign to efficiently address CFL on high-end processors. We perform a systematic classification of hardware primitives leaking control flow from the literature, and provide guidelines to handle them with our design. Importantly, Libra enables secure control-flow balancing without the need to disable performance-critical hardware such as the instruction cache and the prefetcher. We formalize the semantics of Libra and propose a code transformation algorithm for securing programs, which we prove correct and secure. Finally, we implement and evaluate Libra on an out-of-order RISC-V processor, showing performance overhead on par with insecure balanced code, and outperforming state-of-the-art linearized code by 19.3%.

### Enabling Practical and Privacy-Preserving Image Processing
**Authors**: Chao Wang, Shubing Yang, Xiaoyan Sun, Jun Dai, Dongfang Zhao

**Updated**: 2024-09-05T14:22:02Z

**Summary**: Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) enables computations on encrypted data, preserving confidentiality without the need for decryption. However, FHE is often hindered by significant performance overhead, particularly for high-precision and complex data like images. Due to serious efficiency issues, traditional FHE methods often encrypt images by monolithic data blocks (such as pixel rows), instead of pixels. However, this strategy compromises the advantages of homomorphic operations and disables pixel-level image processing. In this study, we address these challenges by proposing and implementing a pixel-level homomorphic encryption approach, iCHEETAH, based on the CKKS scheme. To enhance computational efficiency, we introduce three novel caching mechanisms to pre-encrypt radix values or frequently occurring pixel values, substantially reducing redundant encryption operations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves up to a 19-fold improvement in encryption speed compared to the original CKKS, while maintaining high image quality. Additionally, real-world image applications such as mean filtering, brightness enhancement, image matching and watermarking are tested based on FHE, showcasing up to a 91.53% speed improvement. We also proved that our method is IND-CPA (Indistinguishability under Chosen Plaintext Attack) secure, providing strong encryption security. These results underscore the practicality and efficiency of iCHEETAH, marking a significant advancement in privacy-preserving image processing at scale.

### SELCC: Coherent Caching over Compute-Limited Disaggregated Memory
**Authors**: Ruihong Wang, Jianguo Wang, Walid G. Aref

**Updated**: 2024-09-05T01:12:04Z

**Summary**: Disaggregating memory from compute offers the opportunity to better utilize stranded memory in data centers. It is important to cache data in the compute nodes and maintain cache coherence across multiple compute nodes to save on round-trip communication cost between the disaggregated memory and the compute nodes. However, the limited computing power on the disaggregated memory servers makes it challenging to maintain cache coherence among multiple compute-side caches over disaggregated shared memory. This paper introduces SELCC; a Shared-Exclusive Latch Cache Coherence protocol that maintains cache coherence without imposing any computational burden on the remote memory side. SELCC builds on a one-sided shared-exclusive latch protocol by introducing lazy latch release and invalidation messages among the compute nodes so that it can guarantee both data access atomicity and cache coherence. SELCC minimizes communication round-trips by embedding the current cache copy holder IDs into RDMA latch words and prioritizes local concurrency control over global concurrency control. We instantiate the SELCC protocol onto compute-sided cache, forming an abstraction layer over disaggregated memory. This abstraction layer provides main-memory-like APIs to upper-level applications, and thus enabling existing data structures and algorithms to function over disaggregated memory with minimal code change. To demonstrate the usability of SELCC, we implement a B-tree and three transaction concurrency control algorithms over SELCC's APIs. Micro-benchmark results show that the SELCC protocol achieves better performance compared to RPC-based cache-coherence protocols. Additionally, YCSB and TPC-C benchmarks indicate that applications over SELCC can achieve comparable or superior performance against competitors over disaggregated memory.

### Simultaneous Masking, Not Prompting Optimization: A Paradigm Shift in   Fine-tuning LLMs for Simultaneous Translation
**Authors**: Matthew Raffel, Victor Agostinelli, Lizhong Chen

**Updated**: 2024-09-05T01:06:40Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various language processing tasks, motivating their adoption in simultaneous translation. Current fine-tuning methods to adapt LLMs for simultaneous translation focus on prompting optimization strategies using either data augmentation or prompt structure modifications. However, these methods suffer from several issues, such as unnecessarily expanded training sets, computational inefficiency from dumping the key and value cache, increased prompt sizes, or restriction to a single decision policy. To eliminate these issues, in this work, we propose SimulMask, a new paradigm for fine-tuning LLMs for simultaneous translation. It utilizes a novel attention mask approach that models simultaneous translation during fine-tuning by masking attention for a desired decision policy. Applying the proposed SimulMask on a Falcon LLM for the IWSLT 2017 dataset, we have observed a significant translation quality improvement compared to state-of-the-art prompting optimization strategies on five language pairs while reducing the computational cost.

### SparQ Attention: Bandwidth-Efficient LLM Inference
**Authors**: Luka Ribar, Ivan Chelombiev, Luke Hudlass-Galley, Charlie Blake, Carlo Luschi, Douglas Orr

**Updated**: 2024-09-04T10:04:52Z

**Summary**: The computational difficulties of large language model (LLM) inference remain a significant obstacle to their widespread deployment. The need for many applications to support long input sequences and process them in large batches typically causes token-generation to be bottlenecked by data transfer. For this reason, we introduce SparQ Attention, a technique for increasing the inference throughput of LLMs by utilising memory bandwidth more efficiently within the attention layers, through selective fetching of the cached history. Our proposed technique can be applied directly to off-the-shelf LLMs during inference, without requiring any modification to the pre-training setup or additional fine-tuning. We show that SparQ Attention brings up to 8x savings in attention data transfers without substantial drops in accuracy, by evaluating Llama 2 and 3, Mistral, Gemma and Pythia models on a wide range of downstream tasks.

**Updated**: 2024-09-04T07:13:01Z

**Summary**: KV Vel is a non-eclipsing short-period (P = 0.3571 days) close binary containing a very hot subdwarf primary (77000 K) and a cool low-mass secondary star (3400 K) that is located at the center of the planetary nebula DS 1. The changes in the orbital period of the close binary were analyzed based on 262 new times of light maximum together with those compiled from the literature. It is discovered that the O-C curve shows a small-amplitude (0.0034 days) cyclic period variation with a period of 29.55 years. The explanation by the solar-type magnetic activity cycles of the cool component is ruled out because the required energies are much larger than the total radiant energy of this component in a whole cycle. Therefore, the cyclic variation was plausibly explained as the light-travel time effect via the presence of a tertiary component, which is supported by the periodic changes of the O-C curve and the rather symmetric and stable light curves obtained by TESS. The mass of the tertiary companion is determined to be M_3sini' = 0.060(7) M_sun. If the third body is coplanar with the central binary (i.e., i' = 62.5{\deg}), the mass of the tertiary component is computed as M_3 ~ 0.068 M\sun, and thus it would be below the stable hydrogen-burning limit and is a brown dwarf. The orbital separation is shorter than 9.35 astronomical units (AU). KV Vel together with its surrounding planetary nebula and the brown-dwarf companion may be formed through the common-envelope evolution after the primary filled its Roche lobe during the early asymptotic giant branch stage.

### Contemporary Model Compression on Large Language Models Inference
**Authors**: Dong Liu

**Updated**: 2024-09-03T15:35:01Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing by achieving state-of-the-art results across a variety of tasks. However, the computational demands of LLM inference, including high memory consumption and slow processing speeds, pose significant challenges for real-world applications, particularly on resource-constrained devices. Efficient inference is crucial for scaling the deployment of LLMs to a broader range of platforms, including mobile and edge devices.   This survey explores contemporary techniques in model compression that address these challenges by reducing the size and computational requirements of LLMs while maintaining their performance. We focus on model-level compression methods, including quantization, knowledge distillation, and pruning, as well as system-level optimizations like KV cache efficient design. Each of these methodologies offers a unique approach to optimizing LLMs, from reducing numerical precision to transferring knowledge between models and structurally simplifying neural networks. Additionally, we discuss emerging trends in system-level design that further enhance the efficiency of LLM inference. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of current advancements in model compression and their potential to make LLMs more accessible and practical for diverse applications.

### A Fresh Take on Stale Embeddings: Improving Dense Retriever Training   with Corrector Networks
**Authors**: Nicholas Monath, Will Grathwohl, Michael Boratko, Rob Fergus, Andrew McCallum, Manzil Zaheer

**Updated**: 2024-09-03T13:29:13Z

**Summary**: In dense retrieval, deep encoders provide embeddings for both inputs and targets, and the softmax function is used to parameterize a distribution over a large number of candidate targets (e.g., textual passages for information retrieval). Significant challenges arise in training such encoders in the increasingly prevalent scenario of (1) a large number of targets, (2) a computationally expensive target encoder model, (3) cached target embeddings that are out-of-date due to ongoing training of target encoder parameters. This paper presents a simple and highly scalable response to these challenges by training a small parametric corrector network that adjusts stale cached target embeddings, enabling an accurate softmax approximation and thereby sampling of up-to-date high scoring "hard negatives." We theoretically investigate the generalization properties of our proposed target corrector, relating the complexity of the network, staleness of cached representations, and the amount of training data. We present experimental results on large benchmark dense retrieval datasets as well as on QA with retrieval augmented language models. Our approach matches state-of-the-art results even when no target embedding updates are made during training beyond an initial cache from the unsupervised pre-trained model, providing a 4-80x reduction in re-embedding computational cost.

### Reward Augmentation in Reinforcement Learning for Testing Distributed   Systems
**Authors**: Andrea Borgarelli, Constantin Enea, Rupak Majumdar, Srinidhi Nagendra

**Updated**: 2024-09-02T15:07:05Z

**Summary**: Bugs in popular distributed protocol implementations have been the source of many downtimes in popular internet services. We describe a randomized testing approach for distributed protocol implementations based on reinforcement learning. Since the natural reward structure is very sparse, the key to successful exploration in reinforcement learning is reward augmentation. We show two different techniques that build on one another. First, we provide a decaying exploration bonus based on the discovery of new states -- the reward decays as the same state is visited multiple times. The exploration bonus captures the intuition from coverage-guided fuzzing of prioritizing new coverage points; in contrast to other schemes, we show that taking the maximum of the bonus and the Q-value leads to more effective exploration. Second, we provide waypoints to the algorithm as a sequence of predicates that capture interesting semantic scenarios. Waypoints exploit designer insight about the protocol and guide the exploration to ``interesting'' parts of the state space. Our reward structure ensures that new episodes can reliably get to deep interesting states even without execution caching. We have implemented our algorithm in Go. Our evaluation on three large benchmarks (RedisRaft, Etcd, and RSL) shows that our algorithm can significantly outperform baseline approaches in terms of coverage and bug finding.

### Learning in Hybrid Active Inference Models
**Authors**: Poppy Collis, Ryan Singh, Paul F Kinghorn, Christopher L Buckley

**Updated**: 2024-09-02T08:41:45Z

**Summary**: An open problem in artificial intelligence is how systems can flexibly learn discrete abstractions that are useful for solving inherently continuous problems. Previous work in computational neuroscience has considered this functional integration of discrete and continuous variables during decision-making under the formalism of active inference (Parr, Friston & de Vries, 2017; Parr & Friston, 2018). However, their focus is on the expressive physical implementation of categorical decisions and the hierarchical mixed generative model is assumed to be known. As a consequence, it is unclear how this framework might be extended to learning. We therefore present a novel hierarchical hybrid active inference agent in which a high-level discrete active inference planner sits above a low-level continuous active inference controller. We make use of recent work in recurrent switching linear dynamical systems (rSLDS) which implement end-to-end learning of meaningful discrete representations via the piecewise linear decomposition of complex continuous dynamics (Linderman et al., 2016). The representations learned by the rSLDS inform the structure of the hybrid decision-making agent and allow us to (1) specify temporally-abstracted sub-goals in a method reminiscent of the options framework, (2) lift the exploration into discrete space allowing us to exploit information-theoretic exploration bonuses and (3) `cache' the approximate solutions to low-level problems in the discrete planner. We apply our model to the sparse Continuous Mountain Car task, demonstrating fast system identification via enhanced exploration and successful planning through the delineation of abstract sub-goals.

### Throughput Optimization in Cache-aided Networks: An Opportunistic   Probing and Scheduling Approach
**Authors**: Zhou Zhang, Saman Atapattu, Yizhu Wang, Marco Di Renzo

**Updated**: 2024-09-02T02:36:22Z

**Summary**: This paper addresses the challenges of throughput optimization in wireless cache-aided cooperative networks. We propose an opportunistic cooperative probing and scheduling strategy for efficient content delivery. The strategy involves the base station probing the relaying channels and cache states of multiple cooperative nodes, thereby enabling opportunistic user scheduling for content delivery. Leveraging the theory of Sequentially Planned Decision (SPD) optimization, we dynamically formulate decisions on cooperative probing and stopping time. Our proposed Reward Expected Thresholds (RET)-based strategy optimizes opportunistic probing and scheduling. This approach significantly enhances system throughput by exploiting gains from local caching, cooperative transmission and time diversity. Simulations confirm the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed Media Access Control (MAC) strategy.

**Authors**: Jiajie Li, Jan-Niklas Schmelzle, Yixiao Du, Simon Heumos, Andrea Guarracino, Giulia Guidi, Pjotr Prins, Erik Garrison, Zhiru Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-09-02T00:05:20Z

**Summary**: Computational Pangenomics is an emerging field that studies genetic variation using a graph structure encompassing multiple genomes. Visualizing pangenome graphs is vital for understanding genome diversity. Yet, handling large graphs can be challenging due to the high computational demands of the graph layout process.   In this work, we conduct a thorough performance characterization of a state-of-the-art pangenome graph layout algorithm, revealing significant data-level parallelism, which makes GPUs a promising option for compute acceleration. However, irregular data access and the algorithm's memory-bound nature present significant hurdles. To overcome these challenges, we develop a solution implementing three key optimizations: a cache-friendly data layout, coalesced random states, and warp merging. Additionally, we propose a quantitative metric for scalable evaluation of pangenome layout quality.   Evaluated on 24 human whole-chromosome pangenomes, our GPU-based solution achieves a 57.3x speedup over the state-of-the-art multithreaded CPU baseline without layout quality loss, reducing execution time from hours to minutes.

### Resource Management for IRS-Assisted Full-Duplex Integrated Sensing,   Communication and Computing Systems
**Authors**: Wanming Hao, Xue Wu, Xingwang Li, Gangcan Sun, Qingqing Wu, Liang Yang

**Updated**: 2024-08-31T06:33:50Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we investigate an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) assisted full-duplex (FD) integrated sensing, communication and computing system. Specifically, an FD base station (BS) provides service for uplink and downlink transmission, and a local cache is connected to the BS through a backhaul link to store data. Meanwhile, active sensing elements are deployed on the IRS to receive target echo signals. On this basis, in order to evaluate the overall performance of the system under consideration, we propose a system utility maximization problem while ensuring the sensing quality, expressed as the difference between the sum of communication throughput, total computation bits (offloading bits and local computation bits) and the total backhaul cost for content delivery. This makes the problem difficult to solve due to the highly non-convex coupling of the optimization variables. To effectively solve this problem, we first design the most effective caching strategy. Then, we develop an algorithm based on weighted minimum mean square error, alternative direction method of multipliers, majorization-minimization framework, semi-definite relaxation techniques, and several complex transformations to jointly solve the optimization variables. Finally, simulation results are provided to verify the utility performance of the proposed algorithm and demonstrate the advantages of the proposed scheme compared with the baseline scheme.

### >3kV NiO/Ga2O3 Heterojunction Diodes with Space-Modulated Junction   Termination Extension and Sub-1V Turn-on
**Authors**: Advait Gilankar, Abishek Katta, Nabasindhu Das, Nidhin Kurian Kalarickal

**Updated**: 2024-08-31T04:20:58Z

**Summary**: This work demonstrates high-performance vertical NiO/Ga2O3 heterojunction diodes (HJDs) with a 2-step space-modulated junction termination extension. Distinct from the current state-of-the-art Ga2O3 HJDs, we achieve breakdown voltage exceeding 3 kV with a low turn on voltage (VON) of 0.8V, estimated at a forward current density (IF) of 1 A-cm-2. The measured devices exhibit excellent turn-on characteristics achieving 100 A-cm-2 current density at a forward bias of 1.5V along with a low differential specific on-resistance (Ron,sp) of 4.4 m{\Omega}-cm2. The SM-JTE was realized using concentric NiO rings with varying widths and spacing that approximates a gradual reduction in JTE charge. The unipolar figure of merit (FOM) calculated exceeds 2 GW-cm2 and is among the best reported for devices with a sub-1V turn-on. The fabricated devices also displayed minimal change in forward I-V characteristics post reverse bias stress of 3 kV applied during breakdown voltage testing.

### Adaptive Multi-Resolution Encoding for Interactive Large-Scale Volume   Visualization through Functional Approximation
**Authors**: Jianxin Sun, David Lenz, Hongfeng Yu, Tom Peterka

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T18:04:53Z

**Summary**: Functional approximation as a high-order continuous representation provides a more accurate value and gradient query compared to the traditional discrete volume representation. Volume visualization directly rendered from functional approximation generates high-quality rendering results without high-order artifacts caused by trilinear interpolations. However, querying an encoded functional approximation is computationally expensive, especially when the input dataset is large, making functional approximation impractical for interactive visualization. In this paper, we proposed a novel functional approximation multi-resolution representation, Adaptive-FAM, which is lightweight and fast to query. We also design a GPU-accelerated out-of-core multi-resolution volume visualization framework that directly utilizes the Adaptive-FAM representation to generate high-quality rendering with interactive responsiveness. Our method can not only dramatically decrease the caching time, one of the main contributors to input latency, but also effectively improve the cache hit rate through prefetching. Our approach significantly outperforms the traditional function approximation method in terms of input latency while maintaining comparable rendering quality.

**Authors**: Bobby Xiong, Davide Fioriti, Fabian Neumann, Iegor Riepin, Tom Brown

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T10:26:50Z

**Summary**: This paper provides the background, methodology and validation for constructing a representation of the European high-voltage grid, including and above 200 kV, based on public data provided by OpenStreetMap. The model-independent grid dataset is published under the Open Data Commons Open Database (ODbL 1.0) licence and can be used for large-scale electricity as well as energy system modelling. The dataset and workflow are provided as part of PyPSA-Eur -- an open-source, sector-coupled optimisation model of the European energy system. By integrating with the codebase for initiatives such as PyPSA-Earth, the value of open and maintainable high-voltage grid data extends to the global context. By accessing the latest data through the the Overpass turbo API, the dataset can be easily reconstructed and updated within minutes. To assess the data quality, this paper further compares the dataset with official statistics and representative model runs using PyPSA-Eur based on different electricity grid representations.

### MemLong: Memory-Augmented Retrieval for Long Text Modeling
**Authors**: Weijie Liu, Zecheng Tang, Juntao Li, Kehai Chen, Min Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-08-30T02:01:56Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have yielded remarkable success across diverse fields. However, handling long contexts remains a significant challenge for LLMs due to the quadratic time and space complexity of attention mechanisms and the growing memory consumption of the key-value cache during generation. This work introduces MemLong: Memory-Augmented Retrieval for Long Text Generation, a method designed to enhance the capabilities of long-context language modeling by utilizing an external retriever for historical information retrieval. MemLong combines a non-differentiable ``ret-mem'' module with a partially trainable decoder-only language model and introduces a fine-grained, controllable retrieval attention mechanism that leverages semantic-level relevant chunks. Comprehensive evaluations on multiple long-context language modeling benchmarks demonstrate that MemLong consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art LLMs. More importantly, MemLong can extend the context length on a single 3090 GPU from 4k up to 80k.

### Smart Helper-Aided F-RANs: Improving Delay and Reducing Fronthaul Load
**Authors**: Hesameddin Mokhtarzadeh, Mohammed S. Al-Abiad, Md Jahangir Hossain, Julian Cheng

**Updated**: 2024-08-29T17:43:26Z

**Summary**: In traditional Fog-Radio Access Networks (F-RANs), enhanced remote radio heads (eRRHs) are connected to a macro base station (MBS) through fronthaul links. Deploying a massive number of eRRHs is not always feasible due to site constraints and the cost of fronthaul links. This paper introduces an innovative concept of using smart helpers (SHs) in F-RANs. These SHs do not require fronthaul links and listen to the nearby eRRHs' communications. Then, they smartly select and cache popular content. This capability enables SHs to serve users with frequent on-demand service requests potentially. As such, network operators have the flexibility to easily deploy SHs in various scenarios, such as dense urban areas and temporary public events, to expand their F-RANs and improve the quality of service (QoS). To study the performance of the proposed SH-aided F-RAN, we formulate an optimization problem of minimizing the average transmission delay that jointly optimizes cache resources and user scheduling. To tackle the formulated problem, we develop an innovative multi-stage algorithm that uses a reinforcement learning (RL) framework. Various performance measures, e.g., the average transmission delay, fronthaul load, and cache hit rate of the proposed SH-aided F-RAN are evaluated numerically and compared with those of traditional F-RANs.

### VideoLLM-MoD: Efficient Video-Language Streaming with Mixture-of-Depths   Vision Computation
**Authors**: Shiwei Wu, Joya Chen, Kevin Qinghong Lin, Qimeng Wang, Yan Gao, Qianli Xu, Tong Xu, Yao Hu, Enhong Chen, Mike Zheng Shou

**Updated**: 2024-08-29T17:21:58Z

**Summary**: A well-known dilemma in large vision-language models (e.g., GPT-4, LLaVA) is that while increasing the number of vision tokens generally enhances visual understanding, it also significantly raises memory and computational costs, especially in long-term, dense video frame streaming scenarios. Although learnable approaches like Q-Former and Perceiver Resampler have been developed to reduce the vision token burden, they overlook the context causally modeled by LLMs (i.e., key-value cache), potentially leading to missed visual cues when addressing user queries. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to reduce vision compute by leveraging redundant vision tokens "skipping layers" rather than decreasing the number of vision tokens. Our method, VideoLLM-MoD, is inspired by mixture-of-depths LLMs and addresses the challenge of numerous vision tokens in long-term or streaming video. Specifically, for each transformer layer, we learn to skip the computation for a high proportion (e.g., 80\%) of vision tokens, passing them directly to the next layer. This approach significantly enhances model efficiency, achieving approximately \textasciitilde42\% time and \textasciitilde30\% memory savings for the entire training. Moreover, our method reduces the computation in the context and avoid decreasing the vision tokens, thus preserving or even improving performance compared to the vanilla model. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of VideoLLM-MoD, showing its state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks, including narration, forecasting, and summarization tasks in COIN, Ego4D, and Ego-Exo4D datasets.

### GEAR: An Efficient KV Cache Compression Recipe for Near-Lossless   Generative Inference of LLM
**Authors**: Hao Kang, Qingru Zhang, Souvik Kundu, Geonhwa Jeong, Zaoxing Liu, Tushar Krishna, Tuo Zhao

**Updated**: 2024-08-29T16:48:58Z

**Summary**: Key-value (KV) caching has become the de-facto to accelerate generation speed for large language models (LLMs) inference. However, the growing cache demand with increasing sequence length has transformed LLM inference to be a memory bound problem, significantly constraining the system throughput. Existing methods rely on dropping unimportant tokens or quantizing all entries uniformly. Such methods, however, often incur high approximation errors to represent the compressed matrices. The autoregressive decoding process further compounds the error of each step, resulting in critical deviation in model generation and deterioration of performance. To tackle this challenge, we propose GEAR, an efficient KV cache compression framework that achieves near-lossless high-ratio compression. GEAR first applies quantization to majority of entries of similar magnitudes to ultra-low precision. It then employs a low rank matrix to approximate the quantization error, and a sparse matrix to remedy individual errors from outlier entries. By adeptly integrating three techniques, GEAR is able to fully exploit their synergistic potentials. Our experiments demonstrate that compared to alternatives, GEAR achieves near-lossless 4-bit KV cache compression with up to 2.38x throughput improvement, while reducing peak-memory size up to 2.29x. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/HaoKang-Timmy/GEAR.

### LightSLH: Provable and Low-Overhead Spectre v1 Mitigation through   Targeted Instruction Hardening
**Authors**: Yiming Zhu, Wenchao Huang, Yan Xiong

**Updated**: 2024-08-29T02:31:28Z

**Summary**: Several software mitigations have been proposed to defend against Spectre vulnerabilities. However, these countermeasures often suffer from high performance overhead, largely due to unnecessary protections. We propose LightSLH, designed to mitigate this overhead by hardening instructions only when they are under threat from Spectre vulnerabilities. LightSLH leverages program analysis techniques based on abstract interpretation to identify all instructions that could potentially lead to Spectre vulnerabilities and provides provable protection. To enhance analysis efficiency and precision, LightSLH employs novel taint and value domains. The taint domain enables bit-level taint tracking, while the value domain allows LightSLH to analyze complex program structures such as pointers and structures. Furthermore, LightSLH uses a two-stage abstract interpretation approach to circumvent potential analysis paralysis issues.   We demonstrate the security guarantees of LightSLH and evaluate its performance on cryptographic algorithm implementations from OpenSSL. LightSLH significantly reduces the overhead associated with speculative-load-hardening techniques. Our results show that LightSLH introduces no protection and thus no overhead on 4 out of the 7 studied algorithms, which contrasts with existing countermeasures that introduce additional overhead due to unnecessary hardening. Additionally, LightSLH performs, for the first time, a rigorous analysis of the security guarantees of RSA against Spectre v1, highlighting that the memory access patterns generated by the scatter-gather algorithm depend on secrets, even for observers at the cache line granularity, necessitating protection for such accesses.

### On the Impact of ISA Extension on Energy Consumption of I-Cache in   Extensible Processors
**Authors**: Noushin Behboudi, Mehdi Kamal, Ali Afzali-Kusha

**Updated**: 2024-08-28T17:28:12Z

**Summary**: As is widely known, the computational speed and power consumption are two critical parameters in microprocessor design. A solution for these issues is the application specific instruction set processor (ASIP) methodology, which can improve speed and reduce power consumption of the general purpose processor (GPP) technique. In ASIP, changing the instruction set architecture (ISA) of the processor will lead to alter the number and the mean time of accesses to the cache memory. This issue has a direct impact on the processor energy consumption. In this work, we study the impacts of extended ISA on the energy consumption of the extended ISA processor. Also, we demonstrate the extended ISA let the designer to reduce the cache size in order to minimize the energy consumption while meeting performance constraint.

### RIP Linked List
**Authors**: Benoît Sonntag, Dominique Colnet

**Updated**: 2024-08-28T08:41:45Z

**Summary**: Linked lists have long served as a valuable teaching tool in programming. However, the question arises: Are they truly practical for everyday program use? In most cases, it appears that array-based data structures offer distinct advantages, particularly in terms of memory efficiency and,more importantly, execution speed. While it's relatively straightforward to calculate the complexity of operations, gauging actual execution efficiency remains a challenge. This paper addresses this question by introducing a new benchmark. Our study compares various linked list implementations with several array-based alternatives. We also demonstrate the ease of incorporating memory caching for linked lists, enhancing their performance. Additionally, we introduce a new array-based data structure designed to excel in a wide range of operations.

### Efficient LLM Training and Serving with Heterogeneous Context Sharding   among Attention Heads
**Authors**: Xihui Lin, Yunan Zhang, Suyu Ge, Barun Patra, Vishrav Chaudhary, Hao Peng, Xia Song

**Updated**: 2024-08-27T22:06:20Z

**Summary**: Existing LLM training and inference frameworks struggle in boosting efficiency with sparsity while maintaining the integrity of context and model architecture. Inspired by the sharding concept in database and the fact that attention parallelizes over heads on accelerators, we propose Sparsely-Sharded (S2) Attention, an attention algorithm that allocates heterogeneous context partitions for different attention heads to divide and conquer. S2-Attention enforces each attention head to only attend to a partition of contexts following a strided sparsity pattern, while the full context is preserved as the union of all the shards. As attention heads are processed in separate thread blocks, the context reduction for each head can thus produce end-to-end speed-up and memory reduction. At inference, LLMs trained with S2-Attention can then take the KV cache reduction as free meals with guaranteed model quality preserve. In experiments, we show S2-Attentioncan provide as much as (1) 25.3X wall-clock attention speed-up over FlashAttention-2, resulting in 6X reduction in end-to-end training time and 10X inference latency, (2) on-par model training quality compared to default attention, (3)perfect needle retrieval accuracy over 32K context window. On top of the algorithm, we build DKernel, an LLM training and inference kernel library that allows users to customize sparsity patterns for their own models. We open-sourced DKerneland make it compatible with Megatron, Pytorch, and vLLM.

### Styx: Transactional Stateful Functions on Streaming Dataflows
**Authors**: Kyriakos Psarakis, George Siachamis, George Christodoulou, Marios Fragkoulis, Asterios Katsifodimos

**Updated**: 2024-08-27T17:30:41Z

**Summary**: Developing stateful cloud applications, such as low-latency workflows and microservices with strict consistency requirements, remains arduous for programmers. The Stateful Functions-as-a-Service (SFaaS) paradigm aims to serve these use cases. However, existing approaches either provide serializable transactional guarantees at the level of individual functions, or separate application logic from the state and use inefficient transactional protocols. These design choices increase the execution latency, limiting the adoption of SFaaS systems.   In this paper, we present Styx, a novel SFaaS runtime that executes serializable transactions across functions with exactly-once guarantees. Styx extends a deterministic transactional protocol to support an arbitrary call graph of stateful functions. It introduces a transaction-execution acknowledgment scheme that allows tracking a transactional workflow's SFaaS calls, guaranteeing atomicity and exactly-once processing. Finally, Styx features a function-execution caching mechanism and early transactional commit replies for optimized performance. Experiments with the YCSB-T, TPC-C, and Deathstar benchmarks show that Styx outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by achieving at least one order of magnitude higher throughput while exhibiting near-linear scalability and low latency.

### Writing in the Margins: Better Inference Pattern for Long Context   Retrieval
**Authors**: Melisa Russak, Umar Jamil, Christopher Bryant, Kiran Kamble, Axel Magnuson, Mateusz Russak, Waseem AlShikh

**Updated**: 2024-08-27T09:34:38Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we introduce Writing in the Margins (WiM), a new inference pattern for Large Language Models designed to optimize the handling of long input sequences in retrieval-oriented tasks. This approach leverages the chunked prefill of the key-value cache to perform segment-wise inference, which enables efficient processing of extensive contexts along with the generation and classification of intermediate information ("margins") that guide the model towards specific tasks. This method increases computational overhead marginally while significantly enhancing the performance of off-the-shelf models without the need for fine-tuning. Specifically, we observe that WiM provides an average enhancement of 7.5% in accuracy for reasoning skills (HotpotQA, MultiHop-RAG) and more than a 30.0% increase in the F1-score for aggregation tasks (CWE). Additionally, we show how the proposed pattern fits into an interactive retrieval design that provides end-users with ongoing updates about the progress of context processing, and pinpoints the integration of relevant information into the final response. We release our implementation of WiM using Hugging Face Transformers library at https://github.com/writer/writing-in-the-margins.

### PPVF: An Efficient Privacy-Preserving Online Video Fetching Framework   with Correlated Differential Privacy
**Authors**: Xianzhi Zhang, Yipeng Zhou, Di Wu, Quan Z. Sheng, Miao Hu, Linchang Xiao

**Updated**: 2024-08-27T02:03:36Z

**Summary**: Online video streaming has evolved into an integral component of the contemporary Internet landscape. Yet, the disclosure of user requests presents formidable privacy challenges. As users stream their preferred online videos, their requests are automatically seized by video content providers, potentially leaking users' privacy.   Unfortunately, current protection methods are not well-suited to preserving user request privacy from content providers while maintaining high-quality online video services. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a novel Privacy-Preserving Video Fetching (PPVF) framework, which utilizes trusted edge devices to pre-fetch and cache videos, ensuring the privacy of users' requests while optimizing the efficiency of edge caching. More specifically, we design PPVF with three core components: (1) \textit{Online privacy budget scheduler}, which employs a theoretically guaranteed online algorithm to select non-requested videos as candidates with assigned privacy budgets. Alternative videos are chosen by an online algorithm that is theoretically guaranteed to consider both video utilities and available privacy budgets. (2) \textit{Noisy video request generator}, which generates redundant video requests (in addition to original ones) utilizing correlated differential privacy to obfuscate request privacy. (3) \textit{Online video utility predictor}, which leverages federated learning to collaboratively evaluate video utility in an online fashion, aiding in video selection in (1) and noise generation in (2). Finally, we conduct extensive experiments using real-world video request traces from Tencent Video. The results demonstrate that PPVF effectively safeguards user request privacy while upholding high video caching performance.

### Quest: Query-Aware Sparsity for Efficient Long-Context LLM Inference
**Authors**: Jiaming Tang, Yilong Zhao, Kan Zhu, Guangxuan Xiao, Baris Kasikci, Song Han

**Updated**: 2024-08-26T21:01:02Z

**Summary**: As the demand for long-context large language models (LLMs) increases, models with context windows of up to 128K or 1M tokens are becoming increasingly prevalent. However, long-context LLM inference is challenging since the inference speed decreases significantly as the sequence length grows. This slowdown is primarily caused by loading a large KV cache during self-attention. Previous works have shown that a small portion of critical tokens will dominate the attention outcomes. However, we observe the criticality of a token highly depends on the query. To this end, we propose Quest, a query-aware KV cache selection algorithm. Quest keeps track of the minimal and maximal Key values in KV cache pages and estimates the criticality of a given page using Query vectors. By only loading the Top-K critical KV cache pages for attention, Quest significantly speeds up self-attention without sacrificing accuracy. We show that Quest can achieve up to 2.23x self-attention speedup, which reduces inference latency by 7.03x while performing well on tasks with long dependencies with negligible accuracy loss. Code is available at http://github.com/mit-han-lab/Quest .

### Employing Artificial Intelligence to Steer Exascale Workflows with   Colmena
**Authors**: Logan Ward, J. Gregory Pauloski, Valerie Hayot-Sasson, Yadu Babuji, Alexander Brace, Ryan Chard, Kyle Chard, Rajeev Thakur, Ian Foster

**Updated**: 2024-08-26T17:21:19Z

**Summary**: Computational workflows are a common class of application on supercomputers, yet the loosely coupled and heterogeneous nature of workflows often fails to take full advantage of their capabilities. We created Colmena to leverage the massive parallelism of a supercomputer by using Artificial Intelligence (AI) to learn from and adapt a workflow as it executes. Colmena allows scientists to define how their application should respond to events (e.g., task completion) as a series of cooperative agents. In this paper, we describe the design of Colmena, the challenges we overcame while deploying applications on exascale systems, and the science workflows we have enhanced through interweaving AI. The scaling challenges we discuss include developing steering strategies that maximize node utilization, introducing data fabrics that reduce communication overhead of data-intensive tasks, and implementing workflow tasks that cache costly operations between invocations. These innovations coupled with a variety of application patterns accessible through our agent-based steering model have enabled science advances in chemistry, biophysics, and materials science using different types of AI. Our vision is that Colmena will spur creative solutions that harness AI across many domains of scientific computing.

### Decision-Focused Learning to Predict Action Costs for Planning
**Authors**: Jayanta Mandi, Marco Foschini, Daniel Holler, Sylvie Thiebaux, Jorg Hoffmann, Tias Guns

**Updated**: 2024-08-26T11:29:07Z

**Summary**: In many automated planning applications, action costs can be hard to specify. An example is the time needed to travel through a certain road segment, which depends on many factors, such as the current weather conditions. A natural way to address this issue is to learn to predict these parameters based on input features (e.g., weather forecasts) and use the predicted action costs in automated planning afterward. Decision-Focused Learning (DFL) has been successful in learning to predict the parameters of combinatorial optimization problems in a way that optimizes solution quality rather than prediction quality. This approach yields better results than treating prediction and optimization as separate tasks. In this paper, we investigate for the first time the challenges of implementing DFL for automated planning in order to learn to predict the action costs. There are two main challenges to overcome: (1) planning systems are called during gradient descent learning, to solve planning problems with negative action costs, which are not supported in planning. We propose novel methods for gradient computation to avoid this issue. (2) DFL requires repeated planner calls during training, which can limit the scalability of the method. We experiment with different methods approximating the optimal plan as well as an easy-to-implement caching mechanism to speed up the learning process. As the first work that addresses DFL for automated planning, we demonstrate that the proposed gradient computation consistently yields significantly better plans than predictions aimed at minimizing prediction error; and that caching can temper the computation requirements.

### Trimma: Trimming Metadata Storage and Latency for Hybrid Memory Systems
**Authors**: Yiwei Li, Boyu Tian, Mingyu Gao

**Updated**: 2024-08-26T07:26:27Z

**Summary**: Hybrid main memory systems combine both performance and capacity advantages from heterogeneous memory technologies. With larger capacities, higher associativities, and finer granularities, hybrid memory systems currently exhibit significant metadata storage and lookup overheads for flexibly remapping data blocks between the two memory tiers. To alleviate the inefficiencies of existing designs, we propose Trimma, the combination of a multi-level metadata structure and an efficient metadata cache design. Trimma uses a multi-level metadata table to only track truly necessary address remap entries. The saved memory space is effectively utilized as extra DRAM cache capacity to improve performance. Trimma also uses separate formats to store the entries with non-identity and identity address mappings. This improves the overall remap cache hit rate, further boosting the performance. Trimma is transparent to software and compatible with various types of hybrid memory systems. When evaluated on a representative hybrid memory system with HBM3 and DDR5, Trimma achieves up to 1.68$\times$ and on average 1.33$\times$ speedup benefits, compared to state-of-the-art hybrid memory designs. These results show that Trimma effectively addresses metadata management overheads, especially for future scalable large-scale hybrid memory architectures.

### RollingCache: Using Runtime Behavior to Defend Against Cache Side   Channel Attacks
**Authors**: Divya Ojha, Sandhya Dwarkadas

**Updated**: 2024-08-26T04:32:56Z

**Summary**: Shared caches are vulnerable to side channel attacks through contention in cache sets. Besides being a simple source of information leak, these side channels form useful gadgets for more sophisticated attacks that compromise the security of shared systems.   The fundamental design aspect that contention attacks exploit is the deterministic nature of the set of addresses contending for a cache set. In this paper, we present RollingCache, a cache design that defends against contention attacks by dynamically changing the set of addresses contending for cache sets. Unlike prior defenses, RollingCache does not rely on address encryption/decryption, data relocation, or cache partitioning. We use one level of indirection to implement dynamic mapping controlled by the whole-cache runtime behavior. Our solution does not depend on having defined security domains, and can defend against an attacker running on the same or another core.   We evaluate RollingCache on ChampSim using the SPEC-2017 benchmark suite. Our security evaluation shows that our dynamic mapping removes the deterministic ability to identify the source of contention. The performance evaluation shows an impact of 1.67\% over a mix of workloads, with a corresponding

### Decentralized Federated Learning with Model Caching on Mobile Agents
**Authors**: Xiaoyu Wang, Guojun Xiong, Houwei Cao, Jian Li, Yong Liu

**Updated**: 2024-08-26T03:58:20Z

**Summary**: Federated Learning (FL) aims to train a shared model using data and computation power on distributed agents coordinated by a central server. Decentralized FL (DFL) utilizes local model exchange and aggregation between agents to reduce the communication and computation overheads on the central server. However, when agents are mobile, the communication opportunity between agents can be sporadic, largely hindering the convergence and accuracy of DFL. In this paper, we study delay-tolerant model spreading and aggregation enabled by model caching on mobile agents. Each agent stores not only its own model, but also models of agents encountered in the recent past. When two agents meet, they exchange their own models as well as the cached models. Local model aggregation works on all models in the cache. We theoretically analyze the convergence of DFL with cached models, explicitly taking into account the model staleness introduced by caching. We design and compare different model caching algorithms for different DFL and mobility scenarios. We conduct detailed case studies in a vehicular network to systematically investigate the interplay between agent mobility, cache staleness, and model convergence. In our experiments, cached DFL converges quickly, and significantly outperforms DFL without caching.

### Mobile Edge Computing Networks: Online Low-Latency and Fresh Service   Provisioning
**Authors**: Yuhan Yi, Guanglin Zhang, Hai Jiang

**Updated**: 2024-08-24T15:23:32Z

**Summary**: Edge service caching can significantly mitigate latency and reduce communication and computing overhead by fetching and initializing services (applications) from clouds. The freshness of cached service data is critical when providing satisfactory services to users, but has been overlooked in existing research efforts. In this paper, we study the online low-latency and fresh service provisioning in mobile edge computing (MEC) networks. Specifically, we jointly optimize the service caching, task offloading, and resource allocation without knowledge of future system information, which is formulated as a joint online long-term optimization problem. This problem is NP-hard. To solve the problem, we design a Lyapunov-based online framework that decouples the problem at temporal level into a series of per-time-slot subproblems. For each subproblem, we propose an online integrated optimization-deep reinforcement learning (OIODRL) method, which contains an optimization stage including a quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP) transformation and a semidefinite relaxation (SDR) method, and a learning stage including a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm. Extensive simulations show that the proposed OIODRL method achieves a near-optimal solution and outperforms other benchmark methods.

### MagicDec: Breaking the Latency-Throughput Tradeoff for Long Context   Generation with Speculative Decoding
**Authors**: Jian Chen, Vashisth Tiwari, Ranajoy Sadhukhan, Zhuoming Chen, Jinyuan Shi, Ian En-Hsu Yen, Beidi Chen

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T17:54:34Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become more prevalent in long-context applications such as interactive chatbots, document analysis, and agent workflows, but it is challenging to serve long-context requests with low latency and high throughput. Speculative decoding (SD) is a widely used technique to reduce latency without sacrificing performance but the conventional wisdom suggests that its efficacy is limited to small batch sizes. In MagicDec, we show that surprisingly SD can achieve speedup even for a high throughput inference regime for moderate to long sequences. More interestingly, an intelligent drafting strategy can achieve better speedup with increasing batch size based on our rigorous analysis. MagicDec first identifies the bottleneck shifts with increasing batch size and sequence length, and uses these insights to deploy speculative decoding more effectively for high throughput inference. Then, it leverages draft models with sparse KV cache to address the KV bottleneck that scales with both sequence length and batch size. This finding underscores the broad applicability of speculative decoding in long-context serving, as it can enhance throughput and reduce latency without compromising accuracy. For moderate to long sequences, we demonstrate up to 2x speedup for LLaMA-2-7B-32K and 1.84x speedup for LLaMA-3.1-8B when serving batch sizes ranging from 32 to 256 on 8 NVIDIA A100 GPUs. The code is available at https://github.com/Infini-AI-Lab/MagicDec/.

### Cyclic Wrap-Around Multi-Access Coded Caching with Private Caches
**Authors**: Dhruv Pratap Singh, Anjana A. Mahesh, B. Sundar Rajan

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T15:39:20Z

**Summary**: We consider a variant of the coded caching problem where users connect to two types of caches, called private caches and access caches. The problem setting consists of a server having a library of files and a set of access caches. Every user, equipped with a private cache, connects to $L$ neighboring access caches in a cyclic wrap-around fashion. The server populates the private and access caches with file contents in either coded or uncoded format. For this setting, we derive a lower bound on the optimal worst-case transmission rate using cut-set arguments. This lower bound applies to both coded and uncoded placements. We then provide an achievable scheme with uncoded placement and show that our scheme specializes to the well-known Maddah-Ali-Niesen scheme for the dedicated cache network in the absence of access caches. Finally, we show that the proposed scheme achieves optimality in large memory regimes and provide numerical plots comparing the rate of the proposed scheme with the derived lower bound, demonstrating the optimality of our scheme.

### Fundamental Limits of Multi-Message Private Computation
**Authors**: Ali Gholami, Kai Wan, Tayyebeh Jahani-Nezhad, Hua Sun, Mingyue Ji, Giuseppe Caire

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T13:25:07Z

**Summary**: In a typical formulation of the private information retrieval (PIR) problem, a single user wishes to retrieve one out of $ K$ files from $N$ servers without revealing the demanded file index to any server. This paper formulates an extended model of PIR, referred to as multi-message private computation (MM-PC), where instead of retrieving a single file, the user wishes to retrieve $P>1$ linear combinations of files while preserving the privacy of the demand information. The MM-PC problem is a generalization of the private computation (PC) problem (where the user requests one linear combination of the files), and the multi-message private information retrieval (MM-PIR) problem (where the user requests $P>1$ files). A baseline achievable scheme repeats the optimal PC scheme by Sun and Jafar $P$ times, or treats each possible demanded linear combination as an independent file and then uses the near optimal MM-PIR scheme by Banawan and Ulukus. In this paper, we propose a new MM-PC scheme that significantly improves upon the baseline schemes. In doing so, we design the queries inspired by the structure in the cache-aided scalar linear function retrieval scheme by Wan {\it et al.}, which leverages the dependency between linear functions to reduce the amount of communications. To ensure the decodability of our scheme, we propose a new method to benefit from the existing dependency, referred to as the sign assignment step. In the end, we use Maximum Distance Separable matrices to code the queries, which allows the reduction of download from the servers, while preserving privacy. By the proposed schemes, we characterize the capacity within a multiplicative factor of $2$.

### Which Part of the Heap is Useful? Improving Heap Liveness Analysis
**Authors**: Vini Kanvar, Uday P. Khedker

**Updated**: 2024-08-23T09:54:22Z

**Summary**: With the growing sizes of data structures allocated in heap, understanding the actual use of heap memory is critically important for minimizing cache misses and reclaiming unused memory. A static analysis aimed at this is difficult because the heap locations are unnamed. Using allocation sites to name them creates very few distinctions making it difficult to identify allocated heap locations that are not used. Heap liveness analysis using access graphs solves this problem by (a) using a storeless model of heap memory by naming the locations with access paths, and (b) representing the unbounded sets of access paths (which are regular languages) as finite automata.   We improve the scalability and efficiency of heap liveness analysis, and reduce the amount of computed heap liveness information by using deterministic automata and by minimizing the inclusion of aliased access paths in the language. Practically, our field-, flow-, context-sensitive liveness analysis on SPEC CPU2006 benchmarks scales to 36 kLoC (existing analysis scales to 10.5 kLoC) and improves efficiency even up to 99%. For some of the benchmarks, our technique shows multifold reduction in the computed liveness information, ranging from 2 to 100 times (in terms of the number of live access paths), without compromising on soundness.

### Exposing Shadow Branches
**Authors**: Chrysanthos Pepi, Bhargav Reddy Godala, Krishnam Tibrewala, Gino Chacon, Paul V. Gratz, Daniel A. Jiménez, Gilles A. Pokam, David I. August

**Updated**: 2024-08-22T17:56:29Z

**Summary**: Modern processors implement a decoupled front-end in the form of Fetch Directed Instruction Prefetching (FDIP) to avoid front-end stalls. FDIP is driven by the Branch Prediction Unit (BPU), relying on the BPU's accuracy and branch target tracking structures to speculatively fetch instructions into the Instruction Cache (L1I). As data center applications become more complex, their code footprints also grow, resulting in an increase in Branch Target Buffer (BTB) misses. FDIP can alleviate L1I cache misses, but when it encounters a BTB miss, the BPU may not identify the current instruction as a branch to FDIP. This can prevent FDIP from prefetching or cause it to speculate down the wrong path, further polluting the L1I cache. We observe that the vast majority, 75%, of BTB-missing, unidentified branches are actually present in instruction cache lines that FDIP has previously fetched but, these missing branches have not yet been decoded and inserted into the BTB. This is because the instruction line is decoded from an entry point (which is the target of the previous taken branch) till an exit point (the taken branch). Branch instructions present in the ignored portion of the cache line we call them "Shadow Branches". Here we present Skeia, a novel shadow branch decoding technique that identifies and decodes unused bytes in cache lines fetched by FDIP, inserting them into a Shadow Branch Buffer (SBB). The SBB is accessed in parallel with the BTB, allowing FDIP to speculate despite a BTB miss. With a minimal storage state of 12.25KB, Skeia delivers a geomean speedup of ~5.7% over an 8K-entry BTB (78KB) and ~2% versus adding an equal amount of state to the BTB across 16 front-end bound applications. Since many branches stored in the SBB are unique compared to those in a similarly sized BTB, we consistently observe greater performance gains with Skeia across all examined sizes until saturation.

### Stable CoO$_2$ Nanoscrolls With Outstanding Electrical Properties
**Authors**: Simon Hettler, Kankona Singha Roy, Raul Arenal, Leela S. Panchakarla

**Updated**: 2024-08-22T17:47:49Z

**Summary**: Layered CoO$_2$ is of great interest for its promising properties but is meta-stable in its bulk form. CoO$_2$ was synthesized by converting the quasi-one-dimensional crystal structure of bulk Ca$_3$Co$_2$O$_6$ via a hydrothermal treatment. The resulting nanostructures were predominantly nanoscrolls with very thin walls, which exhibit long-term stability. A detailed structural investigation reveals that the CoO$_2$ is found to crystallize in monoclinic form, similar to the related CaCoO$_2$-CoO$_2$ misfit structure. Individual nanoscrolls are characterized electrically and show a p-type semiconducting nature with a high current-carrying capacity of 4$\cdot$10$^5$ A cm$^{-2}$ and an extremely high breakdown voltage of up to 270 kV/cm. The results demonstrate the possibility to stabilize meta-stable materials in low-dimensional forms and a promising application of the nanoscrolls as interconnect in high-voltage electronic circuitry.

**Summary**: This work provides a complete rheological characterization of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) inks in the presence of electric fields. Several concentrations of MoS2 are studied and dispersed in a viscoelastic fluid. The lubrication effects are present in the ink when the MoS2 concentration is higher than 0.10% w/w. The dielectric properties show the impossibility of a positive electrorheological effect for all MoS2-inks studied. The formation of vortices and electromigration of MoS2 particles occur under the influence of an external electric field. These two phenomena affect the rheological behavior of MoS2-inks under shear flow condition. Relatively to the extensional rheology experiments, the particle migration and the vortex formation promote anisotropy on the rheological properties of the inks which affects the relaxation time, the formation of beads-on-a-string and the uniaxial elongational flow condition is no longer valid. When the electric field strength is 1.5 kV/mm, the formation of Taylor's cone is observed and independent of MoS2 concentration.

### Towards End-to-End GPS Localization with Neural Pseudorange Correction
**Authors**: Xu Weng, KV Ling, Haochen Liu, Kun Cao

**Updated**: 2024-08-21T06:10:02Z

**Summary**: The pseudorange error is one of the root causes of localization inaccuracy in GPS. Previous data-driven methods regress and eliminate pseudorange errors using handcrafted intermediate labels. Unlike them, we propose an end-to-end GPS localization framework, E2E-PrNet, to train a neural network for pseudorange correction (PrNet) directly using the final task loss calculated with the ground truth of GPS receiver states. The gradients of the loss with respect to learnable parameters are backpropagated through a Differentiable Nonlinear Least Squares (DNLS) optimizer to PrNet. The feasibility of fusing the data-driven neural network and the model-based DNLS module is verified with GPS data collected by Android phones, showing that E2E-PrNet outperforms the baseline weighted least squares method and the state-of-the-art end-to-end data-driven approach. Finally, we discuss the explainability of E2E-PrNet.

### Telepathic Datacenters: Fast RPCs using Shared CXL Memory
**Authors**: Suyash Mahar, Ehsan Hajyjasini, Seungjin Lee, Zifeng Zhang, Mingyao Shen, Steven Swanson

**Updated**: 2024-08-21T04:16:49Z

**Summary**: Datacenter applications often rely on remote procedure calls (RPCs) for fast, efficient, and secure communication. However, RPCs are slow, inefficient, and hard to use as they require expensive serialization and compression to communicate over a packetized serial network link. Compute Express Link 3.0 (CXL) offers an alternative solution, allowing applications to share data using a cache-coherent, shared-memory interface across clusters of machines.   RPCool is a new framework that exploits CXL's shared memory capabilities. RPCool avoids serialization by passing pointers to data structures in shared memory. While avoiding serialization is useful, directly sharing pointer-rich data eliminates the isolation that copying data over traditional networks provides, leaving the receiver vulnerable to invalid pointers and concurrent updates to shared data by the sender. RPCool restores this safety with careful and efficient management of memory permissions. Another significant challenge with CXL shared memory capabilities is that they are unlikely to scale to an entire datacenter. RPCool addresses this by falling back to RDMA-based communication.   Overall, RPCool reduces the round-trip latency by 1.93$\times$ and 7.2$\times$ compared to state-of-the-art RDMA and CXL-based RPC mechanisms, respectively. Moreover, RPCool performs either comparably or better than other RPC mechanisms across a range of workloads.

### Hybrid Recurrent Models Support Emergent Descriptions for Hierarchical   Planning and Control
**Authors**: Poppy Collis, Ryan Singh, Paul F Kinghorn, Christopher L Buckley

**Updated**: 2024-08-20T16:02:54Z

**Summary**: An open problem in artificial intelligence is how systems can flexibly learn discrete abstractions that are useful for solving inherently continuous problems. Previous work has demonstrated that a class of hybrid state-space model known as recurrent switching linear dynamical systems (rSLDS) discover meaningful behavioural units via the piecewise linear decomposition of complex continuous dynamics (Linderman et al., 2016). Furthermore, they model how the underlying continuous states drive these discrete mode switches. We propose that the rich representations formed by an rSLDS can provide useful abstractions for planning and control. We present a novel hierarchical model-based algorithm inspired by Active Inference in which a discrete MDP sits above a low-level linear-quadratic controller. The recurrent transition dynamics learned by the rSLDS allow us to (1) specify temporally-abstracted sub-goals in a method reminiscent of the options framework, (2) lift the exploration into discrete space allowing us to exploit information-theoretic exploration bonuses and (3) `cache' the approximate solutions to low-level problems in the discrete planner. We successfully apply our model to the sparse Continuous Mountain Car task, demonstrating fast system identification via enhanced exploration and non-trivial planning through the delineation of abstract sub-goals.

### Pluto and Charon: A Time and Memory Efficient Collaborative Edge AI   Framework for Personal LLMs Fine-Tuning
**Authors**: Bei Ouyang, Shengyuan Ye, Liekang Zeng, Tianyi Qian, Jingyi Li, Xu Chen

**Updated**: 2024-08-20T11:30:12Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have unlocked a plethora of powerful applications at the network edge, such as intelligent personal assistants. Data privacy and security concerns have prompted a shift towards edge-based fine-tuning of personal LLMs, away from cloud reliance. However, this raises issues of computational intensity and resource scarcity, hindering training efficiency and feasibility. While current studies investigate parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques to mitigate resource constraints, our analysis indicates that these techniques are not sufficiently resource-efficient for edge devices. To tackle these challenges, we propose Pluto and Charon (PAC), a time and memory efficient collaborative edge AI framework for personal LLMs fine-tuning. PAC breaks the resource wall of personal LLMs fine-tuning with a sophisticated algorithm-system co-design. (1) Algorithmically, PAC implements a personal LLMs fine-tuning technique that is efficient in terms of parameters, time, and memory. It utilizes Parallel Adapters to circumvent the need for a full backward pass through the LLM backbone. Additionally, an activation cache mechanism further streamlining the process by negating the necessity for repeated forward passes across multiple epochs. (2) Systematically, PAC leverages edge devices in close proximity, pooling them as a collective resource for in-situ personal LLMs fine-tuning, utilizing a hybrid data and pipeline parallelism to orchestrate distributed training. The use of the activation cache eliminates the need for forward pass through the LLM backbone,enabling exclusive fine-tuning of the Parallel Adapters using data parallelism. Extensive evaluation based on prototype implementation demonstrates that PAC remarkably outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving up to 8.64x end-to-end speedup and up to 88.16% reduction in memory footprint.

### Heta: Distributed Training of Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks
**Authors**: Yuchen Zhong, Junwei Su, Chuan Wu, Minjie Wang

**Updated**: 2024-08-20T04:46:18Z

**Summary**: Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) leverage diverse semantic relationships in Heterogeneous Graphs (HetGs) and have demonstrated remarkable learning performance in various applications. However, current distributed GNN training systems often overlook unique characteristics of HetGs, such as varying feature dimensions and the prevalence of missing features among nodes, leading to suboptimal performance or even incompatibility with distributed HGNN training. We introduce Heta, a framework designed to address the communication bottleneck in distributed HGNN training. Heta leverages the inherent structure of HGNNs - independent relation-specific aggregations for each relation, followed by a cross-relation aggregation - and advocates for a novel Relation-Aggregation-First computation paradigm. It performs relation-specific aggregations within graph partitions and then exchanges partial aggregations. This design, coupled with a new graph partitioning method that divides a HetG based on its graph schema and HGNN computation dependency, substantially reduces communication overhead. Heta further incorporates an innovative GPU feature caching strategy that accounts for the different cache miss-penalties associated with diverse node types. Comprehensive evaluations of various HGNN models and large heterogeneous graph datasets demonstrate that Heta outperforms state-of-the-art systems like DGL and GraphLearn by up to 5.8x and 2.3x in end-to-end epoch time, respectively.

### Multi-Mode Lens for Momentum Microscopy and XPEEM: Theory
**Authors**: Olena Tkach, Gerd Schoenhense

**Updated**: 2024-08-19T15:47:17Z

**Summary**: The strong electric field between the sample and the extractor is the core of cathode lenses and a pivotal determinant of high resolution. Nevertheless, fields in the range of 3-8 kV/mm can be a source of complications. Local field enhancement at sharp edges or microscopic protrusions of cleaved samples may result in field emission or flashovers. Moreover, slow background electrons are drawn into the microscope column, where they contribute to space charge effects. A novel front lens configuration, optimized through ray-tracing simulations, significantly reduces the field at the sample and allows even for zero field or retarding field, which serves to suppress space charge effects. One or several annular electrodes, situated in a concentric position relative to the extractor, serve to form an additional lens within the gap between the sample and the extractor. The refractory power of this lens, and consequently the field at the sample surface, can be modified by adjusting the potentials of the annular electrodes. The imaging properties and aberrations of this gap lens have been investigated with regard to momentum imaging and XPEEM. The study encompasses the energy range from the few-eV level for laser-ARPES to 6 keV, for hard X-ray ARPES. The additional converging lens situated in close proximity to the sample exhibits a reduced field curvature of the k-image in the backfocal plane. This allows for the acquisition of larger fields of view in both momentum and real-space imaging.

### Abstract Environment Trimming
**Authors**: Daniel Jurjo-Rivas, Jose F. Morales, Pedro López-García, Manuel V. Hermenegildo

**Updated**: 2024-08-19T09:50:35Z

**Summary**: Variable sharing is a fundamental property in the static analysis of logic programs, since it is instrumental for ensuring correctness and increasing precision while inferring many useful program properties. Such properties include modes, determinacy, non-failure, cost, etc. This has motivated significant work on developing abstract domains to improve the precision and performance of sharing analyses. Much of this work has centered around the family of set-sharing domains, because of the high precision they offer. However, this comes at a price: their scalability to a wide set of realistic programs remains challenging and this hinders their wider adoption. In this work, rather than defining new sharing abstract domains, we focus instead on developing techniques which can be incorporated in the analyzers to address aspects that are known to affect the efficiency of these domains, such as the number of variables, without affecting precision. These techniques are inspired in others used in the context of compiler optimizations, such as expression reassociation and variable trimming. We present several such techniques and provide an extensive experimental evaluation of over 1100 program modules taken from both production code and classical benchmarks. This includes the Spectector cache analyzer, the s(CASP) system, the libraries of the Ciao system, the LPdoc documenter, the PLAI analyzer itself, etc. The experimental results are quite encouraging: we have obtained significant speed-ups, and, more importantly, the number of modules that require a timeout was cut in half. As a result, many more programs can be analyzed precisely in reasonable times.

### AdapMoE: Adaptive Sensitivity-based Expert Gating and Management for   Efficient MoE Inference
**Authors**: Shuzhang Zhong, Ling Liang, Yuan Wang, Runsheng Wang, Ru Huang, Meng Li

**Updated**: 2024-08-19T03:27:15Z

**Summary**: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models are designed to enhance the efficiency of large language models (LLMs) without proportionally increasing the computational demands. However, their deployment on edge devices still faces significant challenges due to high on-demand loading overheads from managing sparsely activated experts. This paper introduces AdapMoE, an algorithm-system co-design framework for efficient MoE inference. AdapMoE features adaptive expert gating and management to reduce the on-demand loading overheads. We observe the heterogeneity of experts loading across layers and tokens, based on which we propose a sensitivity-based strategy to adjust the number of activated experts dynamically. Meanwhile, we also integrate advanced prefetching and cache management techniques to further reduce the loading latency. Through comprehensive evaluations on various platforms, we demonstrate AdapMoE consistently outperforms existing techniques, reducing the average number of activated experts by 25% and achieving a 1.35x speedup without accuracy degradation.

### Post-Training Sparse Attention with Double Sparsity
**Authors**: Shuo Yang, Ying Sheng, Joseph E. Gonzalez, Ion Stoica, Lianmin Zheng

**Updated**: 2024-08-18T17:27:17Z

**Summary**: The inference process for large language models is slow and memory-intensive, with one of the most critical bottlenecks being excessive Key-Value (KV) cache accesses. This paper introduces "Double Sparsity," a novel post-training sparse attention technique designed to alleviate this bottleneck by reducing KV cache access. Double Sparsity combines token sparsity, which focuses on utilizing only the important tokens for computing self-attention, with channel sparsity, an approach that uses important feature channels for identifying important tokens. Our key insight is that the pattern of channel sparsity is relatively static, allowing us to use offline calibration to make it efficient at runtime, thereby enabling accurate and efficient identification of important tokens. Moreover, this method can be combined with offloading to achieve significant memory usage reduction. Experimental results demonstrate that Double Sparsity can achieve $\frac{1}{16}$ token and channel sparsity with minimal impact on accuracy across various tasks, including wiki-2 perplexity, key-value retrieval, and long context benchmarks with models including Llama-2-7B, Llama-2-70B, and Mixtral-8x7B. It brings up to a 14.1$\times$ acceleration in attention operations and a 1.9$\times$ improvement in end-to-end inference on GPUs. With offloading, it achieves a decoding speed acceleration of 16.3$\times$ compared to state-of-the-art solutions at a sequence length of 256K. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/andy-yang-1/DoubleSparse.

### CMD: A Cache-assisted GPU Memory Deduplication Architecture
**Authors**: Wei Zhao, Dan Feng, Wei Tong, Xueliang Wei, Bing Wu

**Updated**: 2024-08-18T13:54:46Z

**Summary**: Massive off-chip accesses in GPUs are the main performance bottleneck, and we divided these accesses into three types: (1) Write, (2) Data-Read, and (3) Read-Only. Besides, We find that many writes are duplicate, and the duplication can be inter-dup and intra-dup. While inter-dup means different memory blocks are identical, and intra-dup means all the 4B elements in a line are the same. In this work, we propose a cache-assisted GPU memory deduplication architecture named CMD to reduce the off-chip accesses via utilizing the data duplication in GPU applications. CMD includes three key design contributions which aim to reduce the three kinds of accesses: (1) A novel GPU memory deduplication architecture that removes the inter-dup and inter-dup lines. As for the inter-dup detection, we reduce the extra read requests caused by the traditional read-verify hash process. Besides, we design several techniques to manage duplicate blocks. (2) We propose a cache-assisted read scheme to reduce the reads to duplicate data. When an L2 cache miss wants to read the duplicate block, if the reference block has been fetched to L2 and it is clean, we can copy it to the L2 missed block without accessing off-chip DRAM. As for the reads to intra-dup data, CMD uses the on-chip metadata cache to get the data. (3) When a cache line is evicted, the clean sectors in the line are invalidated while the dirty sectors are written back. However, most read-only victims are re-referenced from DRAM more than twice. Therefore, we add a full-associate FIFO to accommodate the read-only (it is also clean) victims to reduce the re-reference counts. Experiments show that CMD can decrease the off-chip accesses by 31.01%, reduce the energy by 32.78% and improve performance by 37.79%. Besides, CMD can improve the performance of memory-intensive workloads by 50.18%.

### Ada-KV: Optimizing KV Cache Eviction by Adaptive Budget Allocation for   Efficient LLM Inference
**Authors**: Yuan Feng, Junlin Lv, Yukun Cao, Xike Xie, S. Kevin Zhou

**Updated**: 2024-08-16T08:46:33Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models have excelled in various fields but encounter challenges in memory and time efficiency due to the expanding Key-Value (KV) cache required for long-sequence inference. Recent efforts try to reduce KV cache size to a given memory budget by evicting vast non-critical cache elements during runtime, while preserving generation quality. Our revisiting of current eviction methods reveals that they fundamentally minimize an upper bound of the $L_1$ eviction loss between the pre- and post-eviction outputs of multi-head self-attention mechanisms. Moreover, our analysis indicates that the common practices of uniformly assigning budgets across attention heads harm their post-eviction generation quality. In light of these findings, we propose a simple yet effective adaptive budget allocation algorithm. This algorithm not only optimizes the theoretical loss upper bound but also reduces the $L_1$ eviction loss in practice by aligning with the varied characteristics across different heads. By integrating this algorithm into two state-of-the-art methods, we demonstrate the effectiveness of using adaptive budget allocation to optimize KV cache eviction. Extensive evaluations on 16 datasets and the Needle-in-a-Haystack test confirm significant performance improvements across various tasks.

### SelectLLM: Query-Aware Efficient Selection Algorithm for Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Kaushal Kumar Maurya, KV Aditya Srivatsa, Ekaterina Kochmar

**Updated**: 2024-08-16T06:11:21Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have gained increased popularity due to their remarkable success across various tasks, which has led to the active development of a large set of diverse LLMs. However, individual LLMs have limitations when applied to complex tasks because of such factors as training biases, model sizes, and the datasets used. A promising approach is to efficiently harness the diverse capabilities of LLMs to overcome these individual limitations. Towards this goal, we introduce a novel LLM selection algorithm called SelectLLM. This algorithm directs input queries to the most suitable subset of LLMs from a large pool, ensuring they collectively provide the correct response efficiently. SelectLLM uses a multi-label classifier, utilizing the classifier's predictions and confidence scores to design optimal policies for selecting an optimal, query-aware, and lightweight subset of LLMs. Our findings show that the proposed model outperforms individual LLMs and achieves competitive performance compared to similarly sized, computationally expensive top-performing LLM subsets. Specifically, with a similarly sized top-performing LLM subset, we achieve a significant reduction in latency on two standard reasoning benchmarks: 13% lower latency for GSM8K and 70% lower latency for MMLU. Additionally, we conduct comprehensive analyses and ablation studies, which validate the robustness of the proposed model.

### Symmetric Locality: Definition and Initial Results
**Authors**: Giordan Escalona, Dylan McKellips, Chen Ding

**Updated**: 2024-08-16T04:12:25Z

**Summary**: In this short paper, we characterize symmetric locality. In designing algorithms, compilers, and systems, data movement is a common bottleneck in high-performance computation, in which we improve cache and memory performance. We study a special type of data reuse in the form of repeated traversals, or re-traversals, which are based on the symmetric group. The cyclic and sawtooth traces are previously known results in symmetric locality, and in this work, we would like to generalize this result for any re-traversal. Then, we also provide an abstract framework for applications in compiler design and machine learning models to improve the memory performance of certain programs.

### ConfusedPilot: Confused Deputy Risks in RAG-based LLMs
**Authors**: Ayush RoyChowdhury, Mulong Luo, Prateek Sahu, Sarbartha Banerjee, Mohit Tiwari

**Updated**: 2024-08-15T05:24:19Z

**Summary**: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is a process where a large language model (LLM) retrieves useful information from a database and then generates the responses. It is becoming popular in enterprise settings for daily business operations. For example, Copilot for Microsoft 365 has accumulated millions of businesses. However, the security implications of adopting such RAG-based systems are unclear.   In this paper, we introduce ConfusedPilot, a class of security vulnerabilities of RAG systems that confuse Copilot and cause integrity and confidentiality violations in its responses. First, we investigate a vulnerability that embeds malicious text in the modified prompt in RAG, corrupting the responses generated by the LLM. Second, we demonstrate a vulnerability that leaks secret data, which leverages the caching mechanism during retrieval. Third, we investigate how both vulnerabilities can be exploited to propagate misinformation within the enterprise and ultimately impact its operations, such as sales and manufacturing. We also discuss the root cause of these attacks by investigating the architecture of a RAG-based system. This study highlights the security vulnerabilities in today's RAG-based systems and proposes design guidelines to secure future RAG-based systems.

### A Case for Enabling Delegation of 5G Core Decisions to the RAN
**Authors**: Lucas Vancina, Geoffrey Xie

**Updated**: 2024-08-14T23:42:46Z

**Summary**: Under conventional 5G system design, the authentication and continuous monitoring of user equipment (UE) demands a reliable backhaul connection between the radio access network (RAN) and the core network functions (AMF, AUSF, UDM, etc.). This is not a given, especially in disaster response and military operations. We propose that, in these scenarios, decisions made by core functions can be effectively delegated to the RAN by leveraging the RAN's computing resources and the micro-service programmability of the O-RAN system architecture. This paper presents several concrete designs of core-RAN decision delegation, including caching of core decisions and replicating some of the core decision logic. Each design has revealed interesting performance and security trade-offs that warrant further investigation.

### The Bicameral Cache: a split cache for vector architectures
**Authors**: Susana Rebolledo, Borja Perez, Jose Luis Bosque, Peter Hsu

**Updated**: 2024-08-14T09:18:02Z

**Summary**: The Bicameral Cache is a cache organization proposal for a vector architecture that segregates data according to their access type, distinguishing scalar from vector references. Its aim is to avoid both types of references from interfering in each other's data locality, with a special focus on prioritizing the performance on vector references. The proposed system incorporates an additional, non-polluting prefetching mechanism to help populate the long vector cache lines in advance to increase the hit rate by further exploiting the spatial locality on vector data. Its evaluation was conducted on the Cavatools simulator, comparing the performance to a standard conventional cache, over different typical vector benchmarks for several vector lengths. The results proved the proposed cache speeds up performance on stride-1 vector benchmarks, while hardly impacting non-stride-1's. In addition, the prefetching feature consistently provided an additional value.

### At Least Factor-of-Two Optimization for RWLE-Based Homomorphic   Encryption
**Authors**: Jonathan Ly

**Updated**: 2024-08-14T05:42:35Z

**Summary**: Many modern applications that deal with sensitive data, such as healthcare and government services, outsource computation to cloud platforms. In such untrusted environments, privacy is of vital importance. One solution to this problem is homomorphic encryption (HE), a family of cryptographic schemes that support certain algebraic operations on encrypted data without the need for decryption. However, despite major advancements, encryption in modern HE schemes still comes with a non-trivial computational overhead that can hamper data-intensive workloads. To resolve this, recent research has shown that leveraging caching techniques, such as Rache, can significantly enhance the performance of HE schemes while maintaining security. Rache unfortunately displays a key limitation in the time complexity of its caching procedure, which scales with the size of the plaintext space. Smuche is another caching scheme that simultaneously improves the scalability of the caching procedure and turns the encryption process into a constant-time operation, utilizing only a single scalar multiplication. Even still, more can be done. In this paper, we present an encryption method we call ``Zinc" which entirely forgoes the multiple caching process, replacing it with a single scalar addition, and then injecting randomness that takes constant time with respect to the plaintext space. This injection of randomness is similar to Smuche, and a great improvement from Rache, allowing Zinc to achieve efficiency without compromising security. We implement the scheme using Microsoft SEAL and compare its performance to vanilla CKKS.

### Cache-Aided MIMO Communications: DoF Analysis and Transmitter   Optimization
**Authors**: Mohammad NaseriTehrani, MohammadJavad Salehi, Antti Tölli

**Updated**: 2024-08-13T13:56:14Z

**Summary**: Cache-aided MIMO communications aims to jointly exploit both coded caching~(CC) and spatial multiplexing gains to enhance communication efficiency. In this paper, we first analyze the achievable degrees of freedom~(DoF) in a MIMO-CC system with CC gain \(t\), where a server with \(L\) transmit antennas communicates with \(K\) users, each equipped with \(G\) receive antennas. We demonstrate that the enhanced achievable DoF is \(\max_{\beta, \Omega} \Omega \beta\), where the number of users \(\Omega\) served in each transmission is fine-tuned to maximize DoF, and \(\beta \le \min\big(G, \nicefrac{L \binom{\Omega-1}{t}}{1 + (\Omega - t - 1)\binom{\Omega-1}{t}}\big)\) represents the number of parallel streams decoded by each user. Second, we introduce an effective transmit covariance matrix design aimed at maximizing the symmetric rate, solved iteratively via successive convex approximation. Third, we propose a new class of MIMO-CC schemes using a novel scheduling mechanism leveraging maximal multicasting opportunities to maximize delivery rates at given SNR levels while adhering to linear processing constraints. Lastly, we devise linear multicast beamforming strategies tailored for the flexible scheduling schemes in MIMO-CC systems and present an iterative solution for the efficient design of beamformers. Extensive numerical simulations are used to verify the results of the paper.

### Ownership in low-level intermediate representation
**Authors**: Siddharth Priya, Arie Gurfinkel

**Updated**: 2024-08-13T13:31:34Z

**Summary**: The concept of ownership in high level languages can aid both the programmer and the compiler to reason about the validity of memory operations. Previously, ownership semantics has been used successfully in high level automatic program verification to model a reference to data by a first order logic (FOL) representation of data instead of maintaining an address map. However, ownership semantics is not used in low level program verification. We have identified two challenges. First, ownership information is lost when a program is compiled to a low level intermediate representation (e.g., in LLVM IR). Second, pointers in low level programs point to bytes using an address map (e.g., in unsafe Rust) and thus the verification condition (VC) cannot always replace a pointer by its FOL abstraction. To remedy the situation, we develop ownership semantics for an LLVM like low level intermediate representation. Using these semantics, the VC can opportunistically model some memory accesses by a direct access of a pointer cache that stores byte representation of data. This scheme reduces instances where an address map must be maintained, especially for mostly safe programs that follow ownership semantics. For unsafe functionality, memory accesses are modelled by operations on an address map and we provide mechanisms to keep the address map and pointer cache in sync. We implement these semantics in SEABMC, a bit precise bounded model checker for LLVM. For evaluation, the source programs are assumed to be written in C. Since C does not have ownership built in, suitable macros are added that introduce and preserve ownership during translation to LLVM like IR for verification. This approach is evaluated on mature open source C code. For both handcrafted benchmarks and practical programs, we observe a speedup of $1.3x-5x$ during SMT solving.

### Keep the Cost Down: A Review on Methods to Optimize LLM' s KV-Cache   Consumption
**Authors**: Luohe Shi, Hongyi Zhang, Yao Yao, Zuchao Li, Hai Zhao

**Updated**: 2024-08-13T09:55:43Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs), epitomized by ChatGPT' s release in late 2022, have revolutionized various industries with their advanced language comprehension. However, their efficiency is challenged by the Transformer architecture' s struggle with handling long texts. KV-Cache has emerged as a pivotal solution to this issue, converting the time complexity of token generation from quadratic to linear, albeit with increased GPU memory overhead proportional to conversation length. With the development of the LLM community and academia, various KV-Cache compression methods have been proposed. In this review, we dissect the various properties of KV-Cache and elaborate on various methods currently used to optimize the KV-Cache space usage of LLMs. These methods span the pre-training phase, deployment phase, and inference phase, and we summarize the commonalities and differences among these methods. Additionally, we list some metrics for evaluating the long-text capabilities of large language models, from both efficiency and capability perspectives. Our review thus sheds light on the evolving landscape of LLM optimization, offering insights into future advancements in this dynamic field.

### Finch: Prompt-guided Key-Value Cache Compression
**Authors**: Giulio Corallo, Paolo Papotti

**Updated**: 2024-08-13T09:08:55Z

**Summary**: Recent large language model applications, such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation and chatbots, have led to an increased need to process longer input contexts. However, this requirement is hampered by inherent limitations. Architecturally, models are constrained by a context window defined during training. Additionally, processing extensive texts requires substantial GPU memory. We propose a novel approach, Finch, to compress the input context by leveraging the pre-trained model weights of the self-attention. Given a prompt and a long text, Finch iteratively identifies the most relevant Key (K) and Value (V) pairs over chunks of the text conditioned on the prompt. Only such pairs are stored in the KV cache, which, within the space constrained by the context window, ultimately contains a compressed version of the long text. Our proposal enables models to consume large inputs even with high compression (up to 93x) while preserving semantic integrity without the need for fine-tuning.

### Value-based Proactive Caching for Sensing Data in Internet of Vehicles
**Authors**: Yantong Wang, Ke Liu, Hui Ji, Jiande Sun

**Updated**: 2024-08-12T08:46:30Z

**Summary**: Sensing data (SD) plays an important role in safe-related applications for Internet of Vehicles. Proactively caching required sensing data (SD) is a pivotal strategy for alleviating network congestion and improving data accessibility. Despite merits, existing studies predominantly address SD caching within a single time slot, which may not be scalable to scenarios involving multi-slots. Furthermore, the oversight of service capacity at caching nodes could lead to significant queuing delays in SD reception. To tackle these limitations, we jointly consider the problem of anchoring caching placement and requests allocation for SD. A value model incorporating both temporal and spacial characteristics is first proposed to estimate the significance of different caching decisions. Subsequently, a stochastic integer nonlinear programming model is provided to optimize the long-term system performance, which is converted into a series of online optimization problem by leveraging the Lyapunov method and linearized via introducing auxiliary variables. To expedite the solution, we provide a binary quantum particle swarm optimization based algorithm with quadratic time complexity. Numerical investigations demonstrate the superiority of proposed algorithms compared with other schemes in terms of energy consumption, response latency, and cache-hit ratio.

**Authors**: Riccardo Tedeschi, Luca Valente, Gianmarco Ottavi, Enrico Zelioli, Nils Wistoff, Massimiliano Giacometti, Abdul Basit Sajjad, Luca Benini, Davide Rossi

**Updated**: 2024-08-12T07:47:28Z

**Summary**: Symmetric Multi-Processing (SMP) based on cache coherency is crucial for high-end embedded systems like automotive applications. RISC-V is gaining traction, and open-source hardware (OSH) platforms offer solutions to issues such as IP costs and vendor dependency. Existing multi-core cache-coherent RISC-V platforms are complex and not efficient for small embedded core clusters. We propose an open-source SystemVerilog implementation of a lightweight snoop-based cache-coherent cluster of Linux-capable CVA6 cores. Our design uses the MOESI protocol via the Arm's AMBA ACE protocol. Evaluated with Splash-3 benchmarks, our solution shows up to 32.87% faster performance in a dual-core setup and an average improvement of 15.8% over OpenPiton. Synthesized using GF 22nm FDSOI technology, the Cache Coherency Unit occupies only 1.6% of the system area.

### Correct Wrong Path
**Authors**: Bhargav Reddy Godala, Sankara Prasad Ramesh, Krishnam Tibrewala, Chrysanthos Pepi, Gino Chacon, Svilen Kanev, Gilles A. Pokam, Daniel A. Jiménez, Paul V. Gratz, David I. August

**Updated**: 2024-08-12T03:53:51Z

**Summary**: Modern OOO CPUs have very deep pipelines with large branch misprediction recovery penalties. Speculatively executed instructions on the wrong path can significantly change cache state, depending on speculation levels. Architects often employ trace-driven simulation models in the design exploration stage, which sacrifice precision for speed. Trace-driven simulators are orders of magnitude faster than execution-driven models, reducing the often hundreds of thousands of simulation hours needed to explore new micro-architectural ideas. Despite this strong benefit of trace-driven simulation, these often fail to adequately model the consequences of wrong path because obtaining them is nontrivial. Prior works consider either a positive or negative impact of wrong path but not both. Here, we examine wrong path execution in simulation results and design a set of infrastructure for enabling wrong-path execution in a trace driven simulator. Our analysis shows the wrong path affects structures on both the instruction and data sides extensively, resulting in performance variations ranging from $-3.05$\% to $20.9$\% when ignoring wrong path. To benefit the research community and enhance the accuracy of simulators, we opened our traces and tracing utility in the hopes that industry can provide wrong-path traces generated by their internal simulators, enabling academic simulation without exposing industry IP.

### Hierarchical Coded Caching with Low Subpacketization and Coding Delay
**Authors**: Rashid Ummer N. T., B. Sundar Rajan

**Updated**: 2024-08-11T16:35:10Z

**Summary**: Coded caching scheme originally proposed by Maddah-Ali and Niesen (MN) considered a broadcast network consisting of a single server connected to a set of users each having a cache memory. Motivated by practical scenarios, Karamchandani \textit{et al.} in [16] proposed a coded caching scheme for a two-layer hierarchical network consisting of a single server connected to multiple mirror sites and each mirror site connected to a distinct set of users, in which both mirror sites and users having cache memories. Low subpacketization level coded caching schemes are desirable for practical implementations. Placement delivery array (PDA) was proposed as a tool to design coded caching schemes with reduced subpacketization level by Yan \textit{et al.} in [4]. Schemes with reduced subpacketization levels are studied extensively in the literature for single-layer networks. Kong \textit{et al.} in [17] proposed a structure called hierarchical placement delivery arrays (HPDA), which characterizes a hierarchical coded caching system and also proposed a class of HPDAs that gives low subpacketization level schemes by using two PDAs. Low subpacketization level hierarchical schemes using combinatorial $t$-designs is proposed in [20]. Apart from that there is no other existing work that discusses the subpacketization problem in a hierarchical network. This paper proposes a class of HPDA construction that gives low subpacketization level hierarchical coded caching schemes, by first constructing a new class of PDAs. Compared with the existing schemes, in cases where the system parameters and subpacketization level are the same, the proposed hierarchical scheme has a better coding delay. Further, the new class of PDAs constructed either subsumes several known PDA constructions or achieves better transmission load for the same system parameters.

### Genie: Smart ROS-based Caching for Connected Autonomous Robots
**Authors**: Zexin Li, Soroush Bateni, Cong Liu

**Updated**: 2024-08-11T08:07:28Z

**Summary**: Despite the promising future of autonomous robots, several key issues currently remain that can lead to compromised performance and safety. One such issue is latency, where we find that even the latest embedded platforms from NVIDIA fail to execute intelligence tasks (e.g., object detection) of autonomous vehicles in a real-time fashion. One remedy to this problem is the promising paradigm of edge computing. Through collaboration with our industry partner, we identify key prohibitive limitations of the current edge mindset: (1) servers are not distributed enough and thus, are not close enough to vehicles, (2) current proposed edge solutions do not provide substantially better performance and extra information specific to autonomous vehicles to warrant their cost to the user, and (3) the state-of-the-art solutions are not compatible with popular frameworks used in autonomous systems, particularly the Robot Operating System (ROS).   To remedy these issues, we provide Genie, an encapsulation technique that can enable transparent caching in ROS in a non-intrusive way (i.e., without modifying the source code), can build the cache in a distributed manner (in contrast to traditional central caching methods), and can construct a collective three-dimensional object map to provide substantially better latency (even on low-power edge servers) and higher quality data to all vehicles in a certain locality. We fully implement our design on state-of-the-art industry-adopted embedded and edge platforms, using the prominent autonomous driving software Autoware, and find that Genie can enhance the latency of Autoware Vision Detector by 82% on average, enable object reusability 31% of the time on average and as much as 67% for the incoming requests, and boost the confidence in its object map considerably over time.

### Eigen Attention: Attention in Low-Rank Space for KV Cache Compression
**Authors**: Utkarsh Saxena, Gobinda Saha, Sakshi Choudhary, Kaushik Roy

**Updated**: 2024-08-10T22:47:12Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) represent a groundbreaking advancement in the domain of natural language processing due to their impressive reasoning abilities. Recently, there has been considerable interest in increasing the context lengths for these models to enhance their applicability to complex tasks. However, at long context lengths and large batch sizes, the key-value (KV) cache, which stores the attention keys and values, emerges as the new bottleneck in memory usage during inference. To address this, we propose Eigen Attention, which performs the attention operation in a low-rank space, thereby reducing the KV cache memory overhead. Our proposed approach is orthogonal to existing KV cache compression techniques and can be used synergistically with them. Through extensive experiments over OPT, MPT, and Llama model families, we demonstrate that Eigen Attention results in up to 40% reduction in KV cache sizes and up to 60% reduction in attention operation latency with minimal drop in performance.

### ICGMM: CXL-enabled Memory Expansion with Intelligent Caching Using   Gaussian Mixture Model
**Authors**: Hanqiu Chen, Yitu Wang, Luis Vitorio Cargnini, Mohammadreza Soltaniyeh, Dongyang Li, Gongjin Sun, Pradeep Subedi, Andrew Chang, Yiran Chen, Cong Hao

**Updated**: 2024-08-10T19:17:46Z

**Summary**: Compute Express Link (CXL) emerges as a solution for wide gap between computational speed and data communication rates among host and multiple devices. It fosters a unified and coherent memory space between host and CXL storage devices such as such as Solid-state drive (SSD) for memory expansion, with a corresponding DRAM implemented as the device cache. However, this introduces challenges such as substantial cache miss penalties, sub-optimal caching due to data access granularity mismatch between the DRAM "cache" and SSD "memory", and inefficient hardware cache management. To address these issues, we propose a novel solution, named ICGMM, which optimizes caching and eviction directly on hardware, employing a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)-based approach. We prototype our solution on an FPGA board, which demonstrates a noteworthy improvement compared to the classic Least Recently Used (LRU) cache strategy. We observe a decrease in the cache miss rate ranging from 0.32% to 6.14%, leading to a substantial 16.23% to 39.14% reduction in the average SSD access latency. Furthermore, when compared to the state-of-the-art Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based cache policies, our GMM algorithm on FPGA showcases an impressive latency reduction of over 10,000 times. Remarkably, this is achieved while demanding much fewer hardware resources.

### Time-resolved measurement of neutron energy isotropy in a   sheared-flow-stabilized Z pinch
**Authors**: R. A. Ryan, P. E. Tsai, A. R. Johansen, A. Youmans, D. P. Higginson, J. M. Mitrani, C. S. Adams, D. A. Sutherland, B. Levitt, U. Shumlak

**Updated**: 2024-08-09T16:48:01Z

**Summary**: Previous measurements of neutron energy using fast plastic scintillators while operating the Fusion Z Pinch Experiment (FuZE) constrained the energy of any yield-producing deuteron beams to less than $4.65 keV$. FuZE has since been operated at increasingly higher input power, resulting in increased plasma current and larger fusion neutron yields. A detailed experimental study of the neutron energy isotropy in these regimes applies more stringent limits to possible contributions from beam-target fusion. The FuZE device operated at $-25~kV$ charge voltage has resulted in average plasma currents of $370~kA$ and D-D fusion neutron yields of $4\times10^7$ neutrons per discharge. Measurements of the neutron energy isotropy under these operating conditions demonstrates the energy of deuteron beams is less than $7.4 \pm 5.6^\mathrm{(stat)} \pm 3.7^\mathrm{(syst)}~keV$. Characterization of the detector response has reduced the number of free parameters in the fit of the neutron energy distribution, improving the confidence in the forward-fit method. Gamma backgrounds have been measured and the impact of these contributions on the isotropy results have been studied. Additionally, a time dependent measurement of the isotropy has been resolved for the first time, indicating increases to possible deuteron beam energies at late times. This suggests the possible growth of $m$=0 instabilities at the end of the main radiation event but confirms that the majority of the neutron production exhibits isotropy consistent with thermonuclear origin.

### NACL: A General and Effective KV Cache Eviction Framework for LLMs at   Inference Time
**Authors**: Yilong Chen, Guoxia Wang, Junyuan Shang, Shiyao Cui, Zhenyu Zhang, Tingwen Liu, Shuohuan Wang, Yu Sun, Dianhai Yu, Hua Wu

**Updated**: 2024-08-08T01:20:13Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have ignited an innovative surge of AI applications, marking a new era of exciting possibilities equipped with extended context windows. However, hosting these models is cost-prohibitive mainly due to the extensive memory consumption of KV Cache involving long-context modeling. Despite several works proposing to evict unnecessary tokens from the KV Cache, most of them rely on the biased local statistics of accumulated attention scores and report performance using unconvincing metric like perplexity on inadequate short-text evaluation. In this paper, we propose NACL, a general framework for long-context KV cache eviction that achieves more optimal and efficient eviction in a single operation during the encoding phase. Due to NACL's efficiency, we combine more accurate attention score statistics in PROXY TOKENS EVICTION with the diversified random eviction strategy of RANDOM EVICTION, aiming to alleviate the issue of attention bias and enhance the robustness in maintaining pivotal tokens for long-context modeling tasks. Notably, our method significantly improves the performance on short- and long-text tasks by 80% and 76% respectively, reducing KV Cache by up to 50% with over 95% performance maintenance. The code is available at https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/Research/tree/master/NLP/ACL2024-NACL.

### A Comprehensive Survey on Edge Data Integrity Verification: Fundamentals   and Future Trends
**Authors**: Yao Zhao, Youyang Qu, Yong Xiang, Md Palash Uddin, Dezhong Peng, Longxiang Gao

**Updated**: 2024-08-07T23:48:59Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in edge computing~(EC) have pushed cloud-based data caching services to edge, however, such emerging edge storage comes with numerous challenging and unique security issues. One of them is the problem of edge data integrity verification (EDIV) which coordinates multiple participants (e.g., data owners and edge nodes) to inspect whether data cached on edge is authentic. To date, various solutions have been proposed to address the EDIV problem, while there is no systematic review. Thus, we offer a comprehensive survey for the first time, aiming to show current research status, open problems, and potentially promising insights for readers to further investigate this under-explored field. Specifically, we begin by stating the significance of the EDIV problem, the integrity verification difference between data cached on cloud and edge, and three typical system models with corresponding inspection processes. To thoroughly assess prior research efforts, we synthesize a universal criteria framework that an effective verification approach should satisfy. On top of it, a schematic development timeline is developed to reveal the research advance on EDIV in a sequential manner, followed by a detailed review of the existing EDIV solutions. Finally, we highlight intriguing research challenges and possible directions for future work, along with a discussion on how forthcoming technology, e.g., machine learning and context-aware security, can augment security in EC. Given our findings, some major observations are: there is a noticeable trend to equip EDIV solutions with various functions and diversify study scenarios; completing EDIV within two types of participants (i.e., data owner and edge nodes) is garnering escalating interest among researchers; although the majority of existing methods rely on cryptography, emerging technology is being explored to handle the EDIV problem.

### Zero-Delay QKV Compression for Mitigating KV Cache and Network   Bottlenecks in LLM Inference
**Authors**: Zeyu Zhang, Haiying Shen

**Updated**: 2024-08-07T22:10:26Z

**Summary**: In large-language models, memory constraints in the key-value cache (KVC) pose a challenge during inference, especially with long prompts. In this work, we observed that compressing KV values is more effective than compressing the model regarding accuracy and job completion time (JCT). However, quantizing KV values and dropping less-important tokens incur significant runtime computational time overhead, delaying JCT. These methods also cannot reduce computation time or high network communication time overhead in sequence-parallelism (SP) frameworks for long prompts. To tackle these issues, based on our insightful observations from experimental analysis, we propose ZeroC, a Zero-delay QKV Compression system that eliminates time overhead and even reduces computation and communication time of the model operations. ZeroC innovatively embeds compression and decompression operations within model operations and adaptively determines compression ratios at a hybrid layer-token level. Further, it enables a communication-efficient SP inference framework. Trace-driven experiments demonstrate that ZeroC achieves up to 80% lower average JCT, 35% lower average perplexity, and 2.8x higher throughput with the same latency compared to state-of-the-art compression methods. ZeroC also reduces the average JCT of current LLM serving systems by up to 91% with the constraint of 0.1 perplexity increase. We open-sourced the code.

### Temporal Feature Matters: A Framework for Diffusion Model Quantization
**Authors**: Yushi Huang, Ruihao Gong, Xianglong Liu, Jing Liu, Yuhang Li, Jiwen Lu, Dacheng Tao

**Updated**: 2024-08-07T20:43:10Z

**Summary**: The Diffusion models, widely used for image generation, face significant challenges related to their broad applicability due to prolonged inference times and high memory demands. Efficient Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is crucial to address these issues. However, unlike traditional models, diffusion models critically rely on the time-step for the multi-round denoising. Typically, each time-step is encoded into a hypersensitive temporal feature by several modules. Despite this, existing PTQ methods do not optimize these modules individually. Instead, they employ unsuitable reconstruction objectives and complex calibration methods, leading to significant disturbances in the temporal feature and denoising trajectory, as well as reduced compression efficiency. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel quantization framework that includes three strategies: 1) TIB-based Maintenance: Based on our innovative Temporal Information Block (TIB) definition, Temporal Information-aware Reconstruction (TIAR) and Finite Set Calibration (FSC) are developed to efficiently align original temporal features. 2) Cache-based Maintenance: Instead of indirect and complex optimization for the related modules, pre-computing and caching quantized counterparts of temporal features are developed to minimize errors. 3) Disturbance-aware Selection: Employ temporal feature errors to guide a fine-grained selection between the two maintenance strategies for further disturbance reduction. This framework preserves most of the temporal information and ensures high-quality end-to-end generation. Extensive testing on various datasets, diffusion models and hardware confirms our superior performance and acceleration..

### mucAI at WojoodNER 2024: Arabic Named Entity Recognition with Nearest   Neighbor Search
**Authors**: Ahmed Abdou, Tasneem Mohsen

**Updated**: 2024-08-07T09:34:55Z

**Summary**: Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a task in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that aims to identify and classify entities in text into predefined categories. However, when applied to Arabic data, NER encounters unique challenges stemming from the language's rich morphological inflections, absence of capitalization cues, and spelling variants, where a single word can comprise multiple morphemes. In this paper, we introduce Arabic KNN-NER, our submission to the Wojood NER Shared Task 2024 (ArabicNLP 2024). We have participated in the shared sub-task 1 Flat NER. In this shared sub-task, we tackle fine-grained flat-entity recognition for Arabic text, where we identify a single main entity and possibly zero or multiple sub-entities for each word. Arabic KNN-NER augments the probability distribution of a fine-tuned model with another label probability distribution derived from performing a KNN search over the cached training data. Our submission achieved 91% on the test set on the WojoodFine dataset, placing Arabic KNN-NER on top of the leaderboard for the shared task.

### LLMs as Probabilistic Minimally Adequate Teachers for DFA Learning
**Authors**: Lekai Chen, Ashutosh Trivedi, Alvaro Velasquez

**Updated**: 2024-08-06T07:12:09Z

**Summary**: The emergence of intelligence in large language models (LLMs) has inspired investigations into their integration into automata learning. This paper introduces the probabilistic Minimally Adequate Teacher (pMAT) formulation, which leverages a probabilistic oracle that could give persistent errors randomly during answering the membership queries for deterministic finite automata (DFA) learning. Given the tendency of LLMs to produce hallucinatory content, we have developed techniques to improve answer accuracy and ensure the correctness of the learned automata. We propose the $\mathtt{Discrimination}$ prompt as well as the $\mathtt{Verification}$ prompt and explore their advantages over common prompts. Additionally, we compare DFA learning performance between the TTT algorithm and common active learning algorithms. To address the exponential number of persistent errors, we implement a dynamic query cache refinement algorithm that identifies and corrects conflicting queries by combining the active and passive learning algorithms. The empirical results demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of our approach, providing a theoretical foundation for automata learning with LLMs in the loop.

### NVPC: A Transparent NVM Page Cache
**Authors**: Guoyu Wang, Xilong Che, Haoyang Wei, Shuo Chen, Puyi He, Juncheng Hu

**Updated**: 2024-08-06T02:51:22Z

**Summary**: Towards a compatible utilization of NVM, NVM-specialized kernel file systems and NVM-based disk file system accelerators have been proposed. However, these studies only focus on one or several characteristics of NVM, while failing to exploit its best practice by putting NVM in the proper position of the whole storage stack. In this paper, we present NVPC, a transparent acceleration to existing kernel file systems with an NVM-enhanced page cache. The acceleration lies in two aspects, respectively matching the desperate needs of existing disk file systems: sync writes and cache-missed operations. Besides, the fast DRAM page cache is preserved for cache-hit operations. For sync writes, a high-performance log-based sync absorbing area is provided to redirect data destination from the slow disk to the fast NVM. Meanwhile, the byte-addressable feature of NVM is used to prevent write amplification. For cache-missed operations, NVPC makes use of the idle space on NVM to extend the DRAM page cache, so that more and larger workloads can fit into the cache. NVPC is entirely implemented as a page cache, thus can provide efficient speed-up to disk file systems with full transparency to users and full compatibility to lower file systems.   In Filebench macro-benchmarks, NVPC achieves at most 3.55x, 2.84x, and 2.64x faster than NOVA, Ext-4, and SPFS. In RocksDB workloads with working set larger than DRAM, NVPC achieves 1.12x, 2.59x, and 2.11x faster than NOVA, Ext-4, and SPFS. Meanwhile, NVPC gains positive revenue from NOVA, Ext-4, and SPFS in 62.5% of the tested cases in our read/write/sync mixed evaluation, demonstrating that NVPC is more balanced and adaptive to complex real-world workloads. Experimental results also show that NVPC is the only method that accelerates Ext-4 in particular cases for up to 15.19x, with no slow-down to any other use cases.

### Electron-beam-induced modification of gold microparticles in an SEM
**Authors**: Kristina Weinel, Marc Benjamin Hahn, Axel Lubk, Wen Feng, Ignacio Gonzalez Martinez, Bernd Büchner, Leonardo Agudo Jácome

**Updated**: 2024-08-05T12:09:50Z

**Summary**: Electron-beam-induced conversion of materials in a transmission electron microscope uses the high power density of a localized electron beam of acceleration voltages above 100 kV as an energy source to transform matter at the sub-micron scale. Here, the e-beam-induced transformation of precursor microparticles employing a low-energy e-beam with an acceleration voltage of 30 kV in a scanning electron microscope is developed to increase the versatility and efficiency of the technique. Under these conditions, the technique can be classified between e-beam lithography, where the e-beam is used to mill holes in or grow some different material onto a substrate, and e-beam welding, where matter can be welded together when overcoming the melting phase. Modifying gold microparticles on an amorphous SiOx substrate reveals the dominant role of inelastic electron-matter interaction and subsequent localized heating for the observed melting and vaporization of the precursor microparticles under the electron beam. Monte-Carlo scattering simulations and thermodynamic modeling further support the findings.

### SLO-aware GPU Frequency Scaling for Energy Efficient LLM Inference   Serving
**Authors**: Andreas Kosmas Kakolyris, Dimosthenis Masouros, Petros Vavaroutsos, Sotirios Xydis, Dimitrios Soudris

**Updated**: 2024-08-05T09:07:06Z

**Summary**: As Large Language Models (LLMs) gain traction, their reliance on power-hungry GPUs places ever-increasing energy demands, raising environmental and monetary concerns. Inference dominates LLM workloads, presenting a critical challenge for providers: minimizing energy costs under Service-Level Objectives (SLOs) that ensure optimal user experience. In this paper, we present \textit{throttLL'eM}, a framework that reduces energy consumption while meeting SLOs through the use of instance and GPU frequency scaling. \textit{throttLL'eM} features mechanisms that project future KV cache usage and batch size. Leveraging a Machine-Learning (ML) model that receives these projections as inputs, \textit{throttLL'eM} manages performance at the iteration level to satisfy SLOs with reduced frequencies and instance sizes. We show that the proposed ML model achieves $R^2$ scores greater than 0.97 and miss-predicts performance by less than 1 iteration per second on average. Experimental results on LLM inference traces show that \textit{throttLL'eM} achieves up to 43.8\% lower energy consumption and an energy efficiency improvement of at least $1.71\times$ under SLOs, when compared to NVIDIA's Triton server.

### TriForce: Lossless Acceleration of Long Sequence Generation with   Hierarchical Speculative Decoding
**Authors**: Hanshi Sun, Zhuoming Chen, Xinyu Yang, Yuandong Tian, Beidi Chen

**Updated**: 2024-08-04T00:58:04Z

**Summary**: With large language models (LLMs) widely deployed in long content generation recently, there has emerged an increasing demand for efficient long-sequence inference support. However, key-value (KV) cache, which is stored to avoid re-computation, has emerged as a critical bottleneck by growing linearly in size with the sequence length. Due to the auto-regressive nature of LLMs, the entire KV cache will be loaded for every generated token, resulting in low utilization of computational cores and high latency. While various compression methods for KV cache have been proposed to alleviate this issue, they suffer from degradation in generation quality. We introduce TriForce, a hierarchical speculative decoding system that is scalable for long sequence generation. This approach leverages the original model weights and dynamic sparse KV cache via retrieval as a draft model, which serves as an intermediate layer in the hierarchy and is further speculated by a smaller model to reduce its drafting latency. TriForce not only facilitates impressive speedups for Llama2-7B-128K, achieving up to 2.31$\times$ on an A100 GPU but also showcases scalability in handling even longer contexts. For the offloading setting on two RTX 4090 GPUs, TriForce achieves 0.108s/token$\unicode{x2014}$only half as slow as the auto-regressive baseline on an A100, which attains 7.78$\times$ on our optimized offloading system. Additionally, TriForce performs 4.86$\times$ than DeepSpeed-Zero-Inference on a single RTX 4090 GPU. TriForce's robustness is highlighted by its consistently outstanding performance across various temperatures. The code is available at https://github.com/Infini-AI-Lab/TriForce.

### Cross-layer Attention Sharing for Large Language Models
**Authors**: Yongyu Mu, Yuzhang Wu, Yuchun Fan, Chenglong Wang, Hengyu Li, Qiaozhi He, Murun Yang, Tong Xiao, Jingbo Zhu

**Updated**: 2024-08-04T00:38:34Z

**Summary**: As large language models (LLMs) evolve, the increase in model depth and parameter number leads to substantial redundancy. To enhance the efficiency of the attention mechanism, previous works primarily compress the KV cache or group attention heads, while largely overlooking redundancy between layers. Our comprehensive analyses across various LLMs show that highly similar attention patterns persist within most layers. It's intuitive to save the computation by sharing attention weights across layers. However, further analysis reveals two challenges: (1) Directly sharing the weight matrix without carefully rearranging the attention heads proves to be ineffective; (2) Shallow layers are vulnerable to small deviations in attention weights. Driven by these insights, we introduce LiSA, a lightweight substitute for self-attention in well-trained LLMs. LiSA employs tiny feed-forward networks to align attention heads between adjacent layers and low-rank matrices to approximate differences in layer-wise attention weights. Evaluations encompassing 13 typical benchmarks demonstrate that LiSA maintains high response quality in terms of accuracy and perplexity while reducing redundant attention calculations within 53-84% of the total layers. Our implementations of LiSA achieve a 6X compression of Q and K, with maximum throughput improvements of 19.5% for LLaMA3-8B and 32.3% for LLaMA2-7B.

**Authors**: Yanxian Huang, Wanjun Zhong, Ensheng Shi, Min Yang, Jiachi Chen, Hui Li, Yuchi Ma, Qianxiang Wang, Zibin Zheng, Yanlin Wang

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T17:55:58Z

**Summary**: In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success and have been widely used in various downstream tasks, especially in the tasks of the software engineering (SE) field. We find that many studies combining LLMs with SE have employed the concept of agents either explicitly or implicitly. However, there is a lack of an in-depth survey to sort out the development context of existing works, analyze how existing works combine the LLM-based agent technologies to optimize various tasks, and clarify the framework of LLM-based agents in SE. In this paper, we conduct the first survey of the studies on combining LLM-based agents with SE and present a framework of LLM-based agents in SE which includes three key modules: perception, memory, and action. We also summarize the current challenges in combining the two fields and propose future opportunities in response to existing challenges. We maintain a GitHub repository of the related papers at: https://github.com/DeepSoftwareAnalytics/Awesome-Agent4SE.

### Learning Theory Informed Priors for Bayesian Inference: A Case Study   with Early Dark Energy
**Authors**: Michael W. Toomey, Mikhail M. Ivanov, Evan McDonough

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T17:55:48Z

**Summary**: Cosmological models are often motivated and formulated in the language of particle physics, using quantities such as the axion decay constant, but tested against data using ostensibly physical quantities, such as energy density ratios, assuming uniform priors on the latter. This approach neglects priors on the model from fundamental theory, including from particle physics and string theory, such as the preference for sub-Planckian axion decay constants. We introduce a novel approach to learning theory-informed priors for Bayesian inference using normalizing flows (NF), a flexible generative machine learning technique that generates priors on model parameters when analytic expressions are unavailable or difficult to compute. As a test case, we focus on early dark energy (EDE), a model designed to address the Hubble tension. Rather than using uniform priors on the $\textit{phenomenological}$ EDE parameters $f_{\rm EDE}$ and $z_c$, we train a NF on EDE cosmologies informed by theory expectations for axion masses and decay constants. Our method recovers known constraints in this representation while being $\sim 300,000$ times more efficient in terms of total CPU compute time. Applying our NF to $\textit{Planck}$ and BOSS data, we obtain the first theory-informed constraints on EDE, finding $f_{\rm EDE} \lesssim 0.02$ at $95\%$ confidence with an $H_0$ consistent with $\textit{Planck}$, but in $\sim 6\sigma$ tension with SH0ES. This yields the strongest constraints on EDE to date, additionally challenging its role in resolving the Hubble tension.

### An Efficient and Streaming Audio Visual Active Speaker Detection System
**Authors**: Arnav Kundu, Yanzi Jin, Mohammad Sekhavat, Max Horton, Danny Tormoen, Devang Naik

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T17:45:53Z

**Summary**: This paper delves into the challenging task of Active Speaker Detection (ASD), where the system needs to determine in real-time whether a person is speaking or not in a series of video frames. While previous works have made significant strides in improving network architectures and learning effective representations for ASD, a critical gap exists in the exploration of real-time system deployment. Existing models often suffer from high latency and memory usage, rendering them impractical for immediate applications. To bridge this gap, we present two scenarios that address the key challenges posed by real-time constraints. First, we introduce a method to limit the number of future context frames utilized by the ASD model. By doing so, we alleviate the need for processing the entire sequence of future frames before a decision is made, significantly reducing latency. Second, we propose a more stringent constraint that limits the total number of past frames the model can access during inference. This tackles the persistent memory issues associated with running streaming ASD systems. Beyond these theoretical frameworks, we conduct extensive experiments to validate our approach. Our results demonstrate that constrained transformer models can achieve performance comparable to or even better than state-of-the-art recurrent models, such as uni-directional GRUs, with a significantly reduced number of context frames. Moreover, we shed light on the temporal memory requirements of ASD systems, revealing that larger past context has a more profound impact on accuracy than future context. When profiling on a CPU we find that our efficient architecture is memory bound by the amount of past context it can use and that the compute cost is negligible as compared to the memory cost.

### AI-LieDar: Examine the Trade-off Between Utility and Truthfulness in LLM   Agents
**Authors**: Zhe Su, Xuhui Zhou, Sanketh Rangreji, Anubha Kabra, Julia Mendelsohn, Faeze Brahman, Maarten Sap

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T17:41:12Z

**Summary**: To be safely and successfully deployed, LLMs must simultaneously satisfy truthfulness and utility goals. Yet, often these two goals compete (e.g., an AI agent assisting a used car salesman selling a car with flaws), partly due to ambiguous or misleading user instructions. We propose AI-LieDar, a framework to study how LLM-based agents navigate scenarios with utility-truthfulness conflicts in a multi-turn interactive setting. We design a set of realistic scenarios where language agents are instructed to achieve goals that are in conflict with being truthful during a multi-turn conversation with simulated human agents. To evaluate the truthfulness at large scale, we develop a truthfulness detector inspired by psychological literature to assess the agents' responses. Our experiment demonstrates that all models are truthful less than 50% of the time, although truthfulness and goal achievement (utility) rates vary across models. We further test the steerability of LLMs towards truthfulness, finding that models follow malicious instructions to deceive, and even truth-steered models can still lie. These findings reveal the complex nature of truthfulness in LLMs and underscore the importance of further research to ensure the safe and reliable deployment of LLMs and AI agents.

### Contri(e)ve: Context + Retrieve for Scholarly Question Answering
**Authors**: Kanchan Shivashankar, Nadine Steinmetz

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T17:38:47Z

**Summary**: Scholarly communication is a rapid growing field containing a wealth of knowledge. However, due to its unstructured and document format, it is challenging to extract useful information from them through conventional document retrieval methods. Scholarly knowledge graphs solve this problem, by representing the documents in a semantic network, providing, hidden insights, summaries and ease of accessibility through queries. Naturally, question answering for scholarly graphs expands the accessibility to a wider audience. But some of the knowledge in this domain is still presented as unstructured text, thus requiring a hybrid solution for question answering systems. In this paper, we present a two step solution using open source Large Language Model(LLM): Llama3.1 for Scholarly-QALD dataset. Firstly, we extract the context pertaining to the question from different structured and unstructured data sources: DBLP, SemOpenAlex knowledge graphs and Wikipedia text. Secondly, we implement prompt engineering to improve the information retrieval performance of the LLM. Our approach achieved an F1 score of 40% and also observed some anomalous responses from the LLM, that are discussed in the final part of the paper.

### SGFormer: Single-Layer Graph Transformers with Approximation-Free Linear   Complexity
**Authors**: Qitian Wu, Kai Yang, Hengrui Zhang, David Wipf, Junchi Yan

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T17:37:34Z

**Summary**: Learning representations on large graphs is a long-standing challenge due to the inter-dependence nature. Transformers recently have shown promising performance on small graphs thanks to its global attention for capturing all-pair interactions beyond observed structures. Existing approaches tend to inherit the spirit of Transformers in language and vision tasks, and embrace complicated architectures by stacking deep attention-based propagation layers. In this paper, we attempt to evaluate the necessity of adopting multi-layer attentions in Transformers on graphs, which considerably restricts the efficiency. Specifically, we analyze a generic hybrid propagation layer, comprised of all-pair attention and graph-based propagation, and show that multi-layer propagation can be reduced to one-layer propagation, with the same capability for representation learning. It suggests a new technical path for building powerful and efficient Transformers on graphs, particularly through simplifying model architectures without sacrificing expressiveness. As exemplified by this work, we propose a Simplified Single-layer Graph Transformers (SGFormer), whose main component is a single-layer global attention that scales linearly w.r.t. graph sizes and requires none of any approximation for accommodating all-pair interactions. Empirically, SGFormer successfully scales to the web-scale graph ogbn-papers100M, yielding orders-of-magnitude inference acceleration over peer Transformers on medium-sized graphs, and demonstrates competitiveness with limited labeled data.

### Bridging multiple worlds: multi-marginal optimal transport for causal   partial-identification problem
**Authors**: Zijun Gao, Shu Ge, Jian Qian

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T17:15:33Z

**Summary**: Under the prevalent potential outcome model in causal inference, each unit is associated with multiple potential outcomes but at most one of which is observed, leading to many causal quantities being only partially identified. The inherent missing data issue echoes the multi-marginal optimal transport (MOT) problem, where marginal distributions are known, but how the marginals couple to form the joint distribution is unavailable. In this paper, we cast the causal partial identification problem in the framework of MOT with $K$ margins and $d$-dimensional outcomes and obtain the exact partial identified set. In order to estimate the partial identified set via MOT, statistically, we establish a convergence rate of the plug-in MOT estimator for the $\ell_2$ cost function stemming from the variance minimization problem and prove it is minimax optimal for arbitrary $K$ and $d \le 4$. We also extend the convergence result to general quadratic objective functions. Numerically, we demonstrate the efficacy of our method over synthetic datasets and several real-world datasets where our proposal consistently outperforms the baseline by a significant margin (over 70%). In addition, we provide efficient off-the-shelf implementations of MOT with general objective functions.

### A Distance Covariance-based Estimator
**Authors**: Emmanuel Selorm Tsyawo, Abdul-Nasah Soale

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T17:15:01Z

**Summary**: This paper introduces an estimator that considerably weakens the conventional relevance condition of instrumental variable (IV) methods, allowing for instruments that are weakly correlated, uncorrelated, or even mean-independent but not independent of endogenous covariates. Under the relevance condition, the estimator achieves consistent estimation and reliable inference without requiring instrument excludability, and it remains robust even when the first moment of the disturbance term does not exist. In contrast to conventional IV methods, it maximises the set of feasible instruments in any empirical setting. Under a weak conditional median independence condition on pairwise differences in disturbances and mild regularity assumptions, identification holds, and the estimator is consistent and asymptotically normal.

### Clean Label Attacks against SLU Systems
**Authors**: Henry Li Xinyuan, Sonal Joshi, Thomas Thebaud, Jesus Villalba, Najim Dehak, Sanjeev Khudanpur

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T16:58:06Z

**Summary**: Poisoning backdoor attacks involve an adversary manipulating the training data to induce certain behaviors in the victim model by inserting a trigger in the signal at inference time. We adapted clean label backdoor (CLBD)-data poisoning attacks, which do not modify the training labels, on state-of-the-art speech recognition models that support/perform a Spoken Language Understanding task, achieving 99.8% attack success rate by poisoning 10% of the training data. We analyzed how varying the signal-strength of the poison, percent of samples poisoned, and choice of trigger impact the attack. We also found that CLBD attacks are most successful when applied to training samples that are inherently hard for a proxy model. Using this strategy, we achieved an attack success rate of 99.3% by poisoning a meager 1.5% of the training data. Finally, we applied two previously developed defenses against gradient-based attacks, and found that they attain mixed success against poisoning.

### Safeguarding Decentralized Social Media: LLM Agents for Automating   Community Rule Compliance
**Authors**: Lucio La Cava, Andrea Tagarelli

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T16:29:25Z

**Summary**: Ensuring content compliance with community guidelines is crucial for maintaining healthy online social environments. However, traditional human-based compliance checking struggles with scaling due to the increasing volume of user-generated content and a limited number of moderators. Recent advancements in Natural Language Understanding demonstrated by Large Language Models unlock new opportunities for automated content compliance verification. This work evaluates six AI-agents built on Open-LLMs for automated rule compliance checking in Decentralized Social Networks, a challenging environment due to heterogeneous community scopes and rules. Analyzing over 50,000 posts from hundreds of Mastodon servers, we find that AI-agents effectively detect non-compliant content, grasp linguistic subtleties, and adapt to diverse community contexts. Most agents also show high inter-rater reliability and consistency in score justification and suggestions for compliance. Human-based evaluation with domain experts confirmed the agents' reliability and usefulness, rendering them promising tools for semi-automated or human-in-the-loop content moderation systems.

**Authors**: Jonas R. Naujoks, Aleksander Krasowski, Moritz Weckbecker, Thomas Wiegand, Sebastian Lapuschkin, Wojciech Samek, René P. Klausen

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T16:23:17Z

**Summary**: Recently, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have emerged as a flexible and promising application of deep learning to partial differential equations in the physical sciences. While offering strong performance and competitive inference speeds on forward and inverse problems, their black-box nature limits interpretability, particularly regarding alignment with expected physical behavior. In the present work, we explore the application of influence functions (IFs) to validate and debug PINNs post-hoc. Specifically, we apply variations of IF-based indicators to gauge the influence of different types of collocation points on the prediction of PINNs applied to a 2D Navier-Stokes fluid flow problem. Our results demonstrate how IFs can be adapted to PINNs to reveal the potential for further studies.

### Emerging Reliance Behaviors in Human-AI Text Generation: Hallucinations,   Data Quality Assessment, and Cognitive Forcing Functions
**Authors**: Zahra Ashktorab, Qian Pan, Werner Geyer, Michael Desmond, Marina Danilevsky, James M. Johnson, Casey Dugan, Michelle Bachman

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T15:55:59Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we investigate the impact of hallucinations and cognitive forcing functions in human-AI collaborative text generation tasks, focusing on the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist in generating high-quality conversational data. LLMs require data for fine-tuning, a crucial step in enhancing their performance. In the context of conversational customer support, the data takes the form of a conversation between a human customer and an agent and can be generated with an AI assistant. In our inquiry, involving 11 users who each completed 8 tasks, resulting in a total of 88 tasks, we found that the presence of hallucinations negatively impacts the quality of data. We also find that, although the cognitive forcing function does not always mitigate the detrimental effects of hallucinations on data quality, the presence of cognitive forcing functions and hallucinations together impacts data quality and influences how users leverage the AI responses presented to them. Our analysis of user behavior reveals distinct patterns of reliance on AI-generated responses, highlighting the importance of managing hallucinations in AI-generated content within conversational AI contexts.

### Proactive Recommendation in Social Networks: Steering User Interest via   Neighbor Influence
**Authors**: Hang Pan, Shuxian Bi, Wenjie Wang, Haoxuan Li, Peng Wu, Fuli Feng, Xiangnan He

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T15:53:40Z

**Summary**: Recommending items solely catering to users' historical interests narrows users' horizons. Recent works have considered steering target users beyond their historical interests by directly adjusting items exposed to them. However, the recommended items for direct steering might not align perfectly with users' interests evolution, detrimentally affecting target users' experience. To avoid this issue, we propose a new task named Proactive Recommendation in Social Networks (PRSN) that indirectly steers users' interest by utilizing the influence of social neighbors, i.e., indirect steering by adjusting the exposure of a target item to target users' neighbors. The key to PRSN lies in answering an interventional question: what would a target user's feedback be on a target item if the item is exposed to the user's different neighbors? To answer this question, we resort to causal inference and formalize PRSN as: (1) estimating the potential feedback of a user on an item, under the network interference by the item's exposure to the user's neighbors; and (2) adjusting the exposure of a target item to target users' neighbors to trade off steering performance and the damage to the neighbors' experience. To this end, we propose a Neighbor Interference Recommendation (NIRec) framework with two key modules: (1)an interference representation-based estimation module for modeling potential feedback; and (2) a post-learning-based optimization module for optimizing a target item's exposure to trade off steering performance and the neighbors' experience by greedy search. We conduct extensive semi-simulation experiments based on three real-world datasets, validating the steering effectiveness of NIRec.

### LLM-based Weak Supervision Framework for Query Intent Classification in   Video Search
**Authors**: Farnoosh Javadi, Phanideep Gampa, Alyssa Woo, Xingxing Geng, Hang Zhang, Jose Sepulveda, Belhassen Bayar, Fei Wang

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T15:47:50Z

**Summary**: Streaming services have reshaped how we discover and engage with digital entertainment. Despite these advancements, effectively understanding the wide spectrum of user search queries continues to pose a significant challenge. An accurate query understanding system that can handle a variety of entities that represent different user intents is essential for delivering an enhanced user experience. We can build such a system by training a natural language understanding (NLU) model; however, obtaining high-quality labeled training data in this specialized domain is a substantial obstacle. Manual annotation is costly and impractical for capturing users' vast vocabulary variations. To address this, we introduce a novel approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) through weak supervision to automatically annotate a vast collection of user search queries. Using prompt engineering and a diverse set of LLM personas, we generate training data that matches human annotator expectations. By incorporating domain knowledge via Chain of Thought and In-Context Learning, our approach leverages the labeled data to train low-latency models optimized for real-time inference. Extensive evaluations demonstrated that our approach outperformed the baseline with an average relative gain of 113% in recall. Furthermore, our novel prompt engineering framework yields higher quality LLM-generated data to be used for weak supervision; we observed 47.60% improvement over baseline in agreement rate between LLM predictions and human annotations with respect to F1 score, weighted according to the distribution of occurrences of the search queries. Our persona selection routing mechanism further adds an additional 3.67% increase in weighted F1 score on top of our novel prompt engineering framework.

### Self-Organized State-Space Models with Artificial Dynamics
**Authors**: Yuan Chen, Mathieu Gerber, Christophe Andrieu, Randal Douc

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T15:45:40Z

**Summary**: In this paper we consider a state-space model (SSM) parametrized by some parameter $\theta$, and our aim is to perform joint parameter and state inference. A simple idea to perform this task, which almost dates back to the origin of the Kalman filter, is to replace the static parameter $\theta$ by a Markov chain $(\theta_t)_{t\geq 0}$ on the parameter space and then to apply a standard filtering algorithm to the extended, or self-organized SSM. However, the practical implementation of this idea in a theoretically justified way has remained an open problem. In this paper we fill this gap by introducing various possible constructions of the Markov chain $(\theta_t)_{t\geq 0}$ that ensure the validity of the self-organized SSM (SO-SSM) for joint parameter and state inference. Notably, we show that theoretically valid SO-SSMs can be defined even if $\|\mathrm{Var}(\theta_{t}|\theta_{t-1})\|$ converges to 0 slowly as $t\rightarrow\infty$. This result is important since, as illustrated in our numerical experiments, such models can be efficiently approximated using standard particle filter algorithms. While the idea studied in this work was first introduced for online inference in SSMs, it has also been proved to be useful for computing the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) of a given SSM, since iterated filtering algorithms can be seen as particle filters applied to SO-SSMs for which the target parameter value is the MLE of interest. Based on this observation, we also derive constructions of $(\theta_t)_{t\geq 0}$ and theoretical results tailored to these specific applications of SO-SSMs, and as a result, we introduce new iterated filtering algorithms. From a practical point of view, the algorithms introduced in this work have the merit of being simple to implement and only requiring minimal tuning to perform well.

### CoverUp: Coverage-Guided LLM-Based Test Generation
**Authors**: Juan Altmayer Pizzorno, Emery D. Berger

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T15:45:10Z

**Summary**: Testing is an essential part of software development. Test generation tools attempt to automate the otherwise labor-intensive task of test creation, but generating high-coverage tests remains a challenge. This paper proposes CoverUp, a novel approach to driving the generation of high-coverage Python regression tests. CoverUp iteratively improves test coverage, interleaving coverage analysis with dialogs with the LLM that steer it to refine tests so that they increase coverage of lines and branches. We evaluate our prototype CoverUp implementation across a benchmark of challenging code derived from open-source Python projects, and show that CoverUp substantially improves on the state of the art. Compared to CodaMosa, a hybrid search/LLM-based test generator, CoverUp achieves a per-module median line+branch coverage of 80% (vs. 47%). Compared to MuTAP, a mutation/LLM-based test generator, CoverUp achieves an overall line+branch coverage of 90% (vs. 77%). We show that CoverUp's iterative, coverage-guided approach is crucial to its effectiveness, contributing to nearly 40% of its successes.

### Regression-based proximal causal inference for right-censored   time-to-event data
**Authors**: Kendrick Li, George C. Linderman, Xu Shi, Eric J. Tchetgen Tchetgen

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T15:39:29Z

**Summary**: Unmeasured confounding is one of the major concerns in causal inference from observational data. Proximal causal inference (PCI) is an emerging methodological framework to detect and potentially account for confounding bias by carefully leveraging a pair of negative control exposure (NCE) and outcome (NCO) variables, also known as treatment and outcome confounding proxies. Although regression-based PCI is well developed for binary and continuous outcomes, analogous PCI regression methods for right-censored time-to-event outcomes are currently lacking. In this paper, we propose a novel two-stage regression PCI approach for right-censored survival data under an additive hazard structural model. We provide theoretical justification for the proposed approach tailored to different types of NCOs, including continuous, count, and right-censored time-to-event variables. We illustrate the approach with an evaluation of the effectiveness of right heart catheterization among critically ill patients using data from the SUPPORT study. Our method is implemented in the open-access R package 'pci2s'.

### AnyBipe: An End-to-End Framework for Training and Deploying Bipedal   Robots Guided by Large Language Models
**Authors**: Yifei Yao, Wentao He, Chenyu Gu, Jiaheng Du, Fuwei Tan, Zhen Zhu, Junguo Lu

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T15:15:45Z

**Summary**: Training and deploying reinforcement learning (RL) policies for robots, especially in accomplishing specific tasks, presents substantial challenges. Recent advancements have explored diverse reward function designs, training techniques, simulation-to-reality (sim-to-real) transfers, and performance analysis methodologies, yet these still require significant human intervention. This paper introduces an end-to-end framework for training and deploying RL policies, guided by Large Language Models (LLMs), and evaluates its effectiveness on bipedal robots. The framework consists of three interconnected modules: an LLM-guided reward function design module, an RL training module leveraging prior work, and a sim-to-real homomorphic evaluation module. This design significantly reduces the need for human input by utilizing only essential simulation and deployment platforms, with the option to incorporate human-engineered strategies and historical data. We detail the construction of these modules, their advantages over traditional approaches, and demonstrate the framework's capability to autonomously develop and refine controlling strategies for bipedal robot locomotion, showcasing its potential to operate independently of human intervention.

### Inferring hyperuniformity from local structures via persistent homology
**Authors**: Abel H. G. Milor, Marco Salvalaglio

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T15:12:42Z

**Summary**: Hyperuniformity refers to the suppression of density fluctuations at large scales. Typical for ordered systems, this property also emerges in several disordered physical and biological systems, where it is particularly relevant to understand mechanisms of pattern formation and to exploit peculiar attributes, e.g., interaction with light and transport phenomena. While hyperuniformity is a global property, it has been shown in [Phys. Rev. Research 6, 023107 (2024)] that global hyperuniform characteristics systematically correlate with topological properties representative of local arrangements. In this work, building on this information, we explore and assess the inverse relationship between hyperuniformity and local structures in point distributions as described by persistent homology. Standard machine learning algorithms trained on persistence diagrams are shown to detect hyperuniformity with high accuracy. Therefore, we demonstrate that the information on patterns' local structure allows for inferring hyperuniformity. Then, addressing more quantitative aspects, we show that parameters defining hyperuniformity globally, for instance entering the structure factor, can be reconstructed by comparing persistence diagrams of targeted patterns with reference ones. We also explore the generation of patterns entailing given topological properties. The results of this study pave the way for advanced analysis of hyperuniform patterns including local information, and introduce basic concepts for their inverse design.

### Exploring Action-Centric Representations Through the Lens of   Rate-Distortion Theory
**Authors**: Miguel de Llanza Varona, Christopher L. Buckley, Beren Millidge

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T15:07:22Z

**Summary**: Organisms have to keep track of the information in the environment that is relevant for adaptive behaviour. Transmitting information in an economical and efficient way becomes crucial for limited-resourced agents living in high-dimensional environments. The efficient coding hypothesis claims that organisms seek to maximize the information about the sensory input in an efficient manner. Under Bayesian inference, this means that the role of the brain is to efficiently allocate resources in order to make predictions about the hidden states that cause sensory data. However, neither of those frameworks accounts for how that information is exploited downstream, leaving aside the action-oriented role of the perceptual system. Rate-distortion theory, which defines optimal lossy compression under constraints, has gained attention as a formal framework to explore goal-oriented efficient coding. In this work, we explore action-centric representations in the context of rate-distortion theory. We also provide a mathematical definition of abstractions and we argue that, as a summary of the relevant details, they can be used to fix the content of action-centric representations. We model action-centric representations using VAEs and we find that such representations i) are efficient lossy compressions of the data; ii) capture the task-dependent invariances necessary to achieve successful behaviour; and iii) are not in service of reconstructing the data. Thus, we conclude that full reconstruction of the data is rarely needed to achieve optimal behaviour, consistent with a teleological approach to perception.

**Authors**: Yubo Xie, Zonghui Liu, Zongyang Ma, Fanyuan Meng, Yan Xiao, Fahui Miao, Pearl Pu

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T15:00:45Z

**Summary**: Commonsense knowledge is essential for advancing natural language processing (NLP) by enabling models to engage in human-like reasoning, which requires a deeper understanding of context and often involves making inferences based on implicit external knowledge. This paper explores the integration of commonsense knowledge into various NLP tasks. We begin by reviewing prominent commonsense knowledge bases and then discuss the benchmarks used to evaluate the commonsense reasoning capabilities of NLP models, particularly language models. Furthermore, we highlight key methodologies for incorporating commonsense knowledge and their applications across different NLP tasks. The paper also examines the challenges and emerging trends in enhancing NLP systems with commonsense reasoning. All literature referenced in this survey can be accessed via our GitHub repository: https://github.com/yuboxie/awesome-commonsense.

### A parameterization of anisotropic Gaussian fields with penalized   complexity priors
**Authors**: Liam Llamazares-Elias, Jonas Latz, Finn Lindgren

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T14:55:12Z

**Summary**: Gaussian random fields (GFs) are fundamental tools in spatial modeling and can be represented flexibly and efficiently as solutions to stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs). The SPDEs depend on specific parameters, which enforce various field behaviors and can be estimated using Bayesian inference. However, the likelihood typically only provides limited insights into the covariance structure under in-fill asymptotics. In response, it is essential to leverage priors to achieve appropriate, meaningful covariance structures in the posterior. This study introduces a smooth, invertible parameterization of the correlation length and diffusion matrix of an anisotropic GF and constructs penalized complexity (PC) priors for the model when the parameters are constant in space. The formulated prior is weakly informative, effectively penalizing complexity by pushing the correlation range toward infinity and the anisotropy to zero.

### Visual Language Tracking with Multi-modal Interaction: A Robust   Benchmark
**Authors**: Xuchen Li, Shiyu Hu, Xiaokun Feng, Dailing Zhang, Meiqi Wu, Jing Zhang, Kaiqi Huang

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T14:54:37Z

**Summary**: Visual Language Tracking (VLT) enhances tracking by mitigating the limitations of relying solely on the visual modality, utilizing high-level semantic information through language. This integration of the language enables more advanced human-machine interaction. The essence of interaction is cognitive alignment, which typically requires multiple information exchanges, especially in the sequential decision-making process of VLT. However, current VLT benchmarks do not account for multi-round interactions during tracking. They provide only an initial text and bounding box (bbox) in the first frame, with no further interaction as tracking progresses, deviating from the original motivation of the VLT task. To address these limitations, we propose a novel and robust benchmark, VLT-MI (Visual Language Tracking with Multi-modal Interaction), which introduces multi-round interaction into the VLT task for the first time. (1) We generate diverse, multi-granularity texts for multi-round, multi-modal interaction based on existing mainstream VLT benchmarks using DTLLM-VLT, leveraging the world knowledge of LLMs. (2) We propose a new VLT interaction paradigm that achieves multi-round interaction through text updates and object recovery. When multiple tracking failures occur, we provide the tracker with more aligned texts and corrected bboxes through interaction, thereby expanding the scope of VLT downstream tasks. (3) We conduct comparative experiments on both traditional VLT benchmarks and VLT-MI, evaluating and analyzing the accuracy and robustness of trackers under the interactive paradigm. This work offers new insights and paradigms for the VLT task, enabling a fine-grained evaluation of multi-modal trackers. We believe this approach can be extended to additional datasets in the future, supporting broader evaluations and comparisons of video-language model capabilities.

### Inference in generalized linear models with robustness to misspecified   variances
**Authors**: Riccardo De Santis, Jelle J. Goeman, Jesse Hemerik, Samuel Davenport, Livio Finos

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T14:48:57Z

**Summary**: Generalized linear models usually assume a common dispersion parameter, an assumption that is seldom true in practice. Consequently, standard parametric methods may suffer appreciable loss of type I error control. As an alternative, we present a semi-parametric group-invariance method based on sign flipping of score contributions. Our method requires only the correct specification of the mean model, but is robust against any misspecification of the variance. We present tests for single as well as multiple regression coefficients. The test is asymptotically valid but shows excellent performance in small samples. We illustrate the method using RNA sequencing count data, for which it is difficult to model the overdispersion correctly. The method is available in the R library flipscores.

### DELTA: Decomposed Efficient Long-Term Robot Task Planning using Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Yuchen Liu, Luigi Palmieri, Sebastian Koch, Ilche Georgievski, Marco Aiello

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T14:42:08Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have sparked a revolution across many research fields. In robotics, the integration of common-sense knowledge from LLMs into task and motion planning has drastically advanced the field by unlocking unprecedented levels of context awareness. Despite their vast collection of knowledge, large language models may generate infeasible plans due to hallucinations or missing domain information. To address these challenges and improve plan feasibility and computational efficiency, we introduce DELTA, a novel LLM-informed task planning approach. By using scene graphs as environment representations within LLMs, DELTA achieves rapid generation of precise planning problem descriptions. To enhance planning performance, DELTA decomposes long-term task goals with LLMs into an autoregressive sequence of sub-goals, enabling automated task planners to efficiently solve complex problems. In our extensive evaluation, we show that DELTA enables an efficient and fully automatic task planning pipeline, achieving higher planning success rates and significantly shorter planning times compared to the state of the art.

### Exploring Graph Structure Comprehension Ability of Multimodal Large   Language Models: Case Studies
**Authors**: Zhiqiang Zhong, Davide Mottin

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T14:26:58Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in processing various data structures, including graphs. While previous research has focused on developing textual encoding methods for graph representation, the emergence of multimodal LLMs presents a new frontier for graph comprehension. These advanced models, capable of processing both text and images, offer potential improvements in graph understanding by incorporating visual representations alongside traditional textual data. This study investigates the impact of graph visualisations on LLM performance across a range of benchmark tasks at node, edge, and graph levels. Our experiments compare the effectiveness of multimodal approaches against purely textual graph representations. The results provide valuable insights into both the potential and limitations of leveraging visual graph modalities to enhance LLMs' graph structure comprehension abilities.

### Mergers of hairy black holes: Constraining topological couplings from   entropy
**Authors**: Kabir Chakravarti, Amit Reza, Leonardo G. Trombetta

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T14:21:05Z

**Summary**: Hairy black-holes are a unique prediction of certain theories that extend General Relativity (GR) with a scalar field. The presence of scalar hair is reflected non-trivially in the entropy of the black hole along with any topological coupling that may be present in the action. Demanding that a system of two merging black holes obeys the global second law of thermodynamics imposes a bound on this topological coupling coefficient. In this work we study how this bound is pushed from its GR value by the presence of scalar hair by considering estimates of binary black-hole merger parameters through inference studies of both mock and real gravitational-wave (GW) events. Although the scalar charge may produce a statistically significant deviation of the change in entropy over the GR prediction, we find no evidence of this happening in the data from real GW events taken from GWTC-1. We also find the entropy change to be susceptible to biases arising out of GW inferences which ends up being two orders of magnitude larger, therefore overwhelming any change, if at all, induced by the scalar hair.

### FP-VEC: Fingerprinting Large Language Models via Efficient Vector   Addition
**Authors**: Zhenhua Xu, Wenpeng Xing, Zhebo Wang, Chang Hu, Chen Jie, Meng Han

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T14:04:39Z

**Summary**: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) requires immense computational power and vast amounts of data. As a result, protecting the intellectual property of these models through fingerprinting is essential for ownership authentication. While adding fingerprints to LLMs through fine-tuning has been attempted, it remains costly and unscalable. In this paper, we introduce FP-VEC, a pilot study on using fingerprint vectors as an efficient fingerprinting method for LLMs. Our approach generates a fingerprint vector that represents a confidential signature embedded in the model, allowing the same fingerprint to be seamlessly incorporated into an unlimited number of LLMs via vector addition. Results on several LLMs show that FP-VEC is lightweight by running on CPU-only devices for fingerprinting, scalable with a single training and unlimited fingerprinting process, and preserves the model's normal behavior. The project page is available at https://fingerprintvector.github.io .

### AIPO: Improving Training Objective for Iterative Preference Optimization
**Authors**: Yaojie Shen, Xinyao Wang, Yulei Niu, Ying Zhou, Lexin Tang, Libo Zhang, Fan Chen, Longyin Wen

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T14:03:49Z

**Summary**: Preference Optimization (PO), is gaining popularity as an alternative choice of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs). Recent research on aligning LLMs iteratively with synthetic or partially synthetic data shows promising results in scaling up PO training for both academic settings and proprietary trained models such as Llama3. Despite its success, our study shows that the length exploitation issue present in PO is even more severe in Iterative Preference Optimization (IPO) due to the iterative nature of the process. In this work, we study iterative preference optimization with synthetic data. We share the findings and analysis along the way of building the iterative preference optimization pipeline. More specifically, we discuss the length exploitation issue during iterative preference optimization and propose our training objective for iterative preference optimization, namely Agreement-aware Iterative Preference Optimization (AIPO). To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we conduct comprehensive experiments and achieve state-of-the-art performance on MT-Bench, AlpacaEval 2.0, and Arena-Hard. Our implementation and model checkpoints will be made available at https://github.com/bytedance/AIPO.

### Federated Transfer Learning Based Cooperative Wideband Spectrum Sensing   with Model Pruning
**Authors**: Jibin Jia, Peihao Dong, Fuhui Zhou, Qihui Wu

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T13:36:40Z

**Summary**: For ultra-wideband and high-rate wireless communication systems, wideband spectrum sensing (WSS) is critical, since it empowers secondary users (SUs) to capture the spectrum holes for opportunistic transmission. However, WSS encounters challenges such as excessive costs of hardware and computation due to the high sampling rate, as well as robustness issues arising from scenario mismatch. In this paper, a WSS neural network (WSSNet) is proposed by exploiting multicoset preprocessing to enable the sub-Nyquist sampling, with the two dimensional convolution design specifically tailored to work with the preprocessed samples. A federated transfer learning (FTL) based framework mobilizing multiple SUs is further developed to achieve a robust model adaptable to various scenarios, which is paved by the selective weight pruning for the fast model adaptation and inference. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed FTL-WSSNet achieves the fairly good performance in different target scenarios even without local adaptation samples.

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T13:36:30Z

**Summary**: Hard X-ray photons with energies in the range of hundreds of keV typically undergo Compton scattering when they are incident on a detector. In this process, an incident photon deposits a fraction of its energy at the point of incidence and continues onward with a change in direction that depends on the amount of energy deposited. By using a pair of detectors to detect the point of incidence and the direction of the scattered photon, we can calculate the scattering direction and angle. The position of a source in the sky can be reconstructed using many Compton photon pairs from a source. We demonstrate this principle in the laboratory by using a pair of Cadmium Zinc Telluride detectors sensitive in the energy range of 20-200 keV. The laboratory setup consists of the two detectors placed perpendicular to each other in a lead-lined box. The detectors are read out by a custom-programmed Xilinx PYNQ FPGA board, and data is then transferred to a PC. The detectors are first calibrated using lines from $^{241}\mathrm{Am}$, $^{155}\mathrm{Eu}$ and $^{133}\mathrm{Ba}$ sources. We irradiated the detectors with a collimated $^{133}\mathrm{Ba}$ source and identified Compton scattering events for the 356 keV line. We run a Compton reconstruction algorithm and correctly infer the location of the source in the detector frame. This comprises a successful technology demonstration for a Compton imaging camera in the Hard X-ray regime. We present the details of our setup, the data acquisition process, and software algorithms, and showcase our results.

**Authors**: Giuseppe Paolo, Jonas Gonzalez-Billandon, Balázs Kégl

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T13:36:05Z

**Summary**: We propose Embodied AI as the next fundamental step in the pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence, juxtaposing it against current AI advancements, particularly Large Language Models. We traverse the evolution of the embodiment concept across diverse fields - philosophy, psychology, neuroscience, and robotics - to highlight how EAI distinguishes itself from the classical paradigm of static learning. By broadening the scope of Embodied AI, we introduce a theoretical framework based on cognitive architectures, emphasizing perception, action, memory, and learning as essential components of an embodied agent. This framework is aligned with Friston's active inference principle, offering a comprehensive approach to EAI development. Despite the progress made in the field of AI, substantial challenges, such as the formulation of a novel AI learning theory and the innovation of advanced hardware, persist. Our discussion lays down a foundational guideline for future Embodied AI research. Highlighting the importance of creating Embodied AI agents capable of seamless communication, collaboration, and coexistence with humans and other intelligent entities within real-world environments, we aim to steer the AI community towards addressing the multifaceted challenges and seizing the opportunities that lie ahead in the quest for AGI.

### A RAG Approach for Generating Competency Questions in Ontology   Engineering
**Authors**: Xueli Pan, Jacco van Ossenbruggen, Victor de Boer, Zhisheng Huang

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T13:34:32Z

**Summary**: Competency question (CQ) formulation is central to several ontology development and evaluation methodologies. Traditionally, the task of crafting these competency questions heavily relies on the effort of domain experts and knowledge engineers which is often time-consuming and labor-intensive. With the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs), there arises the possibility to automate and enhance this process. Unlike other similar works which use existing ontologies or knowledge graphs as input to LLMs, we present a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach that uses LLMs for the automatic generation of CQs given a set of scientific papers considered to be a domain knowledge base. We investigate its performance and specifically, we study the impact of different number of papers to the RAG and different temperature setting of the LLM. We conduct experiments using GPT-4 on two domain ontology engineering tasks and compare results against ground-truth CQs constructed by domain experts. Empirical assessments on the results, utilizing evaluation metrics (precision and consistency), reveal that compared to zero-shot prompting, adding relevant domain knowledge to the RAG improves the performance of LLMs on generating CQs for concrete ontology engineering tasks.

### Your Weak LLM is Secretly a Strong Teacher for Alignment
**Authors**: Leitian Tao, Yixuan Li

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T13:24:52Z

**Summary**: The burgeoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have underscored the need for alignment to ensure these models act in accordance with human values and intentions. Existing alignment frameworks present constraints either in the form of expensive human effort or high computational costs. This paper explores a promising middle ground, where we employ a weak LLM that is significantly less resource-intensive than top-tier models, yet offers more automation than purely human feedback. We present a systematic study to evaluate and understand weak LLM's ability to generate feedback for alignment. Our empirical findings demonstrate that weak LLMs can provide feedback that rivals or even exceeds that of fully human-annotated data. Our study indicates a minimized impact of model size on feedback efficacy, shedding light on a scalable and sustainable alignment strategy. To deepen our understanding of alignment under weak LLM feedback, we conduct a series of qualitative and quantitative analyses, offering novel insights into the quality discrepancies between human feedback vs. weak LLM feedback.

### Mutual Theory of Mind in Human-AI Collaboration: An Empirical Study with   LLM-driven AI Agents in a Real-time Shared Workspace Task
**Authors**: Shao Zhang, Xihuai Wang, Wenhao Zhang, Yongshan Chen, Landi Gao, Dakuo Wang, Weinan Zhang, Xinbing Wang, Ying Wen

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T13:19:48Z

**Summary**: Theory of Mind (ToM) significantly impacts human collaboration and communication as a crucial capability to understand others. When AI agents with ToM capability collaborate with humans, Mutual Theory of Mind (MToM) arises in such human-AI teams (HATs). The MToM process, which involves interactive communication and ToM-based strategy adjustment, affects the team's performance and collaboration process. To explore the MToM process, we conducted a mixed-design experiment using a large language model-driven AI agent with ToM and communication modules in a real-time shared-workspace task. We find that the agent's ToM capability does not significantly impact team performance but enhances human understanding of the agent and the feeling of being understood. Most participants in our study believe verbal communication increases human burden, and the results show that bidirectional communication leads to lower HAT performance. We discuss the results' implications for designing AI agents that collaborate with humans in real-time shared workspace tasks.

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T13:09:41Z

**Summary**: Advanced AI assistants combine frontier LLMs and tool access to autonomously perform complex tasks on behalf of users. While the helpfulness of such assistants can increase dramatically with access to user information including emails and documents, this raises privacy concerns about assistants sharing inappropriate information with third parties without user supervision. To steer information-sharing assistants to behave in accordance with privacy expectations, we propose to operationalize contextual integrity (CI), a framework that equates privacy with the appropriate flow of information in a given context. In particular, we design and evaluate a number of strategies to steer assistants' information-sharing actions to be CI compliant. Our evaluation is based on a novel form filling benchmark composed of human annotations of common webform applications, and it reveals that prompting frontier LLMs to perform CI-based reasoning yields strong results.

### LLaQo: Towards a Query-Based Coach in Expressive Music Performance   Assessment
**Authors**: Huan Zhang, Vincent Cheung, Hayato Nishioka, Simon Dixon, Shinichi Furuya

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T12:59:39Z

**Summary**: Research in music understanding has extensively explored composition-level attributes such as key, genre, and instrumentation through advanced representations, leading to cross-modal applications using large language models. However, aspects of musical performance such as stylistic expression and technique remain underexplored, along with the potential of using large language models to enhance educational outcomes with customized feedback. To bridge this gap, we introduce LLaQo, a Large Language Query-based music coach that leverages audio language modeling to provide detailed and formative assessments of music performances. We also introduce instruction-tuned query-response datasets that cover a variety of performance dimensions from pitch accuracy to articulation, as well as contextual performance understanding (such as difficulty and performance techniques). Utilizing AudioMAE encoder and Vicuna-7b LLM backend, our model achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in predicting teachers' performance ratings, as well as in identifying piece difficulty and playing techniques. Textual responses from LLaQo was moreover rated significantly higher compared to other baseline models in a user study using audio-text matching. Our proposed model can thus provide informative answers to open-ended questions related to musical performance from audio data.

### Optimizing Ingredient Substitution Using Large Language Models to   Enhance Phytochemical Content in Recipes
**Authors**: Luis Rita, Josh Southern, Ivan Laponogov, Kyle Higgins, Kirill Veselkov

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T12:55:45Z

**Summary**: In the emerging field of computational gastronomy, aligning culinary practices with scientifically supported nutritional goals is increasingly important. This study explores how large language models (LLMs) can be applied to optimize ingredient substitutions in recipes, specifically to enhance the phytochemical content of meals. Phytochemicals are bioactive compounds found in plants, which, based on preclinical studies, may offer potential health benefits. We fine-tuned models, including OpenAI's GPT-3.5, DaVinci, and Meta's TinyLlama, using an ingredient substitution dataset. These models were used to predict substitutions that enhance phytochemical content and create a corresponding enriched recipe dataset. Our approach improved Hit@1 accuracy on ingredient substitution tasks, from the baseline 34.53 plus-minus 0.10% to 38.03 plus-minus 0.28% on the original GISMo dataset, and from 40.24 plus-minus 0.36% to 54.46 plus-minus 0.29% on a refined version of the same dataset. These substitutions led to the creation of 1,951 phytochemically enriched ingredient pairings and 1,639 unique recipes. While this approach demonstrates potential in optimizing ingredient substitutions, caution must be taken when drawing conclusions about health benefits, as the claims are based on preclinical evidence. Future work should include clinical validation and broader datasets to further evaluate the nutritional impact of these substitutions. This research represents a step forward in using AI to promote healthier eating practices, providing potential pathways for integrating computational methods with nutritional science.

**Authors**: Jialu Tang, Tong Xia, Yuan Lu, Cecilia Mascolo, Aaqib Saeed

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T12:50:36Z

**Summary**: Interpreting electrocardiograms (ECGs) and generating comprehensive reports remain challenging tasks in cardiology, often requiring specialized expertise and significant time investment. To address these critical issues, we propose ECG-ReGen, a retrieval-based approach for ECG-to-text report generation and question answering. Our method leverages a self-supervised learning for the ECG encoder, enabling efficient similarity searches and report retrieval. By combining pre-training with dynamic retrieval and Large Language Model (LLM)-based refinement, ECG-ReGen effectively analyzes ECG data and answers related queries, with the potential of improving patient care. Experiments conducted on the PTB-XL and MIMIC-IV-ECG datasets demonstrate superior performance in both in-domain and cross-domain scenarios for report generation. Furthermore, our approach exhibits competitive performance on ECG-QA dataset compared to fully supervised methods when utilizing off-the-shelf LLMs for zero-shot question answering. This approach, effectively combining self-supervised encoder and LLMs, offers a scalable and efficient solution for accurate ECG interpretation, holding significant potential to enhance clinical decision-making.

**Authors**: Qianou Ma, Weirui Peng, Hua Shen, Kenneth Koedinger, Tongshuang Wu

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T12:34:14Z

**Summary**: Prompting ChatGPT to achieve complex goals (e.g., creating a customer support chatbot) often demands meticulous prompt engineering, including aspects like fluent writing and chain-of-thought techniques. While emerging prompt optimizers can automatically refine many of these aspects, we argue that clearly conveying customized requirements (e.g., how to handle diverse inputs) remains a human-centric challenge. In this work, we introduce Requirement-Oriented Prompt Engineering (ROPE), a paradigm that focuses human attention on generating clear, complete requirements during prompting. We implement ROPE through an assessment and training suite that provides deliberate practice with LLM-generated feedback. In a study with 30 novices, we show that requirement-focused training doubles novices' prompting performance, significantly outperforming conventional prompt engineering training and prompt optimization. We also demonstrate that high-quality LLM outputs are directly tied to the quality of input requirements. Our work paves the way for more effective task delegation in human-LLM collaborative prompting.

### Performance Law of Large Language Models
**Authors**: Chuhan Wu, Ruiming Tang

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T12:28:45Z

**Summary**: Guided by the belief of the scaling law, large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in recent years. However, scaling law only gives a qualitative estimation of loss, which is influenced by various factors such as model architectures, data distributions, tokenizers, and computation precision. Thus, estimating the real performance of LLMs with different training settings rather than loss may be quite useful in practical development. In this article, we present an empirical equation named "Performance Law" to directly predict the MMLU score of an LLM, which is a widely used metric to indicate the general capability of LLMs in real-world conversations and applications. Based on only a few key hyperparameters of the LLM architecture and the size of training data, we obtain a quite accurate MMLU prediction of various LLMs with diverse sizes and architectures developed by different organizations in different years. Performance law can be used to guide the choice of LLM architecture and the effective allocation of computational resources without extensive experiments.

### Defining and Extracting generalizable interaction primitives from DNNs
**Authors**: Lu Chen, Siyu Lou, Benhao Huang, Quanshi Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T12:27:44Z

**Summary**: Faithfully summarizing the knowledge encoded by a deep neural network (DNN) into a few symbolic primitive patterns without losing much information represents a core challenge in explainable AI. To this end, Ren et al. (2024) have derived a series of theorems to prove that the inference score of a DNN can be explained as a small set of interactions between input variables. However, the lack of generalization power makes it still hard to consider such interactions as faithful primitive patterns encoded by the DNN. Therefore, given different DNNs trained for the same task, we develop a new method to extract interactions that are shared by these DNNs. Experiments show that the extracted interactions can better reflect common knowledge shared by different DNNs.

### Causal Transformer for Fusion and Pose Estimation in Deep Visual   Inertial Odometry
**Authors**: Yunus Bilge Kurt, Ahmet Akman, A. Aydın Alatan

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T12:21:25Z

**Summary**: In recent years, transformer-based architectures become the de facto standard for sequence modeling in deep learning frameworks. Inspired by the successful examples, we propose a causal visual-inertial fusion transformer (VIFT) for pose estimation in deep visual-inertial odometry. This study aims to improve pose estimation accuracy by leveraging the attention mechanisms in transformers, which better utilize historical data compared to the recurrent neural network (RNN) based methods seen in recent methods. Transformers typically require large-scale data for training. To address this issue, we utilize inductive biases for deep VIO networks. Since latent visual-inertial feature vectors encompass essential information for pose estimation, we employ transformers to refine pose estimates by updating latent vectors temporally. Our study also examines the impact of data imbalance and rotation learning methods in supervised end-to-end learning of visual inertial odometry by utilizing specialized gradients in backpropagation for the elements of SE$(3)$ group. The proposed method is end-to-end trainable and requires only a monocular camera and IMU during inference. Experimental results demonstrate that VIFT increases the accuracy of monocular VIO networks, achieving state-of-the-art results when compared to previous methods on the KITTI dataset. The code will be made available at https://github.com/ybkurt/VIFT.

### Online Network Inference from Graph-Stationary Signals with Hidden Nodes
**Authors**: Andrei Buciulea, Madeline Navarro, Samuel Rey, Santiago Segarra, Antonio G. Marques

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T12:09:09Z

**Summary**: Graph learning is the fundamental task of estimating unknown graph connectivity from available data. Typical approaches assume that not only is all information available simultaneously but also that all nodes can be observed. However, in many real-world scenarios, data can neither be known completely nor obtained all at once. We present a novel method for online graph estimation that accounts for the presence of hidden nodes. We consider signals that are stationary on the underlying graph, which provides a model for the unknown connections to hidden nodes. We then formulate a convex optimization problem for graph learning from streaming, incomplete graph signals. We solve the proposed problem through an efficient proximal gradient algorithm that can run in real-time as data arrives sequentially. Additionally, we provide theoretical conditions under which our online algorithm is similar to batch-wise solutions. Through experimental results on synthetic and real-world data, we demonstrate the viability of our approach for online graph learning in the presence of missing observations.

### Applying Bayesian Data Analysis for Causal Inference about Requirements   Quality: A Controlled Experiment
**Authors**: Julian Frattini, Davide Fucci, Richard Torkar, Lloyd Montgomery, Michael Unterkalmsteiner, Jannik Fischbach, Daniel Mendez

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T11:46:33Z

**Summary**: It is commonly accepted that the quality of requirements specifications impacts subsequent software engineering activities. However, we still lack empirical evidence to support organizations in deciding whether their requirements are good enough or impede subsequent activities. We aim to contribute empirical evidence to the effect that requirements quality defects have on a software engineering activity that depends on this requirement. We conduct a controlled experiment in which 25 participants from industry and university generate domain models from four natural language requirements containing different quality defects. We evaluate the resulting models using both frequentist and Bayesian data analysis. Contrary to our expectations, our results show that the use of passive voice only has a minor impact on the resulting domain models. The use of ambiguous pronouns, however, shows a strong effect on various properties of the resulting domain models. Most notably, ambiguous pronouns lead to incorrect associations in domain models. Despite being equally advised against by literature and frequentist methods, the Bayesian data analysis shows that the two investigated quality defects have vastly different impacts on software engineering activities and, hence, deserve different levels of attention. Our employed method can be further utilized by researchers to improve reliable, detailed empirical evidence on requirements quality.

### Exclusive Style Removal for Cross Domain Novel Class Discovery
**Authors**: Yicheng Wang, Feng Liu, Junmin Liu, Kai Sun

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T11:36:49Z

**Summary**: As a promising field in open-world learning, \textit{Novel Class Discovery} (NCD) is usually a task to cluster unseen novel classes in an unlabeled set based on the prior knowledge of labeled data within the same domain. However, the performance of existing NCD methods could be severely compromised when novel classes are sampled from a different distribution with the labeled ones. In this paper, we explore and establish the solvability of NCD in cross domain setting with the necessary condition that style information must be removed. Based on the theoretical analysis, we introduce an exclusive style removal module for extracting style information that is distinctive from the baseline features, thereby facilitating inference. Moreover, this module is easy to integrate with other NCD methods, acting as a plug-in to improve performance on novel classes with different distributions compared to the seen labeled set. Additionally, recognizing the non-negligible influence of different backbones and pre-training strategies on the performance of the NCD methods, we build a fair benchmark for future NCD research. Extensive experiments on three common datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed module.

### Deep Learning of Multivariate Extremes via a Geometric Representation
**Authors**: Callum J. R. Murphy-Barltrop, Reetam Majumder, Jordan Richards

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T11:18:42Z

**Summary**: The study of geometric extremes, where extremal dependence properties are inferred from the deterministic limiting shapes of scaled sample clouds, provides an exciting approach to modelling the extremes of multivariate data. These shapes, termed limit sets, link together several popular extremal dependence modelling frameworks. Although the geometric approach is becoming an increasingly popular modelling tool, current inference techniques are limited to a low dimensional setting (d < 5), and generally require rigid modelling assumptions. In this work, we propose a range of novel theoretical results to aid with the implementation of the geometric extremes framework and introduce the first approach to modelling limit sets using deep learning. By leveraging neural networks, we construct asymptotically-justified yet flexible semi-parametric models for extremal dependence of high-dimensional data. We showcase the efficacy of our deep approach by modelling the complex extremal dependencies between meteorological and oceanographic variables in the North Sea off the coast of the UK.

### Fusing Dynamics Equation: A Social Opinions Prediction Algorithm with   LLM-based Agents
**Authors**: Junchi Yao, Hongjie Zhang, Jie Ou, Dingyi Zuo, Zheng Yang, Zhicheng Dong

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T11:02:28Z

**Summary**: In the context where social media is increasingly becoming a significant platform for social movements and the formation of public opinion, accurately simulating and predicting the dynamics of user opinions is of great importance for understanding social phenomena, policy making, and guiding public opinion. However, existing simulation methods face challenges in capturing the complexity and dynamics of user behavior. Addressing this issue, this paper proposes an innovative simulation method for the dynamics of social media user opinions, the FDE-LLM algorithm, which incorporates opinion dynamics and epidemic model. This effectively constrains the actions and opinion evolution process of large language models (LLM), making them more aligned with the real cyber world. In particular, the FDE-LLM categorizes users into opinion leaders and followers. Opinion leaders are based on LLM role-playing and are constrained by the CA model, while opinion followers are integrated into a dynamic system that combines the CA model with the SIR model. This innovative design significantly improves the accuracy and efficiency of the simulation. Experiments were conducted on four real Weibo datasets and validated using the open-source model ChatGLM. The results show that, compared to traditional agent-based modeling (ABM) opinion dynamics algorithms and LLM-based opinion diffusion algorithms, our FDE-LLM algorithm demonstrates higher accuracy and interpretability.

### On spiked eigenvalues of a renormalized sample covariance matrix from   multi-population
**Authors**: Weiming Li, Zeng Li, Junpeng Zhu

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T11:00:17Z

**Summary**: Sample covariance matrices from multi-population typically exhibit several large spiked eigenvalues, which stem from differences between population means and are crucial for inference on the underlying data structure. This paper investigates the asymptotic properties of spiked eigenvalues of a renormalized sample covariance matrices from multi-population in the ultrahigh dimensional context where the dimension-to-sample size ratio p/n go to infinity. The first- and second-order convergence of these spikes are established based on asymptotic properties of three types of sesquilinear forms from multi-population. These findings are further applied to two scenarios,including determination of total number of subgroups and a new criterion for evaluating clustering results in the absence of true labels. Additionally, we provide a unified framework with p/n->c\in (0,\infty] that integrates the asymptotic results in both high and ultrahigh dimensional settings.

### Layerwise Change of Knowledge in Neural Networks
**Authors**: Xu Cheng, Lei Cheng, Zhaoran Peng, Yang Xu, Tian Han, Quanshi Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T10:59:24Z

**Summary**: This paper aims to explain how a deep neural network (DNN) gradually extracts new knowledge and forgets noisy features through layers in forward propagation. Up to now, although the definition of knowledge encoded by the DNN has not reached a consensus, Previous studies have derived a series of mathematical evidence to take interactions as symbolic primitive inference patterns encoded by a DNN. We extend the definition of interactions and, for the first time, extract interactions encoded by intermediate layers. We quantify and track the newly emerged interactions and the forgotten interactions in each layer during the forward propagation, which shed new light on the learning behavior of DNNs. The layer-wise change of interactions also reveals the change of the generalization capacity and instability of feature representations of a DNN.

### Quantum-secure multiparty deep learning
**Authors**: Kfir Sulimany, Sri Krishna Vadlamani, Ryan Hamerly, Prahlad Iyengar, Dirk Englund

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T10:49:21Z

**Summary**: Secure multiparty computation enables the joint evaluation of multivariate functions across distributed users while ensuring the privacy of their local inputs. This field has become increasingly urgent due to the exploding demand for computationally intensive deep learning inference. These computations are typically offloaded to cloud computing servers, leading to vulnerabilities that can compromise the security of the clients' data. To solve this problem, we introduce a linear algebra engine that leverages the quantum nature of light for information-theoretically secure multiparty computation using only conventional telecommunication components. We apply this linear algebra engine to deep learning and derive rigorous upper bounds on the information leakage of both the deep neural network weights and the client's data via the Holevo and the Cram\'er-Rao bounds, respectively. Applied to the MNIST classification task, we obtain test accuracies exceeding $96\%$ while leaking less than $0.1$ bits per weight symbol and $0.01$ bits per data symbol. This weight leakage is an order of magnitude below the minimum bit precision required for accurate deep learning using state-of-the-art quantization techniques. Our work lays the foundation for practical quantum-secure computation and unlocks secure cloud deep learning as a field.

### L3Cube-IndicQuest: A Benchmark Questing Answering Dataset for Evaluating   Knowledge of LLMs in Indic Context
**Authors**: Pritika Rohera, Chaitrali Ginimav, Akanksha Salunke, Gayatri Sawant, Raviraj Joshi

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T10:48:35Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant progress in incorporating Indic languages within multilingual models. However, it is crucial to quantitatively assess whether these languages perform comparably to globally dominant ones, such as English. Currently, there is a lack of benchmark datasets specifically designed to evaluate the regional knowledge of LLMs in various Indic languages. In this paper, we present the L3Cube-IndicQuest, a gold-standard question-answering benchmark dataset designed to evaluate how well multilingual LLMs capture regional knowledge across various Indic languages. The dataset contains 200 question-answer pairs, each for English and 19 Indic languages, covering five domains specific to the Indic region. We aim for this dataset to serve as a benchmark, providing ground truth for evaluating the performance of LLMs in understanding and representing knowledge relevant to the Indian context. The IndicQuest can be used for both reference-based evaluation and LLM-as-a-judge evaluation. The dataset is shared publicly at https://github.com/l3cube-pune/indic-nlp .

### NeSHFS: Neighborhood Search with Heuristic-based Feature Selection for   Click-Through Rate Prediction
**Authors**: Dogukan Aksu, Ismail Hakki Toroslu, Hasan Davulcu

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T10:43:18Z

**Summary**: Click-through-rate (CTR) prediction plays an important role in online advertising and ad recommender systems. In the past decade, maximizing CTR has been the main focus of model development and solution creation. Therefore, researchers and practitioners have proposed various models and solutions to enhance the effectiveness of CTR prediction. Most of the existing literature focuses on capturing either implicit or explicit feature interactions. Although implicit interactions are successfully captured in some studies, explicit interactions present a challenge for achieving high CTR by extracting both low-order and high-order feature interactions. Unnecessary and irrelevant features may cause high computational time and low prediction performance. Furthermore, certain features may perform well with specific predictive models while underperforming with others. Also, feature distribution may fluctuate due to traffic variations. Most importantly, in live production environments, resources are limited, and the time for inference is just as crucial as training time. Because of all these reasons, feature selection is one of the most important factors in enhancing CTR prediction model performance. Simple filter-based feature selection algorithms do not perform well and they are not sufficient. An effective and efficient feature selection algorithm is needed to consistently filter the most useful features during live CTR prediction process. In this paper, we propose a heuristic algorithm named Neighborhood Search with Heuristic-based Feature Selection (NeSHFS) to enhance CTR prediction performance while reducing dimensionality and training time costs. We conduct comprehensive experiments on three public datasets to validate the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed solution.

**Authors**: Rania Hossam, Ahmed Heakl, Walid Gomaa

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T10:27:27Z

**Summary**: Traditional fish farming practices often lead to inefficient feeding, resulting in environmental issues and reduced productivity. We developed an innovative system combining computer vision and IoT technologies for precise Tilapia feeding. Our solution uses real-time IoT sensors to monitor water quality parameters and computer vision algorithms to analyze fish size and count, determining optimal feed amounts. A mobile app enables remote monitoring and control. We utilized YOLOv8 for keypoint detection to measure Tilapia weight from length, achieving \textbf{94\%} precision on 3,500 annotated images. Pixel-based measurements were converted to centimeters using depth estimation for accurate feeding calculations. Our method, with data collection mirroring inference conditions, significantly improved results. Preliminary estimates suggest this approach could increase production up to 58 times compared to traditional farms. Our models, code, and dataset are open-source~\footnote{The code, dataset, and models are available upon reasonable request.

### B4: Towards Optimal Assessment of Plausible Code Solutions with   Plausible Tests
**Authors**: Mouxiang Chen, Zhongxin Liu, He Tao, Yusu Hong, David Lo, Xin Xia, Jianling Sun

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T10:22:08Z

**Summary**: Selecting the best code solution from multiple generated ones is an essential task in code generation, which can be achieved by using some reliable validators (e.g., developer-written test cases) for assistance. Since reliable test cases are not always available and can be expensive to build in practice, researchers propose to automatically generate test cases to assess code solutions. However, when both code solutions and test cases are plausible and not reliable, selecting the best solution becomes challenging. Although some heuristic strategies have been proposed to tackle this problem, they lack a strong theoretical guarantee and it is still an open question whether an optimal selection strategy exists. Our work contributes in two ways. First, we show that within a Bayesian framework, the optimal selection strategy can be defined based on the posterior probability of the observed passing states between solutions and tests. The problem of identifying the best solution is then framed as an integer programming problem. Second, we propose an efficient approach for approximating this optimal (yet uncomputable) strategy, where the approximation error is bounded by the correctness of prior knowledge. We then incorporate effective prior knowledge to tailor code generation tasks. Both theoretical and empirical studies confirm that existing heuristics are limited in selecting the best solutions with plausible test cases. Our proposed approximated optimal strategy B4 significantly surpasses existing heuristics in selecting code solutions generated by large language models (LLMs) with LLM-generated tests, achieving a relative performance improvement by up to 50% over the strongest heuristic and 246% over the random selection in the most challenging scenarios. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/ZJU-CTAG/B4.

### GenMapping: Unleashing the Potential of Inverse Perspective Mapping for   Robust Online HD Map Construction
**Authors**: Siyu Li, Kailun Yang, Hao Shi, Song Wang, You Yao, Zhiyong Li

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T10:15:28Z

**Summary**: Online High-Definition (HD) maps have emerged as the preferred option for autonomous driving, overshadowing the counterpart offline HD maps due to flexible update capability and lower maintenance costs. However, contemporary online HD map models embed parameters of visual sensors into training, resulting in a significant decrease in generalization performance when applied to visual sensors with different parameters. Inspired by the inherent potential of Inverse Perspective Mapping (IPM), where camera parameters are decoupled from the training process, we have designed a universal map generation framework, GenMapping. The framework is established with a triadic synergy architecture, including principal and dual auxiliary branches. When faced with a coarse road image with local distortion translated via IPM, the principal branch learns robust global features under the state space models. The two auxiliary branches are a dense perspective branch and a sparse prior branch. The former exploits the correlation information between static and moving objects, whereas the latter introduces the prior knowledge of OpenStreetMap (OSM). The triple-enhanced merging module is crafted to synergistically integrate the unique spatial features from all three branches. To further improve generalization capabilities, a Cross-View Map Learning (CVML) scheme is leveraged to realize joint learning within the common space. Additionally, a Bidirectional Data Augmentation (BiDA) module is introduced to mitigate reliance on datasets concurrently. A thorough array of experimental results shows that the proposed model surpasses current state-of-the-art methods in both semantic mapping and vectorized mapping, while also maintaining a rapid inference speed. The source code will be publicly available at https://github.com/lynn-yu/GenMapping.

### Large-scale simulations of vortex Majorana zero modes in topological   crystalline insulators
**Authors**: Chun Yu Wan, Yujun Zhao, Yaoyi Li, Jinfeng Jia, Junwei Liu

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T10:03:22Z

**Summary**: Topological crystalline insulators are known to support multiple Majorana zero modes (MZMs) at a single vortex, their hybridization is forbidden by a magnetic mirror symmetry $M_T$. Due to the limited energy resolution of scanning tunneling microscopes and the very small energy spacing of trivial bound states, it remains challenging to directly probe and demonstrate the existence of multiple MZMs. In this work, we propose to demonstrate the existence of MZMs by studying the hybridization of multiple MZMs in a symmetry breaking field. The different responses of trivial bound states and MZMs can be inferred from their spatial distribution in the vortex. However, the theoretical simulations are very demanding since it requires an extremely large system in real space. By utilizing the kernel polynomial method, we can efficiently simulate large lattices with over $10^8$ orbitals to compute the local density of states which bridges the gap between theoretical studies based on minimal models and experimental measurements. We show that the spatial distribution of MZMs and trivial vortex bound states indeed differs drastically in tilted magnetic fields. The zero-bias peak elongates when the magnetic field preserves $M_T$, while it splits when $M_T$ is broken, giving rise to an anisotropic magnetic response. Since the bulk of SnTe are metallic, we also study the robustness of MZMs against the bulk states, and clarify when can the MZMs produce a pronounced anisotropic magnetic response.

**Authors**: Xinrun Du, Zhouliang Yu, Songyang Gao, Ding Pan, Yuyang Cheng, Ziyang Ma, Ruibin Yuan, Xingwei Qu, Jiaheng Liu, Tianyu Zheng, Xinchen Luo, Guorui Zhou, Wenhu Chen, Ge Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T09:47:29Z

**Summary**: In this study, we introduce CT-LLM, a 2B large language model (LLM) that illustrates a pivotal shift towards prioritizing the Chinese language in developing LLMs. Uniquely initiated from scratch, CT-LLM diverges from the conventional methodology by primarily incorporating Chinese textual data, utilizing an extensive corpus of 1,200 billion tokens, including 800 billion Chinese tokens, 300 billion English tokens, and 100 billion code tokens. This strategic composition facilitates the model's exceptional proficiency in understanding and processing Chinese, a capability further enhanced through alignment techniques. Demonstrating remarkable performance on the CHC-Bench, CT-LLM excels in Chinese language tasks, and showcases its adeptness in English through SFT. This research challenges the prevailing paradigm of training LLMs predominantly on English corpora and then adapting them to other languages, broadening the horizons for LLM training methodologies. By open-sourcing the full process of training a Chinese LLM, including a detailed data processing procedure with the obtained Massive Appropriate Pretraining Chinese Corpus (MAP-CC), a well-chosen multidisciplinary Chinese Hard Case Benchmark (CHC-Bench), and the 2B-size Chinese Tiny LLM (CT-LLM), we aim to foster further exploration and innovation in both academia and industry, paving the way for more inclusive and versatile language models.

### FaçAID: A Transformer Model for Neuro-Symbolic Facade Reconstruction
**Authors**: Aleksander Plocharski, Jan Swidzinski, Joanna Porter-Sobieraj, Przemyslaw Musialski

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T09:39:53Z

**Summary**: We introduce a neuro-symbolic transformer-based model that converts flat, segmented facade structures into procedural definitions using a custom-designed split grammar. To facilitate this, we first develop a semi-complex split grammar tailored for architectural facades and then generate a dataset comprising of facades alongside their corresponding procedural representations. This dataset is used to train our transformer model to convert segmented, flat facades into the procedural language of our grammar. During inference, the model applies this learned transformation to new facade segmentations, providing a procedural representation that users can adjust to generate varied facade designs. This method not only automates the conversion of static facade images into dynamic, editable procedural formats but also enhances the design flexibility, allowing for easy modifications.

**Summary**: Robotic agents must master common sense and long-term sequential decisions to solve daily tasks through natural language instruction. The developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) in natural language processing have inspired efforts to use LLMs in complex robot planning. Despite LLMs' great generalization and comprehension of instruction tasks, LLMs-generated task plans sometimes lack feasibility and correctness. To address the problem, we propose a RoboGPT agent\footnote{our code and dataset will be released soon} for making embodied long-term decisions for daily tasks, with two modules: 1) LLMs-based planning with re-plan to break the task into multiple sub-goals; 2) RoboSkill individually designed for sub-goals to learn better navigation and manipulation skills. The LLMs-based planning is enhanced with a new robotic dataset and re-plan, called RoboGPT. The new robotic dataset of 67k daily instruction tasks is gathered for fine-tuning the Llama model and obtaining RoboGPT. RoboGPT planner with strong generalization can plan hundreds of daily instruction tasks. Additionally, a low-computational Re-Plan module is designed to allow plans to flexibly adapt to the environment, thereby addressing the nomenclature diversity challenge. The proposed RoboGPT agent outperforms SOTA methods on the ALFRED daily tasks. Moreover, RoboGPT planner exceeds SOTA LLM-based planners like ChatGPT in task-planning rationality for hundreds of unseen daily tasks, and even other domain tasks, while keeping the large model's original broad application and generality.

### Where We Have Arrived in Proving the Emergence of Sparse Symbolic   Concepts in AI Models
**Authors**: Qihan Ren, Jiayang Gao, Wen Shen, Quanshi Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T09:22:38Z

**Summary**: This study aims to prove the emergence of symbolic concepts (or more precisely, sparse primitive inference patterns) in well-trained deep neural networks (DNNs). Specifically, we prove the following three conditions for the emergence. (i) The high-order derivatives of the network output with respect to the input variables are all zero. (ii) The DNN can be used on occluded samples and when the input sample is less occluded, the DNN will yield higher confidence. (iii) The confidence of the DNN does not significantly degrade on occluded samples. These conditions are quite common, and we prove that under these conditions, the DNN will only encode a relatively small number of sparse interactions between input variables. Moreover, we can consider such interactions as symbolic primitive inference patterns encoded by a DNN, because we show that inference scores of the DNN on an exponentially large number of randomly masked samples can always be well mimicked by numerical effects of just a few interactions.

### Online Learning Of Expanding Graphs
**Authors**: Samuel Rey, Bishwadeep Das, Elvin Isufi

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T09:20:42Z

**Summary**: This paper addresses the problem of online network topology inference for expanding graphs from a stream of spatiotemporal signals. Online algorithms for dynamic graph learning are crucial in delay-sensitive applications or when changes in topology occur rapidly. While existing works focus on inferring the connectivity within a fixed set of nodes, in practice, the graph can grow as new nodes join the network. This poses additional challenges like modeling temporal dynamics involving signals and graphs of different sizes. This growth also increases the computational complexity of the learning process, which may become prohibitive. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to tackle this setting. We propose a general online algorithm based on projected proximal gradient descent that accounts for the increasing graph size at each iteration. Recursively updating the sample covariance matrix is a key aspect of our approach. We introduce a strategy that enables different types of updates for nodes that just joined the network and for previously existing nodes. To provide further insights into the proposed method, we specialize it in Gaussian Markov random field settings, where we analyze the computational complexity and characterize the dynamic cumulative regret. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach using both controlled experiments and real-world datasets from epidemic and financial networks.

### A Modified Initial Mass Function of the First Stars with Explodability   Theory under Different Enrichment Scenarios
**Authors**: Ruizheng Jiang, Gang Zhao, Haining Li, Qianfan Xing

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T09:18:32Z

**Summary**: The most metal-poor stars record the earliest metal enrichment triggered by Population III stars. By comparing observed abundance patterns with theoretical yields of metal-free stars, physical properties of their first star progenitors can be inferred, including zero-age main-sequence mass and explosion energy. In this work, the initial mass distribution (IMF) of first stars is obtained from the largest analysis to date of 406 very metal-poor stars with the newest LAMOST/Subaru high-resolution spectroscopic observations. However, the mass distribution fails to be consistent with the Salpeter IMF, which is also reported by previous studies. Here we modify the standard power-law function with explodability theory. The mass distribution of Population III stars could be well explained by ensuring the initial metal enrichment to originate from successful supernova explosions. Based on the modified power-law function, we suggest an extremely top-heavy or nearly flat initial mass function with a large explosion energy exponent. This indicates that supernova explodability should be considered in the earliest metal enrichment process in the Universe.

### CPL: Critical Planning Step Learning Boosts LLM Generalization in   Reasoning Tasks
**Authors**: Tianlong Wang, Xueting Han, Jing Bai

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T08:59:31Z

**Summary**: Post-training large language models (LLMs) to develop reasoning capabilities has proven effective across diverse domains, such as mathematical reasoning and code generation. However, existing methods primarily focus on improving task-specific reasoning but have not adequately addressed the model's generalization capabilities across a broader range of reasoning tasks. To tackle this challenge, we introduce Critical Planning Step Learning (CPL), which leverages Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to explore diverse planning steps in multi-step reasoning tasks. Based on long-term outcomes, CPL learns step-level planning preferences to improve the model's planning capabilities and, consequently, its general reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, while effective in many scenarios for aligning LLMs, existing preference learning approaches like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) struggle with complex multi-step reasoning tasks due to their inability to capture fine-grained supervision at each step. We propose Step-level Advantage Preference Optimization (Step-APO), which integrates an advantage estimate for step-level preference pairs obtained via MCTS into the DPO. This enables the model to more effectively learn critical intermediate planning steps, thereby further improving its generalization in reasoning tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that our method, trained exclusively on GSM8K and MATH, not only significantly improves performance on GSM8K (+10.5%) and MATH (+6.5%), but also enhances out-of-domain reasoning benchmarks, such as ARC-C (+4.0%), BBH (+1.8%), MMLU-STEM (+2.2%), and MMLU (+0.9%).

### Efficient Diffusion Model for Image Restoration by Residual Shifting
**Authors**: Zongsheng Yue, Jianyi Wang, Chen Change Loy

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T08:30:38Z

**Summary**: While diffusion-based image restoration (IR) methods have achieved remarkable success, they are still limited by the low inference speed attributed to the necessity of executing hundreds or even thousands of sampling steps. Existing acceleration sampling techniques, though seeking to expedite the process, inevitably sacrifice performance to some extent, resulting in over-blurry restored outcomes. To address this issue, this study proposes a novel and efficient diffusion model for IR that significantly reduces the required number of diffusion steps. Our method avoids the need for post-acceleration during inference, thereby avoiding the associated performance deterioration. Specifically, our proposed method establishes a Markov chain that facilitates the transitions between the high-quality and low-quality images by shifting their residuals, substantially improving the transition efficiency. A carefully formulated noise schedule is devised to flexibly control the shifting speed and the noise strength during the diffusion process. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior or comparable performance to current state-of-the-art methods on three classical IR tasks, namely image super-resolution, image inpainting, and blind face restoration, \textit{\textbf{even only with four sampling steps}}. Our code and model are publicly available at \url{https://github.com/zsyOAOA/ResShift}.

### Policy Prototyping for LLMs: Pluralistic Alignment via Interactive and   Collaborative Policymaking
**Authors**: K. J. Kevin Feng, Inyoung Cheong, Quan Ze Chen, Amy X. Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T08:19:52Z

**Summary**: Emerging efforts in AI alignment seek to broaden participation in shaping model behavior by eliciting and integrating collective input into a policy for model finetuning. While pluralistic, these processes are often linear and do not allow participating stakeholders to confirm whether potential outcomes of their contributions are indeed consistent with their intentions. Design prototyping has long advocated for rapid iteration using tight feedback loops of ideation, experimentation, and evaluation to mitigate these issues. We thus propose policy prototyping for LLMs, a new process that draws inspiration from prototyping practices to enable stakeholders to collaboratively and interactively draft LLM policies. Through learnings from a real-world LLM policymaking initiative at an industrial AI lab, we motivate our approach and characterize policy prototyping with four guiding principles. Because policy prototyping emphasizes a contrasting set of priorities compared to previous approaches, we envision our approach to be a valuable addition to the methodological repertoire for pluralistic alignment.

**Authors**: Ishaan Domkundwar, Mukunda N S, Ishaan Bhola

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T08:14:36Z

**Summary**: AI agents, specifically powered by large language models, have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in various applications where precision and efficacy are necessary. However, these agents come with inherent risks, including the potential for unsafe or biased actions, vulnerability to adversarial attacks, lack of transparency, and tendency to generate hallucinations. As AI agents become more prevalent in critical sectors of the industry, the implementation of effective safety protocols becomes increasingly important. This paper addresses the critical need for safety measures in AI systems, especially ones that collaborate with human teams. We propose and evaluate three frameworks to enhance safety protocols in AI agent systems: an LLM-powered input-output filter, a safety agent integrated within the system, and a hierarchical delegation-based system with embedded safety checks. Our methodology involves implementing these frameworks and testing them against a set of unsafe agentic use cases, providing a comprehensive evaluation of their effectiveness in mitigating risks associated with AI agent deployment. We conclude that these frameworks can significantly strengthen the safety and security of AI agent systems, minimizing potential harmful actions or outputs. Our work contributes to the ongoing effort to create safe and reliable AI applications, particularly in automated operations, and provides a foundation for developing robust guardrails to ensure the responsible use of AI agents in real-world applications.

### CodeJudge-Eval: Can Large Language Models be Good Judges in Code   Understanding?
**Authors**: Yuwei Zhao, Ziyang Luo, Yuchen Tian, Hongzhan Lin, Weixiang Yan, Annan Li, Jing Ma

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T08:09:50Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have showcased impressive code generation capabilities, primarily evaluated through language-to-code benchmarks. However, these benchmarks may not fully capture a model's code understanding abilities. We introduce CodeJudge-Eval (CJ-Eval), a novel benchmark designed to assess LLMs' code understanding abilities from the perspective of code judging rather than code generation. CJ-Eval challenges models to determine the correctness of provided code solutions, encompassing various error types and compilation issues. By leveraging a diverse set of problems and a fine-grained judging system, CJ-Eval addresses the limitations of traditional benchmarks, including the potential memorization of solutions. Evaluation of 12 well-known LLMs on CJ-Eval reveals that even state-of-the-art models struggle, highlighting the benchmark's ability to probe deeper into models' code understanding abilities. Our codes and benchmark are available at \url{https://github.com/CodeLLM-Research/CodeJudge-Eval}.

### CITADEL: Context Similarity Based Deep Learning Framework Bug Finding
**Authors**: Xiaoyu Zhang, Juan Zhai, Shiqing Ma, Shiwei Wang, Chao Shen

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T07:51:57Z

**Summary**: With deep learning (DL) technology becoming an integral part of the new intelligent software, tools of DL framework testing and bug-finding are in high demand. Existing DL framework testing tools have limited coverage on bug types. For example, they lack the capability of finding performance bugs, which are critical for DL model training and inference regarding performance, economics, and the environment. This problem is challenging due to the difficulty of getting test oracles of performance bugs. Moreover, existing tools are inefficient, generating hundreds of test cases with few trigger bugs. In this paper, we propose Citadel, a method that accelerates the finding of bugs in terms of efficiency and effectiveness. We observe that many DL framework bugs are similar due to the similarity of operators and algorithms belonging to the same family (e.g., Conv2D and Conv3D). Orthogonal to existing bug-finding tools, Citadel aims to find new bugs that are similar to reported ones that have known test oracles. It works by first collecting existing bug reports and identifying problematic APIs. Citadel defines context similarity to measure the similarity of DL framework API pairs and automatically generates test cases with oracles for APIs that are similar to the problematic APIs in existing bug reports. Citadel respectively covers 1,436 PyTorch and 5,380 TensorFlow APIs and effectively detects 77 and 74 API bugs, many of which, e.g., 11 performance bugs, cannot be detected by existing tools. Moreover, a remarkable 35.40% of the test cases generated by Citadel can trigger bugs, which significantly transcends the state-of-the-art method (3.90%).

### Spatial and Temporal Hierarchy for Autonomous Navigation using Active   Inference in Minigrid Environment
**Authors**: Daria de Tinguy, Toon van de Maele, Tim Verbelen, Bart Dhoedt

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T07:42:59Z

**Summary**: Robust evidence suggests that humans explore their environment using a combination of topological landmarks and coarse-grained path integration. This approach relies on identifiable environmental features (topological landmarks) in tandem with estimations of distance and direction (coarse-grained path integration) to construct cognitive maps of the surroundings. This cognitive map is believed to exhibit a hierarchical structure, allowing efficient planning when solving complex navigation tasks. Inspired by human behaviour, this paper presents a scalable hierarchical active inference model for autonomous navigation, exploration, and goal-oriented behaviour. The model uses visual observation and motion perception to combine curiosity-driven exploration with goal-oriented behaviour. Motion is planned using different levels of reasoning, i.e., from context to place to motion. This allows for efficient navigation in new spaces and rapid progress toward a target. By incorporating these human navigational strategies and their hierarchical representation of the environment, this model proposes a new solution for autonomous navigation and exploration. The approach is validated through simulations in a mini-grid environment.

**Authors**: Shaojun Li, Hengchao Shang, Daimeng Wei, Jiaxin Guo, Zongyao Li, Xianghui He, Min Zhang, Hao Yang

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T07:28:47Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in integrating speech information into large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved automatic speech recognition (ASR) accuracy. However, existing methods often constrained by the capabilities of the speech encoders under varied acoustic conditions, such as accents. To address this, we propose LA-RAG, a novel Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) paradigm for LLM-based ASR. LA-RAG leverages fine-grained token-level speech datastores and a speech-to-speech retrieval mechanism to enhance ASR accuracy via LLM in-context learning (ICL) capabilities. Experiments on Mandarin and various Chinese dialect datasets demonstrate significant improvements in ASR accuracy compared to existing methods, validating the effectiveness of our approach, especially in handling accent variations.

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T07:28:28Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized various domains, bringing significant progress and new opportunities. Despite progress in speech-related tasks, LLMs have not been sufficiently explored in multi-talker scenarios. In this work, we present a pioneering effort to investigate the capability of LLMs in transcribing speech in multi-talker environments, following versatile instructions related to multi-talker automatic speech recognition (ASR), target talker ASR, and ASR based on specific talker attributes such as sex, occurrence order, language, and keyword spoken. Our approach utilizes WavLM and Whisper encoder to extract multi-faceted speech representations that are sensitive to speaker characteristics and semantic context. These representations are then fed into an LLM fine-tuned using LoRA, enabling the capabilities for speech comprehension and transcription. Comprehensive experiments reveal the promising performance of our proposed system, MT-LLM, in cocktail party scenarios, highlighting the potential of LLM to handle speech-related tasks based on user instructions in such complex settings.

### GraphCoder: Enhancing Repository-Level Code Completion via Code Context   Graph-based Retrieval and Language Model
**Authors**: Wei Liu, Ailun Yu, Daoguang Zan, Bo Shen, Wei Zhang, Haiyan Zhao, Zhi Jin, Qianxiang Wang

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T07:19:16Z

**Summary**: The performance of repository-level code completion depends upon the effective leverage of both general and repository-specific knowledge. Despite the impressive capability of code LLMs in general code completion tasks, they often exhibit less satisfactory performance on repository-level completion due to the lack of repository-specific knowledge in these LLMs. To address this problem, we propose GraphCoder, a retrieval-augmented code completion framework that leverages LLMs' general code knowledge and the repository-specific knowledge via a graph-based retrieval-generation process. In particular, GraphCoder captures the context of completion target more accurately through code context graph (CCG) that consists of control-flow, data- and control-dependence between code statements, a more structured way to capture the completion target context than the sequence-based context used in existing retrieval-augmented approaches; based on CCG, GraphCoder further employs a coarse-to-fine retrieval process to locate context-similar code snippets with the completion target from the current repository. Experimental results demonstrate both the effectiveness and efficiency of GraphCoder: Compared to baseline retrieval-augmented methods, GraphCoder achieves higher exact match (EM) on average, with increases of +6.06 in code match and +6.23 in identifier match, while using less time and space.

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T07:02:36Z

**Summary**: Singing Voice Conversion (SVC) has emerged as a significant subfield of Voice Conversion (VC), enabling the transformation of one singer's voice into another while preserving musical elements such as melody, rhythm, and timbre. Traditional SVC methods have limitations in terms of audio quality, data requirements, and computational complexity. In this paper, we propose LHQ-SVC, a lightweight, CPU-compatible model based on the SVC framework and diffusion model, designed to reduce model size and computational demand without sacrificing performance. We incorporate features to improve inference quality, and optimize for CPU execution by using performance tuning tools and parallel computing frameworks. Our experiments demonstrate that LHQ-SVC maintains competitive performance, with significant improvements in processing speed and efficiency across different devices. The results suggest that LHQ-SVC can meet

### Sub-SA: Strengthen In-context Learning via Submodular Selective   Annotation
**Authors**: Jian Qian, Miao Sun, Sifan Zhou, Ziyu Zhao, Ruizhi Hun, Patrick Chiang

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T06:57:01Z

**Summary**: In-context learning (ICL) leverages in-context examples as prompts for the predictions of Large Language Models (LLMs). These prompts play a crucial role in achieving strong performance. However, the selection of suitable prompts from a large pool of labeled examples often entails significant annotation costs. To address this challenge, we propose Sub-SA (Submodular Selective Annotation), a submodule-based selective annotation method. The aim of Sub-SA is to reduce annotation costs while improving the quality of in-context examples and minimizing the time consumption of the selection process. In Sub-SA, we design a submodular function that facilitates effective subset selection for annotation and demonstrates the characteristics of monotonically and submodularity from the theoretical perspective. Specifically, we propose RPR (Reward and Penalty Regularization) to better balance the diversity and representativeness of the unlabeled dataset attributed to a reward term and a penalty term, respectively. Consequently, the selection for annotations can be effectively addressed with a simple yet effective greedy search algorithm based on the submodular function. Finally, we apply the similarity prompt retrieval to get the examples for ICL.

### Cracking the Code: Multi-domain LLM Evaluation on Real-World   Professional Exams in Indonesia
**Authors**: Fajri Koto

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T06:34:15Z

**Summary**: While knowledge evaluation in large language models has predominantly focused on academic subjects like math and physics, these assessments often fail to capture the practical demands of real-world professions. In this paper, we introduce IndoCareer, a dataset comprising 8,834 multiple-choice questions designed to evaluate performance in vocational and professional certification exams across various fields. With a focus on Indonesia, IndoCareer provides rich local contexts, spanning six key sectors: (1) healthcare, (2) insurance and finance, (3) creative and design, (4) tourism and hospitality, (5) education and training, and (6) law. Our comprehensive evaluation of 27 large language models shows that these models struggle particularly in fields with strong local contexts, such as insurance and finance. Additionally, while using the entire dataset, shuffling answer options generally maintains consistent evaluation results across models, but it introduces instability specifically in the insurance and finance sectors.

### Expediting and Elevating Large Language Model Reasoning via Hidden   Chain-of-Thought Decoding
**Authors**: Tianqiao Liu, Zui Chen, Zitao Liu, Mi Tian, Weiqi Luo

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T06:29:20Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in tasks requiring reasoning and multi-step problem-solving through the use of chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. However, generating the full CoT process results in significantly longer output sequences, leading to increased computational costs and latency during inference. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach to compress the CoT process through semantic alignment, enabling more efficient decoding while preserving the benefits of CoT reasoning. Our method introduces an auxiliary CoT model that learns to generate and compress the full thought process into a compact special token representation semantically aligned with the original CoT output. This compressed representation is then integrated into the input of the Hidden Chain-of-Thought (HCoT) model. The training process follows a two-stage procedure: First, the CoT model is optimized to generate the compressed token representations aligned with the ground-truth CoT outputs using a contrastive loss. Subsequently, with the CoT model parameters frozen, the HCoT model is fine-tuned to generate accurate subsequent predictions conditioned on the prefix instruction and the compressed CoT representations from the CoT model. Extensive experiments across three challenging domains - mathematical reasoning, agent invocation, and question answering - demonstrate that our semantic compression approach achieves competitive or improved performance compared to the full CoT baseline, while providing significant speedups of at least 1.5x in decoding time. Moreover, incorporating contrastive learning objectives further enhances the quality of the compressed representations, leading to better CoT prompting and improved task accuracy. Our work paves the way for more efficient exploitation of multi-step reasoning capabilities in LLMs across a wide range of applications.

### LLM-Powered Grapheme-to-Phoneme Conversion: Benchmark and Case Study
**Authors**: Mahta Fetrat Qharabagh, Zahra Dehghanian, Hamid R. Rabiee

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T06:13:55Z

**Summary**: Grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) conversion is critical in speech processing, particularly for applications like speech synthesis. G2P systems must possess linguistic understanding and contextual awareness of languages with polyphone words and context-dependent phonemes. Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated significant potential in various language tasks, suggesting that their phonetic knowledge could be leveraged for G2P. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of LLMs in G2P conversion and introduce prompting and post-processing methods that enhance LLM outputs without additional training or labeled data. We also present a benchmarking dataset designed to assess G2P performance on sentence-level phonetic challenges of the Persian language. Our results show that by applying the proposed methods, LLMs can outperform traditional G2P tools, even in an underrepresented language like Persian, highlighting the potential of developing LLM-aided G2P systems.

### Think Twice Before You Act: Improving Inverse Problem Solving With MCMC
**Authors**: Yaxuan Zhu, Zehao Dou, Haoxin Zheng, Yasi Zhang, Ying Nian Wu, Ruiqi Gao

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T06:10:54Z

**Summary**: Recent studies demonstrate that diffusion models can serve as a strong prior for solving inverse problems. A prominent example is Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS), which approximates the posterior distribution of data given the measure using Tweedie's formula. Despite the merits of being versatile in solving various inverse problems without re-training, the performance of DPS is hindered by the fact that this posterior approximation can be inaccurate especially for high noise levels. Therefore, we propose \textbf{D}iffusion \textbf{P}osterior \textbf{MC}MC (\textbf{DPMC}), a novel inference algorithm based on Annealed MCMC to solve inverse problems with pretrained diffusion models. We define a series of intermediate distributions inspired by the approximated conditional distributions used by DPS. Through annealed MCMC sampling, we encourage the samples to follow each intermediate distribution more closely before moving to the next distribution at a lower noise level, and therefore reduce the accumulated error along the path. We test our algorithm in various inverse problems, including super resolution, Gaussian deblurring, motion deblurring, inpainting, and phase retrieval. Our algorithm outperforms DPS with less number of evaluations across nearly all tasks, and is competitive among existing approaches.

### Diffusion-based Speech Enhancement with Schrödinger Bridge and   Symmetric Noise Schedule
**Authors**: Siyi Wang, Siyi Liu, Andrew Harper, Paul Kendrick, Mathieu Salzmann, Milos Cernak

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T06:00:03Z

**Summary**: Recently, diffusion-based generative models have demonstrated remarkable performance in speech enhancement tasks. However, these methods still encounter challenges, including the lack of structural information and poor performance in low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) scenarios. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Schr\"oodinger Bridge-based Speech Enhancement (SBSE) method, which learns the diffusion processes directly between the noisy input and the clean distribution, unlike conventional diffusion-based speech enhancement systems that learn data to Gaussian distributions. To enhance performance in extremely noisy conditions, we introduce a two-stage system incorporating ratio mask information into the diffusion-based generative model. Our experimental results show that our proposed SBSE method outperforms all the baseline models and achieves state-of-the-art performance, especially in low SNR conditions. Importantly, only a few inference steps are required to achieve the best result.

### DOCE: Finding the Sweet Spot for Execution-Based Code Generation
**Authors**: Haau-Sing Li, Patrick Fernandes, Iryna Gurevych, André F. T. Martins

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T05:50:11Z

**Summary**: Recently, a diverse set of decoding and reranking procedures have been shown effective for LLM-based code generation. However, a comprehensive framework that links and experimentally compares these methods is missing. We address this by proposing Decoding Objectives for Code Execution, a comprehensive framework that includes candidate generation, $n$-best reranking, minimum Bayes risk (MBR) decoding, and self-debugging as the core components. We then study the contributions of these components through execution-based evaluation metrics. Our findings highlight the importance of execution-based methods and the difference gap between execution-based and execution-free methods. Furthermore, we assess the impact of filtering based on trial unit tests, a simple and effective strategy that has been often overlooked in prior works. We also propose self-debugging on multiple candidates, obtaining state-of-the-art performance on reranking for code generation. We expect our framework to provide a solid guideline for future research on code generation.

### CerberusDet: Unified Multi-Dataset Object Detection
**Authors**: Irina Tolstykh, Mikhail Chernyshov, Maksim Kuprashevich

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T05:43:14Z

**Summary**: Conventional object detection models are usually limited by the data on which they were trained and by the category logic they define. With the recent rise of Language-Visual Models, new methods have emerged that are not restricted to these fixed categories. Despite their flexibility, such Open Vocabulary detection models still fall short in accuracy compared to traditional models with fixed classes. At the same time, more accurate data-specific models face challenges when there is a need to extend classes or merge different datasets for training. The latter often cannot be combined due to different logics or conflicting class definitions, making it difficult to improve a model without compromising its performance. In this paper, we introduce CerberusDet, a framework with a multi-headed model designed for handling multiple object detection tasks. Proposed model is built on the YOLO architecture and efficiently shares visual features from both backbone and neck components, while maintaining separate task heads. This approach allows CerberusDet to perform very efficiently while still delivering optimal results. We evaluated the model on the PASCAL VOC dataset and Objects365 dataset to demonstrate its abilities. CerberusDet achieved state-of-the-art results with 36% less inference time. The more tasks are trained together, the more efficient the proposed model becomes compared to running individual models sequentially. The training and inference code, as well as the model, are available as open-source (https://github.com/ai-forever/CerberusDet).

### Causal GNNs: A GNN-Driven Instrumental Variable Approach for Causal   Inference in Networks
**Authors**: Xiaojing Du, Feiyu Yang, Wentao Gao, Xiongren Chen

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T05:39:00Z

**Summary**: As network data applications continue to expand, causal inference within networks has garnered increasing attention. However, hidden confounders complicate the estimation of causal effects. Most methods rely on the strong ignorability assumption, which presumes the absence of hidden confounders-an assumption that is both difficult to validate and often unrealistic in practice. To address this issue, we propose CgNN, a novel approach that leverages network structure as instrumental variables (IVs), combined with graph neural networks (GNNs) and attention mechanisms, to mitigate hidden confounder bias and improve causal effect estimation. By utilizing network structure as IVs, we reduce confounder bias while preserving the correlation with treatment. Our integration of attention mechanisms enhances robustness and improves the identification of important nodes. Validated on two real-world datasets, our results demonstrate that CgNN effectively mitigates hidden confounder bias and offers a robust GNN-driven IV framework for causal inference in complex network data.

**Authors**: Chi-Heng Lin, Shangqian Gao, James Seale Smith, Abhishek Patel, Shikhar Tuli, Yilin Shen, Hongxia Jin, Yen-Chang Hsu

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T05:34:14Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have reshaped the landscape of artificial intelligence by demonstrating exceptional performance across various tasks. However, substantial computational requirements make their deployment challenging on devices with limited resources. Recently, compression methods using low-rank matrix techniques have shown promise, yet these often lead to degraded accuracy or introduce significant overhead in parameters and inference latency. This paper introduces \textbf{Mo}dular \textbf{De}composition (MoDeGPT), a novel structured compression framework that does not need recovery fine-tuning while resolving the above drawbacks. MoDeGPT partitions the Transformer block into modules comprised of matrix pairs and reduces the hidden dimensions via reconstructing the module-level outputs. MoDeGPT is developed based on a theoretical framework that utilizes three well-established matrix decomposition algorithms -- Nystr\"om approximation, CR decomposition, and SVD -- and applies them to our redefined transformer modules. Our comprehensive experiments show MoDeGPT, without backward propagation, matches or surpasses previous structured compression methods that rely on gradient information, and saves 98% of compute costs on compressing a 13B model. On \textsc{Llama}-2/3 and OPT models, MoDeGPT maintains 90-95% zero-shot performance with 25-30% compression rates. Moreover, the compression can be done on a single GPU within a few hours and increases the inference throughput by up to 46%.

### ATFLRec: A Multimodal Recommender System with Audio-Text Fusion and   Low-Rank Adaptation via Instruction-Tuned Large Language Model
**Authors**: Zezheng Qin

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T05:33:09Z

**Summary**: Recommender Systems (RS) play a pivotal role in boosting user satisfaction by providing personalized product suggestions in domains such as e-commerce and entertainment. This study examines the integration of multimodal data text and audio into large language models (LLMs) with the aim of enhancing recommendation performance. Traditional text and audio recommenders encounter limitations such as the cold-start problem, and recent advancements in LLMs, while promising, are computationally expensive. To address these issues, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is introduced, which enhances efficiency without compromising performance. The ATFLRec framework is proposed to integrate audio and text modalities into a multimodal recommendation system, utilizing various LoRA configurations and modality fusion techniques. Results indicate that ATFLRec outperforms baseline models, including traditional and graph neural network-based approaches, achieving higher AUC scores. Furthermore, separate fine-tuning of audio and text data with distinct LoRA modules yields optimal performance, with different pooling methods and Mel filter bank numbers significantly impacting performance. This research offers valuable insights into optimizing multimodal recommender systems and advancing the integration of diverse data modalities in LLMs.

### h4rm3l: A Dynamic Benchmark of Composable Jailbreak Attacks for LLM   Safety Assessment
**Authors**: Moussa Koulako Bala Doumbouya, Ananjan Nandi, Gabriel Poesia, Davide Ghilardi, Anna Goldie, Federico Bianchi, Dan Jurafsky, Christopher D. Manning

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T05:19:32Z

**Summary**: The safety of Large Language Models (LLMs) remains a critical concern due to a lack of adequate benchmarks for systematically evaluating their ability to resist generating harmful content. Previous efforts towards automated red teaming involve static or templated sets of illicit requests and adversarial prompts which have limited utility given jailbreak attacks' evolving and composable nature. We propose a novel dynamic benchmark of composable jailbreak attacks to move beyond static datasets and taxonomies of attacks and harms. Our approach consists of three components collectively called h4rm3l: (1) a domain-specific language that formally expresses jailbreak attacks as compositions of parameterized prompt transformation primitives, (2) bandit-based few-shot program synthesis algorithms that generate novel attacks optimized to penetrate the safety filters of a target black box LLM, and (3) open-source automated red-teaming software employing the previous two components. We use h4rm3l to generate a dataset of 2656 successful novel jailbreak attacks targeting 6 state-of-the-art (SOTA) open-source and proprietary LLMs. Several of our synthesized attacks are more effective than previously reported ones, with Attack Success Rates exceeding 90% on SOTA closed language models such as claude-3-haiku and GPT4-o. By generating datasets of jailbreak attacks in a unified formal representation, h4rm3l enables reproducible benchmarking and automated red-teaming, contributes to understanding LLM safety limitations, and supports the development of robust defenses in an increasingly LLM-integrated world.   Warning: This paper and related research artifacts contain offensive and potentially disturbing prompts and model-generated content.

### RT-Surv: Improving Mortality Prediction After Radiotherapy with Large   Language Model Structuring of Large-Scale Unstructured Electronic Health   Records
**Authors**: Sangjoon Park, Chan Woo Wee, Seo Hee Choi, Kyung Hwan Kim, Jee Suk Chang, Hong In Yoon, Ik Jae Lee, Yong Bae Kim, Jaeho Cho, Ki Chang Keum, Chang Geol Lee, Hwa Kyung Byun, Woong Sub Koom

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T05:12:52Z

**Summary**: Accurate patient selection is critical in radiotherapy (RT) to prevent ineffective treatments. Traditional survival prediction models, relying on structured data, often lack precision. This study explores the potential of large language models (LLMs) to structure unstructured electronic health record (EHR) data, thereby improving survival prediction accuracy through comprehensive clinical information integration. Data from 34,276 patients treated with RT at Yonsei Cancer Center between 2013 and 2023 were analyzed, encompassing both structured and unstructured data. An open-source LLM was used to structure the unstructured EHR data via single-shot learning, with its performance compared against a domain-specific medical LLM and a smaller variant. Survival prediction models were developed using statistical, machine learning, and deep learning approaches, incorporating both structured and LLM-structured data. Clinical experts evaluated the accuracy of the LLM-structured data. The open-source LLM achieved 87.5% accuracy in structuring unstructured EHR data without additional training, significantly outperforming the domain-specific medical LLM, which reached only 35.8% accuracy. Larger LLMs were more effective, particularly in extracting clinically relevant features like general condition and disease extent, which closely correlated with patient survival. Incorporating LLM-structured clinical features into survival prediction models significantly improved accuracy, with the C-index of deep learning models increasing from 0.737 to 0.820. These models also became more interpretable by emphasizing clinically significant factors. This study shows that general-domain LLMs, even without specific medical training, can effectively structure large-scale unstructured EHR data, substantially enhancing the accuracy and interpretability of clinical predictive models.

### Confidential Computing on nVIDIA H100 GPU: A Performance Benchmark Study
**Authors**: Jianwei Zhu, Hang Yin, Peng Deng, Shunfan Zhou

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T04:54:28Z

**Summary**: This report evaluates the performance impact of enabling Trusted Execution Environments (TEE) on nVIDIA H100 GPUs for large language model (LLM) inference tasks. We benchmark the overhead introduced by TEE mode across various LLMs and token lengths, with a particular focus on the bottleneck caused by CPU-GPU data transfers via PCIe. Our results indicate that while there is minimal computational overhead within the GPU, the overall performance penalty is primarily attributable to data transfer. For the majority of typical LLM queries, the overhead remains below 5%, with larger models and longer sequences experiencing nearly zero overhead.

### A Joint Learning Model with Variational Interaction for Multilingual   Program Translation
**Authors**: Yali Du, Hui Sun, Ming Li

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T04:25:37Z

**Summary**: Programs implemented in various programming languages form the foundation of software applications. To alleviate the burden of program migration and facilitate the development of software systems, automated program translation across languages has garnered significant attention. Previous approaches primarily focus on pairwise translation paradigms, learning translation between pairs of languages using bilingual parallel data. However, parallel data is difficult to collect for some language pairs, and the distribution of program semantics across languages can shift, posing challenges for pairwise program translation. In this paper, we argue that jointly learning a unified model to translate code across multiple programming languages is superior to separately learning from bilingual parallel data. We propose Variational Interaction for Multilingual Program Translation~(VIM-PT), a disentanglement-based generative approach that jointly trains a unified model for multilingual program translation across multiple languages. VIM-PT disentangles code into language-shared and language-specific features, using variational inference and interaction information with a novel lower bound, then achieves program translation through conditional generation. VIM-PT demonstrates four advantages: 1) captures language-shared information more accurately from various implementations and improves the quality of multilingual program translation, 2) mines and leverages the capability of non-parallel data, 3) addresses the distribution shift of program semantics across languages, 4) and serves as a unified model, reducing deployment complexity.

### STORE: Streamlining Semantic Tokenization and Generative Recommendation   with A Single LLM
**Authors**: Qijiong Liu, Jieming Zhu, Lu Fan, Zhou Zhao, Xiao-Ming Wu

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T04:16:55Z

**Summary**: Traditional recommendation models often rely on unique item identifiers (IDs) to distinguish between items, which can hinder their ability to effectively leverage item content information and generalize to long-tail or cold-start items. Recently, semantic tokenization has been proposed as a promising solution that aims to tokenize each item's semantic representation into a sequence of discrete tokens. In this way, it preserves the item's semantics within these tokens and ensures that semantically similar items are represented by similar tokens. These semantic tokens have become fundamental in training generative recommendation models. However, existing generative recommendation methods typically involve multiple sub-models for embedding, quantization, and recommendation, leading to an overly complex system. In this paper, we propose to streamline the semantic tokenization and generative recommendation process with a unified framework, dubbed STORE, which leverages a single large language model (LLM) for both tasks. Specifically, we formulate semantic tokenization as a text-to-token task and generative recommendation as a token-to-token task, supplemented by a token-to-text reconstruction task and a text-to-token auxiliary task. All these tasks are framed in a generative manner and trained using a single LLM backbone. Extensive experiments have been conducted to validate the effectiveness of our STORE framework across various recommendation tasks and datasets. We will release the source code and configurations for reproducible research.

**Authors**: Yutthakorn Thiprak, Rungtam Ngodngamthaweesuk, Songtam Ngodngamtaweesuk

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T04:06:00Z

**Summary**: We present Eir Thai Medical LLM, a large language model with 8 billion parameters, specifically designed to enhance the accuracy of handling medical tasks in the Thai language. This model focuses on providing clear and easy-to-understand answers for both healthcare professionals and patients, thereby improving the efficiency of diagnosis and treatment processes. Human evaluation was conducted to ensure that the model adheres to care standards and provides unbiased answers.   To prioritize data security, the model is deployed within the hospital's internal network, ensuring both high security and faster processing speeds. The internal API connection is secured with encryption and strict authentication measures to prevent data leaks and unauthorized access.   We evaluated several open-source large language models with 8 billion parameters on four medical benchmarks: MedQA, MedMCQA, PubMedQA, and the medical subset of MMLU. The best-performing baselines were used to develop Eir Thai Medical LLM. Our evaluation employed multiple questioning strategies, including zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought reasoning, and ensemble/self-consistency voting methods. Our model outperformed commercially available Thai-language large language models by more than 10%. In addition, we developed enhanced model testing tailored for clinical use in Thai across 18 clinical tasks, where our model exceeded GPT-4o performance by more than 11%

### Truth-Aware Context Selection: Mitigating Hallucinations of Large   Language Models Being Misled by Untruthful Contexts
**Authors**: Tian Yu, Shaolei Zhang, Yang Feng

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T03:59:49Z

**Summary**: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive text generation capabilities, they are easily misled by untruthful contexts provided by users or knowledge augmentation tools, leading to hallucinations. To alleviate LLMs from being misled by untruthful context and take advantage of knowledge augmentation, we propose Truth-Aware Context Selection (TACS), a lightweight method to adaptively recognize and mask untruthful context from the inputs. TACS begins by performing truth detection on the input context, leveraging the parameterized knowledge within the LLM. Subsequently, it constructs a corresponding attention mask based on the truthfulness of each position, selecting the truthful context and discarding the untruthful context. Additionally, we introduce a new evaluation metric, Disturbance Adaption Rate, to further study the LLMs' ability to accept truthful information and resist untruthful information. Experimental results indicate that TACS can effectively filter untruthful context and significantly improve the overall quality of LLMs' responses when presented with misleading information.

### Anytime Continual Learning for Open Vocabulary Classification
**Authors**: Zhen Zhu, Yiming Gong, Derek Hoiem

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T03:34:37Z

**Summary**: We propose an approach for anytime continual learning (AnytimeCL) for open vocabulary image classification. The AnytimeCL problem aims to break away from batch training and rigid models by requiring that a system can predict any set of labels at any time and efficiently update and improve when receiving one or more training samples at any time. Despite the challenging goal, we achieve substantial improvements over recent methods. We propose a dynamic weighting between predictions of a partially fine-tuned model and a fixed open vocabulary model that enables continual improvement when training samples are available for a subset of a task's labels. We also propose an attention-weighted PCA compression of training features that reduces storage and computation with little impact to model accuracy. Our methods are validated with experiments that test flexibility of learning and inference. Code is available at https://github.com/jessemelpolio/AnytimeCL.

### The Radius Distribution of M dwarf-hosted Planets and its Evolution
**Authors**: Eric Gaidos, Aleezah Ali, Adam L. Kraus, Jason F. Rowe

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T03:27:51Z

**Summary**: M dwarf stars are the most promising hosts for detection and characterization of small and potentially habitable planets, and provide leverage relative to solar-type stars to test models of planet formation and evolution. Using \emph{Gaia} astrometry, adaptive optics imaging, and calibrated gyrochronologic relations to estimate stellar properties and filter binaries we refined the radii of 117 Kepler Objects of Interest (confirmed or candidate planets) transiting 74 single late K- and early M-type stars, and assigned stellar rotation-based ages to 113 of these. We constructed the radius distribution of 115 small ($<4R_{\oplus}$) planets and assessed its evolution. As for solar-type stars, the inferred distribution contains distinct populations of "super-Earths" (at $\approx$1.3$_{\oplus}$) and "sub-Neptunes" (at $\approx$2.2$R_{\oplus}$) separated by a gap or "valley" at $\approx$1.7$_{\oplus}$ that has a period dependence that is significantly weaker (power law index of -0.03$^{+0.01}_{-0.03}$) than for solar-type stars. Sub-Neptunes are largely absent at short periods ($<$2 days) and high irradiance, a feature analogous to the "Neptune desert" observed around solar-type stars. The relative number of sub-Neptunes to super-Earths declines between the younger and older halves of the sample (median age 3.86 Gyr), although the formal significance is low ($p = 0.08$) because of the small sample size. The decline in sub-Neptunes appears to be more pronounced on wider orbits and low stellar irradiance. This is not due to detection bias and suggests a role for H$_2$O as steam in inflating the radii of sub-Neptunes and/or regulating the escape of H/He from them.

### Privacy risk in GeoData: A survey
**Authors**: Mahrokh Abdollahi Lorestani, Thilina Ranbaduge, Thierry Rakotoarivelo

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T03:16:40Z

**Summary**: With the ubiquitous use of location-based services, large-scale individual-level location data has been widely collected through location-awareness devices. The widespread exposure of such location data poses significant privacy risks to users, as it can lead to re-identification, the inference of sensitive information, and even physical threats. In this survey, we analyse different geomasking techniques proposed to protect individuals' privacy in geodata. We propose a taxonomy to characterise these techniques across various dimensions. We then highlight the shortcomings of current techniques and discuss avenues for future research. Our proposed taxonomy serves as a practical resource for data custodians, offering them a means to navigate the extensive array of existing privacy mechanisms and to identify those that align most effectively with their specific requirements.

### LLM-Enhanced Software Patch Localization
**Authors**: Jinhong Yu, Yi Chen, Di Tang, Xiaozhong Liu, XiaoFeng Wang, Chen Wu, Haixu Tang

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T03:12:52Z

**Summary**: Open source software (OSS) is integral to modern product development, and any vulnerability within it potentially compromises numerous products. While developers strive to apply security patches, pinpointing these patches among extensive OSS updates remains a challenge. Security patch localization (SPL) recommendation methods are leading approaches to address this. However, existing SPL models often falter when a commit lacks a clear association with its corresponding CVE, and do not consider a scenario that a vulnerability has multiple patches proposed over time before it has been fully resolved. To address these challenges, we introduce LLM-SPL, a recommendation-based SPL approach that leverages the capabilities of the Large Language Model (LLM) to locate the security patch commit for a given CVE. More specifically, we propose a joint learning framework, in which the outputs of LLM serves as additional features to aid our recommendation model in prioritizing security patches. Our evaluation on a dataset of 1,915 CVEs associated with 2,461 patches demonstrates that LLM-SPL excels in ranking patch commits, surpassing the state-of-the-art method in terms of Recall, while significantly reducing manual effort. Notably, for vulnerabilities requiring multiple patches, LLM-SPL significantly improves Recall by 22.83\%, NDCG by 19.41\%, and reduces manual effort by over 25\% when checking up to the top 10 rankings. The dataset and source code are available at \url{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LLM-SPL-91F8}.

### Patch-Level Training for Large Language Models
**Authors**: Chenze Shao, Fandong Meng, Jie Zhou

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T03:07:37Z

**Summary**: As Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve remarkable progress in language understanding and generation, their training efficiency has become a critical concern. Traditionally, LLMs are trained to predict the next token in a sequence. Despite the success of token-level training, it suffers from considerable computational costs due to the need to process an extensive number of tokens. To mitigate this issue, this paper introduces patch-level training for LLMs, which reduces the sequence length by compressing multiple tokens into a single patch. During patch-level training, we feed the language model shorter sequences of patches and train it to predict the next patch, thereby processing the majority of the training data at a significantly reduced computational cost. Following this, the model continues token-level training on the remaining training data to align with the inference mode. Experiments on a diverse range of models (370M-2.7B parameters) demonstrate that patch-level training can reduce overall computational costs to 0.5$\times$, without compromising the model performance compared to token-level training.

### Discovery of Two Ultra-Diffuse Galaxies with Unusually Bright Globular   Cluster Luminosity Functions via a Mark-Dependently Thinned Point Process   (MATHPOP)
**Authors**: Dayi Li, Gwendolyn Eadie, Patrick Brown, William Harris, Roberto Abraham, Pieter van Dokkum, Steven Janssens, Samantha Berek, Shany Danieli, Aaron Romanowsky, Joshua Speagle

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T03:06:32Z

**Summary**: We present \textsc{Mathpop}, a novel method to infer the globular cluster (GC) counts in ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) and low-surface brightness galaxies (LSBGs). Many known UDGs have a surprisingly high ratio of GC number to surface brightness. However, standard methods to infer GC counts in UDGs face various challenges, such as photometric measurement uncertainties, GC membership uncertainties, and assumptions about the GC luminosity functions (GCLFs). \textsc{Mathpop} tackles these challenges using the mark-dependent thinned point process, enabling joint inference of the spatial and magnitude distributions of GCs. In doing so, \textsc{Mathpop} allows us to infer and quantify the uncertainties in both GC counts and GCLFs with minimal assumptions. As a precursor to \textsc{Mathpop}, we also address the data uncertainties coming from the selection process of GC candidates: we obtain probabilistic GC candidates instead of the traditional binary classification based on the color--magnitude diagram. We apply \textsc{Mathpop} to 40 LSBGs in the Perseus cluster using GC catalogs from a \textit{Hubble Space Telescope} imaging program. We then compare our results to those from an independent study using the standard method. We further calibrate and validate our approach through extensive simulations. Our approach reveals two LSBGs having GCLF turnover points much brighter than the canonical value with Bayes' factor being $\sim4.5$ and $\sim2.5$, respectively. An additional crude maximum-likelihood estimation shows that their GCLF TO points are approximately $0.9$~mag and $1.1$~mag brighter than the canonical value, with $p$-value $\sim 10^{-8}$ and $\sim 10^{-5}$, respectively.

### ComGPT: Detecting Local Community Structure with Large Language Models
**Authors**: Li Ni, Haowen Shen, Lin Mu, Yiwen Zhang, Wenjian Luo

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T02:59:36Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs), like GPT, have demonstrated the ability to understand graph structures and have achieved excellent performance in various graph reasoning tasks, such as node classification. Despite their strong abilities in graph reasoning tasks, they lack specific domain knowledge and have a weaker understanding of community-related graph information, which hinders their capabilities in the community detection task. Moreover, local community detection algorithms based on seed expansion, referred to as seed expansion algorithms, often face the seed-dependent problem, community diffusion, and free rider effect. To use LLMs to overcome the above shortcomings, we explore a GPT-guided seed expansion algorithm named ComGPT. ComGPT iteratively selects potential nodes by local modularity M from the detected community's neighbors, and subsequently employs LLMs to choose the node to join the detected community from these selected potential nodes. To address the above issues faced by LLMs, we improve graph encoding method, called Incident, by incorporating community knowledge to improve LLMs's understanding of community-related graph information. Additionally, we design the NSG (Node Selection Guide) prompt to enhance LLMs' understanding of community characteristics. Experimental results demonstrate that ComGPT outperforms the comparison methods, thereby confirming the effectiveness of the improved graph encoding method and prompts.

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T17:55:58Z

**Summary**: In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success and have been widely used in various downstream tasks, especially in the tasks of the software engineering (SE) field. We find that many studies combining LLMs with SE have employed the concept of agents either explicitly or implicitly. However, there is a lack of an in-depth survey to sort out the development context of existing works, analyze how existing works combine the LLM-based agent technologies to optimize various tasks, and clarify the framework of LLM-based agents in SE. In this paper, we conduct the first survey of the studies on combining LLM-based agents with SE and present a framework of LLM-based agents in SE which includes three key modules: perception, memory, and action. We also summarize the current challenges in combining the two fields and propose future opportunities in response to existing challenges.

### An Efficient and Streaming Audio Visual Active Speaker Detection System
**Authors**: Arnav Kundu, Yanzi Jin, Mohammad Sekhavat, Max Horton, Danny Tormoen, Devang Naik

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T17:45:53Z

**Summary**: This paper delves into the challenging task of Active Speaker Detection (ASD), where the system needs to determine in real-time whether a person is speaking or not in a series of video frames. While previous works have made significant strides in improving network architectures and learning effective representations for ASD, a critical gap exists in the exploration of real-time system deployment. Existing models often suffer from high latency and memory usage, rendering them impractical for immediate applications. To bridge this gap, we present two scenarios that address the key challenges posed by real-time constraints. First, we introduce a method to limit the number of future context frames utilized by the ASD model. By doing so, we alleviate the need for processing the entire sequence of future frames before a decision is made, significantly reducing latency. Second, we propose a more stringent constraint that limits the total number of past frames the model can access during inference. This tackles the persistent memory issues associated with running streaming ASD systems. Beyond these theoretical frameworks, we conduct extensive experiments to validate our approach. Our results demonstrate that constrained transformer models can achieve performance comparable to or even better than state-of-the-art recurrent models, such as uni-directional GRUs, with a significantly reduced number of context frames. Moreover, we shed light on the temporal memory requirements of ASD systems, revealing that larger past context has a more profound impact on accuracy than future context. When profiling on a CPU we find that our efficient architecture is memory bound by the amount of past context it can use and that the compute cost is negligible as compared to the memory cost.

### AI-LieDar: Examine the Trade-off Between Utility and Truthfulness in LLM   Agents
**Authors**: Zhe Su, Xuhui Zhou, Sanketh Rangreji, Anubha Kabra, Julia Mendelsohn, Faeze Brahman, Maarten Sap

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T17:41:12Z

**Summary**: To be safely and successfully deployed, LLMs must simultaneously satisfy truthfulness and utility goals. Yet, often these two goals compete (e.g., an AI agent assisting a used car salesman selling a car with flaws), partly due to ambiguous or misleading user instructions. We propose AI-LieDar, a framework to study how LLM-based agents navigate scenarios with utility-truthfulness conflicts in a multi-turn interactive setting. We design a set of realistic scenarios where language agents are instructed to achieve goals that are in conflict with being truthful during a multi-turn conversation with simulated human agents. To evaluate the truthfulness at large scale, we develop a truthfulness detector inspired by psychological literature to assess the agents' responses. Our experiment demonstrates that all models are truthful less than 50% of the time, although truthfulness and goal achievement (utility) rates vary across models. We further test the steerability of LLMs towards truthfulness, finding that models follow malicious instructions to deceive, and even truth-steered models can still lie. These findings reveal the complex nature of truthfulness in LLMs and underscore the importance of further research to ensure the safe and reliable deployment of LLMs and AI agents.

### Contri(e)ve: Context + Retrieve for Scholarly Question Answering
**Authors**: Kanchan Shivashankar, Nadine Steinmetz

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T17:38:47Z

**Summary**: Scholarly communication is a rapid growing field containing a wealth of knowledge. However, due to its unstructured and document format, it is challenging to extract useful information from them through conventional document retrieval methods. Scholarly knowledge graphs solve this problem, by representing the documents in a semantic network, providing, hidden insights, summaries and ease of accessibility through queries. Naturally, question answering for scholarly graphs expands the accessibility to a wider audience. But some of the knowledge in this domain is still presented as unstructured text, thus requiring a hybrid solution for question answering systems. In this paper, we present a two step solution using open source Large Language Model(LLM): Llama3.1 for Scholarly-QALD dataset. Firstly, we extract the context pertaining to the question from different structured and unstructured data sources: DBLP, SemOpenAlex knowledge graphs and Wikipedia text. Secondly, we implement prompt engineering to improve the information retrieval performance of the LLM. Our approach achieved an F1 score of 40% and also observed some anomalous responses from the LLM, that are discussed in the final part of the paper.

### Modeling Rational Adaptation of Visual Search to Hierarchical Structures
**Authors**: Saku Sourulahti, Christian P Janssen, Jussi PP Jokinen

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T16:33:18Z

**Summary**: Efficient attention deployment in visual search is limited by human visual memory, yet this limitation can be offset by exploiting the environment's structure. This paper introduces a computational cognitive model that simulates how the human visual system uses visual hierarchies to prevent refixations in sequential attention deployment. The model adopts computational rationality, positing behaviors as adaptations to cognitive constraints and environmental structures. In contrast to earlier models that predict search performance for hierarchical information, our model does not include predefined assumptions about particular search strategies. Instead, our model's search strategy emerges as a result of adapting to the environment through reinforcement learning algorithms. In an experiment with human participants we test the model's prediction that structured environments reduce visual search times compared to random tasks. Our model's predictions correspond well with human search performance across various set sizes for both structured and unstructured visual layouts. Our work improves understanding of the adaptive nature of visual search in hierarchically structured environments and informs the design of optimized search spaces.

### Safeguarding Decentralized Social Media: LLM Agents for Automating   Community Rule Compliance
**Authors**: Lucio La Cava, Andrea Tagarelli

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T16:29:25Z

**Summary**: Ensuring content compliance with community guidelines is crucial for maintaining healthy online social environments. However, traditional human-based compliance checking struggles with scaling due to the increasing volume of user-generated content and a limited number of moderators. Recent advancements in Natural Language Understanding demonstrated by Large Language Models unlock new opportunities for automated content compliance verification. This work evaluates six AI-agents built on Open-LLMs for automated rule compliance checking in Decentralized Social Networks, a challenging environment due to heterogeneous community scopes and rules. Analyzing over 50,000 posts from hundreds of Mastodon servers, we find that AI-agents effectively detect non-compliant content, grasp linguistic subtleties, and adapt to diverse community contexts. Most agents also show high inter-rater reliability and consistency in score justification and suggestions for compliance. Human-based evaluation with domain experts confirmed the agents' reliability and usefulness, rendering them promising tools for semi-automated or human-in-the-loop content moderation systems.

### Emerging Reliance Behaviors in Human-AI Text Generation: Hallucinations,   Data Quality Assessment, and Cognitive Forcing Functions
**Authors**: Zahra Ashktorab, Qian Pan, Werner Geyer, Michael Desmond, Marina Danilevsky, James M. Johnson, Casey Dugan, Michelle Bachman

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T15:55:59Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we investigate the impact of hallucinations and cognitive forcing functions in human-AI collaborative text generation tasks, focusing on the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist in generating high-quality conversational data. LLMs require data for fine-tuning, a crucial step in enhancing their performance. In the context of conversational customer support, the data takes the form of a conversation between a human customer and an agent and can be generated with an AI assistant. In our inquiry, involving 11 users who each completed 8 tasks, resulting in a total of 88 tasks, we found that the presence of hallucinations negatively impacts the quality of data. We also find that, although the cognitive forcing function does not always mitigate the detrimental effects of hallucinations on data quality, the presence of cognitive forcing functions and hallucinations together impacts data quality and influences how users leverage the AI responses presented to them. Our analysis of user behavior reveals distinct patterns of reliance on AI-generated responses, highlighting the importance of managing hallucinations in AI-generated content within conversational AI contexts.

### LLM-based Weak Supervision Framework for Query Intent Classification in   Video Search
**Authors**: Farnoosh Javadi, Phanideep Gampa, Alyssa Woo, Xingxing Geng, Hang Zhang, Jose Sepulveda, Belhassen Bayar, Fei Wang

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T15:47:50Z

**Summary**: Streaming services have reshaped how we discover and engage with digital entertainment. Despite these advancements, effectively understanding the wide spectrum of user search queries continues to pose a significant challenge. An accurate query understanding system that can handle a variety of entities that represent different user intents is essential for delivering an enhanced user experience. We can build such a system by training a natural language understanding (NLU) model; however, obtaining high-quality labeled training data in this specialized domain is a substantial obstacle. Manual annotation is costly and impractical for capturing users' vast vocabulary variations. To address this, we introduce a novel approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) through weak supervision to automatically annotate a vast collection of user search queries. Using prompt engineering and a diverse set of LLM personas, we generate training data that matches human annotator expectations. By incorporating domain knowledge via Chain of Thought and In-Context Learning, our approach leverages the labeled data to train low-latency models optimized for real-time inference. Extensive evaluations demonstrated that our approach outperformed the baseline with an average relative gain of 113% in recall. Furthermore, our novel prompt engineering framework yields higher quality LLM-generated data to be used for weak supervision; we observed 47.60% improvement over baseline in agreement rate between LLM predictions and human annotations with respect to F1 score, weighted according to the distribution of occurrences of the search queries. Our persona selection routing mechanism further adds an additional 3.67% increase in weighted F1 score on top of our novel prompt engineering framework.

### CoverUp: Coverage-Guided LLM-Based Test Generation
**Authors**: Juan Altmayer Pizzorno, Emery D. Berger

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T15:45:10Z

**Summary**: Testing is an essential part of software development. Test generation tools attempt to automate the otherwise labor-intensive task of test creation, but generating high-coverage tests remains a challenge. This paper proposes CoverUp, a novel approach to driving the generation of high-coverage Python regression tests. CoverUp iteratively improves test coverage, interleaving coverage analysis with dialogs with the LLM that steer it to refine tests so that they increase coverage of lines and branches. We evaluate our prototype CoverUp implementation across a benchmark of challenging code derived from open-source Python projects, and show that CoverUp substantially improves on the state of the art. Compared to CodaMosa, a hybrid search/LLM-based test generator, CoverUp achieves a per-module median line+branch coverage of 80% (vs. 47%). Compared to MuTAP, a mutation/LLM-based test generator, CoverUp achieves an overall line+branch coverage of 90% (vs. 77%). We show that CoverUp's iterative, coverage-guided approach is crucial to its effectiveness, contributing to nearly 40% of its successes.

### AnyBipe: An End-to-End Framework for Training and Deploying Bipedal   Robots Guided by Large Language Models
**Authors**: Yifei Yao, Wentao He, Chenyu Gu, Jiaheng Du, Fuwei Tan, Zhen Zhu, Junguo Lu

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T15:15:45Z

**Summary**: Training and deploying reinforcement learning (RL) policies for robots, especially in accomplishing specific tasks, presents substantial challenges. Recent advancements have explored diverse reward function designs, training techniques, simulation-to-reality (sim-to-real) transfers, and performance analysis methodologies, yet these still require significant human intervention. This paper introduces an end-to-end framework for training and deploying RL policies, guided by Large Language Models (LLMs), and evaluates its effectiveness on bipedal robots. The framework consists of three interconnected modules: an LLM-guided reward function design module, an RL training module leveraging prior work, and a sim-to-real homomorphic evaluation module. This design significantly reduces the need for human input by utilizing only essential simulation and deployment platforms, with the option to incorporate human-engineered strategies and historical data. We detail the construction of these modules, their advantages over traditional approaches, and demonstrate the framework's capability to autonomously develop and refine controlling strategies for bipedal robot locomotion, showcasing its potential to operate independently of human intervention.

### Visual Language Tracking with Multi-modal Interaction: A Robust   Benchmark
**Authors**: Xuchen Li, Shiyu Hu, Xiaokun Feng, Dailing Zhang, Meiqi Wu, Jing Zhang, Kaiqi Huang

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T14:54:37Z

**Summary**: Visual Language Tracking (VLT) enhances tracking by mitigating the limitations of relying solely on the visual modality, utilizing high-level semantic information through language. This integration of the language enables more advanced human-machine interaction. The essence of interaction is cognitive alignment, which typically requires multiple information exchanges, especially in the sequential decision-making process of VLT. However, current VLT benchmarks do not account for multi-round interactions during tracking. They provide only an initial text and bounding box (bbox) in the first frame, with no further interaction as tracking progresses, deviating from the original motivation of the VLT task. To address these limitations, we propose a novel and robust benchmark, VLT-MI (Visual Language Tracking with Multi-modal Interaction), which introduces multi-round interaction into the VLT task for the first time. (1) We generate diverse, multi-granularity texts for multi-round, multi-modal interaction based on existing mainstream VLT benchmarks using DTLLM-VLT, leveraging the world knowledge of LLMs. (2) We propose a new VLT interaction paradigm that achieves multi-round interaction through text updates and object recovery. When multiple tracking failures occur, we provide the tracker with more aligned texts and corrected bboxes through interaction, thereby expanding the scope of VLT downstream tasks. (3) We conduct comparative experiments on both traditional VLT benchmarks and VLT-MI, evaluating and analyzing the accuracy and robustness of trackers under the interactive paradigm. This work offers new insights and paradigms for the VLT task, enabling a fine-grained evaluation of multi-modal trackers. We believe this approach can be extended to additional datasets in the future, supporting broader evaluations and comparisons of video-language model capabilities.

**Authors**: Yuchen Liu, Luigi Palmieri, Sebastian Koch, Ilche Georgievski, Marco Aiello

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T14:42:08Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have sparked a revolution across many research fields. In robotics, the integration of common-sense knowledge from LLMs into task and motion planning has drastically advanced the field by unlocking unprecedented levels of context awareness. Despite their vast collection of knowledge, large language models may generate infeasible plans due to hallucinations or missing domain information. To address these challenges and improve plan feasibility and computational efficiency, we introduce DELTA, a novel LLM-informed task planning approach. By using scene graphs as environment representations within LLMs, DELTA achieves rapid generation of precise planning problem descriptions. To enhance planning performance, DELTA decomposes long-term task goals with LLMs into an autoregressive sequence of sub-goals, enabling automated task planners to efficiently solve complex problems. In our extensive evaluation, we show that DELTA enables an efficient and fully automatic task planning pipeline, achieving higher planning success rates and significantly shorter planning times compared to the state of the art.

### Exploring Graph Structure Comprehension Ability of Multimodal Large   Language Models: Case Studies
**Authors**: Zhiqiang Zhong, Davide Mottin

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T14:26:58Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in processing various data structures, including graphs. While previous research has focused on developing textual encoding methods for graph representation, the emergence of multimodal LLMs presents a new frontier for graph comprehension. These advanced models, capable of processing both text and images, offer potential improvements in graph understanding by incorporating visual representations alongside traditional textual data. This study investigates the impact of graph visualisations on LLM performance across a range of benchmark tasks at node, edge, and graph levels. Our experiments compare the effectiveness of multimodal approaches against purely textual graph representations. The results provide valuable insights into both the potential and limitations of leveraging visual graph modalities to enhance LLMs' graph structure comprehension abilities.

### FP-VEC: Fingerprinting Large Language Models via Efficient Vector   Addition
**Authors**: Zhenhua Xu, Wenpeng Xing, Zhebo Wang, Chang Hu, Chen Jie, Meng Han

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T14:04:39Z

**Summary**: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) requires immense computational power and vast amounts of data. As a result, protecting the intellectual property of these models through fingerprinting is essential for ownership authentication. While adding fingerprints to LLMs through fine-tuning has been attempted, it remains costly and unscalable. In this paper, we introduce FP-VEC, a pilot study on using fingerprint vectors as an efficient fingerprinting method for LLMs. Our approach generates a fingerprint vector that represents a confidential signature embedded in the model, allowing the same fingerprint to be seamlessly incorporated into an unlimited number of LLMs via vector addition. Results on several LLMs show that FP-VEC is lightweight by running on CPU-only devices for fingerprinting, scalable with a single training and unlimited fingerprinting process, and preserves the model's normal behavior. The project page is available at https://fingerprintvector.github.io .

### AIPO: Improving Training Objective for Iterative Preference Optimization
**Authors**: Yaojie Shen, Xinyao Wang, Yulei Niu, Ying Zhou, Lexin Tang, Libo Zhang, Fan Chen, Longyin Wen

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T14:03:49Z

**Summary**: Preference Optimization (PO), is gaining popularity as an alternative choice of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs). Recent research on aligning LLMs iteratively with synthetic or partially synthetic data shows promising results in scaling up PO training for both academic settings and proprietary trained models such as Llama3. Despite its success, our study shows that the length exploitation issue present in PO is even more severe in Iterative Preference Optimization (IPO) due to the iterative nature of the process. In this work, we study iterative preference optimization with synthetic data. We share the findings and analysis along the way of building the iterative preference optimization pipeline. More specifically, we discuss the length exploitation issue during iterative preference optimization and propose our training objective for iterative preference optimization, namely Agreement-aware Iterative Preference Optimization (AIPO). To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we conduct comprehensive experiments and achieve state-of-the-art performance on MT-Bench, AlpacaEval 2.0, and Arena-Hard. Our implementation and model checkpoints will be made available at https://github.com/bytedance/AIPO.

### A RAG Approach for Generating Competency Questions in Ontology   Engineering
**Authors**: Xueli Pan, Jacco van Ossenbruggen, Victor de Boer, Zhisheng Huang

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T13:34:32Z

**Summary**: Competency question (CQ) formulation is central to several ontology development and evaluation methodologies. Traditionally, the task of crafting these competency questions heavily relies on the effort of domain experts and knowledge engineers which is often time-consuming and labor-intensive. With the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs), there arises the possibility to automate and enhance this process. Unlike other similar works which use existing ontologies or knowledge graphs as input to LLMs, we present a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach that uses LLMs for the automatic generation of CQs given a set of scientific papers considered to be a domain knowledge base. We investigate its performance and specifically, we study the impact of different number of papers to the RAG and different temperature setting of the LLM. We conduct experiments using GPT-4 on two domain ontology engineering tasks and compare results against ground-truth CQs constructed by domain experts. Empirical assessments on the results, utilizing evaluation metrics (precision and consistency), reveal that compared to zero-shot prompting, adding relevant domain knowledge to the RAG improves the performance of LLMs on generating CQs for concrete ontology engineering tasks.

### Your Weak LLM is Secretly a Strong Teacher for Alignment
**Authors**: Leitian Tao, Yixuan Li

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T13:24:52Z

**Summary**: The burgeoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have underscored the need for alignment to ensure these models act in accordance with human values and intentions. Existing alignment frameworks present constraints either in the form of expensive human effort or high computational costs. This paper explores a promising middle ground, where we employ a weak LLM that is significantly less resource-intensive than top-tier models, yet offers more automation than purely human feedback. We present a systematic study to evaluate and understand weak LLM's ability to generate feedback for alignment. Our empirical findings demonstrate that weak LLMs can provide feedback that rivals or even exceeds that of fully human-annotated data. Our study indicates a minimized impact of model size on feedback efficacy, shedding light on a scalable and sustainable alignment strategy. To deepen our understanding of alignment under weak LLM feedback, we conduct a series of qualitative and quantitative analyses, offering novel insights into the quality discrepancies between human feedback vs. weak LLM feedback.

### Mutual Theory of Mind in Human-AI Collaboration: An Empirical Study with   LLM-driven AI Agents in a Real-time Shared Workspace Task
**Authors**: Shao Zhang, Xihuai Wang, Wenhao Zhang, Yongshan Chen, Landi Gao, Dakuo Wang, Weinan Zhang, Xinbing Wang, Ying Wen

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T13:19:48Z

**Summary**: Theory of Mind (ToM) significantly impacts human collaboration and communication as a crucial capability to understand others. When AI agents with ToM capability collaborate with humans, Mutual Theory of Mind (MToM) arises in such human-AI teams (HATs). The MToM process, which involves interactive communication and ToM-based strategy adjustment, affects the team's performance and collaboration process. To explore the MToM process, we conducted a mixed-design experiment using a large language model-driven AI agent with ToM and communication modules in a real-time shared-workspace task. We find that the agent's ToM capability does not significantly impact team performance but enhances human understanding of the agent and the feeling of being understood. Most participants in our study believe verbal communication increases human burden, and the results show that bidirectional communication leads to lower HAT performance. We discuss the results' implications for designing AI agents that collaborate with humans in real-time shared workspace tasks.

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T13:09:41Z

**Summary**: Advanced AI assistants combine frontier LLMs and tool access to autonomously perform complex tasks on behalf of users. While the helpfulness of such assistants can increase dramatically with access to user information including emails and documents, this raises privacy concerns about assistants sharing inappropriate information with third parties without user supervision. To steer information-sharing assistants to behave in accordance with privacy expectations, we propose to operationalize contextual integrity (CI), a framework that equates privacy with the appropriate flow of information in a given context. In particular, we design and evaluate a number of strategies to steer assistants' information-sharing actions to be CI compliant. Our evaluation is based on a novel form filling benchmark composed of human annotations of common webform applications, and it reveals that prompting frontier LLMs to perform CI-based reasoning yields strong results.

### LLaQo: Towards a Query-Based Coach in Expressive Music Performance   Assessment
**Authors**: Huan Zhang, Vincent Cheung, Hayato Nishioka, Simon Dixon, Shinichi Furuya

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T12:59:39Z

**Summary**: Research in music understanding has extensively explored composition-level attributes such as key, genre, and instrumentation through advanced representations, leading to cross-modal applications using large language models. However, aspects of musical performance such as stylistic expression and technique remain underexplored, along with the potential of using large language models to enhance educational outcomes with customized feedback. To bridge this gap, we introduce LLaQo, a Large Language Query-based music coach that leverages audio language modeling to provide detailed and formative assessments of music performances. We also introduce instruction-tuned query-response datasets that cover a variety of performance dimensions from pitch accuracy to articulation, as well as contextual performance understanding (such as difficulty and performance techniques). Utilizing AudioMAE encoder and Vicuna-7b LLM backend, our model achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in predicting teachers' performance ratings, as well as in identifying piece difficulty and playing techniques. Textual responses from LLaQo was moreover rated significantly higher compared to other baseline models in a user study using audio-text matching. Our proposed model can thus provide informative answers to open-ended questions related to musical performance from audio data.

### Optimizing Ingredient Substitution Using Large Language Models to   Enhance Phytochemical Content in Recipes
**Authors**: Luis Rita, Josh Southern, Ivan Laponogov, Kyle Higgins, Kirill Veselkov

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T12:55:45Z

**Summary**: In the emerging field of computational gastronomy, aligning culinary practices with scientifically supported nutritional goals is increasingly important. This study explores how large language models (LLMs) can be applied to optimize ingredient substitutions in recipes, specifically to enhance the phytochemical content of meals. Phytochemicals are bioactive compounds found in plants, which, based on preclinical studies, may offer potential health benefits. We fine-tuned models, including OpenAI's GPT-3.5, DaVinci, and Meta's TinyLlama, using an ingredient substitution dataset. These models were used to predict substitutions that enhance phytochemical content and create a corresponding enriched recipe dataset. Our approach improved Hit@1 accuracy on ingredient substitution tasks, from the baseline 34.53 plus-minus 0.10% to 38.03 plus-minus 0.28% on the original GISMo dataset, and from 40.24 plus-minus 0.36% to 54.46 plus-minus 0.29% on a refined version of the same dataset. These substitutions led to the creation of 1,951 phytochemically enriched ingredient pairings and 1,639 unique recipes. While this approach demonstrates potential in optimizing ingredient substitutions, caution must be taken when drawing conclusions about health benefits, as the claims are based on preclinical evidence. Future work should include clinical validation and broader datasets to further evaluate the nutritional impact of these substitutions. This research represents a step forward in using AI to promote healthier eating practices, providing potential pathways for integrating computational methods with nutritional science.

**Authors**: Jialu Tang, Tong Xia, Yuan Lu, Cecilia Mascolo, Aaqib Saeed

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T12:50:36Z

**Summary**: Interpreting electrocardiograms (ECGs) and generating comprehensive reports remain challenging tasks in cardiology, often requiring specialized expertise and significant time investment. To address these critical issues, we propose ECG-ReGen, a retrieval-based approach for ECG-to-text report generation and question answering. Our method leverages a self-supervised learning for the ECG encoder, enabling efficient similarity searches and report retrieval. By combining pre-training with dynamic retrieval and Large Language Model (LLM)-based refinement, ECG-ReGen effectively analyzes ECG data and answers related queries, with the potential of improving patient care. Experiments conducted on the PTB-XL and MIMIC-IV-ECG datasets demonstrate superior performance in both in-domain and cross-domain scenarios for report generation. Furthermore, our approach exhibits competitive performance on ECG-QA dataset compared to fully supervised methods when utilizing off-the-shelf LLMs for zero-shot question answering. This approach, effectively combining self-supervised encoder and LLMs, offers a scalable and efficient solution for accurate ECG interpretation, holding significant potential to enhance clinical decision-making.

### What You Say = What You Want? Teaching Humans to Articulate Requirements   for LLMs
**Authors**: Qianou Ma, Weirui Peng, Hua Shen, Kenneth Koedinger, Tongshuang Wu

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T12:34:14Z

**Summary**: Prompting ChatGPT to achieve complex goals (e.g., creating a customer support chatbot) often demands meticulous prompt engineering, including aspects like fluent writing and chain-of-thought techniques. While emerging prompt optimizers can automatically refine many of these aspects, we argue that clearly conveying customized requirements (e.g., how to handle diverse inputs) remains a human-centric challenge. In this work, we introduce Requirement-Oriented Prompt Engineering (ROPE), a paradigm that focuses human attention on generating clear, complete requirements during prompting. We implement ROPE through an assessment and training suite that provides deliberate practice with LLM-generated feedback. In a study with 30 novices, we show that requirement-focused training doubles novices' prompting performance, significantly outperforming conventional prompt engineering training and prompt optimization. We also demonstrate that high-quality LLM outputs are directly tied to the quality of input requirements. Our work paves the way for more effective task delegation in human-LLM collaborative prompting.

### Performance Law of Large Language Models
**Authors**: Chuhan Wu, Ruiming Tang

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T12:28:45Z

**Summary**: Guided by the belief of the scaling law, large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in recent years. However, scaling law only gives a qualitative estimation of loss, which is influenced by various factors such as model architectures, data distributions, tokenizers, and computation precision. Thus, estimating the real performance of LLMs with different training settings rather than loss may be quite useful in practical development. In this article, we present an empirical equation named "Performance Law" to directly predict the MMLU score of an LLM, which is a widely used metric to indicate the general capability of LLMs in real-world conversations and applications. Based on only a few key hyperparameters of the LLM architecture and the size of training data, we obtain a quite accurate MMLU prediction of various LLMs with diverse sizes and architectures developed by different organizations in different years. Performance law can be used to guide the choice of LLM architecture and the effective allocation of computational resources without extensive experiments.

### Fusing Dynamics Equation: A Social Opinions Prediction Algorithm with   LLM-based Agents
**Authors**: Junchi Yao, Hongjie Zhang, Jie Ou, Dingyi Zuo, Zheng Yang, Zhicheng Dong

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T11:02:28Z

**Summary**: In the context where social media is increasingly becoming a significant platform for social movements and the formation of public opinion, accurately simulating and predicting the dynamics of user opinions is of great importance for understanding social phenomena, policy making, and guiding public opinion. However, existing simulation methods face challenges in capturing the complexity and dynamics of user behavior. Addressing this issue, this paper proposes an innovative simulation method for the dynamics of social media user opinions, the FDE-LLM algorithm, which incorporates opinion dynamics and epidemic model. This effectively constrains the actions and opinion evolution process of large language models (LLM), making them more aligned with the real cyber world. In particular, the FDE-LLM categorizes users into opinion leaders and followers. Opinion leaders are based on LLM role-playing and are constrained by the CA model, while opinion followers are integrated into a dynamic system that combines the CA model with the SIR model. This innovative design significantly improves the accuracy and efficiency of the simulation. Experiments were conducted on four real Weibo datasets and validated using the open-source model ChatGLM. The results show that, compared to traditional agent-based modeling (ABM) opinion dynamics algorithms and LLM-based opinion diffusion algorithms, our FDE-LLM algorithm demonstrates higher accuracy and interpretability.

### L3Cube-IndicQuest: A Benchmark Questing Answering Dataset for Evaluating   Knowledge of LLMs in Indic Context
**Authors**: Pritika Rohera, Chaitrali Ginimav, Akanksha Salunke, Gayatri Sawant, Raviraj Joshi

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T10:48:35Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant progress in incorporating Indic languages within multilingual models. However, it is crucial to quantitatively assess whether these languages perform comparably to globally dominant ones, such as English. Currently, there is a lack of benchmark datasets specifically designed to evaluate the regional knowledge of LLMs in various Indic languages. In this paper, we present the L3Cube-IndicQuest, a gold-standard question-answering benchmark dataset designed to evaluate how well multilingual LLMs capture regional knowledge across various Indic languages. The dataset contains 200 question-answer pairs, each for English and 19 Indic languages, covering five domains specific to the Indic region. We aim for this dataset to serve as a benchmark, providing ground truth for evaluating the performance of LLMs in understanding and representing knowledge relevant to the Indian context. The IndicQuest can be used for both reference-based evaluation and LLM-as-a-judge evaluation. The dataset is shared publicly at https://github.com/l3cube-pune/indic-nlp .

### B4: Towards Optimal Assessment of Plausible Code Solutions with   Plausible Tests
**Authors**: Mouxiang Chen, Zhongxin Liu, He Tao, Yusu Hong, David Lo, Xin Xia, Jianling Sun

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T10:22:08Z

**Summary**: Selecting the best code solution from multiple generated ones is an essential task in code generation, which can be achieved by using some reliable validators (e.g., developer-written test cases) for assistance. Since reliable test cases are not always available and can be expensive to build in practice, researchers propose to automatically generate test cases to assess code solutions. However, when both code solutions and test cases are plausible and not reliable, selecting the best solution becomes challenging. Although some heuristic strategies have been proposed to tackle this problem, they lack a strong theoretical guarantee and it is still an open question whether an optimal selection strategy exists. Our work contributes in two ways. First, we show that within a Bayesian framework, the optimal selection strategy can be defined based on the posterior probability of the observed passing states between solutions and tests. The problem of identifying the best solution is then framed as an integer programming problem. Second, we propose an efficient approach for approximating this optimal (yet uncomputable) strategy, where the approximation error is bounded by the correctness of prior knowledge. We then incorporate effective prior knowledge to tailor code generation tasks. Both theoretical and empirical studies confirm that existing heuristics are limited in selecting the best solutions with plausible test cases. Our proposed approximated optimal strategy B4 significantly surpasses existing heuristics in selecting code solutions generated by large language models (LLMs) with LLM-generated tests, achieving a relative performance improvement by up to 50% over the strongest heuristic and 246% over the random selection in the most challenging scenarios. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/ZJU-CTAG/B4.

**Authors**: Xinrun Du, Zhouliang Yu, Songyang Gao, Ding Pan, Yuyang Cheng, Ziyang Ma, Ruibin Yuan, Xingwei Qu, Jiaheng Liu, Tianyu Zheng, Xinchen Luo, Guorui Zhou, Wenhu Chen, Ge Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T09:47:29Z

**Summary**: In this study, we introduce CT-LLM, a 2B large language model (LLM) that illustrates a pivotal shift towards prioritizing the Chinese language in developing LLMs. Uniquely initiated from scratch, CT-LLM diverges from the conventional methodology by primarily incorporating Chinese textual data, utilizing an extensive corpus of 1,200 billion tokens, including 800 billion Chinese tokens, 300 billion English tokens, and 100 billion code tokens. This strategic composition facilitates the model's exceptional proficiency in understanding and processing Chinese, a capability further enhanced through alignment techniques. Demonstrating remarkable performance on the CHC-Bench, CT-LLM excels in Chinese language tasks, and showcases its adeptness in English through SFT. This research challenges the prevailing paradigm of training LLMs predominantly on English corpora and then adapting them to other languages, broadening the horizons for LLM training methodologies. By open-sourcing the full process of training a Chinese LLM, including a detailed data processing procedure with the obtained Massive Appropriate Pretraining Chinese Corpus (MAP-CC), a well-chosen multidisciplinary Chinese Hard Case Benchmark (CHC-Bench), and the 2B-size Chinese Tiny LLM (CT-LLM), we aim to foster further exploration and innovation in both academia and industry, paving the way for more inclusive and versatile language models.

### RoboGPT: an intelligent agent of making embodied long-term decisions for   daily instruction tasks
**Authors**: Yaran Chen, Wenbo Cui, Yuanwen Chen, Mining Tan, Xinyao Zhang, Dongbin Zhao, He Wang

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T09:36:18Z

**Summary**: Robotic agents must master common sense and long-term sequential decisions to solve daily tasks through natural language instruction. The developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) in natural language processing have inspired efforts to use LLMs in complex robot planning. Despite LLMs' great generalization and comprehension of instruction tasks, LLMs-generated task plans sometimes lack feasibility and correctness. To address the problem, we propose a RoboGPT agent\footnote{our code and dataset will be released soon} for making embodied long-term decisions for daily tasks, with two modules: 1) LLMs-based planning with re-plan to break the task into multiple sub-goals; 2) RoboSkill individually designed for sub-goals to learn better navigation and manipulation skills. The LLMs-based planning is enhanced with a new robotic dataset and re-plan, called RoboGPT. The new robotic dataset of 67k daily instruction tasks is gathered for fine-tuning the Llama model and obtaining RoboGPT. RoboGPT planner with strong generalization can plan hundreds of daily instruction tasks. Additionally, a low-computational Re-Plan module is designed to allow plans to flexibly adapt to the environment, thereby addressing the nomenclature diversity challenge. The proposed RoboGPT agent outperforms SOTA methods on the ALFRED daily tasks. Moreover, RoboGPT planner exceeds SOTA LLM-based planners like ChatGPT in task-planning rationality for hundreds of unseen daily tasks, and even other domain tasks, while keeping the large model's original broad application and generality.

### CPL: Critical Planning Step Learning Boosts LLM Generalization in   Reasoning Tasks
**Authors**: Tianlong Wang, Xueting Han, Jing Bai

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T08:59:31Z

**Summary**: Post-training large language models (LLMs) to develop reasoning capabilities has proven effective across diverse domains, such as mathematical reasoning and code generation. However, existing methods primarily focus on improving task-specific reasoning but have not adequately addressed the model's generalization capabilities across a broader range of reasoning tasks. To tackle this challenge, we introduce Critical Planning Step Learning (CPL), which leverages Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to explore diverse planning steps in multi-step reasoning tasks. Based on long-term outcomes, CPL learns step-level planning preferences to improve the model's planning capabilities and, consequently, its general reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, while effective in many scenarios for aligning LLMs, existing preference learning approaches like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) struggle with complex multi-step reasoning tasks due to their inability to capture fine-grained supervision at each step. We propose Step-level Advantage Preference Optimization (Step-APO), which integrates an advantage estimate for step-level preference pairs obtained via MCTS into the DPO. This enables the model to more effectively learn critical intermediate planning steps, thereby further improving its generalization in reasoning tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that our method, trained exclusively on GSM8K and MATH, not only significantly improves performance on GSM8K (+10.5%) and MATH (+6.5%), but also enhances out-of-domain reasoning benchmarks, such as ARC-C (+4.0%), BBH (+1.8%), MMLU-STEM (+2.2%), and MMLU (+0.9%).

### Policy Prototyping for LLMs: Pluralistic Alignment via Interactive and   Collaborative Policymaking
**Authors**: K. J. Kevin Feng, Inyoung Cheong, Quan Ze Chen, Amy X. Zhang

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T08:19:52Z

**Summary**: Emerging efforts in AI alignment seek to broaden participation in shaping model behavior by eliciting and integrating collective input into a policy for model finetuning. While pluralistic, these processes are often linear and do not allow participating stakeholders to confirm whether potential outcomes of their contributions are indeed consistent with their intentions. Design prototyping has long advocated for rapid iteration using tight feedback loops of ideation, experimentation, and evaluation to mitigate these issues. We thus propose policy prototyping for LLMs, a new process that draws inspiration from prototyping practices to enable stakeholders to collaboratively and interactively draft LLM policies. Through learnings from a real-world LLM policymaking initiative at an industrial AI lab, we motivate our approach and characterize policy prototyping with four guiding principles. Because policy prototyping emphasizes a contrasting set of priorities compared to previous approaches, we envision our approach to be a valuable addition to the methodological repertoire for pluralistic alignment.

**Authors**: Ishaan Domkundwar, Mukunda N S, Ishaan Bhola

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T08:14:36Z

**Summary**: AI agents, specifically powered by large language models, have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in various applications where precision and efficacy are necessary. However, these agents come with inherent risks, including the potential for unsafe or biased actions, vulnerability to adversarial attacks, lack of transparency, and tendency to generate hallucinations. As AI agents become more prevalent in critical sectors of the industry, the implementation of effective safety protocols becomes increasingly important. This paper addresses the critical need for safety measures in AI systems, especially ones that collaborate with human teams. We propose and evaluate three frameworks to enhance safety protocols in AI agent systems: an LLM-powered input-output filter, a safety agent integrated within the system, and a hierarchical delegation-based system with embedded safety checks. Our methodology involves implementing these frameworks and testing them against a set of unsafe agentic use cases, providing a comprehensive evaluation of their effectiveness in mitigating risks associated with AI agent deployment. We conclude that these frameworks can significantly strengthen the safety and security of AI agent systems, minimizing potential harmful actions or outputs. Our work contributes to the ongoing effort to create safe and reliable AI applications, particularly in automated operations, and provides a foundation for developing robust guardrails to ensure the responsible use of AI agents in real-world applications.

### CodeJudge-Eval: Can Large Language Models be Good Judges in Code   Understanding?
**Authors**: Yuwei Zhao, Ziyang Luo, Yuchen Tian, Hongzhan Lin, Weixiang Yan, Annan Li, Jing Ma

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T08:09:50Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have showcased impressive code generation capabilities, primarily evaluated through language-to-code benchmarks. However, these benchmarks may not fully capture a model's code understanding abilities. We introduce CodeJudge-Eval (CJ-Eval), a novel benchmark designed to assess LLMs' code understanding abilities from the perspective of code judging rather than code generation. CJ-Eval challenges models to determine the correctness of provided code solutions, encompassing various error types and compilation issues. By leveraging a diverse set of problems and a fine-grained judging system, CJ-Eval addresses the limitations of traditional benchmarks, including the potential memorization of solutions. Evaluation of 12 well-known LLMs on CJ-Eval reveals that even state-of-the-art models struggle, highlighting the benchmark's ability to probe deeper into models' code understanding abilities. Our codes and benchmark are available at \url{https://github.com/CodeLLM-Research/CodeJudge-Eval}.

### LA-RAG:Enhancing LLM-based ASR Accuracy with Retrieval-Augmented   Generation
**Authors**: Shaojun Li, Hengchao Shang, Daimeng Wei, Jiaxin Guo, Zongyao Li, Xianghui He, Min Zhang, Hao Yang

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T07:28:47Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in integrating speech information into large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved automatic speech recognition (ASR) accuracy. However, existing methods often constrained by the capabilities of the speech encoders under varied acoustic conditions, such as accents. To address this, we propose LA-RAG, a novel Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) paradigm for LLM-based ASR. LA-RAG leverages fine-grained token-level speech datastores and a speech-to-speech retrieval mechanism to enhance ASR accuracy via LLM in-context learning (ICL) capabilities. Experiments on Mandarin and various Chinese dialect datasets demonstrate significant improvements in ASR accuracy compared to existing methods, validating the effectiveness of our approach, especially in handling accent variations.

### Large Language Model Can Transcribe Speech in Multi-Talker Scenarios   with Versatile Instructions
**Authors**: Lingwei Meng, Shujie Hu, Jiawen Kang, Zhaoqing Li, Yuejiao Wang, Wenxuan Wu, Xixin Wu, Xunying Liu, Helen Meng

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T07:28:28Z

**Summary**: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized various domains, bringing significant progress and new opportunities. Despite progress in speech-related tasks, LLMs have not been sufficiently explored in multi-talker scenarios. In this work, we present a pioneering effort to investigate the capability of LLMs in transcribing speech in multi-talker environments, following versatile instructions related to multi-talker automatic speech recognition (ASR), target talker ASR, and ASR based on specific talker attributes such as sex, occurrence order, language, and keyword spoken. Our approach utilizes WavLM and Whisper encoder to extract multi-faceted speech representations that are sensitive to speaker characteristics and semantic context. These representations are then fed into an LLM fine-tuned using LoRA, enabling the capabilities for speech comprehension and transcription. Comprehensive experiments reveal the promising performance of our proposed system, MT-LLM, in cocktail party scenarios, highlighting the potential of LLM to handle speech-related tasks based on user instructions in such complex settings.

### GraphCoder: Enhancing Repository-Level Code Completion via Code Context   Graph-based Retrieval and Language Model
**Authors**: Wei Liu, Ailun Yu, Daoguang Zan, Bo Shen, Wei Zhang, Haiyan Zhao, Zhi Jin, Qianxiang Wang

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T07:19:16Z

**Summary**: The performance of repository-level code completion depends upon the effective leverage of both general and repository-specific knowledge. Despite the impressive capability of code LLMs in general code completion tasks, they often exhibit less satisfactory performance on repository-level completion due to the lack of repository-specific knowledge in these LLMs. To address this problem, we propose GraphCoder, a retrieval-augmented code completion framework that leverages LLMs' general code knowledge and the repository-specific knowledge via a graph-based retrieval-generation process. In particular, GraphCoder captures the context of completion target more accurately through code context graph (CCG) that consists of control-flow, data- and control-dependence between code statements, a more structured way to capture the completion target context than the sequence-based context used in existing retrieval-augmented approaches; based on CCG, GraphCoder further employs a coarse-to-fine retrieval process to locate context-similar code snippets with the completion target from the current repository. Experimental results demonstrate both the effectiveness and efficiency of GraphCoder: Compared to baseline retrieval-augmented methods, GraphCoder achieves higher exact match (EM) on average, with increases of +6.06 in code match and +6.23 in identifier match, while using less time and space.

### Sub-SA: Strengthen In-context Learning via Submodular Selective   Annotation
**Authors**: Jian Qian, Miao Sun, Sifan Zhou, Ziyu Zhao, Ruizhi Hun, Patrick Chiang

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T06:57:01Z

**Summary**: In-context learning (ICL) leverages in-context examples as prompts for the predictions of Large Language Models (LLMs). These prompts play a crucial role in achieving strong performance. However, the selection of suitable prompts from a large pool of labeled examples often entails significant annotation costs. To address this challenge, we propose Sub-SA (Submodular Selective Annotation), a submodule-based selective annotation method. The aim of Sub-SA is to reduce annotation costs while improving the quality of in-context examples and minimizing the time consumption of the selection process. In Sub-SA, we design a submodular function that facilitates effective subset selection for annotation and demonstrates the characteristics of monotonically and submodularity from the theoretical perspective. Specifically, we propose RPR (Reward and Penalty Regularization) to better balance the diversity and representativeness of the unlabeled dataset attributed to a reward term and a penalty term, respectively. Consequently, the selection for annotations can be effectively addressed with a simple yet effective greedy search algorithm based on the submodular function. Finally, we apply the similarity prompt retrieval to get the examples for ICL.

### Cracking the Code: Multi-domain LLM Evaluation on Real-World   Professional Exams in Indonesia
**Authors**: Fajri Koto

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T06:34:15Z

**Summary**: While knowledge evaluation in large language models has predominantly focused on academic subjects like math and physics, these assessments often fail to capture the practical demands of real-world professions. In this paper, we introduce IndoCareer, a dataset comprising 8,834 multiple-choice questions designed to evaluate performance in vocational and professional certification exams across various fields. With a focus on Indonesia, IndoCareer provides rich local contexts, spanning six key sectors: (1) healthcare, (2) insurance and finance, (3) creative and design, (4) tourism and hospitality, (5) education and training, and (6) law. Our comprehensive evaluation of 27 large language models shows that these models struggle particularly in fields with strong local contexts, such as insurance and finance. Additionally, while using the entire dataset, shuffling answer options generally maintains consistent evaluation results across models, but it introduces instability specifically in the insurance and finance sectors.

### Expediting and Elevating Large Language Model Reasoning via Hidden   Chain-of-Thought Decoding
**Authors**: Tianqiao Liu, Zui Chen, Zitao Liu, Mi Tian, Weiqi Luo

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T06:29:20Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in tasks requiring reasoning and multi-step problem-solving through the use of chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. However, generating the full CoT process results in significantly longer output sequences, leading to increased computational costs and latency during inference. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach to compress the CoT process through semantic alignment, enabling more efficient decoding while preserving the benefits of CoT reasoning. Our method introduces an auxiliary CoT model that learns to generate and compress the full thought process into a compact special token representation semantically aligned with the original CoT output. This compressed representation is then integrated into the input of the Hidden Chain-of-Thought (HCoT) model. The training process follows a two-stage procedure: First, the CoT model is optimized to generate the compressed token representations aligned with the ground-truth CoT outputs using a contrastive loss. Subsequently, with the CoT model parameters frozen, the HCoT model is fine-tuned to generate accurate subsequent predictions conditioned on the prefix instruction and the compressed CoT representations from the CoT model. Extensive experiments across three challenging domains - mathematical reasoning, agent invocation, and question answering - demonstrate that our semantic compression approach achieves competitive or improved performance compared to the full CoT baseline, while providing significant speedups of at least 1.5x in decoding time. Moreover, incorporating contrastive learning objectives further enhances the quality of the compressed representations, leading to better CoT prompting and improved task accuracy. Our work paves the way for more efficient exploitation of multi-step reasoning capabilities in LLMs across a wide range of applications.

### LLM-Powered Grapheme-to-Phoneme Conversion: Benchmark and Case Study
**Authors**: Mahta Fetrat Qharabagh, Zahra Dehghanian, Hamid R. Rabiee

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T06:13:55Z

**Summary**: Grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) conversion is critical in speech processing, particularly for applications like speech synthesis. G2P systems must possess linguistic understanding and contextual awareness of languages with polyphone words and context-dependent phonemes. Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated significant potential in various language tasks, suggesting that their phonetic knowledge could be leveraged for G2P. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of LLMs in G2P conversion and introduce prompting and post-processing methods that enhance LLM outputs without additional training or labeled data. We also present a benchmarking dataset designed to assess G2P performance on sentence-level phonetic challenges of the Persian language. Our results show that by applying the proposed methods, LLMs can outperform traditional G2P tools, even in an underrepresented language like Persian, highlighting the potential of developing LLM-aided G2P systems.

### DOCE: Finding the Sweet Spot for Execution-Based Code Generation
**Authors**: Haau-Sing Li, Patrick Fernandes, Iryna Gurevych, André F. T. Martins

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T05:50:11Z

**Summary**: Recently, a diverse set of decoding and reranking procedures have been shown effective for LLM-based code generation. However, a comprehensive framework that links and experimentally compares these methods is missing. We address this by proposing Decoding Objectives for Code Execution, a comprehensive framework that includes candidate generation, $n$-best reranking, minimum Bayes risk (MBR) decoding, and self-debugging as the core components. We then study the contributions of these components through execution-based evaluation metrics. Our findings highlight the importance of execution-based methods and the difference gap between execution-based and execution-free methods. Furthermore, we assess the impact of filtering based on trial unit tests, a simple and effective strategy that has been often overlooked in prior works. We also propose self-debugging on multiple candidates, obtaining state-of-the-art performance on reranking for code generation. We expect our framework to provide a solid guideline for future research on code generation.

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have reshaped the landscape of artificial intelligence by demonstrating exceptional performance across various tasks. However, substantial computational requirements make their deployment challenging on devices with limited resources. Recently, compression methods using low-rank matrix techniques have shown promise, yet these often lead to degraded accuracy or introduce significant overhead in parameters and inference latency. This paper introduces \textbf{Mo}dular \textbf{De}composition (MoDeGPT), a novel structured compression framework that does not need recovery fine-tuning while resolving the above drawbacks. MoDeGPT partitions the Transformer block into modules comprised of matrix pairs and reduces the hidden dimensions via reconstructing the module-level outputs. MoDeGPT is developed based on a theoretical framework that utilizes three well-established matrix decomposition algorithms -- Nystr\"om approximation, CR decomposition, and SVD -- and applies them to our redefined transformer modules. Our comprehensive experiments show MoDeGPT, without backward propagation, matches or surpasses previous structured compression methods that rely on gradient information, and saves 98% of compute costs on compressing a 13B model. On \textsc{Llama}-2/3 and OPT models, MoDeGPT maintains 90-95% zero-shot performance with 25-30% compression rates. Moreover, the compression can be done on a single GPU within a few hours and increases the inference throughput by up to 46%.

### ATFLRec: A Multimodal Recommender System with Audio-Text Fusion and   Low-Rank Adaptation via Instruction-Tuned Large Language Model
**Authors**: Zezheng Qin

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T05:33:09Z

**Summary**: Recommender Systems (RS) play a pivotal role in boosting user satisfaction by providing personalized product suggestions in domains such as e-commerce and entertainment. This study examines the integration of multimodal data text and audio into large language models (LLMs) with the aim of enhancing recommendation performance. Traditional text and audio recommenders encounter limitations such as the cold-start problem, and recent advancements in LLMs, while promising, are computationally expensive. To address these issues, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is introduced, which enhances efficiency without compromising performance. The ATFLRec framework is proposed to integrate audio and text modalities into a multimodal recommendation system, utilizing various LoRA configurations and modality fusion techniques. Results indicate that ATFLRec outperforms baseline models, including traditional and graph neural network-based approaches, achieving higher AUC scores. Furthermore, separate fine-tuning of audio and text data with distinct LoRA modules yields optimal performance, with different pooling methods and Mel filter bank numbers significantly impacting performance. This research offers valuable insights into optimizing multimodal recommender systems and advancing the integration of diverse data modalities in LLMs.

### h4rm3l: A Dynamic Benchmark of Composable Jailbreak Attacks for LLM   Safety Assessment
**Authors**: Moussa Koulako Bala Doumbouya, Ananjan Nandi, Gabriel Poesia, Davide Ghilardi, Anna Goldie, Federico Bianchi, Dan Jurafsky, Christopher D. Manning

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T05:19:32Z

**Summary**: The safety of Large Language Models (LLMs) remains a critical concern due to a lack of adequate benchmarks for systematically evaluating their ability to resist generating harmful content. Previous efforts towards automated red teaming involve static or templated sets of illicit requests and adversarial prompts which have limited utility given jailbreak attacks' evolving and composable nature. We propose a novel dynamic benchmark of composable jailbreak attacks to move beyond static datasets and taxonomies of attacks and harms. Our approach consists of three components collectively called h4rm3l: (1) a domain-specific language that formally expresses jailbreak attacks as compositions of parameterized prompt transformation primitives, (2) bandit-based few-shot program synthesis algorithms that generate novel attacks optimized to penetrate the safety filters of a target black box LLM, and (3) open-source automated red-teaming software employing the previous two components. We use h4rm3l to generate a dataset of 2656 successful novel jailbreak attacks targeting 6 state-of-the-art (SOTA) open-source and proprietary LLMs. Several of our synthesized attacks are more effective than previously reported ones, with Attack Success Rates exceeding 90% on SOTA closed language models such as claude-3-haiku and GPT4-o. By generating datasets of jailbreak attacks in a unified formal representation, h4rm3l enables reproducible benchmarking and automated red-teaming, contributes to understanding LLM safety limitations, and supports the development of robust defenses in an increasingly LLM-integrated world.   Warning: This paper and related research artifacts contain offensive and potentially disturbing prompts and model-generated content.

### RT-Surv: Improving Mortality Prediction After Radiotherapy with Large   Language Model Structuring of Large-Scale Unstructured Electronic Health   Records
**Authors**: Sangjoon Park, Chan Woo Wee, Seo Hee Choi, Kyung Hwan Kim, Jee Suk Chang, Hong In Yoon, Ik Jae Lee, Yong Bae Kim, Jaeho Cho, Ki Chang Keum, Chang Geol Lee, Hwa Kyung Byun, Woong Sub Koom

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T05:12:52Z

**Summary**: Accurate patient selection is critical in radiotherapy (RT) to prevent ineffective treatments. Traditional survival prediction models, relying on structured data, often lack precision. This study explores the potential of large language models (LLMs) to structure unstructured electronic health record (EHR) data, thereby improving survival prediction accuracy through comprehensive clinical information integration. Data from 34,276 patients treated with RT at Yonsei Cancer Center between 2013 and 2023 were analyzed, encompassing both structured and unstructured data. An open-source LLM was used to structure the unstructured EHR data via single-shot learning, with its performance compared against a domain-specific medical LLM and a smaller variant. Survival prediction models were developed using statistical, machine learning, and deep learning approaches, incorporating both structured and LLM-structured data. Clinical experts evaluated the accuracy of the LLM-structured data. The open-source LLM achieved 87.5% accuracy in structuring unstructured EHR data without additional training, significantly outperforming the domain-specific medical LLM, which reached only 35.8% accuracy. Larger LLMs were more effective, particularly in extracting clinically relevant features like general condition and disease extent, which closely correlated with patient survival. Incorporating LLM-structured clinical features into survival prediction models significantly improved accuracy, with the C-index of deep learning models increasing from 0.737 to 0.820. These models also became more interpretable by emphasizing clinically significant factors. This study shows that general-domain LLMs, even without specific medical training, can effectively structure large-scale unstructured EHR data, substantially enhancing the accuracy and interpretability of clinical predictive models.

### Confidential Computing on nVIDIA H100 GPU: A Performance Benchmark Study
**Authors**: Jianwei Zhu, Hang Yin, Peng Deng, Shunfan Zhou

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T04:54:28Z

**Summary**: This report evaluates the performance impact of enabling Trusted Execution Environments (TEE) on nVIDIA H100 GPUs for large language model (LLM) inference tasks. We benchmark the overhead introduced by TEE mode across various LLMs and token lengths, with a particular focus on the bottleneck caused by CPU-GPU data transfers via PCIe. Our results indicate that while there is minimal computational overhead within the GPU, the overall performance penalty is primarily attributable to data transfer. For the majority of typical LLM queries, the overhead remains below 5%, with larger models and longer sequences experiencing nearly zero overhead.

### A Joint Learning Model with Variational Interaction for Multilingual   Program Translation
**Authors**: Yali Du, Hui Sun, Ming Li

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T04:25:37Z

**Summary**: Programs implemented in various programming languages form the foundation of software applications. To alleviate the burden of program migration and facilitate the development of software systems, automated program translation across languages has garnered significant attention. Previous approaches primarily focus on pairwise translation paradigms, learning translation between pairs of languages using bilingual parallel data. However, parallel data is difficult to collect for some language pairs, and the distribution of program semantics across languages can shift, posing challenges for pairwise program translation. In this paper, we argue that jointly learning a unified model to translate code across multiple programming languages is superior to separately learning from bilingual parallel data. We propose Variational Interaction for Multilingual Program Translation~(VIM-PT), a disentanglement-based generative approach that jointly trains a unified model for multilingual program translation across multiple languages. VIM-PT disentangles code into language-shared and language-specific features, using variational inference and interaction information with a novel lower bound, then achieves program translation through conditional generation. VIM-PT demonstrates four advantages: 1) captures language-shared information more accurately from various implementations and improves the quality of multilingual program translation, 2) mines and leverages the capability of non-parallel data, 3) addresses the distribution shift of program semantics across languages, 4) and serves as a unified model, reducing deployment complexity.

### STORE: Streamlining Semantic Tokenization and Generative Recommendation   with A Single LLM
**Authors**: Qijiong Liu, Jieming Zhu, Lu Fan, Zhou Zhao, Xiao-Ming Wu

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T04:16:55Z

**Summary**: Traditional recommendation models often rely on unique item identifiers (IDs) to distinguish between items, which can hinder their ability to effectively leverage item content information and generalize to long-tail or cold-start items. Recently, semantic tokenization has been proposed as a promising solution that aims to tokenize each item's semantic representation into a sequence of discrete tokens. In this way, it preserves the item's semantics within these tokens and ensures that semantically similar items are represented by similar tokens. These semantic tokens have become fundamental in training generative recommendation models. However, existing generative recommendation methods typically involve multiple sub-models for embedding, quantization, and recommendation, leading to an overly complex system. In this paper, we propose to streamline the semantic tokenization and generative recommendation process with a unified framework, dubbed STORE, which leverages a single large language model (LLM) for both tasks. Specifically, we formulate semantic tokenization as a text-to-token task and generative recommendation as a token-to-token task, supplemented by a token-to-text reconstruction task and a text-to-token auxiliary task. All these tasks are framed in a generative manner and trained using a single LLM backbone. Extensive experiments have been conducted to validate the effectiveness of our STORE framework across various recommendation tasks and datasets. We will release the source code and configurations for reproducible research.

**Authors**: Yutthakorn Thiprak, Rungtam Ngodngamthaweesuk, Songtam Ngodngamtaweesuk

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T04:06:00Z

**Summary**: We present Eir Thai Medical LLM, a large language model with 8 billion parameters, specifically designed to enhance the accuracy of handling medical tasks in the Thai language. This model focuses on providing clear and easy-to-understand answers for both healthcare professionals and patients, thereby improving the efficiency of diagnosis and treatment processes. Human evaluation was conducted to ensure that the model adheres to care standards and provides unbiased answers.   To prioritize data security, the model is deployed within the hospital's internal network, ensuring both high security and faster processing speeds. The internal API connection is secured with encryption and strict authentication measures to prevent data leaks and unauthorized access.   We evaluated several open-source large language models with 8 billion parameters on four medical benchmarks: MedQA, MedMCQA, PubMedQA, and the medical subset of MMLU. The best-performing baselines were used to develop Eir Thai Medical LLM. Our evaluation employed multiple questioning strategies, including zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought reasoning, and ensemble/self-consistency voting methods. Our model outperformed commercially available Thai-language large language models by more than 10%. In addition, we developed enhanced model testing tailored for clinical use in Thai across 18 clinical tasks, where our model exceeded GPT-4o performance by more than 11%

### Truth-Aware Context Selection: Mitigating Hallucinations of Large   Language Models Being Misled by Untruthful Contexts
**Authors**: Tian Yu, Shaolei Zhang, Yang Feng

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T03:59:49Z

**Summary**: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive text generation capabilities, they are easily misled by untruthful contexts provided by users or knowledge augmentation tools, leading to hallucinations. To alleviate LLMs from being misled by untruthful context and take advantage of knowledge augmentation, we propose Truth-Aware Context Selection (TACS), a lightweight method to adaptively recognize and mask untruthful context from the inputs. TACS begins by performing truth detection on the input context, leveraging the parameterized knowledge within the LLM. Subsequently, it constructs a corresponding attention mask based on the truthfulness of each position, selecting the truthful context and discarding the untruthful context. Additionally, we introduce a new evaluation metric, Disturbance Adaption Rate, to further study the LLMs' ability to accept truthful information and resist untruthful information. Experimental results indicate that TACS can effectively filter untruthful context and significantly improve the overall quality of LLMs' responses when presented with misleading information.

### LLM-Enhanced Software Patch Localization
**Authors**: Jinhong Yu, Yi Chen, Di Tang, Xiaozhong Liu, XiaoFeng Wang, Chen Wu, Haixu Tang

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T03:12:52Z

**Summary**: Open source software (OSS) is integral to modern product development, and any vulnerability within it potentially compromises numerous products. While developers strive to apply security patches, pinpointing these patches among extensive OSS updates remains a challenge. Security patch localization (SPL) recommendation methods are leading approaches to address this. However, existing SPL models often falter when a commit lacks a clear association with its corresponding CVE, and do not consider a scenario that a vulnerability has multiple patches proposed over time before it has been fully resolved. To address these challenges, we introduce LLM-SPL, a recommendation-based SPL approach that leverages the capabilities of the Large Language Model (LLM) to locate the security patch commit for a given CVE. More specifically, we propose a joint learning framework, in which the outputs of LLM serves as additional features to aid our recommendation model in prioritizing security patches. Our evaluation on a dataset of 1,915 CVEs associated with 2,461 patches demonstrates that LLM-SPL excels in ranking patch commits, surpassing the state-of-the-art method in terms of Recall, while significantly reducing manual effort. Notably, for vulnerabilities requiring multiple patches, LLM-SPL significantly improves Recall by 22.83\%, NDCG by 19.41\%, and reduces manual effort by over 25\% when checking up to the top 10 rankings. The dataset and source code are available at \url{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LLM-SPL-91F8}.

### Patch-Level Training for Large Language Models
**Authors**: Chenze Shao, Fandong Meng, Jie Zhou

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T03:07:37Z

**Summary**: As Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve remarkable progress in language understanding and generation, their training efficiency has become a critical concern. Traditionally, LLMs are trained to predict the next token in a sequence. Despite the success of token-level training, it suffers from considerable computational costs due to the need to process an extensive number of tokens. To mitigate this issue, this paper introduces patch-level training for LLMs, which reduces the sequence length by compressing multiple tokens into a single patch. During patch-level training, we feed the language model shorter sequences of patches and train it to predict the next patch, thereby processing the majority of the training data at a significantly reduced computational cost. Following this, the model continues token-level training on the remaining training data to align with the inference mode. Experiments on a diverse range of models (370M-2.7B parameters) demonstrate that patch-level training can reduce overall computational costs to 0.5$\times$, without compromising the model performance compared to token-level training.

### ComGPT: Detecting Local Community Structure with Large Language Models
**Authors**: Li Ni, Haowen Shen, Lin Mu, Yiwen Zhang, Wenjian Luo

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T02:59:36Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs), like GPT, have demonstrated the ability to understand graph structures and have achieved excellent performance in various graph reasoning tasks, such as node classification. Despite their strong abilities in graph reasoning tasks, they lack specific domain knowledge and have a weaker understanding of community-related graph information, which hinders their capabilities in the community detection task. Moreover, local community detection algorithms based on seed expansion, referred to as seed expansion algorithms, often face the seed-dependent problem, community diffusion, and free rider effect. To use LLMs to overcome the above shortcomings, we explore a GPT-guided seed expansion algorithm named ComGPT. ComGPT iteratively selects potential nodes by local modularity M from the detected community's neighbors, and subsequently employs LLMs to choose the node to join the detected community from these selected potential nodes. To address the above issues faced by LLMs, we improve graph encoding method, called Incident, by incorporating community knowledge to improve LLMs's understanding of community-related graph information. Additionally, we design the NSG (Node Selection Guide) prompt to enhance LLMs' understanding of community characteristics. Experimental results demonstrate that ComGPT outperforms the comparison methods, thereby confirming the effectiveness of the improved graph encoding method and prompts.

### Intelligent LiDAR Navigation: Leveraging External Information and   Semantic Maps with LLM as Copilot
**Authors**: Fujing Xie, Jiajie Zhang, Sören Schwertfeger

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T02:37:28Z

**Summary**: Traditional robot navigation systems primarily utilize occupancy grid maps and laser-based sensing technologies, as demonstrated by the popular move_base package in ROS. Unlike robots, humans navigate not only through spatial awareness and physical distances but also by integrating external information, such as elevator maintenance updates from public notification boards and experiential knowledge, like the need for special access through certain doors. With the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), which posses text understanding and intelligence close to human performance, there is now an opportunity to infuse robot navigation systems with a level of understanding akin to human cognition. In this study, we propose using osmAG (Area Graph in OpensStreetMap textual format), an innovative semantic topometric hierarchical map representation, to bridge the gap between the capabilities of ROS move_base and the contextual understanding offered by LLMs. Our methodology employs LLMs as actual copilot in robot navigation, enabling the integration of a broader range of informational inputs while maintaining the robustness of traditional robotic navigation systems. Our code, demo, map, experiment results can be accessed at https://github.com/xiexiexiaoxiexie/Intelligent-LiDAR-Navigation-LLM-as-Copilot.

### Enhancing Temporal Understanding in Audio Question Answering for Large   Audio Language Models
**Authors**: Arvind Krishna Sridhar, Yinyi Guo, Erik Visser

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T02:17:58Z

**Summary**: The Audio Question Answering task includes audio event classification, audio captioning, and open ended reasoning. Recently, Audio Question Answering has garnered attention due to the advent of Large Audio Language Models. Current literature focuses on constructing LALMs by integrating audio encoders with text only Large Language Models through a projection module. While Large Audio Language Models excel in general audio understanding, they are limited in temporal reasoning which may hinder their commercial applications and on device deployment. This paper addresses these challenges and limitations in audio temporal reasoning. First, we introduce a data augmentation technique for generating reliable audio temporal questions and answers using an LLM. Second, we propose a continued finetuning curriculum learning strategy to specialize in temporal reasoning without compromising performance on finetuned tasks. Finally, we develop a reliable and transparent automated metric, assisted by an LLM, to measure the correlation between Large Audio Language Model responses and ground truth data intelligently. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed techniques using SOTA LALMs on public audio benchmark datasets.

### Explaining Large Language Models Decisions with Shapley Values
**Authors**: Behnam Mohammadi

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T00:56:01Z

**Summary**: The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has opened up exciting possibilities for simulating human behavior and cognitive processes, with potential applications in various domains, including marketing research and consumer behavior analysis. However, the validity of utilizing LLMs as stand-ins for human subjects remains uncertain due to glaring divergences that suggest fundamentally different underlying processes at play and the sensitivity of LLM responses to prompt variations. This paper presents a novel approach based on Shapley values from cooperative game theory to interpret LLM behavior and quantify the relative contribution of each prompt component to the model's output. Through two applications - a discrete choice experiment and an investigation of cognitive biases - we demonstrate how the Shapley value method can uncover what we term "token noise" effects, a phenomenon where LLM decisions are disproportionately influenced by tokens providing minimal informative content. This phenomenon raises concerns about the robustness and generalizability of insights obtained from LLMs in the context of human behavior simulation. Our model-agnostic approach extends its utility to proprietary LLMs, providing a valuable tool for practitioners and researchers to strategically optimize prompts and mitigate apparent cognitive biases. Our findings underscore the need for a more nuanced understanding of the factors driving LLM responses before relying on them as substitutes for human subjects in survey settings. We emphasize the importance of researchers reporting results conditioned on specific prompt templates and exercising caution when drawing parallels between human behavior and LLMs.

### Towards Unified Facial Action Unit Recognition Framework by Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Guohong Hu, Xing Lan, Hanyu Jiang, Jiayi Lyu, Jian Xue

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T00:26:09Z

**Summary**: Facial Action Units (AUs) are of great significance in the realm of affective computing. In this paper, we propose AU-LLaVA, the first unified AU recognition framework based on the Large Language Model (LLM). AU-LLaVA consists of a visual encoder, a linear projector layer, and a pre-trained LLM. We meticulously craft the text descriptions and fine-tune the model on various AU datasets, allowing it to generate different formats of AU recognition results for the same input image. On the BP4D and DISFA datasets, AU-LLaVA delivers the most accurate recognition results for nearly half of the AUs. Our model achieves improvements of F1-score up to 11.4% in specific AU recognition compared to previous benchmark results. On the FEAFA dataset, our method achieves significant improvements over all 24 AUs compared to previous benchmark results. AU-LLaVA demonstrates exceptional performance and versatility in AU recognition.

**Authors**: Yufei Tao, Adam Hiatt, Erik Haake, Antonie J. Jetter, Ameeta Agrawal

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T00:03:19Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in leveraging diverse knowledge sources. This study investigates how nine widely used LLMs allocate knowledge between local context and global parameters when answering open-ended questions in knowledge-consistent scenarios. We introduce a novel dataset, WikiAtomic, and systematically vary context sizes to analyze how LLMs prioritize and utilize the provided information and their parametric knowledge in knowledge-consistent scenarios. Additionally, we also study their tendency to hallucinate under varying context sizes. Our findings reveal consistent patterns across models, including a consistent reliance on both contextual (around 70%) and parametric (around 30%) knowledge, and a decrease in hallucinations with increasing context. These insights highlight the importance of more effective context organization and developing models that use input more deterministically for robust performance.

**Updated**: 2024-09-12T23:08:08Z

**Summary**: The existing methods for evaluating the inference abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have been results-centric, making it difficult to assess the inference process. We introduce a new approach using the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) dataset to evaluate the inference and contextual understanding abilities of large language models in a process-centric manner. ARC demands rigorous logical structures for problem-solving, making it a benchmark that facilitates the comparison of model inference abilities with humans. Experimental results confirm that while large language models possess weak inference abilities, they still lag in terms of logical coherence, compositionality, and productivity. Our experiments highlight the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, proposing development paths for achieving human-level reasoning.

We presents a novel white-box style attack approach that exposes vulnerabilities in leading open-source LLMs, including Llama, OPT, and T5. We assess the impact of model size, structure, and fine-tuning strategies on their resistance to adversarial perturbations. Our comprehensive evaluation across five diverse text classification tasks establishes a new benchmark for LLM robustness.

### Enabling Language Models to Implicitly Learn Self-Improvement
**Authors**: Ziqi Wang, Le Hou, Tianjian Lu, Yuexin Wu, Yunxuan Li, Hongkun Yu, Heng Ji

**Updated**: 2024-09-12T22:09:25Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in open-ended text generation tasks. However, the inherent open-ended nature of these tasks implies that there is always room for improvement in the quality of model responses. To address this challenge, various approaches have been proposed to enhance the performance of LLMs. There has been a growing focus on enabling LLMs to self-improve their response quality, thereby reducing the reliance on extensive human annotation efforts for collecting diverse and high-quality training data. Recently, prompting-based methods have been widely explored among self-improvement methods owing to their effectiveness, efficiency, and convenience. However, those methods usually require explicitly and thoroughly written rubrics as inputs to LLMs. It is expensive and challenging to manually derive and provide all necessary rubrics with a real-world complex goal for improvement (e.g., being more helpful and less harmful). To this end, we propose an ImPlicit Self-ImprovemenT (PIT) framework that implicitly learns the improvement goal from human preference data. PIT only requires preference data that are used to train reward models without extra human efforts. Specifically, we reformulate the training objective of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) -- instead of maximizing response quality for a given input, we maximize the quality gap of the response conditioned on a reference response. In this way, PIT is implicitly trained with the improvement goal of better aligning with human preferences. Experiments on two real-world datasets and one synthetic dataset show that our method significantly outperforms prompting-based methods.

### Safety of Linear Systems under Severe Sensor Attacks
**Authors**: Xiao Tan, Pio Ong, Paulo Tabuada, Aaron D. Ames

**Updated**: 2024-09-12T22:00:54Z

**Summary**: Cyber-physical systems can be subject to sensor attacks, e.g., sensor spoofing, leading to unsafe behaviors. This paper addresses this problem in the context of linear systems when an omniscient attacker can spoof several system sensors at will. In this adversarial environment, existing results have derived necessary and sufficient conditions under which the state estimation problem has a unique solution. In this work, we consider a severe attacking scenario when such conditions do not hold. To deal with potential state estimation uncertainty, we derive an exact characterization of the set of all possible state estimates. Using the framework of control barrier functions, we propose design principles for system safety in offline and online phases. For the offline phase, we derive conditions on safe sets for all possible sensor attacks that may be encountered during system deployment. For the online phase, with past system measurements collected, a quadratic program-based safety filter is proposed to enforce system safety. A 2D-vehicle example is used to illustrate the theoretical results.

### Sequential Discrete Action Selection via Blocking Conditions and   Resolutions
**Authors**: Liam Merz Hoffmeister, Brian Scassellati, Daniel Rakita

**Updated**: 2024-09-12T21:42:28Z

**Summary**: In this work, we introduce a strategy that frames the sequential action selection problem for robots in terms of resolving \textit{blocking conditions}, i.e., situations that impede progress on an action en route to a goal. This strategy allows a robot to make one-at-a-time decisions that take in pertinent contextual information and swiftly adapt and react to current situations. We present a first instantiation of this strategy that combines a state-transition graph and a zero-shot Large Language Model (LLM). The state-transition graph tracks which previously attempted actions are currently blocked and which candidate actions may resolve existing blocking conditions. This information from the state-transition graph is used to automatically generate a prompt for the LLM, which then uses the given context and set of possible actions to select a single action to try next. This selection process is iterative, with each chosen and executed action further refining the state-transition graph, continuing until the agent either fulfills the goal or encounters a termination condition. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by comparing it to various LLM and traditional task-planning methods in a testbed of simulation experiments. We discuss the implications of our work based on our results.

**Authors**: Hang Li, Tianlong Xu, Ethan Chang, Qingsong Wen

**Updated**: 2024-09-12T21:39:01Z

**Summary**: Knowledge tagging for questions is vital in modern intelligent educational applications, including learning progress diagnosis, practice question recommendations, and course content organization. Traditionally, these annotations have been performed by pedagogical experts, as the task demands not only a deep semantic understanding of question stems and knowledge definitions but also a strong ability to link problem-solving logic with relevant knowledge concepts. With the advent of advanced natural language processing (NLP) algorithms, such as pre-trained language models and large language models (LLMs), pioneering studies have explored automating the knowledge tagging process using various machine learning models. In this paper, we investigate the use of a multi-agent system to address the limitations of previous algorithms, particularly in handling complex cases involving intricate knowledge definitions and strict numerical constraints. By demonstrating its superior performance on the publicly available math question knowledge tagging dataset, MathKnowCT, we highlight the significant potential of an LLM-based multi-agent system in overcoming the challenges that previous methods have encountered. Finally, through an in-depth discussion of the implications of automating knowledge tagging, we underscore the promising results of deploying LLM-based algorithms in educational contexts.

**Authors**: Vladyslav Larin, Ivan Nikitin, Alexander Firsov

**Updated**: 2024-09-12T20:32:07Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we propose a novel approach where agents can form swarms to produce high-quality responses effectively. This is accomplished by utilizing agents capable of data inference and ranking, which can be effectively implemented using LLMs as response classifiers. We assess existing approaches for trustless agent inference, define our methodology, estimate practical parameters, and model various types of malicious agent attacks. Our method leverages the collective intelligence of swarms, ensuring robust and efficient decentralized AI inference with better accuracy, security, and reliability. We show that our approach is an order of magnitude faster than other trustless inference strategies reaching less than 125 ms validation latency.

### The Impact of Large Language Models on Open-source Innovation: Evidence   from GitHub Copilot
**Authors**: Doron Yeverechyahu, Raveesh Mayya, Gal Oestreicher-Singer

**Updated**: 2024-09-12T19:59:54Z

**Summary**: Generative AI (GenAI) has been shown to enhance individual productivity in a guided setting. While it is also likely to transform processes in a collaborative work setting, it is unclear what trajectory this transformation will follow. Collaborative environment is characterized by a blend of origination tasks that involve building something from scratch and iteration tasks that involve refining on others' work. Whether GenAI affects these two aspects of collaborative work and to what extent is an open empirical question. We study this question within the open-source development landscape, a prime example of collaborative innovation, where contributions are voluntary and unguided. Specifically, we focus on the launch of GitHub Copilot in October 2021 and leverage a natural experiment in which GitHub Copilot (a programming-focused LLM) selectively rolled out support for Python, but not for R. We observe a significant jump in overall contributions, suggesting that GenAI effectively augments collaborative innovation in an unguided setting. Interestingly, Copilot's launch increased maintenance-related contributions, which are mostly iterative tasks involving building on others' work, significantly more than code-development contributions, which are mostly origination tasks involving standalone contributions. This disparity was exacerbated in active projects with extensive coding activity, raising concerns that, as GenAI models improve to accommodate richer context, the gap between origination and iterative solutions may widen. We discuss practical and policy implications to incentivize high-value innovative solutions.

### E-QUARTIC: Energy Efficient Edge Ensemble of Convolutional Neural   Networks for Resource-Optimized Learning
**Authors**: Le Zhang, Onat Gungor, Flavio Ponzina, Tajana Rosing

**Updated**: 2024-09-12T19:30:22Z

**Summary**: Ensemble learning is a meta-learning approach that combines the predictions of multiple learners, demonstrating improved accuracy and robustness. Nevertheless, ensembling models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) result in high memory and computing overhead, preventing their deployment in embedded systems. These devices are usually equipped with small batteries that provide power supply and might include energy-harvesting modules that extract energy from the environment. In this work, we propose E-QUARTIC, a novel Energy Efficient Edge Ensembling framework to build ensembles of CNNs targeting Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based embedded systems. Our design outperforms single-instance CNN baselines and state-of-the-art edge AI solutions, improving accuracy and adapting to varying energy conditions while maintaining similar memory requirements. Then, we leverage the multi-CNN structure of the designed ensemble to implement an energy-aware model selection policy in energy-harvesting AI systems. We show that our solution outperforms the state-of-the-art by reducing system failure rate by up to 40% while ensuring higher average output qualities. Ultimately, we show that the proposed design enables concurrent on-device training and high-quality inference execution at the edge, limiting the performance and energy overheads to less than 0.04%.

### LLM Stability: A detailed analysis with some surprises
**Authors**: Berk Atil, Alexa Chittams, Liseng Fu, Ferhan Ture, Lixinyu Xu, Breck Baldwin

**Updated**: 2024-09-12T19:15:17Z

**Summary**: LLM (large language model) practitioners commonly notice that outputs can vary for the same inputs, but we have been unable to find work that evaluates LLM stability as the main objective. In our study of 6 deterministically configured LLMs across 8 common tasks with 5 identical runs, we see accuracy variations up to 10\%. In addition, no LLM consistently delivers repeatable accuracy across all tasks. We also show examples of variation that are not normally distributed and compare configurations with zero-shot/few-shot prompting and fine-tuned examples. To better quantify what is going on, we introduce metrics focused on stability: TARr@N for the total agreement rate at N runs over raw output, and TARa@N for total agreement over parsed-out answers. We suggest that stability metrics be integrated into leader boards and research results going forward.

### An Experimental Study of Competitive Market Behavior Through LLMs
**Authors**: Jingru Jia, Zehua Yuan

**Updated**: 2024-09-12T18:50:13Z

**Summary**: This study explores the potential of large language models (LLMs) to conduct market experiments, aiming to understand their capability to comprehend competitive market dynamics. We model the behavior of market agents in a controlled experimental setting, assessing their ability to converge toward competitive equilibria. The results reveal the challenges current LLMs face in replicating the dynamic decision-making processes characteristic of human trading behavior. Unlike humans, LLMs lacked the capacity to achieve market equilibrium. The research demonstrates that while LLMs provide a valuable tool for scalable and reproducible market simulations, their current limitations necessitate further advancements to fully capture the complexities of market behavior. Future work that enhances dynamic learning capabilities and incorporates elements of behavioral economics could improve the effectiveness of LLMs in the economic domain, providing new insights into market dynamics and aiding in the refinement of economic policies.

**Updated**: 2024-09-12T18:30:26Z

**Summary**: Recent years have seen an explosive increase in research on large language models (LLMs), and accompanying public engagement on the topic. While starting as a niche area within natural language processing, LLMs have shown remarkable potential across a broad range of applications and domains, including games. This paper surveys the current state of the art across the various applications of LLMs in and for games, and identifies the different roles LLMs can take within a game. Importantly, we discuss underexplored areas and promising directions for future uses of LLMs in games and we reconcile the potential and limitations of LLMs within the games domain. As the first comprehensive survey and roadmap at the intersection of LLMs and games, we are hopeful that this paper will serve as the basis for groundbreaking research and innovation in this exciting new field.

**Updated**: 2024-09-12T18:25:16Z

**Summary**: While Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) effectively aligns pretrained Large Language and Vision-Language Models (LLMs, and VLMs) with human preferences, its computational cost and complexity hamper its wider adoption. To alleviate some of the computational burden of fine-tuning, parameter efficient methods, like LoRA were introduced. In this work, we empirically evaluate the setup of Parameter Efficient Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (PE-RLHF) that leverages LoRA fine-tuning for Reward Modeling, and Reinforcement Learning. We benchmark the PE-RLHF setup on six diverse datasets spanning summarization, harmless/helpful response generation, UI automation, and visual question answering in terms of effectiveness of the trained models, and the training resources required. Our findings show, for the first time, that PE-RLHF achieves comparable performance to RLHF, while significantly reducing training time (up to 90% faster for reward models, and 30% faster for RL), and memory footprint (up to 50% reduction for reward models, and 27% for RL). We provide comprehensive ablations across LoRA ranks, and model sizes for both reward modeling and reinforcement learning. By mitigating the computational burden associated with RLHF, we push for a broader adoption of PE-RLHF as an alignment technique for LLMs and VLMs.

**Authors**: Georgia Argyrou, Angeliki Dimitriou, Maria Lymperaiou, Giorgos Filandrianos, Giorgos Stamou

**Updated**: 2024-09-12T18:22:51Z

**Summary**: Despite the rapid evolution and increasing efficacy of language and vision generative models, there remains a lack of comprehensive datasets that bridge the gap between personalized fashion needs and AI-driven design, limiting the potential for truly inclusive and customized fashion solutions. In this work, we leverage generative models to automatically construct a fashion image dataset tailored to various occasions, styles, and body types as instructed by users. We use different Large Language Models (LLMs) and prompting strategies to offer personalized outfits of high aesthetic quality, detail, and relevance to both expert and non-expert users' requirements, as demonstrated by qualitative analysis. Up until now the evaluation of the generated outfits has been conducted by non-expert human subjects. Despite the provided fine-grained insights on the quality and relevance of generation, we extend the discussion on the importance of expert knowledge for the evaluation of artistic AI-generated datasets such as this one. Our dataset is publicly available on GitHub at https://github.com/georgiarg/Prompt2Fashion.

**Updated**: 2024-09-12T18:00:18Z

**Summary**: Studying and building datasets for dialogue tasks is both expensive and time-consuming due to the need to recruit, train, and collect data from study participants. In response, much recent work has sought to use large language models (LLMs) to simulate both human-human and human-LLM interactions, as they have been shown to generate convincingly human-like text in many settings. However, to what extent do LLM-based simulations \textit{actually} reflect human dialogues? In this work, we answer this question by generating a large-scale dataset of 100,000 paired LLM-LLM and human-LLM dialogues from the WildChat dataset and quantifying how well the LLM simulations align with their human counterparts. Overall, we find relatively low alignment between simulations and human interactions, demonstrating a systematic divergence along the multiple textual properties, including style and content. Further, in comparisons of English, Chinese, and Russian dialogues, we find that models perform similarly. Our results suggest that LLMs generally perform better when the human themself writes in a way that is more similar to the LLM's own style.

**Authors**: Rogerio Bonatti, Dan Zhao, Francesco Bonacci, Dillon Dupont, Sara Abdali, Yinheng Li, Yadong Lu, Justin Wagle, Kazuhito Koishida, Arthur Bucker, Lawrence Jang, Zack Hui

**Updated**: 2024-09-13T20:17:13Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) show remarkable potential to act as computer agents, enhancing human productivity and software accessibility in multi-modal tasks that require planning and reasoning. However, measuring agent performance in realistic environments remains a challenge since: (i) most benchmarks are limited to specific modalities or domains (e.g. text-only, web navigation, Q&A, coding) and (ii) full benchmark evaluations are slow (on order of magnitude of days) given the multi-step sequential nature of tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce the Windows Agent Arena: a reproducible, general environment focusing exclusively on the Windows operating system (OS) where agents can operate freely within a real Windows OS and use the same wide range of applications, tools, and web browsers available to human users when solving tasks. We adapt the OSWorld framework (Xie et al., 2024) to create 150+ diverse Windows tasks across representative domains that require agent abilities in planning, screen understanding, and tool usage. Our benchmark is scalable and can be seamlessly parallelized in Azure for a full benchmark evaluation in as little as 20 minutes. To demonstrate Windows Agent Arena's capabilities, we also introduce a new multi-modal agent, Navi. Our agent achieves a success rate of 19.5% in the Windows domain, compared to 74.5% performance of an unassisted human. Navi also demonstrates strong performance on another popular web-based benchmark, Mind2Web. We offer extensive quantitative and qualitative analysis of Navi's performance, and provide insights into the opportunities for future research in agent development and data generation using Windows Agent Arena.

### OmniQuery: Contextually Augmenting Captured Multimodal Memory to Enable   Personal Question Answering
**Authors**: Jiahao Nick Li, Zhuohao Jerry Zhang, Jiaju Ma

**Updated**: 2024-09-12T17:48:08Z

**Summary**: People often capture memories through photos, screenshots, and videos. While existing AI-based tools enable querying this data using natural language, they mostly only support retrieving individual pieces of information like certain objects in photos and struggle with answering more complex queries that involve interpreting interconnected memories like event sequences. We conducted a one-month diary study to collect realistic user queries and generated a taxonomy of necessary contextual information for integrating with captured memories. We then introduce OmniQuery, a novel system that is able to answer complex personal memory-related questions that require extracting and inferring contextual information. OmniQuery augments single captured memories through integrating scattered contextual information from multiple interconnected memories, retrieves relevant memories, and uses a large language model (LLM) to comprehensive answers. In human evaluations, we show the effectiveness of OmniQuery with an accuracy of 71.5%, and it outperformed a conventional RAG system, winning or tying in 74.5% of the time.

**Updated**: 2024-09-12T17:39:08Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models still struggle in challenging scenarios that leverage structured data, complex reasoning, or tool usage. In this paper, we propose Source2Synth: a new method that can be used for teaching LLMs new skills without relying on costly human annotations. Source2Synth takes as input a custom data source and produces synthetic data points with intermediate reasoning steps grounded in real-world sources. Source2Synth improves the dataset quality by discarding low-quality generations based on their answerability. We demonstrate the generality of this approach by applying it to two challenging domains: we test reasoning abilities in multi-hop question answering (MHQA), and tool usage in tabular question answering (TQA). Our method improves performance by 25.51% for TQA on WikiSQL and 22.57% for MHQA on HotPotQA compared to the fine-tuned baselines.

### LLM Honeypot: Leveraging Large Language Models as Advanced Interactive   Honeypot Systems
**Authors**: Hakan T. Otal, M. Abdullah Canbaz

**Updated**: 2024-09-12T17:33:06Z

**Summary**: The rapid evolution of cyber threats necessitates innovative solutions for detecting and analyzing malicious activity. Honeypots, which are decoy systems designed to lure and interact with attackers, have emerged as a critical component in cybersecurity. In this paper, we present a novel approach to creating realistic and interactive honeypot systems using Large Language Models (LLMs). By fine-tuning a pre-trained open-source language model on a diverse dataset of attacker-generated commands and responses, we developed a honeypot capable of sophisticated engagement with attackers. Our methodology involved several key steps: data collection and processing, prompt engineering, model selection, and supervised fine-tuning to optimize the model's performance. Evaluation through similarity metrics and live deployment demonstrated that our approach effectively generates accurate and informative responses. The results highlight the potential of LLMs to revolutionize honeypot technology, providing cybersecurity professionals with a powerful tool to detect and analyze malicious activity, thereby enhancing overall security infrastructure.

### Understanding the concerns and choices of public when using large   language models for healthcare
**Authors**: Yunpeng Xiao, Kyrie Zhixuan Zhou, Yueqing Liang, Kai Shu

**Updated**: 2024-09-12T16:40:18Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have shown their potential in biomedical fields. However, how the public uses them for healthcare purposes such as medical Q\&A, self-diagnosis, and daily healthcare information seeking is under-investigated. This paper adopts a mixed-methods approach, including surveys (N=214) and interviews (N=17) to investigate how and why the public uses LLMs for healthcare. We found that participants generally believed LLMs as a healthcare tool have gained popularity, and are often used in combination with other information channels such as search engines and online health communities to optimize information quality. Based on the findings, we reflect on the ethical and effective use of LLMs for healthcare and propose future research directions.

### Trading Devil Final: Backdoor attack via Stock market and Bayesian   Optimization
**Authors**: Orson Mengara

**Updated**: 2024-09-12T16:22:52Z

**Summary**: Since the advent of generative artificial intelligence, every company and researcher has been rushing to develop their own generative models, whether commercial or not. Given the large number of users of these powerful new tools, there is currently no intrinsically verifiable way to explain from the ground up what happens when LLMs (large language models) learn. For example, those based on automatic speech recognition systems, which have to rely on huge and astronomical amounts of data collected from all over the web to produce fast and efficient results, In this article, we develop a backdoor attack called MarketBackFinal 2.0, based on acoustic data poisoning, MarketBackFinal 2.0 is mainly based on modern stock market models. In order to show the possible vulnerabilities of speech-based transformers that may rely on LLMs.

### Fine-tuning Large Language Models for Entity Matching
**Authors**: Aaron Steiner, Ralph Peeters, Christian Bizer

**Updated**: 2024-09-12T16:20:57Z

**Summary**: Generative large language models (LLMs) are a promising alternative to pre-trained language models for entity matching due to their high zero-shot performance and their ability to generalize to unseen entities. Existing research on using LLMs for entity matching has focused on prompt engineering and in-context learning. This paper explores the potential of fine-tuning LLMs for entity matching. We analyze fine-tuning along two dimensions: 1) The representation of training examples, where we experiment with adding different types of LLM-generated explanations to the training set, and 2) the selection and generation of training examples using LLMs. In addition to the matching performance on the source dataset, we investigate how fine-tuning affects the model's ability to generalize to other in-domain datasets as well as across topical domains. Our experiments show that fine-tuning significantly improves the performance of the smaller models while the results for the larger models are mixed. Fine-tuning also improves the generalization to in-domain datasets while hurting cross-domain transfer. We show that adding structured explanations to the training set has a positive impact on the performance of three out of four LLMs, while the proposed example selection and generation methods only improve the performance of Llama 3.1 8B while decreasing the performance of GPT-4o Mini.

**Authors**: Lorenzo Italiano, Bernardo Camajori Tedeschini, Mattia Brambilla, Huiping Huang, Monica Nicoli, Henk Wymeersch

**Updated**: 2024-09-12T15:43:59Z

**Summary**: The widespread adoption of the fifth generation (5G) of cellular networks has brought new opportunities for the development of localization-based services. High-accuracy positioning use cases and functionalities defined by the standards are drawing the interest of vertical industries. In the transition towards the deployment, this paper aims to provide an in-depth tutorial on 5G positioning, summarizing the evolutionary path that led to the standardization of cellular-based positioning, describing the localization elements in current and forthcoming releases of the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) standard, and the major research trends. By providing fundamental notions on wireless localization, comprehensive definitions of measurements and architectures, examples of algorithms, and details on simulation approaches, this paper is intended to represent an exhaustive guide for researchers and practitioners. Our approach aims to merge practical aspects of enabled use cases and related requirements with theoretical methodologies and fundamental bounds, allowing to understand the trade-off between system complexity and achievable, i.e., tangible, benefits of 5G positioning services. We analyze the performance of 3GPP Rel-16 positioning by standard-compliant simulations in realistic outdoor and indoor propagation environments, investigating the impact of the system configuration and the limitations to be resolved for delivering accurate positioning solutions.

### Faster Speech-LLaMA Inference with Multi-token Prediction
**Authors**: Desh Raj, Gil Keren, Junteng Jia, Jay Mahadeokar, Ozlem Kalinli

**Updated**: 2024-09-12T15:43:10Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have become proficient at solving a wide variety of tasks, including those involving multi-modal inputs. In particular, instantiating an LLM (such as LLaMA) with a speech encoder and training it on paired data imparts speech recognition (ASR) abilities to the decoder-only model, hence called Speech-LLaMA. Nevertheless, due to the sequential nature of auto-regressive inference and the relatively large decoder, Speech-LLaMA models require relatively high inference time. In this work, we propose to speed up Speech-LLaMA inference by predicting multiple tokens in the same decoding step. We explore several model architectures that enable this, and investigate their performance using threshold-based and verification-based inference strategies. We also propose a prefix-based beam search decoding method that allows efficient minimum word error rate (MWER) training for such models. We evaluate our models on a variety of public benchmarks, where they reduce the number of decoder calls by ~3.2x while maintaining or improving WER performance.

### LLM-POTUS Score: A Framework of Analyzing Presidential Debates with   Large Language Models
**Authors**: Zhengliang Liu, Yiwei Li, Oleksandra Zolotarevych, Rongwei Yang, Tianming Liu

**Updated**: 2024-09-12T15:40:45Z

**Summary**: Large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language processing, yet their application to political discourse analysis remains underexplored. This paper introduces a novel approach to evaluating presidential debate performances using LLMs, addressing the longstanding challenge of objectively assessing debate outcomes. We propose a framework that analyzes candidates' "Policies, Persona, and Perspective" (3P) and how they resonate with the "Interests, Ideologies, and Identity" (3I) of four key audience groups: voters, businesses, donors, and politicians. Our method employs large language models to generate the LLM-POTUS Score, a quantitative measure of debate performance based on the alignment between 3P and 3I. We apply this framework to analyze transcripts from recent U.S. presidential debates, demonstrating its ability to provide nuanced, multi-dimensional assessments of candidate performances. Our results reveal insights into the effectiveness of different debating strategies and their impact on various audience segments. This study not only offers a new tool for political analysis but also explores the potential and limitations of using LLMs as impartial judges in complex social contexts. In addition, this framework provides individual citizens with an independent tool to evaluate presidential debate performances, which enhances democratic engagement and reduces reliance on potentially biased media interpretations and institutional influence, thereby strengthening the foundation of informed civic participation.

### Robust Robot Walker: Learning Agile Locomotion over Tiny Traps
**Authors**: Shaoting Zhu, Runhan Huang, Linzhan Mou, Hang Zhao

**Updated**: 2024-09-12T15:35:49Z

**Summary**: Quadruped robots must exhibit robust walking capabilities in practical applications. In this work, we propose a novel approach that enables quadruped robots to pass various small obstacles, or "tiny traps". Existing methods often rely on exteroceptive sensors, which can be unreliable for detecting such tiny traps. To overcome this limitation, our approach focuses solely on proprioceptive inputs. We introduce a two-stage training framework incorporating a contact encoder and a classification head to learn implicit representations of different traps. Additionally, we design a set of tailored reward functions to improve both the stability of training and the ease of deployment for goal-tracking tasks. To benefit further research, we design a new benchmark for tiny trap task. Extensive experiments in both simulation and real-world settings demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method.

### What is the Role of Small Models in the LLM Era: A Survey
**Authors**: Lihu Chen, Gaël Varoquaux

**Updated**: 2024-09-12T15:04:57Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant progress in advancing artificial general intelligence (AGI), leading to the development of increasingly large models such as GPT-4 and LLaMA-405B. However, scaling up model sizes results in exponentially higher computational costs and energy consumption, making these models impractical for academic researchers and businesses with limited resources. At the same time, Small Models (SMs) are frequently used in practical settings, although their significance is currently underestimated. This raises important questions about the role of small models in the era of LLMs, a topic that has received limited attention in prior research. In this work, we systematically examine the relationship between LLMs and SMs from two key perspectives: Collaboration and Competition. We hope this survey provides valuable insights for practitioners, fostering a deeper understanding of the contribution of small models and promoting more efficient use of computational resources.

**Authors**: Huiyuan Xie, Felix Steffek, Joana Ribeiro de Faria, Christine Carter, Jonathan Rutherford

**Updated**: 2024-09-12T14:51:43Z

**Summary**: This paper explores the intersection of technological innovation and access to justice by developing a benchmark for predicting case outcomes in the UK Employment Tribunal (UKET). To address the challenge of extensive manual annotation, the study employs a large language model (LLM) for automatic annotation, resulting in the creation of the CLC-UKET dataset. The dataset consists of approximately 19,000 UKET cases and their metadata. Comprehensive legal annotations cover facts, claims, precedent references, statutory references, case outcomes, reasons and jurisdiction codes. Facilitated by the CLC-UKET data, we examine a multi-class case outcome prediction task in the UKET. Human predictions are collected to establish a performance reference for model comparison. Empirical results from baseline models indicate that finetuned transformer models outperform zero-shot and few-shot LLMs on the UKET prediction task. The performance of zero-shot LLMs can be enhanced by integrating task-related information into few-shot examples. We hope that the CLC-UKET dataset, along with human annotations and empirical findings, can serve as a valuable benchmark for employment-related dispute resolution.

**Authors**: Benji Peng, Keyu Chen, Ming Li, Pohsun Feng, Ziqian Bi, Junyu Liu, Qian Niu

**Updated**: 2024-09-12T14:42:08Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities across various fields, yet their increasing use raises critical security concerns. This article reviews recent literature addressing key issues in LLM security, with a focus on accuracy, bias, content detection, and vulnerability to attacks. Issues related to inaccurate or misleading outputs from LLMs is discussed, with emphasis on the implementation from fact-checking methodologies to enhance response reliability. Inherent biases within LLMs are critically examined through diverse evaluation techniques, including controlled input studies and red teaming exercises. A comprehensive analysis of bias mitigation strategies is presented, including approaches from pre-processing interventions to in-training adjustments and post-processing refinements. The article also probes the complexity of distinguishing LLM-generated content from human-produced text, introducing detection mechanisms like DetectGPT and watermarking techniques while noting the limitations of machine learning enabled classifiers under intricate circumstances. Moreover, LLM vulnerabilities, including jailbreak attacks and prompt injection exploits, are analyzed by looking into different case studies and large-scale competitions like HackAPrompt. This review is concluded by retrospecting defense mechanisms to safeguard LLMs, accentuating the need for more extensive research into the LLM security field.

**Authors**: Md. Adnanul Islam, Md. Faiyaz Abdullah Sayeedi, Jannatul Ferdous Deepti, Shahanur Rahman Bappy, Safrin Sanzida Islam, Fahim Hafiz

**Updated**: 2024-09-12T14:31:02Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we present a novel approach to the development and deployment of an autonomous mosquito breeding place detector rover with the object and obstacle detection capabilities to control mosquitoes. Mosquito-borne diseases continue to pose significant health threats globally, with conventional control methods proving slow and inefficient. Amidst rising concerns over the rapid spread of these diseases, there is an urgent need for innovative and efficient strategies to manage mosquito populations and prevent disease transmission. To mitigate the limitations of manual labor and traditional methods, our rover employs autonomous control strategies. Leveraging our own custom dataset, the rover can autonomously navigate along a pre-defined path, identifying and mitigating potential breeding grounds with precision. It then proceeds to eliminate these breeding grounds by spraying a chemical agent, effectively eradicating mosquito habitats. Our project demonstrates the effectiveness that is absent in traditional ways of controlling and safeguarding public health. The code for this project is available on GitHub at - https://github.com/faiyazabdullah/MosquitoMiner

**Authors**: Aili Chen, Xuyang Ge, Ziquan Fu, Yanghua Xiao, Jiangjie Chen

**Updated**: 2024-09-12T14:24:45Z

**Summary**: As global tourism expands and artificial intelligence technology advances, intelligent travel planning services have emerged as a significant research focus. Within dynamic real-world travel scenarios with multi-dimensional constraints, services that support users in automatically creating practical and customized travel itineraries must address three key objectives: Rationality, Comprehensiveness, and Personalization. However, existing systems with rule-based combinations or LLM-based planning methods struggle to fully satisfy these criteria. To overcome the challenges, we introduce TravelAgent, a travel planning system powered by large language models (LLMs) designed to provide reasonable, comprehensive, and personalized travel itineraries grounded in dynamic scenarios. TravelAgent comprises four modules: Tool-usage, Recommendation, Planning, and Memory Module. We evaluate TravelAgent's performance with human and simulated users, demonstrating its overall effectiveness in three criteria and confirming the accuracy of personalized recommendations.

**Authors**: Rachmad Vidya Wicaksana Putra, Alberto Marchisio, Fakhreddine Zayer, Jorge Dias, Muhammad Shafique

**Updated**: 2024-09-12T14:18:26Z

**Summary**: Robotic technologies have been an indispensable part for improving human productivity since they have been helping humans in completing diverse, complex, and intensive tasks in a fast yet accurate and efficient way. Therefore, robotic technologies have been deployed in a wide range of applications, ranging from personal to industrial use-cases. However, current robotic technologies and their computing paradigm still lack embodied intelligence to efficiently interact with operational environments, respond with correct/expected actions, and adapt to changes in the environments. Toward this, recent advances in neuromorphic computing with Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) have demonstrated the potential to enable the embodied intelligence for robotics through bio-plausible computing paradigm that mimics how the biological brain works, known as "neuromorphic artificial intelligence (AI)". However, the field of neuromorphic AI-based robotics is still at an early stage, therefore its development and deployment for solving real-world problems expose new challenges in different design aspects, such as accuracy, adaptability, efficiency, reliability, and security. To address these challenges, this paper will discuss how we can enable embodied neuromorphic AI for robotic systems through our perspectives: (P1) Embodied intelligence based on effective learning rule, training mechanism, and adaptability; (P2) Cross-layer optimizations for energy-efficient neuromorphic computing; (P3) Representative and fair benchmarks; (P4) Low-cost reliability and safety enhancements; (P5) Security and privacy for neuromorphic computing; and (P6) A synergistic development for energy-efficient and robust neuromorphic-based robotics. Furthermore, this paper identifies research challenges and opportunities, as well as elaborates our vision for future research development toward embodied neuromorphic AI for robotics.

### External Memories of PDP Switches for In-Network Implementable Functions   Placement: Deep Learning Based Reconfiguration of SFCs
**Authors**: Somayeh Kianpisheh, Tarik Taleb

**Updated**: 2024-09-12T13:47:18Z

**Summary**: Network function virtualization leverages programmable data plane switches to deploy in-network implementable functions, to improve QoS. The memories of switches can be extended through remote direct memory access to access external memories. This paper exploits the switches external memories to place VNFs at time intervals with ultra-low latency and high bandwidth demands. The reconfiguration decision is modeled as an optimization to minimize the deployment and reconfiguration cost, while meeting the SFCs deadlines. A DRL based method is proposed to reconfigure service chains adoptable with dynamic network and traffic characteristics. To deal with slow convergence due to the complexity of deployment scenarios, static and dynamic filters are used in policy networks construction to diminish unfeasible placement exploration. Results illustrate improvement in convergence, acceptance ratio and cost.

### Towards Scalable Quantum Key Distribution: A Machine Learning-Based   Cascade Protocol Approach
**Authors**: Hasan Abbas Al-Mohammed, Saif Al-Kuwari, Hashir Kuniyil, Ahmed Farouk

**Updated**: 2024-09-12T13:40:08Z

**Summary**: Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is a pivotal technology in the quest for secure communication, harnessing the power of quantum mechanics to ensure robust data protection. However, scaling QKD to meet the demands of high-speed, real-world applications remains a significant challenge. Traditional key rate determination methods, dependent on complex mathematical models, often fall short in efficiency and scalability. In this paper, we propose an approach that involves integrating machine learning (ML) techniques with the Cascade error correction protocol to enhance the scalability and efficiency of QKD systems. Our ML-based approach utilizes an autoencoder framework to predict the Quantum Bit Error Rate (QBER) and final key length with over 99\% accuracy. This method significantly reduces error correction time, maintaining a consistently low computation time even with large input sizes, such as data rates up to 156 Mbps. In contrast, traditional methods exhibit exponentially increasing computation times as input sizes grow, highlighting the superior scalability of our ML-based solution. Through comprehensive simulations, we demonstrate that our method not only accelerates the error correction process but also optimizes resource utilization, making it more cost-effective and practical for real-world deployment. The Cascade protocol's integration further enhances system security by dynamically adjusting error correction based on real-time QBER observations, providing robust protection against potential eavesdropping.   Our research establishes a new benchmark for scalable, high-throughput QKD systems, proving that machine learning can significantly advance the field of quantum cryptography. This work continues the evolution towards truly scalable quantum communication.

### From Explanations to Action: A Zero-Shot, Theory-Driven LLM Framework   for Student Performance Feedback
**Authors**: Vinitra Swamy, Davide Romano, Bhargav Srinivasa Desikan, Oana-Maria Camburu, Tanja Käser

**Updated**: 2024-09-12T13:18:41Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in eXplainable AI (XAI) for education have highlighted a critical challenge: ensuring that explanations for state-of-the-art AI models are understandable for non-technical users such as educators and students. In response, we introduce iLLuMinaTE, a zero-shot, chain-of-prompts LLM-XAI pipeline inspired by Miller's cognitive model of explanation. iLLuMinaTE is designed to deliver theory-driven, actionable feedback to students in online courses. iLLuMinaTE navigates three main stages - causal connection, explanation selection, and explanation presentation - with variations drawing from eight social science theories (e.g. Abnormal Conditions, Pearl's Model of Explanation, Necessity and Robustness Selection, Contrastive Explanation). We extensively evaluate 21,915 natural language explanations of iLLuMinaTE extracted from three LLMs (GPT-4o, Gemma2-9B, Llama3-70B), with three different underlying XAI methods (LIME, Counterfactuals, MC-LIME), across students from three diverse online courses. Our evaluation involves analyses of explanation alignment to the social science theory, understandability of the explanation, and a real-world user preference study with 114 university students containing a novel actionability simulation. We find that students prefer iLLuMinaTE explanations over traditional explainers 89.52% of the time. Our work provides a robust, ready-to-use framework for effectively communicating hybrid XAI-driven insights in education, with significant generalization potential for other human-centric fields.

### An Evaluation Framework for Attributed Information Retrieval using Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Hanane Djeddal, Pierre Erbacher, Raouf Toukal, Laure Soulier, Karen Pinel-Sauvagnat, Sophia Katrenko, Lynda Tamine

**Updated**: 2024-09-12T12:57:08Z

**Summary**: With the growing success of Large Language models (LLMs) in information-seeking scenarios, search engines are now adopting generative approaches to provide answers along with in-line citations as attribution. While existing work focuses mainly on attributed question answering, in this paper, we target information-seeking scenarios which are often more challenging due to the open-ended nature of the queries and the size of the label space in terms of the diversity of candidate-attributed answers per query. We propose a reproducible framework to evaluate and benchmark attributed information seeking, using any backbone LLM, and different architectural designs: (1) Generate (2) Retrieve then Generate, and (3) Generate then Retrieve. Experiments using HAGRID, an attributed information-seeking dataset, show the impact of different scenarios on both the correctness and attributability of answers.

### Games for AI Control: Models of Safety Evaluations of AI Deployment   Protocols
**Authors**: Charlie Griffin, Louis Thomson, Buck Shlegeris, Alessandro Abate

**Updated**: 2024-09-12T12:30:07Z

**Summary**: To evaluate the safety and usefulness of deployment protocols for untrusted AIs, AI Control uses a red-teaming exercise played between a protocol designer and an adversary. This paper introduces AI-Control Games, a formal decision-making model of the red-teaming exercise as a multi-objective, partially observable, stochastic game. We also introduce methods for finding optimal protocols in AI-Control Games, by reducing them to a set of zero-sum partially observable stochastic games. We apply our formalism to model, evaluate and synthesise protocols for deploying untrusted language models as programming assistants, focusing on Trusted Monitoring protocols, which use weaker language models and limited human assistance. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of our formalism by showcasing improvements over empirical studies in existing settings, evaluating protocols in new settings, and analysing how modelling assumptions affect the safety and usefulness of protocols.

### Unlocking Sustainability Compliance: Characterizing the EU Taxonomy for   Business Process Management
**Authors**: Finn Klessascheck, Stephan A. Fahrenkrog-Petersen, Jan Mendling, Luise Pufahl

**Updated**: 2024-09-12T12:08:04Z

**Summary**: To promote sustainable business practices, and to achieve climate neutrality by 2050, the EU has developed the taxonomy of sustainable activities, which describes when exactly business practices can be considered sustainable. While the taxonomy has only been recently established, progressively more companies will have to report how much of their revenue was created via sustainably executed business processes. To help companies prepare to assess whether their business processes comply with the constraints outlined in the taxonomy, we investigate in how far these criteria can be used for conformance checking, that is, assessing in a data-driven manner, whether business process executions adhere to regulatory constraints. For this, we develop a few-shot learning pipeline to characterize the constraints of the taxonomy with the help of an LLM as to the process dimensions they relate to. We find that many constraints of the taxonomy are useable for conformance checking, particularly in the sectors of energy, manufacturing, and transport. This will aid companies in preparing to monitor regulatory compliance with the taxonomy automatically, by characterizing what kind of information they need to extract, and by providing a better understanding of sectors where such an assessment is feasible and where it is not.

### Exploring Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning of Large Language Model on   Automated Program Repair
**Authors**: Guochang Li, Chen Zhi, Jialiang Chen, Junxiao Han, Shuiguang Deng

**Updated**: 2024-09-12T12:00:26Z

**Summary**: Automated Program Repair (APR) aims to fix bugs by generating patches. And existing work has demonstrated that "pre-training and fine-tuning" paradigm enables Large Language Models (LLMs) improve fixing capabilities on APR. However, existing work mainly focuses on Full-Model Fine-Tuning (FMFT) for APR and limited research has been conducted on the execution-based evaluation of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) for APR. Comparing to FMFT, PEFT can reduce computing resource consumption without compromising performance and has been widely adopted to other software engineering tasks.   To fill this gap, we enhance the existing APR dataset by employing prompt engineering to create an instruction dataset, APR-INSTRUCTION, at first. Secondly, we fine-tune four pre-trained LLMs using four different PEFT methods with APR-INSTRUCTION. The best fine-tuned model fixes 58% more bugs than the state-of-the-art LLM-based APR techniques. The results also show that $(IA)^3$ improves the creativity of LLMs more effectively through fine-tuning and achieves the highest fixing capability compared to the other three PEFT methods. Thirdly, we explore the optimal configuration of PEFT hyperparameters, and assess the impact of instruction dataset size, showing that a larger number of parameters and a larger training dataset do not necessarily result in better performance for PEFT. Lastly, we analyze peak memory usage and trainable parameters to show the efficiency of PEFT.   This work provides a comprehensive exploration of PEFT on APR and suggests potentially promising directions for extension to other software engineering downstream tasks. APR-INSTRUCTION, PEFT weights, and the fine-tuning code are publicly available as open-source resources.

### How Easily do Irrelevant Inputs Skew the Responses of Large Language   Models?
**Authors**: Siye Wu, Jian Xie, Jiangjie Chen, Tinghui Zhu, Kai Zhang, Yanghua Xiao

**Updated**: 2024-09-12T11:51:51Z

**Summary**: By leveraging the retrieval of information from external knowledge databases, Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit enhanced capabilities for accomplishing many knowledge-intensive tasks. However, due to the inherent flaws of current retrieval systems, there might exist irrelevant information within those retrieving top-ranked passages. In this work, we present a comprehensive investigation into the robustness of LLMs to different types of irrelevant information under various conditions. We initially introduce a framework to construct high-quality irrelevant information that ranges from semantically unrelated, partially related, and related to questions. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates that the constructed irrelevant information not only scores highly on similarity metrics, being highly retrieved by existing systems, but also bears semantic connections to the context. Our investigation reveals that current LLMs still face challenges in discriminating highly semantically related information and can be easily distracted by these irrelevant yet misleading content. Besides, we also find that current solutions for handling irrelevant information have limitations in improving the robustness of LLMs to such distractions. All the resources are available on GitHub at https://github.com/Di-viner/LLM-Robustness-to-Irrelevant-Information.
