 ### A Minimalist Method for Fine-tuning Text-to-Image Diffusion Models
**Authors**: Yanting Miao, William Loh, Suraj Kothawade, Pacal Poupart

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T16:59:05Z

**Summary**: Recent work uses reinforcement learning (RL) to fine-tune text-to-image diffusion models, improving text-image alignment and sample quality. However, existing approaches introduce unnecessary complexity: they cache the full sampling trajectory, depend on differentiable reward models or large preference datasets, or require specialized guidance techniques. Motivated by the "golden noise" hypothesis -- that certain initial noise samples can consistently yield superior alignment -- we introduce Noise PPO, a minimalist RL algorithm that leaves the pre-trained diffusion model entirely frozen and learns a prompt-conditioned initial noise generator. Our approach requires no trajectory storage, reward backpropagation, or complex guidance tricks. Extensive experiments show that optimizing the initial noise distribution consistently improves alignment and sample quality over the original model, with the most significant gains at low inference steps. As the number of inference steps increases, the benefit of noise optimization diminishes but remains present. These findings clarify the scope and limitations of the golden noise hypothesis and reinforce the practical value of minimalist RL fine-tuning for diffusion models.

### Cache Me If You Can: How Many KVs Do You Need for Effective Long-Context   LMs?
**Authors**: Adithya Bhaskar, Alexander Wettig, Tianyu Gao, Yihe Dong, Danqi Chen

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T16:21:12Z

**Summary**: Language models handle increasingly long contexts for tasks such as book summarization, but this leads to growing memory costs for the key-value (KV) cache. Many prior works have proposed ways of discarding KVs from memory, but their approaches are tailored to favorable settings, obscuring caveats like high peak memory and performance degradation, and a fair comparison between methods is difficult. In this paper, we propose the *KV footprint* as a unified metric, which accounts for both the amount of KV entries stored and their lifespan in memory. We evaluate methods based on the smallest footprint they attain while preserving performance in both long-context understanding and generation, with context lengths of up to 128K tokens. This metric reveals the high peak memory of prior KV eviction methods. One class of methods -- *post-fill eviction* -- has a high footprint due to being incompatible with eviction during pre-filling. We adapt these methods to be able to evict KVs during pre-filling, achieving substantially lower KV footprints. We then turn to *recency eviction* methods, wherein we propose PruLong, an end-to-end optimization method for learning which attention heads need to retain the full KV cache and which do not. PruLong saves memory while preserving long-context performance, achieving 12% smaller KV footprint than prior methods while retaining performance in challenging recall tasks. Our paper clarifies the complex tangle of long-context inference methods and paves the way for future development to minimize the KV footprint.

**Authors**: Arthur Bernhardt, Sajjad Tamimi, Florian Stock, Andreas Koch, Ilia Petrov

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T13:09:26Z

**Summary**: Memory latencies and bandwidth are major factors, limiting system performance and scalability. Modern CPUs aim at hiding latencies by employing large caches, out-of-order execution, or complex hardware prefetchers. However, software-based prefetching exhibits higher efficiency, improving with newer CPU generations.   In this paper we investigate software-based, post-Moore systems that offload operations to intelligent memories. We show that software-based prefetching has even higher potential in near-data processing settings by maximizing compute utilization through compute/IO interleaving.

### PromptDSI: Prompt-based Rehearsal-free Instance-wise Incremental   Learning for Document Retrieval
**Authors**: Tuan-Luc Huynh, Thuy-Trang Vu, Weiqing Wang, Yinwei Wei, Trung Le, Dragan Gasevic, Yuan-Fang Li, Thanh-Toan Do

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T12:59:40Z

**Summary**: Differentiable Search Index (DSI) utilizes pre-trained language models to perform indexing and document retrieval via end-to-end learning without relying on external indexes. However, DSI requires full re-training to index new documents, causing significant computational inefficiencies. Continual learning (CL) offers a solution by enabling the model to incrementally update without full re-training. Existing CL solutions in document retrieval rely on memory buffers or generative models for rehearsal, which is infeasible when accessing previous training data is restricted due to privacy concerns. To this end, we introduce PromptDSI, a prompt-based, rehearsal-free continual learning approach for document retrieval. PromptDSI follows the Prompt-based Continual Learning (PCL) framework, using learnable prompts to efficiently index new documents without accessing previous documents or queries. To improve retrieval latency, we remove the initial forward pass of PCL, which otherwise greatly increases training and inference time, with a negligible trade-off in performance. Additionally, we introduce a novel topic-aware prompt pool that employs neural topic embeddings as fixed keys, eliminating the instability of prompt key optimization while maintaining competitive performance with existing PCL prompt pools. In a challenging rehearsal-free continual learning setup, we demonstrate that PromptDSI variants outperform rehearsal-based baselines, match the strong cache-based baseline in mitigating forgetting, and significantly improving retrieval performance on new corpora.

**Summary**: The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs), driven by growing parameter scales, adoption of mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures, and expanding context lengths, imposes unprecedented demands on AI infrastructure. Traditional AI clusters face limitations in compute intensity, memory bandwidth, inter-chip communication, and latency, compounded by variable workloads and strict service-level objectives. Addressing these issues requires fundamentally redesigned hardware-software integration. This paper introduces Huawei CloudMatrix, a next-generation AI datacenter architecture, realized in the production-grade CloudMatrix384 supernode. It integrates 384 Ascend 910 NPUs and 192 Kunpeng CPUs interconnected via an ultra-high-bandwidth Unified Bus (UB) network, enabling direct all-to-all communication and dynamic pooling of resources. These features optimize performance for communication-intensive operations, such as large-scale MoE expert parallelism and distributed key-value cache access. To fully leverage CloudMatrix384, we propose CloudMatrix-Infer, an advanced LLM serving solution incorporating three core innovations: a peer-to-peer serving architecture that independently scales prefill, decode, and caching; a large-scale expert parallelism strategy supporting EP320 via efficient UB-based token dispatch; and hardware-aware optimizations including specialized operators, microbatch-based pipelining, and INT8 quantization. Evaluation with the DeepSeek-R1 model shows CloudMatrix-Infer achieves state-of-the-art efficiency: prefill throughput of 6,688 tokens/s per NPU and decode throughput of 1,943 tokens/s per NPU (<50 ms TPOT). It effectively balances throughput and latency, sustaining 538 tokens/s per NPU even under stringent 15 ms latency constraints, while INT8 quantization maintains model accuracy across benchmarks.

**Summary**: Plasma accelerators utilize strong electric fields in plasma waves to accelerate charged particles, making them a compact alternative to radiofrequency technologies. Discharge capillaries are plasma sources used in plasma accelerator research to provide acceleration targets, or as plasma lenses to capture or focus accelerated beams. They have applications for beam-driven and laser-driven plasma accelerators and can sustain high repetition rates for extended periods of time. Despite these advantages, high-fidelity simulations of discharge capillaries remain challenging due to the range of mechanisms involved and the difficulty to diagnose them in experiments. In this work, we utilize hydrodynamic plasma simulations to examine the discharge process of a plasma cell and discuss implications for future accelerator systems. The simulation model is validated with experimental measurements in a 50-mm-long, 1-mm-wide plasma capillary operating a 12-27 kV discharge at 2-12mbar hydrogen pressure. For 20 kV at 8.7mbar the discharge is shown to deposit 178mJ of energy in the plasma. Potential difficulties with the common density measurement method using H{\alpha} emission spectroscopy are discussed. This simulation model enables investigations of repeatability, heat flow management and fine tailoring of the plasma profile with discharges.

### Resource Allocation for Twin Maintenance and Computing Task Processing   in Digital Twin Vehicular Edge Computing Network
**Authors**: Yu Xie, Qiong Wu, Pingyi Fan, Nan Cheng, Wen Chen, Jiangzhou Wang, Khaled B. Letaief

**Updated**: 2025-06-19T07:29:09Z

**Summary**: As a promising technology, vehicular edge computing (VEC) can provide computing and caching services by deploying VEC servers near vehicles. However, VEC networks still face challenges such as high vehicle mobility. Digital twin (DT), an emerging technology, can predict, estimate, and analyze real-time states by digitally modeling objects in the physical world. By integrating DT with VEC, a virtual vehicle DT can be created in the VEC server to monitor the real-time operating status of vehicles. However, maintaining the vehicle DT model requires ongoing attention from the VEC server, which also needs to offer computing services for the vehicles. Therefore, effective allocation and scheduling of VEC server resources are crucial. This study focuses on a general VEC network with a single VEC service and multiple vehicles, examining the two types of delays caused by twin maintenance and computational processing within the network. By transforming the problem using satisfaction functions, we propose an optimization problem aimed at maximizing each vehicle's resource utility to determine the optimal resource allocation strategy. Given the non-convex nature of the issue, we employ multi-agent Markov decision processes to reformulate the problem. Subsequently, we propose the twin maintenance and computing task processing resource collaborative scheduling (MADRL-CSTC) algorithm, which leverages multi-agent deep reinforcement learning. Through experimental comparisons with alternative algorithms, it demonstrates that our proposed approach is effective in terms of resource allocation.

### LazyEviction: Lagged KV Eviction with Attention Pattern Observation for   Efficient Long Reasoning
**Authors**: Haoyue Zhang, Hualei Zhang, Xiaosong Ma, Jie Zhang, Song Guo

**Updated**: 2025-06-19T02:25:04Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit enhanced reasoning capabilities by employing Chain-of-Thought (CoT). However, the extended reasoning sequences introduce significant GPU memory overhead due to increased key-value (KV) cache size, particularly in tasks requiring long reasoning sequences, such as mathematics and programming. Existing KV cache compression methods mitigate memory bottlenecks but struggle in long reasoning tasks. In this paper, we analyze attention patterns in reasoning tasks and reveal a Token Importance Recurrence phenomenon: a large proportion of tokens receive renewed attention after multiple decoding steps, which is failed to capture by existing works and may lead to unpredictable eviction on such periodically critical tokens. To address this, we propose LazyEviction, a lagged KV eviction framework designed to maintain reasoning performance while reducing KV memory. LazyEviction is an Observation Window-based Lagged Eviction Mechanism retaining latent recurring tokens by performing lagged evictions across decoding steps, which contains two key components: (1) Recurrence Interval Tracking for capturing temporal variations in token importance, and (2) an Maximum Recurrence Interval-Centric Eviction Policy that prioritizes eviction based on tokens' recurrence patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LazyEviction reduces KV cache size by 50% while maintaining comparable accuracy on mathematics reasoning datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Our findings highlight the importance of preserving recurring tokens, which are critical for maintaining knowledge continuity in multi-step reasoning tasks.

### KVCache Cache in the Wild: Characterizing and Optimizing KVCache Cache   at a Large Cloud Provider
**Authors**: Jiahao Wang, Jinbo Han, Xingda Wei, Sijie Shen, Dingyan Zhang, Chenguang Fang, Rong Chen, Wenyuan Yu, Haibo Chen

**Updated**: 2025-06-19T02:18:16Z

**Summary**: Serving large language models (LLMs) is important for cloud providers, and caching intermediate results (KV\$) after processing each request substantially improves serving throughput and latency. However, there is limited understanding of how LLM serving benefits from KV\$ caching, where system design decisions like cache eviction policies are highly workload-dependent. In this paper, we present the first systematic characterization of the KV\$ workload patterns from one of the leading LLM service providers. We draw observations that were not covered by previous studies focusing on synthetic workloads, including: KV\$ reuses are skewed across requests, where reuses between single-turn requests are equally important as multi-turn requests; the reuse time and probability are diverse considering all requests, but for a specific request category, the pattern tends to be predictable; and the overall cache size required for an ideal cache hit ratio is moderate. Based on the characterization, we further propose a workload-aware cache eviction policy that improves the serving performance under real-world traces, especially with limited cache capacity.

### Medha: Efficiently Serving Multi-Million Context Length LLM Inference   Requests Without Approximations
**Authors**: Amey Agrawal, Haoran Qiu, Junda Chen, Íñigo Goiri, Chaojie Zhang, Rayyan Shahid, Ramachandran Ramjee, Alexey Tumanov, Esha Choukse

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T22:51:06Z

**Summary**: As large language models (LLMs) handle increasingly longer contexts, serving long inference requests of millions of tokens presents unique challenges. We show that existing work for long context inference is largely based on techniques from long context training, and does not handle the high variability in input lengths during inference. This leads to inefficient resource utilization, server fragmentation, and head-of-line (HOL) blocking.   We present Medha, an end-to-end system for efficient long-context LLM inference that addresses these challenges through fine-grained time sharing. Medha introduces three key innovations: (1) the mechanism of adaptive prefill chunking to help mitigate HOL blocking with preemption; (2) two new parallelism strategies: Sequence Pipeline Parallelism (SPP) to reduce time-to-first-token by pipelining prefill chunks, and KV-Cache Parallelism (KVP) to lower time-peroutput-token by distributing decoding across servers; and (3) a novel input-length aware least remaining slack scheduling to meet Service Level Objectives (SLOs).   Medha enables exact inference scaling beyond 10 million tokens, maintaining high throughput and low latency across mixed-length workloads. Compared to state-of-the-art systems, Medha reduces server fragmentation, cuts median latency by up to 30x, and improves throughput by over 5x, delivering production-scale long-context inference without compromising performance on shorter requests.

### Evolutionary Caching to Accelerate Your Off-the-Shelf Diffusion Model
**Authors**: Anirud Aggarwal, Abhinav Shrivastava, Matthew Gwilliam

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T17:59:50Z

**Summary**: Diffusion-based image generation models excel at producing high-quality synthetic content, but suffer from slow and computationally expensive inference. Prior work has attempted to mitigate this by caching and reusing features within diffusion transformers across inference steps. These methods, however, often rely on rigid heuristics that result in limited acceleration or poor generalization across architectures. We propose Evolutionary Caching to Accelerate Diffusion models (ECAD), a genetic algorithm that learns efficient, per-model, caching schedules forming a Pareto frontier, using only a small set of calibration prompts. ECAD requires no modifications to network parameters or reference images. It offers significant inference speedups, enables fine-grained control over the quality-latency trade-off, and adapts seamlessly to different diffusion models. Notably, ECAD's learned schedules can generalize effectively to resolutions and model variants not seen during calibration. We evaluate ECAD on PixArt-alpha, PixArt-Sigma, and FLUX-1.dev using multiple metrics (FID, CLIP, Image Reward) across diverse benchmarks (COCO, MJHQ-30k, PartiPrompts), demonstrating consistent improvements over previous approaches. On PixArt-alpha, ECAD identifies a schedule that outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method by 4.47 COCO FID while increasing inference speedup from 2.35x to 2.58x. Our results establish ECAD as a scalable and generalizable approach for accelerating diffusion inference. Our project website is available at https://aniaggarwal.github.io/ecad and our code is available at https://github.com/aniaggarwal/ecad.

### Demystifying the Visual Quality Paradox in Multimodal Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Shuo Xing, Lanqing Guo, Hongyuan Hua, Seoyoung Lee, Peiran Li, Yufei Wang, Zhangyang Wang, Zhengzhong Tu

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T17:14:07Z

**Summary**: Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel on benchmark vision-language tasks, yet little is known about how input visual quality shapes their responses. Does higher perceptual quality of images already translate to better MLLM understanding? We conduct the first systematic study spanning leading MLLMs and a suite of vision-language benchmarks, applying controlled degradations and stylistic shifts to each image. Surprisingly, we uncover a visual-quality paradox: model, task, and even individual-instance performance can improve when images deviate from human-perceived fidelity. Off-the-shelf restoration pipelines fail to reconcile these idiosyncratic preferences. To close the gap, we introduce Visual-Quality Test-Time Tuning (VQ-TTT)-a lightweight adaptation module that: (1) inserts a learnable, low-rank kernel before the frozen vision encoder to modulate frequency content; and (2) fine-tunes only shallow vision-encoder layers via LoRA. VQ-TTT dynamically adjusts each input image in a single forward pass, aligning it with task-specific model preferences. Across the evaluated MLLMs and all datasets, VQ-TTT lifts significant average accuracy, with no external models, cached features, or extra training data. These findings redefine ``better'' visual inputs for MLLMs and highlight the need for adaptive, rather than universally ``clean'', imagery, in the new era of AI being the main data customer.

### From Block to Byte: Transforming PCIe SSDs with CXL Memory Protocol and   Instruction Annotation
**Authors**: Miryeong Kwon, Donghyun Gouk, Junhyeok Jang, Jinwoo Baek, Hyunwoo You, Sangyoon Ji, Hongjoo Jung, Junseok Moon, Seungkwan Kang, Seungjun Lee, Myoungsoo Jung

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T16:44:04Z

**Summary**: This paper explores how Compute Express Link (CXL) can transform PCIe-based block storage into a scalable, byte-addressable working memory. We address the challenges of adapting block storage to CXL's memory-centric model by emphasizing cacheability as a key enabler and advocating for Type 3 endpoint devices, referred to as CXL-SSDs. To validate our approach, we prototype a CXL-SSD on a custom FPGA platform and propose annotation mechanisms, Determinism and Bufferability, to enhance performance while preserving data persistency. Our simulation-based evaluation demonstrates that CXL-SSD achieves 10.9x better performance than PCIe-based memory expanders and further reduces latency by 5.4x with annotation enhancements. In workloads with high locality, CXL-SSD approaches DRAM-like performance due to efficient on-chip caching. This work highlights the feasibility of integrating block storage into CXL's ecosystem and provides a foundation for future memory-storage convergence.

**Authors**: Shufan Li, Konstantinos Kallidromitis, Hritik Bansal, Akash Gokul, Yusuke Kato, Kazuki Kozuka, Jason Kuen, Zhe Lin, Kai-Wei Chang, Aditya Grover

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T15:17:40Z

**Summary**: Modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can solve a wide range of tasks requiring visual reasoning. In real-world scenarios, desirable properties for VLMs include fast inference and controllable generation (e.g., constraining outputs to adhere to a desired format). However, existing autoregressive (AR) VLMs like LLaVA struggle in these aspects. Discrete diffusion models (DMs) offer a promising alternative, enabling parallel decoding for faster inference and bidirectional context for controllable generation through text-infilling. While effective in language-only settings, DMs' potential for multimodal tasks is underexplored. We introduce LaViDa, a family of VLMs built on DMs. We build LaViDa by equipping DMs with a vision encoder and jointly fine-tune the combined parts for multimodal instruction following. To address challenges encountered, LaViDa incorporates novel techniques such as complementary masking for effective training, prefix KV cache for efficient inference, and timestep shifting for high-quality sampling. Experiments show that LaViDa achieves competitive or superior performance to AR VLMs on multi-modal benchmarks such as MMMU, while offering unique advantages of DMs, including flexible speed-quality tradeoff, controllability, and bidirectional reasoning. On COCO captioning, LaViDa surpasses Open-LLaVa-Next-8B by +4.1 CIDEr with 1.92x speedup. On bidirectional tasks, it achieves +59% improvement on Constrained Poem Completion. These results demonstrate LaViDa as a strong alternative to AR VLMs. Code and models will be released in the camera-ready version.

### VideoMAR: Autoregressive Video Generatio with Continuous Tokens
**Authors**: Hu Yu, Biao Gong, Hangjie Yuan, DanDan Zheng, Weilong Chai, Jingdong Chen, Kecheng Zheng, Feng Zhao

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T09:44:09Z

**Summary**: Masked-based autoregressive models have demonstrated promising image generation capability in continuous space. However, their potential for video generation remains under-explored. In this paper, we propose \textbf{VideoMAR}, a concise and efficient decoder-only autoregressive image-to-video model with continuous tokens, composing temporal frame-by-frame and spatial masked generation. We first identify temporal causality and spatial bi-directionality as the first principle of video AR models, and propose the next-frame diffusion loss for the integration of mask and video generation. Besides, the huge cost and difficulty of long sequence autoregressive modeling is a basic but crucial issue. To this end, we propose the temporal short-to-long curriculum learning and spatial progressive resolution training, and employ progressive temperature strategy at inference time to mitigate the accumulation error. Furthermore, VideoMAR replicates several unique capacities of language models to video generation. It inherently bears high efficiency due to simultaneous temporal-wise KV cache and spatial-wise parallel generation, and presents the capacity of spatial and temporal extrapolation via 3D rotary embeddings. On the VBench-I2V benchmark, VideoMAR surpasses the previous state-of-the-art (Cosmos I2V) while requiring significantly fewer parameters ($9.3\%$), training data ($0.5\%$), and GPU resources ($0.2\%$).

### A Novel Compiler Transformation for Fast Sparse Matrix Multiplication in   GPUs
**Authors**: Hossein Albakri, Kazem Cheshmi

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T06:41:35Z

**Summary**: Sparse data structures are commonly used in neural networks to reduce the memory footprint. These data structures are compact but cause irregularities such as random memory accesses, which prevent efficient use of the memory hierarchy. GPUs are a common platform for machine learning practitioners, but running compact data structures on these devices often leads to slow-downs due to inefficient use of computing and memory resources. This paper proposes a new compiler transformation, enumerate-and-sparse-coarsen, that accelerates sparse matrix-matrix multiplication (SPMM) on GPU devices. The transformation increases data reuse in registers and caches while creating more balanced workloads for GPU computing resources. The transformation is tested on sparse neural networks in convolutional and transformer models. On an A100 GPU and across a columns of matrix B (bCols) in $ A \times B = C$ from range of 32 to 128, the transformation yields a geometric mean speedup of 1.84$\times$ to 2.27$\times$ compared to cuBLAS and cuSPARSE baselines, respectively.

### eLLM: Elastic Memory Management Framework for Efficient LLM Serving
**Authors**: Jiale Xu, Rui Zhang, Yi Xiong, Cong Guo, Zihan Liu, Yangjie Zhou, Weiming Hu, Hao Wu, Changxu Shao, Ziqing Wang, Yongjie Yuan, Junping Zhao, Minyi Guo, Jingwen Leng

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T05:56:01Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models are increasingly being deployed in datacenters. Serving these models requires careful memory management, as their memory usage includes static weights, dynamic activations, and key-value caches. While static weights are constant and predictable, dynamic components such as activations and KV caches change frequently during runtime, presenting significant challenges for efficient memory management. Modern LLM serving systems typically handle runtime memory and KV caches at distinct abstraction levels: runtime memory management relies on static tensor abstractions, whereas KV caches utilize a page table-based virtualization layer built on top of the tensor abstraction. This virtualization dynamically manages KV caches to mitigate memory fragmentation. However, this dual-level approach fundamentally isolates runtime memory and KV cache management, resulting in suboptimal memory utilization under dynamic workloads, which can lead to a nearly 20% drop in throughput.   To address these limitations, we propose eLLM, an elastic memory management framework inspired by the classical memory ballooning mechanism in operating systems. The core components of eLLM include: (1) Virtual Tensor Abstraction, which decouples the virtual address space of tensors from the physical GPU memory, creating a unified and flexible memory pool; (2) an Elastic Memory Mechanism that dynamically adjusts memory allocation through runtime memory inflation and deflation, leveraging CPU memory as an extensible buffer; and (3) a Lightweight Scheduling Strategy employing SLO-aware policies to optimize memory utilization and effectively balance performance trade-offs under stringent SLO constraints. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that eLLM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art systems, 2.32x higher decoding throughput, and supporting 3x larger batch sizes for 128K-token inputs.

### InfiniPot-V: Memory-Constrained KV Cache Compression for Streaming Video   Understanding
**Authors**: Minsoo Kim, Kyuhong Shim, Jungwook Choi, Simyung Chang

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T02:22:14Z

**Summary**: Modern multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can reason over hour-long video, yet their key-value (KV) cache grows linearly with time--quickly exceeding the fixed memory of phones, AR glasses, and edge robots. Prior compression schemes either assume the whole video and user query are available offline or must first build the full cache, so memory still scales with stream length. InfiniPot-V is the first training-free, query-agnostic framework that enforces a hard, length-independent memory cap for streaming video understanding. During video encoding it monitors the cache and, once a user-set threshold is reached, runs a lightweight compression pass that (i) removes temporally redundant tokens via Temporal-axis Redundancy (TaR) metric and (ii) keeps semantically significant tokens via Value-Norm (VaN) ranking. Across four open-source MLLMs and four long-video and two streaming-video benchmarks, InfiniPot-V cuts peak GPU memory by up to 94%, sustains real-time generation, and matches or surpasses full-cache accuracy--even in multi-turn dialogues. By dissolving the KV cache bottleneck without retraining or query knowledge, InfiniPot-V closes the gap for on-device streaming video assistants.

### Compatibility of trapped ions and dielectrics at cryogenic temperatures
**Authors**: M. Bruff, L. Sonderhouse, K. N. David, J. Stuart, D. H. Slichter, D. Leibfried

**Updated**: 2025-06-18T01:37:55Z

**Summary**: We study the impact of an unshielded dielectric $\unicode{x2013}$ here, a bare optical fiber $\unicode{x2013}$ on a $^{40}$Ca${^+}$ ion held several hundred $\mu$m away in a cryogenic surface electrode trap. We observe distance-dependent stray electric fields of up to a few kV/m due to the dielectric, which drift on average less than 10% per month and can be fully compensated with reasonable voltages on the trap electrodes. We observe ion motional heating rates attributable to the dielectric of $\approx$30 quanta per second at an ion-fiber distance of 215(4) $\mu$m and $\approx$1.5 MHz motional frequency. These results demonstrate the viability of using unshielded, trap-integrated dielectric objects such as miniature optical cavities or other optical elements in cryogenic surface electrode ion traps.

### CDP: Towards Robust Autoregressive Visuomotor Policy Learning via Causal   Diffusion
**Authors**: Jiahua Ma, Yiran Qin, Yixiong Li, Xuanqi Liao, Yulan Guo, Ruimao Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-06-17T17:59:12Z

**Summary**: Diffusion Policy (DP) enables robots to learn complex behaviors by imitating expert demonstrations through action diffusion. However, in practical applications, hardware limitations often degrade data quality, while real-time constraints restrict model inference to instantaneous state and scene observations. These limitations seriously reduce the efficacy of learning from expert demonstrations, resulting in failures in object localization, grasp planning, and long-horizon task execution. To address these challenges, we propose Causal Diffusion Policy (CDP), a novel transformer-based diffusion model that enhances action prediction by conditioning on historical action sequences, thereby enabling more coherent and context-aware visuomotor policy learning. To further mitigate the computational cost associated with autoregressive inference, a caching mechanism is also introduced to store attention key-value pairs from previous timesteps, substantially reducing redundant computations during execution. Extensive experiments in both simulated and real-world environments, spanning diverse 2D and 3D manipulation tasks, demonstrate that CDP uniquely leverages historical action sequences to achieve significantly higher accuracy than existing methods. Moreover, even when faced with degraded input observation quality, CDP maintains remarkable precision by reasoning through temporal continuity, which highlights its practical robustness for robotic control under realistic, imperfect conditions.

### Keigo: Co-designing Log-Structured Merge Key-Value Stores with a   Non-Volatile, Concurrency-aware Storage Hierarchy (Extended Version)
**Authors**: Rúben Adão, Zhongjie Wu, Changjun Zhou, Oana Balmau, João Paulo, Ricardo Macedo

**Updated**: 2025-06-17T15:25:11Z

**Summary**: We present Keigo, a concurrency- and workload-aware storage middleware that enhances the performance of log-structured merge key-value stores (LSM KVS) when they are deployed on a hierarchy of storage devices. The key observation behind Keigo is that there is no one-size-fits-all placement of data across the storage hierarchy that optimizes for all workloads. Hence, to leverage the benefits of combining different storage devices, Keigo places files across different devices based on their parallelism, I/O bandwidth, and capacity. We introduce three techniques - concurrency-aware data placement, persistent read-only caching, and context-based I/O differentiation. Keigo is portable across different LSMs, is adaptable to dynamic workloads, and does not require extensive profiling. Our system enables established production KVS such as RocksDB, LevelDB, and Speedb to benefit from heterogeneous storage setups. We evaluate Keigo using synthetic and realistic workloads, showing that it improves the throughput of production-grade LSMs up to 4x for write- and 18x for read-heavy workloads when compared to general-purpose storage systems and specialized LSM KVS.

### LongSpec: Long-Context Lossless Speculative Decoding with Efficient   Drafting and Verification
**Authors**: Penghui Yang, Cunxiao Du, Fengzhuo Zhang, Haonan Wang, Tianyu Pang, Chao Du, Bo An

**Updated**: 2025-06-17T05:58:01Z

**Summary**: As Large Language Models (LLMs) can now process extremely long contexts, efficient inference over these extended inputs has become increasingly important, especially for emerging applications like LLM agents that highly depend on this capability. Speculative decoding (SD) offers a promising lossless acceleration technique compared to lossy alternatives such as quantization and model cascades. However, most state-of-the-art SD methods are trained on short texts (typically fewer than 4k tokens), making them unsuitable for long-context scenarios. Specifically, adapting these methods to long contexts presents three key challenges: (1) the excessive memory demands posed by draft models due to large Key-Value (KV) cache; (2) performance degradation resulting from the mismatch between short-context training and long-context inference; and (3) inefficiencies in tree attention mechanisms when managing long token sequences. This work introduces LongSpec, a framework that addresses these challenges through three core innovations: a memory-efficient draft model with a constant-sized KV cache; novel position indices that mitigate the training-inference mismatch; and an attention aggregation strategy that combines fast prefix computation with standard tree attention to enable efficient decoding. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of LongSpec, achieving up to a 3.26x speedup over strong Flash Attention baselines across five long-context understanding datasets, as well as a 2.25x reduction in wall-clock time on the AIME24 long reasoning task with the QwQ model, demonstrating significant latency improvements for long-context applications. The code is available at https://github.com/sail-sg/LongSpec.

### Cost-Efficient Serving of LLM Agents via Test-Time Plan Caching
**Authors**: Qizheng Zhang, Michael Wornow, Kunle Olukotun

**Updated**: 2025-06-17T04:42:30Z

**Summary**: LLM-based agentic applications have shown increasingly remarkable capabilities in complex workflows but incur substantial costs due to extensive planning and reasoning requirements. Existing LLM caching techniques (like context caching and semantic caching), primarily designed for serving chatbots, are insufficient for agentic applications where outputs depend on external data or environmental contexts. We propose agentic plan caching, a novel approach that extracts, stores, adapts, and reuses structured plan templates from planning stages of agentic applications across semantically similar tasks to reduce the cost of serving. Unlike traditional semantic caching, our system extracts plan templates from completed agent executions at test-time, employs keyword extraction to match new requests against cached plans, and utilizes lightweight models to adapt these templates to task-specific plans with contexts. Evaluation across multiple real-world agentic applications shows that our system can reduce costs by 46.62% on average while maintaining performance, offering a more efficient solution for serving LLM-based agents that complements existing LLM serving infrastructures.

### CXLMemSim: A pure software simulated CXL.mem for performance   characterization
**Authors**: Yiwei Yang, Brian Zhao, Yusheng Zheng, Pooneh Safayenikoo, Tanvir Ahmed Khan, Andi Quinn

**Updated**: 2025-06-17T04:00:42Z

**Summary**: CXLMemSim is a fast, lightweight simulation framework that enables performance characterization of memory systems based on Compute Express Link (CXL) .mem technology. CXL.mem allows disaggregation and pooling of memory to mitigate memory stranding (underutilized memory trapped on fully loaded servers) in cloud and datacenter environments. However, CXL-attached memory introduces additional latency and bandwidth constraints compared to local DRAM, and real CXL .mem hardware is not yet widely available for empirical evaluation. CXLMemSim addresses this gap by attaching to unmodified applications and simulating CXL-based memory pools in software. It operates by tracing memory allocations and accesses using efficient kernel probes and hardware performance counters, dividing execution into epochs, and injecting timing delays to emulate various CXL .mem latency/bandwidth characteristics. This approach incurs modest runtime overhead while preserving realistic load/store memory access patterns. We implement CXLMemSim on commodity hardware without special devices, and our evaluation shows that it runs orders of magnitude faster than cycle-accurate simulators (e.g., Gem5) for real-world workloads, while accurately modeling the performance impact of CXL .mem. We demonstrate use cases where CXLMemSim enables experimentation with memory pooling configurations, scheduling policies, data migration strategies, and caching techniques that were previously infeasible to evaluate at scale. Key findings include the viability of software-based CXL .mem emulation with low overhead, insights into latency and congestion effects in memory pools, and guidance for system designers to optimize memory disaggregation. Overall, CXLMemSim provides a practical and extensible platform for researchers and practitioners to explore CXL.mem innovations before real hardware becomes commonplace.

### Batch-Max: Higher LLM Throughput using Larger Batch Sizes and KV Cache   Compression
**Authors**: Michael R. Metel, Boxing Chen, Mehdi Rezagholizadeh

**Updated**: 2025-06-17T02:24:51Z

**Summary**: Several works have developed eviction policies to remove key-value (KV) pairs from the KV cache for more efficient inference. The focus has been on compressing the KV cache after the input prompt has been processed for faster token generation. In settings with limited GPU memory, and when the input context is longer than the generation length, we show that by also compressing the KV cache during the input processing phase, larger batch sizes can be used resulting in significantly higher throughput while still maintaining the original model's accuracy.

### All-optical electric field sensing with nanodiamond-doped polymer thin   films
**Authors**: Roy Styles, Mengke Han, Toon Goris, James Partridge, Brett C. Johnson, Blanca del Rosal, Amanda N. Abraham, Heike Ebendorff-Heidepriem, Brant C. Gibson, Nikolai Dontschuk, Jean-Philippe Tetienne, Philipp Reineck

**Updated**: 2025-06-17T00:26:21Z

**Summary**: The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center is a photoluminescent defect in diamond that exists in different charge states, NV$^-$ and NV$^0$, that are sensitive to the NV's nanoscale environment. Here, we show that photoluminescence (PL) from NV centers in fluorescent nanodiamonds (FNDs) can be employed for all-optical voltage sensing based on electric field-induced NV charge state modulation. More than 95% of FNDs integrated into a capacitor device show a transient increase in NV$^-$ PL intensity of up to 31% within 0.1 ms after application of an external voltage, accompanied by a simultaneous decrease in NV$^0$ PL. The change in NV$^-$ PL increases with increasing applied voltage from 0 to 100 V, corresponding to an electric field of 0 to 625 kV cm$^ {-1}$ in our devices. The electric field sensitivity of a single FND is 19 V cm$^{-1}$ Hz$^ {-1/2}$. We investigate the NV charge state photodynamics on the millisecond timescale and find that the change in NV PL strongly depends on the rate of photoexcitation. We propose a model that qualitatively explains the observed changes in NV PL based on an electric field-induced redistribution of photoexcited electrons from substitutional nitrogen defects to NV centers, leading to a transient conversion of NV$^0$ to NV$^-$ centers upon application of an external voltage. Our results contribute to the development of FNDs as reliable, all-optical, nanoscale electric field sensors in solid-state systems.

### glass: ordered set data structure for client-side order books
**Authors**: Viktor Krapivensky

**Updated**: 2025-06-16T20:46:20Z

**Summary**: The "ordered set" abstract data type with operations "insert", "erase", "find", "min", "max", "next" and "prev" is ubiquitous in computer science. It is usually implemented with red-black trees, $B$-trees, or $B^+$-trees. We present our implementation of ordered set based on a trie. It only supports integer keys (as opposed to keys of any strict weakly ordered type) and is optimized for market data, namely for what we call sequential locality. The following is the list of what we believe to be novelties:   * Cached path to exploit sequential locality, and fast truncation thereof on erase operation;   * A hash table (or, rather, a cache table) with hard O(1) time guarantees on any operation to speed up key lookup (up to a pre-leaf node);   * Hardware-accelerated "find next/previous set bit" operations with BMI2 instruction set extension on x86-64;   * Order book-specific features: the preemption principle and the tree restructure operation that prevent the tree from consuming too much memory.   We achieve the following speedups over C++'s standard std::map container: 6x-20x on modifying operations, 30x on lookup operations, 9x-15x on real market data, and a more modest 2x-3x speedup on iteration. In this paper, we discuss our implementation.

### Cache-Aided Variable-Length Coding with Perfect Privacy
**Authors**: Amirreza Zamani, Mikael Skoglund

**Updated**: 2025-06-16T17:17:38Z

**Summary**: A cache-aided compression problem with perfect privacy is studied, where a server has access to a database of $N$ files, $(Y_1,...,Y_N)$, each of size $F$ bits. The server is connected to $K$ users through a shared link, where each user has access to a local cache of size $MF$ bits. In the placement phase, the server fills the users$'$ caches without prior knowledge of their future demands, while the delivery phase takes place after the users send their demands to the server. We assume that each file $Y_i$ is arbitrarily correlated with a private attribute $X$, and an adversary is assumed to have access to the shared link. The users and the server have access to a shared secret key $W$. The goal is to design the cache contents and the delivered message $\cal C$ such that the average length of $\mathcal{C}$ is minimized, while satisfying: i. The response $\cal C$ does not disclose any information about $X$, i.e., $X$ and $\cal C$ are statistically independent yielding $I(X;\mathcal{C})=0$, which corresponds to the perfect privacy constraint; ii. User $i$ is able to decode its demand, $Y_{d_i}$, by using its local cache $Z_i$, delivered message $\cal C$, and the shared secret key $W$. Due to the correlation of database with the private attribute, existing codes for cache-aided delivery do not fulfill the perfect privacy constraint. Indeed, in this work, we propose a lossless variable-length coding scheme that combines privacy-aware compression with coded caching techniques. In particular, we use two-part code construction and Functional Representation Lemma. Furthermore, we propose an alternative coding scheme based on the minimum entropy coupling concept and a greedy entropy-based algorithm. We show that the proposed scheme improves the previous results obtained by Functional Representation Lemma.

### Mixture of Weight-shared Heterogeneous Group Attention Experts for   Dynamic Token-wise KV Optimization
**Authors**: Guanghui Song, Dongping Liao, Yiren Zhao, Kejiang Ye, Cheng-zhong Xu, Xitong Gao

**Updated**: 2025-06-16T14:30:17Z

**Summary**: Transformer models face scalability challenges in causal language modeling (CLM) due to inefficient memory allocation for growing key-value (KV) caches, which strains compute and storage resources. Existing methods like Grouped Query Attention (GQA) and token-level KV optimization improve efficiency but rely on rigid resource allocation, often discarding "low-priority" tokens or statically grouping them, failing to address the dynamic spectrum of token importance. We propose mixSGA, a novel mixture-of-expert (MoE) approach that dynamically optimizes token-wise computation and memory allocation. Unlike prior approaches, mixSGA retains all tokens while adaptively routing them to specialized experts with varying KV group sizes, balancing granularity and efficiency. Our key novelties include: (1) a token-wise expert-choice routing mechanism guided by learned importance scores, enabling proportional resource allocation without token discard; (2) weight-sharing across grouped attention projections to minimize parameter overhead; and (3) an auxiliary loss to ensure one-hot routing decisions for training-inference consistency in CLMs. Extensive evaluations across Llama3, TinyLlama, OPT, and Gemma2 model families show mixSGA's superiority over static baselines. On instruction-following and continued pretraining tasks, mixSGA achieves higher ROUGE-L and lower perplexity under the same KV budgets.

### Block-wise Adaptive Caching for Accelerating Diffusion Policy
**Authors**: Kangye Ji, Yuan Meng, Hanyun Cui, Ye Li, Shengjia Hua, Lei Chen, Zhi Wang

**Updated**: 2025-06-16T13:14:58Z

**Summary**: Diffusion Policy has demonstrated strong visuomotor modeling capabilities, but its high computational cost renders it impractical for real-time robotic control. Despite huge redundancy across repetitive denoising steps, existing diffusion acceleration techniques fail to generalize to Diffusion Policy due to fundamental architectural and data divergences. In this paper, we propose Block-wise Adaptive Caching(BAC), a method to accelerate Diffusion Policy by caching intermediate action features. BAC achieves lossless action generation acceleration by adaptively updating and reusing cached features at the block level, based on a key observation that feature similarities vary non-uniformly across timesteps and locks. To operationalize this insight, we first propose the Adaptive Caching Scheduler, designed to identify optimal update timesteps by maximizing the global feature similarities between cached and skipped features. However, applying this scheduler for each block leads to signiffcant error surges due to the inter-block propagation of caching errors, particularly within Feed-Forward Network (FFN) blocks. To mitigate this issue, we develop the Bubbling Union Algorithm, which truncates these errors by updating the upstream blocks with signiffcant caching errors before downstream FFNs. As a training-free plugin, BAC is readily integrable with existing transformer-based Diffusion Policy and vision-language-action models. Extensive experiments on multiple robotic benchmarks demonstrate that BAC achieves up to 3x inference speedup for free.

### On Immutable Memory Systems for Artificial Agents: A Blockchain-Indexed   Automata-Theoretic Framework Using ECDH-Keyed Merkle Chains
**Authors**: Craig Steven Wright

**Updated**: 2025-06-16T08:43:56Z

**Summary**: This paper presents a formalised architecture for synthetic agents designed to retain immutable memory, verifiable reasoning, and constrained epistemic growth. Traditional AI systems rely on mutable, opaque statistical models prone to epistemic drift and historical revisionism. In contrast, we introduce the concept of the Merkle Automaton, a cryptographically anchored, deterministic computational framework that integrates formal automata theory with blockchain-based commitments. Each agent transition, memory fragment, and reasoning step is committed within a Merkle structure rooted on-chain, rendering it non-repudiable and auditably permanent. To ensure selective access and confidentiality, we derive symmetric encryption keys from ECDH exchanges contextualised by hierarchical privilege lattices. This enforces cryptographic access control over append-only DAG-structured knowledge graphs. Reasoning is constrained by formal logic systems and verified through deterministic traversal of policy-encoded structures. Updates are non-destructive and historied, preserving epistemic lineage without catastrophic forgetting. Zero-knowledge proofs facilitate verifiable, privacy-preserving inclusion attestations. Collectively, this architecture reframes memory not as a cache but as a ledger - one whose contents are enforced by protocol, bound by cryptography, and constrained by formal logic. The result is not an intelligent agent that mimics thought, but an epistemic entity whose outputs are provably derived, temporally anchored, and impervious to post hoc revision. This design lays foundational groundwork for legal, economic, and high-assurance computational systems that require provable memory, unforgeable provenance, and structural truth.

### InfiniSST: Simultaneous Translation of Unbounded Speech with Large   Language Model
**Authors**: Siqi Ouyang, Xi Xu, Lei Li

**Updated**: 2025-06-16T06:38:23Z

**Summary**: Simultaneous translation of unbounded streaming speech remains a challenging problem due to the need for effectively processing the history speech context and past translations so that quality and latency, including computation overhead, can be balanced. Most prior works assume pre-segmented speech, limiting their real-world applicability. In this paper, we propose InfiniSST, a novel approach that formulates SST as a multi-turn dialogue task, enabling seamless translation of unbounded speech. We construct translation trajectories and robust segments from MuST-C with multi-latency augmentation during training and develop a key-value (KV) cache management strategy to facilitate efficient inference. Experiments on MuST-C En-Es, En-De, and En-Zh demonstrate that InfiniSST reduces computation-aware latency by 0.5 to 1 second while maintaining the same translation quality compared to baselines. Ablation studies further validate the contributions of our data construction and cache management strategy. We release the code and demo at https://github.com/LeiLiLab/InfiniSST

### Multipole Attention for Efficient Long Context Reasoning
**Authors**: Coleman Hooper, Sebastian Zhao, Luca Manolache, Sehoon Kim, Michael W. Mahoney, Yakun Sophia Shao, Kurt Keutzer, Amir Gholami

**Updated**: 2025-06-16T03:00:40Z

**Summary**: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown promising accuracy improvements on complex problem-solving tasks. While these models have attained high accuracy by leveraging additional computation at test time, they need to generate long chain-of-thought reasoning in order to think before answering, which requires generating thousands of tokens. While sparse attention methods can help reduce the KV cache pressure induced by this long autoregressive reasoning, these methods can introduce errors which disrupt the reasoning process. Additionally, prior methods often pre-process the input to make it easier to identify the important prompt tokens when computing attention during generation, and this pre-processing is challenging to perform online for newly generated reasoning tokens. Our work addresses these challenges by introducing Multipole Attention, which accelerates autoregressive reasoning by only computing exact attention for the most important tokens, while maintaining approximate representations for the remaining tokens. Our method first performs clustering to group together semantically similar key vectors, and then uses the cluster centroids both to identify important key vectors and to approximate the remaining key vectors in order to retain high accuracy. We design a fast cluster update process to quickly re-cluster the input and previously generated tokens, thereby allowing for accelerating attention to the previous output tokens. We evaluate our method using emerging LRMs such as Qwen-8B, demonstrating that our approach can maintain accuracy on complex reasoning tasks even with aggressive attention sparsity settings. We also provide kernel implementations to demonstrate the practical efficiency gains from our method, achieving up to 4.5$\times$ speedup for attention in long-context reasoning applications. Our code is available at https://github.com/SqueezeAILab/MultipoleAttention.

### Latent Multi-Head Attention for Small Language Models
**Authors**: Sushant Mehta, Raj Dandekar, Rajat Dandekar, Sreedath Panat

**Updated**: 2025-06-16T02:57:37Z

**Summary**: We present the first comprehensive study of latent multi-head attention (MLA) for small language models, revealing interesting efficiency-quality trade-offs. Training 30M-parameter GPT models on 100,000 synthetic stories, we benchmark three architectural variants: standard multi-head attention (MHA), MLA, and MLA with rotary positional embeddings (MLA+RoPE). Our key finding is that MLA+RoPE with half-rank latent dimensions (r = d/2) achieves a 45% KV-cache memory reduction while incurring only a 0.3% increase in validation loss (essentially matching MHA quality)- a Pareto improvement for memory constrained deployment. We further show that RoPE is crucial for MLA in small models: without it, MLA underperforms vanilla attention by 3-5%, but with RoPE, it surpasses vanilla by 2%. Inference benchmarks on NVIDIA A100 GPUs reveal that MLA with r=d/2 achieves a 1.4 times speedup over full-rank MLA while maintaining the memory savings. GPT-4 evaluations corroborate perplexity results, with ours achieving the highest quality scores (7.4/10) across grammar, creativity, and consistency metrics. Code and models will be released upon acceptance.

### BLITZSCALE: Fast and Live Large Model Autoscaling with O(1) Host Caching
**Authors**: Dingyan Zhang, Haotian Wang, Yang Liu, Xingda Wei, Yizhou Shan, Rong Chen, Haibo Chen

**Updated**: 2025-06-15T13:04:14Z

**Summary**: Model autoscaling is the key mechanism to achieve serverless model-as-a-service, but it faces a fundamental trade-off between scaling speed and storage/memory usage to cache parameters, and cannot meet frequent scaling requirements across multiple hosts. The key problem is that data plane performance is slow, and scaled instances remain stopped while parameters are loading. In this paper, we first show that the data plane can be made fast with no or O(1) caching by loading parameters through the compute network between GPUs because: (1) its speed is comparable to host cache and is underutilized, and (2) scaling multiple instances requires no or O(1) caching with network-optimized multicast. Second, autoscaling can be made live by breaking the scaling abstraction for inference from a coarse-grained instance-level to a fine-grained layer-level. This allows us to offload the layer computation from the overloaded serving instances to the scaled ones without waiting for the parameters to be fully loaded. Under real-world workloads, our system BLITZSCALE achieves up to 94 % lower tail latency reductions compared to state-of-the-art autoscaling system (ServerlessLLM), and it reduces the GPU time used for serving by 49 % when compared with serving systems that do not support autoscaling like DistServe and vLLM with the same service-level-agreement.

### I Know What You Said: Unveiling Hardware Cache Side-Channels in Local   Large Language Model Inference
**Authors**: Zibo Gao, Junjie Hu, Feng Guo, Yixin Zhang, Yinglong Han, Siyuan Liu, Haiyang Li, Zhiqiang Lv

**Updated**: 2025-06-15T08:41:09Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) that can be deployed locally have recently gained popularity for privacy-sensitive tasks, with companies such as Meta, Google, and Intel playing significant roles in their development. However, the security of local LLMs through the lens of hardware cache side-channels remains unexplored. In this paper, we unveil novel side-channel vulnerabilities in local LLM inference: token value and token position leakage, which can expose both the victim's input and output text, thereby compromising user privacy. Specifically, we found that adversaries can infer the token values from the cache access patterns of the token embedding operation, and deduce the token positions from the timing of autoregressive decoding phases. To demonstrate the potential of these leaks, we design a novel eavesdropping attack framework targeting both open-source and proprietary LLM inference systems. The attack framework does not directly interact with the victim's LLM and can be executed without privilege.   We evaluate the attack on a range of practical local LLM deployments (e.g., Llama, Falcon, and Gemma), and the results show that our attack achieves promising accuracy. The restored output and input text have an average edit distance of 5.2% and 17.3% to the ground truth, respectively. Furthermore, the reconstructed texts achieve average cosine similarity scores of 98.7% (input) and 98.0% (output).

### ReFrame: Layer Caching for Accelerated Inference in Real-Time Rendering
**Authors**: Lufei Liu, Tor M. Aamodt

**Updated**: 2025-06-14T20:17:43Z

**Summary**: Graphics rendering applications increasingly leverage neural networks in tasks such as denoising, supersampling, and frame extrapolation to improve image quality while maintaining frame rates. The temporal coherence inherent in these tasks presents an opportunity to reuse intermediate results from previous frames and avoid redundant computations. Recent work has shown that caching intermediate features to be reused in subsequent inferences is an effective method to reduce latency in diffusion models. We extend this idea to real-time rendering and present ReFrame, which explores different caching policies to optimize trade-offs between quality and performance in rendering workloads. ReFrame can be applied to a variety of encoder-decoder style networks commonly found in rendering pipelines. Experimental results show that we achieve 1.4x speedup on average with negligible quality loss in three real-time rendering tasks.

With the number of IoT devices expected to exceed 40 billion by 2030, traditional cloud-based systems are increasingly constrained by bandwidth, latency, and energy limitations. This paper leverages the ROOF (Real-time Onsite Operations Facilitation) framework with decentralized computing at intermediary fog and peripheral edge network layers to reduce latency by processing data near its point of origin. ROOF features fog caching to avoid redundancy, ultra-low-power wireless transmission for energy savings, and AI-driven resource allocation for efficiency. Security is enhanced through TLS encryption, blockchain-based authentication, and edge-level access control. Case studies from Bhubaneswar, Barcelona and Copenhagen validate the use of ROOF in traffic systems and environmental monitoring. The paper concludes by outlining key challenges and prospects of AI-driven analytics in smart urban infrastructure.

**Updated**: 2025-06-14T13:16:31Z

**Summary**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) plays a pivotal role in modern large language model applications, with numerous existing frameworks offering a wide range of functionalities to facilitate the development of RAG systems. However, we have identified several persistent challenges in these frameworks, including difficulties in algorithm reproduction and sharing, lack of new techniques, and high system overhead. To address these limitations, we introduce \textbf{FlexRAG}, an open-source framework specifically designed for research and prototyping. FlexRAG supports text-based, multimodal, and network-based RAG, providing comprehensive lifecycle support alongside efficient asynchronous processing and persistent caching capabilities. By offering a robust and flexible solution, FlexRAG enables researchers to rapidly develop, deploy, and share advanced RAG systems.

**Authors**: Tianze Wang, Yifei Liu, Chen Chen, Pengfei Zuo, Jiawei Zhang, Qizhen Weng, Yin Chen, Zhenhua Han, Jieru Zhao, Quan Chen, Minyi Guo

**Updated**: 2025-06-14T06:36:54Z

**Summary**: Modern AI clusters, which host diverse workloads like data pre-processing, training and inference, often store the large-volume data in cloud storage and employ caching frameworks to facilitate remote data access. To avoid code-intrusion complexity and minimize cache space wastage, it is desirable to maintain a unified cache shared by all the workloads. However, existing cache management strategies, designed for specific workloads, struggle to handle the heterogeneous AI workloads in a cluster -- which usually exhibit heterogeneous access patterns and item storage granularities. In this paper, we propose IGTCache, a unified, high-efficacy cache for modern AI clusters. IGTCache leverages a hierarchical access abstraction, AccessStreamTree, to organize the recent data accesses in a tree structure, facilitating access pattern detection at various granularities. Using this abstraction, IGTCache applies hypothesis testing to categorize data access patterns as sequential, random, or skewed. Based on these detected access patterns and granularities, IGTCache tailors optimal cache management strategies including prefetching, eviction, and space allocation accordingly. Experimental results show that IGTCache increases the cache hit ratio by 55.6% over state-of-the-art caching frameworks, reducing the overall job completion time by 52.2%.

### ClusterKV: Manipulating LLM KV Cache in Semantic Space for Recallable   Compression
**Authors**: Guangda Liu, Chengwei Li, Jieru Zhao, Chenqi Zhang, Minyi Guo

**Updated**: 2025-06-14T06:17:33Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely deployed in a variety of applications, and the context length is rapidly increasing to handle tasks such as long-document QA and complex logical reasoning. However, long context poses significant challenges for inference efficiency, including high memory costs of key-value (KV) cache and increased latency due to extensive memory accesses. Recent works have proposed compressing KV cache to approximate computation, but these methods either evict tokens permanently, never recalling them for later inference, or recall previous tokens at the granularity of pages divided by textual positions. Both approaches degrade the model accuracy and output quality. To achieve efficient and accurate recallable KV cache compression, we introduce ClusterKV, which recalls tokens at the granularity of semantic clusters. We design and implement efficient algorithms and systems for clustering, selection, indexing and caching. Experiment results show that ClusterKV attains negligible accuracy loss across various tasks with 32k context lengths, using only a 1k to 2k KV cache budget, and achieves up to a 2$\times$ speedup in latency and a 2.5$\times$ improvement in decoding throughput. Compared to SoTA recallable KV compression methods, ClusterKV demonstrates higher model accuracy and output quality, while maintaining or exceeding inference efficiency. Our code is available at https://github.com/sjtu-zhao-lab/ClusterKV.

### Federated Learning Assisted Edge Caching Scheme Based on Lightweight   Architecture DDPM
**Authors**: Xun Li, Qiong Wu, Pingyi Fan, Kezhi Wang, Nan Cheng, Khaled B. Letaief

**Updated**: 2025-06-14T00:52:10Z

**Summary**: Edge caching is an emerging technology that empowers caching units at edge nodes, allowing users to fetch contents of interest that have been pre-cached at the edge nodes. The key to pre-caching is to maximize the cache hit percentage for cached content without compromising users' privacy. In this letter, we propose a federated learning (FL) assisted edge caching scheme based on lightweight architecture denoising diffusion probabilistic model (LDPM). Our simulation results verify that our proposed scheme achieves a higher cache hit percentage compared to existing FL-based methods and baseline methods.

### R-KV: Redundancy-aware KV Cache Compression for Reasoning Models
**Authors**: Zefan Cai, Wen Xiao, Hanshi Sun, Cheng Luo, Yikai Zhang, Ke Wan, Yucheng Li, Yeyang Zhou, Li-Wen Chang, Jiuxiang Gu, Zhen Dong, Anima Anandkumar, Abedelkadir Asi, Junjie Hu

**Updated**: 2025-06-13T21:01:43Z

**Summary**: Reasoning models have demonstrated impressive performance in self-reflection and chain-of-thought reasoning. However, they often produce excessively long outputs, leading to prohibitively large key-value (KV) caches during inference. While chain-of-thought inference significantly improves performance on complex reasoning tasks, it can also lead to reasoning failures when deployed with existing KV cache compression approaches. To address this, we propose Redundancy-aware KV Cache Compression for Reasoning models (R-KV), a novel method specifically targeting redundant tokens in reasoning models. Our method preserves nearly 100% of the full KV cache performance using only 10% of the KV cache, substantially outperforming existing KV cache baselines, which reach only 60% of the performance. Remarkably, R-KV even achieves 105% of full KV cache performance with 16% of the KV cache. This KV-cache reduction also leads to a 90% memory saving and a 6.6X throughput over standard chain-of-thought reasoning inference. Experimental results show that R-KV consistently outperforms existing KV cache compression baselines across two mathematical reasoning datasets.

### Cartridges: Lightweight and general-purpose long context representations   via self-study
**Authors**: Sabri Eyuboglu, Ryan Ehrlich, Simran Arora, Neel Guha, Dylan Zinsley, Emily Liu, Will Tennien, Atri Rudra, James Zou, Azalia Mirhoseini, Christopher Re

**Updated**: 2025-06-13T17:58:55Z

**Summary**: Large language models are often used to answer queries grounded in large text corpora (e.g. codebases, legal documents, or chat histories) by placing the entire corpus in the context window and leveraging in-context learning (ICL). Although current models support contexts of 100K-1M tokens, this setup is costly to serve because the memory consumption of the KV cache scales with input length. We explore an alternative: training a smaller KV cache offline on each corpus. At inference time, we load this trained KV cache, which we call a Cartridge, and decode a response. Critically, the cost of training a Cartridge can be amortized across all the queries referencing the same corpus. However, we find that the naive approach of training the Cartridge with next-token prediction on the corpus is not competitive with ICL. Instead, we propose self-study, a training recipe in which we generate synthetic conversations about the corpus and train the Cartridge with a context-distillation objective. We find that Cartridges trained with self-study replicate the functionality of ICL, while being significantly cheaper to serve. On challenging long-context benchmarks, Cartridges trained with self-study match ICL performance while using 38.6x less memory and enabling 26.4x higher throughput. Self-study also extends the model's effective context length (e.g. from 128k to 484k tokens on MTOB) and surprisingly, leads to Cartridges that can be composed at inference time without retraining.

### CnC-PRAC: Coalesce, not Cache, Per Row Activation Counts for an   Efficient in-DRAM Rowhammer Mitigation
**Authors**: Chris S. Lin, Jeonghyun Woo, Prashant J. Nair, Gururaj Saileshwar

**Updated**: 2025-06-13T17:28:38Z

**Summary**: JEDEC has introduced the Per Row Activation Counting (PRAC) framework for DDR5 and future DRAMs to enable precise counting of DRAM row activations using per-row activation counts. While recent PRAC implementations enable holistic mitigation of Rowhammer attacks, they impose slowdowns of up to 10% due to the increased DRAM timings for performing a read-modify-write of the counter. Alternatively, recent work, Chronus, addresses these slowdowns, but incurs energy overheads due to the additional DRAM activations for counters. In this paper, we propose CnC-PRAC, a PRAC implementation that addresses both performance and energy overheads. Unlike prior works focusing on caching activation counts to reduce their overheads, our key idea is to reorder and coalesce accesses to activation counts located in the same physical row. Our design achieves this by decoupling counter access from the critical path of data accesses. This enables optimizations such as buffering counter read-modify-write requests and coalescing requests to the same row. Together, these enable a reduction in row activations for counter accesses by almost 75%-83% compared to state-of-the-art solutions like Chronus and enable a PRAC implementation with negligible slowdown and a minimal dynamic energy overhead of 0.84%-1% compared to insecure DDR5 DRAM.

**Authors**: Xiaoran Liu, Siyang He, Qiqi Wang, Ruixiao Li, Yuerong Song, Zhigeng Liu, Linlin Li, Qun Liu, Zengfeng Huang, Qipeng Guo, Ziwei He, Xipeng Qiu

**Updated**: 2025-06-13T15:35:54Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models struggle with memory demands from the growing Key-Value (KV) cache as context lengths increase. Existing compression methods homogenize head dimensions or rely on attention-guided token pruning, often sacrificing accuracy or introducing computational overhead. We propose FourierAttention, a training-free framework that exploits the heterogeneous roles of transformer head dimensions: lower dimensions prioritize local context, while upper ones capture long-range dependencies. By projecting the long-context-insensitive dimensions onto orthogonal Fourier bases, FourierAttention approximates their temporal evolution with fixed-length spectral coefficients. Evaluations on LLaMA models show that FourierAttention achieves the best long-context accuracy on LongBench and Needle-In-A-Haystack (NIAH). Besides, a custom Triton kernel, FlashFourierAttention, is designed to optimize memory via streamlined read-write operations, enabling efficient deployment without performance compromise.

### FlashBack:Efficient Retrieval-Augmented Language Modeling for Long   Context Inference
**Authors**: Runheng Liu, Xingchen Xiao, Heyan Huang, Zewen Chi, Zhijing Wu

**Updated**: 2025-06-13T08:32:26Z

**Summary**: Retrieval-Augmented Language Modeling (RALM) by integrating large language models (LLM) with relevant documents from an external corpus is a proven method for enabling the LLM to generate information beyond the scope of its pre-training corpus. Previous work utilizing retrieved content by simply prepending it to the input poses a high runtime issue, which degrades the inference efficiency of the LLMs because they fail to use the Key-Value (KV) cache efficiently. In this paper, we propose FlashBack, a modular RALM designed to improve the inference efficiency of RALM with appending context pattern while maintaining decent performance after fine-tuning by Low-Rank Adaption. FlashBack appends retrieved documents at the end of the context for efficiently utilizing the KV cache instead of prepending them. And we introduce Marking Token as two special prompt tokens for marking the boundary of the appending context during fine-tuning. Our experiments on testing generation quality show that FlashBack can remain decent generation quality in perplexity. And the inference speed of FlashBack is up to $4\times$ faster than the prepending counterpart on a 7B LLM (Llama 2) in the runtime test. Via bypassing unnecessary re-computation, it demonstrates an advancement by achieving significantly faster inference speed, and this heightened efficiency will substantially reduce inferential cost.

**Authors**: Mahir Labib Dihan, Mohammed Eunus Ali, Md Rizwan Parvez

**Updated**: 2025-06-13T07:04:46Z

**Summary**: Mapping and navigation services like Google Maps, Apple Maps, OpenStreetMap, are essential for accessing various location-based data, yet they often struggle to handle natural language geospatial queries. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in question answering (QA), but creating reliable geospatial QA datasets from map services remains challenging. We introduce MapQaTor, an extensible open-source framework that streamlines the creation of reproducible, traceable map-based QA datasets. MapQaTor enables seamless integration with any maps API, allowing users to gather and visualize data from diverse sources with minimal setup. By caching API responses, the platform ensures consistent ground truth, enhancing the reliability of the data even as real-world information evolves. MapQaTor centralizes data retrieval, annotation, and visualization within a single platform, offering a unique opportunity to evaluate the current state of LLM-based geospatial reasoning while advancing their capabilities for improved geospatial understanding. Evaluation metrics show that, MapQaTor speeds up the annotation process by at least 30 times compared to manual methods, underscoring its potential for developing geospatial resources, such as complex map reasoning datasets.

### Lag-Relative Sparse Attention In Long Context Training
**Authors**: Manlai Liang, Wanyi Huang, Mandi Liu, Huaijun Li, Jinlong Li

**Updated**: 2025-06-13T06:49:53Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant strides in natural language processing and generation, yet their ability to handle long-context input remains constrained by the quadratic complexity of attention computation and linear-increasing key-value memory footprint. To reduce computational costs and memory, key-value cache compression techniques are commonly applied at inference time, but this often leads to severe performance degradation, as models are not trained to handle compressed context. Although there are more sophisticated compression methods, they are typically unsuitable for post-training because of their incompatibility with gradient-based optimization or high computation overhead. To fill this gap with no additional parameter and little computation overhead, we propose Lag-Relative Sparse Attention(LRSA) anchored by the LagKV compression method for long context post-training. Our method performs chunk-by-chunk prefilling, which selects the top K most relevant key-value pairs in a fixed-size lagging window, allowing the model to focus on salient historical context while maintaining efficiency. Experimental results show that our approach significantly enhances the robustness of the LLM with key-value compression and achieves better fine-tuned results in the question-answer tuning task.

### Electric field control of third-order nonlinear Hall effect
**Authors**: Jiaju Yang, Lujun Wei, Yanghui Li, Lina Chen, Wei Niu, Jiarui Chen, Jun Du, Yong Pu

**Updated**: 2025-06-13T02:54:42Z

**Summary**: The third-order nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE) serves as a sensitive probe of energy band geometric property, providing a new paradigm for revealing the Berry curvature distribution and topological response of quantum materials. In the Weyl semimetal TaIrTe4, we report for the first time that the sign of the third-order NLHE reverses with decreasing temperature. Through scaling law analysis, we think that the third-order NLHE at high (T > 23 K) and low (T < 23 K) temperatures is dominated by Berry-connection polarizability (BCP) and impurity scattering, respectively. The third-order NLHE response strength can be effectively modulated by an additional applied in-plane constant electric field. At the high temperature region, the BCP reduction induced by the electric field leads to a decrease in the third-order NLHE response strength, while at the low temperature region, the electric field cause both BCP and impurity scattering effects to weaken, resulting in a more significant modulation of the third-order NLHE response strength. At 4 K and an electric field strength of 0.3 kV/cm, the modulated relative response strength could reach up to 65.3%. This work provides a new means to explore the third-order NLHE and a valuable reference for the development of novel electronic devices.

### Efficient Long-Context LLM Inference via KV Cache Clustering
**Authors**: Jie Hu, Shengnan Wang, Yutong He, Ping Gong, Jiawei Yi, Juncheng Zhang, Youhui Bai, Renhai Chen, Gong Zhang, Cheng Li, Kun Yuan

**Updated**: 2025-06-13T02:36:15Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) with extended context windows have become increasingly prevalent for tackling complex tasks. However, the substantial Key-Value (KV) cache required for long-context LLMs poses significant deployment challenges. Existing approaches either discard potentially critical information needed for future generations or offer limited efficiency gains due to high computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce Chelsea, a simple yet effective framework for online KV cache clustering. Our approach is based on the observation that key states exhibit high similarity along the sequence dimension. To enable efficient clustering, we divide the sequence into chunks and propose Chunked Soft Matching, which employs an alternating partition strategy within each chunk and identifies clusters based on similarity. Chelsea then merges the KV cache within each cluster into a single centroid. Additionally, we provide a theoretical analysis of the computational complexity and the optimality of the intra-chunk partitioning strategy. Extensive experiments across various models and long-context benchmarks demonstrate that Chelsea achieves up to 80% reduction in KV cache memory usage while maintaining comparable model performance. Moreover, with minimal computational overhead, Chelsea accelerates the decoding stage of inference by up to 3.19$\times$ and reduces end-to-end latency by up to 2.72$\times$.

### Accelerating Diffusion Large Language Models with SlowFast Sampling: The   Three Golden Principles
**Authors**: Qingyan Wei, Yaojie Zhang, Zhiyuan Liu, Dongrui Liu, Linfeng Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-06-13T02:28:47Z

**Summary**: Diffusion-based language models (dLLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to traditional autoregressive LLMs by enabling parallel token generation and significantly reducing inference latency. However, existing sampling strategies for dLLMs, such as confidence-based or semi-autoregressive decoding, often suffer from static behavior, leading to suboptimal efficiency and limited flexibility. In this paper, we propose SlowFast Sampling, a novel dynamic sampling strategy that adaptively alternates between exploratory and accelerated decoding stages. Our method is guided by three golden principles: certainty principle, convergence principle, and positional principle, which govern when and where tokens can be confidently and efficiently decoded. We further integrate our strategy with dLLM-Cache to reduce redundant computation. Extensive experiments across benchmarks and models show that SlowFast Sampling achieves up to 15.63$\times$ speedup on LLaDA with minimal accuracy drop, and up to 34.22$\times$ when combined with caching. Notably, our approach outperforms strong autoregressive baselines like LLaMA3 8B in throughput, demonstrating that well-designed sampling can unlock the full potential of dLLMs for fast and high-quality generation.

### A4: Microarchitecture-Aware LLC Management for Datacenter Servers with   Emerging I/O Devices
**Authors**: Haneul Park, Jiaqi Lou, Sangjin Lee, Yifan Yuan, Kyoung Soo Park, Yongseok Son, Ipoom Jeong, Nam Sung Kim

**Updated**: 2025-06-12T21:57:27Z

**Summary**: In modern server CPUs, the Last-Level Cache (LLC) serves not only as a victim cache for higher-level private caches but also as a buffer for low-latency DMA transfers between CPU cores and I/O devices through Direct Cache Access (DCA). However, prior work has shown that high-bandwidth network-I/O devices can rapidly flood the LLC with packets, often causing significant contention with co-running workloads. One step further, this work explores hidden microarchitectural properties of the Intel Xeon CPUs, uncovering two previously unrecognized LLC contentions triggered by emerging high-bandwidth I/O devices. Specifically, (C1) DMA-written cache lines in LLC ways designated for DCA (referred to as DCA ways) are migrated to certain LLC ways (denoted as inclusive ways) when accessed by CPU cores, unexpectedly contending with non-I/O cache lines within the inclusive ways. In addition, (C2) high-bandwidth storage-I/O devices, which are increasingly common in datacenter servers, benefit little from DCA while contending with (latency-sensitive) network-I/O devices within DCA ways. To this end, we present \design, a runtime LLC management framework designed to alleviate both (C1) and (C2) among diverse co-running workloads, using a hidden knob and other hardware features implemented in those CPUs. Additionally, we demonstrate that \design can also alleviate other previously known network-I/O-driven LLC contentions. Overall, it improves the performance of latency-sensitive, high-priority workloads by 51\% without notably compromising that of low-priority workloads.

### SwiftSpec: Ultra-Low Latency LLM Decoding by Scaling Asynchronous   Speculative Decoding
**Authors**: Ziyi Zhang, Ziheng Jiang, Chengquan Jiang, Menghan Yu, Size Zheng, Haibin Lin, Henry Hoffmann, Xin Liu

**Updated**: 2025-06-12T21:15:58Z

**Summary**: Low-latency decoding for large language models (LLMs) is crucial for applications like chatbots and code assistants, yet generating long outputs remains slow in single-query settings. Prior work on speculative decoding (which combines a small draft model with a larger target model) and tensor parallelism has each accelerated decoding. However, conventional approaches fail to apply both simultaneously due to imbalanced compute requirements (between draft and target models), KV-cache inconsistencies, and communication overheads under small-batch tensor-parallelism. This paper introduces SwiftSpec, a system that targets ultra-low latency for LLM decoding. SwiftSpec redesigns the speculative decoding pipeline in an asynchronous and disaggregated manner, so that each component can be scaled flexibly and remove draft overhead from the critical path. To realize this design, SwiftSpec proposes parallel tree generation, tree-aware KV cache management, and fused, latency-optimized kernels to overcome the challenges listed above. Across 5 model families and 6 datasets, SwiftSpec achieves an average of 1.75x speedup over state-of-the-art speculative decoding systems and, as a highlight, serves Llama3-70B at 348 tokens/s on 8 Nvidia Hopper GPUs, making it the fastest known system for low-latency LLM serving at this scale.

### Revisiting Main Memory-Based Covert and Side Channel Attacks in the   Context of Processing-in-Memory
**Authors**: F. Nisa Bostanci, Konstantinos Kanellopoulos, Ataberk Olgun, A. Giray Yaglikci, Ismail Emir Yuksel, Nika Mansouri Ghiasi, Zulal Bingol, Mohammad Sadrosadati, Onur Mutlu

**Updated**: 2025-06-12T20:38:42Z

**Summary**: We introduce IMPACT, a set of high-throughput main memory-based timing attacks that leverage characteristics of processing-in-memory (PiM) architectures to establish covert and side channels. IMPACT enables high-throughput communication and private information leakage by exploiting the shared DRAM row buffer. To achieve high throughput, IMPACT (i) eliminates expensive cache bypassing steps required by processor-centric memory-based timing attacks and (ii) leverages the intrinsic parallelism of PiM operations. We showcase two applications of IMPACT. First, we build two covert channels that leverage different PiM approaches (i.e., processing-near-memory and processing-using-memory) to establish high-throughput covert communication channels. Our covert channels achieve 8.2 Mb/s and 14.8 Mb/s communication throughput, respectively, which is 3.6x and 6.5x higher than the state-of-the-art main memory-based covert channel. Second, we showcase a side-channel attack that leaks private information of concurrently-running victim applications with a low error rate. Our source-code is openly and freely available at https://github.com/CMU-SAFARI/IMPACT.

### SelectLLM: Query-Aware Efficient Selection Algorithm for Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Kaushal Kumar Maurya, KV Aditya Srivatsa, Ekaterina Kochmar

**Updated**: 2025-06-12T13:33:52Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely adopted due to their remarkable performance across various applications, driving the accelerated development of a large number of diverse models. However, these individual LLMs show limitations in generalization and performance on complex tasks due to inherent training biases, model size constraints, and the quality or diversity of pre-training datasets. A promising direction is to efficiently harness the diverse capabilities of LLMs to overcome these individual limitations. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel LLM selection algorithm called SelectLLM, which efficiently directs input queries to the most suitable subset of LLMs from a large pool, ensuring that the selected models collectively provide accurate responses. SelectLLM employs a multi-label classifier and policy based on the classifier's predictions and confidence scores in selecting an optimal, query-aware, and lightweight subset of LLMs. Our findings indicate that the proposed model outperforms existing ensemble-based baselines and achieves competitive performance with similarly sized top-performing LLMs while maintaining efficiency. Specifically, it achieves a huge reduction in inference latency on two challenging reasoning benchmarks: 13\% on GSM8K and 70\% on MMLU, compared to the top-performing baseline. Also, we establish a theoretical upper bound by an Oracle with LLMs and perform an in-depth linguistic analysis to understand the performance gap between the Oracle and SelectLLM.

**Authors**: Fanxu Meng, Pingzhi Tang, Xiaojuan Tang, Zengwei Yao, Xing Sun, Muhan Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-06-12T11:45:57Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we present TransMLA, a framework that seamlessly converts any GQA-based pre-trained model into an MLA-based model. Our approach enables direct compatibility with DeepSeek's codebase, allowing these models to fully leverage DeepSeek-specific optimizations such as vLLM and SGlang. By compressing 93% of the KV cache in LLaMA-2-7B, TransMLA achieves a 10.6x inference speedup at an 8K context length while preserving meaningful output quality. Additionally, the model requires only 6 billion tokens for fine-tuning to regain performance on par with the original across multiple benchmarks. TransMLA offers a practical solution for migrating GQA-based models to the MLA structure. When combined with DeepSeek's advanced features, such as FP8 quantization and Multi-Token Prediction, even greater inference acceleration can be realized.

**Summary**: Approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) is a fundamental problem in vector databases and AI infrastructures. Recent graph-based ANNS algorithms have achieved high search accuracy with practical efficiency. Despite the advancements, these algorithms still face performance bottlenecks in production, due to the random memory access patterns of graph-based search and the high computational overheads of vector distance. In addition, the performance of a graph-based ANNS algorithm is highly sensitive to parameters, while selecting the optimal parameters is cost-prohibitive, e.g., manual tuning requires repeatedly re-building the index.   This paper introduces VSAG, an open-source framework that aims to enhance the in production performance of graph-based ANNS algorithms. VSAG has been deployed at scale in the services of Ant Group, and it incorporates three key optimizations: (i) efficient memory access: it reduces L3 cache misses with pre-fetching and cache-friendly vector organization; (ii) automated parameter tuning: it automatically selects performance-optimal parameters without requiring index rebuilding; (iii) efficient distance computation: it leverages modern hardware, scalar quantization, and smartly switches to low-precision representation to dramatically reduce the distance computation costs. We evaluate VSAG on real-world datasets. The experimental results show that VSAG achieves the state-of-the-art performance and provides up to 4x speedup over HNSWlib (an industry-standard library) while ensuring the same accuracy.

### Qronos: Correcting the Past by Shaping the Future... in Post-Training   Quantization
**Authors**: Shihao Zhang, Haoyu Zhang, Ian Colbert, Rayan Saab

**Updated**: 2025-06-12T00:25:14Z

**Summary**: We introduce Qronos -- a new state-of-the-art post-training quantization algorithm that sequentially rounds and updates neural network weights. Qronos not only explicitly corrects errors due to both weight and activation quantization, but also errors resulting from quantizing previous layers. Our iterative algorithm is based on an interpretable and disciplined optimization framework that subsumes and surpasses existing data-driven approaches. At each step, Qronos alternates between error correction and diffusion via optimal update rules. Importantly, we prove that Qronos admits an efficient implementation that uses the Cholesky decomposition for solving least-squares problems. We also demonstrate that Qronos is compatible with existing transformation techniques such as Hadamard-based incoherence processing and weight-activation scaling equalization, among others. We evaluate Qronos using recent autoregressive language generation models in the Llama3 family; Qronos consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art adaptive rounding methods when quantizing the weights, activations, and/or KV caches.

### Squeezed Attention: Accelerating Long Context Length LLM Inference
**Authors**: Coleman Hooper, Sehoon Kim, Hiva Mohammadzadeh, Monishwaran Maheswaran, Sebastian Zhao, June Paik, Michael W. Mahoney, Kurt Keutzer, Amir Gholami

**Updated**: 2025-06-11T22:50:44Z

**Summary**: Emerging Large Language Model (LLM) applications require long input context in order to perform complex tasks like document analysis and code generation. For these long context length applications, the length of the input prompt poses a significant challenge in terms of inference efficiency since the inference costs increase linearly with sequence length. However, for many of these applications, much of the context in the prompt is fixed across different user inputs, thereby providing the opportunity to perform offline optimizations in order to process user inputs quickly, as they are received. We propose Squeezed Attention to accelerate LLM applications where a large portion of the input context is fixed. We first leverage K-means clustering offline to group the keys for the fixed context based on semantic similarity and represent each cluster with a single centroid value. During inference, we compare query tokens from the user input with the centroids to predict which keys from the fixed context are semantically relevant, and then compute exact attention using only the important keys, thereby reducing bandwidth and computational costs. We also present a hierarchical version of our algorithm which can reduce the complexity of attention from linear to logarithmic with respect to the fixed context length. We evaluate our method on long-context benchmarks including LongBench, where it achieves a 3.1$\times$ reduction in KV budget with no noticeable accuracy loss and up to an 8$\times$ reduction with only a 0.5 point accuracy gap for the LLaMA-2-7B-32K, LWM-Text-Chat-1M, and Longchat-7B-v1.5-32K models. Futhermore, we implement kernels for centroid comparison and sparse FlashAttention with important keys, achieving more than 4$\times$ speedups during both the prefill and generation phases for long-context inference. Our code is available at https://github.com/SqueezeAILab/SqueezedAttention.

### ETS: Efficient Tree Search for Inference-Time Scaling
**Authors**: Coleman Hooper, Sehoon Kim, Suhong Moon, Kerem Dilmen, Monishwaran Maheswaran, Nicholas Lee, Michael W. Mahoney, Sophia Shao, Kurt Keutzer, Amir Gholami

**Updated**: 2025-06-11T21:59:20Z

**Summary**: Test-time compute scaling has emerged as a new axis along which to improve model accuracy, where additional computation is used at inference time to allow the model to think longer for more challenging problems. One promising approach for test-time compute scaling is search against a process reward model, where a model generates multiple potential candidates at each step of the search, and these partial trajectories are then scored by a separate reward model in order to guide the search process. The diversity of trajectories in the tree search process affects the accuracy of the search, since increasing diversity promotes more exploration. However, this diversity comes at a cost, as divergent trajectories have less KV sharing, which means they consume more memory and slow down the search process. Previous search methods either do not perform sufficient exploration, or else explore diverse trajectories but have high latency. We address this challenge by proposing Efficient Tree Search (ETS), which promotes KV sharing by pruning redundant trajectories while maintaining necessary diverse trajectories. ETS incorporates a linear programming cost model to promote KV cache sharing by penalizing the number of nodes retained, while incorporating a semantic coverage term into the cost model to ensure that we retain trajectories which are semantically different. We demonstrate how ETS can achieve 1.8$\times$ reduction in average KV cache size during the search process, leading to 1.4$\times$ increased throughput relative to prior state-of-the-art methods, with minimal accuracy degradation and without requiring any custom kernel implementation. Code is available at: https://github.com/SqueezeAILab/ETS.

### EfficientVLA: Training-Free Acceleration and Compression for   Vision-Language-Action Models
**Authors**: Yantai Yang, Yuhao Wang, Zichen Wen, Luo Zhongwei, Chang Zou, Zhipeng Zhang, Chuan Wen, Linfeng Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-06-11T18:34:57Z

**Summary**: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, particularly diffusion-based architectures, demonstrate transformative potential for embodied intelligence but are severely hampered by high computational and memory demands stemming from extensive inherent and inference-time redundancies. While existing acceleration efforts often target isolated inefficiencies, such piecemeal solutions typically fail to holistically address the varied computational and memory bottlenecks across the entire VLA pipeline, thereby limiting practical deployability. We introduce EfficientVLA, a structured and training-free inference acceleration framework that systematically eliminates these barriers by cohesively exploiting multifaceted redundancies. EfficientVLA synergistically integrates three targeted strategies: (1) pruning of functionally inconsequential layers from the language module, guided by an analysis of inter-layer redundancies; (2) optimizing the visual processing pathway through a task-aware strategy that selects a compact, diverse set of visual tokens, balancing task-criticality with informational coverage; and (3) alleviating temporal computational redundancy within the iterative diffusion-based action head by strategically caching and reusing key intermediate features. We apply our method to a standard VLA model CogACT, yielding a 1.93X inference speedup and reduces FLOPs to 28.9%, with only a 0.6% success rate drop in the SIMPLER benchmark.

### Mainframe-style channel controllers for modern disaggregated memory   systems
**Authors**: Zikai Liu, Jasmin Schult, Pengcheng Xu, Timothy Roscoe

**Updated**: 2025-06-11T14:03:13Z

**Summary**: Despite the promise of alleviating the main memory bottleneck, and the existence of commercial hardware implementations, techniques for Near-Data Processing have seen relatively little real-world deployment. The idea has received renewed interest with the appearance of disaggregated or "far" memory, for example in the use of CXL memory pools.   However, we argue that the lack of a clear OS-centric abstraction of Near-Data Processing is a major barrier to adoption of the technology. Inspired by the channel controllers which interface the CPU to disk drives in mainframe systems, we propose memory channel controllers as a convenient, portable, and virtualizable abstraction of Near-Data Processing for modern disaggregated memory systems.   In addition to providing a clean abstraction that enables OS integration while requiring no changes to CPU architecture, memory channel controllers incorporate another key innovation: they exploit the cache coherence provided by emerging interconnects to provide a much richer programming model, with more fine-grained interaction, than has been possible with existing designs.

**Summary**: Minibeam and microbeam radiation therapy promise improved treatment outcomes through reduced normal tissue toxicity at better tumor control rates. The lack of suitable compact radiation sources limits the clinical application of minibeams to superficial tumors and renders it impossible for microbeams. We developed and constructed the first prototype of a compact line-focus X-ray tube (LFXT) with technology potentially suitable for clinical translation of minibeams and microbeams. We give an overview of the commissioning process preceding the first operation, present optical and radiological focal spot characterization methods, and dosimetric measurements. Additionally, we report on first preclinical in vitro cell and in vivo mouse brain irradiations conducted with the LFXT prototype. The focal spot characterization resulted in a strongly eccentric electron distribution with a width of 72.3 $\mu$m. Dosimetry showed sharp microbeam dose profiles with steep lateral penumbras and a peak-to-valley dose ratio above 10 throughout a 70 mm thick PMMA phantom. An open-field dose rate of 4.3 Gy/s was measured at an acceleration voltage of 150 kV and a beam current of 17.4 mA at 150 mm distance from the focal spot. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated the feasibility of the LFXT for minibeam and microbeam applications with field sizes of 1.5-2 cm. The mice displayed no observable side effects throughout the follow-up period after whole-brain 260 $\mu$m-minibeam irradiation. We successfully constructed and commissioned the first proof-of-concept LFXT prototype. Dosimetric characterizations of the achieved microbeam field showed the superiority of the LFXT compared to conventional X-ray tubes in terms of beam quality. In future developments, the remaining limitations of the prototype will be addressed for improved minibeam and first ever microbeam radiation therapy in a clinical setting.

### NestQuant: Nested Lattice Quantization for Matrix Products and LLMs
**Authors**: Semyon Savkin, Eitan Porat, Or Ordentlich, Yury Polyanskiy

**Updated**: 2025-06-11T06:01:15Z

**Summary**: Post-training quantization (PTQ) has emerged as a critical technique for efficient deployment of large language models (LLMs). This work proposes NestQuant, a novel PTQ scheme for weights and activations that is based on self-similar nested lattices. Recent works have mathematically shown such quantizers to be information-theoretically optimal for low-precision matrix multiplication. We implement a practical low-complexity version of NestQuant based on Gosset lattice, making it a drop-in quantizer for any matrix multiplication step (e.g., in self-attention, MLP etc). For example, NestQuant quantizes weights, KV-cache, and activations of Llama-3-8B to 4 bits, achieving perplexity of 6.6 on wikitext2. This represents more than 55% reduction in perplexity gap with respect to unquantized model (perplexity of 6.14) compared to state-of-the-art Metas SpinQuant (perplexity 7.3), OstQuant (7.3) and QuaRot (8.2). Comparisons on bigger models (up to 70B) and on various LLM evaluation benchmarks confirm uniform superiority of NestQuant.

### SAFEFLOW: A Principled Protocol for Trustworthy and Transactional   Autonomous Agent Systems
**Authors**: Peiran Li, Xinkai Zou, Zhuohang Wu, Ruifeng Li, Shuo Xing, Hanwen Zheng, Zhikai Hu, Yuping Wang, Haoxi Li, Qin Yuan, Yingmo Zhang, Zhengzhong Tu

**Updated**: 2025-06-11T03:14:10Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled powerful autonomous agents capable of complex reasoning and multi-modal tool use. Despite their growing capabilities, today's agent frameworks remain fragile, lacking principled mechanisms for secure information flow, reliability, and multi-agent coordination. In this work, we introduce SAFEFLOW, a new protocol-level framework for building trustworthy LLM/VLM-based agents. SAFEFLOW enforces fine-grained information flow control (IFC), precisely tracking provenance, integrity, and confidentiality of all the data exchanged between agents, tools, users, and environments. By constraining LLM reasoning to respect these security labels, SAFEFLOW prevents untrusted or adversarial inputs from contaminating high-integrity decisions. To ensure robustness in concurrent multi-agent settings, SAFEFLOW introduces transactional execution, conflict resolution, and secure scheduling over shared state, preserving global consistency across agents. We further introduce mechanisms, including write-ahead logging, rollback, and secure caches, that further enhance resilience against runtime errors and policy violations. To validate the performances, we built SAFEFLOWBENCH, a comprehensive benchmark suite designed to evaluate agent reliability under adversarial, noisy, and concurrent operational conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that agents built with SAFEFLOW maintain impressive task performance and security guarantees even in hostile environments, substantially outperforming state-of-the-art. Together, SAFEFLOW and SAFEFLOWBENCH lay the groundwork for principled, robust, and secure agent ecosystems, advancing the frontier of reliable autonomy.

### Autoregressive Adversarial Post-Training for Real-Time Interactive Video   Generation
**Authors**: Shanchuan Lin, Ceyuan Yang, Hao He, Jianwen Jiang, Yuxi Ren, Xin Xia, Yang Zhao, Xuefeng Xiao, Lu Jiang

**Updated**: 2025-06-11T03:04:23Z

**Summary**: Existing large-scale video generation models are computationally intensive, preventing adoption in real-time and interactive applications. In this work, we propose autoregressive adversarial post-training (AAPT) to transform a pre-trained latent video diffusion model into a real-time, interactive video generator. Our model autoregressively generates a latent frame at a time using a single neural function evaluation (1NFE). The model can stream the result to the user in real time and receive interactive responses as controls to generate the next latent frame. Unlike existing approaches, our method explores adversarial training as an effective paradigm for autoregressive generation. This not only allows us to design an architecture that is more efficient for one-step generation while fully utilizing the KV cache, but also enables training the model in a student-forcing manner that proves to be effective in reducing error accumulation during long video generation. Our experiments demonstrate that our 8B model achieves real-time, 24fps, streaming video generation at 736x416 resolution on a single H100, or 1280x720 on 8xH100 up to a minute long (1440 frames).

### ScalableHD: Scalable and High-Throughput Hyperdimensional Computing   Inference on Multi-Core CPUs
**Authors**: Dhruv Parikh, Viktor Prasanna

**Updated**: 2025-06-10T22:46:12Z

**Summary**: Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC) is a brain-inspired computing paradigm that represents and manipulates information using high-dimensional vectors, called hypervectors (HV). Traditional HDC methods, while robust to noise and inherently parallel, rely on single-pass, non-parametric training and often suffer from low accuracy. To address this, recent approaches adopt iterative training of base and class HVs, typically accelerated on GPUs. Inference, however, remains lightweight and well-suited for real-time execution. Yet, efficient HDC inference has been studied almost exclusively on specialized hardware such as FPGAs and GPUs, with limited attention to general-purpose multi-core CPUs. To address this gap, we propose ScalableHD for scalable and high-throughput HDC inference on multi-core CPUs. ScalableHD employs a two-stage pipelined execution model, where each stage is parallelized across cores and processes chunks of base and class HVs. Intermediate results are streamed between stages using a producer-consumer mechanism, enabling on-the-fly consumption and improving cache locality. To maximize performance, ScalableHD integrates memory tiling and NUMA-aware worker-to-core binding. Further, it features two execution variants tailored for small and large batch sizes, each designed to exploit compute parallelism based on workload characteristics while mitigating the memory-bound compute pattern that limits HDC inference performance on modern multi-core CPUs. ScalableHD achieves up to 10x speedup in throughput (samples per second) over state-of-the-art baselines such as TorchHD, across a diverse set of tasks ranging from human activity recognition to image classification, while preserving task accuracy. Furthermore, ScalableHD exhibits robust scalability: increasing the number of cores yields near-proportional throughput improvements.

### A Stable Whitening Optimizer for Efficient Neural Network Training
**Authors**: Kevin Frans, Sergey Levine, Pieter Abbeel

**Updated**: 2025-06-10T22:01:14Z

**Summary**: In this work, we take an experimentally grounded look at neural network optimization. Building on the Shampoo family of algorithms, we identify and alleviate three key issues, resulting in the proposed SPlus method. First, we find that naive Shampoo is prone to divergence when matrix-inverses are cached for long periods. We introduce an alternate bounded update combining a historical eigenbasis with instantaneous normalization, resulting in across-the-board stability and significantly lower computational requirements. Second, we adapt a shape-aware scaling to enable learning rate transfer across network width. Third, we find that high learning rates result in large parameter noise, and propose a simple iterate-averaging scheme which unblocks faster learning. To properly confirm these findings, we introduce a pointed Transformer training benchmark, considering three objectives (language modelling, image classification, and diffusion modelling) across different stages of training. On average, SPlus is able to reach the validation performance of Adam within 44% of the gradient steps and 62% of the wallclock time.

### MagCache: Fast Video Generation with Magnitude-Aware Cache
**Authors**: Zehong Ma, Longhui Wei, Feng Wang, Shiliang Zhang, Qi Tian

**Updated**: 2025-06-10T17:59:02Z

**Summary**: Existing acceleration techniques for video diffusion models often rely on uniform heuristics or time-embedding variants to skip timesteps and reuse cached features. These approaches typically require extensive calibration with curated prompts and risk inconsistent outputs due to prompt-specific overfitting. In this paper, we introduce a novel and robust discovery: a unified magnitude law observed across different models and prompts. Specifically, the magnitude ratio of successive residual outputs decreases monotonically and steadily in most timesteps while rapidly in the last several steps. Leveraging this insight, we introduce a Magnitude-aware Cache (MagCache) that adaptively skips unimportant timesteps using an error modeling mechanism and adaptive caching strategy. Unlike existing methods requiring dozens of curated samples for calibration, MagCache only requires a single sample for calibration. Experimental results show that MagCache achieves 2.1x and 2.68x speedups on Open-Sora and Wan 2.1, respectively, while preserving superior visual fidelity. It significantly outperforms existing methods in LPIPS, SSIM, and PSNR, under comparable computational budgets.

### STI-SNN: A 0.14 GOPS/W/PE Single-Timestep Inference FPGA-based SNN   Accelerator with Algorithm and Hardware Co-Design
**Authors**: Kainan Wang, Chengyi Yang, Chengting Yu, Yee Sin Ang, Bo Wang, Aili Wang

**Updated**: 2025-06-10T14:29:02Z

**Summary**: Brain-inspired Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have attracted attention for their event-driven characteristics and high energy efficiency. However, the temporal dependency and irregularity of spikes present significant challenges for hardware parallel processing and data reuse, leading to some existing accelerators falling short in processing latency and energy efficiency. To overcome these challenges, we introduce the STI-SNN accelerator, designed for resource-constrained applications with high energy efficiency, flexibility, and low latency. The accelerator is designed through algorithm and hardware co-design. Firstly, STI-SNN can perform inference in a single timestep. At the algorithm level, we introduce a temporal pruning approach based on the temporal efficient training (TET) loss function. This approach alleviates spike disappearance during timestep reduction, maintains inference accuracy, and expands TET's application. In hardware design, we analyze data access patterns and adopt the output stationary (OS) dataflow, eliminating the need to store membrane potentials and access memory operations. Furthermore, based on the OS dataflow, we propose a compressed and sorted representation of spikes, then cached in the line buffer to reduce the memory access cost and improve reuse efficiency. Secondly, STI-SNN supports different convolution methods. By adjusting the computation mode of processing elements (PEs) and parameterizing the computation array, STI-SNN can accommodate lightweight models based on depthwise separable convolutions (DSCs), further enhancing hardware flexibility. Lastly, STI-SNN also supports both inter-layer and intra-layer parallel processing. For inter-layer parallelism, we ...

### Activated LoRA: Fine-tuned LLMs for Intrinsics
**Authors**: Kristjan Greenewald, Luis Lastras, Thomas Parnell, Vraj Shah, Lucian Popa, Giulio Zizzo, Chulaka Gunasekara, Ambrish Rawat, David Cox

**Updated**: 2025-06-10T13:50:34Z

**Summary**: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a highly efficient framework for finetuning the weights of large foundation models, and has become the go-to method for data-driven customization of LLMs. Despite the promise of highly customized behaviors and capabilities, switching between relevant LoRAs in a multiturn setting is inefficient, as the key-value (KV) cache of the entire turn history must be recomputed with the LoRA weights before generation can begin. To address this problem, we propose Activated LoRA (aLoRA), an adapter architecture which modifies the LoRA framework to only adapt weights for the tokens in the sequence \emph{after} the aLoRA is invoked. This change crucially allows aLoRA to accept the base model's KV cache of the input string, meaning that aLoRA can be instantly activated whenever needed in a chain without recomputing the cache. This enables building what we call \emph{intrinsics}, i.e. specialized models invoked to perform well-defined operations on portions of an input chain or conversation that otherwise uses the base model by default. We train a set of aLoRA-based intrinsics models, demonstrating competitive accuracy with standard LoRA while achieving significant inference benefits. The codebase is at https://github.com/IBM/activated-lora.

### LiftVSR: Lifting Image Diffusion to Video Super-Resolution via Hybrid   Temporal Modeling with Only 4$\times$RTX 4090s
**Authors**: Xijun Wang, Xin Li, Bingchen Li, Zhibo Chen

**Updated**: 2025-06-10T07:49:33Z

**Summary**: Diffusion models have significantly advanced video super-resolution (VSR) by enhancing perceptual quality, largely through elaborately designed temporal modeling to ensure inter-frame consistency. However, existing methods usually suffer from limited temporal coherence and prohibitively high computational costs (e.g., typically requiring over 8 NVIDIA A100-80G GPUs), especially for long videos. In this work, we propose LiftVSR, an efficient VSR framework that leverages and elevates the image-wise diffusion prior from PixArt-$\alpha$, achieving state-of-the-art results using only 4$\times$RTX 4090 GPUs. To balance long-term consistency and efficiency, we introduce a hybrid temporal modeling mechanism that decomposes temporal learning into two complementary components: (i) Dynamic Temporal Attention (DTA) for fine-grained temporal modeling within short frame segment ($\textit{i.e.}$, low complexity), and (ii) Attention Memory Cache (AMC) for long-term temporal modeling across segments ($\textit{i.e.}$, consistency). Specifically, DTA identifies multiple token flows across frames within multi-head query and key tokens to warp inter-frame contexts in the value tokens. AMC adaptively aggregates historical segment information via a cache unit, ensuring long-term coherence with minimal overhead. To further stabilize the cache interaction during inference, we introduce an asymmetric sampling strategy that mitigates feature mismatches arising from different diffusion sampling steps. Extensive experiments on several typical VSR benchmarks have demonstrated that LiftVSR achieves impressive performance with significantly lower computational costs.

### Draft-based Approximate Inference for LLMs
**Authors**: Kevin Galim, Ethan Ewer, Wonjun Kang, Minjae Lee, Hyung Il Koo, Kangwook Lee

**Updated**: 2025-06-10T02:37:46Z

**Summary**: Optimizing inference for long-context Large Language Models (LLMs) is increasingly important due to the quadratic compute and linear memory complexity of Transformers. Existing approximation methods, such as key-value (KV) cache dropping, sparse attention, and prompt compression, typically rely on rough predictions of token or KV pair importance. We propose a novel framework for approximate LLM inference that leverages small draft models to more accurately predict the importance of tokens and KV pairs. Specifically, we introduce two instantiations of our proposed framework: (i) SpecKV, which leverages a draft output to accurately assess the importance of each KV pair for more effective KV cache dropping, and (ii) SpecPC, which uses the draft model's attention activations to identify and discard unimportant prompt tokens. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to use draft models for approximate LLM inference acceleration, extending their utility beyond traditional lossless speculative decoding. We motivate our methods with theoretical and empirical analyses, and show a strong correlation between the attention patterns of draft and target models. Extensive experiments on long-context benchmarks show that our methods consistently achieve higher accuracy than existing baselines, while preserving the same improvements in memory usage, latency, and throughput. Our code is available at https://github.com/furiosa-ai/draft-based-approx-llm.

### GATE: Geometry-Aware Trained Encoding
**Authors**: Jakub Bokšanský, Daniel Meister, Carsten Benthin

**Updated**: 2025-06-09T19:13:16Z

**Summary**: The encoding of input parameters is one of the fundamental building blocks of neural network algorithms. Its goal is to map the input data to a higher-dimensional space, typically supported by trained feature vectors. The mapping is crucial for the efficiency and approximation quality of neural networks. We propose a novel geometry-aware encoding called GATE that stores feature vectors on the surface of triangular meshes. Our encoding is suitable for neural rendering-related algorithms, for example, neural radiance caching. It also avoids limitations of previous hash-based encoding schemes, such as hash collisions, selection of resolution versus scene size, and divergent memory access. Our approach decouples feature vector density from geometry density using mesh colors, while allowing for finer control over neural network training and adaptive level-of-detail.

### Self Forcing: Bridging the Train-Test Gap in Autoregressive Video   Diffusion
**Authors**: Xun Huang, Zhengqi Li, Guande He, Mingyuan Zhou, Eli Shechtman

**Updated**: 2025-06-09T17:59:55Z

**Summary**: We introduce Self Forcing, a novel training paradigm for autoregressive video diffusion models. It addresses the longstanding issue of exposure bias, where models trained on ground-truth context must generate sequences conditioned on their own imperfect outputs during inference. Unlike prior methods that denoise future frames based on ground-truth context frames, Self Forcing conditions each frame's generation on previously self-generated outputs by performing autoregressive rollout with key-value (KV) caching during training. This strategy enables supervision through a holistic loss at the video level that directly evaluates the quality of the entire generated sequence, rather than relying solely on traditional frame-wise objectives. To ensure training efficiency, we employ a few-step diffusion model along with a stochastic gradient truncation strategy, effectively balancing computational cost and performance. We further introduce a rolling KV cache mechanism that enables efficient autoregressive video extrapolation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves real-time streaming video generation with sub-second latency on a single GPU, while matching or even surpassing the generation quality of significantly slower and non-causal diffusion models.

### DBudgetKV: Dynamic Budget in KV Cache Compression for Ensuring Optimal   Performance
**Authors**: Xuanfan Ni, Liyan Xu, Chenyang Lyu, Longyue Wang, Mo Yu, Lemao Liu, Fandong Meng, Jie Zhou, Piji Li

**Updated**: 2025-06-09T15:31:53Z

**Summary**: To alleviate memory burden during inference of large language models (LLMs), numerous studies have focused on compressing the KV cache by exploring aspects such as attention sparsity. These techniques are often designed with a pre-defined KV budget; however, as the optimal budget varies by different input lengths and task types, the existence of a fixed budget could result in inconsistent performance accepting inputs of diverse domains. To address this limitation, we propose a new KV cache compression objective: to always ensure the full-cache performance regardless of specific inputs, while maximizing KV cache pruning as much as possible. To achieve this goal, we introduce a novel KV cache compression method dubbed DBudgetKV, which features an attention-based metric to signal when the remaining KV cache is unlikely to match the full-cache performance, then halting the pruning process. Empirical evaluation spanning diverse context lengths, task types, and model sizes suggests that our method achieves lossless KV pruning effectively and robustly, exceeding 25% compression ratio on average. Furthermore, our method is easy to integrate within LLM inference, not only optimizing memory space, but also showing reduced inference time compared to existing methods.

### $d$-Wave Flat Fermi Surface in Altermagnets Enables Maximum   Charge-to-Spin Conversion
**Authors**: Junwen Lai, Tianye Yu, Peitao Liu, Long Liu, Guozhong Xing, Xing-Qiu Chen, Yan Sun

**Updated**: 2025-06-09T12:41:31Z

**Summary**: Altermagnets combine antiferromagnetic order with ferromagnet-like spin splitting, a duality that unlocks ultrafast spin-dependent responses. This unique property creates unprecedented opportunities for spin-current generation, overcoming the intrinsic limitations of conventional spin-transfer and spin-orbit torque approaches in magnetic memory technologies. Here, we establish a fundamental relationship between Fermi surface geometry and time-reversal-odd ($\mathcal{T}$-odd) spin currents in altermagnets through combined model analysis and first-principles calculations. We demonstrate that a $d$-wave altermagnet with a flat Fermi surface can achieve a theoretical upper limit of charge-to-spin conversion efficiency (CSE) of 100%. This mechanism is realized in the newly discovered room-temperature altermagnetic metal KV$_2$O$_2$Se, which exhibits a CSE of $\sim$78% at the charge neutrality point, nearly double that of RuO$_2$, setting a new record for $\mathcal{T}$-odd CSE. Under electron doping, this efficiency further increases to $\sim$98%, approaching the theoretical limit. Our work advances the fundamental understanding of $\mathcal{T}$-odd spin currents via Fermi surface geometry engineering and provides key insights for developing next-generation altermagnet-based memory devices.

### Fast ECoT: Efficient Embodied Chain-of-Thought via Thoughts Reuse
**Authors**: Zhekai Duan, Yuan Zhang, Shikai Geng, Gaowen Liu, Joschka Boedecker, Chris Xiaoxuan Lu

**Updated**: 2025-06-09T11:04:13Z

**Summary**: Embodied Chain-of-Thought (ECoT) reasoning enhances vision-language-action (VLA) models by improving performance and interpretability through intermediate reasoning steps. However, its sequential autoregressive token generation introduces significant inference latency, limiting real-time deployment. We propose Fast ECoT, an inference-time acceleration method that exploits the structured and repetitive nature of ECoT to (1) cache and reuse high-level reasoning across timesteps and (2) parallelise the generation of modular reasoning steps. Additionally, we introduce an asynchronous scheduler that decouples reasoning from action decoding, further boosting responsiveness. Fast ECoT requires no model changes or additional training and integrates easily into existing VLA pipelines. Experiments in both simulation (LIBERO) and real-world robot tasks show up to a 7.5% reduction in latency with comparable or improved task success rate and reasoning faithfulness, bringing ECoT policies closer to practical real-time deployment.

### ParallelComp: Parallel Long-Context Compressor for Length Extrapolation
**Authors**: Jing Xiong, Jianghan Shen, Chuanyang Zheng, Zhongwei Wan, Chenyang Zhao, Chiwun Yang, Fanghua Ye, Hongxia Yang, Lingpeng Kong, Ngai Wong

**Updated**: 2025-06-09T09:48:43Z

**Summary**: Extrapolating ultra-long contexts (text length >128K) remains a major challenge for large language models (LLMs), as most training-free extrapolation methods are not only severely limited by memory bottlenecks, but also suffer from the attention sink, which restricts their scalability and effectiveness in practice. In this work, we propose ParallelComp, a parallel long-context compression method that effectively overcomes the memory bottleneck, enabling 8B-parameter LLMs to extrapolate from 8K to 128K tokens on a single A100 80GB GPU in a training-free setting. ParallelComp splits the input into chunks, dynamically evicting redundant chunks and irrelevant tokens, supported by a parallel KV cache eviction mechanism. Importantly, we present a systematic theoretical and empirical analysis of attention biases in parallel attention-including the attention sink, recency bias, and middle bias-and reveal that these biases exhibit distinctive patterns under ultra-long context settings. We further design a KV cache eviction technique to mitigate this phenomenon. Experimental results show that ParallelComp enables an 8B model (trained on 8K context) to achieve 91.17% of GPT-4's performance under ultra-long contexts, outperforming closed-source models such as Claude-2 and Kimi-Chat. We achieve a 1.76x improvement in chunk throughput, thereby achieving a 23.50x acceleration in the prefill stage with negligible performance loss and pave the way for scalable and robust ultra-long contexts extrapolation in LLMs. We release the code at https://github.com/menik1126/ParallelComp.

### MoQAE: Mixed-Precision Quantization for Long-Context LLM Inference via   Mixture of Quantization-Aware Experts
**Authors**: Wei Tao, Haocheng Lu, Xiaoyang Qu, Bin Zhang, Kai Lu, Jiguang Wan, Jianzong Wang

**Updated**: 2025-06-09T08:16:24Z

**Summary**: One of the primary challenges in optimizing large language models (LLMs) for long-context inference lies in the high memory consumption of the Key-Value (KV) cache. Existing approaches, such as quantization, have demonstrated promising results in reducing memory usage. However, current quantization methods cannot take both effectiveness and efficiency into account. In this paper, we propose MoQAE, a novel mixed-precision quantization method via mixture of quantization-aware experts. First, we view different quantization bit-width configurations as experts and use the traditional mixture of experts (MoE) method to select the optimal configuration. To avoid the inefficiency caused by inputting tokens one by one into the router in the traditional MoE method, we input the tokens into the router chunk by chunk. Second, we design a lightweight router-only fine-tuning process to train MoQAE with a comprehensive loss to learn the trade-off between model accuracy and memory usage. Finally, we introduce a routing freezing (RF) and a routing sharing (RS) mechanism to further reduce the inference overhead. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art KV cache quantization approaches in both efficiency and effectiveness.

### LoRaConnect: Unlocking HTTP Potential on LoRa Backbones for Remote Areas   and Ad-Hoc Networks
**Authors**: Atonu Ghosh, Sudip Misra

**Updated**: 2025-06-09T07:58:19Z

**Summary**: The minimal infrastructure requirements of LoRa make it suitable for deployments in remote and disaster-stricken areas. Concomitantly, the modern era is witnessing the proliferation of web applications in all aspects of human life, including IoT and other network services. Contemporary IoT and network solutions heavily rely on web applications to render services. However, despite the recent research and development pivoted around LoRa, there is still a lack of studies focusing on web application access over LoRa networks. Specifically, technical challenges like payload size limitation, low data rate, and contentions in multi-user setups limit the applicability of LoRa for web applications. Hence, we propose LoRaWeb, which enables web access over LoRa networks. The LoRaWeb hardware tethers a WiFi hotspot to which the client devices connect and access the web pages using a web browser. LoRa backbone of the network handles the web page transmission from the requester and receiver devices. LoRaWeb implements a synchronization procedure to address the aforementioned challenges for effective message exchange between requesters and responders. The system implements a caching mechanism to reduce latency and contention. Additionally, it implements a message-slicing mechanism in the application layer to overcome the hardware limitations on the message length. The actual hardware-based implementation results indicate seamless deployment, and the results indicate an average access time of ~$0.95 S$ for a $1.5 KB$ and ~$6 S$ for a $10 KB$ size web page.

### Graph-KV: Breaking Sequence via Injecting Structural Biases into Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Haoyu Wang, Peihao Wang, Mufei Li, Shikun Liu, Siqi Miao, Zhangyang Wang, Pan Li

**Updated**: 2025-06-09T00:30:08Z

**Summary**: Modern large language models (LLMs) are inherently auto-regressive, requiring input to be serialized into flat sequences regardless of their structural dependencies. This serialization hinders the model's ability to leverage structural inductive biases, especially in tasks such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and reasoning on data with native graph structures, where inter-segment dependencies are crucial. We introduce Graph-KV with the potential to overcome this limitation. Graph-KV leverages the KV-cache of text segments as condensed representations and governs their interaction through structural inductive biases. In this framework, 'target' segments selectively attend only to the KV-caches of their designated 'source' segments, rather than all preceding segments in a serialized sequence. This approach induces a graph-structured block mask, sparsifying attention and enabling a message-passing-like step within the LLM. Furthermore, strategically allocated positional encodings for source and target segments reduce positional bias and context window consumption. We evaluate Graph-KV across three scenarios: (1) seven RAG benchmarks spanning direct inference, multi-hop reasoning, and long-document understanding; (2) Arxiv-QA, a novel academic paper QA task with full-text scientific papers structured as citation ego-graphs; and (3) paper topic classification within a citation network. By effectively reducing positional bias and harnessing structural inductive biases, Graph-KV substantially outperforms baselines, including standard costly sequential encoding, across various settings. Code and the Graph-KV data are publicly available.

### Paged Attention Meets FlexAttention: Unlocking Long-Context Efficiency   in Deployed Inference
**Authors**: Thomas Joshi, Herman Saini, Neil Dhillon, Antoni Viros i Martin, Kaoutar El Maghraoui

**Updated**: 2025-06-08T22:59:20Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) encounter severe memory inefficiencies during long-context inference due to conventional handling of key-value (KV) caches. In this work, we introduce a novel integration of PagedAttention with PyTorch's FlexAttention, addressing internal fragmentation and inefficiencies associated with monolithic KV cache allocations. Implemented within IBM's Foundation Model Stack (FMS), our fused attention kernel efficiently gathers scattered KV data. Our benchmarks on an NVIDIA L4 GPU (24GB) demonstrate significantly reduced inference latency, growing only linearly (~2x) with sequence length from 128 to 2048 tokens when utilizing a global KV cache, compared to exponential latency increases without caching. While peak memory usage remains largely unchanged for single-step evaluations (dominated by model weights and activations), paged attention causes minimal incremental memory usage, observable only at sequence lengths exceeding 2048 tokens due to its power-of-two cache allocations. We open-source the full implementation and discuss its implications for future long-context model deployment.

### MiniKV: Pushing the Limits of LLM Inference via 2-Bit   Layer-Discriminative KV Cache
**Authors**: Akshat Sharma, Hangliang Ding, Jianping Li, Neel Dani, Minjia Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-06-08T21:23:22Z

**Summary**: How to efficiently serve LLMs in practice has become exceptionally challenging due to their prohibitive memory and computation requirements. In this study, we investigate optimizing the KV cache, whose memory footprint poses a critical bottleneck in LLM inference, especially when dealing with long context tasks. To tackle the challenge, we introduce MiniKV, a KV cache optimization method that simultaneously preserves long context task accuracy while significantly reducing KV cache size via a novel 2-bit layer-discriminative KV cache. More importantly, we develop specialized CUDA kernels to make MiniKV compatible with FlashAttention. Experiments on a wide range of long context tasks show that MiniKV effectively achieves 86% KV cache compression ratio while recovering over 98.5% of accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art methods while achieving excellent measured system performance improvements.

### FDC: Fast KV Dimensionality Compression for Efficient LLM Inference
**Authors**: Zeyu Zhang, Haiying Shen

**Updated**: 2025-06-08T20:04:17Z

**Summary**: In large-language models, memory constraints in the Key-Value Cache (KVC) pose a challenge during inference. In this work, we propose FDC, a fast KV dimensionality compression system that eliminates the decompression overhead incurred in the existing KV dimensionality compression system, Palu, and reduces attention time. Moreover, FDC employs adaptive compression, tailoring KV compression rates across heads and layers based on their contributions to inference to maximize overall compression while maintaining an accuracy loss constraint. Additionally, FDC enhances the attention kernel to balance the uneven workloads caused by the adaptive compression approach to further reduce attention computation latency. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that compared to Palu, FDC can reduce Job Completion Time (JCT) by up to 64%, and delivers up to 1.97X throughput under the same latency, while maintaining 99% of the accuracy without compression. When state-of-the-art eviction and quantization methods are combined with FDC, they exhibit similar improvements compared to those combined with Palu. We open-sourced the code.

**Updated**: 2025-06-08T16:07:44Z

**Summary**: Recent nano-technological advances enable the Monolithic 3D (M3D) integration of multiple memory and logic layers in a single chip, allowing for fine-grained connections between layers and significantly alleviating main memory bottlenecks. We show for a variety of workloads, on a state-of-the-art M3D-based system, that the performance and energy bottlenecks shift from main memory to the processor core and cache hierarchy. Therefore, there is a need to revisit current designs that have been conventionally tailored to tackle the memory bottleneck. Based on the insights from our design space exploration, we propose RevaMp3D, introducing five key changes. First, we propose removing the shared last-level cache, as this delivers speedups comparable to or exceeding those from increasing its size or reducing its latency across all workloads. Second, since improving L1 cache latency has a large impact on performance, we reduce L1 latency by leveraging an M3D layout to shorten its wires. Third, we repurpose the area from the removed cache to widen and scale up pipeline structures, accommodating more in-flight requests that are efficiently served by M3D memory. To avoid latency penalties from these larger structures, we leverage M3D layouts. Fourth, to facilitate high thread-level parallelism, we propose a new fine-grained synchronization technique, using M3D's dense inter-layer connectivity. Fifth, we leverage the M3D main memory to mitigate the core bottlenecks. We propose a processor frontend design that memoizes the repetitive fetched, decoded, and reordered instructions, stores them in main memory, and turns off the relevant parts of the core when possible. RevaMp3D provides 1.2x-2.9x speedup and 1.2x-1.4x energy reduction compared to a state-of-the-art M3D system. We also analyze RevaMp3D's design decisions across various memory latencies to facilitate latency-aware design decisions.

### Value Residual Learning
**Authors**: Zhanchao Zhou, Tianyi Wu, Zhiyun Jiang, Fares Obeid, Zhenzhong Lan

**Updated**: 2025-06-08T16:04:59Z

**Summary**: While Transformer models have achieved remarkable success in various domains, the effectiveness of information propagation through deep networks remains a critical challenge. Standard hidden state residuals often fail to adequately preserve initial token-level information in deeper layers. This paper introduces ResFormer, a novel architecture that enhances information flow by incorporating value residual connections in addition to hidden state residuals. And a variant is SVFormer, where all layers share the first layer's value embedding. Comprehensive empirical evidence demonstrates ResFormer achieves equivalent validation loss with 16.11\% fewer model parameters and 20.3\% less training data compared to Transformer, while maintaining similar memory usage and computational cost. Besides, SVFormer reduces KV cache size by nearly half with only a small performance penalty and can be integrated with other KV-efficient methods, yielding further reductions in KV cache, with performance influenced by sequence length and cumulative learning rate.

### Efficient RL-based Cache Vulnerability Exploration by Penalizing Useless   Agent Actions
**Authors**: Kanato Nakanishi, Soramichi Akiyama

**Updated**: 2025-06-08T15:48:16Z

**Summary**: Cache-timing attacks exploit microarchitectural characteristics to leak sensitive data, posing a severe threat to modern systems. Despite its severity, analyzing the vulnerability of a given cache structure against cache-timing attacks is challenging. To this end, a method based on Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been proposed to automatically explore vulnerabilities for a given cache structure. However, a naive RL-based approach suffers from inefficiencies due to the agent performing actions that do not contribute to the exploration. In this paper, we propose a method to identify these useless actions during training and penalize them so that the agent avoids them and the exploration efficiency is improved. Experiments on 17 cache structures show that our training mechanism reduces the number of useless actions by up to 43.08%. This resulted in the reduction of training time by 28\% in the base case and 4.84\% in the geomean compared to a naive RL-based approach.

### Place Protections at the Right Place: Targeted Hardening for   Cryptographic Code against Spectre v1
**Authors**: Yiming Zhu, Wenchao Huang, Yan Xiong

**Updated**: 2025-06-08T09:30:12Z

**Summary**: Spectre v1 attacks pose a substantial threat to security-critical software, particularly cryptographic implementations. Existing software mitigations, however, often introduce excessive overhead by indiscriminately hardening instructions without assessing their vulnerability. We propose an analysis framework that employs a novel fixpoint algorithm to detect Spectre vulnerabilities and apply targeted hardening. The fixpoint algorithm accounts for program behavior changes induced by stepwise hardening, enabling precise, sound and efficient vulnerability detection. This framework also provides flexibility for diverse hardening strategies and attacker models, enabling customized targeted hardening. We instantiate the framework as LightSLH, which hardens program with provable security.   We evaluate LightSLH on cryptographic algorithms from OpenSSL, Libsodium, NaCL and PQClean. Across all experimental cases, LightSLH provides the lowest overhead among current provable protection strategies, including 0\% overhead in 50\% cases. Notably, the analysis of LightSLH reveals two previously unknown security issues: (1) The compiler can introduce risks overlooked by LLSCT, a hardening method proven secure at the LLVM IR level. We successfully construct a side channel by exploiting compiler-inserted stack loads, confirming this risk. (2) Memory access patterns generated by the scatter-gather algorithm still depend on secrets, even for observers with cache line granularity. These findings and results highlight the importance of applying accurate protections to specific instructions.

### Beyond Self-Repellent Kernels: History-Driven Target Towards Efficient   Nonlinear MCMC on General Graphs
**Authors**: Jie Hu, Yi-Ting Ma, Do Young Eun

**Updated**: 2025-06-08T00:52:33Z

**Summary**: We propose a history-driven target (HDT) framework in Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to improve any random walk algorithm on discrete state spaces, such as general undirected graphs, for efficient sampling from target distribution $\boldsymbol{\mu}$. With broad applications in network science and distributed optimization, recent innovations like the self-repellent random walk (SRRW) achieve near-zero variance by prioritizing under-sampled states through transition kernel modifications based on past visit frequencies. However, SRRW's reliance on explicit computation of transition probabilities for all neighbors at each step introduces substantial computational overhead, while its strict dependence on time-reversible Markov chains excludes advanced non-reversible MCMC methods. To overcome these limitations, instead of direct modification of transition kernel, HDT introduces a history-dependent target distribution $\boldsymbol{\pi}[\mathbf{x}]$ to replace the original target $\boldsymbol{\mu}$ in any graph sampler, where $\mathbf{x}$ represents the empirical measure of past visits. This design preserves lightweight implementation by requiring only local information between the current and proposed states and achieves compatibility with both reversible and non-reversible MCMC samplers, while retaining unbiased samples with target distribution $\boldsymbol{\mu}$ and near-zero variance performance. Extensive experiments in graph sampling demonstrate consistent performance gains, and a memory-efficient Least Recently Used (LRU) cache ensures scalability to large general graphs.

### Robustifying Vision-Language Models via Dynamic Token Reweighting
**Authors**: Tanqiu Jiang, Jiacheng Liang, Rongyi Zhu, Jiawei Zhou, Fenglong Ma, Ting Wang

**Updated**: 2025-06-07T19:22:05Z

**Summary**: Large vision-language models (VLMs) are highly vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that exploit visual-textual interactions to bypass safety guardrails. In this paper, we present DTR, a novel inference-time defense that mitigates multimodal jailbreak attacks through optimizing the model's key-value (KV) caches. Rather than relying on curated safety-specific data or costly image-to-text conversion, we introduce a new formulation of the safety-relevant distributional shift induced by the visual modality. This formulation enables DTR to dynamically adjust visual token weights, minimizing the impact of adversarial visual inputs while preserving the model's general capabilities and inference efficiency. Extensive evaluation across diverse VLMs and attack benchmarks demonstrates that \sys outperforms existing defenses in both attack robustness and benign task performance, marking the first successful application of KV cache optimization for safety enhancement in multimodal foundation models. (warning: this paper contains potentially harmful content generated by VLMs.)

### Dialogue Without Limits: Constant-Sized KV Caches for Extended Responses   in LLMs
**Authors**: Ravi Ghadia, Avinash Kumar, Gaurav Jain, Prashant Nair, Poulami Das

**Updated**: 2025-06-07T14:03:06Z

**Summary**: Autoregressive Transformers rely on Key-Value (KV) caching to accelerate inference. However, the linear growth of the KV cache with context length leads to excessive memory consumption and bandwidth constraints. This bottleneck is particularly problematic in real-time applications -- such as chatbots and interactive assistants -- where low latency and high memory efficiency are critical. Existing methods drop distant tokens or compress states in a lossy manner, sacrificing accuracy by discarding vital context or introducing bias.   We propose MorphKV, an inference-time technique that maintains a constant-sized KV cache while preserving accuracy. MorphKV balances long-range dependencies and local coherence during text generation. It eliminates early-token bias while retaining high-fidelity context by adaptively ranking tokens through correlation-aware selection. Unlike heuristic retention or lossy compression, MorphKV iteratively refines the KV cache via lightweight updates guided by attention patterns of recent tokens. This approach captures inter-token correlation with greater accuracy, crucial for tasks like content creation and code generation. Our studies on long-response tasks show 52.9$\%$ memory savings and 18.2$\%$ higher accuracy on average compared to state-of-the-art prior works, enabling efficient real-world deployment.

### Taming Wild Branches: Overcoming Hard-to-Predict Branches using the   Bullseye Predictor
**Authors**: Emet Behrendt, Shing Wai Pun, Prashant J. Nair

**Updated**: 2025-06-07T11:50:11Z

**Summary**: Branch prediction is key to the performance of out-of-order processors. While the CBP-2016 winner TAGE-SC-L combines geometric-history tables, a statistical corrector, and a loop predictor, over half of its remaining mispredictions stem from a small set of hard-to-predict (H2P) branches. These branches occur under diverse global histories, causing repeated thrashing in TAGE and eviction before usefulness counters can mature. Prior work shows that simply enlarging the tables offers only marginal improvement.   We augment a 159 KB TAGE-SC-L predictor with a 28 KB H2P-targeted subsystem called the Bullseye predictor. It identifies problematic PCs using a set-associative H2P Identification Table (HIT) and steers them to one of two branch-specific perceptrons, one indexed by hashed local history and the other by folded global history. A short trial phase tracks head-to-head accuracy in an H2P cache. A branch becomes perceptron-resident only if the perceptron's sustained accuracy and output magnitude exceed dynamic thresholds, after which TAGE updates for that PC are suppressed to reduce pollution. The HIT, cache, and perceptron operate fully in parallel with TAGE-SC-L, providing higher fidelity on the H2P tail. This achieves an average MPKI of 3.4045 and CycWpPKI of 145.09.

### Parallel CPU-GPU Execution for LLM Inference on Constrained GPUs
**Authors**: Jiakun Fan, Yanglin Zhang, Xiangchen Li, Dimitrios S. Nikolopoulos

**Updated**: 2025-06-07T01:36:34Z

**Summary**: Deploying large language models (LLMs) for online inference is often constrained by limited GPU memory, particularly due to the growing KV cache during auto-regressive decoding. Hybrid GPU-CPU execution has emerged as a promising solution by offloading KV cache management and parts of attention computation to the CPU. However, a key bottleneck remains: existing schedulers fail to effectively overlap CPU-offloaded tasks with GPU execution during the latency-critical, bandwidth-bound decode phase. This particularly penalizes real-time, decode-heavy applications (e.g., chat, Chain-of-Thought reasoning) which are currently underserved by existing systems, especially under memory pressure typical of edge or low-cost deployments.   We present APEX, a novel, profiling-informed scheduling strategy that maximizes CPU-GPU parallelism during hybrid LLM inference. Unlike systems relying on static rules or purely heuristic approaches, APEX dynamically dispatches compute across heterogeneous resources by predicting execution times of CPU and GPU subtasks to maximize overlap while avoiding scheduling overheads. We evaluate APEX on diverse workloads and GPU architectures (NVIDIA T4, A10), using LLaMa-2-7B and LLaMa-3.1-8B models. Compared to GPU-only schedulers like VLLM, APEX improves throughput by 84% - 96% on T4 and 11% - 89% on A10 GPUs, while preserving latency. Against the best existing hybrid schedulers, it delivers up to 49% (T4) and 37% (A10) higher throughput in long-output settings. APEX significantly advances hybrid LLM inference efficiency on such memory-constrained hardware and provides a blueprint for scheduling in heterogeneous AI systems, filling a critical gap for efficient real-time LLM applications.

**Summary**: Existing safety assurance research has primarily focused on training-phase alignment to instill safe behaviors into LLMs. However, recent studies have exposed these methods' susceptibility to diverse jailbreak attacks. Concurrently, inference scaling has significantly advanced LLM reasoning capabilities but remains unexplored in the context of safety assurance. Addressing this gap, our work pioneers inference scaling for robust and effective LLM safety against emerging threats. We reveal that conventional inference scaling techniques, despite their success in reasoning tasks, perform poorly in safety contexts, even falling short of basic approaches like Best-of-N Sampling. We attribute this inefficiency to a newly identified challenge, the exploration--efficiency dilemma, arising from the high computational overhead associated with frequent process reward model (PRM) evaluations. To overcome this dilemma, we propose SAFFRON, a novel inference scaling paradigm tailored explicitly for safety assurance. Central to our approach is the introduction of a multifurcation reward model (MRM) that significantly reduces the required number of reward model evaluations. To operationalize this paradigm, we further propose: (i) a partial supervision training objective for MRM, (ii) a conservative exploration constraint to prevent out-of-distribution explorations, and (iii) a Trie-based key--value caching strategy that facilitates cache sharing across sequences during tree search. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method. Additionally, we publicly release our trained multifurcation reward model (Saffron-1) and the accompanying token-level safety reward dataset (Safety4M) to accelerate future research in LLM safety. Our code, model, and data are publicly available at https://github.com/q-rz/saffron , and our project homepage is at https://q-rz.github.io/p/saffron .

### Neural Visibility Cache for Real-Time Light Sampling
**Authors**: Jakub Bokšanský, Daniel Meister

**Updated**: 2025-06-06T09:55:59Z

**Summary**: Direct illumination with many lights is an inherent component of physically-based rendering, remaining challenging, especially in real-time scenarios. We propose an online-trained neural cache that stores visibility between lights and 3D positions. We feed light visibility to weighted reservoir sampling (WRS) to sample a light source. The cache is implemented as a fully-fused multilayer perceptron (MLP) with multi-resolution hash-grid encoding, enabling online training and efficient inference on modern GPUs in real-time frame rates. The cache can be seamlessly integrated into existing rendering frameworks and can be used in combination with other real-time techniques such as spatiotemporal reservoir sampling (ReSTIR).

### Joint Optimization of Triangle Mesh, Material, and Light from Neural   Fields with Neural Radiance Cache
**Authors**: Jiakai Sun, Weijing Zhang, Zhanjie Zhang, Tianyi Chu, Guangyuan Li, Lei Zhao, Wei Xing

**Updated**: 2025-06-06T06:35:52Z

**Summary**: Traditional inverse rendering techniques are based on textured meshes, which naturally adapts to modern graphics pipelines, but costly differentiable multi-bounce Monte Carlo (MC) ray tracing poses challenges for modeling global illumination. Recently, neural fields has demonstrated impressive reconstruction quality but falls short in modeling indirect illumination. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet efficient inverse rendering framework that combines the strengths of both methods. Specifically, given pre-trained neural field representing the scene, we can obtain an initial estimate of the signed distance field (SDF) and create a Neural Radiance Cache (NRC), an enhancement over the traditional radiance cache used in real-time rendering. By using the former to initialize differentiable marching tetrahedrons (DMTet) and the latter to model indirect illumination, we can compute the global illumination via single-bounce differentiable MC ray tracing and jointly optimize the geometry, material, and light through back propagation. Experiments demonstrate that, compared to previous methods, our approach effectively prevents indirect illumination effects from being baked into materials, thus obtaining the high-quality reconstruction of triangle mesh, Physically-Based (PBR) materials, and High Dynamic Range (HDR) light probe.

### RoSTE: An Efficient Quantization-Aware Supervised Fine-Tuning Approach   for Large Language Models
**Authors**: Quan Wei, Chung-Yiu Yau, Hoi-To Wai, Yang Katie Zhao, Dongyeop Kang, Youngsuk Park, Mingyi Hong

**Updated**: 2025-06-06T02:29:18Z

**Summary**: Supervised fine-tuning is a standard method for adapting pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to downstream tasks. Quantization has been recently studied as a post-training technique for efficient LLM deployment. To obtain quantized fine-tuned LLMs, conventional pipelines would first fine-tune the pre-trained models, followed by post-training quantization. This often yields suboptimal performance as it fails to leverage the synergy between fine-tuning and quantization. To effectively realize low-bit quantization of weights, activations and KV caches in LLMs, we propose an algorithm named Rotated Straight-Through-Estimator (RoSTE), which combines quantization-aware supervised fine-tuning (QA-SFT) with an adaptive rotation strategy that identifies an effective rotation configuration to reduce activation outliers. We provide theoretical insights on RoSTE by analyzing its prediction error when applied to an overparameterized least square quantized training problem. Our findings reveal that the prediction error is directly proportional to the quantization error of the converged weights, which can be effectively managed through an optimized rotation configuration. Experiments on Pythia, Qwen and Llama models of different sizes demonstrate the effectiveness of RoSTE. Compared to existing post-SFT quantization baselines, our method consistently achieves superior performances across various tasks and different LLM architectures. Our code is available at https://github.com/OptimAI-Lab/RoSTE.

 ### No Free Lunch: Rethinking Internal Feedback for LLM Reasoning
**Authors**: Yanzhi Zhang, Zhaoxi Zhang, Haoxiang Guan, Yilin Cheng, Yitong Duan, Chen Wang, Yue Wang, Shuxin Zheng, Jiyan He

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T17:59:52Z

**Summary**: Reinforcement learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm for post-training large language models (LLMs) to improve reasoning. Approaches like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) have shown strong results, but they require extensive external supervision. We investigate an alternative class of methods, Reinforcement Learning from Internal Feedback (RLIF), which relies solely on intrinsic model-derived signals instead of external rewards. In particular, we leverage unsupervised reward proxies such as token-level entropy, trajectory-level entropy, and self-certainty. Our theoretical analysis shows these internal objectives are partially equivalent, and we empirically evaluate various RLIF strategies on challenging math reasoning benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that RLIF can boost the reasoning performance of base LLMs at the beginning phase of the training, matching or surpassing RLVR techniques on these tasks. However, when training progresses, performance degrades even below the model before training. Moreover, we find that RLIF yields little improvement for instruction-tuned models, indicating diminishing returns of intrinsic feedback once an LLM is already instruction-tuned. We further analyze this limitation by mixing model weights and explain the reason of RLIF's training behaviors, providing practical guidelines for integrating internal feedback signals into LLM training. We hope our analysis of internal feedback will inform more principled and effective strategies for LLM post-training.

### AQA-Bench: An Interactive Benchmark for Evaluating LLMs' Sequential   Reasoning Ability
**Authors**: Siwei Yang, Bingchen Zhao, Cihang Xie

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T17:57:43Z

**Summary**: This paper introduces AQA-Bench, a novel benchmark to assess the sequential reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in algorithmic contexts, such as depth-first search (DFS). The key feature of our evaluation benchmark lies in its interactive evaluation protocol - for example, in DFS, the availability of each node's connected edge is contingent upon the model's traversal to that node, thereby necessitating the LLM's ability to effectively remember visited nodes and strategize subsequent moves considering the possible environmental feedback in the future steps. We comprehensively build AQA-Bench with three different algorithms, namely binary search, depth-first search, and breadth-first search, and to evaluate the sequential reasoning ability of 14 different LLMs. Our investigations reveal several interesting findings: (1) Closed-source models like GPT-4 and Gemini generally show much stronger sequential reasoning ability, significantly outperforming open-source LLMs. (2) Naively providing in-context examples may inadvertently hurt few-shot performance in an interactive environment due to over-fitting to examples. (3) Instead of using optimal steps from another test case as the in-context example, a very limited number of predecessor steps in the current test case following the optimal policy can substantially boost small models' performance. (4) The performance gap between weak models and strong models is greatly due to the incapability of weak models to start well. (5) The scaling correlation between performance and model size is not always significant, sometimes even showcasing an inverse trend. We hope our study can catalyze future work on advancing the understanding and enhancement of LLMs' capabilities in sequential reasoning. The code is available at https://github.com/UCSC-VLAA/AQA-Bench.

### Fine-Tuning Lowers Safety and Disrupts Evaluation Consistency
**Authors**: Kathleen C. Fraser, Hillary Dawkins, Isar Nejadgholi, Svetlana Kiritchenko

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T17:57:12Z

**Summary**: Fine-tuning a general-purpose large language model (LLM) for a specific domain or task has become a routine procedure for ordinary users. However, fine-tuning is known to remove the safety alignment features of the model, even when the fine-tuning data does not contain any harmful content. We consider this to be a critical failure mode of LLMs due to the widespread uptake of fine-tuning, combined with the benign nature of the "attack". Most well-intentioned developers are likely unaware that they are deploying an LLM with reduced safety. On the other hand, this known vulnerability can be easily exploited by malicious actors intending to bypass safety guardrails. To make any meaningful progress in mitigating this issue, we first need reliable and reproducible safety evaluations. In this work, we investigate how robust a safety benchmark is to trivial variations in the experimental procedure, and the stochastic nature of LLMs. Our initial experiments expose surprising variance in the results of the safety evaluation, even when seemingly inconsequential changes are made to the fine-tuning setup. Our observations have serious implications for how researchers in this field should report results to enable meaningful comparisons in the future.

### Dissecting the SWE-Bench Leaderboards: Profiling Submitters and   Architectures of LLM- and Agent-Based Repair Systems
**Authors**: Matias Martinez, Xavier Franch

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T17:57:08Z

**Summary**: The rapid progress in Automated Program Repair (APR) has been driven by advances in AI, particularly large language models (LLMs) and agent-based systems. SWE-Bench is a recent benchmark designed to evaluate LLM-based repair systems using real issues and pull requests mined from 12 popular open-source Python repositories. Its public leaderboards, SWE-Bench Lite and SWE-Bench Verified, have become central platforms for tracking progress and comparing solutions. However, because the submission process does not require detailed documentation, the architectural design and origin of many solutions remain unclear. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study of all submissions to the SWE-Bench Lite (68 entries) and Verified (79 entries) leaderboards, analyzing 67 unique approaches across dimensions such as submitter type, product availability, LLM usage, and system architecture. Our findings reveal the dominance of proprietary LLMs (especially Claude 3.5/3.7), the presence of both agentic and non-agentic designs, and a contributor base spanning from individual developers to large tech companies.

### High-Dimensional Interlingual Representations of Large Language Models
**Authors**: Bryan Wilie, Samuel Cahyawijaya, Junxian He, Pascale Fung

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T17:55:07Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) trained on massive multilingual datasets hint at the formation of interlingual constructs--a shared subspace in the representation space. However, evidence regarding this phenomenon is mixed, leaving it unclear whether these models truly develop unified interlingual representations, or present a partially aligned constructs. We explore 31 diverse languages varying on their resource-levels, typologies, and geographical regions; and find that multilingual LLMs exhibit inconsistent cross-lingual alignments. To address this, we propose an interlingual representation framework identifying both the shared interlingual semantic subspace and fragmented components, existed due to representational limitations. We introduce Interlingual Local Overlap (ILO) score to quantify interlingual alignment by comparing the local neighborhood structures of high-dimensional representations. We utilize ILO to investigate the impact of single-language fine-tuning on the interlingual representations in multilingual LLMs. Our results indicate that training exclusively on a single language disrupts the alignment in early layers, while freezing these layers preserves the alignment of interlingual representations, leading to improved cross-lingual generalization. These results validate our framework and metric for evaluating interlingual representation, and further underscore that interlingual alignment is crucial for scalable multilingual learning.

### Confidence Scoring for LLM-Generated SQL in Supply Chain Data Extraction
**Authors**: Jiekai Ma, Yikai Zhao

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T17:54:18Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently enabled natural language interfaces that translate user queries into executable SQL, offering a powerful solution for non-technical stakeholders to access structured data. However, one of the limitation that LLMs do not natively express uncertainty makes it difficult to assess the reliability of their generated queries. This paper presents a case study that evaluates multiple approaches to estimate confidence scores for LLM-generated SQL in supply chain data retrieval. We investigated three strategies: (1) translation-based consistency checks; (2) embedding-based semantic similarity between user questions and generated SQL; and (3) self-reported confidence scores directly produced by the LLM. Our findings reveal that LLMs are often overconfident in their own outputs, which limits the effectiveness of self-reported confidence. In contrast, embedding-based similarity methods demonstrate strong discriminative power in identifying inaccurate SQL.

### Hunyuan-GameCraft: High-dynamic Interactive Game Video Generation with   Hybrid History Condition
**Authors**: Jiaqi Li, Junshu Tang, Zhiyong Xu, Longhuang Wu, Yuan Zhou, Shuai Shao, Tianbao Yu, Zhiguo Cao, Qinglin Lu

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T17:50:37Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in diffusion-based and controllable video generation have enabled high-quality and temporally coherent video synthesis, laying the groundwork for immersive interactive gaming experiences. However, current methods face limitations in dynamics, generality, long-term consistency, and efficiency, which limit the ability to create various gameplay videos. To address these gaps, we introduce Hunyuan-GameCraft, a novel framework for high-dynamic interactive video generation in game environments. To achieve fine-grained action control, we unify standard keyboard and mouse inputs into a shared camera representation space, facilitating smooth interpolation between various camera and movement operations. Then we propose a hybrid history-conditioned training strategy that extends video sequences autoregressively while preserving game scene information. Additionally, to enhance inference efficiency and playability, we achieve model distillation to reduce computational overhead while maintaining consistency across long temporal sequences, making it suitable for real-time deployment in complex interactive environments. The model is trained on a large-scale dataset comprising over one million gameplay recordings across over 100 AAA games, ensuring broad coverage and diversity, then fine-tuned on a carefully annotated synthetic dataset to enhance precision and control. The curated game scene data significantly improves the visual fidelity, realism and action controllability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Hunyuan-GameCraft significantly outperforms existing models, advancing the realism and playability of interactive game video generation.

### Detecting LLM-Generated Short Answers and Effects on Learner Performance
**Authors**: Shambhavi Bhushan, Danielle R Thomas, Conrad Borchers, Isha Raghuvanshi, Ralph Abboud, Erin Gatz, Shivang Gupta, Kenneth Koedinger

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T17:47:36Z

**Summary**: The increasing availability of large language models (LLMs) has raised concerns about their potential misuse in online learning. While tools for detecting LLM-generated text exist and are widely used by researchers and educators, their reliability varies. Few studies have compared the accuracy of detection methods, defined criteria to identify content generated by LLM, or evaluated the effect on learner performance from LLM misuse within learning. In this study, we define LLM-generated text within open responses as those produced by any LLM without paraphrasing or refinement, as evaluated by human coders. We then fine-tune GPT-4o to detect LLM-generated responses and assess the impact on learning from LLM misuse. We find that our fine-tuned LLM outperforms the existing AI detection tool GPTZero, achieving an accuracy of 80% and an F1 score of 0.78, compared to GPTZero's accuracy of 70% and macro F1 score of 0.50, demonstrating superior performance in detecting LLM-generated responses. We also find that learners suspected of LLM misuse in the open response question were more than twice as likely to correctly answer the corresponding posttest MCQ, suggesting potential misuse across both question types and indicating a bypass of the learning process. We pave the way for future work by demonstrating a structured, code-based approach to improve LLM-generated response detection and propose using auxiliary statistical indicators such as unusually high assessment scores on related tasks, readability scores, and response duration. In support of open science, we contribute data and code to support the fine-tuning of similar models for similar use cases.

### Any nonincreasing convergence curves are simultaneously possible for   GMRES and weighted GMRES, as well as for left and right preconditioned GMRES
**Authors**: Pierre Matalon, Nicole Spillane

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T17:46:15Z

**Summary**: The convergence of the GMRES linear solver is notoriously hard to predict. A particularly enlightening result by [Greenbaum, Pt\'ak, Strako\v{s}, 1996] is that, given any convergence curve, one can build a linear system for which GMRES realizes that convergence curve. What is even more extraordinary is that the eigenvalues of the problem matrix can be chosen arbitrarily. We build upon this idea to derive novel results about weighted GMRES. We prove that for any linear system and any prescribed convergence curve, there exists a weight matrix M for which weighted GMRES (i.e., GMRES in the inner product induced by M) realizes that convergence curve, and we characterize the form of M. Additionally, we exhibit a necessary and sufficient condition on M for the simultaneous prescription of two convergence curves, one realized by GMRES in the Euclidean inner product, and the other in the inner product induced by M. These results are then applied to infer some properties of preconditioned GMRES when the preconditioner is applied either on the left or on the right. For instance, we show that any two convergence curves are simultaneously possible for left and right preconditioned GMRES.

### Particle Filter Optimization: A Bayesian Approach for Global Stochastic   Optimization
**Authors**: Mostafa Eslami, Maryam Babazadeh

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T17:45:43Z

**Summary**: This paper proposes a novel global optimization algorithm, Particle Filter-Based Optimization (PFO), designed for a class of stochastic optimization problems in which the objective function lacks an analytical form and is subject to noisy evaluations. PFO utilizes the Bayesian inference framework of Particle Filters (PF) by reformulating the optimization task as a state estimation problem. In this context, evaluations of the objective function are interpreted as measurements, and a customized transition model based on covariance ellipsoids is introduced to guide particle propagation. This model serves as a surrogate for classical acquisition functions, equipping the PF framework with local search capabilities and supporting efficient exploration of the global optimum. To mitigate the adverse effects of measurement noise, the Unscented Transform (UT) is employed to approximate the underlying mean of the objective function, enhancing the accuracy of particle updates. The algorithm offers notable improvements over existing stochastic optimization algorithms for black-box multi-modal objective functions. First, PFO provides a fully probabilistic definition of particle weights, enhancing adaptability and robustness. Second, PFO integrates exploration and exploitation within a unified Bayesian framework, ensuring a non-zero probability of sampling from unexplored regions throughout the optimization process. This approach contrasts with traditional particle filter methods that are primarily used for state estimation, and heuristic optimization algorithms that lack theoretical guarantees. The novelty of PFO lies in its unique integration of particle filtering with a dynamic search space prediction, offering a theoretically grounded alternative to acquisition functions in Bayesian Optimization (BO).

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T17:42:13Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we introduce the AI Search Paradigm, a comprehensive blueprint for next-generation search systems capable of emulating human information processing and decision-making. The paradigm employs a modular architecture of four LLM-powered agents (Master, Planner, Executor and Writer) that dynamically adapt to the full spectrum of information needs, from simple factual queries to complex multi-stage reasoning tasks. These agents collaborate dynamically through coordinated workflows to evaluate query complexity, decompose problems into executable plans, and orchestrate tool usage, task execution, and content synthesis. We systematically present key methodologies for realizing this paradigm, including task planning and tool integration, execution strategies, aligned and robust retrieval-augmented generation, and efficient LLM inference, spanning both algorithmic techniques and infrastructure-level optimizations. By providing an in-depth guide to these foundational components, this work aims to inform the development of trustworthy, adaptive, and scalable AI search systems.

### CLEAR-3K: Assessing Causal Explanatory Capabilities in Language Models
**Authors**: Naiming Liu, Richard Baraniuk, Shashank Sonkar

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T17:35:36Z

**Summary**: We introduce CLEAR-3K, a dataset of 3,000 assertion-reasoning questions designed to evaluate whether language models can determine if one statement causally explains another. Each question present an assertion-reason pair and challenge language models to distinguish between semantic relatedness and genuine causal explanatory relationships. Through comprehensive evaluation of 21 state-of-the-art language models (ranging from 0.5B to 72B parameters), we identify two fundamental findings. First, language models frequently confuse semantic similarity with causality, relying on lexical and semantic overlap instead of inferring actual causal explanatory relationships. Second, as parameter size increases, models tend to shift from being overly skeptical about causal relationships to being excessively permissive in accepting them. Despite this shift, performance measured by the Matthews Correlation Coefficient plateaus at just 0.55, even for the best-performing models.Hence, CLEAR-3K provides a crucial benchmark for developing and evaluating genuine causal reasoning in language models, which is an essential capability for applications that require accurate assessment of causal relationships.

### Union Through UNITY: Cosmology with 2,000 SNe Using a Unified Bayesian   Framework
**Authors**: David Rubin, Greg Aldering, Marc Betoule, Andy Fruchter, Xiaosheng Huang, Alex G. Kim, Chris Lidman, Eric Linder, Saul Perlmutter, Pilar Ruiz-Lapuente, Nao Suzuki

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T17:34:15Z

**Summary**: Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) were instrumental in establishing the acceleration of the universe's expansion. By virtue of their combination of distance reach, precision, and prevalence, they continue to provide key cosmological constraints, complementing other cosmological probes. Individual SN surveys cover only over about a factor of two in redshift, so compilations of multiple SN datasets are strongly beneficial. We assemble an up-to-date "Union" compilation of 2087 cosmologically useful SNe Ia from 24 datasets ("Union3"). We take care to put all SNe on the same distance scale and update the light-curve fitting with SALT3 to use the full rest-frame optical. Over the next few years, the number of cosmologically useful SNe Ia will increase by more than a factor of ten, and keeping systematic uncertainties subdominant will be more challenging than ever. We discuss the importance of treating outliers, selection effects, light-curve shape and color populations and standardization relations, unexplained dispersion, and heterogeneous observations simultaneously. We present an updated Bayesian framework, called UNITY1.5 (Unified Nonlinear Inference for Type-Ia cosmologY), that incorporates significant improvements in our ability to model selection effects, standardization, and systematic uncertainties compared to earlier analyses. As an analysis byproduct, we also recover the posterior of the SN-only peculiar-velocity field, although we do not interpret it in this work. We compute updated cosmological constraints with Union3 and UNITY1.5, finding weak 1.7--2.6 sigma tension with LambdaCDM and possible evidence for thawing dark energy (w0 > -1, wa < 0). We release our SN distances, light-curve fits, and UNITY1.5 framework to the community.

### TALE: A Tool-Augmented Framework for Reference-Free Evaluation of Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Sher Badshah, Ali Emami, Hassan Sajjad

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T17:31:59Z

**Summary**: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into real-world, autonomous applications, relying on static, pre-annotated references for evaluation poses significant challenges in cost, scalability, and completeness. We propose Tool-Augmented LLM Evaluation (TALE), a framework to assess LLM outputs without predetermined ground-truth answers. Unlike conventional metrics that compare to fixed references or depend solely on LLM-as-a-judge knowledge, TALE employs an agent with tool-access capabilities that actively retrieves and synthesizes external evidence. It iteratively generates web queries, collects information, summarizes findings, and refines subsequent searches through reflection. By shifting away from static references, TALE aligns with free-form question-answering tasks common in real-world scenarios. Experimental results on multiple free-form QA benchmarks show that TALE not only outperforms standard reference-based metrics for measuring response accuracy but also achieves substantial to near-perfect agreement with human evaluations. TALE enhances the reliability of LLM evaluations in real-world, dynamic scenarios without relying on static references.

### High-accuracy inference using HfO$_x$S$_y$/HfS$_2$ Memristors
**Authors**: Aferdita Xhameni, Antonio Lombardo

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T17:24:58Z

**Summary**: We demonstrate high accuracy classification for handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset ($\sim$98.00$\%$) and RGB images from the CIFAR-10 dataset ($\sim$86.80$\%$) by using resistive memories based on a 2D van-der-Waals semiconductor: hafnium disulfide (HfS$_2$). These memories are fabricated via dry thermal oxidation, forming vertical crossbar HfO$_x$S$_y$/HfS$_2$ devices with a highly-ordered oxide-semiconductor structure. Our devices operate without electroforming or current compliance and exhibit multi-state, non-volatile resistive switching, allowing resistance to be tuned using voltage pulse trains. Using low-energy potentiation and depression pulses (0.7V-0.995V, 160ns-350ns), we achieve 31 ($\sim$5 bits) stable conductance states with high linearity, symmetry, and low variation over 100 cycles. Key performance metrics-such as weight update, quantisation, and retention-are extracted from these experimental devices. These characteristics are used to simulate neural networks with our resistive memories as weights. Neural networks are trained on state-of-the-art (SOTA) digital hardware (CUDA cores) and a baseline inference accuracy is extracted. IBM's Analog Hardware Acceleration Kit (AIHWKIT) is used to modify and remap digital weights in the pretrained network, based on the characteristics of our devices. Simulations account for factors like conductance linearity, device variation, and converter resolution. In both image recognition tasks, we demonstrate excellent performance, similar to SOTA, with only $<$0.07$\%$ and $<$1.00$\%$ difference in inference accuracy for the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets respectively. The forming-free, compliance-free operation, fast switching, low energy consumption, and high accuracy classification demonstrate the potential of HfO$_x$S$_y$/HfS$_2$-based resistive memories for energy-efficient neural network acceleration and neuromorphic computing.

### Central limit theorems under non-stationarity via relative weak   convergence
**Authors**: Nicolai Palm, Thomas Nagler

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T17:21:42Z

**Summary**: Statistical inference for non-stationary data is hindered by the failure of classical central limit theorems (CLTs), not least because there is no fixed Gaussian limit to converge to. To resolve this, we introduce relative weak convergence, an extension of weak convergence that compares a statistic or process to a sequence of evolving processes. Relative weak convergence retains the essential consequences of classical weak convergence and coincides with it under stationarity. Crucially, it applies in general non-stationary settings where classical weak convergence fails. We establish concrete relative CLTs for random vectors and empirical processes, along with sequential, weighted, and bootstrap variants, that parallel the state-of-the-art in stationary settings. Our framework and results offer simple, plug-in replacements for classical CLTs whenever stationarity is untenable, as illustrated by applications in nonparametric trend estimation and hypothesis testing.

### LLMs and Stack Overflow Discussions: Reliability, Impact, and Challenges
**Authors**: Leuson Da Silva, Jordan Samhi, Foutse Khomh

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T17:11:29Z

**Summary**: Since its release in November 2022, ChatGPT has shaken up Stack Overflow, the premier platform for developers queries on programming and software development. Demonstrating an ability to generate instant, human-like responses to technical questions, ChatGPT has ignited debates within the developer community about the evolving role of human-driven platforms in the age of generative AI. Two months after ChatGPT release, Meta released its answer with its own Large Language Model (LLM) called LLaMA: the race was on. We conducted an empirical study analyzing questions from Stack Overflow and using these LLMs to address them. This way, we aim to (i) quantify the reliability of LLMs answers and their potential to replace Stack Overflow in the long term; (ii) identify and understand why LLMs fail; (iii) measure users activity evolution with Stack Overflow over time; and (iv) compare LLMs together. Our empirical results are unequivocal: ChatGPT and LLaMA challenge human expertise, yet do not outperform it for some domains, while a significant decline in user posting activity has been observed. Furthermore, we also discuss the impact of our findings regarding the usage and development of new LLMs and provide guidelines for future challenges faced by users and researchers.

### The MedPerturb Dataset: What Non-Content Perturbations Reveal About   Human and Clinical LLM Decision Making
**Authors**: Abinitha Gourabathina, Yuexing Hao, Walter Gerych, Marzyeh Ghassemi

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T17:09:27Z

**Summary**: Clinical robustness is critical to the safe deployment of medical Large Language Models (LLMs), but key questions remain about how LLMs and humans may differ in response to the real-world variability typified by clinical settings. To address this, we introduce MedPerturb, a dataset designed to systematically evaluate medical LLMs under controlled perturbations of clinical input. MedPerturb consists of clinical vignettes spanning a range of pathologies, each transformed along three axes: (1) gender modifications (e.g., gender-swapping or gender-removal); (2) style variation (e.g., uncertain phrasing or colloquial tone); and (3) format changes (e.g., LLM-generated multi-turn conversations or summaries). With MedPerturb, we release a dataset of 800 clinical contexts grounded in realistic input variability, outputs from four LLMs, and three human expert reads per clinical context. We use MedPerturb in two case studies to reveal how shifts in gender identity cues, language style, or format reflect diverging treatment selections between humans and LLMs. We find that LLMs are more sensitive to gender and style perturbations while human annotators are more sensitive to LLM-generated format perturbations such as clinical summaries. Our results highlight the need for evaluation frameworks that go beyond static benchmarks to assess the similarity between human clinician and LLM decisions under the variability characteristic of clinical settings.

### A Minimalist Method for Fine-tuning Text-to-Image Diffusion Models
**Authors**: Yanting Miao, William Loh, Suraj Kothawade, Pacal Poupart

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T16:59:05Z

**Summary**: Recent work uses reinforcement learning (RL) to fine-tune text-to-image diffusion models, improving text-image alignment and sample quality. However, existing approaches introduce unnecessary complexity: they cache the full sampling trajectory, depend on differentiable reward models or large preference datasets, or require specialized guidance techniques. Motivated by the "golden noise" hypothesis -- that certain initial noise samples can consistently yield superior alignment -- we introduce Noise PPO, a minimalist RL algorithm that leaves the pre-trained diffusion model entirely frozen and learns a prompt-conditioned initial noise generator. Our approach requires no trajectory storage, reward backpropagation, or complex guidance tricks. Extensive experiments show that optimizing the initial noise distribution consistently improves alignment and sample quality over the original model, with the most significant gains at low inference steps. As the number of inference steps increases, the benefit of noise optimization diminishes but remains present. These findings clarify the scope and limitations of the golden noise hypothesis and reinforce the practical value of minimalist RL fine-tuning for diffusion models.

### LaRS: Latent Reasoning Skills for Chain-of-Thought Reasoning
**Authors**: Zifan Xu, Haozhu Wang, Dmitriy Bespalov, Xian Wu, Peter Stone, Yanjun Qi

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T16:50:07Z

**Summary**: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting is a popular in-context learning (ICL) approach for large language models (LLMs), especially when tackling complex reasoning tasks. Traditional ICL approaches construct prompts using examples that contain questions similar to the input question. However, CoT prompting, which includes crucial intermediate reasoning steps (rationales) within its examples, necessitates selecting examples based on these rationales rather than the questions themselves. Existing methods require human experts or pre-trained LLMs to describe the skill, a high-level abstraction of rationales, to guide the selection. These methods, however, are often costly and difficult to scale. Instead, this paper introduces a new approach named Latent Reasoning Skills (LaRS) that employs unsupervised learning to create a latent space representation of rationales, with a latent variable called a reasoning skill. Concurrently, LaRS learns a reasoning policy to determine the required reasoning skill for a given question. Then the ICL examples are selected by aligning the reasoning skills between past examples and the question. This approach is theoretically grounded and compute-efficient, eliminating the need for auxiliary LLM inference or manual prompt design. Empirical results demonstrate that LaRS consistently outperforms SOTA skill-based selection methods, processing example banks four times faster, reducing LLM inferences during the selection stage by half, and showing greater robustness to sub-optimal example banks.

### Do We Need Large VLMs for Spotting Soccer Actions?
**Authors**: Ritabrata Chakraborty, Rajatsubhra Chakraborty, Avijit Dasgupta, Sandeep Chaurasia

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T16:45:54Z

**Summary**: Traditional video-based tasks like soccer action spotting rely heavily on visual inputs, often requiring complex and computationally expensive models to process dense video data. In this work, we propose a shift from this video-centric approach to a text-based task, making it lightweight and scalable by utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) instead of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). We posit that expert commentary, which provides rich, fine-grained descriptions and contextual cues such as excitement and tactical insights, contains enough information to reliably spot key actions in a match. To demonstrate this, we use the SoccerNet Echoes dataset, which provides timestamped commentary, and employ a system of three LLMs acting as judges specializing in outcome, excitement, and tactics. Each LLM evaluates sliding windows of commentary to identify actions like goals, cards, and substitutions, generating accurate timestamps for these events. Our experiments show that this language-centric approach performs effectively in detecting critical match events, providing a lightweight and training-free alternative to traditional video-based methods for action spotting.

### Consistent Sampling and Simulation: Molecular Dynamics with Energy-Based   Diffusion Models
**Authors**: Michael Plainer, Hao Wu, Leon Klein, Stephan Günnemann, Frank Noé

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T16:38:29Z

**Summary**: Diffusion models have recently gained significant attention due to their effectiveness in various scientific domains, including biochemistry. When trained on equilibrium molecular distributions, diffusion models provide both: a generative procedure to sample equilibrium conformations and associated forces derived from the model's scores. However, using the forces for coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations uncovers inconsistencies in the samples generated via classical diffusion inference and simulation, despite both originating from the same model. Particularly at the small diffusion timesteps required for simulations, diffusion models fail to satisfy the Fokker-Planck equation, which governs how the score should evolve over time. We interpret this deviation as an indication of the observed inconsistencies and propose an energy-based diffusion model with a Fokker-Planck-derived regularization term enforcing consistency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on toy systems, alanine dipeptide, and introduce a state-of-the-art transferable Boltzmann emulator for dipeptides that supports simulation and demonstrates enhanced consistency and efficient sampling.

### AerialVG: A Challenging Benchmark for Aerial Visual Grounding by   Exploring Positional Relations
**Authors**: Junli Liu, Qizhi Chen, Zhigang Wang, Yiwen Tang, Yiting Zhang, Chi Yan, Dong Wang, Bin Zhao, Xuelong Li

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T16:30:09Z

**Summary**: Visual grounding (VG) aims to localize target objects in an image based on natural language descriptions. In this paper, we propose AerialVG, a new task focusing on visual grounding from aerial views. Compared to traditional VG, AerialVG poses new challenges, \emph{e.g.}, appearance-based grounding is insufficient to distinguish among multiple visually similar objects, and positional relations should be emphasized. Besides, existing VG models struggle when applied to aerial imagery, where high-resolution images cause significant difficulties. To address these challenges, we introduce the first AerialVG dataset, consisting of 5K real-world aerial images, 50K manually annotated descriptions, and 103K objects. Particularly, each annotation in AerialVG dataset contains multiple target objects annotated with relative spatial relations, requiring models to perform comprehensive spatial reasoning. Furthermore, we propose an innovative model especially for the AerialVG task, where a Hierarchical Cross-Attention is devised to focus on target regions, and a Relation-Aware Grounding module is designed to infer positional relations. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our dataset and method, highlighting the importance of spatial reasoning in aerial visual grounding. The code and dataset will be released.

### Watch and Listen: Understanding Audio-Visual-Speech Moments with   Multimodal LLM
**Authors**: Zinuo Li, Xian Zhang, Yongxin Guo, Mohammed Bennamoun, Farid Boussaid, Girish Dwivedi, Luqi Gong, Qiuhong Ke

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T16:28:03Z

**Summary**: Humans naturally understand moments in a video by integrating visual and auditory cues. For example, localizing a scene in the video like "A scientist passionately speaks on wildlife conservation as dramatic orchestral music plays, with the audience nodding and applauding" requires simultaneous processing of visual, audio, and speech signals. However, existing models often struggle to effectively fuse and interpret audio information, limiting their capacity for comprehensive video temporal understanding. To address this, we present TriSense, a triple-modality large language model designed for holistic video temporal understanding through the integration of visual, audio, and speech modalities. Central to TriSense is a Query-Based Connector that adaptively reweights modality contributions based on the input query, enabling robust performance under modality dropout and allowing flexible combinations of available inputs. To support TriSense's multimodal capabilities, we introduce TriSense-2M, a high-quality dataset of over 2 million curated samples generated via an automated pipeline powered by fine-tuned LLMs. TriSense-2M includes long-form videos and diverse modality combinations, facilitating broad generalization. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of TriSense and its potential to advance multimodal video analysis. Code and dataset will be publicly released.

### Large Language Model Unlearning for Source Code
**Authors**: Xue Jiang, Yihong Dong, Zheng Fang, Yingwei Ma, Tangxinyu Wang, Rongyu Cao, Binhua Li, Zhi Jin, Wenpin Jiao, Yongbin Li, Ge Li

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T16:27:59Z

**Summary**: LLM4SE has demonstrated significant success, but LLMs' potential memorization of sensitive or outdated training data introduces critical risks to legal compliance, software security, and code quality. LLM unlearning techniques, which can eliminate the influence of undesired data from LLMs in a post-training way, present a promising solution to address these concerns. While recent efforts in LLM unlearning show effectiveness in natural language, their applicability to source code remains underexplored. Our empirical study reveals that existing LLM unlearning approaches, when applied to source code, cause severe model utility degradation, rendering models practically unusable for code generation. In this paper, we propose PROD, a novel unlearning approach that enables LLMs to forget undesired code content while effectively preserving their code generation capabilities. PROD suppresses the probability of forget data in LLMs' output distribution while promoting candidate distributional components, enabling the model to jointly learn to forget specific content and retain its general capabilities. To facilitate this study, we establish a benchmark for code unlearning evaluation, which includes three critical downstream tasks: copyrighted code unlearning, insecure code unlearning, and deprecated API unlearning. Our evaluation demonstrates that PROD achieves superior balance between forget quality and model utility compared to existing unlearning approaches across three downstream tasks, while consistently exhibiting improvements when applied to LLMs of varying series. PROD also exhibits superior robustness against adversarial attacks without generating or exposing the data to be forgotten. The results underscore that our approach not only extends the application boundary of unlearning techniques to source code, but also holds significant implications for advancing reliable code generation.

### Watermarking Language Models through Language Models
**Authors**: Agnibh Dasgupta, Abdullah Tanvir, Xin Zhong

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T16:24:13Z

**Summary**: Watermarking the outputs of large language models (LLMs) is critical for provenance tracing, content regulation, and model accountability. Existing approaches often rely on access to model internals or are constrained by static rules and token-level perturbations. Moreover, the idea of steering generative behavior via prompt-based instruction control remains largely underexplored. We introduce a prompt-guided watermarking framework that operates entirely at the input level and requires no access to model parameters or decoding logits. The framework comprises three cooperating components: a Prompting LM that synthesizes watermarking instructions from user prompts, a Marking LM that generates watermarked outputs conditioned on these instructions, and a Detecting LM trained to classify whether a response carries an embedded watermark. This modular design enables dynamic watermarking that adapts to individual prompts while remaining compatible with diverse LLM architectures, including both proprietary and open-weight models. We evaluate the framework over 25 combinations of Prompting and Marking LMs, such as GPT-4o, Mistral, LLaMA3, and DeepSeek. Experimental results show that watermark signals generalize across architectures and remain robust under fine-tuning, model distillation, and prompt-based adversarial attacks, demonstrating the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach.

### Calibrating Pre-trained Language Classifiers on LLM-generated Noisy   Labels via Iterative Refinement
**Authors**: Liqin Ye, Agam Shah, Chao Zhang, Sudheer Chava

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T16:24:07Z

**Summary**: The traditional process of creating labeled datasets is labor-intensive and expensive. Recent breakthroughs in open-source large language models (LLMs) have opened up a new avenue in generating labeled datasets automatically for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, providing an alternative to such an expensive annotation process. However, the reliability of such auto-generated labels remains a significant concern due to inherent inaccuracies. When learning from noisy labels, the model's generalization is likely to be harmed as it is prone to overfit to those label noises. While previous studies in learning from noisy labels mainly focus on synthetic noise and real-world noise, LLM-generated label noise receives less attention. In this paper, we propose SiDyP: Simplex Label Diffusion with Dynamic Prior to calibrate the classifier's prediction, thus enhancing its robustness towards LLM-generated noisy labels. SiDyP retrieves potential true label candidates by neighborhood label distribution in text embedding space and iteratively refines noisy candidates using a simplex diffusion model. Our framework can increase the performance of the BERT classifier fine-tuned on both zero-shot and few-shot LLM-generated noisy label datasets by an average of 7.21% and 7.30% respectively. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SiDyP by conducting extensive benchmarking for different LLMs over a variety of NLP tasks. Our code is available on Github.

### When Can Model-Free Reinforcement Learning be Enough for Thinking?
**Authors**: Josiah P. Hanna, Nicholas E. Corrado

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T16:23:46Z

**Summary**: Recent work on large language models has demonstrated the use of model-free reinforcement learning (RL) to train reasoning-like capabilities. The emergence of "thinking" through model-free RL is interesting as thinking actions neither produce reward nor change the external world state to one where the agent is more likely to get reward. This paper seeks to build a domain-independent understanding of when model-free RL will lead to "thinking" as a strategy for reward maximization. To build this understanding, we first introduce a theoretical model which we call a \textit{thought Markov decision process} (MDP). Thought MDPs minimally extend the classical MDP model to include an abstract notion of thought state and thought action. Using the thought MDP model, we prove the importance of policy initialization in determining whether or not thinking emerges and show formally that thought actions are equivalent to the agent choosing to perform a step of policy improvement before continuing to act. We then show that open-source LLMs satisfy the conditions that our theory predicts are necessary for model-free RL to produce thinking-like behavior. Finally, we hypothesize sufficient conditions that would enable thinking to be learned outside of language generation and introduce a toy domain where a combination of multi-task pre-training and designated thought actions enable more data-efficient RL compared to non-thinking agents.

### Cache Me If You Can: How Many KVs Do You Need for Effective Long-Context   LMs?
**Authors**: Adithya Bhaskar, Alexander Wettig, Tianyu Gao, Yihe Dong, Danqi Chen

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T16:21:12Z

**Summary**: Language models handle increasingly long contexts for tasks such as book summarization, but this leads to growing memory costs for the key-value (KV) cache. Many prior works have proposed ways of discarding KVs from memory, but their approaches are tailored to favorable settings, obscuring caveats like high peak memory and performance degradation, and a fair comparison between methods is difficult. In this paper, we propose the *KV footprint* as a unified metric, which accounts for both the amount of KV entries stored and their lifespan in memory. We evaluate methods based on the smallest footprint they attain while preserving performance in both long-context understanding and generation, with context lengths of up to 128K tokens. This metric reveals the high peak memory of prior KV eviction methods. One class of methods -- *post-fill eviction* -- has a high footprint due to being incompatible with eviction during pre-filling. We adapt these methods to be able to evict KVs during pre-filling, achieving substantially lower KV footprints. We then turn to *recency eviction* methods, wherein we propose PruLong, an end-to-end optimization method for learning which attention heads need to retain the full KV cache and which do not. PruLong saves memory while preserving long-context performance, achieving 12% smaller KV footprint than prior methods while retaining performance in challenging recall tasks. Our paper clarifies the complex tangle of long-context inference methods and paves the way for future development to minimize the KV footprint.

### RGBTrack: Fast, Robust Depth-Free 6D Pose Estimation and Tracking
**Authors**: Teng Guo, Jingjin Yu

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T16:19:28Z

**Summary**: We introduce a robust framework, RGBTrack, for real-time 6D pose estimation and tracking that operates solely on RGB data, thereby eliminating the need for depth input for such dynamic and precise object pose tracking tasks. Building on the FoundationPose architecture, we devise a novel binary search strategy combined with a render-and-compare mechanism to efficiently infer depth and generate robust pose hypotheses from true-scale CAD models. To maintain stable tracking in dynamic scenarios, including rapid movements and occlusions, RGBTrack integrates state-of-the-art 2D object tracking (XMem) with a Kalman filter and a state machine for proactive object pose recovery. In addition, RGBTrack's scale recovery module dynamically adapts CAD models of unknown scale using an initial depth estimate, enabling seamless integration with modern generative reconstruction techniques. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that RGBTrack's novel depth-free approach achieves competitive accuracy and real-time performance, making it a promising practical solution candidate for application areas including robotics, augmented reality, and computer vision.   The source code for our implementation will be made publicly available at https://github.com/GreatenAnoymous/RGBTrack.git.

### Towards Advanced Mathematical Reasoning for LLMs via First-Order Logic   Theorem Proving
**Authors**: Chuxue Cao, Mengze Li, Juntao Dai, Jinluan Yang, Zijian Zhao, Shengyu Zhang, Weijie Shi, Chengzhong Liu, Sirui Han, Yike Guo

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T16:09:56Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising first-order logic (FOL) reasoning capabilities with applications in various areas. However, their effectiveness in complex mathematical reasoning involving multi-step FOL deductions is still under-researched. While LLMs perform competitively on established mathematical reasoning benchmarks, they struggle with multi-step FOL tasks, as demonstrated by Deepseek-Prover-V2-7B's low accuracy (4.2%) on our proposed theorem proving dataset. This issue arises from the limited exploration of diverse proof strategies and the potential for early reasoning mistakes to undermine entire proofs. To address these issues, we propose DREAM, a self-adaptive solution that enhances the Diversity and REAsonability of LLMs' generation strategies. DREAM incorporates an Axiom-Driven Strategy Diversification mechanism to promote varied strategic outcomes and a Sub-Proposition Error Feedback to help LLMs reflect on and correct their proofs. Our contributions include pioneering advancements in LLMs' mathematical reasoning through FOL theorem proving, introducing a novel inference stage solution that improves performance by 0.6% to 6.4%, and providing a curated dataset of 447 mathematical theorems in Lean 4 format for evaluation.

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed across disciplines due to their advanced reasoning and problem solving capabilities. To measure their effectiveness, various benchmarks have been developed that measure aspects of LLM reasoning, comprehension, and problem-solving. While several surveys address LLM evaluation and benchmarks, a domain-specific analysis remains underexplored in the literature. This paper introduces a taxonomy of seven key disciplines, encompassing various domains and application areas where LLMs are extensively utilized. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive review of LLM benchmarks and survey papers within each domain, highlighting the unique capabilities of LLMs and the challenges faced in their application. Finally, we compile and categorize these benchmarks by domain to create an accessible resource for researchers, aiming to pave the way for advancements toward artificial general intelligence (AGI)

### Chain-of-Thought Prompting Obscures Hallucination Cues in Large Language   Models: An Empirical Evaluation
**Authors**: Jiahao Cheng, Tiancheng Su, Jia Yuan, Guoxiu He, Jiawei Liu, Xinqi Tao, Jingwen Xie, Huaxia Li

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T15:49:37Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit \textit{hallucinations}, generating factually incorrect or semantically irrelevant content in response to prompts. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting can mitigate hallucinations by encouraging step-by-step reasoning, but its impact on hallucination detection remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we conduct a systematic empirical evaluation. We begin with a pilot experiment, revealing that CoT reasoning significantly affects the LLM's internal states and token probability distributions. Building on this, we evaluate the impact of various CoT prompting methods on mainstream hallucination detection methods across both instruction-tuned and reasoning-oriented LLMs. Specifically, we examine three key dimensions: changes in hallucination score distributions, variations in detection accuracy, and shifts in detection confidence. Our findings show that while CoT prompting helps reduce hallucination frequency, it also tends to obscure critical signals used for detection, impairing the effectiveness of various detection methods. Our study highlights an overlooked trade-off in the use of reasoning. Code is publicly available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/cot-hallu-detect.

### ScholarSearch: Benchmarking Scholar Searching Ability of LLMs
**Authors**: Junting Zhou, Wang Li, Yiyan Liao, Nengyuan Zhang, Tingjia Miao, Zhihui Qi, Yuhan Wu, Tong Yang

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T15:48:51Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs)' search capabilities have garnered significant attention. Existing benchmarks, such as OpenAI's BrowseComp, primarily focus on general search scenarios and fail to adequately address the specific demands of academic search. These demands include deeper literature tracing and organization, professional support for academic databases, the ability to navigate long-tail academic knowledge, and ensuring academic rigor. Here, we proposed ScholarSearch, the first dataset specifically designed to evaluate the complex information retrieval capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in academic research. ScholarSearch possesses the following key characteristics: Academic Practicality, where question content closely mirrors real academic learning and research environments, avoiding deliberately misleading models; High Difficulty, with answers that are challenging for single models (e.g., Grok DeepSearch or Gemini Deep Research) to provide directly, often requiring at least three deep searches to derive; Concise Evaluation, where limiting conditions ensure answers are as unique as possible, accompanied by clear sources and brief solution explanations, greatly facilitating subsequent audit and verification, surpassing the current lack of analyzed search datasets both domestically and internationally; and Broad Coverage, as the dataset spans at least 15 different academic disciplines. Through ScholarSearch, we expect to more precisely measure and promote the performance improvement of LLMs in complex academic information retrieval tasks. The data is available at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/PKU-DS-LAB/ScholarSearch

### Tower+: Bridging Generality and Translation Specialization in   Multilingual LLMs
**Authors**: Ricardo Rei, Nuno M. Guerreiro, José Pombal, João Alves, Pedro Teixeirinha, Amin Farajian, André F. T. Martins

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T15:30:06Z

**Summary**: Fine-tuning pretrained LLMs has been shown to be an effective strategy for reaching state-of-the-art performance on specific tasks like machine translation. However, this process of adaptation often implies sacrificing general-purpose capabilities, such as conversational reasoning and instruction-following, hampering the utility of the system in real-world applications that require a mixture of skills. In this paper, we introduce Tower+, a suite of models designed to deliver strong performance across both translation and multilingual general-purpose text capabilities. We achieve a Pareto frontier between translation specialization and multilingual general-purpose capabilities by introducing a novel training recipe that builds on Tower (Alves et al., 2024), comprising continued pretraining, supervised fine-tuning, preference optimization, and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards. At each stage of training, we carefully generate and curate data to strengthen performance on translation as well as general-purpose tasks involving code generation, mathematics problem solving, and general instruction-following. We develop models at multiple scales: 2B, 9B, and 72B. Our smaller models often outperform larger general-purpose open-weight and proprietary LLMs (e.g., Llama 3.3 70B, GPT-4o). Our largest model delivers best-in-class translation performance for high-resource languages and top results in multilingual Arena Hard evaluations and in IF-MT, a benchmark we introduce for evaluating both translation and instruction-following. Our findings highlight that it is possible to rival frontier models in general capabilities, while optimizing for specific business domains, such as translation and localization.

### Simultaneous Translation with Offline Speech and LLM Models in CUNI   Submission to IWSLT 2025
**Authors**: Dominik Macháček, Peter Polák

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T15:27:44Z

**Summary**: This paper describes Charles University submission to the Simultaneous Speech Translation Task of the IWSLT 2025. We cover all four language pairs with a direct or cascade approach. The backbone of our systems is the offline Whisper speech model, which we use for both translation and transcription in simultaneous mode with the state-of-the-art simultaneous policy AlignAtt. We further improve the performance by prompting to inject in-domain terminology, and we accommodate context. Our cascaded systems further use EuroLLM for unbounded simultaneous translation. Compared to the Organizers' baseline, our systems improve by 2 BLEU points on Czech to English and 13-22 BLEU points on English to German, Chinese and Japanese on the development sets. Additionally, we also propose a new enhanced measure of speech recognition latency.

### LLM-Based Bot Broadens the Range of Arguments in Online Discussions,   Even When Transparently Disclosed as AI
**Authors**: Valeria Vuk, Cristina Sarasua, Fabrizio Gilardi

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T15:24:31Z

**Summary**: A wide range of participation is essential for democracy, as it helps prevent the dominance of extreme views, erosion of legitimacy, and political polarization. However, engagement in online political discussions often features a limited spectrum of views due to high levels of self-selection and the tendency of online platforms to facilitate exchanges primarily among like-minded individuals. This study examines whether an LLM-based bot can widen the scope of perspectives expressed by participants in online discussions through two pre-registered randomized experiments conducted in a chatroom. We evaluate the impact of a bot that actively monitors discussions, identifies missing arguments, and introduces them into the conversation. The results indicate that our bot significantly expands the range of arguments, as measured by both objective and subjective metrics. Furthermore, disclosure of the bot as AI does not significantly alter these effects. These findings suggest that LLM-based moderation tools can positively influence online political discourse.

### Al-Khwarizmi: Discovering Physical Laws with Foundation Models
**Authors**: Christopher E. Mower, Haitham Bou-Ammar

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T15:22:21Z

**Summary**: Inferring physical laws from data is a central challenge in science and engineering, including but not limited to healthcare, physical sciences, biosciences, social sciences, sustainability, climate, and robotics. Deep networks offer high-accuracy results but lack interpretability, prompting interest in models built from simple components. The Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) method has become the go-to approach for building such modular and interpretable models. SINDy leverages sparse regression with L1 regularization to identify key terms from a library of candidate functions. However, SINDy's choice of candidate library and optimization method requires significant technical expertise, limiting its widespread applicability. This work introduces Al-Khwarizmi, a novel agentic framework for physical law discovery from data, which integrates foundational models with SINDy. Leveraging LLMs, VLMs, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), our approach automates physical law discovery, incorporating prior knowledge and iteratively refining candidate solutions via reflection. Al-Khwarizmi operates in two steps: it summarizes system observations-comprising textual descriptions, raw data, and plots-followed by a secondary step that generates candidate feature libraries and optimizer configurations to identify hidden physics laws correctly. Evaluating our algorithm on over 198 models, we demonstrate state-of-the-art performance compared to alternatives, reaching a 20 percent increase against the best-performing alternative.

### Empowering Near-Field Communications in Low-Altitude Economy with LLM:   Fundamentals, Potentials, Solutions, and Future Directions
**Authors**: Zhuo Xu, Tianyue Zheng, Linglong Dai

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T15:14:29Z

**Summary**: The low-altitude economy (LAE) is gaining significant attention from academia and industry. Fortunately, LAE naturally aligns with near-field communications in extremely large-scale MIMO (XL-MIMO) systems. By leveraging near-field beamfocusing, LAE can precisely direct beam energy to unmanned aerial vehicles, while the additional distance dimension boosts overall spectrum efficiency. However, near-field communications in LAE still face several challenges, such as the increase in signal processing complexity and the necessity of distinguishing between far and near-field users. Inspired by the large language models (LLM) with powerful ability to handle complex problems, we apply LLM to solve challenges of near-field communications in LAE. The objective of this article is to provide a comprehensive analysis and discussion on LLM-empowered near-field communications in LAE. Specifically, we first introduce fundamentals of LLM and near-field communications, including the key advantages of LLM and key characteristics of near-field communications. Then, we reveal the opportunities and challenges of near-field communications in LAE. To address these challenges, we present a LLM-based scheme for near-field communications in LAE, and provide a case study which jointly distinguishes far and near-field users and designs multi-user precoding matrix. Finally, we outline and highlight several future research directions and open issues.

### Flow-Based Non-stationary Temporal Regime Causal Structure Learning
**Authors**: Abdellah Rahmani, Pascal Frossard

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T15:12:43Z

**Summary**: Understanding causal relationships in multivariate time series is crucial in many scenarios, such as those dealing with financial or neurological data. Many such time series exhibit multiple regimes, i.e., consecutive temporal segments with a priori unknown boundaries, with each regime having its own causal structure. Inferring causal dependencies and regime shifts is critical for analyzing the underlying processes. However, causal structure learning in this setting is challenging due to (1) non stationarity, i.e., each regime can have its own causal graph and mixing function, and (2) complex noise distributions, which may be non Gaussian or heteroscedastic. Existing causal discovery approaches cannot address these challenges, since generally assume stationarity or Gaussian noise with constant variance. Hence, we introduce FANTOM, a unified framework for causal discovery that handles non stationary processes along with non Gaussian and heteroscedastic noises. FANTOM simultaneously infers the number of regimes and their corresponding indices and learns each regime's Directed Acyclic Graph. It uses a Bayesian Expectation Maximization algorithm that maximizes the evidence lower bound of the data log likelihood. On the theoretical side, we prove, under mild assumptions, that temporal heteroscedastic causal models, introduced in FANTOM's formulation, are identifiable in both stationary and non stationary settings. In addition, extensive experiments on synthetic and real data show that FANTOM outperforms existing methods.

### One-Step Diffusion for Detail-Rich and Temporally Consistent Video   Super-Resolution
**Authors**: Yujing Sun, Lingchen Sun, Shuaizheng Liu, Rongyuan Wu, Zhengqiang Zhang, Lei Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T15:05:29Z

**Summary**: It is a challenging problem to reproduce rich spatial details while maintaining temporal consistency in real-world video super-resolution (Real-VSR), especially when we leverage pre-trained generative models such as stable diffusion (SD) for realistic details synthesis. Existing SD-based Real-VSR methods often compromise spatial details for temporal coherence, resulting in suboptimal visual quality. We argue that the key lies in how to effectively extract the degradation-robust temporal consistency priors from the low-quality (LQ) input video and enhance the video details while maintaining the extracted consistency priors. To achieve this, we propose a Dual LoRA Learning (DLoRAL) paradigm to train an effective SD-based one-step diffusion model, achieving realistic frame details and temporal consistency simultaneously. Specifically, we introduce a Cross-Frame Retrieval (CFR) module to aggregate complementary information across frames, and train a Consistency-LoRA (C-LoRA) to learn robust temporal representations from degraded inputs. After consistency learning, we fix the CFR and C-LoRA modules and train a Detail-LoRA (D-LoRA) to enhance spatial details while aligning with the temporal space defined by C-LoRA to keep temporal coherence. The two phases alternate iteratively for optimization, collaboratively delivering consistent and detail-rich outputs. During inference, the two LoRA branches are merged into the SD model, allowing efficient and high-quality video restoration in a single diffusion step. Experiments show that DLoRAL achieves strong performance in both accuracy and speed. Code and models are available at https://github.com/yjsunnn/DLoRAL.

### From Concepts to Components: Concept-Agnostic Attention Module Discovery   in Transformers
**Authors**: Jingtong Su, Julia Kempe, Karen Ullrich

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T15:04:11Z

**Summary**: Transformers have achieved state-of-the-art performance across language and vision tasks. This success drives the imperative to interpret their internal mechanisms with the dual goals of enhancing performance and improving behavioral control. Attribution methods help advance interpretability by assigning model outputs associated with a target concept to specific model components. Current attribution research primarily studies multi-layer perceptron neurons and addresses relatively simple concepts such as factual associations (e.g., Paris is located in France). This focus tends to overlook the impact of the attention mechanism and lacks a unified approach for analyzing more complex concepts. To fill these gaps, we introduce Scalable Attention Module Discovery (SAMD), a concept-agnostic method for mapping arbitrary, complex concepts to specific attention heads of general transformer models. We accomplish this by representing each concept as a vector, calculating its cosine similarity with each attention head, and selecting the TopK-scoring heads to construct the concept-associated attention module. We then propose Scalar Attention Module Intervention (SAMI), a simple strategy to diminish or amplify the effects of a concept by adjusting the attention module using only a single scalar parameter. Empirically, we demonstrate SAMD on concepts of varying complexity, and visualize the locations of their corresponding modules. Our results demonstrate that module locations remain stable before and after LLM post-training, and confirm prior work on the mechanics of LLM multilingualism. Through SAMI, we facilitate jailbreaking on HarmBench (+72.7%) by diminishing "safety" and improve performance on the GSM8K benchmark (+1.6%) by amplifying "reasoning". Lastly, we highlight the domain-agnostic nature of our approach by suppressing the image classification accuracy of vision transformers on ImageNet.

### Geopolitical biases in LLMs: what are the "good" and the "bad" countries   according to contemporary language models
**Authors**: Mikhail Salnikov, Dmitrii Korzh, Ivan Lazichny, Elvir Karimov, Artyom Iudin, Ivan Oseledets, Oleg Y. Rogov, Natalia Loukachevitch, Alexander Panchenko, Elena Tutubalina

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T15:03:21Z

**Summary**: This paper evaluates geopolitical biases in LLMs with respect to various countries though an analysis of their interpretation of historical events with conflicting national perspectives (USA, UK, USSR, and China). We introduce a novel dataset with neutral event descriptions and contrasting viewpoints from different countries. Our findings show significant geopolitical biases, with models favoring specific national narratives. Additionally, simple debiasing prompts had a limited effect in reducing these biases. Experiments with manipulated participant labels reveal models' sensitivity to attribution, sometimes amplifying biases or recognizing inconsistencies, especially with swapped labels. This work highlights national narrative biases in LLMs, challenges the effectiveness of simple debiasing methods, and offers a framework and dataset for future geopolitical bias research.

### How Breakable Is Privacy: Probing and Resisting Model Inversion Attacks   in Collaborative Inference
**Authors**: Rongke Liu, Youwen Zhu, Dong Wang, Gaoning Pan, Xingyu He, Weizhi Meng

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T14:59:56Z

**Summary**: Collaborative inference (CI) improves computational efficiency for edge devices by transmitting intermediate features to cloud models. However, this process inevitably exposes feature representations to model inversion attacks (MIAs), enabling unauthorized data reconstruction. Despite extensive research, there is no established criterion for assessing the difficulty of MIA implementation, leaving a fundamental question unanswered: \textit{What factors truly and verifiably determine the attack's success in CI?} Moreover, existing defenses lack the theoretical foundation described above, making it challenging to regulate feature information effectively while ensuring privacy and minimizing computational overhead. These shortcomings introduce three key challenges: theoretical gap, methodological limitation, and practical constraint.   To overcome these challenges, we propose the first theoretical criterion to assess MIA difficulty in CI, identifying mutual information, entropy, and effective information volume as key influencing factors. The validity of this criterion is demonstrated by using the mutual information neural estimator. Building on this insight, we propose SiftFunnel, a privacy-preserving framework to resist MIA while maintaining usability. Specifically, we incorporate linear and non-linear correlation constraints alongside label smoothing to suppress redundant information transmission, effectively balancing privacy and usability. To enhance deployability, the edge model adopts a funnel-shaped structure with attention mechanisms, strengthening privacy while reducing computational and storage burdens. Experiments show that, compared to state-of-the-art defense, SiftFunnel increases reconstruction error by $\sim$30\%, lowers mutual and effective information metrics by $\geq$50\%, and reduces edge burdens by almost $20\times$, while maintaining comparable usability.

### COS-DPO: Conditioned One-Shot Multi-Objective Fine-Tuning Framework
**Authors**: Yinuo Ren, Tesi Xiao, Michael Shavlovsky, Lexing Ying, Holakou Rahmanian

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T14:52:02Z

**Summary**: In LLM alignment and many other ML applications, one often faces the Multi-Objective Fine-Tuning (MOFT) problem, i.e., fine-tuning an existing model with datasets labeled w.r.t. different objectives simultaneously. To address the challenge, we propose a Conditioned One-Shot fine-tuning framework (COS-DPO) that extends the Direct Preference Optimization technique, originally developed for efficient LLM alignment with preference data, to accommodate the MOFT settings. By direct conditioning on the weight across auxiliary objectives, our Weight-COS-DPO method enjoys an efficient one-shot training process for profiling the Pareto front and is capable of achieving comprehensive trade-off solutions even in the post-training stage. Based on our theoretical findings on the linear transformation properties of the loss function, we further propose the Temperature-COS-DPO method that augments the temperature parameter to the model input, enhancing the flexibility of post-training control over the trade-offs between the main and auxiliary objectives. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the COS-DPO framework through its applications to various tasks, including the Learning-to-Rank (LTR) and LLM alignment tasks, highlighting its viability for large-scale ML deployments.

### Stretching Beyond the Obvious: A Gradient-Free Framework to Unveil the   Hidden Landscape of Visual Invariance
**Authors**: Lorenzo Tausani, Paolo Muratore, Morgan B. Talbot, Giacomo Amerio, Gabriel Kreiman, Davide Zoccolan

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T14:49:35Z

**Summary**: Uncovering which features' combinations high-level visual units encode is critical to understand how images are transformed into representations that support recognition. While existing feature visualization approaches typically infer a unit's most exciting images, this is insufficient to reveal the manifold of transformations under which responses remain invariant, which is key to generalization in vision. Here we introduce Stretch-and-Squeeze (SnS), an unbiased, model-agnostic, and gradient-free framework to systematically characterize a unit's invariance landscape and its vulnerability to adversarial perturbations in both biological and artificial visual systems. SnS frames these transformations as bi-objective optimization problems. To probe invariance, SnS seeks image perturbations that maximally alter the representation of a reference stimulus in a given processing stage while preserving unit activation. To probe adversarial sensitivity, SnS seeks perturbations that minimally alter the stimulus while suppressing unit activation. Applied to convolutional neural networks (CNNs), SnS revealed image variations that were further from a reference image in pixel-space than those produced by affine transformations, while more strongly preserving the target unit's response. The discovered invariant images differed dramatically depending on the choice of image representation used for optimization: pixel-level changes primarily affected luminance and contrast, while stretching mid- and late-layer CNN representations altered texture and pose respectively. Notably, the invariant images from robust networks were more recognizable by human subjects than those from standard networks, supporting the higher fidelity of robust CNNs as models of the visual system.

### A Heavy-Metal Scenario of Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Rays
**Authors**: Jakub Vícha, Alena Bakalová, Ana L. Müller, Olena Tkachenko, Maximilian K. Stadelmaier

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T14:38:13Z

**Summary**: The mass composition of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays is an open problem in astroparticle physics. It is usually inferred from the depth of the shower maximum (Xmax) of cosmic-ray showers, which is only ambiguously determined by modern hadronic interaction models. We examine a data-driven scenario, in which we consider the expectation value of Xmax as a free parameter. We test the novel hypothesis whether the cosmic-ray data from the Pierre Auger Observatory can be interpreted in a consistent picture, under the assumption that the mass composition of cosmic rays at the highest energies is dominated by high metallicity, resulting in pure iron nuclei at energies above ~40 EeV. We investigate the implications on astrophysical observations and hadronic interactions, and we discuss the global consistency of the data assuming this heavy-metal scenario. We conclude that the data from the Pierre Auger Observatory can be interpreted consistently if the expectation values for Xmax from modern hadronic interaction models are shifted to larger values.

### Incivility and Rigidity: The Risks of Fine-Tuning LLMs for Political   Argumentation
**Authors**: Svetlana Churina, Kokil Jaidka

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T14:35:51Z

**Summary**: The incivility prevalent on platforms like Twitter (now X) and Reddit poses a challenge for developing AI systems that can support productive and rhetorically sound political argumentation. In this study, we report experiments with GPT-3.5 Turbo, fine-tuned on two contrasting datasets of political discussions: high-variance, high-incivility Twitter replies to U.S. Congress, and low-variance, low-incivility posts from Reddit's r/ChangeMyView. We systematically evaluate how these data sources and prompting strategies shape the rhetorical framing and deliberative quality of model-generated arguments. Our results show that Reddit-finetuned models produce safer but rhetorically rigid arguments, while cross-platform fine-tuning amplifies toxicity. Prompting reduces specific toxic behaviors, such as personal attacks, but fails to fully mitigate the influence of high-incivility training data. We introduce and validate a rhetorical evaluation rubric and provide practical guidelines for deploying LLMs in content authoring, moderation, and deliberation support.

### Conditional Front-door Adjustment for Heterogeneous Treatment Assignment   Effect Estimation Under Non-adherence
**Authors**: Winston Chen, Trenton Chang, Jenna Wiens

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T14:29:02Z

**Summary**: Estimates of heterogeneous treatment assignment effects can inform treatment decisions. Under the presence of non-adherence (e.g., patients do not adhere to their assigned treatment), both the standard backdoor adjustment (SBD) and the conditional front-door adjustment (CFD) can recover unbiased estimates of the treatment assignment effects. However, the estimation variance of these approaches may vary widely across settings, which remains underexplored in the literature. In this work, we demonstrate theoretically and empirically that CFD yields lower-variance estimates than SBD when the true effect of treatment assignment is small (i.e., assigning an intervention leads to small changes in patients' future outcome). Additionally, since CFD requires estimating multiple nuisance parameters, we introduce LobsterNet, a multi-task neural network that implements CFD with joint modeling of the nuisance parameters. Empirically, LobsterNet reduces estimation error across several semi-synthetic and real-world datasets compared to baselines. Our findings suggest CFD with shared nuisance parameter modeling can improve treatment assignment effect estimation under non-adherence.

### ReplaceMe: Network Simplification via Depth Pruning and Transformer   Block Linearization
**Authors**: Dmitriy Shopkhoev, Ammar Ali, Magauiya Zhussip, Valentin Malykh, Stamatios Lefkimmiatis, Nikos Komodakis, Sergey Zagoruyko

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T14:27:20Z

**Summary**: We introduce ReplaceMe, a generalized training-free depth pruning method that effectively replaces transformer blocks with a linear operation, while maintaining high performance for low compression ratios. In contrast to conventional pruning approaches that require additional training or fine-tuning, our approach requires only a small calibration dataset that is used to estimate a linear transformation, which approximates the pruned blocks. The estimated linear mapping can be seamlessly merged with the remaining transformer blocks, eliminating the need for any additional network parameters. Our experiments show that ReplaceMe consistently outperforms other training-free approaches and remains highly competitive with state-of-the-art pruning methods that involve extensive retraining/fine-tuning and architectural modifications. Applied to several large language models (LLMs), ReplaceMe achieves up to 25% pruning while retaining approximately 90% of the original model's performance on open benchmarks - without any training or healing steps, resulting in minimal computational overhead (see Fig.1). We provide an open-source library implementing ReplaceMe alongside several state-of-the-art depth pruning techniques, available at https://github.com/mts-ai/ReplaceMe.

### Eau De $Q$-Network: Adaptive Distillation of Neural Networks in Deep   Reinforcement Learning
**Authors**: Théo Vincent, Tim Faust, Yogesh Tripathi, Jan Peters, Carlo D'Eramo

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T14:24:49Z

**Summary**: Recent works have successfully demonstrated that sparse deep reinforcement learning agents can be competitive against their dense counterparts. This opens up opportunities for reinforcement learning applications in fields where inference time and memory requirements are cost-sensitive or limited by hardware. Until now, dense-to-sparse methods have relied on hand-designed sparsity schedules that are not synchronized with the agent's learning pace. Crucially, the final sparsity level is chosen as a hyperparameter, which requires careful tuning as setting it too high might lead to poor performances. In this work, we address these shortcomings by crafting a dense-to-sparse algorithm that we name Eau De $Q$-Network (EauDeQN). To increase sparsity at the agent's learning pace, we consider multiple online networks with different sparsity levels, where each online network is trained from a shared target network. At each target update, the online network with the smallest loss is chosen as the next target network, while the other networks are replaced by a pruned version of the chosen network. We evaluate the proposed approach on the Atari $2600$ benchmark and the MuJoCo physics simulator, showing that EauDeQN reaches high sparsity levels while keeping performances high.

### Can Large Language Models Replace Human Subjects? A Large-Scale   Replication of Scenario-Based Experiments in Psychology and Management
**Authors**: Ziyan Cui, Ning Li, Huaikang Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T14:13:17Z

**Summary**: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly being integrated into scientific research, particularly in the social sciences, where understanding human behavior is critical. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in replicating human-like responses in various psychological experiments. We conducted a large-scale study replicating 156 psychological experiments from top social science journals using three state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-4, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and DeepSeek v3). Our results reveal that while LLMs demonstrate high replication rates for main effects (73-81%) and moderate to strong success with interaction effects (46-63%), They consistently produce larger effect sizes than human studies, with Fisher Z values approximately 2-3 times higher than human studies. Notably, LLMs show significantly lower replication rates for studies involving socially sensitive topics such as race, gender and ethics. When original studies reported null findings, LLMs produced significant results at remarkably high rates (68-83%) - while this could reflect cleaner data with less noise, as evidenced by narrower confidence intervals, it also suggests potential risks of effect size overestimation. Our results demonstrate both the promise and challenges of LLMs in psychological research, offering efficient tools for pilot testing and rapid hypothesis validation while enriching rather than replacing traditional human subject studies, yet requiring more nuanced interpretation and human validation for complex social phenomena and culturally sensitive research questions.

### LLM-Generated Feedback Supports Learning If Learners Choose to Use It
**Authors**: Danielle R. Thomas, Conrad Borchers, Shambhavi Bhushan, Erin Gatz, Shivang Gupta, Kenneth R. Koedinger

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T13:59:14Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate feedback, yet their impact on learning remains underexplored, especially compared to existing feedback methods. This study investigates how on-demand LLM-generated explanatory feedback influences learning in seven scenario-based tutor training lessons. Analyzing over 2,600 lesson completions from 885 tutor learners, we compare posttest performance among learners across three groups: learners who received feedback generated by gpt-3.5-turbo, those who declined it, and those without access. All groups received non-LLM corrective feedback. To address potential selection bias-where higher-performing learners may be more inclined to use LLM feedback-we applied propensity scoring. Learners with a higher predicted likelihood of engaging with LLM feedback scored significantly higher at posttest than those with lower propensity. After adjusting for this effect, two out of seven lessons showed statistically significant learning benefits from LLM feedback with standardized effect sizes of 0.28 and 0.33. These moderate effects suggest that the effectiveness of LLM feedback depends on the learners' tendency to seek support. Importantly, LLM feedback did not significantly increase completion time, and learners overwhelmingly rated it as helpful. These findings highlight LLM feedback's potential as a low-cost and scalable way to improve learning on open-ended tasks, particularly in existing systems already providing feedback without LLMs. This work contributes open datasets, LLM prompts, and rubrics to support reproducibility.

### PersonalAI: Towards digital twins in the graph form
**Authors**: Mikhail Menschikov, Dmitry Evseev, Ruslan Kostoev, Ilya Perepechkin, Ilnaz Salimov, Victoria Dochkina, Petr Anokhin, Evgeny Burnaev, Nikita Semenov

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T13:52:15Z

**Summary**: The challenge of personalizing language models, specifically the ability to account for a user's history during interactions, is of significant interest. Despite recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) and Retrieval Augmented Generation that have enhanced the factual base of LLMs, the task of retaining extensive personal information and using it to generate personalized responses remains pertinent. To address this, we propose utilizing external memory in the form of knowledge graphs, which are constructed and updated by the LLM itself. We have expanded upon ideas of AriGraph architecture and for the first time introduced a combined graph featuring both standard edges and two types of hyperedges. Experiments conducted on the TriviaQA, HotpotQA and DiaASQ benchmarks indicates that this approach aids in making the process of graph construction and knowledge extraction unified and robust. Furthermore, we augmented the DiaASQ benchmark by incorporating parameters such as time into dialogues and introducing contradictory statements made by the same speaker at different times. Despite these modifications, the performance of the question-answering system remained robust, demonstrating the proposed architecture's ability to maintain and utilize temporal dependencies.

### Efficient Online Inference of Vision Transformers by Training-Free   Tokenization
**Authors**: Leonidas Gee, Wing Yan Li, Viktoriia Sharmanska, Novi Quadrianto

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T13:50:00Z

**Summary**: The cost of deploying vision transformers increasingly represents a barrier to wider industrial adoption. Existing compression techniques require additional end-to-end fine-tuning or incur a significant drawback to runtime, making them ill-suited for online (real-time) inference, where a prediction is made on any new input as it comes in. We introduce the $\textbf{Visual Word Tokenizer}$ (VWT), a training-free method for reducing energy costs while retaining performance and runtime. The VWT groups visual subwords (image patches) that are frequently used into visual words while infrequent ones remain intact. To do so, $\textit{intra}$-image or $\textit{inter}$-image statistics are leveraged to identify similar visual concepts for sequence compression. Experimentally, we demonstrate a reduction in wattage of up to 25% with only a 20% increase in runtime at most. Comparative approaches of 8-bit quantization and token merging achieve a lower or similar energy efficiency but exact a higher toll on runtime (up to 100% or more). Our results indicate that VWTs are well-suited for efficient online inference with a marginal compromise on performance.

### Think&Cite: Improving Attributed Text Generation with Self-Guided Tree   Search and Progress Reward Modeling
**Authors**: Junyi Li, Hwee Tou Ng

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T13:47:25Z

**Summary**: Despite their outstanding capabilities, large language models (LLMs) are prone to hallucination and producing factually incorrect information. This challenge has spurred efforts in attributed text generation, which prompts LLMs to generate content with supporting evidence. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, called Think&Cite, and formulate attributed text generation as a multi-step reasoning problem integrated with search. Specifically, we propose Self-Guided Monte Carlo Tree Search (SG-MCTS), which capitalizes on the self-reflection capability of LLMs to reason about the intermediate states of MCTS for guiding the tree expansion process. To provide reliable and comprehensive feedback, we introduce Progress Reward Modeling to measure the progress of tree search from the root to the current state from two aspects, i.e., generation and attribution progress. We conduct extensive experiments on three datasets and the results show that our approach significantly outperforms baseline approaches.

### Prmpt2Adpt: Prompt-Based Zero-Shot Domain Adaptation for   Resource-Constrained Environments
**Authors**: Yasir Ali Farrukh, Syed Wali, Irfan Khan, Nathaniel D. Bastian

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T13:43:54Z

**Summary**: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) is a critical challenge in real-world vision systems, especially in resource-constrained environments like drones, where memory and computation are limited. Existing prompt-driven UDA methods typically rely on large vision-language models and require full access to source-domain data during adaptation, limiting their applicability. In this work, we propose Prmpt2Adpt, a lightweight and efficient zero-shot domain adaptation framework built around a teacher-student paradigm guided by prompt-based feature alignment. At the core of our method is a distilled and fine-tuned CLIP model, used as the frozen backbone of a Faster R-CNN teacher. A small set of low-level source features is aligned to the target domain semantics-specified only through a natural language prompt-via Prompt-driven Instance Normalization (PIN). These semantically steered features are used to briefly fine-tune the detection head of the teacher model. The adapted teacher then generates high-quality pseudo-labels, which guide the on-the-fly adaptation of a compact student model. Experiments on the MDS-A dataset demonstrate that Prmpt2Adpt achieves competitive detection performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, while delivering up to 7x faster adaptation and 5x faster inference speed using few source images-making it a practical and scalable solution for real-time adaptation in low-resource domains.

**Authors**: Binbin Xiang, Maciej Wielgosz, Stefano Puliti, Kamil Král, Martin Krůček, Azim Missarov, Rasmus Astrup

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T13:39:27Z

**Summary**: The segmentation of forest LiDAR 3D point clouds, including both individual tree and semantic segmentation, is fundamental for advancing forest management and ecological research. However, current approaches often struggle with the complexity and variability of natural forest environments. We present ForestFormer3D, a new unified and end-to-end framework designed for precise individual tree and semantic segmentation. ForestFormer3D incorporates ISA-guided query point selection, a score-based block merging strategy during inference, and a one-to-many association mechanism for effective training. By combining these new components, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance for individual tree segmentation on the newly introduced FOR-instanceV2 dataset, which spans diverse forest types and regions. Additionally, ForestFormer3D generalizes well to unseen test sets (Wytham woods and LAUTx), showcasing its robustness across different forest conditions and sensor modalities. The FOR-instanceV2 dataset and the ForestFormer3D code will be released soon.

### TeXpert: A Multi-Level Benchmark for Evaluating LaTeX Code Generation by   LLMs
**Authors**: Sahil Kale, Vijaykant Nadadur

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T13:39:16Z

**Summary**: LaTeX's precision and flexibility in typesetting have made it the gold standard for the preparation of scientific documentation. Large Language Models (LLMs) present a promising opportunity for researchers to produce publication-ready material using LaTeX with natural language instructions, yet current benchmarks completely lack evaluation of this ability. By introducing TeXpert, our benchmark dataset with natural language prompts for generating LaTeX code focused on components of scientific documents across multiple difficulty levels, we conduct an in-depth analysis of LLM performance in this regard and identify frequent error types. Our evaluation across open and closed-source LLMs highlights multiple key findings: LLMs excelling on standard benchmarks perform poorly in LaTeX generation with a significant accuracy drop-off as the complexity of tasks increases; open-source models like DeepSeek v3 and DeepSeek Coder strongly rival closed-source counterparts in LaTeX tasks; and formatting and package errors are unexpectedly prevalent, suggesting a lack of diverse LaTeX examples in the training datasets of most LLMs. Our dataset, code, and model evaluations are available at https://github.com/knowledge-verse-ai/TeXpert.

### Assessing Tenstorrent's RISC-V MatMul Acceleration Capabilities
**Authors**: Hiari Pizzini Cavagna, Daniele Cesarini, Andrea Bartolini

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T13:34:13Z

**Summary**: The increasing demand for generative AI as Large Language Models (LLMs) services has driven the need for specialized hardware architectures that optimize computational efficiency and energy consumption. This paper evaluates the performance of the Tenstorrent Grayskull e75 RISC-V accelerator for basic linear algebra kernels at reduced numerical precision, a fundamental operation in LLM computations. We present a detailed characterization of Grayskull's execution model, gridsize, matrix dimensions, data formats, and numerical precision impact computational efficiency. Furthermore, we compare Grayskull's performance against state-of-the-art architectures with tensor acceleration, including Intel Sapphire Rapids processors and two NVIDIA GPUs (V100 and A100). Whilst NVIDIA GPUs dominate raw performance, Grayskull demonstrates a competitive trade-off between power consumption and computational throughput, reaching a peak of 1.55 TFLOPs/Watt with BF16.

### Knapsack Optimization-based Schema Linking for LLM-based Text-to-SQL   Generation
**Authors**: Zheng Yuan, Hao Chen, Zijin Hong, Qinggang Zhang, Feiran Huang, Qing Li, Xiao Huang

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T13:24:05Z

**Summary**: Generating SQLs from user queries is a long-standing challenge, where the accuracy of initial schema linking significantly impacts subsequent SQL generation performance. However, current schema linking models still struggle with missing relevant schema elements or an excess of redundant ones. A crucial reason for this is that commonly used metrics, recall and precision, fail to capture relevant element missing and thus cannot reflect actual schema linking performance. Motivated by this, we propose enhanced schema linking metrics by introducing a restricted missing indicator. Accordingly, we introduce Knapsack optimization-based Schema Linking Approach (KaSLA), a plug-in schema linking method designed to prevent the missing of relevant schema elements while minimizing the inclusion of redundant ones. KaSLA employs a hierarchical linking strategy that first identifies the optimal table linking and subsequently links columns within the selected table to reduce linking candidate space. In each linking process, it utilizes a knapsack optimization approach to link potentially relevant elements while accounting for a limited tolerance of potentially redundant ones. With this optimization, KaSLA-1.6B achieves superior schema linking results compared to large-scale LLMs, including deepseek-v3 with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) schema linking method. Extensive experiments on Spider and BIRD benchmarks verify that KaSLA can significantly improve the SQL generation performance of SOTA Text2SQL models by substituting their schema linking processes.

### Language Bottleneck Models: A Framework for Interpretable Knowledge   Tracing and Beyond
**Authors**: Antonin Berthon, Mihaela van der Schaar

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T13:21:14Z

**Summary**: Accurately assessing student knowledge is critical for effective education, yet traditional Knowledge Tracing (KT) methods rely on opaque latent embeddings, limiting interpretability. Even LLM-based approaches generate direct predictions or summaries that may hallucinate without any accuracy guarantees. We recast KT as an inverse problem: learning the minimum natural-language summary that makes past answers explainable and future answers predictable. Our Language Bottleneck Model (LBM) consists of an encoder LLM that writes an interpretable knowledge summary and a frozen decoder LLM that must reconstruct and predict student responses using only that summary text. By constraining all predictive information to pass through a short natural-language bottleneck, LBMs ensure that the summary contains accurate information while remaining human-interpretable. Experiments on synthetic arithmetic benchmarks and the large-scale Eedi dataset show that LBMs rival the accuracy of state-of-the-art KT and direct LLM methods while requiring orders-of-magnitude fewer student trajectories. We demonstrate that training the encoder with group-relative policy optimization, using downstream decoding accuracy as a reward signal, effectively improves summary quality.

### Latent Concept Disentanglement in Transformer-based Language Models
**Authors**: Guan Zhe Hong, Bhavya Vasudeva, Vatsal Sharan, Cyrus Rashtchian, Prabhakar Raghavan, Rina Panigrahy

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T13:08:12Z

**Summary**: When large language models (LLMs) use in-context learning (ICL) to solve a new task, they seem to grasp not only the goal of the task but also core, latent concepts in the demonstration examples. This begs the question of whether transformers represent latent structures as part of their computation or whether they take shortcuts to solve the problem. Prior mechanistic work on ICL does not address this question because it does not sufficiently examine the relationship between the learned representation and the latent concept, and the considered problem settings often involve only single-step reasoning. In this work, we examine how transformers disentangle and use latent concepts. We show that in 2-hop reasoning tasks with a latent, discrete concept, the model successfully identifies the latent concept and does step-by-step concept composition. In tasks parameterized by a continuous latent concept, we find low-dimensional subspaces in the representation space where the geometry mimics the underlying parameterization. Together, these results refine our understanding of ICL and the representation of transformers, and they provide evidence for highly localized structures in the model that disentangle latent concepts in ICL tasks.

### PromptDSI: Prompt-based Rehearsal-free Instance-wise Incremental   Learning for Document Retrieval
**Authors**: Tuan-Luc Huynh, Thuy-Trang Vu, Weiqing Wang, Yinwei Wei, Trung Le, Dragan Gasevic, Yuan-Fang Li, Thanh-Toan Do

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T12:59:40Z

**Summary**: Differentiable Search Index (DSI) utilizes pre-trained language models to perform indexing and document retrieval via end-to-end learning without relying on external indexes. However, DSI requires full re-training to index new documents, causing significant computational inefficiencies. Continual learning (CL) offers a solution by enabling the model to incrementally update without full re-training. Existing CL solutions in document retrieval rely on memory buffers or generative models for rehearsal, which is infeasible when accessing previous training data is restricted due to privacy concerns. To this end, we introduce PromptDSI, a prompt-based, rehearsal-free continual learning approach for document retrieval. PromptDSI follows the Prompt-based Continual Learning (PCL) framework, using learnable prompts to efficiently index new documents without accessing previous documents or queries. To improve retrieval latency, we remove the initial forward pass of PCL, which otherwise greatly increases training and inference time, with a negligible trade-off in performance. Additionally, we introduce a novel topic-aware prompt pool that employs neural topic embeddings as fixed keys, eliminating the instability of prompt key optimization while maintaining competitive performance with existing PCL prompt pools. In a challenging rehearsal-free continual learning setup, we demonstrate that PromptDSI variants outperform rehearsal-based baselines, match the strong cache-based baseline in mitigating forgetting, and significantly improving retrieval performance on new corpora.

### Autoregressive Hypergraph
**Authors**: Xianghe Zhu, Qiwei Yao

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T12:56:11Z

**Summary**: Traditional graph representations are insufficient for modelling real-world phenomena involving multi-entity interactions, such as collaborative projects or protein complexes, necessitating the use of hypergraphs. While hypergraphs preserve the intrinsic nature of such complex relationships, existing models often overlook temporal evolution in relational data. To address this, we introduce a first-order autoregressive (i.e. AR(1)) model for dynamic non-uniform hypergraphs. This is the first dynamic hypergraph model with provable theoretical guarantees, explicitly defining the temporal evolution of hyperedge presence through transition probabilities that govern persistence and change dynamics. This framework provides closed-form expressions for key probabilistic properties and facilitates straightforward maximum-likelihood inference with uniform error bounds and asymptotic normality, along with a permutation-based diagnostic test. We also consider an AR(1) hypergraph stochastic block model (HSBM), where a novel Laplacian enables exact and efficient latent community recovery via a spectral clustering algorithm. Furthermore, we develop a likelihood-based change-point estimator for the HSBM to detect structural breaks within the time series. The efficacy and practical value of our methods are comprehensively demonstrated through extensive simulation studies and compelling applications to a primary school interaction data set and the Enron email corpus, revealing insightful community structures and significant temporal changes.

### LogProber: Disentangling confidence from contamination in LLM responses
**Authors**: Nicolas Yax, Pierre-Yves Oudeyer, Stefano Palminteri

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T12:52:37Z

**Summary**: In machine learning, contamination refers to situations where testing data leak into the training set. The issue is particularly relevant for the evaluation of the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs), which are generally trained on gargantuan, and generally opaque, corpora of text scraped from the world wide web. Developing tools to detect contamination is therefore crucial to be able to fairly and properly track the evolution of the performance of LLMs. To date, only a few recent studies have attempted to address the issue of quantifying and detecting contamination in short text sequences, such as those commonly found in benchmarks. However, these methods have limitations that can sometimes render them impractical. In the present paper, we introduce LogProber, a novel, efficient algorithm that we show to be able to detect contamination in a black box setting that tries to tackle some of these drawbacks by focusing on the familiarity with the question rather than the answer. Here, we explore the properties of the proposed method in comparison with concurrent approaches, identify its advantages and limitations, and illustrate how different forms of contamination can go undetected depending on the design of the detection algorithm.

### Enhancing Taiji's Parameter Estimation under Non-Stationarity: a   Time-Frequency Domain Framework for Galactic Binaries and Instrumental Noises
**Authors**: Minghui Du, Ziren Luo, Peng Xu

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T12:43:30Z

**Summary**: The data analysis of space-based gravitational wave detectors like Taiji faces significant challenges from non-stationary noise, which compromises the efficacy of traditional frequency-domain analysis. This work proposes a unified framework based on short-time Fourier transform (STFT) to enhance parameter estimation of Galactic binary and characterization of instrumental noise under non-stationarity. Segmenting data into locally stationary intervals, we derive STFT-based models for signals and noises, and implement Bayesian inference via the extended Whittle likelihood. Validated through the analysis of verification Galactic binaries and instrumental noises, our STFT approach outperforms frequency-domain methods by reducing the uncertainty and bias of estimation, successfully recovering low signal-to-noise ratio signals missed by frequency-domain analysis, and mitigating the degeneracy among noise parameters. The framework's robustness against noise drifts and computational efficiency highlight its potential for integration into future global analysis pipelines.

### SafeGenBench: A Benchmark Framework for Security Vulnerability Detection   in LLM-Generated Code
**Authors**: Xinghang Li, Jingzhe Ding, Chao Peng, Bing Zhao, Xiang Gao, Hongwan Gao, Xinchen Gu

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T12:42:57Z

**Summary**: The code generation capabilities of large language models(LLMs) have emerged as a critical dimension in evaluating their overall performance. However, prior research has largely overlooked the security risks inherent in the generated code. In this work, we introduce SafeGenBench, a benchmark specifically designed to assess the security of LLM-generated code. The dataset encompasses a wide range of common software development scenarios and vulnerability types. Building upon this benchmark, we develop an automatic evaluation framework that leverages both static application security testing(SAST) and LLM-based judging to assess the presence of security vulnerabilities in model-generated code. Through the empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs on SafeGenBench, we reveal notable deficiencies in their ability to produce vulnerability-free code. Our findings highlight pressing challenges and offer actionable insights for future advancements in the secure code generation performance of LLMs. The data and code will be released soon.

### Modeling and Visualization Reasoning for Stakeholders in Education and   Industry Integration Systems: Research on Structured Synthetic Dialogue Data   Generation Based on NIST Standards
**Authors**: Wei Meng

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T12:37:43Z

**Summary**: This study addresses the structural complexity and semantic ambiguity in stakeholder interactions within the Education-Industry Integration (EII) system. The scarcity of real interview data, absence of structured variable modeling, and lack of interpretability in inference mechanisms have limited the analytical accuracy and policy responsiveness of EII research. To resolve these challenges, we propose a structural modeling paradigm based on the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) synthetic data quality framework, focusing on consistency, authenticity, and traceability. We design a five-layer architecture that includes prompt-driven synthetic dialogue generation, a structured variable system covering skills, institutional, and emotional dimensions, dependency and causal path modeling, graph-based structure design, and an interactive inference engine. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach using a 15-segment synthetic corpus, with 41,597 tokens, 127 annotated variables, and 820 semantic relationship triples. The model exhibits strong structural consistency (Krippendorff alpha = 0.83), construct validity (RMSEA = 0.048, CFI = 0.93), and semantic alignment (mean cosine similarity > 0.78 via BERT). A key causal loop is identified: system mismatch leads to emotional frustration, reduced participation, skill gaps, and recurrence of mismatch, revealing a structural degradation cycle. This research introduces the first NIST-compliant AI modeling framework for stakeholder systems and provides a foundation for policy simulation, curriculum design, and collaborative strategy modeling.

### Adversarial Reasoning for Repair Based on Inferred Program Intent
**Authors**: He Ye, Aidan Z. H. Yang, Chang Hu, Yanlin Wang, Tao Zhang, Claire Le Goues

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T12:30:23Z

**Summary**: Automated program repair (APR) has shown promising results, particularly with the use of neural networks. Currently, most APR tools focus on code transformations specified by test suites, rather than reasoning about the program intent and the high-level bug specification. Without a proper understanding of program intent, these tools tend to generate patches that overfit incomplete test suites and fail to reflect the developers intentions. However, reasoning about program intent is challenging. In our work, we propose an approach called AdverIntent-Agent, based on critique and adversarial reasoning. Our approach is novel to shift the focus from generating multiple APR patches to inferring multiple potential program intents. Ideally, we aim to infer intents that are, to some extent, adversarial to each other, maximizing the probability that at least one aligns closely with the developers original intent. AdverIntent-Agent is a multi-agent approach consisting of three agents: a reasoning agent, a test agent, and a repair agent. First, the reasoning agent generates adversarial program intents along with the corresponding faulty statements. Next, the test agent produces adversarial test cases that align with each inferred intent, constructing oracles that use the same inputs but have different expected outputs. Finally, the repair agent uses dynamic and precise LLM prompts to generate patches that satisfy both the inferred program intent and the generated tests. AdverIntent-Agent was evaluated on two benchmarks: Defects4J 2.0 and HumanEval-Java. AdverIntent-Agent correctly repaired 77 and 105 bugs in both benchmarks, respectively.

### Calibrated Predictive Lower Bounds on Time-to-Unsafe-Sampling in LLMs
**Authors**: Hen Davidov, Gilad Freidkin, Shai Feldman, Yaniv Romano

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T12:12:17Z

**Summary**: We develop a framework to quantify the time-to-unsafe-sampling - the number of large language model (LLM) generations required to trigger an unsafe (e.g., toxic) response. Estimating this quantity is challenging, since unsafe responses are exceedingly rare in well-aligned LLMs, potentially occurring only once in thousands of generations. As a result, directly estimating time-to-unsafe-sampling would require collecting training data with a prohibitively large number of generations per prompt. However, with realistic sampling budgets, we often cannot generate enough responses to observe an unsafe outcome for every prompt, leaving the time-to-unsafe-sampling unobserved in many cases, making the estimation and evaluation tasks particularly challenging. To address this, we frame this estimation problem as one of survival analysis and develop a provably calibrated lower predictive bound (LPB) on the time-to-unsafe-sampling of a given prompt, leveraging recent advances in conformal prediction. Our key innovation is designing an adaptive, per-prompt sampling strategy, formulated as a convex optimization problem. The objective function guiding this optimized sampling allocation is designed to reduce the variance of the estimators used to construct the LPB, leading to improved statistical efficiency over naive methods that use a fixed sampling budget per prompt. Experiments on both synthetic and real data support our theoretical results and demonstrate the practical utility of our method for safety risk assessment in generative AI models.

### Can LLMs Hack Enterprise Networks? Autonomous Assumed Breach   Penetration-Testing Active Directory Networks
**Authors**: Andreas Happe, Jürgen Cito

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T12:02:54Z

**Summary**: Penetration-testing, while critical for validating defenses and uncovering vulnerabilities, is often limited by high operational costs and the scarcity of human expertise. This paper investigates the feasibility and effectiveness of using Large Language Model (LLM)-driven autonomous systems to address these challenges in real-world Microsoft Active Directory (AD) enterprise networks. Our novel prototype, cochise, represents the first demonstration of a fully autonomous, LLM-driven framework capable of compromising accounts within a real-life Microsoft AD testbed (GOAD). The evaluation deliberately utilizes GOAD to capture the intricate interactions and sometimes nondeterministic outcomes of live network pen-testing, moving beyond the limitations of synthetic benchmarks. We perform our empirical evaluation using five LLMs, comparing reasoning to non-reasoning models as well as including open-weight models. Through comprehensive quantitative and qualitative analysis, incorporating insights from cybersecurity experts, we demonstrate that autonomous LLMs can effectively conduct Assumed Breach simulations. Key findings highlight their ability to dynamically adapt attack strategies, perform inter-context attacks, and generate scenario-specific attack parameters. Cochise also exhibits robust self-correction mechanisms, automatically installing missing tools and rectifying invalid command generations. Critically, we find that the associated costs are competitive with those incurred by professional pen-testers, suggesting a path toward democratizing access to essential security testing for organizations with budgetary constraints. However, our research also illuminates existing limitations, including instances of LLM ``going down rabbit holes'', challenges in comprehensive information transfer between planning and execution modules, and critical safety concerns that necessitate human oversight.

### From Geometry to Observation: Gravitational Waves and the Raychaudhuri   Equation
**Authors**: Sougata Bhunia, Anubhab Dutta, Debashis Gangopadhyay, Goutam Manna

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T11:49:23Z

**Summary**: Gravitational waves (GWs) are independent of any particular theory of gravity. The universality of this notion is highlighted by the Raychaudhuri equation (RE), which is independent of any theory of gravity and contains the Ricci tensor $R_{\mu\nu}$ as a key ingredient, thereby connecting spacetime geometry with matter-energy content. Under small metric perturbations, $R_{\mu\nu} \propto \Box h_{\mu\nu}$, where $h_{\mu\nu}$ is the perturbation, indicating that various gravity theories, via their corresponding $R_{\mu\nu}$, produce different gravitational wave equations. In the framework of Einstein's gravity, this leads to the standard wave equation. This study analyzes a modified form, {\it GW-inspired RE}, within the homogeneous and isotropic FLRW background to investigate late-time cosmic acceleration and structure formation. We employ {\it Pantheon+ SNe Ia, Hubble, and BAO} datasets to constrain model parameters through Bayesian inference utilizing NUTS in {\it NumPyro}. A nuisance parameter $\mu_0$ is introduced to address residual systematics. This facilitates a robust estimation of $H_0$, $\Omega_{DE,0}$, and $r_d$, which addresses the resolution of the Hubble tension. We analyze the redshift evolution of the deceleration parameter, $q(z)$, both with and without $\mu_0$, emphasizing its influence on cosmic dynamics. The GW-inspired RE is reformulated as a harmonic oscillator, providing insight into expansion and geodesic focusing. A graphical comparison demonstrates the relationship $d^{GW}_L(z) = d^{EM}_L(z)$ utilizing GWOSC data. Thus, the RE in the context of small perturbation of the metric opens up whole new vistas of {\it observational astronomy.}

### Exploring the evolution of gravitational-wave emitters with efficient   emulation: Constraining the origins of binary black holes using normalising   flows
**Authors**: Storm Colloms, Christopher P L Berry, John Veitch, Michael Zevin

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T11:37:59Z

**Summary**: Binary population synthesis simulations allow detailed modelling of gravitational-wave sources from a variety of formation channels. These population models can be compared to the observed catalogue of merging binaries to infer the uncertain astrophysical input parameters describing binary formation and evolution, as well as relative rates between various formation pathways. However, it is computationally infeasible to run population synthesis simulations for all variations of uncertain input physics. We demonstrate the use of normalising flows to emulate population synthesis results and interpolate between astrophysical input parameters. Using current gravitational-wave observations of binary black holes, we use our trained normalising flows to infer branching ratios between multiple formation channels, and simultaneously infer common-envelope efficiency and natal spins across a continuous parameter range. Given our set of formation channel models, we infer the natal spin to be $0.04^{+0.04}_{-0.01}$, and the common-envelope efficiency to be $>3.7$ at 90% credibility, with the majority of underlying mergers coming from the common-envelope channel. Our framework allows us to measure population synthesis inputs where we do not have simulations, and better constrain the astrophysics underlying current gravitational-wave populations.

### Inference for SDEs driven by Hermite processes
**Authors**: Petr Coupek, Pavel Kriz

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T11:18:32Z

**Summary**: In the paper, we address parametric and non-parametric estimation for nonlinear stochastic differential equations with additive Hermite noise with possibly nonlinear scaling. We assume that a single trajectory of the solution is observed discretely and we propose estimators of the Hurst parameter and the Hermite order of the driving process as well as of the average noise intensity and noise intensity function. The estimators are based on the weighted quadratic variation whose properties are used, in particular, to prove weak consistency of the proposed estimators under in-fill asymptotics.

### On Almost Surely Safe Alignment of Large Language Models at   Inference-Time
**Authors**: Xiaotong Ji, Shyam Sundhar Ramesh, Matthieu Zimmer, Ilija Bogunovic, Jun Wang, Haitham Bou Ammar

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T10:54:05Z

**Summary**: We introduce a novel inference-time alignment approach for LLMs that aims to generate safe responses almost surely, i.e., with probability approaching one. Our approach models the generation of safe responses as a constrained Markov Decision Process (MDP) within the LLM's latent space. We augment a safety state that tracks the evolution of safety constraints and dynamically penalize unsafe generations to ensure the generation of safe responses. Consequently, we demonstrate formal safety guarantees w.r.t. the given cost model upon solving the MDP in the latent space with sufficiently large penalties. Building on this foundation, we propose InferenceGuard, a practical implementation that safely aligns LLMs without modifying the model weights. Empirically, we demonstrate that InferenceGuard effectively balances safety and task performance, outperforming existing inference-time alignment methods in generating safe and aligned responses. Our findings contribute to the advancement of safer LLM deployment through alignment at inference-time, thus presenting a promising alternative to resource-intensive, overfitting-prone alignment techniques like RLHF.

**Authors**: Jonas Wagner, Simon Müller, Christian Näther, Jan-Philipp Steghöfer, Andreas Both

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T10:46:35Z

**Summary**: A key challenge in security analysis is the manual evaluation of potential security weaknesses generated by static application security testing (SAST) tools. Numerous false positives (FPs) in these reports reduce the effectiveness of security analysis. We propose using Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve the assessment of SAST findings. We investigate the ability of LLMs to reduce FPs while trying to maintain a perfect true positive rate, using datasets extracted from the OWASP Benchmark (v1.2) and a real-world software project. Our results indicate that advanced prompting techniques, such as Chain-of-Thought and Self-Consistency, substantially improve FP detection. Notably, some LLMs identified approximately 62.5% of FPs in the OWASP Benchmark dataset without missing genuine weaknesses. Combining detections from different LLMs would increase this FP detection to approximately 78.9%. Additionally, we demonstrate our approach's generalizability using a real-world dataset covering five SAST tools, three programming languages, and infrastructure files. The best LLM detected 33.85% of all FPs without missing genuine weaknesses, while combining detections from different LLMs would increase this detection to 38.46%. Our findings highlight the potential of LLMs to complement traditional SAST tools, enhancing automation and reducing resources spent addressing false alarms.

### LearnAlign: Reasoning Data Selection for Reinforcement Learning in Large   Language Models Based on Improved Gradient Alignment
**Authors**: Shikun Li, Shipeng Li, Zhiqin Yang, Xinghua Zhang, Gaode Chen, Xiaobo Xia, Hengyu Liu, Zhe Peng

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T10:31:36Z

**Summary**: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a key technique for enhancing LLMs' reasoning abilities, yet its data inefficiency remains a major bottleneck. To address this critical yet challenging issue, we present a novel gradient-alignment-based method, named LearnAlign, which intelligently selects the learnable and representative training reasoning data for RL post-training. To overcome the issue of response-length bias in gradient norms, we introduce the data learnability based on the success rate, which can indicate the learning potential of each data point. Experiments across three mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly reduces training data requirements while achieving minor performance degradation or even improving performance compared to full-data training. For example, it reduces data requirements by up to 1,000 data points with better performance (77.53%) than that on the full dataset on GSM8K benchmark (77.04%). Furthermore, we show its effectiveness in the staged RL setting. This work provides valuable insights into data-efficient RL post-training and establishes a foundation for future research in optimizing reasoning data selection. To facilitate future work, we will release code.

### Dynamic Knowledge Integration for Evidence-Driven Counter-Argument   Generation with Large Language Models
**Authors**: Anar Yeginbergen, Maite Oronoz, Rodrigo Agerri

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T10:27:28Z

**Summary**: This paper investigates the role of dynamic external knowledge integration in improving counter-argument generation using Large Language Models (LLMs). While LLMs have shown promise in argumentative tasks, their tendency to generate lengthy, potentially unfactual responses highlights the need for more controlled and evidence-based approaches. We introduce a new manually curated dataset of argument and counter-argument pairs specifically designed to balance argumentative complexity with evaluative feasibility. We also propose a new LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation methodology that shows a stronger correlation with human judgments compared to traditional reference-based metrics. Our experimental results demonstrate that integrating dynamic external knowledge from the web significantly improves the quality of generated counter-arguments, particularly in terms of relatedness, persuasiveness, and factuality. The findings suggest that combining LLMs with real-time external knowledge retrieval offers a promising direction for developing more effective and reliable counter-argumentation systems.

### PR-Attack: Coordinated Prompt-RAG Attacks on Retrieval-Augmented   Generation in Large Language Models via Bilevel Optimization
**Authors**: Yang Jiao, Xiaodong Wang, Kai Yang

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T10:23:40Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of applications, e.g., medical question-answering, mathematical sciences, and code generation. However, they also exhibit inherent limitations, such as outdated knowledge and susceptibility to hallucinations. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising paradigm to address these issues, but it also introduces new vulnerabilities. Recent efforts have focused on the security of RAG-based LLMs, yet existing attack methods face three critical challenges: (1) their effectiveness declines sharply when only a limited number of poisoned texts can be injected into the knowledge database, (2) they lack sufficient stealth, as the attacks are often detectable by anomaly detection systems, which compromises their effectiveness, and (3) they rely on heuristic approaches to generate poisoned texts, lacking formal optimization frameworks and theoretic guarantees, which limits their effectiveness and applicability. To address these issues, we propose coordinated Prompt-RAG attack (PR-attack), a novel optimization-driven attack that introduces a small number of poisoned texts into the knowledge database while embedding a backdoor trigger within the prompt. When activated, the trigger causes the LLM to generate pre-designed responses to targeted queries, while maintaining normal behavior in other contexts. This ensures both high effectiveness and stealth. We formulate the attack generation process as a bilevel optimization problem leveraging a principled optimization framework to develop optimal poisoned texts and triggers. Extensive experiments across diverse LLMs and datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of PR-Attack, achieving a high attack success rate even with a limited number of poisoned texts and significantly improved stealth compared to existing methods.

**Authors**: Junghyun Koo, Marco A. Martinez-Ramirez, Wei-Hsiang Liao, Giorgio Fabbro, Michele Mancusi, Yuki Mitsufuji

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T10:21:56Z

**Summary**: Music mastering style transfer aims to model and apply the mastering characteristics of a reference track to a target track, simulating the professional mastering process. However, existing methods apply fixed processing based on a reference track, limiting users' ability to fine-tune the results to match their artistic intent. In this paper, we introduce the ITO-Master framework, a reference-based mastering style transfer system that integrates Inference-Time Optimization (ITO) to enable finer user control over the mastering process. By optimizing the reference embedding during inference, our approach allows users to refine the output dynamically, making micro-level adjustments to achieve more precise mastering results. We explore both black-box and white-box methods for modeling mastering processors and demonstrate that ITO improves mastering performance across different styles. Through objective evaluation, subjective listening tests, and qualitative analysis using text-based conditioning with CLAP embeddings, we validate that ITO enhances mastering style similarity while offering increased adaptability. Our framework provides an effective and user-controllable solution for mastering style transfer, allowing users to refine their results beyond the initial style transfer.

### Training Multi-Layer Binary Neural Networks With Local Binary Error   Signals
**Authors**: Luca Colombo, Fabrizio Pittorino, Manuel Roveri

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T10:02:13Z

**Summary**: Binary Neural Networks (BNNs) significantly reduce computational complexity and memory usage in machine and deep learning by representing weights and activations with just one bit. However, most existing training algorithms for BNNs rely on quantization-aware floating-point Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), limiting the full exploitation of binary operations to the inference phase only. In this work, we propose, for the first time, a fully binary and gradient-free training algorithm for multi-layer BNNs, eliminating the need for back-propagated floating-point gradients. Specifically, the proposed algorithm relies on local binary error signals and binary weight updates, employing integer-valued hidden weights that serve as a synaptic metaplasticity mechanism, thereby enhancing its neurobiological plausibility. Our proposed solution enables the training of binary multi-layer perceptrons by using exclusively XNOR, Popcount, and increment/decrement operations. Experimental results on multi-class classification benchmarks show test accuracy improvements of up to +35.47% over the only existing fully binary single-layer state-of-the-art solution. Compared to full-precision SGD, our solution improves test accuracy by up to +35.30% under the same total memory demand, while also reducing computational cost by two to three orders of magnitude in terms of the total number of Boolean gates. The proposed algorithm is made available to the scientific community as a public repository.

### Revolutionizing Validation and Verification: Explainable Testing   Methodologies for Intelligent Automotive Decision-Making Systems
**Authors**: Halit Eris, Stefan Wagner

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T09:55:56Z

**Summary**: Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS) use complex decision-making (DM) models with multimodal sensory inputs, making rigorous validation and verification (V&V) essential for safety and reliability. These models pose challenges in diagnosing failures, tracing anomalies, and maintaining transparency, with current manual testing methods being inefficient and labor-intensive. This vision paper presents a methodology that integrates explainability, transparency, and interpretability into V&V processes. We propose refining V&V requirements through literature reviews and stakeholder input, generating explainable test scenarios via large language models (LLMs), and enabling real-time validation in simulation environments. Our framework includes test oracle, explanation generation, and a test chatbot, with empirical studies planned to evaluate improvements in diagnostic efficiency and transparency. Our goal is to streamline V&V, reduce resources, and build user trust in autonomous technologies.

### Reward-Agnostic Prompt Optimization for Text-to-Image Diffusion Models
**Authors**: Semin Kim, Yeonwoo Cha, Jaehoon Yoo, Seunghoon Hong

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T09:02:05Z

**Summary**: We investigate a general approach for improving user prompts in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models by finding prompts that maximize a reward function specified at test-time. Although diverse reward models are used for evaluating image generation, existing automated prompt engineering methods typically target specific reward configurations. Consequently, these specialized designs exhibit suboptimal performance when applied to new prompt engineering scenarios involving different reward models. To address this limitation, we introduce RATTPO (Reward-Agnostic Test-Time Prompt Optimization), a flexible test-time optimization method applicable across various reward scenarios without modification. RATTPO iteratively searches for optimized prompts by querying large language models (LLMs) \textit{without} requiring reward-specific task descriptions. Instead, it uses the optimization trajectory and a novel reward-aware feedback signal (termed a "hint") as context. Empirical results demonstrate the versatility of RATTPO, effectively enhancing user prompts across diverse reward setups that assess various generation aspects, such as aesthetics, general human preference, or spatial relationships between objects. RATTPO surpasses other test-time search baselines in search efficiency, using up to 3.5 times less inference budget, and, given sufficient inference budget, achieves performance comparable to learning-based baselines that require reward-specific fine-tuning. The code is available at https://github.com/seminkim/RATTPO.

### Adapting While Learning: Grounding LLMs for Scientific Problems with   Intelligent Tool Usage Adaptation
**Authors**: Bohan Lyu, Yadi Cao, Duncan Watson-Parris, Leon Bergen, Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick, Rose Yu

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T08:54:13Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate promising capabilities in solving scientific problems but often suffer from the issue of hallucination. While integrating LLMs with tools can mitigate this issue, models fine-tuned on tool usage become overreliant on them and incur unnecessary costs. Inspired by how human experts assess problem complexity before selecting solutions, we propose a novel two-component fine-tuning method, Adapting While Learning (AWL). In the first component, World Knowledge Learning (WKL), LLMs internalize scientific knowledge by learning from tool-generated solutions. In the second component, Tool Usage Adaptation (TUA), we categorize problems as easy or hard based on the model's accuracy, and train it to maintain direct reasoning for easy problems while switching to tools for hard ones. We validate our method on six scientific benchmark datasets across climate science, epidemiology, physics, and other domains. Compared to the original instruct model (8B), models post-trained with AWL achieve 29.11% higher answer accuracy and 12.72% better tool usage accuracy, even surpassing state-of-the-art models including GPT-4o and Claude-3.5 on four custom-created datasets. Our code is open-source at https://github.com/Rose-STL-Lab/Adapting-While-Learning.

### Evolutionary models for the Very Massive Stars in the R136 cluster of 30   Doradus in the Large Magellanic Cloud
**Authors**: Z. Keszthelyi, S. A. Brands, A. de Koter, N. Langer, J. Puls

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T08:48:16Z

**Summary**: The cluster R136 in the LMC contains a population of stars in excess of 100 M$_\odot$, including R136a1, the most massive star known. Very Massive Stars (VMSs) play an influential role in feedback processes and may potentially produce exotic supernova types and black holes of tens of solar masses. The evolutionary history and final fate of the three most luminous stars, R136a1, R136a2, and R136a3, has been a puzzling issue. We aim to resolve this by rotating single-star MESA models. We produce interpolated model grids and apply a Markov-Chain Monte Carlo analysis to compare our models with observations. The nature of supernova progenitors strongly depends on mass loss and the AM coupling schemes. We predict no pair-instability and no GRB progenitors from our fiducial model grid at LMC metallicity. The onset of Wolf-Rayet-type mass-loss rates on the main sequence leads to a rapid decrease in stellar mass and luminosity. The mass turnover implies that the evolutionary history can only be inferred if additional constraints are available. We utilise the surface helium abundance, which poses a conundrum: R136a1, the most luminous star, is less enriched in helium than R136a2 and R136a3. We propose that this can be explained if both R136a2 and R136a3 were initially more massive than R136a1. From a rigorous confrontation of our models to spectroscopically-derived observables, we estimate an initial mass of 346$\pm41$ M$_\odot$ for R136a1, and $\gtrsim$500 M$_\odot$ for R136a2 and R136a3. Even though VMSs are only present in the youngest clusters below 2 Myr of age, our study strengthens their role in local and galaxy evolution. At LMC metallicity, they will be observable as helium-enriched massive stars after their drastic mass loss, produced via single-star evolution. If the core collapse leads to a supernova, it will be of Type Ib/c. [abridged]

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T08:26:12Z

**Summary**: Due to an exponential increase in published research articles, it is impossible for individual scientists to read all publications, even within their own research field. In this work, we investigate the use of large language models (LLMs) for the purpose of extracting the main concepts and semantic information from scientific abstracts in the domain of materials science to find links that were not noticed by humans and thus to suggest inspiring near/mid-term future research directions. We show that LLMs can extract concepts more efficiently than automated keyword extraction methods to build a concept graph as an abstraction of the scientific literature. A machine learning model is trained to predict emerging combinations of concepts, i.e. new research ideas, based on historical data. We demonstrate that integrating semantic concept information leads to an increased prediction performance. The applicability of our model is demonstrated in qualitative interviews with domain experts based on individualized model suggestions. We show that the model can inspire materials scientists in their creative thinking process by predicting innovative combinations of topics that have not yet been investigated.

### Hamiltonian-learning quantum magnets with non-local impurity tomography
**Authors**: Greta Lupi, Jose L. Lado

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T08:08:43Z

**Summary**: Impurities in quantum materials have provided successful strategies for learning properties of complex states, ranging from unconventional superconductors to topological insulators. In quantum magnetism, inferring the Hamiltonian of an engineered system becomes a challenging open problem in the presence of complex interactions. Here we show how a supervised machine-learning technique can be used to infer Hamiltonian parameters from atomically engineered quantum magnets by inferring fluctuations of the ground states due to the presence of impurities. We demonstrate our methodology both with a fermionic model with spin-orbit coupling, as well as with many-body spin models with long-range exchange and anisotropic exchange interactions. We show that our approach enables performing Hamiltonian extraction in the presence of significant noise, providing a strategy to perform Hamiltonian learning with experimental observables in atomic-scale quantum magnets. Our results establish a strategy to perform Hamiltonian learning by exploiting the impact of impurities in complex quantum many-body states.

### Integrating Traditional Technical Analysis with AI: A Multi-Agent   LLM-Based Approach to Stock Market Forecasting
**Authors**: Michał Wawer, Jarosław A. Chudziak

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T08:03:36Z

**Summary**: Traditional technical analysis methods face limitations in accurately predicting trends in today's complex financial markets. This paper introduces ElliottAgents, an multi-agent system that integrates the Elliott Wave Principle with AI for stock market forecasting. The inherent complexity of financial markets, characterized by non-linear dynamics, noise, and susceptibility to unpredictable external factors, poses significant challenges for accurate prediction. To address these challenges, the system employs LLMs to enhance natural language understanding and decision-making capabilities within a multi-agent framework. By leveraging technologies such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), ElliottAgents performs continuous, multi-faceted analysis of market data to identify wave patterns and predict future price movements. The research explores the system's ability to process historical stock data, recognize Elliott wave patterns, and generate actionable insights for traders. Experimental results, conducted on historical data from major U.S. companies, validate the system's effectiveness in pattern recognition and trend forecasting across various time frames. This paper contributes to the field of AI-driven financial analysis by demonstrating how traditional technical analysis methods can be effectively combined with modern AI approaches to create more reliable and interpretable market prediction systems.

### Transformers for Stratified Spectropolarimetric Inversion: Proof of   Concept
**Authors**: Ryan James Campbell, Mihalis Mathioudakis, Carlos Quintero Noda

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T07:57:55Z

**Summary**: Solar spectropolarimetric inversion -- inferring atmospheric conditions from the Stokes vector -- is a key diagnostic tool for understanding solar magnetism, but traditional inversion methods are computationally expensive and sensitive to local minima. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) offer faster solutions, but are often restricted to shallow models or a few spectral lines. We present a proof-of-concept study using a transformer machine learning (ML) model for multi-line, full-Stokes inversion, to infer stratified parameters from synthetic spectra produced from 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations. We synthesise a large set of Stokes vectors using forward modelling across 15 spectral lines spanning the deep photosphere towards the chromosphere. The model maps full-Stokes input to temperature, magnetic field strength, inclination, azimuth (encoded as $\sin2\phi$, $\cos2\phi$), and line-of-sight velocity as a function of optical depth. The transformer incorporates an attention mechanism that allows the model to focus on the most informative regions of the spectrum for each inferred parameter, and uses positional embedding to encode wavelength and depth order. We benchmark it against a multilayer perceptron (MLP), test robustness to noise, and assess generalisation. The transformer outperforms the MLP, especially in the higher layers and for magnetic parameters, yielding higher correlations and more regularised stratifications. The model retains strong performance across a range of noise levels typical for real observations, with magnetic parameter inference degrading predictably while temperature and velocity remain stable. We establish transformer architectures as a powerful tool for spectropolarimetric regression. This approach paves the way for analysis of large datasets from large solar telescopes.

### DVFS-Aware DNN Inference on GPUs: Latency Modeling and Performance   Analysis
**Authors**: Yunchu Han, Zhaojun Nan, Sheng Zhou, Zhisheng Niu

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T07:42:34Z

**Summary**: The rapid development of deep neural networks (DNNs) is inherently accompanied by the problem of high computational costs. To tackle this challenge, dynamic voltage frequency scaling (DVFS) is emerging as a promising technology for balancing the latency and energy consumption of DNN inference by adjusting the computing frequency of processors. However, most existing models of DNN inference time are based on the CPU-DVFS technique, and directly applying the CPU-DVFS model to DNN inference on GPUs will lead to significant errors in optimizing latency and energy consumption. In this paper, we propose a DVFS-aware latency model to precisely characterize DNN inference time on GPUs. We first formulate the DNN inference time based on extensive experiment results for different devices and analyze the impact of fitting parameters. Then by dividing DNNs into multiple blocks and obtaining the actual inference time, the proposed model is further verified. Finally, we compare our proposed model with the CPU-DVFS model in two specific cases. Evaluation results demonstrate that local inference optimization with our proposed model achieves a reduction of no less than 66% and 69% in inference time and energy consumption respectively. In addition, cooperative inference with our proposed model can improve the partition policy and reduce the energy consumption compared to the CPU-DVFS model.

### Efficient but Vulnerable: Benchmarking and Defending LLM Batch Prompting   Attack
**Authors**: Murong Yue, Ziyu Yao

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T07:32:36Z

**Summary**: Batch prompting, which combines a batch of multiple queries sharing the same context in one inference, has emerged as a promising solution to reduce inference costs. However, our study reveals a significant security vulnerability in batch prompting: malicious users can inject attack instructions into a batch, leading to unwanted interference across all queries, which can result in the inclusion of harmful content, such as phishing links, or the disruption of logical reasoning. In this paper, we construct BATCHSAFEBENCH, a comprehensive benchmark comprising 150 attack instructions of two types and 8k batch instances, to study the batch prompting vulnerability systematically. Our evaluation of both closed-source and open-weight LLMs demonstrates that all LLMs are susceptible to batch-prompting attacks. We then explore multiple defending approaches. While the prompting-based defense shows limited effectiveness for smaller LLMs, the probing-based approach achieves about 95% accuracy in detecting attacks. Additionally, we perform a mechanistic analysis to understand the attack and identify attention heads that are responsible for it.

### Ask, Fail, Repeat: Meeseeks, an Iterative Feedback Benchmark for LLMs'   Multi-turn Instruction-Following Ability
**Authors**: Jiaming Wang, Yunke Zhao, Peng Ding, Jun Kuang, Zongyu Wang, Xuezhi Cao, Xunliang Cai

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T07:25:51Z

**Summary**: The ability to follow instructions accurately is fundamental for Large Language Models (LLMs) to serve as reliable agents in real-world applications. For complex instructions, LLMs often struggle to fulfill all requirements in a single attempt. In practice, users typically provide iterative feedback until the LLM generates a response that meets all requirements. However, existing instruction-following benchmarks are either single-turn or introduce new requirements in each turn without allowing self-correction. To address this gap, we propose Meeseeks. Meeseeks simulates realistic human-LLM interactions through an iterative feedback framework, which enables models to self-correct based on specific requirement failures in each turn, better reflecting real-world user-end usage patterns. Meanwhile, the benchmark implements a comprehensive evaluation system with 38 capability tags organized across three dimensions: Intent Recognition, Granular Content Validation, and Output Structure Validation. Through rigorous evaluation across LLMs, Meeseeks provides valuable insights into LLMs' instruction-following capabilities in multi-turn scenarios.

### RealSR-R1: Reinforcement Learning for Real-World Image Super-Resolution   with Vision-Language Chain-of-Thought
**Authors**: Junbo Qiao, Miaomiao Cai, Wei Li, Yutong Liu, Xudong Huang, Gaoqi He, Jiao Xie, Jie Hu, Xinghao Chen, Shaohui Lin

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T07:21:21Z

**Summary**: Real-World Image Super-Resolution is one of the most challenging task in image restoration. However, existing methods struggle with an accurate understanding of degraded image content, leading to reconstructed results that are both low-fidelity and unnatural. We present RealSR-R1 in this work, which empowers the RealSR models with understanding and reasoning capabilities. Inspired by the success of Chain of Thought (CoT) in large language models (LLMs), we simulate the human process of handling degraded images and propose the VLCoT framework, which integrates vision and language reasoning. The framework aims to precisely restore image details by progressively generating more comprehensive text and higher-resolution images. To overcome the challenge of traditional supervised learning CoT failing to generalize to real-world scenarios, we introduce, for the first time, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) into the Real-World Image Super-Resolution task. We propose VLCoT-GRPO as a solution, which designs four reward functions: (1) Format reward, used to standardize the CoT process; (2) Degradation reward, to incentivize accurate degradation estimation; (3) Understanding reward, to ensure the accuracy of the generated content; and (4) Generation reward, where we propose using a visual expert model to evaluate the quality of generated images, encouraging the model to generate more realistic images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed RealSR-R1 can generate realistic details and accurately understand image content, particularly in semantically rich scenes or images with severe degradation.

### MIST: Jailbreaking Black-box Large Language Models via Iterative   Semantic Tuning
**Authors**: Muyang Zheng, Yuanzhi Yao, Changting Lin, Rui Wang, Meng Han

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T07:16:47Z

**Summary**: Despite efforts to align large language models (LLMs) with societal and moral values, these models remain susceptible to jailbreak attacks--methods designed to elicit harmful responses. Jailbreaking black-box LLMs is considered challenging due to the discrete nature of token inputs, restricted access to the target LLM, and limited query budget. To address the issues above, we propose an effective method for jailbreaking black-box large language Models via Iterative Semantic Tuning, named MIST. MIST enables attackers to iteratively refine prompts that preserve the original semantic intent while inducing harmful content. Specifically, to balance semantic similarity with computational efficiency, MIST incorporates two key strategies: sequential synonym search, and its advanced version--order-determining optimization. Extensive experiments across two open-source models and four closed-source models demonstrate that MIST achieves competitive attack success rates and attack transferability compared with other state-of-the-art white-box and black-box jailbreak methods. Additionally, we conduct experiments on computational efficiency to validate the practical viability of MIST.

### Planning of Heuristics: Strategic Planning on Large Language Models with   Monte Carlo Tree Search for Automating Heuristic Optimization
**Authors**: Hui Wang, Xufeng Zhang, Chaoxu Mu

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T07:14:59Z

**Summary**: Heuristics have achieved great success in solving combinatorial optimization problems~(COPs). However, heuristics designed by humans require too much domain knowledge and testing time. Since Large Language Models~(LLMs) possess strong capabilities to understand and generate content with a knowledge base that covers various domains, they offer potential ways to automatically optimize heuristics. To this end, we propose Planning of Heuristics~(PoH), an optimization method that integrates LLM self-reflection with Monte Carlo Tree Search, a well-known planning algorithm. PoH iteratively refines generated heuristics by evaluating their performance and providing improvement suggestions. Our method enables to iteratively evaluate the generated heuristics~(states) and improve them based on the improvement suggestions~(actions) and evaluation results~(rewards), by effectively simulating future states to search for paths with higher rewards. In this paper, we apply PoH to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem and the Flow Shop Scheduling Problem. The experimental results show that PoH outperforms hand-crafted heuristics and other Automatic Heuristic Design methods based on LLMs, and achieves the state-of-the-art performance in automating heuristic optimization with LLMs to solve tested COPs, especially with large sizes.

### Reimagining Urban Science: Scaling Causal Inference with Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Yutong Xia, Ao Qu, Yunhan Zheng, Yihong Tang, Dingyi Zhuang, Yuxuan Liang, Shenhao Wang, Cathy Wu, Lijun Sun, Roger Zimmermann, Jinhua Zhao

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T07:09:39Z

**Summary**: Urban causal research is essential for understanding the complex, dynamic processes that shape cities and for informing evidence-based policies. However, current practices are often constrained by inefficient and biased hypothesis formulation, challenges in integrating multimodal data, and fragile experimental methodologies. Imagine a system that automatically estimates the causal impact of congestion pricing on commute times by income group or measures how new green spaces affect asthma rates across neighborhoods using satellite imagery and health reports, and then generates comprehensive, policy-ready outputs, including causal estimates, subgroup analyses, and actionable recommendations. In this Perspective, we propose UrbanCIA, an LLM-driven conceptual framework composed of four distinct modular agents responsible for hypothesis generation, data engineering, experiment design and execution, and results interpretation with policy insights. We begin by examining the current landscape of urban causal research through a structured taxonomy of research topics, data sources, and methodological approaches, revealing systemic limitations across the workflow. Next, we introduce the design principles and technological roadmap for the four modules in the proposed framework. We also propose evaluation criteria to assess the rigor and transparency of these AI-augmented processes. Finally, we reflect on the broader implications for human-AI collaboration, equity, and accountability. We call for a new research agenda that embraces LLM-driven tools as catalysts for more scalable, reproducible, and inclusive urban research.

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T07:05:18Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) trained via reinforcement learning with verifiable reward (RLVR) have achieved breakthroughs on tasks with explicit, automatable verification, such as software programming and mathematical problems. Extending RLVR to electronic design automation (EDA), especially automatically generating hardware description languages (HDLs) like Verilog from natural-language (NL) specifications, however, poses three key challenges: the lack of automated and accurate verification environments, the scarcity of high-quality NL-code pairs, and the prohibitive computation cost of RLVR. To this end, we introduce CodeV-R1, an RLVR framework for training Verilog generation LLMs. First, we develop a rule-based testbench generator that performs robust equivalence checking against golden references. Second, we propose a round-trip data synthesis method that pairs open-source Verilog snippets with LLM-generated NL descriptions, verifies code-NL-code consistency via the generated testbench, and filters out inequivalent examples to yield a high-quality dataset. Third, we employ a two-stage "distill-then-RL" training pipeline: distillation for the cold start of reasoning abilities, followed by adaptive DAPO, our novel RLVR algorithm that can reduce training cost by adaptively adjusting sampling rate. The resulting model, CodeV-R1-7B, achieves 68.6% and 72.9% pass@1 on VerilogEval v2 and RTLLM v1.1, respectively, surpassing prior state-of-the-art by 12~20%, while matching or even exceeding the performance of 671B DeepSeek-R1. We will release our model, training pipeline, and dataset to facilitate research in EDA and LLM communities.

### Alto: Orchestrating Distributed Compound AI Systems with Nested Ancestry
**Authors**: Deepti Raghavan, Keshav Santhanam, Muhammad Shahir Rahman, Nayani Modugula, Luis Gaspar Schroeder, Maximilien Cura, Houjun Liu, Pratiksha Thaker, Philip Levis, Matei Zaharia

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T07:03:22Z

**Summary**: Compound AI applications chain together subcomponents such as generative language models, document retrievers, and embedding models. Applying traditional systems optimizations such as parallelism and pipelining in compound AI systems is difficult because each component has different constraints in terms of the granularity and type of data that it ingests. New data is often generated during intermediate computations, and text streams may be split into smaller, independent fragments (such as documents to sentences) which may then be re-aggregated at later parts of the computation. Due to this complexity, existing systems to serve compound AI queries do not fully take advantage of parallelism and pipelining opportunities.   We present Alto, a framework that automatically optimizes execution of compound AI queries through streaming and parallelism. Bento introduces a new abstraction called nested ancestry, a metadata hierarchy that allows the system to correctly track partial outputs and aggregate data across the heterogeneous constraints of the components of compound AI applications. This metadata is automatically inferred from the programming model, allowing developers to express complex dataflow patterns without needing to reason manually about the details of routing and aggregation. Implementations of four applications in Alto outperform or match implementations in LangGraph, a popular existing AI programming framework. Alto implementations match or improve latency by between 10-30%.

### DistillNote: LLM-based clinical note summaries improve heart failure   diagnosis
**Authors**: Heloisa Oss Boll, Antonio Oss Boll, Leticia Puttlitz Boll, Ameen Abu Hanna, Iacer Calixto

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T06:45:40Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) offer unprecedented opportunities to generate concise summaries of patient information and alleviate the burden of clinical documentation that overwhelms healthcare providers. We present Distillnote, a framework for LLM-based clinical note summarization, and generate over 64,000 admission note summaries through three techniques: (1) One-step, direct summarization, and a divide-and-conquer approach involving (2) Structured summarization focused on independent clinical insights, and (3) Distilled summarization that further condenses the Structured summaries. We test how useful are the summaries by using them to predict heart failure compared to a model trained on the original notes. Distilled summaries achieve 79% text compression and up to 18.2% improvement in AUPRC compared to an LLM trained on the full notes. We also evaluate the quality of the generated summaries in an LLM-as-judge evaluation as well as through blinded pairwise comparisons with clinicians. Evaluations indicate that one-step summaries are favoured by clinicians according to relevance and clinical actionability, while distilled summaries offer optimal efficiency (avg. 6.9x compression-to-performance ratio) and significantly reduce hallucinations. We release our summaries on PhysioNet to encourage future research.

## Keyword: LLM Deployment 
 ### No Free Lunch: Rethinking Internal Feedback for LLM Reasoning
**Authors**: Yanzhi Zhang, Zhaoxi Zhang, Haoxiang Guan, Yilin Cheng, Yitong Duan, Chen Wang, Yue Wang, Shuxin Zheng, Jiyan He

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T17:59:52Z

**Summary**: Reinforcement learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm for post-training large language models (LLMs) to improve reasoning. Approaches like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) have shown strong results, but they require extensive external supervision. We investigate an alternative class of methods, Reinforcement Learning from Internal Feedback (RLIF), which relies solely on intrinsic model-derived signals instead of external rewards. In particular, we leverage unsupervised reward proxies such as token-level entropy, trajectory-level entropy, and self-certainty. Our theoretical analysis shows these internal objectives are partially equivalent, and we empirically evaluate various RLIF strategies on challenging math reasoning benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that RLIF can boost the reasoning performance of base LLMs at the beginning phase of the training, matching or surpassing RLVR techniques on these tasks. However, when training progresses, performance degrades even below the model before training. Moreover, we find that RLIF yields little improvement for instruction-tuned models, indicating diminishing returns of intrinsic feedback once an LLM is already instruction-tuned. We further analyze this limitation by mixing model weights and explain the reason of RLIF's training behaviors, providing practical guidelines for integrating internal feedback signals into LLM training. We hope our analysis of internal feedback will inform more principled and effective strategies for LLM post-training.

### Long-term Traffic Simulation with Interleaved Autoregressive Motion and   Scenario Generation
**Authors**: Xiuyu Yang, Shuhan Tan, Philipp Krähenbühl

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T17:59:21Z

**Summary**: An ideal traffic simulator replicates the realistic long-term point-to-point trip that a self-driving system experiences during deployment. Prior models and benchmarks focus on closed-loop motion simulation for initial agents in a scene. This is problematic for long-term simulation. Agents enter and exit the scene as the ego vehicle enters new regions. We propose InfGen, a unified next-token prediction model that performs interleaved closed-loop motion simulation and scene generation. InfGen automatically switches between closed-loop motion simulation and scene generation mode. It enables stable long-term rollout simulation. InfGen performs at the state-of-the-art in short-term (9s) traffic simulation, and significantly outperforms all other methods in long-term (30s) simulation. The code and model of InfGen will be released at https://orangesodahub.github.io/InfGen

### AQA-Bench: An Interactive Benchmark for Evaluating LLMs' Sequential   Reasoning Ability
**Authors**: Siwei Yang, Bingchen Zhao, Cihang Xie

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T17:57:43Z

**Summary**: This paper introduces AQA-Bench, a novel benchmark to assess the sequential reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in algorithmic contexts, such as depth-first search (DFS). The key feature of our evaluation benchmark lies in its interactive evaluation protocol - for example, in DFS, the availability of each node's connected edge is contingent upon the model's traversal to that node, thereby necessitating the LLM's ability to effectively remember visited nodes and strategize subsequent moves considering the possible environmental feedback in the future steps. We comprehensively build AQA-Bench with three different algorithms, namely binary search, depth-first search, and breadth-first search, and to evaluate the sequential reasoning ability of 14 different LLMs. Our investigations reveal several interesting findings: (1) Closed-source models like GPT-4 and Gemini generally show much stronger sequential reasoning ability, significantly outperforming open-source LLMs. (2) Naively providing in-context examples may inadvertently hurt few-shot performance in an interactive environment due to over-fitting to examples. (3) Instead of using optimal steps from another test case as the in-context example, a very limited number of predecessor steps in the current test case following the optimal policy can substantially boost small models' performance. (4) The performance gap between weak models and strong models is greatly due to the incapability of weak models to start well. (5) The scaling correlation between performance and model size is not always significant, sometimes even showcasing an inverse trend. We hope our study can catalyze future work on advancing the understanding and enhancement of LLMs' capabilities in sequential reasoning. The code is available at https://github.com/UCSC-VLAA/AQA-Bench.

### Fine-Tuning Lowers Safety and Disrupts Evaluation Consistency
**Authors**: Kathleen C. Fraser, Hillary Dawkins, Isar Nejadgholi, Svetlana Kiritchenko

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T17:57:12Z

**Summary**: Fine-tuning a general-purpose large language model (LLM) for a specific domain or task has become a routine procedure for ordinary users. However, fine-tuning is known to remove the safety alignment features of the model, even when the fine-tuning data does not contain any harmful content. We consider this to be a critical failure mode of LLMs due to the widespread uptake of fine-tuning, combined with the benign nature of the "attack". Most well-intentioned developers are likely unaware that they are deploying an LLM with reduced safety. On the other hand, this known vulnerability can be easily exploited by malicious actors intending to bypass safety guardrails. To make any meaningful progress in mitigating this issue, we first need reliable and reproducible safety evaluations. In this work, we investigate how robust a safety benchmark is to trivial variations in the experimental procedure, and the stochastic nature of LLMs. Our initial experiments expose surprising variance in the results of the safety evaluation, even when seemingly inconsequential changes are made to the fine-tuning setup. Our observations have serious implications for how researchers in this field should report results to enable meaningful comparisons in the future.

### Dissecting the SWE-Bench Leaderboards: Profiling Submitters and   Architectures of LLM- and Agent-Based Repair Systems
**Authors**: Matias Martinez, Xavier Franch

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T17:57:08Z

**Summary**: The rapid progress in Automated Program Repair (APR) has been driven by advances in AI, particularly large language models (LLMs) and agent-based systems. SWE-Bench is a recent benchmark designed to evaluate LLM-based repair systems using real issues and pull requests mined from 12 popular open-source Python repositories. Its public leaderboards, SWE-Bench Lite and SWE-Bench Verified, have become central platforms for tracking progress and comparing solutions. However, because the submission process does not require detailed documentation, the architectural design and origin of many solutions remain unclear. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study of all submissions to the SWE-Bench Lite (68 entries) and Verified (79 entries) leaderboards, analyzing 67 unique approaches across dimensions such as submitter type, product availability, LLM usage, and system architecture. Our findings reveal the dominance of proprietary LLMs (especially Claude 3.5/3.7), the presence of both agentic and non-agentic designs, and a contributor base spanning from individual developers to large tech companies.

### High-Dimensional Interlingual Representations of Large Language Models
**Authors**: Bryan Wilie, Samuel Cahyawijaya, Junxian He, Pascale Fung

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T17:55:07Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) trained on massive multilingual datasets hint at the formation of interlingual constructs--a shared subspace in the representation space. However, evidence regarding this phenomenon is mixed, leaving it unclear whether these models truly develop unified interlingual representations, or present a partially aligned constructs. We explore 31 diverse languages varying on their resource-levels, typologies, and geographical regions; and find that multilingual LLMs exhibit inconsistent cross-lingual alignments. To address this, we propose an interlingual representation framework identifying both the shared interlingual semantic subspace and fragmented components, existed due to representational limitations. We introduce Interlingual Local Overlap (ILO) score to quantify interlingual alignment by comparing the local neighborhood structures of high-dimensional representations. We utilize ILO to investigate the impact of single-language fine-tuning on the interlingual representations in multilingual LLMs. Our results indicate that training exclusively on a single language disrupts the alignment in early layers, while freezing these layers preserves the alignment of interlingual representations, leading to improved cross-lingual generalization. These results validate our framework and metric for evaluating interlingual representation, and further underscore that interlingual alignment is crucial for scalable multilingual learning.

### Confidence Scoring for LLM-Generated SQL in Supply Chain Data Extraction
**Authors**: Jiekai Ma, Yikai Zhao

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T17:54:18Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently enabled natural language interfaces that translate user queries into executable SQL, offering a powerful solution for non-technical stakeholders to access structured data. However, one of the limitation that LLMs do not natively express uncertainty makes it difficult to assess the reliability of their generated queries. This paper presents a case study that evaluates multiple approaches to estimate confidence scores for LLM-generated SQL in supply chain data retrieval. We investigated three strategies: (1) translation-based consistency checks; (2) embedding-based semantic similarity between user questions and generated SQL; and (3) self-reported confidence scores directly produced by the LLM. Our findings reveal that LLMs are often overconfident in their own outputs, which limits the effectiveness of self-reported confidence. In contrast, embedding-based similarity methods demonstrate strong discriminative power in identifying inaccurate SQL.

### Hunyuan-GameCraft: High-dynamic Interactive Game Video Generation with   Hybrid History Condition
**Authors**: Jiaqi Li, Junshu Tang, Zhiyong Xu, Longhuang Wu, Yuan Zhou, Shuai Shao, Tianbao Yu, Zhiguo Cao, Qinglin Lu

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T17:50:37Z

**Summary**: Recent advances in diffusion-based and controllable video generation have enabled high-quality and temporally coherent video synthesis, laying the groundwork for immersive interactive gaming experiences. However, current methods face limitations in dynamics, generality, long-term consistency, and efficiency, which limit the ability to create various gameplay videos. To address these gaps, we introduce Hunyuan-GameCraft, a novel framework for high-dynamic interactive video generation in game environments. To achieve fine-grained action control, we unify standard keyboard and mouse inputs into a shared camera representation space, facilitating smooth interpolation between various camera and movement operations. Then we propose a hybrid history-conditioned training strategy that extends video sequences autoregressively while preserving game scene information. Additionally, to enhance inference efficiency and playability, we achieve model distillation to reduce computational overhead while maintaining consistency across long temporal sequences, making it suitable for real-time deployment in complex interactive environments. The model is trained on a large-scale dataset comprising over one million gameplay recordings across over 100 AAA games, ensuring broad coverage and diversity, then fine-tuned on a carefully annotated synthetic dataset to enhance precision and control. The curated game scene data significantly improves the visual fidelity, realism and action controllability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Hunyuan-GameCraft significantly outperforms existing models, advancing the realism and playability of interactive game video generation.

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T17:50:07Z

**Summary**: Intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) have emerged as a cost-effective technology for terahertz (THz) communications by enabling programmable control of the wireless environment. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of IRSs-aided THz communications, covering hardware designs, advanced signal processing techniques, and practical deployment strategies. It first examines key THz reconfigurable metasurface architectures, including electronic, optical, phase-change material, and micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS)-based implementations, highlighting their reconfiguration mechanisms and challenges. Then, fundamental effects including near field and beam squint in wideband THz systems are analyzed, along with their impacts on system performance. The paper further explores conventional and beam-squint-assisted channel estimation methods, innovative beam management strategies, and deployment considerations across large- and small-scale scenarios. Practical experiments at 220 gigahertz (GHz) validate the effectiveness of IRS in improving signal strength and communication reliability for both single-user and multi-user setups.

### Detecting LLM-Generated Short Answers and Effects on Learner Performance
**Authors**: Shambhavi Bhushan, Danielle R Thomas, Conrad Borchers, Isha Raghuvanshi, Ralph Abboud, Erin Gatz, Shivang Gupta, Kenneth Koedinger

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T17:47:36Z

**Summary**: The increasing availability of large language models (LLMs) has raised concerns about their potential misuse in online learning. While tools for detecting LLM-generated text exist and are widely used by researchers and educators, their reliability varies. Few studies have compared the accuracy of detection methods, defined criteria to identify content generated by LLM, or evaluated the effect on learner performance from LLM misuse within learning. In this study, we define LLM-generated text within open responses as those produced by any LLM without paraphrasing or refinement, as evaluated by human coders. We then fine-tune GPT-4o to detect LLM-generated responses and assess the impact on learning from LLM misuse. We find that our fine-tuned LLM outperforms the existing AI detection tool GPTZero, achieving an accuracy of 80% and an F1 score of 0.78, compared to GPTZero's accuracy of 70% and macro F1 score of 0.50, demonstrating superior performance in detecting LLM-generated responses. We also find that learners suspected of LLM misuse in the open response question were more than twice as likely to correctly answer the corresponding posttest MCQ, suggesting potential misuse across both question types and indicating a bypass of the learning process. We pave the way for future work by demonstrating a structured, code-based approach to improve LLM-generated response detection and propose using auxiliary statistical indicators such as unusually high assessment scores on related tasks, readability scores, and response duration. In support of open science, we contribute data and code to support the fine-tuning of similar models for similar use cases.

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T17:42:13Z

**Summary**: In this paper, we introduce the AI Search Paradigm, a comprehensive blueprint for next-generation search systems capable of emulating human information processing and decision-making. The paradigm employs a modular architecture of four LLM-powered agents (Master, Planner, Executor and Writer) that dynamically adapt to the full spectrum of information needs, from simple factual queries to complex multi-stage reasoning tasks. These agents collaborate dynamically through coordinated workflows to evaluate query complexity, decompose problems into executable plans, and orchestrate tool usage, task execution, and content synthesis. We systematically present key methodologies for realizing this paradigm, including task planning and tool integration, execution strategies, aligned and robust retrieval-augmented generation, and efficient LLM inference, spanning both algorithmic techniques and infrastructure-level optimizations. By providing an in-depth guide to these foundational components, this work aims to inform the development of trustworthy, adaptive, and scalable AI search systems.

### TALE: A Tool-Augmented Framework for Reference-Free Evaluation of Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Sher Badshah, Ali Emami, Hassan Sajjad

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T17:31:59Z

**Summary**: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into real-world, autonomous applications, relying on static, pre-annotated references for evaluation poses significant challenges in cost, scalability, and completeness. We propose Tool-Augmented LLM Evaluation (TALE), a framework to assess LLM outputs without predetermined ground-truth answers. Unlike conventional metrics that compare to fixed references or depend solely on LLM-as-a-judge knowledge, TALE employs an agent with tool-access capabilities that actively retrieves and synthesizes external evidence. It iteratively generates web queries, collects information, summarizes findings, and refines subsequent searches through reflection. By shifting away from static references, TALE aligns with free-form question-answering tasks common in real-world scenarios. Experimental results on multiple free-form QA benchmarks show that TALE not only outperforms standard reference-based metrics for measuring response accuracy but also achieves substantial to near-perfect agreement with human evaluations. TALE enhances the reliability of LLM evaluations in real-world, dynamic scenarios without relying on static references.

### LLMs and Stack Overflow Discussions: Reliability, Impact, and Challenges
**Authors**: Leuson Da Silva, Jordan Samhi, Foutse Khomh

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T17:11:29Z

**Summary**: Since its release in November 2022, ChatGPT has shaken up Stack Overflow, the premier platform for developers queries on programming and software development. Demonstrating an ability to generate instant, human-like responses to technical questions, ChatGPT has ignited debates within the developer community about the evolving role of human-driven platforms in the age of generative AI. Two months after ChatGPT release, Meta released its answer with its own Large Language Model (LLM) called LLaMA: the race was on. We conducted an empirical study analyzing questions from Stack Overflow and using these LLMs to address them. This way, we aim to (i) quantify the reliability of LLMs answers and their potential to replace Stack Overflow in the long term; (ii) identify and understand why LLMs fail; (iii) measure users activity evolution with Stack Overflow over time; and (iv) compare LLMs together. Our empirical results are unequivocal: ChatGPT and LLaMA challenge human expertise, yet do not outperform it for some domains, while a significant decline in user posting activity has been observed. Furthermore, we also discuss the impact of our findings regarding the usage and development of new LLMs and provide guidelines for future challenges faced by users and researchers.

### The MedPerturb Dataset: What Non-Content Perturbations Reveal About   Human and Clinical LLM Decision Making
**Authors**: Abinitha Gourabathina, Yuexing Hao, Walter Gerych, Marzyeh Ghassemi

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T17:09:27Z

**Summary**: Clinical robustness is critical to the safe deployment of medical Large Language Models (LLMs), but key questions remain about how LLMs and humans may differ in response to the real-world variability typified by clinical settings. To address this, we introduce MedPerturb, a dataset designed to systematically evaluate medical LLMs under controlled perturbations of clinical input. MedPerturb consists of clinical vignettes spanning a range of pathologies, each transformed along three axes: (1) gender modifications (e.g., gender-swapping or gender-removal); (2) style variation (e.g., uncertain phrasing or colloquial tone); and (3) format changes (e.g., LLM-generated multi-turn conversations or summaries). With MedPerturb, we release a dataset of 800 clinical contexts grounded in realistic input variability, outputs from four LLMs, and three human expert reads per clinical context. We use MedPerturb in two case studies to reveal how shifts in gender identity cues, language style, or format reflect diverging treatment selections between humans and LLMs. We find that LLMs are more sensitive to gender and style perturbations while human annotators are more sensitive to LLM-generated format perturbations such as clinical summaries. Our results highlight the need for evaluation frameworks that go beyond static benchmarks to assess the similarity between human clinician and LLM decisions under the variability characteristic of clinical settings.

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T16:50:07Z

**Summary**: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting is a popular in-context learning (ICL) approach for large language models (LLMs), especially when tackling complex reasoning tasks. Traditional ICL approaches construct prompts using examples that contain questions similar to the input question. However, CoT prompting, which includes crucial intermediate reasoning steps (rationales) within its examples, necessitates selecting examples based on these rationales rather than the questions themselves. Existing methods require human experts or pre-trained LLMs to describe the skill, a high-level abstraction of rationales, to guide the selection. These methods, however, are often costly and difficult to scale. Instead, this paper introduces a new approach named Latent Reasoning Skills (LaRS) that employs unsupervised learning to create a latent space representation of rationales, with a latent variable called a reasoning skill. Concurrently, LaRS learns a reasoning policy to determine the required reasoning skill for a given question. Then the ICL examples are selected by aligning the reasoning skills between past examples and the question. This approach is theoretically grounded and compute-efficient, eliminating the need for auxiliary LLM inference or manual prompt design. Empirical results demonstrate that LaRS consistently outperforms SOTA skill-based selection methods, processing example banks four times faster, reducing LLM inferences during the selection stage by half, and showing greater robustness to sub-optimal example banks.

### Do We Need Large VLMs for Spotting Soccer Actions?
**Authors**: Ritabrata Chakraborty, Rajatsubhra Chakraborty, Avijit Dasgupta, Sandeep Chaurasia

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T16:45:54Z

**Summary**: Traditional video-based tasks like soccer action spotting rely heavily on visual inputs, often requiring complex and computationally expensive models to process dense video data. In this work, we propose a shift from this video-centric approach to a text-based task, making it lightweight and scalable by utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) instead of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). We posit that expert commentary, which provides rich, fine-grained descriptions and contextual cues such as excitement and tactical insights, contains enough information to reliably spot key actions in a match. To demonstrate this, we use the SoccerNet Echoes dataset, which provides timestamped commentary, and employ a system of three LLMs acting as judges specializing in outcome, excitement, and tactics. Each LLM evaluates sliding windows of commentary to identify actions like goals, cards, and substitutions, generating accurate timestamps for these events. Our experiments show that this language-centric approach performs effectively in detecting critical match events, providing a lightweight and training-free alternative to traditional video-based methods for action spotting.

### Watch and Listen: Understanding Audio-Visual-Speech Moments with   Multimodal LLM
**Authors**: Zinuo Li, Xian Zhang, Yongxin Guo, Mohammed Bennamoun, Farid Boussaid, Girish Dwivedi, Luqi Gong, Qiuhong Ke

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T16:28:03Z

**Summary**: Humans naturally understand moments in a video by integrating visual and auditory cues. For example, localizing a scene in the video like "A scientist passionately speaks on wildlife conservation as dramatic orchestral music plays, with the audience nodding and applauding" requires simultaneous processing of visual, audio, and speech signals. However, existing models often struggle to effectively fuse and interpret audio information, limiting their capacity for comprehensive video temporal understanding. To address this, we present TriSense, a triple-modality large language model designed for holistic video temporal understanding through the integration of visual, audio, and speech modalities. Central to TriSense is a Query-Based Connector that adaptively reweights modality contributions based on the input query, enabling robust performance under modality dropout and allowing flexible combinations of available inputs. To support TriSense's multimodal capabilities, we introduce TriSense-2M, a high-quality dataset of over 2 million curated samples generated via an automated pipeline powered by fine-tuned LLMs. TriSense-2M includes long-form videos and diverse modality combinations, facilitating broad generalization. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of TriSense and its potential to advance multimodal video analysis. Code and dataset will be publicly released.

### Large Language Model Unlearning for Source Code
**Authors**: Xue Jiang, Yihong Dong, Zheng Fang, Yingwei Ma, Tangxinyu Wang, Rongyu Cao, Binhua Li, Zhi Jin, Wenpin Jiao, Yongbin Li, Ge Li

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T16:27:59Z

**Summary**: LLM4SE has demonstrated significant success, but LLMs' potential memorization of sensitive or outdated training data introduces critical risks to legal compliance, software security, and code quality. LLM unlearning techniques, which can eliminate the influence of undesired data from LLMs in a post-training way, present a promising solution to address these concerns. While recent efforts in LLM unlearning show effectiveness in natural language, their applicability to source code remains underexplored. Our empirical study reveals that existing LLM unlearning approaches, when applied to source code, cause severe model utility degradation, rendering models practically unusable for code generation. In this paper, we propose PROD, a novel unlearning approach that enables LLMs to forget undesired code content while effectively preserving their code generation capabilities. PROD suppresses the probability of forget data in LLMs' output distribution while promoting candidate distributional components, enabling the model to jointly learn to forget specific content and retain its general capabilities. To facilitate this study, we establish a benchmark for code unlearning evaluation, which includes three critical downstream tasks: copyrighted code unlearning, insecure code unlearning, and deprecated API unlearning. Our evaluation demonstrates that PROD achieves superior balance between forget quality and model utility compared to existing unlearning approaches across three downstream tasks, while consistently exhibiting improvements when applied to LLMs of varying series. PROD also exhibits superior robustness against adversarial attacks without generating or exposing the data to be forgotten. The results underscore that our approach not only extends the application boundary of unlearning techniques to source code, but also holds significant implications for advancing reliable code generation.

### Watermarking Language Models through Language Models
**Authors**: Agnibh Dasgupta, Abdullah Tanvir, Xin Zhong

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T16:24:13Z

**Summary**: Watermarking the outputs of large language models (LLMs) is critical for provenance tracing, content regulation, and model accountability. Existing approaches often rely on access to model internals or are constrained by static rules and token-level perturbations. Moreover, the idea of steering generative behavior via prompt-based instruction control remains largely underexplored. We introduce a prompt-guided watermarking framework that operates entirely at the input level and requires no access to model parameters or decoding logits. The framework comprises three cooperating components: a Prompting LM that synthesizes watermarking instructions from user prompts, a Marking LM that generates watermarked outputs conditioned on these instructions, and a Detecting LM trained to classify whether a response carries an embedded watermark. This modular design enables dynamic watermarking that adapts to individual prompts while remaining compatible with diverse LLM architectures, including both proprietary and open-weight models. We evaluate the framework over 25 combinations of Prompting and Marking LMs, such as GPT-4o, Mistral, LLaMA3, and DeepSeek. Experimental results show that watermark signals generalize across architectures and remain robust under fine-tuning, model distillation, and prompt-based adversarial attacks, demonstrating the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach.

### Calibrating Pre-trained Language Classifiers on LLM-generated Noisy   Labels via Iterative Refinement
**Authors**: Liqin Ye, Agam Shah, Chao Zhang, Sudheer Chava

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T16:24:07Z

**Summary**: The traditional process of creating labeled datasets is labor-intensive and expensive. Recent breakthroughs in open-source large language models (LLMs) have opened up a new avenue in generating labeled datasets automatically for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, providing an alternative to such an expensive annotation process. However, the reliability of such auto-generated labels remains a significant concern due to inherent inaccuracies. When learning from noisy labels, the model's generalization is likely to be harmed as it is prone to overfit to those label noises. While previous studies in learning from noisy labels mainly focus on synthetic noise and real-world noise, LLM-generated label noise receives less attention. In this paper, we propose SiDyP: Simplex Label Diffusion with Dynamic Prior to calibrate the classifier's prediction, thus enhancing its robustness towards LLM-generated noisy labels. SiDyP retrieves potential true label candidates by neighborhood label distribution in text embedding space and iteratively refines noisy candidates using a simplex diffusion model. Our framework can increase the performance of the BERT classifier fine-tuned on both zero-shot and few-shot LLM-generated noisy label datasets by an average of 7.21% and 7.30% respectively. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SiDyP by conducting extensive benchmarking for different LLMs over a variety of NLP tasks. Our code is available on Github.

### When Can Model-Free Reinforcement Learning be Enough for Thinking?
**Authors**: Josiah P. Hanna, Nicholas E. Corrado

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T16:23:46Z

**Summary**: Recent work on large language models has demonstrated the use of model-free reinforcement learning (RL) to train reasoning-like capabilities. The emergence of "thinking" through model-free RL is interesting as thinking actions neither produce reward nor change the external world state to one where the agent is more likely to get reward. This paper seeks to build a domain-independent understanding of when model-free RL will lead to "thinking" as a strategy for reward maximization. To build this understanding, we first introduce a theoretical model which we call a \textit{thought Markov decision process} (MDP). Thought MDPs minimally extend the classical MDP model to include an abstract notion of thought state and thought action. Using the thought MDP model, we prove the importance of policy initialization in determining whether or not thinking emerges and show formally that thought actions are equivalent to the agent choosing to perform a step of policy improvement before continuing to act. We then show that open-source LLMs satisfy the conditions that our theory predicts are necessary for model-free RL to produce thinking-like behavior. Finally, we hypothesize sufficient conditions that would enable thinking to be learned outside of language generation and introduce a toy domain where a combination of multi-task pre-training and designated thought actions enable more data-efficient RL compared to non-thinking agents.

### Towards Advanced Mathematical Reasoning for LLMs via First-Order Logic   Theorem Proving
**Authors**: Chuxue Cao, Mengze Li, Juntao Dai, Jinluan Yang, Zijian Zhao, Shengyu Zhang, Weijie Shi, Chengzhong Liu, Sirui Han, Yike Guo

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T16:09:56Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising first-order logic (FOL) reasoning capabilities with applications in various areas. However, their effectiveness in complex mathematical reasoning involving multi-step FOL deductions is still under-researched. While LLMs perform competitively on established mathematical reasoning benchmarks, they struggle with multi-step FOL tasks, as demonstrated by Deepseek-Prover-V2-7B's low accuracy (4.2%) on our proposed theorem proving dataset. This issue arises from the limited exploration of diverse proof strategies and the potential for early reasoning mistakes to undermine entire proofs. To address these issues, we propose DREAM, a self-adaptive solution that enhances the Diversity and REAsonability of LLMs' generation strategies. DREAM incorporates an Axiom-Driven Strategy Diversification mechanism to promote varied strategic outcomes and a Sub-Proposition Error Feedback to help LLMs reflect on and correct their proofs. Our contributions include pioneering advancements in LLMs' mathematical reasoning through FOL theorem proving, introducing a novel inference stage solution that improves performance by 0.6% to 6.4%, and providing a curated dataset of 447 mathematical theorems in Lean 4 format for evaluation.

### MORIC: CSI Delay-Doppler Decomposition for Robust Wi-Fi-based Human   Activity Recognition
**Authors**: Navid Hasanzadeh, Shahrokh Valaee

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T16:05:46Z

**Summary**: The newly established IEEE 802.11bf Task Group aims to amend the WLAN standard to support advanced sensing applications such as human activity recognition (HAR). Although studies have demonstrated the potential of sub-7 GHz Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI) for HAR, no method currently performs reliably in real-world scenarios. This work tackles the poor generalization of Wi-Fi-based HAR by introducing an innovative approach to extracting and utilizing movement-related representations, which makes it robust to noise and static environmental properties. This is achieved by transforming CSI signals into the delay profile space and decomposing them into various Doppler velocities, which serve as informative projections of a mobile point's velocity from different unknown random angles. To mitigate the impact of this randomness, MORIC is introduced as a novel time series classification model based on random convolutional kernels, designed to be invariant to the random order and repetition of input representations, thereby enabling robust Wi-Fi CSI-based activity classification. Experimental results on the collected dataset demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of generalization accuracy for hand motion recognition, particularly for challenging gestures. Furthermore, incorporating a small number of calibration samples leads to a significant improvement in accuracy, enhancing the practicality of the method for real-world deployment.

### Better Language Model Inversion by Compactly Representing Next-Token   Distributions
**Authors**: Murtaza Nazir, Matthew Finlayson, John X. Morris, Xiang Ren, Swabha Swayamdipta

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T15:53:51Z

**Summary**: Language model inversion seeks to recover hidden prompts using only language model outputs. This capability has implications for security and accountability in language model deployments, such as leaking private information from an API-protected language model's system message. We propose a new method -- prompt inversion from logprob sequences (PILS) -- that recovers hidden prompts by gleaning clues from the model's next-token probabilities over the course of multiple generation steps. Our method is enabled by a key insight: The vector-valued outputs of a language model occupy a low-dimensional subspace. This enables us to losslessly compress the full next-token probability distribution over multiple generation steps using a linear map, allowing more output information to be used for inversion. Our approach yields massive gains over previous state-of-the-art methods for recovering hidden prompts, achieving 2--3.5 times higher exact recovery rates across test sets, in one case increasing the recovery rate from 17% to 60%. Our method also exhibits surprisingly good generalization behavior; for instance, an inverter trained on 16 generations steps gets 5--27 points higher prompt recovery when we increase the number of steps to 32 at test time. Furthermore, we demonstrate strong performance of our method on the more challenging task of recovering hidden system messages. We also analyze the role of verbatim repetition in prompt recovery and propose a new method for cross-family model transfer for logit-based inverters. Our findings show that next-token probabilities are a considerably more vulnerable attack surface for inversion attacks than previously known.

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed across disciplines due to their advanced reasoning and problem solving capabilities. To measure their effectiveness, various benchmarks have been developed that measure aspects of LLM reasoning, comprehension, and problem-solving. While several surveys address LLM evaluation and benchmarks, a domain-specific analysis remains underexplored in the literature. This paper introduces a taxonomy of seven key disciplines, encompassing various domains and application areas where LLMs are extensively utilized. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive review of LLM benchmarks and survey papers within each domain, highlighting the unique capabilities of LLMs and the challenges faced in their application. Finally, we compile and categorize these benchmarks by domain to create an accessible resource for researchers, aiming to pave the way for advancements toward artificial general intelligence (AGI)

### Chain-of-Thought Prompting Obscures Hallucination Cues in Large Language   Models: An Empirical Evaluation
**Authors**: Jiahao Cheng, Tiancheng Su, Jia Yuan, Guoxiu He, Jiawei Liu, Xinqi Tao, Jingwen Xie, Huaxia Li

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T15:49:37Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit \textit{hallucinations}, generating factually incorrect or semantically irrelevant content in response to prompts. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting can mitigate hallucinations by encouraging step-by-step reasoning, but its impact on hallucination detection remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we conduct a systematic empirical evaluation. We begin with a pilot experiment, revealing that CoT reasoning significantly affects the LLM's internal states and token probability distributions. Building on this, we evaluate the impact of various CoT prompting methods on mainstream hallucination detection methods across both instruction-tuned and reasoning-oriented LLMs. Specifically, we examine three key dimensions: changes in hallucination score distributions, variations in detection accuracy, and shifts in detection confidence. Our findings show that while CoT prompting helps reduce hallucination frequency, it also tends to obscure critical signals used for detection, impairing the effectiveness of various detection methods. Our study highlights an overlooked trade-off in the use of reasoning. Code is publicly available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/cot-hallu-detect.

### ScholarSearch: Benchmarking Scholar Searching Ability of LLMs
**Authors**: Junting Zhou, Wang Li, Yiyan Liao, Nengyuan Zhang, Tingjia Miao, Zhihui Qi, Yuhan Wu, Tong Yang

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T15:48:51Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs)' search capabilities have garnered significant attention. Existing benchmarks, such as OpenAI's BrowseComp, primarily focus on general search scenarios and fail to adequately address the specific demands of academic search. These demands include deeper literature tracing and organization, professional support for academic databases, the ability to navigate long-tail academic knowledge, and ensuring academic rigor. Here, we proposed ScholarSearch, the first dataset specifically designed to evaluate the complex information retrieval capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in academic research. ScholarSearch possesses the following key characteristics: Academic Practicality, where question content closely mirrors real academic learning and research environments, avoiding deliberately misleading models; High Difficulty, with answers that are challenging for single models (e.g., Grok DeepSearch or Gemini Deep Research) to provide directly, often requiring at least three deep searches to derive; Concise Evaluation, where limiting conditions ensure answers are as unique as possible, accompanied by clear sources and brief solution explanations, greatly facilitating subsequent audit and verification, surpassing the current lack of analyzed search datasets both domestically and internationally; and Broad Coverage, as the dataset spans at least 15 different academic disciplines. Through ScholarSearch, we expect to more precisely measure and promote the performance improvement of LLMs in complex academic information retrieval tasks. The data is available at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/PKU-DS-LAB/ScholarSearch

**Authors**: Veronica Vannini, William Dubois, Olivier Gamache, Jean-Michel Fortin, Nicolas Samson, Effie Daum, François Pomerleau, Edith Brotherton

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T15:42:53Z

**Summary**: Deploying robotic missions can be challenging due to the complexity of controlling robots with multiple degrees of freedom, fusing diverse sensory inputs, and managing communication delays and interferences. In nuclear inspection, robots can be crucial in assessing environments where human presence is limited, requiring precise teleoperation and coordination. Teleoperation requires extensive training, as operators must process multiple outputs while ensuring safe interaction with critical assets. These challenges are amplified when operating a fleet of heterogeneous robots across multiple environments, as each robot may have distinct control interfaces, sensory systems, and operational constraints. Efficient coordination in such settings remains an open problem. This paper presents a field report on how we integrated robot fleet capabilities - including mapping, localization, and telecommunication - toward a joint mission. We simulated a nuclear inspection scenario for exposed areas, using lights to represent a radiation source. We deployed two Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) tasked with mapping indoor and outdoor environments while remotely controlled from a single base station. Despite having distinct operational goals, the robots produced a unified map output, demonstrating the feasibility of coordinated multi-robot missions. Our results highlight key operational challenges and provide insights into improving adaptability and situational awareness in remote robotic deployments.

### Tower+: Bridging Generality and Translation Specialization in   Multilingual LLMs
**Authors**: Ricardo Rei, Nuno M. Guerreiro, José Pombal, João Alves, Pedro Teixeirinha, Amin Farajian, André F. T. Martins

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T15:30:06Z

**Summary**: Fine-tuning pretrained LLMs has been shown to be an effective strategy for reaching state-of-the-art performance on specific tasks like machine translation. However, this process of adaptation often implies sacrificing general-purpose capabilities, such as conversational reasoning and instruction-following, hampering the utility of the system in real-world applications that require a mixture of skills. In this paper, we introduce Tower+, a suite of models designed to deliver strong performance across both translation and multilingual general-purpose text capabilities. We achieve a Pareto frontier between translation specialization and multilingual general-purpose capabilities by introducing a novel training recipe that builds on Tower (Alves et al., 2024), comprising continued pretraining, supervised fine-tuning, preference optimization, and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards. At each stage of training, we carefully generate and curate data to strengthen performance on translation as well as general-purpose tasks involving code generation, mathematics problem solving, and general instruction-following. We develop models at multiple scales: 2B, 9B, and 72B. Our smaller models often outperform larger general-purpose open-weight and proprietary LLMs (e.g., Llama 3.3 70B, GPT-4o). Our largest model delivers best-in-class translation performance for high-resource languages and top results in multilingual Arena Hard evaluations and in IF-MT, a benchmark we introduce for evaluating both translation and instruction-following. Our findings highlight that it is possible to rival frontier models in general capabilities, while optimizing for specific business domains, such as translation and localization.

### Simultaneous Translation with Offline Speech and LLM Models in CUNI   Submission to IWSLT 2025
**Authors**: Dominik Macháček, Peter Polák

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T15:27:44Z

**Summary**: This paper describes Charles University submission to the Simultaneous Speech Translation Task of the IWSLT 2025. We cover all four language pairs with a direct or cascade approach. The backbone of our systems is the offline Whisper speech model, which we use for both translation and transcription in simultaneous mode with the state-of-the-art simultaneous policy AlignAtt. We further improve the performance by prompting to inject in-domain terminology, and we accommodate context. Our cascaded systems further use EuroLLM for unbounded simultaneous translation. Compared to the Organizers' baseline, our systems improve by 2 BLEU points on Czech to English and 13-22 BLEU points on English to German, Chinese and Japanese on the development sets. Additionally, we also propose a new enhanced measure of speech recognition latency.

### LLM-Based Bot Broadens the Range of Arguments in Online Discussions,   Even When Transparently Disclosed as AI
**Authors**: Valeria Vuk, Cristina Sarasua, Fabrizio Gilardi

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T15:24:31Z

**Summary**: A wide range of participation is essential for democracy, as it helps prevent the dominance of extreme views, erosion of legitimacy, and political polarization. However, engagement in online political discussions often features a limited spectrum of views due to high levels of self-selection and the tendency of online platforms to facilitate exchanges primarily among like-minded individuals. This study examines whether an LLM-based bot can widen the scope of perspectives expressed by participants in online discussions through two pre-registered randomized experiments conducted in a chatroom. We evaluate the impact of a bot that actively monitors discussions, identifies missing arguments, and introduces them into the conversation. The results indicate that our bot significantly expands the range of arguments, as measured by both objective and subjective metrics. Furthermore, disclosure of the bot as AI does not significantly alter these effects. These findings suggest that LLM-based moderation tools can positively influence online political discourse.

### Al-Khwarizmi: Discovering Physical Laws with Foundation Models
**Authors**: Christopher E. Mower, Haitham Bou-Ammar

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T15:22:21Z

**Summary**: Inferring physical laws from data is a central challenge in science and engineering, including but not limited to healthcare, physical sciences, biosciences, social sciences, sustainability, climate, and robotics. Deep networks offer high-accuracy results but lack interpretability, prompting interest in models built from simple components. The Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) method has become the go-to approach for building such modular and interpretable models. SINDy leverages sparse regression with L1 regularization to identify key terms from a library of candidate functions. However, SINDy's choice of candidate library and optimization method requires significant technical expertise, limiting its widespread applicability. This work introduces Al-Khwarizmi, a novel agentic framework for physical law discovery from data, which integrates foundational models with SINDy. Leveraging LLMs, VLMs, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), our approach automates physical law discovery, incorporating prior knowledge and iteratively refining candidate solutions via reflection. Al-Khwarizmi operates in two steps: it summarizes system observations-comprising textual descriptions, raw data, and plots-followed by a secondary step that generates candidate feature libraries and optimizer configurations to identify hidden physics laws correctly. Evaluating our algorithm on over 198 models, we demonstrate state-of-the-art performance compared to alternatives, reaching a 20 percent increase against the best-performing alternative.

### Empowering Near-Field Communications in Low-Altitude Economy with LLM:   Fundamentals, Potentials, Solutions, and Future Directions
**Authors**: Zhuo Xu, Tianyue Zheng, Linglong Dai

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T15:14:29Z

**Summary**: The low-altitude economy (LAE) is gaining significant attention from academia and industry. Fortunately, LAE naturally aligns with near-field communications in extremely large-scale MIMO (XL-MIMO) systems. By leveraging near-field beamfocusing, LAE can precisely direct beam energy to unmanned aerial vehicles, while the additional distance dimension boosts overall spectrum efficiency. However, near-field communications in LAE still face several challenges, such as the increase in signal processing complexity and the necessity of distinguishing between far and near-field users. Inspired by the large language models (LLM) with powerful ability to handle complex problems, we apply LLM to solve challenges of near-field communications in LAE. The objective of this article is to provide a comprehensive analysis and discussion on LLM-empowered near-field communications in LAE. Specifically, we first introduce fundamentals of LLM and near-field communications, including the key advantages of LLM and key characteristics of near-field communications. Then, we reveal the opportunities and challenges of near-field communications in LAE. To address these challenges, we present a LLM-based scheme for near-field communications in LAE, and provide a case study which jointly distinguishes far and near-field users and designs multi-user precoding matrix. Finally, we outline and highlight several future research directions and open issues.

### Client Selection Strategies for Federated Semantic Communications in   Heterogeneous IoT Networks
**Authors**: Samer Lahoud, Kinda Khawam

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T15:11:20Z

**Summary**: The exponential growth of IoT devices presents critical challenges in bandwidth-constrained wireless networks, particularly regarding efficient data transmission and privacy preservation. This paper presents a novel federated semantic communication (SC) framework that enables collaborative training of bandwidth-efficient models for image reconstruction across heterogeneous IoT devices. By leveraging SC principles to transmit only semantic features, our approach dramatically reduces communication overhead while preserving reconstruction quality. We address the fundamental challenge of client selection in federated learning environments where devices exhibit significant disparities in dataset sizes and data distributions. Our framework implements three distinct client selection strategies that explore different trade-offs between system performance and fairness in resource allocation. The system employs an end-to-end SC architecture with semantic bottlenecks, coupled with a loss-based aggregation mechanism that naturally adapts to client heterogeneity. Experimental evaluation on image data demonstrates that while Utilitarian selection achieves the highest reconstruction quality, Proportional Fairness maintains competitive performance while significantly reducing participation inequality and improving computational efficiency. These results establish that federated SC can successfully balance reconstruction quality, resource efficiency, and fairness in heterogeneous IoT deployments, paving the way for sustainable and privacy-preserving edge intelligence applications.

### From Concepts to Components: Concept-Agnostic Attention Module Discovery   in Transformers
**Authors**: Jingtong Su, Julia Kempe, Karen Ullrich

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T15:04:11Z

**Summary**: Transformers have achieved state-of-the-art performance across language and vision tasks. This success drives the imperative to interpret their internal mechanisms with the dual goals of enhancing performance and improving behavioral control. Attribution methods help advance interpretability by assigning model outputs associated with a target concept to specific model components. Current attribution research primarily studies multi-layer perceptron neurons and addresses relatively simple concepts such as factual associations (e.g., Paris is located in France). This focus tends to overlook the impact of the attention mechanism and lacks a unified approach for analyzing more complex concepts. To fill these gaps, we introduce Scalable Attention Module Discovery (SAMD), a concept-agnostic method for mapping arbitrary, complex concepts to specific attention heads of general transformer models. We accomplish this by representing each concept as a vector, calculating its cosine similarity with each attention head, and selecting the TopK-scoring heads to construct the concept-associated attention module. We then propose Scalar Attention Module Intervention (SAMI), a simple strategy to diminish or amplify the effects of a concept by adjusting the attention module using only a single scalar parameter. Empirically, we demonstrate SAMD on concepts of varying complexity, and visualize the locations of their corresponding modules. Our results demonstrate that module locations remain stable before and after LLM post-training, and confirm prior work on the mechanics of LLM multilingualism. Through SAMI, we facilitate jailbreaking on HarmBench (+72.7%) by diminishing "safety" and improve performance on the GSM8K benchmark (+1.6%) by amplifying "reasoning". Lastly, we highlight the domain-agnostic nature of our approach by suppressing the image classification accuracy of vision transformers on ImageNet.

### Geopolitical biases in LLMs: what are the "good" and the "bad" countries   according to contemporary language models
**Authors**: Mikhail Salnikov, Dmitrii Korzh, Ivan Lazichny, Elvir Karimov, Artyom Iudin, Ivan Oseledets, Oleg Y. Rogov, Natalia Loukachevitch, Alexander Panchenko, Elena Tutubalina

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T15:03:21Z

**Summary**: This paper evaluates geopolitical biases in LLMs with respect to various countries though an analysis of their interpretation of historical events with conflicting national perspectives (USA, UK, USSR, and China). We introduce a novel dataset with neutral event descriptions and contrasting viewpoints from different countries. Our findings show significant geopolitical biases, with models favoring specific national narratives. Additionally, simple debiasing prompts had a limited effect in reducing these biases. Experiments with manipulated participant labels reveal models' sensitivity to attribution, sometimes amplifying biases or recognizing inconsistencies, especially with swapped labels. This work highlights national narrative biases in LLMs, challenges the effectiveness of simple debiasing methods, and offers a framework and dataset for future geopolitical bias research.

### How Breakable Is Privacy: Probing and Resisting Model Inversion Attacks   in Collaborative Inference
**Authors**: Rongke Liu, Youwen Zhu, Dong Wang, Gaoning Pan, Xingyu He, Weizhi Meng

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T14:59:56Z

**Summary**: Collaborative inference (CI) improves computational efficiency for edge devices by transmitting intermediate features to cloud models. However, this process inevitably exposes feature representations to model inversion attacks (MIAs), enabling unauthorized data reconstruction. Despite extensive research, there is no established criterion for assessing the difficulty of MIA implementation, leaving a fundamental question unanswered: \textit{What factors truly and verifiably determine the attack's success in CI?} Moreover, existing defenses lack the theoretical foundation described above, making it challenging to regulate feature information effectively while ensuring privacy and minimizing computational overhead. These shortcomings introduce three key challenges: theoretical gap, methodological limitation, and practical constraint.   To overcome these challenges, we propose the first theoretical criterion to assess MIA difficulty in CI, identifying mutual information, entropy, and effective information volume as key influencing factors. The validity of this criterion is demonstrated by using the mutual information neural estimator. Building on this insight, we propose SiftFunnel, a privacy-preserving framework to resist MIA while maintaining usability. Specifically, we incorporate linear and non-linear correlation constraints alongside label smoothing to suppress redundant information transmission, effectively balancing privacy and usability. To enhance deployability, the edge model adopts a funnel-shaped structure with attention mechanisms, strengthening privacy while reducing computational and storage burdens. Experiments show that, compared to state-of-the-art defense, SiftFunnel increases reconstruction error by $\sim$30\%, lowers mutual and effective information metrics by $\geq$50\%, and reduces edge burdens by almost $20\times$, while maintaining comparable usability.

### COS-DPO: Conditioned One-Shot Multi-Objective Fine-Tuning Framework
**Authors**: Yinuo Ren, Tesi Xiao, Michael Shavlovsky, Lexing Ying, Holakou Rahmanian

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T14:52:02Z

**Summary**: In LLM alignment and many other ML applications, one often faces the Multi-Objective Fine-Tuning (MOFT) problem, i.e., fine-tuning an existing model with datasets labeled w.r.t. different objectives simultaneously. To address the challenge, we propose a Conditioned One-Shot fine-tuning framework (COS-DPO) that extends the Direct Preference Optimization technique, originally developed for efficient LLM alignment with preference data, to accommodate the MOFT settings. By direct conditioning on the weight across auxiliary objectives, our Weight-COS-DPO method enjoys an efficient one-shot training process for profiling the Pareto front and is capable of achieving comprehensive trade-off solutions even in the post-training stage. Based on our theoretical findings on the linear transformation properties of the loss function, we further propose the Temperature-COS-DPO method that augments the temperature parameter to the model input, enhancing the flexibility of post-training control over the trade-offs between the main and auxiliary objectives. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the COS-DPO framework through its applications to various tasks, including the Learning-to-Rank (LTR) and LLM alignment tasks, highlighting its viability for large-scale ML deployments.

### Incivility and Rigidity: The Risks of Fine-Tuning LLMs for Political   Argumentation
**Authors**: Svetlana Churina, Kokil Jaidka

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T14:35:51Z

**Summary**: The incivility prevalent on platforms like Twitter (now X) and Reddit poses a challenge for developing AI systems that can support productive and rhetorically sound political argumentation. In this study, we report experiments with GPT-3.5 Turbo, fine-tuned on two contrasting datasets of political discussions: high-variance, high-incivility Twitter replies to U.S. Congress, and low-variance, low-incivility posts from Reddit's r/ChangeMyView. We systematically evaluate how these data sources and prompting strategies shape the rhetorical framing and deliberative quality of model-generated arguments. Our results show that Reddit-finetuned models produce safer but rhetorically rigid arguments, while cross-platform fine-tuning amplifies toxicity. Prompting reduces specific toxic behaviors, such as personal attacks, but fails to fully mitigate the influence of high-incivility training data. We introduce and validate a rhetorical evaluation rubric and provide practical guidelines for deploying LLMs in content authoring, moderation, and deliberation support.

### ReplaceMe: Network Simplification via Depth Pruning and Transformer   Block Linearization
**Authors**: Dmitriy Shopkhoev, Ammar Ali, Magauiya Zhussip, Valentin Malykh, Stamatios Lefkimmiatis, Nikos Komodakis, Sergey Zagoruyko

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T14:27:20Z

**Summary**: We introduce ReplaceMe, a generalized training-free depth pruning method that effectively replaces transformer blocks with a linear operation, while maintaining high performance for low compression ratios. In contrast to conventional pruning approaches that require additional training or fine-tuning, our approach requires only a small calibration dataset that is used to estimate a linear transformation, which approximates the pruned blocks. The estimated linear mapping can be seamlessly merged with the remaining transformer blocks, eliminating the need for any additional network parameters. Our experiments show that ReplaceMe consistently outperforms other training-free approaches and remains highly competitive with state-of-the-art pruning methods that involve extensive retraining/fine-tuning and architectural modifications. Applied to several large language models (LLMs), ReplaceMe achieves up to 25% pruning while retaining approximately 90% of the original model's performance on open benchmarks - without any training or healing steps, resulting in minimal computational overhead (see Fig.1). We provide an open-source library implementing ReplaceMe alongside several state-of-the-art depth pruning techniques, available at https://github.com/mts-ai/ReplaceMe.

### Scalable and Reliable Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning for Traffic   Assignment
**Authors**: Leizhen Wang, Peibo Duan, Cheng Lyu, Zewen Wang, Zhiqiang He, Nan Zheng, Zhenliang Ma

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T14:25:23Z

**Summary**: The evolution of metropolitan cities and the increase in travel demands impose stringent requirements on traffic assignment methods. Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approaches outperform traditional methods in modeling adaptive routing behavior without requiring explicit system dynamics, which is beneficial for real-world deployment. However, MARL frameworks face challenges in scalability and reliability when managing extensive networks with substantial travel demand, which limiting their practical applicability in solving large-scale traffic assignment problems. To address these challenges, this study introduces MARL-OD-DA, a new MARL framework for the traffic assignment problem, which redefines agents as origin-destination (OD) pair routers rather than individual travelers, significantly enhancing scalability. Additionally, a Dirichlet-based action space with action pruning and a reward function based on the local relative gap are designed to enhance solution reliability and improve convergence efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed MARL framework effectively handles medium-sized networks with extensive and varied city-level OD demand, surpassing existing MARL methods. When implemented in the SiouxFalls network, MARL-OD-DA achieves better assignment solutions in 10 steps, with a relative gap that is 94.99% lower than that of conventional methods.

### Can Large Language Models Replace Human Subjects? A Large-Scale   Replication of Scenario-Based Experiments in Psychology and Management
**Authors**: Ziyan Cui, Ning Li, Huaikang Zhou

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T14:13:17Z

**Summary**: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly being integrated into scientific research, particularly in the social sciences, where understanding human behavior is critical. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in replicating human-like responses in various psychological experiments. We conducted a large-scale study replicating 156 psychological experiments from top social science journals using three state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-4, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and DeepSeek v3). Our results reveal that while LLMs demonstrate high replication rates for main effects (73-81%) and moderate to strong success with interaction effects (46-63%), They consistently produce larger effect sizes than human studies, with Fisher Z values approximately 2-3 times higher than human studies. Notably, LLMs show significantly lower replication rates for studies involving socially sensitive topics such as race, gender and ethics. When original studies reported null findings, LLMs produced significant results at remarkably high rates (68-83%) - while this could reflect cleaner data with less noise, as evidenced by narrower confidence intervals, it also suggests potential risks of effect size overestimation. Our results demonstrate both the promise and challenges of LLMs in psychological research, offering efficient tools for pilot testing and rapid hypothesis validation while enriching rather than replacing traditional human subject studies, yet requiring more nuanced interpretation and human validation for complex social phenomena and culturally sensitive research questions.

### LLM-Generated Feedback Supports Learning If Learners Choose to Use It
**Authors**: Danielle R. Thomas, Conrad Borchers, Shambhavi Bhushan, Erin Gatz, Shivang Gupta, Kenneth R. Koedinger

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T13:59:14Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate feedback, yet their impact on learning remains underexplored, especially compared to existing feedback methods. This study investigates how on-demand LLM-generated explanatory feedback influences learning in seven scenario-based tutor training lessons. Analyzing over 2,600 lesson completions from 885 tutor learners, we compare posttest performance among learners across three groups: learners who received feedback generated by gpt-3.5-turbo, those who declined it, and those without access. All groups received non-LLM corrective feedback. To address potential selection bias-where higher-performing learners may be more inclined to use LLM feedback-we applied propensity scoring. Learners with a higher predicted likelihood of engaging with LLM feedback scored significantly higher at posttest than those with lower propensity. After adjusting for this effect, two out of seven lessons showed statistically significant learning benefits from LLM feedback with standardized effect sizes of 0.28 and 0.33. These moderate effects suggest that the effectiveness of LLM feedback depends on the learners' tendency to seek support. Importantly, LLM feedback did not significantly increase completion time, and learners overwhelmingly rated it as helpful. These findings highlight LLM feedback's potential as a low-cost and scalable way to improve learning on open-ended tasks, particularly in existing systems already providing feedback without LLMs. This work contributes open datasets, LLM prompts, and rubrics to support reproducibility.

### PersonalAI: Towards digital twins in the graph form
**Authors**: Mikhail Menschikov, Dmitry Evseev, Ruslan Kostoev, Ilya Perepechkin, Ilnaz Salimov, Victoria Dochkina, Petr Anokhin, Evgeny Burnaev, Nikita Semenov

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T13:52:15Z

**Summary**: The challenge of personalizing language models, specifically the ability to account for a user's history during interactions, is of significant interest. Despite recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) and Retrieval Augmented Generation that have enhanced the factual base of LLMs, the task of retaining extensive personal information and using it to generate personalized responses remains pertinent. To address this, we propose utilizing external memory in the form of knowledge graphs, which are constructed and updated by the LLM itself. We have expanded upon ideas of AriGraph architecture and for the first time introduced a combined graph featuring both standard edges and two types of hyperedges. Experiments conducted on the TriviaQA, HotpotQA and DiaASQ benchmarks indicates that this approach aids in making the process of graph construction and knowledge extraction unified and robust. Furthermore, we augmented the DiaASQ benchmark by incorporating parameters such as time into dialogues and introducing contradictory statements made by the same speaker at different times. Despite these modifications, the performance of the question-answering system remained robust, demonstrating the proposed architecture's ability to maintain and utilize temporal dependencies.

### Think&Cite: Improving Attributed Text Generation with Self-Guided Tree   Search and Progress Reward Modeling
**Authors**: Junyi Li, Hwee Tou Ng

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T13:47:25Z

**Summary**: Despite their outstanding capabilities, large language models (LLMs) are prone to hallucination and producing factually incorrect information. This challenge has spurred efforts in attributed text generation, which prompts LLMs to generate content with supporting evidence. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, called Think&Cite, and formulate attributed text generation as a multi-step reasoning problem integrated with search. Specifically, we propose Self-Guided Monte Carlo Tree Search (SG-MCTS), which capitalizes on the self-reflection capability of LLMs to reason about the intermediate states of MCTS for guiding the tree expansion process. To provide reliable and comprehensive feedback, we introduce Progress Reward Modeling to measure the progress of tree search from the root to the current state from two aspects, i.e., generation and attribution progress. We conduct extensive experiments on three datasets and the results show that our approach significantly outperforms baseline approaches.

### TeXpert: A Multi-Level Benchmark for Evaluating LaTeX Code Generation by   LLMs
**Authors**: Sahil Kale, Vijaykant Nadadur

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T13:39:16Z

**Summary**: LaTeX's precision and flexibility in typesetting have made it the gold standard for the preparation of scientific documentation. Large Language Models (LLMs) present a promising opportunity for researchers to produce publication-ready material using LaTeX with natural language instructions, yet current benchmarks completely lack evaluation of this ability. By introducing TeXpert, our benchmark dataset with natural language prompts for generating LaTeX code focused on components of scientific documents across multiple difficulty levels, we conduct an in-depth analysis of LLM performance in this regard and identify frequent error types. Our evaluation across open and closed-source LLMs highlights multiple key findings: LLMs excelling on standard benchmarks perform poorly in LaTeX generation with a significant accuracy drop-off as the complexity of tasks increases; open-source models like DeepSeek v3 and DeepSeek Coder strongly rival closed-source counterparts in LaTeX tasks; and formatting and package errors are unexpectedly prevalent, suggesting a lack of diverse LaTeX examples in the training datasets of most LLMs. Our dataset, code, and model evaluations are available at https://github.com/knowledge-verse-ai/TeXpert.

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T13:34:13Z

**Summary**: The increasing demand for generative AI as Large Language Models (LLMs) services has driven the need for specialized hardware architectures that optimize computational efficiency and energy consumption. This paper evaluates the performance of the Tenstorrent Grayskull e75 RISC-V accelerator for basic linear algebra kernels at reduced numerical precision, a fundamental operation in LLM computations. We present a detailed characterization of Grayskull's execution model, gridsize, matrix dimensions, data formats, and numerical precision impact computational efficiency. Furthermore, we compare Grayskull's performance against state-of-the-art architectures with tensor acceleration, including Intel Sapphire Rapids processors and two NVIDIA GPUs (V100 and A100). Whilst NVIDIA GPUs dominate raw performance, Grayskull demonstrates a competitive trade-off between power consumption and computational throughput, reaching a peak of 1.55 TFLOPs/Watt with BF16.

### Knapsack Optimization-based Schema Linking for LLM-based Text-to-SQL   Generation
**Authors**: Zheng Yuan, Hao Chen, Zijin Hong, Qinggang Zhang, Feiran Huang, Qing Li, Xiao Huang

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T13:24:05Z

**Summary**: Generating SQLs from user queries is a long-standing challenge, where the accuracy of initial schema linking significantly impacts subsequent SQL generation performance. However, current schema linking models still struggle with missing relevant schema elements or an excess of redundant ones. A crucial reason for this is that commonly used metrics, recall and precision, fail to capture relevant element missing and thus cannot reflect actual schema linking performance. Motivated by this, we propose enhanced schema linking metrics by introducing a restricted missing indicator. Accordingly, we introduce Knapsack optimization-based Schema Linking Approach (KaSLA), a plug-in schema linking method designed to prevent the missing of relevant schema elements while minimizing the inclusion of redundant ones. KaSLA employs a hierarchical linking strategy that first identifies the optimal table linking and subsequently links columns within the selected table to reduce linking candidate space. In each linking process, it utilizes a knapsack optimization approach to link potentially relevant elements while accounting for a limited tolerance of potentially redundant ones. With this optimization, KaSLA-1.6B achieves superior schema linking results compared to large-scale LLMs, including deepseek-v3 with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) schema linking method. Extensive experiments on Spider and BIRD benchmarks verify that KaSLA can significantly improve the SQL generation performance of SOTA Text2SQL models by substituting their schema linking processes.

### Language Bottleneck Models: A Framework for Interpretable Knowledge   Tracing and Beyond
**Authors**: Antonin Berthon, Mihaela van der Schaar

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T13:21:14Z

**Summary**: Accurately assessing student knowledge is critical for effective education, yet traditional Knowledge Tracing (KT) methods rely on opaque latent embeddings, limiting interpretability. Even LLM-based approaches generate direct predictions or summaries that may hallucinate without any accuracy guarantees. We recast KT as an inverse problem: learning the minimum natural-language summary that makes past answers explainable and future answers predictable. Our Language Bottleneck Model (LBM) consists of an encoder LLM that writes an interpretable knowledge summary and a frozen decoder LLM that must reconstruct and predict student responses using only that summary text. By constraining all predictive information to pass through a short natural-language bottleneck, LBMs ensure that the summary contains accurate information while remaining human-interpretable. Experiments on synthetic arithmetic benchmarks and the large-scale Eedi dataset show that LBMs rival the accuracy of state-of-the-art KT and direct LLM methods while requiring orders-of-magnitude fewer student trajectories. We demonstrate that training the encoder with group-relative policy optimization, using downstream decoding accuracy as a reward signal, effectively improves summary quality.

### Latent Concept Disentanglement in Transformer-based Language Models
**Authors**: Guan Zhe Hong, Bhavya Vasudeva, Vatsal Sharan, Cyrus Rashtchian, Prabhakar Raghavan, Rina Panigrahy

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T13:08:12Z

**Summary**: When large language models (LLMs) use in-context learning (ICL) to solve a new task, they seem to grasp not only the goal of the task but also core, latent concepts in the demonstration examples. This begs the question of whether transformers represent latent structures as part of their computation or whether they take shortcuts to solve the problem. Prior mechanistic work on ICL does not address this question because it does not sufficiently examine the relationship between the learned representation and the latent concept, and the considered problem settings often involve only single-step reasoning. In this work, we examine how transformers disentangle and use latent concepts. We show that in 2-hop reasoning tasks with a latent, discrete concept, the model successfully identifies the latent concept and does step-by-step concept composition. In tasks parameterized by a continuous latent concept, we find low-dimensional subspaces in the representation space where the geometry mimics the underlying parameterization. Together, these results refine our understanding of ICL and the representation of transformers, and they provide evidence for highly localized structures in the model that disentangle latent concepts in ICL tasks.

### LogProber: Disentangling confidence from contamination in LLM responses
**Authors**: Nicolas Yax, Pierre-Yves Oudeyer, Stefano Palminteri

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T12:52:37Z

**Summary**: In machine learning, contamination refers to situations where testing data leak into the training set. The issue is particularly relevant for the evaluation of the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs), which are generally trained on gargantuan, and generally opaque, corpora of text scraped from the world wide web. Developing tools to detect contamination is therefore crucial to be able to fairly and properly track the evolution of the performance of LLMs. To date, only a few recent studies have attempted to address the issue of quantifying and detecting contamination in short text sequences, such as those commonly found in benchmarks. However, these methods have limitations that can sometimes render them impractical. In the present paper, we introduce LogProber, a novel, efficient algorithm that we show to be able to detect contamination in a black box setting that tries to tackle some of these drawbacks by focusing on the familiarity with the question rather than the answer. Here, we explore the properties of the proposed method in comparison with concurrent approaches, identify its advantages and limitations, and illustrate how different forms of contamination can go undetected depending on the design of the detection algorithm.

### SafeGenBench: A Benchmark Framework for Security Vulnerability Detection   in LLM-Generated Code
**Authors**: Xinghang Li, Jingzhe Ding, Chao Peng, Bing Zhao, Xiang Gao, Hongwan Gao, Xinchen Gu

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T12:42:57Z

**Summary**: The code generation capabilities of large language models(LLMs) have emerged as a critical dimension in evaluating their overall performance. However, prior research has largely overlooked the security risks inherent in the generated code. In this work, we introduce SafeGenBench, a benchmark specifically designed to assess the security of LLM-generated code. The dataset encompasses a wide range of common software development scenarios and vulnerability types. Building upon this benchmark, we develop an automatic evaluation framework that leverages both static application security testing(SAST) and LLM-based judging to assess the presence of security vulnerabilities in model-generated code. Through the empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs on SafeGenBench, we reveal notable deficiencies in their ability to produce vulnerability-free code. Our findings highlight pressing challenges and offer actionable insights for future advancements in the secure code generation performance of LLMs. The data and code will be released soon.

### Adversarial Reasoning for Repair Based on Inferred Program Intent
**Authors**: He Ye, Aidan Z. H. Yang, Chang Hu, Yanlin Wang, Tao Zhang, Claire Le Goues

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T12:30:23Z

**Summary**: Automated program repair (APR) has shown promising results, particularly with the use of neural networks. Currently, most APR tools focus on code transformations specified by test suites, rather than reasoning about the program intent and the high-level bug specification. Without a proper understanding of program intent, these tools tend to generate patches that overfit incomplete test suites and fail to reflect the developers intentions. However, reasoning about program intent is challenging. In our work, we propose an approach called AdverIntent-Agent, based on critique and adversarial reasoning. Our approach is novel to shift the focus from generating multiple APR patches to inferring multiple potential program intents. Ideally, we aim to infer intents that are, to some extent, adversarial to each other, maximizing the probability that at least one aligns closely with the developers original intent. AdverIntent-Agent is a multi-agent approach consisting of three agents: a reasoning agent, a test agent, and a repair agent. First, the reasoning agent generates adversarial program intents along with the corresponding faulty statements. Next, the test agent produces adversarial test cases that align with each inferred intent, constructing oracles that use the same inputs but have different expected outputs. Finally, the repair agent uses dynamic and precise LLM prompts to generate patches that satisfy both the inferred program intent and the generated tests. AdverIntent-Agent was evaluated on two benchmarks: Defects4J 2.0 and HumanEval-Java. AdverIntent-Agent correctly repaired 77 and 105 bugs in both benchmarks, respectively.

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T12:19:48Z

**Summary**: Optical clock networks connected by phase-coherent links offer significant potential for advancing fundamental research and diverse scientific applications. Free-space optical frequency transfer extends fiber-based connectivity to remote areas and holds the potential for global coverage via satellite links. Here we present a compact and robust portable, rack-integrated two-way free-space link characterization system. Equipped with plug-and-play capabilities, the system enables straightforward interfacing with various optical systems and facilitates quick deployment for field experiments. In this work, we achieve a fractional frequency instability of $2.0 \times 10^{-19}$ for an averaging time of 10 s over a 3.4 km horizontal fully folded intra-city free-space link. Moreover, the system maintains an uptime of $94\%$ over 15 hours, illustrating its reliability and effectiveness for high-precision optical frequency comparisons over free-space.

### Calibrated Predictive Lower Bounds on Time-to-Unsafe-Sampling in LLMs
**Authors**: Hen Davidov, Gilad Freidkin, Shai Feldman, Yaniv Romano

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T12:12:17Z

**Summary**: We develop a framework to quantify the time-to-unsafe-sampling - the number of large language model (LLM) generations required to trigger an unsafe (e.g., toxic) response. Estimating this quantity is challenging, since unsafe responses are exceedingly rare in well-aligned LLMs, potentially occurring only once in thousands of generations. As a result, directly estimating time-to-unsafe-sampling would require collecting training data with a prohibitively large number of generations per prompt. However, with realistic sampling budgets, we often cannot generate enough responses to observe an unsafe outcome for every prompt, leaving the time-to-unsafe-sampling unobserved in many cases, making the estimation and evaluation tasks particularly challenging. To address this, we frame this estimation problem as one of survival analysis and develop a provably calibrated lower predictive bound (LPB) on the time-to-unsafe-sampling of a given prompt, leveraging recent advances in conformal prediction. Our key innovation is designing an adaptive, per-prompt sampling strategy, formulated as a convex optimization problem. The objective function guiding this optimized sampling allocation is designed to reduce the variance of the estimators used to construct the LPB, leading to improved statistical efficiency over naive methods that use a fixed sampling budget per prompt. Experiments on both synthetic and real data support our theoretical results and demonstrate the practical utility of our method for safety risk assessment in generative AI models.

### LunarLoc: Segment-Based Global Localization on the Moon
**Authors**: Annika Thomas, Robaire Galliath, Aleksander Garbuz, Luke Anger, Cormac O'Neill, Trevor Johst, Dami Thomas, George Lordos, Jonathan P. How

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T12:06:47Z

**Summary**: Global localization is necessary for autonomous operations on the lunar surface where traditional Earth-based navigation infrastructure, such as GPS, is unavailable. As NASA advances toward sustained lunar presence under the Artemis program, autonomous operations will be an essential component of tasks such as robotic exploration and infrastructure deployment. Tasks such as excavation and transport of regolith require precise pose estimation, but proposed approaches such as visual-inertial odometry (VIO) accumulate odometry drift over long traverses. Precise pose estimation is particularly important for upcoming missions such as the ISRU Pilot Excavator (IPEx) that rely on autonomous agents to operate over extended timescales and varied terrain. To help overcome odometry drift over long traverses, we propose LunarLoc, an approach to global localization that leverages instance segmentation for zero-shot extraction of boulder landmarks from onboard stereo imagery. Segment detections are used to construct a graph-based representation of the terrain, which is then aligned with a reference map of the environment captured during a previous session using graph-theoretic data association. This method enables accurate and drift-free global localization in visually ambiguous settings. LunarLoc achieves sub-cm level accuracy in multi-session global localization experiments, significantly outperforming the state of the art in lunar global localization. To encourage the development of further methods for global localization on the Moon, we release our datasets publicly with a playback module: https://github.com/mit-acl/lunarloc-data.

### Can LLMs Hack Enterprise Networks? Autonomous Assumed Breach   Penetration-Testing Active Directory Networks
**Authors**: Andreas Happe, Jürgen Cito

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T12:02:54Z

**Summary**: Penetration-testing, while critical for validating defenses and uncovering vulnerabilities, is often limited by high operational costs and the scarcity of human expertise. This paper investigates the feasibility and effectiveness of using Large Language Model (LLM)-driven autonomous systems to address these challenges in real-world Microsoft Active Directory (AD) enterprise networks. Our novel prototype, cochise, represents the first demonstration of a fully autonomous, LLM-driven framework capable of compromising accounts within a real-life Microsoft AD testbed (GOAD). The evaluation deliberately utilizes GOAD to capture the intricate interactions and sometimes nondeterministic outcomes of live network pen-testing, moving beyond the limitations of synthetic benchmarks. We perform our empirical evaluation using five LLMs, comparing reasoning to non-reasoning models as well as including open-weight models. Through comprehensive quantitative and qualitative analysis, incorporating insights from cybersecurity experts, we demonstrate that autonomous LLMs can effectively conduct Assumed Breach simulations. Key findings highlight their ability to dynamically adapt attack strategies, perform inter-context attacks, and generate scenario-specific attack parameters. Cochise also exhibits robust self-correction mechanisms, automatically installing missing tools and rectifying invalid command generations. Critically, we find that the associated costs are competitive with those incurred by professional pen-testers, suggesting a path toward democratizing access to essential security testing for organizations with budgetary constraints. However, our research also illuminates existing limitations, including instances of LLM ``going down rabbit holes'', challenges in comprehensive information transfer between planning and execution modules, and critical safety concerns that necessitate human oversight.

### On Almost Surely Safe Alignment of Large Language Models at   Inference-Time
**Authors**: Xiaotong Ji, Shyam Sundhar Ramesh, Matthieu Zimmer, Ilija Bogunovic, Jun Wang, Haitham Bou Ammar

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T10:54:05Z

**Summary**: We introduce a novel inference-time alignment approach for LLMs that aims to generate safe responses almost surely, i.e., with probability approaching one. Our approach models the generation of safe responses as a constrained Markov Decision Process (MDP) within the LLM's latent space. We augment a safety state that tracks the evolution of safety constraints and dynamically penalize unsafe generations to ensure the generation of safe responses. Consequently, we demonstrate formal safety guarantees w.r.t. the given cost model upon solving the MDP in the latent space with sufficiently large penalties. Building on this foundation, we propose InferenceGuard, a practical implementation that safely aligns LLMs without modifying the model weights. Empirically, we demonstrate that InferenceGuard effectively balances safety and task performance, outperforming existing inference-time alignment methods in generating safe and aligned responses. Our findings contribute to the advancement of safer LLM deployment through alignment at inference-time, thus presenting a promising alternative to resource-intensive, overfitting-prone alignment techniques like RLHF.

### Towards Effective Complementary Security Analysis using Large Language   Models
**Authors**: Jonas Wagner, Simon Müller, Christian Näther, Jan-Philipp Steghöfer, Andreas Both

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T10:46:35Z

**Summary**: A key challenge in security analysis is the manual evaluation of potential security weaknesses generated by static application security testing (SAST) tools. Numerous false positives (FPs) in these reports reduce the effectiveness of security analysis. We propose using Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve the assessment of SAST findings. We investigate the ability of LLMs to reduce FPs while trying to maintain a perfect true positive rate, using datasets extracted from the OWASP Benchmark (v1.2) and a real-world software project. Our results indicate that advanced prompting techniques, such as Chain-of-Thought and Self-Consistency, substantially improve FP detection. Notably, some LLMs identified approximately 62.5% of FPs in the OWASP Benchmark dataset without missing genuine weaknesses. Combining detections from different LLMs would increase this FP detection to approximately 78.9%. Additionally, we demonstrate our approach's generalizability using a real-world dataset covering five SAST tools, three programming languages, and infrastructure files. The best LLM detected 33.85% of all FPs without missing genuine weaknesses, while combining detections from different LLMs would increase this detection to 38.46%. Our findings highlight the potential of LLMs to complement traditional SAST tools, enhancing automation and reducing resources spent addressing false alarms.

### LearnAlign: Reasoning Data Selection for Reinforcement Learning in Large   Language Models Based on Improved Gradient Alignment
**Authors**: Shikun Li, Shipeng Li, Zhiqin Yang, Xinghua Zhang, Gaode Chen, Xiaobo Xia, Hengyu Liu, Zhe Peng

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T10:31:36Z

**Summary**: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a key technique for enhancing LLMs' reasoning abilities, yet its data inefficiency remains a major bottleneck. To address this critical yet challenging issue, we present a novel gradient-alignment-based method, named LearnAlign, which intelligently selects the learnable and representative training reasoning data for RL post-training. To overcome the issue of response-length bias in gradient norms, we introduce the data learnability based on the success rate, which can indicate the learning potential of each data point. Experiments across three mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly reduces training data requirements while achieving minor performance degradation or even improving performance compared to full-data training. For example, it reduces data requirements by up to 1,000 data points with better performance (77.53%) than that on the full dataset on GSM8K benchmark (77.04%). Furthermore, we show its effectiveness in the staged RL setting. This work provides valuable insights into data-efficient RL post-training and establishes a foundation for future research in optimizing reasoning data selection. To facilitate future work, we will release code.

### Dynamic Knowledge Integration for Evidence-Driven Counter-Argument   Generation with Large Language Models
**Authors**: Anar Yeginbergen, Maite Oronoz, Rodrigo Agerri

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T10:27:28Z

**Summary**: This paper investigates the role of dynamic external knowledge integration in improving counter-argument generation using Large Language Models (LLMs). While LLMs have shown promise in argumentative tasks, their tendency to generate lengthy, potentially unfactual responses highlights the need for more controlled and evidence-based approaches. We introduce a new manually curated dataset of argument and counter-argument pairs specifically designed to balance argumentative complexity with evaluative feasibility. We also propose a new LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation methodology that shows a stronger correlation with human judgments compared to traditional reference-based metrics. Our experimental results demonstrate that integrating dynamic external knowledge from the web significantly improves the quality of generated counter-arguments, particularly in terms of relatedness, persuasiveness, and factuality. The findings suggest that combining LLMs with real-time external knowledge retrieval offers a promising direction for developing more effective and reliable counter-argumentation systems.

### PR-Attack: Coordinated Prompt-RAG Attacks on Retrieval-Augmented   Generation in Large Language Models via Bilevel Optimization
**Authors**: Yang Jiao, Xiaodong Wang, Kai Yang

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T10:23:40Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of applications, e.g., medical question-answering, mathematical sciences, and code generation. However, they also exhibit inherent limitations, such as outdated knowledge and susceptibility to hallucinations. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising paradigm to address these issues, but it also introduces new vulnerabilities. Recent efforts have focused on the security of RAG-based LLMs, yet existing attack methods face three critical challenges: (1) their effectiveness declines sharply when only a limited number of poisoned texts can be injected into the knowledge database, (2) they lack sufficient stealth, as the attacks are often detectable by anomaly detection systems, which compromises their effectiveness, and (3) they rely on heuristic approaches to generate poisoned texts, lacking formal optimization frameworks and theoretic guarantees, which limits their effectiveness and applicability. To address these issues, we propose coordinated Prompt-RAG attack (PR-attack), a novel optimization-driven attack that introduces a small number of poisoned texts into the knowledge database while embedding a backdoor trigger within the prompt. When activated, the trigger causes the LLM to generate pre-designed responses to targeted queries, while maintaining normal behavior in other contexts. This ensures both high effectiveness and stealth. We formulate the attack generation process as a bilevel optimization problem leveraging a principled optimization framework to develop optimal poisoned texts and triggers. Extensive experiments across diverse LLMs and datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of PR-Attack, achieving a high attack success rate even with a limited number of poisoned texts and significantly improved stealth compared to existing methods.

### Deep Learning based Visually Rich Document Content Understanding: A   Survey
**Authors**: Yihao Ding, Soyeon Caren Han, Jean Lee, Eduard Hovy

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T10:23:37Z

**Summary**: Visually Rich Documents (VRDs) play a vital role in domains such as academia, finance, healthcare, and marketing, as they convey information through a combination of text, layout, and visual elements. Traditional approaches to extracting information from VRDs rely heavily on expert knowledge and manual annotation, making them labor-intensive and inefficient. Recent advances in deep learning have transformed this landscape by enabling multimodal models that integrate vision, language, and layout features through pretraining, significantly improving information extraction performance. This survey presents a comprehensive overview of deep learning-based frameworks for VRD Content Understanding (VRD-CU). We categorize existing methods based on their modeling strategies and downstream tasks, and provide a comparative analysis of key components, including feature representation, fusion techniques, model architectures, and pretraining objectives. Additionally, we highlight the strengths and limitations of each approach and discuss their suitability for different applications. The paper concludes with a discussion of current challenges and emerging trends, offering guidance for future research and practical deployment in real-world scenarios.

### A Statistical Evaluation of Indoor LoRaWAN Environment-Aware Propagation   for 6G: MLR, ANOVA, and Residual Distribution Analysis
**Authors**: Nahshon Mokua Obiri, Kristof Van Laerhoven

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T10:06:39Z

**Summary**: Modeling path loss in indoor LoRaWAN technology deployments is inherently challenging due to structural obstructions, occupant density and activities, and fluctuating environmental conditions. This study proposes a two-stage approach to capture and analyze these complexities using an extensive dataset of 1,328,334 field measurements collected over six months in a single-floor office at the University of Siegen's Hoelderlinstrasse Campus, Germany. First, we implement a multiple linear regression model that includes traditional propagation metrics (distance, structural walls) and an extension with proposed environmental variables (relative humidity, temperature, carbon dioxide, particulate matter, and barometric pressure). Using analysis of variance, we demonstrate that adding these environmental factors can reduce unexplained variance by 42.32 percent. Secondly, we examine residual distributions by fitting five candidate probability distributions: Normal, Skew-Normal, Cauchy, Student's t, and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) with 2 to 5 components. Our results show that a four-component Gaussian Mixture Model captures the residual heterogeneity of indoor signal propagation most accurately, significantly outperforming single-distribution approaches. Given the push toward ultra-reliable, context-aware communications in 6G networks, our analysis shows that environment-aware modeling can substantially improve LoRaWAN network design in dynamic indoor IoT deployments.

### Revolutionizing Validation and Verification: Explainable Testing   Methodologies for Intelligent Automotive Decision-Making Systems
**Authors**: Halit Eris, Stefan Wagner

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T09:55:56Z

**Summary**: Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS) use complex decision-making (DM) models with multimodal sensory inputs, making rigorous validation and verification (V&V) essential for safety and reliability. These models pose challenges in diagnosing failures, tracing anomalies, and maintaining transparency, with current manual testing methods being inefficient and labor-intensive. This vision paper presents a methodology that integrates explainability, transparency, and interpretability into V&V processes. We propose refining V&V requirements through literature reviews and stakeholder input, generating explainable test scenarios via large language models (LLMs), and enabling real-time validation in simulation environments. Our framework includes test oracle, explanation generation, and a test chatbot, with empirical studies planned to evaluate improvements in diagnostic efficiency and transparency. Our goal is to streamline V&V, reduce resources, and build user trust in autonomous technologies.

### Reward-Agnostic Prompt Optimization for Text-to-Image Diffusion Models
**Authors**: Semin Kim, Yeonwoo Cha, Jaehoon Yoo, Seunghoon Hong

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T09:02:05Z

**Summary**: We investigate a general approach for improving user prompts in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models by finding prompts that maximize a reward function specified at test-time. Although diverse reward models are used for evaluating image generation, existing automated prompt engineering methods typically target specific reward configurations. Consequently, these specialized designs exhibit suboptimal performance when applied to new prompt engineering scenarios involving different reward models. To address this limitation, we introduce RATTPO (Reward-Agnostic Test-Time Prompt Optimization), a flexible test-time optimization method applicable across various reward scenarios without modification. RATTPO iteratively searches for optimized prompts by querying large language models (LLMs) \textit{without} requiring reward-specific task descriptions. Instead, it uses the optimization trajectory and a novel reward-aware feedback signal (termed a "hint") as context. Empirical results demonstrate the versatility of RATTPO, effectively enhancing user prompts across diverse reward setups that assess various generation aspects, such as aesthetics, general human preference, or spatial relationships between objects. RATTPO surpasses other test-time search baselines in search efficiency, using up to 3.5 times less inference budget, and, given sufficient inference budget, achieves performance comparable to learning-based baselines that require reward-specific fine-tuning. The code is available at https://github.com/seminkim/RATTPO.

### Adapting While Learning: Grounding LLMs for Scientific Problems with   Intelligent Tool Usage Adaptation
**Authors**: Bohan Lyu, Yadi Cao, Duncan Watson-Parris, Leon Bergen, Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick, Rose Yu

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T08:54:13Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate promising capabilities in solving scientific problems but often suffer from the issue of hallucination. While integrating LLMs with tools can mitigate this issue, models fine-tuned on tool usage become overreliant on them and incur unnecessary costs. Inspired by how human experts assess problem complexity before selecting solutions, we propose a novel two-component fine-tuning method, Adapting While Learning (AWL). In the first component, World Knowledge Learning (WKL), LLMs internalize scientific knowledge by learning from tool-generated solutions. In the second component, Tool Usage Adaptation (TUA), we categorize problems as easy or hard based on the model's accuracy, and train it to maintain direct reasoning for easy problems while switching to tools for hard ones. We validate our method on six scientific benchmark datasets across climate science, epidemiology, physics, and other domains. Compared to the original instruct model (8B), models post-trained with AWL achieve 29.11% higher answer accuracy and 12.72% better tool usage accuracy, even surpassing state-of-the-art models including GPT-4o and Claude-3.5 on four custom-created datasets. Our code is open-source at https://github.com/Rose-STL-Lab/Adapting-While-Learning.

### AnyTraverse: An off-road traversability framework with VLM and human   operator in the loop
**Authors**: Sattwik Sahu, Agamdeep Singh, Karthik Nambiar, Srikanth Saripalli, P. B. Sujit

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T08:31:13Z

**Summary**: Off-road traversability segmentation enables autonomous navigation with applications in search-and-rescue, military operations, wildlife exploration, and agriculture. Current frameworks struggle due to significant variations in unstructured environments and uncertain scene changes, and are not adaptive to be used for different robot types. We present AnyTraverse, a framework combining natural language-based prompts with human-operator assistance to determine navigable regions for diverse robotic vehicles. The system segments scenes for a given set of prompts and calls the operator only when encountering previously unexplored scenery or unknown class not part of the prompt in its region-of-interest, thus reducing active supervision load while adapting to varying outdoor scenes. Our zero-shot learning approach eliminates the need for extensive data collection or retraining. Our experimental validation includes testing on RELLIS-3D, Freiburg Forest, and RUGD datasets and demonstrate real-world deployment on multiple robot platforms. The results show that AnyTraverse performs better than GA-NAV and Off-seg while offering a vehicle-agnostic approach to off-road traversability that balances automation with targeted human supervision.

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T08:26:12Z

**Summary**: Due to an exponential increase in published research articles, it is impossible for individual scientists to read all publications, even within their own research field. In this work, we investigate the use of large language models (LLMs) for the purpose of extracting the main concepts and semantic information from scientific abstracts in the domain of materials science to find links that were not noticed by humans and thus to suggest inspiring near/mid-term future research directions. We show that LLMs can extract concepts more efficiently than automated keyword extraction methods to build a concept graph as an abstraction of the scientific literature. A machine learning model is trained to predict emerging combinations of concepts, i.e. new research ideas, based on historical data. We demonstrate that integrating semantic concept information leads to an increased prediction performance. The applicability of our model is demonstrated in qualitative interviews with domain experts based on individualized model suggestions. We show that the model can inspire materials scientists in their creative thinking process by predicting innovative combinations of topics that have not yet been investigated.

### Self-supervised Feature Extraction for Enhanced Ball Detection on Soccer   Robots
**Authors**: Can Lin, Daniele Affinita, Marco E. P. Zimmatore, Daniele Nardi, Domenico D. Bloisi, Vincenzo Suriani

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T08:21:34Z

**Summary**: Robust and accurate ball detection is a critical component for autonomous humanoid soccer robots, particularly in dynamic and challenging environments such as RoboCup outdoor fields. However, traditional supervised approaches require extensive manual annotation, which is costly and time-intensive. To overcome this problem, we present a self-supervised learning framework for domain-adaptive feature extraction to enhance ball detection performance. The proposed approach leverages a general-purpose pretrained model to generate pseudo-labels, which are then used in a suite of self-supervised pretext tasks -- including colorization, edge detection, and triplet loss -- to learn robust visual features without relying on manual annotations. Additionally, a model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) strategy is incorporated to ensure rapid adaptation to new deployment scenarios with minimal supervision. A new dataset comprising 10,000 labeled images from outdoor RoboCup SPL matches is introduced, used to validate the method, and made available to the community. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed pipeline outperforms baseline models in terms of accuracy, F1 score, and IoU, while also exhibiting faster convergence.

### Automation Bias in the AI Act: On the Legal Implications of Attempting   to De-Bias Human Oversight of AI
**Authors**: Johann Laux, Hannah Ruschemeier

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T08:07:59Z

**Summary**: This paper examines the legal implications of the explicit mentioning of automation bias (AB) in the Artificial Intelligence Act (AIA). The AIA mandates human oversight for high-risk AI systems and requires providers to enable awareness of AB, i.e., the human tendency to over-rely on AI outputs. The paper analyses the embedding of this extra-juridical concept in the AIA, the asymmetric division of responsibility between AI providers and deployers for mitigating AB, and the challenges of legally enforcing this novel awareness requirement. The analysis shows that the AIA's focus on providers does not adequately address design and context as causes of AB, and questions whether the AIA should directly regulate the risk of AB rather than just mandating awareness. As the AIA's approach requires a balance between legal mandates and behavioural science, the paper proposes that harmonised standards should reference the state of research on AB and human-AI interaction, holding both providers and deployers accountable. Ultimately, further empirical research on human-AI interaction will be essential for effective safeguards.

### Integrating Traditional Technical Analysis with AI: A Multi-Agent   LLM-Based Approach to Stock Market Forecasting
**Authors**: Michał Wawer, Jarosław A. Chudziak

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T08:03:36Z

**Summary**: Traditional technical analysis methods face limitations in accurately predicting trends in today's complex financial markets. This paper introduces ElliottAgents, an multi-agent system that integrates the Elliott Wave Principle with AI for stock market forecasting. The inherent complexity of financial markets, characterized by non-linear dynamics, noise, and susceptibility to unpredictable external factors, poses significant challenges for accurate prediction. To address these challenges, the system employs LLMs to enhance natural language understanding and decision-making capabilities within a multi-agent framework. By leveraging technologies such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), ElliottAgents performs continuous, multi-faceted analysis of market data to identify wave patterns and predict future price movements. The research explores the system's ability to process historical stock data, recognize Elliott wave patterns, and generate actionable insights for traders. Experimental results, conducted on historical data from major U.S. companies, validate the system's effectiveness in pattern recognition and trend forecasting across various time frames. This paper contributes to the field of AI-driven financial analysis by demonstrating how traditional technical analysis methods can be effectively combined with modern AI approaches to create more reliable and interpretable market prediction systems.

### Efficient but Vulnerable: Benchmarking and Defending LLM Batch Prompting   Attack
**Authors**: Murong Yue, Ziyu Yao

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T07:32:36Z

**Summary**: Batch prompting, which combines a batch of multiple queries sharing the same context in one inference, has emerged as a promising solution to reduce inference costs. However, our study reveals a significant security vulnerability in batch prompting: malicious users can inject attack instructions into a batch, leading to unwanted interference across all queries, which can result in the inclusion of harmful content, such as phishing links, or the disruption of logical reasoning. In this paper, we construct BATCHSAFEBENCH, a comprehensive benchmark comprising 150 attack instructions of two types and 8k batch instances, to study the batch prompting vulnerability systematically. Our evaluation of both closed-source and open-weight LLMs demonstrates that all LLMs are susceptible to batch-prompting attacks. We then explore multiple defending approaches. While the prompting-based defense shows limited effectiveness for smaller LLMs, the probing-based approach achieves about 95% accuracy in detecting attacks. Additionally, we perform a mechanistic analysis to understand the attack and identify attention heads that are responsible for it.

### Ask, Fail, Repeat: Meeseeks, an Iterative Feedback Benchmark for LLMs'   Multi-turn Instruction-Following Ability
**Authors**: Jiaming Wang, Yunke Zhao, Peng Ding, Jun Kuang, Zongyu Wang, Xuezhi Cao, Xunliang Cai

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T07:25:51Z

**Summary**: The ability to follow instructions accurately is fundamental for Large Language Models (LLMs) to serve as reliable agents in real-world applications. For complex instructions, LLMs often struggle to fulfill all requirements in a single attempt. In practice, users typically provide iterative feedback until the LLM generates a response that meets all requirements. However, existing instruction-following benchmarks are either single-turn or introduce new requirements in each turn without allowing self-correction. To address this gap, we propose Meeseeks. Meeseeks simulates realistic human-LLM interactions through an iterative feedback framework, which enables models to self-correct based on specific requirement failures in each turn, better reflecting real-world user-end usage patterns. Meanwhile, the benchmark implements a comprehensive evaluation system with 38 capability tags organized across three dimensions: Intent Recognition, Granular Content Validation, and Output Structure Validation. Through rigorous evaluation across LLMs, Meeseeks provides valuable insights into LLMs' instruction-following capabilities in multi-turn scenarios.

### RealSR-R1: Reinforcement Learning for Real-World Image Super-Resolution   with Vision-Language Chain-of-Thought
**Authors**: Junbo Qiao, Miaomiao Cai, Wei Li, Yutong Liu, Xudong Huang, Gaoqi He, Jiao Xie, Jie Hu, Xinghao Chen, Shaohui Lin

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T07:21:21Z

**Summary**: Real-World Image Super-Resolution is one of the most challenging task in image restoration. However, existing methods struggle with an accurate understanding of degraded image content, leading to reconstructed results that are both low-fidelity and unnatural. We present RealSR-R1 in this work, which empowers the RealSR models with understanding and reasoning capabilities. Inspired by the success of Chain of Thought (CoT) in large language models (LLMs), we simulate the human process of handling degraded images and propose the VLCoT framework, which integrates vision and language reasoning. The framework aims to precisely restore image details by progressively generating more comprehensive text and higher-resolution images. To overcome the challenge of traditional supervised learning CoT failing to generalize to real-world scenarios, we introduce, for the first time, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) into the Real-World Image Super-Resolution task. We propose VLCoT-GRPO as a solution, which designs four reward functions: (1) Format reward, used to standardize the CoT process; (2) Degradation reward, to incentivize accurate degradation estimation; (3) Understanding reward, to ensure the accuracy of the generated content; and (4) Generation reward, where we propose using a visual expert model to evaluate the quality of generated images, encouraging the model to generate more realistic images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed RealSR-R1 can generate realistic details and accurately understand image content, particularly in semantically rich scenes or images with severe degradation.

### MIST: Jailbreaking Black-box Large Language Models via Iterative   Semantic Tuning
**Authors**: Muyang Zheng, Yuanzhi Yao, Changting Lin, Rui Wang, Meng Han

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T07:16:47Z

**Summary**: Despite efforts to align large language models (LLMs) with societal and moral values, these models remain susceptible to jailbreak attacks--methods designed to elicit harmful responses. Jailbreaking black-box LLMs is considered challenging due to the discrete nature of token inputs, restricted access to the target LLM, and limited query budget. To address the issues above, we propose an effective method for jailbreaking black-box large language Models via Iterative Semantic Tuning, named MIST. MIST enables attackers to iteratively refine prompts that preserve the original semantic intent while inducing harmful content. Specifically, to balance semantic similarity with computational efficiency, MIST incorporates two key strategies: sequential synonym search, and its advanced version--order-determining optimization. Extensive experiments across two open-source models and four closed-source models demonstrate that MIST achieves competitive attack success rates and attack transferability compared with other state-of-the-art white-box and black-box jailbreak methods. Additionally, we conduct experiments on computational efficiency to validate the practical viability of MIST.

### Planning of Heuristics: Strategic Planning on Large Language Models with   Monte Carlo Tree Search for Automating Heuristic Optimization
**Authors**: Hui Wang, Xufeng Zhang, Chaoxu Mu

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T07:14:59Z

**Summary**: Heuristics have achieved great success in solving combinatorial optimization problems~(COPs). However, heuristics designed by humans require too much domain knowledge and testing time. Since Large Language Models~(LLMs) possess strong capabilities to understand and generate content with a knowledge base that covers various domains, they offer potential ways to automatically optimize heuristics. To this end, we propose Planning of Heuristics~(PoH), an optimization method that integrates LLM self-reflection with Monte Carlo Tree Search, a well-known planning algorithm. PoH iteratively refines generated heuristics by evaluating their performance and providing improvement suggestions. Our method enables to iteratively evaluate the generated heuristics~(states) and improve them based on the improvement suggestions~(actions) and evaluation results~(rewards), by effectively simulating future states to search for paths with higher rewards. In this paper, we apply PoH to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem and the Flow Shop Scheduling Problem. The experimental results show that PoH outperforms hand-crafted heuristics and other Automatic Heuristic Design methods based on LLMs, and achieves the state-of-the-art performance in automating heuristic optimization with LLMs to solve tested COPs, especially with large sizes.

**Authors**: Yutong Xia, Ao Qu, Yunhan Zheng, Yihong Tang, Dingyi Zhuang, Yuxuan Liang, Shenhao Wang, Cathy Wu, Lijun Sun, Roger Zimmermann, Jinhua Zhao

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T07:09:39Z

**Summary**: Urban causal research is essential for understanding the complex, dynamic processes that shape cities and for informing evidence-based policies. However, current practices are often constrained by inefficient and biased hypothesis formulation, challenges in integrating multimodal data, and fragile experimental methodologies. Imagine a system that automatically estimates the causal impact of congestion pricing on commute times by income group or measures how new green spaces affect asthma rates across neighborhoods using satellite imagery and health reports, and then generates comprehensive, policy-ready outputs, including causal estimates, subgroup analyses, and actionable recommendations. In this Perspective, we propose UrbanCIA, an LLM-driven conceptual framework composed of four distinct modular agents responsible for hypothesis generation, data engineering, experiment design and execution, and results interpretation with policy insights. We begin by examining the current landscape of urban causal research through a structured taxonomy of research topics, data sources, and methodological approaches, revealing systemic limitations across the workflow. Next, we introduce the design principles and technological roadmap for the four modules in the proposed framework. We also propose evaluation criteria to assess the rigor and transparency of these AI-augmented processes. Finally, we reflect on the broader implications for human-AI collaboration, equity, and accountability. We call for a new research agenda that embraces LLM-driven tools as catalysts for more scalable, reproducible, and inclusive urban research.

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T07:05:18Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) trained via reinforcement learning with verifiable reward (RLVR) have achieved breakthroughs on tasks with explicit, automatable verification, such as software programming and mathematical problems. Extending RLVR to electronic design automation (EDA), especially automatically generating hardware description languages (HDLs) like Verilog from natural-language (NL) specifications, however, poses three key challenges: the lack of automated and accurate verification environments, the scarcity of high-quality NL-code pairs, and the prohibitive computation cost of RLVR. To this end, we introduce CodeV-R1, an RLVR framework for training Verilog generation LLMs. First, we develop a rule-based testbench generator that performs robust equivalence checking against golden references. Second, we propose a round-trip data synthesis method that pairs open-source Verilog snippets with LLM-generated NL descriptions, verifies code-NL-code consistency via the generated testbench, and filters out inequivalent examples to yield a high-quality dataset. Third, we employ a two-stage "distill-then-RL" training pipeline: distillation for the cold start of reasoning abilities, followed by adaptive DAPO, our novel RLVR algorithm that can reduce training cost by adaptively adjusting sampling rate. The resulting model, CodeV-R1-7B, achieves 68.6% and 72.9% pass@1 on VerilogEval v2 and RTLLM v1.1, respectively, surpassing prior state-of-the-art by 12~20%, while matching or even exceeding the performance of 671B DeepSeek-R1. We will release our model, training pipeline, and dataset to facilitate research in EDA and LLM communities.

### DistillNote: LLM-based clinical note summaries improve heart failure   diagnosis
**Authors**: Heloisa Oss Boll, Antonio Oss Boll, Leticia Puttlitz Boll, Ameen Abu Hanna, Iacer Calixto

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T06:45:40Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) offer unprecedented opportunities to generate concise summaries of patient information and alleviate the burden of clinical documentation that overwhelms healthcare providers. We present Distillnote, a framework for LLM-based clinical note summarization, and generate over 64,000 admission note summaries through three techniques: (1) One-step, direct summarization, and a divide-and-conquer approach involving (2) Structured summarization focused on independent clinical insights, and (3) Distilled summarization that further condenses the Structured summaries. We test how useful are the summaries by using them to predict heart failure compared to a model trained on the original notes. Distilled summaries achieve 79% text compression and up to 18.2% improvement in AUPRC compared to an LLM trained on the full notes. We also evaluate the quality of the generated summaries in an LLM-as-judge evaluation as well as through blinded pairwise comparisons with clinicians. Evaluations indicate that one-step summaries are favoured by clinicians according to relevance and clinical actionability, while distilled summaries offer optimal efficiency (avg. 6.9x compression-to-performance ratio) and significantly reduce hallucinations. We release our summaries on PhysioNet to encourage future research.

### SSR-Zero: Simple Self-Rewarding Reinforcement Learning for Machine   Translation
**Authors**: Wenjie Yang, Mao Zheng, Mingyang Song, Zheng Li, Sitong Wang

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T06:38:44Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable capabilities in machine translation (MT). However, most advanced MT-specific LLMs heavily rely on external supervision signals during training, such as human-annotated reference data or trained reward models (RMs), which are often expensive to obtain and challenging to scale. To overcome this limitation, we propose a Simple Self-Rewarding (SSR) Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework for MT that is reference-free, fully online, and relies solely on self-judging rewards. Training with SSR using 13K monolingual examples and Qwen-2.5-7B as the backbone, our model SSR-Zero-7B outperforms existing MT-specific LLMs, e.g., TowerInstruct-13B and GemmaX-28-9B, as well as larger general LLMs like Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct in English $\leftrightarrow$ Chinese translation tasks from WMT23, WMT24, and Flores200 benchmarks. Furthermore, by augmenting SSR with external supervision from COMET, our strongest model, SSR-X-Zero-7B, achieves state-of-the-art performance in English $\leftrightarrow$ Chinese translation, surpassing all existing open-source models under 72B parameters and even outperforming closed-source models, e.g., GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro. Our analysis highlights the effectiveness of the self-rewarding mechanism compared to the external LLM-as-a-judge approach in MT and demonstrates its complementary benefits when combined with trained RMs. Our findings provide valuable insight into the potential of self-improving RL methods. We have publicly released our code, data and models.

### eSapiens: A Real-World NLP Framework for Multimodal Document   Understanding and Enterprise Knowledge Processing
**Authors**: Isaac Shi, Zeyuan Li, Wenli Wang, Lewei He, Yang Yang, Tianyu Shi

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T06:07:20Z

**Summary**: We introduce eSapiens, a unified question-answering system designed for enterprise settings, which bridges structured databases and unstructured textual corpora via a dual-module architecture. The system combines a Text-to-SQL planner with a hybrid Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline, enabling natural language access to both relational data and free-form documents. To enhance answer faithfulness, the RAG module integrates dense and sparse retrieval, commercial reranking, and a citation verification loop that ensures grounding consistency. We evaluate eSapiens on the RAGTruth benchmark across five leading large language models (LLMs), analyzing performance across key dimensions such as completeness, hallucination, and context utilization. Results demonstrate that eSapiens outperforms a FAISS baseline in contextual relevance and generation quality, with optional strict-grounding controls for high-stakes scenarios. This work provides a deployable framework for robust, citation-aware question answering in real-world enterprise applications.

### DangerMaps: Personalized Safety Advice for Travel in Urban Environments   using a Retrieval-Augmented Language Model
**Authors**: Jonas Oppenlaender

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T06:05:48Z

**Summary**: Planning a trip into a potentially unsafe area is a difficult task. We conducted a formative study on travelers' information needs, finding that most of them turn to search engines for trip planning. Search engines, however, fail to provide easily interpretable results adapted to the context and personal information needs of a traveler. Large language models (LLMs) create new possibilities for providing personalized travel safety advice. To explore this idea, we developed DangerMaps, a mapping system that assists its users in researching the safety of an urban travel destination, whether it is pre-travel or on-location. DangerMaps plots safety ratings onto a map and provides explanations on demand. This late breaking work specifically emphasizes the challenges of designing real-world applications with large language models. We provide a detailed description of our approach to prompt design and highlight future areas of research.

### Can We Detect Failures Without Failure Data? Uncertainty-Aware Runtime   Failure Detection for Imitation Learning Policies
**Authors**: Chen Xu, Tony Khuong Nguyen, Emma Dixon, Christopher Rodriguez, Patrick Miller, Robert Lee, Paarth Shah, Rares Ambrus, Haruki Nishimura, Masha Itkina

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T05:51:24Z

**Summary**: Recent years have witnessed impressive robotic manipulation systems driven by advances in imitation learning and generative modeling, such as diffusion- and flow-based approaches. As robot policy performance increases, so does the complexity and time horizon of achievable tasks, inducing unexpected and diverse failure modes that are difficult to predict a priori. To enable trustworthy policy deployment in safety-critical human environments, reliable runtime failure detection becomes important during policy inference. However, most existing failure detection approaches rely on prior knowledge of failure modes and require failure data during training, which imposes a significant challenge in practicality and scalability. In response to these limitations, we present FAIL-Detect, a modular two-stage approach for failure detection in imitation learning-based robotic manipulation. To accurately identify failures from successful training data alone, we frame the problem as sequential out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. We first distill policy inputs and outputs into scalar signals that correlate with policy failures and capture epistemic uncertainty. FAIL-Detect then employs conformal prediction (CP) as a versatile framework for uncertainty quantification with statistical guarantees. Empirically, we thoroughly investigate both learned and post-hoc scalar signal candidates on diverse robotic manipulation tasks. Our experiments show learned signals to be mostly consistently effective, particularly when using our novel flow-based density estimator. Furthermore, our method detects failures more accurately and faster than state-of-the-art (SOTA) failure detection baselines. These results highlight the potential of FAIL-Detect to enhance the safety and reliability of imitation learning-based robotic systems as they progress toward real-world deployment.

### FDLLM: A Dedicated Detector for Black-Box LLMs Fingerprinting
**Authors**: Zhiyuan Fu, Junfan Chen, Lan Zhang, Ting Yang, Jun Niu, Hongyu Sun, Ruidong Li, Peng Liu, Jice Wang, Fannv He, Yuqing Zhang

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T05:23:34Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly transforming the landscape of digital content creation. However, the prevalent black-box Application Programming Interface (API) access to many LLMs introduces significant challenges in accountability, governance, and security. LLM fingerprinting, which aims to identify the source model by analyzing statistical and stylistic features of generated text, offers a potential solution. Current progress in this area is hindered by a lack of dedicated datasets and the need for efficient, practical methods that are robust against adversarial manipulations. To address these challenges, we introduce FD-Dataset, a comprehensive bilingual fingerprinting benchmark comprising 90,000 text samples from 20 famous proprietary and open-source LLMs. Furthermore, we present FDLLM, a novel fingerprinting method that leverages parameter-efficient Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune a foundation model. This approach enables LoRA to extract deep, persistent features that characterize each source LLM. Through our analysis, we find that LoRA adaptation promotes the aggregation of outputs from the same LLM in representation space while enhancing the separation between different LLMs. This mechanism explains why LoRA proves particularly effective for LLM fingerprinting. Extensive empirical evaluations on FD-Dataset demonstrate FDLLM's superiority, achieving a Macro F1 score 22.1% higher than the strongest baseline. FDLLM also exhibits strong generalization to newly released models, achieving an average accuracy of 95% on unseen models. Notably, FDLLM remains consistently robust under various adversarial attacks, including polishing, translation, and synonym substitution. Experimental results show that FDLLM reduces the average attack success rate from 49.2% (LM-D) to 23.9%.

### Visual Text Mining with Progressive Taxonomy Construction for   Environmental Studies
**Authors**: Sam Yu-Te Lee, Cheng-Wei Hung, Mei-Hua Yuan, Kwan-Liu Ma

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T05:05:12Z

**Summary**: Environmental experts have developed the DPSIR (Driver, Pressure, State, Impact, Response) framework to systematically study and communicate key relationships between society and the environment. Using this framework requires experts to construct a DPSIR taxonomy from a corpus, annotate the documents, and identify DPSIR variables and relationships, which is laborious and inflexible. Automating it with conventional text mining faces technical challenges, primarily because the taxonomy often begins with abstract definitions, which experts progressively refine and contextualize as they annotate the corpus. In response, we develop GreenMine, a system that supports interactive text mining with prompt engineering. The system implements a prompting pipeline consisting of three simple and evaluable subtasks. In each subtask, the DPSIR taxonomy can be defined in natural language and iteratively refined as experts analyze the corpus. To support users evaluate the taxonomy, we introduce an uncertainty score based on response consistency. Then, we design a radial uncertainty chart that visualizes uncertainties and corpus topics, which supports interleaved evaluation and exploration. Using the system, experts can progressively construct the DPSIR taxonomy and annotate the corpus with LLMs. Using real-world interview transcripts, we present a case study to demonstrate the capability of the system in supporting interactive mining of DPSIR relationships, and an expert review in the form of collaborative discussion to understand the potential and limitations of the system. We discuss the lessons learned from developing the system and future opportunities for supporting interactive text mining in knowledge-intensive tasks for other application scenarios.

### GenUP: Generative User Profilers as In-Context Learners for Next POI   Recommender Systems
**Authors**: Wilson Wongso, Hao Xue, Flora D. Salim

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T04:55:47Z

**Summary**: Traditional Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation systems often lack transparency, interpretability, and scrutability due to their reliance on dense vector-based user embeddings. Furthermore, the cold-start problem -- where systems have insufficient data for new users -- limits their ability to generate accurate recommendations. Existing methods often address this by leveraging similar trajectories from other users, but this approach can be computationally expensive and increases the context length for LLM-based methods, making them difficult to scale. To address these limitations, we propose a method that generates natural language (NL) user profiles from large-scale, location-based social network (LBSN) check-ins, utilizing robust personality assessments and behavioral theories. These NL profiles capture user preferences, routines, and behaviors, improving POI prediction accuracy while offering enhanced transparency. By incorporating NL profiles as system prompts to LLMs, our approach reduces reliance on extensive historical data, while remaining flexible, easily updated, and computationally efficient. Our method is not only competitive with other LLM-based methods but is also more scalable for real-world POI recommender systems. Results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms baseline methods, offering a more interpretable and resource-efficient solution for POI recommendation systems. Our source code is available at: https://github.com/w11wo/GenUP/.

### Conformal Inference under High-Dimensional Covariate Shifts via   Likelihood-Ratio Regularization
**Authors**: Sunay Joshi, Shayan Kiyani, George Pappas, Edgar Dobriban, Hamed Hassani

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T04:42:54Z

**Summary**: We consider the problem of conformal prediction under covariate shift. Given labeled data from a source domain and unlabeled data from a covariate shifted target domain, we seek to construct prediction sets with valid marginal coverage in the target domain. Most existing methods require estimating the unknown likelihood ratio function, which can be prohibitive for high-dimensional data such as images. To address this challenge, we introduce the likelihood ratio regularized quantile regression (LR-QR) algorithm, which combines the pinball loss with a novel choice of regularization in order to construct a threshold function without directly estimating the unknown likelihood ratio. We show that the LR-QR method has coverage at the desired level in the target domain, up to a small error term that we can control. Our proofs draw on a novel analysis of coverage via stability bounds from learning theory. Our experiments demonstrate that the LR-QR algorithm outperforms existing methods on high-dimensional prediction tasks, including a regression task for the Communities and Crime dataset, an image classification task from the WILDS repository, and an LLM question-answering task on the MMLU benchmark.

### CDS: Knowledge Component-Driven Data Synthesis Guided by Cognitive   Diagnosis Theory
**Authors**: Haokun Zhao, Jinyi Han, Jiaqing Liang, Yanghua Xiao, Xiaojun Meng, Jiansheng Wei

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T03:44:20Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant advancements, but the increasing complexity of tasks and higher performance demands highlight the need for continuous improvement. Some approaches utilize synthetic data generated by advanced LLMs based on evaluation results to train models. However, conventional evaluation methods fail to provide detailed, fine-grained profiles of LLMs, limiting their guidance for data synthesis. In this paper, we introduce the Cognitive Diagnostic Synthesis (CDS) method, which incorporates a diagnostic process inspired by Cognitive Diagnosis Theory (CDT) to refine evaluation results and characterize model profiles at the knowledge component level. Based on these diagnostics, we propose two diagnosis-synthesis strategies for weakness-targeted data synthesis. Additionally, we present an enhanced data augmentation and selection pipeline to improve the quality and diversity of synthesized data. Our experiments with several open-source models show significant improvements across multiple benchmarks, achieving up to 6.00% improvement in code generation, 13.10% in mathematical reasoning, and 5.43% in academic exams. Code and data are available on GitHub.

### The Role of Model Confidence on Bias Effects in Measured Uncertainties
**Authors**: Xinyi Liu, Weiguang Wang, Hangfeng He

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T03:43:10Z

**Summary**: With the growing adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) for open-ended tasks, accurately assessing epistemic uncertainty, which reflects a model's lack of knowledge, has become crucial to ensuring reliable outcomes. However, quantifying epistemic uncertainty in such tasks is challenging due to the presence of aleatoric uncertainty, which arises from multiple valid answers. While bias can introduce noise into epistemic uncertainty estimation, it may also reduce noise from aleatoric uncertainty. To investigate this trade-off, we conduct experiments on Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks and find that mitigating prompt-introduced bias improves uncertainty quantification in GPT-4o. Building on prior work showing that LLMs tend to copy input information when model confidence is low, we further analyze how these prompt biases affect measured epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty across varying bias-free confidence levels with GPT-4o and Qwen2-VL. We find that all considered biases induce greater changes in both uncertainties when bias-free model confidence is lower. Moreover, lower bias-free model confidence leads to greater underestimation of epistemic uncertainty (i.e. overconfidence) due to bias, whereas it has no significant effect on the direction of changes in aleatoric uncertainty estimation. These distinct effects deepen our understanding of bias mitigation for uncertainty quantification and potentially inform the development of more advanced techniques.

### Automated Skill Discovery for Language Agents through Exploration and   Iterative Feedback
**Authors**: Yongjin Yang, Sinjae Kang, Juyong Lee, Dongjun Lee, Se-Young Yun, Kimin Lee

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T03:16:30Z

**Summary**: Training large language model (LLM) agents to acquire necessary skills and perform diverse tasks within an environment is gaining interest as a means to enable open-endedness. However, creating the training dataset for their skill acquisition faces several challenges. Manual trajectory collection requires significant human effort. Another approach, where LLMs directly propose tasks to learn, is often invalid, as the LLMs lack knowledge of which tasks are actually feasible. Moreover, the generated data may not provide a meaningful learning signal, as agents often already perform well on the proposed tasks. To address this, we propose a novel automatic skill discovery framework EXIF for LLM-powered agents, designed to improve the feasibility of generated target behaviors while accounting for the agents' capabilities. Our method adopts an exploration-first strategy by employing an exploration agent (Alice) to train the target agent (Bob) to learn essential skills in the environment. Specifically, Alice first interacts with the environment to retrospectively generate a feasible, environment-grounded skill dataset, which is then used to train Bob. Crucially, we incorporate an iterative feedback loop, where Alice evaluates Bob's performance to identify areas for improvement. This feedback then guides Alice's next round of exploration, forming a closed-loop data generation process. Experiments on Webshop and Crafter demonstrate EXIF's ability to effectively discover meaningful skills and iteratively expand the capabilities of the trained agent without any human intervention, achieving substantial performance improvements. Interestingly, we observe that setting Alice to the same model as Bob also notably improves performance, demonstrating EXIF's potential for building a self-evolving system.

### Revisiting Multi-Agent Debate as Test-Time Scaling: A Systematic Study   of Conditional Effectiveness
**Authors**: Yongjin Yang, Euiin Yi, Jongwoo Ko, Kimin Lee, Zhijing Jin, Se-Young Yun

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T03:07:38Z

**Summary**: The remarkable growth in large language model (LLM) capabilities has spurred exploration into multi-agent systems, with debate frameworks emerging as a promising avenue for enhanced problem-solving. These multi-agent debate (MAD) approaches, where agents collaboratively present, critique, and refine arguments, potentially offer improved reasoning, robustness, and diverse perspectives over monolithic models. Despite prior studies leveraging MAD, a systematic understanding of its effectiveness compared to self-agent methods, particularly under varying conditions, remains elusive. This paper seeks to fill this gap by conceptualizing MAD as a test-time computational scaling technique, distinguished by collaborative refinement and diverse exploration capabilities. We conduct a comprehensive empirical investigation comparing MAD with strong self-agent test-time scaling baselines on mathematical reasoning and safety-related tasks. Our study systematically examines the influence of task difficulty, model scale, and agent diversity on MAD's performance. Key findings reveal that, for mathematical reasoning, MAD offers limited advantages over self-agent scaling but becomes more effective with increased problem difficulty and decreased model capability, while agent diversity shows little benefit. Conversely, for safety tasks, MAD's collaborative refinement can increase vulnerability, but incorporating diverse agent configurations facilitates a gradual reduction in attack success through the collaborative refinement process. We believe our findings provide critical guidance for the future development of more effective and strategically deployed MAD systems.

### Techniques for supercharging academic writing with generative AI
**Authors**: Zhicheng Lin

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T03:04:52Z

**Summary**: Academic writing is an indispensable yet laborious part of the research enterprise. This Perspective maps out principles and methods for using generative artificial intelligence (AI), specifically large language models (LLMs), to elevate the quality and efficiency of academic writing. We introduce a human-AI collaborative framework that delineates the rationale (why), process (how), and nature (what) of AI engagement in writing. The framework pinpoints both short-term and long-term reasons for engagement and their underlying mechanisms (e.g., cognitive offloading and imaginative stimulation). It reveals the role of AI throughout the writing process, conceptualized through a two-stage model for human-AI collaborative writing, and the nature of AI assistance in writing, represented through a model of writing-assistance types and levels. Building on this framework, we describe effective prompting techniques for incorporating AI into the writing routine (outlining, drafting, and editing) as well as strategies for maintaining rigorous scholarship, adhering to varied journal policies, and avoiding overreliance on AI. Ultimately, the prudent integration of AI into academic writing can ease the communication burden, empower authors, accelerate discovery, and promote diversity in science.

### Beyond principlism: Practical strategies for ethical AI use in research   practices
**Authors**: Zhicheng Lin

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T02:59:45Z

**Summary**: The rapid adoption of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in scientific research, particularly large language models (LLMs), has outpaced the development of ethical guidelines, leading to a "Triple-Too" problem: too many high-level ethical initiatives, too abstract principles lacking contextual and practical relevance, and too much focus on restrictions and risks over benefits and utilities. Existing approaches--principlism (reliance on abstract ethical principles), formalism (rigid application of rules), and technological solutionism (overemphasis on technological fixes)--offer little practical guidance for addressing ethical challenges of AI in scientific research practices. To bridge the gap between abstract principles and day-to-day research practices, a user-centered, realism-inspired approach is proposed here. It outlines five specific goals for ethical AI use: 1) understanding model training and output, including bias mitigation strategies; 2) respecting privacy, confidentiality, and copyright; 3) avoiding plagiarism and policy violations; 4) applying AI beneficially compared to alternatives; and 5) using AI transparently and reproducibly. Each goal is accompanied by actionable strategies and realistic cases of misuse and corrective measures. I argue that ethical AI application requires evaluating its utility against existing alternatives rather than isolated performance metrics. Additionally, I propose documentation guidelines to enhance transparency and reproducibility in AI-assisted research. Moving forward, we need targeted professional development, training programs, and balanced enforcement mechanisms to promote responsible AI use while fostering innovation. By refining these ethical guidelines and adapting them to emerging AI capabilities, we can accelerate scientific progress without compromising research integrity.

### Six Fallacies in Substituting Large Language Models for Human   Participants
**Authors**: Zhicheng Lin

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T02:50:33Z

**Summary**: Can AI systems like large language models (LLMs) replace human participants in behavioral and psychological research? Here I critically evaluate the "replacement" perspective and identify six interpretive fallacies that undermine its validity. These fallacies are: (1) equating token prediction with human intelligence, (2) treating LLMs as the average human, (3) interpreting alignment as explanation, (4) anthropomorphizing AI systems, (5) essentializing identities, and (6) substituting model data for human evidence. Each fallacy represents a potential misunderstanding about what LLMs are and what they can tell us about human cognition. The analysis distinguishes levels of similarity between LLMs and humans, particularly functional equivalence (outputs) versus mechanistic equivalence (processes), while highlighting both technical limitations (addressable through engineering) and conceptual limitations (arising from fundamental differences between statistical and biological intelligence). For each fallacy, specific safeguards are provided to guide responsible research practices. Ultimately, the analysis supports conceptualizing LLMs as pragmatic simulation tools--useful for role-play, rapid hypothesis testing, and computational modeling (provided their outputs are validated against human data)--rather than as replacements for human participants. This framework enables researchers to leverage language models productively while respecting the fundamental differences between machine intelligence and human thought.

### Large Language Models as Psychological Simulators: A Methodological   Guide
**Authors**: Zhicheng Lin

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T02:45:23Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) offer emerging opportunities for psychological and behavioral research, but methodological guidance is lacking. This article provides a framework for using LLMs as psychological simulators across two primary applications: simulating roles and personas to explore diverse contexts, and serving as computational models to investigate cognitive processes. For simulation, we present methods for developing psychologically grounded personas that move beyond demographic categories, with strategies for validation against human data and use cases ranging from studying inaccessible populations to prototyping research instruments. For cognitive modeling, we synthesize emerging approaches for probing internal representations, methodological advances in causal interventions, and strategies for relating model behavior to human cognition. We address overarching challenges including prompt sensitivity, temporal limitations from training data cutoffs, and ethical considerations that extend beyond traditional human subjects review. Throughout, we emphasize the need for transparency about model capabilities and constraints. Together, this framework integrates emerging empirical evidence about LLM performance--including systematic biases, cultural limitations, and prompt brittleness--to help researchers wrangle these challenges and leverage the unique capabilities of LLMs in psychological research.

### GraphRAG-Bench: Challenging Domain-Specific Reasoning for Evaluating   Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation
**Authors**: Yilin Xiao, Junnan Dong, Chuang Zhou, Su Dong, Qian-wen Zhang, Di Yin, Xing Sun, Xiao Huang

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T02:42:32Z

**Summary**: Graph Retrieval Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) has garnered increasing recognition for its potential to enhance large language models (LLMs) by structurally organizing domain-specific corpora and facilitating complex reasoning. However, current evaluations of GraphRAG models predominantly rely on traditional question-answering datasets. Their limited scope in questions and evaluation metrics fails to comprehensively assess the reasoning capacity improvements enabled by GraphRAG models. To address this gap, we introduce GraphRAG-Bench, a large-scale, domain-specific benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate GraphRAG models. Our benchmark offers three key superiorities: \((i)\) Challenging question design. Featuring college-level, domain-specific questions that demand multi-hop reasoning, the benchmark ensures that simple content retrieval is insufficient for problem-solving. For example, some questions require mathematical reasoning or programming. \((ii)\) Diverse task coverage. The dataset includes a broad spectrum of reasoning tasks, multiple-choice, true/false, multi-select, open-ended, and fill-in-the-blank. It spans 16 disciplines in twenty core textbooks. \((iii)\) Holistic evaluation framework. GraphRAG-Bench provides comprehensive assessment across the entire GraphRAG pipeline, including graph construction, knowledge retrieval, and answer generation. Beyond final-answer correctness, it evaluates the logical coherence of the reasoning process. By applying nine contemporary GraphRAG methods to GraphRAG-Bench, we demonstrate its utility in quantifying how graph-based structuring improves model reasoning capabilities. Our analysis reveals critical insights about graph architectures, retrieval efficacy, and reasoning capabilities, offering actionable guidance for the research community.

### Exploring Traffic Simulation and Cybersecurity Strategies Using Large   Language Models
**Authors**: Lu Gao, Yongxin Liu, Hongyun Chen, Dahai Liu, Yunpeng Zhang, Jingran Sun

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T02:41:23Z

**Summary**: Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) are increasingly vulnerable to sophisticated cyberattacks due to their complex, interconnected nature. Ensuring the cybersecurity of these systems is paramount to maintaining road safety and minimizing traffic disruptions. This study presents a novel multi-agent framework leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance traffic simulation and cybersecurity testing. The framework automates the creation of traffic scenarios, the design of cyberattack strategies, and the development of defense mechanisms. A case study demonstrates the framework's ability to simulate a cyberattack targeting connected vehicle broadcasts, evaluate its impact, and implement a defense mechanism that significantly mitigates traffic delays. Results show a 10.2 percent increase in travel time during an attack, which is reduced by 3.3 percent with the defense strategy. This research highlights the potential of LLM-driven multi-agent systems in advancing transportation cybersecurity and offers a scalable approach for future research in traffic simulation and cyber defense.

### From Prompts to Constructs: A Dual-Validity Framework for LLM Research   in Psychology
**Authors**: Zhicheng Lin

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T02:38:42Z

**Summary**: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly being adopted across psychology, serving as research tools, experimental subjects, human simulators, and computational models of cognition. However, the application of human measurement tools to these systems can produce contradictory results, raising concerns that many findings are measurement phantoms--statistical artifacts rather than genuine psychological phenomena. In this Perspective, we argue that building a robust science of AI psychology requires integrating two of our field's foundational pillars: the principles of reliable measurement and the standards for sound causal inference. We present a dual-validity framework to guide this integration, which clarifies how the evidence needed to support a claim scales with its scientific ambition. Using an LLM to classify text may require only basic accuracy checks, whereas claiming it can simulate anxiety demands a far more rigorous validation process. Current practice systematically fails to meet these requirements, often treating statistical pattern matching as evidence of psychological phenomena. The same model output--endorsing "I am anxious"--requires different validation strategies depending on whether researchers claim to measure, characterize, simulate, or model psychological constructs. Moving forward requires developing computational analogues of psychological constructs and establishing clear, scalable standards of evidence rather than the uncritical application of human measurement tools.

**Authors**: Gaurav Kumar Gupta, Pranal Pande, Nirajan Acharya, Aniket Kumar Singh, Suman Niroula

**Updated**: 2025-06-20T02:33:03Z

**Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are revolutionizing medical diagnostics by enhancing both disease classification and clinical decision-making. In this study, we evaluate the performance of two LLM- based diagnostic tools, DeepSeek R1 and O3 Mini, using a structured dataset of symptoms and diagnoses. We assessed their predictive accuracy at both the disease and category levels, as well as the reliability of their confidence scores. DeepSeek R1 achieved a disease-level accuracy of 76% and an overall accuracy of 82%, outperforming O3 Mini, which attained 72% and 75% respectively. Notably, DeepSeek R1 demonstrated exceptional performance in Mental Health, Neurological Disorders, and Oncology, where it reached 100% accuracy, while O3 Mini excelled in Autoimmune Disease classification with 100% accuracy. Both models, however, struggled with Respiratory Disease classification, recording accuracies of only 40% for DeepSeek R1 and 20% for O3 Mini. Additionally, the analysis of confidence scores revealed that DeepSeek R1 provided high-confidence predictions in 92% of cases, compared to 68% for O3 Mini. Ethical considerations regarding bias, model interpretability, and data privacy are also discussed to ensure the responsible integration of LLMs into clinical practice. Overall, our findings offer valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of LLM-based diagnostic systems and provide a roadmap for future enhancements in AI-driven healthcare.
