We delve into\nLLM weight low-rank decomposition, and find that the challenges of this task\nstem from the distribution variance in the LLM activations and the sensitivity\ndifference among various kinds of layers. To address these issues, we propose a\ntraining-free approach called Activation-aware Singular Value Decomposition\n(ASVD). Specifically, ASVD manages activation outliers by transforming the\nweight matrix based on the activation distribution. This transformation allows\nthe outliers in the activation matrix to be absorbed into the transformed\nweight matrix, thereby enhancing decomposition accuracy. Additionally, we\npropose an efficient iterative calibration process to optimize layer-specific\ndecomposition by addressing the varying sensitivity of different LLM layers. In\nthis way, ASVD can compress a network by 10%-30%. Based on the success of the\nlow-rank decomposition of projection matrices in the self-attention module, we\nfurther introduce ASVD to compress the KV cache. By reducing the channel\ndimension of KV activations, memory requirements for KV cache can be largely\nreduced. ASVD can further achieve 50% KV cache reductions without performance\ndrop in a training-free manner. Code is anonymously available in supplementary\nmaterials.",

Our experimental results show that this simple\nstrategy can reduce the KV cache size by 50% on language modelling and\nneedle-in-a-haystack tasks and 90% on passkey retrieval tasks without losing\naccuracy.

Extensive experimental\nresults demonstrate that SparseTem sets a new state-of-the-art by effectively\nutilizing temporal continuity to accelerate CNN-based video encoders."

To overcome\nthis issue, we introduce \\textit{adaptive negative proxies}, which are\ndynamically generated during testing by exploring actual OOD images, to align\nmore closely with the underlying OOD label space and enhance the efficacy of\nnegative proxy guidance. Specifically, our approach utilizes a feature memory\nbank to selectively cache discriminative features from test images,\nrepresenting the targeted OOD distribution. This facilitates the creation of\nproxies that can better align with specific OOD datasets.

The final\nscore for identifying OOD samples integrates static negative labels with our\nproposed adaptive proxies, effectively combining textual and visual knowledge\nfor enhanced performance.

LoCoCo employs only a\nfixed-size Key-Value (KV) cache, and can enhance efficiency in both inference\nand fine-tuning stages. Diverging from prior methods that selectively drop KV\npairs based on heuristics, LoCoCo leverages a data-driven adaptive fusion\ntechnique, blending previous KV pairs with incoming tokens to minimize the loss\nof contextual information and ensure accurate attention modeling. This token\nintegration is achieved through injecting one-dimensional convolutional kernels\nthat dynamically calculate mixing weights for each KV cache slot. Designed for\nbroad compatibility with existing LLM frameworks, LoCoCo allows for\nstraightforward \"drop-in\" integration without needing architectural\nmodifications, while incurring minimal tuning overhead. Experiments demonstrate\nthat LoCoCo maintains consistently outstanding performance across various\ncontext lengths and can achieve a high context compression rate during both\ninference and fine-tuning phases. During inference, we successfully compressed\nup to 3482 tokens into a 128-size KV cache, while retaining comparable\nperformance to the full sequence - an accuracy improvement of up to 0.2791\ncompared to baselines at the same cache size.

In contrast, WarmSwap offers a broad middle ground, which optimizes\nentire categories of serverless functions. WarmSwap eliminates the need to\ninitialize middleware or software dependencies when launching a new serverless\ncontainer, by migrating a pre-initialized live dependency image to the new\nfunction instance. WarmSwap respects the provider's cache constraints, as a\nsingle pre-warmed dependency image in the cache is shared among all serverless\nfunctions requiring that software dependency image. WarmSwap has been tested on\nseven representative functions from FunctionBench. In those tests, WarmSwap\naccelerates dependency loading for serverless functions with large dependency\nrequirements by a factor ranging from 2.2 to 3.2. Simulation experiments using\nAzure traces indicate that WarmSwap can save 88\\% of optimization space when\nsharing a dependency image among ten different functions.",

To solve this problem, we propose a\nsample-based blocking technique for the Last Level Cache (LLC). Our approach\ninvolves defining a threshold value and sampling a subset of cache sets. If the\nnumber of writes to a way in a sampled set exceeds the threshold, the way is\nblocked, and writes are redirected to other ways. We also maintain a history\nstructure to record the number of writes in a set and a PC-Table to use for\nblocking in unsampled sets. Based on blocking on sampled sets, variance of\nvalues stored in history is used to determine whether blocking had a positive\nimpact or not, and on this basis, value corresponding to instruction pointer is\nincremented or decremented. This value is later used for blocking in unsampled\nsets. Our results show that our approach significantly balances write traffic\nto the cache and improves the overall lifespan of the memory cells while having\nbetter performance to the base-line system.

                    "value": "The increasing use of Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) in computer architecture has\nbrought about new challenges, one of which is the write endurance problem.\nFrequent writes to a particular cache cell in NVM can lead to degradation of\nthe memory cell and reduce its lifespan. To solve this problem, we propose a\nsample-based blocking technique for the Last Level Cache (LLC). Our approach\ninvolves defining a threshold value and sampling a subset of cache sets. If the\nnumber of writes to a way in a sampled set exceeds the threshold, the way is\nblocked, and writes are redirected to other ways. We also maintain a history\nstructure to record the number of writes in a set and a PC-Table to use for\nblocking in unsampled sets. Based on blocking on sampled sets, variance of\nvalues stored in history is used to determine whether blocking had a positive\nimpact or not, and on this basis, value corresponding to instruction pointer is\nincremented or decremented. This value is later used for blocking in unsampled\nsets. Our results show that our approach significantly balances write traffic\nto the cache and improves the overall lifespan of the memory cells while having\nbetter performance to the base-line system. Our approach can also be applied to\nother cache hierarchies and NVM technologies to mitigate the problem of write\nendurance."

Yet, it is widely criticized that KV-Cache can become a\nbottleneck of the LLM inference system, especially when confronted with\nultra-large models and long-context queries. A natural remedy is to discard the\nKV-Cache for less important tokens, with StreamingLLM as an example, but the\nused static eviction strategies cannot flexibly adapt to varying contexts.\nRemedies like H2O leverage accumulative attention scores to perform dynamic\neviction but suffer from the attention bias issue in capturing contextual\ninformation. This paper bridges this gap by devising a parameterized KV-Cache\neviction mechanism, dubbed as Attention-Gate, which accepts the whole context\nas input and yields eviction flags for each token to realize in-context\neviction. The subsequent self-attention module proceeds according to the flags\nand only the KV states for the remaining tokens need to be cached. The\nAttention-Gates can vary among different heads and layers and be trivially\nplugged into pre-trained LLMs, tuned by cost-effective continual pre-training\nor supervised fine-tuning objectives to acquire what to discard. The\ncomputational and memory overhead introduced by Attention-Gates is minimal. Our\nmethod is validated across multiple tasks, demonstrating both efficiency and\nadaptability. After a highly efficient continual pre-training, it achieves\nhigher average accuracy and evicts more tokens compared to traditional\ntraining-free methods. In supervised fine-tuning, it not only evicts many\ntokens but also outperforms LoRA-finetuned LLMs on some datasets, such as RTE,\nwhere it improves accuracy by 13.9% while evicting 62.8% of tokens, showing\nthat effective eviction of redundant tokens can even enhance performance.",

However, the large memory overhead of the key-value (KV) cache poses\nsignificant challenges in long-context scenarios.

Other methods design new architectures with less KV\noverhead but require significant training overhead. To address the above two\ndrawbacks, we further explore the redundancy in the channel dimension and apply\nan architecture-level design with minor training costs. Therefore, we introduce\nCSKV, a training-efficient Channel Shrinking technique for KV cache\ncompression: (1) We first analyze the singular value distribution of the KV\ncache, revealing significant redundancy and compression potential along the\nchannel dimension. Based on this observation, we propose using low-rank\ndecomposition for key and value layers and storing the low-dimension features.\n(2) To preserve model performance, we introduce a bi-branch KV cache, including\na window-based full-precision KV cache and a low-precision compressed KV cache.\n(3) To reduce the training costs, we minimize the layer-wise reconstruction\nloss for the compressed KV cache instead of retraining the entire LLMs.\nExtensive experiments show that CSKV can reduce the memory overhead of the KV\ncache by 80% while maintaining the model's long-context capability. Moreover,\nwe show that our method can be seamlessly combined with quantization to further\nreduce the memory overhead, achieving a compression ratio of up to 95%.

However, prevalent quantization methods, such as 8-bit\nweight-activation or 4-bit weight-only quantization, achieve limited\nperformance improvements due to poor support for low-precision (e.g., 4-bit)\nactivation. This work, for the first time, realizes practical W4A4KV4 serving\nfor LLMs, fully utilizing the INT4 tensor cores on modern GPUs and reducing the\nmemory bottleneck caused by the KV cache. Specifically, we propose a novel\nfine-grained mixed-precision quantization algorithm (FMPQ) that compresses most\nactivations into 4-bit with negligible accuracy loss. To support\nmixed-precision matrix multiplication for W4A4 and W4A8, we develop a highly\noptimized W4Ax kernel. Our approach introduces a novel mixed-precision data\nlayout to facilitate access and fast dequantization for activation and weight\ntensors, utilizing the GPU's software pipeline to hide the overhead of data\nloading and conversion. Additionally, we propose fine-grained streaming\nmultiprocessor (SM) scheduling to achieve load balance across different SMs. We\nintegrate the optimized W4Ax kernel into our inference framework, COMET, and\nprovide efficient management to support popular LLMs such as LLaMA-3-70B.\nExtensive evaluations demonstrate that, when running LLaMA family models on a\nsingle A100-80G-SMX4, COMET achieves a kernel-level speedup of\n\\textbf{$2.88\\times$} over cuBLAS and a \\textbf{$2.02 \\times$} throughput\nimprovement compared to TensorRT-LLM from an end-to-end framework perspective.",

VidCompress employs a dual-compressor\napproach: a memory-enhanced compressor captures both short-term and long-term\ntemporal relationships in videos and compresses the visual tokens using a\nmultiscale transformer with a memory-cache mechanism, while a text-perceived\ncompressor generates condensed visual tokens by utilizing Q-Former and\nintegrating temporal contexts into query embeddings with cross attention.\nExperiments on several VideoQA datasets and comprehensive benchmarks\ndemonstrate that VidCompress efficiently models complex temporal-spatial\nrelations and significantly outperforms existing Video-LLMs."

                "summary": "Language Models (LMs) assign significant attention to the first token, even\nif it is not semantically important, which is known as attention sink. This\nphenomenon has been widely adopted in applications such as streaming/long\ncontext generation, KV cache optimization, inference acceleration, model\nquantization, and others. Despite its widespread use, a deep understanding of\nattention sink in LMs is still lacking. In this work, we first demonstrate that\nattention sinks exist universally in LMs with various inputs, even in small\nmodels. Furthermore, attention sink is observed to emerge during the LM\npre-training, motivating us to investigate how optimization, data distribution,\nloss function, and model architecture in LM pre-training influence its\nemergence. We highlight that attention sink emerges after effective\noptimization on sufficient training data. The sink position is highly\ncorrelated with the loss function and data distribution.

After relaxing such dependence by replacing softmax attention\nwith other attention operations, such as sigmoid attention without\nnormalization, attention sinks do not emerge in LMs up to 1B parameters.

This\nphenomenon has been widely adopted in applications such as streaming/long\ncontext generation, KV cache optimization, inference acceleration, model\nquantization, and others. Despite its widespread use, a deep understanding of\nattention sink in LMs is still lacking. In this work, we first demonstrate that\nattention sinks exist universally in LMs with various inputs, even in small\nmodels.

In this study, we explore the hydrodynamics of a concentric\nactive compound particle - a model microswimmer (a squirmer) positioned at the\ncentre of a viscoelastic fluid droplet (a model cargo) suspended in another\nviscoelastic medium. We consider the Oldroyd-B constitutive model to\ncharacterize the fluids and employ a perturbative approach in the Deborah\nnumber to analyze viscoelastic effects analytically, assuming a small Capillary\nnumber so that the droplet remains spherical and does not deform. We examine\nthree cases: (i) a squirmer confined within a viscoelastic fluid droplet\nsuspended in a Newtonian fluid, (ii) a squirmer confined within a Newtonian\nfluid droplet suspended in a viscoelastic fluid, and (iii) a squirmer confined\nwithin a viscoelastic fluid droplet suspended in another viscoelastic fluid.\nOur findings reveal that the swimming speeds of the squirmer and the droplet\nare determined by the complex interplay of viscoelasticity, the size ratio of\nthe droplet to the squirmer (confinement strength), and the viscosity ratio of\nthe surrounding fluid to the droplet fluid. A critical aspect of this\ninteraction is the positioning of stagnation points within the fluid flow,\nwhich governs the distribution of polymeric stress. This distribution, in turn,\nplays a crucial role in determining the influence of viscoelasticity on the\nsquirmer's dynamics. Our analysis suggests that viscoelastic effects can either\nenhance or hinder the swimming speed of the squirmer when confined in a\ndroplet, depending on the specific configuration of the system.",

                    "value": "Understanding the hydrodynamics of microswimmers in viscoelastic fluids and\nconfined environments is crucial for interpreting their behaviour in natural\nsettings and designing synthetic microswimmers for practical applications like\ncargo transport. In this study, we explore the hydrodynamics of a concentric\nactive compound particle - a model microswimmer (a squirmer) positioned at the\ncentre of a viscoelastic fluid droplet (a model cargo) suspended in another\nviscoelastic medium. We consider the Oldroyd-B constitutive model to\ncharacterize the fluids and employ a perturbative approach in the Deborah\nnumber to analyze viscoelastic effects analytically, assuming a small Capillary\nnumber so that the droplet remains spherical and does not deform. We examine\nthree cases: (i) a squirmer confined within a viscoelastic fluid droplet\nsuspended in a Newtonian fluid, (ii) a squirmer confined within a Newtonian\nfluid droplet suspended in a viscoelastic fluid, and (iii) a squirmer confined\nwithin a viscoelastic fluid droplet suspended in another viscoelastic fluid.\nOur findings reveal that the swimming speeds of the squirmer and the droplet\nare determined by the complex interplay of viscoelasticity, the size ratio of\nthe droplet to the squirmer (confinement strength), and the viscosity ratio of\nthe surrounding fluid to the droplet fluid. A critical aspect of this\ninteraction is the positioning of stagnation points within the fluid flow,\nwhich governs the distribution of polymeric stress. This distribution, in turn,\nplays a crucial role in determining the influence of viscoelasticity on the\nsquirmer's dynamics. Our analysis suggests that viscoelastic effects can either\nenhance or hinder the swimming speed of the squirmer when confined in a\ndroplet, depending on the specific configuration of the system."

However, most studies focus on addressing only one of these\nbottlenecks and do not adequately support dynamic adjustment of sparsity\nconcerning distinct layers or tasks. In this paper, we present ZipVL, an\nefficient inference framework designed for LVLMs that resolves both computation\nand memory bottlenecks through a dynamic ratio allocation strategy of important\ntokens. This ratio is adaptively determined based on the layer-specific\ndistribution of attention scores, rather than fixed hyper-parameters, thereby\nimproving efficiency for less complex tasks while maintaining high performance\nfor more challenging ones. Then we select important tokens based on their\nnormalized attention scores and perform attention mechanism solely on those\nimportant tokens to accelerate the prefill phase. To mitigate the memory\nbottleneck in the decoding phase, we employ mixed-precision quantization to the\nKV cache, where high-bit quantization is used for caches of important tokens,\nwhile low-bit quantization is applied to those of less importance. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that ZipVL can accelerate the prefill phase by\n2.6$\\times$ and reduce GPU memory usage by 50.0%, with a minimal accuracy\nreduction of only 0.2% on Video-MME benchmark over LongVA-7B model, effectively\nenhancing the generation efficiency of LVLMs.",

We aim\nto investigate the suitability of the twisting jet model presented in previous\nworks to explain the multi-wavelength behaviour of BL Lacertae, the prototype\nof one of the blazar classes. According to this model, the jet is\ninhomogeneous, curved, and twisting, and the long-term variability is due to\nchanges in the Doppler factor due to variations in the orientation of the\njet-emitting regions. We analysed optical data of the source obtained during\nmonitoring campaigns organised by the Whole Earth Blazar Telescope (WEBT) in\n2019-2022, together with radio data from the WEBT and other teams, and\ngamma-ray data from the Fermi satellite. In this period, BL Lacertae underwent\nan extraordinary activity phase, reaching its historical optical and gamma-ray\nbrightness maxima. The application of the twisting jet model to the source\nlight curves allows us to infer the wiggling motion of the optical, radio, and\ngamma-ray jet-emitting regions. The optical-radio correlation shows that the\nchanges in the radio viewing angle follow those in the optical viewing angle by\nabout 120 days, and it suggests that the jet is composed of plasma filaments,\nwhich is in agreement with some radio high-resolution observations of other\nsources. The gamma-ray emitting region is found to be co-spatial with the\noptical one, and the analysis of the gamma-optical correlation is consistent\nwith both the geometric interpretation and a synchrotron self-Compton (SSC)\norigin of the high-energy photons. We propose a geometric scenario where the\njet is made up of a pair of emitting plasma filaments in a sort of double-helix\ncurved rotating structure, whose wiggling motion produces changes in the\nDoppler beaming and can thus explain the observed multi-wavelength long-term\nvariability.",

According to this model, the jet is\ninhomogeneous, curved, and twisting, and the long-term variability is due to\nchanges in the Doppler factor due to variations in the orientation of the\njet-emitting regions. We analysed optical data of the source obtained during\nmonitoring campaigns organised by the Whole Earth Blazar Telescope (WEBT) in\n2019-2022, together with radio data from the WEBT and other teams, and\ngamma-ray data from the Fermi satellite. In this period, BL Lacertae underwent\nan extraordinary activity phase, reaching its historical optical and gamma-ray\nbrightness maxima. The application of the twisting jet model to the source\nlight curves allows us to infer the wiggling motion of the optical, radio, and\ngamma-ray jet-emitting regions. The optical-radio correlation shows that the\nchanges in the radio viewing angle follow those in the optical viewing angle by\nabout 120 days, and it suggests that the jet is composed of plasma filaments,\nwhich is in agreement with some radio high-resolution observations of other\nsources. The gamma-ray emitting region is found to be co-spatial with the\noptical one, and the analysis of the gamma-optical correlation is consistent\nwith both the geometric interpretation and a synchrotron self-Compton (SSC)\norigin of the high-energy photons. We propose a geometric scenario where the\njet is made up of a pair of emitting plasma filaments in a sort of double-helix\ncurved rotating structure, whose wiggling motion produces changes in the\nDoppler beaming and can thus explain the observed multi-wavelength long-term\nvariability."

By\nbalancing CECE along the original premise, we achieve significant improvements\nover previous methods without requiring additional fine-tuning, producing\nstate-of-the-art results on benchmarks that score agreement with human\njudgments for image-text alignment, and achieving an increase in performance on\nWinoground of +19.2% (group score) and +12.9% on EqBen (group score) over the\nbest prior work (finetuned with targeted data)."

This paper explores\nthe application of LLMs in the context of code mutation, a process where the\nstructure of program code is altered without changing its functionality.\nTraditionally, code mutation has been employed to increase software robustness\nin mission-critical applications. Additionally, mutation engines have been\nexploited by malware developers to evade the signature-based detection methods\nemployed by malware detection systems. Existing code mutation engines, often\nused by such threat actors, typically result in only limited variations in the\nmalware, which can still be identified through static code analysis. However,\nthe agility demonstrated by an LLM-based code synthesizer could significantly\nchange this threat landscape by allowing for more complex code mutations that\nare not easily detected using static analysis. One can increase variations of\ncodes synthesized by a pre-trained LLM through fine-tuning and retraining. This\nprocess is what we refer to as code mutation training. In this paper, we\npropose a novel definition of code mutation training tailored for pre-trained\nLLM-based code synthesizers and demonstrate this training on a lightweight\npre-trained model.

                    "value": "Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly\nimproved their capabilities in natural language processing and code synthesis,\nenabling more complex applications across different fields. This paper explores\nthe application of LLMs in the context of code mutation, a process where the\nstructure of program code is altered without changing its functionality.\nTraditionally, code mutation has been employed to increase software robustness\nin mission-critical applications. Additionally, mutation engines have been\nexploited by malware developers to evade the signature-based detection methods\nemployed by malware detection systems. Existing code mutation engines, often\nused by such threat actors, typically result in only limited variations in the\nmalware, which can still be identified through static code analysis. However,\nthe agility demonstrated by an LLM-based code synthesizer could significantly\nchange this threat landscape by allowing for more complex code mutations that\nare not easily detected using static analysis. One can increase variations of\ncodes synthesized by a pre-trained LLM through fine-tuning and retraining. This\nprocess is what we refer to as code mutation training. In this paper, we\npropose a novel definition of code mutation training tailored for pre-trained\nLLM-based code synthesizers and demonstrate this training on a lightweight\npre-trained model. Our approach involves restructuring (i.e., mutating) code at\nthe subroutine level, which allows for more manageable mutations while\nmaintaining the semantic integrity verified through unit testing.

However,\nlittle research has systematically examined the real-world impacts of LLM\navailability on educational equity beyond theoretical projections and\ncontrolled studies of innovative LLM applications. To depict trends of post-LLM\ninequalities, we analyze 1,140,328 academic writing submissions from 16,791\ncollege students across 2,391 courses between 2021 and 2024 at a public,\nminority-serving institution in the US. We find that students' overall writing\nquality gradually increased following the availability of LLMs and that the\nwriting quality gaps between linguistically advantaged and disadvantaged\nstudents became increasingly narrower. However, this equitizing effect was more\nconcentrated on students with higher socioeconomic status. These findings shed\nlight on the digital divides in the era of LLMs and raise questions about the\nequity benefits of LLMs in early stages and highlight the need for researchers\nand practitioners on developing responsible practices to improve educational\nequity through LLMs.",

However, when adapting LLMs to non-linguistic\ndomains, it remains unclear if softmax over discrete bins captures the\ncontinuous structure of the tokens and the potentially complex distributions\nneeded for high quality token generation. We introduce a neural network layer,\nconstructed using Fourier series, which we can easily substitute for any linear\nlayer if we want the outputs to have a more continuous structure. We perform\nextensive analysis on synthetic datasets, as well as on large-scale decision\nmaking and time series forecasting tasks. We also provide theoretical evidence\nthat this layer can better learn signal from data while ignoring high-frequency\nnoise. All of our results support the effectiveness of our proposed Fourier\nhead in scenarios where the underlying data distribution has a natural\ncontinuous structure. For example, the Fourier head improves a Decision\nTransformer agent's returns by 46% on the Atari Seaquest game, and increases a\nstate-of-the-art times series foundation model's forecasting performance by\n3.5% across 20 benchmarks unseen during training.",

Using high quality human data has been the most common approach to\nunlock model performance, but is prohibitively expensive in many scenarios.\nSeveral alternative methods have also emerged, such as generating synthetic or\nhybrid data, but the effectiveness of these approaches remain unclear,\nespecially in resource-constrained scenarios and tasks that are not easily\nverified. To investigate this, we group various synthetic data generation\nstrategies into three representative categories -- Answer Augmentation,\nQuestion Rephrase and New Question -- and study the performance of student LLMs\ntrained under various constraints, namely seed instruction set size and query\nbudget. We demonstrate that these strategies are not equally effective across\nsettings. Notably, the optimal data generation strategy depends strongly on the\nratio between the available teacher query budget and the size of the seed\ninstruction set. When this ratio is low, generating new answers to existing\nquestions proves most effective, but as this ratio increases, generating new\nquestions becomes optimal. Across all tasks, we find that choice of\naugmentation method and other design choices matter substantially more in low\nto mid data regimes than in high data regimes. We provide a practical framework\nfor selecting the appropriate augmentation method across settings, taking into\naccount additional factors such as the scalability of each method, the\nimportance of verifying synthetic data, and the use of different LLMs for\nsynthetic data generation.",

This\nindicates an urgent need for further research on the development of targeted\ndefenses against backdoor attacks on LLM-based agents. Warning: This paper may\ncontain biased content."

Most established techniques are designed for brain MRI by supposing\nthat image intensities in the identical tissue follow a uniform distribution.\nSuch an assumption cannot be easily applied to other organs, especially those\nthat are small in size and heterogeneous in texture (large variations in\nintensity), such as the prostate. To address this problem, this paper proposes\na probabilistic Hadamard U-Net (PHU-Net) for prostate MRI bias field\ncorrection. First, a novel Hadamard U-Net (HU-Net) is introduced to extract the\nlow-frequency scalar field, multiplied by the original input to obtain the\nprototypical corrected image. HU-Net converts the input image from the time\ndomain into the frequency domain via Hadamard transform. In the frequency\ndomain, high-frequency components are eliminated using the trainable filter\n(scaling layer), hard-thresholding layer, and sparsity penalty. Next, a\nconditional variational autoencoder is used to encode possible bias\nfield-corrected variants into a low-dimensional latent space. Random samples\ndrawn from latent space are then incorporated with a prototypical corrected\nimage to generate multiple plausible images. Experimental results demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of PHU-Net in correcting bias-field in prostate MRI with a\nfast inference speed.

We\nfocus on close-book Question Answering (CBQA), where previous work has not\nfully addressed the distinction between two possible kinds of hallucinations,\nnamely, whether the model (1) does not hold the correct answer in its\nparameters or (2) answers incorrectly despite having the required knowledge. We\nargue that distinguishing these cases is crucial for detecting and mitigating\nhallucinations. Specifically, case (2) may be mitigated by intervening in the\nmodel's internal computation, as the knowledge resides within the model's\nparameters. In contrast, in case (1) there is no parametric knowledge to\nleverage for mitigation, so it should be addressed by resorting to an external\nknowledge source or abstaining. To help distinguish between the two cases, we\nintroduce Wrong Answer despite having Correct Knowledge (WACK), an approach for\nconstructing model-specific datasets for the second hallucination type. Our\nprobing experiments indicate that the two kinds of hallucinations are\nrepresented differently in the model's inner states. Next, we show that\ndatasets constructed using WACK exhibit variations across models, demonstrating\nthat even when models share knowledge of certain facts, they still vary in the\nspecific examples that lead to hallucinations. Finally, we show that training a\nprobe on our WACK datasets leads to better hallucination detection of case (2)\nhallucinations than using the common generic one-size-fits-all datasets.

                "summary": "Accurately predicting the future fluid is vital to extensive areas such as\nmeteorology, oceanology, and aerodynamics. However, since the fluid is usually\nobserved from the Eulerian perspective, its moving and intricate dynamics are\nseriously obscured and confounded in static grids, bringing thorny challenges\nto the prediction. This paper introduces a new Lagrangian-Eulerian combined\nparadigm to tackle the tanglesome fluid dynamics. Instead of solely predicting\nthe future based on Eulerian observations, we propose DeepLag to discover\nhidden Lagrangian dynamics within the fluid by tracking the movements of\nadaptively sampled key particles. Further, DeepLag presents a new paradigm for\nfluid prediction, where the Lagrangian movement of the tracked particles is\ninferred from Eulerian observations, and their accumulated Lagrangian dynamics\ninformation is incorporated into global Eulerian evolving features to guide\nfuture prediction respectively. Tracking key particles not only provides a\ntransparent and interpretable clue for fluid dynamics but also makes our model\nfree from modeling complex correlations among massive grids for better\nefficiency.

                    "value": "Accurately predicting the future fluid is vital to extensive areas such as\nmeteorology, oceanology, and aerodynamics. However, since the fluid is usually\nobserved from the Eulerian perspective, its moving and intricate dynamics are\nseriously obscured and confounded in static grids, bringing thorny challenges\nto the prediction. This paper introduces a new Lagrangian-Eulerian combined\nparadigm to tackle the tanglesome fluid dynamics. Instead of solely predicting\nthe future based on Eulerian observations, we propose DeepLag to discover\nhidden Lagrangian dynamics within the fluid by tracking the movements of\nadaptively sampled key particles. Further, DeepLag presents a new paradigm for\nfluid prediction, where the Lagrangian movement of the tracked particles is\ninferred from Eulerian observations, and their accumulated Lagrangian dynamics\ninformation is incorporated into global Eulerian evolving features to guide\nfuture prediction respectively. Tracking key particles not only provides a\ntransparent and interpretable clue for fluid dynamics but also makes our model\nfree from modeling complex correlations among massive grids for better\nefficiency.

In this paper, we investigate the potential benefits of\naugmenting the classifier training set with (negative) synthetic examples.\nThese synthetic examples are generated to imitate the style of the author of\ninterest. We analyze the improvements in classifier prediction that this\naugmentation brings to bear in the task of AV in an adversarial setting. In\nparticular, we experiment with three different generator architectures (one\nbased on Recurrent Neural Networks, another based on small-scale transformers,\nand another based on the popular GPT model) and with two training strategies\n(one inspired by standard Language Models, and another inspired by Wasserstein\nGenerative Adversarial Networks). We evaluate our hypothesis on five datasets\n(three of which have been specifically collected to represent an adversarial\nsetting) and using two learning algorithms for the AV classifier (Support\nVector Machines and Convolutional Neural Networks).

These tokens are then processed through a\ndecoder-only transformer architecture to train for the next token prediction\ntask across spatial-temporal series. This GPT-style method allows the model to\nlearn the motion distribution in real driving scenarios. SMART achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance across most of the metrics on the generative Sim\nAgents challenge, ranking 1st on the leaderboards of Waymo Open Motion Dataset\n(WOMD), demonstrating remarkable inference speed. Moreover, SMART represents\nthe generative model in the autonomous driving motion domain, exhibiting\nzero-shot generalization capabilities: Using only the NuPlan dataset for\ntraining and WOMD for validation, SMART achieved a competitive score of 0.72 on\nthe Sim Agents challenge. Lastly, we have collected over 1 billion motion\ntokens from multiple datasets, validating the model's scalability. These\nresults suggest that SMART has initially emulated two important properties:\nscalability and zero-shot generalization, and preliminarily meets the needs of\nlarge-scale real-time simulation applications. We have released all the code to\npromote the exploration of models for motion generation in the autonomous\ndriving field. The source code is available at\nhttps://github.com/rainmaker22/SMART.",

These tokens are then processed through a\ndecoder-only transformer architecture to train for the next token prediction\ntask across spatial-temporal series.

However, the quality of these exemplars in the\nprompt greatly impacts performance, highlighting the need for an effective\nautomated exemplar selection method. Recent studies have explored\nretrieval-based approaches to select exemplars tailored to individual test\nqueries, which can be undesirable due to extra test-time computation and an\nincreased risk of data exposure.

Using the flexible Fortran/Python interface, we have successfully\nreplaced ARP-GEM1's deep convection scheme with a neural network emulator. To\nassess the performance of the neural network deep convection scheme, we have\nrun a 5-years ARP-GEM1 simulation using the neural network emulator. The\nevaluation of averaged fields showed good agreement with output from an\nARP-GEM1 simulation using the physics-based deep convection scheme. The Python\ncomponent was deployed on a separate partition from the general circulation\nmodel, using GPUs to increase inference speed of the neural network."

However, under common scenarios, such as when generations from a\nmodel pair are very similar, or when stochastic decoding results in large\nvariations in generations, it results in inconsistent preference ratings. We\naddress these challenges by introducing a meta-evaluation measure,\nseparability, which estimates how suitable a test instance is for pairwise\npreference evaluation. For a candidate test instance, separability samples\nmultiple generations from a pair of models, and measures how distinguishable\nthe two sets of generations are. Our experiments show that instances with high\nseparability values yield more consistent preference ratings from both human-\nand auto-raters. Further, the distribution of separability allows insights into\nwhich test benchmarks are more valuable for comparing models. Finally, we\nincorporate separability into ELO ratings, accounting for how suitable each\ntest instance might be for reliably ranking LLMs. Overall, separability has\nimplications for consistent, efficient and robust preference evaluation of LLMs\nwith both human- and auto-raters.",

                    "value": "Human evaluation of generated language through pairwise preference judgments\nis pervasive. However, under common scenarios, such as when generations from a\nmodel pair are very similar, or when stochastic decoding results in large\nvariations in generations, it results in inconsistent preference ratings. We\naddress these challenges by introducing a meta-evaluation measure,\nseparability, which estimates how suitable a test instance is for pairwise\npreference evaluation. For a candidate test instance, separability samples\nmultiple generations from a pair of models, and measures how distinguishable\nthe two sets of generations are. Our experiments show that instances with high\nseparability values yield more consistent preference ratings from both human-\nand auto-raters. Further, the distribution of separability allows insights into\nwhich test benchmarks are more valuable for comparing models. Finally, we\nincorporate separability into ELO ratings, accounting for how suitable each\ntest instance might be for reliably ranking LLMs. Overall, separability has\nimplications for consistent, efficient and robust preference evaluation of LLMs\nwith both human- and auto-raters."

Current methods rely on encoder-based models, which\nsuffer from limitations such as poor generalization and restricted input\nlengths. Decoder-only large language models (LLMs), with their extensive\npre-training, larger size, and longer input capabilities, offer potential\nsolutions to these issues, yet their effectiveness in code search remains\nunderexplored. To fill this gap, our study presents the first systematic\nexploration of decoder-only LLMs for code search. We evaluate nine\nstate-of-the-art decoder-only models using two fine-tuning methods, two\ndatasets (CSN and CoSQA$^+$), and three model sizes. Our findings reveal that\nfine-tuned CodeGemma significantly outperforms encoder-only models like\nUniXcoder, achieving a 5.57% improvement in MRR on CSN and a 49.6% increase in\nMAP on CoSQA$^+$ compared to zero-shot UniXcoder. These results highlight the\nsuperior performance and adaptability of decoder-only models. Additionally, we\nprovide valuable insights into optimizing these models for code search,\ncovering aspects such as model selection, fine-tuning methods, training data,\nand model size, and discussing their strengths and limitations.",

Using high quality human data has been the most common approach to\nunlock model performance, but is prohibitively expensive in many scenarios.\nSeveral alternative methods have also emerged, such as generating synthetic or\nhybrid data, but the effectiveness of these approaches remain unclear,\nespecially in resource-constrained scenarios and tasks that are not easily\nverified. To investigate this, we group various synthetic data generation\nstrategies into three representative categories -- Answer Augmentation,\nQuestion Rephrase and New Question -- and study the performance of student LLMs\ntrained under various constraints, namely seed instruction set size and query\nbudget. We demonstrate that these strategies are not equally effective across\nsettings. Notably, the optimal data generation strategy depends strongly on the\nratio between the available teacher query budget and the size of the seed\ninstruction set. When this ratio is low, generating new answers to existing\nquestions proves most effective, but as this ratio increases, generating new\nquestions becomes optimal. Across all tasks, we find that choice of\naugmentation method and other design choices matter substantially more in low\nto mid data regimes than in high data regimes.

Existing evaluations rely on deterministic point estimates generated\nvia greedy decoding. However, we find that deterministic evaluations fail to\ncapture the whole output distribution of a model, yielding inaccurate\nestimations of model capabilities. This is particularly problematic in critical\ncontexts such as unlearning and alignment, where precise model evaluations are\ncrucial. To remedy this, we introduce the first formal probabilistic evaluation\nframework in LLMs. Namely, we derive novel metrics with high-probability\nguarantees concerning the output distribution of a model. Our metrics are\napplication-independent and allow practitioners to make more reliable estimates\nabout model capabilities before deployment. Through a case study focused on\nunlearning, we reveal that deterministic evaluations falsely indicate\nsuccessful unlearning, whereas our probabilistic evaluations demonstrate that\nmost if not all of the supposedly unlearned information remains accessible in\nthese models. Additionally, we propose a novel unlearning loss based on entropy\noptimization and adaptive temperature scaling, which significantly improves\nunlearning in probabilistic settings on recent benchmarks.

However, current TAG approaches face two primary challenges:\n(i) Heavy reliance on label information and (ii) Limited cross-domain\nzero/few-shot transferability. These issues constrain the scaling of both data\nand model size, owing to high labor costs and scaling laws, complicating the\ndevelopment of graph foundation models with strong transferability. In this\nwork, we propose the GraphCLIP framework to address these challenges by\nlearning graph foundation models with strong cross-domain zero/few-shot\ntransferability through a self-supervised contrastive graph-summary pretraining\nmethod. Specifically, we generate and curate large-scale graph-summary pair\ndata with the assistance of LLMs, and introduce a novel graph-summary\npretraining method, combined with invariant learning, to enhance graph\nfoundation models with strong cross-domain zero-shot transferability. For\nfew-shot learning, we propose a novel graph prompt tuning technique aligned\nwith our pretraining objective to mitigate catastrophic forgetting and minimize\nlearning costs. Extensive experiments show the superiority of GraphCLIP in both\nzero-shot and few-shot settings, while evaluations across various downstream\ntasks confirm the versatility of GraphCLIP.

Therefore, a prominent path is to extrapolate the RoPE trained\non comparably short texts to far longer texts.

The capability of in-context learning (ICL) allows us to adapt an\nLLM to downstream tasks by including input-label exemplars in the prompt\nwithout model fine-tuning. However, the quality of these exemplars in the\nprompt greatly impacts performance, highlighting the need for an effective\nautomated exemplar selection method. Recent studies have explored\nretrieval-based approaches to select exemplars tailored to individual test\nqueries, which can be undesirable due to extra test-time computation and an\nincreased risk of data exposure. Moreover, existing methods fail to adequately\naccount for the impact of exemplar ordering on the performance. On the other\nhand, the impact of the instruction, another essential component in the prompt\ngiven to the LLM, is often overlooked in existing exemplar selection methods.\nTo address these challenges, we propose a novel method named EASE, which\nleverages the hidden embedding from a pre-trained language model to represent\nordered sets of exemplars and uses a neural bandit algorithm to optimize the\nsets of exemplars while accounting for exemplar ordering. Our EASE can\nefficiently find an ordered set of exemplars that performs well for all test\nqueries from a given task, thereby eliminating test-time computation.\nImportantly, EASE can be readily extended to jointly optimize both the\nexemplars and the instruction.

This\ncomputational invariance is applied to the hidden state (residual) of the LLM,\nas well as to the activations of the feed-forward components, aspects of the\nattention mechanism, and to the KV cache. The result is a quantized model where\nall matrix multiplications are performed in 4 bits, without any channels\nidentified for retention in higher precision. Our 4-bit quantized LLaMa2-70B\nmodel has losses of at most 0.47 WikiText-2 perplexity and retains 99% of the\nzero-shot performance.

                "summary": "Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification involves assigning unique labels to\neach pixel to identify various land cover categories. While deep classifiers\nhave achieved high predictive accuracy in this field, they lack the ability to\nrigorously quantify confidence in their predictions. Quantifying the certainty\nof model predictions is crucial for the safe usage of predictive models, and\nthis limitation restricts their application in critical contexts where the cost\nof prediction errors is significant. To support the safe deployment of HSI\nclassifiers, we first provide a theoretical proof establishing the validity of\nthe emerging uncertainty quantification technique, conformal prediction, in the\ncontext of HSI classification. We then propose a conformal procedure that\nequips any trained HSI classifier with trustworthy prediction sets, ensuring\nthat these sets include the true labels with a user-specified probability\n(e.g., 95\\%). Building on this foundation, we introduce Spatial-Aware Conformal\nPrediction (\\texttt{SACP}), a conformal prediction framework specifically\ndesigned for HSI data. This method integrates essential spatial information\ninherent in HSIs by aggregating the non-conformity scores of pixels with high\nspatial correlation, which effectively enhances the efficiency of prediction\nsets.

                    "value": "Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification involves assigning unique labels to\neach pixel to identify various land cover categories. While deep classifiers\nhave achieved high predictive accuracy in this field, they lack the ability to\nrigorously quantify confidence in their predictions. Quantifying the certainty\nof model predictions is crucial for the safe usage of predictive models, and\nthis limitation restricts their application in critical contexts where the cost\nof prediction errors is significant. To support the safe deployment of HSI\nclassifiers, we first provide a theoretical proof establishing the validity of\nthe emerging uncertainty quantification technique, conformal prediction, in the\ncontext of HSI classification. We then propose a conformal procedure that\nequips any trained HSI classifier with trustworthy prediction sets, ensuring\nthat these sets include the true labels with a user-specified probability\n(e.g., 95\\%). Building on this foundation, we introduce Spatial-Aware Conformal\nPrediction (\\texttt{SACP}), a conformal prediction framework specifically\ndesigned for HSI data. This method integrates essential spatial information\ninherent in HSIs by aggregating the non-conformity scores of pixels with high\nspatial correlation, which effectively enhances the efficiency of prediction\nsets. Both theoretical and empirical results validate the effectiveness of our\nproposed approach. The source code is available at\n\\url{https://github.com/J4ckLiu/SACP}."

Although massive\nefforts have been made to empower the logical reasoning ability of LLMs via\nexternal logical symbolic solvers, crucial challenges of the poor\ngeneralization ability to questions with different features and inevitable\nquestion information loss of symbolic solver-driven approaches remain\nunresolved. To mitigate these issues, we introduce LINA, a LLM-driven\nneuro-symbolic approach for faithful logical reasoning. By enabling an LLM to\nautonomously perform the transition from propositional logic extraction to\nsophisticated logical reasoning, LINA not only bolsters the resilience of the\nreasoning process but also eliminates the dependency on external solvers.\nAdditionally, through its adoption of a hypothetical-deductive reasoning\nparadigm, LINA effectively circumvents the expansive search space challenge\nthat plagues traditional forward reasoning methods. Empirical evaluations\ndemonstrate that LINA substantially outperforms both established propositional\nlogic frameworks and conventional prompting techniques across a spectrum of\nfive logical reasoning tasks. Specifically, LINA achieves an improvement of\n24.34% over LINC on the FOLIO dataset, while also surpassing prompting\nstrategies like CoT and CoT-SC by up to 24.02%.

                    "value": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable potential across a\nwide array of reasoning tasks, including logical reasoning. Although massive\nefforts have been made to empower the logical reasoning ability of LLMs via\nexternal logical symbolic solvers, crucial challenges of the poor\ngeneralization ability to questions with different features and inevitable\nquestion information loss of symbolic solver-driven approaches remain\nunresolved. To mitigate these issues, we introduce LINA, a LLM-driven\nneuro-symbolic approach for faithful logical reasoning. By enabling an LLM to\nautonomously perform the transition from propositional logic extraction to\nsophisticated logical reasoning, LINA not only bolsters the resilience of the\nreasoning process but also eliminates the dependency on external solvers.\nAdditionally, through its adoption of a hypothetical-deductive reasoning\nparadigm, LINA effectively circumvents the expansive search space challenge\nthat plagues traditional forward reasoning methods. Empirical evaluations\ndemonstrate that LINA substantially outperforms both established propositional\nlogic frameworks and conventional prompting techniques across a spectrum of\nfive logical reasoning tasks. Specifically, LINA achieves an improvement of\n24.34% over LINC on the FOLIO dataset, while also surpassing prompting\nstrategies like CoT and CoT-SC by up to 24.02%.

This\npaper presents a lightweight method, Norm Voting (NoVo), which harnesses the\nuntapped potential of attention head norms to dramatically enhance factual\naccuracy in zero-shot multiple-choice questions (MCQs). NoVo begins by\nautomatically selecting truth-correlated head norms with an efficient,\ninference-only algorithm using only 30 random samples, allowing NoVo to\neffortlessly scale to diverse datasets. Afterwards, selected head norms are\nemployed in a simple voting algorithm, which yields significant gains in\nprediction accuracy. On TruthfulQA MC1, NoVo surpasses the current\nstate-of-the-art and all previous methods by an astounding margin -- at least\n19 accuracy points. NoVo demonstrates exceptional generalization to 20 diverse\ndatasets, with significant gains in over 90\\% of them, far exceeding all\ncurrent representation editing and reading methods.
