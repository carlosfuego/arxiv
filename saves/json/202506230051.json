Prior work has attempted to mitigate this by caching and reusing\nfeatures within diffusion transformers across inference steps. These methods,\nhowever, often rely on rigid heuristics that result in limited acceleration or\npoor generalization across architectures. We propose Evolutionary Caching to\nAccelerate Diffusion models (ECAD), a genetic algorithm that learns efficient,\nper-model, caching schedules forming a Pareto frontier, using only a small set\nof calibration prompts. ECAD requires no modifications to network parameters or\nreference images. It offers significant inference speedups, enables\nfine-grained control over the quality-latency trade-off, and adapts seamlessly\nto different diffusion models. Notably, ECAD's learned schedules can generalize\neffectively to resolutions and model variants not seen during calibration. We\nevaluate ECAD on PixArt-alpha, PixArt-Sigma, and FLUX-1.dev using multiple\nmetrics (FID, CLIP, Image Reward) across diverse benchmarks (COCO, MJHQ-30k,\nPartiPrompts), demonstrating consistent improvements over previous approaches.\nOn PixArt-alpha, ECAD identifies a schedule that outperforms the previous\nstate-of-the-art method by 4.47 COCO FID while increasing inference speedup\nfrom 2.35x to 2.58x.

                "summary": "Sparse data structures are commonly used in neural networks to reduce the\nmemory footprint. These data structures are compact but cause irregularities\nsuch as random memory accesses, which prevent efficient use of the memory\nhierarchy. GPUs are a common platform for machine learning practitioners, but\nrunning compact data structures on these devices often leads to slow-downs due\nto inefficient use of computing and memory resources. This paper proposes a new\ncompiler transformation, enumerate-and-sparse-coarsen, that accelerates sparse\nmatrix-matrix multiplication (SPMM) on GPU devices.

These data structures are compact but cause irregularities\nsuch as random memory accesses, which prevent efficient use of the memory\nhierarchy.

This paper proposes a new\ncompiler transformation, enumerate-and-sparse-coarsen, that accelerates sparse\nmatrix-matrix multiplication (SPMM) on GPU devices.

This work introduces LongSpec, a framework that addresses\nthese challenges through three core innovations: a memory-efficient draft model\nwith a constant-sized KV cache; novel position indices that mitigate the\ntraining-inference mismatch; and an attention aggregation strategy that\ncombines fast prefix computation with standard tree attention to enable\nefficient decoding. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of LongSpec,\nachieving up to a 3.26x speedup over strong Flash Attention baselines across\nfive long-context understanding datasets, as well as a 2.25x reduction in\nwall-clock time on the AIME24 long reasoning task with the QwQ model,\ndemonstrating significant latency improvements for long-context applications.\nThe code is available at https://github.com/sail-sg/LongSpec."

The\nfollowing is the list of what we believe to be novelties:\n  * Cached path to exploit sequential locality, and fast truncation thereof on\nerase operation;\n  * A hash table (or, rather, a cache table) with hard O(1) time guarantees on\nany operation to speed up key lookup (up to a pre-leaf node);\n  * Hardware-accelerated \"find next/previous set bit\" operations with BMI2\ninstruction set extension on x86-64;\n  * Order book-specific features: the preemption principle and the tree\nrestructure operation that prevent the tree from consuming too much memory.\n  We achieve the following speedups over C++'s standard std::map container:\n6x-20x on modifying operations, 30x on lookup operations, 9x-15x on real market\ndata, and a more modest 2x-3x speedup on iteration. In this paper, we discuss\nour implementation."

In this paper, we propose\nBlock-wise Adaptive Caching(BAC), a method to accelerate Diffusion Policy by\ncaching intermediate action features. BAC achieves lossless action generation\nacceleration by adaptively updating and reusing cached features at the block\nlevel, based on a key observation that feature similarities vary non-uniformly\nacross timesteps and locks. To operationalize this insight, we first propose\nthe Adaptive Caching Scheduler, designed to identify optimal update timesteps\nby maximizing the global feature similarities between cached and skipped\nfeatures. However, applying this scheduler for each block leads to signiffcant\nerror surges due to the inter-block propagation of caching errors, particularly\nwithin Feed-Forward Network (FFN) blocks. To mitigate this issue, we develop\nthe Bubbling Union Algorithm, which truncates these errors by updating the\nupstream blocks with signiffcant caching errors before downstream FFNs. As a\ntraining-free plugin, BAC is readily integrable with existing transformer-based\nDiffusion Policy and vision-language-action models. Extensive experiments on\nmultiple robotic benchmarks demonstrate that BAC achieves up to 3x inference\nspeedup for free.",

While these models have attained high accuracy\nby leveraging additional computation at test time, they need to generate long\nchain-of-thought reasoning in order to think before answering, which requires\ngenerating thousands of tokens. While sparse attention methods can help reduce\nthe KV cache pressure induced by this long autoregressive reasoning, these\nmethods can introduce errors which disrupt the reasoning process. Additionally,\nprior methods often pre-process the input to make it easier to identify the\nimportant prompt tokens when computing attention during generation, and this\npre-processing is challenging to perform online for newly generated reasoning\ntokens. Our work addresses these challenges by introducing Multipole Attention,\nwhich accelerates autoregressive reasoning by only computing exact attention\nfor the most important tokens, while maintaining approximate representations\nfor the remaining tokens. Our method first performs clustering to group\ntogether semantically similar key vectors, and then uses the cluster centroids\nboth to identify important key vectors and to approximate the remaining key\nvectors in order to retain high accuracy. We design a fast cluster update\nprocess to quickly re-cluster the input and previously generated tokens,\nthereby allowing for accelerating attention to the previous output tokens. We\nevaluate our method using emerging LRMs such as Qwen-8B, demonstrating that our\napproach can maintain accuracy on complex reasoning tasks even with aggressive\nattention sparsity settings. We also provide kernel implementations to\ndemonstrate the practical efficiency gains from our method, achieving up to\n4.5$\\times$ speedup for attention in long-context reasoning applications.

Our key finding is that MLA+RoPE\nwith half-rank latent dimensions (r = d/2) achieves a 45% KV-cache memory\nreduction while incurring only a 0.3% increase in validation loss (essentially\nmatching MHA quality)- a Pareto improvement for memory constrained deployment.\nWe further show that RoPE is crucial for MLA in small models: without it, MLA\nunderperforms vanilla attention by 3-5%, but with RoPE, it surpasses vanilla by\n2%. Inference benchmarks on NVIDIA A100 GPUs reveal that MLA with r=d/2\nachieves a 1.4 times speedup over full-rank MLA while maintaining the memory\nsavings.

The key problem is that data plane\nperformance is slow, and scaled instances remain stopped while parameters are\nloading. In this paper, we first show that the data plane can be made fast with\nno or O(1) caching by loading parameters through the compute network between\nGPUs because: (1) its speed is comparable to host cache and is underutilized,\nand (2) scaling multiple instances requires no or O(1) caching with\nnetwork-optimized multicast. Second, autoscaling can be made live by breaking\nthe scaling abstraction for inference from a coarse-grained instance-level to a\nfine-grained layer-level. This allows us to offload the layer computation from\nthe overloaded serving instances to the scaled ones without waiting for the\nparameters to be fully loaded. Under real-world workloads, our system\nBLITZSCALE achieves up to 94 % lower tail latency reductions compared to\nstate-of-the-art autoscaling system (ServerlessLLM), and it reduces the GPU\ntime used for serving by 49 % when compared with serving systems that do not\nsupport autoscaling like DistServe and vLLM with the same\nservice-level-agreement.",

Instead, we propose\nself-study, a training recipe in which we generate synthetic conversations\nabout the corpus and train the Cartridge with a context-distillation objective.\nWe find that Cartridges trained with self-study replicate the functionality of\nICL, while being significantly cheaper to serve. On challenging long-context\nbenchmarks, Cartridges trained with self-study match ICL performance while\nusing 38.6x less memory and enabling 26.4x higher throughput. Self-study also\nextends the model's effective context length (e.g. from 128k to 484k tokens on\nMTOB) and surprisingly, leads to Cartridges that can be composed at inference\ntime without retraining.",

Instead, we propose\nself-study, a training recipe in which we generate synthetic conversations\nabout the corpus and train the Cartridge with a context-distillation objective.\nWe find that Cartridges trained with self-study replicate the functionality of\nICL, while being significantly cheaper to serve. On challenging long-context\nbenchmarks, Cartridges trained with self-study match ICL performance while\nusing 38.6x less memory and enabling 26.4x higher throughput. Self-study also\nextends the model's effective context length (e.g. from 128k to 484k tokens on\nMTOB) and surprisingly, leads to Cartridges that can be composed at inference\ntime without retraining."

In\nthe Weyl semimetal TaIrTe4, we report for the first time that the sign of the\nthird-order NLHE reverses with decreasing temperature. Through scaling law\nanalysis, we think that the third-order NLHE at high (T > 23 K) and low (T < 23\nK) temperatures is dominated by Berry-connection polarizability (BCP) and\nimpurity scattering, respectively. The third-order NLHE response strength can\nbe effectively modulated by an additional applied in-plane constant electric\nfield. At the high temperature region, the BCP reduction induced by the\nelectric field leads to a decrease in the third-order NLHE response strength,\nwhile at the low temperature region, the electric field cause both BCP and\nimpurity scattering effects to weaken, resulting in a more significant\nmodulation of the third-order NLHE response strength. At 4 K and an electric\nfield strength of 0.3 kV/cm, the modulated relative response strength could\nreach up to 65.3%. This work provides a new means to explore the third-order\nNLHE and a valuable reference for the development of novel electronic devices.",

To achieve high throughput, IMPACT (i) eliminates\nexpensive cache bypassing steps required by processor-centric memory-based\ntiming attacks and (ii) leverages the intrinsic parallelism of PiM operations.\nWe showcase two applications of IMPACT. First, we build two covert channels\nthat leverage different PiM approaches (i.e., processing-near-memory and\nprocessing-using-memory) to establish high-throughput covert communication\nchannels. Our covert channels achieve 8.2 Mb/s and 14.8 Mb/s communication\nthroughput, respectively, which is 3.6x and 6.5x higher than the\nstate-of-the-art main memory-based covert channel. Second, we showcase a\nside-channel attack that leaks private information of concurrently-running\nvictim applications with a low error rate.

However, for many of\nthese applications, much of the context in the prompt is fixed across different\nuser inputs, thereby providing the opportunity to perform offline optimizations\nin order to process user inputs quickly, as they are received.

In future\ndevelopments, the remaining limitations of the prototype will be addressed for\nimproved minibeam and first ever microbeam radiation therapy in a clinical\nsetting."

In this work, we\npropose autoregressive adversarial post-training (AAPT) to transform a\npre-trained latent video diffusion model into a real-time, interactive video\ngenerator. Our model autoregressively generates a latent frame at a time using\na single neural function evaluation (1NFE). The model can stream the result to\nthe user in real time and receive interactive responses as controls to generate\nthe next latent frame. Unlike existing approaches, our method explores\nadversarial training as an effective paradigm for autoregressive generation.\nThis not only allows us to design an architecture that is more efficient for\none-step generation while fully utilizing the KV cache, but also enables\ntraining the model in a student-forcing manner that proves to be effective in\nreducing error accumulation during long video generation. Our experiments\ndemonstrate that our 8B model achieves real-time, 24fps, streaming video\ngeneration at 736x416 resolution on a single H100, or 1280x720 on 8xH100 up to\na minute long (1440 frames).

To properly confirm these findings, we introduce a pointed\nTransformer training benchmark, considering three objectives (language\nmodelling, image classification, and diffusion modelling) across different\nstages of training.

These techniques are often designed with a\npre-defined KV budget; however, as the optimal budget varies by different input\nlengths and task types, the existence of a fixed budget could result in\ninconsistent performance accepting inputs of diverse domains. To address this\nlimitation, we propose a new KV cache compression objective: to always ensure\nthe full-cache performance regardless of specific inputs, while maximizing KV\ncache pruning as much as possible. To achieve this goal, we introduce a novel\nKV cache compression method dubbed DBudgetKV, which features an attention-based\nmetric to signal when the remaining KV cache is unlikely to match the\nfull-cache performance, then halting the pruning process. Empirical evaluation\nspanning diverse context lengths, task types, and model sizes suggests that our\nmethod achieves lossless KV pruning effectively and robustly, exceeding 25%\ncompression ratio on average. Furthermore, our method is easy to integrate\nwithin LLM inference, not only optimizing memory space, but also showing\nreduced inference time compared to existing methods.",

In this work, we propose ParallelComp, a parallel long-context\ncompression method that effectively overcomes the memory bottleneck, enabling\n8B-parameter LLMs to extrapolate from 8K to 128K tokens on a single A100 80GB\nGPU in a training-free setting. ParallelComp splits the input into chunks,\ndynamically evicting redundant chunks and irrelevant tokens, supported by a\nparallel KV cache eviction mechanism. Importantly, we present a systematic\ntheoretical and empirical analysis of attention biases in parallel\nattention-including the attention sink, recency bias, and middle bias-and\nreveal that these biases exhibit distinctive patterns under ultra-long context\nsettings. We further design a KV cache eviction technique to mitigate this\nphenomenon. Experimental results show that ParallelComp enables an 8B model\n(trained on 8K context) to achieve 91.17% of GPT-4's performance under\nultra-long contexts, outperforming closed-source models such as Claude-2 and\nKimi-Chat.

Concomitantly, the modern\nera is witnessing the proliferation of web applications in all aspects of human\nlife, including IoT and other network services. Contemporary IoT and network\nsolutions heavily rely on web applications to render services. However, despite\nthe recent research and development pivoted around LoRa, there is still a lack\nof studies focusing on web application access over LoRa networks. Specifically,\ntechnical challenges like payload size limitation, low data rate, and\ncontentions in multi-user setups limit the applicability of LoRa for web\napplications. Hence, we propose LoRaWeb, which enables web access over LoRa\nnetworks. The LoRaWeb hardware tethers a WiFi hotspot to which the client\ndevices connect and access the web pages using a web browser. LoRa backbone of\nthe network handles the web page transmission from the requester and receiver\ndevices.

                    "value": "The minimal infrastructure requirements of LoRa make it suitable for\ndeployments in remote and disaster-stricken areas. Concomitantly, the modern\nera is witnessing the proliferation of web applications in all aspects of human\nlife, including IoT and other network services. Contemporary IoT and network\nsolutions heavily rely on web applications to render services. However, despite\nthe recent research and development pivoted around LoRa, there is still a lack\nof studies focusing on web application access over LoRa networks. Specifically,\ntechnical challenges like payload size limitation, low data rate, and\ncontentions in multi-user setups limit the applicability of LoRa for web\napplications. Hence, we propose LoRaWeb, which enables web access over LoRa\nnetworks. The LoRaWeb hardware tethers a WiFi hotspot to which the client\ndevices connect and access the web pages using a web browser. LoRa backbone of\nthe network handles the web page transmission from the requester and receiver\ndevices. LoRaWeb implements a synchronization procedure to address the\naforementioned challenges for effective message exchange between requesters and\nresponders. The system implements a caching mechanism to reduce latency and\ncontention.

Existing software mitigations,\nhowever, often introduce excessive overhead by indiscriminately hardening\ninstructions without assessing their vulnerability. We propose an analysis\nframework that employs a novel fixpoint algorithm to detect Spectre\nvulnerabilities and apply targeted hardening. The fixpoint algorithm accounts\nfor program behavior changes induced by stepwise hardening, enabling precise,\nsound and efficient vulnerability detection. This framework also provides\nflexibility for diverse hardening strategies and attacker models, enabling\ncustomized targeted hardening. We instantiate the framework as LightSLH, which\nhardens program with provable security.\n  We evaluate LightSLH on cryptographic algorithms from OpenSSL, Libsodium,\nNaCL and PQClean. Across all experimental cases, LightSLH provides the lowest\noverhead among current provable protection strategies, including 0\\% overhead\nin 50\\% cases. Notably, the analysis of LightSLH reveals two previously unknown\nsecurity issues: (1) The compiler can introduce risks overlooked by LLSCT, a\nhardening method proven secure at the LLVM IR level.

                    "value": "Spectre v1 attacks pose a substantial threat to security-critical software,\nparticularly cryptographic implementations. Existing software mitigations,\nhowever, often introduce excessive overhead by indiscriminately hardening\ninstructions without assessing their vulnerability. We propose an analysis\nframework that employs a novel fixpoint algorithm to detect Spectre\nvulnerabilities and apply targeted hardening. The fixpoint algorithm accounts\nfor program behavior changes induced by stepwise hardening, enabling precise,\nsound and efficient vulnerability detection. This framework also provides\nflexibility for diverse hardening strategies and attacker models, enabling\ncustomized targeted hardening. We instantiate the framework as LightSLH, which\nhardens program with provable security.\n  We evaluate LightSLH on cryptographic algorithms from OpenSSL, Libsodium,\nNaCL and PQClean. Across all experimental cases, LightSLH provides the lowest\noverhead among current provable protection strategies, including 0\\% overhead\nin 50\\% cases. Notably, the analysis of LightSLH reveals two previously unknown\nsecurity issues: (1) The compiler can introduce risks overlooked by LLSCT, a\nhardening method proven secure at the LLVM IR level. We successfully construct\na side channel by exploiting compiler-inserted stack loads, confirming this\nrisk.

We reveal that conventional\ninference scaling techniques, despite their success in reasoning tasks, perform\npoorly in safety contexts, even falling short of basic approaches like\nBest-of-N Sampling.

To overcome this dilemma, we propose SAFFRON, a novel inference\nscaling paradigm tailored explicitly for safety assurance. Central to our\napproach is the introduction of a multifurcation reward model (MRM) that\nsignificantly reduces the required number of reward model evaluations.

To identify these\nheads efficiently, we design a training-free framework that quantifies\nhead-level visual relevance through targeted response analysis. Building on\nthis discovery, we introduce SparseMM, a KV-Cache optimization strategy that\nallocates asymmetric computation budgets to heads in LLMs based on their visual\nscores, leveraging the sparity of visual heads for accelerating the inference\nof MLLMs. Compared with prior KV-Cache acceleration methods that ignore the\nparticularity of visual, SparseMM prioritizes stress and retaining visual\nsemantics during decoding. Extensive evaluations across mainstream multimodal\nbenchmarks demonstrate that SparseMM achieves superior accuracy-efficiency\ntrade-offs.

Based on these theoretical\ninsights, we propose a modification to the Transformer architecture, in the\nform of an additional module that globally rewrites the KV cache at periodic\nintervals, shifting its capacity away from memorising input prefixes and toward\nencoding features most useful for predicting future tokens. Our model delivers\nsubstantial gains on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, outperforming both\nvanilla Transformers with up to 3.5x more parameters, as well as\nheuristic-driven pruning mechanisms for cache compression. Our approach can be\nseen as a principled generalisation of existing KV-cache compression methods;\nwhereas such methods focus solely on compressing input representations, they\noften do so at the expense of retaining predictive information, and thus their\ncapabilities are inherently bounded by those of an unconstrained model.

Prior work has attempted to mitigate this by caching and reusing\nfeatures within diffusion transformers across inference steps. These methods,\nhowever, often rely on rigid heuristics that result in limited acceleration or\npoor generalization across architectures. We propose Evolutionary Caching to\nAccelerate Diffusion models (ECAD), a genetic algorithm that learns efficient,\nper-model, caching schedules forming a Pareto frontier, using only a small set\nof calibration prompts. ECAD requires no modifications to network parameters or\nreference images. It offers significant inference speedups, enables\nfine-grained control over the quality-latency trade-off, and adapts seamlessly\nto different diffusion models. Notably, ECAD's learned schedules can generalize\neffectively to resolutions and model variants not seen during calibration. We\nevaluate ECAD on PixArt-alpha, PixArt-Sigma, and FLUX-1.dev using multiple\nmetrics (FID, CLIP, Image Reward) across diverse benchmarks (COCO, MJHQ-30k,\nPartiPrompts), demonstrating consistent improvements over previous approaches.\nOn PixArt-alpha, ECAD identifies a schedule that outperforms the previous\nstate-of-the-art method by 4.47 COCO FID while increasing inference speedup\nfrom 2.35x to 2.58x.

To address this challenge,\nwe propose Aug2Search, an EBR-based framework leveraging synthetic data\ngenerated by Generative AI (GenAI) models, in a multimodal and multitask\napproach to optimize query-product relevance. This paper investigates the\ncapabilities of GenAI, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), in generating\nhigh-quality synthetic data, and analyzing its impact on enhancing EBR models.\nWe conducted experiments using eight Llama models and 100 million data points\nfrom Facebook Marketplace logs. Our synthetic data generation follows three\nstrategies: (1) generate queries, (2) enhance product listings, and (3)\ngenerate queries from enhanced listings. We train EBR models on three different\ndatasets: sampled engagement data or original data ((e.g., \"Click\" and \"Listing\nInteractions\")), synthetic data, and a mixture of both engagement and synthetic\ndata to assess their performance across various training sets. Our findings\nunderscore the robustness of Llama models in producing synthetic queries and\nlistings with high coherence, relevance, and diversity, while maintaining low\nlevels of hallucination. Aug2Search achieves an improvement of up to 4% in\nROC_AUC with 100 million synthetic data samples, demonstrating the\neffectiveness of our approach.

This rules out scenarios where the central SMBH was ejected from\none of the nuclei in a gravitational recoil. Taken together, these results\nstrengthen the hypothesis that the object at the center of the $\\infty$ galaxy\nis a newly formed SMBH."

Prior\nstudies of language model memorization have struggled to disentangle\nmemorization from generalization. We formally separate memorization into two\ncomponents: unintended memorization, the information a model contains about a\nspecific dataset, and generalization, the information a model contains about\nthe true data-generation process.

RePCS compares two\ninference paths: (i) a parametric path using only the query, and (ii) a\nretrieval-augmented path using both the query and retrieved context by\ncomputing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between their output\ndistributions. A low divergence suggests that the retrieved context had minimal\nimpact, indicating potential memorization. This procedure is model-agnostic,\nrequires no gradient or internal state access, and adds only a single\nadditional forward pass. We further derive PAC-style guarantees that link the\nKL threshold to user-defined false positive and false negative rates. On the\nPrompt-WNQA benchmark, RePCS achieves a ROC-AUC of 0.918. This result\noutperforms the strongest prior method by 6.5 percentage points while keeping\nlatency overhead below 4.7% on an NVIDIA T4 GPU.

                "summary": "The rise of reinforcement learning (RL) in critical real-world applications\ndemands a fundamental rethinking of privacy in AI systems. Traditional privacy\nframeworks, designed to protect isolated data points, fall short for sequential\ndecision-making systems where sensitive information emerges from temporal\npatterns, behavioral strategies, and collaborative dynamics.

The conventional approaches to recover from failures are to either use\ncheckpointing, where periodically a copy of the entire model is sent to an\nadditional storage, or redundant computation. These approaches yield\nsignificant communication and/or computation overhead even in non-failure cases\nand scale poorly in settings with large models.

To address these challenges, we present FrontendBench, a benchmark\nco-developed by humans and LLMs. FrontendBench categorizes tasks based on code\nfunctionality and incorporates interactive test scenarios, enabling a more\ncomprehensive and practical evaluation of front-end code generation\ncapabilities. The benchmark comprises 148 meticulously crafted prompt-test case\npairs spanning five levels of web components, from basic UI elements to complex\ninteractive features. Each task reflects realistic front-end development\nchallenges. Furthermore, we introduce an automatic evaluation framework that\nexecutes generated code within a sandbox environment and assesses outcomes\nusing predefined test scripts. This framework achieves a 90.54% agreement rate\nwith expert human evaluations, demonstrating high reliability. We benchmark\nseveral state-of-the-art LLMs on FrontendBench and observe substantial\nperformance disparities in handling real-world front-end tasks. These results\nhighlight FrontendBench as a reliable and scalable benchmark, supporting\nconsistent multimodal evaluation and providing a robust foundation for future\nresearch in front-end code generation.

This paper introduces\nTargeted Lexical Injection (TLI), a novel and efficient fine-tuning approach.\nWe first demonstrate that Lugha-Llama-8B-wura, a Swahili-centric LLM, exhibits\nstrong, near-perfect lexical alignment for Swahili-English word pairs in its\nearly internal layers (specifically Layer 2, with ~0.99998 average cosine\nsimilarity based on a pilot study), a capability not fully reflected in its\nfinal output representations (baseline ~0.32 similarity on our evaluation set).\nTLI leverages this insight by using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and a\ncontrastive learning objective to fine-tune the model, specifically targeting\nembeddings from this empirically identified optimal early layer. Our\nexperiments show that TLI significantly improves the output-level lexical\nalignment for 623 trained Swahili-English word pairs, increasing average cosine\nsimilarity from 0.3211 to 0.4113 (+28.08%, p < 1.33 x 10^-240).

We conducted a\ncomprehensive quantitative evaluation of 16 LLMs using PsychBench, and\ninvestigated the impact of prompt design, chain-of-thought reasoning, input\ntext length, and domain-specific knowledge fine-tuning on model performance.\nThrough detailed error analysis, we identified strengths and potential\nlimitations of the existing models and suggested directions for improvement.\nSubsequently, a clinical reader study involving 60 psychiatrists of varying\nseniority was conducted to further explore the practical benefits of existing\nLLMs as supportive tools for psychiatrists of varying seniority. Through the\nquantitative and reader evaluation, we show that while existing models\ndemonstrate significant potential, they are not yet adequate as decision-making\ntools in psychiatric clinical practice. The reader study further indicates\nthat, as an auxiliary tool, LLM could provide particularly notable support for\njunior psychiatrists, effectively enhancing their work efficiency and overall\nclinical quality.

We conducted a\ncomprehensive quantitative evaluation of 16 LLMs using PsychBench, and\ninvestigated the impact of prompt design, chain-of-thought reasoning, input\ntext length, and domain-specific knowledge fine-tuning on model performance.\nThrough detailed error analysis, we identified strengths and potential\nlimitations of the existing models and suggested directions for improvement.\nSubsequently, a clinical reader study involving 60 psychiatrists of varying\nseniority was conducted to further explore the practical benefits of existing\nLLMs as supportive tools for psychiatrists of varying seniority. Through the\nquantitative and reader evaluation, we show that while existing models\ndemonstrate significant potential, they are not yet adequate as decision-making\ntools in psychiatric clinical practice. The reader study further indicates\nthat, as an auxiliary tool, LLM could provide particularly notable support for\njunior psychiatrists, effectively enhancing their work efficiency and overall\nclinical quality. To promote research in this area, we will make the dataset\nand evaluation framework publicly available, with the hope of advancing the\napplication of LLMs in psychiatric clinical settings."

Applying this method to clinical laboratory data, we achieve an\nimprovement up to 8% AUC for joint predictions of high uric acid, glucose,\ncholesterol, and low ferritin levels."

Addressing these issues requires\nfundamentally redesigned hardware-software integration. This paper introduces\nHuawei CloudMatrix, a next-generation AI datacenter architecture, realized in\nthe production-grade CloudMatrix384 supernode. It integrates 384 Ascend 910\nNPUs and 192 Kunpeng CPUs interconnected via an ultra-high-bandwidth Unified\nBus (UB) network, enabling direct all-to-all communication and dynamic pooling\nof resources. These features optimize performance for communication-intensive\noperations, such as large-scale MoE expert parallelism and distributed\nkey-value cache access. To fully leverage CloudMatrix384, we propose\nCloudMatrix-Infer, an advanced LLM serving solution incorporating three core\ninnovations: a peer-to-peer serving architecture that independently scales\nprefill, decode, and caching; a large-scale expert parallelism strategy\nsupporting EP320 via efficient UB-based token dispatch; and hardware-aware\noptimizations including specialized operators, microbatch-based pipelining, and\nINT8 quantization. Evaluation with the DeepSeek-R1 model shows\nCloudMatrix-Infer achieves state-of-the-art efficiency: prefill throughput of\n6,688 tokens/s per NPU and decode throughput of 1,943 tokens/s per NPU (<50 ms\nTPOT). It effectively balances throughput and latency, sustaining 538 tokens/s\nper NPU even under stringent 15 ms latency constraints, while INT8 quantization\nmaintains model accuracy across benchmarks.",

                "summary": "The recent development and wider accessibility of LLMs have spurred\ndiscussions about how they can be used in survey research, including\nclassifying open-ended survey responses. Due to their linguistic capacities, it\nis possible that LLMs are an efficient alternative to time-consuming manual\ncoding and the pre-training of supervised machine learning models. As most\nexisting research on this topic has focused on English-language responses\nrelating to non-complex topics or on single LLMs, it is unclear whether its\nfindings generalize and how the quality of these classifications compares to\nestablished methods. In this study, we investigate to what extent different\nLLMs can be used to code open-ended survey responses in other contexts, using\nGerman data on reasons for survey participation as an example. We compare\nseveral state-of-the-art LLMs and several prompting approaches, and evaluate\nthe LLMs' performance by using human expert codings. Overall performance\ndiffers greatly between LLMs, and only a fine-tuned LLM achieves satisfactory\nlevels of predictive performance. Performance differences between prompting\napproaches are conditional on the LLM used. Finally, LLMs' unequal\nclassification performance across different categories of reasons for survey\nparticipation results in different categorical distributions when not using\nfine-tuning. We discuss the implications of these findings, both for\nmethodological research on coding open-ended responses and for their\nsubstantive analysis, and for practitioners processing or substantively\nanalyzing such data.

                    "value": "The recent development and wider accessibility of LLMs have spurred\ndiscussions about how they can be used in survey research, including\nclassifying open-ended survey responses. Due to their linguistic capacities, it\nis possible that LLMs are an efficient alternative to time-consuming manual\ncoding and the pre-training of supervised machine learning models. As most\nexisting research on this topic has focused on English-language responses\nrelating to non-complex topics or on single LLMs, it is unclear whether its\nfindings generalize and how the quality of these classifications compares to\nestablished methods. In this study, we investigate to what extent different\nLLMs can be used to code open-ended survey responses in other contexts, using\nGerman data on reasons for survey participation as an example. We compare\nseveral state-of-the-art LLMs and several prompting approaches, and evaluate\nthe LLMs' performance by using human expert codings. Overall performance\ndiffers greatly between LLMs, and only a fine-tuned LLM achieves satisfactory\nlevels of predictive performance. Performance differences between prompting\napproaches are conditional on the LLM used. Finally, LLMs' unequal\nclassification performance across different categories of reasons for survey\nparticipation results in different categorical distributions when not using\nfine-tuning. We discuss the implications of these findings, both for\nmethodological research on coding open-ended responses and for their\nsubstantive analysis, and for practitioners processing or substantively\nanalyzing such data. Finally, we highlight the many trade-offs researchers need\nto consider when choosing automated methods for open-ended response\nclassification in the age of LLMs. In doing so, our study contributes to the\ngrowing body of research about the conditions under which LLMs can be\nefficiently, accurately, and reliably leveraged in survey research."

Existing face sketch synthesis research mainly relies on training\nwith numerous photo-sketch sample pairs from existing datasets. However, these\nlarge-scale discriminative learning methods will have to face problems such as\ndata scarcity and high human labor costs. Once the training data becomes\nscarce, their generative performance significantly degrades. In this paper, we\npropose a one-shot face sketch synthesis method based on diffusion models. We\noptimize text instructions on a diffusion model using face photo-sketch image\npairs. Then, the instructions derived through gradient-based optimization are\nused for inference. To simulate real-world scenarios more accurately and\nevaluate method effectiveness more comprehensively, we introduce a new\nbenchmark named One-shot Face Sketch Dataset (OS-Sketch). The benchmark\nconsists of 400 pairs of face photo-sketch images, including sketches with\ndifferent styles and photos with different backgrounds, ages, sexes,\nexpressions, illumination, etc. For a solid out-of-distribution evaluation, we\nselect only one pair of images for training at each time, with the rest used\nfor inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can\nconvert various photos into realistic and highly consistent sketches in a\none-shot context. Compared to other methods, our approach offers greater\nconvenience and broader applicability. The dataset will be available at:\nhttps://github.com/HanWu3125/OS-Sketch",

Recent\nreward-based optimization algorithms, such as Proximal Policy Optimization\n(PPO) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) have achieved significant\nperformance on reasoning tasks, whereas preference-based optimization\nalgorithms such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) significantly improve\nthe performance of LLMs on human alignment. However, despite the strong\nperformance of reward-based optimization methods in alignment tasks , they\nremain vulnerable to reward hacking. Furthermore, preference-based algorithms\n(such as Online DPO) haven't yet matched the performance of reward-based\noptimization algorithms (like PPO) on reasoning tasks, making their exploration\nin this specific area still a worthwhile pursuit. Motivated by these\nchallenges, we propose the Trust Region Preference Approximation (TRPA)\nalgorithm, which integrates rule-based optimization with preference-based\noptimization for reasoning tasks.

The\nevolutionary history and final fate of the three most luminous stars, R136a1,\nR136a2, and R136a3, has been a puzzling issue. We aim to resolve this by\nrotating single-star MESA models. We produce interpolated model grids and apply\na Markov-Chain Monte Carlo analysis to compare our models with observations.\nThe nature of supernova progenitors strongly depends on mass loss and the AM\ncoupling schemes. We predict no pair-instability and no GRB progenitors from\nour fiducial model grid at LMC metallicity. The onset of Wolf-Rayet-type\nmass-loss rates on the main sequence leads to a rapid decrease in stellar mass\nand luminosity.

Even though VMSs are only present in the youngest clusters below 2 Myr\nof age, our study strengthens their role in local and galaxy evolution.

We analyze \\numpaper{} relevant\npapers from the perspectives of both unit testing and LLMs. We first categorize\nexisting unit testing tasks that benefit from LLMs, e.g., test generation and\noracle generation.

Building\non this insight, we propose a novel training-free method, termed Low-Rank\nExtrapolation (LoX), to enhance safety robustness by extrapolating the safety\nsubspace of an aligned LLM. Our experimental results confirm the effectiveness\nof LoX, demonstrating significant improvements in robustness against both\nbenign and malicious fine-tuning attacks while preserving the model's\nadaptability to new tasks. For instance, LoX leads to 11% to 54% absolute\nreductions in attack success rates (ASR) facing benign or malicious fine-tuning\nattacks. By investigating the ASR landscape of parameters, we attribute the\nsuccess of LoX to that the extrapolation moves LLM parameters to a flatter\nzone, thereby less sensitive to perturbations.

Our experimental results confirm the effectiveness\nof LoX, demonstrating significant improvements in robustness against both\nbenign and malicious fine-tuning attacks while preserving the model's\nadaptability to new tasks. For instance, LoX leads to 11% to 54% absolute\nreductions in attack success rates (ASR) facing benign or malicious fine-tuning\nattacks. By investigating the ASR landscape of parameters, we attribute the\nsuccess of LoX to that the extrapolation moves LLM parameters to a flatter\nzone, thereby less sensitive to perturbations. The code is available at\ngithub.com/VITA-Group/LoX."

Accurate auto-segmentation of the tumor and surrounding\nnormal tissues is required for radiotherapy treatment plan optimization. Recent\nAI-based segmentation models are generally trained on large public datasets,\nwhich lack the heterogeneity of local patient populations. While these studies\nadvance AI-based medical image segmentation, research on local datasets is\nnecessary to develop and integrate AI tumor segmentation models directly into\nhospital software for efficient and accurate oncology treatment planning and\nexecution. This study enhances tumor segmentation using computationally\nefficient hybrid UNet-Transformer models on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\ndatasets acquired from a local hospital under strict privacy protection. We\ndeveloped a robust data pipeline for seamless DICOM extraction and\npreprocessing, followed by extensive image augmentation to ensure model\ngeneralization across diverse clinical settings, resulting in a total dataset\nof 6080 images for training. Our novel architecture integrates UNet-based\nconvolutional neural networks with a transformer bottleneck and complementary\nattention modules, including efficient attention, Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE)\nblocks, Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM), and ResNeXt blocks. To\naccelerate convergence and reduce computational demands, we used a maximum\nbatch size of 8 and initialized the encoder with pretrained ImageNet weights,\ntraining the model on dual NVIDIA T4 GPUs via checkpointing to overcome\nKaggle's runtime limits.

                    "value": "Cancer is an abnormal growth with potential to invade locally and metastasize\nto distant organs. Accurate auto-segmentation of the tumor and surrounding\nnormal tissues is required for radiotherapy treatment plan optimization. Recent\nAI-based segmentation models are generally trained on large public datasets,\nwhich lack the heterogeneity of local patient populations. While these studies\nadvance AI-based medical image segmentation, research on local datasets is\nnecessary to develop and integrate AI tumor segmentation models directly into\nhospital software for efficient and accurate oncology treatment planning and\nexecution. This study enhances tumor segmentation using computationally\nefficient hybrid UNet-Transformer models on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\ndatasets acquired from a local hospital under strict privacy protection. We\ndeveloped a robust data pipeline for seamless DICOM extraction and\npreprocessing, followed by extensive image augmentation to ensure model\ngeneralization across diverse clinical settings, resulting in a total dataset\nof 6080 images for training. Our novel architecture integrates UNet-based\nconvolutional neural networks with a transformer bottleneck and complementary\nattention modules, including efficient attention, Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE)\nblocks, Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM), and ResNeXt blocks. To\naccelerate convergence and reduce computational demands, we used a maximum\nbatch size of 8 and initialized the encoder with pretrained ImageNet weights,\ntraining the model on dual NVIDIA T4 GPUs via checkpointing to overcome\nKaggle's runtime limits. Quantitative evaluation on the local MRI dataset\nyielded a Dice similarity coefficient of 0.764 and an Intersection over Union\n(IoU) of 0.736, demonstrating competitive performance despite limited data and\nunderscoring the importance of site-specific model development for clinical\ndeployment."

Retrieval-augmented generation\n(RAG) mitigates this by integrating outside data sources. While previous RAG\nsystems used pre-assembled, fixed databases with limited flexibility, we have\ndeveloped Radiology RAG (RadioRAG), an end-to-end framework that retrieves data\nfrom authoritative radiologic online sources in real-time. We evaluate the\ndiagnostic accuracy of various LLMs when answering radiology-specific questions\nwith and without access to additional online information via RAG. Using 80\nquestions from the RSNA Case Collection across radiologic subspecialties and 24\nadditional expert-curated questions with reference standard answers, LLMs\n(GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4, Mistral-7B, Mixtral-8x7B, and Llama3 [8B and 70B]) were\nprompted with and without RadioRAG in a zero-shot inference scenario RadioRAG\nretrieved context-specific information from Radiopaedia in real-time. Accuracy\nwas investigated. Statistical analyses were performed using bootstrapping. The\nresults were further compared with human performance. RadioRAG improved\ndiagnostic accuracy across most LLMs, with relative accuracy increases ranging\nup to 54% for different LLMs. It matched or exceeded non-RAG models and the\nhuman radiologist in question answering across radiologic subspecialties,\nparticularly in breast imaging and emergency radiology. However, the degree of\nimprovement varied among models; GPT-3.5-turbo and Mixtral-8x7B-instruct-v0.1\nsaw notable gains, while Mistral-7B-instruct-v0.2 showed no improvement,\nhighlighting variability in RadioRAG's effectiveness. LLMs benefit when\nprovided access to domain-specific data beyond their training data.

Retrieval-augmented generation\n(RAG) mitigates this by integrating outside data sources. While previous RAG\nsystems used pre-assembled, fixed databases with limited flexibility, we have\ndeveloped Radiology RAG (RadioRAG), an end-to-end framework that retrieves data\nfrom authoritative radiologic online sources in real-time. We evaluate the\ndiagnostic accuracy of various LLMs when answering radiology-specific questions\nwith and without access to additional online information via RAG. Using 80\nquestions from the RSNA Case Collection across radiologic subspecialties and 24\nadditional expert-curated questions with reference standard answers, LLMs\n(GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4, Mistral-7B, Mixtral-8x7B, and Llama3 [8B and 70B]) were\nprompted with and without RadioRAG in a zero-shot inference scenario RadioRAG\nretrieved context-specific information from Radiopaedia in real-time. Accuracy\nwas investigated. Statistical analyses were performed using bootstrapping. The\nresults were further compared with human performance. RadioRAG improved\ndiagnostic accuracy across most LLMs, with relative accuracy increases ranging\nup to 54% for different LLMs. It matched or exceeded non-RAG models and the\nhuman radiologist in question answering across radiologic subspecialties,\nparticularly in breast imaging and emergency radiology. However, the degree of\nimprovement varied among models; GPT-3.5-turbo and Mixtral-8x7B-instruct-v0.1\nsaw notable gains, while Mistral-7B-instruct-v0.2 showed no improvement,\nhighlighting variability in RadioRAG's effectiveness. LLMs benefit when\nprovided access to domain-specific data beyond their training data. RadioRAG\nshows potential to improve LLM accuracy and factuality in radiology question\nanswering by integrating real-time domain-specific data."

To address this, we propose Context-INformed Grounding\nSupervision (CINGS), a post-training supervision in which the model is trained\nwith relevant context prepended to the response, while computing the loss only\nover the response tokens and masking out the context. Our experiments\ndemonstrate that models trained with CINGS exhibit stronger grounding in both\ntextual and visual domains compared to standard instruction-tuned models. In\nthe text domain, CINGS outperforms other training methods across 11\ninformation-seeking datasets and is complementary to inference-time grounding\ntechniques. In the vision-language domain, replacing a vision-language model's\nLLM backbone with a CINGS-trained model reduces hallucinations across four\nbenchmarks and maintains factual consistency throughout the generated response.\nThis improved grounding comes without degradation in general downstream\nperformance. Finally, we analyze the mechanism underlying the enhanced\ngrounding in CINGS and find that it induces a shift in the model's prior\nknowledge and behavior, implicitly encouraging greater reliance on the external\ncontext.",

This paper derives the beamdepth for a\ngeneralized uniform rectangular array (URA) and investigates how array geometry\ninfluences the near-field beamdepth and the limits where near-field\nbeamfocusing is achievable. To characterize the near-field boundary in terms of\nbeamfocusing and spatial multiplexing gains, we define the effective\nbeamfocusing Rayleigh distance (EBRD) for a generalized URA. Our analysis\nreveals that while a square URA achieves the narrowest beamdepth, the EBRD is\nmaximized for a wide or tall URA. However, despite its narrow beamdepth, a\nsquare URA may experience a reduction in multiuser sum rate due to its severely\nconstrained EBRD.

                "summary": "Modeling the wireless radiance field (WRF) is fundamental to modern\ncommunication systems, enabling key tasks such as localization, sensing, and\nchannel estimation. Traditional approaches, which rely on empirical formulas or\nphysical simulations, often suffer from limited accuracy or require strong\nscene priors. Recent neural radiance field (NeRF-based) methods improve\nreconstruction fidelity through differentiable volumetric rendering, but their\nreliance on computationally expensive multilayer perceptron (MLP) queries\nhinders real-time deployment. To overcome these challenges, we introduce\nGaussian splatting (GS) to the wireless domain, leveraging its efficiency in\nmodeling optical radiance fields to enable compact and accurate WRF\nreconstruction. Specifically, we propose SwiftWRF, a deformable 2D Gaussian\nsplatting framework that synthesizes WRF spectra at arbitrary positions under\nsingle-sided transceiver mobility. SwiftWRF employs CUDA-accelerated\nrasterization to render spectra at over 100000 fps and uses a lightweight MLP\nto model the deformation of 2D Gaussians, effectively capturing\nmobility-induced WRF variations. In addition to novel spectrum synthesis, the\nefficacy of SwiftWRF is further underscored in its applications in\nangle-of-arrival (AoA) and received signal strength indicator (RSSI)\nprediction. Experiments conducted on both real-world and synthetic indoor\nscenes demonstrate that SwiftWRF can reconstruct WRF spectra up to 500x faster\nthan existing state-of-the-art methods, while significantly enhancing its\nsignal quality.

                    "value": "Modeling the wireless radiance field (WRF) is fundamental to modern\ncommunication systems, enabling key tasks such as localization, sensing, and\nchannel estimation. Traditional approaches, which rely on empirical formulas or\nphysical simulations, often suffer from limited accuracy or require strong\nscene priors. Recent neural radiance field (NeRF-based) methods improve\nreconstruction fidelity through differentiable volumetric rendering, but their\nreliance on computationally expensive multilayer perceptron (MLP) queries\nhinders real-time deployment. To overcome these challenges, we introduce\nGaussian splatting (GS) to the wireless domain, leveraging its efficiency in\nmodeling optical radiance fields to enable compact and accurate WRF\nreconstruction. Specifically, we propose SwiftWRF, a deformable 2D Gaussian\nsplatting framework that synthesizes WRF spectra at arbitrary positions under\nsingle-sided transceiver mobility. SwiftWRF employs CUDA-accelerated\nrasterization to render spectra at over 100000 fps and uses a lightweight MLP\nto model the deformation of 2D Gaussians, effectively capturing\nmobility-induced WRF variations. In addition to novel spectrum synthesis, the\nefficacy of SwiftWRF is further underscored in its applications in\nangle-of-arrival (AoA) and received signal strength indicator (RSSI)\nprediction. Experiments conducted on both real-world and synthetic indoor\nscenes demonstrate that SwiftWRF can reconstruct WRF spectra up to 500x faster\nthan existing state-of-the-art methods, while significantly enhancing its\nsignal quality.

While Convolutional Neural Networks\n(CNNs) are widely used for medical image analysis, their computational\ncomplexity often hinders deployment in resource-constrained clinical settings.\nIn contrast, our approach combines Wavelet Transform with a compact MLP to\nachieve efficient and accurate stroke classification. Using the \"Brain Stroke\nMRI Images\" dataset, our method yields classification accuracies of 82.0% with\nthe \"db4\" wavelet (level 3 decomposition) and 86.00% with the \"Haar\" wavelet\n(level 2 decomposition). This analysis highlights a balance between diagnostic\naccuracy and computational efficiency, offering a practical solution for\nautomated stroke diagnosis.

While Convolutional Neural Networks\n(CNNs) are widely used for medical image analysis, their computational\ncomplexity often hinders deployment in resource-constrained clinical settings.\nIn contrast, our approach combines Wavelet Transform with a compact MLP to\nachieve efficient and accurate stroke classification. Using the \"Brain Stroke\nMRI Images\" dataset, our method yields classification accuracies of 82.0% with\nthe \"db4\" wavelet (level 3 decomposition) and 86.00% with the \"Haar\" wavelet\n(level 2 decomposition). This analysis highlights a balance between diagnostic\naccuracy and computational efficiency, offering a practical solution for\nautomated stroke diagnosis. Future research will focus on enhancing model\nrobustness and integrating additional MRI modalities for comprehensive stroke\nassessment."

The special place is taken by the Common Blood\nCount (CBC) test, as it is the most widely used clinical procedure. Combining\nroutine biochemical panels with CBC presents a set of test-value pairs that\nvaries from patient to patient, or, in common settings, a table with missing\nvalues.

Combining\nroutine biochemical panels with CBC presents a set of test-value pairs that\nvaries from patient to patient, or, in common settings, a table with missing\nvalues.

Addressing these issues requires\nfundamentally redesigned hardware-software integration. This paper introduces\nHuawei CloudMatrix, a next-generation AI datacenter architecture, realized in\nthe production-grade CloudMatrix384 supernode.

These features optimize performance for communication-intensive\noperations, such as large-scale MoE expert parallelism and distributed\nkey-value cache access. To fully leverage CloudMatrix384, we propose\nCloudMatrix-Infer, an advanced LLM serving solution incorporating three core\ninnovations: a peer-to-peer serving architecture that independently scales\nprefill, decode, and caching; a large-scale expert parallelism strategy\nsupporting EP320 via efficient UB-based token dispatch; and hardware-aware\noptimizations including specialized operators, microbatch-based pipelining, and\nINT8 quantization.

The proposed LSG scheme is\ncomposed of locally nested hierarchical graphs, at multiple layers of\nabstraction, with the abstract concepts grounded on the functionality of the\nintegrated FLIE planner. Furthermore, LSG encapsulates real-time semantic\nsegmentation models that offer extraction and localization of desired semantic\nelements within the hierarchical representation.

The experimental results reveal that even the most advanced\nmodels still generate hallucinated references, despite recent progress.\nMoreover, we observe that the performance of different models varies across\ndisciplines when it comes to writing literature reviews.

Measurements, conducted over a distance of 2 m from the first to the\nlast sensor, were compared with a laser tracker measurement to assess the\nsensor performance. The alignment reference generated by the Layer Beams\nexhibited a repeatability and reproducibility root-mean-square error (RMSE) of\nless than 30 ${\\mu}$m. The relative alignment precision for a known\ndisplacement was validated with a standard deviation of 4.3 ${\\mu}$m. The\nresults highlight the underlying sources of noise, which are induced mainly by\nthe cover glass, the protective film of the pixels, and the dark noise of the\nCMOS chips. Solutions to address these challenges are proposed. Additionally, a\nproof-of-concept for future development of a radiation-hard sensor utilizing\noptical fiber matrices is demonstrated. The RMSE of the reference position\ndetection introduced by the fiber matrix remained below 1.3 ${\\mu}$m. This\nwould allow the sensor to be used reliably in high-radiation environments\ntypical for accelerator facilities.

However, in video understanding with\nmultimodal large language models (LLMs), existing methods primarily rely on\nstatic features extracted from images sampled at a fixed low frame rate of\nframe-per-second (FPS) $\\leqslant$2, leading to critical visual information\nloss. In this paper, we introduce F-16, the first multimodal LLM designed for\nhigh-frame-rate video understanding. By increasing the frame rate to 16 FPS and\ncompressing visual tokens within each 1-second clip, F-16 efficiently captures\ndynamic visual features while preserving key semantic information. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that higher frame rates considerably enhance video\nunderstanding across multiple benchmarks, providing a new approach to improving\nvideo LLMs beyond scaling model size or training data. F-16 achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance among 7-billion-parameter video LLMs on both\ngeneral and fine-grained video understanding benchmarks, such as Video-MME and\nTemporalBench. Furthermore, F-16 excels in complex spatiotemporal tasks,\nincluding high-speed sports analysis (\\textit{e.g.}, basketball, football,\ngymnastics, and diving), outperforming SOTA proprietary visual models like\nGPT-4o and Gemini-1.5-pro. Additionally, we introduce a novel decoding method\nfor F-16 that enables highly efficient low-frame-rate inference without\nrequiring model retraining.

Additionally, large language models (LLMs)\nhave recently proven indispensable for many natural language processing tasks,\nincluding text classification, thanks to their ability to recognize complex\nlinguistic patterns and semantics. This study analyzes various proprietary and\nopen-source LLMs for a single-label, multi-class text classification task\nfocused on the SDGs. Then, it also evaluates the effectiveness of task\nadaptation techniques (i.e., in-context learning approaches), namely Zero-Shot\nand Few-Shot Learning, as well as Fine-Tuning within this domain. The results\nreveal that smaller models, when optimized through prompt engineering, can\nperform on par with larger models like OpenAI's GPT (Generative Pre-trained\nTransformer).",

Text classification models\nhave become vital tools in this area, automating the analysis of vast amounts\nof text from a variety of sources. Additionally, large language models (LLMs)\nhave recently proven indispensable for many natural language processing tasks,\nincluding text classification, thanks to their ability to recognize complex\nlinguistic patterns and semantics. This study analyzes various proprietary and\nopen-source LLMs for a single-label, multi-class text classification task\nfocused on the SDGs. Then, it also evaluates the effectiveness of task\nadaptation techniques (i.e., in-context learning approaches), namely Zero-Shot\nand Few-Shot Learning, as well as Fine-Tuning within this domain. The results\nreveal that smaller models, when optimized through prompt engineering, can\nperform on par with larger models like OpenAI's GPT (Generative Pre-trained\nTransformer)."

In this paper, we propose Generative Next POI Recommendation\nwith Semantic ID (GNPR-SID), an LLM-based POI recommendation model with a novel\nsemantic POI ID (SID) representation method that enhances the semantic\nunderstanding of POI modeling. There are two key components in our GNPR-SID:\n(1) a Semantic ID Construction module that generates semantically rich POI IDs\nbased on semantic and collaborative features, and (2) a Generative POI\nRecommendation module that fine-tunes LLMs to predict the next POI using these\nsemantic IDs. By incorporating user interaction patterns and POI semantic\nfeatures into the semantic ID generation, our method improves the\nrecommendation accuracy and generalization of the model. To construct\nsemantically related SIDs, we propose a POI quantization method based on\nresidual quantized variational autoencoder, which maps POIs into a discrete\nsemantic space. We also propose a diversity loss to ensure that SIDs are\nuniformly distributed across the semantic space. Extensive experiments on three\nbenchmark datasets demonstrate that GNPR-SID substantially outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 16% improvement in recommendation\naccuracy.",

                    "value": "Point-of-interest (POI) recommendation systems aim to predict the next\ndestinations of user based on their preferences and historical check-ins.\nExisting generative POI recommendation methods usually employ random numeric\nIDs for POIs, limiting the ability to model semantic relationships between\nsimilar locations. In this paper, we propose Generative Next POI Recommendation\nwith Semantic ID (GNPR-SID), an LLM-based POI recommendation model with a novel\nsemantic POI ID (SID) representation method that enhances the semantic\nunderstanding of POI modeling. There are two key components in our GNPR-SID:\n(1) a Semantic ID Construction module that generates semantically rich POI IDs\nbased on semantic and collaborative features, and (2) a Generative POI\nRecommendation module that fine-tunes LLMs to predict the next POI using these\nsemantic IDs. By incorporating user interaction patterns and POI semantic\nfeatures into the semantic ID generation, our method improves the\nrecommendation accuracy and generalization of the model. To construct\nsemantically related SIDs, we propose a POI quantization method based on\nresidual quantized variational autoencoder, which maps POIs into a discrete\nsemantic space. We also propose a diversity loss to ensure that SIDs are\nuniformly distributed across the semantic space. Extensive experiments on three\nbenchmark datasets demonstrate that GNPR-SID substantially outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 16% improvement in recommendation\naccuracy."

Moreover,\nthe identified task-specific heads are transferable across datasets and\nmitigate knowledge forgetting. Our work and findings provide a novel\nperspective on efficient LLM alignment. The code is available at\nhttps://github.com/VoiceBeer/ALPS."
