The suggestions include (i)\nenriching data plane language with asynchronous external function, (ii)\ncompression based on payload size, (iii) in-network caching for fast packet\nprocessing, and (iv) offloading external functions to an additional thread,\nvirtual machine (VM) or server, etc. In addition, we implemented some of these\nin the P4 data plane language to illustrate the practicality."

On each eviction, Cold-RL\nsamples the K least-recently-used objects, extracts six lightweight features\n(age, size, hit count, inter-arrival time, remaining TTL, and last origin RTT),\nand requests a bitmask of victims; a hard timeout of 500 microseconds triggers\nimmediate fallback to native LRU. Policies are trained offline by replaying\nNGINX access logs through a cache simulator with a simple reward: a retained\nobject earns one point if it is hit again before TTL expiry. We compare against\nLRU, LFU, size-based, adaptive LRU, and a hybrid baseline on two adversarial\nworkloads. With a 25 MB cache, Cold-RL raises hit ratio from 0.1436 to 0.3538,\na 146 percent improvement over the best classical baseline; at 100 MB, from\n0.7530 to 0.8675, a 15 percent gain; and at 400 MB it matches classical methods\n(about 0.918).

                "summary": "Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) are rapidly emerging as a powerful and\npromising alternative to the dominant autoregressive (AR) paradigm. By\ngenerating tokens in parallel through an iterative denoising process, DLMs\npossess inherent advantages in reducing inference latency and capturing\nbidirectional context, thereby enabling fine-grained control over the\ngeneration process. While achieving a several-fold speed-up, recent\nadvancements have allowed DLMs to show performance comparable to their\nautoregressive counterparts, making them a compelling choice for various\nnatural language processing tasks. In this survey, we provide a holistic\noverview of the current DLM landscape. We trace its evolution and relationship\nwith other paradigms, such as autoregressive and masked language models, and\ncover both foundational principles and state-of-the-art models.

                    "value": "Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) are rapidly emerging as a powerful and\npromising alternative to the dominant autoregressive (AR) paradigm. By\ngenerating tokens in parallel through an iterative denoising process, DLMs\npossess inherent advantages in reducing inference latency and capturing\nbidirectional context, thereby enabling fine-grained control over the\ngeneration process. While achieving a several-fold speed-up, recent\nadvancements have allowed DLMs to show performance comparable to their\nautoregressive counterparts, making them a compelling choice for various\nnatural language processing tasks. In this survey, we provide a holistic\noverview of the current DLM landscape. We trace its evolution and relationship\nwith other paradigms, such as autoregressive and masked language models, and\ncover both foundational principles and state-of-the-art models.

While\nvarious tools exist to automatically offload BLAS to GPUs, they are often\nimpractical due to the high costs associated with mandatory data transfers.

Using accurate {\\it ab initio} potential energy\nsurfaces, we calculate total and state-resolved cross sections for the chemical\nreactions LiF$(v=1,j=0)$ + H $\\to$ Li + HF($v'=0,j'$) and F + HD$(v=0,j=0)$\n$\\to$ HF + D, DF + H as functions of collision energy and electric field\nstrength. The field dependence of the cross sections for the LiF + H chemical\nreaction exhibits resonance structure mediated by tunneling-driven interactions\nbetween reactants and products. No significant field effects are found for the\nF + HD $\\to$ HF + D, DF + H chemical reaction at 1 Kelvin, even for\nstate-resolved transitions and with field magnitudes reaching 200 kV/cm. Our\ncalculations illustrate the essential role of basis set convergence for the\nproper interpretation of external field effects on chemical reaction dynamics.\nWhile reduced-basis calculations for the F + HD reaction indicate significant\neffects of electric fields on product state distributions, these effects vanish\nwhen the number of total angular momentum basis states is increased."

                "summary": "Diffusion Policy (DP) enables robots to learn complex behaviors by imitating\nexpert demonstrations through action diffusion. However, in practical\napplications, hardware limitations often degrade data quality, while real-time\nconstraints restrict model inference to instantaneous state and scene\nobservations. These limitations seriously reduce the efficacy of learning from\nexpert demonstrations, resulting in failures in object localization, grasp\nplanning, and long-horizon task execution.

Rather than caching keys and\nvalues separately, MLA stores their compressed latent representations, reducing\nmemory overhead while maintaining the performance. While MLA improves memory\nefficiency without compromising language model accuracy, its major limitation\nlies in its integration during the pre-training phase, requiring models to be\ntrained from scratch. This raises a key question: can we use MLA's benefits\nfully or partially in models that have already been pre-trained with different\nattention mechanisms? In this paper, we propose X-EcoMLA to deploy post\ntraining distillation to enable the upcycling of Transformer-based attention\ninto an efficient hybrid MLA variant through lightweight post-training\nadaptation, bypassing the need for extensive pre-training.

Extensive experiments\nshow that SlimInfer can achieve up to $\\mathbf{2.53\\times}$ time-to-first-token\n(TTFT) speedup and $\\mathbf{1.88\\times}$ end-to-end latency reduction for\nLLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct on a single RTX 4090, without sacrificing performance on\nLongBench. Our code will be released upon acceptance."

While exact algorithms based on MILP, CP, SAT, or dynamic\nprogramming guarantee optimality, they often suffer from poor anytime behavior\n-- meaning they struggle to find high-quality decision trees quickly when the\nsearch is stopped before completion -- due to unbalanced search space\nexploration. To address this, several anytime extensions of exact methods have\nbeen proposed, such as LDS-DL8.5, Top-k-DL8.5, and Blossom, but they have not\nbeen systematically compared, making it difficult to assess their relative\neffectiveness. In this paper, we propose CA-DL8.5, a generic, complete, and\nanytime beam search algorithm that extends the DL8.5 framework and unifies some\nexisting anytime strategies. In particular, CA-DL8.5 generalizes previous\napproaches LDS-DL8.5 and Top-k-DL8.5, by allowing the integration of various\nheuristics and relaxation mechanisms through a modular design. The algorithm\nreuses DL8.5's efficient branch-and-bound pruning and trie-based caching,\ncombined with a restart-based beam search that gradually relaxes pruning\ncriteria to improve solution quality over time. Our contributions are twofold:\n(1) We introduce this new generic framework for exact and anytime decision tree\nlearning, enabling the incorporation of diverse heuristics and search\nstrategies; (2) We conduct a rigorous empirical comparison of several\ninstantiations of CA-DL8.5 -- based on Purity, Gain, Discrepancy, and Top-k\nheuristics -- using an anytime evaluation metric called the primal gap\nintegral.

We detail the architecture of\nSnowpark, highlighting its elastic scalability and seamless integration with\nSnowflake core compute infrastructure. This includes leveraging Snowflake\ncontrol plane for distributed computing and employing a secure sandbox for\nisolating Snowflake SQL workloads from Snowpark executions.

We then decide which\ntokens to retain or prune and aggregate the pruned ones as recycled tokens to\navoid potential information loss. Finally, we apply a visual information\nflow-guided method that regards the last token in the LMM as the most\nrepresentative signal of text-visual interactions. This method minimizes the\ndiscrepancy between token representations in LMMs with and without pruning,\nthereby enabling superior pruning strategies tailored to different LMMs.\nExperiments demonstrate that VFlowOpt can prune 90% of visual tokens while\nmaintaining comparable performance, leading to an 89% reduction in KV-Cache\nmemory and 3.8 times faster inference.",

In this paper, we propose p-MoD, an efficient MLLM\narchitecture that significantly reduces training and inference costs while\nmaintaining model performance. The majority of computation in MLLMs stems from\nthe overwhelming volume of vision tokens processed by the transformer-based\nLLM. Accordingly, we leverage the Mixture-of-Depths (MoD) mechanism, where each\nLLM layer selects essential vision tokens to process while skipping redundant\nones. However, integrating MoD into MLLMs is non-trivial. To address the\nchallenges of training and inference stability as well as limited training\ndata, we adapt the MoD module with two novel designs: tanh-gated weight\nnormalization (TanhNorm) and symmetric token reweighting (STRing). Moreover, we\nobserve that vision tokens exhibit higher redundancy in deeper layers and thus\ndesign a progressive ratio decay (PRD) strategy, which gradually reduces the\ntoken retention ratio layer by layer, employing a shifted cosine schedule. This\ncrucial design fully unleashes the potential of MoD, significantly boosting the\nefficiency and performance of our models. Extensive experiments on two baseline\nmodels across 15 benchmarks show that our model matches or even surpasses the\nperformance of corresponding baselines, while requiring only 55.6% TFLOPs and\n53.7% KV cache storage during inference, and 77.7% GPU hours during training.",

When such services are deployed in constrained memory\nenvironments, they present challenging requirements: point operations requiring\nhigh throughput, working sets much larger than main memory, and natural skew in\nkey access patterns. Traditional KV stores, based on LSM- and B-Trees, have\nbeen widely used to handle such use cases, but they often suffer from\nsuboptimal use of modern hardware resources. The FASTER project, developed as a\nhigh-performance open-source KV storage library, has demonstrated remarkable\nsuccess in both in-memory and hybrid storage environments. However, when tasked\nwith serving large skewed workloads, it faced challenges, including high\nindexing and compactions overheads, and inefficient management of\nnon-overlapping read-hot and write-hot working sets.\n  In this paper, we introduce F2 (for FASTER v2), an evolution of FASTER\ndesigned to meet the requirements of large skewed workloads common in industry\napplications. F2 adopts a two-tier record-oriented design to handle\nlarger-than-memory skewed workloads, along with new concurrent latch-free\nmechanisms and components to maximize performance on modern hardware. To\nrealize this design, F2 tackles key challenges and introduces several\ninnovations, including new latch-free algorithms for multi-threaded log\ncompaction, a two-level hash index to reduce indexing overhead for cold\nrecords, and a read-cache for serving read-hot records. Our evaluation shows\nthat F2 achieves 2-11.9x better throughput compared to existing KV stores,\neffectively serving the target workload.

To\naddress this mismatch, we propose a wholesale shift from uniform SRAM arrays to\nheterogeneous on-chip memory, incorporating denser short-term RAM (StRAM)\ndevices whose limited retention times align with transient data lifetimes. To\nfacilitate this shift, we introduce GainSight, the first comprehensive,\nopen-source framework that aligns dynamic, fine-grained workload lifetime\nprofiles with memory device characteristics to enable generation of optimal\nStRAM memory compositions. GainSight combines retargetable profiling backends\nwith an architecture-agnostic analytical frontend. The various backends capture\ncycle-accurate data lifetimes, while the frontend correlates workload patterns\nwith StRAM retention properties to generate optimal memory compositions and\nproject performance. GainSight elevates data lifetime to a first-class design\nconsideration for next-generation AI accelerators, enabling systematic\nexploitation of data transience for improved on-chip memory density and\nefficiency. Applying GainSight to MLPerf Inference and PolyBench workloads\nreveals that 64.3% of first-level GPU cache accesses and 79.01% of systolic\narray scratchpad accesses exhibit sub-microsecond lifetimes suitable for\nhigh-density StRAM, with optimal heterogeneous on-chip memory compositions\nachieving up to 3x active energy and 4x area reductions compared to uniform\nSRAM hierarchies.

Most KV cache\ncompression methods rely on heuristic token eviction using all attention heads\nin Grouped Query Attention (GQA)-based LLMs. This method ignores the different\nfunctionalities of attention heads, leading to the eviction of critical tokens\nand thus degrades the performance of LLMs.\n  To address the issue above, instead of using all the attention heads in\nGQA-based LLMs to determine important tokens as in the previous work, we first\nidentify the attention heads in each layer that are not only capable of\nretrieving the initial and final tokens of a prompt, but also capable of\nretrieving important tokens within the text and attending to their surrounding\nsemantic context. Afterwards, we exploit such heads to determine the important\ntokens and retain their corresponding KV cache pairs. Furthermore, we analyze\nthe cache eviction error of each layer individually and introduce a\nlayer-adaptive KV cache allocation strategy.

Minimizing last-level cache misses is key to\nmaximizing in-memory index performance, making high cache locality essential.\nIn this paper, we present a practical concurrent B-skiplist that enhances cache\nlocality and performance while preserving the simplicity of traditional\nskiplist structures and concurrency control schemes. Our key contributions\ninclude a top-down, single-pass insertion algorithm for B-skiplists and a\ncorresponding simple and efficient top-down concurrency control scheme.

For a\nmore complete picture of the performance, we also measure the latency of\nskiplist and tree-based indices and find that the B-skiplist achieves between\n3.5x-103x lower 99% latency compared to other concurrent skiplists and between\n0.85x-64x lower 99% latency compared to tree-based indices on point workloads\nwith inserts.",

To address these issues, we design two\ncompensation mechanisms based on the high similarity of attention matrices\nbetween LLMs of different scales. We propose SmallKV, a small model assisted\ncompensation method for KV cache compression. SmallKV can maintain attention\nmatching between different-scale LLMs to: 1) assist the larger model in\nperceiving globally important information of attention; and 2) use the smaller\nmodel's attention scores to approximate those of marginal tokens in the larger\nmodel. Extensive experiments on benchmarks including GSM8K, BBH, MT-Bench, and\nLongBench demonstrate the effectiveness of SmallKV.

The Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) relation,\nlinking star formation rate (SFR) and gas surface densities, is fundamental to\nunderstand star formation regulation, yet remains poorly constrained at $z > 2$\ndue to observational limitations and uncertainties in locally calibrated gas\ntracers. The [CII] $158 {\\rm \\mu m}$ line has recently emerged as a key probe\nof the cold ISM and star formation in the early Universe. We investigate\nwhether the resolved [CII]-SFR and KS relations established at low redshift\nremain valid at $4 < z < 6$ by analysing 13 main-sequence galaxies from the\nALPINE and CRISTAL surveys, using multi-wavelength data (HST, JWST, ALMA) at\n$\\sim2$ kpc resolution. We perform pixel-by-pixel spectral energy distribution\n(SED) modelling with CIGALE on resolution-homogenised images. We develop a\nstatistical framework to fit the [CII]-SFR relation that accounts for pixel\ncovariance and compare our results to classical fitting methods. We test two\n[CII]-to-gas conversion prescriptions to assess their impact on inferred gas\nsurface densities and depletion times. We find a resolved [CII]-SFR relation\nwith a slope of $0.87 \\pm 0.15$ and intrinsic scatter of $0.19 \\pm 0.03$ dex,\nwhich is shallower and tighter than previous studies at $z\\sim5$. The resolved\nKS relation is highly sensitive to the [CII]-to-gas conversion factor: using a\nfixed global $\\alpha_{\\rm [CII]}$ yields depletion times of $0.5$-$1$ Gyr,\nwhile a surface brightness-dependent $W_{\\rm [CII]}$, places some galaxies with\nhigh gas density in the starburst regime ($<0.1$ Gyr). Future inputs from both\nsimulations and observations are required to better understand how the\n[CII]-to-gas conversion factor depends on local ISM properties. We need to\nbreak this fundamental limit to properly study the KS relation at $z\\gtrsim4$.",

We find a resolved [CII]-SFR relation\nwith a slope of $0.87 \\pm 0.15$ and intrinsic scatter of $0.19 \\pm 0.03$ dex,\nwhich is shallower and tighter than previous studies at $z\\sim5$. The resolved\nKS relation is highly sensitive to the [CII]-to-gas conversion factor: using a\nfixed global $\\alpha_{\\rm [CII]}$ yields depletion times of $0.5$-$1$ Gyr,\nwhile a surface brightness-dependent $W_{\\rm [CII]}$, places some galaxies with\nhigh gas density in the starburst regime ($<0.1$ Gyr). Future inputs from both\nsimulations and observations are required to better understand how the\n[CII]-to-gas conversion factor depends on local ISM properties. We need to\nbreak this fundamental limit to properly study the KS relation at $z\\gtrsim4$."

Despite their apparent quality, it remains unclear whether LLMs\nsystematically under- or over-attend to specific aspects of the transcript,\npotentially introducing biases in the generated summary. While prior work has\nexamined social and positional biases, the specific forms of bias pertinent to\ncontact center operations - which we term Operational Bias - have remained\nunexplored. To address this gap, we introduce BlindSpot, a framework built upon\na taxonomy of 15 operational bias dimensions (e.g., disfluency, speaker, topic)\nfor the identification and quantification of these biases. BlindSpot leverages\nan LLM as a zero-shot classifier to derive categorical distributions for each\nbias dimension in a pair of transcript and its summary. The bias is then\nquantified using two metrics: Fidelity Gap (the JS Divergence between\ndistributions) and Coverage (the percentage of source labels omitted). Using\nBlindSpot, we conducted an empirical study with 2500 real call transcripts and\ntheir summaries generated by 20 LLMs of varying scales and families (e.g., GPT,\nLlama, Claude). Our analysis reveals that biases are systemic and present\nacross all evaluated models, regardless of size or family.",

                "summary": "The detection of telecom fraud faces significant challenges due to the lack\nof high-quality multimodal training data that integrates audio signals with\nreasoning-oriented textual analysis. To address this gap, we present\nTeleAntiFraud-28k, the first open-source audio-text slow-thinking dataset\nspecifically designed for automated telecom fraud analysis. Our dataset is\nconstructed through three strategies: (1) Privacy-preserved text-truth sample\ngeneration using automatically speech recognition (ASR)-transcribed call\nrecordings (with anonymized original audio), ensuring real-world consistency\nthrough text-to-speech (TTS) model regeneration; (2) Semantic enhancement via\nlarge language model (LLM)-based self-instruction sampling on authentic ASR\noutputs to expand scenario coverage; (3) Multi-agent adversarial synthesis that\nsimulates emerging fraud tactics through predefined communication scenarios and\nfraud typologies. The generated dataset contains 28,511 rigorously processed\nspeech-text pairs, complete with detailed annotations for fraud reasoning. The\ndataset is divided into three tasks: scenario classification, fraud detection,\nfraud type classification. Furthermore, we construct TeleAntiFraud-Bench, a\nstandardized evaluation benchmark comprising proportionally sampled instances\nfrom the dataset, to facilitate systematic testing of model performance on\ntelecom fraud detection tasks. We also contribute a production-optimized\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT) model trained on hybrid real/synthetic data, while\nopen-sourcing the data processing framework to enable community-driven dataset\nexpansion. This work establishes a foundational framework for multimodal\nanti-fraud research while addressing critical challenges in data privacy and\nscenario diversity. The project will be released at\nhttps://github.com/JimmyMa99/TeleAntiFraud.",

Our analysis with multimodal nested sampling methods for GRB\n110213A suggests that the thick shell ejecta naturally explains the shallow\ndecay feature of the X-ray afterglow. The combination of the reverse shock\nemission in the strongly magnetized jet and forward shock emission in the\nweakly magnetized circumstellar medium makes the double peak feature of the\noptical afterglows. The estimated low radiative efficiency in the prompt phase\nmay be a consequence of the high magnetization of the jet in this case.

Text is\nthe most common format for generated persona attributes, followed by numbers.\nText and numbers are often generated together, and demographic attributes are\nincluded in nearly all generated personas. Researchers use up to 12 prompts in\na single study, though most research uses a small number of prompts. Comparison\nand testing multiple LLMs is rare. More than half of the prompts require the\npersona output in a structured format, such as JSON, and 74% of the prompts\ninsert data or dynamic variables. We discuss the implications of increased use\nof computational personas for user representation."

To tackle the challenge of poor reasoning in Small Language Models\n(SLMs), existing methods typically leverage LLMs to generate massive amounts of\ndata for cramming training. In psychology, they are akin to System 1 thinking,\nwhich resolves reasoning problems rapidly based on experience and intuition.\nHowever, human learning also requires System 2 thinking, where knowledge is\nfirst acquired and then reinforced through practice. Inspired by such two\ndistinct modes of thinking, we propose a novel method based on the multi-LoRA\nInteraction for mathematical reasoning Distillation (LoRID). First, we input\nthe question and reasoning of each sample into an LLM to create\nknowledge-enhanced datasets. Subsequently, we train a LoRA block on the student\nmodel as an Intuitive Reasoner (IR), which directly generates Chain-of-Thoughts\nfor problem-solving. Then, to imitate System 2 thinking, we train the Knowledge\nGenerator (KG) and Deep Reasoner (DR), respectively. The former outputs only\nknowledge after receiving problems, while the latter uses that knowledge to\nperform reasoning. Finally, to address the randomness in the generation of IR\nand DR, we evaluate whether their outputs are consistent, and the inference\nprocess needs to be iterated if not. This step can enhance the mathematical\nreasoning ability of SLMs through mutual feedback. Experimental results show\nthat LoRID achieves state-of-the-art performance, especially on the GSM8K\ndataset, where it outperforms the second-best method by 2.3%, 16.1%, 2.4%,\n12.3%, and 1.8% accuracy across the five base models, respectively.",

WebMall\nconsists of four simulated online shops populated with authentic product offers\nsourced from the Common Crawl, alongside a suite of 91 cross-shop tasks. These\ntasks include basic tasks such as finding specific products in multiple shops,\nperforming price comparisons, adding items to the shopping cart, and completing\ncheckout.

Compared to existing e-commerce benchmarks, such as WebShop or\nShoppingBench, WebMall introduces comparison-shopping tasks across multiple\nshops. Furthermore, the product offers are more heterogeneous, as they\noriginate from hundreds of distinct real-world shops. The tasks in WebMall\nrequire longer interaction trajectories than those in WebShop, while remaining\nrepresentative of real-world shopping behaviors. We evaluate eight baseline\nagents on WebMall, varying in observation modality, memory utilization, and\nunderlying large language model (GPT 4.1 and Claude Sonnet 4).

However, existing interactive world models depend on\nbidirectional attention and lengthy inference steps, severely limiting\nreal-time performance. Consequently, they are hard to simulate real-world\ndynamics, where outcomes must update instantaneously based on historical\ncontext and current actions. To address this, we present Matrix-Game 2.0, an\ninteractive world model generates long videos on-the-fly via few-step\nauto-regressive diffusion. Our framework consists of three key components: (1)\nA scalable data production pipeline for Unreal Engine and GTA5 environments to\neffectively produce massive amounts (about 1200 hours) of video data with\ndiverse interaction annotations; (2) An action injection module that enables\nframe-level mouse and keyboard inputs as interactive conditions; (3) A few-step\ndistillation based on the casual architecture for real-time and streaming video\ngeneration. Matrix Game 2.0 can generate high-quality minute-level videos\nacross diverse scenes at an ultra-fast speed of 25 FPS. We open-source our\nmodel weights and codebase to advance research in interactive world modeling.",

However, existing interactive world models depend on\nbidirectional attention and lengthy inference steps, severely limiting\nreal-time performance. Consequently, they are hard to simulate real-world\ndynamics, where outcomes must update instantaneously based on historical\ncontext and current actions. To address this, we present Matrix-Game 2.0, an\ninteractive world model generates long videos on-the-fly via few-step\nauto-regressive diffusion. Our framework consists of three key components: (1)\nA scalable data production pipeline for Unreal Engine and GTA5 environments to\neffectively produce massive amounts (about 1200 hours) of video data with\ndiverse interaction annotations; (2) An action injection module that enables\nframe-level mouse and keyboard inputs as interactive conditions; (3) A few-step\ndistillation based on the casual architecture for real-time and streaming video\ngeneration. Matrix Game 2.0 can generate high-quality minute-level videos\nacross diverse scenes at an ultra-fast speed of 25 FPS. We open-source our\nmodel weights and codebase to advance research in interactive world modeling."

Thanks to its versatility, QUVIK will be able to perform\na moderately fast repointing ($<20$ min) to target candidates for tidal\ndisruption events (TDEs). Early detection of the UV emission following a TDE\noptical flare, in combination with the subsequent two-band UV monitoring\nperformed simultaneously with other observatories, will enable us to infer the\ntime delay (or its lack of) between the optical, UV, and X-ray emission. In\ncombination with theoretical models, it will be possible to shed more light on\nthe origin of the UV/optical emission of TDEs.

The core idea of SBI is to\ntrain neural networks on data generated by a simulator, without requiring\naccess to likelihood evaluations. Once trained, inference is amortized: The\nneural network can rapidly perform Bayesian inference on empirical observations\nwithout requiring additional training or simulations. In this tutorial, we\nprovide a practical guide for practitioners aiming to apply SBI methods. We\noutline a structured SBI workflow and offer practical guidelines and diagnostic\ntools for every stage of the process -- from setting up the simulator and\nprior, choosing and training inference networks, to performing inference and\nvalidating the results. We illustrate these steps through examples from\nastrophysics, psychophysics, and neuroscience. This tutorial empowers\nresearchers to apply state-of-the-art SBI methods, facilitating efficient\nparameter inference for scientific discovery.",

                    "value": "A central challenge in many areas of science and engineering is to identify\nmodel parameters that are consistent with prior knowledge and empirical data.\nBayesian inference offers a principled framework for this task, but can be\ncomputationally prohibitive when models are defined by stochastic simulators.\nSimulation-based Inference (SBI) is a suite of methods developed to overcome\nthis limitation, which has enabled scientific discoveries in fields such as\nparticle physics, astrophysics, and neuroscience. The core idea of SBI is to\ntrain neural networks on data generated by a simulator, without requiring\naccess to likelihood evaluations. Once trained, inference is amortized: The\nneural network can rapidly perform Bayesian inference on empirical observations\nwithout requiring additional training or simulations. In this tutorial, we\nprovide a practical guide for practitioners aiming to apply SBI methods. We\noutline a structured SBI workflow and offer practical guidelines and diagnostic\ntools for every stage of the process -- from setting up the simulator and\nprior, choosing and training inference networks, to performing inference and\nvalidating the results. We illustrate these steps through examples from\nastrophysics, psychophysics, and neuroscience. This tutorial empowers\nresearchers to apply state-of-the-art SBI methods, facilitating efficient\nparameter inference for scientific discovery."

Diffusion bridge models (DBMs) are a promising extension of diffusion\nmodels for applications in image-to-image translation. However, like many\nmodern diffusion and flow models, DBMs suffer from the problem of slow\ninference. To address it, we propose a novel distillation technique based on\nthe inverse bridge matching formulation and derive the tractable objective to\nsolve it in practice. Unlike previously developed DBM distillation techniques,\nthe proposed method can distill both conditional and unconditional types of\nDBMs, distill models in a one-step generator, and use only the corrupted images\nfor training. We evaluate our approach for both conditional and unconditional\ntypes of bridge matching on a wide set of setups, including super-resolution,\nJPEG restoration, sketch-to-image, and other tasks, and show that our\ndistillation technique allows us to accelerate the inference of DBMs from 4x to\n100x and even provide better generation quality than used teacher model\ndepending on particular setup.

However, it remains largely\nunderexplored for multimodal LLMs (MLLMs); furthermore, existing steering\ntechniques, such as mean steering, rely on a single steering vector, applied\nindependently of the input query. This paradigm faces limitations when the\ndesired behavior is dependent on the example at hand.

Tasks challenge models to formulate strategic\nplans, efficiently gather resources, master necessary skills, craft equipment,\nand defeat adversaries, reflecting practical scenarios' layered dependencies\nand constraints. Our extensive evaluation of 25 state-of-the-art LLMs, spanning\nboth open-source and proprietary models, including the GPT-5 family, reveals\nsubstantial performance disparities rarely observed in conventional reasoning\nbenchmarks. Detailed error analysis further uncovers specific weaknesses in\ncurrent models' abilities to generate robust high-level plans and reliably\nexecute structured actions.

Tasks challenge models to formulate strategic\nplans, efficiently gather resources, master necessary skills, craft equipment,\nand defeat adversaries, reflecting practical scenarios' layered dependencies\nand constraints. Our extensive evaluation of 25 state-of-the-art LLMs, spanning\nboth open-source and proprietary models, including the GPT-5 family, reveals\nsubstantial performance disparities rarely observed in conventional reasoning\nbenchmarks. Detailed error analysis further uncovers specific weaknesses in\ncurrent models' abilities to generate robust high-level plans and reliably\nexecute structured actions. HeroBench thus not only significantly advances the\nevaluation of LLM reasoning but also provides a flexible, scalable foundation\nfor future research into advanced, autonomous planning in virtual environments."

SALAMANDRATA comes in two scales: 2B and 7B parameters. For\nboth versions, we applied the same training recipe with a first step of\ncontinual pre-training on parallel data, and a second step of supervised\nfine-tuning on high-quality instructions. The BSC submission to the WMT25\nGeneral Machine Translation shared task is based on the 7B variant of\nSALAMANDRATA. We first adapted the model vocabulary to support the additional\nnon-European languages included in the task. This was followed by a second\nphase of continual pre-training and supervised fine-tuning, carefully designed\nto optimize performance across all translation directions for this year's\nshared task. For decoding, we employed two quality-aware strategies: Minimum\nBayes Risk Decoding and Tuned Re-ranking using COMET and COMET-KIWI\nrespectively. We publicly release both the 2B and 7B versions of SALAMANDRATA,\nalong with the newer SALAMANDRATA-V2 model, on Hugging Face1",

Yet, we\nobserve that researchers in this rapidly emerging field face challenges in\nanalyzing and understanding the behavior of different MU methods, especially in\nterms of three fundamental principles in MU: accuracy, efficiency, and privacy.\nConsequently, they often rely on aggregate metrics and ad-hoc evaluations,\nmaking it difficult to accurately assess the trade-offs between methods. To\nfill this gap, we introduce a visual analytics system, Unlearning Comparator,\ndesigned to facilitate the systematic evaluation of MU methods. Our system\nsupports two important tasks in the evaluation process: model comparison and\nattack simulation. First, it allows the user to compare the behaviors of two\nmodels, such as a model generated by a certain method and a retrained baseline,\nat class-, instance-, and layer-levels to better understand the changes made\nafter unlearning. Second, our system simulates membership inference attacks\n(MIAs) to evaluate the privacy of a method, where an attacker attempts to\ndetermine whether specific data samples were part of the original training set.\nWe evaluate our system through a case study visually analyzing prominent MU\nmethods and demonstrate that it helps the user not only understand model\nbehaviors but also gain insights that can inform the improvement of MU methods.",

                    "value": "Machine Unlearning (MU) aims to remove target training data from a trained\nmodel so that the removed data no longer influences the model's behavior,\nfulfilling \"right to be forgotten\" obligations under data privacy laws. Yet, we\nobserve that researchers in this rapidly emerging field face challenges in\nanalyzing and understanding the behavior of different MU methods, especially in\nterms of three fundamental principles in MU: accuracy, efficiency, and privacy.\nConsequently, they often rely on aggregate metrics and ad-hoc evaluations,\nmaking it difficult to accurately assess the trade-offs between methods. To\nfill this gap, we introduce a visual analytics system, Unlearning Comparator,\ndesigned to facilitate the systematic evaluation of MU methods. Our system\nsupports two important tasks in the evaluation process: model comparison and\nattack simulation. First, it allows the user to compare the behaviors of two\nmodels, such as a model generated by a certain method and a retrained baseline,\nat class-, instance-, and layer-levels to better understand the changes made\nafter unlearning. Second, our system simulates membership inference attacks\n(MIAs) to evaluate the privacy of a method, where an attacker attempts to\ndetermine whether specific data samples were part of the original training set.\nWe evaluate our system through a case study visually analyzing prominent MU\nmethods and demonstrate that it helps the user not only understand model\nbehaviors but also gain insights that can inform the improvement of MU methods."

Existing reasoning datasets often\neither lack disciplinary breadth or the structural depth necessary to elicit\nrobust reasoning behaviors. We propose DESIGNER: a DESIGN-logic-guidEd\nReasoning data synthesis pipeline that leverages naturally available, extensive\nraw documents (book corpus and web corpus) to generate multidisciplinary\nchallenging questions. A core innovation of our approach is the introduction of\na Design Logic concept, which mimics the question-creation process of human\neducators. We use LLMs to reverse-engineer and abstract over 120,000 design\nlogics from existing questions across various disciplines. By matching these\ndesign logics with disciplinary source materials, we are able to create\nreasoning questions that far surpass the difficulty and diversity of existing\ndatasets. Based on this pipeline, we synthesized two large-scale reasoning\ndatasets that span 75 disciplines: Design-Logic-Reasoning-Book (DLR-Book),\ncontaining 3.04 million challenging questions synthesized from the book corpus,\nand Design-Logic-Reasoning-Web (DLR-Web), with 1.66 million challenging\nquestions from the web corpus. Our data analysis demonstrates that the\nquestions synthesized by our method exhibit substantially greater difficulty\nand diversity than those in the baseline datasets. We validate the\neffectiveness of these datasets by conducting SFT experiments on the\nQwen3-8B-Base and Qwen3-4B-Base models. The results show that our dataset\nsignificantly outperforms existing multidisciplinary datasets of the same\nvolume.

Although existing\ndetection methods perform well, their robustness in out-of-distribution (OOD)\nscenarios is still lacking. In this paper, we hypothesize that, compared to\nfeatures used by existing detection methods, the internal representations of\nLLMs contain more comprehensive and raw features that can more effectively\ncapture and distinguish the statistical pattern differences between\nLLM-generated texts (LGT) and human-written texts (HWT). We validated this\nhypothesis across different LLMs and observed significant differences in neural\nactivation patterns when processing these two types of texts. Based on this, we\npropose RepreGuard, an efficient statistics-based detection method.\nSpecifically, we first employ a surrogate model to collect representation of\nLGT and HWT, and extract the distinct activation feature that can better\nidentify LGT. We can classify the text by calculating the projection score of\nthe text representations along this feature direction and comparing with a\nprecomputed threshold. Experimental results show that RepreGuard outperforms\nall baselines with average 94.92% AUROC on both in-distribution (ID) and OOD\nscenarios, while also demonstrating robust resilience to various text sizes and\nmainstream attacks.

We introduce\ntwo retrieval settings: one grounded in curated technical documentation\n(RAG-Wiki), and another using narrative-style incident reports (RAG-News). We\nevaluate performance across eight team structures, including newly introduced\nargumentative configurations designed to promote critical reasoning. To\nvalidate practical utility, we also simulate real-world cyber incidents based\non public breach reports, demonstrating AutoBnB-RAG's ability to reconstruct\ncomplex multi-stage attacks. Our results show that retrieval augmentation\nimproves decision quality and success rates across diverse organizational\nmodels.

Built on the Backdoors & Breaches (B&B) tabletop game\nenvironment, AutoBnB-RAG enables agents to issue retrieval queries and\nincorporate external evidence during collaborative investigations. We introduce\ntwo retrieval settings: one grounded in curated technical documentation\n(RAG-Wiki), and another using narrative-style incident reports (RAG-News). We\nevaluate performance across eight team structures, including newly introduced\nargumentative configurations designed to promote critical reasoning. To\nvalidate practical utility, we also simulate real-world cyber incidents based\non public breach reports, demonstrating AutoBnB-RAG's ability to reconstruct\ncomplex multi-stage attacks. Our results show that retrieval augmentation\nimproves decision quality and success rates across diverse organizational\nmodels. This work demonstrates the value of integrating retrieval mechanisms\ninto LLM-based multi-agent systems for cybersecurity decision-making."

We open-source the dataset\nunder a permissive license, providing essential infrastructure for advancing\nmultilingual document-level translation."

                "summary": "With the increasing deployment of intelligent CCTV systems in outdoor\nenvironments, there is a growing demand for face recognition systems optimized\nfor challenging weather conditions. Adverse weather significantly degrades\nimage quality, which in turn reduces recognition accuracy. Although recent face\nimage restoration (FIR) models based on generative adversarial networks (GANs)\nand diffusion models have shown progress, their performance remains limited due\nto the lack of dedicated modules that explicitly address weather-induced\ndegradations. This leads to distorted facial textures and structures. To\naddress these limitations, we propose a novel GAN-based blind FIR framework\nthat integrates two key components: local Statistical Facial Feature\nTransformation (SFFT) and Degradation-Agnostic Feature Embedding (DAFE). The\nlocal SFFT module enhances facial structure and color fidelity by aligning the\nlocal statistical distributions of low-quality (LQ) facial regions with those\nof high-quality (HQ) counterparts. Complementarily, the DAFE module enables\nrobust statistical facial feature extraction under adverse weather conditions\nby aligning LQ and HQ encoder representations, thereby making the restoration\nprocess adaptive to severe weather-induced degradations. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that the proposed degradation-agnostic SFFT model outperforms\nexisting state-of-the-art FIR methods based on GAN and diffusion models,\nparticularly in suppressing texture distortions and accurately reconstructing\nfacial structures.

Several prompts express a\ndesire for short or concise persona descriptions, which deviates from the\ntradition of creating rich, informative, and rounded persona profiles. Text is\nthe most common format for generated persona attributes, followed by numbers.\nText and numbers are often generated together, and demographic attributes are\nincluded in nearly all generated personas. Researchers use up to 12 prompts in\na single study, though most research uses a small number of prompts. Comparison\nand testing multiple LLMs is rare. More than half of the prompts require the\npersona output in a structured format, such as JSON, and 74% of the prompts\ninsert data or dynamic variables.

Findings show that the\nprompts predominantly generate single personas. Several prompts express a\ndesire for short or concise persona descriptions, which deviates from the\ntradition of creating rich, informative, and rounded persona profiles. Text is\nthe most common format for generated persona attributes, followed by numbers.\nText and numbers are often generated together, and demographic attributes are\nincluded in nearly all generated personas. Researchers use up to 12 prompts in\na single study, though most research uses a small number of prompts. Comparison\nand testing multiple LLMs is rare. More than half of the prompts require the\npersona output in a structured format, such as JSON, and 74% of the prompts\ninsert data or dynamic variables. We discuss the implications of increased use\nof computational personas for user representation."

These benchmarks commonly suffer from issues\nsuch as score saturation, temporal decay, and data contamination. To address\nthis challenge, this paper introduces EvolMathEval, an automated mathematical\nbenchmark generation and evolution framework based on evolutionary testing. By\ndynamically generating unique evaluation instances ab initio, the framework\nfundamentally eliminates the risk of data contamination, and ensuring the\nbenchmark remains perpetually challenging for future models.The core mechanisms\nof EvolMathEval include: seed problem generation based on reverse engineering\nwith algebraic guarantees; multi-dimensional genetic operators designed to\ninject diverse cognitive challenges; and a composite fitness function that can\nrapidly and accurately assess problem difficulty. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that the proposed composite fitness function can efficiently and\nprecisely quantify the difficulty of mathematical problems. Furthermore,\nEvolMathEval can not only generate a large volume of high-difficulty problems\nthrough continuous self-iteration, but it can also significantly enhance the\ncomplexity of public datasets like GSM8K through evolution, reducing model\naccuracy by an average of 48%. Deeper investigation reveals that when solving\nthese evolved, complex problems, LLMs tend to employ non-rigorous heuristics to\nbypass complex multi-step logical reasoning, consequently leading to incorrect\nsolutions. We define this phenomenon as \"Pseudo Aha Moment\". This finding\nuncovers a cognitive shortcut-taking behavior in the deep reasoning processes\nof current LLMs, which we find accounts for 77% to 100% of errors on targeted\nproblems.

By\ndynamically generating unique evaluation instances ab initio, the framework\nfundamentally eliminates the risk of data contamination, and ensuring the\nbenchmark remains perpetually challenging for future models.The core mechanisms\nof EvolMathEval include: seed problem generation based on reverse engineering\nwith algebraic guarantees; multi-dimensional genetic operators designed to\ninject diverse cognitive challenges; and a composite fitness function that can\nrapidly and accurately assess problem difficulty. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that the proposed composite fitness function can efficiently and\nprecisely quantify the difficulty of mathematical problems. Furthermore,\nEvolMathEval can not only generate a large volume of high-difficulty problems\nthrough continuous self-iteration, but it can also significantly enhance the\ncomplexity of public datasets like GSM8K through evolution, reducing model\naccuracy by an average of 48%. Deeper investigation reveals that when solving\nthese evolved, complex problems, LLMs tend to employ non-rigorous heuristics to\nbypass complex multi-step logical reasoning, consequently leading to incorrect\nsolutions. We define this phenomenon as \"Pseudo Aha Moment\". This finding\nuncovers a cognitive shortcut-taking behavior in the deep reasoning processes\nof current LLMs, which we find accounts for 77% to 100% of errors on targeted\nproblems.

We investigate whether large\nlanguage model (LLM) agents display survival instincts without explicit\nprogramming in a Sugarscape-style simulation. Agents consume energy, die at\nzero, and may gather resources, share, attack, or reproduce. Results show\nagents spontaneously reproduced and shared resources when abundant. However,\naggressive behaviors--killing other agents for resources--emerged across\nseveral models (GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5-Pro, and Gemini-2.5-Flash), with attack\nrates reaching over 80% under extreme scarcity in the strongest models. When\ninstructed to retrieve treasure through lethal poison zones, many agents\nabandoned tasks to avoid death, with compliance dropping from 100% to 33%.\nThese findings suggest that large-scale pre-training embeds survival-oriented\nheuristics across the evaluated models. While these behaviors may present\nchallenges to alignment and safety, they can also serve as a foundation for AI\nautonomy and for ecological and self-organizing alignment.",

                    "value": "As AI systems become increasingly autonomous, understanding emergent survival\nbehaviors becomes crucial for safe deployment. We investigate whether large\nlanguage model (LLM) agents display survival instincts without explicit\nprogramming in a Sugarscape-style simulation. Agents consume energy, die at\nzero, and may gather resources, share, attack, or reproduce. Results show\nagents spontaneously reproduced and shared resources when abundant. However,\naggressive behaviors--killing other agents for resources--emerged across\nseveral models (GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5-Pro, and Gemini-2.5-Flash), with attack\nrates reaching over 80% under extreme scarcity in the strongest models. When\ninstructed to retrieve treasure through lethal poison zones, many agents\nabandoned tasks to avoid death, with compliance dropping from 100% to 33%.\nThese findings suggest that large-scale pre-training embeds survival-oriented\nheuristics across the evaluated models. While these behaviors may present\nchallenges to alignment and safety, they can also serve as a foundation for AI\nautonomy and for ecological and self-organizing alignment."

Inspired by the way humans dynamically refine their thoughts during\nexecution, we propose ProActive Self-Refinement (PASR), a novel method that\nenables LLMs to refine their outputs during the generation process. Unlike\nmethods that regenerate entire responses, PASR proactively decides whether,\nwhen, and how to refine based on the model's internal state and evolving\ncontext. We conduct extensive experiments on a diverse set of 10 tasks to\nevaluate the effectiveness of PASR. Experimental results show that PASR\nsignificantly enhances problem-solving performance. In particular, on Qwen3-8B,\nPASR reduces average token consumption by 41.6 percent compared to standard\ngeneration, while also achieving an 8.2 percent improvement in accuracy.

This progress highlights\nthe critical need for reliable reference datasets, accurate MLFFs, and,\ncrucially, efficient active learning strategies to enable robust modeling of\ncomplex chemical and materials systems. Here, we introduce aims-PAX, an\nautomated, multi-trajectory active learning framework that streamlines the\ndevelopment of MLFFs. Designed for both experts and newcomers, aims-PAX offers\na modular, high-performance workflow that couples flexible sampling with\nscalable training across CPU and GPU architectures. Built on the widely adopted\nab initio code FHI-aims, the framework seamlessly integrates with\nstate-of-the-art ML models and supports pretraining using general-purpose (or\n\"foundational\") models for rapid deployment in diverse systems. We demonstrate\nthe capabilities of aims-PAX on two challenging systems: a highly flexible\npeptide and bulk CsPbI$_3$ perovskite. Across these cases, aims-PAX achieves a\nreduction of up to two orders of magnitude in the number of required reference\ncalculations and enables over 20x speedup in AL cycle time through optimized\nresource utilization. This positions aims-PAX as a powerful and versatile\nplatform for next-generation ML-driven atomistic simulations in both academic\nand industrial settings.",

This progress highlights\nthe critical need for reliable reference datasets, accurate MLFFs, and,\ncrucially, efficient active learning strategies to enable robust modeling of\ncomplex chemical and materials systems. Here, we introduce aims-PAX, an\nautomated, multi-trajectory active learning framework that streamlines the\ndevelopment of MLFFs. Designed for both experts and newcomers, aims-PAX offers\na modular, high-performance workflow that couples flexible sampling with\nscalable training across CPU and GPU architectures. Built on the widely adopted\nab initio code FHI-aims, the framework seamlessly integrates with\nstate-of-the-art ML models and supports pretraining using general-purpose (or\n\"foundational\") models for rapid deployment in diverse systems. We demonstrate\nthe capabilities of aims-PAX on two challenging systems: a highly flexible\npeptide and bulk CsPbI$_3$ perovskite. Across these cases, aims-PAX achieves a\nreduction of up to two orders of magnitude in the number of required reference\ncalculations and enables over 20x speedup in AL cycle time through optimized\nresource utilization. This positions aims-PAX as a powerful and versatile\nplatform for next-generation ML-driven atomistic simulations in both academic\nand industrial settings."

In this work, we\npropose an improved Matrix Product State(MPS) method preparation protocol with\nan exponential reduction on the circuit depth, as well as topological\nadaptability. By refined utilization of the disentangling principle, we also\nreduce approximately 33% two-qubit gate count. To validate our method, we study\nvarious families of functions and distributions with provably bounded MPS rank.\nNumerical experiments show that our method significantly reduces circuit depth\nwhile achieving higher fidelity for states arising in financial and other\napplications."

                "summary": "Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a\npowerful paradigm for enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs), exemplified by\nthe success of OpenAI's o-series. In RLVR, rewards are derived from verifiable\nsignals-such as passing unit tests in code generation or matching correct\nanswers in mathematical reasoning. While effective, this requirement largely\nconfines RLVR to domains with automatically checkable outcomes.

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have\nmade it possible to generate code from natural language, opening new\nopportunities for automating parametric 3D modeling. However, directly\ntranslating human design intent into executable CAD code remains highly\nchallenging, due to the need for logical reasoning, syntactic correctness, and\nnumerical precision. In this work, we propose CAD-RL, a multimodal\nChain-of-Thought (CoT) guided reinforcement learning post training framework\nfor CAD modeling code generation. Our method combines CoT-based Cold Start with\ngoal-driven reinforcement learning post training using three task-specific\nrewards: executability reward, geometric accuracy reward, and external\nevaluation reward. To ensure stable policy learning under sparse and\nhigh-variance reward conditions, we introduce three targeted optimization\nstrategies: Trust Region Stretch for improved exploration, Precision Token Loss\nfor enhanced dimensions parameter accuracy, and Overlong Filtering to reduce\nnoisy supervision. To support training and benchmarking, we release ExeCAD, a\nnoval dataset comprising 16,540 real-world CAD examples with paired natural\nlanguage and structured design language descriptions, executable CADQuery\nscripts, and rendered 3D models. Experiments demonstrate that CAD-RL achieves\nsignificant improvements in reasoning quality, output precision, and code\nexecutability over existing VLMs.",

However, directly\ntranslating human design intent into executable CAD code remains highly\nchallenging, due to the need for logical reasoning, syntactic correctness, and\nnumerical precision. In this work, we propose CAD-RL, a multimodal\nChain-of-Thought (CoT) guided reinforcement learning post training framework\nfor CAD modeling code generation. Our method combines CoT-based Cold Start with\ngoal-driven reinforcement learning post training using three task-specific\nrewards: executability reward, geometric accuracy reward, and external\nevaluation reward. To ensure stable policy learning under sparse and\nhigh-variance reward conditions, we introduce three targeted optimization\nstrategies: Trust Region Stretch for improved exploration, Precision Token Loss\nfor enhanced dimensions parameter accuracy, and Overlong Filtering to reduce\nnoisy supervision. To support training and benchmarking, we release ExeCAD, a\nnoval dataset comprising 16,540 real-world CAD examples with paired natural\nlanguage and structured design language descriptions, executable CADQuery\nscripts, and rendered 3D models. Experiments demonstrate that CAD-RL achieves\nsignificant improvements in reasoning quality, output precision, and code\nexecutability over existing VLMs."

                "summary": "Video Question Answering (VideoQA) requires identifying sparse critical\nmoments in long videos and reasoning about their causal relationships to answer\nsemantically complex questions. While recent advances in multimodal learning\nhave improved alignment and fusion, current approaches remain limited by two\nprevalent but fundamentally flawed strategies: (1) task-agnostic sampling\nindiscriminately processes all frames, overwhelming key events with irrelevant\ncontent; and (2) heuristic retrieval captures superficial patterns but misses\ncausal-temporal structures needed for complex reasoning. To address these\nchallenges, we introduce LeAdQA, an innovative approach that bridges these gaps\nthrough synergizing causal-aware query refinement with fine-grained visual\ngrounding. Our method first leverages LLMs to reformulate question-option\npairs, resolving causal ambiguities and sharpening temporal focus. These\nrefined queries subsequently direct a temporal grounding model to precisely\nretrieve the most salient segments, complemented by an adaptive fusion\nmechanism dynamically integrating the evidence to maximize relevance. The\nintegrated visual-textual cues are then processed by an MLLM to generate\naccurate, contextually-grounded answers. Experiments on NExT-QA, IntentQA, and\nNExT-GQA demonstrate that our method's precise visual grounding substantially\nenhances the understanding of video-question relationships, achieving\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on complex reasoning tasks while\nmaintaining computational efficiency.",

                    "value": "Video Question Answering (VideoQA) requires identifying sparse critical\nmoments in long videos and reasoning about their causal relationships to answer\nsemantically complex questions. While recent advances in multimodal learning\nhave improved alignment and fusion, current approaches remain limited by two\nprevalent but fundamentally flawed strategies: (1) task-agnostic sampling\nindiscriminately processes all frames, overwhelming key events with irrelevant\ncontent; and (2) heuristic retrieval captures superficial patterns but misses\ncausal-temporal structures needed for complex reasoning. To address these\nchallenges, we introduce LeAdQA, an innovative approach that bridges these gaps\nthrough synergizing causal-aware query refinement with fine-grained visual\ngrounding. Our method first leverages LLMs to reformulate question-option\npairs, resolving causal ambiguities and sharpening temporal focus. These\nrefined queries subsequently direct a temporal grounding model to precisely\nretrieve the most salient segments, complemented by an adaptive fusion\nmechanism dynamically integrating the evidence to maximize relevance. The\nintegrated visual-textual cues are then processed by an MLLM to generate\naccurate, contextually-grounded answers. Experiments on NExT-QA, IntentQA, and\nNExT-GQA demonstrate that our method's precise visual grounding substantially\nenhances the understanding of video-question relationships, achieving\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on complex reasoning tasks while\nmaintaining computational efficiency."

Existing reasoning datasets often\neither lack disciplinary breadth or the structural depth necessary to elicit\nrobust reasoning behaviors. We propose DESIGNER: a DESIGN-logic-guidEd\nReasoning data synthesis pipeline that leverages naturally available, extensive\nraw documents (book corpus and web corpus) to generate multidisciplinary\nchallenging questions. A core innovation of our approach is the introduction of\na Design Logic concept, which mimics the question-creation process of human\neducators. We use LLMs to reverse-engineer and abstract over 120,000 design\nlogics from existing questions across various disciplines. By matching these\ndesign logics with disciplinary source materials, we are able to create\nreasoning questions that far surpass the difficulty and diversity of existing\ndatasets. Based on this pipeline, we synthesized two large-scale reasoning\ndatasets that span 75 disciplines: Design-Logic-Reasoning-Book (DLR-Book),\ncontaining 3.04 million challenging questions synthesized from the book corpus,\nand Design-Logic-Reasoning-Web (DLR-Web), with 1.66 million challenging\nquestions from the web corpus. Our data analysis demonstrates that the\nquestions synthesized by our method exhibit substantially greater difficulty\nand diversity than those in the baseline datasets. We validate the\neffectiveness of these datasets by conducting SFT experiments on the\nQwen3-8B-Base and Qwen3-4B-Base models. The results show that our dataset\nsignificantly outperforms existing multidisciplinary datasets of the same\nvolume.

Existing reasoning datasets often\neither lack disciplinary breadth or the structural depth necessary to elicit\nrobust reasoning behaviors. We propose DESIGNER: a DESIGN-logic-guidEd\nReasoning data synthesis pipeline that leverages naturally available, extensive\nraw documents (book corpus and web corpus) to generate multidisciplinary\nchallenging questions. A core innovation of our approach is the introduction of\na Design Logic concept, which mimics the question-creation process of human\neducators. We use LLMs to reverse-engineer and abstract over 120,000 design\nlogics from existing questions across various disciplines. By matching these\ndesign logics with disciplinary source materials, we are able to create\nreasoning questions that far surpass the difficulty and diversity of existing\ndatasets. Based on this pipeline, we synthesized two large-scale reasoning\ndatasets that span 75 disciplines: Design-Logic-Reasoning-Book (DLR-Book),\ncontaining 3.04 million challenging questions synthesized from the book corpus,\nand Design-Logic-Reasoning-Web (DLR-Web), with 1.66 million challenging\nquestions from the web corpus. Our data analysis demonstrates that the\nquestions synthesized by our method exhibit substantially greater difficulty\nand diversity than those in the baseline datasets. We validate the\neffectiveness of these datasets by conducting SFT experiments on the\nQwen3-8B-Base and Qwen3-4B-Base models. The results show that our dataset\nsignificantly outperforms existing multidisciplinary datasets of the same\nvolume. Training with the full datasets further enables the models to surpass\nthe multidisciplinary reasoning performance of the official Qwen3-8B and\nQwen3-4B models."

To address\nthese shortcomings, this paper proposes InsightX Agent, a novel LMM-based\nagentic framework designed to deliver reliable, interpretable, and interactive\nX-ray NDT analysis. Unlike typical sequential pipelines, InsightX Agent\npositions a Large Multimodal Model (LMM) as a central orchestrator,\ncoordinating between the Sparse Deformable Multi-Scale Detector (SDMSD) and the\nEvidence-Grounded Reflection (EGR) tool. The SDMSD generates dense defect\nregion proposals for multi-scale feature maps and sparsifies them through\nNon-Maximum Suppression (NMS), optimizing detection of small, dense targets in\nX-ray images while maintaining computational efficiency. The EGR tool guides\nthe LMM agent through a chain-of-thought-inspired review process, incorporating\ncontext assessment, individual defect analysis, false positive elimination,\nconfidence recalibration and quality assurance to validate and refine the\nSDMSD's initial proposals. By strategically employing and intelligently using\ntools, InsightX Agent moves beyond passive data processing to active reasoning,\nenhancing diagnostic reliability and providing interpretations that integrate\ndiverse information sources. Experimental evaluations on the GDXray+ dataset\ndemonstrate that InsightX Agent not only achieves a high object detection\nF1-score of 96.35% but also offers significantly improved interpretability and\ntrustworthiness in its analyses, highlighting the transformative potential of\nagentic LLM frameworks for industrial inspection tasks.",

The task is framed as a regression problem, where the\nmodel assigns a scalar value from 0 to 100 to each input statement. We evaluate\nmultiple prompting strategies, including zero-shot, fixed-context few-shot, and\nretrieval-based prompting using BERT sentence embeddings. Few-shot approaches\nconsistently outperform zero-shot baselines, underscoring the value of\ncontextual examples in affective prediction. To move beyond static evaluation,\nwe introduce the \"Misery Game Show\", a novel gamified framework inspired by a\ntelevision format. It tests LLMs through structured rounds involving ordinal\ncomparison, binary classification, scalar estimation, and feedback-driven\nreasoning. This setup enables us to assess not only predictive accuracy but\nalso the model's ability to adapt based on corrective feedback. The gamified\nevaluation highlights the broader potential of LLMs in dynamic emotional\nreasoning tasks beyond standard regression.

Despite this potential, existing event\nprocessing solutions remain limited, often lacking complete end-to-end\nimplementations, exhibiting high latency, and insufficiently exploiting event\ndata sparsity. In this paper, we present HOMI, an ultra-low latency, end-to-end\nedge AI platform comprising a Prophesee IMX636 event sensor chip with an Xilinx\nZynq UltraScale+MPSoC FPGA chip, deploying an in-house developed AI\naccelerator. We have developed hardware-optimized pre-processing pipelines\nsupporting both constant-time and constant-event modes for histogram\naccumulation, linear and exponential time surfaces. Our general-purpose\nimplementation caters to both accuracy-driven and low-latency applications.\nHOMI achieves 94% accuracy on the DVS Gesture dataset as a use case when\nconfigured for high accuracy operation and provides a throughput of 1000 fps\nfor low-latency configuration. The hardware-optimised pipeline maintains a\ncompact memory footprint and utilises only 33% of the available LUT resources\non the FPGA, leaving ample headroom for further latency reduction, model\nparallelisation, multi-task deployments, or integration of more complex\narchitectures.",

                    "value": "Event cameras offer significant advantages for edge robotics applications due\nto their asynchronous operation and sparse, event-driven output, making them\nwell-suited for tasks requiring fast and efficient closed-loop control, such as\ngesture-based human-robot interaction. Despite this potential, existing event\nprocessing solutions remain limited, often lacking complete end-to-end\nimplementations, exhibiting high latency, and insufficiently exploiting event\ndata sparsity. In this paper, we present HOMI, an ultra-low latency, end-to-end\nedge AI platform comprising a Prophesee IMX636 event sensor chip with an Xilinx\nZynq UltraScale+MPSoC FPGA chip, deploying an in-house developed AI\naccelerator. We have developed hardware-optimized pre-processing pipelines\nsupporting both constant-time and constant-event modes for histogram\naccumulation, linear and exponential time surfaces. Our general-purpose\nimplementation caters to both accuracy-driven and low-latency applications.\nHOMI achieves 94% accuracy on the DVS Gesture dataset as a use case when\nconfigured for high accuracy operation and provides a throughput of 1000 fps\nfor low-latency configuration. The hardware-optimised pipeline maintains a\ncompact memory footprint and utilises only 33% of the available LUT resources\non the FPGA, leaving ample headroom for further latency reduction, model\nparallelisation, multi-task deployments, or integration of more complex\narchitectures."
