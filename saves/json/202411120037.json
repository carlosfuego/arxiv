To address the limited resources\nof IIoT sensor devices, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted mobile edge\ncomputing (MEC) has emerged as a promising solution, providing flexible and\ncost-effective services in close proximity of IIoT sensor devices (ISDs).\nHowever, leveraging aerial MEC to meet the delay-sensitive and\ncomputation-intensive requirements of the ISDs could face several challenges,\nincluding the limited communication, computation and caching (3C) resources,\nstringent offloading requirements for 3C services, and constrained on-board\nenergy of UAVs. To address these issues, we first present a collaborative\naerial MEC-assisted ICPS architecture by incorporating the computing\ncapabilities of the macro base station (MBS) and UAVs. We then formulate a\nservice delay minimization optimization problem (SDMOP). Since the SDMOP is\nproved to be an NP-hard problem, we propose a joint computation offloading,\ncaching, communication resource allocation, computation resource allocation,\nand UAV trajectory control approach (JC5A). Specifically, JC5A consists of a\nblock successive upper bound minimization method of multipliers (BSUMM) for\ncomputation offloading and service caching, a convex optimization-based method\nfor communication and computation resource allocation, and a successive convex\napproximation (SCA)-based method for UAV trajectory control. Moreover, we\ntheoretically prove the convergence and polynomial complexity of JC5A.\nSimulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach can achieve superior\nsystem performance compared to the benchmark approaches and algorithms.",

A potential\nsolution is compression, which virtually extends the cache capacity by\ncondensing data in cache. In practice, this seemingly simple idea has not\ngained much traction in key-value cache system design, due to several critical\nissues: the compression-unfriendly index structure, severe read/write\namplification, wasteful decompression operations, and heavy computing cost.\nThis paper presents a hybrid DRAM-SSD cache design to realize a systematic\nintegration of data compression in key-value cache. By treating compression as\nan essential component, we have redesigned the indexing structure, data\nmanagement, and leveraged the emerging computational SSD hardware for\ncollaborative optimizations. We have developed a prototype, called ZipCache.\nOur experimental results show that ZipCache can achieve up to 72.4% higher\nthroughput and 42.4% lower latency, while reducing the write amplification by\nup to 26.2 times.",

                "summary": "Efficient cloud computing relies on in-process isolation to optimize\nperformance by running workloads within a single process. Without heavy-weight\nprocess isolation, memory safety errors pose a significant security threat by\nallowing an adversary to extract or corrupt the private data of other\nco-located tenants. Existing in-process isolation mechanisms are not suitable\nfor modern cloud requirements, e.g., MPK's 16 protection domains are\ninsufficient to isolate thousands of cloud workers per process. Consequently,\ncloud service providers have a strong need for lightweight in-process isolation\non commodity x86 machines.\n  This paper presents TME-Box, a novel isolation technique that enables\nfine-grained and scalable sandboxing on commodity x86 CPUs. By repurposing\nIntel TME-MK, which is intended for the encryption of virtual machines, TME-Box\noffers lightweight and efficient in-process isolation. TME-Box enforces that\nsandboxes use their designated encryption keys for memory interactions through\ncompiler instrumentation. This cryptographic isolation enables fine-grained\naccess control, from single cache lines to full pages, and supports flexible\ndata relocation. In addition, the design of TME-Box allows the efficient\nisolation of up to 32K concurrent sandboxes. We present a performance-optimized\nTME-Box prototype, utilizing x86 segment-based addressing, that showcases\ngeomean performance overheads of 5.2 % for data isolation and 9.7 % for code\nand data isolation, evaluated with the SPEC CPU2017 benchmark suite.",

We analyse the\nattention distributions in decoder-only Transformers-based models and observe\nthat attention allocation patterns stay consistent across most layers.\nSurprisingly, we find a clear correlation between the $L_2$ and the attention\nscores over cached KV pairs, where a low $L_2$ of a key embedding usually leads\nto a high attention score during decoding. This finding indicates that the\ninfluence of a KV pair is potentially determined by the key embedding itself\nbefore being queried. Based on this observation, we compress the KV cache based\non the $L_2$ of key embeddings. Our experimental results show that this simple\nstrategy can reduce the KV cache size by 50% on language modelling and\nneedle-in-a-haystack tasks and 90% on passkey retrieval tasks without losing\naccuracy.

In particular, CAMP's\neviction policies are as effective as those of GDS but require only a small\nfraction of the updates to an internal data structure in order to make those\ndecisions. Similar to an implementation of LRU using queues, it adapts to\nchanging workload patterns based on the history of requests for different\nkey-value pairs. It is superior to LRU because it considers both the size and\ncost of key-value pairs to maximize the utility of the available memory across\ncompeting applications. We compare CAMP with both LRU and an alternative that\nrequires human intervention to partition memory into pools and assign grouping\nof key-value pairs to different pools.

Self-attention requires the key-value (KV)\ncache of all previous sequences to be retrieved from memory at every decoding\nstep to retrieve context information, leading to two primary bottlenecks during\nbatch inference. First, there is a significant delay in obtaining the first\ntoken, as the information of the entire prompt must first be processed to\nprefill the KV cache. Second, computation of subsequent tokens is bottlenecked\nby the high memory I/O demand of fetching the entire KV cache, which grows\nlinearly with sequence length, incurring quadratic memory reads overall. We\ndesign the Block Transformer to strategically mitigate these costs, by\nincorporating coarsity and locality into an integrated global-to-local\narchitecture. At the lower layers, we aggregate tokens into fixed size blocks\nto apply attention across the entire sequence at coarse-grained detail, to\ncapture the global context while minimizing KV cache overhead. At upper layers,\nwe apply attention within each block to decode individual tokens, to model\nfine-grained details with a lightweight local KV cache. We pretrain vanilla and\nBlock Transformers from scratch and demonstrate that Block Transformers reach\n10--20x inference throughput compared to vanilla transformers with equivalent\nperplexity and zero-shot task performance.

As exemplified\nby ChatGPT, LLM-based applications necessitate minimal response latency and\nmaximal throughput for inference serving. However, due to the unpredictability\nof LLM execution, the first-come-first-serve (FCFS) scheduling policy employed\nby current LLM serving systems suffers from head-of-line (HoL) blocking issues\nand long job response times.\n  In this paper, we propose a new efficient LLM inference serving framework,\nnamed ALISE. The key design paradigm of ALISE is to leverage a novel\nspeculative scheduler by estimating the execution time for each job and\nexploiting such prior knowledge to assign appropriate job priority orders, thus\nminimizing potential queuing delays for heterogeneous workloads. Furthermore,\nto mitigate the memory overhead of the intermediate key-value (KV) cache, we\nemploy a priority-based adaptive memory management protocol and\nquantization-based compression techniques. Evaluations demonstrate that in\ncomparison to the state-of-the-art solution vLLM, ALISE improves the throughput\nof inference serving by up to 1.8x and 2.1x under the same latency constraint\non the Alpaca and ShareGPT datasets, respectively.",

                    "value": "Large Language Models (LLMs) represent a revolutionary advancement in the\ncontemporary landscape of artificial general intelligence (AGI). As exemplified\nby ChatGPT, LLM-based applications necessitate minimal response latency and\nmaximal throughput for inference serving. However, due to the unpredictability\nof LLM execution, the first-come-first-serve (FCFS) scheduling policy employed\nby current LLM serving systems suffers from head-of-line (HoL) blocking issues\nand long job response times.\n  In this paper, we propose a new efficient LLM inference serving framework,\nnamed ALISE. The key design paradigm of ALISE is to leverage a novel\nspeculative scheduler by estimating the execution time for each job and\nexploiting such prior knowledge to assign appropriate job priority orders, thus\nminimizing potential queuing delays for heterogeneous workloads. Furthermore,\nto mitigate the memory overhead of the intermediate key-value (KV) cache, we\nemploy a priority-based adaptive memory management protocol and\nquantization-based compression techniques. Evaluations demonstrate that in\ncomparison to the state-of-the-art solution vLLM, ALISE improves the throughput\nof inference serving by up to 1.8x and 2.1x under the same latency constraint\non the Alpaca and ShareGPT datasets, respectively."

                "summary": "In recent years, Transformer-based models (Transformers) have achieved\nsignificant success in multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF). However,\nprevious works focus on extracting features either from the time domain or the\nfrequency domain, which inadequately captures the trends and periodic\ncharacteristics. To address this issue, we propose a wavelet learning framework\nto model complex temporal dependencies of the time series data. The wavelet\ndomain integrates both time and frequency information, allowing for the\nanalysis of local characteristics of signals at different scales. Additionally,\nthe Softmax self-attention mechanism used by Transformers has quadratic\ncomplexity, which leads to excessive computational costs when capturing\nlong-term dependencies. Therefore, we propose a novel attention mechanism:\nRotary Route Attention (RoRA). Unlike Softmax attention, RoRA utilizes rotary\nposition embeddings to inject relative positional information to sequence\ntokens and introduces a small number of routing tokens $r$ to aggregate\ninformation from the $KV$ matrices and redistribute it to the $Q$ matrix,\noffering linear complexity. We further propose WaveRoRA, which leverages RoRA\nto capture inter-series dependencies in the wavelet domain. We conduct\nextensive experiments on eight real-world datasets. The results indicate that\nWaveRoRA outperforms existing state-of-the-art models while maintaining lower\ncomputational costs.",

                    "value": "In recent years, Transformer-based models (Transformers) have achieved\nsignificant success in multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF). However,\nprevious works focus on extracting features either from the time domain or the\nfrequency domain, which inadequately captures the trends and periodic\ncharacteristics. To address this issue, we propose a wavelet learning framework\nto model complex temporal dependencies of the time series data. The wavelet\ndomain integrates both time and frequency information, allowing for the\nanalysis of local characteristics of signals at different scales. Additionally,\nthe Softmax self-attention mechanism used by Transformers has quadratic\ncomplexity, which leads to excessive computational costs when capturing\nlong-term dependencies. Therefore, we propose a novel attention mechanism:\nRotary Route Attention (RoRA). Unlike Softmax attention, RoRA utilizes rotary\nposition embeddings to inject relative positional information to sequence\ntokens and introduces a small number of routing tokens $r$ to aggregate\ninformation from the $KV$ matrices and redistribute it to the $Q$ matrix,\noffering linear complexity. We further propose WaveRoRA, which leverages RoRA\nto capture inter-series dependencies in the wavelet domain. We conduct\nextensive experiments on eight real-world datasets. The results indicate that\nWaveRoRA outperforms existing state-of-the-art models while maintaining lower\ncomputational costs."

                "summary": "In this paper, we introduce a new post-training compression paradigm for\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) to facilitate their wider adoption. We delve into\nLLM weight low-rank decomposition, and find that the challenges of this task\nstem from the distribution variance in the LLM activations and the sensitivity\ndifference among various kinds of layers. To address these issues, we propose a\ntraining-free approach called Activation-aware Singular Value Decomposition\n(ASVD). Specifically, ASVD manages activation outliers by transforming the\nweight matrix based on the activation distribution. This transformation allows\nthe outliers in the activation matrix to be absorbed into the transformed\nweight matrix, thereby enhancing decomposition accuracy. Additionally, we\npropose an efficient iterative calibration process to optimize layer-specific\ndecomposition by addressing the varying sensitivity of different LLM layers.

                    "value": "In this paper, we introduce a new post-training compression paradigm for\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) to facilitate their wider adoption. We delve into\nLLM weight low-rank decomposition, and find that the challenges of this task\nstem from the distribution variance in the LLM activations and the sensitivity\ndifference among various kinds of layers. To address these issues, we propose a\ntraining-free approach called Activation-aware Singular Value Decomposition\n(ASVD). Specifically, ASVD manages activation outliers by transforming the\nweight matrix based on the activation distribution. This transformation allows\nthe outliers in the activation matrix to be absorbed into the transformed\nweight matrix, thereby enhancing decomposition accuracy. Additionally, we\npropose an efficient iterative calibration process to optimize layer-specific\ndecomposition by addressing the varying sensitivity of different LLM layers.

In this paper we question this wisdom in the light of\nmodern hardware and workloads, particularly in cloud servers.

                "summary": "Recent research has shown that pre-trained vision-language models are\neffective at identifying out-of-distribution (OOD) samples by using negative\nlabels as guidance. However, employing consistent negative labels across\ndifferent OOD datasets often results in semantic misalignments, as these text\nlabels may not accurately reflect the actual space of OOD images. To overcome\nthis issue, we introduce \\textit{adaptive negative proxies}, which are\ndynamically generated during testing by exploring actual OOD images, to align\nmore closely with the underlying OOD label space and enhance the efficacy of\nnegative proxy guidance. Specifically, our approach utilizes a feature memory\nbank to selectively cache discriminative features from test images,\nrepresenting the targeted OOD distribution.

                    "value": "Recent research has shown that pre-trained vision-language models are\neffective at identifying out-of-distribution (OOD) samples by using negative\nlabels as guidance. However, employing consistent negative labels across\ndifferent OOD datasets often results in semantic misalignments, as these text\nlabels may not accurately reflect the actual space of OOD images. To overcome\nthis issue, we introduce \\textit{adaptive negative proxies}, which are\ndynamically generated during testing by exploring actual OOD images, to align\nmore closely with the underlying OOD label space and enhance the efficacy of\nnegative proxy guidance. Specifically, our approach utilizes a feature memory\nbank to selectively cache discriminative features from test images,\nrepresenting the targeted OOD distribution.

We implement LAMPS on top of vLLM\nand evaluate its performance against baseline LLM inference systems,\ndemonstrating improvements in end-to-end latency by 27%-85% and reductions in\nTTFT by 4%-96% compared to the existing augmented-LLM system, with even greater\ngains over vLLM."

In particular, we\npresent an optimal solution for sub-word encoding (SWE) based on similar\ninitial settings as that of byte-pair encoding (BPE) algorithm in [9] with\nsimilar objectives as that of WordPiece approach in [28, 31] to maximize the\nlikelihood of the training data. We also present cross entropy optimization\nmethod to optimize hyperparameters for word2vec model [17]. In addition, we\npropose a factored combination of rotary positional encoding (RoPE) [32] and\nattention with linear biases (ALiBi) [23] with a harmonic series. We also\npresent a probabilistic FlashAttention [6, 7] (PrFlashAttention) method with a\nprobability distribution over block distances in the matrix to decide which\nblock is likely to participate in a given round of attention computation while\nmaintaining the lower triangle shape of the tensor for autoregressive language\nmodels by re-shaping the tensors. Finally, we present staircase adaptive\nquantization (SAQ) of key-value (KV) cache for multi-query attention (MQA)\nbased on the framework presented in [16] to have gradual quantization\ndegradation while achieving reasonable model quality and cost savings."

Compared to modern GPUs like H$100$, it would be significantly\ncarbon-sustainable if we could leverage old-fashioned GPUs such as M$40$ (as\nshown in Figure 1, M$40$ only has one third carbon emission of H$100$'s) for\nLLM servings. However, the limited High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) available on\nsuch GPU often cannot support the loading of LLMs due to the gigantic model\nsize and intermediate activation data, making their serving challenging. For\ninstance, a LLaMA2 model with $70$B parameters typically requires $128$GB for\ninference, which substantially surpasses $24$GB HBM in a $3090$ GPU and remains\ninfeasible even considering the additional $64$GB DRAM. To address this\nchallenge, this paper proposes a mixed-precision with a model modularization\nalgorithm to enable LLM inference on outdated hardware with resource\nconstraints. (The precision denotes the numerical precision like FP16, INT8,\nINT4) and multi-level caching (M2Cache).)\n  Specifically, our M2Cache first modulizes neurons in LLM and creates their\nimportance ranking. Then, it adopts a dynamic sparse mixed-precision\nquantization mechanism in weight space to reduce computational demands and\ncommunication overhead at each decoding step. It collectively lowers the\noperational carbon emissions associated with LLM inference. Moreover, M2Cache\nintroduces a three-level cache management system with HBM, DRAM, and SSDs that\ncomplements the dynamic sparse mixed-precision inference. To enhance\ncommunication efficiency, M2Cache maintains a neuron-level mixed-precision LRU\ncache in HBM, a larger layer-aware cache in DRAM, and a full model in SSD.",

Compared to modern GPUs like H$100$, it would be significantly\ncarbon-sustainable if we could leverage old-fashioned GPUs such as M$40$ (as\nshown in Figure 1, M$40$ only has one third carbon emission of H$100$'s) for\nLLM servings. However, the limited High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) available on\nsuch GPU often cannot support the loading of LLMs due to the gigantic model\nsize and intermediate activation data, making their serving challenging. For\ninstance, a LLaMA2 model with $70$B parameters typically requires $128$GB for\ninference, which substantially surpasses $24$GB HBM in a $3090$ GPU and remains\ninfeasible even considering the additional $64$GB DRAM. To address this\nchallenge, this paper proposes a mixed-precision with a model modularization\nalgorithm to enable LLM inference on outdated hardware with resource\nconstraints. (The precision denotes the numerical precision like FP16, INT8,\nINT4) and multi-level caching (M2Cache).)\n  Specifically, our M2Cache first modulizes neurons in LLM and creates their\nimportance ranking. Then, it adopts a dynamic sparse mixed-precision\nquantization mechanism in weight space to reduce computational demands and\ncommunication overhead at each decoding step. It collectively lowers the\noperational carbon emissions associated with LLM inference. Moreover, M2Cache\nintroduces a three-level cache management system with HBM, DRAM, and SSDs that\ncomplements the dynamic sparse mixed-precision inference. To enhance\ncommunication efficiency, M2Cache maintains a neuron-level mixed-precision LRU\ncache in HBM, a larger layer-aware cache in DRAM, and a full model in SSD."

To realize these\nbenefits, we envision a Knowledge Delivery Network (KDN), a new system\ncomponent in LLM services that dynamically optimizes the storage, transfer, and\ncomposition of KV cache across LLM engines and other compute and storage\nresources.

Offline All-or-One Paging is NP-hard.\n  Some results for the laminar case are shown via a reduction to the\ngeneralization of Paging in which each request specifies a set $\\mathcal P of\npages, and is satisfied by fetching any page from $\\mathcal P into the cache.\nThe optimal ratios for the latter problem (with laminar family of height $h$)\nare at most $hk$ (deterministic) and $h\\,H_k$ (randomized)."

Yet, it is widely criticized that KV-Cache can become a\nbottleneck of the LLM inference system, especially when confronted with\nultra-large models and long-context queries. A natural remedy is to discard the\nKV-Cache for less important tokens, with StreamingLLM as an example, but the\nused static eviction strategies cannot flexibly adapt to varying contexts.\nRemedies like H2O leverage accumulative attention scores to perform dynamic\neviction but suffer from the attention bias issue in capturing contextual\ninformation. This paper bridges this gap by devising a parameterized KV-Cache\neviction mechanism, dubbed as Attention-Gate, which accepts the whole context\nas input and yields eviction flags for each token to realize in-context\neviction. The subsequent self-attention module proceeds according to the flags\nand only the KV states for the remaining tokens need to be cached. The\nAttention-Gates can vary among different heads and layers and be trivially\nplugged into pre-trained LLMs, tuned by cost-effective continual pre-training\nor supervised fine-tuning objectives to acquire what to discard. The\ncomputational and memory overhead introduced by Attention-Gates is minimal. Our\nmethod is validated across multiple tasks, demonstrating both efficiency and\nadaptability. After a highly efficient continual pre-training, it achieves\nhigher average accuracy and evicts more tokens compared to traditional\ntraining-free methods. In supervised fine-tuning, it not only evicts many\ntokens but also outperforms LoRA-finetuned LLMs on some datasets, such as RTE,\nwhere it improves accuracy by 13.9% while evicting 62.8% of tokens, showing\nthat effective eviction of redundant tokens can even enhance performance.",

To resolve such challenges and effectively\nenhance the capabilities of LLMs, we present FAME, an factual, comprehensive,\nand multi-task dataset, which is designed to enhance the practicality of model\nediting. We then propose SKEME, a model editing method that uses a novel\ncaching mechanism to ensure synchronization with the real world. The\nexperiments demonstrate that SKEME performs excellently across various tasks\nand scenarios, confirming its practicality."

Near-infrared spectra of\n31 sources with red $J-W2$ colors and large $J$-band reduced proper motions\nshow varying signatures of subsolar metallicity, including strong\ncollision-induced H$_2$ absorption, obscured methane and water features, and\nweak K I absorption. These metallicity signatures are supported by spectral\nmodel fits and 3D velocities, indicating thick disk and halo population\nmembership for several sources. We identify three new metal-poor T subdwarfs\n([M/H] $\\lesssim$ $-$0.5), CWISE J062316.19+071505.6, WISEA\nJ152443.14$-$262001.8, and CWISE J211250.11-052925.2; and 19 new \"mild\"\nsubdwarfs with modest metal deficiency ([M/H] $\\lesssim$ $-$0.25). We also\nidentify three metal-rich brown dwarfs with thick disk kinematics. We provide\nkinematic evidence that the extreme L subdwarf 2MASS J053253.46+824646.5 and\nthe mild T subdwarf CWISE J113010.07+313944.7 may be part of the Thamnos\npopulation, while the T subdwarf CWISE J155349.96+693355.2 may be part of the\nHelmi stream. We define a metallicity classification system for T dwarfs that\nadds mild subdwarfs (d/sdT), subdwarfs (sdT), and extreme subdwarfs (esdT) to\nthe existing dwarf sequence. We also define a metallicity spectral index that\ncorrelates with metallicities inferred from spectral model fits and iron\nabundances from stellar primaries of benchmark T dwarf companions. This\nexpansion of the T dwarf classification system supports investigations of\nancient, metal-poor brown dwarfs now being uncovered in deep imaging and\nspectroscopic surveys.",

Near-infrared spectra of\n31 sources with red $J-W2$ colors and large $J$-band reduced proper motions\nshow varying signatures of subsolar metallicity, including strong\ncollision-induced H$_2$ absorption, obscured methane and water features, and\nweak K I absorption. These metallicity signatures are supported by spectral\nmodel fits and 3D velocities, indicating thick disk and halo population\nmembership for several sources. We identify three new metal-poor T subdwarfs\n([M/H] $\\lesssim$ $-$0.5), CWISE J062316.19+071505.6, WISEA\nJ152443.14$-$262001.8, and CWISE J211250.11-052925.2; and 19 new \"mild\"\nsubdwarfs with modest metal deficiency ([M/H] $\\lesssim$ $-$0.25). We also\nidentify three metal-rich brown dwarfs with thick disk kinematics. We provide\nkinematic evidence that the extreme L subdwarf 2MASS J053253.46+824646.5 and\nthe mild T subdwarf CWISE J113010.07+313944.7 may be part of the Thamnos\npopulation, while the T subdwarf CWISE J155349.96+693355.2 may be part of the\nHelmi stream. We define a metallicity classification system for T dwarfs that\nadds mild subdwarfs (d/sdT), subdwarfs (sdT), and extreme subdwarfs (esdT) to\nthe existing dwarf sequence. We also define a metallicity spectral index that\ncorrelates with metallicities inferred from spectral model fits and iron\nabundances from stellar primaries of benchmark T dwarf companions. This\nexpansion of the T dwarf classification system supports investigations of\nancient, metal-poor brown dwarfs now being uncovered in deep imaging and\nspectroscopic surveys."

However, as these models grow larger, they require significantly more\nmemory and suffer from higher latency, posing substantial challenges for\ndeployment. In this work, we aim to accelerate diffusion models by quantizing\ntheir weights and activations to 4 bits. At such an aggressive level, both\nweights and activations are highly sensitive, where conventional post-training\nquantization methods for large language models like smoothing become\ninsufficient. To overcome this limitation, we propose SVDQuant, a new 4-bit\nquantization paradigm. Different from smoothing which redistributes outliers\nbetween weights and activations, our approach absorbs these outliers using a\nlow-rank branch. We first consolidate the outliers by shifting them from\nactivations to weights, then employ a high-precision low-rank branch to take in\nthe weight outliers with Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). This process eases\nthe quantization on both sides. However, na\\\"{\\i}vely running the low-rank\nbranch independently incurs significant overhead due to extra data movement of\nactivations, negating the quantization speedup. To address this, we co-design\nan inference engine Nunchaku that fuses the kernels of the low-rank branch into\nthose of the low-bit branch to cut off redundant memory access. It can also\nseamlessly support off-the-shelf low-rank adapters (LoRAs) without the need for\nre-quantization. Extensive experiments on SDXL, PixArt-$\\Sigma$, and FLUX.1\nvalidate the effectiveness of SVDQuant in preserving image quality. We reduce\nthe memory usage for the 12B FLUX.1 models by 3.5$\\times$, achieving\n3.0$\\times$ speedup over the 4-bit weight-only quantized baseline on the 16GB\nlaptop 4090 GPU, paving the way for more interactive applications on PCs.

Despite their strong instruction-following\ncapabilities, these models frequently struggled to align with user intent in\ncoding scenarios. In particular, they were hampered by datasets that lacked\ndiversity and failed to address specialized tasks or edge cases. Furthermore,\nchallenges in supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from\nhuman feedback (RLHF) led to failures in generating precise,\nhuman-intent-aligned code. To tackle these challenges and improve the code\ngeneration performance for automated programming systems, we propose\nFeedback-driven Adaptive Long/short-term memory reinforced Coding Optimization\n(i.e., FALCON). FALCON is structured into two hierarchical levels. From the\nglobal level, long-term memory improves code quality by retaining and applying\nlearned knowledge. At the local level, short-term memory allows for the\nincorporation of immediate feedback from compilers and AI systems.\nAdditionally, we introduce meta-reinforcement learning with feedback rewards to\nsolve the global-local bi-level optimization problem and enhance the model's\nadaptability across diverse code generation tasks. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that our technique achieves state-of-the-art performance, leading\nother reinforcement learning methods by more than 4.5 percentage points on the\nMBPP benchmark and 6.1 percentage points on the Humaneval benchmark.

Thereby, in video-to-audio\ngeneration task, it is imperative to introduce steering approaches for\ncontrolling the generated audio. While Video-to-Audio generation is a\nwell-established generative task, existing methods lack such controllability.\nIn this work, we propose VATT, a multi-modal generative framework that takes a\nvideo and an optional text prompt as input, and generates audio and optional\ntextual description of the audio. Such a framework has two advantages: i)\nVideo-to-Audio generation process can be refined and controlled via text which\ncomplements the context of visual information, and ii) The model can suggest\nwhat audio to generate for the video by generating audio captions. VATT\nconsists of two key modules: VATT Converter, a LLM that is fine-tuned for\ninstructions and includes a projection layer that maps video features to the\nLLM vector space; and VATT Audio, a transformer that generates audio tokens\nfrom visual frames and from optional text prompt using iterative parallel\ndecoding. The audio tokens are converted to a waveform by pretrained neural\ncodec. Experiments show that when VATT is compared to existing video-to-audio\ngeneration methods in objective metrics, it achieves competitive performance\nwhen the audio caption is not provided. When the audio caption is provided as a\nprompt, VATT achieves even more refined performance (lowest KLD score of 1.41).\nFurthermore, subjective studies show that VATT Audio has been chosen as\npreferred generated audio than audio generated by existing methods. VATT\nenables controllable video-to-audio generation through text as well as\nsuggesting text prompts for videos through audio captions, unlocking novel\napplications such as text-guided video-to-audio generation and video-to-audio\ncaptioning.",

                "summary": "Resistive pulse sensing has been widely used to characterize and count single\nparticles in solution moving through channels under an electric bias, with\nnanoscale pores more recently providing enough spatial resolution for nucleic\nacid sequencing at the single-molecule level. At its core, this technique\nrelies on measuring the drop in ionic current through the pore induced by the\npassage of a molecule and, through conductance models, translating the blockage\nsignal to molecular dimensions. However, there exists no model considering the\nresistive contributions of the pore exterior, i.e. the access regions, when\nobstructed by a molecule. This is becoming increasingly important for low\naspect ratio pores, with the advent of 2D materials and ultrathin membranes. In\nthis work, a general method by which to model the resistance of the access\nregions of a pore in the presence of an insulating obstruction is presented.\nThin oblate spheroidal slices are used to partition access regions and infer\ntheir conductance when blocked by differently shaped objects. We show that our\nmodel accurately estimates the blocked-state conductance of 2D and\nfinite-length pores as a function of the distance from the pore in the presence\nof simple obstructions geometries (e.g. cylindrical and spherical objects) or\ncomplex structures (i.e. sequence of simple obstruction sub-units). The model\nis further shown to capture off-axis effects by predicting deeper blockages for\nobstructions offset from the pore's central axis. A web-based tool is created\nto predict the electrical signatures of a wide range of molecule geometries\ntranslocating through differently shaped pores.

We provide a\nfrequentistic analysis of this test's properties such as level and power, and\nprove that it is a regularized test in the sense of Kretschmann et al. (2024).\nFurthermore we provide lower bounds for its power under classical spectral\nsource conditions in case of Gaussian priors. Numerical simulations illustrate\nits superior performance both in moderately and severely ill-posed situations."

We have given sufficient\nconditions under which the dominating estimators are derived. Under the\ngeneralized Pitman closeness criterion, a Stein-type improved estimator is\nproposed. As an application, we have considered special sampling schemes such\nas type-II censoring, progressive type-II censoring, and record values.\nFinally, we perform a simulation study to compare the risk performance of the\nimproved estimators",

In this paper, we deal with the\ncomponent-wise estimation of location parameters of two exponential\ndistributions studied with ordered scale parameters under a bowl-shaped affine\ninvariant loss function and generalized Pitman closeness criterion. We have\nshown that several benchmark estimators, such as maximum likelihood estimators\n(MLE), uniformly minimum variance unbiased estimators (UMVUE), and best affine\nequivariant estimators (BAEE), are inadmissible. We have given sufficient\nconditions under which the dominating estimators are derived. Under the\ngeneralized Pitman closeness criterion, a Stein-type improved estimator is\nproposed. As an application, we have considered special sampling schemes such\nas type-II censoring, progressive type-II censoring, and record values.\nFinally, we perform a simulation study to compare the risk performance of the\nimproved estimators"

This paper introduces\nHi-SAM, a unified model leveraging SAM for hierarchical text segmentation.\nHi-SAM excels in segmentation across four hierarchies, including pixel-level\ntext, word, text-line, and paragraph, while realizing layout analysis as well.\nSpecifically, we first turn SAM into a high-quality pixel-level text\nsegmentation (TS) model through a parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach. We\nuse this TS model to iteratively generate the pixel-level text labels in a\nsemi-automatical manner, unifying labels across the four text hierarchies in\nthe HierText dataset.

To address this limitation, we present WorkflowLLM, a\ndata-centric framework elaborately designed to enhance the capability of LLMs\nin workflow orchestration. It first constructs a large-scale fine-tuning\ndataset WorkflowBench with 106,763 samples, covering 1,503 APIs from 83\napplications across 28 categories. Specifically, the construction process can\nbe divided into three phases: (1) Data Collection: we collect real-world\nworkflow data from Apple Shortcuts and RoutineHub, transcribing them into\nPython-style code. We further equip them with generated hierarchical thought\nvia ChatGPT. (2) Query Expansion: we prompt ChatGPT to generate more task\nqueries to enrich the diversity and complexity of workflows. (3) Workflow\nGeneration: we leverage an annotator model trained on collected data to\ngenerate workflows for synthesized queries. Finally, we merge the synthetic\nsamples that pass quality confirmation with the collected samples to obtain the\nWorkflowBench. Based on WorkflowBench, we fine-tune Llama-3.1-8B to obtain\nWorkflowLlama. Our experiments show that WorkflowLlama demonstrates a strong\ncapacity to orchestrate complex workflows, while also achieving notable\ngeneralization performance on previously unseen APIs. Additionally,\nWorkflowBench exhibits robust zero-shot generalization capabilities on an\nout-of-distribution task planning dataset, T-Eval.

To enhance memory efficiency and training\nthroughput, in this work, we introduce an efficient sequence-level\none-forward-one-backward (1F1B) pipeline scheduling method tailored for\ntraining LLMs on long sequences named Seq1F1B. Seq1F1B decomposes batch-level\nschedulable units into finer sequence-level units, reducing bubble size and\nmemory footprint.

To further support multi-agent research, we developed an LLM\ncollaborative framework that supports multi-agent concurrent queries and\nmulti-agent communication. In our experiments, the LLM-PySC2 environment is\nadapted to be compatible with the StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC) task\ngroup and provided eight new scenarios focused on macro-decision abilities. We\nevaluated nine mainstream LLMs in the experiments, and results show that\nsufficient parameters are necessary for LLMs to make decisions, but improving\nreasoning ability does not directly lead to better decision-making outcomes.\nOur findings further indicate the importance of enabling large models to learn\nautonomously in the deployment environment through parameter training or\ntrain-free learning techniques. Ultimately, we expect that the LLM-PySC2\nenvironment can promote research on learning methods for LLMs, helping\nLLM-based methods better adapt to task scenarios.",

We evaluate\nseveral open-source and proprietary LLMs across various configurations to\nexplore their capabilities in generating relevant and factual responses. Our\ncomprehensive evaluation, based on metrics for surface-level similarity and LLM\njudgements, highlights notable performance discrepancies. SciDQA represents a\nrigorously curated, naturally derived scientific QA dataset, designed to\nfacilitate research on complex scientific text understanding."

We define and explore the model's cognitive and\nexpressive capabilities through linear representations across three critical\nphases: Pretraining, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and Reinforcement Learning\nfrom Human Feedback (RLHF). Cognitive capability is defined as the quantity and\nquality of information conveyed by the neuron output vectors within the\nnetwork, similar to the neural signal processing in human cognition. Expressive\ncapability is defined as the model's capability to produce word-level output.\nOur findings unveil a sequential development pattern, where cognitive abilities\nare largely established during Pretraining, whereas expressive abilities\npredominantly advance during SFT and RLHF. Statistical analyses confirm a\nsignificant correlation between the two capabilities, suggesting that cognitive\ncapacity may limit expressive potential. The paper also explores the\ntheoretical underpinnings of these divergent developmental trajectories and\ntheir connection to the LLMs' architectural design. Moreover, we evaluate\nvarious optimization-independent strategies, such as few-shot learning and\nrepeated sampling, which bridge the gap between cognitive and expressive\ncapabilities.

However, as these models grow larger, they require significantly more\nmemory and suffer from higher latency, posing substantial challenges for\ndeployment. In this work, we aim to accelerate diffusion models by quantizing\ntheir weights and activations to 4 bits. At such an aggressive level, both\nweights and activations are highly sensitive, where conventional post-training\nquantization methods for large language models like smoothing become\ninsufficient. To overcome this limitation, we propose SVDQuant, a new 4-bit\nquantization paradigm. Different from smoothing which redistributes outliers\nbetween weights and activations, our approach absorbs these outliers using a\nlow-rank branch. We first consolidate the outliers by shifting them from\nactivations to weights, then employ a high-precision low-rank branch to take in\nthe weight outliers with Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). This process eases\nthe quantization on both sides. However, na\\\"{\\i}vely running the low-rank\nbranch independently incurs significant overhead due to extra data movement of\nactivations, negating the quantization speedup. To address this, we co-design\nan inference engine Nunchaku that fuses the kernels of the low-rank branch into\nthose of the low-bit branch to cut off redundant memory access. It can also\nseamlessly support off-the-shelf low-rank adapters (LoRAs) without the need for\nre-quantization.

This paper studies assembly sequence planning\n(ASP) for physical combinatorial assembly. Given the shape of the desired\nobject, the goal is to find a sequence of actions for placing unit primitives\nto build the target object. In particular, we aim to ensure the planned\nassembly sequence is physically executable. However, ASP for combinatorial\nassembly is particularly challenging due to its combinatorial nature. To\naddress the challenge, we employ deep reinforcement learning to learn a\nconstruction policy for placing unit primitives sequentially to build the\ndesired object. Specifically, we design an online physics-aware action mask\nthat filters out invalid actions, which effectively guides policy learning and\nensures violation-free deployment. In the end, we apply the proposed method to\nLego assembly with more than 250 3D structures. The experiment results\ndemonstrate that the proposed method plans physically valid assembly sequences\nto build all structures, achieving a $100\\%$ success rate, whereas the best\ncomparable baseline fails more than $40$ structures.

A widely adopted deployment scenario of 5G FWA includes\nedge cloud that supports computing services and Radio Access Network (RAN)\nfunctions. Such edge cloud requires network and energy resources for 5G FWA.\nThis paper proposes renewable energy powered and Open RAN-based architecture\nfor 5G FWA serving LDRAs using three-level closed-loops. Open RAN is a new 5G\nRAN architecture allowing Open Central Unit and Open Distributed Unit to be\ndistributed in virtualized environment. The first closed-loop distributes radio\nresources to Open RAN instances and slices at the edge cloud. The second\nclosed-loop allocates radio resources to houses. We design a new energy model\nthat leverages renewable energy. We jointly optimize radio and energy resource\nallocation in closed-loop 3. We formulate ultra-small and small-time scale\noptimization problems that link closed-loops to maximize communication utility\nwhile minimizing energy costs. We propose reinforcement learning and successive\nconvex approximation to solve the formulated problems. Then, we use solution\ndata and continual learning to improve resource allocation on a large\ntimescale. Our proposal satisfies 97.14% slice delay budget.",

However, at long context lengths and large batch sizes, the key-value\n(KV) cache, which stores the attention keys and values, emerges as the new\nbottleneck in memory usage during inference. To address this, we propose Eigen\nAttention, which performs the attention operation in a low-rank space, thereby\nreducing the KV cache memory overhead. Our proposed approach is orthogonal to\nexisting KV cache compression techniques and can be used synergistically with\nthem. Through extensive experiments over OPT, MPT, and Llama model families, we\ndemonstrate that Eigen Attention results in up to 40% reduction in KV cache\nsizes and up to 60% reduction in attention operation latency with minimal drop\nin performance.

Our proposed approach is orthogonal to\nexisting KV cache compression techniques and can be used synergistically with\nthem. Through extensive experiments over OPT, MPT, and Llama model families, we\ndemonstrate that Eigen Attention results in up to 40% reduction in KV cache\nsizes and up to 60% reduction in attention operation latency with minimal drop\nin performance.

However, deploying edge clouds in rural areas can increase\nnetwork and energy costs. To address these challenges, we propose a closed-loop\nsystem assisted by a Digital Twin (DT) to automate energy-aware O-RAN based FWA\nresource management in rural areas. We consider the FWA and edge cloud as the\nPhysical Twin (PT) and design a closed-loop that distributes radio resources to\nedge cloud instances for scheduling.

We design an energy model that\nintegrates radio resource allocation and formulate ultra-small and\nsmall-timescale optimizations for the PT to maximize slice requirement\nsatisfaction while minimizing energy costs. We then design a reinforcement\nlearning approach and successive convex approximation to address the formulated\nproblems.

However, existing generative retrieval\nmethods directly decode docid when a query is given, making it impossible to\nprovide users with explanations as an answer for \"Why this document is\nretrieved?\". To address this limitation, we propose Hierarchical Category\nPath-Enhanced Generative Retrieval(HyPE), which enhances explainability by\ngenerating hierarchical category paths step-by-step before decoding docid. HyPE\nleverages hierarchical category paths as explanation, progressing from broad to\nspecific semantic categories. This approach enables diverse explanations for\nthe same document depending on the query by using shared category paths between\nthe query and the document, and provides reasonable explanation by reflecting\nthe document's semantic structure through a coarse-to-fine manner. HyPE\nconstructs category paths with external high-quality semantic hierarchy,\nleverages LLM to select appropriate candidate paths for each document, and\noptimizes the generative retrieval model with path-augmented dataset. During\ninference, HyPE utilizes path-aware reranking strategy to aggregate diverse\ntopic information, allowing the most relevant documents to be prioritized in\nthe final ranked list of docids. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that\nHyPE not only offers a high level of explainability but also improves the\nretrieval performance in the document retrieval task.",

To address this limitation, we propose Hierarchical Category\nPath-Enhanced Generative Retrieval(HyPE), which enhances explainability by\ngenerating hierarchical category paths step-by-step before decoding docid. HyPE\nleverages hierarchical category paths as explanation, progressing from broad to\nspecific semantic categories. This approach enables diverse explanations for\nthe same document depending on the query by using shared category paths between\nthe query and the document, and provides reasonable explanation by reflecting\nthe document's semantic structure through a coarse-to-fine manner. HyPE\nconstructs category paths with external high-quality semantic hierarchy,\nleverages LLM to select appropriate candidate paths for each document, and\noptimizes the generative retrieval model with path-augmented dataset. During\ninference, HyPE utilizes path-aware reranking strategy to aggregate diverse\ntopic information, allowing the most relevant documents to be prioritized in\nthe final ranked list of docids. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that\nHyPE not only offers a high level of explainability but also improves the\nretrieval performance in the document retrieval task."

This study investigates two critical components believed to\ninfluence this uncertainty: the recently discovered entropy neurons and a new\nset of components that we term token frequency neurons. Entropy neurons are\ncharacterized by an unusually high weight norm and influence the final layer\nnormalization (LayerNorm) scale to effectively scale down the logits.

This study investigates two critical components believed to\ninfluence this uncertainty: the recently discovered entropy neurons and a new\nset of components that we term token frequency neurons. Entropy neurons are\ncharacterized by an unusually high weight norm and influence the final layer\nnormalization (LayerNorm) scale to effectively scale down the logits.

To address this limitation, we present WorkflowLLM, a\ndata-centric framework elaborately designed to enhance the capability of LLMs\nin workflow orchestration. It first constructs a large-scale fine-tuning\ndataset WorkflowBench with 106,763 samples, covering 1,503 APIs from 83\napplications across 28 categories. Specifically, the construction process can\nbe divided into three phases: (1) Data Collection: we collect real-world\nworkflow data from Apple Shortcuts and RoutineHub, transcribing them into\nPython-style code. We further equip them with generated hierarchical thought\nvia ChatGPT. (2) Query Expansion: we prompt ChatGPT to generate more task\nqueries to enrich the diversity and complexity of workflows. (3) Workflow\nGeneration: we leverage an annotator model trained on collected data to\ngenerate workflows for synthesized queries. Finally, we merge the synthetic\nsamples that pass quality confirmation with the collected samples to obtain the\nWorkflowBench. Based on WorkflowBench, we fine-tune Llama-3.1-8B to obtain\nWorkflowLlama. Our experiments show that WorkflowLlama demonstrates a strong\ncapacity to orchestrate complex workflows, while also achieving notable\ngeneralization performance on previously unseen APIs. Additionally,\nWorkflowBench exhibits robust zero-shot generalization capabilities on an\nout-of-distribution task planning dataset, T-Eval.

To address this limitation, we present WorkflowLLM, a\ndata-centric framework elaborately designed to enhance the capability of LLMs\nin workflow orchestration. It first constructs a large-scale fine-tuning\ndataset WorkflowBench with 106,763 samples, covering 1,503 APIs from 83\napplications across 28 categories. Specifically, the construction process can\nbe divided into three phases: (1) Data Collection: we collect real-world\nworkflow data from Apple Shortcuts and RoutineHub, transcribing them into\nPython-style code. We further equip them with generated hierarchical thought\nvia ChatGPT. (2) Query Expansion: we prompt ChatGPT to generate more task\nqueries to enrich the diversity and complexity of workflows. (3) Workflow\nGeneration: we leverage an annotator model trained on collected data to\ngenerate workflows for synthesized queries. Finally, we merge the synthetic\nsamples that pass quality confirmation with the collected samples to obtain the\nWorkflowBench. Based on WorkflowBench, we fine-tune Llama-3.1-8B to obtain\nWorkflowLlama. Our experiments show that WorkflowLlama demonstrates a strong\ncapacity to orchestrate complex workflows, while also achieving notable\ngeneralization performance on previously unseen APIs. Additionally,\nWorkflowBench exhibits robust zero-shot generalization capabilities on an\nout-of-distribution task planning dataset, T-Eval. Our data and code are\navailable at https://github.com/OpenBMB/WorkflowLLM."

In practice, multiple\nresponses can exist for a given prompt with varying quality relative to each\nother. With availability of such quality ratings for multiple responses, we\npropose utilizing these responses to create multiple preference pairs for a\ngiven prompt. Our work focuses on systematically using the constructed multiple\npreference pair in DPO training via curriculum learning methodology. In\nparticular, we order these multiple pairs of preference data from easy to hard\n(emulating curriculum training) according to various criteria.

                "summary": "The performance of vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, in visual\nclassification tasks, has been enhanced by leveraging semantic knowledge from\nlarge language models (LLMs), including GPT. Recent studies have shown that in\nzero-shot classification tasks, descriptors incorporating additional cues,\nhigh-level concepts, or even random characters often outperform those using\nonly the category name. In many classification tasks, while the top-1 accuracy\nmay be relatively low, the top-5 accuracy is often significantly higher. This\ngap implies that most misclassifications occur among a few similar classes,\nhighlighting the model's difficulty in distinguishing between classes with\nsubtle differences. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel concept of\ncomparative descriptors. These descriptors emphasize the unique features of a\ntarget class against its most similar classes, enhancing differentiation. By\ngenerating and integrating these comparative descriptors into the\nclassification framework, we refine the semantic focus and improve\nclassification accuracy. An additional filtering process ensures that these\ndescriptors are closer to the image embeddings in the CLIP space, further\nenhancing performance. Our approach demonstrates improved accuracy and\nrobustness in visual classification tasks by addressing the specific challenge\nof subtle inter-class differences.",

                    "value": "The performance of vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, in visual\nclassification tasks, has been enhanced by leveraging semantic knowledge from\nlarge language models (LLMs), including GPT. Recent studies have shown that in\nzero-shot classification tasks, descriptors incorporating additional cues,\nhigh-level concepts, or even random characters often outperform those using\nonly the category name. In many classification tasks, while the top-1 accuracy\nmay be relatively low, the top-5 accuracy is often significantly higher. This\ngap implies that most misclassifications occur among a few similar classes,\nhighlighting the model's difficulty in distinguishing between classes with\nsubtle differences. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel concept of\ncomparative descriptors. These descriptors emphasize the unique features of a\ntarget class against its most similar classes, enhancing differentiation. By\ngenerating and integrating these comparative descriptors into the\nclassification framework, we refine the semantic focus and improve\nclassification accuracy. An additional filtering process ensures that these\ndescriptors are closer to the image embeddings in the CLIP space, further\nenhancing performance. Our approach demonstrates improved accuracy and\nrobustness in visual classification tasks by addressing the specific challenge\nof subtle inter-class differences."

We introduce SciDQA,\na new dataset for reading comprehension that challenges LLMs for a deep\nunderstanding of scientific articles, consisting of 2,937 QA pairs. Unlike\nother scientific QA datasets, SciDQA sources questions from peer reviews by\ndomain experts and answers by paper authors, ensuring a thorough examination of\nthe literature. We enhance the dataset's quality through a process that\ncarefully filters out lower quality questions, decontextualizes the content,\ntracks the source document across different versions, and incorporates a\nbibliography for multi-document question-answering.

Unlike\nother scientific QA datasets, SciDQA sources questions from peer reviews by\ndomain experts and answers by paper authors, ensuring a thorough examination of\nthe literature. We enhance the dataset's quality through a process that\ncarefully filters out lower quality questions, decontextualizes the content,\ntracks the source document across different versions, and incorporates a\nbibliography for multi-document question-answering.

We define and explore the model's cognitive and\nexpressive capabilities through linear representations across three critical\nphases: Pretraining, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and Reinforcement Learning\nfrom Human Feedback (RLHF). Cognitive capability is defined as the quantity and\nquality of information conveyed by the neuron output vectors within the\nnetwork, similar to the neural signal processing in human cognition. Expressive\ncapability is defined as the model's capability to produce word-level output.\nOur findings unveil a sequential development pattern, where cognitive abilities\nare largely established during Pretraining, whereas expressive abilities\npredominantly advance during SFT and RLHF. Statistical analyses confirm a\nsignificant correlation between the two capabilities, suggesting that cognitive\ncapacity may limit expressive potential. The paper also explores the\ntheoretical underpinnings of these divergent developmental trajectories and\ntheir connection to the LLMs' architectural design. Moreover, we evaluate\nvarious optimization-independent strategies, such as few-shot learning and\nrepeated sampling, which bridge the gap between cognitive and expressive\ncapabilities.

These strategies\noffer potential enhancements to the performance of protein-related multimodal\nmodels. Our code and data are available at\nhttps://github.com/Tizzzzy/LLM-GDM-alignment."

Additionally, we present the Reasoning Tuning\nVLM Grasp dataset, carefully curated to facilitate the adaptation of LLMs to\nrobotic grasping. Extensive validation on both grasping datasets and real-world\nexperiments underscores the adaptability of multi-modal LLMs for numerical\nprediction tasks in robotics. This not only expands their applicability but\nalso bridges the gap between text-based planning and direct robot control,\nthereby maximizing the potential of LLMs in robotics."

This complex process involves gathering information about the\ntarget system, identifying entry points, exploiting the system, and reporting\nfindings. Despite its effectiveness, manual penetration testing is\ntime-consuming and expensive, often requiring significant expertise and\nresources that many organizations cannot afford. While automated penetration\ntesting methods have been proposed, they often fall short in real-world\napplications due to limitations in flexibility, adaptability, and\nimplementation.\n  Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities\nfor enhancing penetration testing through increased intelligence and\nautomation. However, current LLM-based approaches still face significant\nchallenges, including limited penetration testing knowledge and a lack of\ncomprehensive automation capabilities. To address these gaps, we propose\nPentestAgent, a novel LLM-based automated penetration testing framework that\nleverages the power of LLMs and various LLM-based techniques like Retrieval\nAugmented Generation (RAG) to enhance penetration testing knowledge and\nautomate various tasks. Our framework leverages multi-agent collaboration to\nautomate intelligence gathering, vulnerability analysis, and exploitation\nstages, reducing manual intervention. We evaluate PentestAgent using a\ncomprehensive benchmark, demonstrating superior performance in task completion\nand overall efficiency. This work significantly advances the practical\napplicability of automated penetration testing systems.",

                    "value": "Penetration testing is a critical technique for identifying security\nvulnerabilities, traditionally performed manually by skilled security\nspecialists. This complex process involves gathering information about the\ntarget system, identifying entry points, exploiting the system, and reporting\nfindings. Despite its effectiveness, manual penetration testing is\ntime-consuming and expensive, often requiring significant expertise and\nresources that many organizations cannot afford. While automated penetration\ntesting methods have been proposed, they often fall short in real-world\napplications due to limitations in flexibility, adaptability, and\nimplementation.\n  Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities\nfor enhancing penetration testing through increased intelligence and\nautomation. However, current LLM-based approaches still face significant\nchallenges, including limited penetration testing knowledge and a lack of\ncomprehensive automation capabilities. To address these gaps, we propose\nPentestAgent, a novel LLM-based automated penetration testing framework that\nleverages the power of LLMs and various LLM-based techniques like Retrieval\nAugmented Generation (RAG) to enhance penetration testing knowledge and\nautomate various tasks. Our framework leverages multi-agent collaboration to\nautomate intelligence gathering, vulnerability analysis, and exploitation\nstages, reducing manual intervention. We evaluate PentestAgent using a\ncomprehensive benchmark, demonstrating superior performance in task completion\nand overall efficiency. This work significantly advances the practical\napplicability of automated penetration testing systems."
