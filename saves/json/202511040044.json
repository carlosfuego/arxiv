While existing caching techniques can\naccelerate inference, they often create a challenging trade-off between speed\nand fidelity, suffering from quality degradation and high computational\noverhead. To address these limitations, we introduce H2-Cache, a novel\nhierarchical caching mechanism designed for modern generative diffusion model\narchitectures. Our method is founded on the key insight that the denoising\nprocess can be functionally separated into a structure-defining stage and a\ndetail-refining stage. H2-cache leverages this by employing a dual-threshold\nsystem, using independent thresholds to selectively cache each stage. To ensure\nthe efficiency of our dual-check approach, we introduce pooled feature\nsummarization (PFS), a lightweight technique for robust and fast similarity\nestimation. Extensive experiments on the Flux architecture demonstrate that\nH2-cache achieves significant acceleration (up to 5.08x) while maintaining\nimage quality nearly identical to the baseline, quantitatively and\nqualitatively outperforming existing caching methods. Our work presents a\nrobust and practical solution that effectively resolves the speed-quality\ndilemma, significantly lowering the barrier for the real-world application of\nhigh-fidelity diffusion models.

However, leveraging Trainium architecture for high performance\ncan be challenging because of its systolic array architecture and special\nrequirement on data layout. In this paper, we design high-performance matrix\nmultiplication (matmul), a critical compute kernel, for LLM inference on\nTrainium. We introduce a series of techniques customized to Trainium based on\nkernel fusion and novel caching strategies to reduce data movement across the\nsoftware-managed memory hierarchy, maximize SRAM bandwidth, and avoid expensive\nmatrix transpose. Evaluating with nine datasets and four recent LLMs, we show\nthat our system largely outperforms the state-of-the-art matmul implemented by\nAWS on Trainium: at the level of matmul kernel, it achieves an average 1.35x\nspeedup (up to 2.22x), which translates to an average 1.66x speedup (up to\n2.49x) for end-to-end LLM inference.",

To facilitate rapid prototyping, it offers\na C++ application programming interface and modular configuration options. Our\ndetailed cache model provides accurate insights into performance variations\ncaused by cache configurations, which are not captured by other frameworks. The\nframework is demonstrated through two case studies: a data-aware prefetcher for\ngraph analytics workloads, and a quicksort accelerator. Our evaluation shows\nthat the prefetcher achieves speedups between 1.08x and 1.88x by reducing\nmemory access latency, while the quicksort accelerator delivers more than 2x\nspeedup with minimal address translation overhead.

The quadratic complexity in attention\nand autoregressive generation, as well as the constantly growing key value (KV)\ncache size, severely hinder the prefilling and decoding stages. Recent efforts\nhave attempted to compress KV cache by identifying and pruning KV cache of less\nimportant tokens, but these methods typically rely on attention scores to\nestimate token importance, making them incompatible with efficient attention\nmechanisms such as FlashAttention and Sparse Attention, which do not explicitly\ncompute attention matrices. Moreover, existing methods overlook how sparse\nattention, while accelerating the prefilling stage, alters the information\nstructure of the KV cache, thereby compromising the effectiveness of downstream\nKV cache compression strategies. To address this issue, we propose PureKV, a\nplug-and-play framework for joint optimization of sparse attention and KV cache\ncompression. We first introduce a KV cache compression strategy that is fully\ncompatible with efficient attention accelerators. Our method utilizes lower\nlayer attention scores to estimate the importance of high layers' KV cache,\nenabling active pruning without compromising accuracy. In addition, we have\ndesigned a Spatial-Temporal Sparse Attention (ST-SpAttn) module specifically\ntailored for video KV cache compression algorithms. This module combines\nspatial and temporal attention sparsity to improve the compression efficiency\nof KV cache optimization algorithms by purifying spatial noise and temporal\nredundancy in KV cache. At the same time, ST-SpAttn also accelerated the\nprefilling stage of VLLMs. Extensive experiments on VLLMs (VideoLLaMA2,\nQwen2.5-VL) have shown that PureKV achieves 5.0 times KV cache compression and\n3.16 times prefill acceleration, with negligible quality degradation.",

The sensor node\nsamples measurements using a Bernoulli sampling process, and places the\nmeasurement samples in the transmit queue of its transmitter. The transmitter\nuses a retransmit-until-success transmission strategy to deliver packets to the\nDM over the lossy link, in which the packet losses are modeled as a Bernoulli\nprocess, with different loss probabilities before and after the change. We pose\nthe QCD problem in the non-Bayesian setting under Lorden's framework, and\npropose a CUSUM algorithm. By defining a suitable Markov process, involving the\nDM measurements and the queue length process, we show that the problem reduces\nto QCD in a Markov process. Characterizing the information measure per\nmeasurement sample at the DM, we establish the asymptotic optimality of our\nalgorithm when the false alarm rate tends to zero. Further, when the DM\nreceives incomplete data due to channel loss, we present asymptotically optimal\nQCD algorithms by suitably modifying the CUSUM algorithm. We then explore the\nlast-come-first-served (LCFS) queuing discipline at the sensor transmit queue\nto lower detection delay in the non-asymptotic case. Next, we consider the case\nof multiple sensors, each with its own wireless transmitter queue, and show\nthat our analysis extends to the case of multiple homogeneous sensors. When the\nsensors are heterogeneous, we present a sensor scheduling algorithm that\nminimizes detection delay by balancing the trade-off between the age of the\nobservations and their information content. Numerical analysis demonstrate\ntrade-offs that can be used to optimize system design parameters in the\nnon-asymptotic regime.",

In practice, IIE often modifies only specific regions of an image,\nwhile the remaining areas largely remain unchanged. Although these two types of\nregions differ significantly in generation difficulty and computational\nredundancy, existing IIE models do not account for this distinction, instead\napplying a uniform generation process across the entire image. This motivates\nus to propose RegionE, an adaptive, region-aware generation framework that\naccelerates IIE tasks without additional training. Specifically, the RegionE\nframework consists of three main components: 1) Adaptive Region Partition. We\nobserved that the trajectory of unedited regions is straight, allowing for\nmulti-step denoised predictions to be inferred in a single step. Therefore, in\nthe early denoising stages, we partition the image into edited and unedited\nregions based on the difference between the final estimated result and the\nreference image. 2) Region-Aware Generation. After distinguishing the regions,\nwe replace multi-step denoising with one-step prediction for unedited areas.\nFor edited regions, the trajectory is curved, requiring local iterative\ndenoising. To improve the efficiency and quality of local iterative generation,\nwe propose the Region-Instruction KV Cache, which reduces computational cost\nwhile incorporating global information. 3) Adaptive Velocity Decay Cache.\nObserving that adjacent timesteps in edited regions exhibit strong velocity\nsimilarity, we further propose an adaptive velocity decay cache to accelerate\nthe local denoising process.

Experimental results on several benchmarks, as well as\nreal-world deployments, demonstrate that NanoVLA achieves up to 52x faster\ninference on edge devices compared to previous state-of-the-art VLA models,\nwith 98% less parameters while maintaining or surpassing their task accuracy\nand generalization. Ablation studies confirm that our decoupling strategy\npreserves cross-task transferability, and the routing module enhances\ncost-performance trade-offs, enabling practical, high-precision robotic\nmanipulation on resource-constrained hardware.",

                "summary": "Large Language Models capable of handling extended contexts are in high\ndemand, yet their inference remains challenging due to substantial Key-Value\ncache size and high memory bandwidth requirements. Previous research has\ndemonstrated that KV cache exhibits low-rank characteristics within the hidden\ndimension, suggesting the potential for effective compression. However, due to\nthe widely adopted Rotary Position Embedding mechanism in modern LLMs, naive\nlow-rank compression suffers severe accuracy degradation or creates a new speed\nbottleneck, as the low-rank cache must first be reconstructed in order to apply\nRoPE. In this paper, we introduce two key insights: first, the application of\nRoPE to the key vectors increases their variance, which in turn results in a\nhigher rank; second, after the key vectors are transformed into the latent\nspace, they largely maintain their representation across most layers. Based on\nthese insights, we propose the Sparse Attention in Latent Space framework. SALS\nprojects the KV cache into a compact latent space via low-rank projection, and\nperforms sparse token selection using RoPE-free query-key interactions in this\nspace. By reconstructing only a small subset of important tokens, it avoids the\noverhead of full KV cache reconstruction. We comprehensively evaluate SALS on\nvarious tasks using two large-scale models: LLaMA2-7b-chat and Mistral-7b, and\nadditionally verify its scalability on the RULER-128k benchmark with\nLLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct. Experimental results demonstrate that SALS achieves SOTA\nperformance by maintaining competitive accuracy. Under different settings, SALS\nachieves 6.4-fold KV cache compression and 5.7-fold speed-up in the attention\noperator compared to FlashAttention2 on the 4K sequence. For the end-to-end\nthroughput performance, we achieves 1.4-fold and 4.5-fold improvement compared\nto GPT-fast on 4k and 32K sequences, respectively.",

However, RAG\nincreases the end-to-end inference time since looking for relevant documents\nfrom large vector databases is computationally expensive. To address this, we\nintroduce Proximity, an approximate key-value cache that optimizes the RAG\nworkflow by leveraging similarities in user queries. Instead of treating each\nquery independently, Proximity reuses previously retrieved documents when\nsimilar queries appear, substantially reducing the reliance on expensive vector\ndatabase lookups. To efficiently scale, Proximity employs a locality-sensitive\nhashing (LSH) scheme that enables fast cache lookups while preserving retrieval\naccuracy. We evaluate Proximity using the MMLU and MedRAG question-answering\nbenchmarks. Our experiments demonstrate that Proximity with our LSH scheme and\na realistically-skewed MedRAG workload reduces database calls by 77.2% while\nmaintaining database recall and test accuracy. We experiment with different\nsimilarity tolerances and cache capacities, and show that the time spent within\nthe Proximity cache remains low and constant (4.8 microseconds) even as the\ncache grows substantially in size.

Finally, we enhance PESTO's practical\nutility by developing a streamable VQT implementation using cached\nconvolutions. Combined with our model's low latency (less than 10 ms) and\nminimal parameter count, this makes PESTO particularly suitable for real-time\napplications."

By splitting each file into $F$ equal\npackets (i.e., the subpacketization level $F$) and letting each user cache a\nset of packets, the transmission load can be significantly reduced via coded\nmulticasting. It has been shown that a higher subpacketization level could\npotentially lead to a lower transmission load, as more packets can be combined\nfor efficient transmission. On the other hand, a larger $F$ indicates a higher\ncoding complexity and is problematic from a practical perspective when $F$ is\nextremely large. Despite many works attempting to design coded caching schemes\nwith low subpacketization levels, a fundamental problem remains open: What is\nthe minimum transmission load given any fixed subpacketization level? In this\npaper, we consider the classical cache-aided networks with identically uncoded\nplacement and one-shot delivery strategy, and investigate the fundamental\ntrade-off between the transmission load and the subpacketization level. We\npropose a \\emph{general} lower bound on the transmission load for any fixed\nsubpacketization by reformulating the centralized coded caching schemes via the\ncombinatorial structure of the corresponding placement delivery array. The\nlower bound also recovers existing optimality results for the bipartite graph\nscheme (including the well-known Maddah-Ali and Niesen (MN) scheme and the\nconjugate MN scheme) as well as the grouping bipartite graph scheme.\nFurthermore, by carefully exploiting the combinatorial structure and computing\nthe union size of sorted sets, we establish a new optimality result, i.e., the\npartition scheme can achieve the optimal rate-subpacketization trade-off.",

The advent of large\nlanguage models and sequential modeling techniques, particularly\ntransformer-like architectures, has led to significant advancements recently\n(e.g., HSTU, SIM, and TWIN models).

In this paper, we propose a novel\ntwo-stage modeling framework, namely VIrtual Sequential Target Attention\n(VISTA), which decomposes traditional target attention from a candidate item to\nuser history items into two distinct stages: (1) user history summarization\ninto a few hundred tokens; followed by (2) candidate item attention to those\ntokens. These summarization token embeddings are then cached in storage system\nand then utilized as sequence features for downstream model training and\ninference. This novel design for scalability enables VISTA to scale to lifelong\nuser histories (up to one million items) while keeping downstream training and\ninference costs fixed, which is essential in industry.

We introduce an alternate bounded update combining a\nhistorical eigenbasis with instantaneous normalization, resulting in\nacross-the-board stability and significantly lower computational requirements.\nSecond, we adapt a shape-aware scaling to enable learning rate transfer across\nnetwork width. Third, we find that high learning rates result in large\nparameter noise, and propose a simple iterate-averaging scheme which unblocks\nfaster learning. To properly confirm these findings, we introduce a pointed\nTransformer training benchmark, considering three objectives (language\nmodelling, image classification, and diffusion modelling) across different\nstages of training.

Although existing acceleration\ntechniques have made progress, they still face challenges such as limited\napplicability, high training costs, or quality degradation.\n  Against this backdrop, \\textbf{Diffusion Caching} offers a promising\ntraining-free, architecture-agnostic, and efficient inference paradigm. Its\ncore mechanism identifies and reuses intrinsic computational redundancies in\nthe diffusion process. By enabling feature-level cross-step reuse and\ninter-layer scheduling, it reduces computation without modifying model\nparameters. This paper systematically reviews the theoretical foundations and\nevolution of Diffusion Caching and proposes a unified framework for its\nclassification and analysis.\n  Through comparative analysis of representative methods, we show that\nDiffusion Caching evolves from \\textit{static reuse} to \\textit{dynamic\nprediction}. This trend enhances caching flexibility across diverse tasks and\nenables integration with other acceleration techniques such as sampling\noptimization and model distillation, paving the way for a unified, efficient\ninference framework for future multimodal and interactive applications. We\nargue that this paradigm will become a key enabler of real-time and efficient\ngenerative AI, injecting new vitality into both theory and practice of\n\\textit{Efficient Generative Intelligence}.",

Although existing acceleration\ntechniques have made progress, they still face challenges such as limited\napplicability, high training costs, or quality degradation.\n  Against this backdrop, \\textbf{Diffusion Caching} offers a promising\ntraining-free, architecture-agnostic, and efficient inference paradigm. Its\ncore mechanism identifies and reuses intrinsic computational redundancies in\nthe diffusion process. By enabling feature-level cross-step reuse and\ninter-layer scheduling, it reduces computation without modifying model\nparameters. This paper systematically reviews the theoretical foundations and\nevolution of Diffusion Caching and proposes a unified framework for its\nclassification and analysis.\n  Through comparative analysis of representative methods, we show that\nDiffusion Caching evolves from \\textit{static reuse} to \\textit{dynamic\nprediction}. This trend enhances caching flexibility across diverse tasks and\nenables integration with other acceleration techniques such as sampling\noptimization and model distillation, paving the way for a unified, efficient\ninference framework for future multimodal and interactive applications. We\nargue that this paradigm will become a key enabler of real-time and efficient\ngenerative AI, injecting new vitality into both theory and practice of\n\\textit{Efficient Generative Intelligence}."

Then we further investigate whether\nexisting inference optimization techniques are valid for RLLM. Our main\ntakeaways are that model quantization methods and speculative decoding can\nimprove service system efficiency with small compromise to RLLM accuracy, while\nprefix caching, KV cache quantization may even degrade accuracy or serving\nperformance for small RLLM. Lastly, we conduct evaluation under real world\nworkload modeled by Gamma distribution to verify our findings.

Adamas applies the Hadamard transform,\nbucketization and 2-bit compression to produce compact representations, and\nleverages Manhattan-distance estimation for efficient top-k selections.\nExperiments show that Adamas matches the accuracy of full attention with only a\n64-token budget, achieves near-lossless performance at 128, and supports up to\n8x higher sparsity than prior state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods while delivering\nup to 4.4x self-attention and 1.5x end-to-end speedups on 32K-length sequences.\nRemarkably, Adamas attains comparable or even lower perplexity than full\nattention, underscoring its effectiveness in maintaining accuracy under\naggressive sparsity."

We evaluate StreamingThinker on the Qwen3 model family across\nmath reasoning, logical reasoning, and context-based QA reasoning tasks.\nExperimental results show that the StreamingThinker preserves performance\ncomparable to batch thinking, while yielding an 80\\% reduction in token waiting\nbefore the onset of reasoning and a more than 60\\% reduction in time-level\nlatency for producing the final answer, demonstrating the effectiveness of the\nstreaming paradigm for LLM reasoning. Code will be released at\n\\href{https://github.com/EIT-NLP/StreamingLLM/tree/main/StreamingThinker}{this\nrepository.}"

We argue that overcoming\nthis bottleneck requires a new design axis for LLM scaling: increasing the\nsemantic bandwidth of each generative step. To this end, we introduce\nContinuous Autoregressive Language Models (CALM), a paradigm shift from\ndiscrete next-token prediction to continuous next-vector prediction. CALM uses\na high-fidelity autoencoder to compress a chunk of K tokens into a single\ncontinuous vector, from which the original tokens can be reconstructed with\nover 99.9\\% accuracy. This allows us to model language as a sequence of\ncontinuous vectors instead of discrete tokens, which reduces the number of\ngenerative steps by a factor of K. The paradigm shift necessitates a new\nmodeling toolkit; therefore, we develop a comprehensive likelihood-free\nframework that enables robust training, evaluation, and controllable sampling\nin the continuous domain. Experiments show that CALM significantly improves the\nperformance-compute trade-off, achieving the performance of strong discrete\nbaselines at a significantly lower computational cost. More importantly, these\nfindings establish next-vector prediction as a powerful and scalable pathway\ntowards ultra-efficient language models. Code:\nhttps://github.com/shaochenze/calm.

In practice, they depend on a\nnon-differentiable decoding process that requires laborious, hand-tuning of\nhyperparameters like temperature and top-p. This paper introduces AutoDeco, a\nnovel architecture that enables truly \"end-to-end\" generation by learning to\ncontrol its own decoding strategy. We augment the standard transformer with\nlightweight heads that, at each step, dynamically predict context-specific\ntemperature and top-p values alongside the next-token logits. This approach\ntransforms decoding into a parametric, token-level process, allowing the model\nto self-regulate its sampling strategy within a single forward pass.\n  Through extensive experiments on eight benchmarks, we demonstrate that\nAutoDeco not only significantly outperforms default decoding strategies but\nalso achieves performance comparable to an oracle-tuned baseline derived from\n\"hacking the test set\"-a practical upper bound for any static method.\nCrucially, we uncover an emergent capability for instruction-based decoding\ncontrol: the model learns to interpret natural language commands (e.g.,\n\"generate with low randomness\") and adjusts its predicted temperature and top-p\non a token-by-token basis, opening a new paradigm for steerable and interactive\nLLM decoding.",

HELIOS greedily allows such tokens to exit early\nand only loads the weights of the most likely to be used layers, yielding\nmemory savings which is then re-purposed to increase batch sizes. HELIOS\nemploys real-time profiling to accurately identify the early-exit\ndistributions, and adaptively switches between models by tracking tokens in\nreal-time to minimize the performance degradation caused by greedy model\nloading and exiting. Our evaluations show that HELIOS achieves $1.48\\times$\nhigher throughput and $15.14\\times$ larger batch size compared to existing\nEE-LLM frameworks."

However, current CL-DPFL methods usually\nresult in sharper loss landscapes, which leads to a decrease in model\ngeneralization after differential privacy protection. By using Sharpness Aware\nMinimization (SAM), the current popular federated learning methods are to find\na local flat minimum value to alleviate this problem. However, the local\nflatness may not reflect the global flatness in CL-DPFL. Therefore, to address\nthis issue and seek global flat minima of models, we propose a new CL-DPFL\nalgorithm, DP-FedPGN, in which we introduce a global gradient norm penalty to\nthe local loss to find the global flat minimum. Moreover, by using our global\ngradient norm penalty, we not only find a flatter global minimum but also\nreduce the locally updated norm, which means that we further reduce the error\nof gradient clipping.

At the\ntask-planning level, the LLM-based agent decides whether to respond directly,\nclarify user intent, invoke a toolchain, or execute tool outputs, ensuring\nbroad coverage of interaction scenarios independent of inter-tool complexity.\nAt the execution level, a continuously evolving Tool World Navigation Model\n(TWNM) encodes structural and behavioral relations among tools, guiding the\nagent to generate scalable and robust invocation sequences. By incorporating\nfeedback from real tool interactions, NaviAgent supports closed-loop\noptimization of planning and execution, moving beyond tool calling toward\nadaptive navigation of large-scale tool ecosystems.

It\nalso uncovers undesirable reasoning patterns, such as low consistency and high\nuncertainty. Additionally, users can adapt LoT to a model that predicts the\nproperty they observe. We showcase this advantage by adapting LoT to a\nlightweight verifier that evaluates the correctness of trajectories.\nEmpirically, this verifier boosts the reasoning accuracy and the test-time\nscaling effect. The code is publicly available at:\nhttps://github.com/tmlr-group/landscape-of-thoughts."

Third, from the\nexperiment distilling teacher responses to in-distribution problems, we find\nthat capability does not always improve with distillation. We conjecture that\ncapability improves only when new knowledge is introduced, whereas distilling\nreasoning patterns only improves accuracy but not capability, sacrificing\nperformance on the most difficult questions, similar to RLVR.

Besides plain\nmessaging, many services implement additional features such as delivery and\nread receipts informing a user when a message has successfully reached its\ntarget. This paper highlights that delivery receipts can pose significant\nprivacy risks to users. We use specifically crafted messages that trigger\ndelivery receipts allowing any user to be pinged without their knowledge or\nconsent. By using this technique at high frequency, we demonstrate how an\nattacker could extract private information such as the online and activity\nstatus of a victim, e.g., screen on/off. Moreover, we can infer the number of\ncurrently active user devices and their operating system, as well as launch\nresource exhaustion attacks, such as draining a user's battery or data\nallowance, all without generating any notification on the target side. Due to\nthe widespread adoption of vulnerable messengers (WhatsApp and Signal) and the\nfact that any user can be targeted simply by knowing their phone number, we\nargue for a design change to address this issue.",

                "summary": "Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, particularly Low-Rank\nAdaptation (LoRA), are indispensable for efficiently customizing Large Language\nModels (LLMs). However, vanilla LoRA suffers from slow convergence speed and\nknowledge forgetting problems. Recent studies have leveraged the power of\ndesigned LoRA initialization, to enhance the fine-tuning efficiency, or to\npreserve knowledge in the pre-trained LLM. However, none of these works can\naddress the two cases at the same time. To this end, we introduce\nSubspace-Constrained LoRA (SC-LoRA), a novel LoRA initialization framework\nengineered to navigate the trade-off between efficient fine-tuning and\nknowledge preservation.

                    "value": "Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, particularly Low-Rank\nAdaptation (LoRA), are indispensable for efficiently customizing Large Language\nModels (LLMs). However, vanilla LoRA suffers from slow convergence speed and\nknowledge forgetting problems. Recent studies have leveraged the power of\ndesigned LoRA initialization, to enhance the fine-tuning efficiency, or to\npreserve knowledge in the pre-trained LLM. However, none of these works can\naddress the two cases at the same time. To this end, we introduce\nSubspace-Constrained LoRA (SC-LoRA), a novel LoRA initialization framework\nengineered to navigate the trade-off between efficient fine-tuning and\nknowledge preservation. We achieve this by constraining the output of trainable\nLoRA adapters in a low-rank subspace, where the context information of\nfine-tuning data is most preserved while the context information of preserved\nknowledge is least retained, in a balanced way.

Yet\nachieving synergy in human-AI collaboration is not easy. Providing AI with\ndetailed information about a user's demographics, psychological attributes,\ndivergent thinking, and domain expertise may improve performance by scaffolding\nmore effective multi-turn interactions. We implemented a personalized LLM-based\nassistant, informed by users' psychometric profiles and an AI-guided interview\nabout their work style, to help users complete a marketing task for a fictional\nstartup. We randomized 331 participants to work with AI that was either generic\n(n = 116), partially personalized (n = 114), or fully personalized (n=101).\nParticipants working with personalized AI produce marketing campaigns of\nsignificantly higher quality and creativity, beyond what AI alone could have\nproduced. Compared to generic AI, personalized AI leads to higher self-reported\nlevels of assistance and feedback, while also increasing participant trust and\nconfidence. Causal mediation analysis shows that personalization improves\nperformance indirectly by enhancing collective memory, attention, and reasoning\nin the human-AI interaction. These findings provide a theory-driven framework\nin which personalization functions as external scaffolding that builds common\nground and shared partner models, reducing uncertainty and enhancing joint\ncognition. This informs the design of future AI assistants that maximize\nsynergy and support human creative potential while limiting negative\nhomogenization.",

Providing AI with\ndetailed information about a user's demographics, psychological attributes,\ndivergent thinking, and domain expertise may improve performance by scaffolding\nmore effective multi-turn interactions. We implemented a personalized LLM-based\nassistant, informed by users' psychometric profiles and an AI-guided interview\nabout their work style, to help users complete a marketing task for a fictional\nstartup. We randomized 331 participants to work with AI that was either generic\n(n = 116), partially personalized (n = 114), or fully personalized (n=101).\nParticipants working with personalized AI produce marketing campaigns of\nsignificantly higher quality and creativity, beyond what AI alone could have\nproduced. Compared to generic AI, personalized AI leads to higher self-reported\nlevels of assistance and feedback, while also increasing participant trust and\nconfidence. Causal mediation analysis shows that personalization improves\nperformance indirectly by enhancing collective memory, attention, and reasoning\nin the human-AI interaction. These findings provide a theory-driven framework\nin which personalization functions as external scaffolding that builds common\nground and shared partner models, reducing uncertainty and enhancing joint\ncognition. This informs the design of future AI assistants that maximize\nsynergy and support human creative potential while limiting negative\nhomogenization."

We introduce BEAT, the first framework to\ninject such visual backdoors into MLLM-based embodied agents using objects in\nthe environments as triggers. Unlike textual triggers, object triggers exhibit\nwide variation across viewpoints and lighting, making them difficult to implant\nreliably. BEAT addresses this challenge by (1) constructing a training set that\nspans diverse scenes, tasks, and trigger placements to expose agents to trigger\nvariability, and (2) introducing a two-stage training scheme that first applies\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT) and then our novel Contrastive Trigger Learning\n(CTL). CTL formulates trigger discrimination as preference learning between\ntrigger-present and trigger-free inputs, explicitly sharpening the decision\nboundaries to ensure precise backdoor activation. Across various embodied agent\nbenchmarks and MLLMs, BEAT achieves attack success rates up to 80%, while\nmaintaining strong benign task performance, and generalizes reliably to\nout-of-distribution trigger placements. Notably, compared to naive SFT, CTL\nboosts backdoor activation accuracy up to 39% under limited backdoor data.\nThese findings expose a critical yet unexplored security risk in MLLM-based\nembodied agents, underscoring the need for robust defenses before real-world\ndeployment.",

This method provides direct feedback on the model's\ncurrent knowledge, guiding it to align with domain-specific standards.\nExperiments in English-Brazilian Portuguese and English-Korean show that, by\nusing just 14.7k preference pairs, the model achieves performance close to that\nof a model trained on 160k+ samples with SFT, demonstrating significant data\nefficiency.

We present an empirical study on\napplying CPO to simulate a post-editing workflow for data-efficient domain\nadaptation. Our approach synthesizes preference pairs by treating the base\nmodel's own raw output as the 'rejected' translation and the human-approved TM\nentry as the 'chosen' one. This method provides direct feedback on the model's\ncurrent knowledge, guiding it to align with domain-specific standards.\nExperiments in English-Brazilian Portuguese and English-Korean show that, by\nusing just 14.7k preference pairs, the model achieves performance close to that\nof a model trained on 160k+ samples with SFT, demonstrating significant data\nefficiency. Although we showcase its effectiveness in MT, this application of\nCPO naturally generalizes to other generative tasks where a model's initial\ndrafts can serve as a contrastive signal against a golden reference."

However, these summaries often focus on\npatients' biology rather than their preferences, values, wishes, and concerns.\nTo achieve patient-centered care, we propose a new standard for Artificial\nIntelligence (AI) clinical summarization tasks: Patient-Centered Summaries\n(PCS). Our objective was to develop a framework to generate PCS that capture\npatient values and ensure clinical utility and to assess whether current\nopen-source LLMs can achieve human-level performance in this task. We used a\nmixed-methods process. Two Patient and Public Involvement groups (10 patients\nand 8 clinicians) in the United Kingdom participated in semi-structured\ninterviews exploring what personal and contextual information should be\nincluded in clinical summaries and how it should be structured for clinical\nuse.

However, these summaries often focus on\npatients' biology rather than their preferences, values, wishes, and concerns.\nTo achieve patient-centered care, we propose a new standard for Artificial\nIntelligence (AI) clinical summarization tasks: Patient-Centered Summaries\n(PCS). Our objective was to develop a framework to generate PCS that capture\npatient values and ensure clinical utility and to assess whether current\nopen-source LLMs can achieve human-level performance in this task. We used a\nmixed-methods process. Two Patient and Public Involvement groups (10 patients\nand 8 clinicians) in the United Kingdom participated in semi-structured\ninterviews exploring what personal and contextual information should be\nincluded in clinical summaries and how it should be structured for clinical\nuse.

In\nthis paper, we investigate the mechanisms behind these phenomena. First, we\ndemonstrate that RLVR struggles to improve capability as it focuses on\nimproving the accuracy of the easier questions to the detriment of the accuracy\nof the most difficult questions. Second, we show that RLVR does not merely\nincrease the success probability for the easier questions, but in our small\nmodel settings, produces quality responses that were absent in its original\noutput distribution. In addition, we show these responses are neither\nnoticeably longer nor feature more reflection-related keywords, underscoring\nthe need for more reliable indicators of response quality. Third, from the\nexperiment distilling teacher responses to in-distribution problems, we find\nthat capability does not always improve with distillation. We conjecture that\ncapability improves only when new knowledge is introduced, whereas distilling\nreasoning patterns only improves accuracy but not capability, sacrificing\nperformance on the most difficult questions, similar to RLVR. Together, these\nfindings offer a clearer understanding of how RLVR and distillation shape\nreasoning behavior in LLMs",

We perform comprehensive knowledge localization experiments on\nadvanced LLMs and find that Attn modules play a substantial role in factual\nknowledge storage and retrieval, especially in earlier layers. Based on these\ninsights, we propose IntAttn-Edit, a method that extends the associative memory\nparadigm to jointly update both MLP and Attn modules. Our approach uses a\nknowledge balancing strategy that allocates update magnitudes in proportion to\neach module's measured contribution to knowledge storage. Experiments on\nstandard benchmarks show that IntAttn-Edit achieves higher edit success, better\ngeneralization, and stronger knowledge preservation than prior methods.

However, vanilla LoRA suffers from slow convergence speed and\nknowledge forgetting problems. Recent studies have leveraged the power of\ndesigned LoRA initialization, to enhance the fine-tuning efficiency, or to\npreserve knowledge in the pre-trained LLM. However, none of these works can\naddress the two cases at the same time. To this end, we introduce\nSubspace-Constrained LoRA (SC-LoRA), a novel LoRA initialization framework\nengineered to navigate the trade-off between efficient fine-tuning and\nknowledge preservation. We achieve this by constraining the output of trainable\nLoRA adapters in a low-rank subspace, where the context information of\nfine-tuning data is most preserved while the context information of preserved\nknowledge is least retained, in a balanced way. Such constraint enables the\ntrainable weights to primarily focus on the main features of fine-tuning data\nwhile avoiding damaging the preserved knowledge features. We provide\ntheoretical analysis on our method, and conduct extensive experiments including\nsafety preservation and world knowledge preservation, on various downstream\ntasks. In our experiments, SC-LoRA succeeds in delivering superior fine-tuning\nperformance while markedly diminishing knowledge forgetting, surpassing\ncontemporary LoRA initialization methods.",

                    "value": "Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, particularly Low-Rank\nAdaptation (LoRA), are indispensable for efficiently customizing Large Language\nModels (LLMs). However, vanilla LoRA suffers from slow convergence speed and\nknowledge forgetting problems. Recent studies have leveraged the power of\ndesigned LoRA initialization, to enhance the fine-tuning efficiency, or to\npreserve knowledge in the pre-trained LLM. However, none of these works can\naddress the two cases at the same time. To this end, we introduce\nSubspace-Constrained LoRA (SC-LoRA), a novel LoRA initialization framework\nengineered to navigate the trade-off between efficient fine-tuning and\nknowledge preservation. We achieve this by constraining the output of trainable\nLoRA adapters in a low-rank subspace, where the context information of\nfine-tuning data is most preserved while the context information of preserved\nknowledge is least retained, in a balanced way. Such constraint enables the\ntrainable weights to primarily focus on the main features of fine-tuning data\nwhile avoiding damaging the preserved knowledge features. We provide\ntheoretical analysis on our method, and conduct extensive experiments including\nsafety preservation and world knowledge preservation, on various downstream\ntasks. In our experiments, SC-LoRA succeeds in delivering superior fine-tuning\nperformance while markedly diminishing knowledge forgetting, surpassing\ncontemporary LoRA initialization methods."

Here\nwe introduce and validate GATE (Geometrically Aligned Transfer Encoder) -- a\ngeneralizable AI framework that jointly learns 34 physicochemical properties\nspanning thermal, electrical, mechanical, and optical domains. By aligning\nthese properties within a shared geometric space, GATE captures cross-property\ncorrelations that reduce disjoint-property bias -- a key factor causing false\npositives in multi-criteria screening. To demonstrate its generalizable\nutility, GATE -- without any problem-specific model reconfiguration -- applied\nto the discovery of immersion cooling fluids for data centers, a stringent\nreal-world challenge defined by the Open Compute Project (OCP).

                    "value": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a powerful accelerator of\nmaterials discovery, yet most existing models remain problem-specific,\nrequiring additional data collection and retraining for each new property. Here\nwe introduce and validate GATE (Geometrically Aligned Transfer Encoder) -- a\ngeneralizable AI framework that jointly learns 34 physicochemical properties\nspanning thermal, electrical, mechanical, and optical domains. By aligning\nthese properties within a shared geometric space, GATE captures cross-property\ncorrelations that reduce disjoint-property bias -- a key factor causing false\npositives in multi-criteria screening. To demonstrate its generalizable\nutility, GATE -- without any problem-specific model reconfiguration -- applied\nto the discovery of immersion cooling fluids for data centers, a stringent\nreal-world challenge defined by the Open Compute Project (OCP).

Four were experimentally or literarily validated, showing\nstrong agreement with wet-lab measurements and performance comparable to or\nexceeding a commercial coolant.

To improve test accuracy of model\ngenerated code, we employ mutation testing to measure the effectiveness of the\ntest cases and we manually crafted new test cases for those test suites with\nlow mutation score. Our empirical evaluation on 10 state-of-the-art models\nshows that test argumentation is critical in improving the accuracy of the\nbenchmark and RepoMasterEval is able to report variance in model performance in\nreal-world scenarios. The deployment of RepoMasterEval also revealed that the\nbenchmark is useful to give accurate feedback during model training and the\nscore is in high correlation with the model's performance in practice."

This paper introduces a comprehensive solution to these\nchallenges. First, we present a novel framework for automatically generating\nlong (up to 10M tokens), coherent, and topically diverse conversations,\naccompanied by probing questions targeting a wide range of memory abilities.\nFrom this, we construct BEAM, a new benchmark comprising 100 conversations and\n2,000 validated questions. Second, to enhance model performance, we propose\nLIGHT-a framework inspired by human cognition that equips LLMs with three\ncomplementary memory systems: a long-term episodic memory, a short-term working\nmemory, and a scratchpad for accumulating salient facts. Our experiments on\nBEAM reveal that even LLMs with 1M token context windows (with and without\nretrieval-augmentation) struggle as dialogues lengthen. In contrast, LIGHT\nconsistently improves performance across various models, achieving an average\nimprovement of 3.5%-12.69% over the strongest baselines, depending on the\nbackbone LLM. An ablation study further confirms the contribution of each\nmemory component.",

Most prior work prioritizes visual fidelity while overlooking the need\nfor smaller, more efficient models suitable for real-world deployment. To\naddress this challenge, we propose a lightweight T2V framework, termed\nHummingbird, which prunes existing models and enhances visual quality through\nvisual feedback learning. Our approach reduces the size of the U-Net from 1.4\nbillion to 0.7 billion parameters, significantly improving efficiency while\npreserving high-quality video generation. Additionally, we introduce a novel\ndata processing pipeline that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and Video\nQuality Assessment (VQA) models to enhance the quality of both text prompts and\nvideo data. To support user-driven training and style customization, we\npublicly release the full training code, including data processing and model\ntraining. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves a 31X speedup\ncompared to state-of-the-art models such as VideoCrafter2, while also attaining\nthe highest overall score on VBench. Moreover, our method supports the\ngeneration of videos with up to 26 frames, addressing the limitations of\nexisting U-Net-based methods in long video generation.

It\ncontributes to the community in four aspects: (1) a highly customizable\nbenchmarking framework for in-depth comparison and analysis of LLMs; (2) an\nextendable task design strategy spanning static and dynamic mechanics across\nmultiple difficulty tiers; (3) a 3D Spatial Geometric Computation Library for\nsupporting construction based on language instructions; (4) a baseline LLM\nagentic workflow that effectively evaluates diverse model capabilities. On\neight frontier LLMs, BuildArena comprehensively evaluates their capabilities\nfor language-driven and physics-grounded construction automation. The project\npage is at https://build-arena.github.io/."

While developing build scripts,\npractitioners may inadvertently introduce code smells, which are recurring\npatterns of poor coding practices that may lead to build failures or increase\nrisk and technical debt. The goal of this study is to aid practitioners in\navoiding code smells in build scripts through an empirical study of build\nscripts and issues on GitHub.We employed a mixed-methods approach, combining\nqualitative and quantitative analysis. First, we conducted a qualitative\nanalysis of 2000 build-script-related GitHub issues to understand recurring\nsmells. Next, we developed a static analysis tool, Sniffer, to automatically\ndetect code smells in 5882 build scripts of Maven, Gradle, CMake, and Make\nfiles, collected from 4877 open-source GitHub repositories. To assess Sniffer's\nperformance, we conducted a user study, where Sniffer achieved higher\nprecision, recall, and F-score. We identified 13 code smell categories, with a\ntotal of 10,895 smell occurrences, where 3184 were in Maven, 1214 in Gradle,\n337 in CMake, and 6160 in Makefiles. Our analysis revealed that Insecure URLs\nwere the most prevalent code smell in Maven build scripts, while\nHardcodedPaths/URLs were commonly observed in both Gradle and CMake scripts.\nWildcard Usage emerged as the most frequent smell in Makefiles. The\nco-occurrence analysis revealed strong associations between specific smell\npairs of Hardcoded Paths/URLs with Duplicates, and Inconsistent Dependency\nManagement with Empty or Incomplete Tags, which indicate potential underlying\nissues in the build script structure and maintenance practices.",
