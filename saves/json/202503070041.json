Prior video models already generate realistic videos,\nbut they tend to leverage little 3D information, leading to inconsistencies,\nsuch as objects popping in and out of existence. Camera control, if implemented\nat all, is imprecise, because camera parameters are mere inputs to the neural\nnetwork which must then infer how the video depends on the camera. In contrast,\nGEN3C is guided by a 3D cache: point clouds obtained by predicting the\npixel-wise depth of seed images or previously generated frames. When generating\nthe next frames, GEN3C is conditioned on the 2D renderings of the 3D cache with\nthe new camera trajectory provided by the user. Crucially, this means that\nGEN3C neither has to remember what it previously generated nor does it have to\ninfer the image structure from the camera pose. The model, instead, can focus\nall its generative power on previously unobserved regions, as well as advancing\nthe scene state to the next frame. Our results demonstrate more precise camera\ncontrol than prior work, as well as state-of-the-art results in sparse-view\nnovel view synthesis, even in challenging settings such as driving scenes and\nmonocular dynamic video.

A key challenge in LLM inference is the management of the\nKey-Value (KV) cache, which reduces redundant computations but introduces\nmemory constraints. In this work, we model LLM inference with KV cache\nconstraints theoretically and propose novel batching and scheduling algorithms\nthat minimize inference latency while effectively managing the KV cache's\nmemory.\n  We analyze both semi-online and fully online scheduling models, and our\nresults are threefold. First, we provide a polynomial-time algorithm that\nachieves exact optimality in terms of average latency in the semi-online prompt\narrival model. Second, in the fully online case with a stochastic prompt\narrival, we introduce an efficient online scheduling algorithm with constant\nregret. Third, we prove that no algorithm (deterministic or randomized) can\nachieve a constant competitive ratio in fully online adversarial settings. Our\nempirical evaluations on a public LLM inference dataset, using the Llama-70B\nmodel on A100 GPUs, show that our approach significantly outperforms benchmark\nalgorithms used currently in practice, achieving lower latency while reducing\nenergy consumption. Overall, our results offer a path toward more sustainable\nand cost-effective LLM deployment.",

EliteKV first identifies the intrinsic frequency preference\nof each head using RoPElite, selectively restoring linearity to certain\ndimensions of key within attention computation. Building on this, joint\nlow-rank compression of key and value enables partial cache sharing.\nExperimental results show that with minimal uptraining on only $0.6\\%$ of the\noriginal training data, RoPE-based models achieve a $75\\%$ reduction in KV\ncache size while preserving performance within a negligible margin.\nFurthermore, EliteKV consistently performs well across models of different\nscales within the same family.",

This paper introduces EliteKV, a flexible\nmodification framework for RoPE-based models supporting variable KV cache\ncompression ratios. EliteKV first identifies the intrinsic frequency preference\nof each head using RoPElite, selectively restoring linearity to certain\ndimensions of key within attention computation. Building on this, joint\nlow-rank compression of key and value enables partial cache sharing.\nExperimental results show that with minimal uptraining on only $0.6\\%$ of the\noriginal training data, RoPE-based models achieve a $75\\%$ reduction in KV\ncache size while preserving performance within a negligible margin.\nFurthermore, EliteKV consistently performs well across models of different\nscales within the same family."

                "summary": "Language Models (LMs) assign significant attention to the first token, even\nif it is not semantically important, which is known as attention sink. This\nphenomenon has been widely adopted in applications such as streaming/long\ncontext generation, KV cache optimization, inference acceleration, model\nquantization, and others. Despite its widespread use, a deep understanding of\nattention sink in LMs is still lacking. In this work, we first demonstrate that\nattention sinks exist universally in LMs with various inputs, even in small\nmodels. Furthermore, attention sink is observed to emerge during the LM\npre-training, motivating us to investigate how optimization, data distribution,\nloss function, and model architecture in LM pre-training influence its\nemergence. We highlight that attention sink emerges after effective\noptimization on sufficient training data. The sink position is highly\ncorrelated with the loss function and data distribution. Most importantly, we\nfind that attention sink acts more like key biases, storing extra attention\nscores, which could be non-informative and not contribute to the value\ncomputation.

After relaxing such dependence by replacing softmax attention\nwith other attention operations, such as sigmoid attention without\nnormalization, attention sinks do not emerge in LMs up to 1B parameters.

This\nphenomenon has been widely adopted in applications such as streaming/long\ncontext generation, KV cache optimization, inference acceleration, model\nquantization, and others. Despite its widespread use, a deep understanding of\nattention sink in LMs is still lacking. In this work, we first demonstrate that\nattention sinks exist universally in LMs with various inputs, even in small\nmodels. Furthermore, attention sink is observed to emerge during the LM\npre-training, motivating us to investigate how optimization, data distribution,\nloss function, and model architecture in LM pre-training influence its\nemergence.

These tools offer benefits such as\nreduced development time and enhanced performance. However, achieving\nhigh-quality results often requires additional manual code transformations and\ntiling selections, which are typically performed separately or as\npre-processing steps. Although DSE techniques enable code transformation\nupfront, the vastness of the search space often limits the exploration of all\npossible code transformations, making it challenging to determine which\ntransformations are necessary. Additionally, ensuring correctness remains\nchallenging, especially for complex transformations and optimizations.\n  To tackle this obstacle, we first propose a comprehensive framework\nleveraging HLS compilers.

                    "value": "High-level synthesis, source-to-source compilers, and various Design Space\nExploration techniques for pragma insertion have significantly improved the\nQuality of Results of generated designs. These tools offer benefits such as\nreduced development time and enhanced performance. However, achieving\nhigh-quality results often requires additional manual code transformations and\ntiling selections, which are typically performed separately or as\npre-processing steps. Although DSE techniques enable code transformation\nupfront, the vastness of the search space often limits the exploration of all\npossible code transformations, making it challenging to determine which\ntransformations are necessary. Additionally, ensuring correctness remains\nchallenging, especially for complex transformations and optimizations.\n  To tackle this obstacle, we first propose a comprehensive framework\nleveraging HLS compilers.

                "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have been widely adopted due to their remarkable\nperformance across various applications, driving the accelerated development of\na large number of diverse models. However, these individual LLMs show\nlimitations in generalization and performance on complex tasks due to inherent\ntraining biases, model size constraints, and the quality or diversity of\npre-training datasets. A promising direction is to efficiently harness the\ndiverse capabilities of LLMs to overcome these individual limitations. To\naddress these limitations, we introduce a novel LLM selection algorithm called\nSelectLLM, which efficiently directs input queries to the most suitable subset\nof LLMs from a large pool, ensuring that the selected models collectively\nprovide accurate responses. SelectLLM employs a multi-label classifier and\npolicy based on the classifier's predictions and confidence scores in selecting\nan optimal, query-aware, and lightweight subset of LLMs. Our findings indicate\nthat the proposed model outperforms existing ensemble-based baselines and\nachieves competitive performance with similarly sized top-performing LLMs while\nmaintaining efficiency. Specifically, it achieves a huge reduction in inference\nlatency on two challenging reasoning benchmarks: 13% on GSM8K and 70% on MMLU,\ncompared to the top-performing baseline. Also, we establish a theoretical upper\nbound by an Oracle with LLMs and perform an in-depth linguistic analysis to\nunderstand the performance gap between the Oracle and SelectLLM.",

This result applies to AoT compilers as well as JIT compilers."

However, self-attention initially plays a minor role but becomes\ncrucial in the second phase. These findings yield a simple and training-free\nmethod known as temporally gating the attention (TGATE), which efficiently\ngenerates images by caching and reusing attention outputs at scheduled time\nsteps. Experimental results show when widely applied to various existing\ntext-conditional diffusion models, TGATE accelerates these models by 10%-50%.\nThe code of TGATE is available at https://github.com/HaozheLiu-ST/T-GATE.",

The recent algorithmic advancement proposes a fine-grained\ngroup-wise quantization for LLMs, which treats a small set (e.g., 64) of values\nin a tensor as a compression unit. It effectively preserves the model accuracy\nwithout retraining, and has become the standard approach to efficiently deploy\nLLMs. On the other hand, there are works that propose various adaptive data\ntypes to better adapt to different distributions and further reduce the\nrequired bit length for LLMs. In this work, our detailed analysis unveils a key\nfinding that while different tensors exhibit similar distributions, small\ngroups can have markedly different distributions. As such, the group-level\ndiversity requires a new level of adaptivity for which existing adaptive data\ntypes fail to provide.\n  In this paper, we propose MANT, a mathematically adaptive numeric type,\nfeaturing a more flexible encoding paradigm with a wider range of data\ndistribution and more efficient decodingcomputation fusion mechanism to address\nthese challenges. Based on MANT, we develop a supporting framework to assign\nthe appropriate data type for each group adaptively. Meanwhile, the dynamically\ngenerated Key-Value (KV) caches in LLMs introduce further complexity for\nreal-time quantization. To tackle this, we propose an efficient real-time\nquantization mechanism. Besides, we implement a specific processing element\n(PE) to efficiently support MANT and incorporate a real-time quantization unit.\nBy integrating these components into a systolic array, MANT unifies the\ngroup-wise weight and KV cache quantization and addresses the associated\nchallenges. Our evaluation shows achieving, on average, 2.99x (up to 4.46x)\nspeedup and 2.81x (up to 4.10x) energy reduction to the state-of-the-art LLM\naccelerator.",

Second, AW eliminates the flush latency overhead (several\ntens of microseconds) of the L1/L2 caches when entering a deep idle power state\nby keeping L1/L2 cache content power-ungated. A minimal control logic also\nremains power-ungated to serve cache coherence traffic (i.e., snoops)\nseamlessly. AW implements sleep-mode in caches to reduce caches leakage power\nconsumption and lowers a core voltage to the minimum operational voltage level\nto minimize the leakage power of the power-ungated domain. Third, using a\nstate-of-the-art power efficient all-digital phase-locked loop (ADPLL) clock\ngenerator, AW keeps the PLL active and locked during the idle state, further\ncutting precious microseconds of wake-up latency at a negligible power cost.\nOur evaluation with an accurate simulator calibrated against an Intel Skylake\nserver shows that AW reduces the energy consumption of Memcached by up to 71%\n(35% on average) with up to 1% performance degradation.",

In this work, we have\nidentified a key pattern: certain seemingly meaningless separator tokens (i.e.,\npunctuations) contribute disproportionately to attention scores compared to\nsemantically meaningful tokens. This observation suggests that information of\nthe segments between these separator tokens can be effectively condensed into\nthe separator tokens themselves without significant information loss. Guided by\nthis insight, we introduce SepLLM, a plug-and-play framework that accelerates\ninference by compressing these segments and eliminating redundant tokens.\nAdditionally, we implement efficient kernels for training acceleration.\nExperimental results across training-free, training-from-scratch, and\npost-training settings demonstrate SepLLM's effectiveness. Notably, using the\nLlama-3-8B backbone, SepLLM achieves over 50% reduction in KV cache on the\nGSM8K-CoT benchmark while maintaining comparable performance.

A CPU+GPU\nasynchronous meta-meshing pipeline has been developed to efficiently generate\nmeta-meshes from lattice structures. It shifts from the thread-centric GPU\nalgorithm design paradigm commonly used in CAD to the recent warp-centric\ndesign paradigm to achieve high performance. This is achieved by a new data\ncompression method, a GPU cache-aware data structure, and a workload-balanced\nscheduling method that can significantly reduce memory divergence and branch\ndivergence.

A CPU+GPU\nasynchronous meta-meshing pipeline has been developed to efficiently generate\nmeta-meshes from lattice structures. It shifts from the thread-centric GPU\nalgorithm design paradigm commonly used in CAD to the recent warp-centric\ndesign paradigm to achieve high performance. This is achieved by a new data\ncompression method, a GPU cache-aware data structure, and a workload-balanced\nscheduling method that can significantly reduce memory divergence and branch\ndivergence. Experimenting with various billion-scale lattice structures, the\nproposed method is seen to be two orders of magnitude faster than previously\nachievable."

To mitigate the performance degradation of LLMs\nwhen using KV caches computed independently for each document, KVLink\nintroduces three key components: adjusting positional embeddings of the KV\ncache at inference to match the global position after concatenation, using\ntrainable special tokens to restore self-attention across independently encoded\ndocuments, and applying mixed-data fine-tuning to enhance performance while\npreserving the model's original capabilities. Experiments across 7 datasets\ndemonstrate that KVLink improves question answering accuracy by an average of\n4% over state-of-the-art methods.

Classic solutions\neither replace the original text with a compressed representation, e.g., the\nFM-index and its variants, or keep it uncompressed but attach some redundancy -\nan index - to accelerate matching. The former solutions thus retain excellent\ncompressed space, but areslow in practice. The latter approaches, like the\nsuffix array, instead sacrifice space for speed.\n  We show that efficient text indexing can be achieved using just a small extra\nspace on top of the original text, provided that the query patterns are\nsufficiently long. More specifically, we develop a new indexing paradigm in\nwhich a sketch of a query pattern is first matched against a sketch of the\ntext. Once candidate matches are retrieved, they are verified using the\noriginal text. This paradigm is thus universal in the sense that it allows us\nto use any solution to index the sketched text, like a suffix array, FM-index,\nor r-index.\n  We explore both the theory and the practice of this universal framework. With\nan extensive experimental analysis, we show that, surprisingly, universal\nindexes can be constructed much faster than their unsketched counterparts and\ntake a fraction of the space, as a direct consequence of (i) having a lower\nbound on the length of patterns and (ii) working in sketch space. Furthermore,\nthese data structures have the potential of retaining or even improving query\ntime, because matching against the sketched text is faster and verifying\ncandidates can be theoretically done in constant time per occurrence (or, in\npractice, by short and cache-friendly scans of the text). Finally, we discuss\nsome important applications of this novel indexing paradigm to computational\nbiology. We hypothesize that such indexes will be particularly effective when\nthe queries are sufficiently long, and so demonstrate applications in long-read\nmapping.",

                "summary": "This paper introduces an information-aware quantization framework that\nadaptively compresses the key-value (KV) cache in large language models (LLMs).\nAlthough prior work has underscored the distinct roles of key and value cache\nduring inference, our systematic analysis -- examining singular value\ndistributions, spectral norms, and Frobenius norms -- reveals, for the first\ntime, that key matrices consistently exhibit higher norm values and are more\nsensitive to quantization than value matrices. Furthermore, our theoretical\nanalysis shows that matrices with higher spectral norms amplify quantization\nerrors more significantly. Motivated by these insights, we propose a\nmixed-precision quantization strategy, KV-AdaQuant, which allocates more\nbit-width for keys and fewer for values since key matrices have higher norm\nvalues.

                    "value": "This paper introduces an information-aware quantization framework that\nadaptively compresses the key-value (KV) cache in large language models (LLMs).\nAlthough prior work has underscored the distinct roles of key and value cache\nduring inference, our systematic analysis -- examining singular value\ndistributions, spectral norms, and Frobenius norms -- reveals, for the first\ntime, that key matrices consistently exhibit higher norm values and are more\nsensitive to quantization than value matrices. Furthermore, our theoretical\nanalysis shows that matrices with higher spectral norms amplify quantization\nerrors more significantly. Motivated by these insights, we propose a\nmixed-precision quantization strategy, KV-AdaQuant, which allocates more\nbit-width for keys and fewer for values since key matrices have higher norm\nvalues.

While rotary position embeddings (RoPEs) enhance length generalization,\neffective length extrapolation remains challenging and often requires costly\nfine-tuning. In contrast, recent training-free approaches suffer from the\nattention sink phenomenon, leading to severe performance degradation. In this\npaper, we introduce ParallelComp, a novel training-free method for long-context\nextrapolation that extends LLMs' context length from 4K to 128K while\nmaintaining high throughput and preserving perplexity, and integrates\nseamlessly with Flash Attention. Our analysis offers new insights into\nattention biases in parallel attention mechanisms and provides practical\nsolutions to tackle these challenges. To mitigate the attention sink issue, we\npropose an attention calibration strategy that reduces biases, ensuring more\nstable long-range attention. Additionally, we introduce a chunk eviction\nstrategy to efficiently manage ultra-long contexts on a single A100 80GB GPU.\nTo further enhance efficiency, we propose a parallel KV cache eviction\ntechnique, which improves chunk throughput by 1.76x, thereby achieving a 23.50x\nacceleration in the prefilling stage with negligible performance loss due to\nattention calibration. Furthermore, ParallelComp achieves 91.17% of GPT-4's\nperformance on long-context tasks using an 8B model trained on 8K-length\ncontext, outperforming powerful closed-source models such as Claude-2 and\nKimi-Chat.",

However, simply adopting an existing 4-level page table in NDP systems\ncauses significant address translation overhead because (1) NDP applications\ngenerate a lot of address translations, and (2) the limited L1 cache in NDP\nsystems cannot cover the accesses to page table entries (PTEs). We extensively\nanalyze the 4-level page table design in the NDP scenario and observe that (1)\nthe memory access to page table entries is highly irregular, thus cannot\nbenefit from the L1 cache, and (2) the last two levels of page tables are\nnearly fully occupied. Based on our observations, we propose NDPage, an\nefficient page table design tailored for NDP systems. The key mechanisms of\nNDPage are (1) an L1 cache bypass mechanism for PTEs that not only accelerates\nthe memory accesses of PTEs but also prevents the pollution of PTEs in the\ncache system, and (2) a flattened page table design that merges the last two\nlevels of page tables, allowing the page table to enjoy the flexibility of a\n4KB page while reducing the number of PTE accesses. We evaluate NDPage using a\nvariety of data-intensive workloads. Our evaluation shows that in a single-core\nNDP system, NDPage improves the end-to-end performance over the\nstate-of-the-art address translation mechanism of 14.3\\%; in 4-core and 8-core\nNDP systems, NDPage enhances the performance of 9.8\\% and 30.5\\%, respectively.",

Rather than optimising memory\npatterns with high overhead and poor portability, NVR adapts runahead execution\nto the unique architecture of NPUs. NVR provides a general micro-architectural\nsolution for sparse DNN workloads without requiring compiler or algorithmic\nsupport, operating as a decoupled, speculative, lightweight hardware sub-thread\nalongside the NPU, with minimal hardware overhead (under 5%). NVR achieves an\naverage 90% reduction in cache misses compared to SOTA prefetching in\ngeneral-purpose processors, delivering 4x average speedup on sparse workloads\nversus NPUs without prefetching. Moreover, we investigate the advantages of\nincorporating a small cache (16KB) into the NPU combined with NVR.

One promising approach\nfor test-time compute scaling is search against a process reward model, where a\nmodel generates multiple potential candidates at each step of the search, and\nthese partial trajectories are then scored by a separate reward model in order\nto guide the search process. The diversity of trajectories in the tree search\nprocess affects the accuracy of the search, since increasing diversity promotes\nmore exploration.

We address this challenge by proposing Efficient Tree Search (ETS),\nwhich promotes KV sharing by pruning redundant trajectories while maintaining\nnecessary diverse trajectories.

In this paper, we propose FairKV, a method\ndesigned to ensure fair memory usage among attention heads in systems employing\nimbalanced KV cache compression. The core technique of FairKV is Fair-Copying,\nwhich replicates a small subset of memory-intensive attention heads across GPUs\nusing data parallelism to mitigate load imbalance.

Prior video models already generate realistic videos,\nbut they tend to leverage little 3D information, leading to inconsistencies,\nsuch as objects popping in and out of existence. Camera control, if implemented\nat all, is imprecise, because camera parameters are mere inputs to the neural\nnetwork which must then infer how the video depends on the camera. In contrast,\nGEN3C is guided by a 3D cache: point clouds obtained by predicting the\npixel-wise depth of seed images or previously generated frames. When generating\nthe next frames, GEN3C is conditioned on the 2D renderings of the 3D cache with\nthe new camera trajectory provided by the user. Crucially, this means that\nGEN3C neither has to remember what it previously generated nor does it have to\ninfer the image structure from the camera pose. The model, instead, can focus\nall its generative power on previously unobserved regions, as well as advancing\nthe scene state to the next frame. Our results demonstrate more precise camera\ncontrol than prior work, as well as state-of-the-art results in sparse-view\nnovel view synthesis, even in challenging settings such as driving scenes and\nmonocular dynamic video.

Direct preference optimization\n(DPO), a widely deployed alignment method, exhibits limitations in both\nexperimental and theoretical contexts as its loss function proves suboptimal\nfor refusal learning. Through gradient-based analysis, we identify these\nshortcomings and propose an improved safety alignment that disentangles DPO\nobjectives into two components: (1) robust refusal training, which encourages\nrefusal even when partial unsafe generations are produced, and (2) targeted\nunlearning of harmful knowledge. This approach significantly increases LLM\nrobustness against a wide range of jailbreak attacks, including prefilling,\nsuffix, and multi-turn attacks across both in-distribution and\nout-of-distribution scenarios. Furthermore, we introduce a method to emphasize\ncritical refusal tokens by incorporating a reward-based token-level weighting\nmechanism for refusal learning, which further improves the robustness against\nadversarial exploits. Our research also suggests that robustness to jailbreak\nattacks is correlated with token distribution shifts in the training process\nand internal representations of refusal and harmful tokens, offering valuable\ndirections for future research in LLM safety alignment.

This approach significantly increases LLM\nrobustness against a wide range of jailbreak attacks, including prefilling,\nsuffix, and multi-turn attacks across both in-distribution and\nout-of-distribution scenarios. Furthermore, we introduce a method to emphasize\ncritical refusal tokens by incorporating a reward-based token-level weighting\nmechanism for refusal learning, which further improves the robustness against\nadversarial exploits. Our research also suggests that robustness to jailbreak\nattacks is correlated with token distribution shifts in the training process\nand internal representations of refusal and harmful tokens, offering valuable\ndirections for future research in LLM safety alignment.

Despite understanding the production mechanism of these\nneutrinos, the lack of direct observations raises questions about particle\nacceleration efficiency and the involved astrophysical conditions. This study\nfocuses on neutrino emission from H-rich SNe with low-mass CSM, such as SN\n2023ixf. We developed a semi-analytical model to characterize the progenitor\nand CSM at the explosion time, allowing us to infer the expected neutrino flux\nat Earth during the SN's interaction phase. Our model shows that neutrino\nemission depends not only on shock velocity and CSM mass but also on the\nspatial matter distribution of the CSM. By analysing the bolometric light curve\nof SN 2023ixf beyond 100 days post-explosion, we find that its ejecta,\nconsisting of $9\\,\\text{M}_{\\rm \\odot}$ (including $0.07\\,\\text{M}_{\\rm \\odot}$\nof radioactive $^{56}$Ni) and having a kinetic energy of $1.8\\,\\text{foe}$,\ncollides with a low-mass CSM of $0.06\\,\\text{M}_{\\rm \\odot}$ distributed\naccording to a power-law density profile with an exponent of $s=2.9$. Through\nthese parameters, we estimate that up to $4\\pm1\\times 10^{-2}$ muon\n(anti-)neutrino events could be detected by IceCube within 50 days\npost-explosion. Although the predicted flux ($\\lesssim 3\\times\n10^{-9}\\,\\text{GeV} \\, \\text{cm}^{-2} \\, \\text{s}^{-1}$) is below current\nIceCube sensitivity, future telescopes like IceCube-Gen2 and KM3NeT could\ndetect HE-$\\nu$ from similar SN events.",

We developed a semi-analytical model to characterize the progenitor\nand CSM at the explosion time, allowing us to infer the expected neutrino flux\nat Earth during the SN's interaction phase. Our model shows that neutrino\nemission depends not only on shock velocity and CSM mass but also on the\nspatial matter distribution of the CSM. By analysing the bolometric light curve\nof SN 2023ixf beyond 100 days post-explosion, we find that its ejecta,\nconsisting of $9\\,\\text{M}_{\\rm \\odot}$ (including $0.07\\,\\text{M}_{\\rm \\odot}$\nof radioactive $^{56}$Ni) and having a kinetic energy of $1.8\\,\\text{foe}$,\ncollides with a low-mass CSM of $0.06\\,\\text{M}_{\\rm \\odot}$ distributed\naccording to a power-law density profile with an exponent of $s=2.9$. Through\nthese parameters, we estimate that up to $4\\pm1\\times 10^{-2}$ muon\n(anti-)neutrino events could be detected by IceCube within 50 days\npost-explosion. Although the predicted flux ($\\lesssim 3\\times\n10^{-9}\\,\\text{GeV} \\, \\text{cm}^{-2} \\, \\text{s}^{-1}$) is below current\nIceCube sensitivity, future telescopes like IceCube-Gen2 and KM3NeT could\ndetect HE-$\\nu$ from similar SN events."

Our work\nattempts to shed light on the properties of prominences by using observations\nat high polarimetric sensitivity in the He I D3 multiplet taken with the Zurich\nImaging Polarimeter-3 instrument at the Istituto ricerche solari Aldo e Cele\nDacco observatory. We used the HAZEL inversion code to infer the thermodynamic\nand magnetic properties of an active region prominence, assuming one- and\ntwo-component models. Our observations unveil a great diversity of physical\nconditions in the prominence. The observed Stokes profiles are usually broad\nand show interesting features, which can be described assuming a two-component\nmodel. The contribution of each component and the trends inferred for some\nparameters vary with the distance to the solar limb. While both components have\nanalogous properties and contribute similarly close to the limb, a major\ncomponent mainly describes the properties inferred at 10-40 arcsecs away from\nthe limb. Moreover, both components usually show significant differences in\nthermal broadening, which is essential for ensuring a good fit quality between\nobservations and synthetic profiles. Summarizing, the observed region of the\nprominence shows line-of-sight velocities of 1-3 km/s and rather horizontal\nfields of 20-80 gauss. We also report hints of a twist close to a prominence\nfoot and changes in the magnetic configuration at specific locations. Our\nresults indicate a mainly horizontal magnetic field of a few tens of gauss in\nthe prominence.

Traditional MARL algorithms often require interacting with the\nenvironment for millions of steps to train a parametric model, of which the\nresulting policies are typically non-interpretable with weak transferability.\nIn this paper, we introduce SMAC-R1 which is based on the Qwen2.5-7B-Base LLM\ndistilled from DeepSeek-Coder-v2.5-236B. Similar to online reinforcement\nlearning after behavior cloning in offline learning process, in our pipeline,\nagents leverage the DeepSeek LLM to generate decision tree code by providing\ntask descriptions, and the agents are further self-reflected using feedback\nfrom the rewards provided by the environment. Based on that, we augment the\ngenerated scripts to fine-tune a small LLM, Qwen2.5-7B-Base, to distill the\ndecision-making ability via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and enhance the script\ngeneration ability by the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm.\nWe conduct experiments in the original 23 SMAC tasks and 10 newly-designed\ntasks to demonstrate that our method can produce high-quality, interpretable\ndecision trees with minimal environmental exploration. Moreover, these scripts\nexhibit strong transferability, successfully applying to homogeneous SMAC\nenvironments without modification. We believe this approach offers a new\ndirection for solving decision-making tasks and domain-specific LLM training\npipelines in the future.",

While significant progress has been made using commercial large\nlanguage models (LLMs) as research assistants or idea generators, the\npossibility of automating the entire research process with open-source LLMs\nremains largely unexplored. This paper explores the feasibility of using\nopen-source post-trained LLMs as autonomous agents capable of performing the\nfull cycle of automated research and review, from literature review and\nmanuscript preparation to peer review and paper refinement. Our iterative\npreference training framework consists of CycleResearcher, which conducts\nresearch tasks, and CycleReviewer, which simulates the peer review process,\nproviding iterative feedback via reinforcement learning. To train these models,\nwe develop two new datasets, Review-5k and Research-14k, reflecting real-world\nmachine learning research and peer review dynamics. Our results demonstrate\nthat CycleReviewer achieves promising performance with a 26.89\\% reduction in\nmean absolute error (MAE) compared to individual human reviewers in predicting\npaper scores, indicating the potential of LLMs to effectively assist\nexpert-level research evaluation. In research, the papers generated by the\nCycleResearcher model achieved a score of 5.36 in simulated peer reviews,\nshowing some competitiveness in terms of simulated review scores compared to\nthe preprint level of 5.24 from human experts, while still having room for\nimprovement compared to the accepted paper level of 5.69.

The\ndataset, the SHQ-NPOV dataset, comprises 300 high-quality, human-written\nquadruplets: a query on a sensitive topic, an answer, an NPOV rating, and a set\nof links to source texts elaborating the various points of view. The first key\ncontribution of this paper is a new methodology to create such datasets through\niterative rounds of human peer-critique and annotator training, which we\nrelease alongside the dataset. The second key contribution is the\nidentification of a highly effective training regime for parameter-efficient\nreinforcement learning (PE-RL) to improve NPOV generation. We compare and\nextensively evaluate PE-RL and multiple baselines-including LoRA finetuning (a\nstrong baseline), SFT and RLHF.\n  PE-RL not only improves on overall NPOV quality compared to the strongest\nbaseline ($97.06\\%\\rightarrow 99.08\\%$), but also scores much higher on\nfeatures linguists identify as key to separating good answers from the best\nanswers ($60.25\\%\\rightarrow 85.21\\%$ for presence of supportive details,\n$68.74\\%\\rightarrow 91.43\\%$ for absence of oversimplification). A qualitative\nanalysis corroborates this. Finally, our evaluation finds no statistical\ndifferences between results on topics that appear in the training dataset and\nthose on separated evaluation topics, which provides strong evidence that our\napproach to training PE-RL exhibits very effective out of topic generalization.",

The potential of\nLLMs in software programming has sparked significant interest in exploring\nautomated hardware generation and automation. Although preliminary endeavors\nhave been made to adopt LLMs in generating hardware description languages\n(HDLs), several challenges persist in this direction.

However, we observe that little research has looked into how it\nworks. In this work, we first visualize the similarity maps, which are obtained\nby computing the semantic similarity between the $\\texttt{<SEG>}$ token and the\nimage token embeddings derived from the last hidden layer in both the LLaVA\nencoder and SAM decoder. Intriguingly, we have found that a striking\nconsistency holds in terms of activation responses in the similarity map,which\nreveals that what $\\texttt{<SEG>}$ token contributes to is the semantic\nsimilarity within image-text pairs. Specifically, $\\texttt{<SEG>}$ token, a\nplaceholder expanded in text vocabulary, extensively queries among individual\ntokenized image patches to match the semantics of an object from text to the\npaired image while the Large Language Models (LLMs) are being fine-tuned. Upon\nthe above findings, we present READ, which facilitates LMMs' resilient\n$\\textbf{REA}$soning capability of where to atten$\\textbf{D}$ under the\nguidance of highly activated points borrowed from similarity maps. Remarkably,\nREAD features an intuitive design, Similarity as Points module (SasP), which\ncan be seamlessly applied to $\\texttt{<SEG>}$-like paradigms in a plug-and-play\nfashion. Also, extensive experiments have been conducted on the ReasonSeg and\nRefCOCO(+/g) datasets. To validate whether READ suffers from catastrophic\nforgetting of previous skills after fine-tuning, we further assess its\ngeneration ability on an augmented FP-RefCOCO(+/g) dataset.

Specifically, $\\texttt{<SEG>}$ token, a\nplaceholder expanded in text vocabulary, extensively queries among individual\ntokenized image patches to match the semantics of an object from text to the\npaired image while the Large Language Models (LLMs) are being fine-tuned. Upon\nthe above findings, we present READ, which facilitates LMMs' resilient\n$\\textbf{REA}$soning capability of where to atten$\\textbf{D}$ under the\nguidance of highly activated points borrowed from similarity maps. Remarkably,\nREAD features an intuitive design, Similarity as Points module (SasP), which\ncan be seamlessly applied to $\\texttt{<SEG>}$-like paradigms in a plug-and-play\nfashion. Also, extensive experiments have been conducted on the ReasonSeg and\nRefCOCO(+/g) datasets. To validate whether READ suffers from catastrophic\nforgetting of previous skills after fine-tuning, we further assess its\ngeneration ability on an augmented FP-RefCOCO(+/g) dataset.

Sometimes guidelines make or require stronger causal\nclaims than those in the references they rely on, a phenomenon we refer to as\n'causal language jump'. We evaluated the strength of expressed causation in\ndiabetes guidelines and the evidence they reference to assess the pattern of\njumps. We randomly sampled 300 guideline statements from four diabetes\nguidelines. We rated the causation strength in the statements and the\ndependence on causation in recommendations supported by these statements using\nexisting scales. Among the causal statements, the cited original studies were\nsimilarly assessed. We also assessed how well they report target trial\nemulation (TTE) components as a proxy for reliability. Of the sampled\nstatements, 114 (38.0%) were causal, and 76 (66.7%) expressed strong causation.\n27.2% (31/114) of causal guideline statements demonstrated a \"causal language\njump\", and 34.9% (29/83) of guideline recommendations cannot be effectively\nsupported. Of the 53 eligible studies for TTE rating, most did not report\ntreatment assignment and causal contrast in detail. Our findings suggest causal\nlanguage jumps were common among diabetes guidelines. While these jumps are\nsometimes inevitable, they should always be supported by good causal inference\npractices.",

Sometimes guidelines make or require stronger causal\nclaims than those in the references they rely on, a phenomenon we refer to as\n'causal language jump'. We evaluated the strength of expressed causation in\ndiabetes guidelines and the evidence they reference to assess the pattern of\njumps. We randomly sampled 300 guideline statements from four diabetes\nguidelines. We rated the causation strength in the statements and the\ndependence on causation in recommendations supported by these statements using\nexisting scales. Among the causal statements, the cited original studies were\nsimilarly assessed. We also assessed how well they report target trial\nemulation (TTE) components as a proxy for reliability. Of the sampled\nstatements, 114 (38.0%) were causal, and 76 (66.7%) expressed strong causation.\n27.2% (31/114) of causal guideline statements demonstrated a \"causal language\njump\", and 34.9% (29/83) of guideline recommendations cannot be effectively\nsupported. Of the 53 eligible studies for TTE rating, most did not report\ntreatment assignment and causal contrast in detail. Our findings suggest causal\nlanguage jumps were common among diabetes guidelines. While these jumps are\nsometimes inevitable, they should always be supported by good causal inference\npractices."

In robotic tasks, VideoWorld effectively learns diverse control\noperations and generalizes across environments, approaching the performance of\noracle models in CALVIN and RLBench.

By combining mathematical\nprecision with natural language capabilities, our framework opens new avenues\nfor investigating social media phenomena through controlled experimentation.\nThis methodological advancement allows researchers to bridge the gap between\ntheoretical models and empirical observations, offering unprecedented\nopportunities to study the causal mechanisms underlying online opinion\ndynamics.",

However, due to the\nimbalance in training data, their capabilities in non-English languages are\nlimited. Recent studies revealed the English-pivot multilingual mechanism of\nLLMs, where LLMs implicitly convert non-English queries into English ones at\nthe bottom layers and adopt English for thinking at the middle layers. However,\ndue to the absence of explicit supervision for cross-lingual alignment in the\nintermediate layers of LLMs, the internal representations during these stages\nmay become inaccurate. In this work, we introduce a deep supervision\nfine-tuning method (DFT) that incorporates additional supervision in the\ninternal layers of the model to guide its workflow.

To effectively achieve the\nguiding purpose, we designed two types of supervision signals: logits and\nfeature, which represent a stricter constraint and a relatively more relaxed\nguidance.

We further adapt the proposed method to recover\nchannel information from low-resolution quantized measurements.

Results reveal that the proposed estimator\nachieves high-fidelity channel recovery while reducing estimation latency by a\nfactor of 10 compared to state-of-the-art schemes, facilitating real-time\nimplementation.

In this study, we\ninvestigate the property behind the appearance of these irrelevant visual\ntokens and examine their characteristics.

The latter ability is\nessential for tackling complex arithmetic and mathematical problems and serves\nas a foundation for most reasoning tasks, but previous work paid little\nattention to it or only discussed several restricted tasks (like integer\naddition). In this paper, we comprehensively investigate the numerical\nunderstanding and processing ability (NUPA) of LLMs. Firstly, we introduce a\nbenchmark covering four common numerical representations and 17 distinct\nnumerical tasks in four major categories, resulting in 41 meaningful\ncombinations in total. These tasks are derived from primary and secondary\neducation curricula, encompassing nearly all everyday numerical understanding\nand processing scenarios, and the rules of these tasks are very simple and\nclear. Through the benchmark, we find that current LLMs fail frequently in many\nof the tasks. To study the problem, we train small models with existing and\npotential techniques for enhancing NUPA (such as tokenizers, PEs, and number\nformats), comprehensively evaluating their effectiveness using our testbed. We\nalso finetune practical-scale LLMs on our proposed NUPA tasks and find that 1)\nnaive finetuning can improve NUPA a lot on many but not all tasks, and 2)\nsurprisingly, techniques designed to enhance NUPA prove ineffective for\nfinetuning pretrained models. We further explore the impact of chain-of-thought\ntechniques on NUPA.

                "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant success across various\nNLP tasks. However, their massive computational costs limit their widespread\nuse, particularly in real-time applications. Structured pruning offers an\neffective solution by compressing models and directly providing end-to-end\nspeed improvements, regardless of the hardware environment. Meanwhile,\ndifferent components of the model exhibit varying sensitivities towards\npruning, calling for non-uniform model compression. However, a pruning method\nshould not only identify a capable substructure, but also account for\npost-compression training. To this end, we propose DarwinLM, a method for\ntraining-aware structured pruning. DarwinLM builds upon an evolutionary search\nprocess, generating multiple offspring models in each generation through\nmutation, and selecting the fittest for survival. To assess the effect of\npost-training, we incorporate a lightweight, multistep training process within\nthe offspring population, progressively increasing the number of tokens and\neliminating poorly performing models in each selection stage. We validate our\nmethod through extensive experiments on Llama-2-7B, Llama-3.1-8B and\nQwen-2.5-14B-Instruct, achieving state-of-the-art performance for structured\npruning. For instance, DarwinLM surpasses ShearedLlama while requiring 5x less\ntraining data during post-compression training. Code is at:\nhttps://github.com/IST-DASLab/DarwinLM",

NVILA matches or\nsurpasses the accuracy of many leading open and proprietary VLMs across a wide\nrange of image and video benchmarks. At the same time, it reduces training\ncosts by 4.5X, fine-tuning memory usage by 3.4X, pre-filling latency by\n1.6-2.2X, and decoding latency by 1.2-2.8X.

Some approaches utilize synthetic data\ngenerated by advanced LLMs based on evaluation results to train models.\nHowever, conventional evaluation methods fail to provide detailed, fine-grained\nprofiles of LLMs, limiting their guidance for data synthesis. In this paper, we\nintroduce the Cognitive Diagnostic Synthesis (CDS) method, which incorporates a\ndiagnostic process inspired by Cognitive Diagnosis Theory (CDT) to refine\nevaluation results and characterize model profiles at the knowledge component\nlevel. Based on these diagnostics, we propose two diagnosis-synthesis\nstrategies for weakness-targeted data synthesis. Additionally, we present an\nenhanced data augmentation and selection pipeline to improve the quality and\ndiversity of synthesized data. Our experiments with several open-source models\nshow significant improvements across multiple benchmarks, achieving up to 6.00%\nimprovement in code generation, 13.10% in mathematical reasoning, and 5.43% in\nacademic exams.

Some approaches utilize synthetic data\ngenerated by advanced LLMs based on evaluation results to train models.\nHowever, conventional evaluation methods fail to provide detailed, fine-grained\nprofiles of LLMs, limiting their guidance for data synthesis. In this paper, we\nintroduce the Cognitive Diagnostic Synthesis (CDS) method, which incorporates a\ndiagnostic process inspired by Cognitive Diagnosis Theory (CDT) to refine\nevaluation results and characterize model profiles at the knowledge component\nlevel. Based on these diagnostics, we propose two diagnosis-synthesis\nstrategies for weakness-targeted data synthesis. Additionally, we present an\nenhanced data augmentation and selection pipeline to improve the quality and\ndiversity of synthesized data. Our experiments with several open-source models\nshow significant improvements across multiple benchmarks, achieving up to 6.00%\nimprovement in code generation, 13.10% in mathematical reasoning, and 5.43% in\nacademic exams.

Secondly, whether this\napproach is environmentally sustainable, highly cost efficient? To address\nthese research questions, we present Paramanu-Ganita, a 208 million-parameter\nnovel decoder-only Auto Regressive SLM on mathematics. We performed pretraining\nfrom scratch on 31.5 billion tokens for 170 A100 hours using a context size of\n4096 on a mixed mathematical corpus consisting of web pages, source code,\ntextbooks, CoT templatised StackOverflow QA pairs, and mathematical lecture\nnotes in LaTeX curated by us. We also trained a math and code specialised BPE\ntokenizer. We proposed and performed CoT instruction fine-tuning of\nParamanu-Ganita on the MetaMathQA dataset. Our model Paramanu-Ganita, despite\nbeing 34 times smaller than the 7B LLMs, outperforms generalist LLMs by\napproximately 30% points, and even math-specialised LLMs by 3-23% points in\nGSM8K test accuracy metric.

                    "value": "In this paper, we study whether domain specific pretraining of small\ngenerative language models (SLM) from scratch with domain specialized tokenizer\nand Chain-of-Thought (CoT) instruction fine-tuning results in competitive\nperformance on mathematical reasoning compared to LLMs? Secondly, whether this\napproach is environmentally sustainable, highly cost efficient? To address\nthese research questions, we present Paramanu-Ganita, a 208 million-parameter\nnovel decoder-only Auto Regressive SLM on mathematics. We performed pretraining\nfrom scratch on 31.5 billion tokens for 170 A100 hours using a context size of\n4096 on a mixed mathematical corpus consisting of web pages, source code,\ntextbooks, CoT templatised StackOverflow QA pairs, and mathematical lecture\nnotes in LaTeX curated by us. We also trained a math and code specialised BPE\ntokenizer. We proposed and performed CoT instruction fine-tuning of\nParamanu-Ganita on the MetaMathQA dataset. Our model Paramanu-Ganita, despite\nbeing 34 times smaller than the 7B LLMs, outperforms generalist LLMs by\napproximately 30% points, and even math-specialised LLMs by 3-23% points in\nGSM8K test accuracy metric.

However, most current research on MT-LLMs still faces\nsignificant challenges in maintaining translation consistency and accuracy when\nprocessing entire documents. In this paper, we introduce DelTA, a\nDocument-levEL Translation Agent designed to overcome these limitations. DelTA\nfeatures a multi-level memory structure that stores information across various\ngranularities and spans, including Proper Noun Records, Bilingual Summary,\nLong-Term Memory, and Short-Term Memory, which are continuously retrieved and\nupdated by auxiliary LLM-based components. Experimental results indicate that\nDelTA significantly outperforms strong baselines in terms of translation\nconsistency and quality across four open/closed-source LLMs and two\nrepresentative document translation datasets, achieving an increase in\nconsistency scores by up to 4.58 percentage points and in COMET scores by up to\n3.16 points on average. DelTA employs a sentence-by-sentence translation\nstrategy, ensuring no sentence omissions and offering a memory-efficient\nsolution compared to the mainstream method. Furthermore, DelTA improves pronoun\nand context-dependent translation accuracy, and the summary component of the\nagent also shows promise as a tool for query-based summarization tasks. The\ncode and data of our approach are released at\nhttps://github.com/YutongWang1216/DocMTAgent.",

                    "value": "Large language models (LLMs) have achieved reasonable quality improvements in\nmachine translation (MT). However, most current research on MT-LLMs still faces\nsignificant challenges in maintaining translation consistency and accuracy when\nprocessing entire documents. In this paper, we introduce DelTA, a\nDocument-levEL Translation Agent designed to overcome these limitations. DelTA\nfeatures a multi-level memory structure that stores information across various\ngranularities and spans, including Proper Noun Records, Bilingual Summary,\nLong-Term Memory, and Short-Term Memory, which are continuously retrieved and\nupdated by auxiliary LLM-based components. Experimental results indicate that\nDelTA significantly outperforms strong baselines in terms of translation\nconsistency and quality across four open/closed-source LLMs and two\nrepresentative document translation datasets, achieving an increase in\nconsistency scores by up to 4.58 percentage points and in COMET scores by up to\n3.16 points on average. DelTA employs a sentence-by-sentence translation\nstrategy, ensuring no sentence omissions and offering a memory-efficient\nsolution compared to the mainstream method. Furthermore, DelTA improves pronoun\nand context-dependent translation accuracy, and the summary component of the\nagent also shows promise as a tool for query-based summarization tasks. The\ncode and data of our approach are released at\nhttps://github.com/YutongWang1216/DocMTAgent."

While LLMs demonstrate\nremarkable capabilities across diverse tasks, they often fail to maintain\nadherence to complex, use-case-specific instructions during multi-turn\nconversations, presenting challenges for business-critical applications. ARQs\naddress this limitation by guiding LLMs through systematic reasoning steps with\ntargeted queries that reinstate critical instructions and facilitate\nintermediate reasoning throughout the completion process.

While LLMs demonstrate\nremarkable capabilities across diverse tasks, they often fail to maintain\nadherence to complex, use-case-specific instructions during multi-turn\nconversations, presenting challenges for business-critical applications. ARQs\naddress this limitation by guiding LLMs through systematic reasoning steps with\ntargeted queries that reinstate critical instructions and facilitate\nintermediate reasoning throughout the completion process.

While significant progress has been made using commercial large\nlanguage models (LLMs) as research assistants or idea generators, the\npossibility of automating the entire research process with open-source LLMs\nremains largely unexplored. This paper explores the feasibility of using\nopen-source post-trained LLMs as autonomous agents capable of performing the\nfull cycle of automated research and review, from literature review and\nmanuscript preparation to peer review and paper refinement. Our iterative\npreference training framework consists of CycleResearcher, which conducts\nresearch tasks, and CycleReviewer, which simulates the peer review process,\nproviding iterative feedback via reinforcement learning. To train these models,\nwe develop two new datasets, Review-5k and Research-14k, reflecting real-world\nmachine learning research and peer review dynamics. Our results demonstrate\nthat CycleReviewer achieves promising performance with a 26.89\\% reduction in\nmean absolute error (MAE) compared to individual human reviewers in predicting\npaper scores, indicating the potential of LLMs to effectively assist\nexpert-level research evaluation. In research, the papers generated by the\nCycleResearcher model achieved a score of 5.36 in simulated peer reviews,\nshowing some competitiveness in terms of simulated review scores compared to\nthe preprint level of 5.24 from human experts, while still having room for\nimprovement compared to the accepted paper level of 5.69. This work represents\na significant step toward fully automated scientific inquiry, providing ethical\nsafeguards and exploring AI-driven research capabilities.

In addition, FairSense-AI integrates an AI risk\nassessment component that aligns with frameworks like the MIT AI Risk\nRepository and NIST AI Risk Management Framework, enabling structured\nidentification of ethical and safety concerns. The platform is optimized for\nenergy efficiency via techniques such as model pruning and mixed-precision\ncomputation, thereby reducing its environmental footprint. Through a series of\ncase studies and applications, we demonstrate how FairSense-AI promotes\nresponsible AI use by addressing both the social dimension of fairness and the\npressing need for sustainability in large-scale AI deployments.\nhttps://vectorinstitute.github.io/FairSense-AI,\nhttps://pypi.org/project/fair-sense-ai/ (Sustainability , Responsible AI ,\nLarge Language Models , Vision Language Models , Ethical AI , Green AI)",

Although conversations can elicit trust between users and LLMs,\nscarce empirical research has examined trust formation in human-LLM contexts,\nbeyond LLMs' trustworthiness or human trust in AI in general. Here, we\nintroduce the Trust-In-LLMs Index (TILLMI) as a new framework to measure\nindividuals' trust in LLMs, extending McAllister's cognitive and affective\ntrust dimensions to LLM-human interactions. We developed TILLMI as a\npsychometric scale, prototyped with a novel protocol we called LLM-simulated\nvalidity. The LLM-based scale was then validated in a sample of 1,000 US\nrespondents. Exploratory Factor Analysis identified a two-factor structure. Two\nitems were then removed due to redundancy, yielding a final 6-item scale with a\n2-factor structure. Confirmatory Factor Analysis on a separate subsample showed\nstrong model fit ($CFI = .995$, $TLI = .991$, $RMSEA = .046$, $p_{X^2} > .05$).\nConvergent validity analysis revealed that trust in LLMs correlated positively\nwith openness to experience, extraversion, and cognitive flexibility, but\nnegatively with neuroticism. Based on these findings, we interpreted TILLMI's\nfactors as \"closeness with LLMs\" (affective dimension) and \"reliance on LLMs\"\n(cognitive dimension). Younger males exhibited higher closeness with- and\nreliance on LLMs compared to older women. Individuals with no direct experience\nwith LLMs exhibited lower levels of trust compared to LLMs' users. These\nfindings offer a novel empirical foundation for measuring trust in AI-driven\nverbal communication, informing responsible design, and fostering balanced\nhuman-AI collaboration.",

                    "value": "Large Language Models (LLMs) can engage in human-looking conversational\nexchanges. Although conversations can elicit trust between users and LLMs,\nscarce empirical research has examined trust formation in human-LLM contexts,\nbeyond LLMs' trustworthiness or human trust in AI in general. Here, we\nintroduce the Trust-In-LLMs Index (TILLMI) as a new framework to measure\nindividuals' trust in LLMs, extending McAllister's cognitive and affective\ntrust dimensions to LLM-human interactions. We developed TILLMI as a\npsychometric scale, prototyped with a novel protocol we called LLM-simulated\nvalidity. The LLM-based scale was then validated in a sample of 1,000 US\nrespondents. Exploratory Factor Analysis identified a two-factor structure. Two\nitems were then removed due to redundancy, yielding a final 6-item scale with a\n2-factor structure. Confirmatory Factor Analysis on a separate subsample showed\nstrong model fit ($CFI = .995$, $TLI = .991$, $RMSEA = .046$, $p_{X^2} > .05$).\nConvergent validity analysis revealed that trust in LLMs correlated positively\nwith openness to experience, extraversion, and cognitive flexibility, but\nnegatively with neuroticism. Based on these findings, we interpreted TILLMI's\nfactors as \"closeness with LLMs\" (affective dimension) and \"reliance on LLMs\"\n(cognitive dimension). Younger males exhibited higher closeness with- and\nreliance on LLMs compared to older women. Individuals with no direct experience\nwith LLMs exhibited lower levels of trust compared to LLMs' users. These\nfindings offer a novel empirical foundation for measuring trust in AI-driven\nverbal communication, informing responsible design, and fostering balanced\nhuman-AI collaboration."

Experiments demonstrate that PowerAttention\noutperforms existing static sparse attention methods by $5\\sim 40\\%$,\nespecially on tasks demanding long-range dependencies like Passkey Retrieval\nand RULER, while maintaining a comparable time complexity to sliding window\nattention. Efficiency evaluations further highlight PowerAttention's superior\nspeedup in both prefilling and decoding phases compared with dynamic sparse\nattentions and full attention ($3.0\\times$ faster on 128K context), making it a\nhighly effective and user-friendly solution for processing long sequences in\nLLMs.",

However, despite these achievements, LLMs\nstill exhibit inherent safety vulnerabilities, especially when confronted with\njailbreak attacks.

However, due to the structural differences between CNN\nand Transformer architectures, simply applying binary CNN strategies to the ViT\nmodels will lead to a significant performance drop. To tackle this challenge,\nwe propose BHViT, a binarization-friendly hybrid ViT architecture and its full\nbinarization model with the guidance of three important observations.\nInitially, BHViT utilizes the local information interaction and hierarchical\nfeature aggregation technique from coarse to fine levels to address redundant\ncomputations stemming from excessive tokens. Then, a novel module based on\nshift operations is proposed to enhance the performance of the binary\nMultilayer Perceptron (MLP) module without significantly increasing\ncomputational overhead. In addition, an innovative attention matrix\nbinarization method based on quantization decomposition is proposed to evaluate\nthe token's importance in the binarized attention matrix. Finally, we propose a\nregularization loss to address the inadequate optimization caused by the\nincompatibility between the weight oscillation in the binary layers and the\nAdam Optimizer. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed\nalgorithm achieves SOTA performance among binary ViT methods.",

                    "value": "Model binarization has made significant progress in enabling real-time and\nenergy-efficient computation for convolutional neural networks (CNN), offering\na potential solution to the deployment challenges faced by Vision Transformers\n(ViTs) on edge devices. However, due to the structural differences between CNN\nand Transformer architectures, simply applying binary CNN strategies to the ViT\nmodels will lead to a significant performance drop. To tackle this challenge,\nwe propose BHViT, a binarization-friendly hybrid ViT architecture and its full\nbinarization model with the guidance of three important observations.\nInitially, BHViT utilizes the local information interaction and hierarchical\nfeature aggregation technique from coarse to fine levels to address redundant\ncomputations stemming from excessive tokens. Then, a novel module based on\nshift operations is proposed to enhance the performance of the binary\nMultilayer Perceptron (MLP) module without significantly increasing\ncomputational overhead. In addition, an innovative attention matrix\nbinarization method based on quantization decomposition is proposed to evaluate\nthe token's importance in the binarized attention matrix. Finally, we propose a\nregularization loss to address the inadequate optimization caused by the\nincompatibility between the weight oscillation in the binary layers and the\nAdam Optimizer. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed\nalgorithm achieves SOTA performance among binary ViT methods."

In\nthis work, we propose SafeVLA, a novel algorithm designed to integrate safety\ninto VLAs, ensuring the protection of the environment, robot hardware and\nhumans in real-world settings. SafeVLA effectively balances safety and task\nperformance by employing large-scale constrained learning within simulated\nenvironments.

By prioritizing\nsafety, our approach eliminates high-risk behaviors and reduces the upper bound\nof unsafe behaviors to 1/35 of that in the current state-of-the-art, thereby\nsignificantly mitigating long-tail risks.

                "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) can solve an increasing number of complex\nreasoning tasks while making surprising mistakes in basic numerical\nunderstanding and processing (such as 9.11 > 9.9). The latter ability is\nessential for tackling complex arithmetic and mathematical problems and serves\nas a foundation for most reasoning tasks, but previous work paid little\nattention to it or only discussed several restricted tasks (like integer\naddition). In this paper, we comprehensively investigate the numerical\nunderstanding and processing ability (NUPA) of LLMs. Firstly, we introduce a\nbenchmark covering four common numerical representations and 17 distinct\nnumerical tasks in four major categories, resulting in 41 meaningful\ncombinations in total. These tasks are derived from primary and secondary\neducation curricula, encompassing nearly all everyday numerical understanding\nand processing scenarios, and the rules of these tasks are very simple and\nclear. Through the benchmark, we find that current LLMs fail frequently in many\nof the tasks. To study the problem, we train small models with existing and\npotential techniques for enhancing NUPA (such as tokenizers, PEs, and number\nformats), comprehensively evaluating their effectiveness using our testbed. We\nalso finetune practical-scale LLMs on our proposed NUPA tasks and find that 1)\nnaive finetuning can improve NUPA a lot on many but not all tasks, and 2)\nsurprisingly, techniques designed to enhance NUPA prove ineffective for\nfinetuning pretrained models. We further explore the impact of chain-of-thought\ntechniques on NUPA. Our work provides a more detailed and comprehensive\nunderstanding of NUPA in LLMs. Our benchmark and code are released at\nhttps://github.com/GraphPKU/number_cookbook.",

                    "value": "Large language models (LLMs) can solve an increasing number of complex\nreasoning tasks while making surprising mistakes in basic numerical\nunderstanding and processing (such as 9.11 > 9.9). The latter ability is\nessential for tackling complex arithmetic and mathematical problems and serves\nas a foundation for most reasoning tasks, but previous work paid little\nattention to it or only discussed several restricted tasks (like integer\naddition). In this paper, we comprehensively investigate the numerical\nunderstanding and processing ability (NUPA) of LLMs. Firstly, we introduce a\nbenchmark covering four common numerical representations and 17 distinct\nnumerical tasks in four major categories, resulting in 41 meaningful\ncombinations in total. These tasks are derived from primary and secondary\neducation curricula, encompassing nearly all everyday numerical understanding\nand processing scenarios, and the rules of these tasks are very simple and\nclear. Through the benchmark, we find that current LLMs fail frequently in many\nof the tasks. To study the problem, we train small models with existing and\npotential techniques for enhancing NUPA (such as tokenizers, PEs, and number\nformats), comprehensively evaluating their effectiveness using our testbed. We\nalso finetune practical-scale LLMs on our proposed NUPA tasks and find that 1)\nnaive finetuning can improve NUPA a lot on many but not all tasks, and 2)\nsurprisingly, techniques designed to enhance NUPA prove ineffective for\nfinetuning pretrained models. We further explore the impact of chain-of-thought\ntechniques on NUPA. Our work provides a more detailed and comprehensive\nunderstanding of NUPA in LLMs. Our benchmark and code are released at\nhttps://github.com/GraphPKU/number_cookbook."

However, the lack of efficient training algorithms has\nhindered their widespread adoption. Even efficient ANN-SNN conversion methods\nnecessitate quantized training of ANNs to enhance the effectiveness of the\nconversion, incurring additional training costs. To address these challenges,\nwe propose an efficient ANN-SNN conversion framework with only inference scale\ncomplexity. The conversion framework includes a local threshold balancing\nalgorithm, which enables efficient calculation of the optimal thresholds and\nfine-grained adjustment of the threshold value by channel-wise scaling. We also\nintroduce an effective delayed evaluation strategy to mitigate the influence of\nthe spike propagation delays. We demonstrate the scalability of our framework\nin typical computer vision tasks: image classification, semantic segmentation,\nobject detection, and video classification. Our algorithm outperforms existing\nmethods, highlighting its practical applicability and efficiency. Moreover, we\nhave evaluated the energy consumption of the converted SNNs, demonstrating\ntheir superior low-power advantage compared to conventional ANNs. This approach\nsimplifies the deployment of SNNs by leveraging open-source pre-trained ANN\nmodels, enabling fast, low-power inference with negligible performance\nreduction.

                    "value": "Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as a promising substitute for\nArtificial Neural Networks (ANNs) due to their advantages of fast inference and\nlow power consumption. However, the lack of efficient training algorithms has\nhindered their widespread adoption. Even efficient ANN-SNN conversion methods\nnecessitate quantized training of ANNs to enhance the effectiveness of the\nconversion, incurring additional training costs. To address these challenges,\nwe propose an efficient ANN-SNN conversion framework with only inference scale\ncomplexity. The conversion framework includes a local threshold balancing\nalgorithm, which enables efficient calculation of the optimal thresholds and\nfine-grained adjustment of the threshold value by channel-wise scaling. We also\nintroduce an effective delayed evaluation strategy to mitigate the influence of\nthe spike propagation delays. We demonstrate the scalability of our framework\nin typical computer vision tasks: image classification, semantic segmentation,\nobject detection, and video classification. Our algorithm outperforms existing\nmethods, highlighting its practical applicability and efficiency. Moreover, we\nhave evaluated the energy consumption of the converted SNNs, demonstrating\ntheir superior low-power advantage compared to conventional ANNs. This approach\nsimplifies the deployment of SNNs by leveraging open-source pre-trained ANN\nmodels, enabling fast, low-power inference with negligible performance\nreduction.

The randomness in performing crossover or mutations may limit the\nmodel's ability to evolve efficiently. This paper introduces Preference-Aligned\nIndividual Reciprocity (PAIR), a novel selection approach leveraging Large\nLanguage Models to emulate human-like mate selection, thereby introducing\nintelligence to the pairing process in EAs. PAIR prompts an LLM to evaluate\nindividuals within a population based on genetic diversity, fitness level, and\ncrossover compatibility, guiding more informed pairing decisions.

This paper introduces Preference-Aligned\nIndividual Reciprocity (PAIR), a novel selection approach leveraging Large\nLanguage Models to emulate human-like mate selection, thereby introducing\nintelligence to the pairing process in EAs. PAIR prompts an LLM to evaluate\nindividuals within a population based on genetic diversity, fitness level, and\ncrossover compatibility, guiding more informed pairing decisions.

Recent work has focused on enabling Video LLMs to\nperform video temporal grounding via next-token prediction of temporal\ntimestamps. However, accurately localizing timestamps in videos remains\nchallenging for Video LLMs when relying solely on temporal token prediction.\nOur proposed TimeRefine addresses this challenge in two ways. First, instead of\ndirectly predicting the start and end timestamps, we reformulate the temporal\ngrounding task as a temporal refining task: the model first makes rough\npredictions and then refines them by predicting offsets to the target segment.\nThis refining process is repeated multiple times, through which the model\nprogressively self-improves its temporal localization accuracy. Second, to\nenhance the model's temporal perception capabilities, we incorporate an\nauxiliary prediction head that penalizes the model more if a predicted segment\ndeviates further from the ground truth, thus encouraging the model to make\ncloser and more accurate predictions. Our plug-and-play method can be\nintegrated into most LLM-based temporal grounding approaches. The experimental\nresults demonstrate that TimeRefine achieves 3.6% and 5.0% mIoU improvements on\nthe ActivityNet and Charades-STA datasets, respectively.

By addressing both single- and\nmulti-reflection IRS architectures, we examine their deployment strategies\nacross diverse scenarios, including point-to-point, point-to-multipoint, and\npoint-to-area setups. For the single-reflection case, we highlight the\ntrade-offs between passive and active IRS architectures in terms of beamforming\ngain, coverage extension, and spatial multiplexing. For the multi-reflection\ncase, we discuss practical strategies to optimize IRS deployment and element\nallocation, balancing cooperative beamforming gains and path loss. The paper\nfurther discusses practical challenges in IRS implementation, including\nenvironmental conditions, system compatibility, and hardware limitations.\nNumerical results and field tests validate the effectiveness of IRS-aided\nwireless networks and demonstrate their capacity and coverage improvements.\nLastly, promising research directions, including movable IRSs, near-field\ndeployments, and network-level optimization, are outlined to guide future\ninvestigations.",

By addressing both single- and\nmulti-reflection IRS architectures, we examine their deployment strategies\nacross diverse scenarios, including point-to-point, point-to-multipoint, and\npoint-to-area setups. For the single-reflection case, we highlight the\ntrade-offs between passive and active IRS architectures in terms of beamforming\ngain, coverage extension, and spatial multiplexing. For the multi-reflection\ncase, we discuss practical strategies to optimize IRS deployment and element\nallocation, balancing cooperative beamforming gains and path loss. The paper\nfurther discusses practical challenges in IRS implementation, including\nenvironmental conditions, system compatibility, and hardware limitations.\nNumerical results and field tests validate the effectiveness of IRS-aided\nwireless networks and demonstrate their capacity and coverage improvements.\nLastly, promising research directions, including movable IRSs, near-field\ndeployments, and network-level optimization, are outlined to guide future\ninvestigations."
