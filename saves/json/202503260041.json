To improve inference efficiency, we implemented a\ncaching algorithm that almost doubles the speed and reduces the KV cache size\nby seven-eighths compared to the original Transformer.

                "summary": "Supervised fine-tuning is a standard method for adapting pre-trained large\nlanguage models (LLMs) to downstream tasks. Quantization has been recently\nstudied as a post-training technique for efficient LLM deployment. To obtain\nquantized fine-tuned LLMs, conventional pipelines would first fine-tune the\npre-trained models, followed by post-training quantization. This often yields\nsuboptimal performance as it fails to leverage the synergy between fine-tuning\nand quantization. To effectively realize low-bit quantization of weights,\nactivations, and KV caches in LLMs, we propose an algorithm named Rotated\nStraight-Through-Estimator (RoSTE), which combines quantization-aware\nsupervised fine-tuning (QA-SFT) with an adaptive rotation strategy that\nidentifies an effective rotation configuration to reduce activation outliers.\nWe provide theoretical insights on RoSTE by analyzing its prediction error when\napplied to an overparameterized least square quantized training problem.

                    "value": "Supervised fine-tuning is a standard method for adapting pre-trained large\nlanguage models (LLMs) to downstream tasks. Quantization has been recently\nstudied as a post-training technique for efficient LLM deployment. To obtain\nquantized fine-tuned LLMs, conventional pipelines would first fine-tune the\npre-trained models, followed by post-training quantization. This often yields\nsuboptimal performance as it fails to leverage the synergy between fine-tuning\nand quantization. To effectively realize low-bit quantization of weights,\nactivations, and KV caches in LLMs, we propose an algorithm named Rotated\nStraight-Through-Estimator (RoSTE), which combines quantization-aware\nsupervised fine-tuning (QA-SFT) with an adaptive rotation strategy that\nidentifies an effective rotation configuration to reduce activation outliers.\nWe provide theoretical insights on RoSTE by analyzing its prediction error when\napplied to an overparameterized least square quantized training problem. Our\nfindings reveal that the prediction error is directly proportional to the\nquantization error of the converged weights, which can be effectively managed\nthrough an optimized rotation configuration. Experiments on Pythia, Qwen and\nLlama models of different sizes demonstrate the effectiveness of RoSTE.\nCompared to existing post-SFT quantization baselines, our method consistently\nachieves superior performances across various tasks and different LLM\narchitectures."

Under the assumption that the\nchange and request events, resp., to each web page follow independent Poisson\nprocesses, the optimal scheduling policy was derived by Azar et al. 2018. In\nthis paper, we study an extension of this problem where side information\nindicating content changes, such as various types of web pings, for example,\nsignals from sitemaps, content delivery networks, etc., is available.\nIncorporating such side information into the crawling policy is challenging,\nbecause (i) the signals can be noisy with false positive events and with\nmissing change events; and (ii) the crawler should achieve a fair performance\nover web pages regardless of the quality of the side information, which might\ndiffer from web page to web page. We propose a scalable crawling algorithm\nwhich (i) uses the noisy side information in an optimal way under mild\nassumptions; (ii) can be deployed without heavy centralized computation; (iii)\nis able to crawl web pages at a constant total rate without spikes in the total\nbandwidth usage over any time interval, and automatically adapt to the new\noptimal solution when the total bandwidth changes without centralized\ncomputation. Experiments clearly demonstrate the versatility of our approach.",

                    "value": "Web refresh crawling is the problem of keeping a cache of web pages fresh,\nthat is, having the most recent copy available when a page is requested, given\na limited bandwidth available to the crawler. Under the assumption that the\nchange and request events, resp., to each web page follow independent Poisson\nprocesses, the optimal scheduling policy was derived by Azar et al. 2018. In\nthis paper, we study an extension of this problem where side information\nindicating content changes, such as various types of web pings, for example,\nsignals from sitemaps, content delivery networks, etc., is available.\nIncorporating such side information into the crawling policy is challenging,\nbecause (i) the signals can be noisy with false positive events and with\nmissing change events; and (ii) the crawler should achieve a fair performance\nover web pages regardless of the quality of the side information, which might\ndiffer from web page to web page. We propose a scalable crawling algorithm\nwhich (i) uses the noisy side information in an optimal way under mild\nassumptions; (ii) can be deployed without heavy centralized computation; (iii)\nis able to crawl web pages at a constant total rate without spikes in the total\nbandwidth usage over any time interval, and automatically adapt to the new\noptimal solution when the total bandwidth changes without centralized\ncomputation. Experiments clearly demonstrate the versatility of our approach."

The evaluations demonstrate that compared with the original\nPromptus, PromptMobile achieves a 13.6x increase in image generation speed.\nCompared with other streaming methods, PromptMobile achives an average LPIPS\nimprovement of 0.016 (compared with H.265), reducing 60\\% of severely distorted\nframes (compared to VQGAN).",

Promptus emerges as a new paradigm for\nvideo streaming, substantially cutting down the bandwidth essential for video\nstreaming. However, Promptus is computationally intensive and can not run in\nreal-time on mobile devices. This paper presents PromptMobile, an efficient\nacceleration framework tailored for on-device Promptus. Specifically, we\npropose (1) a two-stage efficient generation framework to reduce computational\ncost by 8.1x, (2) a fine-grained inter-frame caching to reduce redundant\ncomputations by 16.6\\%, (3) system-level optimizations to further enhance\nefficiency. The evaluations demonstrate that compared with the original\nPromptus, PromptMobile achieves a 13.6x increase in image generation speed.\nCompared with other streaming methods, PromptMobile achives an average LPIPS\nimprovement of 0.016 (compared with H.265), reducing 60\\% of severely distorted\nframes (compared to VQGAN)."

                "summary": "Sparse triangular solve (SpTRSV) is widely used in various domains. Numerous\nstudies have been conducted using CPUs, GPUs, and specific hardware\naccelerators, where dataflows can be categorized into coarse and fine\ngranularity. Coarse dataflows offer good spatial locality but suffer from low\nparallelism, while fine dataflows provide high parallelism but disrupt the\nspatial structure, leading to increased nodes and poor data reuse.

Numerous\nstudies have been conducted using CPUs, GPUs, and specific hardware\naccelerators, where dataflows can be categorized into coarse and fine\ngranularity.

The\nstaggered layer design with pixelated scintillators enables the determination\nof the gamma's depth of interaction and facilitates an iteration-free\nformulation of the MLP algorithm. The efficacy of the algorithm optimization\nwas tested on a scintillation detector block designed for an ultra-high field\nBrainPET 7T, comprising three scintillator pixel layers. The three layers\ncontain 24 x 24, 24 x 23 and 23 x 22 scintillator pixels, respectively, with a\npixel pitch of 2 mm in both directions and layer thicknesses of 9, 8 and 7 mm.\nCalibration measurements, in combination with an automated calibration script,\nwere used to obtain the expected counts of scintillation photons required in\nthe MLP algorithm. Using Single-Instruction-Multiple-Data parallelization,\nmulti-threading and optimized cache lines, a maximum processing speed of\napproximately 22.5 million singles per second was achieved on a platform with\nfour Intel Xeon Platinum 8168 CPUs and 60 threads, encompassing all required\nprocessing steps. The automatic calibration failed for 1 to 15 individual\nscintillator pixels in approximately 10 per cent of the 120 scintillation\ndetector blocks, necessitating manual correction. After applying the energy\ncorrection to the positioned single events, an energy resolution of of 12 +/- 2\nper cent FWHM was obtained for the entire scintillation block. This value is\nvery close to the energy resolutions measured for the individual scintillator\npixels, proving that the MLP accurately identifies the scintillating pixel and\nthat the energy correction method effectively compensates for the light\ncollection variations of the SiPM array.",

In this\npaper, we introduce WildSeg3D, an efficient approach that enables the\nsegmentation of arbitrary 3D objects across diverse environments using a\nfeed-forward mechanism. A key challenge of this feed-forward approach lies in\nthe accumulation of 3D alignment errors across multiple 2D views, which can\nlead to inaccurate 3D segmentation results. To address this issue, we propose\nDynamic Global Aligning (DGA), a technique that improves the accuracy of global\nmulti-view alignment by focusing on difficult-to-match 3D points across images,\nusing a dynamic adjustment function. Additionally, for real-time interactive\nsegmentation, we introduce Multi-view Group Mapping (MGM), a method that\nutilizes an object mask cache to integrate multi-view segmentations and respond\nrapidly to user prompts. WildSeg3D demonstrates robust generalization across\narbitrary scenes, thereby eliminating the need for scene-specific training.\nSpecifically, WildSeg3D not only attains the accuracy of state-of-the-art\n(SOTA) methods but also achieves a $40\\times$ speedup compared to existing SOTA\nmodels.

To address this issue, we propose\nDynamic Global Aligning (DGA), a technique that improves the accuracy of global\nmulti-view alignment by focusing on difficult-to-match 3D points across images,\nusing a dynamic adjustment function. Additionally, for real-time interactive\nsegmentation, we introduce Multi-view Group Mapping (MGM), a method that\nutilizes an object mask cache to integrate multi-view segmentations and respond\nrapidly to user prompts. WildSeg3D demonstrates robust generalization across\narbitrary scenes, thereby eliminating the need for scene-specific training.\nSpecifically, WildSeg3D not only attains the accuracy of state-of-the-art\n(SOTA) methods but also achieves a $40\\times$ speedup compared to existing SOTA\nmodels. Our code will be publicly available."

However, we identify a\ncritical limitation: not every adversarial optimization step leads to a\npositive outcome, and indiscriminately accepting optimization results at each\nstep may reduce the overall attack success rate. To address this challenge, we\nintroduce HKVE (Hierarchical Key-Value Equalization), an innovative\njailbreaking framework that selectively accepts gradient optimization results\nbased on the distribution of attention scores across different layers, ensuring\nthat every optimization step positively contributes to the attack. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate HKVE's significant effectiveness, achieving attack\nsuccess rates of 75.08% on MiniGPT4, 85.84% on LLaVA and 81.00% on Qwen-VL,\nsubstantially outperforming existing methods by margins of 20.43\\%, 21.01\\% and\n26.43\\% respectively. Furthermore, making every step effective not only leads\nto an increase in attack success rate but also allows for a reduction in the\nnumber of iterations, thereby lowering computational costs.

However, we identify a\ncritical limitation: not every adversarial optimization step leads to a\npositive outcome, and indiscriminately accepting optimization results at each\nstep may reduce the overall attack success rate. To address this challenge, we\nintroduce HKVE (Hierarchical Key-Value Equalization), an innovative\njailbreaking framework that selectively accepts gradient optimization results\nbased on the distribution of attention scores across different layers, ensuring\nthat every optimization step positively contributes to the attack. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate HKVE's significant effectiveness, achieving attack\nsuccess rates of 75.08% on MiniGPT4, 85.84% on LLaVA and 81.00% on Qwen-VL,\nsubstantially outperforming existing methods by margins of 20.43\\%, 21.01\\% and\n26.43\\% respectively. Furthermore, making every step effective not only leads\nto an increase in attack success rate but also allows for a reduction in the\nnumber of iterations, thereby lowering computational costs. Warning: This paper\ncontains potentially harmful example data."

This raises a key question: can we use MLA's benefits\nfully or partially in models that have already been pre-trained with different\nattention mechanisms?

By introducing a block-wise\nautoregressive unit, ACDiT offers a flexible interpolation between token-wise\nautoregression and full-sequence diffusion, bypassing the limitations of\ndiscrete tokenization. The generation of each block is formulated as a\nconditional diffusion process, conditioned on prior blocks. ACDiT is easy to\nimplement, as simple as creating a Skip-Causal Attention Mask (SCAM) on\nstandard diffusion transformer during training. During inference, the process\niterates between diffusion denoising and autoregressive decoding that can make\nfull use of KV-Cache. We show that ACDiT performs best among all autoregressive\nbaselines under similar model scales on image and video generation tasks. We\nalso demonstrate that benefiting from autoregressive modeling, pretrained ACDiT\ncan be transferred in visual understanding tasks despite being trained with the\ndiffusion objective. The analysis of the trade-off between autoregressive\nmodeling and diffusion demonstrates the potential of ACDiT to be used in\nlong-horizon visual generation tasks. We hope that ACDiT offers a novel\nperspective on visual autoregressive generation and unlocks new avenues for\nunified models.",

                    "value": "We present ACDiT, a novel Autoregressive blockwise Conditional Diffusion\nTransformer, that innovatively combines autoregressive and diffusion paradigms\nfor modeling continuous visual information. By introducing a block-wise\nautoregressive unit, ACDiT offers a flexible interpolation between token-wise\nautoregression and full-sequence diffusion, bypassing the limitations of\ndiscrete tokenization. The generation of each block is formulated as a\nconditional diffusion process, conditioned on prior blocks. ACDiT is easy to\nimplement, as simple as creating a Skip-Causal Attention Mask (SCAM) on\nstandard diffusion transformer during training. During inference, the process\niterates between diffusion denoising and autoregressive decoding that can make\nfull use of KV-Cache. We show that ACDiT performs best among all autoregressive\nbaselines under similar model scales on image and video generation tasks. We\nalso demonstrate that benefiting from autoregressive modeling, pretrained ACDiT\ncan be transferred in visual understanding tasks despite being trained with the\ndiffusion objective. The analysis of the trade-off between autoregressive\nmodeling and diffusion demonstrates the potential of ACDiT to be used in\nlong-horizon visual generation tasks. We hope that ACDiT offers a novel\nperspective on visual autoregressive generation and unlocks new avenues for\nunified models."

In\nthis setting, MoE models exhibit a high degree of activation sparsity, meaning\na small number of experts are frequently reused in generating tokens during the\ndecode phase. Leveraging this idea, we design a sparsity-aware expert cache,\nwhich can trace the sparse activation of experts during inference and carefully\nselect the trace that represents the sparsity pattern.

We further perform a pioneering\ninvestigation of the acceleration potential of classifier-free guidance (CFG)\nand reveal significant redundancy between conditional and unconditional\nfeatures within the same timestep. Capitalizing on these observations, we\nintroduce FasterCache to substantially accelerate diffusion-based video\ngeneration. Our key contributions include a dynamic feature reuse strategy that\npreserves both feature distinction and temporal continuity, and CFG-Cache which\noptimizes the reuse of conditional and unconditional outputs to further enhance\ninference speed without compromising video quality. We empirically evaluate\nFasterCache on recent video diffusion models. Experimental results show that\nFasterCache can significantly accelerate video generation (\\eg 1.67$\\times$\nspeedup on Vchitect-2.0) while keeping video quality comparable to the\nbaseline, and consistently outperform existing methods in both inference speed\nand video quality.",

To address these challenges, optimizations for long-context\ninference have been developed, centered around the KV cache.

In this work, we challenge\nthis trend by introducing DITR, a simple yet effective approach that extracts\n2D foundation model features, projects them to 3D, and finally injects them\ninto a 3D point cloud segmentation model. DITR achieves state-of-the-art\nresults on both indoor and outdoor 3D semantic segmentation benchmarks. To\nenable the use of VFMs even when images are unavailable during inference, we\nfurther propose to distill 2D foundation models into a 3D backbone as a\npretraining task. By initializing the 3D backbone with knowledge distilled from\n2D VFMs, we create a strong basis for downstream 3D segmentation tasks,\nultimately boosting performance across various datasets."

By three-stage training, our\nVFMs achieve remarkable improvements not only in multimodal understanding but\nalso in other downstream tasks such as classification and segmentation.\nRemarkably, CoMP-SigLIP achieves scores of 66.7 on ChartQA and 75.9 on DocVQA\nwith a 0.5B LLM, while maintaining an 87.4% accuracy on ImageNet-1K and a 49.5\nmIoU on ADE20K under frozen chunk evaluation."

To address\nspatial heterogeneity, we employ Gaussian Process modeling. Further, we use\nGranger causality analysis and counterfactual simulation to establish direct\ncausal links. Validation using real-world data from the COVID-19 lockdown\nconfirms that reduced emissions led to a substantial drop in $PM_{2.5}$ but\nonly a slight, insignificant change in $O_3$.

While\nexisting methods have employed techniques such as interpolation, extrapolation,\nor their combinations, none have fully resolved this issue. In this paper, we\npropose a novel two-dimensional randomized positional encodings (RPE-2D)\nframework that focuses on learning positional order of image patches instead of\nthe specific distances between them, enabling seamless high- and low-resolution\nimage generation without requiring high- and low-resolution image training.\nSpecifically, RPE-2D independently selects positions over a broader range along\nboth the horizontal and vertical axes, ensuring that all position encodings are\ntrained during the inference phase, thus improving resolution generalization.\nAdditionally, we propose a random data augmentation technique to enhance the\nmodeling of position order. To address the issue of image cropping caused by\nthe augmentation, we introduce corresponding micro-conditioning to enable the\nmodel to perceive the specific cropping patterns. On the ImageNet dataset, our\nproposed RPE-2D achieves state-of-the-art resolution generalization\nperformance, outperforming existing competitive methods when trained at a\nresolution of $256 \\times 256$ and inferred at $384 \\times 384$ and $512 \\times\n512$, as well as when scaling from $512 \\times 512$ to $768 \\times 768$ and\n$1024 \\times 1024$.

Traditional\napproaches, such as queuing theory-based modeling and packet-based simulators,\ncan be inefficient due to the assumption made and the computational expense,\nrespectively. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative\nenergy-efficient dynamic orchestration of Graph Neural Networks (GNN) based\nmodel training and inference framework for context-aware network modeling and\npredictions. We have developed a low-complexity solution framework, QAG, that\nis a Quantum approximation optimization (QAO) algorithm for Adaptive\norchestration of GNN-based network modeling. We leverage the tripartite graph\nmodel to represent a multi-application system with many compute nodes.\nThereafter, we apply the constrained graph-cutting using QAO to find the\nfeasible energy-efficient configurations of the GNN-based model and deploying\nthem on the available compute nodes to meet the network modeling application\nrequirements. The proposed QAG scheme closely matches the optimum and offers\natleast a 50% energy saving while meeting the application requirements with 60%\nlower churn-rate.",

Traditional\napproaches, such as queuing theory-based modeling and packet-based simulators,\ncan be inefficient due to the assumption made and the computational expense,\nrespectively. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative\nenergy-efficient dynamic orchestration of Graph Neural Networks (GNN) based\nmodel training and inference framework for context-aware network modeling and\npredictions. We have developed a low-complexity solution framework, QAG, that\nis a Quantum approximation optimization (QAO) algorithm for Adaptive\norchestration of GNN-based network modeling. We leverage the tripartite graph\nmodel to represent a multi-application system with many compute nodes.\nThereafter, we apply the constrained graph-cutting using QAO to find the\nfeasible energy-efficient configurations of the GNN-based model and deploying\nthem on the available compute nodes to meet the network modeling application\nrequirements. The proposed QAG scheme closely matches the optimum and offers\natleast a 50% energy saving while meeting the application requirements with 60%\nlower churn-rate."

These\ndiscovered symbolic rules transform low-level visual perception into\ninterpretable event understanding, providing a transparent reasoning path from\nobjects to events with strong transferability across domains.We compared our\ntraining-free framework against specialized event recognition systems across\ndiverse application domains. Experiments demonstrate that our framework\nenhances multiple object detector architectures to recognize complex events\nsuch as illegal fishing activities (75% AUROC, +8.36% improvement),\nconstruction safety violations (+15.77%), and abnormal crowd behaviors\n(+23.16%). The code will be released soon."

Traditional regression test generation\nis impractical for detecting unintended behavioral changes, because it reports\nall behavioral differences as potential regressions. However, most code changes\nare intended to change the behavior in some way, e.g., to fix a bug or to add a\nnew feature. This paper presents Testora, an automated approach that detects\nregressions by comparing the intentions of a code change against behavioral\ndifferences caused by the code change. Given a pull request (PR), Testora\nqueries an LLM to generate tests that exercise the modified code, compares the\nbehavior of the original and modified code, and classifies any behavioral\ndifferences as intended or unintended. For the classification, we present an\nLLM-based technique that leverages the natural language information associated\nwith the PR, such as the title, description, and commit messages -- effectively\nproviding a natural language oracle for regression testing. Applying Testora to\nPRs of complex and popular Python projects, we find 19 regression bugs and 11\nPRs that, despite having another intention, coincidentally fix a bug. Out of 13\nregressions reported to the developers, 10 have been confirmed and 8 have\nalready been fixed. The costs of using Testora are acceptable for real-world\ndeployment, with 12.3 minutes to check a PR and LLM costs of only $0.003 per\nPR. We envision our approach to be used before or shortly after a code change\ngets merged into a code base, providing a way to early on detect regressions\nthat are not caught by traditional approaches.",

Most prior work prioritizes visual fidelity while overlooking the need\nfor smaller, more efficient models suitable for real-world deployment. To\naddress this challenge, we propose a lightweight T2V framework, termed\nHummingbird, which prunes existing models and enhances visual quality through\nvisual feedback learning. Our approach reduces the size of the U-Net from 1.4\nbillion to 0.7 billion parameters, significantly improving efficiency while\npreserving high-quality video generation. Additionally, we introduce a novel\ndata processing pipeline that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and Video\nQuality Assessment (VQA) models to enhance the quality of both text prompts and\nvideo data. To support user-driven training and style customization, we\npublicly release the full training code, including data processing and model\ntraining. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves a 31X speedup\ncompared to state-of-the-art models such as VideoCrafter2, while also attaining\nthe highest overall score on VBench. Moreover, our method supports the\ngeneration of videos with up to 26 frames, addressing the limitations of\nexisting U-Net-based methods in long video generation.

In this\nwork, we systematically combine the insights from state-of-the-art stereo\nmethods with general knowledge-distillation techniques to develop a joint\nframework for stereo networks distillation with competitive results and faster\ninference. Moreover, we show, via a detailed empirical analysis, that\ndistilling knowledge from the stereo network requires careful design of the\ncomplete distillation pipeline starting from backbone to the right selection of\ndistillation points and corresponding loss functions. This results in the\nstudent networks that are not only leaner and faster but give excellent\nperformance . For instance, our student network while performing better than\nthe performance oriented methods like PSMNet [1], CFNet [2], and LEAStereo [3])\non benchmark SceneFlow dataset, is 8x, 5x, and 8x faster respectively.\nFurthermore, compared to speed oriented methods having inference time less than\n100ms, our student networks perform better than all the tested methods.

Existing work mainly focuses on\nenhancing performance through behavior cloning from stronger experts, yet such\napproaches often falter in real-world applications, mainly due to the inability\nto recover from errors. However, step-level critique data is difficult and\nexpensive to collect. Automating and dynamically constructing self-critique\ndatasets is thus crucial to empowering models with intelligent agent\ncapabilities. In this work, we propose an iterative self-training framework,\nAgent-R, that enables language Agent to Reflect on the fly.

A key challenge of agent reflection lies in the necessity for\ntimely revision rather than waiting until the end of a rollout. To address\nthis, we introduce a model-guided critique construction mechanism: the actor\nmodel identifies the first error step (within its current capability) in a\nfailed trajectory. Starting from it, we splice it with the adjacent correct\npath, which shares the same parent node in the tree. This strategy enables the\nmodel to learn reflection based on its current policy, therefore yielding\nbetter learning efficiency. To further explore the scalability of this\nself-improvement paradigm, we investigate iterative refinement of both error\ncorrection capabilities and dataset construction. Our findings demonstrate that\nAgent-R continuously improves the model's ability to recover from errors and\nenables timely error correction.

These results highlight xKV's strong\ncapability and versatility in addressing memory bottlenecks for long-context\nLLM inference.

However, they fail to\nplan reliably, even when prompted with a detailed definition of the planning\ntask. Attempts to improve their planning capabilities, such as chain-of-thought\nprompting, fine-tuning, and explicit \"reasoning\" still yield incorrect plans\nand usually fail to generalize to larger tasks. In this paper, we show how to\nuse LLMs to generate correct plans, even for out-of-distribution tasks of\nincreasing size. For a given planning domain, we ask an LLM to generate several\ndomain-dependent heuristic functions in the form of Python code, evaluate them\non a set of training tasks within a greedy best-first search, and choose the\nstrongest one. The resulting LLM-generated heuristics solve many more unseen\ntest tasks than state-of-the-art domain-independent heuristics for classical\nplanning. They are even competitive with the strongest learning algorithm for\ndomain-dependent planning. These findings are especially remarkable given that\nour proof-of-concept implementation is based on an unoptimized Python planner\nand the baselines all build upon highly optimized C++ code. In some domains,\nthe LLM-generated heuristics expand fewer states than the baselines, revealing\nthat they are not only efficiently computable, but sometimes even more\ninformative than the state-of-the-art heuristics.

This work presents a systematic investigation into\nleveraging large-scale Vision-Language Models (VLMs), particularly CLIP, as\nsurrogate models for executing no-box attacks. Our theoretical and empirical\nanalyses reveal a key limitation in the execution of no-box attacks stemming\nfrom insufficient discriminative capabilities for direct application of vanilla\nCLIP as a surrogate model. To address this limitation, we propose MF-CLIP: a\nnovel framework that enhances CLIP's effectiveness as a surrogate model through\nmargin-aware feature space optimization. Comprehensive evaluations across\ndiverse architectures and datasets demonstrate that MF-CLIP substantially\nadvances the state-of-the-art in no-box attacks, surpassing existing baselines\nby 15.23% on standard models and achieving a 9.52% improvement on adversarially\ntrained models.

                    "value": "The vulnerability of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to adversarial attacks poses\na significant challenge to their deployment in safety-critical applications.\nWhile extensive research has addressed various attack scenarios, the no-box\nattack setting where adversaries have no prior knowledge, including access to\ntraining data of the target model, remains relatively underexplored despite its\npractical relevance. This work presents a systematic investigation into\nleveraging large-scale Vision-Language Models (VLMs), particularly CLIP, as\nsurrogate models for executing no-box attacks. Our theoretical and empirical\nanalyses reveal a key limitation in the execution of no-box attacks stemming\nfrom insufficient discriminative capabilities for direct application of vanilla\nCLIP as a surrogate model. To address this limitation, we propose MF-CLIP: a\nnovel framework that enhances CLIP's effectiveness as a surrogate model through\nmargin-aware feature space optimization. Comprehensive evaluations across\ndiverse architectures and datasets demonstrate that MF-CLIP substantially\nadvances the state-of-the-art in no-box attacks, surpassing existing baselines\nby 15.23% on standard models and achieving a 9.52% improvement on adversarially\ntrained models.

We show advantages of finetuning over standard, off-the-shelf RAG\napproaches, which can offer only modest improvement due to the unfamiliar\ntarget domain."

This trend,\ncoupled with the increasing importance of AI in 6G and beyond cellular\nnetworks, presents opportunities for innovative AI applications and systems at\nthe network edge. While AI models and services are well-managed in cloud\nsystems, achieving similar maturity for serving network needs remains an open\nchallenge. Existing open solutions are emerging and are yet to consider\ndemocratization requirements. In this work, we identify key requirements for\ndemocratization and propose NAOMI, a solution for democratizing AI/ML workflows\nat the network edge designed based on those requirements.

At its core,\nour approach combines (i) a symbolic regression mechanism exploring\nrelationship patterns among detected entities and (ii) a LLM-guided\nstrategically guiding the search toward meaningful expressions. These\ndiscovered symbolic rules transform low-level visual perception into\ninterpretable event understanding, providing a transparent reasoning path from\nobjects to events with strong transferability across domains.We compared our\ntraining-free framework against specialized event recognition systems across\ndiverse application domains. Experiments demonstrate that our framework\nenhances multiple object detector architectures to recognize complex events\nsuch as illegal fishing activities (75% AUROC, +8.36% improvement),\nconstruction safety violations (+15.77%), and abnormal crowd behaviors\n(+23.16%). The code will be released soon."

Our\nframework comprises three key steps: multi-round semantic enhanced retrieval\nand irrelevant information isolation for Challenge 1, and schema extraction\nenhancement for Challenge 2. We evaluate our method performance of schema\nlinking on the SPIDER and BIRD benchmarks, and the ability to adapt existing\nText-to-SQL models to real-world environments on the SPIDER 2.0-lite benchmark.\nExperiments show that LinkAlign outperforms existing baselines in\nmulti-database settings, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness. On the\nother hand, our method ranks highest among models excluding those using long\nchain-of-thought reasoning LLMs. This work bridges the gap between current\nresearch and real-world scenarios, providing a practical solution for robust\nand scalable schema linking. The codes are available at\nhttps://github.com/Satissss/LinkAlign."

However, novel architectures relying on recurrent\nmechanisms, such as xLSTM and Mamba, have been proposed as alternatives to\nattention-based models. Although computation is done differently than with the\nattention mechanism mechanism, these recurrent models yield good results and\nsometimes even outperform state-of-the-art attention-based models. In this\nwork, we propose Distil-xLSTM, an xLSTM-based Small Language Model (SLM)\ntrained by distilling knowledge from a Large Language Model (LLM) that shows\npromising results while being compute and scale efficient.

However, novel architectures relying on recurrent\nmechanisms, such as xLSTM and Mamba, have been proposed as alternatives to\nattention-based models. Although computation is done differently than with the\nattention mechanism mechanism, these recurrent models yield good results and\nsometimes even outperform state-of-the-art attention-based models. In this\nwork, we propose Distil-xLSTM, an xLSTM-based Small Language Model (SLM)\ntrained by distilling knowledge from a Large Language Model (LLM) that shows\npromising results while being compute and scale efficient.

Motivated by the increasingly large context windows supported by large\nlanguage models, we propose to fine-tune an autoregressive language model for\nend-toend KPB.

These agents promise to\nrevolutionize mobile computing by allowing users to automate complex mobile\ntasks through simple natural language instructions. However, the inherent\nprobabilistic nature of LFMs, coupled with the ambiguity and context-dependence\nof mobile tasks, makes LFM-based automation unreliable and prone to errors. To\naddress this critical challenge, we introduce VeriSafe Agent (VSA): a formal\nverification system that serves as a logically grounded safeguard for Mobile\nGUI Agents. VSA is designed to deterministically ensure that an agent's actions\nstrictly align with user intent before conducting an action. At its core, VSA\nintroduces a novel autoformalization technique that translates natural language\nuser instructions into a formally verifiable specification, expressed in our\ndomain-specific language (DSL). This enables runtime, rule-based verification,\nallowing VSA to detect and prevent erroneous actions executing an action,\neither by providing corrective feedback or halting unsafe behavior. To the best\nof our knowledge, VSA is the first attempt to bring the rigor of formal\nverification to GUI agent. effectively bridging the gap between LFM-driven\nautomation and formal software verification. We implement VSA using\noff-the-shelf LLM services (GPT-4o) and evaluate its performance on 300 user\ninstructions across 18 widely used mobile apps. The results demonstrate that\nVSA achieves 94.3%-98.33% accuracy in verifying agent actions, representing a\nsignificant 20.4%-25.6% improvement over existing LLM-based verification\nmethods, and consequently increases the GUI agent's task completion rate by\n90%-130%.",

Based on these observations, we propose that the\nlayerwise sparsity of LLMs should adhere to three principles:\n\\emph{non-uniformity}, \\emph{pruning metric dependency}, and \\emph{uniform\nlayerwise redundancy level} in the pruned model. To this end, we proposed\nMaximum Redundancy Pruning (MRP), an iterative pruning algorithm that prunes in\nthe most redundant layers (\\emph{i.e.}, those with the highest non-outlier\nratio) at each iteration.

However, the performance of LLMs\nin repository-level context code translation remains suboptimal due to complex\ndependencies and context, hindering their adoption in industrial settings. In\nthis work, we propose a novel LLM-based code translation technique K-Trans,\nwhich leverages triple knowledge augmentation to enhance LLM's translation\nquality under repository context in real-world software development. First,\nK-Trans constructs a translation knowledge base by extracting relevant\ninformation from target-language codebases, the repository being translated,\nand prior translation results. Second, for each function to be translated,\nK-Trans retrieves relevant triple knowledge, including target-language code\nsamples, dependency usage examples, and successful translation function pairs,\nserving as references to enhance LLM for translation. Third, K-Trans constructs\na knowledge-augmented translation prompt using the retrieved triple knowledge\nand employs LLMs to generate the translated code while preserving repository\ncontext. It further leverages LLMs for self-debugging, enhancing translation\ncorrectness.\n  The experiments show that K-Trans substantially outperforms the baseline\nadapted from previous work by 19.4%/40.2% relative improvement in pass@1 and\n0.138 in CodeBLEU. It is important to note that the results also demonstrate\nthat each knowledge significantly contributes to K-Trans's effectiveness in\nhandling repository-level context code translation, with dependency usage\nexamples making the most notable contribution.

SAP shows great potential for enhancing\nintraoperative guidance and automating procedures. However, it faces challenges\nsuch as understanding instrument-action relationships and tracking surgical\nprogress. Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in understanding surgical\nvideo content but remain underexplored for predictive decision-making in SAP,\nas they focus mainly on retrospective analysis. Challenges like data privacy,\ncomputational demands, and modality-specific constraints further highlight\nsignificant research gaps. To tackle these challenges, we introduce LLM-SAP, a\nLarge Language Models-based Surgical Action Planning framework that predicts\nfuture actions and generates text responses by interpreting natural language\nprompts of surgical goals. The text responses potentially support surgical\neducation, intraoperative decision-making, procedure documentation, and skill\nanalysis. LLM-SAP integrates two novel modules: the Near-History Focus Memory\nModule (NHF-MM) for modeling historical states and the prompts factory for\naction planning. We evaluate LLM-SAP on our constructed CholecT50-SAP dataset\nusing models like Qwen2.5 and Qwen2-VL, demonstrating its effectiveness in\nnext-action prediction. Pre-trained LLMs are tested zero-shot, and supervised\nfine-tuning (SFT) with LoRA is implemented to address data privacy concerns.\nOur experiments show that Qwen2.5-72B-SFT surpasses Qwen2.5-72B with a 19.3%\nhigher accuracy.",

Evaluations\nshow that Jenga improves GPU memory utilization by up to 79.6%, and increases\nserving throughput by up to 4.92x (1.80x on average)."

These models typically follow a\ntwo-stage training paradigm: pre-training with math-related corpora and\npost-training with problem datasets for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Despite\nthese efforts, the improvements in mathematical reasoning achieved through\ncontinued pre-training (CPT) are often less significant compared to those\nobtained via SFT. This study addresses this discrepancy by exploring\nalternative strategies during the pre-training phase, focusing on the use of\nproblem-solving data over general mathematical corpora. We investigate three\nprimary research questions: (1) Can problem-solving data enhance the model's\nmathematical reasoning capabilities more effectively than general mathematical\ncorpora during CPT? (2) Are synthetic data from the same source equally\neffective, and which synthesis methods are most efficient? (3) How do the\ncapabilities developed from the same problem-solving data differ between the\nCPT and SFT stages, and what factors contribute to these differences? Our\nfindings indicate that problem-solving data significantly enhances the model's\nmathematical capabilities compared to general mathematical corpora. We also\nidentify effective data synthesis methods, demonstrating that the tutorship\namplification synthesis method achieves the best performance. Furthermore,\nwhile SFT facilitates instruction-following abilities, it underperforms\ncompared to CPT with the same data, which can be partially attributed to its\npoor learning capacity for more challenging problem-solving data.

However, existing methods often struggle with noisy OSM\ndata and incomplete sensor observations, leading to inaccuracies in trajectory\nplanning. These challenges are particularly evident in complex driving\nscenarios, such as at intersections or facing occlusions. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a robust and explainable two-stage framework to learn an\nOrientation Field (OrField) for robot navigation by integrating LiDAR scans and\nOSM routes. In the first stage, we introduce the novel representation, OrField,\nwhich can provide orientations for each grid on the map, reasoning jointly from\nnoisy LiDAR scans and OSM routes. To generate a robust OrField, we train a deep\nneural network by encoding a versatile initial OrField and output an optimized\nOrField. Based on OrField, we propose two trajectory planners for OSM-guided\nrobot navigation, called Field-RRT* and Field-Bezier, respectively, in the\nsecond stage by improving the Rapidly Exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm and\nBezier curve to estimate the trajectories. Thanks to the robustness of OrField\nwhich captures both global and local information, Field-RRT* and Field-Bezier\ncan generate accurate and reliable trajectories even in challenging conditions.\nWe validate our approach through experiments on the SemanticKITTI dataset and\nour own campus dataset.

We propose the Shannon Entropy Distribution Hallucination\nDetector (ShED-HD), a novel hallucination detection framework that bridges this\ngap by classifying sequence-level entropy patterns using a lightweight BiLSTM\narchitecture with single-headed attention. In contrast to prior approaches,\nShED-HD efficiently detects distinctive uncertainty patterns across entire\noutput sequences, preserving contextual awareness. Through in-depth evaluation\non three datasets (BioASQ, TriviaQA, and Jeopardy Questions), we show that\nShED-HD significantly outperforms other computationally efficient approaches in\nthe out-of-distribution setting, while achieving comparable performance in the\nin-distribution setting. ShED-HD facilitates hallucination detection that is\nlow-cost, accurate, and generalizable, improving the credibility of content\ngenerated by LLMs in resource-constrained environments where trustworthy AI\nfunctionality is crucial.",

We propose the Shannon Entropy Distribution Hallucination\nDetector (ShED-HD), a novel hallucination detection framework that bridges this\ngap by classifying sequence-level entropy patterns using a lightweight BiLSTM\narchitecture with single-headed attention. In contrast to prior approaches,\nShED-HD efficiently detects distinctive uncertainty patterns across entire\noutput sequences, preserving contextual awareness. Through in-depth evaluation\non three datasets (BioASQ, TriviaQA, and Jeopardy Questions), we show that\nShED-HD significantly outperforms other computationally efficient approaches in\nthe out-of-distribution setting, while achieving comparable performance in the\nin-distribution setting. ShED-HD facilitates hallucination detection that is\nlow-cost, accurate, and generalizable, improving the credibility of content\ngenerated by LLMs in resource-constrained environments where trustworthy AI\nfunctionality is crucial."
