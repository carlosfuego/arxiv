                "summary": "Quantization is a widely-used compression technology to reduce the overhead\nof serving large language models (LLMs) on terminal devices and in cloud data\ncenters. However, prevalent quantization methods, such as 8-bit\nweight-activation or 4-bit weight-only quantization, achieve limited\nperformance improvements due to poor support for low-precision (e.g., 4-bit)\nactivation. This work, for the first time, realizes practical W4A4KV4 serving\nfor LLMs, fully utilizing the INT4 tensor cores on modern GPUs and reducing the\nmemory bottleneck caused by the KV cache. Specifically, we propose a novel\nfine-grained mixed-precision quantization algorithm (FMPQ) that compresses most\nactivations into 4-bit with negligible accuracy loss. To support\nmixed-precision matrix multiplication for W4A4 and W4A8, we develop a highly\noptimized W4Ax kernel.

                    "value": "Quantization is a widely-used compression technology to reduce the overhead\nof serving large language models (LLMs) on terminal devices and in cloud data\ncenters. However, prevalent quantization methods, such as 8-bit\nweight-activation or 4-bit weight-only quantization, achieve limited\nperformance improvements due to poor support for low-precision (e.g., 4-bit)\nactivation. This work, for the first time, realizes practical W4A4KV4 serving\nfor LLMs, fully utilizing the INT4 tensor cores on modern GPUs and reducing the\nmemory bottleneck caused by the KV cache. Specifically, we propose a novel\nfine-grained mixed-precision quantization algorithm (FMPQ) that compresses most\nactivations into 4-bit with negligible accuracy loss.

Compared to high-precision quantization methods, QSPEC\nempirically boosts token generation throughput by up to 1.80x without any\nquality compromise, distinguishing it from other low-precision quantization\napproaches. This enhancement is also consistent across various serving tasks,\nmodel sizes, quantization methods, and batch sizes. Unlike existing speculative\ndecoding techniques, our approach reuses weights and the KV cache, avoiding\nadditional memory overhead. Furthermore, QSPEC offers a plug-and-play advantage\nwithout requiring any training.

To\naccommodate SAR, we develop a straightforward architecture termed Fully Masked\nTransformer. We reveal that existing AR variants correspond to specific design\nchoices of sequence order and output intervals within the SAR framework, with\nAR and Masked AR (MAR) as two extreme instances. Notably, SAR facilitates a\nseamless transition from AR to MAR, where intermediate states allow for\ntraining a causal model that benefits from both few-step inference and KV cache\nacceleration, thus leveraging the advantages of both AR and MAR. On the\nImageNet benchmark, we carefully explore the properties of SAR by analyzing the\nimpact of sequence order and output intervals on performance, as well as the\ngeneralization ability regarding inference order and steps. We further validate\nthe potential of SAR by training a 900M text-to-image model capable of\nsynthesizing photo-realistic images with any resolution.

We leverage a\nfoundational 3D model trained extensively on point cloud data. Drawing from\nrecent improvements in foundation models, known for their ability to work well\nacross different tasks, we propose a novel strategy that does not require\nadditional training to adapt to new tasks. Our approach uses a dual cache\nsystem: first, it uses previous test samples based on how confident the model\nwas in its predictions to prevent forgetting, and second, it includes a small\nnumber of new task samples to prevent overfitting. This dynamic adaptation\nensures strong performance across different learning tasks without needing lots\nof fine-tuning. We tested our approach on datasets like ModelNet, ShapeNet,\nScanObjectNN, and CO3D, showing that it outperforms other FSCIL methods and\ndemonstrating its effectiveness and versatility.

However, most studies focus on addressing only one of these\nbottlenecks and do not adequately support dynamic adjustment of sparsity\nconcerning distinct layers or tasks. In this paper, we present ZipVL, an\nefficient inference framework designed for LVLMs that resolves both computation\nand memory bottlenecks through a dynamic ratio allocation strategy of important\ntokens. This ratio is adaptively determined based on the layer-specific\ndistribution of attention scores, rather than fixed hyper-parameters, thereby\nimproving efficiency for less complex tasks while maintaining high performance\nfor more challenging ones. Then we select important tokens based on their\nnormalized attention scores and perform attention mechanism solely on those\nimportant tokens to accelerate the prefill phase. To mitigate the memory\nbottleneck in the decoding phase, we employ mixed-precision quantization to the\nKV cache, where high-bit quantization is used for caches of important tokens,\nwhile low-bit quantization is applied to those of less importance. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that ZipVL can accelerate the prefill phase by\n2.6$\\times$ and reduce GPU memory usage by 50.0%, with a minimal accuracy\nreduction of only 0.2% on Video-MME benchmark over LongVA-7B model, effectively\nenhancing the generation efficiency of LVLMs.",

To achieve this, our method introduces the\nfollowing technical designs. 1) We directly compress the activations (i.e. keys\nand values at every layer), rather than leveraging soft prompts to relay\ninformation (which constitute a major bottleneck to encapsulate the complex\ninformation within long contexts). 2) We tailor the compression workflow, where\neach fine-grained input unit is progressively compressed, enabling high-quality\ncompression and efficient computation during both training and inference. 3) We\ntrain the model through compression-based auto-regression, making full use of\nplain texts and instructional data to optimize the model's compression\nperformance. 4) During training, we randomly sample a compression ratio at each\nstep, teaching the model to support a wide range of compression configurations.\nExtensive evaluations are conducted on various long-context tasks whose lengths\n(e.g., 128K) may far exceed the maximum training length (20K), such as document\nunderstanding, few-shot learning, and Needle-in-a-Haystack. Whilst existing\nmethods struggle to handle these challenging tasks, Activation Beacon maintains\na comparable performance to the uncompressed baseline across various scenarios,\nachieving a 2x acceleration in inference time and an 8x reduction of memory\ncosts for KV cache.

Probabilistic voxel mapping requires storing past point clouds and\nre-iterating on them to update the uncertainty every iteration, which consumes\nlarge memory space and CPU cycles. To solve this problem, we propose a\ntwo-folded strategy. First, we introduce a compact point-free representation\nfor probabilistic voxels and derive a cumulative update of the planar\nuncertainty without caching original point clouds. Our voxel structure only\nkeeps track of a predetermined set of statistics for points that lie inside it.\nThis method reduces the runtime complexity from $O(MN)$ to $O(N)$ and the space\ncomplexity from $O(N)$ to $O(1)$ where $M$ is the number of iterations and $N$\nis the number of points. Second, to further minimize memory usage and enhance\nmapping accuracy, we provide a strategy to dynamically merge voxels associated\nwith the same physical planes by taking advantage of the geometric features in\nthe real world. Rather than scanning for these coalescible voxels constantly at\nevery iteration, our merging strategy accumulates voxels in a\nlocality-sensitive hash and triggers merging lazily. On-demand merging not only\nreduces memory footprint with minimal computational overhead but also improves\nlocalization accuracy thanks to cross-voxel denoising. Experiments exhibit 20%\nhigher accuracy, 20% faster performance and 70% lower memory consumption than\nthe state-of-the-art.",

Most of the existing\nKV-cache compression algorithms attempted to sparsify the sequence of tokens by\ntaking advantage of the different importance of tokens. However, most of these\nmethods treat all layers equally, allocating the same KV budget to each layer.\nThis approach is suboptimal, as some layers may be less sensitive to input\ntokens yet still receive the same budget as others. In this work, we found that\nby identifying the importance of attention layers, we could optimize the\nKV-cache jointly from two dimensions, i.e., sequence-wise and layer-wise. Based\non our observations regarding layer-wise importance in inference, we propose\nSqueezeAttention to precisely optimize the allocation of KV-cache budget among\nlayers on-the-fly and then incorporate three representative sequence-wise\nalgorithms to compress the KV-cache for each layer with its very own budget.\nSpecifically, we first measure each layer's importance by calculating the\ncosine similarity of the input prompt differences before and after the\nself-attention layers. Based on this similarity, we then categorize the layers\ninto two groups and adjust their KV budgets accordingly. By optimizing the\nKV-cache from both sequence's and layer's dimensions, SqueezeAttention achieves\naround 30% to 70% of the memory reductions and up to 2.2 times of throughput\nimprovements in a wide range of LLMs and benchmarks.

Increasing costs may lead to fewer independently\noperated nodes in the network, which poses risks to decentralization (and hence\nnetwork security), but also pushes decentralized app developers towards\ncentrally hosted API services.\n  This paper introduces a new protocol that allows validator nodes to\nparticipate in a blockchain network without the need to store the full state of\nthe network on each node. The key idea is to use the blockchain network as both\na replicated state machine and as a distributed storage system. By distributing\nstates across nodes and enabling efficient data retrieval through a\nKademlia-inspired routing protocol, we reduce storage costs for validators.\nCryptographic proofs (such as Merkle proofs) are used to allow nodes to verify\ndata stored by other nodes without having to trust those nodes directly. While\nthe protocol trades off data storage for increased network bandwidth, we show\nhow gossiping and caching can minimize the increased bandwidth needs.\n  To validate our state sharing protocol, we conduct an extensive quantitative\nanalysis of Ethereum's data storage and data access patterns. Our findings\nindicate that while our protocol significantly lowers storage needs, it comes\nwith an increased bandwidth usage ranging from 1.5 MB to 5 MB per block,\ntranslating to an additional monthly bandwidth of 319 GB to 1,065 GB. Despite\nthis, the size remains small enough such that it can be passed to all nodes and\nvalidated within Ethereum's 12-second block validation window. Further analysis\nshows that Merkle proofs are the most significant contributor to the additional\nbandwidth. To address this concern, we also analyze the impact of switching to\nthe more space-efficient Verkle Proofs.",

However, its memory consumption scales\nlinearly with sequence length and batch size, posing a significant bottleneck\nin LLM deployment. Existing approaches to mitigate this issue include: (1)\nefficient attention variants integrated in upcycling stages, which requires\nextensive parameter tuning thus unsuitable for pre-trained LLMs; (2) KV cache\ncompression at test time, primarily through token eviction policies, which\noften overlook inter-layer dependencies and can be task-specific.\n  This paper introduces an orthogonal approach to KV cache compression. We\npropose a low-rank approximation of KV weight matrices, allowing for plug-in\nintegration with existing transformer-based LLMs without model retraining. To\neffectively compress KV cache at the weight level, we adjust for layerwise\nsensitivity and introduce a progressive compression strategy, which is\nsupported by our theoretical analysis on how compression errors accumulate in\ndeep networks. Our method is designed to function without model tuning in\nupcycling stages or task-specific profiling in test stages. Extensive\nexperiments with LLaMA models ranging from 8B to 70B parameters across various\ntasks show that our approach significantly reduces the GPU memory footprint\nwhile maintaining performance.",

                    "value": "The Key-Value (KV) cache is a crucial component in serving transformer-based\nautoregressive large language models (LLMs), enabling faster inference by\nstoring previously computed KV vectors. However, its memory consumption scales\nlinearly with sequence length and batch size, posing a significant bottleneck\nin LLM deployment. Existing approaches to mitigate this issue include: (1)\nefficient attention variants integrated in upcycling stages, which requires\nextensive parameter tuning thus unsuitable for pre-trained LLMs; (2) KV cache\ncompression at test time, primarily through token eviction policies, which\noften overlook inter-layer dependencies and can be task-specific.\n  This paper introduces an orthogonal approach to KV cache compression. We\npropose a low-rank approximation of KV weight matrices, allowing for plug-in\nintegration with existing transformer-based LLMs without model retraining. To\neffectively compress KV cache at the weight level, we adjust for layerwise\nsensitivity and introduce a progressive compression strategy, which is\nsupported by our theoretical analysis on how compression errors accumulate in\ndeep networks. Our method is designed to function without model tuning in\nupcycling stages or task-specific profiling in test stages. Extensive\nexperiments with LLaMA models ranging from 8B to 70B parameters across various\ntasks show that our approach significantly reduces the GPU memory footprint\nwhile maintaining performance."

For instance, a\nrobot in an unfamiliar house initially wouldn't know the locations of objects\nneeded for tasks and might perform inefficiently. However, as it gathers more\nexperience, it should learn the layout of its environment and remember where\nobjects are, allowing it to complete new tasks more efficiently. To enable such\nrapid adaptation to new tasks, we present ReLIC, a new approach for in-context\nreinforcement learning (RL) for embodied agents. With ReLIC, agents are capable\nof adapting to new environments using 64,000 steps of in-context experience\nwith full attention while being trained through self-generated experience via\nRL. We achieve this by proposing a novel policy update scheme for on-policy RL\ncalled \"partial updates'' as well as a Sink-KV mechanism that enables effective\nutilization of a long observation history for embodied agents. Our method\noutperforms a variety of meta-RL baselines in adapting to unseen houses in an\nembodied multi-object navigation task. In addition, we find that ReLIC is\ncapable of few-shot imitation learning despite never being trained with expert\ndemonstrations. We also provide a comprehensive analysis of ReLIC, highlighting\nthat the combination of large-scale RL training, the proposed partial updates\nscheme, and the Sink-KV are essential for effective in-context learning. The\ncode for ReLIC and all our experiments is at https://github.com/aielawady/relic",

However, scaling the\ngeneration inference of LLMs to such long contexts incurs significant\nadditional computation load, and demands a substantial GPU memory footprint to\nmaintain the key-value (KV) cache of transformer-based LLMs. Existing KV cache\ncompression methods, such as quantization, face memory bottlenecks as context\nlength increases, while static-sized caches, such as eviction, suffer from\ninefficient policies. These limitations restrict deployment on consumer-grade\ndevices like a single Nvidia 4090 GPU. To overcome this, we propose Locret, a\nframework for long-context LLM inference that introduces retaining heads to\nevaluate the causal importance of KV cache units, allowing for more accurate\neviction within a fixed cache size. Locret is fine-tuned on top of the frozen\nbackbone LLM using a minimal amount of data from standard long-context SFT\ndatasets. During inference, we evict low-importance cache units along with a\nchunked prefill pattern, significantly reducing peak GPU memory usage. We\nconduct an extensive empirical study to evaluate Locret, where the experimental\nresults show that Locret outperforms the recent competitive approaches,\nincluding InfLLM, Quantization, SirLLM, and MInference, in terms of memory\nefficiency and the quality of generated contents -- Locret achieves over a 20x\nand 8x KV cache compression ratio compared to the full KV cache for\nPhi-3-mini-128K and Llama-3.1-8B-instruct. Additionally, Locret can be combined\nwith other methods, such as quantization and token merging. To our knowledge,\nLocret is the first framework capable of deploying Llama-3.1-8B or similar\nmodels on a single Nvidia 4090 GPU, enabling 128K long-context inference\nwithout compromising generation quality, and requiring little additional system\noptimizations.",

                "summary": "Training and serving long-context large language models (LLMs) incurs\nsubstantial overhead. To address this, two critical steps are often required: a\npretrained LLM typically undergoes a separate stage for context length\nextension by training on long-context data, followed by architectural\nmodifications to reduce the overhead of KV cache during serving. This paper\nargues that integrating length extension with a GPU-friendly KV cache reduction\narchitecture not only reduces training overhead during length extension, but\nalso achieves better long-context performance. This leads to our proposed\nLongGen, which finetunes a pretrained LLM into an efficient architecture during\nlength extension. LongGen builds on three key insights: (1) Sparse attention\npatterns, such as window attention (attending to recent tokens), attention sink\n(initial ones), and blockwise sparse attention (strided token blocks) are\nwell-suited for building efficient long-context models, primarily due to their\nGPU-friendly memory access patterns, enabling efficiency gains not just\ntheoretically but in practice as well. (2) It is essential for the model to\nhave direct access to all tokens. A hybrid architecture with 1/3 full attention\nlayers and 2/3 efficient ones achieves a balanced trade-off between efficiency\nand long-context performance. (3) Lightweight training on 5B long-context data\nis sufficient to extend the hybrid model's context length from 4K to 128K.\n  We evaluate LongGen on both Llama-2 7B and Llama-2 70B, demonstrating its\neffectiveness across different scales. During training with 128K-long contexts,\nLongGen achieves 1.55x training speedup and reduces wall-clock time by 36%,\ncompared to a full-attention baseline. During inference, LongGen reduces KV\ncache memory by 62%, achieving 1.67x prefilling speedup and 1.41x decoding\nspeedup.",

The core\nidea of this work is to maintain states based on the LLM's response, letting\nthe LLM become self-aware of current status and think step by step in a\nmulti-round chain-of-thought paradigm. Our experiment on the state of textual\nlength has shown the controllability and effectiveness of the Self-controller.\nWe further implement a binary search algorithm to accelerate the generation\nprocess based on the linearity and monotonicity of the textual length state.\nAnother advantage of the Self-controller comes with DeepSeek's Context Caching\ntechnology, which significantly saves computational token consumption when a\ncluster of conversations shares the same prefix of context. Theoretically, we\nprove that in this scenario the extra time complexity is $O(c \\log n)$. Results\nof the back-of-the-envelope estimation suggest that the token consumption of\nour method is no more than twice as much as that of the trivial single-round\ngeneration.

The core\nidea of this work is to maintain states based on the LLM's response, letting\nthe LLM become self-aware of current status and think step by step in a\nmulti-round chain-of-thought paradigm. Our experiment on the state of textual\nlength has shown the controllability and effectiveness of the Self-controller.\nWe further implement a binary search algorithm to accelerate the generation\nprocess based on the linearity and monotonicity of the textual length state.\nAnother advantage of the Self-controller comes with DeepSeek's Context Caching\ntechnology, which significantly saves computational token consumption when a\ncluster of conversations shares the same prefix of context. Theoretically, we\nprove that in this scenario the extra time complexity is $O(c \\log n)$. Results\nof the back-of-the-envelope estimation suggest that the token consumption of\nour method is no more than twice as much as that of the trivial single-round\ngeneration. Furthermore, our ablation study on word constraints demonstrates\nthe Self-controller's consistent controllability across all foundation models."

Unlike\nfew-shot learning methods in natural images that can leverage the labels of\neach image, existing few-shot WSI classification methods only utilize a small\nnumber of fine-grained labels or weakly supervised slide labels for training in\norder to avoid expensive fine-grained annotation. They lack sufficient mining\nof available WSIs, severely limiting WSI classification performance. To address\nthe above issues, we propose a novel and efficient dual-tier few-shot learning\nparadigm for WSI classification, named FAST. FAST consists of a dual-level\nannotation strategy and a dual-branch classification framework. Firstly, to\navoid expensive fine-grained annotation, we collect a very small number of WSIs\nat the slide level, and annotate an extremely small number of patches. Then, to\nfully mining the available WSIs, we use all the patches and available patch\nlabels to build a cache branch, which utilizes the labeled patches to learn the\nlabels of unlabeled patches and through knowledge retrieval for patch\nclassification. In addition to the cache branch, we also construct a prior\nbranch that includes learnable prompt vectors, using the text encoder of\nvisual-language models for patch classification. Finally, we integrate the\nresults from both branches to achieve WSI classification. Extensive experiments\non binary and multi-class datasets demonstrate that our proposed method\nsignificantly surpasses existing few-shot classification methods and approaches\nthe accuracy of fully supervised methods with only 0.22$\\%$ annotation costs.\nAll codes and models will be publicly available on\nhttps://github.com/fukexue/FAST.",

The segments were converted\nto stereolithographic (STL) files and smoothed in Fusion360. A slit to\naccommodate a radiochromic film (RCF) was added at the location of the glioma\ntumor. UPDOG was 3D printed on a polyjet printer using VeroUltraWhite ($\\rho$ =\n1.19-1.20 g/cm\\textsuperscript{3}) for the bone and Agilus30 ($\\rho$ =\n1.14-1.15 g/cm\\textsuperscript{3}) for the soft tissue. CT scans of UPDOG were\nacquired on a clinical CT scanner. An LD-V1 RCF was inserted into UPDOG and\nirradiated with a kV x-ray source from two angles. The delivered dose to the\nRCF was compared to Monte Carlo (MC) simulations performed in TOPAS.\n  Results: The bone and soft tissue segments in UPDOG were mimicked the patient\nanatomy well with tube voltage-dependent CT numbers. The contrast in HU was of\n49, 47 and 50 HU for the 80, 100, and 120 kVp scans, respectively, sufficient\nfor anatomy visualization. The irradiations delivered a maximum dose to RCF of\n284 mGy which was compared to the results of MC simulations using a depth dose\ncurve and central-axis (CAX) beam profiles. The mean difference in CAX profiles\nand PDD between RCF and MC results was 15.9\\% and 2.3\\%, respectively.\n  Conclusions: We have demonstrated that UPDOG is a useful QA tool for kV\ncanine radiotherapy. UPDOG successfully anatomically mimicked the dog anatomy,\nwith a reduced but sufficient bone contrast. We showed that dose delivered to a\ncanine glioma with kV x-rays can be successfully measured with an RCF\npositioned at the tumor location.",

The test-time\nposterior probabilities are then computed using the estimated distributions\nbased on Bayes' theorem for adaptation purposes. To further enhance the\nadaptability on the uncertain samples, we introduce a new human-in-the-loop\nparadigm which identifies uncertain samples, collects human-feedback, and\nincorporates it into the Dota framework.

The test-time\nposterior probabilities are then computed using the estimated distributions\nbased on Bayes' theorem for adaptation purposes. To further enhance the\nadaptability on the uncertain samples, we introduce a new human-in-the-loop\nparadigm which identifies uncertain samples, collects human-feedback, and\nincorporates it into the Dota framework. Extensive experiments validate that\nDota enables CLIP to continually learn, resulting in a significant improvement\ncompared to current state-of-the-art methods."

This paper introduces the concept of Meta-Chunking, which refers to a\ngranularity between sentences and paragraphs, consisting of a collection of\nsentences within a paragraph that have deep linguistic logical connections. To\nimplement Meta-Chunking, we designed two strategies based on LLMs: Margin\nSampling Chunking and Perplexity Chunking. The former employs LLMs to perform\nbinary classification on whether consecutive sentences need to be segmented,\nmaking decisions based on the probability difference obtained from margin\nsampling. The latter precisely identifies text chunk boundaries by analyzing\nthe characteristics of perplexity distribution. Additionally, considering the\ninherent complexity of different texts, we propose a strategy that combines\nMeta-Chunking with dynamic merging to achieve a balance between fine-grained\nand coarse-grained text chunking. Experiments conducted on eleven datasets\ndemonstrate that Meta-Chunking can more efficiently improve the performance of\nsingle-hop and multi-hop question answering based on RAG. For instance, on the\n2WikiMultihopQA dataset, it outperforms similarity chunking by 1.32 while only\nconsuming 45.8% of the time.

This allows\neliciting in principle arbitrarily flexible densities, but flow estimation is\nsusceptible to the challenge of collapsing or diverging probability mass that\nmakes it difficult in practice. We tackle this problem by introducing a novel\nfunctional prior for the flow, motivated by a decision-theoretic argument, and\nshow empirically that the belief density can be inferred as the function-space\nmaximum a posteriori estimate.

This allows\neliciting in principle arbitrarily flexible densities, but flow estimation is\nsusceptible to the challenge of collapsing or diverging probability mass that\nmakes it difficult in practice. We tackle this problem by introducing a novel\nfunctional prior for the flow, motivated by a decision-theoretic argument, and\nshow empirically that the belief density can be inferred as the function-space\nmaximum a posteriori estimate. We demonstrate our method by eliciting\nmultivariate belief densities of simulated experts, including the prior belief\nof a general-purpose large language model over a real-world dataset."

To address these challenges, in the\nsystem design, we represent the model as a directed acyclic graph of operators\n(OP-DAG). Each node in the DAG represents the operator in the DNNs, while the\nedge represents the data dependency between operators. Based on this design, 1)\nusers are allowed to customize any DNN without caring low-level operator\nimplementation; 2) we enable the task scheduling with the more fine-grained\nsub-tasks, offering more optimization space; 3) a DAG runtime executor can\nimplement RAD withour requiring the consistent low-level ML framework versions.\n  To enhance system efficiency, we implement a workload estimator and design an\nOP-Fence scheduler to cluster devices with similar bandwidths together and\npartition the DAG to increase throughput. Additionally, we propose an AdaTopK\ncompressor to adaptively compress intermediate activations and gradients at the\nslowest communication links. To evaluate the convergence and efficiency of our\nsystem and algorithms, we train ResNet-101 and GPT-2 on three real-world\ntestbeds using 48 GPUs connected with 8 Mbps~10 Gbps networks. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that our system and method can achieve 1.45 - 9.39x speedup\ncompared to baseline methods while ensuring convergence.",

Many of these newly discovered AGN have broad permitted lines\n(typically H$\\alpha$), but are extremely weak in the X-rays. Here we present\nthe NIRSpec spectrum of the most extreme of these objects, GN-28074, an AGN at\n$z=2.26$ with prominent Balmer, Paschen and \\HeI broad lines, and with the\nhighest limit on the bolometric to X-ray luminosity ratio among all\nspectroscopically confirmed AGN in GOODS. This source is also characterized by\na mid-IR excess, most likely associated with the AGN torus' hot dust. The high\nbolometric luminosity and moderate redshift of this AGN allow us to explore its\nproperties more in depth relative to other JWST-discovered AGN. The NIRSpec\nspectrum reveals prominent, slightly blueshifted absorption of H$\\alpha$,\nH$\\beta$ and \\HeI$\\lambda$10830. The Balmer absorption lines require gas with\ndensities of $n_{\\rm H}> 10^8~{\\rm cm}^{-3}$, inconsistent with an ISM origin,\nbut fully consistent with clouds in the Broad Line Region (BLR). This finding\nsuggests that at least part of the X-ray weakness is due to high (Compton\nthick) X-ray absorption by (dust-free) clouds in the BLR, or in its outer,\nslowly outflowing regions. GN-28074 is also extremely radio-weak. The radio\nweakness can also be explained in terms of absorption, as the inferred density\nof the clouds responsible for H$\\alpha$ absorption makes them optically thick\nto radio emission through free-free absorption. Alternatively, in this and\nother JWST-discovered AGN, the nuclear magnetic field may have not developed\nproperly yet, resulting both in intrinsically weak radio emission and also lack\nof hot corona, hence intrinsic X-ray weakness. Finally, we show that recently\nproposed scenarios, invoking hyper-dense and ultra-metal-poor outflows or Raman\nscattering to explain the broad H$\\alpha$, are completely ruled out.",

In\nself-supervised GRL, paired graph augmentations are generated from each graph.\nIts objective is to infer similar representations for augmentations of the same\ngraph, but maximally distinguishable representations for augmentations of\ndifferent graphs. Analogous to image and language domains, the desiderata of an\nideal augmentation method include both (1) semantics-preservation; and (2)\ndata-perturbation; i.e., an augmented graph should preserve the semantics of\nits original graph while carrying sufficient variance. However, most existing\n(un-)/self-supervised GRL methods focus on data perturbation but largely\nneglect semantics preservation. To address this challenge, in this paper, we\npropose a novel method, Explanation-Preserving Augmentation (EPA), that\nleverages graph explanation techniques for generating augmented graphs that can\nbridge the gap between semantics-preservation and data-perturbation. EPA first\nuses a small number of labels to train a graph explainer to infer the\nsub-structures (explanations) that are most relevant to a graph's semantics.\nThese explanations are then used to generate semantics-preserving augmentations\nfor self-supervised GRL, namely EPA-GRL. We demonstrate theoretically, using an\nanalytical example, and through extensive experiments on a variety of benchmark\ndatasets that EPA-GRL outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) GRL methods,\nwhich are built upon semantics-agnostic data augmentations.",

In\nself-supervised GRL, paired graph augmentations are generated from each graph.\nIts objective is to infer similar representations for augmentations of the same\ngraph, but maximally distinguishable representations for augmentations of\ndifferent graphs. Analogous to image and language domains, the desiderata of an\nideal augmentation method include both (1) semantics-preservation; and (2)\ndata-perturbation; i.e., an augmented graph should preserve the semantics of\nits original graph while carrying sufficient variance. However, most existing\n(un-)/self-supervised GRL methods focus on data perturbation but largely\nneglect semantics preservation. To address this challenge, in this paper, we\npropose a novel method, Explanation-Preserving Augmentation (EPA), that\nleverages graph explanation techniques for generating augmented graphs that can\nbridge the gap between semantics-preservation and data-perturbation. EPA first\nuses a small number of labels to train a graph explainer to infer the\nsub-structures (explanations) that are most relevant to a graph's semantics.\nThese explanations are then used to generate semantics-preserving augmentations\nfor self-supervised GRL, namely EPA-GRL. We demonstrate theoretically, using an\nanalytical example, and through extensive experiments on a variety of benchmark\ndatasets that EPA-GRL outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) GRL methods,\nwhich are built upon semantics-agnostic data augmentations."

We expect our framework to\nprovide a solid guideline for future research on code generation."

By relying on an\nontological formalization of moral values as in the Moral Foundations Theory,\nrelying on the DnS Ontology Design Pattern, the \\textit{sandra} neuro-symbolic\nreasoner is used to infer values (fomalized as descriptions) that are\n\\emph{satisfied by} a certain sentence. Sentences, alongside their structured\nrepresentation, are automatically generated using an open-source Large Language\nModel.

However, detecting an\nobject's state and generating a state-sensitive plan for robots is challenging.\nRecently, pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models\n(VLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in generating plans. However, to the\nbest of our knowledge, there is hardly any investigation on whether LLMs or\nVLMs can also generate object state-sensitive plans. To study this, we\nintroduce an Object State-Sensitive Agent (OSSA), a task-planning agent\nempowered by pre-trained neural networks. We propose two methods for OSSA: (i)\na modular model consisting of a pre-trained vision processing module (dense\ncaptioning model, DCM) and a natural language processing model (LLM), and (ii)\na monolithic model consisting only of a VLM. To quantitatively evaluate the\nperformances of the two methods, we use tabletop scenarios where the task is to\nclear the table. We contribute a multimodal benchmark dataset that takes object\nstates into consideration. Our results show that both methods can be used for\nobject state-sensitive tasks, but the monolithic approach outperforms the\nmodular approach.

We here carry out a\nproof-of-principle study of such systematic error by considering signals\nproduced by quasi-circular, inspiraling black hole binaries through an\ninjection and recovery campaign. In particular, we study how unknown, but\ncalibrated, higher-order post-Newtonian corrections to the gravitational wave\nphase impact systematic error in recovered parameters. As a first study, we\nproduce injected data of non-spinning binaries as detected by a current,\nsecond-generation network of ground-based observatories and recover them with\nmodels of varying PN order in the phase. We find that the truncation of higher\norder (>3.5) post-Newtonian corrections to the phase can produce significant\nsystematic error even at signal-to-noise ratios of current detector networks.\nWe propose a method to mitigate systematic error by marginalizing over our\nignorance in the waveform through the inclusion of higher-order post-Newtonian\ncoefficients as new model parameters. We show that this method can reduce\nsystematic error greatly at the cost of increasing statistical error.",

                "summary": "The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into autonomous driving\nsystems demonstrates strong common sense and reasoning abilities, effectively\naddressing the pitfalls of purely data-driven methods. Current LLM-based agents\nrequire lengthy inference times and face challenges in interacting with\nreal-time autonomous driving environments. A key open question is whether we\ncan effectively leverage the knowledge from LLMs to train an efficient and\nrobust Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent. This paper introduces RAPID, a novel\n\\underline{\\textbf{R}}obust \\underline{\\textbf{A}}daptive\n\\underline{\\textbf{P}}olicy \\underline{\\textbf{I}}nfusion and\n\\underline{\\textbf{D}}istillation framework, which trains specialized\nmix-of-policy RL agents using data synthesized by an LLM-based driving agent\nand online adaptation. RAPID features three key designs: 1) utilization of\noffline data collected from an LLM agent to distil expert knowledge into RL\npolicies for faster real-time inference; 2) introduction of robust distillation\nin RL to inherit both performance and robustness from LLM-based teacher; and 3)\nemployment of a mix-of-policy approach for joint decision decoding with a\npolicy adapter. Through fine-tuning via online environment interaction, RAPID\nreduces the forgetting of LLM knowledge while maintaining adaptability to\ndifferent tasks.

                    "value": "The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into autonomous driving\nsystems demonstrates strong common sense and reasoning abilities, effectively\naddressing the pitfalls of purely data-driven methods. Current LLM-based agents\nrequire lengthy inference times and face challenges in interacting with\nreal-time autonomous driving environments. A key open question is whether we\ncan effectively leverage the knowledge from LLMs to train an efficient and\nrobust Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent. This paper introduces RAPID, a novel\n\\underline{\\textbf{R}}obust \\underline{\\textbf{A}}daptive\n\\underline{\\textbf{P}}olicy \\underline{\\textbf{I}}nfusion and\n\\underline{\\textbf{D}}istillation framework, which trains specialized\nmix-of-policy RL agents using data synthesized by an LLM-based driving agent\nand online adaptation. RAPID features three key designs: 1) utilization of\noffline data collected from an LLM agent to distil expert knowledge into RL\npolicies for faster real-time inference; 2) introduction of robust distillation\nin RL to inherit both performance and robustness from LLM-based teacher; and 3)\nemployment of a mix-of-policy approach for joint decision decoding with a\npolicy adapter. Through fine-tuning via online environment interaction, RAPID\nreduces the forgetting of LLM knowledge while maintaining adaptability to\ndifferent tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate RAPID's capability to\neffectively integrate LLM knowledge into scaled-down RL policies in an\nefficient, adaptable, and robust way. Code and checkpoints will be made\npublicly available upon acceptance."

Through an extensive simulation study involving over 22\nbillion regression models, this paper examines a range of symmetric,\nplatykurtic, and skewed distributions, testing sample sizes from 4 to 10,000.\nThe results show that it is sufficient that either the dependent or independent\nvariable follow a symmetric distribution for the t-values to converge at much\nsmaller sample sizes than $n=30$, unless the other variable is extremely\nskewed. This is contrary to previous guidance which suggests that the error\nterm needs to be normally distributed for this convergence to happen at low\n$n$. However, when both variables are highly skewed, much larger sample sizes\nare required.

Through extensive\nexperimentation, we demonstrate the interpretability of our decomposition\napproach in a Gridworld environment with LLM-assisted agents and a sepsis\nmanagement simulator."

However,\nboth the pre-training and SFT stages fail to explicitly model the comparative\nrelationships of a user's preferences on different items. To construct a\n\"helpful and harmless\" LLM-based recommender, we propose a general framework --\nRecommendation with smoothing personalized Preference Optimization (RosePO),\nwhich better aligns with customized human values during the post-training\nstage. Specifically, in addition to the input and chosen response that\nnaturally align with SFT data, we design a rejected sampling strategy tailored\nfor enhancing helpfulness, along with two strategies aimed at mitigating biases\nto promote harmlessness. To ensure robustness against uncertain labels present\nin automatically constructed preference data, we introduce a personalized\nsmoothing factor predicted by a preference oracle into the optimization\nobjective. Evaluation on three real-world datasets demonstrates the\neffectiveness of our method, showcasing not only improved recommendation\nperformance but also mitigation of semantic hallucination and popularity bias.",

                    "value": "Recently, there has been a growing interest in leveraging Large Language\nModels (LLMs) for recommendation systems, which usually adapt a pre-trained LLM\nto the recommendation scenario through supervised fine-tuning (SFT). However,\nboth the pre-training and SFT stages fail to explicitly model the comparative\nrelationships of a user's preferences on different items. To construct a\n\"helpful and harmless\" LLM-based recommender, we propose a general framework --\nRecommendation with smoothing personalized Preference Optimization (RosePO),\nwhich better aligns with customized human values during the post-training\nstage. Specifically, in addition to the input and chosen response that\nnaturally align with SFT data, we design a rejected sampling strategy tailored\nfor enhancing helpfulness, along with two strategies aimed at mitigating biases\nto promote harmlessness. To ensure robustness against uncertain labels present\nin automatically constructed preference data, we introduce a personalized\nsmoothing factor predicted by a preference oracle into the optimization\nobjective. Evaluation on three real-world datasets demonstrates the\neffectiveness of our method, showcasing not only improved recommendation\nperformance but also mitigation of semantic hallucination and popularity bias."

We evaluate the\neffectiveness and potential of these workflows in automating and enhancing the\ndataset generation process. PO dataset generation requires two modules: (1)\nresponse evaluation, and (2) response generation. In the response evaluation\nmodule, the responses from Large Language Models (LLMs) are evaluated and\nranked - a task typically carried out by human annotators that we automate\nusing LLMs. We assess the response evaluation module in a 2 step process. In\nstep 1, we assess LLMs as evaluators using three distinct prompting strategies.\nIn step 2, we apply the winning prompting strategy to compare the performance\nof LLM-as-a-Judge, LLMs-as-a-Jury, and LLM Debate. Our evaluation shows that\nGPT-4o-as-a-Judge is more consistent across all datasets. For the response\ngeneration module, we use the identified LLM evaluator configuration and\ncompare different configurations of the LLM Feedback Loop. We use the win rate\nto determine the best multi-agent configuration for generation. Experimenting\nwith various configurations, we find that the LLM Feedback Loop, with Llama as\nthe generator and Gemma as the reviewer, achieves a notable 71.8% and 73.8% win\nrate over single-agent Llama and Gemma, respectively. After identifying the\nbest configurations for both modules, we generate our PO datasets using the\nabove pipeline.",

This demands the possession of capability\nof LLMs. However, no prior work has made a clear evaluation of the inferential\nrule-following capability of LLMs. Previous studies that try to evaluate the\ninferential rule-following capability of LLMs fail to distinguish the\ninferential rule-following scenarios from the instruction-following scenarios.\nTherefore, this paper first clarifies the concept of inferential rule-following\nand proposes a comprehensive benchmark, RuleBench, to evaluate a diversified\nrange of inferential rule-following abilities. Our experimental results on a\nvariety of LLMs show that they are still limited in following rules. Our\nanalysis based on the evaluation results provides insights into the\nimprovements for LLMs toward a better inferential rule-following intelligent\nagent. We further propose Inferential Rule-Following Tuning (IRFT). The\nexperimental results show that through IRFT, LLMs can learn abstract\nrule-following abilities from purely synthetic data and then generalize to\nRuleBench.

This demands the possession of capability\nof LLMs. However, no prior work has made a clear evaluation of the inferential\nrule-following capability of LLMs. Previous studies that try to evaluate the\ninferential rule-following capability of LLMs fail to distinguish the\ninferential rule-following scenarios from the instruction-following scenarios.\nTherefore, this paper first clarifies the concept of inferential rule-following\nand proposes a comprehensive benchmark, RuleBench, to evaluate a diversified\nrange of inferential rule-following abilities. Our experimental results on a\nvariety of LLMs show that they are still limited in following rules. Our\nanalysis based on the evaluation results provides insights into the\nimprovements for LLMs toward a better inferential rule-following intelligent\nagent. We further propose Inferential Rule-Following Tuning (IRFT). The\nexperimental results show that through IRFT, LLMs can learn abstract\nrule-following abilities from purely synthetic data and then generalize to\nRuleBench.

                "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in natural\nlanguage processing but exhibit significant performance gaps among different\nlanguages. Most existing approaches to address these disparities rely on\npretraining or fine-tuning, which are resource-intensive. To overcome these\nlimitations without incurring significant costs, we propose Inference-Time\nCross-Lingual Intervention (INCLINE), a novel framework that enhances LLM\nperformance on low-performing (source) languages by aligning their internal\nrepresentations with those of high-performing (target) languages during\ninference. INCLINE initially learns alignment matrices using parallel sentences\nfrom source and target languages through a Least-Squares optimization, and then\napplies these matrices during inference to transform the low-performing\nlanguage representations toward the high-performing language space.

                    "value": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in natural\nlanguage processing but exhibit significant performance gaps among different\nlanguages. Most existing approaches to address these disparities rely on\npretraining or fine-tuning, which are resource-intensive. To overcome these\nlimitations without incurring significant costs, we propose Inference-Time\nCross-Lingual Intervention (INCLINE), a novel framework that enhances LLM\nperformance on low-performing (source) languages by aligning their internal\nrepresentations with those of high-performing (target) languages during\ninference. INCLINE initially learns alignment matrices using parallel sentences\nfrom source and target languages through a Least-Squares optimization, and then\napplies these matrices during inference to transform the low-performing\nlanguage representations toward the high-performing language space.

Current benchmark-based evaluation\nmethods exhibit rigid, aimless interactions and rely on pre-collected static\ndatasets that are costly to build, inflexible across domains, and misaligned\nwith practical user needs. To address this issue, we revisit the evaluation\ncomponents and introduce two concepts: Benchmark+, which extends traditional\nquestion-answer benchmark into a more flexible \"strategy-criterion\" format; and\nAssessment+, which enhances the interaction process, enabling deeper\nexploration and supporting both quantitative metrics and qualitative insights.\nThese concepts capture the nuanced behaviors of LLMs through richer, multi-turn\ninteractions. We propose an agent-based evaluation framework called TestAgent,\nwhich implements these concepts through retrieval augmented generation and\nreinforcement learning. Experiments on tasks ranging from constructing vertical\ndomain evaluation to activating existing benchmarks demonstrate the\neffectiveness of TestAgent across various scenarios.

                    "value": "While various vertical domain large language models (LLMs) have been\ndeveloped, the challenge of automatically evaluating their performance across\ndifferent domains remains significant. Current benchmark-based evaluation\nmethods exhibit rigid, aimless interactions and rely on pre-collected static\ndatasets that are costly to build, inflexible across domains, and misaligned\nwith practical user needs. To address this issue, we revisit the evaluation\ncomponents and introduce two concepts: Benchmark+, which extends traditional\nquestion-answer benchmark into a more flexible \"strategy-criterion\" format; and\nAssessment+, which enhances the interaction process, enabling deeper\nexploration and supporting both quantitative metrics and qualitative insights.\nThese concepts capture the nuanced behaviors of LLMs through richer, multi-turn\ninteractions. We propose an agent-based evaluation framework called TestAgent,\nwhich implements these concepts through retrieval augmented generation and\nreinforcement learning. Experiments on tasks ranging from constructing vertical\ndomain evaluation to activating existing benchmarks demonstrate the\neffectiveness of TestAgent across various scenarios. We believe this work\noffers an interesting perspective on automatic evaluation for LLMs."

To address this, we propose a novel evaluation\nframework to objectively evaluate LLM-based judges.

JudgeBench\nleverages a novel pipeline for converting existing difficult datasets into\nchallenging response pairs with preference labels reflecting objective\ncorrectness. Our comprehensive evaluation on a collection of prompted judges,\nfine-tuned judges, multi-agent judges, and reward models shows that JudgeBench\nposes a significantly greater challenge than previous benchmarks, with many\nstrong models (e.g., GPT-4o) performing just slightly better than random\nguessing.

Each node in the DAG represents the operator in the DNNs, while the\nedge represents the data dependency between operators. Based on this design, 1)\nusers are allowed to customize any DNN without caring low-level operator\nimplementation; 2) we enable the task scheduling with the more fine-grained\nsub-tasks, offering more optimization space; 3) a DAG runtime executor can\nimplement RAD withour requiring the consistent low-level ML framework versions.\n  To enhance system efficiency, we implement a workload estimator and design an\nOP-Fence scheduler to cluster devices with similar bandwidths together and\npartition the DAG to increase throughput. Additionally, we propose an AdaTopK\ncompressor to adaptively compress intermediate activations and gradients at the\nslowest communication links. To evaluate the convergence and efficiency of our\nsystem and algorithms, we train ResNet-101 and GPT-2 on three real-world\ntestbeds using 48 GPUs connected with 8 Mbps~10 Gbps networks.

However, existing AT methods suffer from an inherent\ntrade-off between adversarial robustness and clean accuracy, which seriously\nhinders their real-world deployment. While this problem has been widely studied\nwithin the current AT paradigm, existing AT methods still typically experience\na reduction in clean accuracy by over 10% to date, without significant\nimprovements in robustness compared with simple baselines like PGD-AT. This\ninherent trade-off raises a question: whether the current AT paradigm, which\nassumes to learn the corresponding benign and adversarial samples as the same\nclass, inappropriately combines clean and robust objectives that may be\nessentially inconsistent. In this work, we surprisingly reveal that up to 40%\nof CIFAR-10 adversarial samples always fail to satisfy such an assumption\nacross various AT methods and robust models, explicitly indicating the\nimprovement room for the current AT paradigm. Accordingly, to relax the tension\nbetween clean and robust learning derived from this overstrict assumption, we\npropose a new AT paradigm by introducing an additional dummy class for each\noriginal class, aiming to accommodate the hard adversarial samples with shifted\ndistribution after perturbation. The robustness w.r.t. these adversarial\nsamples can be achieved by runtime recovery from the predicted dummy classes to\ntheir corresponding original ones, eliminating the compromise with clean\nlearning. Building on this new paradigm, we propose a novel plug-and-play AT\ntechnology named DUmmy Classes-based Adversarial Training (DUCAT). Extensive\nexperiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet demonstrate that the\nDUCAT concurrently improves clean accuracy and adversarial robustness compared\nwith state-of-the-art benchmarks, effectively breaking the existing inherent\ntrade-off.",

Accordingly, to relax the tension\nbetween clean and robust learning derived from this overstrict assumption, we\npropose a new AT paradigm by introducing an additional dummy class for each\noriginal class, aiming to accommodate the hard adversarial samples with shifted\ndistribution after perturbation. The robustness w.r.t. these adversarial\nsamples can be achieved by runtime recovery from the predicted dummy classes to\ntheir corresponding original ones, eliminating the compromise with clean\nlearning. Building on this new paradigm, we propose a novel plug-and-play AT\ntechnology named DUmmy Classes-based Adversarial Training (DUCAT). Extensive\nexperiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet demonstrate that the\nDUCAT concurrently improves clean accuracy and adversarial robustness compared\nwith state-of-the-art benchmarks, effectively breaking the existing inherent\ntrade-off."

However, the training of these\nmodels is computationally intensive and susceptible to faults, particularly in\nthe attention mechanism, which is a critical component of transformer-based\nLLMs. In this paper, we investigate the impact of faults on LLM training,\nfocusing on INF, NaN, and near-INF values in the computation results with\nsystematic fault injection experiments. We observe the propagation patterns of\nthese errors, which can trigger non-trainable states in the model and disrupt\ntraining, forcing the procedure to load from checkpoints. To mitigate the\nimpact of these faults, we propose ATTNChecker, the first Algorithm-Based Fault\nTolerance (ABFT) technique tailored for the attention mechanism in LLMs.\nATTNChecker is designed based on fault propagation patterns of LLM and\nincorporates performance optimization to adapt to both system reliability and\nmodel vulnerability while providing lightweight protection for fast LLM\ntraining. Evaluations on four LLMs show that ATTNChecker on average incurs on\naverage 7% overhead on training while detecting and correcting all extreme\nerrors. Compared with the state-of-the-art checkpoint/restore approach,\nATTNChecker reduces recovery overhead by up to 49x.",

However, the training of these\nmodels is computationally intensive and susceptible to faults, particularly in\nthe attention mechanism, which is a critical component of transformer-based\nLLMs. In this paper, we investigate the impact of faults on LLM training,\nfocusing on INF, NaN, and near-INF values in the computation results with\nsystematic fault injection experiments. We observe the propagation patterns of\nthese errors, which can trigger non-trainable states in the model and disrupt\ntraining, forcing the procedure to load from checkpoints. To mitigate the\nimpact of these faults, we propose ATTNChecker, the first Algorithm-Based Fault\nTolerance (ABFT) technique tailored for the attention mechanism in LLMs.\nATTNChecker is designed based on fault propagation patterns of LLM and\nincorporates performance optimization to adapt to both system reliability and\nmodel vulnerability while providing lightweight protection for fast LLM\ntraining. Evaluations on four LLMs show that ATTNChecker on average incurs on\naverage 7% overhead on training while detecting and correcting all extreme\nerrors. Compared with the state-of-the-art checkpoint/restore approach,\nATTNChecker reduces recovery overhead by up to 49x."

Traditional alignment methods\nheavily rely on human feedback to fine-tune models. With the emergence of\nsuperhuman models whose outputs may surpass human understanding, evaluating and\naligning these models using human judgments poses significant challenges. To\naddress the challenges, recent works use weak supervisors to elicit knowledge\nfrom much stronger models. However, there are important disanalogies between\nthe empirical setup in the existing works and the genuine goal of alignment. We\nremark that existing works investigate the phenomenon of weak-to-strong\ngeneration in analogous setup (i.e., binary classification), rather than\npractical alignment-relevant tasks (e.g., safety). In this paper, we bridge\nthis gap by extending weak-to-strong generation to the context of practical\nalignment. We empirically demonstrate the widespread phenomenon of\nweak-to-strong generation in three complicated alignment tasks: safety,\ntoxicity, and legal reasoning}. Furthermore, we explore efficient strategies\nfor improving alignment performance to enhance the quality of model outcomes.\nLastly, we summarize and analyze the challenges and potential solutions in\nregard to specific alignment tasks, which we hope to catalyze the research\nprogress on the topic of weak-to-strong generalization.

Traditional alignment methods\nheavily rely on human feedback to fine-tune models. With the emergence of\nsuperhuman models whose outputs may surpass human understanding, evaluating and\naligning these models using human judgments poses significant challenges. To\naddress the challenges, recent works use weak supervisors to elicit knowledge\nfrom much stronger models. However, there are important disanalogies between\nthe empirical setup in the existing works and the genuine goal of alignment. We\nremark that existing works investigate the phenomenon of weak-to-strong\ngeneration in analogous setup (i.e., binary classification), rather than\npractical alignment-relevant tasks (e.g., safety). In this paper, we bridge\nthis gap by extending weak-to-strong generation to the context of practical\nalignment. We empirically demonstrate the widespread phenomenon of\nweak-to-strong generation in three complicated alignment tasks: safety,\ntoxicity, and legal reasoning}. Furthermore, we explore efficient strategies\nfor improving alignment performance to enhance the quality of model outcomes.\nLastly, we summarize and analyze the challenges and potential solutions in\nregard to specific alignment tasks, which we hope to catalyze the research\nprogress on the topic of weak-to-strong generalization.

Yet, these problems are not well studied, nor can\nthey be quickly detected and effectively mitigated. In this paper, we first\npresent a characterization study on a shared production cluster with over\n10,000 GPUs1. We find that fail-slows are caused by various CPU/GPU computation\nand cross-node networking issues, lasting from tens of seconds to nearly ten\nhours, and collectively delaying the average job completion time by 1.34%. The\ncurrent practice is to manually detect these fail-slows and simply treat them\nas fail-stops using a checkpoint-and-restart failover approach, which are\nlabor-intensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we propose FALCON, a\nframework that rapidly identifies fail-slowed GPUs and/or communication links,\nand effectively tackles them with a novel multi-level mitigation mechanism, all\nwithout human intervention. We have applied FALCON to detect human-labeled\nfail-slows in a production cluster with over 99% accuracy. Cluster deployment\nfurther demonstrates that FALCON effectively handles manually injected\nfail-slows, mitigating the training slowdown by 60.1%.",

                    "value": "Fail-slows, or stragglers, are common but largely unheeded problems in\nlarge-scale hybrid-parallel training that spans thousands of GPU servers and\nruns for weeks to months. Yet, these problems are not well studied, nor can\nthey be quickly detected and effectively mitigated. In this paper, we first\npresent a characterization study on a shared production cluster with over\n10,000 GPUs1. We find that fail-slows are caused by various CPU/GPU computation\nand cross-node networking issues, lasting from tens of seconds to nearly ten\nhours, and collectively delaying the average job completion time by 1.34%. The\ncurrent practice is to manually detect these fail-slows and simply treat them\nas fail-stops using a checkpoint-and-restart failover approach, which are\nlabor-intensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we propose FALCON, a\nframework that rapidly identifies fail-slowed GPUs and/or communication links,\nand effectively tackles them with a novel multi-level mitigation mechanism, all\nwithout human intervention. We have applied FALCON to detect human-labeled\nfail-slows in a production cluster with over 99% accuracy. Cluster deployment\nfurther demonstrates that FALCON effectively handles manually injected\nfail-slows, mitigating the training slowdown by 60.1%."

These tasks fail to fully demonstrate LVLMs'\npotential in complex application scenarios. To comprehensively assess the\nperformance of existing LVLMs, we propose a more challenging task called the\nFlow Text with Image Insertion task (FTII). This task requires LVLMs to\nsimultaneously possess outstanding abilities in image comprehension,\ninstruction understanding, and long-text interpretation. Specifically, given\nseveral text paragraphs and a set of candidate images, as the text paragraphs\naccumulate, the LVLMs are required to select the most suitable image from the\ncandidates to insert after the corresponding paragraph. Constructing a\nbenchmark for such a task is highly challenging, particularly in determining\nthe sequence of flowing text and images. To address this challenge, we turn to\nprofessional news reports, which naturally contain a gold standard for\nimage-text sequences. Based on this, we introduce the Flow Text with Image\nInsertion Benchmark (FTII-Bench), which includes 318 high-quality Chinese\nimage-text news articles and 307 high-quality English image-text news articles,\ncovering 10 different news domains. Using these 625 high-quality articles, we\nconstruct problems of two different types with multiple levels of difficulty.\nFurthermore, we establish two different evaluation pipelines based on the CLIP\nmodel and existing LVLMs. We evaluate 9 open-source and 2 closed-source LVLMs\nas well as 2 CLIP-based models. Results indicate that even the most advanced\nmodels (e.g., GPT-4o) face significant challenges when tackling the FTII task.",

                "summary": "In the high-stakes domain of search-and-rescue missions, the deployment of\nUnmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has become increasingly pivotal. These missions\nrequire seamless, real-time communication among diverse roles within response\nteams, particularly between Remote Operators (ROs) and On-Site Operators\n(OSOs). Traditionally, ROs and OSOs have relied on radio communication to\nexchange critical information, such as the geolocation of victims, hazardous\nareas, and points of interest. However, radio communication lacks information\nvisualization, suffers from noise, and requires mental effort to interpret\ninformation, leading to miscommunications and misunderstandings. To address\nthese challenges, this paper presents VizCom-AR, an Augmented Reality system\ndesigned to facilitate visual communication between ROs and OSOs and their\nsituational awareness during UAV-driven search-and-rescue missions. Our\nexperiments, focus group sessions with police officers, and field study showed\nthat VizCom-AR enhances spatial awareness of both ROs and OSOs, facilitate\ngeolocation information exchange, and effectively complement existing\ncommunication tools in UAV-driven emergency response missions. Overall,\nVizCom-AR offers a fundamental framework for designing Augmented Reality\nsystems for large scale UAV-driven rescue missions.",

We evaluate the\neffectiveness and potential of these workflows in automating and enhancing the\ndataset generation process. PO dataset generation requires two modules: (1)\nresponse evaluation, and (2) response generation. In the response evaluation\nmodule, the responses from Large Language Models (LLMs) are evaluated and\nranked - a task typically carried out by human annotators that we automate\nusing LLMs. We assess the response evaluation module in a 2 step process. In\nstep 1, we assess LLMs as evaluators using three distinct prompting strategies.\nIn step 2, we apply the winning prompting strategy to compare the performance\nof LLM-as-a-Judge, LLMs-as-a-Jury, and LLM Debate. Our evaluation shows that\nGPT-4o-as-a-Judge is more consistent across all datasets. For the response\ngeneration module, we use the identified LLM evaluator configuration and\ncompare different configurations of the LLM Feedback Loop. We use the win rate\nto determine the best multi-agent configuration for generation. Experimenting\nwith various configurations, we find that the LLM Feedback Loop, with Llama as\nthe generator and Gemma as the reviewer, achieves a notable 71.8% and 73.8% win\nrate over single-agent Llama and Gemma, respectively.

Enhancing their core training in language\nmodeling can improve numerous downstream applications. A successful approach to\nenhance language modeling uses a separate planning module to predict abstract\nlabels of future sentences and conditions the LM on these predictions. However,\nthis method is non-differentiable, preventing joint end-to-end tuning of the\nplanner with the LM. We propose an effective method to improve this approach by\nenabling joint fine-tuning of the planner and the LM. We show that a naive way\nof approximating the gradient of selecting a label via the straight-through\nestimator is not effective. Instead, we propose to use the predicted label\nprobabilities as mixing weights to condition the LM on a weighted average of\nlabel embeddings in a differentiable manner. This not only enables joint\nfine-tuning of the planner and the LM, but also allows the LM to draw on the\nfull label distribution predicted by the planner, retaining more information.\nOur experimental results show consistent improvements in perplexity.",

In this paper, we present the Knowledge-Compliant Matching\nFramework (KcMF), an LLM-based approach that addresses these issues without the\nneed for domain-specific fine-tuning. KcMF employs a pseudo-code-based task\ndecomposition strategy to adopt task-specific natural language statements that\nguide LLM reasoning and reduce confusion. We also propose two mechanisms,\nDataset as Knowledge (DaK) and Example as Knowledge (EaK), to build domain\nknowledge sets when unstructured domain knowledge is lacking. Additionally, we\nintroduce a result-ensembling strategy to leverage multiple knowledge sources\nand suppress poorly formatted outputs. Comprehensive evaluations on schema and\nentity matching tasks demonstrate that KcMF outperforms previous non-LLM\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) methods by an average F1 score of 22.9% and competes\neffectively with SOTA fine-tuned LLMs. Moreover, KcMF generalizes well across\ndifferent LLMs.",

We further explore factors that influence conformity,\nsuch as training paradigms and input characteristics, finding that\ninstruction-tuned models are less susceptible to conformity, while increasing\nthe naturalness of majority tones amplifies conformity. Finally, we propose two\ninterventions--Devil's Advocate and Question Distillation--to mitigate\nconformity, providing insights into building more robust language models."

We define and examine\ntwo aspects in the evaluation of LLMs in RAG pipelines, namely attribution\nsensitivity and bias with respect to authorship information.

We design an experimental setup\nin which we use counterfactual evaluation to study three LLMs in terms of their\nattribution sensitivity and bias in RAG pipelines. Our results show that adding\nauthorship information to source documents can significantly change the\nattribution quality of LLMs by 3% to 18%. Moreover, we show that LLMs can have\nan attribution bias towards explicit human authorship, which can serve as a\ncompeting hypothesis for findings of prior work that shows that LLM-generated\ncontent may be preferred over human-written contents.

ERVQ mitigates codebook collapse and boosts codec performance\nthrough both intra- and inter-codebook optimization. Intra-codebook\noptimization incorporates an online clustering strategy and a code balancing\nloss to ensure balanced and efficient codebook utilization. Inter-codebook\noptimization improves the diversity of quantized features by minimizing the\nsimilarity between successive quantizations. Our experiments show that ERVQ\nsignificantly enhances audio codec performance across different models,\nsampling rates, and bitrates, achieving superior quality and generalization\ncapabilities. It also achieves 100% codebook utilization on one of the most\nadvanced neural audio codecs. Further experiments indicate that audio codecs\nimproved by the ERVQ strategy can improve unified speech-and-text large\nlanguage models (LLMs).

Their superior language understanding and\nreasoning capabilities allow users to automate complex and repetitive tasks.\nHowever, due to the inherent unreliability and high operational cost of LLMs,\ntheir practical applicability is quite limited. To address these issues, this\npaper introduces MobileGPT, an innovative LLM-based mobile task automator\nequipped with a human-like app memory. MobileGPT emulates the cognitive process\nof humans interacting with a mobile app -- explore, select, derive, and recall.\nThis approach allows for a more precise and efficient learning of a task's\nprocedure by breaking it down into smaller, modular sub-tasks that can be\nre-used, re-arranged, and adapted for various objectives. We implement\nMobileGPT using online LLMs services (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) and evaluate its\nperformance on a dataset of 185 tasks across 18 mobile apps. The results\nindicate that MobileGPT can automate and learn new tasks with 82.7% accuracy,\nand is able to adapt them to different contexts with near perfect (98.75%)\naccuracy while reducing both latency and cost by 62.5% and 68.8%, respectively,\ncompared to the GPT-4 powered baseline.",
