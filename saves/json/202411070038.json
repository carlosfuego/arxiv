                "summary": "With the development of large language models (LLMs), the ability to handle\nlonger contexts has become a key capability for Web applications such as\ncross-document understanding and LLM-powered search systems. However, this\nprogress faces two major challenges: performance degradation due to sequence\nlengths out-of-distribution, and excessively long inference times caused by the\nquadratic computational complexity of attention. These issues hinder the\napplication of LLMs in long-context scenarios. In this paper, we propose\nDynamic Token-Level KV Cache Selection (TokenSelect), a model-agnostic,\ntraining-free method for efficient and accurate long-context inference.\nTokenSelect builds upon the observation of non-contiguous attention sparsity,\nusing Query-Key dot products to measure per-head KV Cache criticality at\ntoken-level. By per-head soft voting mechanism, TokenSelect selectively\ninvolves a small number of critical KV cache tokens in the attention\ncalculation without sacrificing accuracy. To further accelerate TokenSelect, we\ndesigned the Selection Cache based on observations of consecutive Query\nsimilarity and implemented efficient dot product kernel, significantly reducing\nthe overhead of token selection. A comprehensive evaluation of TokenSelect\ndemonstrates up to 23.84x speedup in attention computation and up to 2.28x\nacceleration in end-to-end latency, while providing superior performance\ncompared to state-of-the-art long-context inference methods.",

                    "value": "With the development of large language models (LLMs), the ability to handle\nlonger contexts has become a key capability for Web applications such as\ncross-document understanding and LLM-powered search systems. However, this\nprogress faces two major challenges: performance degradation due to sequence\nlengths out-of-distribution, and excessively long inference times caused by the\nquadratic computational complexity of attention. These issues hinder the\napplication of LLMs in long-context scenarios. In this paper, we propose\nDynamic Token-Level KV Cache Selection (TokenSelect), a model-agnostic,\ntraining-free method for efficient and accurate long-context inference.\nTokenSelect builds upon the observation of non-contiguous attention sparsity,\nusing Query-Key dot products to measure per-head KV Cache criticality at\ntoken-level. By per-head soft voting mechanism, TokenSelect selectively\ninvolves a small number of critical KV cache tokens in the attention\ncalculation without sacrificing accuracy. To further accelerate TokenSelect, we\ndesigned the Selection Cache based on observations of consecutive Query\nsimilarity and implemented efficient dot product kernel, significantly reducing\nthe overhead of token selection. A comprehensive evaluation of TokenSelect\ndemonstrates up to 23.84x speedup in attention computation and up to 2.28x\nacceleration in end-to-end latency, while providing superior performance\ncompared to state-of-the-art long-context inference methods."

In addition, the design of TME-Box allows the efficient\nisolation of up to 32K concurrent sandboxes. We present a performance-optimized\nTME-Box prototype, utilizing x86 segment-based addressing, that showcases\ngeomean performance overheads of 5.2 % for data isolation and 9.7 % for code\nand data isolation, evaluated with the SPEC CPU2017 benchmark suite."

Self-attention requires the key-value (KV)\ncache of all previous sequences to be retrieved from memory at every decoding\nstep to retrieve context information, leading to two primary bottlenecks during\nbatch inference. First, there is a significant delay in obtaining the first\ntoken, as the information of the entire prompt must first be processed to\nprefill the KV cache. Second, computation of subsequent tokens is bottlenecked\nby the high memory I/O demand of fetching the entire KV cache, which grows\nlinearly with sequence length, incurring quadratic memory reads overall. We\ndesign the Block Transformer to strategically mitigate these costs, by\nincorporating coarsity and locality into an integrated global-to-local\narchitecture. At the lower layers, we aggregate tokens into fixed size blocks\nto apply attention across the entire sequence at coarse-grained detail, to\ncapture the global context while minimizing KV cache overhead. At upper layers,\nwe apply attention within each block to decode individual tokens, to model\nfine-grained details with a lightweight local KV cache. We pretrain vanilla and\nBlock Transformers from scratch and demonstrate that Block Transformers reach\n10--20x inference throughput compared to vanilla transformers with equivalent\nperplexity and zero-shot task performance.

Under the hood, language models support\nthis by running an autoregressive inference pass to provide a draft.\nConsequently, providing $k$ drafts to the user requires running an expensive\nlanguage model $k$ times. To alleviate the computation cost of running $k$\ninference passes, we propose Superposed Decoding, a new decoding algorithm that\ngenerates $k$ drafts at the computation cost of one autoregressive inference\npass. We achieve this by feeding a superposition of the most recent token\nembeddings from the $k$ drafts as input to the next decoding step of the\nlanguage model.

Under the hood, language models support\nthis by running an autoregressive inference pass to provide a draft.\nConsequently, providing $k$ drafts to the user requires running an expensive\nlanguage model $k$ times. To alleviate the computation cost of running $k$\ninference passes, we propose Superposed Decoding, a new decoding algorithm that\ngenerates $k$ drafts at the computation cost of one autoregressive inference\npass. We achieve this by feeding a superposition of the most recent token\nembeddings from the $k$ drafts as input to the next decoding step of the\nlanguage model.

A key challenge in accelerating VLMs is storing and\naccessing the large Key-Value (KV) cache that encodes long visual contexts,\nsuch as images or videos. While existing KV cache compression methods are\neffective for Large Language Models (LLMs), directly migrating them to VLMs\nyields suboptimal accuracy and speedup. To bridge the gap, we propose VL-Cache,\na novel KV cache compression recipe tailored for accelerating VLM inference. In\nthis paper, we first investigate the unique sparsity pattern of VLM attention\nby distinguishing visual and text tokens in prefill and decoding phases. Based\non these observations, we introduce a layer-adaptive sparsity-aware cache\nbudget allocation method that effectively distributes the limited cache budget\nacross different layers, further reducing KV cache size without compromising\naccuracy. Additionally, we develop a modality-aware token scoring policy to\nbetter evaluate the token importance. Empirical results on multiple benchmark\ndatasets demonstrate that retaining only 10% of KV cache achieves accuracy\ncomparable to that with full cache.

                    "value": "Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across\na versatile set of tasks. A key challenge in accelerating VLMs is storing and\naccessing the large Key-Value (KV) cache that encodes long visual contexts,\nsuch as images or videos. While existing KV cache compression methods are\neffective for Large Language Models (LLMs), directly migrating them to VLMs\nyields suboptimal accuracy and speedup. To bridge the gap, we propose VL-Cache,\na novel KV cache compression recipe tailored for accelerating VLM inference. In\nthis paper, we first investigate the unique sparsity pattern of VLM attention\nby distinguishing visual and text tokens in prefill and decoding phases. Based\non these observations, we introduce a layer-adaptive sparsity-aware cache\nbudget allocation method that effectively distributes the limited cache budget\nacross different layers, further reducing KV cache size without compromising\naccuracy. Additionally, we develop a modality-aware token scoring policy to\nbetter evaluate the token importance. Empirical results on multiple benchmark\ndatasets demonstrate that retaining only 10% of KV cache achieves accuracy\ncomparable to that with full cache. In a speed benchmark, our method\naccelerates end-to-end latency of generating 100 tokens by up to 2.33x and\nspeeds up decoding by up to 7.08x, while reducing the memory footprint of KV\ncache in GPU by 90%."

To overcome\nthis issue, we introduce \\textit{adaptive negative proxies}, which are\ndynamically generated during testing by exploring actual OOD images, to align\nmore closely with the underlying OOD label space and enhance the efficacy of\nnegative proxy guidance.

Quantization\nis a promising approach for compressing KV cache activations; however, existing\nsolutions fail to represent activations accurately in sub-4-bit precision. Our\nwork, KVQuant, facilitates low precision KV cache quantization by incorporating\nseveral novel methods: (i) Per-Channel Key Quantization, where we adjust the\ndimension along which we quantize the Key activations to better match the\ndistribution; (ii) Pre-RoPE Key Quantization, where we quantize Key activations\nbefore the rotary positional embedding to mitigate its impact on quantization;\n(iii) Non-Uniform KV Cache Quantization, where we derive per-layer\nsensitivity-weighted non-uniform datatypes that better represent the\ndistributions; and (iv) Per-Vector Dense-and-Sparse Quantization, where we\nisolate outliers separately for each vector to minimize skews in quantization\nranges. By applying our method to the LLaMA, Llama-2, Llama-3, and Mistral\nmodels, we achieve < 0.1 perplexity degradation with 3-bit quantization on both\nWikitext-2 and C4, outperforming existing approaches. Our method enables\nserving LLaMA-7B with a context length of up to 1 million on a single A100-80GB\nGPU and up to 10 million on an 8-GPU system. We develop custom CUDA kernels for\nKVQuant, showing that we can achieve up to ~1.7x speedups, compared to baseline\nfp16 matrix-vector multiplications, for the LLaMA-7B model.",

Existing works mainly describe the\ndeployment of DNT technologies in various service sections.The full life cycle\nof DNTs for telecommunication has not yet been comprehensively studied,\nparticularly in the aspects of fine-grained creation, real-time adaptation,\nresource-efficient deployment, and security protection. This article presents\nan in-depth overview of DNTs, exploring their concrete integration into\nnetworks and communication, covering the fundamental designs, the emergent\napplications, and critical challenges in multiple dimensions. We also include\ntwo detailed case studies to illustrate how DNTs can be applied in real-world\nscenarios such as wireless traffic forecasting and edge caching. Additionally,\na forward-looking vision of the research opportunities in tackling the\nchallenges of DNTs is provided, aiming to fully maximize the benefits of DNTs\nin nextG networks."

                "summary": "The KV-Cache technique has become the standard for the inference of large\nlanguage models (LLMs). It caches states of self-attention to avoid\nrecomputation. Yet, it is widely criticized that KV-Cache can become a\nbottleneck of the LLM inference system, especially when confronted with\nultra-large models and long-context queries. A natural remedy is to discard the\nKV-Cache for less important tokens, with StreamingLLM as an example, but the\nused static eviction strategies cannot flexibly adapt to varying contexts.\nRemedies like H2O leverage accumulative attention scores to perform dynamic\neviction but suffer from the attention bias issue in capturing contextual\ninformation. This paper bridges this gap by devising a parameterized KV-Cache\neviction mechanism, dubbed as Attention-Gate, which accepts the whole context\nas input and yields eviction flags for each token to realize in-context\neviction. The subsequent self-attention module proceeds according to the flags\nand only the KV states for the remaining tokens need to be cached. The\nAttention-Gates can vary among different heads and layers and be trivially\nplugged into pre-trained LLMs, tuned by cost-effective continual pre-training\nor supervised fine-tuning objectives to acquire what to discard. The\ncomputational and memory overhead introduced by Attention-Gates is minimal. Our\nmethod is validated across multiple tasks, demonstrating both efficiency and\nadaptability. After a highly efficient continual pre-training, it achieves\nhigher average accuracy and evicts more tokens compared to traditional\ntraining-free methods. In supervised fine-tuning, it not only evicts many\ntokens but also outperforms LoRA-finetuned LLMs on some datasets, such as RTE,\nwhere it improves accuracy by 13.9% while evicting 62.8% of tokens, showing\nthat effective eviction of redundant tokens can even enhance performance.",

However, the large memory overhead of the key-value (KV) cache poses\nsignificant challenges in long-context scenarios. Existing training-free KV\ncache compression methods typically focus on quantization and token pruning,\nwhich have compression limits, and excessive sparsity can lead to severe\nperformance degradation. Other methods design new architectures with less KV\noverhead but require significant training overhead. To address the above two\ndrawbacks, we further explore the redundancy in the channel dimension and apply\nan architecture-level design with minor training costs. Therefore, we introduce\nCSKV, a training-efficient Channel Shrinking technique for KV cache\ncompression: (1) We first analyze the singular value distribution of the KV\ncache, revealing significant redundancy and compression potential along the\nchannel dimension. Based on this observation, we propose using low-rank\ndecomposition for key and value layers and storing the low-dimension features.\n(2) To preserve model performance, we introduce a bi-branch KV cache, including\na window-based full-precision KV cache and a low-precision compressed KV cache.\n(3) To reduce the training costs, we minimize the layer-wise reconstruction\nloss for the compressed KV cache instead of retraining the entire LLMs.\nExtensive experiments show that CSKV can reduce the memory overhead of the KV\ncache by 80% while maintaining the model's long-context capability. Moreover,\nwe show that our method can be seamlessly combined with quantization to further\nreduce the memory overhead, achieving a compression ratio of up to 95%.

However,\nuneven distribution of cache requests from the cores, especially when requests\nfrom multiple cores are concentrated on a single bank, can result in\nsignificant contention affecting all cores that access the cache. Such cache\nbank contention can even be maliciously induced -- known as cache bank-aware\ndenial-of-service (DoS) attacks -- in order to jeopardize the system's timing\npredictability.\n  In this paper, we propose a per-bank bandwidth regulation approach for\nmulti-banked shared LLC based multicore real-time systems. By regulating\nbandwidth on a per-bank basis, the approach aims to prevent unnecessary\nthrottling of cache accesses to non-contended banks, thus improving overall\nperformance (throughput) without compromising isolation benefits of throttling.\nWe implement our approach on a RISC-V system-on-chip (SoC) platform using\nFireSim and evaluate extensively using both synthetic and real-world workloads.\nOur evaluation results show that the proposed per-bank regulation approach\neffectively protects real-time tasks from co-running cache bank-aware DoS\nattacks, and offers up to a 3.66$\\times$ performance improvement for the\nthrottled benign best-effort tasks compared to prior bank-oblivious bandwidth\nthrottling approaches.",

Such cache\nbank contention can even be maliciously induced -- known as cache bank-aware\ndenial-of-service (DoS) attacks -- in order to jeopardize the system's timing\npredictability.\n  In this paper, we propose a per-bank bandwidth regulation approach for\nmulti-banked shared LLC based multicore real-time systems. By regulating\nbandwidth on a per-bank basis, the approach aims to prevent unnecessary\nthrottling of cache accesses to non-contended banks, thus improving overall\nperformance (throughput) without compromising isolation benefits of throttling.\nWe implement our approach on a RISC-V system-on-chip (SoC) platform using\nFireSim and evaluate extensively using both synthetic and real-world workloads.\nOur evaluation results show that the proposed per-bank regulation approach\neffectively protects real-time tasks from co-running cache bank-aware DoS\nattacks, and offers up to a 3.66$\\times$ performance improvement for the\nthrottled benign best-effort tasks compared to prior bank-oblivious bandwidth\nthrottling approaches."

Digital forensic\ninvestigators must understand how different browsers function and the critical\nareas to consider during web forensic analysis. Web forensics, a subfield of\ndigital forensics, involves collecting and analyzing browser artifacts, such as\nbrowser history, search keywords, and downloads, which serve as potential\nevidence. While existing research has provided valuable insights, many studies\nfocus on individual browsing modes or limited forensic scenarios, leaving gaps\nin understanding the full scope of data retention and recovery across different\nmodes and browsers. This paper addresses these gaps by defining four browsing\nscenarios and critically analyzing browser artifacts across normal, private,\nand portable modes using various forensic tools. We define four browsing\nscenarios to perform a comprehensive evaluation of popular browsers -- Google\nChrome, Mozilla Firefox, Brave, Tor, and Microsoft Edge -- by monitoring\nchanges in key data storage areas such as cache files, cookies, browsing\nhistory, and local storage across different browsing modes. Overall, this paper\ncontributes to a deeper understanding of browser forensic analysis and\nidentifies key areas for enhancing privacy protection and forensic\nmethodologies.",

                    "value": "As the use of web browsers continues to grow, the potential for cybercrime\nand web-related criminal activities also increases. Digital forensic\ninvestigators must understand how different browsers function and the critical\nareas to consider during web forensic analysis. Web forensics, a subfield of\ndigital forensics, involves collecting and analyzing browser artifacts, such as\nbrowser history, search keywords, and downloads, which serve as potential\nevidence. While existing research has provided valuable insights, many studies\nfocus on individual browsing modes or limited forensic scenarios, leaving gaps\nin understanding the full scope of data retention and recovery across different\nmodes and browsers. This paper addresses these gaps by defining four browsing\nscenarios and critically analyzing browser artifacts across normal, private,\nand portable modes using various forensic tools. We define four browsing\nscenarios to perform a comprehensive evaluation of popular browsers -- Google\nChrome, Mozilla Firefox, Brave, Tor, and Microsoft Edge -- by monitoring\nchanges in key data storage areas such as cache files, cookies, browsing\nhistory, and local storage across different browsing modes. Overall, this paper\ncontributes to a deeper understanding of browser forensic analysis and\nidentifies key areas for enhancing privacy protection and forensic\nmethodologies."

Through controlled\nexperiments with 600 participants from India and the US, who reviewed and wrote\nconstructive comments on online threads on Islamophobia and homophobia, we\nfound potential misalignment in how LLMs and humans perceive constructiveness\nin online comments. While the LLM was more likely to view dialectical comments\nas more constructive, participants favored comments that emphasized logic and\nfacts more than the LLM did. Despite these differences, participants rated\nLLM-generated and human-AI co-written comments as significantly more\nconstructive than those written independently by humans. Our analysis also\nrevealed that LLM-generated and human-AI co-written comments exhibited more\nlinguistic features associated with constructiveness compared to human-written\ncomments on divisive topics. When participants used LLMs to refine their\ncomments, the resulting comments were longer, more polite, positive, less\ntoxic, and more readable, with added argumentative features that retained the\noriginal intent but occasionally lost nuances. Based on these findings, we\ndiscuss ethical and design considerations in using LLMs to facilitate\nconstructive discourse online.",

In large language\nmodels (LLMs), a prevalent strategy to reduce hallucinations is to retrieve\nfactual knowledge from an external database. While such retrieval augmentation\nstrategies have great potential to enhance text-to-vision generators, existing\nstatic top-K retrieval methods explore the knowledge pool once, missing the\nbroader context necessary for high-quality generation. Furthermore, LLMs\ninternally possess rich world knowledge learned during large-scale training\n(parametric knowledge) that could mitigate the need for external data\nretrieval. This paper proposes Contextual Knowledge Pursuit (CKPT), a framework\nthat leverages the complementary strengths of external and parametric knowledge\nto help generators produce reliable visual content. Instead of the one-time\nretrieval of facts from an external database to improve a given prompt, CKPT\nuses (1) an LLM to decide whether to seek external knowledge or to self-elicit\ndescriptions from LLM parametric knowledge, (2) a knowledge pursuit process to\ncontextually seek and sequentially gather most relevant facts, (3) a knowledge\naggregator for prompt enhancement with the gathered fact context, and (4) a\nfiltered fine-tuning objective to improve visual synthesis with richer prompts.\nWe evaluate CKPT across multiple text-driven generative tasks (image, 3D\nrendering, and video) on datasets of rare objects and daily scenarios.

While the prevalent use of MIDI in music modeling is\nwell-established, our findings suggest that LLMs are inherently more compatible\nwith ABC Notation, which aligns more closely with their design and strengths,\nthereby enhancing the model's performance in musical composition. To address\nthe challenges associated with misaligned measures from different tracks during\ngeneration, we propose the development of a Synchronized Multi-Track ABC\nNotation (SMT-ABC Notation), which aims to preserve coherence across multiple\nmusical tracks. Our contributions include a series of models capable of\nhandling up to 8192 tokens, covering 90% of the symbolic music data in our\ntraining set.

                    "value": "In this paper, we explore the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to\nthe pre-training of music. While the prevalent use of MIDI in music modeling is\nwell-established, our findings suggest that LLMs are inherently more compatible\nwith ABC Notation, which aligns more closely with their design and strengths,\nthereby enhancing the model's performance in musical composition. To address\nthe challenges associated with misaligned measures from different tracks during\ngeneration, we propose the development of a Synchronized Multi-Track ABC\nNotation (SMT-ABC Notation), which aims to preserve coherence across multiple\nmusical tracks. Our contributions include a series of models capable of\nhandling up to 8192 tokens, covering 90% of the symbolic music data in our\ntraining set. Furthermore, we explore the implications of the Symbolic Music\nScaling Law (SMS Law) on model performance. The results indicate a promising\ndirection for future research in music generation, offering extensive resources\nfor community-led research through our open-source contributions."

In extensive experiments\nacross all three settings, we find that a diverse collection of\nstate-of-the-art models exhibit significant drop-offs in performance (e.g., up\nto 36.3% absolute accuracy for OpenAI o1-preview compared to GPT-4o) when using\ninference-time reasoning compared to zero-shot counterparts. We also identify\nthree tasks that satisfy condition (i) but not (ii), and find that while verbal\nthinking reduces human performance in these tasks, CoT retains or increases\nmodel performance. Overall, our results show that while there is not an exact\nparallel between the cognitive processes of models and those of humans,\nconsidering cases where thinking has negative consequences for human\nperformance can help us identify settings where it negatively impacts models.\nBy connecting the literature on human deliberation with evaluations of CoT, we\noffer a new tool that can be used in understanding the impact of prompt choices\nand inference-time reasoning.",

The precise boundaries of different status in the HR diagram\nhave also been difficult to establish.

We also\ntest different published asteroseisemic methods claiming to distinguish AGB and\nRGB stars against a sample where AGB candidates were selected using a\nspectrocopic identification method. We used six different seismic techniques to\ndistinguish RC and RGB stars, and tested two proposed methods for\ndistinguishing AGB and RGB stars.

We present consensus evolutionary status for 18,784\nstars out of the 30,337 red giants present in the Kepler data, including 11,516\nstars with APOGEE spectra available. The agreement between seismic and\nspectroscopic classification is excellent for distinguishing RC stars, agreeing\nat the 94% level. Most disagreements can be traced to uncertainties in\nspectroscopic parameters, but some are caused by blends with background stars.\nWe find a sharp lower boundary in surface gravity at log(g) = 2.99+/-0.01 for\nthe RC and discuss the implications.

To address some of these questions, we present Loreli II, a\ndatabase of nearly 10 000 simulations of the 21 cm signal run with the Licorice\n3D radiative transfer code. With Loreli II, we explore a 5-dimensional\nastrophysical parameter space where star formation, X-ray emissions, and UV\nemissions are varied. We then use this database to train neural networks and\nperform Bayesian inference on 21 cm power spectra affected by thermal noise at\nthe level of 100 hours of observation with the Square Kilometer Array. We study\nand compare three inference techniques : an emulator of the power spectrum, a\nNeural Density Estimator that fits the implicit likelihood of the model, and a\nBayesian Neural Network that directly fits the posterior distribution. We\nmeasure the performances of each method by comparing them on a statistically\nrepresentative set of inferences, notably using the principles of\nSimulation-Based Calibration. We report errors on the 1-D marginalized\nposteriors (biases and over/under confidence) below $15 \\%$ of the standard\ndeviation for the emulator and below $25 \\%$ for the other methods. We conclude\nthat at our noise level and our sampling density of the parameter space, an\nexplicit Gaussian likelihood is sufficient. This may not be the case at lower\nnoise level or if a denser sampling is used to reach higher accuracy. We then\napply the emulator method to recent HERA upper limits and report weak\nconstraints on the X-ray emissivity parameter of our model.",

Clear\nZeeman signatures from magnetic fields at the surface of PDS 70 are detected in\nour data set of 40 circularly polarized spectra. Longitudinal fields inferred\nfrom Zeeman signatures, ranging from -116 to 176 G, are modulated on a\ntimescale of 3.008$\\pm$0.006 d, confirming that this is the rotation period of\nPDS 70. Applying Zeeman-Doppler imaging to subsets of unpolarized and\ncircularly polarised line profiles, we show that PDS 70 hosts low-contrast\nbrightness spots and a large-scale magnetic field in its photosphere, featuring\nin particular a dipole component of strength 200-420 G that evolves on a\ntimescale of months. From the broadening of spectral lines, we also infer that\nPDS 70 hosts a small-scale field of 2.51$\\pm$0.12 kG. Radial velocities derived\nfrom unpolarized line profiles are rotationally modulated as well, and exhibit\nadditional longer-term chromatic variability, most likely attributable to\nmagnetic activity rather than to a close-in giant planet (with a 3sigma upper\nlimit on its minimum mass of ~4 Mjup at a distance of ~0.2 au). We finally\nconfirm that accretion occurs at the surface of PDS 70, generating modulated\nred-shifted absorption in the 1083.3-nm He i triplet, and show that the\nlarge-scale magnetic field, often strong enough to disrupt the inner accretion\ndisc up to the corotation radius, weakens as the star gets fainter and redder\n(as in 2022), suggesting that dust from the disc more easily penetrates the\nstellar magnetosphere in such phases.",

This work mainly explores the utility of\ndeep video prior in estimating the visual quality of the video. In our work, we\nhave used a single distorted video and a reference video pair to learn the deep\nvideo prior. At inference time, the learned deep prior is used to restore the\noriginal videos from the distorted videos. The ability of learned deep video\nprior to restore the original video from the distorted video is measured to\nquantify distortion in the video. Our hypothesis is that the learned deep video\nprior fails in restoring the highly distorted videos. The restoring ability of\ndeep video prior is proportional to the distortion present in the video.\nTherefore, we propose to use the distance between the distorted video and the\nrestored video as the perceptual quality of the video. Our algorithm is trained\nusing a single video pair and it does not need any labelled data. We show that\nour proposed algorithm outperforms the existing unsupervised video quality\nassessment algorithms in terms of LCC and SROCC on a synthetically distorted\nvideo quality assessment dataset.",

In our work, we\nhave used a single distorted video and a reference video pair to learn the deep\nvideo prior. At inference time, the learned deep prior is used to restore the\noriginal videos from the distorted videos. The ability of learned deep video\nprior to restore the original video from the distorted video is measured to\nquantify distortion in the video. Our hypothesis is that the learned deep video\nprior fails in restoring the highly distorted videos. The restoring ability of\ndeep video prior is proportional to the distortion present in the video.\nTherefore, we propose to use the distance between the distorted video and the\nrestored video as the perceptual quality of the video. Our algorithm is trained\nusing a single video pair and it does not need any labelled data. We show that\nour proposed algorithm outperforms the existing unsupervised video quality\nassessment algorithms in terms of LCC and SROCC on a synthetically distorted\nvideo quality assessment dataset."

(3) The repetitive suppression problem causes LLMs to get\nstuck into the repetition loop of self-repair or re-generation attempts. In\nthis paper, we propose TestART, a novel unit test generation method that\nleverages the strengths of LLMs while overcoming the limitations mentioned.\nTestART improves LLM-based unit test via co-evolution of automated generation\nand repair iteration. TestART leverages the template-based repair technique to\nfix bugs in LLM-generated test cases, using prompt injection to guide the\nnext-step automated generation and avoid repetition suppression.

This\nsynergy between generation and repair elevates the quality, effectiveness, and\nreadability of the produced test cases significantly beyond previous methods.\nIn comparative experiments, the pass rate of TestART-generated test cases is\n78.55%, which is approximately 18% higher than both the ChatGPT-4.0 model and\nthe same ChatGPT-3.5-based method ChatUniTest.

Based on this input, we will use machine learning\nto infer conventional PROM scores, which can be used by clinicians to evaluate\nthe treatment status. The goal of the application is to improve adherence to\nthe healthcare system and treatments, and thus ultimately reduce cases of\nsubsequent vision impairment. The approach needs to be further validated using\na survey and a clinical study."

Camera images, which are generally recorded alongside\nLiDAR pointclouds, can be processed by the widely available 2D foundation\nmodels, which are generic and dataset-agnostic. However, distilling knowledge\nfrom 2D data to improve LiDAR perception raises domain adaptation challenges.\nFor example, the classical perspective projection suffers from the parallax\neffect produced by the position shift between both sensors at their respective\ncapture times. We propose a Semi-Supervised Learning setup to leverage\nunlabeled LiDAR pointclouds alongside distilled knowledge from the camera\nimages. To self-supervise our model on the unlabeled scans, we add an auxiliary\nNeRF head and cast rays from the camera viewpoint over the unlabeled voxel\nfeatures. The NeRF head predicts densities and semantic logits at each sampled\nray location which are used for rendering pixel semantics. Concurrently, we\nquery the Segment-Anything (SAM) foundation model with the camera image to\ngenerate a set of unlabeled generic masks. We fuse the masks with the rendered\npixel semantics from LiDAR to produce pseudo-labels that supervise the pixel\npredictions. During inference, we drop the NeRF head and run our model with\nonly LiDAR.

However, the challenge of developing a unified model for both\nshort and long video understanding remains unresolved. Most existing video LLMs\ncannot handle hour-long videos, while methods custom for long videos tend to be\nineffective for shorter videos and images. In this paper, we identify the key\nissue as the redundant content in videos. To address this, we propose a novel\npooling strategy that simultaneously achieves token compression and\ninstruction-aware visual feature aggregation. Our model is termed Prompt-guided\nPooling LLaVA, or PPLLaVA for short. Specifically, PPLLaVA consists of three\ncore components: the CLIP-based visual-prompt alignment that extracts visual\ninformation relevant to the user's instructions, the prompt-guided pooling that\ncompresses the visual sequence to arbitrary scales using convolution-style\npooling, and the clip context extension designed for lengthy prompt common in\nvisual dialogue. Moreover, our codebase also integrates the most advanced video\nDirect Preference Optimization (DPO) and visual interleave training. Extensive\nexperiments have validated the performance of our model. With superior\nthroughput and only 1024 visual context, PPLLaVA achieves better results on\nimage benchmarks as a video LLM, while achieving state-of-the-art performance\nacross various video benchmarks, excelling in tasks ranging from caption\ngeneration to multiple-choice questions, and handling video lengths from\nseconds to hours.

This provides strong motivation for the use of\njackknife in high-dimensional problems where the dimension is moderate relative\nto sample size. We illustrate consequences of our general theory for various\nspecific $Z$-estimators, including non-linear functionals in linear models;\ngeneralized linear models; and the inverse propensity score weighting (IPW)\nestimate for the average treatment effect, among others."

We compared multiple generations of LLMs\n(from GPT-3 to GPT-4o) against human color-word associations using data\ncollected from over 10,000 Japanese participants, involving 17 colors and words\nfrom eight categories in Japanese. Our findings reveal a clear progression in\nLLM performance across generations, with GPT-4o achieving the highest accuracy\nin predicting the best voted word for each color and category. However, the\nhighest median performance was approximately 50% even for GPT-4o with visual\ninputs (chance level is 10%), and the performance levels varied significantly\nacross word categories and colors, indicating a failure to fully replicate\nhuman color-word associations. On the other hand, color discrimination ability\nestimated from our color-word association data showed that LLMs demonstrated\nhigh correlation with human color discrimination patterns, similarly to\nprevious studies.

                "summary": "With the development of large language models (LLMs), the ability to handle\nlonger contexts has become a key capability for Web applications such as\ncross-document understanding and LLM-powered search systems. However, this\nprogress faces two major challenges: performance degradation due to sequence\nlengths out-of-distribution, and excessively long inference times caused by the\nquadratic computational complexity of attention. These issues hinder the\napplication of LLMs in long-context scenarios. In this paper, we propose\nDynamic Token-Level KV Cache Selection (TokenSelect), a model-agnostic,\ntraining-free method for efficient and accurate long-context inference.\nTokenSelect builds upon the observation of non-contiguous attention sparsity,\nusing Query-Key dot products to measure per-head KV Cache criticality at\ntoken-level. By per-head soft voting mechanism, TokenSelect selectively\ninvolves a small number of critical KV cache tokens in the attention\ncalculation without sacrificing accuracy. To further accelerate TokenSelect, we\ndesigned the Selection Cache based on observations of consecutive Query\nsimilarity and implemented efficient dot product kernel, significantly reducing\nthe overhead of token selection. A comprehensive evaluation of TokenSelect\ndemonstrates up to 23.84x speedup in attention computation and up to 2.28x\nacceleration in end-to-end latency, while providing superior performance\ncompared to state-of-the-art long-context inference methods.",

To address the issues, we propose the first Data Manipulation aided\nReconstruction attack on GFL, dubbed as DMan4Rec. The malicious client is born\nto manipulate its locally collected data to enhance graph stealing privacy from\nbenign ones, so as to construct double whammy on GFL. It differs from previous\nwork in three terms: (1) effectiveness - to fully utilize the sparsity and\nfeature smoothness of the graph, novel penalty terms are designed adaptive to\ndiverse similarity functions for connected and unconnected node pairs, as well\nas incorporation label smoothing on top of the original cross-entropy loss. (2)\nscalability - DMan4Rec is capable of both white-box and black-box attacks via\ntraining a supervised model to infer the posterior probabilities obtained from\nlimited queries (3) stealthiness - by manipulating the malicious client's node\nfeatures, it can maintain the overall graph structure's invariance and conceal\nthe attack. Comprehensive experiments on four real datasets and three GNN\nmodels demonstrate that DMan4Rec achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) attack\nperformance, e.g., the attack AUC and precision improved by 9.2% and 10.5%\nrespectively compared with the SOTA baselines. Particularly, DMan4Rec achieves\nan AUC score and a precision score of up to 99.59% and 99.56%, respectively in\nblack-box setting. Nevertheless, the complete overlap of the distribution\ngraphs supports the stealthiness of the attack. Besides, DMan4Rec still beats\nthe defensive GFL, which alarms a new threat to GFL.",

                "summary": "Converting webpage design into functional UI code is a critical step for\nbuilding websites, which can be labor-intensive and time-consuming. To automate\nthis design-to-code transformation process, various automated methods using\nlearning-based networks and multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have been\nproposed. However, these studies were merely evaluated on a narrow range of\nstatic web pages and ignored dynamic interaction elements, making them less\npractical for real-world website deployment.\n  To fill in the blank, we present the first systematic investigation of MLLMs\nin generating interactive webpages. Specifically, we first formulate the\nInteraction-to-Code task and build the Interaction2Code benchmark that contains\n97 unique web pages and 213 distinct interactions, spanning 15 webpage types\nand 30 interaction categories. We then conduct comprehensive experiments on\nthree state-of-the-art (SOTA) MLLMs using both automatic metrics and human\nevaluations, thereby summarizing six findings accordingly. Our experimental\nresults highlight the limitations of MLLMs in generating fine-grained\ninteractive features and managing interactions with complex transformations and\nsubtle visual modifications. We further analyze failure cases and their\nunderlying causes, identifying 10 common failure types and assessing their\nseverity. Additionally, our findings reveal three critical influencing factors,\ni.e., prompts, visual saliency, and textual descriptions, that can enhance the\ninteraction generation performance of MLLMs. Based on these findings, we elicit\nimplications for researchers and developers, providing a foundation for future\nadvancements in this field.

                    "value": "Converting webpage design into functional UI code is a critical step for\nbuilding websites, which can be labor-intensive and time-consuming. To automate\nthis design-to-code transformation process, various automated methods using\nlearning-based networks and multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have been\nproposed. However, these studies were merely evaluated on a narrow range of\nstatic web pages and ignored dynamic interaction elements, making them less\npractical for real-world website deployment.\n  To fill in the blank, we present the first systematic investigation of MLLMs\nin generating interactive webpages. Specifically, we first formulate the\nInteraction-to-Code task and build the Interaction2Code benchmark that contains\n97 unique web pages and 213 distinct interactions, spanning 15 webpage types\nand 30 interaction categories. We then conduct comprehensive experiments on\nthree state-of-the-art (SOTA) MLLMs using both automatic metrics and human\nevaluations, thereby summarizing six findings accordingly.

To address these issues,\nwe introduce DiffLM, a controllable data synthesis framework based on\nvariational autoencoder (VAE), which further (1) leverages diffusion models to\nreserve more information of original distribution and format structure in the\nlearned latent distribution and (2) decouples the learning of target\ndistribution knowledge from the LLM's generative objectives via a plug-and-play\nlatent feature injection module. As we observed significant discrepancies\nbetween the VAE's latent representations and the real data distribution, the\nlatent diffusion module is introduced into our framework to learn a fully\nexpressive latent distribution. Evaluations on seven real-world datasets with\nstructured formatted data (i.e., Tabular, Code and Tool data) demonstrate that\nDiffLM generates high-quality data, with performance on downstream tasks\nsurpassing that of real data by 2-7 percent in certain cases. The data and code\nwill be publicly available upon completion of internal review.",

However, comprehensively evaluating the dialogue abilities of LLMs\nremains a challenge. Previous benchmarks have primarily focused on single-turn\ndialogues or provided coarse-grained and incomplete assessments of multi-turn\ndialogues, overlooking the complexity and fine-grained nuances of real-life\ndialogues. To address this issue, we introduce MT-Bench-101, specifically\ndesigned to evaluate the fine-grained abilities of LLMs in multi-turn\ndialogues. By conducting a detailed analysis of real multi-turn dialogue data,\nwe construct a three-tier hierarchical ability taxonomy comprising 4208 turns\nacross 1388 multi-turn dialogues in 13 distinct tasks. We then evaluate 21\npopular LLMs based on MT-Bench-101, conducting comprehensive analyses from both\nability and task perspectives and observing differing trends in LLMs\nperformance across dialogue turns within various tasks. Further analysis\nindicates that neither utilizing common alignment techniques nor chat-specific\ndesigns has led to obvious enhancements in the multi-turn abilities of LLMs.\nExtensive case studies suggest that our designed tasks accurately assess the\ncorresponding multi-turn abilities.

In large language\nmodels (LLMs), a prevalent strategy to reduce hallucinations is to retrieve\nfactual knowledge from an external database. While such retrieval augmentation\nstrategies have great potential to enhance text-to-vision generators, existing\nstatic top-K retrieval methods explore the knowledge pool once, missing the\nbroader context necessary for high-quality generation. Furthermore, LLMs\ninternally possess rich world knowledge learned during large-scale training\n(parametric knowledge) that could mitigate the need for external data\nretrieval. This paper proposes Contextual Knowledge Pursuit (CKPT), a framework\nthat leverages the complementary strengths of external and parametric knowledge\nto help generators produce reliable visual content. Instead of the one-time\nretrieval of facts from an external database to improve a given prompt, CKPT\nuses (1) an LLM to decide whether to seek external knowledge or to self-elicit\ndescriptions from LLM parametric knowledge, (2) a knowledge pursuit process to\ncontextually seek and sequentially gather most relevant facts, (3) a knowledge\naggregator for prompt enhancement with the gathered fact context, and (4) a\nfiltered fine-tuning objective to improve visual synthesis with richer prompts.\nWe evaluate CKPT across multiple text-driven generative tasks (image, 3D\nrendering, and video) on datasets of rare objects and daily scenarios. Our\nresults show that CKPT is capable of generating faithful and semantically rich\ncontent across diverse visual domains, offering a promising data source for\nzero-shot synthesis and filtered fine-tuning of text-to-vision generative\nmodels.",

Although numerous deep\nlearning architectures and models have been proposed, the majority of them have\nbeen solely developed on benchmark datasets that lack strong real-world\nrelevance. Furthermore, the performance of many methods has already saturated\non these datasets. We argue that a shift from a model-centric view to a\ncomplementary data-centric perspective is necessary for further improvements in\naccuracy, generalization ability, and real impact on end-user applications.\nFurthermore, considering the entire machine learning cycle-from problem\ndefinition to model deployment with feedback-is crucial for enhancing machine\nlearning models that can be reliable in unforeseen situations. This work\npresents a definition as well as a precise categorization and overview of\nautomated data-centric learning approaches for geospatial data. It highlights\nthe complementary role of data-centric learning with respect to model-centric\nin the larger machine learning deployment cycle. We review papers across the\nentire geospatial field and categorize them into different groups. A set of\nrepresentative experiments shows concrete implementation examples. These\nexamples provide concrete steps to act on geospatial data with data-centric\nmachine learning approaches.",

                    "value": "Recent developments and research in modern machine learning have led to\nsubstantial improvements in the geospatial field. Although numerous deep\nlearning architectures and models have been proposed, the majority of them have\nbeen solely developed on benchmark datasets that lack strong real-world\nrelevance. Furthermore, the performance of many methods has already saturated\non these datasets. We argue that a shift from a model-centric view to a\ncomplementary data-centric perspective is necessary for further improvements in\naccuracy, generalization ability, and real impact on end-user applications.\nFurthermore, considering the entire machine learning cycle-from problem\ndefinition to model deployment with feedback-is crucial for enhancing machine\nlearning models that can be reliable in unforeseen situations. This work\npresents a definition as well as a precise categorization and overview of\nautomated data-centric learning approaches for geospatial data. It highlights\nthe complementary role of data-centric learning with respect to model-centric\nin the larger machine learning deployment cycle. We review papers across the\nentire geospatial field and categorize them into different groups. A set of\nrepresentative experiments shows concrete implementation examples. These\nexamples provide concrete steps to act on geospatial data with data-centric\nmachine learning approaches."

The advent of Large Language Models, adept at understanding natural\nlanguage and code, offers promising ways to improve the accuracy and usability\nof SAST tools.

To ensure the use of precise and\ncomplete code context, thereby avoiding misguidance and enabling LLMs to reach\naccurate conclusions, we propose LLM4FPM.

Also, the system includes an explainable risk\nprediction module that can generate cardiotoxicity risk scores and summaries as\nexplanations to support clinicians' decision-making. We conducted a heuristic\nevaluation with four clinical experts and found that they all believe CardioAI\nintegrates well into their workflow, reduces their information overload, and\nenables them to make more informed decisions."

Typically, such RAG systems retrieve search results,\ndownload HTML sources of the results, and then extract plain texts from the\nHTML sources. Plain text documents or chunks are fed into the LLMs to augment\nthe generation.

Moreover, our codebase also integrates the most advanced video\nDirect Preference Optimization (DPO) and visual interleave training.

Unlike offline alignment\nwith a fixed dataset, online feedback collection from humans or AI on model\ngenerations typically leads to more capable reward models and better-aligned\nLLMs through an iterative process. However, achieving a globally accurate\nreward model requires systematic exploration to generate diverse responses that\nspan the vast space of natural language. Random sampling from standard\nreward-maximizing LLMs alone is insufficient to fulfill this requirement. To\naddress this issue, we propose a bilevel objective optimistically biased\ntowards potentially high-reward responses to actively explore\nout-of-distribution regions. By solving the inner-level problem with the\nreparameterized reward function, the resulting algorithm, named Self-Exploring\nLanguage Models (SELM), eliminates the need for a separate RM and iteratively\nupdates the LLM with a straightforward objective. Compared to Direct Preference\nOptimization (DPO), the SELM objective reduces indiscriminate favor of unseen\nextrapolations and enhances exploration efficiency.

However, LLMs demand high computational\nresources, making it challenging to deploy them to satisfy various performance\nobjectives, such as meeting the resource constraints on edge devices close to\nend-users or achieving high accuracy with ample resources. In this paper, we\nintroduce CE-CoLLM, a novel cloud-edge collaboration framework that supports\nefficient and adaptive LLM inference for end-users at the edge with two modes,\n(1) low-latency edge standalone inference and (2) highly accurate cloud-edge\ncollaborative inference. First, we show that the inherent high communication\ncosts for transmitting LLM contextual information between the edge and cloud\ndominate the overall latency, making it inefficient and costly to deploy LLMs\nusing cloud-edge collaboration. Second, we propose several critical techniques\nto address this challenge, including early-exit mechanism, cloud context\nmanager, and quantization in cloud-edge collaboration to enable not only\nlow-latency standalone edge inference but also efficient and adaptive\ncloud-edge collaborative inference for LLMs. Third, we perform comprehensive\nexperimental analysis, which demonstrates that CE-CoLLM significantly reduces\ninference time by up to 13.81% and cloud computation costs by up to 84.55%\ncompared to the popular cloud-based LLM deployment, while maintaining\ncomparable model accuracy.

This long-standing software engineering task is crucial for\nmodernizing legacy systems, ensuring cross-platform compatibility, enhancing\nperformance, and more. However, automating this process remains challenging due\nto many syntactic and semantic differences between PLs. Recent studies show\nthat even advanced techniques such as large language models (LLMs), especially\nopen-source LLMs, still struggle with the task. Currently, code LLMs are\ntrained with source code from multiple programming languages, thus presenting\nmultilingual capabilities.\n  In this paper, we investigate whether such multilingual capabilities can be\nharnessed to enhance code translation. To achieve this goal, we introduce\nInterTrans, an LLM-based automated code translation approach that, in contrast\nto existing approaches, leverages intermediate translations across PLs to\nbridge the syntactic and semantic gaps between source and target PLs.\n  InterTrans contains two stages. It first utilizes a novel Tree of Code\nTranslation (ToCT) algorithm to plan transitive intermediate translation\nsequences between a given source and target PL, then validates them in a\nspecific order. We evaluate InterTrans with three open LLMs on three benchmarks\n(i.e., CodeNet, HumanEval-X, and TransCoder) involving six PLs.

We generate multiple translation\ncandidates from a source language A to a target language B, and subsequently\ntranslate these candidates back to the original language A. By evaluating the\ncycle consistency between the original and back-translated sentences using\nmetrics such as token-level precision and accuracy, we implicitly estimate the\ntranslation quality in language B, without knowing its ground-truth. This also\nhelps to evaluate the LLM translation capability, only with monolingual\ncorpora. For each source sentence, we identify the translation candidate with\noptimal cycle consistency with the original sentence as the final answer. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that larger LLMs, or the same LLM with more forward\npasses during inference, exhibit increased cycle consistency, aligning with the\nLLM model size scaling law and test-time computation scaling law.

In this paper, we address this challenge by\nproposing Pearl, a LLM writing assistant personalized with a retriever that is\ntrained to be generation-calibrated for personalization. Generation calibration\nensures that our retriever selects historic user authored documents to augment\nan LLM prompt such that they are likely to help an LLM generation better adhere\nto a users' preferences. We propose two key novelties for training such a\nretriever: (1) A training data selection method that identifies user requests\nlikely to benefit from personalization and documents that provide that benefit;\nand (2) A scale-calibrating KL-divergence objective that ensures that our\nretriever scores remain proportional to the downstream generation quality from\nusing the document for personalized generation. In a series of holistic\nevaluations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of Pearl in generating long-form\ntexts on multiple social media datasets. Finally, we demonstrate how a\ngeneration-calibrated retriever can double as a performance predictor --\ndetecting low quality retrieval, and improving potentially under-performing\noutputs via revision with LLMs.",

                "summary": "Recent advancements in automatic code generation using large language models\n(LLMs) have brought us closer to fully automated secure software development.\nHowever, existing approaches often rely on a single agent for code generation,\nwhich struggles to produce secure, vulnerability-free code. Traditional program\nsynthesis with LLMs has primarily focused on functional correctness, often\nneglecting critical dynamic security implications that happen during runtime.\nTo address these challenges, we propose AutoSafeCoder, a multi-agent framework\nthat leverages LLM-driven agents for code generation, vulnerability analysis,\nand security enhancement through continuous collaboration.

Traditional program\nsynthesis with LLMs has primarily focused on functional correctness, often\nneglecting critical dynamic security implications that happen during runtime.\nTo address these challenges, we propose AutoSafeCoder, a multi-agent framework\nthat leverages LLM-driven agents for code generation, vulnerability analysis,\nand security enhancement through continuous collaboration.

Training, serving, and maintaining\nmonolithic LLMs at scale, however, remains prohibitively expensive and\nchallenging. The disproportionate increase in compute-to-memory ratio of modern\nAI accelerators have created a memory wall, necessitating new methods to deploy\nAI. Composition of Experts (CoE) is an alternative modular approach that lowers\nthe cost and complexity of training and serving. However, this approach\npresents two key challenges when using conventional hardware: (1) without fused\noperations, smaller models have lower operational intensity, which makes high\nutilization more challenging to achieve; and (2) hosting a large number of\nmodels can be either prohibitively expensive or slow when dynamically switching\nbetween them.\n  In this paper, we describe how combining CoE, streaming dataflow, and a\nthree-tier memory system scales the AI memory wall. We describe Samba-CoE, a\nCoE system with 150 experts and a trillion total parameters. We deploy\nSamba-CoE on the SambaNova SN40L Reconfigurable Dataflow Unit (RDU) - a\ncommercial dataflow accelerator architecture that has been co-designed for\nenterprise inference and training applications. The chip introduces a new\nthree-tier memory system with on-chip distributed SRAM, on-package HBM, and\noff-package DDR DRAM. A dedicated inter-RDU network enables scaling up and out\nover multiple sockets. We demonstrate speedups ranging from 2$\\times$ to\n13$\\times$ on various benchmarks running on eight RDU sockets compared with an\nunfused baseline. We show that for CoE inference deployments, the 8-socket RDU\nNode reduces machine footprint by up to 19$\\times$, speeds up model switching\ntime by 15$\\times$ to 31$\\times$, and achieves an overall speedup of\n3.7$\\times$ over a DGX H100 and 6.6$\\times$ over a DGX A100.",

Besides performing well on standard detection datasets,\nShieldLM has also been shown to be effective as a safety evaluator for advanced\nLLMs. ShieldLM is released at \\url{https://github.com/thu-coai/ShieldLM} to\nsupport accurate and explainable safety detection under various safety\nstandards.",

Research in this area has been limited, primarily\nfocusing on lexical matching and ontology based semantic matching. We aimed to\ndevelop new methods, leveraging large language models (LLM) and ensemble\nlearning, to automate variable matching. Methods: We utilized data from two\nGERAS cohort (European and Japan) studies to develop variable matching methods.\nWe first manually created a dataset by matching 352 EU variables with 1322\ncandidate JP variables, where matched variable pairs were positive and\nunmatched pairs were negative instances. Using this dataset, we developed and\nevaluated two types of natural language processing (NLP) methods, which matched\nvariables based on variable labels and definitions from data dictionaries: (1)\nLLM-based and (2) fuzzy matching. We then developed an ensemble-learning\nmethod, using the Random Forest model, to integrate individual NLP methods. RF\nwas trained and evaluated on 50 trials. Each trial had a random split (4:1) of\ntraining and test sets, with the model's hyperparameters optimized through\ncross-validation on the training set. For each EU variable, 1322 candidate JP\nvariables were ranked based on NLP-derived similarity scores or RF's\nprobability scores, denoting their likelihood to match the EU variable. Ranking\nperformance was measured by top-n hit ratio (HRn) and mean reciprocal rank\n(MRR). Results:E5 performed best among individual methods, achieving 0.90 HR-30\nand 0.70 MRR. RF performed better than E5 on all metrics over 50 trials (P less\nthan 0.001) and achieved an average HR 30 of 0.98 and MRR of 0.73. LLM-derived\nfeatures contributed most to RF's performance. One major cause of errors in\nautomatic variable matching was ambiguous variable definitions within data\ndictionaries.",

Concurrently, Tree of Thoughts (ToT)\nmethods have shown potential in improving reasoning for complex\nquestion-answering tasks by exploring diverse reasoning paths. A critical\nlimitation in multi-agent reasoning is the 'Reasoner' agent's shallow\nexploration of reasoning paths. While ToT strategies could help mitigate this\nproblem, they may generate flawed reasoning branches, which could harm the\ntrustworthiness of the final answer. To leverage the strengths of both\nmulti-agent reasoning and ToT strategies, we introduce a novel approach\ncombining ToT-based Reasoner agents with a Thought Validator agent. Multiple\nReasoner agents operate in parallel, employing ToT to explore diverse reasoning\npaths. The Thought Validator then scrutinizes these paths, considering a\nReasoner's conclusion only if its reasoning is valid. This method enables a\nmore robust voting strategy by discarding faulty reasoning paths, enhancing the\nsystem's ability to tackle tasks requiring systematic and trustworthy\nreasoning. Our method demonstrates superior performance compared to existing\ntechniques when evaluated on the GSM8K dataset, outperforming the standard ToT\nstrategy by an average 5.6% across four LLMs. The code and related content can\nbe found in: https://github.com/SecureAIAutonomyLab/MA-ToT",

We investigate LLMs' political\nleanings and the potential influence of LLMs on voters by conducting multiple\nexperiments in a U.S. presidential election context.

We show how this\nleaning towards the Democratic nominee becomes more pronounced in\ninstruction-tuned models compared to their base versions by analyzing their\nresponses to candidate-policy related questions. We further explore the\npotential impact of LLMs on voter choice by conducting an experiment with 935\nU.S. registered voters. During the experiments, participants interacted with\nLLMs (Claude-3, Llama-3, and GPT-4) over five exchanges. The experiment results\nshow a shift in voter choices towards the Democratic nominee following LLM\ninteraction, widening the voting margin from 0.7% to 4.6%, even though LLMs\nwere not asked to persuade users to support the Democratic nominee during the\ndiscourse. This effect is larger than many previous studies on the\npersuasiveness of political campaigns, which have shown minimal effects in\npresidential elections. Many users also expressed a desire for further\npolitical interaction with LLMs. Which aspects of LLM interactions drove these\nshifts in voter choice requires further study. Lastly, we explore how a safety\nmethod can make LLMs more politically neutral, while leaving some open\nquestions.",
