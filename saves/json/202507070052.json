In settings with limited GPU memory, and when the input\ncontext is longer than the generation length, we show that by also compressing\nthe KV cache during the input processing phase, larger batch sizes can be used\nresulting in significantly higher throughput while still maintaining the\noriginal model's accuracy."

Current RPKI design heavily reuses legacy PKI components, such\nas X.509 EE-certificates, ASN.1 encoding, and XML-based repository protocols,\nall these introduce excessive cryptographic validation, redundant metadata, and\ninefficiencies in both storage and processing. We show that these design\nchoices, although based on established standards, create significant\nperformance bottlenecks, increase the vulnerability surface, and hinder\nscalability for wide-scale Internet deployment.\n  In this paper, we perform the first systematic analysis of the root causes of\ncomplexity in RPKI's design and experimentally quantify their real-world\nimpact. We show that over 70% of validation time in RPKI relying parties is\nspent on certificate parsing and signature verification, much of it\nunnecessary. Building on this insight, we introduce the improved RPKI (iRPKI),\na backwards-compatible redesign that preserves all security guarantees while\nsubstantially reducing protocol overhead. iRPKI eliminates EE-certificates and\nROA signatures, merges revocation and integrity objects, replaces verbose\nencodings with Protobuf, and restructures repository metadata for more\nefficient access. We experimentally demonstrate that our implementation of\niRPKI in the Routinator validator achieves a 20x speed-up of processing time,\n18x improvement of bandwidth requirements and 8x reduction in cache memory\nfootprint, while also eliminating classes of vulnerabilities that have led to\nat least 10 vulnerabilities in RPKI software. iRPKI significantly increases the\nfeasibility of deploying RPKI at scale in the Internet, and especially in\nconstrained environments. Our design may be deployed incrementally without\nimpacting existing operations.",

Current RPKI design heavily reuses legacy PKI components, such\nas X.509 EE-certificates, ASN.1 encoding, and XML-based repository protocols,\nall these introduce excessive cryptographic validation, redundant metadata, and\ninefficiencies in both storage and processing. We show that these design\nchoices, although based on established standards, create significant\nperformance bottlenecks, increase the vulnerability surface, and hinder\nscalability for wide-scale Internet deployment.\n  In this paper, we perform the first systematic analysis of the root causes of\ncomplexity in RPKI's design and experimentally quantify their real-world\nimpact. We show that over 70% of validation time in RPKI relying parties is\nspent on certificate parsing and signature verification, much of it\nunnecessary. Building on this insight, we introduce the improved RPKI (iRPKI),\na backwards-compatible redesign that preserves all security guarantees while\nsubstantially reducing protocol overhead. iRPKI eliminates EE-certificates and\nROA signatures, merges revocation and integrity objects, replaces verbose\nencodings with Protobuf, and restructures repository metadata for more\nefficient access. We experimentally demonstrate that our implementation of\niRPKI in the Routinator validator achieves a 20x speed-up of processing time,\n18x improvement of bandwidth requirements and 8x reduction in cache memory\nfootprint, while also eliminating classes of vulnerabilities that have led to\nat least 10 vulnerabilities in RPKI software. iRPKI significantly increases the\nfeasibility of deploying RPKI at scale in the Internet, and especially in\nconstrained environments. Our design may be deployed incrementally without\nimpacting existing operations."

We propose Evolutionary Caching to\nAccelerate Diffusion models (ECAD), a genetic algorithm that learns efficient,\nper-model, caching schedules forming a Pareto frontier, using only a small set\nof calibration prompts. ECAD requires no modifications to network parameters or\nreference images. It offers significant inference speedups, enables\nfine-grained control over the quality-latency trade-off, and adapts seamlessly\nto different diffusion models. Notably, ECAD's learned schedules can generalize\neffectively to resolutions and model variants not seen during calibration. We\nevaluate ECAD on PixArt-alpha, PixArt-Sigma, and FLUX-1$.$dev using multiple\nmetrics (FID, CLIP, Image Reward) across diverse benchmarks (COCO, MJHQ-30k,\nPartiPrompts), demonstrating consistent improvements over previous approaches.\nOn PixArt-alpha, ECAD identifies a schedule that outperforms the previous\nstate-of-the-art method by 4.47 COCO FID while increasing inference speedup\nfrom 2.35x to 2.58x. Our results establish ECAD as a scalable and generalizable\napproach for accelerating diffusion inference.

X-ray diffraction\nanalysis confirmed the single-phase formation of perovskite 65PMN-35PT with a\ntetragonal structure. Morphological studies indicated that the sample consisted\nof small grains with a size of about 2 micro-m. The dielectric properties of\nthe material demonstrate its relaxor behavior near the ferroelectric transition\ntemperature, TC = 457 K. The saturation and remnant polarization values of\napproximately 25.9 and 20.1 micro-C cm-2 were achieved for an electrically\npoled sample. Additionally, the poling induced a negative internal electric\nfield of about -0.2 kV cm-1 was detected due to the presence of ferroelectric\nnano-grains in this bulk 65PMN-35PT sample. These observed characteristics of\nthe pyrochlore-free 65PMN-35PT ceramic are similar to those of its\nsingle-crystal counterpart."

However,\nwe have identified several persistent challenges in these frameworks, including\ndifficulties in algorithm reproduction and sharing, lack of new techniques, and\nhigh system overhead. To address these limitations, we introduce\n\\textbf{FlexRAG}, an open-source framework specifically designed for research\nand prototyping. FlexRAG supports text-based, multimodal, and network-based\nRAG, providing comprehensive lifecycle support alongside efficient asynchronous\nprocessing and persistent caching capabilities. By offering a robust and\nflexible solution, FlexRAG enables researchers to rapidly develop, deploy, and\nshare advanced RAG systems. Our toolkit and resources are available at\n\\href{https://github.com/ictnlp/FlexRAG}{https://github.com/ictnlp/FlexRAG}."

Enhancing the capacity,\ndensity, or bandwidth of these memories can unlock substantial performance\ngains; however, the recent stagnation of SRAM bit-cell scaling leads to\ninequivalent losses in compute density.\n  To address the challenges posed by SRAM's scaling and leakage power\nconsumption, this paper explores the potential CMOS+X integration of amorphous\noxide semiconductor (AOS) transistors in capacitive, persistent memory\ntopologies (e.g., 1T1C eDRAM, 2T0C/3T0C Gain Cell) as alternative cells in\nmulti-ported and high-bandwidth banked GPGPU memories.

This capability is not well captured by\nstandard reinforcement learning algorithms that rely on incremental value\nupdates. Rapid adaptation likely depends on episodic memory -- the ability to\nretrieve specific past experiences to guide decisions in novel contexts.\nTransformers provide a useful setting for studying these questions because of\ntheir ability to learn rapidly in-context and because their key-value\narchitecture resembles episodic memory systems in the brain. We train a\ntransformer to in-context reinforcement learn in a distribution of planning\ntasks inspired by rodent behavior. We then characterize the learning algorithms\nthat emerge in the model. We first find that representation learning is\nsupported by in-context structure learning and cross-context alignment, where\nrepresentations are aligned across environments with different sensory stimuli.\nWe next demonstrate that the reinforcement learning strategies developed by the\nmodel are not interpretable as standard model-free or model-based planning.\nInstead, we show that in-context reinforcement learning is supported by caching\nintermediate computations within the model's memory tokens, which are then\naccessed at decision time. Overall, we find that memory may serve as a\ncomputational resource, storing both raw experience and cached computations to\nsupport flexible behavior. Furthermore, the representations developed in the\nmodel resemble computations associated with the hippocampal-entorhinal system\nin the brain, suggesting that our findings may be relevant for natural\ncognition. Taken together, our work offers a mechanistic hypothesis for the\nrapid adaptation that underlies in-context learning in artificial and natural\nsettings.",

                    "value": "Humans and animals show remarkable learning efficiency, adapting to new\nenvironments with minimal experience. This capability is not well captured by\nstandard reinforcement learning algorithms that rely on incremental value\nupdates. Rapid adaptation likely depends on episodic memory -- the ability to\nretrieve specific past experiences to guide decisions in novel contexts.\nTransformers provide a useful setting for studying these questions because of\ntheir ability to learn rapidly in-context and because their key-value\narchitecture resembles episodic memory systems in the brain. We train a\ntransformer to in-context reinforcement learn in a distribution of planning\ntasks inspired by rodent behavior. We then characterize the learning algorithms\nthat emerge in the model. We first find that representation learning is\nsupported by in-context structure learning and cross-context alignment, where\nrepresentations are aligned across environments with different sensory stimuli.\nWe next demonstrate that the reinforcement learning strategies developed by the\nmodel are not interpretable as standard model-free or model-based planning.\nInstead, we show that in-context reinforcement learning is supported by caching\nintermediate computations within the model's memory tokens, which are then\naccessed at decision time. Overall, we find that memory may serve as a\ncomputational resource, storing both raw experience and cached computations to\nsupport flexible behavior. Furthermore, the representations developed in the\nmodel resemble computations associated with the hippocampal-entorhinal system\nin the brain, suggesting that our findings may be relevant for natural\ncognition. Taken together, our work offers a mechanistic hypothesis for the\nrapid adaptation that underlies in-context learning in artificial and natural\nsettings."

In a recent study, differences of up to a factor\nof 2 were found between the predicted survival of floating and adherent cells.\nThe present work aims to quantify the biases introduced by the simulation setup\nand the use of voxelized geometry in conjunction with the local effect model\nfor cell survival. The results show that simulated irradiation of a cell near\nthe surface with an incident beam matched to the cell dimensions results in\ndose values that are by a factor of about 50 lower than the dose to cells\ndeeper in the medium when irradiated with a Co-60 spectrum and lateral beam\ndimensions in the centimeter range. Furthermore, the number of ionizing photon\ninteractions in gold nanoparticles in a cell near the surface is lower by a\nfactor of about 2 than for cells at 5 mm and 1 cm depth. Using the average dose\nin voxels of size in the order of 200 nm for assessing cell survival with the\nlocal effect model (LEM) leads to an underestimation of the number of lesions\nfrom a single ionized AuNP by roughly two orders of magnitude and thus to an\noverestimation of cell survival. The effect of cell geometry on the survival\nrate was examined for approximate cell geometries and 100 kV x-ray irradiation,\nfor which the probability of photon interaction in gold nanoparticles is by\nmore than two orders of magnitude higher than for Co-60 irradiation. The\nresults show that the effects are negligible for 5 nm nanoparticles at the\nconcentration of AuNPs considered in preceding work. For 50 nm nanoparticles\nand thus a thousand times higher mass fraction of gold, significant reduction\nin cell survival is found, with a clear additional reduction predicted by the\nLEM as compared to the prediction based on mean dose to the nucleus.",

By reducing redundant token computation and\ncaching past motion features, CronusVLA achieves efficient inference.

We observe that quantizing\nthe KV cache of different tokens has varying impacts on the quality of\nattention outputs. To systematically investigate this phenomenon, we perform\nforward error propagation analysis on attention and propose the Anchor Score\n(AnS) that quantifies the sensitivity of each token's KV cache to\nquantization-induced error. Our analysis reveals significant disparities in AnS\nacross tokens, suggesting that preserving a small subset with full precision\n(FP16) of high-AnS tokens can greatly mitigate accuracy loss in aggressive\nquantization scenarios. Based on this insight, we introduce AnTKV, a novel\nframework that leverages Anchor Token-aware Vector Quantization to compress the\nKV cache. Furthermore, to support efficient deployment, we design and develop a\ntriton kernel that is fully compatible with FlashAttention, enabling fast\nonline Anchor Token selection. AnTKV enables LLaMA-3-8B to handle context\nlengths up to 840K tokens on a single 80GB A100 GPU, while achieving up to 3.5x\nhigher decoding throughput compared to the FP16 baseline. Our experiment\nresults demonstrate that AnTKV matches or outperforms prior works such as KIVI,\nSKVQ, KVQuant, and CQ under 4-bit settings. More importantly, AnTKV achieves\nsignificantly lower perplexity under ultra-low-bit quantization on Mistral-7B,\nwith only 6.32 at 1-bit and 8.87 at 0.375-bit, compared to the FP16 baseline of\n4.73.",

Furthermore, to support efficient deployment, we design and develop a\ntriton kernel that is fully compatible with FlashAttention, enabling fast\nonline Anchor Token selection. AnTKV enables LLaMA-3-8B to handle context\nlengths up to 840K tokens on a single 80GB A100 GPU, while achieving up to 3.5x\nhigher decoding throughput compared to the FP16 baseline. Our experiment\nresults demonstrate that AnTKV matches or outperforms prior works such as KIVI,\nSKVQ, KVQuant, and CQ under 4-bit settings. More importantly, AnTKV achieves\nsignificantly lower perplexity under ultra-low-bit quantization on Mistral-7B,\nwith only 6.32 at 1-bit and 8.87 at 0.375-bit, compared to the FP16 baseline of\n4.73."

This paper\nintroduces the Co-Forgetting Protocol, a novel, comprehensive framework\ndesigned to address this challenge by enabling synchronized memory pruning in\nMAS. The protocol integrates three key components: (1) context-aware semantic\nvoting, where agents utilize a lightweight DistilBERT model to assess the\nrelevance of memory items based on their content and the current operational\ncontext; (2) multi-scale temporal decay functions, which assign diminishing\nimportance to memories based on their age and access frequency across different\ntime horizons; and (3) a Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT)-based\nconsensus mechanism, ensuring that decisions to retain or discard memory items\nare agreed upon by a qualified and fault-tolerant majority of agents, even in\nthe presence of up to f Byzantine (malicious or faulty) agents in a system of N\ngreater than or equal to 3f+1 agents. The protocol leverages gRPC for efficient\ninter-agent communication and Pinecone for scalable vector embedding storage\nand similarity search, with SQLite managing metadata. Experimental evaluations\nin a simulated MAS environment with four agents demonstrate the protocol's\nefficacy, achieving a 52% reduction in memory footprint over 500 epochs, 88%\nvoting accuracy in forgetting decisions against human-annotated benchmarks, a\n92% PBFT consensus success rate under simulated Byzantine conditions, and an\n82% cache hit rate for memory access.",

To address\nthis challenge, we propose Video-XL-2, a novel MLLM that delivers superior\ncost-effectiveness for long-video understanding based on task-aware KV\nsparsification. The proposed framework operates with two key steps: chunk-based\npre-filling and bi-level key-value decoding. Chunk-based pre-filling divides\nthe visual token sequence into chunks, applying full attention within each\nchunk and sparse attention across chunks. This significantly reduces\ncomputational and memory overhead. During decoding, bi-level key-value decoding\nselectively reloads either dense or sparse key-values for each chunk based on\nits relevance to the task. This approach further improves memory efficiency and\nenhances the model's ability to capture fine-grained information.

This can be a major bottleneck; since sparse\ncomputation is often bandwidth-bound, the cost of loading or storing a matrix\nto disk often exceeds the cost of performing a sparse computation. While it is\ncommon practice for practitioners to develop their own, custom, non-portable\nbinary formats for high-performance sparse matrix storage, there is currently\nno cross-platform binary sparse matrix storage format. We present Binsparse, a\ncross-platform binary sparse matrix and tensor format specification. Binsparse\nis a modular, embeddable format, consisting of a JSON descriptor, which\ndescribes the matrix or tensor dimensions, type, and format, and a series of\nbinary arrays, which can be stored in all modern binary containers, such as\nHDF5, Zarr, or NPZ. We provide several reference implementations of Binsparse\nspanning 5 languages, 5 frameworks, and 4 binary containers. We evaluate our\nBinsparse format on every matrix in the SuiteSparse Matrix Collection and a\nselection of tensors from the FROSTT collection. The Binsparse HDF5 CSR format\nshows file size reductions of 2.4x on average without compression and 7.5x with\ncompression. We evaluate our parser's read/write performance against a\nstate-of-the-art Matrix Market parser, demonstrating warm cache mean read\nspeedups of 26.5x without compression and 2.6x with compression, and write\nspeedups of 31x without compression and 1.4x with compression.",

To address this, we propose Commutative\nVector Quantization (CommVQ) to significantly reduce memory usage for\nlong-context LLM inference. We first introduce additive quantization with a\nlightweight encoder and codebook to compress the KV cache, which can be decoded\nvia simple matrix multiplication. To further reduce computational costs during\ndecoding, we design the codebook to be commutative with Rotary Position\nEmbedding (RoPE) and train it using an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm.\nThis enables efficient integration of decoding into the self-attention\nmechanism. Our approach achieves high accuracy with additive quantization and\nlow overhead via the RoPE-commutative codebook. Experiments on long-context\nbenchmarks and GSM8K show that our method reduces FP16 KV cache size by 87.5%\nwith 2-bit quantization, while outperforming state-of-the-art KV cache\nquantization methods. Notably, it enables 1-bit KV cache quantization with\nminimal accuracy loss, allowing a LLaMA-3.1 8B model to run with a 128K context\nlength on a single RTX 4090 GPU.

                "summary": "The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs), driven by growing\nparameter scales, adoption of mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures, and\nexpanding context lengths, imposes unprecedented demands on AI infrastructure.\nTraditional AI clusters face limitations in compute intensity, memory\nbandwidth, inter-chip communication, and latency, compounded by variable\nworkloads and strict service-level objectives. Addressing these issues requires\nfundamentally redesigned hardware-software integration. This paper introduces\nHuawei CloudMatrix, a next-generation AI datacenter architecture, realized in\nthe production-grade CloudMatrix384 supernode. It integrates 384 Ascend 910\nNPUs and 192 Kunpeng CPUs interconnected via an ultra-high-bandwidth Unified\nBus (UB) network, enabling direct all-to-all communication and dynamic pooling\nof resources.

Addressing these issues requires\nfundamentally redesigned hardware-software integration. This paper introduces\nHuawei CloudMatrix, a next-generation AI datacenter architecture, realized in\nthe production-grade CloudMatrix384 supernode. It integrates 384 Ascend 910\nNPUs and 192 Kunpeng CPUs interconnected via an ultra-high-bandwidth Unified\nBus (UB) network, enabling direct all-to-all communication and dynamic pooling\nof resources. These features optimize performance for communication-intensive\noperations, such as large-scale MoE expert parallelism and distributed\nkey-value cache access.

To validate our approach, we prototype a\nCXL-SSD on a custom FPGA platform and propose annotation mechanisms,\nDeterminism and Bufferability, to enhance performance while preserving data\npersistency. Our simulation-based evaluation demonstrates that CXL-SSD achieves\n10.9x better performance than PCIe-based memory expanders and further reduces\nlatency by 5.4x with annotation enhancements. In workloads with high locality,\nCXL-SSD approaches DRAM-like performance due to efficient on-chip caching.

To achieve this, existing\nmethods often require intricate modifications to prompting and sampling\nstrategies. In this work, we introduce representation consistency (RC), a\ntest-time scaling method for aggregating answers drawn from multiple candidate\nresponses of an LLM regardless of how they were generated, including variations\nin prompt phrasing and sampling strategy. RC enhances answer aggregation by not\nonly considering the number of occurrences of each answer in the candidate\nresponse set, but also the consistency of the model's internal activations\nwhile generating the set of responses leading to each answer. These activations\ncan be either dense (raw model activations) or sparse (encoded via pretrained\nsparse autoencoders). Our rationale is that if the model's representations of\nmultiple responses converging on the same answer are highly variable, this\nanswer is more likely to be the result of incoherent reasoning and should be\ndown-weighted during aggregation. Importantly, our method only uses cached\nactivations and lightweight similarity computations and requires no additional\nmodel queries. Through experiments with four open-source LLMs and four\nreasoning datasets, we validate the effectiveness of RC for improving task\nperformance during inference, with consistent accuracy improvements (up to 4%)\nover strong test-time scaling baselines. We also show that consistency in the\nsparse activation signals aligns well with the common notion of coherent\nreasoning.",

However, in practical\napplications, hardware limitations often degrade data quality, while real-time\nconstraints restrict model inference to instantaneous state and scene\nobservations. These limitations seriously reduce the efficacy of learning from\nexpert demonstrations, resulting in failures in object localization, grasp\nplanning, and long-horizon task execution. To address these challenges, we\npropose Causal Diffusion Policy (CDP), a novel transformer-based diffusion\nmodel that enhances action prediction by conditioning on historical action\nsequences, thereby enabling more coherent and context-aware visuomotor policy\nlearning. To further mitigate the computational cost associated with\nautoregressive inference, a caching mechanism is also introduced to store\nattention key-value pairs from previous timesteps, substantially reducing\nredundant computations during execution. Extensive experiments in both\nsimulated and real-world environments, spanning diverse 2D and 3D manipulation\ntasks, demonstrate that CDP uniquely leverages historical action sequences to\nachieve significantly higher accuracy than existing methods. Moreover, even\nwhen faced with degraded input observation quality, CDP maintains remarkable\nprecision by reasoning through temporal continuity, which highlights its\npractical robustness for robotic control under realistic, imperfect conditions.",

                    "value": "Diffusion Policy (DP) enables robots to learn complex behaviors by imitating\nexpert demonstrations through action diffusion. However, in practical\napplications, hardware limitations often degrade data quality, while real-time\nconstraints restrict model inference to instantaneous state and scene\nobservations. These limitations seriously reduce the efficacy of learning from\nexpert demonstrations, resulting in failures in object localization, grasp\nplanning, and long-horizon task execution. To address these challenges, we\npropose Causal Diffusion Policy (CDP), a novel transformer-based diffusion\nmodel that enhances action prediction by conditioning on historical action\nsequences, thereby enabling more coherent and context-aware visuomotor policy\nlearning. To further mitigate the computational cost associated with\nautoregressive inference, a caching mechanism is also introduced to store\nattention key-value pairs from previous timesteps, substantially reducing\nredundant computations during execution. Extensive experiments in both\nsimulated and real-world environments, spanning diverse 2D and 3D manipulation\ntasks, demonstrate that CDP uniquely leverages historical action sequences to\nachieve significantly higher accuracy than existing methods. Moreover, even\nwhen faced with degraded input observation quality, CDP maintains remarkable\nprecision by reasoning through temporal continuity, which highlights its\npractical robustness for robotic control under realistic, imperfect conditions."

To address these\nissues, this paper proposes a comprehensive optimization approach centered on\nmulti-attention interaction mechanisms. First, an unsupervised,\nstatistics-guided diffusion model is employed to perform data augmentation,\nthereby alleviating the problems of labeled data scarcity and severe class\nimbalance. Second, a multi-branch spatio-temporal interaction network is\ndesigned, which captures multi-scale features of sequential data through\nparallel residual branches with 3*3, 5*5, and 7*7 convolutional kernels.\nSimultaneously, temporal attention mechanisms are incorporated to identify\ncritical time points, while spatial attention enhances inter-sensor\ninteractions. A cross-branch feature fusion unit is further introduced to\nimprove the overall feature representation capability. Finally, an adaptive\nmulti-loss function fusion strategy is integrated, allowing for dynamic\nadjustment of loss weights and overall model optimization. Experimental results\non three public datasets, WISDM, PAMAP2, and OPPORTUNITY, demonstrate that the\nproposed unsupervised data augmentation spatio-temporal attention diffusion\nnetwork (USAD) achieves accuracies of 98.84%, 93.81%, and 80.92% respectively,\nsignificantly outperforming existing approaches.

However, these approaches have often suffered from the catastrophic\nforgetting of the LLM's original language abilities. To address this, we\nrevisit the data construction pipeline and propose DeSTA, a self-generated\ncross-modal alignment strategy in which the backbone LLM generates its own\ntraining targets. This approach preserves the LLM's native language proficiency\nwhile establishing effective audio-text alignment, thereby enabling zero-shot\ngeneralization without task-specific tuning. Using DeSTA, we construct\nDeSTA-AQA5M, a large-scale, task-agnostic dataset containing 5 million training\nsamples derived from 7,000 hours of audio spanning 50 diverse datasets,\nincluding speech, environmental sounds, and music. DeSTA2.5-Audio achieves\nstate-of-the-art or competitive performance across a wide range of\naudio-language benchmarks, including Dynamic-SUPERB, MMAU, SAKURA,\nSpeech-IFEval, and VoiceBench.

                    "value": "Reasoning remains a challenging task for large language models (LLMs),\nespecially within the logically constrained environment of automated theorem\nproving (ATP), due to sparse rewards and the vast scale of proofs. These\nchallenges are amplified in benchmarks like PutnamBench, which contains\nuniversity-level problems requiring complex, multi-step reasoning. To address\nthis, we introduce self-generated goal-conditioned MDPs (sG-MDPs), a new\nframework in which agents generate and pursue their subgoals based on the\nevolving proof state. Given this more structured generation of goals, the\nresulting problem becomes more amenable to search. We then apply Monte Carlo\nTree Search (MCTS)-like algorithms to solve the sG-MDP, instantiating our\napproach in Bourbaki (7B), a modular system that can ensemble multiple 7B LLMs\nfor subgoal generation and tactic synthesis. On PutnamBench, Bourbaki (7B)\nsolves 26 problems, achieving new state-of-the-art results with models at this\nscale."

We first present a comprehensive taxonomy of limitation\ntypes in scientific research, with a focus on AI. Guided by this taxonomy, for\nstudying limitations, we present LimitGen, the first comprehensive benchmark\nfor evaluating LLMs' capability to support early-stage feedback and complement\nhuman peer review. Our benchmark consists of two subsets: LimitGen-Syn, a\nsynthetic dataset carefully created through controlled perturbations of\nhigh-quality papers, and LimitGen-Human, a collection of real human-written\nlimitations. To improve the ability of LLM systems to identify limitations, we\naugment them with literature retrieval, which is essential for grounding\nidentifying limitations in prior scientific findings. Our approach enhances the\ncapabilities of LLM systems to generate limitations in research papers,\nenabling them to provide more concrete and constructive feedback."

                "summary": "Speculative decoding generally dictates having a small, efficient draft model\nthat is either pretrained or distilled offline to a particular target model\nseries, for instance, Llama or Qwen models. However, within online deployment\nsettings, there are two major challenges: 1) usage of a target model that is\nincompatible with the draft model; 2) expectation of latency improvements over\nusage and time. In this work, we propose OmniDraft, a unified framework that\nenables a single draft model to operate with any target model and adapt\ndynamically to user data. We introduce an online n-gram cache with hybrid\ndistillation fine-tuning to address the cross-vocabulary mismatch across draft\nand target models; and further improve decoding speed by leveraging adaptive\ndrafting techniques. OmniDraft is particularly suitable for on-device LLM\napplications where model cost, efficiency and user customization are the major\npoints of contention.

                    "value": "Speculative decoding generally dictates having a small, efficient draft model\nthat is either pretrained or distilled offline to a particular target model\nseries, for instance, Llama or Qwen models. However, within online deployment\nsettings, there are two major challenges: 1) usage of a target model that is\nincompatible with the draft model; 2) expectation of latency improvements over\nusage and time. In this work, we propose OmniDraft, a unified framework that\nenables a single draft model to operate with any target model and adapt\ndynamically to user data. We introduce an online n-gram cache with hybrid\ndistillation fine-tuning to address the cross-vocabulary mismatch across draft\nand target models; and further improve decoding speed by leveraging adaptive\ndrafting techniques. OmniDraft is particularly suitable for on-device LLM\napplications where model cost, efficiency and user customization are the major\npoints of contention.

While post-training techniques like Reinforcement Learning\nfrom Human Feedback (RLHF) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) have\nachieved notable success, they often introduce computational inefficiencies and\ntraining instability. In this paper, we propose Feature-level constrained\nPreference Optimization (FPO), a novel method designed to simplify the\nalignment process while ensuring stability. FPO leverages pre-trained Sparse\nAutoencoders (SAEs) and introduces feature-level constraints, allowing for\nefficient, sparsity-enforced alignment.

                    "value": "The alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human preferences remains\na key challenge. While post-training techniques like Reinforcement Learning\nfrom Human Feedback (RLHF) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) have\nachieved notable success, they often introduce computational inefficiencies and\ntraining instability. In this paper, we propose Feature-level constrained\nPreference Optimization (FPO), a novel method designed to simplify the\nalignment process while ensuring stability. FPO leverages pre-trained Sparse\nAutoencoders (SAEs) and introduces feature-level constraints, allowing for\nefficient, sparsity-enforced alignment.

Yet their robustness to distribution shifts\non unseen data remains a key concern for safe deployment. Evaluating such\nrobustness requires a controlled experimental setup that allows for systematic\ninsights into the model's behavior. However, we demonstrate that current setups\nfail to offer sufficiently thorough evaluations. To address this gap, we\nintroduce a novel framework, called SURE-VQA, centered around three key\nrequirements to overcome current pitfalls and systematically analyze VLM\nrobustness: 1) Since robustness on synthetic shifts does not necessarily\ntranslate to real-world shifts, it should be measured on real-world shifts that\nare inherent to the VQA data; 2) Traditional token-matching metrics often fail\nto capture underlying semantics, necessitating the use of large language models\n(LLMs) for more accurate semantic evaluation; 3) Model performance often lacks\ninterpretability due to missing sanity baselines, thus meaningful baselines\nshould be reported that allow assessing the multimodal impact on the VLM. To\ndemonstrate the relevance of this framework, we conduct a study on the\nrobustness of various Fine-Tuning (FT) methods across three medical datasets\nwith four types of distribution shifts. Our study highlights key insights into\nrobustness: 1) No FT method consistently outperforms others in robustness, and\n2) robustness trends are more stable across FT methods than across distribution\nshifts. Additionally, we find that simple sanity baselines that do not use the\nimage data can perform surprisingly well and confirm LoRA as the\nbest-performing FT method on in-distribution data.

While label variation (LV), i.e., differing labels for the\nsame instance, is common, especially in natural language processing, annotation\nframeworks often still rest on the assumption of a single ground truth. This\noverlooks human label variation (HLV), the occurrence of plausible differences\nin annotations, as an informative signal. Similarly, active learning (AL), a\npopular approach to optimizing the use of limited annotation budgets in\ntraining ML models, often relies on at least one of several simplifying\nassumptions, which rarely hold in practice when acknowledging HLV. In this\npaper, we examine foundational assumptions about truth and label nature,\nhighlighting the need to decompose observed LV into signal (e.g., HLV) and\nnoise (e.g., annotation error). We survey how the AL and (H)LV communities have\naddressed -- or neglected -- these distinctions and propose a conceptual\nframework for incorporating HLV throughout the AL loop, including instance\nselection, annotator choice, and label representation. We further discuss the\nintegration of large language models (LLM) as annotators. Our work aims to lay\na conceptual foundation for HLV-aware active learning, better reflecting the\ncomplexities of real-world annotation.",

                    "value": "Access to high-quality labeled data remains a limiting factor in applied\nsupervised learning. While label variation (LV), i.e., differing labels for the\nsame instance, is common, especially in natural language processing, annotation\nframeworks often still rest on the assumption of a single ground truth. This\noverlooks human label variation (HLV), the occurrence of plausible differences\nin annotations, as an informative signal. Similarly, active learning (AL), a\npopular approach to optimizing the use of limited annotation budgets in\ntraining ML models, often relies on at least one of several simplifying\nassumptions, which rarely hold in practice when acknowledging HLV. In this\npaper, we examine foundational assumptions about truth and label nature,\nhighlighting the need to decompose observed LV into signal (e.g., HLV) and\nnoise (e.g., annotation error). We survey how the AL and (H)LV communities have\naddressed -- or neglected -- these distinctions and propose a conceptual\nframework for incorporating HLV throughout the AL loop, including instance\nselection, annotator choice, and label representation. We further discuss the\nintegration of large language models (LLM) as annotators. Our work aims to lay\na conceptual foundation for HLV-aware active learning, better reflecting the\ncomplexities of real-world annotation."

This study introduces LLMREI, a chat bot\ndesigned to conduct requirements elicitation interviews with minimal human\nintervention, aiming to reduce common interviewer errors and improve the\nscalability of requirements elicitation. We explored two main approaches,\nzero-shot prompting and least-to-most prompting, to optimize LLMREI for\nrequirements elicitation and evaluated its performance in 33 simulated\nstakeholder interviews. A third approach, fine-tuning, was initially considered\nbut abandoned due to poor performance in preliminary trials. Our study assesses\nthe chat bot's effectiveness in three key areas: minimizing common interview\nerrors, extracting relevant requirements, and adapting its questioning based on\ninterview context and user responses. Our findings indicate that LLMREI makes a\nsimilar number of errors compared to human interviewers, is capable of\nextracting a large portion of requirements, and demonstrates a notable ability\nto generate highly context-dependent questions. We envision the greatest\nbenefit of LLMREI in automating interviews with a large number of stakeholders.",

Current approaches to fairness testing in large language\nmodels (LLMs) often rely on manual evaluation, fixed templates, deterministic\nheuristics, and curated datasets, making them resource-intensive and difficult\nto scale. This work aims to lay the groundwork for a novel, automated method\nfor testing fairness in LLMs, reducing the dependence on domain-specific\nresources and broadening the applicability of current approaches. Our approach,\nMeta-Fair, is based on two key ideas. First, we adopt metamorphic testing to\nuncover bias by examining how model outputs vary in response to controlled\nmodifications of input prompts, defined by metamorphic relations (MRs). Second,\nwe propose exploiting the potential of LLMs for both test case generation and\noutput evaluation, leveraging their capability to generate diverse inputs and\nclassify outputs effectively. The proposal is complemented by three open-source\ntools supporting LLM-driven generation, execution, and evaluation of test\ncases. We report the findings of several experiments involving 12 pre-trained\nLLMs, 14 MRs, 5 bias dimensions, and 7.9K automatically generated test cases.\nThe results show that Meta-Fair is effective in uncovering bias in LLMs,\nachieving an average precision of 92% and revealing biased behaviour in 29% of\nexecutions. Additionally, LLMs prove to be reliable and consistent evaluators,\nwith the best-performing models achieving F1-scores of up to 0.79. Although\nnon-determinism affects consistency, these effects can be mitigated through\ncareful MR design. While challenges remain to ensure broader applicability, the\nresults indicate a promising path towards an unprecedented level of automation\nin LLM testing.",

To\naddress these limitations, alternative model architectures, optimization\nstrategies, communication-aware network topologies, and novel system design\napproaches have been proposed in literature. This paper introduces a\nperformance-cost modeling methodology for LLM training and inference that\nintegrates state-of-the-art compute techniques with memory optimizations, and\nlatest communication techniques. Building on an analytical performance model,\nour approach incorporates recent innovations such as the flash attention\ntechnique and mixture of experts models to address the memory bandwidth and\ncompute bottlenecks. It also considers the impact of different network\ntopologies and topology-specific communication algorithms with 5D parallellism.\nThe framework also integrates a chiplet cost model. The proposed modeling\nmethodology provides valuable insights to guide future compute system design\nand facilitates hardware-software co-development, in particular due to its\nability to analyze performance-cost trade-offs for various system architectural\nconfigurations."

We evaluate our approach on five specialized vision\ntasks, which cover a variety of visual formats including charts, tables,\nreceipts, and reports. The results demonstrate that under data-limited regimes\nour approach significantly improves upon fine-tuning and distillation."

The solutions reveal a maneuvering 'budget' wherein the degradation\nof the mirror surface is directly linked to the choice of maneuvers and their\nsequence. By simulating ten years of typical operation, we show that, while the\nmaximal deformation might reach several microns, the spatial distribution of\nthe deformation and their propagation rate allows the telescope to maintain its\noptical functionality for years, with at least a substantial portion of the\naperture remaining suitable for astronomical observations.

A\nkey metric for understanding blood glucose dynamics after eating is the\npostprandial area under the curve (AUC). Predicting postprandial AUC in advance\nbased on a person's lifestyle factors, such as diet and physical activity\nlevel, and explaining the factors that affect postprandial blood glucose could\nallow an individual to adjust their lifestyle accordingly to maintain normal\nglucose levels. In this study, we developed an explainable machine learning\nsolution, GlucoLens, that takes sensor-driven inputs and uses advanced data\nprocessing, large language models, and trainable machine learning models to\npredict postprandial AUC and hyperglycemia from diet, physical activity, and\nrecent glucose patterns. We used data obtained from wearables in a five-week\nclinical trial of 10 adults who worked full-time to develop and evaluate the\nproposed computational model that integrates wearable sensing, multimodal data,\nand machine learning. Our machine learning model takes multimodal data from\nwearable activity and glucose monitoring sensors, along with food and work\nlogs, and provides an interpretable prediction of the postprandial glucose\npattern. Our GlucoLens system achieves a normalized root mean squared error\n(NRMSE) of 0.123 in its best configuration. On average, the proposed technology\nprovides a 16% better performance level compared to the comparison models.\nAdditionally, our technique predicts hyperglycemia with an accuracy of 73.3%\nand an F1 score of 0.716 and recommends different treatment options to help\navoid hyperglycemia through diverse counterfactual explanations.

Recent LALMs\ntypically augment Large Language Models (LLMs) with auditory capabilities by\ntraining on large-scale, manually curated or LLM-synthesized audio-instruction\ndatasets. However, these approaches have often suffered from the catastrophic\nforgetting of the LLM's original language abilities. To address this, we\nrevisit the data construction pipeline and propose DeSTA, a self-generated\ncross-modal alignment strategy in which the backbone LLM generates its own\ntraining targets. This approach preserves the LLM's native language proficiency\nwhile establishing effective audio-text alignment, thereby enabling zero-shot\ngeneralization without task-specific tuning. Using DeSTA, we construct\nDeSTA-AQA5M, a large-scale, task-agnostic dataset containing 5 million training\nsamples derived from 7,000 hours of audio spanning 50 diverse datasets,\nincluding speech, environmental sounds, and music. DeSTA2.5-Audio achieves\nstate-of-the-art or competitive performance across a wide range of\naudio-language benchmarks, including Dynamic-SUPERB, MMAU, SAKURA,\nSpeech-IFEval, and VoiceBench. Comprehensive comparative studies demonstrate\nthat our self-generated strategy outperforms widely adopted data construction\nand training strategies in both auditory perception and instruction-following\ncapabilities.

We believe that\nthis is partly due to the widespread presence of suboptimal ordering within the\ndata for each proof used in training. For example, published proofs often\nfollow a purely logical order, where each step logically proceeds from the\nprevious steps based on the deductive rules. This order is designed to\nfacilitate the verification of the proof's soundness, rather than to help\npeople and models learn the discovery process of the proof.

We believe that\nthis is partly due to the widespread presence of suboptimal ordering within the\ndata for each proof used in training. For example, published proofs often\nfollow a purely logical order, where each step logically proceeds from the\nprevious steps based on the deductive rules. This order is designed to\nfacilitate the verification of the proof's soundness, rather than to help\npeople and models learn the discovery process of the proof.

However, high-quality\nvision-language reasoning data is expensive and labor-intensive to annotate. To\naddress this issue, we leverage a promising resource: game code, which\nnaturally contains logical structures and state transition processes.\nTherefore, we propose Code2Logic, a novel game-code-driven approach for\nmultimodal reasoning data synthesis. Our approach leverages Large Language\nModels (LLMs) to adapt game code, enabling automatic acquisition of reasoning\nprocesses and results through code execution. Using the Code2Logic approach, we\ndeveloped the GameQA dataset to train and evaluate VLMs. GameQA is\ncost-effective and scalable, offers controllable difficulty gradation and is\ndiverse with 30 games and 158 tasks. Surprisingly, despite training solely on\ngame data, VLMs demonstrated out of domain generalization, specifically\nQwen2.5-VL-7B improving performance by 2.33% across 7 diverse vision-language\nbenchmarks.

However, high-quality\nvision-language reasoning data is expensive and labor-intensive to annotate. To\naddress this issue, we leverage a promising resource: game code, which\nnaturally contains logical structures and state transition processes.\nTherefore, we propose Code2Logic, a novel game-code-driven approach for\nmultimodal reasoning data synthesis. Our approach leverages Large Language\nModels (LLMs) to adapt game code, enabling automatic acquisition of reasoning\nprocesses and results through code execution. Using the Code2Logic approach, we\ndeveloped the GameQA dataset to train and evaluate VLMs. GameQA is\ncost-effective and scalable, offers controllable difficulty gradation and is\ndiverse with 30 games and 158 tasks. Surprisingly, despite training solely on\ngame data, VLMs demonstrated out of domain generalization, specifically\nQwen2.5-VL-7B improving performance by 2.33% across 7 diverse vision-language\nbenchmarks. Our code, dataset and models are available at\nhttps://github.com/tongjingqi/Code2Logic."

However, within online deployment\nsettings, there are two major challenges: 1) usage of a target model that is\nincompatible with the draft model; 2) expectation of latency improvements over\nusage and time. In this work, we propose OmniDraft, a unified framework that\nenables a single draft model to operate with any target model and adapt\ndynamically to user data. We introduce an online n-gram cache with hybrid\ndistillation fine-tuning to address the cross-vocabulary mismatch across draft\nand target models; and further improve decoding speed by leveraging adaptive\ndrafting techniques. OmniDraft is particularly suitable for on-device LLM\napplications where model cost, efficiency and user customization are the major\npoints of contention. This further highlights the need to tackle the above\nchallenges and motivates the \\textit{``one drafter for all''} paradigm. We\nshowcase the proficiency of the OmniDraft framework by performing online\nlearning on math reasoning, coding and text generation tasks. Notably,\nOmniDraft enables a single Llama-68M model to pair with various target models\nincluding Vicuna-7B, Qwen2-7B and Llama3-8B models for speculative decoding;\nand additionally provides up to 1.5-2x speedup.",

In this work, we propose OmniDraft, a unified framework that\nenables a single draft model to operate with any target model and adapt\ndynamically to user data. We introduce an online n-gram cache with hybrid\ndistillation fine-tuning to address the cross-vocabulary mismatch across draft\nand target models; and further improve decoding speed by leveraging adaptive\ndrafting techniques. OmniDraft is particularly suitable for on-device LLM\napplications where model cost, efficiency and user customization are the major\npoints of contention. This further highlights the need to tackle the above\nchallenges and motivates the \\textit{``one drafter for all''} paradigm. We\nshowcase the proficiency of the OmniDraft framework by performing online\nlearning on math reasoning, coding and text generation tasks. Notably,\nOmniDraft enables a single Llama-68M model to pair with various target models\nincluding Vicuna-7B, Qwen2-7B and Llama3-8B models for speculative decoding;\nand additionally provides up to 1.5-2x speedup."

This frequently results in suboptimal item\nmodeling and user preference learning, thereby ultimately constraining\nrecommendation performance. To address these challenges, we introduce\nVRAgent-R1, a novel agent-based paradigm that incorporates human-like\nintelligence in user simulation. Specifically, VRAgent-R1 comprises two\ndistinct agents: the Item Perception (IP) Agent and the User Simulation (US)\nAgent, designed for interactive user-item modeling. Firstly, the IP Agent\nemulates human-like progressive thinking based on MLLMs, effectively capturing\nhidden recommendation semantics in videos. With a more comprehensive multimodal\ncontent understanding provided by the IP Agent, the video recommendation system\nis equipped to provide higher-quality candidate items. Subsequently, the US\nAgent refines the recommended video sets based on in-depth chain-of-thought\n(CoT) reasoning and achieves better alignment with real user preferences\nthrough reinforcement learning. Experimental results on a large-scale video\nrecommendation benchmark have demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed\nVRAgent-R1 method, e.g., the IP Agent achieves a 6.0\\% improvement in NDCG@10\non the MicroLens-100k dataset, while the US Agent shows approximately 45.0\\%\nhigher accuracy in user decision simulation compared to state-of-the-art\nbaselines.",

Yet their robustness to distribution shifts\non unseen data remains a key concern for safe deployment. Evaluating such\nrobustness requires a controlled experimental setup that allows for systematic\ninsights into the model's behavior. However, we demonstrate that current setups\nfail to offer sufficiently thorough evaluations. To address this gap, we\nintroduce a novel framework, called SURE-VQA, centered around three key\nrequirements to overcome current pitfalls and systematically analyze VLM\nrobustness: 1) Since robustness on synthetic shifts does not necessarily\ntranslate to real-world shifts, it should be measured on real-world shifts that\nare inherent to the VQA data; 2) Traditional token-matching metrics often fail\nto capture underlying semantics, necessitating the use of large language models\n(LLMs) for more accurate semantic evaluation; 3) Model performance often lacks\ninterpretability due to missing sanity baselines, thus meaningful baselines\nshould be reported that allow assessing the multimodal impact on the VLM. To\ndemonstrate the relevance of this framework, we conduct a study on the\nrobustness of various Fine-Tuning (FT) methods across three medical datasets\nwith four types of distribution shifts. Our study highlights key insights into\nrobustness: 1) No FT method consistently outperforms others in robustness, and\n2) robustness trends are more stable across FT methods than across distribution\nshifts. Additionally, we find that simple sanity baselines that do not use the\nimage data can perform surprisingly well and confirm LoRA as the\nbest-performing FT method on in-distribution data.

                "summary": "Fairness--the absence of unjustified bias--is a core principle in the\ndevelopment of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems, yet it remains difficult\nto assess and enforce. Current approaches to fairness testing in large language\nmodels (LLMs) often rely on manual evaluation, fixed templates, deterministic\nheuristics, and curated datasets, making them resource-intensive and difficult\nto scale. This work aims to lay the groundwork for a novel, automated method\nfor testing fairness in LLMs, reducing the dependence on domain-specific\nresources and broadening the applicability of current approaches. Our approach,\nMeta-Fair, is based on two key ideas. First, we adopt metamorphic testing to\nuncover bias by examining how model outputs vary in response to controlled\nmodifications of input prompts, defined by metamorphic relations (MRs). Second,\nwe propose exploiting the potential of LLMs for both test case generation and\noutput evaluation, leveraging their capability to generate diverse inputs and\nclassify outputs effectively. The proposal is complemented by three open-source\ntools supporting LLM-driven generation, execution, and evaluation of test\ncases. We report the findings of several experiments involving 12 pre-trained\nLLMs, 14 MRs, 5 bias dimensions, and 7.9K automatically generated test cases.\nThe results show that Meta-Fair is effective in uncovering bias in LLMs,\nachieving an average precision of 92% and revealing biased behaviour in 29% of\nexecutions. Additionally, LLMs prove to be reliable and consistent evaluators,\nwith the best-performing models achieving F1-scores of up to 0.79. Although\nnon-determinism affects consistency, these effects can be mitigated through\ncareful MR design. While challenges remain to ensure broader applicability, the\nresults indicate a promising path towards an unprecedented level of automation\nin LLM testing.",

                    "value": "Fairness--the absence of unjustified bias--is a core principle in the\ndevelopment of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems, yet it remains difficult\nto assess and enforce. Current approaches to fairness testing in large language\nmodels (LLMs) often rely on manual evaluation, fixed templates, deterministic\nheuristics, and curated datasets, making them resource-intensive and difficult\nto scale. This work aims to lay the groundwork for a novel, automated method\nfor testing fairness in LLMs, reducing the dependence on domain-specific\nresources and broadening the applicability of current approaches. Our approach,\nMeta-Fair, is based on two key ideas. First, we adopt metamorphic testing to\nuncover bias by examining how model outputs vary in response to controlled\nmodifications of input prompts, defined by metamorphic relations (MRs). Second,\nwe propose exploiting the potential of LLMs for both test case generation and\noutput evaluation, leveraging their capability to generate diverse inputs and\nclassify outputs effectively. The proposal is complemented by three open-source\ntools supporting LLM-driven generation, execution, and evaluation of test\ncases. We report the findings of several experiments involving 12 pre-trained\nLLMs, 14 MRs, 5 bias dimensions, and 7.9K automatically generated test cases.\nThe results show that Meta-Fair is effective in uncovering bias in LLMs,\nachieving an average precision of 92% and revealing biased behaviour in 29% of\nexecutions. Additionally, LLMs prove to be reliable and consistent evaluators,\nwith the best-performing models achieving F1-scores of up to 0.79. Although\nnon-determinism affects consistency, these effects can be mitigated through\ncareful MR design. While challenges remain to ensure broader applicability, the\nresults indicate a promising path towards an unprecedented level of automation\nin LLM testing."

Numerous advanced\nworks based on LLMs have been proposed and applied in various scenarios. Among\nthem, video language models (VidLMs) are particularly widely used. However,\nexisting works primarily focus on terrestrial scenarios, overlooking the highly\ndemanding application needs of underwater observation.

                "summary": "The optimal management of a building's microclimate to satisfy the occupants'\nneeds and objectives in terms of comfort, energy efficiency, and costs is\nparticularly challenging. This complexity arises from the non-linear,\ntime-dependent interactions among all the variables of the control problem and\nthe changing internal and external constraints. Focusing on the accurate\nmodeling of the indoor temperature, we propose a data-driven approach to\naddress this challenge. We account for thermal inertia, non-linear effects,\nsmall perturbations of the indoor climate dynamics caused by ventilation and\nweather variations, as well as for the stochastic nature of the control system\ndue to the observed noise in the input signal. Since the prohibitive cost of\nquality data acquisition and processing limits the implementation of\ndata-driven approaches for real-life problems, we applied a method that merges\nseveral Bayesian machine learning and deep learning architectures that are\nsuitable for predicting complex system dynamics, while relaxing the dataset\nquality requirements.

                    "value": "The optimal management of a building's microclimate to satisfy the occupants'\nneeds and objectives in terms of comfort, energy efficiency, and costs is\nparticularly challenging. This complexity arises from the non-linear,\ntime-dependent interactions among all the variables of the control problem and\nthe changing internal and external constraints. Focusing on the accurate\nmodeling of the indoor temperature, we propose a data-driven approach to\naddress this challenge. We account for thermal inertia, non-linear effects,\nsmall perturbations of the indoor climate dynamics caused by ventilation and\nweather variations, as well as for the stochastic nature of the control system\ndue to the observed noise in the input signal. Since the prohibitive cost of\nquality data acquisition and processing limits the implementation of\ndata-driven approaches for real-life problems, we applied a method that merges\nseveral Bayesian machine learning and deep learning architectures that are\nsuitable for predicting complex system dynamics, while relaxing the dataset\nquality requirements.

These methods directly optimize the\nmodel parameters, so they cannot be used in test-time to improve model\nperformance, nor are they applicable when the model weights are not accessible.\nIn contrast, test-time methods sidestep weight updates by leveraging reward\nfunctions to guide and improve output quality. However, they incur high\ninference costs, and their one-shot guidance is often based on imperfect reward\nor value functions, leading to suboptimal outputs. In this work, we present a\nmethod named Iterative Reweight-then-Optimize (IRO), a reinforcement learning\n(RL) framework that performs RL-style alignment of the (frozen) base model\nwithout touching its parameters. During training, each iteration (i) samples\ncandidates from the base model, (ii) resamples using current value functions,\nand (iii) trains a new lightweight value function that guides the next decoding\npass. At test time, the value functions are used to guide the base model\ngeneration via a search-based optimization process. Notably, users can apply\nIRO to align a model on their own dataset, similar to OpenAI's reinforcement\nfine-tuning (RFT), but without requiring access to the model weights.",

However, they incur high\ninference costs, and their one-shot guidance is often based on imperfect reward\nor value functions, leading to suboptimal outputs. In this work, we present a\nmethod named Iterative Reweight-then-Optimize (IRO), a reinforcement learning\n(RL) framework that performs RL-style alignment of the (frozen) base model\nwithout touching its parameters. During training, each iteration (i) samples\ncandidates from the base model, (ii) resamples using current value functions,\nand (iii) trains a new lightweight value function that guides the next decoding\npass. At test time, the value functions are used to guide the base model\ngeneration via a search-based optimization process. Notably, users can apply\nIRO to align a model on their own dataset, similar to OpenAI's reinforcement\nfine-tuning (RFT), but without requiring access to the model weights."
