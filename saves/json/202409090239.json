However, FHE is\noften hindered by significant performance overhead, particularly for\nhigh-precision and complex data like images. Due to serious efficiency issues,\ntraditional FHE methods often encrypt images by monolithic data blocks (such as\npixel rows), instead of pixels. However, this strategy compromises the\nadvantages of homomorphic operations and disables pixel-level image processing.\nIn this study, we address these challenges by proposing and implementing a\npixel-level homomorphic encryption approach, iCHEETAH, based on the CKKS\nscheme. To enhance computational efficiency, we introduce three novel caching\nmechanisms to pre-encrypt radix values or frequently occurring pixel values,\nsubstantially reducing redundant encryption operations. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that our approach achieves up to a 19-fold improvement in\nencryption speed compared to the original CKKS, while maintaining high image\nquality. Additionally, real-world image applications such as mean filtering,\nbrightness enhancement, image matching and watermarking are tested based on\nFHE, showcasing up to a 91.53% speed improvement. We also proved that our\nmethod is IND-CPA (Indistinguishability under Chosen Plaintext Attack) secure,\nproviding strong encryption security. These results underscore the practicality\nand efficiency of iCHEETAH, marking a significant advancement in\nprivacy-preserving image processing at scale.",

To enhance computational efficiency, we introduce three novel caching\nmechanisms to pre-encrypt radix values or frequently occurring pixel values,\nsubstantially reducing redundant encryption operations. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that our approach achieves up to a 19-fold improvement in\nencryption speed compared to the original CKKS, while maintaining high image\nquality. Additionally, real-world image applications such as mean filtering,\nbrightness enhancement, image matching and watermarking are tested based on\nFHE, showcasing up to a 91.53% speed improvement. We also proved that our\nmethod is IND-CPA (Indistinguishability under Chosen Plaintext Attack) secure,\nproviding strong encryption security. These results underscore the practicality\nand efficiency of iCHEETAH, marking a significant advancement in\nprivacy-preserving image processing at scale."

The\nchanges in the orbital period of the close binary were analyzed based on 262\nnew times of light maximum together with those compiled from the literature.

Therefore, the cyclic variation was plausibly\nexplained as the light-travel time effect via the presence of a tertiary\ncomponent, which is supported by the periodic changes of the O-C curve and the\nrather symmetric and stable light curves obtained by TESS. The mass of the\ntertiary companion is determined to be M_3sini' = 0.060(7) M_sun. If the third\nbody is coplanar with the central binary (i.e., i' = 62.5{\\deg}), the mass of\nthe tertiary component is computed as M_3 ~ 0.068 M\\sun, and thus it would be\nbelow the stable hydrogen-burning limit and is a brown dwarf.

Previous work in computational neuroscience has considered this\nfunctional integration of discrete and continuous variables during\ndecision-making under the formalism of active inference (Parr, Friston & de\nVries, 2017; Parr & Friston, 2018). However, their focus is on the expressive\nphysical implementation of categorical decisions and the hierarchical mixed\ngenerative model is assumed to be known. As a consequence, it is unclear how\nthis framework might be extended to learning. We therefore present a novel\nhierarchical hybrid active inference agent in which a high-level discrete\nactive inference planner sits above a low-level continuous active inference\ncontroller. We make use of recent work in recurrent switching linear dynamical\nsystems (rSLDS) which implement end-to-end learning of meaningful discrete\nrepresentations via the piecewise linear decomposition of complex continuous\ndynamics (Linderman et al., 2016). The representations learned by the rSLDS\ninform the structure of the hybrid decision-making agent and allow us to (1)\nspecify temporally-abstracted sub-goals in a method reminiscent of the options\nframework, (2) lift the exploration into discrete space allowing us to exploit\ninformation-theoretic exploration bonuses and (3) `cache' the approximate\nsolutions to low-level problems in the discrete planner.

We also design a GPU-accelerated out-of-core\nmulti-resolution volume visualization framework that directly utilizes the\nAdaptive-FAM representation to generate high-quality rendering with interactive\nresponsiveness. Our method can not only dramatically decrease the caching time,\none of the main contributors to input latency, but also effectively improve the\ncache hit rate through prefetching. Our approach significantly outperforms the\ntraditional function approximation method in terms of input latency while\nmaintaining comparable rendering quality."

MagicDec first identifies the\nbottleneck shifts with increasing batch size and sequence length, and uses\nthese insights to deploy speculative decoding more effectively for high\nthroughput inference. Then, it leverages draft models with sparse KV cache to\naddress the KV bottleneck that scales with both sequence length and batch size.\nThis finding underscores the broad applicability of speculative decoding in\nlong-context serving, as it can enhance throughput and reduce latency without\ncompromising accuracy.

The refractory power of this lens, and consequently\nthe field at the sample surface, can be modified by adjusting the potentials of\nthe annular electrodes. The imaging properties and aberrations of this gap lens\nhave been investigated with regard to momentum imaging and XPEEM. The study\nencompasses the energy range from the few-eV level for laser-ARPES to 6 keV,\nfor hard X-ray ARPES.

Besides, We find that many writes are duplicate, and the duplication\ncan be inter-dup and intra-dup. While inter-dup means different memory blocks\nare identical, and intra-dup means all the 4B elements in a line are the same.\nIn this work, we propose a cache-assisted GPU memory deduplication architecture\nnamed CMD to reduce the off-chip accesses via utilizing the data duplication in\nGPU applications. CMD includes three key design contributions which aim to\nreduce the three kinds of accesses: (1) A novel GPU memory deduplication\narchitecture that removes the inter-dup and inter-dup lines. As for the\ninter-dup detection, we reduce the extra read requests caused by the\ntraditional read-verify hash process. Besides, we design several techniques to\nmanage duplicate blocks. (2) We propose a cache-assisted read scheme to reduce\nthe reads to duplicate data. When an L2 cache miss wants to read the duplicate\nblock, if the reference block has been fetched to L2 and it is clean, we can\ncopy it to the L2 missed block without accessing off-chip DRAM. As for the\nreads to intra-dup data, CMD uses the on-chip metadata cache to get the data.\n(3) When a cache line is evicted, the clean sectors in the line are invalidated\nwhile the dirty sectors are written back. However, most read-only victims are\nre-referenced from DRAM more than twice. Therefore, we add a full-associate\nFIFO to accommodate the read-only (it is also clean) victims to reduce the\nre-reference counts. Experiments show that CMD can decrease the off-chip\naccesses by 31.01%, reduce the energy by 32.78% and improve performance by\n37.79%.

Our revisiting of\ncurrent eviction methods reveals that they fundamentally minimize an upper\nbound of the $L_1$ eviction loss between the pre- and post-eviction outputs of\nmulti-head self-attention mechanisms. Moreover, our analysis indicates that the\ncommon practices of uniformly assigning budgets across attention heads harm\ntheir post-eviction generation quality. In light of these findings, we propose\na simple yet effective adaptive budget allocation algorithm. This algorithm not\nonly optimizes the theoretical loss upper bound but also reduces the $L_1$\neviction loss in practice by aligning with the varied characteristics across\ndifferent heads. By integrating this algorithm into two state-of-the-art\nmethods, we demonstrate the effectiveness of using adaptive budget allocation\nto optimize KV cache eviction.

However, the security implications of adopting such RAG-based\nsystems are unclear.\n  In this paper, we introduce ConfusedPilot, a class of security\nvulnerabilities of RAG systems that confuse Copilot and cause integrity and\nconfidentiality violations in its responses. First, we investigate a\nvulnerability that embeds malicious text in the modified prompt in RAG,\ncorrupting the responses generated by the LLM. Second, we demonstrate a\nvulnerability that leaks secret data, which leverages the caching mechanism\nduring retrieval. Third, we investigate how both vulnerabilities can be\nexploited to propagate misinformation within the enterprise and ultimately\nimpact its operations, such as sales and manufacturing. We also discuss the\nroot cause of these attacks by investigating the architecture of a RAG-based\nsystem. This study highlights the security vulnerabilities in today's RAG-based\nsystems and proposes design guidelines to secure future RAG-based systems.",

We observe a decrease in the cache miss rate ranging from 0.32% to\n6.14%, leading to a substantial 16.23% to 39.14% reduction in the average SSD\naccess latency. Furthermore, when compared to the state-of-the-art Long\nShort-Term Memory (LSTM)-based cache policies, our GMM algorithm on FPGA\nshowcases an impressive latency reduction of over 10,000 times.

Further, it enables a communication-efficient SP inference framework.\nTrace-driven experiments demonstrate that ZeroC achieves up to 80% lower\naverage JCT, 35% lower average perplexity, and 2.8x higher throughput with the\nsame latency compared to state-of-the-art compression methods. ZeroC also\nreduces the average JCT of current LLM serving systems by up to 91% with the\nconstraint of 0.1 perplexity increase. We open-sourced the code."

In this paper, we present NVPC, a transparent acceleration to\nexisting kernel file systems with an NVM-enhanced page cache. The acceleration\nlies in two aspects, respectively matching the desperate needs of existing disk\nfile systems: sync writes and cache-missed operations. Besides, the fast DRAM\npage cache is preserved for cache-hit operations. For sync writes, a\nhigh-performance log-based sync absorbing area is provided to redirect data\ndestination from the slow disk to the fast NVM. Meanwhile, the byte-addressable\nfeature of NVM is used to prevent write amplification. For cache-missed\noperations, NVPC makes use of the idle space on NVM to extend the DRAM page\ncache, so that more and larger workloads can fit into the cache. NVPC is\nentirely implemented as a page cache, thus can provide efficient speed-up to\ndisk file systems with full transparency to users and full compatibility to\nlower file systems.\n  In Filebench macro-benchmarks, NVPC achieves at most 3.55x, 2.84x, and 2.64x\nfaster than NOVA, Ext-4, and SPFS.

However, key-value (KV) cache, which is stored to avoid\nre-computation, has emerged as a critical bottleneck by growing linearly in\nsize with the sequence length. Due to the auto-regressive nature of LLMs, the\nentire KV cache will be loaded for every generated token, resulting in low\nutilization of computational cores and high latency. While various compression\nmethods for KV cache have been proposed to alleviate this issue, they suffer\nfrom degradation in generation quality.

This\napproach leverages the original model weights and dynamic sparse KV cache via\nretrieval as a draft model, which serves as an intermediate layer in the\nhierarchy and is further speculated by a smaller model to reduce its drafting\nlatency. TriForce not only facilitates impressive speedups for Llama2-7B-128K,\nachieving up to 2.31$\\times$ on an A100 GPU but also showcases scalability in\nhandling even longer contexts. For the offloading setting on two RTX 4090 GPUs,\nTriForce achieves 0.108s/token$\\unicode{x2014}$only half as slow as the\nauto-regressive baseline on an A100, which attains 7.78$\\times$ on our\noptimized offloading system.

For the offloading setting on two RTX 4090 GPUs,\nTriForce achieves 0.108s/token$\\unicode{x2014}$only half as slow as the\nauto-regressive baseline on an A100, which attains 7.78$\\times$ on our\noptimized offloading system. Additionally, TriForce performs 4.86$\\times$ than\nDeepSpeed-Zero-Inference on a single RTX 4090 GPU. TriForce's robustness is\nhighlighted by its consistently outstanding performance across various\ntemperatures. The code is available at\nhttps://github.com/Infini-AI-Lab/TriForce."

However, searching such an index has\nresulted in significant I/O traffic due to limited access locality and\ninefficient cache utilization. At the heart of index searching is the operation\nof filtering through vast data spans to isolate a small, relevant subset, which\ninvolves basic equality tests rather than the complex arithmetic provided by\nmodern CPUs. This paper introduces the Search-in-Memory (SiM) chip, which\ndemonstrates the feasibility of performing data filtering directly within a\nNAND flash memory chip, transmitting only relevant search results rather than\ncomplete pages. Instead of adding complex circuits, we propose repurposing\nexisting circuitry for efficient and accurate bitwise parallel matching. We\ndemonstrate how different data structures can use our flexible SIMD command\ninterface to offload index searches. This strategy not only frees up the CPU\nfor more computationally demanding tasks, but it also optimizes DRAM usage for\nwrite buffering, significantly lowering energy consumption associated with I/O\ntransmission between the CPU and DRAM. Extensive testing across a wide range of\nworkloads reveals up to a 9X speedup in write-heavy workloads and up to 45%\nenergy savings due to reduced read and write I/O. Furthermore, we achieve\nsignificant reductions in median and tail read latencies of up to 89% and 85%\nrespectively.",

Moreover, reflection is\nachieved through a memory mechanism, where past experiences are stored and can\nbe retrieved with current perception for effective decision argumentation.\nPlanning uses reflection results to produce long-term plans, which can avoid\nshort-sighted decisions in long-range navigation. We show the designed workflow\nsignificantly improves navigation ability of the LLM agent compared with the\nstate-of-the-art baselines."

Prior work has shown that\nthe implicit reward model of DPO (denoted as DPORM) can approximate an EXRM in\nthe limit. DPORM's effectiveness directly implies the optimality of the learned\npolicy, and also has practical implication for LLM alignment methods including\niterative DPO. However, it is unclear how well DPORM empirically matches the\nperformance of EXRM. This work studies the accuracy at distinguishing preferred\nand rejected answers for both DPORM and EXRM. Our findings indicate that even\nthough DPORM fits the training dataset comparably, it generalizes less\neffectively than EXRM, especially when the validation datasets contain\ndistribution shifts. Across five out-of-distribution settings, DPORM has a mean\ndrop in accuracy of 3% and a maximum drop of 7%. These findings highlight that\nDPORM has limited generalization ability and substantiates the integration of\nan explicit reward model in iterative DPO approaches.",

However, we notice that current IFs struggle to\naccurately estimate the influence of tokens with large gradient norms,\npotentially overestimating their influence.

Importantly, our DKDM is orthogonal to most\nexisting acceleration methods, such as denoising step reduction, quantization\nand pruning. Experiments show that our DKDM is capable of deriving 2x faster\nDMs with performance remaining on par with the baseline. Notably, our DKDM\nenables pretrained DMs to function as \"datasets\" for training new DMs."

Additional constraints, including host environment and the\npulsation of its progenitor RSG, suggest a massive progenitor with $M_{\\rm\nZAMS}$ > 17 $M_{\\rm \\odot}$. However, the analysis of the properties of\nsupernova, from light curve modeling to late phase spectroscopy, favor a\nrelatively low mass scenario ($M_{\\rm ZAMS}$ < 15 $M_{\\rm \\odot}$). In this\nwork, we conduct systematic analysis of SN 2023ixf, from the RSG progenitor,\nplateau phase light curve to late phase spectroscopy. Using MESA+STELLA to\nsimulate the RSG progenitor and their explosions, we find that, despite the\nZAMS mass of the RSG models being varied from 12.0 to 17.5 $M_{\\rm \\odot}$,\nthey can produce light curves that well match with SN 2023ixf if the envelope\nmass and the explosion energy are allowed to vary.

By incorporating the velocity\nstructure derived from the light curve modeling into an axisymmetric model, we\nsuccessfully generated [O I] line profiles that are consistent with the [O I]\nline observed in late phase spectroscopy of SN 2023ixf.

In the\nfirst, distributed knowledge is determined by any group member who can\nreplicate all the inferences that anyone else in the group makes. This result\nis in line with the extant literature. In the second case, no member can\nreplicate all the inferences that are made within the group. As a result,\ndistributed knowledge is determined by any two group members who can jointly\nreplicate what anyone else infers. This case can be interpreted as a form of\nwisdom of crowd effect and shows that, contrary to what is generally believed,\ndistributed knowledge cannot always be reduced to the reasoning abilities of a\nsingle group member.",

Since reasoning abilities can be heterogeneous, inference\nmaking turns out to be order dependent. We show that there are two\nqualitatively different cases of how distributed knowledge is attained. In the\nfirst, distributed knowledge is determined by any group member who can\nreplicate all the inferences that anyone else in the group makes. This result\nis in line with the extant literature. In the second case, no member can\nreplicate all the inferences that are made within the group. As a result,\ndistributed knowledge is determined by any two group members who can jointly\nreplicate what anyone else infers. This case can be interpreted as a form of\nwisdom of crowd effect and shows that, contrary to what is generally believed,\ndistributed knowledge cannot always be reduced to the reasoning abilities of a\nsingle group member."

However, LLMs often struggle with the nuances and style required\nfor organisation-specific translation. In this study, we explore the\neffectiveness of fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly Llama 3\n8B Instruct, leveraging translation memories (TMs), as a valuable resource to\nenhance accuracy and efficiency. We investigate the impact of fine-tuning the\nLlama 3 model using TMs from a specific organisation in the software sector.\nOur experiments cover five translation directions across languages of varying\nresource levels (English to Brazilian Portuguese, Czech, German, Finnish, and\nKorean). We analyse diverse sizes of training datasets (1k to 207k segments) to\nevaluate their influence on translation quality. We fine-tune separate models\nfor each training set and evaluate their performance based on automatic\nmetrics, BLEU, chrF++, TER, and COMET. Our findings reveal improvement in\ntranslation performance with larger datasets across all metrics. On average,\nBLEU and COMET scores increase by 13 and 25 points, respectively, on the\nlargest training set against the baseline model. Notably, there is a\nperformance deterioration in comparison with the baseline model when\nfine-tuning on only 1k and 2k examples; however, we observe a substantial\nimprovement as the training dataset size increases. The study highlights the\npotential of integrating TMs with LLMs to create bespoke translation models\ntailored to the specific needs of businesses, thus enhancing translation\nquality and reducing turn-around times.

This paper\nproposes a novel and efficient neural network model called UV-Mamba for\naccurate boundary detection in high-resolution remote sensing images. UV-Mamba\nmitigates the memory loss problem in long sequence modeling, which arises in\nstate space model (SSM) with increasing image size, by incorporating deformable\nconvolutions (DCN). Its architecture utilizes an encoder-decoder framework,\nincludes an encoder with four deformable state space augmentation (DSSA) blocks\nfor efficient multi-level semantic extraction and a decoder to integrate the\nextracted semantic information. We conducted experiments on the Beijing and\nXi'an datasets, and the results show that UV-Mamba achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance. Specifically, our model achieves 73.3% and 78.1% IoU on the\nBeijing and Xi'an datasets, respectively, representing improvements of 1.2% and\n3.4% IoU over the previous best model, while also being 6x faster in inference\nspeed and 40x smaller in parameter count.

In this paper, we introduce LogicGame, a novel\nbenchmark designed to evaluate the comprehensive rule understanding, execution,\nand planning capabilities of LLMs. Unlike traditional benchmarks, LogicGame\nprovides diverse games that contain a series of rules with an initial state,\nrequiring models to comprehend and apply predefined regulations to solve\nproblems. We create simulated scenarios in which models execute or plan\noperations to achieve specific outcomes. These game scenarios are specifically\ndesigned to distinguish logical reasoning from mere knowledge by relying\nexclusively on predefined rules. This separation allows for a pure assessment\nof rule-based reasoning capabilities. The evaluation considers not only final\noutcomes but also intermediate steps, providing a comprehensive assessment of\nmodel performance. Moreover, these intermediate steps are deterministic and can\nbe automatically verified. LogicGame defines game scenarios with varying\ndifficulty levels, from simple rule applications to complex reasoning chains,\nin order to offer a precise evaluation of model performance on rule\nunderstanding and multi-step execution.

The modeling framework characterizes the longitudinal and\nfunctional structures while incorporating two-dimensional fixed effects for\ncovariates of interest. We also develop a fast three-stage estimation procedure\nto provide accurate fixed-effect inference for model interpretability and\nimprove computational efficiency when encountering large datasets. We find\nstrong evidence of intraday and interday varying significant associations\nbetween physical activity and mental health assessments among our cohort\npopulation, which shed light on possible intervention strategies targeting\ndaily physical activity patterns to improve school adolescent mental health.\nOur method is also used in environmental data to illustrate the wide\napplicability.

To\naddress this task, we introduce GreenPLM, which leverages more text data to\ncompensate for the lack of 3D data. First, inspired by using CLIP to align\nimages and text, we utilize a pre-trained point cloud-text encoder to map the\n3D point cloud space to the text space. This mapping leaves us to seamlessly\nconnect the text space with LLMs. Once the point-text-LLM connection is\nestablished, we further enhance text-LLM alignment by expanding the\nintermediate text space, thereby reducing the reliance on 3D point cloud data.\nSpecifically, we generate 6M free-text descriptions of 3D objects, and design a\nthree-stage training strategy to help LLMs better explore the intrinsic\nconnections between different modalities. To achieve efficient modality\nalignment, we design a zero-parameter cross-attention module for token pooling.\nExtensive experimental results show that GreenPLM requires only 12% of the 3D\ntraining data used by existing state-of-the-art models to achieve superior 3D\nunderstanding.

However,\ndespite their widespread adoption and success, CoT methods often exhibit\ninstability due to their inability to consistently ensure the quality of\ngenerated reasoning paths, leading to sub-optimal reasoning performance. To\naddress this challenge, we propose the \\textbf{Strategic Chain-of-Thought}\n(SCoT), a novel methodology designed to refine LLM performance by integrating\nstrategic knowledge prior to generating intermediate reasoning steps. SCoT\nemploys a two-stage approach within a single prompt: first eliciting an\neffective problem-solving strategy, which is then used to guide the generation\nof high-quality CoT paths and final answers. Our experiments across eight\nchallenging reasoning datasets demonstrate significant improvements, including\na 21.05\\% increase on the GSM8K dataset and 24.13\\% on the Tracking\\_Objects\ndataset, respectively, using the Llama3-8b model. Additionally, we extend the\nSCoT framework to develop a few-shot method with automatically matched\ndemonstrations, yielding even stronger results. These findings underscore the\nefficacy of SCoT, highlighting its potential to substantially enhance LLM\nperformance in complex reasoning tasks.",

To address this limitation, we\naim at a novel linear attention mechanism as an alternative in this paper.\nSpecifically, we begin our exploration from recently introduced models with\nlinear complexity, e.g., Mamba2, RWKV6, Gated Linear Attention, etc, and\nidentify two key features-attention normalization and non-causal inference-that\nenhance high-resolution visual generation performance. Building on these\ninsights, we introduce a generalized linear attention paradigm, which serves as\na low-rank approximation of a wide spectrum of popular linear token mixers. To\nsave the training cost and better leverage pre-trained models, we initialize\nour models and distill the knowledge from pre-trained StableDiffusion (SD). We\nfind that the distilled model, termed LinFusion, achieves performance on par\nwith or superior to the original SD after only modest training, while\nsignificantly reducing time and memory complexity. Extensive experiments on\nSD-v1.5, SD-v2.1, and SD-XL demonstrate that LinFusion delivers satisfactory\nzero-shot cross-resolution generation performance, generating high-resolution\nimages like 16K resolution. Moreover, it is highly compatible with pre-trained\nSD components, such as ControlNet and IP-Adapter, requiring no adaptation\nefforts. Codes are available at https://github.com/Huage001/LinFusion.",

To address this limitation, we\naim at a novel linear attention mechanism as an alternative in this paper.\nSpecifically, we begin our exploration from recently introduced models with\nlinear complexity, e.g., Mamba2, RWKV6, Gated Linear Attention, etc, and\nidentify two key features-attention normalization and non-causal inference-that\nenhance high-resolution visual generation performance. Building on these\ninsights, we introduce a generalized linear attention paradigm, which serves as\na low-rank approximation of a wide spectrum of popular linear token mixers. To\nsave the training cost and better leverage pre-trained models, we initialize\nour models and distill the knowledge from pre-trained StableDiffusion (SD). We\nfind that the distilled model, termed LinFusion, achieves performance on par\nwith or superior to the original SD after only modest training, while\nsignificantly reducing time and memory complexity. Extensive experiments on\nSD-v1.5, SD-v2.1, and SD-XL demonstrate that LinFusion delivers satisfactory\nzero-shot cross-resolution generation performance, generating high-resolution\nimages like 16K resolution. Moreover, it is highly compatible with pre-trained\nSD components, such as ControlNet and IP-Adapter, requiring no adaptation\nefforts. Codes are available at https://github.com/Huage001/LinFusion."

Closer examination reveals that content moderation is a\nconstitutive part of platform governance, the key of which is to gain and\nenhance legitimacy.

In this paper, we propose two strategies\nto enhance the model's capability in video understanding tasks by improving\ninter-layer attention computation in LLMs. Specifically, the first approach\nfocuses on the enhancement of Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) with\nTemporal-Aware Dual RoPE, which introduces temporal position information to\nstrengthen the MLLM's temporal modeling capabilities while preserving the\nrelative position relationships of both visual and text tokens. The second\napproach involves enhancing the Attention Mask with the Frame-wise Block Causal\nAttention Mask, a simple yet effective method that broadens visual token\ninteractions within and across video frames while maintaining the causal\ninference mechanism. Based on these proposed methods, we adapt LLaVA for video\nunderstanding tasks, naming it Temporal-Considered LLaVA (TC-LLaVA).

We posit that LLMs should 1) identify knowledge\nconflicts, 2) pinpoint conflicting information segments, and 3) provide\ndistinct answers or viewpoints in conflicting scenarios. To this end, we\nintroduce KNOWLEDGE CONFLICT, an evaluation framework for simulating contextual\nknowledge conflicts and quantitatively evaluating to what extent LLMs achieve\nthese goals. KNOWLEDGE CONFLICT includes diverse and complex situations of\nknowledge conflict, knowledge from diverse entities and domains, two synthetic\nconflict creation methods, and settings with progressively increasing\ndifficulty to reflect realistic knowledge conflicts. Extensive experiments with\nthe KNOWLEDGE CONFLICT framework reveal that while LLMs perform well in\nidentifying the existence of knowledge conflicts, they struggle to determine\nthe specific conflicting knowledge and produce a response with distinct answers\namidst conflicting information. To address these challenges, we propose new\ninstruction-based approaches that augment LLMs to better achieve the three\ngoals.

We also\nconduct experiments using the MaterialBENCH on LLMs, including ChatGPT-3.5,\nChatGPT-4, Bard (at the time of the experiments), and GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 with\nthe OpenAI API. The differences and similarities in the performance of LLMs\nmeasured by the MaterialBENCH are analyzed and discussed. Performance\ndifferences between the free-response type and multiple-choice type in the same\nmodels and the influence of using system massages on multiple-choice problems\nare also studied. We anticipate that MaterialBENCH will encourage further\ndevelopments of LLMs in reasoning abilities to solve more complicated problems\nand eventually contribute to materials research and discovery."

In this paper, we introduce a framework\ngrounded in group and symmetry principles, which have played a crucial role in\nfields such as physics and mathematics, and offer another way to evaluate their\ncapabilities.

This problem is very challenging,\nbecause it requires agent to establish self-position and acquire spatial\nrepresentation of complex urban environment, where landmarks are often\ninvisible. In the absence of navigation instructions, such abilities are vital\nfor the agent to make high-quality decisions in long-range city navigation.\nWith the emergent reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs), a tempting\nbaseline is to prompt LLMs to \"react\" on each observation and make decisions\naccordingly. However, this baseline has very poor performance that the agent\noften repeatedly visits same locations and make short-sighted, inconsistent\ndecisions. To address these issues, this paper introduces a novel agentic\nworkflow featured by its abilities to perceive, reflect and plan. Specifically,\nwe find LLaVA-7B can be fine-tuned to perceive the direction and distance of\nlandmarks with sufficient accuracy for city navigation. Moreover, reflection is\nachieved through a memory mechanism, where past experiences are stored and can\nbe retrieved with current perception for effective decision argumentation.\nPlanning uses reflection results to produce long-term plans, which can avoid\nshort-sighted decisions in long-range navigation.

MedS-Ins comprises 58\nmedically oriented language corpora, totaling 13.5 million samples across 122\ntasks. To demonstrate the dataset's utility, we conducted a proof-of-concept\nexperiment by performing instruction tuning on a lightweight, open-source\nmedical language model. The resulting model, MMedIns-Llama 3, significantly\noutperformed existing models across nearly all clinical tasks.

When tracing the most influential\nsamples, this leads to frequently tracing back to samples with large gradient\nnorm tokens, overshadowing the actual most influential samples even if their\ninfluences are well estimated. To address this issue, we propose Heuristically\nAdjusted IF (HAIF), which reduces the weight of tokens with large gradient\nnorms, thereby significantly improving the accuracy of tracing the most\ninfluential samples. To establish easily obtained groundtruth for tracing\nprivacy leakage, we construct two datasets, PII-E and PII-CR, representing two\ndistinct scenarios: one with identical text in the model outputs and\npre-training data, and the other where models leverage their reasoning\nabilities to generate text divergent from pre-training data. HAIF significantly\nimproves tracing accuracy, enhancing it by 20.96% to 73.71% on the PII-E\ndataset and 3.21% to 45.93% on the PII-CR dataset, compared to the best SOTA\nIFs against various GPT-2 and QWen-1.5 models. HAIF also outperforms SOTA IFs\non real-world pretraining data CLUECorpus2020, demonstrating strong robustness\nregardless prompt and response lengths.",

To do so, a\npossibility is to evaluate the considered LLM on a set of task instances and\ntrain an assessor to predict its performance based on features of the\ninstances. However, this approach requires evaluating each new LLM on a\nsufficiently large set of task instances to train an assessor specific to it.\nIn this work, we leverage the evaluation results of previously tested LLMs to\nreduce the number of evaluations required to predict the performance of a new\nLLM. In practice, we propose to test the new LLM on a small set of reference\ninstances and train a generic assessor which predicts the performance of the\nLLM on an instance based on the performance of the former on the reference set\nand features of the instance of interest. We conduct empirical studies on\nHELM-Lite and KindsOfReasoning, a collection of existing reasoning datasets\nthat we introduce, where we evaluate all instruction-fine-tuned OpenAI models\nuntil the January 2024 version of GPT4. When predicting performance on\ninstances with the same distribution as those used to train the generic\nassessor, we find this achieves performance comparable to the LLM-specific\nassessors trained on the full set of instances. Additionally, we find that\nrandomly selecting the reference instances performs as well as some advanced\nselection methods we tested. For out of distribution, however, no clear winner\nemerges and the overall performance is worse, suggesting that the inherent\npredictability of LLMs is low.",

However, this approach requires evaluating each new LLM on a\nsufficiently large set of task instances to train an assessor specific to it.\nIn this work, we leverage the evaluation results of previously tested LLMs to\nreduce the number of evaluations required to predict the performance of a new\nLLM. In practice, we propose to test the new LLM on a small set of reference\ninstances and train a generic assessor which predicts the performance of the\nLLM on an instance based on the performance of the former on the reference set\nand features of the instance of interest. We conduct empirical studies on\nHELM-Lite and KindsOfReasoning, a collection of existing reasoning datasets\nthat we introduce, where we evaluate all instruction-fine-tuned OpenAI models\nuntil the January 2024 version of GPT4. When predicting performance on\ninstances with the same distribution as those used to train the generic\nassessor, we find this achieves performance comparable to the LLM-specific\nassessors trained on the full set of instances. Additionally, we find that\nrandomly selecting the reference instances performs as well as some advanced\nselection methods we tested. For out of distribution, however, no clear winner\nemerges and the overall performance is worse, suggesting that the inherent\npredictability of LLMs is low."

We investigate the impact of fine-tuning the\nLlama 3 model using TMs from a specific organisation in the software sector.\nOur experiments cover five translation directions across languages of varying\nresource levels (English to Brazilian Portuguese, Czech, German, Finnish, and\nKorean). We analyse diverse sizes of training datasets (1k to 207k segments) to\nevaluate their influence on translation quality. We fine-tune separate models\nfor each training set and evaluate their performance based on automatic\nmetrics, BLEU, chrF++, TER, and COMET. Our findings reveal improvement in\ntranslation performance with larger datasets across all metrics. On average,\nBLEU and COMET scores increase by 13 and 25 points, respectively, on the\nlargest training set against the baseline model. Notably, there is a\nperformance deterioration in comparison with the baseline model when\nfine-tuning on only 1k and 2k examples; however, we observe a substantial\nimprovement as the training dataset size increases.

Given the popularity of\nLLMs, this review seeks to provide a comprehensive overview of those solutions\ndesigned specifically to generate and evaluate educational materials and which\ninvolve students and teachers in their design or experimental plan. To the best\nof our knowledge, this is the first review of educational applications (e.g.,\nstudent assessment) of LLMs. As expected, the most common role of these systems\nis as virtual tutors for automatic question generation. Moreover, the most\npopular models are GTP-3 and BERT. However, due to the continuous launch of new\ngenerative models, new works are expected to be published shortly."

To tackle this\nchallenge, we present a well-defined pipeline. Initially, we utilize ChatGPT to\ngenerate NL-GQL data pairs, leveraging the provided graph DB with\nself-instruction. Subsequently, we employ the generated data to fine-tune LLMs,\nensuring alignment between LLMs and the graph DB. Moreover, we find the\nimportance of relevant schema in efficiently generating accurate GQLs. Thus, we\nintroduce a method to extract relevant schema as the input context. We evaluate\nour method using two carefully constructed datasets derived from graph DBs in\nthe finance and medicine domains, named FinGQL and MediGQL. Experimental\nresults reveal that our approach significantly outperforms a set of baseline\nmethods, with improvements of 5.90 and 6.36 absolute points on EM, and 6.00 and\n7.09 absolute points on EX for FinGQL and MediGQL, respectively."

In contrast,\nhuman beings possess world model that enables them to simulate the future\nstates based on 3D internal visual representation and plan actions accordingly.\nTo this end, we propose OccLLaMA, an occupancy-language-action generative world\nmodel, which uses semantic occupancy as a general visual representation and\nunifies vision-language-action(VLA) modalities through an autoregressive model.\nSpecifically, we introduce a novel VQVAE-like scene tokenizer to efficiently\ndiscretize and reconstruct semantic occupancy scenes, considering its sparsity\nand classes imbalance. Then, we build a unified multi-modal vocabulary for\nvision, language and action. Furthermore, we enhance LLM, specifically LLaMA,\nto perform the next token/scene prediction on the unified vocabulary to\ncomplete multiple tasks in autonomous driving. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that OccLLaMA achieves competitive performance across multiple\ntasks, including 4D occupancy forecasting, motion planning, and visual question\nanswering, showcasing its potential as a foundation model in autonomous\ndriving.",

                "summary": "Autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have attracted\nsignificant research interest. However, the open-source community faces many\nchallenges in developing specialized models for agent tasks, driven by the\nscarcity of high-quality agent datasets and the absence of standard protocols\nin this area. We introduce and publicly release xLAM, a series of large action\nmodels designed for AI agent tasks. The xLAM series includes five models with\nboth dense and mixture-of-expert architectures, ranging from 1B to 8x22B\nparameters, trained using a scalable, flexible pipeline that unifies, augments,\nand synthesizes diverse datasets to enhance AI agents' generalizability and\nperformance across varied environments. Our experimental results demonstrate\nthat xLAM consistently delivers exceptional performance across multiple agent\nability benchmarks, notably securing the 1st position on the Berkeley\nFunction-Calling Leaderboard, outperforming GPT-4, Claude-3, and many other\nmodels in terms of tool use. By releasing the xLAM series, we aim to advance\nthe performance of open-source LLMs for autonomous AI agents, potentially\naccelerating progress and democratizing access to high-performance models for\nagent tasks.

                    "value": "Autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have attracted\nsignificant research interest. However, the open-source community faces many\nchallenges in developing specialized models for agent tasks, driven by the\nscarcity of high-quality agent datasets and the absence of standard protocols\nin this area. We introduce and publicly release xLAM, a series of large action\nmodels designed for AI agent tasks. The xLAM series includes five models with\nboth dense and mixture-of-expert architectures, ranging from 1B to 8x22B\nparameters, trained using a scalable, flexible pipeline that unifies, augments,\nand synthesizes diverse datasets to enhance AI agents' generalizability and\nperformance across varied environments. Our experimental results demonstrate\nthat xLAM consistently delivers exceptional performance across multiple agent\nability benchmarks, notably securing the 1st position on the Berkeley\nFunction-Calling Leaderboard, outperforming GPT-4, Claude-3, and many other\nmodels in terms of tool use. By releasing the xLAM series, we aim to advance\nthe performance of open-source LLMs for autonomous AI agents, potentially\naccelerating progress and democratizing access to high-performance models for\nagent tasks.

This approach ensures a\nbalance between consistency and diversity, avoiding the introduction of noise\nand augmenting crucial features of datasets. DiffusionCLS also comprises a\nNoise-Resistant Training objective to help the model generalize.

Therefore,\ncontrary to rephrasing less important context, we propose DiffusionCLS to\nleverage a diffusion LM to capture in-domain knowledge and generate pseudo\nsamples by reconstructing strong label-related tokens. This approach ensures a\nbalance between consistency and diversity, avoiding the introduction of noise\nand augmenting crucial features of datasets. DiffusionCLS also comprises a\nNoise-Resistant Training objective to help the model generalize. Experiments\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our method in various low-resource scenarios\nincluding domain-specific and domain-general problems. Ablation studies confirm\nthe effectiveness of our framework's modules, and visualization studies\nhighlight optimal deployment conditions, reinforcing our conclusions."

Traditional survival prediction models, relying on\nstructured data, often lack precision. This study explores the potential of\nlarge language models (LLMs) to structure unstructured electronic health record\n(EHR) data, thereby improving survival prediction accuracy through\ncomprehensive clinical information integration. Data from 34,276 patients\ntreated with RT at Yonsei Cancer Center between 2013 and 2023 were analyzed,\nencompassing both structured and unstructured data. An open-source LLM was used\nto structure the unstructured EHR data via single-shot learning, with its\nperformance compared against a domain-specific medical LLM and a smaller\nvariant. Survival prediction models were developed using statistical, machine\nlearning, and deep learning approaches, incorporating both structured and\nLLM-structured data. Clinical experts evaluated the accuracy of the\nLLM-structured data. The open-source LLM achieved 87.5% accuracy in structuring\nunstructured EHR data without additional training, significantly outperforming\nthe domain-specific medical LLM, which reached only 35.8% accuracy. Larger LLMs\nwere more effective, particularly in extracting clinically relevant features\nlike general condition and disease extent, which closely correlated with\npatient survival. Incorporating LLM-structured clinical features into survival\nprediction models significantly improved accuracy, with the C-index of deep\nlearning models increasing from 0.737 to 0.820. These models also became more\ninterpretable by emphasizing clinically significant factors. This study shows\nthat general-domain LLMs, even without specific medical training, can\neffectively structure large-scale unstructured EHR data, substantially\nenhancing the accuracy and interpretability of clinical predictive models.",

                "summary": "Implementing automated unit tests is an important but time consuming activity\nin software development. Developers dedicate substantial time to writing tests\nfor validating an application and preventing regressions. To support developers\nin this task, software engineering research over the past few decades has\ndeveloped many techniques for automating unit test generation. However, despite\nthis effort, usable tools exist for very few programming languages -- mainly\nJava, C, and C# and, more recently, for Python. Moreover, studies have found\nthat automatically generated tests suffer poor readability and often do not\nresemble developer-written tests. In this work, we present a rigorous\ninvestigation of how large language models (LLMs) can help bridge the gap.

However, despite\nthis effort, usable tools exist for very few programming languages -- mainly\nJava, C, and C# and, more recently, for Python.

To\nevaluate the performance of LLMs tool-use under imperfect instructions, we\nmeticulously examine the real-world instructions queried from users, analyze\nthe error patterns, and build a challenging tool-use benchmark called Noisy\nToolBench (NoisyToolBench). We find that due to the next-token prediction\ntraining objective, LLMs tend to arbitrarily generate the missed argument,\nwhich may lead to hallucinations and risks. To address this issue, we propose a\nnovel framework, Ask-when-Needed (AwN), which prompts LLMs to ask questions to\nusers whenever they encounter obstacles due to unclear instructions. Moreover,\nto reduce the manual labor involved in user-LLM interaction and assess LLMs\nperformance in tool utilization from both accuracy and efficiency perspectives,\nwe design an automated evaluation tool named ToolEvaluator.

This paper explores the transformative potential of\nlarge language models (LLMs) and emerging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\ntechnologies in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), paving the way for\ninnovative solutions to address critical challenges in urban mobility. We begin\nby providing a comprehensive overview of the current state-of-the-art in\nmobility data, ITS, and Connected Vehicles (CV) applications. Building on this\nreview, we discuss the rationale behind RAG and examine the opportunities for\nintegrating these Generative AI (GenAI) technologies into the smart mobility\nsector. We propose a conceptual framework aimed at developing multi-agent\nsystems capable of intelligently and conversationally delivering smart mobility\nservices to urban commuters, transportation operators, and decision-makers. Our\napproach seeks to foster an autonomous and intelligent approach that (a)\npromotes science-based advisory to reduce traffic congestion, accidents, and\ncarbon emissions at multiple scales, (b) facilitates public education and\nengagement in participatory mobility management, and (c) automates specialized\ntransportation management tasks and the development of critical ITS platforms,\nsuch as data analytics and interpretation, knowledge representation, and\ntraffic simulations. By integrating LLM and RAG, our approach seeks to overcome\nthe limitations of traditional rule-based multi-agent systems, which rely on\nfixed knowledge bases and limited reasoning capabilities. This integration\npaves the way for a more scalable, intuitive, and automated multi-agent\nparadigm, driving advancements in ITS and urban mobility.",

We begin\nby providing a comprehensive overview of the current state-of-the-art in\nmobility data, ITS, and Connected Vehicles (CV) applications. Building on this\nreview, we discuss the rationale behind RAG and examine the opportunities for\nintegrating these Generative AI (GenAI) technologies into the smart mobility\nsector. We propose a conceptual framework aimed at developing multi-agent\nsystems capable of intelligently and conversationally delivering smart mobility\nservices to urban commuters, transportation operators, and decision-makers. Our\napproach seeks to foster an autonomous and intelligent approach that (a)\npromotes science-based advisory to reduce traffic congestion, accidents, and\ncarbon emissions at multiple scales, (b) facilitates public education and\nengagement in participatory mobility management, and (c) automates specialized\ntransportation management tasks and the development of critical ITS platforms,\nsuch as data analytics and interpretation, knowledge representation, and\ntraffic simulations. By integrating LLM and RAG, our approach seeks to overcome\nthe limitations of traditional rule-based multi-agent systems, which rely on\nfixed knowledge bases and limited reasoning capabilities. This integration\npaves the way for a more scalable, intuitive, and automated multi-agent\nparadigm, driving advancements in ITS and urban mobility."

This is particularly concerning in settings such as drug safety,\nwhere inaccuracies could lead to patient harm. To mitigate these risks, we have\ndeveloped and demonstrated a proof of concept suite of guardrails specifically\ndesigned to mitigate certain types of hallucinations and errors for drug\nsafety, and potentially applicable to other medical safety-critical contexts.\nThese guardrails include mechanisms to detect anomalous documents to prevent\nthe ingestion of inappropriate data, identify incorrect drug names or adverse\nevent terms, and convey uncertainty in generated content. We integrated these\nguardrails with an LLM fine-tuned for a text-to-text task, which involves\nconverting both structured and unstructured data within adverse event reports\ninto natural language. This method was applied to translate individual case\nsafety reports, demonstrating effective application in a pharmacovigilance\nprocessing task. Our guardrail framework offers a set of tools with broad\napplicability across various domains, ensuring LLMs can be safely used in\nhigh-risk situations by eliminating the occurrence of key errors, including the\ngeneration of incorrect pharmacovigilance-related terms, thus adhering to\nstringent regulatory and quality standards in medical safety-critical\nenvironments.",

To mitigate these risks, we have\ndeveloped and demonstrated a proof of concept suite of guardrails specifically\ndesigned to mitigate certain types of hallucinations and errors for drug\nsafety, and potentially applicable to other medical safety-critical contexts.\nThese guardrails include mechanisms to detect anomalous documents to prevent\nthe ingestion of inappropriate data, identify incorrect drug names or adverse\nevent terms, and convey uncertainty in generated content. We integrated these\nguardrails with an LLM fine-tuned for a text-to-text task, which involves\nconverting both structured and unstructured data within adverse event reports\ninto natural language. This method was applied to translate individual case\nsafety reports, demonstrating effective application in a pharmacovigilance\nprocessing task. Our guardrail framework offers a set of tools with broad\napplicability across various domains, ensuring LLMs can be safely used in\nhigh-risk situations by eliminating the occurrence of key errors, including the\ngeneration of incorrect pharmacovigilance-related terms, thus adhering to\nstringent regulatory and quality standards in medical safety-critical\nenvironments."

This enhancement was consistent across low, medium, and high\ncomplexity queries, indicating the critical role of contextual knowledge in\nquery generation.\n  Discussion: The integration of a business context document markedly improved\nthe LLM's ability to generate accurate and contextually relevant SQL queries.\nPerformance achieved a maximum of 85\\% when high complexity queries are\nexcluded, suggesting promise for routine deployment.\n  Conclusion: This study presents a novel approach to employing LLMs for safety\ndata retrieval and analysis, demonstrating significant advancements in query\ngeneration accuracy.

The\nfirst step in prosecuting phone abuse is traceback -- identifying the call\noriginator. This fundamental investigative task currently requires hours of\nmanual effort per call. In this paper, we introduce J\\\"ager, a distributed\nsecure call traceback system. J\\\"ager can trace a call in a few seconds, even\nwith partial deployment, while cryptographically preserving the privacy of call\nparties, carrier trade secrets like peers and call volume, and limiting the\nthreat of bulk analysis. We establish definitions and requirements of secure\ntraceback, then develop a suite of protocols that meet these requirements using\nwitness encryption, oblivious pseudorandom functions, and group signatures. We\nprove these protocols secure in the universal composibility framework. We then\ndemonstrate that J\\\"ager has low compute and bandwidth costs per call, and\nthese costs scale linearly with call volume. J\\\"ager provides an efficient,\nsecure, privacy-preserving system to revolutionize telephone abuse\ninvestigation with minimal costs to operators.",
