This paper introduces Step-3, a\n321B-parameter VLM with hardware-aware model-system co-design optimized for\nminimizing decoding costs. Step-3 innovates in two key dimensions: (1) A novel\nMulti-Matrix Factorization Attention (MFA) mechanism that significantly reduces\nboth KV cache size and computation while maintaining high attention\nexpressiveness, and (2) Attention-FFN Disaggregation (AFD), a distributed\ninference system that decouples attention and Feed-Forward Network (FFN) layers\ninto specialized subsystems. This co-design achieves unprecedented cost\nefficiency: Step-3 significantly reduces theoretical decoding costs compared\nwith models like DeepSeek-V3 and Qwen3 MoE 235B, with the gains widening at\nlonger context. Step-3 achieves low cost while activating 38B parameters per\ntoken (more than DeepSeek-V3 and Qwen3 MoE 235B), demonstrating that\nhardware-aligned attention arithmetic intensity, MoE sparsity, and AFD are\ncritical to cost-effectiveness. We perform a head-to-head comparison with\nDeepSeek-V3 in its favorable scenarios. Our implementation on Hopper GPUs\nachieves a decoding throughput of up to 4,039 tokens per second per GPU under\n50ms TPOT SLA (4K context, FP8, no MTP). It is higher than DeepSeek-V3's 2,324\nin the same setup and sets a new Pareto frontier for LLM decoding.",

We also prove that optimizing parallelization and memory management\nseparately, as done in many applications, can result in a solution that is a\nlinear factor away from the optimum.\n  On the algorithmic side, we discuss a natural technique to represent and\nsolve the problem as an Integer Linear Program (ILP). We develop a holistic\nscheduling algorithm based on this approach, and we experimentally study its\nperformance and properties on a small benchmark of computational tasks. Our\nresults confirm that the ILP-based method can indeed find considerably better\nsolutions than a baseline which combines classical scheduling algorithms and\nmemory management policies.",

Privacy-preserving ML\n(PPML) based on cryptographic primitives has emerged as a promising solution in\nwhich an ML model is directly computed on the encrypted data to provide a\nformal privacy guarantee. However, PPML frameworks heavily rely on the\noblivious transfer (OT) primitive to compute nonlinear functions. OT mainly\ninvolves the computation of single-point correlated OT (SPCOT) and learning\nparity with noise (LPN) operations. As OT is still computed extensively on\ngeneral-purpose CPUs, it becomes the latency bottleneck of modern PPML\nframeworks.\n  In this paper, we propose a novel OT accelerator, dubbed Ironman, to\nsignificantly increase the efficiency of OT and the overall PPML framework. We\nobserve that SPCOT is computation-bounded, and thus propose a hardware-friendly\nSPCOT algorithm with a customized accelerator to improve SPCOT computation\nthroughput. In contrast, LPN is memory-bandwidth-bounded due to irregular\nmemory access patterns. Hence, we further leverage the near-memory processing\n(NMP) architecture equipped with memory-side cache and index sorting to improve\neffective memory bandwidth.

GTA comprises two components: (1) a shared attention map mechanism\nthat reuses attention scores across multiple heads, decreasing the key cache\nsize; and (2) a nonlinear value decoder with learned projections that\ncompresses the value cache into a latent space, further cutting memory needs.\nGTA cuts attention computation FLOPs by up to \\emph{62.5\\%} versus\nGrouped-Query Attention and shrink the KV cache by up to \\emph{70\\%}, all while\navoiding the extra overhead of Multi-Head Latent Attention to improve LLM\ndeployment efficiency. Consequently, GTA models achieve a \\emph{2x} increase in\nend-to-end inference speed, with prefill benefiting from reduced computational\ncost and decoding benefiting from the smaller cache footprint."

First, it performs online sparsification during the\nprefilling phase by dynamically selecting the most important parts of the\nattention matrix for each new input.

Many studies have attempted to use\ncaching to reduce the time consumption of sampling. Existing caching methods\naccelerate generation by reusing DiT features from the previous time step and\nskipping calculations in the next, but they tend to locate and cache low-error\nmodules without focusing on reducing caching-induced errors, resulting in a\nsharp decline in generated content quality when increasing caching intensity.\nTo solve this problem, we propose the \\textbf{E}rror-\\textbf{O}ptimized\n\\textbf{C}ache (\\textbf{EOC}). This method introduces three key improvements:\n\\textbf{(1)} Prior knowledge extraction: Extract and process the caching\ndifferences; \\textbf{(2)} A judgment method for cache optimization: Determine\nwhether certain caching steps need to be optimized; \\textbf{(3)} Cache\noptimization: reduce caching errors.

We apply PINT to the ERA5\nWeatherBench dataset, focusing on long-term forecasting of 2m-temperature data.\nPINT incorporates the Simple Harmonic Oscillator Equation as a physics-informed\nprior, embedding its periodic dynamics into RNN, LSTM, and GRU architectures.\nThis equation's analytical solutions (sine and cosine functions) facilitate\nrigorous evaluation of the benefits of incorporating physics-informed\nconstraints. By benchmarking against a linear regression baseline derived from\nits exact solutions, we quantify the impact of embedding physical principles in\ndata-driven models. Unlike traditional time series models that rely on future\nobservations, PINT is designed for practical forecasting. Using only the first\n90 days of observed data, it iteratively predicts the next two years,\naddressing challenges posed by limited real-time updates. Experiments on the\nWeatherBench dataset demonstrate PINT's ability to generalize, capture periodic\ntrends, and align with physical principles. This study highlights the potential\nof physics-informed neural models in bridging machine learning and\ninterpretable climate applications.\n  Our models and datasets are publicly available on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/KV-Park.",

This study highlights the potential\nof physics-informed neural models in bridging machine learning and\ninterpretable climate applications.\n  Our models and datasets are publicly available on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/KV-Park."

We use temporal\ncausal attention and cache the historical keys and values as implicit memory to\nenable efficient streaming long-term 4D reconstruction. This design can handle\nreal-time 4D reconstruction by incrementally integrating historical information\nwhile maintaining high-quality spatial consistency. For efficient training, we\npropose to distill knowledge from the dense bidirectional visual geometry\ngrounded transformer (VGGT) to our causal model. For inference, our model\nsupports the migration of optimized efficient attention operator (e.g.,\nFlashAttention) from the field of large language models. Extensive experiments\non various 4D geometry perception benchmarks demonstrate that our model\nincreases the inference speed in online scenarios while maintaining competitive\nperformance, paving the way for scalable and interactive 4D vision systems.\nCode is available at: https://github.com/wzzheng/StreamVGGT.",

Caching techniques, which leverage data reuse to reduce\ncomputation, offer opportunities to optimize the performance of LLM inference\nengines. On the one hand, the low-level key-value (KV) cache working at the\ntoken level is widely adopted, albeit it incurs significant overhead as request\nvolume grows. On the other hand, instruction-level caching, which stores full\ninstruction-response pairs, is expected to play an increasingly crucial role.\nHowever, the high variability in the content and length of instructions make it\nrare for identical instructions to recur within a short time window, presenting\nchallenges for effective caching instruction-response pairs. To address this\nchallenge, we propose InstCache, a predictive caching mechanism for LLM serving\nsystems. Leveraging the capability of LLMs, we can effectively reorder the\nrepresentation space of instruction texts and develop a sufficient level of\nspatial locality. Such spatial locality enables us to predict potential\ninstructions located in a compact region in the space, resulting in an\neffective caching system at runtime. Experimental results demonstrate that\nInstCache achieves a 2.3x higher hit rate compared to the upper bound of\ntraditional caching mechanisms on WildChat dataset and reduces the time per\noutput token of vLLM by up to 42.0% and 50.0% on LMSys and Moss datasets,\nrespectively.",

On the other hand, instruction-level caching, which stores full\ninstruction-response pairs, is expected to play an increasingly crucial role.\nHowever, the high variability in the content and length of instructions make it\nrare for identical instructions to recur within a short time window, presenting\nchallenges for effective caching instruction-response pairs. To address this\nchallenge, we propose InstCache, a predictive caching mechanism for LLM serving\nsystems. Leveraging the capability of LLMs, we can effectively reorder the\nrepresentation space of instruction texts and develop a sufficient level of\nspatial locality. Such spatial locality enables us to predict potential\ninstructions located in a compact region in the space, resulting in an\neffective caching system at runtime. Experimental results demonstrate that\nInstCache achieves a 2.3x higher hit rate compared to the upper bound of\ntraditional caching mechanisms on WildChat dataset and reduces the time per\noutput token of vLLM by up to 42.0% and 50.0% on LMSys and Moss datasets,\nrespectively."

Previous\nresearch has extensively focused on reducing cold-start latency for specific\nfunctions. However, little attention has been given to skewed production\nworkloads. In such cases, cross-function optimization becomes essential.\nWithout cross-function optimization, a cloud provider is left with two equally\npoor options: (i) Either the cloud provider gives up optimization for each\nfunction in the long tail (which is slow); or (ii) the cloud provider applies\nfunction-specific optimizations (e.g., cache function images) to every function\nin the long tail (which violates the vendor's cache constraints). HotSwap\ndemonstrates cross-function optimization using a novel pre-warming strategy. In\nthis strategy, a pre-initialized live dependency image is migrated to the new\nfunction instance. At the same time, HotSwap respects the provider's cache\nconstraints, because a single pre-warmed dependency image in the cache can be\nshared among all serverless functions that require that image.

Concretely, 6G will need to consider both the\nperformance and sustainability targets for the various use cases it will serve.\nMoreover, like previous generations, 6G will have various candidate\ntechnological enablers, making the design space of the system even more\ncomplex. Furthermore, given the subjective nature of the sustainability\nindicators, in particular social sustainability, there is a significant gap in\nliterature on how technical enablers and 6G System design can be linked to\nthem. Hence, in this article a novel method for 6G end-to-end (E2E) system\ndesign based on Knowledge graphs (KG) has been introduced. It considers as its\ninput: the use case KPIs, use case sustainability requirements expressed as Key\nValues (KV) and KV Indicators (KVIs), the ability of the technological enablers\nto satisfy these KPIs and KVIs, the 6G system design principles defined in\nHexa-X-II project, the maturity of a technological enabler and the dependencies\nbetween the various enablers. As part of the KG method, a novel approach for\ndetermining the key values a technological enabler addresses, has also been\nintroduced. The effectiveness of the KG method was demonstrated by its\napplication in designing the 6G E2E system for the cooperating mobile robot use\ncase defined in the Hexa-X-II project, where 82 enablers were selected.

Krul dynamically selects compression strategies\nbased on attention similarity across layer pairs and uses a\nrecomputation-loading pipeline to restore the KV cache.

However,\ntheir practical application suffers from inherent dynamic feature instability,\nleading to error amplification during cached inference. Through systematic\nanalysis, we identify the absence of long-range feature preservation mechanisms\nas the root cause of unstable feature propagation and perturbation sensitivity.\nTo this end, we propose Skip-DiT, an image and video generative DiT variant\nenhanced with Long-Skip-Connections (LSCs) - the key efficiency component in\nU-Nets. Theoretical spectral norm and visualization analysis demonstrate how\nLSCs stabilize feature dynamics. Skip-DiT architecture and its stabilized\ndynamic feature enable an efficient statical caching mechanism that reuses deep\nfeatures across timesteps while updating shallow components. Extensive\nexperiments across the image and video generation tasks demonstrate that\nSkip-DiT achieves: (1) 4.4 times training acceleration and faster convergence,\n(2) 1.5-2 times inference acceleration with negligible quality loss and high\nfidelity to the original output, outperforming existing DiT caching methods\nacross various quantitative metrics.

                    "value": "Diffusion Transformers (DiT) have emerged as a powerful architecture for\nimage and video generation, offering superior quality and scalability. However,\ntheir practical application suffers from inherent dynamic feature instability,\nleading to error amplification during cached inference. Through systematic\nanalysis, we identify the absence of long-range feature preservation mechanisms\nas the root cause of unstable feature propagation and perturbation sensitivity.\nTo this end, we propose Skip-DiT, an image and video generative DiT variant\nenhanced with Long-Skip-Connections (LSCs) - the key efficiency component in\nU-Nets. Theoretical spectral norm and visualization analysis demonstrate how\nLSCs stabilize feature dynamics. Skip-DiT architecture and its stabilized\ndynamic feature enable an efficient statical caching mechanism that reuses deep\nfeatures across timesteps while updating shallow components. Extensive\nexperiments across the image and video generation tasks demonstrate that\nSkip-DiT achieves: (1) 4.4 times training acceleration and faster convergence,\n(2) 1.5-2 times inference acceleration with negligible quality loss and high\nfidelity to the original output, outperforming existing DiT caching methods\nacross various quantitative metrics.

To\naddress these limitations, this work contributes: (1) a Convolutional Neural\nNetwork (CNN) based primitive initializer for 3DGS using monocular images; (2)\na pipeline capable of training with noisy or implicit pose estimates; and (3)\nand analysis of initialization variants that reduce the training cost of\nprecise 3D models.

This assembly of primitives is then used to initialize\n3DGS, significantly reducing the number of training iterations and input images\nneeded -- by at least an order of magnitude. For additional flexibility, the\nCNN component has multiple variants with different pose estimation techniques.\nThis work performs a comparison between these variants, evaluating their\neffectiveness for downstream 3DGS training under noisy or implicit pose\nestimates.

Additionally, we release two new datasets - nuView\n(focused on environmental conditions and viewpoints) and GroundView (focused on\nobject grounding) - to better assess scene captioning across diverse driving\nscenarios and address gaps in current benchmarks, along with initial\nbenchmarking results demonstrating their effectiveness."

However, Recurrent LLMs often underperform on long-context tasks\ndue to their limited fixed-size memory. Previous research has primarily focused\non enhancing the memory capacity of Recurrent LLMs through architectural\ninnovations, but these approaches have not yet enabled Recurrent LLMs to match\nthe performance of Self-Attention LLMs on long-context tasks. We argue that\nthis limitation arises because processing the entire context at once is not\nwell-suited for Recurrent LLMs. In this paper, we propose Smooth Reading, a\nchunk-wise inference method inspired by human reading strategies. Smooth\nReading processes context in chunks and iteratively summarizes the contextual\ninformation, thereby reducing memory demands and making the approach more\ncompatible with Recurrent LLMs. Our experimental results show that this method\nsubstantially narrows the performance gap between Recurrent and Self-Attention\nLLMs on long-context tasks, while preserving the efficiency advantages of\nRecurrent LLMs. Our Smooth Reading boosts SWA-3B-4k (a Recurrent LLM) from\n5.68% lower to 3.61% higher performance than Self-Attention LLMs on LongBench.\nBesides, our method maintains the high efficiency, training 3x faster and\ninferring 2x faster at 64k context compared to Self-Attention LLMs. To our\nknowledge, this is the first work to achieve comparable performance using\nRecurrent LLMs compared with Self-Attention LLMs on long-context tasks. We hope\nour method will inspire future research in this area. To facilitate further\nprogress, we will release code and dataset.",

Enhancing LLMs' robustness to such noise is\ncritical for improving the reliability of RAG systems. Recent advances have\nequipped LLMs with strong reasoning and self-reflection capabilities, allowing\nthem to identify and correct errors in their reasoning process. Inspired by\nthis ability, we propose Passage Injection-a simple yet effective method that\nexplicitly incorporates retrieved passages into LLMs' reasoning process, aiming\nto enhance the model's ability to recognize and resist noisy passages. We\nvalidate Passage Injection under general RAG settings using BM25 as the\nretriever. Experiments on four reasoning-enhanced LLMs across four factual QA\ndatasets demonstrate that Passage Injection significantly improves overall RAG\nperformance. Further analysis on two noisy retrieval settings-random noise,\nwhere the model is provided irrelevant passages, and counterfactual noise,\nwhere it is given misleading passages-shows that Passage Injection consistently\nimproves robustness. Controlled experiments confirm that Passage Injection can\nalso effectively leverage helpful passages.

Accurately quantifying this obscuration is crucial for interpreting\ngalaxy spectral energy distributions (SEDs). The extinction curves in the Milky\nWay (MW) and Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) exhibit a strong feature known as the\n2175A UV bump, most often attributed to small carbonaceous dust grains.

Here we report the detection of a strong UV bump in a\nluminous Lyman-break galaxy at z = 7.11235, GNWY-7379420231, through\nobservations taken as part of the NIRSpec Wide GTO survey. We fit a dust\nattenuation curve that is consistent with the MW extinction curve within\n1{\\sigma}, in a galaxy just ~700 Myr after the Big Bang. From the integrated\nspectrum, we infer a young mass-weighted age (t* ~ 22-59 Myr) for this galaxy,\nhowever spatially resolved SED fitting unveils the presence of an older stellar\npopulation (t* ~ 252 Myr). Furthermore, morphological analysis provides\nevidence for a potential merger. The underlying older stellar population\nsuggests the merging system could be pre-enriched, with the dust illuminated by\na merger-induced starburst. Moreover, turbulence driven by stellar feedback in\nthis bursty region may be driving PAH formation through top-down shattering.\nThe presence of a UV bump in GNWY-7379420231 solidifies growing evidence for\nthe rapid evolution of dust properties within the first billion years of cosmic\ntime.",

In\nprevious studies, the determination of the interaction cross-section at\nultrahigh energies has relied on the assumption that the tail of the\n$X_\\mathrm{max}$ distribution is proton-dominated, which restricts the analysis\nto a limited energy range below the ankle and introduces related systematic\nuncertainties. In this contribution, we adopt a novel method for the\nsimultaneous estimation of the proton-proton interaction cross-section and the\nprimary cosmic-ray mass composition using data from the Pierre Auger\nObservatory, avoiding assumptions about one quantity to infer the other and\nthus improving the accuracy and robustness of our analysis. In addition, a\nsystematic shift in the $X_\\mathrm{max}$ scale is fitted to account for both\nexperimental uncertainties and theoretical constraints on the modeling of\nparticle interactions.

However, existing models\nand datasets predominantly neglect the influence of subjective cognitive\ndiversity on fixation behavior.

However, it is\nknown to incur a quadratic computational complexity with respect to the number\nof patches. One promising approach to address this issue is patch pruning,\nwhich improves computational efficiency by identifying and removing redundant\npatches.

DyVTE uses lightweight hyper-networks to perceive\nthe text token status and decide the removal of all visual tokens after a\ncertain layer, thereby addressing the observed visual redundancy. To validate\nVTE, we apply it to a set of MLLMs, including LLaVA, VILA, Eagle and InternVL,\nand conduct extensive experiments on a bunch of benchmarks. The experiment\nresults not only show the effectiveness of our VTE in improving MLLMs'\nefficiency, but also yield the general modeling patterns of MLLMs, well\nfacilitating the in-depth understanding of MLLMs. Our code is released at\nhttps://github.com/DoubtedSteam/DyVTE.",

In\nparticular, we reveal that visual tokens will stop contributing to reasoning\nwhen the text tokens receive enough image information, yielding obvious visual\nredundancy. Based on these generalized observations, we propose a simple yet\neffective method to improve the efficiency of MLLMs, termed dynamic\nvisual-token exit (DyVTE). DyVTE uses lightweight hyper-networks to perceive\nthe text token status and decide the removal of all visual tokens after a\ncertain layer, thereby addressing the observed visual redundancy. To validate\nVTE, we apply it to a set of MLLMs, including LLaVA, VILA, Eagle and InternVL,\nand conduct extensive experiments on a bunch of benchmarks. The experiment\nresults not only show the effectiveness of our VTE in improving MLLMs'\nefficiency, but also yield the general modeling patterns of MLLMs, well\nfacilitating the in-depth understanding of MLLMs. Our code is released at\nhttps://github.com/DoubtedSteam/DyVTE."

Existing methods lack transparency regarding their underlying\nalgorithms or training datasets, rely on large, high-quality PV training data,\nand struggle to generalize to new geographic regions or varied environmental\nconditions without extensive re-training. These limitations lead to\ninconsistent detection outcomes, hindering large-scale deployment and\ndata-driven grid optimization. In this paper, we investigate how large language\nmodels (LLMs) can be leveraged to overcome these challenges.

To overcome these issues, we propose the PV Assessment with\nLLMs (PVAL) framework, which incorporates task decomposition for more efficient\nworkflows, output standardization for consistent and scalable formatting,\nfew-shot prompting to enhance classification accuracy, and fine-tuning using\ncurated PV datasets with detailed annotations. PVAL ensures transparency,\nscalability, and adaptability across heterogeneous datasets while minimizing\ncomputational overhead.

Recently, the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture has emerged as\nan efficient alternative, promising efficient inference with less activated\nweights per token. Nevertheless, fine-grained MoE-based LLMs face several\nchallenges: 1) Variable workloads during runtime create arbitrary GEMV-GEMM\nratios that reduce hardware utilization, 2) Traditional MoE-based scheduling\nfor LLM serving cannot fuse attention operations with MoE operations, leading\nto increased latency and decreased hardware utilization, and 3) Despite being\nmore efficient than conventional LLMs, loading experts from DRAM still consumes\nsignificant energy and requires substantial DRAM bandwidth.

For a given uniform-bit quantization\nconfiguration, MixA-Q separates the batched window computations within Swin\nblocks and assigns a lower bit width to the activations of less important\nwindows, improving the trade-off between model performance and efficiency. We\nintroduce a Two-Branch Swin Block that processes activations separately in\nhigh- and low-bit precision, enabling seamless integration of our method with\nmost quantization-aware training (QAT) and post-training quantization (PTQ)\nmethods, or with simple modifications. Our experimental evaluations over the\nCOCO dataset demonstrate that MixA-Q achieves a training-free 1.35x\ncomputational speedup without accuracy loss in PTQ configuration. With QAT,\nMixA-Q achieves a lossless 1.25x speedup and a 1.53x speedup with only a 1% mAP\ndrop by incorporating activation pruning. Notably, by reducing the quantization\nerror in important regions, our sparsity-aware quantization adaptation improves\nthe mAP of the quantized W4A4 model (with both weights and activations in 4-bit\nprecision) by 0.7%, reducing quantization degradation by 24%.",

We propose a Cross Spatial Temporal Fusion (CSTF)\nmechanism that enhances feature representation by integrating scale-invariant\nkeypoints detected independently in both reference and query images. Our\napproach improves feature matching in two ways: First, by creating\ncorrespondence maps that leverage information from multiple image regions\nsimultaneously, and second, by reformulating the similarity matching process as\na classification task using SoftMax and Fully Convolutional Network (FCN)\nlayers. This dual approach enables CSTF to maintain sensitivity to distinctive\nlocal features while incorporating broader contextual information, resulting in\nrobust matching across diverse remote sensing modalities. To demonstrate the\npractical utility of improved feature matching, we evaluate CSTF on object\ndetection tasks using the HRSC2016 and DOTA benchmark datasets. Our method\nachieves state-of-theart performance with an average mAP of 90.99% on HRSC2016\nand 90.86% on DOTA, outperforming existing models. The CSTF model maintains\ncomputational efficiency with an inference speed of 12.5 FPS.

Standard retrieval process prioritized\nrelevance, focusing on topical alignment between queries and passages. In\ncontrast, in RAG, the emphasis has shifted to utility, which considers the\nusefulness of passages for generating accurate answers. Despite empirical\nevidence showing the benefits of utility-based retrieval in RAG, the high\ncomputational cost of using LLMs for utility judgments limits the number of\npassages evaluated. This restriction is problematic for complex queries\nrequiring extensive information. To address this, we propose a method to\ndistill the utility judgment capabilities of LLMs into smaller, more efficient\nmodels. Our approach focuses on utility-based selection rather than ranking,\nenabling dynamic passage selection tailored to specific queries without the\nneed for fixed thresholds. We train student models to learn pseudo-answer\ngeneration and utility judgments from teacher LLMs, using a sliding window\nmethod that dynamically selects useful passages. Our experiments demonstrate\nthat utility-based selection provides a flexible and cost-effective solution\nfor RAG, significantly reducing computational costs while improving answer\nquality. We present the distillation results using Qwen3-32B as the teacher\nmodel for both relevance ranking and utility-based selection, distilled into\nRankQwen1.7B and UtilityQwen1.7B.

Recently, their\neffectiveness as embedding models has gained attention, marking a paradigm\nshift from traditional encoder-only models like ELMo and BERT to decoder-only,\nlarge-scale LLMs such as GPT, LLaMA, and Mistral. This survey provides an\nin-depth overview of this transition, beginning with foundational techniques\nbefore the LLM era, followed by LLM-based embedding models through two main\nstrategies to derive embeddings from LLMs. 1) Direct prompting: We mainly\ndiscuss the prompt designs and the underlying rationale for deriving\ncompetitive embeddings. 2) Data-centric tuning: We cover extensive aspects that\naffect tuning an embedding model, including model architecture, training\nobjectives, data constructions, etc. Upon the above, we also cover advanced\nmethods for producing embeddings from longer texts, multilingual, code,\ncross-modal data, as well as reasoning-aware and other domain-specific\nscenarios. Furthermore, we discuss factors affecting choices of embedding\nmodels, such as performance/efficiency comparisons, dense vs sparse embeddings,\npooling strategies, and scaling law. Lastly, the survey highlights the\nlimitations and challenges in adapting LLMs for embeddings, including\ncross-task embedding quality, trade-offs between efficiency and accuracy,\nlow-resource, long-context, data bias, robustness, etc. This survey serves as a\nvaluable resource for researchers and practitioners by synthesizing current\nadvancements, highlighting key challenges, and offering a comprehensive\nframework for future work aimed at enhancing the effectiveness and efficiency\nof LLMs as embedding models.",

Grounding LLMs in rigorous\nformal systems where generative models operate in formal language spaces (e.g.,\nDafny) enables the automatic and mathematically provable verification of their\nreasoning processes and outcomes.

As a result of GEPA's design, it\ncan often turn even just a few rollouts into a large quality gain. Across four\ntasks, GEPA outperforms GRPO by 10% on average and by up to 20%, while using up\nto 35x fewer rollouts.

Second, we implement and evaluate a range of models on\nthe IBM Anti-Money Laundering (AML) dataset. The classical baseline models\ninclude Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost. These\nare compared against three hybrid classic quantum algorithms architectures: a\nQuantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM), a Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC),\nand a Hybrid Quantum Neural Network (HQNN).\n  Furthermore, we propose Fraud Detection for Quantum Computing (FD4QC), a\npractical, API-driven system architecture designed for real-world deployment,\nfeaturing a classical-first, quantum-enhanced philosophy with robust fallback\nmechanisms.\n  Our results demonstrate that classical tree-based models, particularly\n\\textit{Random Forest}, significantly outperform the quantum counterparts in\nthe current setup, achieving high accuracy (\\(97.34\\%\\)) and F-measure\n(\\(86.95\\%\\)). Among the quantum models, \\textbf{QSVM} shows the most promise,\ndelivering high precision (\\(77.15\\%\\)) and a low false-positive rate\n(\\(1.36\\%\\)), albeit with lower recall and significant computational overhead.\n  This report provides a benchmark for a real-world financial application,\nhighlights the current limitations of quantum machine learning in this domain,\nand outlines promising directions for future research.",

These\nare compared against three hybrid classic quantum algorithms architectures: a\nQuantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM), a Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC),\nand a Hybrid Quantum Neural Network (HQNN).\n  Furthermore, we propose Fraud Detection for Quantum Computing (FD4QC), a\npractical, API-driven system architecture designed for real-world deployment,\nfeaturing a classical-first, quantum-enhanced philosophy with robust fallback\nmechanisms.\n  Our results demonstrate that classical tree-based models, particularly\n\\textit{Random Forest}, significantly outperform the quantum counterparts in\nthe current setup, achieving high accuracy (\\(97.34\\%\\)) and F-measure\n(\\(86.95\\%\\)). Among the quantum models, \\textbf{QSVM} shows the most promise,\ndelivering high precision (\\(77.15\\%\\)) and a low false-positive rate\n(\\(1.36\\%\\)), albeit with lower recall and significant computational overhead.\n  This report provides a benchmark for a real-world financial application,\nhighlights the current limitations of quantum machine learning in this domain,\nand outlines promising directions for future research."

In this paper, we describe the process of\ncontainerising an audio tagging model into a microservice, a small segregated\ncode module that can be integrated into a multitude of different network\nsetups. The goal is to develop a modular, accessible, and flexible tool capable\nof seamless deployment into broadcasting workflows of all sizes, from small\nproductions to large corporations. Challenges surrounding latency of the\nselected audio tagging model and its effect on the usefulness of the end\nproduct are discussed."

To address this issue, we propose an efficient ViT\nadaptation framework that enables a single adaptation process to generate\nmultiple models of varying sizes for deployment on platforms with various\nresource constraints. Our approach comprises two stages. In the first stage, we\nenhance a pre-trained ViT with a nested elastic architecture that enables\nstructural flexibility across MLP expansion ratio, number of attention heads,\nembedding dimension, and network depth. To preserve pre-trained knowledge and\nensure stable adaptation, we adopt a curriculum-based training strategy that\nprogressively increases elasticity. In the second stage, we design a\nlightweight router to select submodels according to computational budgets and\ndownstream task demands. Initialized with Pareto-optimal configurations derived\nvia a customized NSGA-II algorithm, the router is then jointly optimized with\nthe backbone. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate the\neffectiveness and versatility of EA-ViT. The code is available at\nhttps://github.com/zcxcf/EA-ViT.",

This should be even\nmore true considering the large influx of new generative or hybrid methods into\nthe field, revealing issues of some objective metrics. Efforts such as the\nInterspeech 2025 URGENT Speech Enhancement Challenge also involving non-English\ndatasets add the aspect of multilinguality to the testing procedure. In this\npaper, we provide a brief recap of the ITU-T P.808 crowdsourced subjective\nlistening test method. A first novel contribution is our proposed process of\nlocalizing both text and audio components of Naderi and Cutler's implementation\nof crowdsourced subjective absolute category rating (ACR) listening tests\ninvolving text-to-speech (TTS).

This should be even\nmore true considering the large influx of new generative or hybrid methods into\nthe field, revealing issues of some objective metrics. Efforts such as the\nInterspeech 2025 URGENT Speech Enhancement Challenge also involving non-English\ndatasets add the aspect of multilinguality to the testing procedure. In this\npaper, we provide a brief recap of the ITU-T P.808 crowdsourced subjective\nlistening test method. A first novel contribution is our proposed process of\nlocalizing both text and audio components of Naderi and Cutler's implementation\nof crowdsourced subjective absolute category rating (ACR) listening tests\ninvolving text-to-speech (TTS).

As\nwireless systems evolve every decade, the development of accurate and\nstandardized channel models becomes increasingly important for the development,\nevaluation and performance assessment of emerging technologies. An effort to\ndevelop a standardized channel model began around 2000 through the Third\nGeneration Partnership Project (3GPP) and the International Telecommunication\nUnion (ITU) with the aim of addressing a broad range of frequencies from sub-1\nGHz to 100 GHz. Prior efforts focused heavily on sub-6 GHz bands and mmWave\nbands, and there exist some gaps in accurately modeling the 7-24 GHz frequency\nrange, a promising candidate band for 6G. To address these gaps, 3GPP approved\na Release (Rel) 19 channel modeling study. This study resulted in several\nenhancements to the channel models, including the ability to accurately model a\nSuburban Macrocell (SMa) scenario, realistic User Terminal (UT) antenna models,\nvariability in the number of clusters, variability in the number of rays per\ncluster, a framework for capturing variability in power among all\npolarizations, near field (NF) propagation, and spatial non-stationarity (SNS)\neffects, all of which may be crucial for future 6G deployments. This paper\npresents the outcomes of this study and provides an overview of the underlying\nrationale, and key discussions that guided the validation, refinement, and\nenhancements of the 3GPP TR 38.901 channel models.",

To address these gaps, 3GPP approved\na Release (Rel) 19 channel modeling study. This study resulted in several\nenhancements to the channel models, including the ability to accurately model a\nSuburban Macrocell (SMa) scenario, realistic User Terminal (UT) antenna models,\nvariability in the number of clusters, variability in the number of rays per\ncluster, a framework for capturing variability in power among all\npolarizations, near field (NF) propagation, and spatial non-stationarity (SNS)\neffects, all of which may be crucial for future 6G deployments. This paper\npresents the outcomes of this study and provides an overview of the underlying\nrationale, and key discussions that guided the validation, refinement, and\nenhancements of the 3GPP TR 38.901 channel models."

Generating multi-human\ncontextual motion requires holistic reasoning over dynamic relationships among\nhuman-human and human-scene interactions. We adapt the power of a large\nlanguage model (LLM) to digest the contextual complexity within textual input\nand convert the task into tangible subproblems such that we can generate\nmulti-agent behavior beyond the scale that was not considered before.\nSpecifically, our event generator formulates the temporal progression of a\ndynamic scene into a sequence of small events. Each event calls for a\nwell-defined motion involving relevant characters and objects. Next, we\nsynthesize the motions of characters at positions sampled based on spatial\nguidance. We employ a high-level module to deliver scalable yet comprehensive\ncontext, translating events into relative descriptions that enable the\nretrieval of precise coordinates. As the first to address this problem at scale\nand with diversity, we offer a benchmark to assess diverse aspects of\ncontextual reasoning.

This poses privacy and security challenges concerning the unauthorised\nsharing of information, or other unwanted forms of agent coordination. Modern\nsteganographic techniques could render such dynamics hard to detect. In this\npaper, we comprehensively formalise the problem of secret collusion in systems\nof generative AI agents by drawing on relevant concepts from both AI and\nsecurity literature. We study incentives for the use of steganography, and\npropose a variety of mitigation measures. Our investigations result in a model\nevaluation framework that systematically tests capabilities required for\nvarious forms of secret collusion. We provide extensive empirical results\nacross a range of contemporary LLMs. While the steganographic capabilities of\ncurrent models remain limited, GPT-4 displays a capability jump suggesting the\nneed for continuous monitoring of steganographic frontier model capabilities.\nWe conclude by laying out a comprehensive research program to mitigate future\nrisks of collusion between generative AI models.",

                    "value": "Recent capability increases in large language models (LLMs) open up\napplications in which groups of communicating generative AI agents solve joint\ntasks. This poses privacy and security challenges concerning the unauthorised\nsharing of information, or other unwanted forms of agent coordination. Modern\nsteganographic techniques could render such dynamics hard to detect. In this\npaper, we comprehensively formalise the problem of secret collusion in systems\nof generative AI agents by drawing on relevant concepts from both AI and\nsecurity literature. We study incentives for the use of steganography, and\npropose a variety of mitigation measures. Our investigations result in a model\nevaluation framework that systematically tests capabilities required for\nvarious forms of secret collusion. We provide extensive empirical results\nacross a range of contemporary LLMs. While the steganographic capabilities of\ncurrent models remain limited, GPT-4 displays a capability jump suggesting the\nneed for continuous monitoring of steganographic frontier model capabilities.\nWe conclude by laying out a comprehensive research program to mitigate future\nrisks of collusion between generative AI models."

Recently, the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture has emerged as\nan efficient alternative, promising efficient inference with less activated\nweights per token. Nevertheless, fine-grained MoE-based LLMs face several\nchallenges: 1) Variable workloads during runtime create arbitrary GEMV-GEMM\nratios that reduce hardware utilization, 2) Traditional MoE-based scheduling\nfor LLM serving cannot fuse attention operations with MoE operations, leading\nto increased latency and decreased hardware utilization, and 3) Despite being\nmore efficient than conventional LLMs, loading experts from DRAM still consumes\nsignificant energy and requires substantial DRAM bandwidth. Addressing these\nchallenges, we propose: 1) A3D-MoE, a 3D Heterogeneous Integration system that\nemploys state-of-the-art vertical integration technology to significantly\nenhance memory bandwidth while reducing Network-on-Chip (NoC) overhead and\nenergy consumption. 2) A 3D-Adaptive GEMV-GEMM-ratio systolic array with\nV-Cache efficient data reuse and a novel unified 3D dataflow to solve the\nproblem of reduced hardware utilization caused by arbitrary GEMV-GEMM ratios\nfrom different workloads, 3) A Hardware resource-aware operation fusion\nscheduler that fuses attention operations with MoE operations to enhance\nhardware performance, and 4) MoE Score-Aware HBM access reduction with even-odd\nexpert placement that reduces DRAM access and bandwidth requirements.

Our approach integrates domain-specific\nfeature groupings, carefully balanced few-shot examples, and task-specific\nprompting strategies. We systematically evaluate this method across seventy\ndistinct ICL designs by various prompt variations and two different\ncommunication styles-natural-language narrative and numeric conversational-and\ncompare its performance to robust classical machine learning (ML) benchmarks on\ntasks involving heart disease and diabetes prediction.\n  Our findings indicate that while traditional ML models maintain superior\nperformance in balanced precision-recall scenarios, LLMs employing narrative\nprompts with integrated domain knowledge achieve higher recall and\nsignificantly reduce gender bias, effectively narrowing fairness disparities by\nan order of magnitude. Despite the current limitation of increased inference\nlatency, LLMs provide notable advantages, including the capacity for zero-shot\ndeployment and enhanced equity. This research offers the first comprehensive\nanalysis of ICL design considerations for applying LLMs to tabular clinical\ntasks and highlights distillation and multimodal extensions as promising\ndirections for future research.",

We systematically evaluate this method across seventy\ndistinct ICL designs by various prompt variations and two different\ncommunication styles-natural-language narrative and numeric conversational-and\ncompare its performance to robust classical machine learning (ML) benchmarks on\ntasks involving heart disease and diabetes prediction.\n  Our findings indicate that while traditional ML models maintain superior\nperformance in balanced precision-recall scenarios, LLMs employing narrative\nprompts with integrated domain knowledge achieve higher recall and\nsignificantly reduce gender bias, effectively narrowing fairness disparities by\nan order of magnitude. Despite the current limitation of increased inference\nlatency, LLMs provide notable advantages, including the capacity for zero-shot\ndeployment and enhanced equity. This research offers the first comprehensive\nanalysis of ICL design considerations for applying LLMs to tabular clinical\ntasks and highlights distillation and multimodal extensions as promising\ndirections for future research."

We\napplied our benchmark to three open-source FDSDS (Moshi, Freeze-omni, and\nVITA-1.5) using over 40 hours of generated speech, with 293 simulated\nconversations and 1,200 interruptions. The results show that all models\ncontinue to face challenges, such as failing to respond to user interruptions,\nunder frequent disruptions and noisy conditions.

This method identifies safety-sensitive layers\nwithin the LLM and leverages their representations to detect which data samples\nin the post-training dataset contain safety-degrading features.\n  Experimental results demonstrate that LARF can effectively identify benign\ndata with safety-degrading features. After removing such data, the safety\nalignment degradation caused by fine-tuning is mitigated. Please see our code\nat https://github.com/LLLeoLi/LARF."

Recently emerged learning-based methods, while more\nrobust to such cases, still fall short of achieving comparable performance to\ntraditional methods on well-formed code.\n  In this work, we propose SliceMate, a novel static program slicing solution\npowered by Large Language Model (LLM) agents. It bypasses the need for explicit\ndependency graph construction and achieving superior slicing accuracy.\nConcretely, SliceMate integrates three specialized agents: (1) a synthesis\nagent that produces candidate slices by incrementally expanding the scan scope\nacross functions and files guided by LLM-inferred dependencies; (2) a\nverification agent that performs conciseness and completeness checks of the\ncandidate slices, detecting missing or irrelevant statements; and (3) a\nrefinement agent that repairs the slices with minimal edits in accordance with\nthe verification results. These agents are orchestrated by a control module\nthat ensures timely convergence and outputs high-quality slices without manual\nintervention. For rigorous evaluation, we construct a new and high-quality\nbenchmark, SliceBench, comprising 2,200 manually annotated Java and Python\nprograms, with program lengths ranging from 5 to 8,577 lines, significantly\nlarger than those in existing slicing benchmarks.

The instruct model is then finetuned to translate by\nChain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and further enhanced through reinforcement\nlearning (RL) to achieve better generalization across diverse language pairs.\nSeed-X achieves performance comparable to leading closed-source models,\nincluding Gemini-2.5 and GPT-4o, across 28 languages, and significantly\noutperforms larger open-source models in both automatic metrics and human\nevaluations. We share the best practices through our optimization process, and\nmake the parameter public available for advancing translation research and\napplications.",

Finally,\nthe review highlights emerging solutions, including hybrid retrieval\napproaches, privacy-preserving techniques, optimized fusion strategies, and\nagentic RAG architectures. These innovations point toward a future of more\nreliable, efficient, and context-aware knowledge-intensive NLP systems."

The network cost per injection/All-Reduce bandwidth of\n\\textit{RailX} is less than $10\\%$ of the Fat-Tree, and the cost per\nbisection/All-to-All bandwidth is less than $50\\%$ of the Fat-Tree.\nSpecifically, only $\\sim$\\$$1.3$B is required to interconnect 200K chips with\n1.8TB bandwidth. \\textit{RailX} can also be used in the ML-as-a-service (MLaaS)\nscenario, where single or multiple training workloads with various shapes,\nscales, and parallelism strategies can be flexibly mapped, and failures can be\nworked around."
