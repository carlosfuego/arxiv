One remedy to this problem is the\npromising paradigm of edge computing. Through collaboration with our industry\npartner, we identify key prohibitive limitations of the current edge mindset:\n(1) servers are not distributed enough and thus, are not close enough to\nvehicles, (2) current proposed edge solutions do not provide substantially\nbetter performance and extra information specific to autonomous vehicles to\nwarrant their cost to the user, and (3) the state-of-the-art solutions are not\ncompatible with popular frameworks used in autonomous systems, particularly the\nRobot Operating System (ROS).\n  To remedy these issues, we provide Genie, an encapsulation technique that can\nenable transparent caching in ROS in a non-intrusive way (i.e., without\nmodifying the source code), can build the cache in a distributed manner (in\ncontrast to traditional central caching methods), and can construct a\ncollective three-dimensional object map to provide substantially better latency\n(even on low-power edge servers) and higher quality data to all vehicles in a\ncertain locality. We fully implement our design on state-of-the-art\nindustry-adopted embedded and edge platforms, using the prominent autonomous\ndriving software Autoware, and find that Genie can enhance the latency of\nAutoware Vision Detector by 82% on average, enable object reusability 31% of\nthe time on average and as much as 67% for the incoming requests, and boost the\nconfidence in its object map considerably over time.",

In this work,\nwe observed that compressing KV values is more effective than compressing the\nmodel regarding accuracy and job completion time (JCT). However, quantizing KV\nvalues and dropping less-important tokens incur significant runtime\ncomputational time overhead, delaying JCT. These methods also cannot reduce\ncomputation time or high network communication time overhead in\nsequence-parallelism (SP) frameworks for long prompts. To tackle these issues,\nbased on our insightful observations from experimental analysis, we propose\nZeroC, a Zero-delay QKV Compression system that eliminates time overhead and\neven reduces computation and communication time of the model operations. ZeroC\ninnovatively embeds compression and decompression operations within model\noperations and adaptively determines compression ratios at a hybrid layer-token\nlevel. Further, it enables a communication-efficient SP inference framework.\nTrace-driven experiments demonstrate that ZeroC achieves up to 80% lower\naverage JCT, 35% lower average perplexity, and 2.8x higher throughput with the\nsame latency compared to state-of-the-art compression methods. ZeroC also\nreduces the average JCT of current LLM serving systems by up to 91% with the\nconstraint of 0.1 perplexity increase. We open-sourced the code.",

                    "value": "In large-language models, memory constraints in the key-value cache (KVC)\npose a challenge during inference, especially with long prompts. In this work,\nwe observed that compressing KV values is more effective than compressing the\nmodel regarding accuracy and job completion time (JCT). However, quantizing KV\nvalues and dropping less-important tokens incur significant runtime\ncomputational time overhead, delaying JCT. These methods also cannot reduce\ncomputation time or high network communication time overhead in\nsequence-parallelism (SP) frameworks for long prompts. To tackle these issues,\nbased on our insightful observations from experimental analysis, we propose\nZeroC, a Zero-delay QKV Compression system that eliminates time overhead and\neven reduces computation and communication time of the model operations. ZeroC\ninnovatively embeds compression and decompression operations within model\noperations and adaptively determines compression ratios at a hybrid layer-token\nlevel. Further, it enables a communication-efficient SP inference framework.\nTrace-driven experiments demonstrate that ZeroC achieves up to 80% lower\naverage JCT, 35% lower average perplexity, and 2.8x higher throughput with the\nsame latency compared to state-of-the-art compression methods. ZeroC also\nreduces the average JCT of current LLM serving systems by up to 91% with the\nconstraint of 0.1 perplexity increase. We open-sourced the code."

As\nsemiconductor devices face challenges such as increased leakage currents and\nreduced performance at higher temperatures, these novel technologies offer high\nperformance and low power computation. Cryogenic computing operates at\nultra-low temperatures near 77 K, leading to lower leakage currents and\nimproved electron mobility. On the other hand, superconducting electronics,\noperating near 0 K, allow electrons to flow without resistance, offering the\npotential for ultra-low-power, high-speed computation. This study presents a\ncomprehensive performance modeling and analysis of these technologies and\nprovides insights into their potential benefits and limitations. We implement\nmodels of in-order and out-of-order cores operating at high clock frequencies\nassociated with superconducting electronics and cryogenic computing in gem5. We\nevaluate the performance of these components using workloads representative of\nreal-world applications like NPB, SPEC CPU2006, and GAPBS. Our results show the\npotential speedups achievable by these components and the limitations posed by\ncache bandwidth.

In this paper, we present NVPC, a transparent acceleration to\nexisting kernel file systems with an NVM-enhanced page cache. The acceleration\nlies in two aspects, respectively matching the desperate needs of existing disk\nfile systems: sync writes and cache-missed operations. Besides, the fast DRAM\npage cache is preserved for cache-hit operations. For sync writes, a\nhigh-performance log-based sync absorbing area is provided to redirect data\ndestination from the slow disk to the fast NVM. Meanwhile, the byte-addressable\nfeature of NVM is used to prevent write amplification. For cache-missed\noperations, NVPC makes use of the idle space on NVM to extend the DRAM page\ncache, so that more and larger workloads can fit into the cache. NVPC is\nentirely implemented as a page cache, thus can provide efficient speed-up to\ndisk file systems with full transparency to users and full compatibility to\nlower file systems.\n  In Filebench macro-benchmarks, NVPC achieves at most 3.55x, 2.84x, and 2.64x\nfaster than NOVA, Ext-4, and SPFS.

                "summary": "With large language models (LLMs) widely deployed in long content generation\nrecently, there has emerged an increasing demand for efficient long-sequence\ninference support. However, key-value (KV) cache, which is stored to avoid\nre-computation, has emerged as a critical bottleneck by growing linearly in\nsize with the sequence length. Due to the auto-regressive nature of LLMs, the\nentire KV cache will be loaded for every generated token, resulting in low\nutilization of computational cores and high latency. While various compression\nmethods for KV cache have been proposed to alleviate this issue, they suffer\nfrom degradation in generation quality. We introduce TriForce, a hierarchical\nspeculative decoding system that is scalable for long sequence generation. This\napproach leverages the original model weights and dynamic sparse KV cache via\nretrieval as a draft model, which serves as an intermediate layer in the\nhierarchy and is further speculated by a smaller model to reduce its drafting\nlatency. TriForce not only facilitates impressive speedups for Llama2-7B-128K,\nachieving up to 2.31$\\times$ on an A100 GPU but also showcases scalability in\nhandling even longer contexts. For the offloading setting on two RTX 4090 GPUs,\nTriForce achieves 0.108s/token$\\unicode{x2014}$only half as slow as the\nauto-regressive baseline on an A100, which attains 7.78$\\times$ on our\noptimized offloading system. Additionally, TriForce performs 4.86$\\times$ than\nDeepSpeed-Zero-Inference on a single RTX 4090 GPU. TriForce's robustness is\nhighlighted by its consistently outstanding performance across various\ntemperatures. The code is available at\nhttps://github.com/Infini-AI-Lab/TriForce.",

While various compression\nmethods for KV cache have been proposed to alleviate this issue, they suffer\nfrom degradation in generation quality. We introduce TriForce, a hierarchical\nspeculative decoding system that is scalable for long sequence generation. This\napproach leverages the original model weights and dynamic sparse KV cache via\nretrieval as a draft model, which serves as an intermediate layer in the\nhierarchy and is further speculated by a smaller model to reduce its drafting\nlatency. TriForce not only facilitates impressive speedups for Llama2-7B-128K,\nachieving up to 2.31$\\times$ on an A100 GPU but also showcases scalability in\nhandling even longer contexts. For the offloading setting on two RTX 4090 GPUs,\nTriForce achieves 0.108s/token$\\unicode{x2014}$only half as slow as the\nauto-regressive baseline on an A100, which attains 7.78$\\times$ on our\noptimized offloading system. Additionally, TriForce performs 4.86$\\times$ than\nDeepSpeed-Zero-Inference on a single RTX 4090 GPU. TriForce's robustness is\nhighlighted by its consistently outstanding performance across various\ntemperatures. The code is available at\nhttps://github.com/Infini-AI-Lab/TriForce."

However, searching such an index has\nresulted in significant I/O traffic due to limited access locality and\ninefficient cache utilization. At the heart of index searching is the operation\nof filtering through vast data spans to isolate a small, relevant subset, which\ninvolves basic equality tests rather than the complex arithmetic provided by\nmodern CPUs. This paper introduces the Search-in-Memory (SiM) chip, which\ndemonstrates the feasibility of performing data filtering directly within a\nNAND flash memory chip, transmitting only relevant search results rather than\ncomplete pages. Instead of adding complex circuits, we propose repurposing\nexisting circuitry for efficient and accurate bitwise parallel matching. We\ndemonstrate how different data structures can use our flexible SIMD command\ninterface to offload index searches. This strategy not only frees up the CPU\nfor more computationally demanding tasks, but it also optimizes DRAM usage for\nwrite buffering, significantly lowering energy consumption associated with I/O\ntransmission between the CPU and DRAM. Extensive testing across a wide range of\nworkloads reveals up to a 9X speedup in write-heavy workloads and up to 45%\nenergy savings due to reduced read and write I/O. Furthermore, we achieve\nsignificant reductions in median and tail read latencies of up to 89% and 85%\nrespectively.",

Experiments show that\nChunkAttention can speed up the self-attention kernel by 3.2-4.8$\\times$\ncompared to the state-of-the-art implementation, with the length of the system\nprompt ranging from 1024 to 4096."

Our\nproposal enables models to consume large inputs even with high compression (up\nto 93x) while preserving semantic integrity without the need for fine-tuning."

Palu decomposes the linear layers\ninto low-rank matrices, caches the smaller intermediate states, and\nreconstructs the full keys and values on the fly. To improve accuracy,\ncompression rate, and efficiency, Palu further encompasses (1) a medium-grained\nlow-rank decomposition scheme, (2) an efficient rank search algorithm, (3) a\nlow-rank-aware quantization algorithm, and (4) matrix fusion with optimized GPU\nkernels. Our extensive experiments with popular LLMs show that Palu can\ncompress KV-Cache by more than 91.25% while maintaining a significantly better\naccuracy (up to 1.19 lower perplexity) than state-of-the-art KV-Cache\nquantization methods at a similar or even higher memory usage. When compressing\nKV-Cache for 50%, Palu delivers up to 1.61x end-to-end speedup for the\nattention module. Our code is publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/shadowpa0327/Palu.",

However,\ndetecting cached responses is challenging when web servers do not reliably\ncommunicate the cache status through standardized headers. This paper presents\na novel methodology for cache detection using timing analysis. Our approach\neliminates the dependency on cache status headers, making it applicable to any\nweb server. The methodology relies on sending paired requests using HTTP\nmultiplexing functionality and makes heavy use of cache-busting to control the\norigin of the responses. By measuring the time it takes to receive responses\nfrom paired requests, we can determine if a response is cached or not. In each\npair, one request is cache-busted to force retrieval from the origin server,\nwhile the other request is not and might be served from the cache, if present.\nA faster response time for the non-cache-busted request compared to the\ncache-busted one suggests the first one is coming from the cache. We\nimplemented this approach in a tool and achieved an estimated accuracy of 89.6%\ncompared to state-of-the-art methods based on cache status headers. Leveraging\nour cache detection approach, we conducted a large-scale experiment on the\nTranco Top 50k websites. We identified a significant presence of hidden caches\n(5.8%) that do not advertise themselves through headers. Additionally, we\nemployed our methodology to detect Web Cache Deception (WCD) vulnerabilities in\nthese hidden caches. We discovered that 1.020 of them are susceptible to WCD\nvulnerabilities, potentially leaking sensitive data. Our findings demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of our timing analysis methodology for cache discovery and\nhighlight the importance of a tool that does not rely on cache-communicated\ncache status headers.",

In each\npair, one request is cache-busted to force retrieval from the origin server,\nwhile the other request is not and might be served from the cache, if present.\nA faster response time for the non-cache-busted request compared to the\ncache-busted one suggests the first one is coming from the cache. We\nimplemented this approach in a tool and achieved an estimated accuracy of 89.6%\ncompared to state-of-the-art methods based on cache status headers. Leveraging\nour cache detection approach, we conducted a large-scale experiment on the\nTranco Top 50k websites. We identified a significant presence of hidden caches\n(5.8%) that do not advertise themselves through headers. Additionally, we\nemployed our methodology to detect Web Cache Deception (WCD) vulnerabilities in\nthese hidden caches. We discovered that 1.020 of them are susceptible to WCD\nvulnerabilities, potentially leaking sensitive data. Our findings demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of our timing analysis methodology for cache discovery and\nhighlight the importance of a tool that does not rely on cache-communicated\ncache status headers."

However, they suffer from high tail latency, in the order of\nseveral seconds, making them less attractive for user-facing applications. In\nthis paper, we introduce the notion of compaction chains and we analyse how\nthey affect tail latency. Then, we show that modern designs reduce tail\nlatency, by trading I/O amplification or require large amounts of memory. Based\non our analysis, we present vLSM, a new KV store design that improves tail\nlatency significantly without compromising on memory or I/O amplification. vLSM\nreduces (a) compaction chain width by using small SSTs and eliminating the\ntiering compaction required in L0 by modern systems and (b) compaction chain\nlength by using a larger than typical growth factor between L1 and L2 and\nintroducing overlap-aware SSTs in L1.

                    "value": "LSM-based key-value (KV) stores are an important component in modern data\ninfrastructures. However, they suffer from high tail latency, in the order of\nseveral seconds, making them less attractive for user-facing applications. In\nthis paper, we introduce the notion of compaction chains and we analyse how\nthey affect tail latency. Then, we show that modern designs reduce tail\nlatency, by trading I/O amplification or require large amounts of memory. Based\non our analysis, we present vLSM, a new KV store design that improves tail\nlatency significantly without compromising on memory or I/O amplification. vLSM\nreduces (a) compaction chain width by using small SSTs and eliminating the\ntiering compaction required in L0 by modern systems and (b) compaction chain\nlength by using a larger than typical growth factor between L1 and L2 and\nintroducing overlap-aware SSTs in L1. We implement vLSM in RocksDB and evaluate\nit using db_bench and YCSB.

In SL training\nwith multiple clients, the local model weights are shared among the clients for\nlocal model update. This paper first reveals data privacy leakage exacerbated\nfrom local weight sharing among the clients in SL through model inversion\nattacks. Then, to reduce the data privacy leakage issue, we propose and analyze\nprivacy-enhanced SL (P-SL) (or SL without local weight sharing). We further\npropose parallelized P-SL to expedite the training process by duplicating\nmultiple server-side model instances without compromising accuracy. Finally, we\nexplore P-SL with late participating clients and devise a server-side\ncache-based training method to address the forgetting phenomenon in SL when\nlate clients join. Experimental results demonstrate that P-SL helps reduce up\nto 50% of client-side data leakage, which essentially achieves a better\nprivacy-accuracy trade-off than the current trend by using differential privacy\nmechanisms. Moreover, P-SL and its cache-based version achieve comparable\naccuracy to baseline SL under various data distributions, while cost less\ncomputation and communication. Additionally, caching-based training in P-SL\nmitigates the negative effect of forgetting, stabilizes the learning, and\nenables practical and low-complexity training in a dynamic environment with\nlate-arriving clients.",

To mitigate computational costs, LLMs often employ the KV\nCache technique to improve the generation speed. While improving the\ncomputational efficiency, the storage requirements of the KV cache are\nsubstantial, particularly in long-context scenarios, leading to significant\nmemory consumption. Existing KV cache eviction methods often degrade the\nperformance of LLMs in long-context scenarios due to the information loss\nintroduced by eviction. In this paper, we propose a novel KV cache merging\napproach, called KVMerger, to achieve adaptive KV cache compression for\nlong-context tasks without significant performance degradation under\nconstrained memory budgets. Our approach is inspired by the intriguing\nobservation that key states exhibit high similarity at the token level within a\nsingle sequence. To facilitate merging, we develop an effective yet\nstraightforward merging set identification algorithm to identify suitable KV\nstates for merging. Our merging set identification algorithm stimulates the\nsecond observation that KV cache sparsity, from similarity perspective, is\nindependent of the dataset and remains persistent at the model level.\nSubsequently, we propose a Gaussian kernel weighted merging algorithm to\nselectively merge all states within each merging set. We conduct extensive\nexperiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of KVMerger for long-context tasks\nunder constrained memory budgets, applying it to models including\nLlama2-7B-chat and Llama2-13B-chat.

Existing dense and generative retrieval models often fail to capture\nnuanced user intent in these cases. To address this, we propose an approach to\nenhance query understanding by augmenting queries with rich contextual signals\nderived from web search results and large language models, stored in an online\ncache. Specifically, we use web search titles and snippets to ground queries in\nreal-world information and utilize GPT-4 to generate query rewrites and\nexplanations that clarify user intent. These signals are efficiently integrated\nthrough a Fusion-in-Decoder based Unity architecture, enabling both dense and\ngenerative retrieval with serving costs on par with traditional context-free\nmodels. To address scenarios where context is unavailable in the cache, we\nintroduce context glancing, a curriculum learning strategy that improves model\nrobustness and performance even without contextual signals during inference.\nExtensive offline experiments demonstrate that our context-aware approach\nsubstantially outperforms context-free models. Furthermore, online A/B testing\non a prominent search engine across 160+ countries shows significant\nimprovements in user engagement and revenue.",

Existing dense and generative retrieval models often fail to capture\nnuanced user intent in these cases. To address this, we propose an approach to\nenhance query understanding by augmenting queries with rich contextual signals\nderived from web search results and large language models, stored in an online\ncache. Specifically, we use web search titles and snippets to ground queries in\nreal-world information and utilize GPT-4 to generate query rewrites and\nexplanations that clarify user intent. These signals are efficiently integrated\nthrough a Fusion-in-Decoder based Unity architecture, enabling both dense and\ngenerative retrieval with serving costs on par with traditional context-free\nmodels. To address scenarios where context is unavailable in the cache, we\nintroduce context glancing, a curriculum learning strategy that improves model\nrobustness and performance even without contextual signals during inference.\nExtensive offline experiments demonstrate that our context-aware approach\nsubstantially outperforms context-free models. Furthermore, online A/B testing\non a prominent search engine across 160+ countries shows significant\nimprovements in user engagement and revenue."

An\neffective approach to compress KV cache is quantization. However, traditional\nquantization methods face significant memory overhead due to the need to store\nquantization constants (at least a zero point and a scale) in full precision\nper data block. Depending on the block size, this overhead can add 1 or 2 bits\nper quantized number. We introduce QJL, a new quantization approach that\nconsists of a Johnson-Lindenstrauss (JL) transform followed by sign-bit\nquantization. In contrast to existing methods, QJL eliminates memory overheads\nby removing the need for storing quantization constants. We propose an\nasymmetric estimator for the inner product of two vectors and demonstrate that\napplying QJL to one vector and a standard JL transform without quantization to\nthe other provides an unbiased estimator with minimal distortion. We have\ndeveloped an efficient implementation of the QJL sketch and its corresponding\ninner product estimator, incorporating a lightweight CUDA kernel for optimized\ncomputation. When applied across various LLMs and NLP tasks to quantize the KV\ncache to only 3 bits, QJL demonstrates a more than fivefold reduction in KV\ncache memory usage without compromising accuracy, all while achieving faster\nruntime.

However, the efficiency and inference capability of FL is\nseriously limited due to the presence of stragglers and data imbalance across\nmassive AIoT devices, respectively. To address the above challenges, we present\na novel asynchronous FL approach named CaBaFL, which includes a hierarchical\nCache-based aggregation mechanism and a feature Balance-guided device selection\nstrategy. CaBaFL maintains multiple intermediate models simultaneously for\nlocal training.

Here, we present\nFree-Electron Ramsey Imaging (FERI), a microscopy approach based on\nlight-induced electron modulation that enables coherent amplification of\noptical near-fields in electron imaging. We provide simultaneous time-, space-,\nand phase-resolved measurements of a micro-drum made from a hexagonal boron\nnitride membrane visualizing the sub-cycle dynamics of 2D polariton wavepackets\ntherein. The phase-resolved measurements reveals vortex-anti-vortex\nsingularities on the polariton wavefronts, together with an intriguing\nphenomenon of a traveling wave mimicking the amplitude profile of a standing\nwave. Our experiments show a 20-fold coherent amplification of the near-field\nsignal compared to conventional electron near-field imaging, resolving peak\nfield intensities in the order of ~W/cm2, corresponding to field amplitudes of\na few kV/m. As a result, our work paves the way for spatio-temporal electron\nmicroscopy of biological specimens and quantum materials, exciting yet delicate\nsamples that are currently difficult to investigate.",

Prior works on high-performance tensor decomposition and\ncompletion have focused on performance and scalability optimizations for\nspecific SpTTN kernels. We present algorithms and a runtime system for\nidentifying and executing the most efficient loop nest for any SpTTN kernel.

                "summary": "In this research, the effect of utilizing a micro plasma actuator on\ncontrolling the flow through a two-dimensional cylinder is investigated using\nan advanced electrostatic model. Within this model, by solving two elliptic\nequations, the potential distribution and plasma distribution in the solution\ndomain are determined, leading to the generation of a volumetric force. This\nforce is added to the momentum equations as a source term. The Reynolds number\nof the flow is set at 20,000, and the plasma actuator operates in a steady\nmanner. Due to the high Reynolds number, the flow is turbulent, and its\ntime-dependent nature is modeled as unsteady. Plasma actuators are\nsymmetrically mounted at 45 and 90 degrees with respect to the free stream,\nboth above and below the cylinder surfaces. The influence of the actuator\nplacement angle on the flow quality downstream of the cylinder is examined. The\nresults indicate an enhancement of flow quality by 8% to 15% downstream of the\ncylinder. Moreover, improvements of 40% to 55% in the variation of the lift\ncoefficient and 75% to 90% in the drag coefficient are reported. The findings\nreveal superior performance of the actuator positioned at 90 degrees compared\nto the 45-degree orientation. This can be attributed to the proximity of the\n90-degree actuator position to the point of boundary layer separation\ninitiation. Furthermore, using the actuator positioned at 90 degrees and\napplying three different voltages of 10, 13, and 16 kV, the impact of flow\ncontrol on the first cylinder in a tandem arrangement on the downstream flow of\nthe second cylinder is examined. The results demonstrate an enhancement in\ndownstream flow quality of 20% to 26%.",

                    "value": "In this research, the effect of utilizing a micro plasma actuator on\ncontrolling the flow through a two-dimensional cylinder is investigated using\nan advanced electrostatic model. Within this model, by solving two elliptic\nequations, the potential distribution and plasma distribution in the solution\ndomain are determined, leading to the generation of a volumetric force. This\nforce is added to the momentum equations as a source term. The Reynolds number\nof the flow is set at 20,000, and the plasma actuator operates in a steady\nmanner. Due to the high Reynolds number, the flow is turbulent, and its\ntime-dependent nature is modeled as unsteady. Plasma actuators are\nsymmetrically mounted at 45 and 90 degrees with respect to the free stream,\nboth above and below the cylinder surfaces. The influence of the actuator\nplacement angle on the flow quality downstream of the cylinder is examined. The\nresults indicate an enhancement of flow quality by 8% to 15% downstream of the\ncylinder. Moreover, improvements of 40% to 55% in the variation of the lift\ncoefficient and 75% to 90% in the drag coefficient are reported. The findings\nreveal superior performance of the actuator positioned at 90 degrees compared\nto the 45-degree orientation. This can be attributed to the proximity of the\n90-degree actuator position to the point of boundary layer separation\ninitiation. Furthermore, using the actuator positioned at 90 degrees and\napplying three different voltages of 10, 13, and 16 kV, the impact of flow\ncontrol on the first cylinder in a tandem arrangement on the downstream flow of\nthe second cylinder is examined. The results demonstrate an enhancement in\ndownstream flow quality of 20% to 26%."

In response, this paper proposes a novel \"Formal-LLM\"\nframework for LLM-based agents by integrating the expressiveness of natural\nlanguage and the precision of formal language. Specifically, the framework\nallows agent developers to express their requirements or constraints for the\nplanning process as an automaton. A stack-based LLM plan generation process is\nthen conducted under the supervision of the automaton to ensure that the\ngenerated plan satisfies the constraints, making the planning process\ncontrollable. We conduct experiments on both benchmark tasks and practical\nreal-life tasks, and our framework achieves over 50% overall performance\nincrease, which validates the feasibility and effectiveness of employing\nFormal-LLM to guide the plan generation of agents, preventing the agents from\ngenerating invalid and unsuccessful plans. Further, more controllable LLM-based\nagents can facilitate the broader utilization of LLM in application scenarios\nwhere high validity of planning is essential.

                    "value": "Recent advancements on Large Language Models (LLMs) enable AI Agents to\nautomatically generate and execute multi-step plans to solve complex tasks.\nHowever, since LLM's content generation process is hardly controllable, current\nLLM-based agents frequently generate invalid or non-executable plans, which\njeopardizes the performance of the generated plans and corrupts users' trust in\nLLM-based agents. In response, this paper proposes a novel \"Formal-LLM\"\nframework for LLM-based agents by integrating the expressiveness of natural\nlanguage and the precision of formal language. Specifically, the framework\nallows agent developers to express their requirements or constraints for the\nplanning process as an automaton. A stack-based LLM plan generation process is\nthen conducted under the supervision of the automaton to ensure that the\ngenerated plan satisfies the constraints, making the planning process\ncontrollable. We conduct experiments on both benchmark tasks and practical\nreal-life tasks, and our framework achieves over 50% overall performance\nincrease, which validates the feasibility and effectiveness of employing\nFormal-LLM to guide the plan generation of agents, preventing the agents from\ngenerating invalid and unsuccessful plans. Further, more controllable LLM-based\nagents can facilitate the broader utilization of LLM in application scenarios\nwhere high validity of planning is essential.

Current models typically incorporate the FiD\nframework, which is composed by a neural retriever alongside an encoder-decoder\nneural reader. In the answer generation process, the retriever will retrieve\nnumerous passages (around 100 for instance), each of which is then individually\nencoded by the encoder. Subsequently, the decoder makes predictions based on\nthese encoded passages. Nevertheless, this framework can be relatively\ntime-consuming, particularly due to the extensive length of the gathered\npassages. To address this, we introduce FastFiD in this paper, a novel approach\nthat executes sentence selection on the encoded passages. This aids in\nretaining valuable sentences while reducing the context length required for\ngenerating answers. Experiments on three commonly used datasets (Natural\nQuestions, TriviaQA and ASQA) demonstrate that our method can enhance the\ninference speed by 2.3X-5.7X, while simultaneously maintaining the model's\nperformance. Moreover, an in-depth analysis of the model's attention reveals\nthat the selected sentences indeed hold a substantial contribution towards the\nfinal answer.

The OpenIns3D framework employs a\n\"Mask-Snap-Lookup\" scheme. The \"Mask\" module learns class-agnostic mask\nproposals in 3D point clouds, the \"Snap\" module generates synthetic scene-level\nimages at multiple scales and leverages 2D vision-language models to extract\ninteresting objects, and the \"Lookup\" module searches through the outcomes of\n\"Snap\" to assign category names to the proposed masks. This approach, yet\nsimple, achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of 3D\nopen-vocabulary tasks, including recognition, object detection, and instance\nsegmentation, on both indoor and outdoor datasets. Moreover, OpenIns3D\nfacilitates effortless switching between different 2D detectors without\nrequiring retraining. When integrated with powerful 2D open-world models, it\nachieves excellent results in scene understanding tasks. Furthermore, when\ncombined with LLM-powered 2D models, OpenIns3D exhibits an impressive\ncapability to comprehend and process highly complex text queries that demand\nintricate reasoning and real-world knowledge.

The OpenIns3D framework employs a\n\"Mask-Snap-Lookup\" scheme. The \"Mask\" module learns class-agnostic mask\nproposals in 3D point clouds, the \"Snap\" module generates synthetic scene-level\nimages at multiple scales and leverages 2D vision-language models to extract\ninteresting objects, and the \"Lookup\" module searches through the outcomes of\n\"Snap\" to assign category names to the proposed masks. This approach, yet\nsimple, achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of 3D\nopen-vocabulary tasks, including recognition, object detection, and instance\nsegmentation, on both indoor and outdoor datasets. Moreover, OpenIns3D\nfacilitates effortless switching between different 2D detectors without\nrequiring retraining. When integrated with powerful 2D open-world models, it\nachieves excellent results in scene understanding tasks. Furthermore, when\ncombined with LLM-powered 2D models, OpenIns3D exhibits an impressive\ncapability to comprehend and process highly complex text queries that demand\nintricate reasoning and real-world knowledge.

                "summary": "The gas-phase abundance of carbon, x_C = C/H, and its depletion factors are\nessential parameters for understanding the gas and solid compositions that are\nultimately incorporated into planets. The majority of protoplanetary disks are\nborn in clusters and, as a result, are exposed to external FUV radiation. These\nFUV photons potentially affect the disk's evolution, chemical composition, and\nline excitation. We present the first detection of the [CI]609um fine-structure\nline of neutral carbon (CI), achieved with ALMA, toward one of these disks,\nd203-506, in the Orion Nebula Cluster. We also report the detection of CI\nforbidden and permitted lines (from electronically excited states up to 10 eV)\nobserved with JWST in the IR. These lines trace the irradiated outer disk and\nphoto-evaporative wind. Contrary to the common belief that these IR lines are\nC+ recombination lines, we find that they are dominated by FUV-pumping of CI\nfollowed by fluorescence cascades. They trace the transition from atomic to\nmolecular gas, and their intensities scale with G0. The lack of outstanding IR\nOI fluorescent emission, however, implies a sharper attenuation of external FUV\nradiation with E > 12 eV (~Lyman-beta). This is related to a lower effective\nFUV dust absorption cross section compared to that of interstellar grains,\nimplying a more prominent role for FUV shielding by the CI photoionization\ncontinuum. The [CI]609um intensity is proportional to N(CI) and can be used to\ninfer x_C. We derive x_C ~ 1.4E-4. This implies that there is no major\ndepletion of volatile carbon compared to x_C measured in the natal cloud,\nhinting at a young disk. We also show that external FUV radiation impacts the\nouter disk and wind by vertically shifting the water freeze-out depth, which\nresults in less efficient grain growth and settling. This shift leads to nearly\nsolar gas-phase C/O abundance ratios in these irradiated layers.",

In this work,\nwe introduce the first question-answering (QA) model and its application that\nprovides information to the cybersecurity experts about cyber-attacks\ninvestigations and attribution. Our QA model is based on Retrieval Augmented\nGeneration (RAG) techniques together with a Large Language Model (LLM) and\nprovides answers to the users' queries based on either our knowledge base (KB)\nthat contains curated information about cyber-attacks investigations and\nattribution or on outside resources provided by the users. We have tested and\nevaluated our QA model with various types of questions, including KB-based,\nmetadata-based, specific documents from the KB, and external sources-based\nquestions. We compared the answers for KB-based questions with those from\nOpenAI's GPT-3.5 and the latest GPT-4o LLMs. Our proposed QA model outperforms\nOpenAI's GPT models by providing the source of the answers and overcoming the\nhallucination limitations of the GPT models, which is critical for cyber-attack\ninvestigation and attribution. Additionally, our analysis showed that when the\nRAG QA model is given few-shot examples rather than zero-shot instructions, it\ngenerates better answers compared to cases where no examples are supplied in\naddition to the query.",

In this work,\nwe introduce the first question-answering (QA) model and its application that\nprovides information to the cybersecurity experts about cyber-attacks\ninvestigations and attribution. Our QA model is based on Retrieval Augmented\nGeneration (RAG) techniques together with a Large Language Model (LLM) and\nprovides answers to the users' queries based on either our knowledge base (KB)\nthat contains curated information about cyber-attacks investigations and\nattribution or on outside resources provided by the users. We have tested and\nevaluated our QA model with various types of questions, including KB-based,\nmetadata-based, specific documents from the KB, and external sources-based\nquestions. We compared the answers for KB-based questions with those from\nOpenAI's GPT-3.5 and the latest GPT-4o LLMs. Our proposed QA model outperforms\nOpenAI's GPT models by providing the source of the answers and overcoming the\nhallucination limitations of the GPT models, which is critical for cyber-attack\ninvestigation and attribution. Additionally, our analysis showed that when the\nRAG QA model is given few-shot examples rather than zero-shot instructions, it\ngenerates better answers compared to cases where no examples are supplied in\naddition to the query."

This paper proposes a novel approach to identify and estimate\ncausal effects in the presence of endogeneity. We consider a structural\nequation with endogenous exposures and an additive error term. Assuming the\nlight-tailedness of the error term, we show that the causal effect can be\nidentified by contrasting extreme conditional quantiles of the outcome given\nthe exposures. Unlike many existing results, our identification approach does\nnot rely on additional parametric assumptions or auxiliary variables. Building\non the identification result, we develop an EXtreme-based Causal Effect\nLearning (EXCEL) method that estimates the causal effect using extreme quantile\nregression. We establish the consistency of the EXCEL estimator under a general\nadditive structural equation and demonstrate its asymptotic normality in the\nlinear model setting. These results reveal that extreme quantile regression is\ninvulnerable to endogeneity when the error term is light-tailed, which is not\nappreciated in the literature to our knowledge. The EXCEL method is applied to\ncausal inference problems with invalid instruments to construct a valid\nconfidence set for the causal effect. Simulations and data analysis of an\nautomobile sale dataset show the effectiveness of our method in addressing\nendogeneity.",

This approach allows us, for the first time\nin the context of cluster finding, to carefully assess the impact of the\ncluster-correlated CIB on the recovered cluster tSZ observables, which we find\nto be negligible. In addition, we quantify the impact of the relativistic\ncorrections to the tSZ signal, finding them to be at the 5-10% level for the\ncluster tSZ amplitude but negligible for the signal-to-noise. We compile our\ncatalogues into a single Planck SZiFi master catalogue containing a total of\n1499 detections.

However, these systems\nare often viewed as outdated, requiring extensive maintenance and\nmodernization. Addressing this challenge necessitates innovative tools that can\nunderstand and interact with legacy codebases. To this end, we introduce\nXMainframe, a state-of-the-art large language model (LLM) specifically designed\nwith knowledge of mainframe legacy systems and COBOL codebases. Our solution\ninvolves the creation of an extensive data collection pipeline to produce\nhigh-quality training datasets, enhancing XMainframe's performance in this\nspecialized domain.

In parallel,\nsophisticated radiative transfer models account for attenuation and emission by\nthe Earth's atmosphere and ocean, thereby estimating the water-leaving radiance\nor and remote-sensing reflectance Rrs. From these Rrs measurements, estimates\nof the absorption and scattering by seawater are inferred. We emphasize an\ninherent, physical degeneracy in the radiative transfer equation that relates\nRrs to the absorption and backscattering coefficients a and b_b, aka inherent\noptical properties (IOPs). Because Rrs depends solely on the ratio of b_b to a,\nmeaning one cannot retrieve independent functions for the non-water IOPs, a_nw\nand b_bnw, without a priori knowledge. Moreover, water generally dominates\nscattering at blue wavelengths and absorption at red wavelengths, further\nlimiting retrievals of IOPs in the presence of noise. We demonstrate that all\nprevious and current multi-spectral satellite observations lack the statistical\npower to measure more than 3 parameters total to describe a_nw and b_bnw. Due\nto the ubiquitous exponential-like absorption by color dissolved organic matter\nat short wavelengths (l<500nm), multi-spectral Rrs do not permit the detection\nof phytoplankton absorption a_ph without very strict priors. Furthermore, such\npriors lead to biased and uncertain retrievals of a_ph. Hyperspectral\nobservations may recover a 4th and possibly 5th parameter describing only one\nor two aspects of the complexity of a_ph.

We infer the stratification of the temperature, the\nelectron density, the line of-sight velocity, the micro-turbulent velocity, and\nthe longitudinal component of the magnetic field from the observed intensity\nand circular polarization profiles. The inferred model atmosphere shows larger\ntemperature and electron density in the plage and the superpenumbra regions\nthan in the quiet regions. The shape of the plage region in terms of its\nbrightness is similar to the pattern of the inferred longitudinal component of\nthe magnetic field in the chromosphere, as well as to that of the overlying\nmoss observed by AIA in the 171 A band, which suggests a similar magnetic\norigin for the heating in both the plage and the moss region. Moreover, this\nheating is particularly significant in the regions with larger inferred\nmagnetic flux. In contrast, in the superpenumbra, the regions with larger\nelectron density and temperature are usually found in between these regions\nwith larger magnetic flux, suggesting that the details of the heating mechanism\nin the chromosphere of the superpenumbra may be different to those in the\nplage, but with the magnetic field still playing a key role.",

Prior works attempt to capture local\nrelationships by convolution operations or attention mechanisms, exploiting\ngeometric information from coordinates implicitly. These methods, however, are\ninsufficient to describe the explicit local geometry, e.g., curvature and\norientation. In this paper, we propose On-the-fly Point Feature Representation\n(OPFR), which captures abundant geometric information explicitly through Curve\nFeature Generator module. This is inspired by Point Feature Histogram (PFH)\nfrom computer vision community. However, the utilization of vanilla PFH\nencounters great difficulties when applied to large datasets and dense point\nclouds, as it demands considerable time for feature generation. In contrast, we\nintroduce the Local Reference Constructor module, which approximates the local\ncoordinate systems based on triangle sets. Owing to this, our OPFR only\nrequires extra 1.56ms for inference (65x faster than vanilla PFH) and 0.012M\nmore parameters, and it can serve as a versatile plug-and-play module for\nvarious backbones, particularly MLP-based and Transformer-based backbones\nexamined in this study. Additionally, we introduce the novel Hierarchical\nSampling module aimed at enhancing the quality of triangle sets, thereby\nensuring robustness of the obtained geometric features. Our proposed method\nimproves overall accuracy (OA) on ModelNet40 from 90.7% to 94.5% (+3.8%) for\nclassification, and OA on S3DIS Area-5 from 86.4% to 90.0% (+3.6%) for semantic\nsegmentation, respectively, building upon PointNet++ backbone. When integrated\nwith Point Transformer backbone, we achieve state-of-the-art results on both\ntasks: 94.8% OA on ModelNet40 and 91.7% OA on S3DIS Area-5.",

Considering the redundancy in natural\nlanguage, existing approaches compress prompts by removing tokens or lexical\nunits according to their information entropy obtained from a causal language\nmodel such as LLaMa-7B. The challenge is that information entropy may be a\nsuboptimal compression metric: (i) it only leverages unidirectional context and\nmay fail to capture all essential information needed for prompt compression;\n(ii) it is not aligned with the prompt compression objective.\n  To address these issues, we propose a data distillation procedure to derive\nknowledge from an LLM to compress prompts without losing crucial information,\nand meantime, introduce an extractive text compression dataset. We formulate\nprompt compression as a token classification problem to guarantee the\nfaithfulness of the compressed prompt to the original one, and use a\nTransformer encoder as the base architecture to capture all essential\ninformation for prompt compression from the full bidirectional context. Our\napproach leads to lower latency by explicitly learning the compression\nobjective with smaller models such as XLM-RoBERTa-large and mBERT.\n  We evaluate our method on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets,\nincluding MeetingBank, LongBench, ZeroScrolls, GSM8K, and BBH. Despite its\nsmall size, our model shows significant performance gains over strong baselines\nand demonstrates robust generalization ability across different LLMs.\nAdditionally, our model is 3x-6x faster than existing prompt compression\nmethods, while accelerating the end-to-end latency by 1.6x-2.9x with\ncompression ratios of 2x-5x.

To address this issue, we introduce \\textbf{Part Aware\nTransformer (PAFormer)}, a pose estimation based ReID model which can perform\nprecise part-to-part comparison.

Additionally, leveraging the\nenhanced awareness of body parts, PAFormer suggests the use of a learning-based\nvisibility predictor to estimate the degree of occlusion for each body part.\nAlso, we introduce a teacher forcing technique using ground truth visibility\nscores which enables PAFormer to be trained only with visible parts.

Our study explores the use of Transformer models\nto capture long-range information in spectra, comparing their performance to\nThe Payne emulator (a fully connected multilayer perceptron), an expanded\nversion of The Payne, and a convolutional-based emulator. We tested these\nmodels on synthetic spectra grids, evaluating their performance by analyzing\nemulation residuals and assessing the quality of spectral parameter inference.\nThe newly introduced TransformerPayne emulator outperformed all other tested\nmodels, achieving a mean absolute error (MAE) of approximately 0.15% when\ntrained on the full grid. The most significant improvements were observed in\ngrids containing between 1000 and 10,000 spectra, with TransformerPayne showing\n2 to 5 times better performance than the scaled-up version of The Payne.\nAdditionally, TransformerPayne demonstrated superior fine-tuning capabilities,\nallowing for pretraining on one spectral model grid before transferring to\nanother. This fine-tuning approach enabled up to a tenfold reduction in\ntraining grid size compared to models trained from scratch. Analysis of\nTransformerPayne's attention maps revealed that they encode interpretable\nfeatures common across many spectral lines of chosen elements. While scaling up\nThe Payne to a larger network reduced its MAE from 1.2% to 0.3% when trained on\nthe full dataset, TransformerPayne consistently achieved the lowest MAE across\nall tests.

                    "value": "Stellar spectra emulators often rely on large grids and tend to reach a\nplateau in emulation accuracy, leading to significant systematic errors when\ninferring stellar properties. Our study explores the use of Transformer models\nto capture long-range information in spectra, comparing their performance to\nThe Payne emulator (a fully connected multilayer perceptron), an expanded\nversion of The Payne, and a convolutional-based emulator. We tested these\nmodels on synthetic spectra grids, evaluating their performance by analyzing\nemulation residuals and assessing the quality of spectral parameter inference.\nThe newly introduced TransformerPayne emulator outperformed all other tested\nmodels, achieving a mean absolute error (MAE) of approximately 0.15% when\ntrained on the full grid. The most significant improvements were observed in\ngrids containing between 1000 and 10,000 spectra, with TransformerPayne showing\n2 to 5 times better performance than the scaled-up version of The Payne.\nAdditionally, TransformerPayne demonstrated superior fine-tuning capabilities,\nallowing for pretraining on one spectral model grid before transferring to\nanother. This fine-tuning approach enabled up to a tenfold reduction in\ntraining grid size compared to models trained from scratch. Analysis of\nTransformerPayne's attention maps revealed that they encode interpretable\nfeatures common across many spectral lines of chosen elements. While scaling up\nThe Payne to a larger network reduced its MAE from 1.2% to 0.3% when trained on\nthe full dataset, TransformerPayne consistently achieved the lowest MAE across\nall tests. The inductive biases of the TransformerPayne emulator enhance\naccuracy, data efficiency, and interpretability for spectral emulation compared\nto existing methods."

The flexible nature of\nthese models allows them to be used for many applications. In this paper, we\npresent a novel study of large language models used for the challenging task of\ntime series anomaly detection. This problem entails two aspects novel for LLMs:\nthe need for the model to identify part of the input sequence (or multiple\nparts) as anomalous; and the need for it to work with time series data rather\nthan the traditional text input. We introduce sigllm, a framework for time\nseries anomaly detection using large language models. Our framework includes a\ntime-series-to-text conversion module, as well as end-to-end pipelines that\nprompt language models to perform time series anomaly detection. We investigate\ntwo paradigms for testing the abilities of large language models to perform the\ndetection task. First, we present a prompt-based detection method that directly\nasks a language model to indicate which elements of the input are anomalies.\nSecond, we leverage the forecasting capability of a large language model to\nguide the anomaly detection process. We evaluated our framework on 11 datasets\nspanning various sources and 10 pipelines. We show that the forecasting method\nsignificantly outperformed the prompting method in all 11 datasets with respect\nto the F1 score. Moreover, while large language models are capable of finding\nanomalies, state-of-the-art deep learning models are still superior in\nperformance, achieving results 30% better than large language models.",

In this work,\nwe introduce the first question-answering (QA) model and its application that\nprovides information to the cybersecurity experts about cyber-attacks\ninvestigations and attribution. Our QA model is based on Retrieval Augmented\nGeneration (RAG) techniques together with a Large Language Model (LLM) and\nprovides answers to the users' queries based on either our knowledge base (KB)\nthat contains curated information about cyber-attacks investigations and\nattribution or on outside resources provided by the users. We have tested and\nevaluated our QA model with various types of questions, including KB-based,\nmetadata-based, specific documents from the KB, and external sources-based\nquestions. We compared the answers for KB-based questions with those from\nOpenAI's GPT-3.5 and the latest GPT-4o LLMs. Our proposed QA model outperforms\nOpenAI's GPT models by providing the source of the answers and overcoming the\nhallucination limitations of the GPT models, which is critical for cyber-attack\ninvestigation and attribution. Additionally, our analysis showed that when the\nRAG QA model is given few-shot examples rather than zero-shot instructions, it\ngenerates better answers compared to cases where no examples are supplied in\naddition to the query.",

In this work,\nwe introduce the first question-answering (QA) model and its application that\nprovides information to the cybersecurity experts about cyber-attacks\ninvestigations and attribution. Our QA model is based on Retrieval Augmented\nGeneration (RAG) techniques together with a Large Language Model (LLM) and\nprovides answers to the users' queries based on either our knowledge base (KB)\nthat contains curated information about cyber-attacks investigations and\nattribution or on outside resources provided by the users. We have tested and\nevaluated our QA model with various types of questions, including KB-based,\nmetadata-based, specific documents from the KB, and external sources-based\nquestions. We compared the answers for KB-based questions with those from\nOpenAI's GPT-3.5 and the latest GPT-4o LLMs. Our proposed QA model outperforms\nOpenAI's GPT models by providing the source of the answers and overcoming the\nhallucination limitations of the GPT models, which is critical for cyber-attack\ninvestigation and attribution. Additionally, our analysis showed that when the\nRAG QA model is given few-shot examples rather than zero-shot instructions, it\ngenerates better answers compared to cases where no examples are supplied in\naddition to the query."

This\ntechnology holds immense potential for biometrics, including for securing\nsensitive and personally identifiable information. Given the irrevocability of\nbiometric samples and mounting privacy concerns, biometric template security\nand secure matching are among the most sought-after features of modern\nbiometric systems. This paper proposes a novel obfuscation method using\nGenerative AI to enhance biometric template security. Our approach utilizes\nsynthetic facial images generated by a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) as\n\"random chaff points\" within a secure vault system. Our method creates n\nsub-templates from the original template, each obfuscated with m GAN chaff\npoints. During verification, s closest vectors to the biometric query are\nretrieved from each vault and combined to generate hash values, which are then\ncompared with the stored hash value. Thus, our method safeguards user\nidentities during the training and deployment phases by employing the\nGAN-generated synthetic images. Our protocol was tested using the AT&T, GT, and\nLFW face datasets, achieving ROC areas under the curve of 0.99, 0.99, and 0.90,\nrespectively. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method can maintain\nhigh accuracy and reasonable computational complexity comparable to those\nunprotected template methods while significantly enhancing security and\nprivacy, underscoring the potential of Generative AI in developing proactive\ndefensive strategies for biometric systems.",

However, inconsistencies between the features promoted in\nfront-end descriptions and those actually implemented in the contract can\nconfuse users and undermine DApps's trustworthiness. In this paper, we first\nconducted an empirical study to identify seven types of inconsistencies, each\nexemplified by a real-world DApp. Furthermore, we introduce HYPERION, an\napproach designed to automatically identify inconsistencies between front-end\ndescriptions and back-end code implementation in DApps. This method leverages a\nfine-tuned large language model LLaMA2 to analyze DApp descriptions and employs\ndataflow-guided symbolic execution for contract bytecode analysis. Finally,\nHYPERION reports the inconsistency based on predefined detection patterns. The\nexperiment on our ground truth dataset consisting of 54 DApps shows that\nHYPERION reaches 84.06% overall recall and 92.06% overall precision in\nreporting DApp inconsistencies. We also implement HYPERION to analyze 835\nreal-world DApps. The experimental results show that HYPERION discovers 459\nreal-world DApps containing at least one inconsistency.",

This\nsynergy between generation and repair elevates the quality, effectiveness, and\nreadability of the produced test cases significantly beyond previous methods.\nIn comparative experiments, the pass rate of TestART-generated test cases is\n78.55%, which is approximately 18% higher than both the ChatGPT-4.0 model and\nthe same ChatGPT-3.5-based method ChatUniTest. It also achieves an impressive\nline coverage rate of 90.96% on the focal methods that passed the test,\nexceeding EvoSuite by 3.4%."

Among these, brand-based phishing detection\nthat uses models from Computer Vision to detect if a given webpage is imitating\na well-known brand has received widespread attention. However, such models are\ncostly and difficult to maintain, as they need to be retrained with labeled\ndataset that has to be regularly and continuously collected.

We carry\nout comprehensive evaluations on a newly collected dataset. Our experiments\nshow that the LLM-based system achieves a high detection rate at high\nprecision; importantly, it also provides interpretable evidence for the\ndecisions.

Considering the redundancy in natural\nlanguage, existing approaches compress prompts by removing tokens or lexical\nunits according to their information entropy obtained from a causal language\nmodel such as LLaMa-7B. The challenge is that information entropy may be a\nsuboptimal compression metric: (i) it only leverages unidirectional context and\nmay fail to capture all essential information needed for prompt compression;\n(ii) it is not aligned with the prompt compression objective.\n  To address these issues, we propose a data distillation procedure to derive\nknowledge from an LLM to compress prompts without losing crucial information,\nand meantime, introduce an extractive text compression dataset. We formulate\nprompt compression as a token classification problem to guarantee the\nfaithfulness of the compressed prompt to the original one, and use a\nTransformer encoder as the base architecture to capture all essential\ninformation for prompt compression from the full bidirectional context. Our\napproach leads to lower latency by explicitly learning the compression\nobjective with smaller models such as XLM-RoBERTa-large and mBERT.\n  We evaluate our method on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets,\nincluding MeetingBank, LongBench, ZeroScrolls, GSM8K, and BBH. Despite its\nsmall size, our model shows significant performance gains over strong baselines\nand demonstrates robust generalization ability across different LLMs.\nAdditionally, our model is 3x-6x faster than existing prompt compression\nmethods, while accelerating the end-to-end latency by 1.6x-2.9x with\ncompression ratios of 2x-5x.

The\nstudy also serves as the first effort to investigate the changes in public\nopinion as AI technologies become more advanced and intelligent. The analysis\nreveals that, upon first encounters with advanced AI that was not yet highly\ncapable, some social media users believed that AI advancements would benefit\neducation and society, while others feared that advanced AI, like ChatGPT,\nwould make humans feel inferior and lead to problems such as cheating and a\ndecline in moral principles. The majority of users remained neutral.\nInterestingly, with the rapid development and improvement of AI capabilities,\npublic attitudes have tended to shift in a positive direction.

Although facing accessibility challenges, we\nfound that the number of discussions on ChatGPT per month is 16 times that of\nErnie Bot developed by Baidu, the most popular alternative product to ChatGPT\nin the mainland, making ChatGPT a more suitable subject for our analysis. The\nstudy also serves as the first effort to investigate the changes in public\nopinion as AI technologies become more advanced and intelligent. The analysis\nreveals that, upon first encounters with advanced AI that was not yet highly\ncapable, some social media users believed that AI advancements would benefit\neducation and society, while others feared that advanced AI, like ChatGPT,\nwould make humans feel inferior and lead to problems such as cheating and a\ndecline in moral principles. The majority of users remained neutral.\nInterestingly, with the rapid development and improvement of AI capabilities,\npublic attitudes have tended to shift in a positive direction. We present a\nthorough analysis of the trending shift and a roadmap to ensure the ethical\napplication of ChatGPT-like models in education and beyond."

We introduce sigllm, a framework for time\nseries anomaly detection using large language models. Our framework includes a\ntime-series-to-text conversion module, as well as end-to-end pipelines that\nprompt language models to perform time series anomaly detection. We investigate\ntwo paradigms for testing the abilities of large language models to perform the\ndetection task. First, we present a prompt-based detection method that directly\nasks a language model to indicate which elements of the input are anomalies.\nSecond, we leverage the forecasting capability of a large language model to\nguide the anomaly detection process. We evaluated our framework on 11 datasets\nspanning various sources and 10 pipelines. We show that the forecasting method\nsignificantly outperformed the prompting method in all 11 datasets with respect\nto the F1 score.

Critically, no distance or neighborhood calculations are performed,\ninstead leveraging pure combinatorics and the ordering in procedurally\ngenerated simplex grids, keeping the algorithm $\\mathcal{O}(N)$, so that graphs\nwith billions of transitions take seconds to construct on a laptop.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate how such graph representations can be combined to\nexpress path-planning problem spaces and to incorporate prior knowledge while\nkeeping the problem space homogeneous. This allows for efficient deployment of\nexisting high-performance gradient descent, graph traversal search, and other\npath optimization algorithms."

Fortunately, some\nmethods such as pruning or constructing a mixture of experts (MoE) aim at\nexploiting sparsity in transformer feedforward (FF) blocks to gain boosts in\nspeed and reduction in memory requirements. However, these techniques can be\nvery costly and inflexible in practice, as they often require training or are\nrestricted to specific types of architectures. To address this, we introduce\nGRIFFIN, a novel training-free and calibration-free method that selects unique\nFF experts at the sequence level for efficient generation across a plethora of\nLLMs with different non-ReLU activation functions. This is possible due to a\ncritical observation that many trained LLMs naturally produce highly structured\nFF activation patterns within a sequence, which we call flocking. Despite our\nmethod's simplicity, we show with 50% of the FF parameters, GRIFFIN maintains\nthe original model's performance with little to no degradation on a variety of\nclassification and generation tasks, all while improving latency (e.g.\n1.29$\\times$ and 1.25$\\times$ speed-ups in Gemma 7B and Llama 2 13B,\nrespectively, on an NVIDIA L40).

The SQLReviewer\nagent employs the rubber duck debugging method to identify potential semantic\nmismatches between SQL and user query. If the error is detected, the\nQueryCrafter agent generates multiple SQL as candidate repairs using a\nfine-tuned SQLTool. Subsequently, leveraging similar repair retrieval and\nfailure memory reflection, the SQLRefiner agent selects the most fitting SQL\nstatement from the candidates as the final repair. We evaluated our proposed\nframework on five Text-to-SQL benchmarks. The experimental results show that\nour method consistently enhances the performance of the baseline model,\nspecifically achieving an execution accuracy improvement of over 3\\% on the\nBird benchmark. Our framework also has a higher token efficiency compared to\nother advanced methods, making it more competitive.",

Although existing research allows edge devices\nto use subnets with different computational budgets for inference, they often\nrequire expensive pre-training and do not consider the issues of parameter\nprecision redundancy in the model, which is not conducive to the deployment of\nthe model on edge devices. In this paper, we introduce a ReTraining-Free\nQuantized (RTF-Q) network based on unsupervised domain adaptation, featuring\nquantized subnets of varying computational costs that can operate on devices\nwith dynamically changing computation budgets. Our network has three switchable\ndimensions: width (number of channels), input resolution, and quantization\nbit-width. Specifically, we choose subnet dimensions that have minimal impact\non network performance and then directly load the official weight files without\nrequiring expensive and time-consuming pre-training on Imagenet-1K. To further\nreduce the network's computational load and memory usage, we use\nquantization-aware training, reducing the BitOPs of full-precision networks by\nat least 1/16. We propose a training method called SandwichQ for multiple\nquantization bit widths, which can efficiently train multiple quantization\nsubnets. By training in multiple quantization bit-width spaces simultaneously\nand using the proposed SandwichQ rule, we achieve better network performance\ncompared to using a single quantization bit-width alone. Experimental results\nshow that our method achieves classification accuracy comparable to SOTA\nmethods on various UDA tasks, significantly reducing network size and\ncomputational overhead.

Existing\nmethods mainly focus on aligning vision encoders with LLMs through supervised\nfine-tuning (SFT) to endow LLMs with multimodal abilities, making MLLMs'\ninherent ability to react to multiple languages progressively deteriorate as\nthe training process evolves. We empirically find that the imbalanced SFT\ndatasets, primarily composed of English-centric image-text pairs, lead to\nsignificantly reduced performance in non-English languages. This is due to the\nfailure of aligning the vision encoder and LLM with multilingual tokens during\nthe SFT process. In this paper, we introduce Parrot, a novel method that\nutilizes textual guidance to drive visual token alignment at the language\nlevel. Parrot makes the visual tokens condition on diverse language inputs and\nuses Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) to promote the alignment of multilingual tokens.\nSpecifically, to enhance non-English visual tokens alignment, we compute the\ncross-attention using the initial visual features and textual embeddings, the\nresult of which is then fed into the MoE router to select the most relevant\nexperts. The selected experts subsequently convert the initial visual tokens\ninto language-specific visual tokens. Moreover, considering the current lack of\nbenchmarks for evaluating multilingual capabilities within the field, we\ncollect and make available a Massive Multilingual Multimodal Benchmark which\nincludes 6 languages, 15 categories, and 12,000 questions, named as MMMB. Our\nmethod not only demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on multilingual\nMMBench and MMMB, but also excels across a broad range of multimodal tasks.\nBoth the source code and the training dataset of Parrot will be made publicly\navailable.

Driving simulators have emerged as crucial platforms for\ntesting autonomous driving systems, offering realistic, dynamic, and\nconfigurable environments. However, existing simulation-based ADS testers have\nlargely overlooked the reliability of the simulators, potentially leading to\noverlooked violation scenarios and subsequent safety security risks during\nreal-world deployment. In our investigations, we identified that collision\ndetectors in simulators could fail to detect and report collisions in certain\ncollision scenarios, referred to as ignored collision scenarios.\n  This paper aims to systematically discover ignored collision scenarios to\nimprove the reliability of autonomous driving simulators. To this end, we\npresent ICSFuzz, a black-box fuzzing approach to discover ignored collision\nscenarios efficiently. Drawing upon the fact that the ignored collision\nscenarios are a sub-type of collision scenarios, our approach starts with the\ndetermined collision scenarios. Following the guidance provided by empirically\nstudied factors contributing to collisions, we selectively mutate arbitrary\ncollision scenarios in a step-wise manner toward the ignored collision\nscenarios and effectively discover them.\n  We compare ICSFuzz with DriveFuzz, a state-of-the-art simulation-based ADS\ntesting method, by replacing its oracle with our ignored-collision-aware\noracle. The evaluation demonstrates that ICSFuzz outperforms DriveFuzz by\nfinding 10-20x more ignored collision scenarios with a 20-70x speedup. All the\ndiscovered ignored collisions have been confirmed by developers with one CVE ID\nassigned.",
