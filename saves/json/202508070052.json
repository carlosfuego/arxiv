However, their low inference speed limits their\ndeployment in low-resource applications. Recent training-free approaches\nexploit the redundancy of features across timesteps by caching and reusing past\nrepresentations to accelerate inference. Building on this idea, TaylorSeer\ninstead uses cached features to predict future ones via Taylor expansion.\nHowever, its module-level prediction across all transformer blocks (e.g.,\nattention or feedforward modules) requires storing fine-grained intermediate\nfeatures, leading to notable memory and computation overhead. Moreover, it\nadopts a fixed caching schedule without considering the varying accuracy of\npredictions across timesteps, which can lead to degraded outputs when\nprediction fails. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach to\nbetter leverage Taylor-based acceleration. First, we shift the Taylor\nprediction target from the module level to the last block level, significantly\nreducing the number of cached features. Furthermore, observing strong\nsequential dependencies among Transformer blocks, we propose to use the error\nbetween the Taylor-estimated and actual outputs of the first block as an\nindicator of prediction reliability.

The system revenue depends on the benefits of delivering the requested\nvideos and costs for (a) transporting the files to the users and (b) cache\nreplacement. Since the cache content at any point in time impacts the\nreplacement costs in the future, demand predictions over multiple cache\nplacement slots become an important prerequisite for efficient cache planning.\nMotivated by this, we introduce a novel two-stage privacy-preserving solution\nfor revenue optimization in wireless video caching networks. First, we train a\nTransformer using privacy-preserving federated learning (FL) to predict\nmulti-slot future demands. Given that prediction results are never entirely\naccurate, especially for longer horizons, we further combine global content\npopularity with per-user prediction results to estimate the content demand\ndistribution. Then, in the second stage, we leverage these estimation results\nto find caching strategies that maximize the long-term system revenue. This\nlatter problem takes on the form of a multi-stage knapsack problem, which we\nthen transform to a integer linear program. Our extensive simulation results\ndemonstrate that (i) our FL solution delivers nearly identical performance to\nthat of the ideal centralized solution and outperforms other existing caching\nmethods, and (ii) our novel revenue optimization approach provides deeper\nsystem performance insights than traditional cache hit ratio (CHR)-based\noptimization approaches.",

To address these issues, we design two\ncompensation mechanisms based on the high similarity of attention matrices\nbetween LLMs of different scales.

In addition,\nwe construct pitch-shifted pairs by translating and cropping the VQT frames and\ntrain our model with a novel class-based transposition-equivariant objective,\neliminating the need for annotated data. Thanks to this architecture and\ntraining objective, our model achieves remarkable performances while being very\nlightweight ($130$k parameters). Evaluations on music and speech datasets\n(MIR-1K, MDB-stem-synth, and PTDB) demonstrate that PESTO not only outperforms\nself-supervised baselines but also competes with supervised methods, exhibiting\nsuperior cross-dataset generalization. Finally, we enhance PESTO's practical\nutility by developing a streamable VQT implementation using cached\nconvolutions. Combined with our model's low latency (less than 10 ms) and\nminimal parameter count, this makes PESTO particularly suitable for real-time\napplications.",

We tested precision regulated High Voltage DC/DC Converters by\nHVM Technology Inc. with Sub-Miniature Case Size\n($0.85''\\times0.85''\\times0.60''$) of the SMHV series. These modules are\ncompact and suited for CubeSat missions."

We further optimized EdgeInfinite-Instruct for efficient\ndeployment on edge NPUs by employing fine-grained post-training quantization\n(PTQ) to reduce computational demands while maintaining accuracy, and by\nimplementing a fixed-shape computation graph that balances memory usage and\non-device efficiency through scenario-specific customization of input token and\ncache sizes. Experiments on long-context benchmarks and real-world mobile tasks\nshow that our approach improves domain-specific performance while maintaining\nefficiency on NPU-accelerated edge devices."

In this work, we propose OmniDraft, a unified framework that\nenables a single draft model to operate with any target model and adapt\ndynamically to user data. We introduce an online n-gram cache with hybrid\ndistillation fine-tuning to address the cross-vocabulary mismatch across draft\nand target models; and further improve decoding speed by leveraging adaptive\ndrafting techniques. OmniDraft is particularly suitable for on-device LLM\napplications where model cost, efficiency and user customization are the major\npoints of contention. This further highlights the need to tackle the above\nchallenges and motivates the \\textit{``one drafter for all''} paradigm. We\nshowcase the proficiency of the OmniDraft framework by performing online\nlearning on math reasoning, coding and text generation tasks.

In our experiments, LongVILA-R1-7B achieves\nstrong performance on video benchmarks, reaching 65.1% and 71.1% accuracy on\nVideoMME without and with subtitles, respectively, and consistently\noutperforming LongVILA-7B across multiple benchmarks. Moreover, LongVILA-R1-7B\nsupports processing up to 8,192 video frames per video, and configurable FPS\nsettings. Notably, our MR-SP system achieves up to 2.1x speedup on long video\nRL training. In addition, we release our training system for public\navailability that supports RL training on various modalities (video, text, and\naudio), various models (VILA and Qwen series), and even image and video\ngeneration models.

To overcome these limitations, instead of direct\nmodification of transition kernel, HDT introduces a history-dependent target\ndistribution $\\boldsymbol{\\pi}[\\mathbf{x}]$ to replace the original target\n$\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$ in any graph sampler, where $\\mathbf{x}$ represents the\nempirical measure of past visits. This design preserves lightweight\nimplementation by requiring only local information between the current and\nproposed states and achieves compatibility with both reversible and\nnon-reversible MCMC samplers, while retaining unbiased samples with target\ndistribution $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$ and near-zero variance performance. Extensive\nexperiments in graph sampling demonstrate consistent performance gains, and a\nmemory-efficient Least Recently Used (LRU) cache ensures scalability to large\ngeneral graphs."

Step-3 innovates in two key dimensions: (1) A novel\nMulti-Matrix Factorization Attention (MFA) mechanism that significantly reduces\nboth KV cache size and computation while maintaining high attention\nexpressiveness, and (2) Attention-FFN Disaggregation (AFD), a distributed\ninference system that decouples attention and Feed-Forward Network (FFN) layers\ninto specialized subsystems. This co-design achieves unprecedented cost\nefficiency: Step-3 significantly reduces theoretical decoding costs compared\nwith models like DeepSeek-V3 and Qwen3 MoE 235B, with the gains widening at\nlonger context. Step-3 achieves low cost while activating 38B parameters per\ntoken (more than DeepSeek-V3 and Qwen3 MoE 235B), demonstrating that\nhardware-aligned attention arithmetic intensity, MoE sparsity, and AFD are\ncritical to cost-effectiveness. We perform a head-to-head comparison with\nDeepSeek-V3 in its favorable scenarios. Our implementation on Hopper GPUs\nachieves a decoding throughput of up to 4,039 tokens per second per GPU under\n50ms TPOT SLA (4K context, FP8, no MTP). It is higher than DeepSeek-V3's 2,324\nin the same setup and sets a new Pareto frontier for LLM decoding.",

Unlike conventional speaker-tracing buffers, AOSC orders embeddings\nby speaker index corresponding to their arrival time order, and is dynamically\nupdated by selecting frames with the highest scores based on the model's past\npredictions. Notably, the number of stored embeddings per speaker is determined\ndynamically by the update mechanism, ensuring efficient cache utilization and\nprecise speaker tracking. Experiments on benchmark datasets confirm the\neffectiveness and flexibility of our approach, even in low-latency setups.\nThese results establish Streaming Sortformer as a robust solution for real-time\nmulti-speaker tracking and a foundation for streaming multi-talker speech\nprocessing.",

As a result, serverless is becoming\nincreasingly popular to support highly elastic and bursty workloads. However,\nexisting platforms are supported by bloated virtualization stacks, which,\ncombined with bursty and irregular invocations, lead to high memory and latency\noverheads.\n  To reduce the virtualization stack bloat, we propose Hydra, a virtualized\nmulti-language runtime and platform capable of hosting multiple sandboxes\nrunning concurrently. To fully leverage Hydra's virtualized runtime, we revisit\nthe existing serverless platform design to make it colocation-aware across\nowners and functions, and to feature a caching layer of pre-allocated Hydra\ninstances that can be used by different functions written in different\nlanguages to reduce cold starts. We also propose a snapshotting mechanism to\ncheckpoint and restore individual sandboxes.\n  By consolidating multiple serverless function invocations through Hydra, we\nimprove the overall function density (ops/GB-sec) by 2.41x on average compared\nto OpenWhisk runtimes, the state-of-the-art single-language runtimes used in\nmost serverless platforms, and by 1.43x on average compared to Knative runtimes\nsupporting invocation colocation within the same function. When reproducing the\nAzure Functions trace, our serverless platform operating Hydra instances\nreduces the overall memory footprint by 21.3-43.9% compared to operating\nOpenWhisk instances and by 14.5-30% compared to operating Knative instances.\nHydra eliminates cold starts thanks to the pool of pre-warmed runtime\ninstances, reducing p99 latency by 45.3-375.5x compared to OpenWhisk and by\n1.9-51.4x compared to Knative.",

Lizard addresses these limitations by introducing a subquadratic\nattention mechanism that closely approximates softmax attention while\npreserving the output quality. Unlike previous linearization methods, which are\noften limited by fixed model structures and therefore exclude gating\nmechanisms, Lizard incorporates a gating module inspired by recent\nstate-of-the-art linear models. This enables adaptive memory control, supports\nconstant-memory inference, offers strong length generalization, and allows more\nflexible model design. Lizard combines gated linear attention for global\ncontext compression with sliding window attention enhanced by meta memory,\nforming a hybrid mechanism that captures both long-range dependencies and\nfine-grained local interactions. Moreover, we introduce a hardware-aware\nalgorithm that accelerates the training speed of our models. Extensive\nexperiments show that Lizard achieves near-lossless recovery of the teacher\nmodel's performance across standard language modeling tasks, while\nsignificantly outperforming previous linearization methods.

A significant\ndevelopment is the diversification of custom hardware solely targeting the most\nexpensive parts of CNNs. DLAs (deep learning accelerators) and NPUs (neural\nprocessing units), among others, can overcome the approaching limits of\ntraditional silicon scaling and provide a solution to the power/performance\ntradeoff within embedded SoCs. Efficient DSA utilization requires proper system\nintegration and a compilation/execution model for balanced execution in these\nheterogeneous architectures. There is a critical need for proper system\nintegration and an efficient compilation/execution model for balanced execution\nin these heterogeneous architectures. This work highlights the hardware\nintegration challenges for efficiently placing these units within the memory\nhierarchy and correct proximity to other execution blocks. We experimentally\nverify performance bottlenecks in CNN execution and pre/post-processing at\nruntime, where previous attention has generally been given to accelerator\nspeedup alone. This work takes advantage of the ratification of the RISC-V\nVector 1.0 extension and demonstrates its potential as a flexible target within\na well-suited cache hierarchy scheme to reduce pre-processing bottlenecks and\nCPU fallback processes.

                    "value": "The emergence of heterogeneity and domain-specific architectures targeting\ndeep learning inference show great potential for enabling the deployment of\nmodern CNNs on resource-constrained embedded platforms. A significant\ndevelopment is the diversification of custom hardware solely targeting the most\nexpensive parts of CNNs. DLAs (deep learning accelerators) and NPUs (neural\nprocessing units), among others, can overcome the approaching limits of\ntraditional silicon scaling and provide a solution to the power/performance\ntradeoff within embedded SoCs. Efficient DSA utilization requires proper system\nintegration and a compilation/execution model for balanced execution in these\nheterogeneous architectures. There is a critical need for proper system\nintegration and an efficient compilation/execution model for balanced execution\nin these heterogeneous architectures. This work highlights the hardware\nintegration challenges for efficiently placing these units within the memory\nhierarchy and correct proximity to other execution blocks. We experimentally\nverify performance bottlenecks in CNN execution and pre/post-processing at\nruntime, where previous attention has generally been given to accelerator\nspeedup alone. This work takes advantage of the ratification of the RISC-V\nVector 1.0 extension and demonstrates its potential as a flexible target within\na well-suited cache hierarchy scheme to reduce pre-processing bottlenecks and\nCPU fallback processes. Our results show up to a 9x speedup of image\npre-processing and YOLOv3 fallback layer execution by up to 3x compared to CPU.\nWe demonstrate RVV-1.0 in exposing a flexible programming model that can enable\na balanced computation and memory footprint on accelerator-rich embedded SoCs\nsupporting modern deep-learning dataflows while consuming less power than\ntraditional parallel execution platforms."

                "summary": "Feature caching has emerged as an effective strategy to accelerate diffusion\ntransformer (DiT) sampling through temporal feature reuse. It is a challenging\nproblem since (1) Progressive error accumulation from cached blocks\nsignificantly degrades generation quality, particularly when over 50\\% of\nblocks are cached; (2) Current error compensation approaches neglect dynamic\nperturbation patterns during the caching process, leading to suboptimal error\ncorrection. To solve these problems, we propose the Gradient-Optimized Cache\n(GOC) with two key innovations: (1) Cached Gradient Propagation: A gradient\nqueue dynamically computes the gradient differences between cached and\nrecomputed features. These gradients are weighted and propagated to subsequent\nsteps, directly compensating for the approximation errors introduced by\ncaching. (2) Inflection-Aware Optimization: Through statistical analysis of\nfeature variation patterns, we identify critical inflection points where the\ndenoising trajectory changes direction. By aligning gradient updates with these\ndetected phases, we prevent conflicting gradient directions during error\ncorrection. Extensive evaluations on ImageNet demonstrate GOC's superior\ntrade-off between efficiency and quality. With 50\\% cached blocks, GOC achieves\nIS 216.28 (26.3\\% higher) and FID 3.907 (43\\% lower) compared to baseline DiT,\nwhile maintaining identical computational costs. These improvements persist\nacross various cache ratios, demonstrating robust adaptability to different\nacceleration requirements.

Existing\nwork has studied procedure-aware video representations by modeling the temporal\norder of actions, but has not explicitly learned the state changes (scene\ntransformations). In this work, we study procedure-aware video representation\nlearning by incorporating state-change descriptions generated by Large Language\nModels (LLMs) as supervision signals for video encoders. Moreover, we generate\nstate-change counterfactuals that simulate hypothesized failure outcomes,\nallowing models to learn by imagining unseen \"What if\" scenarios. This\ncounterfactual reasoning facilitates the model's ability to understand the\ncause and effect of each step in an activity. We conduct extensive experiments\non procedure-aware tasks, including temporal action segmentation, error\ndetection, action phase classification, frame retrieval, multi-instance\nretrieval, and action recognition. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of\nthe proposed state-change descriptions and their counterfactuals, and achieve\nsignificant improvements on multiple tasks.

                    "value": "Understanding a procedural activity requires modeling both how action steps\ntransform the scene, and how evolving scene transformations can influence the\nsequence of action steps, even those that are accidental or erroneous. Existing\nwork has studied procedure-aware video representations by modeling the temporal\norder of actions, but has not explicitly learned the state changes (scene\ntransformations). In this work, we study procedure-aware video representation\nlearning by incorporating state-change descriptions generated by Large Language\nModels (LLMs) as supervision signals for video encoders. Moreover, we generate\nstate-change counterfactuals that simulate hypothesized failure outcomes,\nallowing models to learn by imagining unseen \"What if\" scenarios. This\ncounterfactual reasoning facilitates the model's ability to understand the\ncause and effect of each step in an activity. We conduct extensive experiments\non procedure-aware tasks, including temporal action segmentation, error\ndetection, action phase classification, frame retrieval, multi-instance\nretrieval, and action recognition. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of\nthe proposed state-change descriptions and their counterfactuals, and achieve\nsignificant improvements on multiple tasks.

To tackle these\nchallenges, several methods have been proposed. Statistical methods demonstrate\ninterpretability on the inferred parameters, but they are often limited in\ntheir ability to handle complex scenes. Deep learning-based methods have shown\nsuperior performance in terms of accuracy and robustness, but they lack\ninterpretability or they are limited to a single-peak per pixel. In this paper,\nwe propose a deep unrolling algorithm for dual-peak single-photon Lidar\nimaging. We introduce a hierarchical Bayesian model for multiple targets and\npropose a neural network that unrolls the underlying statistical method. To\nsupport multiple targets, we adopt a dual depth maps representation and exploit\ngeometric deep learning to extract features from the point cloud. The proposed\nmethod takes advantages of statistical methods and learning-based methods in\nterms of accuracy and quantifying uncertainty. The experimental results on\nsynthetic and real data demonstrate the competitive performance when compared\nto existing methods, while also providing uncertainty information.",

However, these specifications require significant manual efforts to\nconstruct. This paper proposes a new approach, ELFuzz (Evolution Through Large\nLanguage Models for Fuzzing), that automatically synthesizes generation-based\nfuzzers tailored to a system under test (SUT) via LLM-driven synthesis over\nfuzzer space. At a high level, it starts with minimal seed fuzzers and propels\nthe synthesis by fully automated LLM-driven evolution with coverage guidance.\nCompared to previous approaches, ELFuzz can 1) seamlessly scale to SUTs of\nreal-world sizes -- up to 1,791,104 lines of code in our evaluation -- and 2)\nsynthesize efficient fuzzers that catch interesting grammatical structures and\nsemantic constraints in a human-understandable way. Our evaluation compared\nELFuzz with specifications manually written by domain experts and synthesized\nby state-of-the-art approaches. It shows that ELFuzz achieves up to 434.8% more\ncoverage and triggers up to 174.0% more artificially injected bugs. We also\nused ELFuzz to conduct a real-world fuzzing campaign on the newest version of\ncvc5 for 14 days, and encouragingly, it found five 0-day bugs (three are\nexploitable). Moreover, we conducted an ablation study, which shows that the\nfuzzer space model, the key component of ELFuzz, contributes the most (up to\n62.5%) to the effectiveness of ELFuzz. Further analysis of the fuzzers\nsynthesized by ELFuzz confirms that they catch interesting grammatical\nstructures and semantic constraints in a human-understandable way. The results\npresent the promising potential of ELFuzz for more automated, efficient, and\nextensible input generation for fuzzing.",

We introduce VITA (Variational Inference Transformer\nfor Asymmetric data), a variational pretraining framework that addresses this\nasymmetry.

Applied to 763 counties in the U.S. Corn Belt, VITA achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance in predicting corn and soybean yields across all\nevaluation scenarios. While it consistently delivers superior performance under\nnormal conditions, its advantages are particularly pronounced during extreme\nweather years, with statistically significant improvements (paired t-test, $p\n\\approx 0.01$).

On the other hand, although a few\nworks have tried to introduce Chain-of-Thought capability into PRMs, the\nannotation cost of CoT-PRM data is too expensive to play a stable role in\nvarious tasks. To address the above challenges, we propose VRPRM, a process\nreward model via visual reasoning, and design an efficient two-stage training\nstrategy. Experimental results show that using only 3.6K CoT-PRM SFT data and\n50K non-CoT PRM RL training data, VRPRM can surpass the non-thinking PRM with a\ntotal data volume of 400K and achieved a relative performance improvement of up\nto 118\\% over the base model in the BoN experiment.

However, most\nexisting TTS systems offer only coarse and rigid emotion control, typically via\ndiscrete emotion labels or a carefully crafted and detailed emotional text\nprompt, making fine-grained emotion manipulation either inaccessible or\nunstable. These models also require extensive, high-quality datasets for\ntraining. To address these limitations, we propose EmoSteer-TTS, a novel\ntraining-free approach, to achieve fine-grained speech emotion control\n(conversion, interpolation, erasure) by activation steering. We first\nempirically observe that modifying a subset of the internal activations within\na flow matching-based TTS model can effectively alter the emotional tone of\nsynthesized speech. Building on this insight, we then develop a training-free\nand efficient algorithm, including activation extraction, emotional token\nsearching, and inference-time steering, which can be seamlessly integrated into\na wide range of pretrained models (e.g., F5-TTS, CosyVoice2, and E2-TTS). In\naddition, to derive effective steering vectors, we construct a curated\nemotional speech dataset with diverse speakers. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that EmoSteer-TTS enables fine-grained, interpretable, and\ncontinuous control over speech emotion, outperforming the state-of-the-art\n(SOTA). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method that achieves\ntraining-free and continuous fine-grained emotion control in TTS.",

However, most\nexisting TTS systems offer only coarse and rigid emotion control, typically via\ndiscrete emotion labels or a carefully crafted and detailed emotional text\nprompt, making fine-grained emotion manipulation either inaccessible or\nunstable. These models also require extensive, high-quality datasets for\ntraining. To address these limitations, we propose EmoSteer-TTS, a novel\ntraining-free approach, to achieve fine-grained speech emotion control\n(conversion, interpolation, erasure) by activation steering. We first\nempirically observe that modifying a subset of the internal activations within\na flow matching-based TTS model can effectively alter the emotional tone of\nsynthesized speech. Building on this insight, we then develop a training-free\nand efficient algorithm, including activation extraction, emotional token\nsearching, and inference-time steering, which can be seamlessly integrated into\na wide range of pretrained models (e.g., F5-TTS, CosyVoice2, and E2-TTS). In\naddition, to derive effective steering vectors, we construct a curated\nemotional speech dataset with diverse speakers. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that EmoSteer-TTS enables fine-grained, interpretable, and\ncontinuous control over speech emotion, outperforming the state-of-the-art\n(SOTA). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method that achieves\ntraining-free and continuous fine-grained emotion control in TTS."

However, their high computational cost and large\nparameter sizes pose significant challenges for usage in resource-constrained\nscenarios. Post-training quantization (PTQ) is a promising solution to reduce\nmemory usage and accelerate inference, but existing PTQ methods suffer from\nsevere performance degradation under extreme low-bit settings. We identify two\nkey obstacles to low-bit post-training quantization for DiT models: (1) model\nweights follow a Gaussian-like distribution with long tails, causing uniform\nquantization to poorly allocate intervals and leading to significant errors;\n(2) two types of activation outliers: (i) Mild Outliers with slightly elevated\nvalues, and (ii) Salient Outliers with large magnitudes concentrated in\nspecific channels, which disrupt activation quantization. To address these\nissues, we propose LRQ-DiT, an efficient and accurate PTQ framework. We\nintroduce Twin-Log Quantization (TLQ), a log-based method that aligns well with\nthe weight distribution and reduces quantization errors. We also propose an\nAdaptive Rotation Scheme (ARS) that dynamically applies Hadamard or\noutlier-aware rotations based on activation fluctuation, effectively mitigating\nthe impact of both types of outliers. We evaluate LRQ-DiT on PixArt and FLUX\nunder various bit-width settings, and validate the performance on COCO, MJHQ,\nand sDCI datasets.

However, the extremely slow\ninference speed severely limits the practical implementation of diffusion-based\ntalking head generation models. In this study, we propose READ, the first\nreal-time diffusion-transformer-based talking head generation framework. Our\napproach first learns a spatiotemporal highly compressed video latent space via\na temporal VAE, significantly reducing the token count to accelerate\ngeneration. To achieve better audio-visual alignment within this compressed\nlatent space, a pre-trained Speech Autoencoder (SpeechAE) is proposed to\ngenerate temporally compressed speech latent codes corresponding to the video\nlatent space. These latent representations are then modeled by a carefully\ndesigned Audio-to-Video Diffusion Transformer (A2V-DiT) backbone for efficient\ntalking head synthesis. Furthermore, to ensure temporal consistency and\naccelerated inference in extended generation, we propose a novel asynchronous\nnoise scheduler (ANS) for both the training and inference process of our\nframework. The ANS leverages asynchronous add-noise and asynchronous\nmotion-guided generation in the latent space, ensuring consistency in generated\nvideo clips. Experimental results demonstrate that READ outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods by generating competitive talking head videos with\nsignificantly reduced runtime, achieving an optimal balance between quality and\nspeed while maintaining robust metric stability in long-time generation.",

The steady growth of studies and\nfindings overwhelms medical professionals at large, hindering their ability to\nsystematically review and understand the latest knowledge. This paper presents\nan approach to information extraction and automatic knowledge graph (KG)\ngeneration to identify and connect biomedical knowledge. Through a pipeline of\nlarge language model (LLM) agents, the system decomposes 44 PubMed abstracts\ninto semantically meaningful proposition sentences and extracts KG triples from\nthese sentences. The triples are enhanced using a combination of open domain\nand ontology-based information extraction methodologies to incorporate\nontological categories. On top of this, a context variable is included during\nextraction to allow the triple to stand on its own - thereby becoming\n`quadruples'. The extraction accuracy of the LLM is validated by comparing\nnatural language sentences generated from the enhanced triples to the original\npropositions, achieving an average cosine similarity of 0.874.

                    "value": "The rapid expansion of publicly-available medical data presents a challenge\nfor clinicians and researchers alike, increasing the gap between the volume of\nscientific literature and its applications. The steady growth of studies and\nfindings overwhelms medical professionals at large, hindering their ability to\nsystematically review and understand the latest knowledge. This paper presents\nan approach to information extraction and automatic knowledge graph (KG)\ngeneration to identify and connect biomedical knowledge. Through a pipeline of\nlarge language model (LLM) agents, the system decomposes 44 PubMed abstracts\ninto semantically meaningful proposition sentences and extracts KG triples from\nthese sentences. The triples are enhanced using a combination of open domain\nand ontology-based information extraction methodologies to incorporate\nontological categories. On top of this, a context variable is included during\nextraction to allow the triple to stand on its own - thereby becoming\n`quadruples'. The extraction accuracy of the LLM is validated by comparing\nnatural language sentences generated from the enhanced triples to the original\npropositions, achieving an average cosine similarity of 0.874. The similarity\nfor generated sentences of enhanced triples were compared with generated\nsentences of ordinary triples showing an increase as a result of the context\nvariable. Furthermore, this research explores the ability for LLMs to infer new\nrelationships and connect clusters in the knowledge base of the knowledge\ngraph.

With the support of large foundation\nmodels, the quality of medical report generation has significantly improved.\nHowever, challenges such as hallucination and weak disease diagnostic\ncapability still persist. In this paper, we first construct a large-scale\nmulti-modal medical knowledge graph (termed M3KG) based on the ground truth\nmedical report using the GPT-4o. It contains 2477 entities, 3 kinds of\nrelations, 37424 triples, and 6943 disease-aware vision tokens for the CheXpert\nPlus dataset. Then, we sample it to obtain multi-granularity semantic graphs\nand use an R-GCN encoder for feature extraction. For the input X-ray image, we\nadopt the Swin-Transformer to extract the vision features and interact with the\nknowledge using cross-attention. The vision tokens are fed into a Q-former and\nretrieved the disease-aware vision tokens using another cross-attention.\nFinally, we adopt the large language model to map the semantic knowledge graph,\ninput X-ray image, and disease-aware vision tokens into language descriptions.\nExtensive experiments on multiple datasets fully validated the effectiveness of\nour proposed knowledge graph and X-ray report generation framework.

                    "value": "X-ray medical report generation is one of the important applications of\nartificial intelligence in healthcare. With the support of large foundation\nmodels, the quality of medical report generation has significantly improved.\nHowever, challenges such as hallucination and weak disease diagnostic\ncapability still persist. In this paper, we first construct a large-scale\nmulti-modal medical knowledge graph (termed M3KG) based on the ground truth\nmedical report using the GPT-4o. It contains 2477 entities, 3 kinds of\nrelations, 37424 triples, and 6943 disease-aware vision tokens for the CheXpert\nPlus dataset. Then, we sample it to obtain multi-granularity semantic graphs\nand use an R-GCN encoder for feature extraction. For the input X-ray image, we\nadopt the Swin-Transformer to extract the vision features and interact with the\nknowledge using cross-attention. The vision tokens are fed into a Q-former and\nretrieved the disease-aware vision tokens using another cross-attention.\nFinally, we adopt the large language model to map the semantic knowledge graph,\ninput X-ray image, and disease-aware vision tokens into language descriptions.\nExtensive experiments on multiple datasets fully validated the effectiveness of\nour proposed knowledge graph and X-ray report generation framework.

While recent studies have begun\nto address this by introducing error signals, most rely on shallow, static\nerrors, restricting improvement in deep diagnostic ability. To overcome this,\nwe propose Hide and Seek Game (HSG), a dynamic adversarial framework for error\ngeneration and diagnosis, and evaluate it on mathematical problem-solving. HSG\ninvolves two adversarial roles: Sneaky, which \"hides\" by generating subtle,\ndeceptive reasoning errors, and Diagnosis, which \"seeks\" to accurately detect\nthem. Through adversarial co-evolution, both error stealth and diagnostic\nprecision are enhanced. Experiments on several math reasoning tasks show that\nHSG significantly boosts error diagnosis, achieving 16.8\\%--31.4\\% higher\naccuracy than baselines like GPT-4o. We also release a challenging dataset of\ndeceptive errors and diagnostic annotations as a benchmark for future research.",

                    "value": "Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in reasoning and generation across\ndomains, but still struggle with identifying and diagnosing complex errors.\nThis stems mainly from training objectives that prioritize correct answers,\nlimiting exposure to and learning from errors. While recent studies have begun\nto address this by introducing error signals, most rely on shallow, static\nerrors, restricting improvement in deep diagnostic ability. To overcome this,\nwe propose Hide and Seek Game (HSG), a dynamic adversarial framework for error\ngeneration and diagnosis, and evaluate it on mathematical problem-solving. HSG\ninvolves two adversarial roles: Sneaky, which \"hides\" by generating subtle,\ndeceptive reasoning errors, and Diagnosis, which \"seeks\" to accurately detect\nthem. Through adversarial co-evolution, both error stealth and diagnostic\nprecision are enhanced. Experiments on several math reasoning tasks show that\nHSG significantly boosts error diagnosis, achieving 16.8\\%--31.4\\% higher\naccuracy than baselines like GPT-4o. We also release a challenging dataset of\ndeceptive errors and diagnostic annotations as a benchmark for future research."

To\nfill this gap, we propose Thinking with Nothinking Calibration (JointThinking),\na new ICL paradigm that leverages the structured difference between two\nreasoning modes, i.e., Thinking and Nothinking, to improve reasoning accuracy.\nSpecifically, our method prompts the model to generate two answers in parallel:\none in Thinking mode and the other in Nothinking mode.

This paper explores the suitability of Large Language Models,\ncombined with Prompt Engineering, to automatically translate legacy incident\nresponse playbooks into the standardized, machine-readable CACAO format. We\nsystematically examine various Prompt Engineering techniques and carefully\ndesign prompts aimed at maximizing syntactic accuracy and semantic fidelity for\ncontrol flow preservation. Our modular transformation pipeline integrates a\nsyntax checker to ensure syntactic correctness and features an iterative\nrefinement mechanism that progressively reduces syntactic errors.

This paper explores the suitability of Large Language Models,\ncombined with Prompt Engineering, to automatically translate legacy incident\nresponse playbooks into the standardized, machine-readable CACAO format. We\nsystematically examine various Prompt Engineering techniques and carefully\ndesign prompts aimed at maximizing syntactic accuracy and semantic fidelity for\ncontrol flow preservation. Our modular transformation pipeline integrates a\nsyntax checker to ensure syntactic correctness and features an iterative\nrefinement mechanism that progressively reduces syntactic errors.

However, most existing approaches, e.g., Best-of-N and\nSelf-Consistency rely on a single agent interacting with a reward model\n(SA-SR), constrained by limited capabilities of a single test-time scaling\n(STTS) paradigm. On the other hand, recent works demonstrate that\ncollective-agent methods can break through the upper bound of single-agent\nsystems by orchestrating diverse models. Thus, in this paper, we take a first\nstep towards exploring Collective Test-Time Scaling (CTTS). Consider the\ndifferent interaction types of single and multiple models, we design three\nprimary paradigms to investigate the optimal paradigm of CTTS: (1) single agent\nto multiple reward models (SA-MR); (2) multiple agents to single reward model\n(MA-SR); and (3) multiple agents to multiple reward models (MA-MR). Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that MA-MR consistently achieves the best performance.\nBased on this, we propose a novel framework named CTTS-MM that effectively\nleverages both multi-agent and multi-reward-model collaboration for enhanced\ninference. Specifically, for multi-agent collaboration, we propose an Agent\nCollaboration Search (ACS), which searches for the most effective combination\nof LLM agents from a large candidate pool; for multi-reward-model\ncollaboration, we propose Mixture of Reword Models (MoR), which consists of a\ncurated question pool and a Prior Reward model Ensemble Selection (PRES) to\nselect the optimal combinations of reward models via Pair-wise Reward Ranking\n(PRR) metric. Experiments across seven mainstream benchmarks demonstrate that\nthe proposed CTTS-MM consistently obtains superior performance. Code will be\nreleased at https://github.com/magent4aci/CTTS-MM.",

Specifically, for multi-agent collaboration, we propose an Agent\nCollaboration Search (ACS), which searches for the most effective combination\nof LLM agents from a large candidate pool; for multi-reward-model\ncollaboration, we propose Mixture of Reword Models (MoR), which consists of a\ncurated question pool and a Prior Reward model Ensemble Selection (PRES) to\nselect the optimal combinations of reward models via Pair-wise Reward Ranking\n(PRR) metric. Experiments across seven mainstream benchmarks demonstrate that\nthe proposed CTTS-MM consistently obtains superior performance. Code will be\nreleased at https://github.com/magent4aci/CTTS-MM."

Through extensive experiments on a simulated\naerial imagery dataset featuring controlled, complex distributional shifts, we\ndemonstrate that our abduction-based framework outperforms individual models\nand standard ensemble baselines, achieving, for instance, average relative\nimprovements of approximately 13.6\\% in F1-score and 16.6\\% in accuracy across\n15 diverse test datasets when compared to the best individual model.

We compare\ndirectly tuning sub-sets of model weights, input learnable adapters, and prefix\ntuning techniques for online finetuning. Our analysis reveals that PEFT\ntechniques in conjunction with policy pre-training generally help reduce the\nnumber of samples to necessary to improve a policy compared to training models\nend-to-end from scratch. We further find that tuning as few as less than 1% of\ntotal parameters will improve policy performance compared the zero-shot\nperformance of the base pretrained a policy."

                "summary": "Generation-based fuzzing produces appropriate testing cases according to\nspecifications of input grammars and semantic constraints to test systems and\nsoftware. However, these specifications require significant manual efforts to\nconstruct. This paper proposes a new approach, ELFuzz (Evolution Through Large\nLanguage Models for Fuzzing), that automatically synthesizes generation-based\nfuzzers tailored to a system under test (SUT) via LLM-driven synthesis over\nfuzzer space. At a high level, it starts with minimal seed fuzzers and propels\nthe synthesis by fully automated LLM-driven evolution with coverage guidance.\nCompared to previous approaches, ELFuzz can 1) seamlessly scale to SUTs of\nreal-world sizes -- up to 1,791,104 lines of code in our evaluation -- and 2)\nsynthesize efficient fuzzers that catch interesting grammatical structures and\nsemantic constraints in a human-understandable way. Our evaluation compared\nELFuzz with specifications manually written by domain experts and synthesized\nby state-of-the-art approaches. It shows that ELFuzz achieves up to 434.8% more\ncoverage and triggers up to 174.0% more artificially injected bugs.

                    "value": "Generation-based fuzzing produces appropriate testing cases according to\nspecifications of input grammars and semantic constraints to test systems and\nsoftware. However, these specifications require significant manual efforts to\nconstruct. This paper proposes a new approach, ELFuzz (Evolution Through Large\nLanguage Models for Fuzzing), that automatically synthesizes generation-based\nfuzzers tailored to a system under test (SUT) via LLM-driven synthesis over\nfuzzer space. At a high level, it starts with minimal seed fuzzers and propels\nthe synthesis by fully automated LLM-driven evolution with coverage guidance.\nCompared to previous approaches, ELFuzz can 1) seamlessly scale to SUTs of\nreal-world sizes -- up to 1,791,104 lines of code in our evaluation -- and 2)\nsynthesize efficient fuzzers that catch interesting grammatical structures and\nsemantic constraints in a human-understandable way. Our evaluation compared\nELFuzz with specifications manually written by domain experts and synthesized\nby state-of-the-art approaches. It shows that ELFuzz achieves up to 434.8% more\ncoverage and triggers up to 174.0% more artificially injected bugs.

In this work, we\nconceptualize this effect as the $\\textit{data compliance gap}$ (DCG), which\nquantifies the performance difference between models trained on datasets that\ncomply with web crawling opt-outs, and those that do not. We measure the data\ncompliance gap in two settings: pretraining models from scratch and continual\npretraining from existing compliant models (simulating a setting where\ncopyrighted data could be integrated later in pretraining). Our experiments\nwith 1.5B models show that, as of January 2025, compliance with web data\nopt-outs does not degrade general knowledge acquisition (close to 0\\% DCG).\nHowever, in specialized domains such as biomedical research, excluding major\npublishers leads to performance declines. These findings suggest that while\ngeneral-purpose LLMs can be trained to perform equally well using fully open\ndata, performance in specialized domains may benefit from access to\nhigh-quality copyrighted sources later in training. Our study provides\nempirical insights into the long-debated trade-off between data compliance and\ndownstream model performance, informing future discussions on AI training\npractices and policy decisions.

In this work, we\nconceptualize this effect as the $\\textit{data compliance gap}$ (DCG), which\nquantifies the performance difference between models trained on datasets that\ncomply with web crawling opt-outs, and those that do not. We measure the data\ncompliance gap in two settings: pretraining models from scratch and continual\npretraining from existing compliant models (simulating a setting where\ncopyrighted data could be integrated later in pretraining). Our experiments\nwith 1.5B models show that, as of January 2025, compliance with web data\nopt-outs does not degrade general knowledge acquisition (close to 0\\% DCG).\nHowever, in specialized domains such as biomedical research, excluding major\npublishers leads to performance declines. These findings suggest that while\ngeneral-purpose LLMs can be trained to perform equally well using fully open\ndata, performance in specialized domains may benefit from access to\nhigh-quality copyrighted sources later in training. Our study provides\nempirical insights into the long-debated trade-off between data compliance and\ndownstream model performance, informing future discussions on AI training\npractices and policy decisions.

High-level synthesis (HLS), as a pivotal solution,\nautomates hardware designs from high-level abstractions (e.g., C/C++).

In this paper, we introduce\nAdaMCOT (Adaptive Multilingual Chain-of-Thought), a framework that enhances\nmultilingual factual reasoning by dynamically routing thought processes in\nintermediary \"thinking languages\" before generating target-language responses.\nAdaMCOT leverages a language-agnostic core and incorporates an adaptive,\nreward-based mechanism for selecting optimal reasoning pathways without\nrequiring additional pretraining. Our comprehensive evaluation across multiple\nbenchmarks demonstrates substantial improvements in both factual reasoning\nquality and cross-lingual consistency, with particularly strong performance\ngains in low-resource language settings. An in-depth analysis of the model's\nhidden states and semantic space further elucidates the underlying mechanism of\nour method. The results suggest that adaptive reasoning paths can effectively\nbridge the performance gap between high and low-resource languages while\nmaintaining cultural and linguistic nuances.",

In this paper, we introduce\nAdaMCOT (Adaptive Multilingual Chain-of-Thought), a framework that enhances\nmultilingual factual reasoning by dynamically routing thought processes in\nintermediary \"thinking languages\" before generating target-language responses.\nAdaMCOT leverages a language-agnostic core and incorporates an adaptive,\nreward-based mechanism for selecting optimal reasoning pathways without\nrequiring additional pretraining. Our comprehensive evaluation across multiple\nbenchmarks demonstrates substantial improvements in both factual reasoning\nquality and cross-lingual consistency, with particularly strong performance\ngains in low-resource language settings. An in-depth analysis of the model's\nhidden states and semantic space further elucidates the underlying mechanism of\nour method. The results suggest that adaptive reasoning paths can effectively\nbridge the performance gap between high and low-resource languages while\nmaintaining cultural and linguistic nuances."

In this paper, we propose\nSmartGen, an LLM-based framework that synthesizes context-aware user behavior\ndata to support continual adaptation of downstream smart home models. SmartGen\nconsists of four key components. First, we design a Time and Semantic-aware\nSplit module to divide long behavior sequences into manageable, semantically\ncoherent subsequences under dual time-span constraints. Second, we propose\nSemantic-aware Sequence Compression to reduce input length while preserving\nrepresentative semantics by clustering behavior mapping in latent space. Third,\nwe introduce Graph-guided Sequence Synthesis, which constructs a behavior\nrelationship graph and encodes frequent transitions into prompts, guiding the\nLLM to generate data aligned with contextual changes while retaining core\nbehavior patterns. Finally, we design a Two-stage Outlier Filter to identify\nand remove implausible or semantically inconsistent outputs, aiming to improve\nthe factual coherence and behavioral validity of the generated sequences.\nExperiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that SmartGen\nsignificantly enhances model performance on anomaly detection and behavior\nprediction tasks under behavioral drift, with anomaly detection improving by\n85.43% and behavior prediction by 70.51% on average.

The steady growth of studies and\nfindings overwhelms medical professionals at large, hindering their ability to\nsystematically review and understand the latest knowledge. This paper presents\nan approach to information extraction and automatic knowledge graph (KG)\ngeneration to identify and connect biomedical knowledge. Through a pipeline of\nlarge language model (LLM) agents, the system decomposes 44 PubMed abstracts\ninto semantically meaningful proposition sentences and extracts KG triples from\nthese sentences. The triples are enhanced using a combination of open domain\nand ontology-based information extraction methodologies to incorporate\nontological categories. On top of this, a context variable is included during\nextraction to allow the triple to stand on its own - thereby becoming\n`quadruples'. The extraction accuracy of the LLM is validated by comparing\nnatural language sentences generated from the enhanced triples to the original\npropositions, achieving an average cosine similarity of 0.874. The similarity\nfor generated sentences of enhanced triples were compared with generated\nsentences of ordinary triples showing an increase as a result of the context\nvariable. Furthermore, this research explores the ability for LLMs to infer new\nrelationships and connect clusters in the knowledge base of the knowledge\ngraph. This approach leads the way to provide medical practitioners with a\ncentralised, updated in real-time, and sustainable knowledge source, and may be\nthe foundation of similar gains in a wide variety of fields.",

                    "value": "The rapid expansion of publicly-available medical data presents a challenge\nfor clinicians and researchers alike, increasing the gap between the volume of\nscientific literature and its applications. The steady growth of studies and\nfindings overwhelms medical professionals at large, hindering their ability to\nsystematically review and understand the latest knowledge. This paper presents\nan approach to information extraction and automatic knowledge graph (KG)\ngeneration to identify and connect biomedical knowledge. Through a pipeline of\nlarge language model (LLM) agents, the system decomposes 44 PubMed abstracts\ninto semantically meaningful proposition sentences and extracts KG triples from\nthese sentences. The triples are enhanced using a combination of open domain\nand ontology-based information extraction methodologies to incorporate\nontological categories. On top of this, a context variable is included during\nextraction to allow the triple to stand on its own - thereby becoming\n`quadruples'. The extraction accuracy of the LLM is validated by comparing\nnatural language sentences generated from the enhanced triples to the original\npropositions, achieving an average cosine similarity of 0.874. The similarity\nfor generated sentences of enhanced triples were compared with generated\nsentences of ordinary triples showing an increase as a result of the context\nvariable. Furthermore, this research explores the ability for LLMs to infer new\nrelationships and connect clusters in the knowledge base of the knowledge\ngraph. This approach leads the way to provide medical practitioners with a\ncentralised, updated in real-time, and sustainable knowledge source, and may be\nthe foundation of similar gains in a wide variety of fields."

In this work, we propose a\nnovel visual framework, MoCHA, to address these issues. Our framework\nintegrates four vision backbones (i.e., CLIP, SigLIP, DINOv2 and ConvNeXt) to\nextract complementary visual features and is equipped with a sparse Mixture of\nExperts Connectors (MoECs) module to dynamically select experts tailored to\ndifferent visual dimensions. To mitigate redundant or insufficient use of the\nvisual information encoded by the MoECs module, we further design a\nHierarchical Group Attention (HGA) with intra- and inter-group operations and\nan adaptive gating strategy for encoded visual features. We train MoCHA on two\nmainstream LLMs (e.g., Phi2-2.7B and Vicuna-7B) and evaluate their performance\nacross various benchmarks. Notably, MoCHA outperforms state-of-the-art\nopen-weight models on various tasks. For example, compared to CuMo\n(Mistral-7B), our MoCHA (Phi2-2.7B) presents outstanding abilities to mitigate\nhallucination by showing improvements of 3.25% in POPE and to follow visual\ninstructions by raising 153 points on MME.

We investigate the trade-offs between domain-specific\nLLM-generated heuristics and traditional domain-independent methods in terms of\ncomputational efficiency and explainability. Our experiments demonstrate that\nLLMs can create heuristics that achieve state-of-the-art performance on some\nstandard IPC domains, as well as their ability to solve problems that lack an\nadequate Planning Domain Definition Language ({\\sc pddl}) representation. We\ndiscuss whether these results signify a paradigm shift and how they can\ncomplement existing approaches."

In this work, we investigate strategies to\nenhance the data analysis capabilities of open-source LLMs. By curating a seed\ndataset of diverse, realistic scenarios, we evaluate model behavior across\nthree core dimensions: data understanding, code generation, and strategic\nplanning. Our analysis reveals three key findings: (1) Strategic planning\nquality serves as the primary determinant of model performance; (2) Interaction\ndesign and task complexity significantly influence reasoning capabilities; (3)\nData quality demonstrates a greater impact than diversity in achieving optimal\nperformance. We leverage these insights to develop a data synthesis\nmethodology, demonstrating significant improvements in open-source LLMs'\nanalytical reasoning capabilities.

In this work, we investigate strategies to\nenhance the data analysis capabilities of open-source LLMs. By curating a seed\ndataset of diverse, realistic scenarios, we evaluate model behavior across\nthree core dimensions: data understanding, code generation, and strategic\nplanning. Our analysis reveals three key findings: (1) Strategic planning\nquality serves as the primary determinant of model performance; (2) Interaction\ndesign and task complexity significantly influence reasoning capabilities; (3)\nData quality demonstrates a greater impact than diversity in achieving optimal\nperformance. We leverage these insights to develop a data synthesis\nmethodology, demonstrating significant improvements in open-source LLMs'\nanalytical reasoning capabilities.

                "summary": "Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has been shown to improve Large Language\nModel (LLM) performance on various tasks. With this approach, LLMs appear to\nproduce human-like reasoning steps before providing answers (a.k.a., CoT\nreasoning), which often leads to the perception that they engage in deliberate\ninferential processes. However, some initial findings suggest that CoT\nreasoning may be more superficial than it appears, motivating us to explore\nfurther. In this paper, we study CoT reasoning via a data distribution lens and\ninvestigate if CoT reasoning reflects a structured inductive bias learned from\nin-distribution data, allowing the model to conditionally generate reasoning\npaths that approximate those seen during training. Thus, its effectiveness is\nfundamentally bounded by the degree of distribution discrepancy between the\ntraining data and the test queries. With this lens, we dissect CoT reasoning\nvia three dimensions: task, length, and format. To investigate each dimension,\nwe design DataAlchemy, an isolated and controlled environment to train LLMs\nfrom scratch and systematically probe them under various distribution\nconditions.

                    "value": "Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has been shown to improve Large Language\nModel (LLM) performance on various tasks. With this approach, LLMs appear to\nproduce human-like reasoning steps before providing answers (a.k.a., CoT\nreasoning), which often leads to the perception that they engage in deliberate\ninferential processes. However, some initial findings suggest that CoT\nreasoning may be more superficial than it appears, motivating us to explore\nfurther. In this paper, we study CoT reasoning via a data distribution lens and\ninvestigate if CoT reasoning reflects a structured inductive bias learned from\nin-distribution data, allowing the model to conditionally generate reasoning\npaths that approximate those seen during training. Thus, its effectiveness is\nfundamentally bounded by the degree of distribution discrepancy between the\ntraining data and the test queries. With this lens, we dissect CoT reasoning\nvia three dimensions: task, length, and format. To investigate each dimension,\nwe design DataAlchemy, an isolated and controlled environment to train LLMs\nfrom scratch and systematically probe them under various distribution\nconditions. Our results reveal that CoT reasoning is a brittle mirage that\nvanishes when it is pushed beyond training distributions. This work offers a\ndeeper understanding of why and when CoT reasoning fails, emphasizing the\nongoing challenge of achieving genuine and generalizable reasoning."

Despite the\nadvancements, their practical deployment faces challenges, including high\nfinancial costs, long response time, and varying performance, especially when\nhandling a large number of queries (jobs). Existing optimization strategies for\ndeploying LLMs for diverse tasks focus on static scheduling, which requires\nextensive training data for performance prediction, increasing the\ncomputational costs and limiting the applicability and flexibility. In this\npaper, we propose the SmartLLMs Scheduler (SLS), a dynamic and cost-effective\nscheduling solution. The key idea is to learn LLMs' performance on diverse\ntasks and incorporate their real-time feedback to update strategies\nperiodically. Specifically, SLS incorporates three key components, including an\nAdaptive Cache Manager, a Performance-Cost Optimized Scheduler, and a Dynamic\nUpdate Manager. The Cache Manager stores the outputs of previously processed\nqueries and employs an adaptive strategy to reduce redundant computations and\nminimize response times. For queries not found in the cache, the Scheduler\ndynamically allocates them to the most suitable LLM based on the predicted\nperformance and cost from models that take both query-specific and LLM-specific\nfeatures as input. The Update Manager continuously refines the cache and\nscheduling strategies based on real-time feedback from the assigned queries to\nenhance decision-making and adapt to evolving task characteristics. To evaluate\nthe effectiveness of SLS, we conduct extensive experiments on two LLM-based\nsoftware engineering tasks, including log parsing and code generation. The\nresults show that SLS significantly outperforms the baseline methods, achieving\nan average performance improvement of 198.82% and an average processing time\nreduction of 63.28%.",
