To extend the generation length and facilitate real-world\napplications, a majority of video diffusion models (VDMs) generate videos in an\nautoregressive manner, i.e., generating subsequent clips conditioned on the\nlast frame(s) of the previous clip. However, existing autoregressive VDMs are\nhighly inefficient and redundant: The model must re-compute all the conditional\nframes that are overlapped between adjacent clips. This issue is exacerbated\nwhen the conditional frames are extended autoregressively to provide the model\nwith long-term context. In such cases, the computational demands increase\nsignificantly (i.e., with a quadratic complexity w.r.t. the autoregression\nstep). In this paper, we propose Ca2-VDM, an efficient autoregressive VDM with\nCausal generation and Cache sharing. For causal generation, it introduces\nunidirectional feature computation, which ensures that the cache of conditional\nframes can be precomputed in previous autoregression steps and reused in every\nsubsequent step, eliminating redundant computations. For cache sharing, it\nshares the cache across all denoising steps to avoid the huge cache storage\ncost.

                "summary": "Building a high-performance JIT-capable VM for a dynamic language has\ntraditionally required a tremendous amount of time, money, and expertise. We\npresent Deegen, a meta-compiler that allows users to generate a\nhigh-performance JIT-capable VM for their own language at an engineering cost\nsimilar to writing a simple interpreter. Deegen takes in the execution\nsemantics of the bytecodes implemented as C++ functions, and automatically\ngenerates a two-tier VM execution engine with a state-of-the-art interpreter, a\nstate-of-the-art baseline JIT, and the tier-switching logic that connects them\ninto a self-adaptive system.\n  We are the first to demonstrate the automatic generation of a JIT compiler,\nand the automatic generation of an interpreter that outperforms the state of\nthe art. Our performance comes from a long list of optimizations supported by\nDeegen, including bytecode specialization and quickening, register pinning, tag\nregister optimization, call inline caching, generic inline caching, JIT\npolymorphic IC, JIT IC inline slab, type-check removal and strength reduction,\ntype-based slow-path extraction and outlining, JIT hot-cold code splitting, and\nJIT OSR-entry. These optimizations are either employed automatically, or guided\nby the language implementer through intuitive APIs. As a result, the\ndisassembly of the Deegen-generated interpreter, baseline JIT, and the\ngenerated JIT code rivals the assembly code hand-written by experts in\nstate-of-the-art VMs.\n  We implement LuaJIT Remake (LJR), a standard-compliant Lua 5.1 VM, using\nDeegen. Across 44 benchmarks, LJR's interpreter is on average 179% faster than\nthe official PUC Lua interpreter, and 31% faster than LuaJIT's interpreter.\nLJR's baseline JIT has negligible startup delay, and its execution performance\nis on average 360% faster than PUC Lua and only 33% slower (but faster on 13/44\nbenchmarks) than LuaJIT's optimizing JIT.",

We\npresent Deegen, a meta-compiler that allows users to generate a\nhigh-performance JIT-capable VM for their own language at an engineering cost\nsimilar to writing a simple interpreter. Deegen takes in the execution\nsemantics of the bytecodes implemented as C++ functions, and automatically\ngenerates a two-tier VM execution engine with a state-of-the-art interpreter, a\nstate-of-the-art baseline JIT, and the tier-switching logic that connects them\ninto a self-adaptive system.\n  We are the first to demonstrate the automatic generation of a JIT compiler,\nand the automatic generation of an interpreter that outperforms the state of\nthe art. Our performance comes from a long list of optimizations supported by\nDeegen, including bytecode specialization and quickening, register pinning, tag\nregister optimization, call inline caching, generic inline caching, JIT\npolymorphic IC, JIT IC inline slab, type-check removal and strength reduction,\ntype-based slow-path extraction and outlining, JIT hot-cold code splitting, and\nJIT OSR-entry. These optimizations are either employed automatically, or guided\nby the language implementer through intuitive APIs. As a result, the\ndisassembly of the Deegen-generated interpreter, baseline JIT, and the\ngenerated JIT code rivals the assembly code hand-written by experts in\nstate-of-the-art VMs.\n  We implement LuaJIT Remake (LJR), a standard-compliant Lua 5.1 VM, using\nDeegen. Across 44 benchmarks, LJR's interpreter is on average 179% faster than\nthe official PUC Lua interpreter, and 31% faster than LuaJIT's interpreter.\nLJR's baseline JIT has negligible startup delay, and its execution performance\nis on average 360% faster than PUC Lua and only 33% slower (but faster on 13/44\nbenchmarks) than LuaJIT's optimizing JIT."

However, for many of\nthese applications, much of the context in the prompt is fixed across different\nuser inputs, thereby providing the opportunity to perform offline optimizations\nto process user inputs quickly, as they are received. In this work, we propose\nSqueezed Attention as a mechanism to accelerate LLM applications where a large\nportion of the input prompt is fixed. We first leverage K-means clustering\noffline to group the keys for the fixed context based on semantic similarity\nand represent each cluster with a single centroid value. During inference, we\ncompare query tokens from the user input with the centroids to predict which of\nthe keys from the fixed context are semantically relevant and need to be loaded\nduring inference. We then compute exact attention using only these important\nkeys from the fixed context, thereby reducing bandwidth and computational\ncosts. We also extend our method to use a hierarchical centroid lookup to\nidentify important keys, which can reduce the complexity of attention from\nlinear to logarithmic with respect to the context length. We implement\noptimized Triton kernels for centroid comparison and sparse FlashAttention with\nimportant keys, achieving more than 4x speedups during both the prefill and\ngeneration phases for long-context inference.

                    "value": "Emerging Large Language Model (LLM) applications require long input prompts\nto perform complex downstream tasks like document analysis and code generation.\nFor these long context length applications, the length of the input prompt\nposes a significant challenge in terms of inference efficiency since the\ninference costs increase linearly with sequence length. However, for many of\nthese applications, much of the context in the prompt is fixed across different\nuser inputs, thereby providing the opportunity to perform offline optimizations\nto process user inputs quickly, as they are received. In this work, we propose\nSqueezed Attention as a mechanism to accelerate LLM applications where a large\nportion of the input prompt is fixed. We first leverage K-means clustering\noffline to group the keys for the fixed context based on semantic similarity\nand represent each cluster with a single centroid value. During inference, we\ncompare query tokens from the user input with the centroids to predict which of\nthe keys from the fixed context are semantically relevant and need to be loaded\nduring inference. We then compute exact attention using only these important\nkeys from the fixed context, thereby reducing bandwidth and computational\ncosts. We also extend our method to use a hierarchical centroid lookup to\nidentify important keys, which can reduce the complexity of attention from\nlinear to logarithmic with respect to the context length. We implement\noptimized Triton kernels for centroid comparison and sparse FlashAttention with\nimportant keys, achieving more than 4x speedups during both the prefill and\ngeneration phases for long-context inference. Furthermore, we have extensively\nevaluated our method on various long-context benchmarks including LongBench,\nwhere it achieves a 3x reduction in KV cache budget without accuracy loss and\nup to an 8x reduction with <0.5 point accuracy gap for various models."

We empirically observe that,\nunlike single image inputs, VLLMs typically attend visual tokens from different\nframes at different decoding iterations, making a one-shot pruning strategy\nprone to removing important tokens by mistake. Motivated by this, we present\nDyCoke, a training-free token compression method to optimize token\nrepresentation and accelerate VLLMs. DyCoke incorporates a plug-and-play\ntemporal compression module to minimize temporal redundancy by merging\nredundant tokens across frames, and applies dynamic KV cache reduction to prune\nspatially redundant tokens selectively. It ensures high-quality inference by\ndynamically retaining the critical tokens at each decoding step. Extensive\nexperimental results demonstrate that DyCoke can outperform the prior SoTA\ncounterparts, achieving 1.5X inference speedup, 1.4X memory reduction against\nthe baseline VLLM, while still improving the performance, with no training.",

                    "value": "Video large language models (VLLMs) have significantly advanced recently in\nprocessing complex video content, yet their inference efficiency remains\nconstrained because of the high computational cost stemming from the thousands\nof visual tokens generated from the video inputs. We empirically observe that,\nunlike single image inputs, VLLMs typically attend visual tokens from different\nframes at different decoding iterations, making a one-shot pruning strategy\nprone to removing important tokens by mistake. Motivated by this, we present\nDyCoke, a training-free token compression method to optimize token\nrepresentation and accelerate VLLMs. DyCoke incorporates a plug-and-play\ntemporal compression module to minimize temporal redundancy by merging\nredundant tokens across frames, and applies dynamic KV cache reduction to prune\nspatially redundant tokens selectively. It ensures high-quality inference by\ndynamically retaining the critical tokens at each decoding step. Extensive\nexperimental results demonstrate that DyCoke can outperform the prior SoTA\ncounterparts, achieving 1.5X inference speedup, 1.4X memory reduction against\nthe baseline VLLM, while still improving the performance, with no training."

In this work, we introduce Bi-Mamba, a\nscalable and powerful 1-bit Mamba architecture designed for more efficient\nlarge language models with multiple sizes across 780M, 1.3B, and 2.7B. Bi-Mamba\nmodels are trained from scratch on data volume as regular LLM pertaining using\nan autoregressive distillation loss. Extensive experimental results on language\nmodeling demonstrate that Bi-Mamba achieves performance comparable to its\nfull-precision counterparts (e.g., FP16 or BF16) and much better accuracy than\npost-training-binarization (PTB) Mamba baselines, while significantly reducing\nmemory footprint and energy consumption compared to the original Mamba model.\nOur study pioneers a new linear computational complexity LLM framework under\nlow-bit representation and facilitates the future design of specialized\nhardware tailored for efficient 1-bit Mamba-based LLMs.",

For the AFM operation, we leverage unique universal\ncharacteristics (UCs) of a data-object and a cluster's mean set, which are\nskewed distributions on data relationships such as Zipf's law and a\nfeature-value concentration phenomenon. The UCs indicate that the most part of\nthe number of multiplications for similarity calculations is executed regarding\nterms with high document frequencies (df) and the most part of a similarity\nbetween an object- and a mean-feature vector is obtained by the multiplications\nregarding a few high mean-feature values. Our proposed algorithm applies an\ninverted-index data structure to a mean set, extracts the specific region with\nhigh-df terms and high mean-feature values in the mean-inverted index by newly\nintroduced two structural parameters, and exploits the index divided into three\nparts for efficient pruning. The algorithm determines the two structural\nparameters by minimizing the approximate number of multiplications related to\nthat of instructions, reduces the branch mispredictions by sharing the index\nstructure including the two parameters with all the objects, and suppressing\nthe cache misses by keeping in the caches the frequently used data in the\nforegoing specific region, resulting in working in the AFM.

In this paper, we show new types of side channels\nthrough the file system that break this logical isolation. The file system\nplays a critical role in the operating system, managing all I/O activities\nbetween the application layer and the physical storage device. We observe that\nthe file system implementation is shared, leading to timing leakage when using\ncommon I/O system calls. Specifically, we found that modern operating systems\ntake advantage of any flush operation (which saves cached blocks in memory to\nthe SSD or disk) to flush all of the I/O buffers, even those used by other\nisolation domains. Thus, by measuring the delay of syncfs, the attacker can\ninfer the I/O behavior of victim programs. We then demonstrate a syncfs covert\nchannel attack on multiple file systems, including both Linux native file\nsystems and the Windows file system, achieving a maximum bandwidth of 5 Kbps\nwith an error rate of 0.15% on Linux and 7.6 Kbps with an error rate of 1.9% on\nWindows. In addition, we construct three side-channel attacks targeting both\nLinux and Android devices. On Linux devices, we implement a website\nfingerprinting attack and a video fingerprinting attack by tracking the write\npatterns of temporary buffering files. On Android devices, we design an\napplication fingerprinting attack that leaks application write patterns during\nboot-up. The attacks achieve over 90% F1 score, precision, and recall. Finally,\nwe demonstrate that these attacks can be exploited across containers\nimplementing a container detection technique and a cross-container covert\nchannel attack.",

The encouraging results, however, come with the\ncost of slow inference, since each denoising step requires inference on a\ntransformer model with a large scale of parameters. In this study, we make an\ninteresting and somehow surprising observation: the computation of a large\nproportion of layers in the diffusion transformer, through introducing a\ncaching mechanism, can be readily removed even without updating the model\nparameters. In the case of U-ViT-H/2, for example, we may remove up to 93.68%\nof the computation in the cache steps (46.84% for all steps), with less than\n0.01 drop in FID. To achieve this, we introduce a novel scheme, named\nLearning-to-Cache (L2C), that learns to conduct caching in a dynamic manner for\ndiffusion transformers. Specifically, by leveraging the identical structure of\nlayers in transformers and the sequential nature of diffusion, we explore\nredundant computations between timesteps by treating each layer as the\nfundamental unit for caching. To address the challenge of the exponential\nsearch space in deep models for identifying layers to cache and remove, we\npropose a novel differentiable optimization objective. An input-invariant yet\ntimestep-variant router is then optimized, which can finally produce a static\ncomputation graph. Experimental results show that L2C largely outperforms\nsamplers such as DDIM and DPM-Solver, alongside prior cache-based methods at\nthe same inference speed.

The\neffectiveness of a key-value cache relies on its ability of accommodating the\nneeded data. However, expanding the cache capacity is often more difficult than\ncommonly expected because of many practical constraints, such as server costs,\ncooling issues, rack space, and even human resource expenses. A potential\nsolution is compression, which virtually extends the cache capacity by\ncondensing data in cache. In practice, this seemingly simple idea has not\ngained much traction in key-value cache system design, due to several critical\nissues: the compression-unfriendly index structure, severe read/write\namplification, wasteful decompression operations, and heavy computing cost.\nThis paper presents a hybrid DRAM-SSD cache design to realize a systematic\nintegration of data compression in key-value cache. By treating compression as\nan essential component, we have redesigned the indexing structure, data\nmanagement, and leveraged the emerging computational SSD hardware for\ncollaborative optimizations. We have developed a prototype, called ZipCache.\nOur experimental results show that ZipCache can achieve up to 72.4% higher\nthroughput and 42.4% lower latency, while reducing the write amplification by\nup to 26.2 times.",

                    "value": "As a core component in modern data centers, key-value cache provides\nhigh-throughput and low-latency services for high-speed data processing. The\neffectiveness of a key-value cache relies on its ability of accommodating the\nneeded data. However, expanding the cache capacity is often more difficult than\ncommonly expected because of many practical constraints, such as server costs,\ncooling issues, rack space, and even human resource expenses. A potential\nsolution is compression, which virtually extends the cache capacity by\ncondensing data in cache. In practice, this seemingly simple idea has not\ngained much traction in key-value cache system design, due to several critical\nissues: the compression-unfriendly index structure, severe read/write\namplification, wasteful decompression operations, and heavy computing cost.\nThis paper presents a hybrid DRAM-SSD cache design to realize a systematic\nintegration of data compression in key-value cache. By treating compression as\nan essential component, we have redesigned the indexing structure, data\nmanagement, and leveraged the emerging computational SSD hardware for\ncollaborative optimizations. We have developed a prototype, called ZipCache.\nOur experimental results show that ZipCache can achieve up to 72.4% higher\nthroughput and 42.4% lower latency, while reducing the write amplification by\nup to 26.2 times."

One natural way to address\nthis issue is to use cross-layer attention, allowing information from earlier\nlayers to be directly accessible to later layers. However, this approach is\ncomputationally expensive. To address this problem, we propose Transformer with\nresidual value (ResFormer) which approximates cross-layer attention through\nadding a residual connection from the values of the the first layer to all\nsubsequent layers. Based on this method, one variant is the Transformer with\nsingle layer value (SVFormer), where all layers share the same value embedding\nfrom first layer, reducing the $KV$ cache by nearly 50\\%. Comprehensive\nempirical evidence demonstrates that ResFormer mitigates attention\nconcentration problem in deeper layers and enhances representation across most\nlayers, outperforming the vanilla Transformer, DenseFormer, and NeuTRENO in\ntraining error as well as downstream tasks. Further visualization results\nsuggest that Resformer alleviates attention sinks through avoiding value-state\ndrains. SVFormer trains significantly faster than the vanilla Transformer and\nperforms better than other methods like GQA and CLA, with performance\ninfluenced by sequence length and cumulative learning rate.",

Due to the ever-growing data volume, it is imperative\nto consider parallelism in $k$d-trees. However, we observed challenges in\nexisting parallel kd-tree implementations, for both constructions and updates.\n  The goal of this paper is to develop efficient in-memory $k$d-trees by\nsupporting high parallelism and cache-efficiency. We propose the Pkd-tree\n(Parallel $k$d-tree), a parallel $k$d-tree that is efficient both in theory and\nin practice. The Pkd-tree supports parallel tree construction, batch update\n(insertion and deletion), and various queries including k-nearest neighbor\nsearch, range query, and range count. We proved that our algorithms have strong\ntheoretical bounds in work (sequential time complexity), span (parallelism),\nand cache complexity. Our key techniques include 1) an efficient construction\nalgorithm that optimizes work, span, and cache complexity simultaneously, and\n2) reconstruction-based update algorithms that guarantee the tree to be\nweight-balanced. With the new algorithmic insights and careful engineering\neffort, we achieved a highly optimized implementation of the Pkd-tree.\n  We tested Pkd-tree with various synthetic and real-world datasets, including\nboth uniform and highly skewed data. We compare the Pkd-tree with\nstate-of-the-art parallel $k$d-tree implementations. In all tests, with better\nor competitive query performance, Pkd-tree is much faster in construction and\nupdates consistently than all baselines. We released our code.",

In this\npaper, we present a strategy called SKVQ, which stands for sliding-window KV\ncache quantization, to address the issue of extremely low bitwidth KV cache\nquantization. To achieve this, SKVQ rearranges the channels of the KV cache in\norder to improve the similarity of channels in quantization groups, and applies\nclipped dynamic quantization at the group level. Additionally, SKVQ ensures\nthat the most recent window tokens in the KV cache are preserved with high\nprecision. This helps maintain the accuracy of a small but important portion of\nthe KV cache.SKVQ achieves high compression ratios while maintaining accuracy.\nOur evaluation on LLMs demonstrates that SKVQ surpasses previous quantization\napproaches, allowing for quantization of the KV cache to 2-bit keys and 1.5-bit\nvalues with minimal loss of accuracy. With SKVQ, it is possible to process\ncontext lengths of up to 1M on an 80GB memory GPU for a 7b model and up to 7\ntimes faster decoding.",

                    "value": "Large language models (LLMs) can now handle longer sequences of tokens,\nenabling complex tasks like book understanding and generating lengthy novels.\nHowever, the key-value (KV) cache required for LLMs consumes substantial memory\nas context length increasing, becoming the bottleneck for deployment. In this\npaper, we present a strategy called SKVQ, which stands for sliding-window KV\ncache quantization, to address the issue of extremely low bitwidth KV cache\nquantization. To achieve this, SKVQ rearranges the channels of the KV cache in\norder to improve the similarity of channels in quantization groups, and applies\nclipped dynamic quantization at the group level. Additionally, SKVQ ensures\nthat the most recent window tokens in the KV cache are preserved with high\nprecision. This helps maintain the accuracy of a small but important portion of\nthe KV cache.SKVQ achieves high compression ratios while maintaining accuracy.\nOur evaluation on LLMs demonstrates that SKVQ surpasses previous quantization\napproaches, allowing for quantization of the KV cache to 2-bit keys and 1.5-bit\nvalues with minimal loss of accuracy. With SKVQ, it is possible to process\ncontext lengths of up to 1M on an 80GB memory GPU for a 7b model and up to 7\ntimes faster decoding."

Benchmarks on H100 GPU hosts inter-connected\nwith RDMA and TCP both show similar scalability for long-context prefill,\ndemonstrating that our method scales well using common commercial data center\nwith medium-to-low inter-host bandwidth."

By\nleveraging CLIP's single and cross-modal strengths, CapS-Adapter enhances\npredictive accuracy through the use of multimodal support sets. Our method\nachieves outstanding zero-shot classification results across 19 benchmark\ndatasets, improving accuracy by 2.19\\% over the previous leading method. Our\ncontributions are substantiated through extensive validation on multiple\nbenchmark datasets, demonstrating superior performance and robust\ngeneralization capabilities. Our code is made publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/WLuLi/CapS-Adapter."

In this\npaper, we address challenges of edge-enabled AIGC service provisioning, which\nremain underexplored in the literature. These services require executing GenAI\nmodels with billions of parameters, posing significant obstacles to\nresource-limited wireless edge. We subsequently introduce the formulation of\njoint model caching and resource allocation for AIGC services to balance a\ntrade-off between AIGC quality and latency metrics. We obtain mathematical\nrelationships of these metrics with the computational resources required by\nGenAI models via experimentation. Afterward, we decompose the formulation into\na model caching subproblem on a long-timescale and a resource allocation\nsubproblem on a short-timescale. Since the variables to be solved are discrete\nand continuous, respectively, we leverage a double deep Q-network (DDQN)\nalgorithm to solve the former subproblem and propose a diffusion-based deep\ndeterministic policy gradient (D3PG) algorithm to solve the latter. The\nproposed D3PG algorithm makes an innovative use of diffusion models as the\nactor network to determine optimal resource allocation decisions. Consequently,\nwe integrate these two learning methods within the overarching two-timescale\ndeep reinforcement learning (T2DRL) algorithm, the performance of which is\nstudied through comparative numerical simulations.",

We subsequently introduce the formulation of\njoint model caching and resource allocation for AIGC services to balance a\ntrade-off between AIGC quality and latency metrics. We obtain mathematical\nrelationships of these metrics with the computational resources required by\nGenAI models via experimentation. Afterward, we decompose the formulation into\na model caching subproblem on a long-timescale and a resource allocation\nsubproblem on a short-timescale. Since the variables to be solved are discrete\nand continuous, respectively, we leverage a double deep Q-network (DDQN)\nalgorithm to solve the former subproblem and propose a diffusion-based deep\ndeterministic policy gradient (D3PG) algorithm to solve the latter. The\nproposed D3PG algorithm makes an innovative use of diffusion models as the\nactor network to determine optimal resource allocation decisions. Consequently,\nwe integrate these two learning methods within the overarching two-timescale\ndeep reinforcement learning (T2DRL) algorithm, the performance of which is\nstudied through comparative numerical simulations."

                "summary": "We introduce the Block Transformer which adopts hierarchical global-to-local\nmodeling to autoregressive transformers to mitigate the inference bottlenecks\nassociated with self-attention. Self-attention requires the key-value (KV)\ncache of all previous sequences to be retrieved from memory at every decoding\nstep to retrieve context information, leading to two primary bottlenecks during\nbatch inference. First, there is a significant delay in obtaining the first\ntoken, as the information of the entire prompt must first be processed to\nprefill the KV cache. Second, computation of subsequent tokens is bottlenecked\nby the high memory I/O demand of fetching the entire KV cache, which grows\nlinearly with sequence length, incurring quadratic memory reads overall. We\ndesign the Block Transformer to strategically mitigate these costs, by\nincorporating coarsity and locality into an integrated global-to-local\narchitecture. At the lower layers, we aggregate tokens into fixed size blocks\nto apply attention across the entire sequence at coarse-grained detail, to\ncapture the global context while minimizing KV cache overhead. At upper layers,\nwe apply attention within each block to decode individual tokens, to model\nfine-grained details with a lightweight local KV cache. We pretrain vanilla and\nBlock Transformers from scratch and demonstrate that Block Transformers reach\n10--20x inference throughput compared to vanilla transformers with equivalent\nperplexity and zero-shot task performance. Code is available at\nhttps://github.com/itsnamgyu/block-transformer.",

                    "value": "We introduce the Block Transformer which adopts hierarchical global-to-local\nmodeling to autoregressive transformers to mitigate the inference bottlenecks\nassociated with self-attention. Self-attention requires the key-value (KV)\ncache of all previous sequences to be retrieved from memory at every decoding\nstep to retrieve context information, leading to two primary bottlenecks during\nbatch inference. First, there is a significant delay in obtaining the first\ntoken, as the information of the entire prompt must first be processed to\nprefill the KV cache. Second, computation of subsequent tokens is bottlenecked\nby the high memory I/O demand of fetching the entire KV cache, which grows\nlinearly with sequence length, incurring quadratic memory reads overall. We\ndesign the Block Transformer to strategically mitigate these costs, by\nincorporating coarsity and locality into an integrated global-to-local\narchitecture. At the lower layers, we aggregate tokens into fixed size blocks\nto apply attention across the entire sequence at coarse-grained detail, to\ncapture the global context while minimizing KV cache overhead. At upper layers,\nwe apply attention within each block to decode individual tokens, to model\nfine-grained details with a lightweight local KV cache. We pretrain vanilla and\nBlock Transformers from scratch and demonstrate that Block Transformers reach\n10--20x inference throughput compared to vanilla transformers with equivalent\nperplexity and zero-shot task performance.

The\nGraph GIC was validated with a benchmark grid, applied to the GIC calculation\nof the 500 kV power grid of Guangdong, China, and conducted preliminary\nanalysis on the grid's susceptibility to geomagnetic storms. The Graph GIC\nalgorithm has the advantage of an intuitive and highly scalable graph\nrepresentation of a power grid at any scale.

Empirical results on multiple benchmark\ndatasets demonstrate that retaining only 10% of KV cache achieves accuracy\ncomparable to that with full cache. In a speed benchmark, our method\naccelerates end-to-end latency of generating 100 tokens by up to 2.33x and\nspeeds up decoding by up to 7.08x, while reducing the memory footprint of KV\ncache in GPU by 90%."

Not only does the hand occlude\nmuch of the object, but also the object is often only visible in a small number\nof image pixels. At the same time, two strong anchors emerge in this setting:\n(1) estimated 3D hands help disambiguate the location and scale of the object,\nand (2) the set of manipulanda is small relative to all possible objects. With\nthese insights in mind, we present a scalable paradigm for hand-held object\nreconstruction that builds on recent breakthroughs in large language/vision\nmodels and 3D object datasets. Given a monocular RGB video, we aim to\nreconstruct hand-held object geometry in 3D, over time. In order to obtain the\nbest performing single frame model, we first present MCC-Hand-Object (MCC-HO),\nwhich jointly reconstructs hand and object geometry given a single RGB image\nand inferred 3D hand as inputs. Subsequently, we prompt a text-to-3D generative\nmodel using GPT-4(V) to retrieve a 3D object model that matches the object in\nthe image(s); we call this alignment Retrieval-Augmented Reconstruction (RAR).\nRAR provides unified object geometry across all frames, and the result is\nrigidly aligned with both the input images and 3D MCC-HO observations in a\ntemporally consistent manner. Experiments demonstrate that our approach\nachieves state-of-the-art performance on lab and Internet image/video datasets.\nWe make our code and models available on the project website:\nhttps://janehwu.github.io/mcc-ho",

However, traditional\nmethods, whether matching-based or embedding-based, often fall short of judging\nsubtle attributes and delivering satisfactory results. Recent advancements in\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) inspire the \"LLM-as-a-judge\" paradigm, where LLMs\nare leveraged to perform scoring, ranking, or selection across various tasks\nand applications. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of LLM-based\njudgment and assessment, offering an in-depth overview to advance this emerging\nfield. We begin by giving detailed definitions from both input and output\nperspectives. Then we introduce a comprehensive taxonomy to explore\nLLM-as-a-judge from three dimensions: what to judge, how to judge and where to\njudge. Finally, we compile benchmarks for evaluating LLM-as-a-judge and\nhighlight key challenges and promising directions, aiming to provide valuable\ninsights and inspire future research in this promising research area.

Recent advancements in\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) inspire the \"LLM-as-a-judge\" paradigm, where LLMs\nare leveraged to perform scoring, ranking, or selection across various tasks\nand applications. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of LLM-based\njudgment and assessment, offering an in-depth overview to advance this emerging\nfield. We begin by giving detailed definitions from both input and output\nperspectives. Then we introduce a comprehensive taxonomy to explore\nLLM-as-a-judge from three dimensions: what to judge, how to judge and where to\njudge. Finally, we compile benchmarks for evaluating LLM-as-a-judge and\nhighlight key challenges and promising directions, aiming to provide valuable\ninsights and inspire future research in this promising research area.

In this paper, we delve into a two-player\nparadigm that separates the roles of reasoning and critique models, where the\ncritique model provides step-level feedback to supervise the reasoning (actor)\nmodel during both test-time and train-time. We first propose AutoMathCritique,\nan automated and scalable framework for collecting critique data, resulting in\na dataset of $76,321$ responses paired with step-level feedback. Fine-tuning\nlanguage models with this dataset enables them to generate natural language\nfeedback for mathematical reasoning. We demonstrate that the critique models\nconsistently improve the actor's performance on difficult queries at test-time,\nespecially when scaling up inference-time computation. Motivated by these\nfindings, we introduce the critique-based supervision to the actor's\nself-training process, and propose a critique-in-the-loop self-improvement\nmethod. Experiments show that the method improves the actor's exploration\nefficiency and solution diversity, especially on challenging queries, leading\nto a stronger reasoning model.

Statistically,\nwe prove that prompt tuning on such simplest possible transformers are\nuniversal approximators for sequence-to-sequence Lipschitz functions. In\naddition, we provide an exponential-in-$dL$ and -in-$(1/\\epsilon)$ lower bound\non the required soft-prompt tokens for prompt tuning to memorize any dataset\nwith 1-layer, 1-head transformers. Computationally, we identify a phase\ntransition in the efficiency of prompt tuning, determined by the norm of the\n\\textit{soft-prompt-induced} keys and queries, and provide an upper bound\ncriterion. Beyond this criterion, no sub-quadratic (efficient) algorithm for\nprompt tuning exists under SETH. Within this criterion, we showcase our theory\nby proving the existence of almost-linear time prompt tuning inference\nalgorithms. These fundamental limits provide important necessary conditions for\ndesigning expressive and efficient prompt tuning methods for practitioners.",

Our key contributions are prompt tuning on\n\\textit{single-head} transformers with only a \\textit{single} self-attention\nlayer: (i) is universal, and (ii) supports efficient (even almost-linear time)\nalgorithms under the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH). Statistically,\nwe prove that prompt tuning on such simplest possible transformers are\nuniversal approximators for sequence-to-sequence Lipschitz functions. In\naddition, we provide an exponential-in-$dL$ and -in-$(1/\\epsilon)$ lower bound\non the required soft-prompt tokens for prompt tuning to memorize any dataset\nwith 1-layer, 1-head transformers. Computationally, we identify a phase\ntransition in the efficiency of prompt tuning, determined by the norm of the\n\\textit{soft-prompt-induced} keys and queries, and provide an upper bound\ncriterion. Beyond this criterion, no sub-quadratic (efficient) algorithm for\nprompt tuning exists under SETH. Within this criterion, we showcase our theory\nby proving the existence of almost-linear time prompt tuning inference\nalgorithms. These fundamental limits provide important necessary conditions for\ndesigning expressive and efficient prompt tuning methods for practitioners."

Our study presents the first-ever observed occultation\nby 29P, allowing in the future a more refined orbit and thus better predictions\nfor other occultations. The light curve reveals a solid-body detection lasting\n$3.65\\pm0.05$ seconds, corresponding to a chord length of approximately 54 km.\nThis provides a lower limit for the object's radius, measured at $27.0\\pm0.7$\nkm. We identified features on both sides of the main-body occultation around\n1,700 km from the nucleus in the sky plane for which upper limits on apparent\nopacity and equivalent width were determined. Gradual dimming within 23 km of\nthe nucleus during ingress only is interpreted as a localised dust cloud/jet\nabove the surface, with an optical depth of approximately $\\tau \\sim 0.18$.",

Our empirical evaluations\ndemonstrate that OLoRA not only converges faster but also exhibits improved\nperformance compared to standard LoRA across a variety of language modeling\ntasks.

                "summary": "The study of talking face generation mainly explores the intricacies of\nsynchronizing facial movements and crafting visually appealing,\ntemporally-coherent animations. However, due to the limited exploration of\nglobal audio perception, current approaches predominantly employ auxiliary\nvisual and spatial knowledge to stabilize the movements, which often results in\nthe deterioration of the naturalness and temporal inconsistencies.Considering\nthe essence of audio-driven animation, the audio signal serves as the ideal and\nunique priors to adjust facial expressions and lip movements, without resorting\nto interference of any visual signals.

However, due to the limited exploration of\nglobal audio perception, current approaches predominantly employ auxiliary\nvisual and spatial knowledge to stabilize the movements, which often results in\nthe deterioration of the naturalness and temporal inconsistencies.Considering\nthe essence of audio-driven animation, the audio signal serves as the ideal and\nunique priors to adjust facial expressions and lip movements, without resorting\nto interference of any visual signals.

                "summary": "One key challenge in Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is the absence of\nground-truth OOD samples during training. One principled approach to address\nthis issue is to use samples from external datasets as outliers (i.e., pseudo\nOOD samples) to train OOD detectors. However, we find empirically that the\noutlier samples often present a distribution shift compared to the true OOD\nsamples, especially in Long-Tailed Recognition (LTR) scenarios, where ID\nclasses are heavily imbalanced, \\ie, the true OOD samples exhibit very\ndifferent probability distribution to the head and tailed ID classes from the\noutliers. In this work, we propose a novel approach, namely normalized outlier\ndistribution adaptation (AdaptOD), to tackle this distribution shift problem.\nOne of its key components is dynamic outlier distribution adaptation that\neffectively adapts a vanilla outlier distribution based on the outlier samples\nto the true OOD distribution by utilizing the OOD knowledge in the predicted\nOOD samples during inference. Further, to obtain a more reliable set of\npredicted OOD samples on long-tailed ID data, a novel dual-normalized energy\nloss is introduced in AdaptOD, which leverages class- and sample-wise\nnormalized energy to enforce a more balanced prediction energy on imbalanced ID\nsamples. This helps avoid bias toward the head samples and learn a\nsubstantially better vanilla outlier distribution than existing energy losses\nduring training. It also eliminates the need of manually tuning the sensitive\nmargin hyperparameters in energy losses. Empirical results on three popular\nbenchmarks for OOD detection in LTR show the superior performance of AdaptOD\nover state-of-the-art methods.

However, the bias and invalid inference problems of\nthese regression analyses under small or sparse data conditions (i.e.,the\n\"separation\" problem) have been insufficiently investigated. We show that the\nseparation problem can adversely affect the inferences of the modified Poisson\nand least squares regressions, and to address these issues, we apply the ridge,\nlasso, and elastic-net estimating approaches to the two regression methods. As\nthe methods are not founded on the maximum likelihood principle, we propose\nregularized quasi-likelihood approaches based on the estimating equations for\nthese generalized linear models. The methods provide stable shrinkage estimates\nof risk ratios and risk differences even under separation conditions, and the\nlasso and elastic-net approaches enable simultaneous variable selection.

However, the bias and invalid inference problems of\nthese regression analyses under small or sparse data conditions (i.e.,the\n\"separation\" problem) have been insufficiently investigated. We show that the\nseparation problem can adversely affect the inferences of the modified Poisson\nand least squares regressions, and to address these issues, we apply the ridge,\nlasso, and elastic-net estimating approaches to the two regression methods. As\nthe methods are not founded on the maximum likelihood principle, we propose\nregularized quasi-likelihood approaches based on the estimating equations for\nthese generalized linear models. The methods provide stable shrinkage estimates\nof risk ratios and risk differences even under separation conditions, and the\nlasso and elastic-net approaches enable simultaneous variable selection.

For example, given a task\nlike 'turn on the ceiling light', an embodied AI agent must infer that it needs\nto locate the light switch, even though the switch is not explicitly mentioned\nin the task description. To date, no dedicated methods have been developed for\nthis problem. In this paper, we introduce Fun3DU, the first approach designed\nfor functionality understanding in 3D scenes. Fun3DU uses a language model to\nparse the task description through Chain-of-Thought reasoning in order to\nidentify the object of interest. The identified object is segmented across\nmultiple views of the captured scene by using a vision and language model. The\nsegmentation results from each view are lifted in 3D and aggregated into the\npoint cloud using geometric information. Fun3DU is training-free, relying\nentirely on pre-trained models. We evaluate Fun3DU on SceneFun3D, the most\nrecent and only dataset to benchmark this task, which comprises over 3000 task\ndescriptions on 230 scenes. Our method significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art open-vocabulary 3D segmentation approaches. Code will be\nreleased publicly.",

We use the FOGGIE simulations to study the\nmetallicity gradients ($\\nabla Z$) of six Milky Way-like galaxies throughout\ntheir evolution. FOGGIE galaxies generally exhibit steep negative gradients for\nmost of their history, with only a few short-lived instances reaching positive\nslopes that appear to arise mainly from interactions with other galaxies.\nFOGGIE concurs with other simulation results but disagrees with the robust\nobservational finding that flat and positive gradients are common at $z>1$. By\ntracking the metallicity gradient at a rapid cadence of simulation outputs\n($\\sim 5$--10 Myr), we find that theoretical gradients are highly stochastic:\nthe FOGGIE galaxies spend $\\sim 30-50$\\% of their time far away from a smoothed\ntrajectory inferred from analytic models or other, less high-cadence\nsimulations. This rapid variation makes instantaneous gradients from\nobservations more difficult to interpret in terms of physical processes.\nBecause of these geometric and stochastic complications, we explore\nnon-parametric methods of quantifying the evolving metallicity distribution at\n$z > 1$. We investigate how efficiently non-parametric measures of the 2-D\nmetallicity distribution respond to metal production and mixing. Our results\nsuggest that new methods of quantifying and interpreting gas-phase metallicity\nwill be needed to relate trends in upcoming high-$z$ {\\it JWST} observations\nwith the underlying physics of gas accretion, expulsion, and recycling in early\ngalaxies.",

                    "value": "Gas-phase metallicity gradients are a crucial element in understanding the\nchemical evolution of galaxies. We use the FOGGIE simulations to study the\nmetallicity gradients ($\\nabla Z$) of six Milky Way-like galaxies throughout\ntheir evolution. FOGGIE galaxies generally exhibit steep negative gradients for\nmost of their history, with only a few short-lived instances reaching positive\nslopes that appear to arise mainly from interactions with other galaxies.\nFOGGIE concurs with other simulation results but disagrees with the robust\nobservational finding that flat and positive gradients are common at $z>1$. By\ntracking the metallicity gradient at a rapid cadence of simulation outputs\n($\\sim 5$--10 Myr), we find that theoretical gradients are highly stochastic:\nthe FOGGIE galaxies spend $\\sim 30-50$\\% of their time far away from a smoothed\ntrajectory inferred from analytic models or other, less high-cadence\nsimulations. This rapid variation makes instantaneous gradients from\nobservations more difficult to interpret in terms of physical processes.\nBecause of these geometric and stochastic complications, we explore\nnon-parametric methods of quantifying the evolving metallicity distribution at\n$z > 1$. We investigate how efficiently non-parametric measures of the 2-D\nmetallicity distribution respond to metal production and mixing. Our results\nsuggest that new methods of quantifying and interpreting gas-phase metallicity\nwill be needed to relate trends in upcoming high-$z$ {\\it JWST} observations\nwith the underlying physics of gas accretion, expulsion, and recycling in early\ngalaxies."

In FL, clients train AI models directly on\ntheir devices rather than sharing data with a centralized server, which can\npose privacy risks. However, it has been shown that despite FL's partial\nprotection of local data privacy, information about clients' data can still be\ninferred from shared model updates during training. In recent years, several\nprivacy-preserving approaches have been developed to mitigate this privacy\nleakage in FL, though they often provide privacy at the cost of model\nperformance or system efficiency.

In this manuscript, we\nintroduce a privacy-preserving FL framework that combines differential privacy\nand system immersion tools from control theory. The core idea is to treat the\noptimization algorithms used in standard FL schemes (e.g., gradient-based\nalgorithms) as a dynamical system that we seek to immerse into a\nhigher-dimensional system (referred to as the target optimization algorithm).\nThe target algorithm's dynamics are designed such that, first, the model\nparameters of the original algorithm are immersed in its parameters; second, it\noperates on distorted parameters; and third, it converges to an encoded version\nof the true model parameters from the original algorithm. These encoded\nparameters can then be decoded at the server to retrieve the original model\nparameters.

Our key idea is to\nintegrate real-time character control with a powerful diffusion-based\ngenerative model, ensuring high-quality and diverse output motion. In the first\nstage, we instantly transform coarse user controls into diverse global\ntrajectories of the character. In the second stage, we employ a\ntransformer-based autoregressive diffusion model to generate soccer motions\nbased on trajectory conditioning. We further incorporate a contact guidance\nmodule during inference to optimize the contact details for realistic ball-foot\ninteractions. Moreover, we contribute a large-scale soccer motion dataset\nconsisting of over 1.08 million frames of diverse soccer motions. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that our SMGDiff significantly outperforms existing\nmethods in terms of motion quality and condition alignment.",

We also introduce the \"LLM-Bridge\" method to resolve the\nheterogeneous representation challenges between descriptive texts from\ndifferent modalities.

                "summary": "Debugging is an essential skill when learning to program, yet its instruction\nand emphasis often vary widely across introductory courses. In the era of\ncode-generating large language models (LLMs), the ability for students to\nreason about code and identify errors is increasingly important. However,\nstudents frequently resort to trial-and-error methods to resolve bugs without\nfully understanding the underlying issues. Developing the ability to identify\nand hypothesize the cause of bugs is crucial but can be time-consuming to teach\neffectively through traditional means. This paper introduces BugSpotter, an\ninnovative tool that leverages an LLM to generate buggy code from a problem\ndescription and verify the synthesized bugs via a test suite. Students interact\nwith BugSpotter by designing failing test cases, where the buggy code's output\ndiffers from the expected result as defined by the problem specification.

                    "value": "Debugging is an essential skill when learning to program, yet its instruction\nand emphasis often vary widely across introductory courses. In the era of\ncode-generating large language models (LLMs), the ability for students to\nreason about code and identify errors is increasingly important. However,\nstudents frequently resort to trial-and-error methods to resolve bugs without\nfully understanding the underlying issues. Developing the ability to identify\nand hypothesize the cause of bugs is crucial but can be time-consuming to teach\neffectively through traditional means. This paper introduces BugSpotter, an\ninnovative tool that leverages an LLM to generate buggy code from a problem\ndescription and verify the synthesized bugs via a test suite. Students interact\nwith BugSpotter by designing failing test cases, where the buggy code's output\ndiffers from the expected result as defined by the problem specification. This\nnot only provides opportunities for students to enhance their debugging skills,\nbut also to practice reading and understanding problem specifications. We\ndeployed BugSpotter in a large classroom setting and compared the debugging\nexercises it generated to exercises hand-crafted by an instructor for the same\nproblems.

However, deploying these models in\nreal-world multi-task learning (MTL) scenarios poses substantial challenges,\nprimarily due to high computational costs and inefficiencies in inference.\nTraditional approaches such as pruning, quantization, and knowledge\ndistillation have been explored to mitigate these issues, but they often fall\nshort in fully addressing the complexities of multi-task environments.

However, deploying these models in\nreal-world multi-task learning (MTL) scenarios poses substantial challenges,\nprimarily due to high computational costs and inefficiencies in inference.\nTraditional approaches such as pruning, quantization, and knowledge\ndistillation have been explored to mitigate these issues, but they often fall\nshort in fully addressing the complexities of multi-task environments.

SVG holds great potential for diverse\ncontent creation in media and entertainment; however, it also presents\nsignificant challenges: (1) objects must exhibit a range of fine-grained,\ncomplex motions, (2) multiple objects need to appear consistently across\nscenes, and (3) subjects may require multiple motions with seamless transitions\nwithin a single scene. To address these challenges, we propose DreamRunner, a\nnovel story-to-video generation method: First, we structure the input script\nusing a large language model (LLM) to facilitate both coarse-grained scene\nplanning as well as fine-grained object-level layout and motion planning. Next,\nDreamRunner presents retrieval-augmented test-time adaptation to capture target\nmotion priors for objects in each scene, supporting diverse motion\ncustomization based on retrieved videos, thus facilitating the generation of\nnew videos with complex, scripted motions. Lastly, we propose a novel\nspatial-temporal region-based 3D attention and prior injection module SR3AI for\nfine-grained object-motion binding and frame-by-frame semantic control. We\ncompare DreamRunner with various SVG baselines, demonstrating state-of-the-art\nperformance in character consistency, text alignment, and smooth transitions.\nAdditionally, DreamRunner exhibits strong fine-grained condition-following\nability in compositional text-to-video generation, significantly outperforming\nbaselines on T2V-ComBench. Finally, we validate DreamRunner's robust ability to\ngenerate multi-object interactions with qualitative examples.",

In this paper, we introduce EnStack, a novel ensemble\nstacking framework that enhances vulnerability detection using natural language\nprocessing (NLP) techniques. Our approach synergizes multiple pre-trained large\nlanguage models (LLMs) specialized in code understanding CodeBERT for semantic\nanalysis, GraphCodeBERT for structural representation, and UniXcoder for\ncross-modal capabilities. By fine-tuning these models on the Draper VDISC\ndataset and integrating their outputs through meta-classifiers such as Logistic\nRegression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, and XGBoost, EnStack\neffectively captures intricate code patterns and vulnerabilities that\nindividual models may overlook. The meta-classifiers consolidate the strengths\nof each LLM, resulting in a comprehensive model that excels in detecting subtle\nand complex vulnerabilities across diverse programming contexts. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that EnStack significantly outperforms existing methods,\nachieving notable improvements in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.\nThis work highlights the potential of ensemble LLM approaches in code analysis\ntasks and offers valuable insights into applying NLP techniques for advancing\nautomated vulnerability detection.",

                    "value": "Automated detection of software vulnerabilities is critical for enhancing\nsecurity, yet existing methods often struggle with the complexity and diversity\nof modern codebases. In this paper, we introduce EnStack, a novel ensemble\nstacking framework that enhances vulnerability detection using natural language\nprocessing (NLP) techniques. Our approach synergizes multiple pre-trained large\nlanguage models (LLMs) specialized in code understanding CodeBERT for semantic\nanalysis, GraphCodeBERT for structural representation, and UniXcoder for\ncross-modal capabilities. By fine-tuning these models on the Draper VDISC\ndataset and integrating their outputs through meta-classifiers such as Logistic\nRegression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, and XGBoost, EnStack\neffectively captures intricate code patterns and vulnerabilities that\nindividual models may overlook. The meta-classifiers consolidate the strengths\nof each LLM, resulting in a comprehensive model that excels in detecting subtle\nand complex vulnerabilities across diverse programming contexts. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that EnStack significantly outperforms existing methods,\nachieving notable improvements in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.\nThis work highlights the potential of ensemble LLM approaches in code analysis\ntasks and offers valuable insights into applying NLP techniques for advancing\nautomated vulnerability detection."

In this paper, we present how analogy\nfrom similarly structured questions can improve LLMs' problem-solving\ncapabilities for MWPs. Specifically, we rely on the retrieval of problems with\nsimilar computational graphs to the given question to serve as exemplars in the\nprompt, providing the correct reasoning path for the generation model to refer\nto. Empirical results across six math word problem datasets demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our proposed method, which achieves a significant improvement\nof up to 6.7 percent on average in absolute value, compared to baseline\nmethods. These results highlight our method's potential in addressing the\nreasoning challenges in current LLMs."

Previous work on the\nsize and nature of this gap produced mixed evidence with inconclusive results.\nIn this paper, we introduce a controlled setting for investigating two-hop\nreasoning in LLMs, where the above-chance performance constitutes undeniable\nevidence for latent reasoning. We fine-tune LLMs (including Llama 3 8B Instruct\nand GPT-4o) on fictional facts and confirm that they generalize to answering\ntwo-hop questions about them using CoT. We find that models can perform latent\nreasoning when facts appear together during training or in the prompt. However,\nto our surprise, models completely fail at two-hop reasoning without CoT when\nlearned facts only appear in different documents, achieving chance-level\naccuracy and chance-level test loss. We call this complete failure to compose\nseparately learned facts the Two-Hop Curse. Moreover, we evaluate 9 frontier\nLLMs on real-world facts, finding that models completely fail at two-hop no-CoT\nreasoning for over half of question categories while maintaining partial\nsuccess with CoT across most categories. These results suggest that LLMs lack a\ngeneral capability for latent multi-hop reasoning independent of the question\ntype.",

Previous work on the\nsize and nature of this gap produced mixed evidence with inconclusive results.\nIn this paper, we introduce a controlled setting for investigating two-hop\nreasoning in LLMs, where the above-chance performance constitutes undeniable\nevidence for latent reasoning. We fine-tune LLMs (including Llama 3 8B Instruct\nand GPT-4o) on fictional facts and confirm that they generalize to answering\ntwo-hop questions about them using CoT. We find that models can perform latent\nreasoning when facts appear together during training or in the prompt. However,\nto our surprise, models completely fail at two-hop reasoning without CoT when\nlearned facts only appear in different documents, achieving chance-level\naccuracy and chance-level test loss. We call this complete failure to compose\nseparately learned facts the Two-Hop Curse. Moreover, we evaluate 9 frontier\nLLMs on real-world facts, finding that models completely fail at two-hop no-CoT\nreasoning for over half of question categories while maintaining partial\nsuccess with CoT across most categories. These results suggest that LLMs lack a\ngeneral capability for latent multi-hop reasoning independent of the question\ntype."

Unfortunately, prior studies overlook the tool execution costs,\nleading to the generation of expensive plans of which the costs outweigh task\nperformance. To fill this gap, we propose the Cost-Aware Tool Planning with\nLLMs (CATP-LLM) framework, which for the first time provides a coherent design\nto empower LLMs for cost-aware tool planning. Specifically, CATP-LLM\nincorporates a tool planning language to enhance the LLM to generate\nnon-sequential plans of multiple branches for efficient concurrent tool\nexecution and cost reduction. Moreover, it further designs a cost-aware offline\nreinforcement learning algorithm to fine-tune the LLM to optimize the\nperformance-cost trade-off in tool planning. In lack of public cost-related\ndatasets, we further present OpenCATP, the first platform for cost-aware\nplanning evaluation. Experiments on OpenCATP show that CATP-LLM outperforms\nGPT-4 even when using Llama2-7B as its backbone, with the average improvement\nof 28.2%-30.2% higher plan performance and 24.7%-45.8% lower costs even on the\nchallenging planning tasks.

An intuitive\napproach to enhance the multilingual capabilities would be to construct\ninstruction data for various languages, but constructing instruction data for\nover 100 languages is prohibitively costly. In this paper, we introduce BayLing\n2, which efficiently transfers generative capabilities and knowledge from\nhigh-resource languages to low-resource languages through language alignment.\nTo achieve this, we constructed a dataset of 3.2 million instructions,\ncomprising high-resource language instructions (Chinese and English) and\ncross-lingual instructions for 100+ languages and performed instruction tuning\nbased on the dataset to facilitate the capability transfer between languages.\nUsing Llama as the foundation model, we developed BayLing-2-7B, BayLing-2-13B,\nand BayLing-3-8B, and conducted a comprehensive evaluation of BayLing. For\nmultilingual translation across 100+ languages, BayLing shows superior\nperformance compared to open-source models of similar scale. For multilingual\nknowledge and understanding benchmarks, BayLing achieves significant\nimprovements across over 20 low-resource languages, demonstrating its\ncapability of effective knowledge transfer from high-resource to low-resource\nlanguages.

To address this challenge, we turn to\nprofessional news reports, which naturally contain a gold standard for\nimage-text sequences.

On the other hand, we tested two\ncounterspeech strategies: (a) promoting empathy and (b) warning about the\nconsequences of online misbehavior. We then measured whether users deleted\ntheir initial hateful posts and whether their behavior changed after the\ncounterspeech intervention (e.g., whether users adopted a less toxic language).\nWe find that non-contextualized counterspeech employing a\nwarning-of-consequence strategy significantly reduces online hate speech.\nHowever, contextualized counterspeech generated by LLMs proves ineffective and\nmay even backfire.",

This method operates based on the\ninput and output representations associated with each token. First, we\ndemonstrate that during the pre-training of LLMs, the norms of word embeddings\ncapture the importance of input tokens. Second, we reveal a significant\nrelationship between a token's importance and the extent to which its\nrepresentation can resemble the model's final prediction. Through extensive\nanalysis, we show that our approach consistently outperforms existing\ngradient-based methods in terms of faithfulness. Additionally, our method\nachieves better performance in layer-wise explanations compared to the most\nprominent architecture-specific methods."

Experimental results demonstrate that StepTool\nsignificantly outperforms existing methods in multi-step, tool-based tasks,\nproviding a robust solution for complex task environments.

The emergence of foundation\nmodels as the \"brain\" of EAI agents for high-level task planning has shown\npromising results.

For instance, a\nhousekeeping robot lacking sufficient risk awareness might place a metal\ncontainer in a microwave, potentially causing a fire. To address these critical\nsafety concerns, comprehensive pre-deployment risk assessments are imperative.\nThis study introduces EAIRiskBench, a novel framework for automated physical\nrisk assessment in EAI scenarios. EAIRiskBench employs a multi-agent\ncooperative system that leverages various foundation models to generate safety\nguidelines, create risk-prone scenarios, make task planning, and evaluate\nsafety systematically. Utilizing this framework, we construct EAIRiskDataset,\ncomprising diverse test cases across various domains, encompassing both textual\nand visual scenarios. Our comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art\nfoundation models reveals alarming results: all models exhibit high task risk\nrates (TRR), with an average of 95.75% across all evaluated models. To address\nthese challenges, we further propose two prompting-based risk mitigation\nstrategies. While these strategies demonstrate some efficacy in reducing TRR,\nthe improvements are limited, still indicating substantial safety concerns.\nThis study provides the first large-scale assessment of physical risk awareness\nin EAI agents.

Our\nexperimental results demonstrate that MixPE surpasses the state-of-the-art\nquantization accelerators by $2.6\\times$ speedup and $1.4\\times$ energy\nreduction."

However, these\napproaches still have limitations that leave the door open for detection and\nmitigation due to their inherent design to cause malicious behavior in the\npresence of a trigger. To address this limitation, we introduce Deferred\nActivated Backdoor Functionality (DABF), a new paradigm in backdoor attacks.\nUnlike conventional attacks, DABF initially conceals its backdoor, producing\nbenign outputs even when triggered. This stealthy behavior allows DABF to\nbypass multiple detection and defense methods, remaining undetected during\ninitial inspections. The backdoor functionality is strategically activated only\nafter the model undergoes subsequent updates, such as retraining on benign\ndata. DABF attacks exploit the common practice in the life cycle of machine\nlearning models to perform model updates and fine-tuning after initial\ndeployment. To implement DABF attacks, we approach the problem by making the\nunlearning of the backdoor fragile, allowing it to be easily cancelled and\nsubsequently reactivate the backdoor functionality. To achieve this, we propose\na novel two-stage training scheme, called DeferBad.

Following this advancement,\nresearchers and companies have begun integrating LLMs across the hardware\ndesign and verification process. However, these highly potent LLMs can also\ninduce new attack scenarios upon security vulnerabilities across the hardware\ndevelopment process. One such attack vector that has not been explored is\nintellectual property (IP) piracy. Given that this attack can manifest as\nrewriting hardware designs to evade piracy detection, it is essential to\nthoroughly evaluate LLM capabilities in performing this task and assess the\nmitigation abilities of current IP piracy detection tools.\n  Therefore, in this work, we propose LLMPirate, the first LLM-based technique\nable to generate pirated variations of circuit designs that successfully evade\ndetection across multiple state-of-the-art piracy detection tools. We devise\nthree solutions to overcome challenges related to integration of LLMs for\nhardware circuit designs, scalability to large circuits, and effectiveness,\nresulting in an end-to-end automated, efficient, and practical formulation. We\nperform an extensive experimental evaluation of LLMPirate using eight LLMs of\nvarying sizes and capabilities and assess their performance in pirating various\ncircuit designs against four state-of-the-art, widely-used piracy detection\ntools. Our experiments demonstrate that LLMPirate is able to consistently evade\ndetection on 100% of tested circuits across every detection tool. Additionally,\nwe showcase the ramifications of LLMPirate using case studies on IBEX and\nMOR1KX processors and a GPS module, that we successfully pirate.

This survey is\nstructured into four main sections: we first describe an overview of\ncontinually learning LLMs, consisting of two directions of continuity: vertical\ncontinuity (or vertical continual learning), i.e., continual adaptation from\ngeneral to specific capabilities, and horizontal continuity (or horizontal\ncontinual learning), i.e., continual adaptation across time and domains\n(Section 3). We then summarize three stages of learning LLMs in the context of\nmodern CL: Continual Pre-Training (CPT), Domain-Adaptive Pre-training (DAP),\nand Continual Fine-Tuning (CFT) (Section 4).

This review aims to investigate the\napplication of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, particularly Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) and transformer architectures, in deciphering genomic\ncodes, focusing on tokenization, transformer models, and regulatory annotation\nprediction. The goal of this review is to assess data and model accessibility\nin the most recent literature, gaining a better understanding of the existing\ncapabilities and constraints of these tools in processing genomic sequencing\ndata.\n  Methods: Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and\nMeta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, our scoping review was conducted across\nPubMed, Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase, and ACM Digital Library.\nStudies were included if they focused on NLP methodologies applied to genomic\nsequencing data analysis, without restrictions on publication date or article\ntype.\n  Results: A total of 26 studies published between 2021 and April 2024 were\nselected for review. The review highlights that tokenization and transformer\nmodels enhance the processing and understanding of genomic data, with\napplications in predicting regulatory annotations like transcription-factor\nbinding sites and chromatin accessibility.\n  Discussion: The application of NLP and LLMs to genomic sequencing data\ninterpretation is a promising field that can help streamline the processing of\nlarge-scale genomic data while also providing a better understanding of its\ncomplex structures. It has the potential to drive advancements in personalized\nmedicine by offering more efficient and scalable solutions for genomic\nanalysis. Further research is also needed to discuss and overcome current\nlimitations, enhancing model transparency and applicability.",

                    "value": "Objectives: The vast and complex nature of human genomic sequencing data\npresents challenges for effective analysis. This review aims to investigate the\napplication of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, particularly Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) and transformer architectures, in deciphering genomic\ncodes, focusing on tokenization, transformer models, and regulatory annotation\nprediction. The goal of this review is to assess data and model accessibility\nin the most recent literature, gaining a better understanding of the existing\ncapabilities and constraints of these tools in processing genomic sequencing\ndata.\n  Methods: Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and\nMeta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, our scoping review was conducted across\nPubMed, Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase, and ACM Digital Library.\nStudies were included if they focused on NLP methodologies applied to genomic\nsequencing data analysis, without restrictions on publication date or article\ntype.\n  Results: A total of 26 studies published between 2021 and April 2024 were\nselected for review. The review highlights that tokenization and transformer\nmodels enhance the processing and understanding of genomic data, with\napplications in predicting regulatory annotations like transcription-factor\nbinding sites and chromatin accessibility.\n  Discussion: The application of NLP and LLMs to genomic sequencing data\ninterpretation is a promising field that can help streamline the processing of\nlarge-scale genomic data while also providing a better understanding of its\ncomplex structures. It has the potential to drive advancements in personalized\nmedicine by offering more efficient and scalable solutions for genomic\nanalysis. Further research is also needed to discuss and overcome current\nlimitations, enhancing model transparency and applicability."

DiTAS relies on the proposed temporal-aggregated smoothing\ntechniques to mitigate the impact of the channel-wise outliers within the input\nactivations, leading to much lower quantization error under extremely low\nbitwidth. To further enhance the performance of the quantized DiT, we adopt the\nlayer-wise grid search strategy to optimize the smoothing factor. Moreover, we\nintegrate a training-free LoRA module for weight quantization, leveraging\nalternating optimization to minimize quantization errors without additional\nfine-tuning.

DiTAS relies on the proposed temporal-aggregated smoothing\ntechniques to mitigate the impact of the channel-wise outliers within the input\nactivations, leading to much lower quantization error under extremely low\nbitwidth. To further enhance the performance of the quantized DiT, we adopt the\nlayer-wise grid search strategy to optimize the smoothing factor. Moreover, we\nintegrate a training-free LoRA module for weight quantization, leveraging\nalternating optimization to minimize quantization errors without additional\nfine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach enables 4-bit\nweight, 8-bit activation (W4A8) quantization for DiTs while maintaining\ncomparable performance as the full-precision model."

Our findings reveal varying levels of memorization, with\nthe strongest effect observed in factual question answering. Furthermore, while\nmodel performance improves across all tasks as LLM size increases, only factual\nquestion answering shows an increase in memorization, whereas machine\ntranslation and reasoning tasks exhibit greater generalization, producing more\nnovel outputs.

FairServe proposes\napplication-characteristic aware request throttling coupled with a weighted\nservice counter based scheduling technique to curb abusive behavior and ensure\nfairness. Our experimental results on real-world traces demonstrate FairServe's\nsuperior performance compared to the state-of-the-art method in ensuring\nfairness. We are actively working on deploying our system in production,\nexpecting to benefit millions of customers world-wide."

As more papers are published, researchers and developers face the\nchallenge of information overload. Thus, developing a system that can\nautomatically extract and organise key information about LLMs from academic\npapers is particularly important. The standard format for documenting\ninformation about LLMs is the LLM model card (\\textbf{LLM-Card}). We propose a\nmethod for automatically generating LLM model cards from scientific\npublications. We use Named Entity Recognition (\\textbf{NER}) and Relation\nExtraction (\\textbf{RE}) methods that automatically extract key information\nabout LLMs from the papers, helping researchers to access information about\nLLMs efficiently. These features include model \\textit{licence}, model\n\\textit{name}, and model \\textit{application}. With these features, we can form\na model card for each paper. We processed 106 academic papers by defining three\ndictionaries -- LLM's name, licence, and application. 11,051 sentences were\nextracted through dictionary lookup, and the dataset was constructed through\nmanual review of the final selection of 129 sentences with a link between the\nname and the \\textit{licence}, and 106 sentences with a link between the model\nname and the \\textit{application}. The resulting resource is relevant for LLM\ncard illustrations using relational knowledge graphs. Our code and findings can\ncontribute to automatic LLM card generation.

Eosinophils (Eos), a crucial component in\nthe mucosal immune response, have been linked to disease severity in CRS. The\ndiagnosis of eosinophilic CRS typically uses a threshold of 10-20 eos per\nhigh-power field (HPF). However, manually counting Eos in histological samples\nis laborious and time-intensive, making the use of AI-driven methods for\nautomated evaluations highly desirable. Interestingly, eosinophils are\npredominantly located in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, which has prompted\nthe release of numerous deep learning models trained on GI data. This study\nleverages a CircleSnake model initially trained on upper-GI data to segment Eos\ncells in whole slide images (WSIs) of nasal tissues.

We applied our method for doping\ndetection in sports, focusing on steroid metabolism, and evaluated using\nreal-world data from athletes.
