Although visual\ncropping techniques seem promising, recent approaches have several limitations:\nthe need for task-specific fine-tuning, low efficiency due to uninformed\nexhaustive search, or incompatibility with efficient attention implementations.\nWe address these shortcomings by proposing a training-free visual cropping\nmethod, dubbed FOCUS, that leverages MLLM-internal representations to guide the\nsearch for the most relevant image region. This is accomplished in four steps:\nfirst, we identify the target object(s) in the VQA prompt; second, we compute\nan object relevance map using the key-value (KV) cache; third, we propose and\nrank relevant image regions based on the map; and finally, we perform the\nfine-grained VQA task using the top-ranked region. As a result of this informed\nsearch strategy, FOCUS achieves strong performance across four fine-grained VQA\ndatasets and two types of MLLMs. It outperforms three popular visual cropping\nmethods in both accuracy and efficiency, and matches the best-performing\nbaseline, ZoomEye, while requiring 3 - 6.5 x less compute.",

Our approach achieves over 90% of\npredictions within 10% relative error on GPU kernels executed on AMD MI250 and\nMI300X architectures.

In a recent study, differences of up to a factor\nof 2 were found between the predicted survival of floating and adherent cells.\nThe present work aims to quantify the biases introduced by the simulation setup\nand the use of voxelized geometry in conjunction with the local effect model\nfor cell survival. The results show that simulated irradiation of a cell near\nthe surface with an incident beam matched to the cell dimensions results in\ndose values that are by a factor of about 50 lower than the dose to cells\ndeeper in the medium when irradiated with a Co-60 spectrum and lateral beam\ndimensions in the centimeter range. Furthermore, the number of ionizing photon\ninteractions in gold nanoparticles in a cell near the surface is lower by a\nfactor of about 2 than for cells at 5 mm and 1 cm depth. Using the average dose\nin voxels of size in the order of 200 nm for assessing cell survival with the\nlocal effect model (LEM) leads to an underestimation of the number of lesions\nfrom a single ionized AuNP by roughly two orders of magnitude and thus to an\noverestimation of cell survival. The effect of cell geometry on the survival\nrate was examined for approximate cell geometries and 100 kV x-ray irradiation,\nfor which the probability of photon interaction in gold nanoparticles is by\nmore than two orders of magnitude higher than for Co-60 irradiation. The\nresults show that the effects are negligible for 5 nm nanoparticles at the\nconcentration of AuNPs considered in preceding work. For 50 nm nanoparticles\nand thus a thousand times higher mass fraction of gold, significant reduction\nin cell survival is found, with a clear additional reduction predicted by the\nLEM as compared to the prediction based on mean dose to the nucleus.",

                "summary": "Advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance\nacross a wide range of complex and long-context natural language tasks.\nHowever, performing long-context LLM inference locally on a commodity GPU (a\nPC) with privacy concerns remains challenging due to the increasing memory\ndemands of the key-value (KV) cache. Existing systems typically identify\nimportant tokens and selectively offload their KV data to GPU and CPU memory.\nThe KV data needs to be offloaded to disk due to the limited memory on a\ncommodity GPU, but the process is bottlenecked by token importance evaluation\noverhead and the disk's low bandwidth. In this paper, we present LeoAM, the\nfirst efficient importance-aware long-context LLM inference system for a single\ncommodity GPU with adaptive hierarchical GPU-CPU-Disk KV management. Our system\nemploys an adaptive KV management strategy that partitions KV data into\nvariable-sized chunks based on the skewed distribution of attention weights\nacross different layers to reduce computational and additional transmission\noverheads. Moreover, we propose a lightweight KV abstract method, which\nminimizes transmission latency by storing and extracting the KV abstract of\neach chunk on disk instead of the full KV data. LeoAM also leverages the\ndynamic compression and pipeline techniques to further accelerate inference.\nExperimental results demonstrate that LongInfer achieves an average inference\nlatency speedup of 3.46x, while maintaining comparable LLM response quality. In\nscenarios with larger batch sizes, it achieves up to a 5.47x speedup.",

We propose CronusVLA, a unified framework that extends\nsingle-frame VLA models to the multi-frame paradigm through an efficient\npost-training stage. CronusVLA comprises three key components: (1) single-frame\npretraining on large-scale embodied datasets with autoregressive action tokens\nprediction, which establishes an embodied vision-language foundation; (2)\nmulti-frame encoding, adapting the prediction of vision-language backbones from\ndiscrete action tokens to motion features during post-training, and aggregating\nmotion features from historical frames into a feature chunking; (3) cross-frame\ndecoding, which maps the feature chunking to accurate actions via a shared\ndecoder with cross-attention. By reducing redundant token computation and\ncaching past motion features, CronusVLA achieves efficient inference. As an\napplication of motion features, we further propose an action adaptation\nmechanism based on feature-action retrieval to improve model performance during\nfinetuning. CronusVLA achieves state-of-the-art performance on SimplerEnv with\n70.9% success rate, and 12.7% improvement over OpenVLA on LIBERO.

We observe that quantizing\nthe KV cache of different tokens has varying impacts on the quality of\nattention outputs. To systematically investigate this phenomenon, we perform\nforward error propagation analysis on attention and propose the Anchor Score\n(AnS) that quantifies the sensitivity of each token's KV cache to\nquantization-induced error. Our analysis reveals significant disparities in AnS\nacross tokens, suggesting that preserving a small subset with full precision\n(FP16) of high-AnS tokens can greatly mitigate accuracy loss in aggressive\nquantization scenarios. Based on this insight, we introduce AnTKV, a novel\nframework that leverages Anchor Token-aware Vector Quantization to compress the\nKV cache. Furthermore, to support efficient deployment, we design and develop a\ntriton kernel that is fully compatible with FlashAttention, enabling fast\nonline Anchor Token selection. AnTKV enables LLaMA-3-8B to handle context\nlengths up to 840K tokens on a single 80GB A100 GPU, while achieving up to 3.5x\nhigher decoding throughput compared to the FP16 baseline. Our experiment\nresults demonstrate that AnTKV matches or outperforms prior works such as KIVI,\nSKVQ, KVQuant, and CQ under 4-bit settings. More importantly, AnTKV achieves\nsignificantly lower perplexity under ultra-low-bit quantization on Mistral-7B,\nwith only 6.32 at 1-bit and 8.87 at 0.375-bit, compared to the FP16 baseline of\n4.73.",

Prior modular\npipelines offer interpretability but lack unified memory, while end-to-end\n(M)LLM agents excel at fusing vision and language yet remain constrained by\nfixed context windows and implicit spatial reasoning. We introduce\n\\textbf{Mem4Nav}, a hierarchical spatial-cognition long-short memory system\nthat can augment any VLN backbone. Mem4Nav fuses a sparse octree for\nfine-grained voxel indexing with a semantic topology graph for high-level\nlandmark connectivity, storing both in trainable memory tokens embedded via a\nreversible Transformer. Long-term memory (LTM) compresses and retains\nhistorical observations at both octree and graph nodes, while short-term memory\n(STM) caches recent multimodal entries in relative coordinates for real-time\nobstacle avoidance and local planning. At each step, STM retrieval sharply\nprunes dynamic context, and, when deeper history is needed, LTM tokens are\ndecoded losslessly to reconstruct past embeddings. Evaluated on Touchdown and\nMap2Seq across three backbones (modular, state-of-the-art VLN with prompt-based\nLLM, and state-of-the-art VLN with strided-attention MLLM), Mem4Nav yields 7-13\npp gains in Task Completion, sufficient SPD reduction, and >10 pp nDTW\nimprovement.

The widespread usage of sparse data has inspired many in-memory and\non-disk storage formats, but the only widely adopted storage specifications are\nthe Matrix Market and FROSTT file formats, which both use ASCII text. Due to\nthe inefficiency of text storage, these files typically have larger file sizes\nand longer parsing times than binary storage formats, which directly store an\nin-memory representation to disk. This can be a major bottleneck; since sparse\ncomputation is often bandwidth-bound, the cost of loading or storing a matrix\nto disk often exceeds the cost of performing a sparse computation. While it is\ncommon practice for practitioners to develop their own, custom, non-portable\nbinary formats for high-performance sparse matrix storage, there is currently\nno cross-platform binary sparse matrix storage format. We present Binsparse, a\ncross-platform binary sparse matrix and tensor format specification. Binsparse\nis a modular, embeddable format, consisting of a JSON descriptor, which\ndescribes the matrix or tensor dimensions, type, and format, and a series of\nbinary arrays, which can be stored in all modern binary containers, such as\nHDF5, Zarr, or NPZ. We provide several reference implementations of Binsparse\nspanning 5 languages, 5 frameworks, and 4 binary containers. We evaluate our\nBinsparse format on every matrix in the SuiteSparse Matrix Collection and a\nselection of tensors from the FROSTT collection. The Binsparse HDF5 CSR format\nshows file size reductions of 2.4x on average without compression and 7.5x with\ncompression. We evaluate our parser's read/write performance against a\nstate-of-the-art Matrix Market parser, demonstrating warm cache mean read\nspeedups of 26.5x without compression and 2.6x with compression, and write\nspeedups of 31x without compression and 1.4x with compression.",

A cryptographically sealed firmware-over-the-air\npipeline welds each TA set to an Android system image, enabling hot-swap\nupdates while Verified Boot enforces rollback protection. Every package carries\na chained signature developer first, registry second so even a compromised\nsupply chain cannot smuggle malicious code past the Secure World's RSA-PSS\ngatekeeper. Inside the TEE, strict inter-TA isolation, cache partitioning, and\nGP-compliant crypto APIs ensure secrets never bleed across trust boundaries or\ntiming domains. The Rich Execution Environment can interact only via\nhardware-mediated Secure Monitor Calls, collapsing the surface exposed to\nmalware in Android space. End-users enjoy a single polished interface yet can\ninstall or retire Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, or tomorrow's chain with one tap,\nshrinking both storage footprint and audit scope. For auditors, the composition\nmodel slashes duplicated verification effort by quarantining blockchain logic\ninside narrowly scoped modules that share formally specified interfaces. Our\nthreat analysis spans six adversary layers and shows how the design neutralizes\nREE malware sniffing, OTA injection, and cross-module side channels without\nexotic hardware.

By welding radical extensibility to hardware-anchored assurance, the\nplatform closes the security-usability gap that has long stymied mass-market\nself-custody.

Digital twin\n(DT), an emerging technology, can predict, estimate, and analyze real-time\nstates by digitally modeling objects in the physical world. By integrating DT\nwith VEC, a virtual vehicle DT can be created in the VEC server to monitor the\nreal-time operating status of vehicles. However, maintaining the vehicle DT\nmodel requires ongoing attention from the VEC server, which also needs to offer\ncomputing services for the vehicles. Therefore, effective allocation and\nscheduling of VEC server resources are crucial. This study focuses on a general\nVEC network with a single VEC service and multiple vehicles, examining the two\ntypes of delays caused by twin maintenance and computational processing within\nthe network. By transforming the problem using satisfaction functions, we\npropose an optimization problem aimed at maximizing each vehicle's resource\nutility to determine the optimal resource allocation strategy. Given the\nnon-convex nature of the issue, we employ multi-agent Markov decision processes\nto reformulate the problem.

It offers significant inference speedups, enables\nfine-grained control over the quality-latency trade-off, and adapts seamlessly\nto different diffusion models. Notably, ECAD's learned schedules can generalize\neffectively to resolutions and model variants not seen during calibration. We\nevaluate ECAD on PixArt-alpha, PixArt-Sigma, and FLUX-1.dev using multiple\nmetrics (FID, CLIP, Image Reward) across diverse benchmarks (COCO, MJHQ-30k,\nPartiPrompts), demonstrating consistent improvements over previous approaches.\nOn PixArt-alpha, ECAD identifies a schedule that outperforms the previous\nstate-of-the-art method by 4.47 COCO FID while increasing inference speedup\nfrom 2.35x to 2.58x. Our results establish ECAD as a scalable and generalizable\napproach for accelerating diffusion inference.

Notably, ECAD's learned schedules can generalize\neffectively to resolutions and model variants not seen during calibration. We\nevaluate ECAD on PixArt-alpha, PixArt-Sigma, and FLUX-1.dev using multiple\nmetrics (FID, CLIP, Image Reward) across diverse benchmarks (COCO, MJHQ-30k,\nPartiPrompts), demonstrating consistent improvements over previous approaches.\nOn PixArt-alpha, ECAD identifies a schedule that outperforms the previous\nstate-of-the-art method by 4.47 COCO FID while increasing inference speedup\nfrom 2.35x to 2.58x. Our results establish ECAD as a scalable and generalizable\napproach for accelerating diffusion inference.

We present PentaRAG, a five-layer module that routes each\nquery through two instant caches (fixed key-value and semantic), a\nmemory-recall mode that exploits the LLM's own weights, an adaptive session\nmemory, and a conventional retrieval-augmentation layer. Implemented with\nMistral-8B, Milvus and vLLM, the system can answer most repeated or\nsemantically similar questions from low-latency caches while retaining full\nretrieval for novel queries. On the TriviaQA domain, LoRA fine-tuning combined\nwith the memory-recall layer raises answer similarity by approximately 8% and\nfactual correctness by approximately 16% over the base model. Under a\nnine-session runtime simulation, cache warming reduces mean latency from\nseveral seconds to well below one second and shifts traffic toward the fast\npaths. Resource-efficiency tests show that PentaRAG cuts average GPU time to\n0.248 seconds per query, roughly half that of a naive RAG baseline, and\nsustains an aggregate throughput of approximately 100,000 queries per second on\nour setup. These results demonstrate that a layered routing strategy can\ndeliver freshness, speed, and efficiency simultaneously in production-grade RAG\nsystems.",

                    "value": "Enterprise deployments of large-language model (LLM) demand continuously\nchanging document collections with sub-second latency and predictable GPU cost\nrequirements that classical Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines only\npartially satisfy. We present PentaRAG, a five-layer module that routes each\nquery through two instant caches (fixed key-value and semantic), a\nmemory-recall mode that exploits the LLM's own weights, an adaptive session\nmemory, and a conventional retrieval-augmentation layer. Implemented with\nMistral-8B, Milvus and vLLM, the system can answer most repeated or\nsemantically similar questions from low-latency caches while retaining full\nretrieval for novel queries. On the TriviaQA domain, LoRA fine-tuning combined\nwith the memory-recall layer raises answer similarity by approximately 8% and\nfactual correctness by approximately 16% over the base model. Under a\nnine-session runtime simulation, cache warming reduces mean latency from\nseveral seconds to well below one second and shifts traffic toward the fast\npaths. Resource-efficiency tests show that PentaRAG cuts average GPU time to\n0.248 seconds per query, roughly half that of a naive RAG baseline, and\nsustains an aggregate throughput of approximately 100,000 queries per second on\nour setup. These results demonstrate that a layered routing strategy can\ndeliver freshness, speed, and efficiency simultaneously in production-grade RAG\nsystems."

To achieve this, existing\nmethods often require intricate modifications to prompting and sampling\nstrategies. In this work, we introduce representation consistency (RC), a\ntest-time scaling method for aggregating answers drawn from multiple candidate\nresponses of an LLM regardless of how they were generated, including variations\nin prompt phrasing and sampling strategy. RC enhances answer aggregation by not\nonly considering the number of occurrences of each answer in the candidate\nresponse set, but also the consistency of the model's internal activations\nwhile generating the set of responses leading to each answer. These activations\ncan be either dense (raw model activations) or sparse (encoded via pretrained\nsparse autoencoders). Our rationale is that if the model's representations of\nmultiple responses converging on the same answer are highly variable, this\nanswer is more likely to be the result of incoherent reasoning and should be\ndown-weighted during aggregation. Importantly, our method only uses cached\nactivations and lightweight similarity computations and requires no additional\nmodel queries. Through experiments with four open-source LLMs and four\nreasoning datasets, we validate the effectiveness of RC for improving task\nperformance during inference, with consistent accuracy improvements (up to 4%)\nover strong test-time scaling baselines. We also show that consistency in the\nsparse activation signals aligns well with the common notion of coherent\nreasoning.",

To address these challenges, we\npropose Causal Diffusion Policy (CDP), a novel transformer-based diffusion\nmodel that enhances action prediction by conditioning on historical action\nsequences, thereby enabling more coherent and context-aware visuomotor policy\nlearning. To further mitigate the computational cost associated with\nautoregressive inference, a caching mechanism is also introduced to store\nattention key-value pairs from previous timesteps, substantially reducing\nredundant computations during execution. Extensive experiments in both\nsimulated and real-world environments, spanning diverse 2D and 3D manipulation\ntasks, demonstrate that CDP uniquely leverages historical action sequences to\nachieve significantly higher accuracy than existing methods. Moreover, even\nwhen faced with degraded input observation quality, CDP maintains remarkable\nprecision by reasoning through temporal continuity, which highlights its\npractical robustness for robotic control under realistic, imperfect conditions.",

Most prior works assume pre-segmented speech,\nlimiting their real-world applicability. In this paper, we propose InfiniSST, a\nnovel approach that formulates SST as a multi-turn dialogue task, enabling\nseamless translation of unbounded speech. We construct translation trajectories\nand robust segments from MuST-C with multi-latency augmentation during training\nand develop a key-value (KV) cache management strategy to facilitate efficient\ninference. Experiments on MuST-C En-Es, En-De, and En-Zh demonstrate that\nInfiniSST reduces computation-aware latency by 0.5 to 1 second while\nmaintaining the same translation quality compared to baselines. Ablation\nstudies further validate the contributions of our data construction and cache\nmanagement strategy. We release the code and demo at\nhttps://github.com/LeiLiLab/InfiniSST",

Most prior works assume pre-segmented speech,\nlimiting their real-world applicability. In this paper, we propose InfiniSST, a\nnovel approach that formulates SST as a multi-turn dialogue task, enabling\nseamless translation of unbounded speech. We construct translation trajectories\nand robust segments from MuST-C with multi-latency augmentation during training\nand develop a key-value (KV) cache management strategy to facilitate efficient\ninference. Experiments on MuST-C En-Es, En-De, and En-Zh demonstrate that\nInfiniSST reduces computation-aware latency by 0.5 to 1 second while\nmaintaining the same translation quality compared to baselines. Ablation\nstudies further validate the contributions of our data construction and cache\nmanagement strategy. We release the code and demo at\nhttps://github.com/LeiLiLab/InfiniSST"

In this paper, we first show that the data plane can be made fast with\nno or O(1) caching by loading parameters through the compute network between\nGPUs because: (1) its speed is comparable to host cache and is underutilized,\nand (2) scaling multiple instances requires no or O(1) caching with\nnetwork-optimized multicast.

GTA comprises two components: (1) a shared attention map mechanism\nthat reuses attention scores across multiple heads, decreasing the key cache\nsize; and (2) a nonlinear value decoder with learned projections that\ncompresses the value cache into a latent space, further cutting memory needs.\nGTA cuts attention computation FLOPs by up to \\emph{62.5\\%} versus\nGrouped-Query Attention and shrink the KV cache by up to \\emph{70\\%}, all while\navoiding the extra overhead of Multi-Head Latent Attention to improve LLM\ndeployment efficiency.

Leveraging these insights, we propose \\textbf{G}rouped-Head\nLaten\\textbf{T} \\textbf{A}ttention (GTA), a novel attention mechanism that\nreduces memory usage and computational complexity while maintaining\nperformance. GTA comprises two components: (1) a shared attention map mechanism\nthat reuses attention scores across multiple heads, decreasing the key cache\nsize; and (2) a nonlinear value decoder with learned projections that\ncompresses the value cache into a latent space, further cutting memory needs.\nGTA cuts attention computation FLOPs by up to \\emph{62.5\\%} versus\nGrouped-Query Attention and shrink the KV cache by up to \\emph{70\\%}, all while\navoiding the extra overhead of Multi-Head Latent Attention to improve LLM\ndeployment efficiency. Consequently, GTA models achieve a \\emph{2x} increase in\nend-to-end inference speed, with prefill benefiting from reduced computational\ncost and decoding benefiting from the smaller cache footprint."

We explore an alternative: training a smaller KV cache offline on\neach corpus. At inference time, we load this trained KV cache, which we call a\nCartridge, and decode a response.

The third-order NLHE response strength can\nbe effectively modulated by an additional applied in-plane constant electric\nfield. At the high temperature region, the BCP reduction induced by the\nelectric field leads to a decrease in the third-order NLHE response strength,\nwhile at the low temperature region, the electric field cause both BCP and\nimpurity scattering effects to weaken, resulting in a more significant\nmodulation of the third-order NLHE response strength. At 4 K and an electric\nfield strength of 0.3 kV/cm, the modulated relative response strength could\nreach up to 65.3%.

                "summary": "Low-latency decoding for large language models (LLMs) is crucial for\napplications like chatbots and code assistants, yet generating long outputs\nremains slow in single-query settings. Prior work on speculative decoding\n(which combines a small draft model with a larger target model) and tensor\nparallelism has each accelerated decoding.

In this work, we present Shape-for-Motion, a novel\nframework that incorporates a 3D proxy for precise and consistent video\nediting.

To\nsimplify the editing process, we design a novel Dual-Propagation Strategy that\nallows users to perform edits on the 3D mesh of a single frame, and the edits\nare then automatically propagated to the 3D meshes of the other frames. The 3D\nmeshes for different frames are further projected onto the 2D space to produce\nthe edited geometry and texture renderings, which serve as inputs to a\ndecoupled video diffusion model for generating edited results.

                "summary": "Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) are constrained by the fixed\ncontext window of the underlying transformer architecture, hindering their\nability to produce long and coherent outputs. Memory-augmented LLMs are a\npromising solution, but current approaches cannot handle long output generation\ntasks since they (1) only focus on reading memory and reduce its evolution to\nthe concatenation of new memories or (2) use very specialized memories that\ncannot adapt to other domains. This paper presents L2MAC, the first practical\nLLM-based general-purpose stored-program automatic computer (von Neumann\narchitecture) framework, an LLM-based multi-agent system, for long and\nconsistent output generation. Its memory has two components: the instruction\nregistry, which is populated with a prompt program to solve the user-given\ntask, and a file store, which will contain the final and intermediate outputs.\nEach instruction in turn is executed by a separate LLM agent, whose context is\nmanaged by a control unit capable of precise memory reading and writing to\nensure effective interaction with the file store. These components enable L2MAC\nto generate extensive outputs, bypassing the constraints of the finite context\nwindow while producing outputs that fulfill a complex user-specified task.

                    "value": "Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) are constrained by the fixed\ncontext window of the underlying transformer architecture, hindering their\nability to produce long and coherent outputs. Memory-augmented LLMs are a\npromising solution, but current approaches cannot handle long output generation\ntasks since they (1) only focus on reading memory and reduce its evolution to\nthe concatenation of new memories or (2) use very specialized memories that\ncannot adapt to other domains. This paper presents L2MAC, the first practical\nLLM-based general-purpose stored-program automatic computer (von Neumann\narchitecture) framework, an LLM-based multi-agent system, for long and\nconsistent output generation. Its memory has two components: the instruction\nregistry, which is populated with a prompt program to solve the user-given\ntask, and a file store, which will contain the final and intermediate outputs.\nEach instruction in turn is executed by a separate LLM agent, whose context is\nmanaged by a control unit capable of precise memory reading and writing to\nensure effective interaction with the file store. These components enable L2MAC\nto generate extensive outputs, bypassing the constraints of the finite context\nwindow while producing outputs that fulfill a complex user-specified task. We\nempirically demonstrate that L2MAC achieves state-of-the-art performance in\ngenerating large codebases for system design tasks, significantly outperforming\nother coding methods in implementing the detailed user-specified task; we show\nthat L2MAC works for general-purpose extensive text-based tasks, such as\nwriting an entire book; and we provide valuable insights into L2MAC's\nperformance improvement over existing methods."

Furthermore, we propose a simple\nyet effective mitigation strategy in the form of an adapter module trained to\nminimize inconsistency across prompts. With our proposed strategy, we are able\nto achieve absolute improvements of 5.7% and 12.5%, on average on widely used\nVLMs such as BLIP-2 and LLaVa 1.5M in terms of consistency over their existing\ncounterparts."

We\nintroduce challenging yet interesting set of experiments to test i) how agents\ncan incrementally solve tasks related to every day objects in typical rooms in\na house where each of them are discovered by interacting within the\nenvironment, ii) controlled in-context learning abilities and efficiency of\nagents by providing short info about locations of objects and rooms to check\nhow faster the task can be solved, and finally iii) using synthetic\npseudo-English words to gauge how well LLMs are at inferring meaning of unknown\nwords from environmental feedback. Results show that larger commercial models\nhave a substantial gap in performance compared to open-weight but almost all\nmodels struggle with the synthetic words experiments."

This multistage pipeline encompasses query rewriting,\npassage retrieval and reranking, nugget detection and clustering, cluster\nranking and summarization, and response fluency enhancement. This design\ninherently promotes grounding in specific facts, facilitates source\nattribution, and ensures maximum information inclusion within length\nconstraints. In this challenge, we extend our focus to also address the\nretrieval component of RAG, building upon our prior work on multi-faceted query\nrewriting. Furthermore, for augmented generation, we concentrate on improving\ncontext curation capabilities, maximizing the breadth of information covered in\nthe response while ensuring pipeline efficiency. Our results show that\ncombining original queries with a few sub-query rewrites boosts recall, while\nincreasing the number of documents used for reranking and generation beyond a\ncertain point reduces effectiveness, without improving response quality."

We expand the exploration of this population to\nlower luminosities by stacking $\\sim 600$ NIRSpec grating spectra from the JWST\nAdvanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) at $3<z<7$, in bins of redshift,\n[OIII]5007 luminosity and equivalent width, UV luminosity and stellar mass. In\nvarious stacks, we detect a broad component of H$\\alpha$ without a counterpart\nin [OIII], implying that it is not due to outflows but is tracing the Broad\nLine Region (BLR) of a large population of low-luminosity AGN not detected in\nindividual spectra. We also consider the possible contribution from Supernovae\n(SNe) and Very Massive Stars and conclude that while this is very unlikely, we\ncannot exclude some potential contribution by SNe to some of the stacks. The\ndetection, in some stacks, of high [OIII]4363/H$\\gamma$, typical of AGN,\nfurther confirms that such stacks reveal a large population of AGN. We infer\nthat the stacks probe black holes with masses of a few times $10^6~M_\\odot$\naccreting at rates $L/L_{Edd}\\sim 0.02-0.1$, i.e. a low mass and dormant\nparameter space poorly explored by previous studies on individual targets. We\nidentify populations of black holes that fall within the scatter of the local\n$M_{BH}-M_{*}$ scaling relation, indicating that there is a population of\nhigh-z BHs that are not overmassive relative to their host galaxies and which\nhave been mostly missed in previous JWST observations. Yet, on average, the\nstacks are still overmassive relative the local relation, with some of them 1-2\ndex above it. We infer that the BH mass function (BHMF) at $3<z<5$ rises\nsteeply at low masses. The BHMF is consistent with models in which BHs evolve\nthrough short bursts of super-Eddington accretion.",

The number of bits dedicated to each weight from the original model\nis reduced based on how important they are thought to be during model\ninference. This importance is arrived at through the application of an\n'importance matrix'-a relatively small text document meant to be representative\nof the LLM's standard use-cases. In the vast majority of quants available\nonline, this document is primarily written in English. It was therefore an open\nquestion whether performance on English language tasks was preserved through\nthe sacrifice of multilingual performance and whether it can be preserved with\nalternate importance matrices.

The number of bits dedicated to each weight from the original model\nis reduced based on how important they are thought to be during model\ninference. This importance is arrived at through the application of an\n'importance matrix'-a relatively small text document meant to be representative\nof the LLM's standard use-cases. In the vast majority of quants available\nonline, this document is primarily written in English. It was therefore an open\nquestion whether performance on English language tasks was preserved through\nthe sacrifice of multilingual performance and whether it can be preserved with\nalternate importance matrices.

Finally, we introduce a new\nbenchmark specifically constructed with deliberately flawed first reasoning\nsteps to systematically evaluate model self-correction capabilities, offering a\nfoundation for future research on robust reasoning in LLMs."

These models often struggle to construct stable\nframe-to-frame attention, leading to increased latency and degraded synthesis\nquality, thereby limiting their feasibility for real-time applications. To\naddress these limitations, we introduce a novel dynamic chunk-wise\nautoregressive synthesis framework, termed DCAR, designed to enhance both\nefficiency and intelligibility robustness in AR speech generation. DCAR\nintroduces a chunk-to-frame attention mechanism through training with\nmulti-token prediction, enabling dynamic chunk prediction in variable speech\ncontexts using a lightweight module trained on-policy. DCAR dynamically adjusts\nthe token prediction span, significantly reducing the sequence length\ndependency while obtaining high synthesis quality. Comprehensive empirical\nevaluations demonstrate that DCAR substantially outperforms traditional\nnext-token prediction models, achieving up to 72.27% intelligibility\nimprovement and 2.61x inference speedup simultaneously on the test set.\nFurthermore, we conduct comprehensive analysis to support it as a versatile\nfoundation for next-generation speech synthesis systems.",

The\nobservation model is a sampled and graph-filtered version of the state\ncapturing multi-hop neighboring influence. The goal is to learn the parameters\nin both state and observation models from the partially observed data for\ndownstream tasks such as prediction and imputation. The model is inferred first\nthrough a maximum likelihood approach that provides theoretical tractability\nbut is limited in expressivity and scalability. To improve on the latter, we\nuse the state-space formulation to build a principled deep learning\narchitecture that jointly learns the parameters and tracks the state in an\nend-to-end manner in the spirit of Kalman neural networks."

We propose IDVSCI (Internal\nDiscussion and Vote SCIentists), a multi-agent framework built on LLMs that\nincorporates two key innovations: a Dynamic Knowledge Exchange mechanism\nenabling iterative feedback among agents, and a Dual-Diversity Review paradigm\nthat simulates heterogeneous expert evaluation. These components jointly\npromote deeper reasoning and the generation of more creative and impactful\nscientific ideas. To evaluate the effectiveness and generalizability of our\napproach, we conduct experiments on two datasets: a widely used benchmark in\ncomputer science and a new dataset we introduce in the health sciences domain.\nResults show that IDVSCI consistently achieves the best performance across both\ndatasets, outperforming existing systems such as AI Scientist and VIRSCI.

While recent LLM-based scientist agents show promise in autonomous\nscientific discovery, they often lack the interactive reasoning and evaluation\nmechanisms essential to real-world research. We propose IDVSCI (Internal\nDiscussion and Vote SCIentists), a multi-agent framework built on LLMs that\nincorporates two key innovations: a Dynamic Knowledge Exchange mechanism\nenabling iterative feedback among agents, and a Dual-Diversity Review paradigm\nthat simulates heterogeneous expert evaluation. These components jointly\npromote deeper reasoning and the generation of more creative and impactful\nscientific ideas. To evaluate the effectiveness and generalizability of our\napproach, we conduct experiments on two datasets: a widely used benchmark in\ncomputer science and a new dataset we introduce in the health sciences domain.\nResults show that IDVSCI consistently achieves the best performance across both\ndatasets, outperforming existing systems such as AI Scientist and VIRSCI. These\nfindings highlight the value of modeling interaction and peer review dynamics\nin LLM-based autonomous research."

This paper presents L2MAC, the first practical\nLLM-based general-purpose stored-program automatic computer (von Neumann\narchitecture) framework, an LLM-based multi-agent system, for long and\nconsistent output generation. Its memory has two components: the instruction\nregistry, which is populated with a prompt program to solve the user-given\ntask, and a file store, which will contain the final and intermediate outputs.\nEach instruction in turn is executed by a separate LLM agent, whose context is\nmanaged by a control unit capable of precise memory reading and writing to\nensure effective interaction with the file store. These components enable L2MAC\nto generate extensive outputs, bypassing the constraints of the finite context\nwindow while producing outputs that fulfill a complex user-specified task. We\nempirically demonstrate that L2MAC achieves state-of-the-art performance in\ngenerating large codebases for system design tasks, significantly outperforming\nother coding methods in implementing the detailed user-specified task; we show\nthat L2MAC works for general-purpose extensive text-based tasks, such as\nwriting an entire book; and we provide valuable insights into L2MAC's\nperformance improvement over existing methods.",

Although optical satellite\nimagery is commonly used for disaster mapping, its effectiveness is often\nhampered by cloud cover or the absence of pre-event acquisitions.

Unlike existing approaches that depend on pre\nand post event imagery, our model utilizes only post event data, facilitating\nrapid deployment in critical scenarios. The framework effectiveness is\ndemonstrated using a new dataset from the 2023 earthquake in Turkey, covering\nmultiple cities with diverse urban settings. Results highlight that\nincorporating geospatial features significantly enhances detection performance\nand generalizability to previously unseen areas. By combining SAR imagery with\ndetailed vulnerability and exposure information, our approach provides reliable\nand rapid building damage assessments without the dependency from available\npre-event data. Moreover, the automated and scalable data generation process\nensures the framework's applicability across diverse disaster-affected regions,\nunderscoring its potential to support effective disaster management and\nrecovery efforts.

To address this gap, we introduce \\textbf{R}efinement-oriented\n\\textbf{C}ritique \\textbf{O}ptimization (RCO), a novel framework designed to\ntrain critic models using refinement signals.

By\nfocusing on critiques that lead to better refinements, RCO eliminates the need\nfor direct critique preference assessment, ensuring that critiques driving\nmeaningful improvements are rewarded. We evaluate RCO across five tasks, i.e.,\ndialog generation, summarization, question answering, mathematical reasoning,\nand code generation, and show that it significantly outperforms traditional\nmethods and open-source models in terms of critique quality and refinement\noutcomes.

Additionally, API-accessed models do not offer the\nflexibility needed to tailor behavior to industry-specific objectives, and\nin-context learning is not always sufficient or reliable. In response to these\nchallenges, we introduce Archias, an expert model adept at distinguishing\nbetween in-domain and out-of-domain communications. Archias classifies user\ninquiries into several categories: in-domain (specifically for the automotive\nindustry), malicious questions, price injections, prompt injections, and\nout-of-domain examples. Our methodology integrates outputs from the expert\nmodel (Archias) into prompts, which are then processed by the LLM to generate\nresponses. This method increases the model's ability to understand the user's\nintention and give appropriate answers. Archias can be adjusted, fine-tuned,\nand used for many different purposes due to its small size. Therefore, it can\nbe easily customized to the needs of any industry. To validate our approach, we\ncreated a benchmark dataset for the automotive industry. Furthermore, in the\ninterest of advancing research and development, we release our benchmark\ndataset to the community.",

In response to these\nchallenges, we introduce Archias, an expert model adept at distinguishing\nbetween in-domain and out-of-domain communications. Archias classifies user\ninquiries into several categories: in-domain (specifically for the automotive\nindustry), malicious questions, price injections, prompt injections, and\nout-of-domain examples. Our methodology integrates outputs from the expert\nmodel (Archias) into prompts, which are then processed by the LLM to generate\nresponses. This method increases the model's ability to understand the user's\nintention and give appropriate answers. Archias can be adjusted, fine-tuned,\nand used for many different purposes due to its small size. Therefore, it can\nbe easily customized to the needs of any industry. To validate our approach, we\ncreated a benchmark dataset for the automotive industry. Furthermore, in the\ninterest of advancing research and development, we release our benchmark\ndataset to the community."

Then, a chi-square ranking algorithm is applied for feature\nselection in both classification and clustering tasks. Our findings confirm the\npresence of MTese in both Neural Machine Translation systems (NMTs) and Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs). Original Chinese texts are nearly perfectly\ndistinguishable from both LLM and NMT outputs. Notable linguistic patterns in\nMT outputs are shorter sentence lengths and increased use of adversative\nconjunctions. Comparing LLMs and NMTs, we achieve approximately 70%\nclassification accuracy, with LLMs exhibiting greater lexical diversity and\nNMTs using more brackets. Additionally, translation-specific LLMs show lower\nlexical diversity but higher usage of causal conjunctions compared to generic\nLLMs. Lastly, we find no significant differences between LLMs developed by\nChinese firms and their foreign counterparts.",

Recognizing\nthe transformative potential of these agents, we introduce ScienceBoard, which\nencompasses two complementary contributions: (i) a realistic, multi-domain\nenvironment featuring dynamic and visually rich scientific workflows with\nintegrated professional software, where agents can autonomously interact via\ndifferent interfaces to accelerate complex research tasks and experiments; and\n(ii) a challenging benchmark of 169 high-quality, rigorously validated\nreal-world tasks curated by humans, spanning scientific-discovery workflows in\ndomains such as biochemistry, astronomy, and geoinformatics. Extensive\nevaluations of agents with state-of-the-art backbones (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude\n3.7, UI-TARS) show that, despite some promising results, they still fall short\nof reliably assisting scientists in complex workflows, achieving only a 15%\noverall success rate. In-depth analysis further provides valuable insights for\naddressing current agent limitations and more effective design principles,\npaving the way to build more capable agents for scientific discovery. Our code,\nenvironment, and benchmark are at\nhttps://qiushisun.github.io/ScienceBoard-Home/."

A prominent engineering challenge revolves around programming the\ncollective adaptive behaviour of such computational ecosystems.

We perform an in-depth prospective impact assessment of\ndynamic eco-driving at 6,011 signalized intersections across three major US\nmetropolitan cities, simulating a million traffic scenarios. Overall, we find\nthat vehicle trajectories optimized for emissions can cut city-wide\nintersection carbon emissions by 11-22%, without harming throughput or safety,\nand with reasonable assumptions, equivalent to the national emissions of Israel\nand Nigeria, respectively. We find that 10% eco-driving adoption yields 25%-50%\nof the total reduction, and nearly 70% of the benefits come from 20% of\nintersections, suggesting near-term implementation pathways. However, the\ncomposition of this high-impact subset of intersections varies considerably\nacross different adoption levels, with minimal overlap, calling for careful\nstrategic planning for eco-driving deployments. Moreover, the impact of\neco-driving, when considered jointly with projections of vehicle\nelectrification and hybrid vehicle adoption remains significant.

We perform an in-depth prospective impact assessment of\ndynamic eco-driving at 6,011 signalized intersections across three major US\nmetropolitan cities, simulating a million traffic scenarios. Overall, we find\nthat vehicle trajectories optimized for emissions can cut city-wide\nintersection carbon emissions by 11-22%, without harming throughput or safety,\nand with reasonable assumptions, equivalent to the national emissions of Israel\nand Nigeria, respectively. We find that 10% eco-driving adoption yields 25%-50%\nof the total reduction, and nearly 70% of the benefits come from 20% of\nintersections, suggesting near-term implementation pathways. However, the\ncomposition of this high-impact subset of intersections varies considerably\nacross different adoption levels, with minimal overlap, calling for careful\nstrategic planning for eco-driving deployments. Moreover, the impact of\neco-driving, when considered jointly with projections of vehicle\nelectrification and hybrid vehicle adoption remains significant. More broadly,\nthis work paves the way for large-scale analysis of traffic externalities, such\nas time, safety, and air quality, and the potential impact of solution\nstrategies."

Our framework strikes a balance between computational efficiency and\nmodel performance, making it a promising approach for sentiment analysis with\nLLMs."

This paper presents the implementation\nof a semi-wireless underwater vehicle, \"TritonZ\" equipped with a manipulator\narm, tailored for effective underwater exploration and rescue operations. The\nvehicle's compact design enables deployment in different submarine\nsurroundings, addressing the need for wireless systems capable of navigating\nchallenging underwater terrains. The manipulator arm can interact with the\nenvironment, allowing the robot to perform sophisticated tasks during\nexploration and rescue missions in emergency situations. TritonZ is equipped\nwith various sensors such as Pi-Camera, Humidity, and Temperature sensors to\nsend real-time environmental data. Our underwater vehicle controlled using a\ncustomized remote controller can navigate efficiently in the water where\nPi-Camera enables live streaming of the surroundings. Motion control and video\ncapture are performed simultaneously using this camera. The manipulator arm is\ndesigned to perform various tasks, similar to grasping, manipulating, and\ncollecting underwater objects. Experimental results shows the efficacy of the\nproposed remotely operated vehicle in performing a variety of underwater\nexploration and rescue tasks. Additionally, the results show that TritonZ can\nmaintain an average of 13.5cm/s with a minimal delay of 2-3 seconds.\nFurthermore, the vehicle can sustain waves underwater by maintaining its\nposition as well as average velocity.

In this work, we introduce SPAZER - a VLM-driven agent\nthat combines both modalities in a progressive reasoning framework. It first\nholistically analyzes the scene and produces a 3D rendering from the optimal\nviewpoint. Based on this, anchor-guided candidate screening is conducted to\nperform a coarse-level localization of potential objects. Furthermore,\nleveraging retrieved relevant 2D camera images, 3D-2D joint decision-making is\nefficiently performed to determine the best-matching object. By bridging\nspatial and semantic reasoning neural streams, SPAZER achieves robust zero-shot\ngrounding without training on 3D-labeled data.

Current\nresearch typically evaluates agents via multi-turn dialogues. However, it\noverlooks the influence of these critical factors on agent behavior. To bridge\nthis gap, we present an open-source and high-quality benchmark $C^3$-Bench.\nThis benchmark integrates attack concepts and applies univariate analysis to\npinpoint key elements affecting agent robustness. In concrete, we design three\nchallenges: navigate complex tool relationships, handle critical hidden\ninformation and manage dynamic decision paths. Complementing these challenges,\nwe introduce fine-grained metrics, innovative data collection algorithms and\nreproducible evaluation methods. Extensive experiments are conducted on 49\nmainstream agents, encompassing general fast-thinking, slow-thinking and\ndomain-specific models. We observe that agents have significant shortcomings in\nhandling tool dependencies, long context information dependencies and frequent\npolicy-type switching. In essence, $C^3$-Bench aims to expose model\nvulnerabilities through these challenges and drive research into the\ninterpretability of agent performance.

This paper first formalizes\nmulti-sensor fusion strategies into data-level, feature-level, and\ndecision-level categories and then provides a systematic review of deep\nlearning-based methods corresponding to each strategy. We present key\nmulti-modal datasets and discuss their applicability in addressing real-world\nchallenges, particularly in adverse weather conditions and complex urban\nenvironments. Additionally, we explore emerging trends, including the\nintegration of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), and\nthe role of sensor fusion in end-to-end autonomous driving, highlighting its\npotential to enhance system adaptability and robustness. Our work offers\nvaluable insights into current methods and future directions for multi-sensor\nfusion in autonomous driving.",
