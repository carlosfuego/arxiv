To achieve this, existing\nmethods often require intricate modifications to prompting and sampling\nstrategies. In this work, we introduce representation consistency (RC), a\ntest-time scaling method for aggregating answers drawn from multiple candidate\nresponses of an LLM regardless of how they were generated, including variations\nin prompt phrasing and sampling strategy. RC enhances answer aggregation by not\nonly considering the number of occurrences of each answer in the candidate\nresponse set, but also the consistency of the model's internal activations\nwhile generating the set of responses leading to each answer. These activations\ncan be either dense (raw model activations) or sparse (encoded via pretrained\nsparse autoencoders). Our rationale is that if the model's representations of\nmultiple responses converging on the same answer are highly variable, this\nanswer is more likely to be the result of incoherent reasoning and should be\ndown-weighted during aggregation. Importantly, our method only uses cached\nactivations and lightweight similarity computations and requires no additional\nmodel queries. Through experiments with four open-source LLMs and four\nreasoning datasets, we validate the effectiveness of RC for improving task\nperformance during inference, with consistent accuracy improvements (up to 4%)\nover strong test-time scaling baselines. We also show that consistency in the\nsparse activation signals aligns well with the common notion of coherent\nreasoning.",

We introduce SpecAttn, a novel\ntraining-free approach that seamlessly integrates with existing speculative\ndecoding techniques to enable efficient sparse attention in pre-trained\ntransformers. Our key insight is to exploit the attention weights already\ncomputed by the draft model during speculative decoding to identify important\ntokens for the target model, eliminating redundant computation while\nmaintaining output quality. SpecAttn employs three core techniques: KL\ndivergence-based layer alignment between draft and target models, a\nGPU-optimized sorting-free algorithm for top-p token selection from draft\nattention patterns, and dynamic key-value cache pruning guided by these\npredictions. By leveraging the computational work already performed in standard\nspeculative decoding pipelines, SpecAttn achieves over 75% reduction in\nkey-value cache accesses with a mere 15.29% increase in perplexity on the PG-19\ndataset, significantly outperforming existing sparse attention methods. Our\napproach demonstrates that speculative execution can be enhanced to provide\napproximate verification without significant performance degradation.",

Our key insight is to exploit the attention weights already\ncomputed by the draft model during speculative decoding to identify important\ntokens for the target model, eliminating redundant computation while\nmaintaining output quality. SpecAttn employs three core techniques: KL\ndivergence-based layer alignment between draft and target models, a\nGPU-optimized sorting-free algorithm for top-p token selection from draft\nattention patterns, and dynamic key-value cache pruning guided by these\npredictions. By leveraging the computational work already performed in standard\nspeculative decoding pipelines, SpecAttn achieves over 75% reduction in\nkey-value cache accesses with a mere 15.29% increase in perplexity on the PG-19\ndataset, significantly outperforming existing sparse attention methods. Our\napproach demonstrates that speculative execution can be enhanced to provide\napproximate verification without significant performance degradation."

While existing caching techniques can\naccelerate inference, they often create a challenging trade-off between speed\nand fidelity, suffering from quality degradation and high computational\noverhead. To address these limitations, we introduce H2-Cache, a novel\nhierarchical caching mechanism designed for modern generative diffusion model\narchitectures. Our method is founded on the key insight that the denoising\nprocess can be functionally separated into a structure-defining stage and a\ndetail-refining stage. H2-cache leverages this by employing a dual-threshold\nsystem, using independent thresholds to selectively cache each stage. To ensure\nthe efficiency of our dual-check approach, we introduce pooled feature\nsummarization (PFS), a lightweight technique for robust and fast similarity\nestimation. Extensive experiments on the Flux architecture demonstrate that\nH2-cache achieves significant acceleration (up to 5.08x) while maintaining\nimage quality nearly identical to the baseline, quantitatively and\nqualitatively outperforming existing caching methods. Our work presents a\nrobust and practical solution that effectively resolves the speed-quality\ndilemma, significantly lowering the barrier for the real-world application of\nhigh-fidelity diffusion models.

Our evaluation shows\nthat the prefetcher achieves speedups between 1.08x and 1.88x by reducing\nmemory access latency, while the quicksort accelerator delivers more than 2x\nspeedup with minimal address translation overhead. These findings underscore\nthe ability of Choreographer to model complex hardware-software interactions\nand optimize performance in small task offloading scenarios."

In this paper, we propose OneTrans,\na unified Transformer backbone that simultaneously performs user-behavior\nsequence modeling and feature interaction. OneTrans employs a unified tokenizer\nto convert both sequential and non-sequential attributes into a single token\nsequence. The stacked OneTrans blocks share parameters across similar\nsequential tokens while assigning token-specific parameters to non-sequential\ntokens. Through causal attention and cross-request KV caching, OneTrans enables\nprecomputation and caching of intermediate representations, significantly\nreducing computational costs during both training and inference. Experimental\nresults on industrial-scale datasets demonstrate that OneTrans scales\nefficiently with increasing parameters, consistently outperforms strong\nbaselines, and yields a 5.68% lift in per-user GMV in online A/B tests.",

In this paper, we propose OneTrans,\na unified Transformer backbone that simultaneously performs user-behavior\nsequence modeling and feature interaction. OneTrans employs a unified tokenizer\nto convert both sequential and non-sequential attributes into a single token\nsequence. The stacked OneTrans blocks share parameters across similar\nsequential tokens while assigning token-specific parameters to non-sequential\ntokens. Through causal attention and cross-request KV caching, OneTrans enables\nprecomputation and caching of intermediate representations, significantly\nreducing computational costs during both training and inference. Experimental\nresults on industrial-scale datasets demonstrate that OneTrans scales\nefficiently with increasing parameters, consistently outperforms strong\nbaselines, and yields a 5.68% lift in per-user GMV in online A/B tests."

                "summary": "Recently, instruction-based image editing (IIE) has received widespread\nattention. In practice, IIE often modifies only specific regions of an image,\nwhile the remaining areas largely remain unchanged. Although these two types of\nregions differ significantly in generation difficulty and computational\nredundancy, existing IIE models do not account for this distinction, instead\napplying a uniform generation process across the entire image. This motivates\nus to propose RegionE, an adaptive, region-aware generation framework that\naccelerates IIE tasks without additional training. Specifically, the RegionE\nframework consists of three main components: 1) Adaptive Region Partition. We\nobserved that the trajectory of unedited regions is straight, allowing for\nmulti-step denoised predictions to be inferred in a single step. Therefore, in\nthe early denoising stages, we partition the image into edited and unedited\nregions based on the difference between the final estimated result and the\nreference image. 2) Region-Aware Generation.

                    "value": "Recently, instruction-based image editing (IIE) has received widespread\nattention. In practice, IIE often modifies only specific regions of an image,\nwhile the remaining areas largely remain unchanged. Although these two types of\nregions differ significantly in generation difficulty and computational\nredundancy, existing IIE models do not account for this distinction, instead\napplying a uniform generation process across the entire image. This motivates\nus to propose RegionE, an adaptive, region-aware generation framework that\naccelerates IIE tasks without additional training. Specifically, the RegionE\nframework consists of three main components: 1) Adaptive Region Partition. We\nobserved that the trajectory of unedited regions is straight, allowing for\nmulti-step denoised predictions to be inferred in a single step. Therefore, in\nthe early denoising stages, we partition the image into edited and unedited\nregions based on the difference between the final estimated result and the\nreference image. 2) Region-Aware Generation. After distinguishing the regions,\nwe replace multi-step denoising with one-step prediction for unedited areas.\nFor edited regions, the trajectory is curved, requiring local iterative\ndenoising. To improve the efficiency and quality of local iterative generation,\nwe propose the Region-Instruction KV Cache, which reduces computational cost\nwhile incorporating global information. 3) Adaptive Velocity Decay Cache.\nObserving that adjacent timesteps in edited regions exhibit strong velocity\nsimilarity, we further propose an adaptive velocity decay cache to accelerate\nthe local denoising process.

Previous research has\ndemonstrated that KV cache exhibits low-rank characteristics within the hidden\ndimension, suggesting the potential for effective compression. However, due to\nthe widely adopted Rotary Position Embedding mechanism in modern LLMs, naive\nlow-rank compression suffers severe accuracy degradation or creates a new speed\nbottleneck, as the low-rank cache must first be reconstructed in order to apply\nRoPE. In this paper, we introduce two key insights: first, the application of\nRoPE to the key vectors increases their variance, which in turn results in a\nhigher rank; second, after the key vectors are transformed into the latent\nspace, they largely maintain their representation across most layers. Based on\nthese insights, we propose the Sparse Attention in Latent Space framework. SALS\nprojects the KV cache into a compact latent space via low-rank projection, and\nperforms sparse token selection using RoPE-free query-key interactions in this\nspace. By reconstructing only a small subset of important tokens, it avoids the\noverhead of full KV cache reconstruction. We comprehensively evaluate SALS on\nvarious tasks using two large-scale models: LLaMA2-7b-chat and Mistral-7b, and\nadditionally verify its scalability on the RULER-128k benchmark with\nLLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct. Experimental results demonstrate that SALS achieves SOTA\nperformance by maintaining competitive accuracy. Under different settings, SALS\nachieves 6.4-fold KV cache compression and 5.7-fold speed-up in the attention\noperator compared to FlashAttention2 on the 4K sequence.

To address this issue, this study\nfocuses on determining the joint configuration of concurrent and parallel\nadapters that maximizes GPU throughput without inducing starvation, given\nheterogeneous adapter and traffic properties. We propose a data-driven ML\napproach leveraging interpretable models to tackle this caching problem and\nintroduce the first Digital Twin capable of reproducing an LLM-adapter serving\nsystem, enabling efficient training data generation. Experiments with the vLLM\nframework and LoRA adapters show that the Digital Twin reproduces throughput\nwithin 5.1% of real results, while the ML approach predicts optimal numbers of\nconcurrent and parallel adapters with an error of at most 7.2% under\nheterogeneous, real-world workloads.",

We provide a theoretical analysis showing that GradLite maintains\nunbiased gradient estimates with bounded variance, ensuring convergence rates\ncomparable to Adam. Empirically, GradLite reduces optimizer-state and\nactivation memory consumption by up to 50\\% without architectural changes, and\nachieves on-par or superior downstream performance on reasoning (MMLU, GSM8K),\nmultilingual, and dialogue benchmarks compared to checkpointing and\noptimizer-centric baselines (LoMo, GaLore)."

By splitting each file into $F$ equal\npackets (i.e., the subpacketization level $F$) and letting each user cache a\nset of packets, the transmission load can be significantly reduced via coded\nmulticasting. It has been shown that a higher subpacketization level could\npotentially lead to a lower transmission load, as more packets can be combined\nfor efficient transmission. On the other hand, a larger $F$ indicates a higher\ncoding complexity and is problematic from a practical perspective when $F$ is\nextremely large.

In this\npaper, we consider the classical cache-aided networks with identically uncoded\nplacement and one-shot delivery strategy, and investigate the fundamental\ntrade-off between the transmission load and the subpacketization level. We\npropose a \\emph{general} lower bound on the transmission load for any fixed\nsubpacketization by reformulating the centralized coded caching schemes via the\ncombinatorial structure of the corresponding placement delivery array. The\nlower bound also recovers existing optimality results for the bipartite graph\nscheme (including the well-known Maddah-Ali and Niesen (MN) scheme and the\nconjugate MN scheme) as well as the grouping bipartite graph scheme.\nFurthermore, by carefully exploiting the combinatorial structure and computing\nthe union size of sorted sets, we establish a new optimality result, i.e., the\npartition scheme can achieve the optimal rate-subpacketization trade-off.",

The advent of large\nlanguage models and sequential modeling techniques, particularly\ntransformer-like architectures, has led to significant advancements recently\n(e.g., HSTU, SIM, and TWIN models). While scaling to ultra-long user histories\n(10k to 100k items) generally improves model performance, it also creates\nsignificant challenges on latency, queries per second (QPS) and GPU cost in\nindustry-scale recommendation systems. Existing models do not adequately\naddress these industrial scalability issues. In this paper, we propose a novel\ntwo-stage modeling framework, namely VIrtual Sequential Target Attention\n(VISTA), which decomposes traditional target attention from a candidate item to\nuser history items into two distinct stages: (1) user history summarization\ninto a few hundred tokens; followed by (2) candidate item attention to those\ntokens. These summarization token embeddings are then cached in storage system\nand then utilized as sequence features for downstream model training and\ninference. This novel design for scalability enables VISTA to scale to lifelong\nuser histories (up to one million items) while keeping downstream training and\ninference costs fixed, which is essential in industry.

We\npresent results powered by T1-Agent, highlighting their ability to plan and\nreason in complex, tool-dependent scenarios."

Skip connections offer a promising way to improve representation\nwithout bloating resource usage, yet most prior works either improve\nexpressivity while leaving KV costs unchanged, or reduce memory at the cost of\nweaker representation. In this work, we propose SkipV1Former, a Transformer\nvariant that uses skip connections from the first layer's Value heads to\nstrengthen model representation and reduce KV cache.

Empirically, across different model\nscales, SkipV1Former delivers consistent reductions of approximately 25 \\% in\nKV cache while improving perplexity relative to standard Multi-Head Attention\n(MHA) Transformers and some advanced variants.

These two memory systems have complementary but\nindividually limited properties: KV-memory offers precise retrieval but is\nconstrained by quadratic complexity in sequence length, while FW-memory\nsupports arbitrarily long sequences and enables more expressive computation but\nsacrifices precise recall. We propose and compare three methods to blend these\ntwo systems into a single memory system, differing in how and when input\ninformation is delivered to each system, to leverage the strengths of both. We\nconduct experiments on general language modeling and retrieval tasks by\ntraining 340M- and 1.3B-parameter models from scratch, as well as on synthetic\nalgorithmic tasks designed to precisely illustrate the benefits of certain\nhybrid methods over others. We also evaluate our hybrid memory systems on\nreinforcement learning in partially observable environments. Overall, we\ndemonstrate how a well-designed hybrid can overcome the limitations of its\nindividual components, offering new insights into the design principle of\nneural memory systems.",

                    "value": "We develop hybrid memory architectures for general-purpose sequence\nprocessing neural networks, that combine key-value memory using softmax\nattention (KV-memory) with fast weight memory through dynamic synaptic\nmodulation (FW-memory) -- the core principles of quadratic and linear\ntransformers, respectively. These two memory systems have complementary but\nindividually limited properties: KV-memory offers precise retrieval but is\nconstrained by quadratic complexity in sequence length, while FW-memory\nsupports arbitrarily long sequences and enables more expressive computation but\nsacrifices precise recall. We propose and compare three methods to blend these\ntwo systems into a single memory system, differing in how and when input\ninformation is delivered to each system, to leverage the strengths of both. We\nconduct experiments on general language modeling and retrieval tasks by\ntraining 340M- and 1.3B-parameter models from scratch, as well as on synthetic\nalgorithmic tasks designed to precisely illustrate the benefits of certain\nhybrid methods over others. We also evaluate our hybrid memory systems on\nreinforcement learning in partially observable environments. Overall, we\ndemonstrate how a well-designed hybrid can overcome the limitations of its\nindividual components, offering new insights into the design principle of\nneural memory systems."

                "summary": "Object-goal navigation (ObjNav) tasks an agent with navigating to the\nlocation of a specific object in an unseen environment. Embodied agents\nequipped with large language models (LLMs) and online constructed navigation\nmaps can perform ObjNav in a zero-shot manner. However, existing agents heavily\nrely on giant LLMs on the cloud, e.g., GPT-4, while directly switching to small\nLLMs, e.g., LLaMA3.2-11b, suffer from significant success rate drops due to\nlimited model capacity for understanding complex navigation maps, which\nprevents deploying ObjNav on local devices. At the same time, the long prompt\nintroduced by the navigation map description will cause high planning latency\non local devices. In this paper, we propose EfficientNav to enable on-device\nefficient LLM-based zero-shot ObjNav. To help the smaller LLMs better\nunderstand the environment, we propose semantics-aware memory retrieval to\nprune redundant information in navigation maps. To reduce planning latency, we\npropose discrete memory caching and attention-based memory clustering to\nefficiently save and re-use the KV cache.

                    "value": "Object-goal navigation (ObjNav) tasks an agent with navigating to the\nlocation of a specific object in an unseen environment. Embodied agents\nequipped with large language models (LLMs) and online constructed navigation\nmaps can perform ObjNav in a zero-shot manner. However, existing agents heavily\nrely on giant LLMs on the cloud, e.g., GPT-4, while directly switching to small\nLLMs, e.g., LLaMA3.2-11b, suffer from significant success rate drops due to\nlimited model capacity for understanding complex navigation maps, which\nprevents deploying ObjNav on local devices. At the same time, the long prompt\nintroduced by the navigation map description will cause high planning latency\non local devices. In this paper, we propose EfficientNav to enable on-device\nefficient LLM-based zero-shot ObjNav. To help the smaller LLMs better\nunderstand the environment, we propose semantics-aware memory retrieval to\nprune redundant information in navigation maps. To reduce planning latency, we\npropose discrete memory caching and attention-based memory clustering to\nefficiently save and re-use the KV cache. Extensive experimental results\ndemonstrate that EfficientNav achieves 11.1% improvement in success rate on\nHM3D benchmark over GPT-4-based baselines, and demonstrates 6.7x real-time\nlatency reduction and 4.7x end-to-end latency reduction over GPT-4 planner.

Cache-based surrogates\nuse already calculated simulation results to interpolate or extrapolate further\nsimulation output values. But this approach only pays off if the access time to\nretrieve the needed values is much faster than the actual simulation.

While these agents have the potential to tackle complicated\ntasks, their problem-solving process, i.e., agents' interaction trajectory\nleading to task completion, remains underexploited. These trajectories contain\nrich feedback that can navigate agents toward the right directions for solving\nproblems correctly. Although prevailing approaches, such as Monte Carlo Tree\nSearch (MCTS), can effectively balance exploration and exploitation, they\nignore the interdependence among various trajectories and lack the diversity of\nsearch spaces, which leads to redundant reasoning and suboptimal outcomes. To\naddress these challenges, we propose SE-Agent, a Self-Evolution framework that\nenables Agents to optimize their reasoning processes iteratively. Our approach\nrevisits and enhances former pilot trajectories through three key operations:\nrevision, recombination, and refinement. This evolutionary mechanism enables\ntwo critical advantages: (1) it expands the search space beyond local optima by\nintelligently exploring diverse solution paths guided by previous trajectories,\nand (2) it leverages cross-trajectory inspiration to efficiently enhance\nperformance while mitigating the impact of suboptimal reasoning paths. Through\nthese mechanisms, SE-Agent achieves continuous self-evolution that\nincrementally improves reasoning quality. We evaluate SE-Agent on SWE-bench\nVerified to resolve real-world GitHub issues. Experimental results across five\nstrong LLMs show that integrating SE-Agent delivers up to 55% relative\nimprovement, achieving state-of-the-art performance among all open-source\nagents on SWE-bench Verified.

The picture at\nhigher zeniths, i.e., lower densities, is more nuanced. In this region, the\ndeflections due to the Lorentz force are much larger and introduce extra time\ndelays between the particle tracks, decreasing the coherence of the emission.\nThis loss of coherence is highly dependent on the strength of the geomagnetic\nfield and can slow down, or even reverse the increase of the radio emission\nwith decreasing air density.

Most of these studies consist of quantifying trends\nbetween an Ariel-measured quantity, y, and an a priori planetary property, x;\nfor example, atmospheric metallicity as inferred from Ariel transit\nspectroscopy vs. planetary mass. The precision with which we can quantify such\ntrends depends on the number of targets in the survey and their variance in the\na priori parameter. We define the leverage of a survey with N targets as L =\nsqrt(N)stdev(x) and show that it quantitatively predicts the precision of\npopulation-level trends. The target selection challenge of Ariel can therefore\nbe summarized as maximizing L along some axes of diversity for a given\ncumulative observing time. To this end, we consider different schemes to select\nthe mission reference sample for a notional three year transit spectroscopy\nsurvey with Ariel. We divide the exoplanets in the mission candidate sample\ninto logarithmic classes based on radius, equilibrium temperature and host star\ntemperature. We then construct a target list by cyclically choosing the easiest\nremaining target in each class. We find that the leverage on a single axis of\ndiversity can be increased by dividing that axis into many classes, but this\nsacrifices leverage along other axes of diversity. We conclude that a modest\nnumber of classes, possibly only one, should be defined when selecting Ariel\ntargets. Lastly, we note that the statistical leverage of the Ariel transit\nsurvey would be significantly increased if current candidate planets were\nconfirmed. This highlights the urgency of vetting and confirming the easiest\ntransmission and emission spectroscopy targets in the Ariel mission candidate\nsample.",

We then construct a target list by cyclically choosing the easiest\nremaining target in each class. We find that the leverage on a single axis of\ndiversity can be increased by dividing that axis into many classes, but this\nsacrifices leverage along other axes of diversity. We conclude that a modest\nnumber of classes, possibly only one, should be defined when selecting Ariel\ntargets. Lastly, we note that the statistical leverage of the Ariel transit\nsurvey would be significantly increased if current candidate planets were\nconfirmed. This highlights the urgency of vetting and confirming the easiest\ntransmission and emission spectroscopy targets in the Ariel mission candidate\nsample."

Rigorous multi-dimensional filtering\nensures the generation of high-quality, clinically aligned dialogue data.

However, as shown by many studies,\nwriting or generating correct code to invoke APIs, particularly web APIs, is\nchallenging. Although large language models (LLMs) have become popular in\nsoftware development, their effectiveness in automating the generation of web\nAPI integration code remains unexplored.

The EoS\nremains within the phantom regime at higher redshifts, while favoring the\nquintessence regime in the current epoch. In this context, we propose a new\nGaussian-like form of EoS, termed BellDE, which avoids phantom behavior (\\(w\n\\geq -1\\)) at higher redshifts while remaining precisely calibrated at lower\nredshifts. Interestingly, BellDE exhibits a transient phantom nature (\\(w <\n-1\\)) around the transition redshift \\(z \\sim 0.5\\), subsequently evolving into\na quintessential regime (\\(w > -1\\)). In particular, the BellDE model provides\ncompetitive statistical preference while offering greater flexibility in the\nredshift regime $z \\sim 0.5-1$, where DE is observationally significant.",

A Bayesian inference procedure is adopted to\nestimate the models parameters that yield the best fit to the data. The EoS\nremains within the phantom regime at higher redshifts, while favoring the\nquintessence regime in the current epoch. In this context, we propose a new\nGaussian-like form of EoS, termed BellDE, which avoids phantom behavior (\\(w\n\\geq -1\\)) at higher redshifts while remaining precisely calibrated at lower\nredshifts. Interestingly, BellDE exhibits a transient phantom nature (\\(w <\n-1\\)) around the transition redshift \\(z \\sim 0.5\\), subsequently evolving into\na quintessential regime (\\(w > -1\\)). In particular, the BellDE model provides\ncompetitive statistical preference while offering greater flexibility in the\nredshift regime $z \\sim 0.5-1$, where DE is observationally significant."

These comparisons explain key empirical phenomena: (i)\nhigher-capacity models are more data- and compute-efficient; (ii) learning-rate\ndecay improves training efficiency; and (iii) WSD-type schedules outperform\npure decay.

Deep\nlearning compilers efficiently compile models into executables for deployment\non edge devices, but these executables may face the threat of reverse\nengineering. Previous studies have attempted to decompile DNN executables, but\nthey face challenges in handling compilation optimizations and analyzing\nquantized compiled models. In this paper, we present NeuroDeX to unlock diverse\nsupport in decompiling DNN executables. NeuroDeX leverages the semantic\nunderstanding capabilities of LLMs along with dynamic analysis to accurately\nand efficiently perform operator type recognition, operator attribute recovery\nand model reconstruction. NeuroDeX can recover DNN executables into high-level\nmodels towards compilation optimizations, different architectures and quantized\ncompiled models. We conduct experiments on 96 DNN executables across 12 common\nDNN models. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that NeuroDeX can\ndecompile non-quantized executables into nearly identical high-level models.\nNeuroDeX can recover functionally similar high-level models for quantized\nexecutables, achieving an average top-1 accuracy of 72%. NeuroDeX offers a more\ncomprehensive and effective solution compared to previous DNN executables\ndecompilers.",

In this paper, we focus on\nGRB 110213A that shows double-peaked optical afterglow lightcurves and the\nshallow decay feature of the X-ray afterglow. We adopt a semi-analytic model\nfor the dynamics of forward and reverse shocks generated through an interaction\nbetween an arbitrary magnetized ejecta with a finite thickness and a stratified\ncircumstellar medium. Multiwavelength radiation from forward and reverse shocks\nseen from an arbitrary viewing angle is calculated under a thin-shell\napproximation. Our analysis with multimodal nested sampling methods for GRB\n110213A suggests that the thick shell ejecta naturally explains the shallow\ndecay feature of the X-ray afterglow. The combination of the reverse shock\nemission in the strongly magnetized jet and forward shock emission in the\nweakly magnetized circumstellar medium makes the double peak feature of the\noptical afterglows. The estimated low radiative efficiency in the prompt phase\nmay be a consequence of the high magnetization of the jet in this case. A\nmulti-messenger emission simulator based on the magnetic bullet afterglow model\nis publicly available as the open source Julia package \"Magglow\".",

                    "value": "Gamma-ray bursts early afterglows are important tracers for determining the\nradial structure and magnetization of the ejecta. In this paper, we focus on\nGRB 110213A that shows double-peaked optical afterglow lightcurves and the\nshallow decay feature of the X-ray afterglow. We adopt a semi-analytic model\nfor the dynamics of forward and reverse shocks generated through an interaction\nbetween an arbitrary magnetized ejecta with a finite thickness and a stratified\ncircumstellar medium. Multiwavelength radiation from forward and reverse shocks\nseen from an arbitrary viewing angle is calculated under a thin-shell\napproximation. Our analysis with multimodal nested sampling methods for GRB\n110213A suggests that the thick shell ejecta naturally explains the shallow\ndecay feature of the X-ray afterglow. The combination of the reverse shock\nemission in the strongly magnetized jet and forward shock emission in the\nweakly magnetized circumstellar medium makes the double peak feature of the\noptical afterglows. The estimated low radiative efficiency in the prompt phase\nmay be a consequence of the high magnetization of the jet in this case. A\nmulti-messenger emission simulator based on the magnetic bullet afterglow model\nis publicly available as the open source Julia package \"Magglow\"."

With proven capabilities in understanding user\npreferences, LLM personalization has emerged as a critical area for providing\ntailored responses to individuals. Current studies explore personalization\nthrough prompt design and fine-tuning, paving the way for further research in\npersonalized LLMs. However, existing approaches are either costly and\ninefficient in capturing diverse user preferences or fail to account for timely\nupdates to user history. To address these gaps, we propose the Memory-Assisted\nPersonalized LLM (MAP). Through user interactions, we first create a history\nprofile for each user, capturing their preferences, such as ratings for\nhistorical items. During recommendation, we extract relevant memory based on\nsimilarity, which is then incorporated into the prompts to enhance personalized\nrecommendations. In our experiments, we define a new task that enables testing\nwith varying memory size under two scenarios: single domain where memory and\ntasks are from the same category and cross-domain (e.g. memory from movies and\nrecommendation tasks in books). The results show that MAP outperforms regular\nLLM-based recommenders that integrate user history directly through prompt\ndesign. Moreover, as user history grows, MAP's advantage increases in both\nscenarios, making it more suitable for addressing successive personalized user\nrequests.",

Moreover, the direct application of MARL methods to\nLaMAS introduces significant challenges, stemming from the unique\ncharacteristics and mechanisms inherent to LaMAS. To address these challenges,\nthis article presents a comprehensive study of LLM-based MARL and proposes a\nnovel paradigm termed Multi-Agent Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (MARFT). We\nintroduce a brand-new MG called Flex-MG, which aligns with the LaMAS\noptimization in real-world applications and a universal algorithmic framework\ntailored specifically for LaMAS, outlining the conceptual foundations, key\ndistinctions, and practical implementation strategies. We review the evolution\nfrom RL to RFT, setting the stage for a parallel analysis in the multi-agent\ndomain. In the context of LaMAS, we elucidate critical differences between MARL\nand MARFT. These differences motivate a transition toward a LaMAS-oriented\nformulation of RFT. Central to this work is a robust and scalable MARFT\nframework.

Model editing has emerged as a potential remedy without full\nretraining. While parameter-based editing often compromises locality and is\nthus ill-suited for the medical domain, retrieval-based editing offers a more\nviable alternative. However, it still faces two critical challenges: (1)\nrepresentation overlap within the medical knowledge space often causes\ninaccurate retrieval and reduces editing accuracy; (2) existing methods are\nrestricted to single-sample edits, while batch-editing remains largely\nunexplored despite its importance for real-world medical applications. To\naddress these challenges, we first construct MedVersa, an enhanced benchmark\nwith broader coverage of medical subjects, designed to evaluate both single and\nbatch edits under strict locality constraints. We then propose MedREK, a\nretrieval-based editing framework that integrates a shared query-key module for\nprecise matching with an attention-based prompt encoder for informative\nguidance. Experimental results on various medical benchmarks demonstrate that\nour MedREK achieves superior performance across different core metrics and\nprovides the first validated solution for batch-editing in medical LLMs. Our\ncode and dataset are available at https://github.com/mylittleriver/MedREK.",

However, existing studies focus on\nconsidering the sequential order of items and neglect to handle the temporal\ndynamics across items, which can imply evolving user preferences. To address\nthis limitation, we propose a novel model, Generative Recommender Using Time\nawareness (GRUT), effectively capturing hidden user preferences via various\ntemporal signals. We first introduce Time-aware Prompting, consisting of two\nkey contexts. The user-level temporal context models personalized temporal\npatterns across timestamps and time intervals, while the item-level transition\ncontext provides transition patterns across users. We also devise Trend-aware\nInference, a training-free method that enhances rankings by incorporating trend\ninformation about items with generation likelihood. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that GRUT outperforms state-of-the-art models, with gains of up to\n15.4% and 14.3% in Recall@5 and NDCG@5 across four benchmark datasets. The\nsource code is available at https://github.com/skleee/GRUT.",

                    "value": "Generative recommendation has emerged as a promising paradigm that formulates\nthe recommendations into a text-to-text generation task, harnessing the vast\nknowledge of large language models. However, existing studies focus on\nconsidering the sequential order of items and neglect to handle the temporal\ndynamics across items, which can imply evolving user preferences. To address\nthis limitation, we propose a novel model, Generative Recommender Using Time\nawareness (GRUT), effectively capturing hidden user preferences via various\ntemporal signals. We first introduce Time-aware Prompting, consisting of two\nkey contexts. The user-level temporal context models personalized temporal\npatterns across timestamps and time intervals, while the item-level transition\ncontext provides transition patterns across users. We also devise Trend-aware\nInference, a training-free method that enhances rankings by incorporating trend\ninformation about items with generation likelihood. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that GRUT outperforms state-of-the-art models, with gains of up to\n15.4% and 14.3% in Recall@5 and NDCG@5 across four benchmark datasets. The\nsource code is available at https://github.com/skleee/GRUT."

                "summary": "Understanding the causal effects of air pollution exposures on social\nmobility is attracting increasing attention. At the same time, education is\nwidely recognized as a key driver of social mobility. However, the causal\npathways linking fine particulate matter (PM2.5) exposure, educational\nattainment, and social mobility remain largely unexplored. To address this, we\nadopt the principal stratification approach, which rigorously defines causal\neffects when a post-treatment variable--educational attainment--is affected by\nexposure--PM2.5--and may, in turn, affect the primary outcome--social mobility.\nTo estimate the causal effects, we propose a Bayesian semi-parametric method\nleveraging infinite mixtures for modeling the primary outcome. The proposed\nmethod (i) allows flexible modeling of the distribution of the primary\npotential outcomes, (ii) improves the accuracy of counterfactual imputation--a\nfundamental problem in causal inference framework--, and (iii) enables the\ncharacterization of treatment effects across different values of the\npost-treatment variable. We evaluate the performance of the proposed\nmethodology through a Monte Carlo simulation study, demonstrating its\nadvantages over existing approaches. Finally, we apply our method to a national\ndataset of 3,009 counties in the United States to estimate the causal effect of\nPM2.5 on social mobility, taking into account educational attainment as a\npost-treatment variable. Our findings indicate that in counties where higher\nPM2.5 exposure significantly reduces educational attainment social mobility\ndecreases by approximately 5% compared to counties with lower PM2.5 exposure.\nWe also find that in counties where exposure to PM2.5 does not affect\neducational attainment, social mobility is reduced by approximately 2% hinting\nat the possibility of further, yet unexplored, pathways connecting air\npollution and social mobility.",

                    "value": "Understanding the causal effects of air pollution exposures on social\nmobility is attracting increasing attention. At the same time, education is\nwidely recognized as a key driver of social mobility. However, the causal\npathways linking fine particulate matter (PM2.5) exposure, educational\nattainment, and social mobility remain largely unexplored. To address this, we\nadopt the principal stratification approach, which rigorously defines causal\neffects when a post-treatment variable--educational attainment--is affected by\nexposure--PM2.5--and may, in turn, affect the primary outcome--social mobility.\nTo estimate the causal effects, we propose a Bayesian semi-parametric method\nleveraging infinite mixtures for modeling the primary outcome. The proposed\nmethod (i) allows flexible modeling of the distribution of the primary\npotential outcomes, (ii) improves the accuracy of counterfactual imputation--a\nfundamental problem in causal inference framework--, and (iii) enables the\ncharacterization of treatment effects across different values of the\npost-treatment variable. We evaluate the performance of the proposed\nmethodology through a Monte Carlo simulation study, demonstrating its\nadvantages over existing approaches. Finally, we apply our method to a national\ndataset of 3,009 counties in the United States to estimate the causal effect of\nPM2.5 on social mobility, taking into account educational attainment as a\npost-treatment variable. Our findings indicate that in counties where higher\nPM2.5 exposure significantly reduces educational attainment social mobility\ndecreases by approximately 5% compared to counties with lower PM2.5 exposure.\nWe also find that in counties where exposure to PM2.5 does not affect\neducational attainment, social mobility is reduced by approximately 2% hinting\nat the possibility of further, yet unexplored, pathways connecting air\npollution and social mobility."

When learners\ninteract with LLMs, these risks extend to cognitive and behavioural outcomes,\nincluding reduced neural activity, over-reliance, diminished independent\nlearning skills, and a loss of student agency. To capture this progression, we\npropose an LLM-Risk Adapted Learning Model that illustrates how technical risks\ncascade through interaction and interpretation to shape educational outcomes.\nAs the first synthesis of empirically assessed risks, this review provides a\nfoundation for responsible, human-centred integration of LLMs in education.",

When learners\ninteract with LLMs, these risks extend to cognitive and behavioural outcomes,\nincluding reduced neural activity, over-reliance, diminished independent\nlearning skills, and a loss of student agency. To capture this progression, we\npropose an LLM-Risk Adapted Learning Model that illustrates how technical risks\ncascade through interaction and interpretation to shape educational outcomes.\nAs the first synthesis of empirically assessed risks, this review provides a\nfoundation for responsible, human-centred integration of LLMs in education."

Although prior work has explored leveraging large models\nthrough agents or workflows, relatively little attention has been given to\nimproving the performance of smaller, fine-tuned models--a critical factor for\nachieving both efficiency and data privacy. In this paper, we introduce\nHKT-SmartAudit, a framework for developing lightweight models optimized for\nsmart contract auditing. It features a multi-stage knowledge distillation\npipeline that integrates classical distillation, external domain knowledge, and\nreward-guided learning to transfer high-quality insights from large teacher\nmodels. A single-task learning strategy is employed to train compact student\nmodels that maintain high accuracy and robustness while significantly reducing\ncomputational overhead. Experimental results show that our distilled models\noutperform both commercial tools and larger models in detecting complex\nvulnerabilities and logical flaws, offering a practical, secure, and scalable\nsolution for smart contract auditing.

However, achieving optimal planning\nremains challenging due to the diversity of deployment scenarios and the\nsignificant simulation-to-reality discrepancy. In this paper, we propose\n\\emph{AutoPlan}, a new automatic network planning framework by leveraging\ndigital radio twin (DRT) techniques.

We further instantiate the theory for three\nrepresentative LRSs -- constant, exponential decay, and warmup-stable-decay\n(WSD) -- and derive explicit scaling relations in both data- and\ncompute-limited regimes. These comparisons explain key empirical phenomena: (i)\nhigher-capacity models are more data- and compute-efficient; (ii) learning-rate\ndecay improves training efficiency; and (iii) WSD-type schedules outperform\npure decay. Finally, experiments on LLMs ranging from 0.1B to 1B parameters\ndemonstrate the practical relevance of FSL as a surrogate model for fitting and\npredicting loss trajectories in large-scale pre-training.",

These comparisons explain key empirical phenomena: (i)\nhigher-capacity models are more data- and compute-efficient; (ii) learning-rate\ndecay improves training efficiency; and (iii) WSD-type schedules outperform\npure decay. Finally, experiments on LLMs ranging from 0.1B to 1B parameters\ndemonstrate the practical relevance of FSL as a surrogate model for fitting and\npredicting loss trajectories in large-scale pre-training."

In this work, we introduce representation consistency (RC), a\ntest-time scaling method for aggregating answers drawn from multiple candidate\nresponses of an LLM regardless of how they were generated, including variations\nin prompt phrasing and sampling strategy. RC enhances answer aggregation by not\nonly considering the number of occurrences of each answer in the candidate\nresponse set, but also the consistency of the model's internal activations\nwhile generating the set of responses leading to each answer.

Our rationale is that if the model's representations of\nmultiple responses converging on the same answer are highly variable, this\nanswer is more likely to be the result of incoherent reasoning and should be\ndown-weighted during aggregation. Importantly, our method only uses cached\nactivations and lightweight similarity computations and requires no additional\nmodel queries.

However, despite the rapid proliferation\nof geospatial FMs, their real-world utility and alignment with global\nsustainability goals remain underexplored. We introduce SustainFM, a\ncomprehensive benchmarking framework grounded in the 17 Sustainable Development\nGoals with extremely diverse tasks ranging from asset wealth prediction to\nenvironmental hazard detection. This study provides a rigorous,\ninterdisciplinary assessment of geospatial FMs and offers critical insights\ninto their role in attaining sustainability goals.

However, despite the rapid proliferation\nof geospatial FMs, their real-world utility and alignment with global\nsustainability goals remain underexplored. We introduce SustainFM, a\ncomprehensive benchmarking framework grounded in the 17 Sustainable Development\nGoals with extremely diverse tasks ranging from asset wealth prediction to\nenvironmental hazard detection. This study provides a rigorous,\ninterdisciplinary assessment of geospatial FMs and offers critical insights\ninto their role in attaining sustainability goals.

                "summary": "LLM-based Multi-Agent Systems have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in\naddressing complex, agentic tasks, from generating high-quality presentation\nslides to even conducting sophisticated scientific research. Meanwhile, RL has\nbeen widely recognized for its effectiveness in enhancing agent intelligence,\nbut limited research has investigated the fine-tuning of LaMAS using\nfoundational RL techniques. Moreover, the direct application of MARL methods to\nLaMAS introduces significant challenges, stemming from the unique\ncharacteristics and mechanisms inherent to LaMAS. To address these challenges,\nthis article presents a comprehensive study of LLM-based MARL and proposes a\nnovel paradigm termed Multi-Agent Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (MARFT). We\nintroduce a brand-new MG called Flex-MG, which aligns with the LaMAS\noptimization in real-world applications and a universal algorithmic framework\ntailored specifically for LaMAS, outlining the conceptual foundations, key\ndistinctions, and practical implementation strategies. We review the evolution\nfrom RL to RFT, setting the stage for a parallel analysis in the multi-agent\ndomain. In the context of LaMAS, we elucidate critical differences between MARL\nand MARFT. These differences motivate a transition toward a LaMAS-oriented\nformulation of RFT. Central to this work is a robust and scalable MARFT\nframework. We detail the core algorithm and provide a complete, open-source\nimplementation to facilitate adoption and further research. The latter sections\nof the paper explore real-world application perspectives and opening challenges\nin MARFT. By bridging theoretical underpinnings with practical methodologies,\nthis work serves as a roadmap for researchers seeking to advance MARFT toward\nresilient and adaptive solutions in agentic systems. Our implementation of the\nproposed framework is publicly available at:\nhttps://github.com/jwliao-ai/MARFT.",

Hence, directly\ndistilling chain-of-thought (CoT) rationales from large LRMs to smaller ones\ncan sometimes be ineffective and often requires a substantial amount of\nannotated data. In this paper, we first introduce a novel\nCritique-Rethink-Verify (CRV) system, designed for training smaller yet\npowerful LRMs. Our CRV system consists of multiple LLM agents, each\nspecializing in unique tasks: (i) critiquing the CoT rationales according to\nthe cognitive capabilities of smaller models, (ii) rethinking and refining\nthese CoTs based on the critiques, and (iii) verifying the correctness of the\nrefined results. Building on the CRV system, we further propose the Cognitive\nPreference Optimization (CogPO) algorithm to continuously enhance the reasoning\nabilities of smaller models by aligning their reasoning processes with their\ncognitive capacities. Comprehensive evaluations on challenging reasoning\nbenchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of our CRV+CogPO framework, which\noutperforms other methods by a large margin.",

This ambiguous terminology could\nundermine efforts to design or evaluate systems that must operate under\nmeaningful human supervision.

                "summary": "Stereo depth estimation is a critical task in autonomous driving and\nrobotics, where inaccuracies (such as misidentifying nearby objects as distant)\ncan lead to dangerous situations. Adversarial attacks against stereo depth\nestimation can help reveal vulnerabilities before deployment. Previous works\nhave shown that repeating optimized textures can effectively mislead stereo\ndepth estimation in digital settings. However, our research reveals that these\nnaively repeated textures perform poorly in physical implementations, i.e.,\nwhen deployed as patches, limiting their practical utility for stress-testing\nstereo depth estimation systems. In this work, for the first time, we discover\nthat introducing regular intervals among the repeated textures, creating a grid\nstructure, significantly enhances the patch's attack performance. Through\nextensive experimentation, we analyze how variations of this novel structure\ninfluence the adversarial effectiveness. Based on these insights, we develop a\nnovel stereo depth attack that jointly optimizes both the interval structure\nand texture elements. Our generated adversarial patches can be inserted into\nany scenes and successfully attack advanced stereo depth estimation methods of\ndifferent paradigms, i.e., RAFT-Stereo and STTR.

However, their inherent vulnerabilities have led to\nsignificant financial losses. Traditional auditing methods, while essential,\nstruggle to keep pace with the increasing complexity and scale of smart\ncontracts. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising capabilities for\nautomating vulnerability detection, but their adoption is often limited by high\ncomputational costs. Although prior work has explored leveraging large models\nthrough agents or workflows, relatively little attention has been given to\nimproving the performance of smaller, fine-tuned models--a critical factor for\nachieving both efficiency and data privacy. In this paper, we introduce\nHKT-SmartAudit, a framework for developing lightweight models optimized for\nsmart contract auditing. It features a multi-stage knowledge distillation\npipeline that integrates classical distillation, external domain knowledge, and\nreward-guided learning to transfer high-quality insights from large teacher\nmodels. A single-task learning strategy is employed to train compact student\nmodels that maintain high accuracy and robustness while significantly reducing\ncomputational overhead. Experimental results show that our distilled models\noutperform both commercial tools and larger models in detecting complex\nvulnerabilities and logical flaws, offering a practical, secure, and scalable\nsolution for smart contract auditing.

Traditional auditing methods, while essential,\nstruggle to keep pace with the increasing complexity and scale of smart\ncontracts. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising capabilities for\nautomating vulnerability detection, but their adoption is often limited by high\ncomputational costs. Although prior work has explored leveraging large models\nthrough agents or workflows, relatively little attention has been given to\nimproving the performance of smaller, fine-tuned models--a critical factor for\nachieving both efficiency and data privacy. In this paper, we introduce\nHKT-SmartAudit, a framework for developing lightweight models optimized for\nsmart contract auditing. It features a multi-stage knowledge distillation\npipeline that integrates classical distillation, external domain knowledge, and\nreward-guided learning to transfer high-quality insights from large teacher\nmodels. A single-task learning strategy is employed to train compact student\nmodels that maintain high accuracy and robustness while significantly reducing\ncomputational overhead. Experimental results show that our distilled models\noutperform both commercial tools and larger models in detecting complex\nvulnerabilities and logical flaws, offering a practical, secure, and scalable\nsolution for smart contract auditing. The source code is available at Github\nrepository."

                "summary": "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has shown impressive capabilities in\nmitigating hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). However, LLMs\nstruggle to maintain consistent reasoning when exposed to misleading or\nconflicting evidence, especially in real-world domains such as politics, where\ninformation is polarized or selectively framed. Mainstream RAG benchmarks\nevaluate models under clean retrieval settings, where systems generate answers\nfrom gold-standard documents, or under synthetically perturbed settings, where\ndocuments are artificially injected with noise. These assumptions fail to\nreflect real-world conditions, often leading to an overestimation of RAG system\nperformance. To address this gap, we introduce RAGuard, the first benchmark to\nevaluate the robustness of RAG systems against misleading retrievals. Unlike\nprior benchmarks that rely on synthetic noise, our fact-checking dataset\ncaptures naturally occurring misinformation by constructing its retrieval\ncorpus from Reddit discussions. It categorizes retrieved evidence into three\ntypes: supporting, misleading, and unrelated, providing a realistic and\nchallenging testbed for assessing how well RAG systems navigate different types\nof evidence.

                    "value": "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has shown impressive capabilities in\nmitigating hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). However, LLMs\nstruggle to maintain consistent reasoning when exposed to misleading or\nconflicting evidence, especially in real-world domains such as politics, where\ninformation is polarized or selectively framed. Mainstream RAG benchmarks\nevaluate models under clean retrieval settings, where systems generate answers\nfrom gold-standard documents, or under synthetically perturbed settings, where\ndocuments are artificially injected with noise. These assumptions fail to\nreflect real-world conditions, often leading to an overestimation of RAG system\nperformance. To address this gap, we introduce RAGuard, the first benchmark to\nevaluate the robustness of RAG systems against misleading retrievals. Unlike\nprior benchmarks that rely on synthetic noise, our fact-checking dataset\ncaptures naturally occurring misinformation by constructing its retrieval\ncorpus from Reddit discussions. It categorizes retrieved evidence into three\ntypes: supporting, misleading, and unrelated, providing a realistic and\nchallenging testbed for assessing how well RAG systems navigate different types\nof evidence. Our experiments reveal that, when exposed to potentially\nmisleading retrievals, all tested LLM-powered RAG systems perform worse than\ntheir zero-shot baselines (i.e., no retrieval at all), while human annotators\nconsistently perform better, highlighting LLMs' susceptibility to noisy\nenvironments.

To train\nBiMediX2, we curate BiMed-V, an extensive Arabic-English bilingual healthcare\ndataset consisting of 1.6M samples of diverse medical interactions. This\ndataset supports a range of medical Large Language Model (LLM) and Large\nMultimodal Model (LMM) tasks, including multi-turn medical conversations,\nreport generation, and visual question answering (VQA). We also introduce\nBiMed-MBench, the first Arabic-English medical LMM evaluation benchmark,\nverified by medical experts. BiMediX2 demonstrates excellent performance across\nmultiple medical LLM and LMM benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art results\ncompared to other open-sourced models. On BiMed-MBench, BiMediX2 outperforms\nexisting methods by over 9% in English and more than 20% in Arabic evaluations.\nAdditionally, it surpasses GPT-4 by approximately 9% in UPHILL factual accuracy\nevaluations and excels in various medical VQA, report generation, and report\nsummarization tasks.

This\ndataset supports a range of medical Large Language Model (LLM) and Large\nMultimodal Model (LMM) tasks, including multi-turn medical conversations,\nreport generation, and visual question answering (VQA). We also introduce\nBiMed-MBench, the first Arabic-English medical LMM evaluation benchmark,\nverified by medical experts. BiMediX2 demonstrates excellent performance across\nmultiple medical LLM and LMM benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art results\ncompared to other open-sourced models. On BiMed-MBench, BiMediX2 outperforms\nexisting methods by over 9% in English and more than 20% in Arabic evaluations.\nAdditionally, it surpasses GPT-4 by approximately 9% in UPHILL factual accuracy\nevaluations and excels in various medical VQA, report generation, and report\nsummarization tasks. Our trained models, instruction set, and source code are\navailable at https://github.com/mbzuai-oryx/BiMediX2"

Through a detailed analysis\nof audio-visual LLMs, we identify attention sinks and massive activations not\nonly at the BOS token but also at intermediate low-semantic tokens across ASR,\nVSR, and AVSR. We show that massive activations originate in the MLP layers and\ncorrespond to fixed feature indices across all sink tokens. We further show\nthat intermediate sink tokens exhibit high cosine similarity to the BOS token,\nthereby amplifying attention and activation. Building on these insights, we\nintroduce a simple decorrelation loss that reduces cosine similarity between\nBOS and other tokens, effectively mitigating intermediate sinks and massive\nactivations.

Extensive experiments\non multiple image classification datasets demonstrate REP's superior resource\nefficiency over state-of-the-art rehearsal-free CL methods."

This study employs a zero-shot classification approach\nto evaluate algorithmic political partisanship through a methodical combination\nof ideological alignment, topicality, response sentiment, and objectivity. A\ntotal of 1800 model responses across six mainstream large language models\n(LLMs) were individually input into four distinct fine-tuned classification\nalgorithms, each responsible for computing one of the aforementioned metrics.\nThe results show an amplified liberal-authoritarian alignment across the six\nLLMs evaluated, with notable instances of reasoning supersessions and canned\nrefusals. The study subsequently highlights the psychological influences\nunderpinning human-computer interactions and how intrinsic biases can permeate\npublic discourse. The resulting distortion of the political landscape can\nultimately manifest as conformity or polarization, depending on the region's\npre-existing socio-political structures.",
