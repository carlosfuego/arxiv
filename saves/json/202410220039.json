Specifically, we use web search titles and snippets to ground queries in\nreal-world information and utilize GPT-4 to generate query rewrites and\nexplanations that clarify user intent. These signals are efficiently integrated\nthrough a Fusion-in-Decoder based Unity architecture, enabling both dense and\ngenerative retrieval with serving costs on par with traditional context-free\nmodels. To address scenarios where context is unavailable in the cache, we\nintroduce context glancing, a curriculum learning strategy that improves model\nrobustness and performance even without contextual signals during inference.\nExtensive offline experiments demonstrate that our context-aware approach\nsubstantially outperforms context-free models.

However, increasing the number of model\nlayers and the length of input sequences significantly escalates the memory\nrequired to store key-value (KV) cache, posing challenges for efficient\ninference. To mitigate this issue, we present SimLayerKV, a simple yet\neffective method that reduces inter-layer KV cache redundancies by selectively\ndropping cache in identified lazy layers. Our approach is based on the\nobservation that certain layers in long-context LLMs exhibit \"lazy\" behavior,\ncontributing less to modeling long-range dependencies compared to non-lazy\nlayers. By analyzing attention weight patterns, we find that the behavior of\nthese lazy layers is consistent across tokens during generation for a given\ninput. This insight motivates our SimLayerKV, which identifies lazy layers and\nreduces their KV cache accordingly. SimLayerKV is training-free, generalizable,\nand can be implemented with only seven lines of code. We conduct extensive\nexperiments on three representative LLMs, e.g., LLaMA2-7B, LLaMA3-8B, and\nMistral-7B across 16 tasks from the LongBench benchmark. The results\ndemonstrate that SimLayerKV achieves a KV cache compression ratio of 5$\\times$\nwith only a 1.2% performance drop when combined with 4-bit quantization.

However, increasing the number of model\nlayers and the length of input sequences significantly escalates the memory\nrequired to store key-value (KV) cache, posing challenges for efficient\ninference. To mitigate this issue, we present SimLayerKV, a simple yet\neffective method that reduces inter-layer KV cache redundancies by selectively\ndropping cache in identified lazy layers. Our approach is based on the\nobservation that certain layers in long-context LLMs exhibit \"lazy\" behavior,\ncontributing less to modeling long-range dependencies compared to non-lazy\nlayers. By analyzing attention weight patterns, we find that the behavior of\nthese lazy layers is consistent across tokens during generation for a given\ninput. This insight motivates our SimLayerKV, which identifies lazy layers and\nreduces their KV cache accordingly. SimLayerKV is training-free, generalizable,\nand can be implemented with only seven lines of code. We conduct extensive\nexperiments on three representative LLMs, e.g., LLaMA2-7B, LLaMA3-8B, and\nMistral-7B across 16 tasks from the LongBench benchmark. The results\ndemonstrate that SimLayerKV achieves a KV cache compression ratio of 5$\\times$\nwith only a 1.2% performance drop when combined with 4-bit quantization. Our\ncode is available at https://github.com/sail-sg/SimLayerKV."

Although\nrecent works on linear and sparse attention mechanisms can achieve this goal,\ntheir real-world applicability is often limited by the need to re-train from\nscratch and significantly worse performance. In response, we propose a novel\napproach, Hierarchically Pruned Attention (HiP), which reduces the time\ncomplexity of the attention mechanism to $O(T \\log T)$ and the space complexity\nto $O(T)$, where $T$ is the sequence length. We notice a pattern in the\nattention scores of pretrained LLMs where tokens close together tend to have\nsimilar scores, which we call ``attention locality''. Based on this\nobservation, we utilize a novel tree-search-like algorithm that estimates the\ntop-$k$ key tokens for a given query on the fly, which is mathematically\nguaranteed to have better performance than random attention pruning. In\naddition to improving the time complexity of the attention mechanism, we\nfurther optimize GPU memory usage by implementing KV cache offloading, which\nstores only $O(\\log T)$ tokens on the GPU while maintaining similar decoding\nthroughput. Experiments on benchmarks show that HiP, with its training-free\nnature, significantly reduces both prefill and decoding latencies, as well as\nmemory usage, while maintaining high-quality generation with minimal\ndegradation. HiP enables pretrained LLMs to scale up to millions of tokens on\ncommodity GPUs, potentially unlocking long-context LLM applications previously\ndeemed infeasible.",

We notice a pattern in the\nattention scores of pretrained LLMs where tokens close together tend to have\nsimilar scores, which we call ``attention locality''. Based on this\nobservation, we utilize a novel tree-search-like algorithm that estimates the\ntop-$k$ key tokens for a given query on the fly, which is mathematically\nguaranteed to have better performance than random attention pruning. In\naddition to improving the time complexity of the attention mechanism, we\nfurther optimize GPU memory usage by implementing KV cache offloading, which\nstores only $O(\\log T)$ tokens on the GPU while maintaining similar decoding\nthroughput. Experiments on benchmarks show that HiP, with its training-free\nnature, significantly reduces both prefill and decoding latencies, as well as\nmemory usage, while maintaining high-quality generation with minimal\ndegradation. HiP enables pretrained LLMs to scale up to millions of tokens on\ncommodity GPUs, potentially unlocking long-context LLM applications previously\ndeemed infeasible."

Yet, it is widely criticized that KV-Cache can become a\nbottleneck of the LLM inference system, especially when confronted with\nultra-large models and long-context queries. A natural remedy is to discard the\nKV-Cache for less important tokens, with StreamingLLM as an example, but the\nused static eviction strategies cannot flexibly adapt to varying contexts.\nRemedies like H2O leverage accumulative attention scores to perform dynamic\neviction but suffer from the attention bias issue in capturing contextual\ninformation. This paper bridges this gap by devising a parameterized KV-Cache\neviction mechanism, dubbed as Attention-Gate, which accepts the whole context\nas input and yields eviction flags for each token to realize in-context\neviction. The subsequent self-attention module proceeds according to the flags\nand only the KV states for the remaining tokens need to be cached. The\nAttention-Gates can vary among different heads and layers and be trivially\nplugged into pre-trained LLMs, tuned by cost-effective continual pre-training\nor supervised fine-tuning objectives to acquire what to discard. The\ncomputational and memory overhead introduced by Attention-Gates is minimal. Our\nmethod is validated across multiple tasks, demonstrating both efficiency and\nadaptability. After a highly efficient continual pre-training, it achieves\nhigher average accuracy and evicts more tokens compared to traditional\ntraining-free methods. In supervised fine-tuning, it not only evicts many\ntokens but also outperforms LoRA-finetuned LLMs on some datasets, such as RTE,\nwhere it improves accuracy by 13.9% while evicting 62.8% of tokens, showing\nthat effective eviction of redundant tokens can even enhance performance.",

Caching all Key and Value (KV)\nstates across all attention heads consumes substantial memory. Existing KV\ncache pruning methods either damage the long-context capabilities of LLMs or\noffer only limited efficiency improvements. In this paper, we identify that\nonly a fraction of attention heads, a.k.a, Retrieval Heads, are critical for\nprocessing long contexts and require full attention across all tokens. In\ncontrast, all other heads, which primarily focus on recent tokens and attention\nsinks--referred to as Streaming Heads--do not require full attention. Based on\nthis insight, we introduce DuoAttention, a framework that only applies a full\nKV cache to retrieval heads while using a light-weight, constant-length KV\ncache for streaming heads, which reduces both LLM's decoding and pre-filling\nmemory and latency without compromising its long-context abilities.\nDuoAttention uses a lightweight, optimization-based algorithm with synthetic\ndata to identify retrieval heads accurately. Our method significantly reduces\nlong-context inference memory by up to 2.55x for MHA and 1.67x for GQA models\nwhile speeding up decoding by up to 2.18x and 1.50x and accelerating\npre-filling by up to 1.73x and 1.63x for MHA and GQA models, respectively, with\nminimal accuracy loss compared to full attention.

To\naccommodate SAR, we develop a straightforward architecture termed Fully Masked\nTransformer. We reveal that existing AR variants correspond to specific design\nchoices of sequence order and output intervals within the SAR framework, with\nAR and Masked AR (MAR) as two extreme instances. Notably, SAR facilitates a\nseamless transition from AR to MAR, where intermediate states allow for\ntraining a causal model that benefits from both few-step inference and KV cache\nacceleration, thus leveraging the advantages of both AR and MAR. On the\nImageNet benchmark, we carefully explore the properties of SAR by analyzing the\nimpact of sequence order and output intervals on performance, as well as the\ngeneralization ability regarding inference order and steps. We further validate\nthe potential of SAR by training a 900M text-to-image model capable of\nsynthesizing photo-realistic images with any resolution.

To increase capacity, high bit-density cells, such as Triple-Level\nCell (TLC), are utilized within 3D SSDs. However, due to the inferior\nperformance of TLC, a portion of TLCs is configured to operate as Single-Level\nCell (SLC) to provide high performance, with host data initially directed to\nthe SLCs. In SLC/TLC hybrid 3D SSDs, a portion of the TLC space is designated\nas an SLC cache to achieve high SSD performance by writing host data at the SLC\nspeed. Given the limited size of the SLC cache, block reclamation is necessary\nto free up the SLC cache during idle periods. However, our preliminary studies\nindicate that the SLC cache can lead to a performance cliff if filled rapidly\nand cause significant write amplification when data migration occurs during\nidle times.\n  In this work, we propose leveraging a reprogram operation to address these\nchallenges. Specifically, when the SLC cache is full or during idle periods, a\nreprogram operation is performed to switch used SLC pages to TLC pages in place\n(termed In-place Switch, IPS). Subsequently, other free TLC space is allocated\nas the new SLC cache. IPS can continuously provide sufficient SLC cache within\nSSDs, significantly improving write performance and reducing write\namplification.

However, most studies focus on addressing only one of these\nbottlenecks and do not adequately support dynamic adjustment of sparsity\nconcerning distinct layers or tasks. In this paper, we present ZipVL, an\nefficient inference framework designed for LVLMs that resolves both computation\nand memory bottlenecks through a dynamic ratio allocation strategy of important\ntokens. This ratio is adaptively determined based on the layer-specific\ndistribution of attention scores, rather than fixed hyper-parameters, thereby\nimproving efficiency for less complex tasks while maintaining high performance\nfor more challenging ones. Then we select important tokens based on their\nnormalized attention scores and perform attention mechanism solely on those\nimportant tokens to accelerate the prefill phase. To mitigate the memory\nbottleneck in the decoding phase, we employ mixed-precision quantization to the\nKV cache, where high-bit quantization is used for caches of important tokens,\nwhile low-bit quantization is applied to those of less importance. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that ZipVL can accelerate the prefill phase by\n2.6$\\times$ and reduce GPU memory usage by 50.0%, with a minimal accuracy\nreduction of only 0.2% on Video-MME benchmark over LongVA-7B model, effectively\nenhancing the generation efficiency of LVLMs.",

Probabilistic voxel mapping requires storing past point clouds and\nre-iterating on them to update the uncertainty every iteration, which consumes\nlarge memory space and CPU cycles. To solve this problem, we propose a\ntwo-folded strategy. First, we introduce a compact point-free representation\nfor probabilistic voxels and derive a cumulative update of the planar\nuncertainty without caching original point clouds. Our voxel structure only\nkeeps track of a predetermined set of statistics for points that lie inside it.\nThis method reduces the runtime complexity from $O(MN)$ to $O(N)$ and the space\ncomplexity from $O(N)$ to $O(1)$ where $M$ is the number of iterations and $N$\nis the number of points. Second, to further minimize memory usage and enhance\nmapping accuracy, we provide a strategy to dynamically merge voxels associated\nwith the same physical planes by taking advantage of the geometric features in\nthe real world. Rather than scanning for these coalescible voxels constantly at\nevery iteration, our merging strategy accumulates voxels in a\nlocality-sensitive hash and triggers merging lazily. On-demand merging not only\nreduces memory footprint with minimal computational overhead but also improves\nlocalization accuracy thanks to cross-voxel denoising.

Most of the existing\nKV-cache compression algorithms attempted to sparsify the sequence of tokens by\ntaking advantage of the different importance of tokens. However, most of these\nmethods treat all layers equally, allocating the same KV budget to each layer.\nThis approach is suboptimal, as some layers may be less sensitive to input\ntokens yet still receive the same budget as others. In this work, we found that\nby identifying the importance of attention layers, we could optimize the\nKV-cache jointly from two dimensions, i.e., sequence-wise and layer-wise. Based\non our observations regarding layer-wise importance in inference, we propose\nSqueezeAttention to precisely optimize the allocation of KV-cache budget among\nlayers on-the-fly and then incorporate three representative sequence-wise\nalgorithms to compress the KV-cache for each layer with its very own budget.\nSpecifically, we first measure each layer's importance by calculating the\ncosine similarity of the input prompt differences before and after the\nself-attention layers. Based on this similarity, we then categorize the layers\ninto two groups and adjust their KV budgets accordingly. By optimizing the\nKV-cache from both sequence's and layer's dimensions, SqueezeAttention achieves\naround 30% to 70% of the memory reductions and up to 2.2 times of throughput\nimprovements in a wide range of LLMs and benchmarks.

By optimizing the\nKV-cache from both sequence's and layer's dimensions, SqueezeAttention achieves\naround 30% to 70% of the memory reductions and up to 2.2 times of throughput\nimprovements in a wide range of LLMs and benchmarks. The code is available at\nhttps://github.com/hetailang/SqueezeAttention."

                "summary": "Quantization is essential for deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) by\nenhancing memory efficiency and inference speed. Existing methods for\nactivation quantization mainly address channel-wise outliers, often neglecting\ntoken-wise outliers, leading to reliance on costly per-token dynamic\nquantization. To address this, we introduce PrefixQuant, a novel technique that\nisolates outlier tokens offline without re-training. Specifically, PrefixQuant\nidentifies high-frequency outlier tokens and prefixes them in the KV cache,\npreventing the generation of outlier tokens during inference and simplifying\nquantization. To our knowledge, PrefixQuant is the first to enable efficient\nper-tensor static quantization to outperform expensive per-token dynamic\nquantization. For instance, in W4A4KV4 (4- bit weight, 4-bit activation, and\n4-bit KV cache) Llama-3-8B, PrefixQuant with per-tensor static quantization\nachieves a 7.43 WikiText2 perplexity and 71.08% average accuracy on 5\ncommon-sense reasoning tasks, outperforming previous per-token dynamic\nquantization methods like QuaRot with 0.98 perplexity improvement and +5.98\npoints accuracy. Additionally, the inference speed of W4A4 quantized models\nusing PrefixQuant is 1.60x to 2.81x faster than FP16 models and exceeds QuaRot\nmodels by 1.2x to 1.3x.

                    "value": "Quantization is essential for deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) by\nenhancing memory efficiency and inference speed. Existing methods for\nactivation quantization mainly address channel-wise outliers, often neglecting\ntoken-wise outliers, leading to reliance on costly per-token dynamic\nquantization. To address this, we introduce PrefixQuant, a novel technique that\nisolates outlier tokens offline without re-training. Specifically, PrefixQuant\nidentifies high-frequency outlier tokens and prefixes them in the KV cache,\npreventing the generation of outlier tokens during inference and simplifying\nquantization. To our knowledge, PrefixQuant is the first to enable efficient\nper-tensor static quantization to outperform expensive per-token dynamic\nquantization. For instance, in W4A4KV4 (4- bit weight, 4-bit activation, and\n4-bit KV cache) Llama-3-8B, PrefixQuant with per-tensor static quantization\nachieves a 7.43 WikiText2 perplexity and 71.08% average accuracy on 5\ncommon-sense reasoning tasks, outperforming previous per-token dynamic\nquantization methods like QuaRot with 0.98 perplexity improvement and +5.98\npoints accuracy. Additionally, the inference speed of W4A4 quantized models\nusing PrefixQuant is 1.60x to 2.81x faster than FP16 models and exceeds QuaRot\nmodels by 1.2x to 1.3x. Our code is available at\n\\url{https://github.com/ChenMnZ/PrefixQuant}."

However, scaling the\ngeneration inference of LLMs to such long contexts incurs significant\nadditional computation load, and demands a substantial GPU memory footprint to\nmaintain the key-value (KV) cache of transformer-based LLMs. Existing KV cache\ncompression methods, such as quantization, face memory bottlenecks as context\nlength increases, while static-sized caches, such as eviction, suffer from\ninefficient policies. These limitations restrict deployment on consumer-grade\ndevices like a single Nvidia 4090 GPU. To overcome this, we propose Locret, a\nframework for long-context LLM inference that introduces retaining heads to\nevaluate the causal importance of KV cache units, allowing for more accurate\neviction within a fixed cache size. Locret is fine-tuned on top of the frozen\nbackbone LLM using a minimal amount of data from standard long-context SFT\ndatasets. During inference, we evict low-importance cache units along with a\nchunked prefill pattern, significantly reducing peak GPU memory usage. We\nconduct an extensive empirical study to evaluate Locret, where the experimental\nresults show that Locret outperforms the recent competitive approaches,\nincluding InfLLM, Quantization, SirLLM, and MInference, in terms of memory\nefficiency and the quality of generated contents -- Locret achieves over a 20x\nand 8x KV cache compression ratio compared to the full KV cache for\nPhi-3-mini-128K and Llama-3.1-8B-instruct. Additionally, Locret can be combined\nwith other methods, such as quantization and token merging. To our knowledge,\nLocret is the first framework capable of deploying Llama-3.1-8B or similar\nmodels on a single Nvidia 4090 GPU, enabling 128K long-context inference\nwithout compromising generation quality, and requiring little additional system\noptimizations.",

To address this, two critical steps are often required: a\npretrained LLM typically undergoes a separate stage for context length\nextension by training on long-context data, followed by architectural\nmodifications to reduce the overhead of KV cache during serving. This paper\nargues that integrating length extension with a GPU-friendly KV cache reduction\narchitecture not only reduces training overhead during length extension, but\nalso achieves better long-context performance. This leads to our proposed\nLongGen, which finetunes a pretrained LLM into an efficient architecture during\nlength extension. LongGen builds on three key insights: (1) Sparse attention\npatterns, such as window attention (attending to recent tokens), attention sink\n(initial ones), and blockwise sparse attention (strided token blocks) are\nwell-suited for building efficient long-context models, primarily due to their\nGPU-friendly memory access patterns, enabling efficiency gains not just\ntheoretically but in practice as well. (2) It is essential for the model to\nhave direct access to all tokens. A hybrid architecture with 1/3 full attention\nlayers and 2/3 efficient ones achieves a balanced trade-off between efficiency\nand long-context performance. (3) Lightweight training on 5B long-context data\nis sufficient to extend the hybrid model's context length from 4K to 128K.\n  We evaluate LongGen on both Llama-2 7B and Llama-2 70B, demonstrating its\neffectiveness across different scales. During training with 128K-long contexts,\nLongGen achieves 1.55x training speedup and reduces wall-clock time by 36%,\ncompared to a full-attention baseline. During inference, LongGen reduces KV\ncache memory by 62%, achieving 1.67x prefilling speedup and 1.41x decoding\nspeedup.",

This leads to our proposed\nLongGen, which finetunes a pretrained LLM into an efficient architecture during\nlength extension. LongGen builds on three key insights: (1) Sparse attention\npatterns, such as window attention (attending to recent tokens), attention sink\n(initial ones), and blockwise sparse attention (strided token blocks) are\nwell-suited for building efficient long-context models, primarily due to their\nGPU-friendly memory access patterns, enabling efficiency gains not just\ntheoretically but in practice as well. (2) It is essential for the model to\nhave direct access to all tokens. A hybrid architecture with 1/3 full attention\nlayers and 2/3 efficient ones achieves a balanced trade-off between efficiency\nand long-context performance. (3) Lightweight training on 5B long-context data\nis sufficient to extend the hybrid model's context length from 4K to 128K.\n  We evaluate LongGen on both Llama-2 7B and Llama-2 70B, demonstrating its\neffectiveness across different scales. During training with 128K-long contexts,\nLongGen achieves 1.55x training speedup and reduces wall-clock time by 36%,\ncompared to a full-attention baseline. During inference, LongGen reduces KV\ncache memory by 62%, achieving 1.67x prefilling speedup and 1.41x decoding\nspeedup."

In\naddition, we discuss the possibility of using high-quality generated data to\nachieve two goals: improving the training of detection models and improving the\ntraining datasets themselves. Our contribution aims to facilitate a better\nunderstanding of the dynamics between human and machine text, which will\nultimately support the integrity of information in an increasingly automated\nworld."

A new frontier in this area is given by\n\\emph{dynamic, non-uniform} compression methods, which adjust the compression\nlevels (e.g., sparsity) per-block or even per-layer in order to minimize\naccuracy loss, while guaranteeing a global compression threshold. Yet, current\nmethods rely on heuristics for identifying the \"importance\" of a given layer\ntowards the loss, based on assumptions such as \\emph{error monotonicity}, i.e.\nthat the end-to-end model compression error is proportional to the sum of\nlayer-wise errors. In this paper, we revisit this area, and propose a new and\ngeneral approach for dynamic compression that is provably optimal in a given\ninput range. We begin from the motivating observation that, in general,\n\\emph{error monotonicity does not hold for LLMs}: compressed models with lower\nsum of per-layer errors can perform \\emph{worse} than models with higher error\nsums. To address this, we propose a new general evolutionary framework for\ndynamic LLM compression called EvoPress, which has provable convergence, and\nlow sample and evaluation complexity. We show that these theoretical guarantees\nlead to highly competitive practical performance for dynamic compression of\nLlama, Mistral and Phi models. Via EvoPress, we set new state-of-the-art\nresults across all compression approaches: structural pruning (block/layer\ndropping), unstructured sparsity, as well as quantization with dynamic\nbitwidths.

Generating\nmultiple-choice questions (MCQG) for professional exams, like the United States\nMedical Licensing Examination (USMLE), is particularly challenging, requiring\ndomain expertise and complex multi-hop reasoning for high-quality questions.\nHowever, current large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 struggle with\nprofessional MCQG due to outdated knowledge, hallucination issues, and prompt\nsensitivity, resulting in unsatisfactory quality and difficulty. To address\nthese challenges, we propose MCQG-SRefine, an LLM self-refine-based (Critique\nand Correction) framework for converting medical cases into high-quality\nUSMLE-style questions. By integrating expert-driven prompt engineering with\niterative self-critique and self-correction feedback, MCQG-SRefine\nsignificantly enhances human expert satisfaction regarding both the quality and\ndifficulty of the questions.

                    "value": "Automatic question generation (QG) is essential for AI and NLP, particularly\nin intelligent tutoring, dialogue systems, and fact verification. Generating\nmultiple-choice questions (MCQG) for professional exams, like the United States\nMedical Licensing Examination (USMLE), is particularly challenging, requiring\ndomain expertise and complex multi-hop reasoning for high-quality questions.\nHowever, current large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 struggle with\nprofessional MCQG due to outdated knowledge, hallucination issues, and prompt\nsensitivity, resulting in unsatisfactory quality and difficulty. To address\nthese challenges, we propose MCQG-SRefine, an LLM self-refine-based (Critique\nand Correction) framework for converting medical cases into high-quality\nUSMLE-style questions. By integrating expert-driven prompt engineering with\niterative self-critique and self-correction feedback, MCQG-SRefine\nsignificantly enhances human expert satisfaction regarding both the quality and\ndifficulty of the questions. Furthermore, we introduce an LLM-as-Judge-based\nautomatic metric to replace the complex and costly expert evaluation process,\nensuring reliable and expert-aligned assessments."

We present TwisterLister, a\npipeline for generating phonologically informed tongue twisters from large\nlanguage models (LLMs) that we use to generate TwistList 2.0, the largest\nannotated dataset of tongue twisters to date, consisting of 17K+ examples from\na combination of human and LLM authors. Our generation pipeline involves the\nuse of a phonologically constrained vocabulary alongside LLM prompting to\ngenerate novel, non-derivative tongue twister examples. We additionally present\nthe results of automatic and human evaluation of smaller models trained on our\ngenerated dataset to demonstrate the extent to which phonologically motivated\nlanguage types can be generated without explicit injection of phonological\nknowledge. Additionally, we introduce a phoneme-aware constrained decoding\nmodule (PACD) that can be integrated into an autoregressive language model and\ndemonstrate that this method generates good quality tongue twisters both with\nand without fine-tuning the underlying language model.

This work introduces a\nnovel multimodal meta-learning method for few-shot ECG question answering,\naddressing the challenge of limited labeled data while leveraging the rich\nknowledge encoded within large language models (LLMs). Our LLM-agnostic\napproach integrates a pre-trained ECG encoder with a frozen LLM (e.g., LLaMA\nand Gemma) via a trainable fusion module, enabling the language model to reason\nabout ECG data and generate clinically meaningful answers. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate superior generalization to unseen diagnostic tasks\ncompared to supervised baselines, achieving notable performance even with\nlimited ECG leads. For instance, in a 5-way 5-shot setting, our method using\nLLaMA-3.1-8B achieves accuracy of 84.6%, 77.3%, and 69.6% on single verify,\nchoose and query question types, respectively.

For our COMPAS models, we calculate\nthe likelihood with and without the dependence on the predicted number of BBH\nmerger events. We find strong correlations between hyper-parameters governing\nthe specific angular momentum (AM) of mass lost during mass transfer, the\nmass-loss rates of Wolf-Rayet stars via winds and the chemically homogeneous\nevolution (CHE) formation channel. We conclude that analysing the marginalised\nand unmarginalised likelihood is a good indicator of whether the population\nparameters distribution and number of observed events reflect the LVK data.

Looking at the smaller number of models\nwhich perform well with both likelihoods, we find that those with no CHE, AM\nloss occurring closer to the donor during the first mass-transfer event, and/or\nhigher rates of mass-loss from Wolf-Rayet winds are generally preferred by\ncurrent data.

Our\nanalysis and reduced modelling of these processes provide further insights into\ndetachment control observations, the workings of long-legged divertors and\ndivertor power balance."

To complete their capability, we study to automatically\ndiscover and recognize visual classes of industrial anomalies. In terms of\nmulti-class anomaly classification, previous methods cluster anomalies\nrepresented by frozen pre-trained models but often fail due to poor\ndiscrimination. Novel class discovery (NCD) has the potential to tackle this.\nHowever, it struggles with non-prominent and semantically weak anomalies that\nchallenge network learning focus. To address these, we introduce AnomalyNCD, a\nmulti-class anomaly classification framework compatible with existing anomaly\ndetection methods. This framework learns anomaly-specific features and\nclassifies anomalies in a self-supervised manner. Initially, a technique called\nMain Element Binarization (MEBin) is first designed, which segments primary\nanomaly regions into masks to alleviate the impact of incorrect detections on\nlearning. Subsequently, we employ mask-guided contrastive representation\nlearning to improve feature discrimination, which focuses network attention on\nisolated anomalous regions and reduces the confusion of erroneous inputs\nthrough re-corrected pseudo labels. Finally, to enable flexible classification\nat both region and image levels during inference, we develop a region merging\nstrategy that determines the overall image category based on the classified\nanomaly regions. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art works on the MVTec\nAD and MTD datasets. Compared with the current methods, AnomalyNCD combined\nwith zero-shot anomaly detection method achieves a 10.8% $F_1$ gain, 8.8% NMI\ngain, and 9.5% ARI gain on MVTec AD, 12.8% $F_1$ gain, 5.7% NMI gain, and 10.8%\nARI gain on MTD.

In this paper we used some of the connected young open clusters (age\n$\\lesssim$ 100 Myr) as tracers of the molecular clouds.

For a subsample consisting of 41 FGK stars we also studied the\nchromospheric activity and the content of Li, from which we inferred the age of\nthe parent clusters. These values agree with the evolutionary ages reported in\nthe literature. For these FGK stars we determined the chemical abundances for\n25 species. Pleiades, ASCC 16 and NGC 7058 exhibit a solar metallicity while\nMelotte 20, ASCC 19, NGC 2232, and Roslund 6 show a slightly subsolar value\n($\\approx-$0.1 dex).

Entity matching is a central step in most data\nintegration pipelines. Many state-of-the-art entity matching methods rely on\npre-trained language models (PLMs) such as BERT or RoBERTa. Two major drawbacks\nof these models for entity matching are that (i) the models require significant\namounts of task-specific training data and (ii) the fine-tuned models are not\nrobust concerning out-of-distribution entities. This paper investigates using\ngenerative large language models (LLMs) as a less task-specific training\ndata-dependent and more robust alternative to PLM-based matchers. The study\ncovers hosted and open-source LLMs which can be run locally. We evaluate these\nmodels in a zero-shot scenario and a scenario where task-specific training data\nis available. We compare different prompt designs and the prompt sensitivity of\nthe models. We show that there is no single best prompt but that the prompt\nneeds to be tuned for each model/dataset combination. We further investigate\n(i) the selection of in-context demonstrations, (ii) the generation of matching\nrules, as well as (iii) fine-tuning LLMs using the same pool of training data.\nOur experiments show that the best LLMs require no or only a few training\nexamples to perform comparably to PLMs that were fine-tuned using thousands of\nexamples. LLM-based matchers further exhibit higher robustness to unseen\nentities. We show that GPT4 can generate structured explanations for matching\ndecisions and can automatically identify potential causes of matching errors by\nanalyzing explanations of wrong decisions.

In this paper, we propose a new pretraining paradigm for\nLMMs to enhance the visual comprehension capabilities of LLMs by introducing a\nnovel cross-modal comprehension stage. Specifically, we design a dynamically\nlearnable prompt token pool and employ the Hungarian algorithm to replace part\nof the original visual tokens with the most relevant prompt tokens.

Meanwhile, we integrate a detailed caption generation task,\nleveraging rich descriptions to further facilitate LLMs in understanding visual\nsemantic information. After pretraining on 1.5 million publicly accessible\ndata, we present a new foundation model called Croc.

It is commonly applied under Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) and\noffline classroom settings. With this system, instructors receive a reduced\ngrading workload, and students enhance their understanding of course materials\nby grading others' work. Peer grading data have a complex dependence structure,\nfor which all the peer grades may be dependent. This complex dependence\nstructure is due to a network structure of peer grading, where each student can\nbe viewed as a vertex of the network, and each peer grade serves as an edge\nconnecting one student as a grader to another student as an examinee. This\npaper introduces a latent variable model framework for analyzing peer grading\ndata and develops a fully Bayesian procedure for its statistical inference.\nThis framework has several advantages. First, when aggregating multiple peer\ngrades, the average score and other simple summary statistics fail to account\nfor grader effects and, thus, can be biased. The proposed approach produces\nmore accurate model parameter estimates and, therefore, more accurate\naggregated grades, by modeling the heterogeneous grading behavior with latent\nvariables. Second, the proposed method provides a way to assess each student's\nperformance as a grader, which may be used to identify a pool of reliable\ngraders or generate feedback to help students improve their grading. Third, our\nmodel may further provide insights into the peer grading system by answering\nquestions such as whether a student who performs better in coursework also\ntends to be a more reliable grader. Finally, thanks to the Bayesian approach,\nuncertainty quantification is straightforward when inferring the\nstudent-specific latent variables as well as the structural parameters of the\nmodel.

The\ndust-reddened quasar, F2M110648.35$+$480712 at $z = 0.4352$ is one of the few\ncases at its redshift that exhibits powerful quasar feedback through bipolar\noutflows. Our new observation with the integral field unit mode of\nNear-infrared Spectrograph onboard JWST opens a new window to examine this\nspectacular outflow through Pa$\\alpha$ emission line with $\\sim$3$\\times$\nbetter spatial resolution than previous work. The morphology and kinematics of\nthe Pa$\\alpha$ nebula confirm the existence of a bipolar outflow extending on a\nscale of $\\sim$17$\\times$14 kpc and with a velocity reaching $\\sim$1100 km\ns$^{-1}$. The higher spatial resolution of our new observation leads to more\nreliable measurements of outflow kinematics. Considering only the spatially\nresolved outflow and assuming an electron density of 100 cm$^{-2}$, the mass,\nmomentum and kinetic energy outflow rates are $\\sim$50-210 M$_{\\odot}$\nyr$^{-1}$, $\\sim$0.3-1.7$\\times$10$^{36}$ dynes ($\\sim$14-78\\% of the quasar\nphoton momentum flux) and $\\sim$0.16-1.27$\\times$10$^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$\n($\\sim$0.02-0.20\\% of the quasar bolometric luminosity), respectively.

We argue that robust LLMs should demonstrate situated\nfaithfulness, dynamically calibrating their trust in external information based\non their confidence in the internal knowledge and the external context. To\nbenchmark this capability, we evaluate LLMs across several QA datasets,\nincluding a newly created dataset called RedditQA featuring in-the-wild\nincorrect contexts sourced from Reddit posts. We show that when provided with\nboth correct and incorrect contexts, both open-source and proprietary models\ntend to overly rely on external information, regardless of its factual\naccuracy. To enhance situated faithfulness, we propose two approaches:\nSelf-Guided Confidence Reasoning (SCR) and Rule-Based Confidence Reasoning\n(RCR). SCR enables models to self-access the confidence of external information\nrelative to their own internal knowledge to produce the most accurate answer.\nRCR, in contrast, extracts explicit confidence signals from the LLM and\ndetermines the final answer using predefined rules. Our results show that for\nLLMs with strong reasoning capabilities, such as GPT-4o and GPT-4o mini, SCR\noutperforms RCR, achieving improvements of up to 24.2% over a direct input\naugmentation baseline. Conversely, for a smaller model like Llama-3-8B, RCR\noutperforms SCR. Fine-tuning SCR with our proposed Confidence Reasoning Direct\nPreference Optimization (CR-DPO) method improves performance on both seen and\nunseen datasets, yielding an average improvement of 8.9% on Llama-3-8B. In\naddition to quantitative results, we offer insights into the relative strengths\nof SCR and RCR. Our findings highlight promising avenues for improving situated\nfaithfulness in LLMs. The data and code are released.",

We show that when provided with\nboth correct and incorrect contexts, both open-source and proprietary models\ntend to overly rely on external information, regardless of its factual\naccuracy. To enhance situated faithfulness, we propose two approaches:\nSelf-Guided Confidence Reasoning (SCR) and Rule-Based Confidence Reasoning\n(RCR). SCR enables models to self-access the confidence of external information\nrelative to their own internal knowledge to produce the most accurate answer.\nRCR, in contrast, extracts explicit confidence signals from the LLM and\ndetermines the final answer using predefined rules. Our results show that for\nLLMs with strong reasoning capabilities, such as GPT-4o and GPT-4o mini, SCR\noutperforms RCR, achieving improvements of up to 24.2% over a direct input\naugmentation baseline. Conversely, for a smaller model like Llama-3-8B, RCR\noutperforms SCR. Fine-tuning SCR with our proposed Confidence Reasoning Direct\nPreference Optimization (CR-DPO) method improves performance on both seen and\nunseen datasets, yielding an average improvement of 8.9% on Llama-3-8B. In\naddition to quantitative results, we offer insights into the relative strengths\nof SCR and RCR. Our findings highlight promising avenues for improving situated\nfaithfulness in LLMs. The data and code are released."

It is\ncrucial for reliable decision-making systems to have the capability to cast an\nalert whenever they encounter unfamiliar observations that they are not\nequipped to handle. In this paper, we propose a novel Mahalanobis\ndistance-based (MD) anomaly detection framework, called \\textit{MDX}, for deep\nRL algorithms. MDX simultaneously addresses random, adversarial, and\nout-of-distribution (OOD) state outliers in both offline and online settings.\nIt utilizes Mahalanobis distance within class-conditional distributions for\neach action and operates within a statistical hypothesis testing framework\nunder the Gaussian assumption. We further extend it to robust and\ndistribution-free versions by incorporating Robust MD and conformal inference\ntechniques. Through extensive experiments on classical control environments,\nAtari games, and autonomous driving scenarios, we demonstrate the effectiveness\nof our MD-based detection framework. MDX offers a simple, unified, and\npractical anomaly detection tool for enhancing the safety and reliability of RL\nsystems in real-world applications.",

                    "value": "In deep reinforcement learning (RL) systems, abnormal states pose significant\nrisks by potentially triggering unpredictable behaviors and unsafe actions,\nthus impeding the deployment of RL systems in real-world scenarios. It is\ncrucial for reliable decision-making systems to have the capability to cast an\nalert whenever they encounter unfamiliar observations that they are not\nequipped to handle. In this paper, we propose a novel Mahalanobis\ndistance-based (MD) anomaly detection framework, called \\textit{MDX}, for deep\nRL algorithms. MDX simultaneously addresses random, adversarial, and\nout-of-distribution (OOD) state outliers in both offline and online settings.\nIt utilizes Mahalanobis distance within class-conditional distributions for\neach action and operates within a statistical hypothesis testing framework\nunder the Gaussian assumption. We further extend it to robust and\ndistribution-free versions by incorporating Robust MD and conformal inference\ntechniques. Through extensive experiments on classical control environments,\nAtari games, and autonomous driving scenarios, we demonstrate the effectiveness\nof our MD-based detection framework. MDX offers a simple, unified, and\npractical anomaly detection tool for enhancing the safety and reliability of RL\nsystems in real-world applications."

With the explosion of Large Language Models\n(LLMs), the CS field has seen major improvements with LLMs rewriting user\nqueries, accounting for conversational context. However, engaging LLMs at\ninference time harms efficiency. Current methods address this by distilling\nembeddings from human-rewritten queries to learn the context modeling task.\nYet, these approaches predominantly focus on context modeling, and only treat\nthe contrastive component of the retrieval task within a\ndistillation-independent loss term. To address these limitations, we propose a\nnew distillation method, as a relaxation of the previous objective, unifying\nretrieval and context modeling. We relax the existing training objectives by\ndistilling similarity scores between conversations and documents, rather than\nrelying solely on representation learning. Our proposed distillation objective\nallows for more freedom in the representation space and leverages the\ncontrastive nature of document relevance. Through experiments on Learned Sparse\nRetrieval (LSR) across 5 CS datasets, our approach demonstrates substantial\nimprovements in both in-domain and out-of-domain retrieval performance,\noutperforming state-of-the-art with gains of up to 6 points in recall for\nout-of-domain datasets. Additionally, through the relaxation of the objective,\nwe propose a multi-teacher distillation, using multiple LLMs as teachers,\nyielding additional gains, and outperforming the teachers themselves in\nin-domain experiments.

During pre-retrieval, tool\ndocuments are enhanced with key information and stored in the Toolshed\nKnowledge Base. Intra-retrieval focuses on query planning and transformation to\nincrease retrieval accuracy. Post-retrieval refines the retrieved tool\ndocuments and enables self-reflection. Furthermore, by varying both the total\nnumber of tools (tool-M) an Agent has access to and the tool selection\nthreshold (top-k), we address trade-offs between retrieval accuracy, agent\nperformance, and token cost.

In this article, we\npresent new work on the generation of English tongue twisters - a form of\nlanguage that is required to be conditioned on a phoneme level to maximize\nsound overlap, while maintaining semantic consistency with an input topic or\nphrase and still being grammatically correct. We present TwisterLister, a\npipeline for generating phonologically informed tongue twisters from large\nlanguage models (LLMs) that we use to generate TwistList 2.0, the largest\nannotated dataset of tongue twisters to date, consisting of 17K+ examples from\na combination of human and LLM authors. Our generation pipeline involves the\nuse of a phonologically constrained vocabulary alongside LLM prompting to\ngenerate novel, non-derivative tongue twister examples. We additionally present\nthe results of automatic and human evaluation of smaller models trained on our\ngenerated dataset to demonstrate the extent to which phonologically motivated\nlanguage types can be generated without explicit injection of phonological\nknowledge. Additionally, we introduce a phoneme-aware constrained decoding\nmodule (PACD) that can be integrated into an autoregressive language model and\ndemonstrate that this method generates good quality tongue twisters both with\nand without fine-tuning the underlying language model. We also design and\nimplement a range of automatic metrics for the task of tongue twister\ngeneration that is phonologically motivated and captures the unique essence of\ntongue twisters, primarily based on phonemic edit distance (PED)",

In this article, we\npresent new work on the generation of English tongue twisters - a form of\nlanguage that is required to be conditioned on a phoneme level to maximize\nsound overlap, while maintaining semantic consistency with an input topic or\nphrase and still being grammatically correct. We present TwisterLister, a\npipeline for generating phonologically informed tongue twisters from large\nlanguage models (LLMs) that we use to generate TwistList 2.0, the largest\nannotated dataset of tongue twisters to date, consisting of 17K+ examples from\na combination of human and LLM authors. Our generation pipeline involves the\nuse of a phonologically constrained vocabulary alongside LLM prompting to\ngenerate novel, non-derivative tongue twister examples. We additionally present\nthe results of automatic and human evaluation of smaller models trained on our\ngenerated dataset to demonstrate the extent to which phonologically motivated\nlanguage types can be generated without explicit injection of phonological\nknowledge. Additionally, we introduce a phoneme-aware constrained decoding\nmodule (PACD) that can be integrated into an autoregressive language model and\ndemonstrate that this method generates good quality tongue twisters both with\nand without fine-tuning the underlying language model. We also design and\nimplement a range of automatic metrics for the task of tongue twister\ngeneration that is phonologically motivated and captures the unique essence of\ntongue twisters, primarily based on phonemic edit distance (PED)"

The scarcity of labeled ECG data coupled with the\ndiverse nature of clinical inquiries presents a significant challenge for\ndeveloping robust and adaptable ECG diagnostic systems. This work introduces a\nnovel multimodal meta-learning method for few-shot ECG question answering,\naddressing the challenge of limited labeled data while leveraging the rich\nknowledge encoded within large language models (LLMs).

However, prior methods are limited by the requirement for a large\nnumber of labeled molecules and their restricted ability to generalize for\nunseen and new tasks, both of which are essential for real-world applications.\nTo address these challenges, we present MolecularGPT for few-shot MPP. From a\nperspective on instruction tuning, we fine-tune large language models (LLMs)\nbased on curated molecular instructions spanning over 1000 property prediction\ntasks.

MolecularGPT exhibits competitive in-context\nreasoning capabilities across 10 downstream evaluation datasets, setting new\nbenchmarks for few-shot molecular prediction tasks.

At\nthe same time, we found that few-shot prompting can boost the performance of\ndifferent LLMs, including Gemma (+14%) and LLama-3 (+43%).

Entity matching is a central step in most data\nintegration pipelines. Many state-of-the-art entity matching methods rely on\npre-trained language models (PLMs) such as BERT or RoBERTa. Two major drawbacks\nof these models for entity matching are that (i) the models require significant\namounts of task-specific training data and (ii) the fine-tuned models are not\nrobust concerning out-of-distribution entities. This paper investigates using\ngenerative large language models (LLMs) as a less task-specific training\ndata-dependent and more robust alternative to PLM-based matchers. The study\ncovers hosted and open-source LLMs which can be run locally. We evaluate these\nmodels in a zero-shot scenario and a scenario where task-specific training data\nis available. We compare different prompt designs and the prompt sensitivity of\nthe models. We show that there is no single best prompt but that the prompt\nneeds to be tuned for each model/dataset combination. We further investigate\n(i) the selection of in-context demonstrations, (ii) the generation of matching\nrules, as well as (iii) fine-tuning LLMs using the same pool of training data.\nOur experiments show that the best LLMs require no or only a few training\nexamples to perform comparably to PLMs that were fine-tuned using thousands of\nexamples. LLM-based matchers further exhibit higher robustness to unseen\nentities. We show that GPT4 can generate structured explanations for matching\ndecisions and can automatically identify potential causes of matching errors by\nanalyzing explanations of wrong decisions. We demonstrate that the model can\ngenerate meaningful textual descriptions of the identified error classes, which\ncan help data engineers to improve entity matching pipelines.",

Two major drawbacks\nof these models for entity matching are that (i) the models require significant\namounts of task-specific training data and (ii) the fine-tuned models are not\nrobust concerning out-of-distribution entities. This paper investigates using\ngenerative large language models (LLMs) as a less task-specific training\ndata-dependent and more robust alternative to PLM-based matchers. The study\ncovers hosted and open-source LLMs which can be run locally. We evaluate these\nmodels in a zero-shot scenario and a scenario where task-specific training data\nis available. We compare different prompt designs and the prompt sensitivity of\nthe models. We show that there is no single best prompt but that the prompt\nneeds to be tuned for each model/dataset combination. We further investigate\n(i) the selection of in-context demonstrations, (ii) the generation of matching\nrules, as well as (iii) fine-tuning LLMs using the same pool of training data.\nOur experiments show that the best LLMs require no or only a few training\nexamples to perform comparably to PLMs that were fine-tuned using thousands of\nexamples. LLM-based matchers further exhibit higher robustness to unseen\nentities. We show that GPT4 can generate structured explanations for matching\ndecisions and can automatically identify potential causes of matching errors by\nanalyzing explanations of wrong decisions. We demonstrate that the model can\ngenerate meaningful textual descriptions of the identified error classes, which\ncan help data engineers to improve entity matching pipelines."

However, existing research\nprimarily focuses on tuning language and image instructions, ignoring the\ncritical pretraining phase where models learn to process textual and visual\nmodalities jointly. In this paper, we propose a new pretraining paradigm for\nLMMs to enhance the visual comprehension capabilities of LLMs by introducing a\nnovel cross-modal comprehension stage. Specifically, we design a dynamically\nlearnable prompt token pool and employ the Hungarian algorithm to replace part\nof the original visual tokens with the most relevant prompt tokens. Then, we\nconceptualize visual tokens as analogous to a \"foreign language\" for the LLMs\nand propose a mixed attention mechanism with bidirectional visual attention and\nunidirectional textual attention to comprehensively enhance the understanding\nof visual tokens. Meanwhile, we integrate a detailed caption generation task,\nleveraging rich descriptions to further facilitate LLMs in understanding visual\nsemantic information. After pretraining on 1.5 million publicly accessible\ndata, we present a new foundation model called Croc. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that Croc achieves new state-of-the-art performance on massive\nvision-language benchmarks.

Other critics highlight how\nthey foreshadow vastly more powerful future systems, which might threaten\nhumanity's survival. The first group says there is nothing new here; the other\nlooks through the present to a perhaps distant horizon. In this paper, I\ninstead pay attention to what makes these particular systems distinctive: both\ntheir remarkable scientific achievement, and the most likely and consequential\nways in which they will change society over the next five to ten years. In\nparticular, I explore the potential societal impacts and normative questions\nraised by the looming prospect of 'Language Model Agents', in which multimodal\nlarge language models (LLMs) form the executive centre of complex, tool-using\nAI systems that can take unsupervised sequences of actions towards some goal."

We introduce novel\ntasks and benchmarks spanning six languages and observe that current SOTA LLMs\noften produce conflicting answers to the same questions across languages in\n17.3-57.5% of cases and violate inheritance constraints in up to 37.2% cases.\nTo enhance consistency across languages, we propose novel \"Compositional\nRepresentations\" where tokens are represented as composition of equivalent\ntokens across languages, with resulting conflict reduction (up to -4.7%)\nindicating benefits of shared LLM representations."

                "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results in various\ntasks but struggle with hallucination problems and lack of relevant knowledge,\nespecially in deep complex reasoning and knowledge-intensive tasks. Knowledge\nGraphs (KGs), which capture vast amounts of facts in a structured format, offer\na reliable source of knowledge for reasoning. However, existing KG-based LLM\nreasoning methods face challenges like handling multi-hop reasoning,\nmulti-entity questions, and effectively utilizing graph structures. To address\nthese issues, we propose Paths-over-Graph (PoG), a novel method that enhances\nLLM reasoning by integrating knowledge reasoning paths from KGs, improving the\ninterpretability and faithfulness of LLM outputs. PoG tackles multi-hop and\nmulti-entity questions through a three-phase dynamic multi-hop path\nexploration, which combines the inherent knowledge of LLMs with factual\nknowledge from KGs. In order to improve the efficiency, PoG prunes irrelevant\ninformation from the graph exploration first and introduces efficient\nthree-step pruning techniques that incorporate graph structures, LLM prompting,\nand a pre-trained language model (e.g., SBERT) to effectively narrow down the\nexplored candidate paths. This ensures all reasoning paths contain highly\nrelevant information captured from KGs, making the reasoning faithful and\ninterpretable in problem-solving. PoG innovatively utilizes graph structure to\nprune the irrelevant noise and represents the first method to implement\nmulti-entity deep path detection on KGs for LLM reasoning tasks. Comprehensive\nexperiments on five benchmark KGQA datasets demonstrate PoG outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art method ToG across GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4, achieving an\naverage accuracy improvement of 18.9%. Notably, PoG with GPT-3.5-Turbo\nsurpasses ToG with GPT-4 by up to 23.9%.",

To address these\nchallenges, this paper introduces Agents4PLC, a novel framework that not only\nautomates PLC code generation but also includes code-level verification through\nan LLM-based multi-agent system. We first establish a comprehensive benchmark\nfor verifiable PLC code generation area, transitioning from natural language\nrequirements to human-written-verified formal specifications and reference PLC\ncode. We further enhance our `agents' specifically for industrial control\nsystems by incorporating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), advanced prompt\nengineering techniques, and Chain-of-Thought strategies. Evaluation against the\nbenchmark demonstrates that Agents4PLC significantly outperforms previous\nmethods, achieving superior results across a series of increasingly rigorous\nmetrics. This research not only addresses the critical challenges in PLC\nprogramming but also highlights the potential of our framework to generate\nverifiable code applicable to real-world industrial applications.",

We observe that efforts to\nreduce gender and racial bias often lead to outcomes that may over-index one\nsub-class, potentially exacerbating the issue. These results highlight the\nlimitations of current bias mitigation techniques and underscore the need for\nmore effective approaches."

Despite the remarkable success of Large Language Models (LLMs), they\nface challenges in scientific literature understanding, primarily due to (1) a\nlack of scientific knowledge and (2) unfamiliarity with specialized scientific\ntasks.\n  To develop an LLM specialized in scientific literature understanding, we\npropose a hybrid strategy that integrates continual pre-training (CPT) and\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT), to simultaneously infuse scientific domain\nknowledge and enhance instruction-following capabilities for domain-specific\ntasks.cIn this process, we identify two key challenges: (1) constructing\nhigh-quality CPT corpora, and (2) generating diverse SFT instructions. We\naddress these challenges through a meticulous pipeline, including PDF text\nextraction, parsing content error correction, quality filtering, and synthetic\ninstruction creation. Applying this strategy, we present a suite of LLMs:\nSciLitLLM, specialized in scientific literature understanding. These models\ndemonstrate promising performance on scientific literature understanding\nbenchmarks.\n  Our contributions are threefold: (1) We present an effective framework that\nintegrates CPT and SFT to adapt LLMs to scientific literature understanding,\nwhich can also be easily adapted to other domains. (2) We propose an LLM-based\nsynthesis method to generate diverse and high-quality scientific instructions,\nresulting in a new instruction set -- SciLitIns -- for supervised fine-tuning\nin less-represented scientific domains.
