While this is often seen as a strong\nlimitation, we show how fast these networks can get with our\nhardware-optimization FlashRNN in Triton and CUDA, optimizing kernels to the\nregister level on modern GPUs. We extend traditional RNNs with a\nparallelization variant that processes multiple RNNs of smaller hidden state in\nparallel, similar to the head-wise processing in Transformers.

The doorway arrival phase and the release operation both run in\nconstant-time. Waiting threads use local spinning and only a single waiting\nelement is required per thread, regardless of the number of locks a thread\nmight hold at a given time. While our lock does not provide strict FIFO\nadmission, it bounds bypass and has strong anti-starvation properties. The lock\nis compact, space efficient, and has been intentionally designed to be readily\nusable in real-world general purpose computing environments such as the linux\nkernel, pthreads, or C++. We show the lock exhibits high throughput under\ncontention and low latency in the uncontended case.

The doorway arrival phase and the release operation both run in\nconstant-time. Waiting threads use local spinning and only a single waiting\nelement is required per thread, regardless of the number of locks a thread\nmight hold at a given time. While our lock does not provide strict FIFO\nadmission, it bounds bypass and has strong anti-starvation properties. The lock\nis compact, space efficient, and has been intentionally designed to be readily\nusable in real-world general purpose computing environments such as the linux\nkernel, pthreads, or C++. We show the lock exhibits high throughput under\ncontention and low latency in the uncontended case. The performance of\nReciprocating Locks is competitive with and often better than the best\nstate-of-the-art scalable spin locks."

However, for linear\nsequence modeling methods like linear attention, existing SP approaches do not\ntake advantage of their right-product-first feature, resulting in sub-optimal\ncommunication efficiency and usability. In this paper, we introduce Linear\nAttention Sequence Parallelism (LASP), an efficient SP approach designed for\nlinear attention-based transformer models. Specifically, we design an efficient\npoint-to-point ring-style communication mechanism to leverage the right-product\nkernel trick of linear attention, which sharply decreases the communication\noverhead, comparing with existing SP methods. We enhance the computation\nefficiency of LASP by performing kernel fusion and intermediate state caching,\nmaking the implementation of LASP hardware-friendly on GPUs. Furthermore, we\nmeticulously ensure the compatibility of sequence-level LASP with all types of\nbatch-level data parallel methods, which is vital for distributed training on\nlarge clusters with very-long sequences. We also discuss the generalization of\nLASP on other linear sequence modeling methods. Extensive experiments on linear\nattention-based models are conducted with varying sequence lengths from 2K to\n4096K. LASP scales sequence length up to 4096K on 128 GPUs, which is 8$\\times$\nlonger than existing SP methods. The code is available at\nhttps://github.com/OpenNLPLab/LASP.",

Our wavelet analysis reveals that as tokens approach the end of\nsequence, their contributions to generation gradually increase and tends to\ndiverge more from neighboring tokens, indicating a smooth transition with\nincreasing complexity and variability from distant to nearby context. Motivated\nby this observation, we propose TreeKV, an intuitive, training-free method that\nemploys a tree structure for smooth cache compression. TreeKV maintains a fixed\ncache size, allowing LLMs to deliver high-quality output even in long text\nscenarios. Unlike most compression methods, TreeKV is applicable to both the\ngeneration and prefilling stages. It consistently surpasses all baseline models\nin language modeling tasks on PG19 and OpenWebText2, allowing LLMs trained with\nshort context window to generalize to longer window with a 16x cache reduction.\nOn the Longbench benchmark, TreeKV achieves the best performance with only 6\\%\nof the budget at optimal efficiency.",

Yet the substantial memory requirement of LLMs significantly hinders\ntheir deployment for end users. Post-training quantization (PTQ) serves as one\nof the most hardware-efficient methods to mitigate the memory and computational\ndemands of LLMs. Although the traditional integer (INT) datatype has received\nwidespread adoption in PTQ methods, floating-point (FP) quantization has\nemerged as a viable alternative thanks to its effectiveness in fitting LLM\nnumerical distributions. However, the FP datatype in sign-magnitude binary\nrepresentation contains both positive and negative zero, which constrains its\nrepresentation capability, particularly under low precision (3 and 4 bits). In\nthis paper, we extend the basic FP datatype to perform Redundant Zero Remapping\n(RaZeR), which remaps the negative zero FP encoding to a set of pre-defined\nspecial values to maximally utilize FP quantization encodings and to better fit\nLLM numerical distributions. Through careful selection of special values, RaZeR\noutperforms conventional asymmetric INT quantization while achieving high\ncomputational efficiency. We demonstrate that RaZeR can be seamlessly\nintegrated with quantization algorithms for both weights and KV-cache,\nincluding advanced methods with clipping and transformations, and consistently\nachieve better model accuracy. Additionally, we implement a fast GEMV kernel\nwith fused dequantization that efficiently converts the 4-bit RaZeR value to\nFP16 through novel bit-level manipulation. On modern GPUs, our evaluation shows\nthat RaZeR improves the GEMV speed by up to 7.56$\\times$ compared to the FP16\nimplementation, while achieving up to 2.72$\\times$ speedup in the LLM decoding\nthroughput.",

Concomitantly, the modern\nera is witnessing the proliferation of web applications in all aspects of human\nlife, including IoT and other network services. Contemporary IoT and network\nsolutions heavily rely on web applications to render services. However, despite\nthe recent research and development pivoted around LoRa, there is still a lack\nof studies focusing on web application access over LoRa networks. Specifically,\ntechnical challenges like payload size limitation, low data rate, and\ncontentions in multi-user setups limit the applicability of LoRa for web\napplications.

Aided by first-principles dynamical\ncalculations, we identify the mechanism for these complex behaviors as a\nsuperposition of multiple coherently excited eigenstates of the polar soft\nmode. Our results reveal a previously uncharted quantum facet of SrTiO3 and\nopen pathways for harnessing high-order excitations to engineer quantum\nmaterials in the ultrafast regime."

Long-context LLMs, which\nprocess sequences of tens of thousands of tokens, further increase the demand\non the memory system as the complexity in attention layers and key-value cache\nsizes is proportional to the context length. Processing-in-Memory (PIM)\nmaximizes memory bandwidth by moving compute to the data and can address the\nmemory bandwidth challenges; however, PIM is not necessarily scalable to\naccelerate long-context LLM because of limited per-module memory capacity and\nthe inflexibility of fixed-functional unit PIM architecture and static memory\nmanagement. In this work, we propose LoL-PIM which is a multi-node PIM\narchitecture that accelerates long context LLM through hardware-software\nco-design. In particular, we propose how pipeline parallelism can be exploited\nacross a multi-PIM module while a direct PIM access (DPA) controller (or DMA\nfor PIM) is proposed that enables dynamic PIM memory management and results in\nefficient PIM utilization across a diverse range of context length. We\ndeveloped an MLIR-based compiler for LoL-PIM extending a commercial PIM-based\ncompiler where the software modifications were implemented and evaluated, while\nthe hardware changes were modeled in the simulator. Our evaluations demonstrate\nthat LoL-PIM significantly improves throughput and reduces latency for\nlong-context LLM inference, outperforming both multi-GPU and GPU-PIM systems\n(up to 8.54x and 16.0x speedup, respectively), thereby enabling more efficient\ndeployment of LLMs in real-world applications.",

More\nspecifically, we test the usefulness of optimizations such as (i) software\nprefetching to improve cache performance and (ii) data layout and computation\nreordering optimizations to improve locality in DRAM accesses. These\noptimizations are implemented as modifications to the well-known scikit-learn\nlibrary, and hence can be easily leveraged by application programmers. We\nevaluate the impact of the proposed optimizations using a combination of\nsimulation and execution on a real system. The software prefetching\noptimization results in performance benefits varying from 5.2%-27.1% on\ndifferent ML applications while the data layout and computation reordering\napproaches yield 6.16%-28.0% performance improvement."

                "summary": "Diffusion Transformers (DiT) have become the dominant methods in image and\nvideo generation yet still suffer substantial computational costs. As an\neffective approach for DiT acceleration, feature caching methods are designed\nto cache the features of DiT in previous timesteps and reuse them in the next\ntimesteps, allowing us to skip the computation in the next timesteps. However,\non the one hand, aggressively reusing all the features cached in previous\ntimesteps leads to a severe drop in generation quality. On the other hand,\nconservatively caching only the features in the redundant layers or tokens but\nstill computing the important ones successfully preserves the generation\nquality but results in reductions in acceleration ratios. Observing such a\ntradeoff between generation quality and acceleration performance, this paper\nbegins by quantitatively studying the accumulated error from cached features.\nSurprisingly, we find that aggressive caching does not introduce significantly\nmore caching errors in the caching step, and the conservative feature caching\ncan fix the error introduced by aggressive caching. Thereby, we propose a dual\ncaching strategy that adopts aggressive and conservative caching iteratively,\nleading to significant acceleration and high generation quality at the same\ntime. Besides, we further introduce a V-caching strategy for token-wise\nconservative caching, which is compatible with flash attention and requires no\ntraining and calibration data.\n  Our codes have been released in Github: \\textbf{Code:\n\\href{https://github.com/Shenyi-Z/DuCa}{\\texttt{\\textcolor{cyan}{https://github.com/Shenyi-Z/DuCa}}}}",

                    "value": "Diffusion Transformers (DiT) have become the dominant methods in image and\nvideo generation yet still suffer substantial computational costs. As an\neffective approach for DiT acceleration, feature caching methods are designed\nto cache the features of DiT in previous timesteps and reuse them in the next\ntimesteps, allowing us to skip the computation in the next timesteps. However,\non the one hand, aggressively reusing all the features cached in previous\ntimesteps leads to a severe drop in generation quality. On the other hand,\nconservatively caching only the features in the redundant layers or tokens but\nstill computing the important ones successfully preserves the generation\nquality but results in reductions in acceleration ratios. Observing such a\ntradeoff between generation quality and acceleration performance, this paper\nbegins by quantitatively studying the accumulated error from cached features.\nSurprisingly, we find that aggressive caching does not introduce significantly\nmore caching errors in the caching step, and the conservative feature caching\ncan fix the error introduced by aggressive caching. Thereby, we propose a dual\ncaching strategy that adopts aggressive and conservative caching iteratively,\nleading to significant acceleration and high generation quality at the same\ntime. Besides, we further introduce a V-caching strategy for token-wise\nconservative caching, which is compatible with flash attention and requires no\ntraining and calibration data.\n  Our codes have been released in Github: \\textbf{Code:\n\\href{https://github.com/Shenyi-Z/DuCa}{\\texttt{\\textcolor{cyan}{https://github.com/Shenyi-Z/DuCa}}}}"

However, the standard approaches generate sequences\nof discrete tokens immediately before responding, and so they can incur\nsignificant latency costs and be challenging to optimize. In this work, we\ndemonstrate that a frozen LLM can be augmented with an offline coprocessor that\noperates on the model's key-value (kv) cache. This coprocessor augments the\ncache with a set of latent embeddings designed to improve the fidelity of\nsubsequent decoding. We train this coprocessor using the language modeling loss\nfrom the decoder on standard pretraining data, while keeping the decoder itself\nfrozen. This approach enables the model to learn, in an end-to-end\ndifferentiable fashion, how to distill additional computation into its\nkv-cache.

                    "value": "Techniques enabling large language models (LLMs) to \"think more\" by\ngenerating and attending to intermediate reasoning steps have shown promise in\nsolving complex problems. However, the standard approaches generate sequences\nof discrete tokens immediately before responding, and so they can incur\nsignificant latency costs and be challenging to optimize. In this work, we\ndemonstrate that a frozen LLM can be augmented with an offline coprocessor that\noperates on the model's key-value (kv) cache. This coprocessor augments the\ncache with a set of latent embeddings designed to improve the fidelity of\nsubsequent decoding. We train this coprocessor using the language modeling loss\nfrom the decoder on standard pretraining data, while keeping the decoder itself\nfrozen. This approach enables the model to learn, in an end-to-end\ndifferentiable fashion, how to distill additional computation into its\nkv-cache. Because the decoder remains unchanged, the coprocessor can operate\noffline and asynchronously, and the language model can function normally if the\ncoprocessor is unavailable or if a given cache is deemed not to require extra\ncomputation.

The key problem is that data plane\nperformance is slow, and scaled instances remain stopped while parameters are\nloading.

Second,\nautoscaling can be made live by breaking the scaling abstraction from a\ncoarse-grained instance-level to a fine-grained layer-level.

However, current FSDMC research often\nlacks generalizability due to its focus on specific datasets. Additionally,\ndefect classification heavily relies on contextual information within images,\nand existing methods fall short of effectively extracting this information. To\naddress these challenges, we propose a general FSDMC framework called MVREC,\nwhich offers two primary advantages: (1) MVREC extracts general features for\ndefect instances by incorporating the pre-trained AlphaCLIP model. (2) It\nutilizes a region-context framework to enhance defect features by leveraging\nmask region input and multi-view context augmentation. Furthermore, Few-shot\nZip-Adapter(-F) classifiers within the model are introduced to cache the visual\nfeatures of the support set and perform few-shot classification. We also\nintroduce MVTec-FS, a new FSDMC benchmark based on MVTec AD, which includes\n1228 defect images with instance-level mask annotations and 46 defect types.\nExtensive experiments conducted on MVTec-FS and four additional datasets\ndemonstrate its effectiveness in general defect classification and its ability\nto incorporate contextual information to improve classification performance.\nCode: https://github.com/ShuaiLYU/MVREC",

Our development process encompasses\ncomprehensive pre-training, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and reinforcement\nlearning from human feedback (RLHF), where we devise deliberate strategies for\nmulti-stage training, synthetic data construction, and reward modeling.\nFurthermore, we implement RAISE (Responsible AI Safety Engine), a\nfour-component framework to address safety issues across pre-training,\npost-training, and serving phases. Empowered by our scalable super-computing\ninfrastructure, all these innovations substantially reduce training, deployment\nand inference costs while maintaining high-performance standards. With further\nevaluations on public academic benchmarks, Yi-Lightning demonstrates\ncompetitive performance against top-tier LLMs, while we observe a notable\ndisparity between traditional, static benchmark results and real-world, dynamic\nhuman preferences.

                "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed in applications\nsuch as chatbots, code editors, and conversational agents. A key feature of\nLLMs is their ability to engage in multi-turn interactions with humans or\nexternal tools, enabling a wide range of tasks. Each new request in a\nmulti-turn interaction depends on the intermediate state, specifically the\nkey-value (K,V) caches, from previous requests in the ongoing interaction.\nExisting serving engines either recompute the K,V caches or offload them to\nmain memory.

Then we select\nimportant tokens based on their normalized attention scores and perform sparse\nattention mechanism solely on those important tokens, reducing the latency in\nthe prefill phase. Tokens deemed less important will be discarded to reduce KV\ncache size, alleviating the memory bottleneck in the decoding phase.

To address these issues, we develop Vivar, a\nnovel AR system that integrates multi-modal sensor data and presents 3D\nvolumetric content for visualization. In particular, we introduce a cross-modal\nembedding approach that maps sensor data into a pre-trained visual embedding\nspace through barycentric interpolation.

Vivar also\nincorporates sensor-aware AR scene generation using foundation models and 3D\nGaussian Splatting (3DGS) without requiring domain expertise. In addition,\nVivar leverages latent reuse and caching strategies to accelerate 2D and AR\ncontent generation. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our system\nachieves 11$\\times$ latency reduction without compromising quality.

To address this gap, we propose Mixture-of-Denoising\nExperts (MoDE) as a novel policy for Imitation Learning.

MoDE achieves state-of-the-art performance on\n134 tasks in four established imitation learning benchmarks (CALVIN and\nLIBERO). Notably, by pretraining MoDE on diverse robotics data, we achieve 4.01\non CALVIN ABC and 0.95 on LIBERO-90. It surpasses both CNN-based and\nTransformer Diffusion Policies by an average of 57% across 4 benchmarks, while\nusing 90% fewer FLOPs and fewer active parameters compared to default Diffusion\nTransformer architectures.

Traditional metrics, such as CLIP text and\nimage scores, often fall short: text scores are limited by inadequate training\ndata and hierarchical dependencies, while image scores fail to assess temporal\nconsistency. We present SST-EM (Semantic, Spatial, and Temporal Evaluation\nMetric), a novel evaluation framework that leverages modern Vision-Language\nModels (VLMs), Object Detection, and Temporal Consistency checks. SST-EM\ncomprises four components: (1) semantic extraction from frames using a VLM, (2)\nprimary object tracking with Object Detection, (3) focused object refinement\nvia an LLM agent, and (4) temporal consistency assessment using a Vision\nTransformer (ViT). These components are integrated into a unified metric with\nweights derived from human evaluations and regression analysis. The name SST-EM\nreflects its focus on Semantic, Spatial, and Temporal aspects of video\nevaluation. SST-EM provides a comprehensive evaluation of semantic fidelity and\ntemporal smoothness in video editing.

Traditional metrics, such as CLIP text and\nimage scores, often fall short: text scores are limited by inadequate training\ndata and hierarchical dependencies, while image scores fail to assess temporal\nconsistency. We present SST-EM (Semantic, Spatial, and Temporal Evaluation\nMetric), a novel evaluation framework that leverages modern Vision-Language\nModels (VLMs), Object Detection, and Temporal Consistency checks. SST-EM\ncomprises four components: (1) semantic extraction from frames using a VLM, (2)\nprimary object tracking with Object Detection, (3) focused object refinement\nvia an LLM agent, and (4) temporal consistency assessment using a Vision\nTransformer (ViT). These components are integrated into a unified metric with\nweights derived from human evaluations and regression analysis. The name SST-EM\nreflects its focus on Semantic, Spatial, and Temporal aspects of video\nevaluation. SST-EM provides a comprehensive evaluation of semantic fidelity and\ntemporal smoothness in video editing.

With noisy sequencing data\nthere may be uncertainty in the inferred tree structure, while we may also wish\nto study patterns in the evolution of cancers in different patients. In such\nsituations, understanding tree similarities is a key challenge, and therefore\nwe present an approach to determine distances between trees. Considering the\nbounded height of trees, we determine the distances associated with the swap\noperations over strings.

Most existing studies\nhave focused on converting user behavior logs into textual prompts and\nleveraging techniques such as prompt tuning to enable LLMs for recommendation\ntasks. Meanwhile, research interest has recently grown in multimodal\nrecommendation systems that integrate data from images, text, and other sources\nusing modality fusion techniques. This introduces new challenges to the\nexisting LLM-based recommendation paradigm which relies solely on text modality\ninformation. Moreover, although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)\ncapable of processing multi-modal inputs have emerged, how to equip MLLMs with\nmulti-modal recommendation capabilities remains largely unexplored. To this\nend, in this paper, we propose the Multimodal Large Language Model-enhanced\nMultimodaln Sequential Recommendation (MLLM-MSR) model. To capture the dynamic\nuser preference, we design a two-stage user preference summarization method.\nSpecifically, we first utilize an MLLM-based item-summarizer to extract image\nfeature given an item and convert the image into text. Then, we employ a\nrecurrent user preference summarization generation paradigm to capture the\ndynamic changes in user preferences based on an LLM-based user-summarizer.\nFinally, to enable the MLLM for multi-modal recommendation task, we propose to\nfine-tune a MLLM-based recommender using Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)\ntechniques. Extensive evaluations across various datasets validate the\neffectiveness of MLLM-MSR, showcasing its superior ability to capture and adapt\nto the evolving dynamics of user preferences.",

CLIP, one of the most popular VLMs, has exhibited\nremarkable zero-shot and transfer learning capabilities in classification. To\ntransfer CLIP to downstream tasks, adapters constitute a parameter-efficient\napproach that avoids backpropagation through the large model (unlike related\nprompt learning methods). However, CLIP adapters have been developed to target\ndiscriminative performance, and the quality of their uncertainty estimates has\nbeen overlooked. In this work we show that the discriminative performance of\nstate-of-the-art CLIP adapters does not always correlate with their uncertainty\nestimation capabilities, which are essential for a safe deployment in\nreal-world scenarios. We also demonstrate that one of such adapters is obtained\nthrough MAP inference from a more general probabilistic framework. Based on\nthis observation we introduce BayesAdapter, which leverages Bayesian inference\nto estimate a full probability distribution instead of a single point, better\ncapturing the variability inherent in the parameter space. In a comprehensive\nempirical evaluation we show that our approach obtains high quality uncertainty\nestimates in the predictions, standing out in calibration and selective\nclassification. Our code will be publicly available upon acceptance of the\npaper.",

To bridge the gap\nbetween DrLLM and existing approaches, we embed the global and local\ninformation of the traffic data into the reasoning paradigm and design three\nmodules, namely Knowledge Embedding, Token Embedding, and Progressive Role\nReasoning, for data representation and reasoning. In addition we explore the\ngeneralization of prompt engineering in the cybersecurity domain to improve the\nclassification capability of DrLLM. Our ablation experiments demonstrate the\napplicability of DrLLM in zero-shot scenarios and further demonstrate the\npotential of LLMs in the network domains. DrLLM implementation code has been\nopen-sourced at https://github.com/liuup/DrLLM."

Previous research has demonstrated that a sparse representation of\nhuman touch can effectively convey social tactile signals. However, advances in\nhuman-robot tactile interaction remain limited, as many humanoid robots possess\nsimplistic capabilities, such as only opening and closing their hands,\nrestricting nuanced tactile expressions. In this study, we explore how a robot\ncan use sparse representations of tactile vibrations to convey emotions to a\nperson. To achieve this, we developed a wearable sleeve integrated with a 5x5\ngrid of vibration motors, enabling the robot to communicate diverse tactile\nemotions and gestures. Using chain prompts within a Large Language Model (LLM),\nwe generated distinct 10-second vibration patterns corresponding to 10 emotions\n(e.g., happiness, sadness, fear) and 6 touch gestures (e.g., pat, rub, tap).\nParticipants (N = 32) then rated each vibration stimulus based on perceived\nvalence and arousal. People are accurate at recognising intended emotions, a\nresult which aligns with earlier findings. These results highlight the LLM's\nability to generate emotional haptic data and effectively convey emotions\nthrough tactile signals. By translating complex emotional and tactile\nexpressions into vibratory patterns, this research demonstrates how LLMs can\nenhance physical interaction between humans and robots.",

Secondly, conflicts often emerge between\nmultiple objectives, like enhancing accuracy versus exploring diverse\nrecommendations. Existing strategies, trapped in a \"training, evaluation, and\nretraining\" loop, grow more labor-intensive as objectives evolve. To address\nthese challenges, we introduce a future-conditioned strategy for\nmulti-objective controllable recommendations, allowing for the direct\nspecification of future objectives and empowering the model to generate item\nsequences that align with these goals autoregressively. We present the\nMulti-Objective Controllable Decision Transformer (MocDT), an offline\nReinforcement Learning (RL) model capable of autonomously learning the mapping\nfrom multiple objectives to item sequences, leveraging extensive offline data.\nConsequently, it can produce recommendations tailored to any specified\nobjectives during the inference stage. Our empirical findings emphasize the\ncontrollable recommendation strategy's ability to produce item sequences\naccording to different objectives while maintaining performance that is\ncompetitive with current recommendation strategies across various objectives.",

Secondly, conflicts often emerge between\nmultiple objectives, like enhancing accuracy versus exploring diverse\nrecommendations. Existing strategies, trapped in a \"training, evaluation, and\nretraining\" loop, grow more labor-intensive as objectives evolve. To address\nthese challenges, we introduce a future-conditioned strategy for\nmulti-objective controllable recommendations, allowing for the direct\nspecification of future objectives and empowering the model to generate item\nsequences that align with these goals autoregressively. We present the\nMulti-Objective Controllable Decision Transformer (MocDT), an offline\nReinforcement Learning (RL) model capable of autonomously learning the mapping\nfrom multiple objectives to item sequences, leveraging extensive offline data.\nConsequently, it can produce recommendations tailored to any specified\nobjectives during the inference stage. Our empirical findings emphasize the\ncontrollable recommendation strategy's ability to produce item sequences\naccording to different objectives while maintaining performance that is\ncompetitive with current recommendation strategies across various objectives."

Our framework employs both text and image encoders\nduring training and inference, along with instructions meticulously designed\nbased on text attributes. This approach enables the model to interpret text\nmore accurately and flexibly. Extensive experiments demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our model and we achieve state-of-the-art results on widely\nused benchmarks. Furthermore, the proposed framework can be seamlessly applied\nto scene text VQA tasks. By leveraging instruction strategies during\npre-training, the performance on downstream VQA tasks can be significantly\nimproved, with a 2.6% increase on the TextVQA dataset and a 2.1% increase on\nthe ST-VQA dataset.

To further suppress potential\ndivergence, a reliability evaluator is devised to infer estimation errors.

Performing these operations at the individual operator level\ncauses significant runtime delays. To address these issues, we propose\nQuantuneV2, a compiler-based mixed-precision quantization method designed for\npractical embedded AI applications. QuantuneV2 performs inference only twice,\nonce before quantization and once after quantization, and operates with a\ncomputational complexity of O(n) that increases linearly with the number of\nmodel parameters. We also made the sensitivity analysis more stable by using\nlocal metrics like weights, activation values, the Signal to Quantization Noise\nRatio, and the Mean Squared Error. We also cut down on computational overhead\nby choosing the best IR and using operator fusion. Experimental results show\nthat QuantuneV2 achieved up to a 10.28 percent improvement in accuracy and a\n12.52 percent increase in speed compared to existing methods across five\nmodels: ResNet18v1, ResNet50v1, SqueezeNetv1, VGGNet, and MobileNetv2.

In particular, LLaMA3 models have recently been released\nand have achieved impressive performance in various domains with super-large\nscale pre-training on over 15T tokens of data. Given the wide application of\nlow-bit quantization for LLMs in resource-constrained scenarios, we explore\nLLaMA3's capabilities when quantized to low bit-width. This exploration can\npotentially provide new insights and challenges for the low-bit quantization of\nLLaMA3 and other future LLMs, especially in addressing performance degradation\nissues that suffer in LLM compression. Specifically, we comprehensively\nevaluate the 10 existing post-training quantization and LoRA fine-tuning\n(LoRA-FT) methods of LLaMA3 on 1-8 bits and various datasets to reveal the\nlow-bit quantization performance of LLaMA3. To uncover the capabilities of\nlow-bit quantized MLLM, we assessed the performance of the LLaMA3-based\nLLaVA-Next-8B model under 2-4 ultra-low bits with post-training quantization\nmethods. Our experimental results indicate that LLaMA3 still suffers from\nnon-negligible degradation in linguistic and visual contexts, particularly\nunder ultra-low bit widths. This highlights the significant performance gap at\nlow bit-width that needs to be addressed in future developments. We expect that\nthis empirical study will prove valuable in advancing future models, driving\nLLMs and MLLMs to achieve higher accuracy at lower bit to enhance practicality.\nOur project is released on https://github.com/Macaronlin/LLaMA3-Quantization ,\nand quantized models are released at https://huggingface.co/Efficient-ML .",

This highlights the significant performance gap at\nlow bit-width that needs to be addressed in future developments. We expect that\nthis empirical study will prove valuable in advancing future models, driving\nLLMs and MLLMs to achieve higher accuracy at lower bit to enhance practicality.\nOur project is released on https://github.com/Macaronlin/LLaMA3-Quantization ,\nand quantized models are released at https://huggingface.co/Efficient-ML ."

However, training such large-scale models usually requires\nsubstantial computation and storage, which poses barriers for general users\nwith consumer-level computers. Motivated by this observation, in this paper we\ninvestigate how to achieve competitive performance on only one Nvidia RTX3090\nGPU and with one terabyte for storing dataset. On one hand, we simplify the\ntransformer block structure and combine Weight Inheritance with multi-stage\nKnowledge Distillation (WIKD), thereby reducing the parameters and improving\nthe inference speed during training along with deployment. On the other hand,\nconfronted with the convergence challenge posed by small dataset, we generate\nsynthetic captions for each sample as data augmentation, and devise a novel\nPair Matching (PM) loss to fully exploit the distinguishment among positive and\nnegative image-text pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model can\nachieve a new state-of-the-art datascale-parameter-accuracy tradeoff, which\ncould further popularize the CLIP model in the related research community.",

However, training such large-scale models usually requires\nsubstantial computation and storage, which poses barriers for general users\nwith consumer-level computers. Motivated by this observation, in this paper we\ninvestigate how to achieve competitive performance on only one Nvidia RTX3090\nGPU and with one terabyte for storing dataset. On one hand, we simplify the\ntransformer block structure and combine Weight Inheritance with multi-stage\nKnowledge Distillation (WIKD), thereby reducing the parameters and improving\nthe inference speed during training along with deployment. On the other hand,\nconfronted with the convergence challenge posed by small dataset, we generate\nsynthetic captions for each sample as data augmentation, and devise a novel\nPair Matching (PM) loss to fully exploit the distinguishment among positive and\nnegative image-text pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model can\nachieve a new state-of-the-art datascale-parameter-accuracy tradeoff, which\ncould further popularize the CLIP model in the related research community."

This evolution requires the transition from\ntraditional Large Language Models (LLMs), which excel at generating textual\nresponses, to Large Action Models (LAMs), designed for action generation and\nexecution within dynamic environments. Enabled by agent systems, LAMs hold the\npotential to transform AI from passive language understanding to active task\ncompletion, marking a significant milestone in the progression toward\nartificial general intelligence.\n  In this paper, we present a comprehensive framework for developing LAMs,\noffering a systematic approach to their creation, from inception to deployment.\nWe begin with an overview of LAMs, highlighting their unique characteristics\nand delineating their differences from LLMs. Using a Windows OS-based agent as\na case study, we provide a detailed, step-by-step guide on the key stages of\nLAM development, including data collection, model training, environment\nintegration, grounding, and evaluation.

                    "value": "As AI continues to advance, there is a growing demand for systems that go\nbeyond language-based assistance and move toward intelligent agents capable of\nperforming real-world actions. This evolution requires the transition from\ntraditional Large Language Models (LLMs), which excel at generating textual\nresponses, to Large Action Models (LAMs), designed for action generation and\nexecution within dynamic environments. Enabled by agent systems, LAMs hold the\npotential to transform AI from passive language understanding to active task\ncompletion, marking a significant milestone in the progression toward\nartificial general intelligence.\n  In this paper, we present a comprehensive framework for developing LAMs,\noffering a systematic approach to their creation, from inception to deployment.\nWe begin with an overview of LAMs, highlighting their unique characteristics\nand delineating their differences from LLMs. Using a Windows OS-based agent as\na case study, we provide a detailed, step-by-step guide on the key stages of\nLAM development, including data collection, model training, environment\nintegration, grounding, and evaluation.

We introduce LLM4Vuln, a unified\nevaluation framework that separates and assesses LLMs' vulnerability reasoning\ncapabilities and examines improvements when combined with other enhancements.\n  We conduct controlled experiments using 147 ground-truth vulnerabilities and\n147 non-vulnerable cases in Solidity, Java and C/C++, testing them in a total\nof 3,528 scenarios across four LLMs (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Phi-3, and Llama 3). Our\nfindings reveal the varying impacts of knowledge enhancement, context\nsupplementation, and prompt schemes. We also identify 14 zero-day\nvulnerabilities in four pilot bug bounty programs, resulting in $3,576 in\nbounties."

To accomplish these tasks,\nthe LLM often uses external data sources such as user documents, web retrieval,\nresults from API calls, etc. This opens up new avenues for attackers to\nmanipulate the LLM via prompt injection. Adversarial prompts can be injected\ninto external data sources to override the system's intended instruction and\ninstead execute a malicious instruction.\n  To mitigate this vulnerability, we propose a new defense called SecAlign\nbased on the technique of preference optimization. Our defense first constructs\na preference dataset with prompt-injected inputs, secure outputs (ones that\nrespond to the legitimate instruction), and insecure outputs (ones that respond\nto the injection). We then perform preference optimization on this dataset to\nteach the LLM to prefer the secure output over the insecure one. This provides\nthe first known method that reduces the success rates of various prompt\ninjections to around 0%, even against attacks much more sophisticated than ones\nseen during training. This indicates our defense generalizes well against\nunknown and yet-to-come attacks. Also, our defended models are still practical\nwith similar utility to the one before our defensive training.

Overall, our paper shows that producing\nN-Version software can be drastically automated by advanced usage of practical\nformal verification and generative language models."

These labels are grouped into\nnine main categories, and we train a DeBERTa-v3 classifier to scale the\nfiltering to a 10B-token subset of FineWeb. To test the impact of our\nfiltering, we train GPT-2 models on both the original and the filtered\ndatasets. The results show that models trained on the filtered data achieve\nhigher accuracy on the HellaSwag benchmark and reach their performance targets\nfaster, even with up to 25\\% less data. This demonstrates that LLM-based\nline-level filtering can significantly improve data quality and training\nefficiency for LLMs. We release our quality-annotated dataset, FinerWeb-10BT,\nand the codebase to support further work in this area.",

Previous research has demonstrated that a sparse representation of\nhuman touch can effectively convey social tactile signals. However, advances in\nhuman-robot tactile interaction remain limited, as many humanoid robots possess\nsimplistic capabilities, such as only opening and closing their hands,\nrestricting nuanced tactile expressions. In this study, we explore how a robot\ncan use sparse representations of tactile vibrations to convey emotions to a\nperson. To achieve this, we developed a wearable sleeve integrated with a 5x5\ngrid of vibration motors, enabling the robot to communicate diverse tactile\nemotions and gestures. Using chain prompts within a Large Language Model (LLM),\nwe generated distinct 10-second vibration patterns corresponding to 10 emotions\n(e.g., happiness, sadness, fear) and 6 touch gestures (e.g., pat, rub, tap).\nParticipants (N = 32) then rated each vibration stimulus based on perceived\nvalence and arousal. People are accurate at recognising intended emotions, a\nresult which aligns with earlier findings. These results highlight the LLM's\nability to generate emotional haptic data and effectively convey emotions\nthrough tactile signals. By translating complex emotional and tactile\nexpressions into vibratory patterns, this research demonstrates how LLMs can\nenhance physical interaction between humans and robots.",

                "summary": "The LLaMA family, a collection of foundation language models ranging from 7B\nto 65B parameters, has become one of the most powerful open-source large\nlanguage models (LLMs) and the popular LLM backbone of multi-modal large\nlanguage models (MLLMs), widely used in computer vision and natural language\nunderstanding tasks. In particular, LLaMA3 models have recently been released\nand have achieved impressive performance in various domains with super-large\nscale pre-training on over 15T tokens of data. Given the wide application of\nlow-bit quantization for LLMs in resource-constrained scenarios, we explore\nLLaMA3's capabilities when quantized to low bit-width. This exploration can\npotentially provide new insights and challenges for the low-bit quantization of\nLLaMA3 and other future LLMs, especially in addressing performance degradation\nissues that suffer in LLM compression. Specifically, we comprehensively\nevaluate the 10 existing post-training quantization and LoRA fine-tuning\n(LoRA-FT) methods of LLaMA3 on 1-8 bits and various datasets to reveal the\nlow-bit quantization performance of LLaMA3. To uncover the capabilities of\nlow-bit quantized MLLM, we assessed the performance of the LLaMA3-based\nLLaVA-Next-8B model under 2-4 ultra-low bits with post-training quantization\nmethods.

                    "value": "The LLaMA family, a collection of foundation language models ranging from 7B\nto 65B parameters, has become one of the most powerful open-source large\nlanguage models (LLMs) and the popular LLM backbone of multi-modal large\nlanguage models (MLLMs), widely used in computer vision and natural language\nunderstanding tasks. In particular, LLaMA3 models have recently been released\nand have achieved impressive performance in various domains with super-large\nscale pre-training on over 15T tokens of data. Given the wide application of\nlow-bit quantization for LLMs in resource-constrained scenarios, we explore\nLLaMA3's capabilities when quantized to low bit-width. This exploration can\npotentially provide new insights and challenges for the low-bit quantization of\nLLaMA3 and other future LLMs, especially in addressing performance degradation\nissues that suffer in LLM compression. Specifically, we comprehensively\nevaluate the 10 existing post-training quantization and LoRA fine-tuning\n(LoRA-FT) methods of LLaMA3 on 1-8 bits and various datasets to reveal the\nlow-bit quantization performance of LLaMA3. To uncover the capabilities of\nlow-bit quantized MLLM, we assessed the performance of the LLaMA3-based\nLLaVA-Next-8B model under 2-4 ultra-low bits with post-training quantization\nmethods. Our experimental results indicate that LLaMA3 still suffers from\nnon-negligible degradation in linguistic and visual contexts, particularly\nunder ultra-low bit widths.

We thus introduce the diagnostic reasoning dataset for\nclinical notes (DiReCT), aiming at evaluating the reasoning ability and\ninterpretability of LLMs compared to human doctors. It contains 511 clinical\nnotes, each meticulously annotated by physicians, detailing the diagnostic\nreasoning process from observations in a clinical note to the final diagnosis.\nAdditionally, a diagnostic knowledge graph is provided to offer essential\nknowledge for reasoning, which may not be covered in the training data of\nexisting LLMs. Evaluations of leading LLMs on DiReCT bring out a significant\ngap between their reasoning ability and that of human doctors, highlighting the\ncritical need for models that can reason effectively in real-world clinical\nscenarios.",

Models like GPT-4 excel in medical question answering but may face\nchallenges in the lack of interpretability when handling complex tasks in real\nclinical settings. We thus introduce the diagnostic reasoning dataset for\nclinical notes (DiReCT), aiming at evaluating the reasoning ability and\ninterpretability of LLMs compared to human doctors. It contains 511 clinical\nnotes, each meticulously annotated by physicians, detailing the diagnostic\nreasoning process from observations in a clinical note to the final diagnosis.\nAdditionally, a diagnostic knowledge graph is provided to offer essential\nknowledge for reasoning, which may not be covered in the training data of\nexisting LLMs. Evaluations of leading LLMs on DiReCT bring out a significant\ngap between their reasoning ability and that of human doctors, highlighting the\ncritical need for models that can reason effectively in real-world clinical\nscenarios."

LLMs are\ncritical for various applications, but they often suffer from hallucinations\nand inaccuracies due to knowledge gaps in the training data. Knowledge graphs\n(KGs), as a powerful structural tool, could serve as a vital external\ninformation source to mitigate the aforementioned issues. By providing a\nstructured and comprehensive understanding of real-world data, KGs enhance the\nperformance and reliability of LLMs. However, it is common that errors exist in\nKGs while extracting triplets from unstructured data to construct KGs.

These image pairs span a broad array of\nvisual domains, including animals, fashion, sports, and both outdoor and indoor\nscenes. The questions are carefully crafted to discern relative characteristics\nbetween two images and are labeled by human annotators for accuracy and\nrelevance.

We show that multi-layered Transformers,\ngiven a sufficiently large set of pre-training instances, are able to learn the\nalgorithms themselves and perform statistical estimation tasks given new\ninstances. This learning paradigm is distinct from the in-context learning\nsetup and is similar to the learning procedure of human brains where skills are\nlearned through past experience. Theoretically, we prove that pre-trained\nTransformers can learn the spectral methods and use the classification of\nbi-class Gaussian mixture model as an example.

                    "value": "Transformers demonstrate significant advantages as the building block of\nmodern LLMs. In this work, we study the capacities of Transformers in\nperforming unsupervised learning. We show that multi-layered Transformers,\ngiven a sufficiently large set of pre-training instances, are able to learn the\nalgorithms themselves and perform statistical estimation tasks given new\ninstances. This learning paradigm is distinct from the in-context learning\nsetup and is similar to the learning procedure of human brains where skills are\nlearned through past experience. Theoretically, we prove that pre-trained\nTransformers can learn the spectral methods and use the classification of\nbi-class Gaussian mixture model as an example.

One such purpose is code migration.\n  This article is an experience report on using LLMs for code migrations at\nGoogle. It is not a research study, in the sense that we do not carry out\ncomparisons against other approaches or evaluate research questions/hypotheses.\nRather, we share our experiences in applying LLM-based code migration in an\nenterprise context across a range of migration cases, in the hope that other\nindustry practitioners will find our insights useful. Many of these learnings\napply to any application of ML in software engineering. We see evidence that\nthe use of LLMs can reduce the time needed for migrations significantly, and\ncan reduce barriers to get started and complete migration programs.",

                    "value": "In recent years, there has been a tremendous interest in using generative AI,\nand particularly large language models (LLMs) in software engineering; indeed\nthere are now several commercially available tools, and many large companies\nalso have created proprietary ML-based tools for their own software engineers.\nWhile the use of ML for common tasks such as code completion is available in\ncommodity tools, there is a growing interest in application of LLMs for more\nbespoke purposes. One such purpose is code migration.\n  This article is an experience report on using LLMs for code migrations at\nGoogle. It is not a research study, in the sense that we do not carry out\ncomparisons against other approaches or evaluate research questions/hypotheses.\nRather, we share our experiences in applying LLM-based code migration in an\nenterprise context across a range of migration cases, in the hope that other\nindustry practitioners will find our insights useful. Many of these learnings\napply to any application of ML in software engineering. We see evidence that\nthe use of LLMs can reduce the time needed for migrations significantly, and\ncan reduce barriers to get started and complete migration programs."

Our findings show that developers primarily evolve prompts through\nadditions and modifications, with most changes occurring during feature\ndevelopment. We identified key challenges in prompt engineering: only 21.9% of\nprompt changes are documented in commit messages, changes can introduce logical\ninconsistencies, and misalignment often occurs between prompt changes and LLM\nresponses. These insights emphasize the need for specialized testing\nframeworks, automated validation tools, and improved documentation practices to\nenhance the reliability of LLM-integrated applications.",

We introduce a hierarchical representation methodology\nthat optimizes the few-shot learning capabilities of LLMs while preserving the\ncomplex relationships and interactions within web applications. The approach\nencompasses five key phases: comprehensive DOM analysis, multi-page synthesis,\ntest suite generation, execution, and result analysis. Our methodology\naddresses existing challenges around usage of Generative AI techniques in\nautomated software testing by developing a structured format that enables LLMs\nto understand web application architecture through in-context learning. We\nevaluated our approach using two distinct web applications: an e-commerce\nplatform (Swag Labs) and a healthcare application (MediBox) which is deployed\nwithin Atalgo engineering environment. The results demonstrate success rates of\n90\\% and 70\\%, respectively, in achieving automated testing, with high\nrelevance scores for test cases across multiple evaluation criteria. The\nfindings suggest that our representation approach significantly enhances LLMs'\nability to generate contextually relevant test cases and provide better quality\nassurance overall, while reducing the time and effort required for testing.",
