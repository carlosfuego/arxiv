It is a challenging\nproblem since (1) Progressive error accumulation from cached blocks\nsignificantly degrades generation quality, particularly when over 50\\% of\nblocks are cached; (2) Current error compensation approaches neglect dynamic\nperturbation patterns during the caching process, leading to suboptimal error\ncorrection. To solve these problems, we propose the Gradient-Optimized Cache\n(GOC) with two key innovations: (1) Cached Gradient Propagation: A gradient\nqueue dynamically computes the gradient differences between cached and\nrecomputed features. These gradients are weighted and propagated to subsequent\nsteps, directly compensating for the approximation errors introduced by\ncaching. (2) Inflection-Aware Optimization: Through statistical analysis of\nfeature variation patterns, we identify critical inflection points where the\ndenoising trajectory changes direction. By aligning gradient updates with these\ndetected phases, we prevent conflicting gradient directions during error\ncorrection. Extensive evaluations on ImageNet demonstrate GOC's superior\ntrade-off between efficiency and quality. With 50\\% cached blocks, GOC achieves\nIS 216.28 (26.3\\% higher) and FID 3.907 (43\\% lower) compared to baseline DiT,\nwhile maintaining identical computational costs. These improvements persist\nacross various cache ratios, demonstrating robust adaptability to different\nacceleration requirements.

With the emergence of matrix units on multicore CPUs, we analyze\nmatrix-based acceleration strategies and tailor an optimal approach for 3D\nhigh-order stencils. We introduce algorithmic optimizations based on SIMD and\nmatrix units to address strided memory accesses, alignment conflicts, and\nredundant accesses. We propose memory optimizations to boost on-package memory\nefficiency, and a novel multi-thread parallelism paradigm to overcome\ndata-sharing challenges caused by the absence of shared data caches. MMStencil\nsustains consistently high hardware utilization across diverse stencil shapes\nand dimensions. Our DMA-based inter-NUMA communication further mitigates NUMA\neffects and MPI limitations in hybrid parallelism. Combining all the\ninnovations, MMStencil outperforms state-of-the-art libraries on Nvidia A100\nGPGPU by up to 2.1x.

Although much\nwork was done in the past to enable the reuse of prefix KV caches across inputs\nfor a single model, how to enable one model to reuse the prefix KV caches of a\ndifferent model remains an open question.\n  We introduce DroidSpeak, the first distributed LLM inference system that\nenables KV cache reuse across distributed nodes running inference of different\nLLMs, so long as the LLMs have the same architecture. We present the first\nstudy that aims at understanding the impact of sharing KV caches across\ndifferent LLMs, and if/when such sharing affects quality.

Moreover, carefully pipelining the layer-wise\nre-computation and the loading of reused KV cache further improves the\ninference performance. Experiments on diverse datasets and model pairs\ndemonstrate that DroidSpeak achieves up to 4x throughput improvement and about\n3.1x faster prefill (time to first token), with negligible loss of quality in\nF1 scores, Rouge-L or code similarity score, compared to the baseline which\ndoes not allow any sharing across models.",

However,\nwe have found that client-side state (e.g., caching) is not only ineffective\nbut also consumes valuable memory resources in the deep learning pipelines. We\nthus propose FalconFS, a DFS optimized for deep learning pipelines with the\nstateless-client architecture. Specifically, instead of performing client-side\npath resolution and caching, FalconFS efficiently resolves paths on the server\nside using hybrid metadata indexing and lazy namespace replication. FalconFS\nalso boosts server concurrency with concurrent request merging and provides\neasy deployment with VFS shortcut. Evaluations against CephFS and Lustre show\nthat FalconFS achieves up to 5.72$\\times$ throughput for small file read/write\nand up to 12.81$\\times$ throughput for deep learning model training.

However,\nwe have found that client-side state (e.g., caching) is not only ineffective\nbut also consumes valuable memory resources in the deep learning pipelines. We\nthus propose FalconFS, a DFS optimized for deep learning pipelines with the\nstateless-client architecture. Specifically, instead of performing client-side\npath resolution and caching, FalconFS efficiently resolves paths on the server\nside using hybrid metadata indexing and lazy namespace replication. FalconFS\nalso boosts server concurrency with concurrent request merging and provides\neasy deployment with VFS shortcut. Evaluations against CephFS and Lustre show\nthat FalconFS achieves up to 5.72$\\times$ throughput for small file read/write\nand up to 12.81$\\times$ throughput for deep learning model training. FalconFS\nhas been running in Huawei autonomous driving system's production environment\nwith 10,000 NPUs for one year."

On the one hand, the low-level key-value (KV) cache working at the\ntoken level is widely adopted, albeit it incurs significant overhead as request\nvolume grows. On the other hand, instruction-level caching, which stores full\ninstruction-response pairs, is expected to play an increasingly crucial role.\nHowever, the high variability in the content and length of instructions make it\nrare for identical instructions to recur within a short time window, presenting\nchallenges for effective caching instruction-response pairs. To address this\nchallenge, we propose InstCache, a predictive caching mechanism for LLM serving\nsystems. Leveraging the capability of LLMs, we can effectively reorder the\nrepresentation space of instruction texts and develop a sufficient level of\nspatial locality. Such spatial locality enables us to predict potential\ninstructions located in a compact region in the space, resulting in an\neffective caching system at runtime. Experimental results demonstrate that\nInstCache achieves a 2.3x higher hit rate compared to the upper bound of\ntraditional caching mechanisms on WildChat dataset and reduces the time per\noutput token of vLLM by up to 42.0% and 50.0% on LMSys and Moss datasets,\nrespectively.",

To validate its effectiveness, we apply cache steering to induce\nchain-of-thought reasoning in small language models. Our approach leverages\nGPT-4o-generated reasoning traces to construct steering vectors that shift\nmodel behavior toward more explicit, multi-step reasoning without fine-tuning\nor prompt modifications. Experimental evaluations on diverse reasoning\nbenchmarks demonstrate that cache steering improves both the qualitative\nstructure of model reasoning and quantitative task performance. Compared to\nprior activation steering techniques that require continuous interventions, our\none-shot cache steering offers substantial advantages in terms of\nhyperparameter stability, inference-time efficiency, and ease of integration,\nmaking it a more robust and practical solution for controlled generation.",

To validate its effectiveness, we apply cache steering to induce\nchain-of-thought reasoning in small language models. Our approach leverages\nGPT-4o-generated reasoning traces to construct steering vectors that shift\nmodel behavior toward more explicit, multi-step reasoning without fine-tuning\nor prompt modifications. Experimental evaluations on diverse reasoning\nbenchmarks demonstrate that cache steering improves both the qualitative\nstructure of model reasoning and quantitative task performance. Compared to\nprior activation steering techniques that require continuous interventions, our\none-shot cache steering offers substantial advantages in terms of\nhyperparameter stability, inference-time efficiency, and ease of integration,\nmaking it a more robust and practical solution for controlled generation."

The task attracted over 50 international teams across all\ntracks. The submitted models were evaluated against gold-standard human\nannotations, and the results, while promising, show that there is still\nsignificant room for improvement in this domain: the best results for the four\npedagogical ability assessment tracks range between macro F1 scores of 58.34\n(for providing guidance) and 71.81 (for mistake identification) on three-class\nproblems, with the best F1 score in the tutor identification track reaching\n96.98 on a 9-class task.

To\naddress this, existing approaches compress KV caches across adjacent layers\nwith highly similar attention patterns. However, these methods often apply a\nfixed compression scheme across all conversations, selecting the same layer\npairs for compression without considering conversation-specific attention\ndynamics. This static strategy overlooks variability in attention pattern\nsimilarity across different conversations, which can lead to noticeable\naccuracy degradation.\n  We present Krul, a multi-turn LLM inference system that enables accurate and\nefficient KV cache restoration. Krul dynamically selects compression strategies\nbased on attention similarity across layer pairs and uses a\nrecomputation-loading pipeline to restore the KV cache. It introduces three key\ninnovations: 1) a preemptive compression strategy selector to preserve critical\ncontext for future conversation turns and selects a customized strategy for the\nconversation; 2) a token-wise heterogeneous attention similarity estimator to\nmitigate the attention similarity computation and storage overhead during model\ngeneration; 3) a bubble-free restoration scheduler to reduce potential bubbles\nbrought by the imbalance of recomputing and loading stream due to compressed KV\ncaches. Empirical evaluations on real-world tasks demonstrate that Krul\nachieves a 1.5x-2.68x reduction in time-to-first-token (TTFT) and a 1.33x-2.35x\nreduction in KV cache storage compared to state-of-the-art methods without\ncompromising generation quality.",

                "summary": "Auto-regressive Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable\nperformance across different domains such as vision and language processing.\nHowever, due to sequential processing through a stack of transformer layers,\nautoregressive decoding faces significant computation/latency challenges,\nparticularly in resource-constrained environments like mobile and edge devices.\nExisting approaches in literature that aim to improve latency via skipping\nlayers have two distinct flavors - 1) Early exit, and 2) Input-agnostic\nheuristics where tokens exit at pre-determined layers irrespective of input\nsequence. Both the above strategies have limitations - the former cannot be\napplied to handle KV Caching necessary for speed-ups in modern framework and\nthe latter does not capture the variation in layer importance across tasks or\nmore generally, across input sequences. To address both limitations, we propose\nFiRST, an algorithm that reduces inference latency by using layer-specific\nrouters to select a subset of transformer layers adaptively for each input\nsequence - the prompt (during the prefill stage) decides which layers will be\nskipped during decoding. FiRST preserves compatibility with KV caching enabling\nfaster inference while being quality-aware. FiRST is model-agnostic and can be\neasily enabled on any pre-trained LLM.

Both the above strategies have limitations - the former cannot be\napplied to handle KV Caching necessary for speed-ups in modern framework and\nthe latter does not capture the variation in layer importance across tasks or\nmore generally, across input sequences. To address both limitations, we propose\nFiRST, an algorithm that reduces inference latency by using layer-specific\nrouters to select a subset of transformer layers adaptively for each input\nsequence - the prompt (during the prefill stage) decides which layers will be\nskipped during decoding. FiRST preserves compatibility with KV caching enabling\nfaster inference while being quality-aware. FiRST is model-agnostic and can be\neasily enabled on any pre-trained LLM.

This paradigm requires\nsingle photons which are entangled into small resource states before being fed\ninto a fusion network.

The realization of a\nsingle reliable deterministic source requires many redundant probabilistic\nsources and a complex optical network for rerouting and retiming probabilistic\noutputs. In this work, we show how optomechanics enables reliable production of\nresources for photonic quantum computing without the redundancy of the\nall-optical approach. This is achieved by using acoustic modes as caches of\nquantum resources, ranging from single-particle states to small entangled\nstates, with on-demand read-out. The advantages of acoustic modes as optical\nquantum memories, compared to other technologies, include their intrinsically\nlong lifetimes and that they are solid state, highly tailorable, and\ninsensitive to electromagnetic noise. We show how the resource states can be\nprepared directly in the acoustic modes using optical controls. This is still\nprobabilistic and heralded, as in the all-optical approach, but the acoustic\nmodes act as a quantum memory which is integrated into the production of the\nstates.

Utilizing late binding\nand model swapping, Torpor can concurrently serve hundreds of inference\nfunctions on a worker node with 4 GPUs, while achieving latency performance\ncomparable to native execution, where each model is cached exclusively on a\nGPU. Pilot deployment in a leading commercial serverless cloud shows that\nTorpor reduces the GPU provisioning cost by 70% and 65% for users and the\nplatform, respectively."

Cache-based surrogates\nuse already calculated simulation results to interpolate or extrapolate further\nsimulation output values. But this approach only pays off if the access time to\nretrieve the needed values is much faster than the actual simulation. While the\nmost existing key-value stores use a Client-Server architecture with dedicated\nstorage nodes, this is not the most suitable architecture for HPC applications.\nInstead, we propose a distributed architecture where the parallel processes\noffer a part of their available memory to build a shared distributed hash table\nbased on MPI.

                    "value": "Surrogate models can play a pivotal role in enhancing performance in\ncontemporary High-Performance Computing applications. Cache-based surrogates\nuse already calculated simulation results to interpolate or extrapolate further\nsimulation output values. But this approach only pays off if the access time to\nretrieve the needed values is much faster than the actual simulation. While the\nmost existing key-value stores use a Client-Server architecture with dedicated\nstorage nodes, this is not the most suitable architecture for HPC applications.\nInstead, we propose a distributed architecture where the parallel processes\noffer a part of their available memory to build a shared distributed hash table\nbased on MPI.

To identify these\nheads efficiently, we design a training-free framework that quantifies\nhead-level visual relevance through targeted response analysis.

Extensive evaluations across mainstream multimodal\nbenchmarks demonstrate that SparseMM achieves superior accuracy-efficiency\ntrade-offs.

Geometric multigrid methods are optimal solvers for many problems that\narise from the discretization of partial differential equations. It has been\nshown that the multigrid solver GMGPolar solves the 2D gyrokinetic Poisson\nequation in linear complexity and with only small memory requirements compared\nto other state-of-the-art solvers. In this paper, we present a completely\nrefactored and object-oriented version of GMGPolar which offers two different\nmatrix-free implementations. Among other things, we leverage the\nSherman-Morrison formula to solve cyclic tridiagonal systems from circular line\nsolvers without additional fill-in and we apply reordering to optimize cache\naccess of circular and radial smoothing operations. With the Give approach,\nmemory requirements are further reduced and speedups of four to seven are\nobtained for usual test cases. For the Take approach, speedups of 16 to 18 can\nbe attained.",

This\nillumination guidance helps the network focus on underexposed regions,\neffectively steering the enhancement process. To further improve the model's\nrepresentational power, a Spatial Pyramid Pooling (SPP) module is incorporated\nto extract multi-scale contextual features, enabling better handling of diverse\nlighting conditions. Additionally, the Swish activation function is employed to\nensure smoother gradient propagation during training. EDNIG is optimized within\na Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework using a composite loss\nfunction that combines adversarial loss, pixel-wise mean squared error (MSE),\nand perceptual loss. Experimental results show that EDNIG achieves competitive\nperformance compared to state-of-the-art methods in quantitative metrics and\nvisual quality, while maintaining lower model complexity, demonstrating its\nsuitability for real-world applications.

Hunyuan-TurboS features an\nadaptive long-short chain-of-thought (CoT) mechanism, dynamically switching\nbetween rapid responses for simple queries and deep \"thinking\" modes for\ncomplex problems, optimizing computational resources. Architecturally, this 56B\nactivated (560B total) parameter model employs 128 layers (Mamba2, Attention,\nFFN) with an innovative AMF/MF block pattern. Faster Mamba2 ensures linear\ncomplexity, Grouped-Query Attention minimizes KV cache, and FFNs use an MoE\nstructure. Pre-trained on 16T high-quality tokens, it supports a 256K context\nlength and is the first industry-deployed large-scale Mamba model. Our\ncomprehensive post-training strategy enhances capabilities via Supervised\nFine-Tuning (3M instructions), a novel Adaptive Long-short CoT Fusion method,\nMulti-round Deliberation Learning for iterative improvement, and a two-stage\nLarge-scale Reinforcement Learning process targeting STEM and general\ninstruction-following. Evaluations show strong performance: overall top 7 rank\non LMSYS Chatbot Arena with a score of 1356, outperforming leading models like\nGemini-2.0-Flash-001 (1352) and o4-mini-2025-04-16 (1345). TurboS also achieves\nan average of 77.9% across 23 automated benchmarks.

Unfortunately, these\napproaches require the use of fixed hyperparameters, limiting their\nadaptability and overall performance. In this work, we introduce First-Order\nAdaptive Caching, which precomputes not only select matrix operations but also\ntheir sensitivities to hyperparameter variations, enabling online\nhyperparameter updates without full recomputation of the cache. We demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of our approach on a number of dynamic quadrotor tasks,\nachieving up to a 63.4% reduction in ADMM iterations over the use of optimized\nfixed hyperparameters and approaching 70% of the performance of a full cache\nrecomputation, while reducing the computational cost from O(n^3) to O(n^2)\ncomplexity. This performance enables us to perform figure-eight trajectories on\na 27g tiny quadrotor under wind disturbances. We release our implementation\nopen-source for the benefit of the wider robotics community.",

Unfortunately, these\napproaches require the use of fixed hyperparameters, limiting their\nadaptability and overall performance. In this work, we introduce First-Order\nAdaptive Caching, which precomputes not only select matrix operations but also\ntheir sensitivities to hyperparameter variations, enabling online\nhyperparameter updates without full recomputation of the cache. We demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of our approach on a number of dynamic quadrotor tasks,\nachieving up to a 63.4% reduction in ADMM iterations over the use of optimized\nfixed hyperparameters and approaching 70% of the performance of a full cache\nrecomputation, while reducing the computational cost from O(n^3) to O(n^2)\ncomplexity. This performance enables us to perform figure-eight trajectories on\na 27g tiny quadrotor under wind disturbances. We release our implementation\nopen-source for the benefit of the wider robotics community."

To bridge\nthis gap, we introduce a novel block-wise approximate KV Cache mechanism\ntailored for bidirectional diffusion models, enabling cache reuse with\nnegligible performance drop. Additionally, we identify the root cause of\ngeneration quality degradation in parallel decoding as the disruption of token\ndependencies under the conditional independence assumption. To address this, we\npropose a confidence-aware parallel decoding strategy that selectively decodes\ntokens exceeding a confidence threshold, mitigating dependency violations and\nmaintaining generation quality. Experimental results on LLaDA and Dream models\nacross multiple LLM benchmarks demonstrate up to \\textbf{27.6$\\times$\nthroughput} improvement with minimal accuracy loss, closing the performance gap\nwith autoregressive models and paving the way for practical deployment of\nDiffusion LLMs.",

                    "value": "Diffusion-based large language models (Diffusion LLMs) have shown promise for\nnon-autoregressive text generation with parallel decoding capabilities.\nHowever, the practical inference speed of open-sourced Diffusion LLMs often\nlags behind autoregressive models due to the lack of Key-Value (KV) Cache and\nquality degradation when decoding multiple tokens simultaneously. To bridge\nthis gap, we introduce a novel block-wise approximate KV Cache mechanism\ntailored for bidirectional diffusion models, enabling cache reuse with\nnegligible performance drop. Additionally, we identify the root cause of\ngeneration quality degradation in parallel decoding as the disruption of token\ndependencies under the conditional independence assumption. To address this, we\npropose a confidence-aware parallel decoding strategy that selectively decodes\ntokens exceeding a confidence threshold, mitigating dependency violations and\nmaintaining generation quality. Experimental results on LLaDA and Dream models\nacross multiple LLM benchmarks demonstrate up to \\textbf{27.6$\\times$\nthroughput} improvement with minimal accuracy loss, closing the performance gap\nwith autoregressive models and paving the way for practical deployment of\nDiffusion LLMs."

                "summary": "Advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance\nacross a wide range of complex and long-context natural language tasks.\nHowever, performing long-context LLM inference locally on a commodity GPU (a\nPC) with privacy concerns remains challenging due to the increasing memory\ndemands of the key-value (KV) cache. Existing systems typically identify\nimportant tokens and selectively offload their KV data to GPU and CPU memory.\nThe KV data needs to be offloaded to disk due to the limited memory on a\ncommodity GPU, but the process is bottlenecked by token importance evaluation\noverhead and the disk's low bandwidth. In this paper, we present LeoAM, the\nfirst efficient importance-aware long-context LLM inference system for a single\ncommodity GPU with adaptive hierarchical GPU-CPU-Disk KV management. Our system\nemploys an adaptive KV management strategy that partitions KV data into\nvariable-sized chunks based on the skewed distribution of attention weights\nacross different layers to reduce computational and additional transmission\noverheads.

                    "value": "Advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance\nacross a wide range of complex and long-context natural language tasks.\nHowever, performing long-context LLM inference locally on a commodity GPU (a\nPC) with privacy concerns remains challenging due to the increasing memory\ndemands of the key-value (KV) cache. Existing systems typically identify\nimportant tokens and selectively offload their KV data to GPU and CPU memory.\nThe KV data needs to be offloaded to disk due to the limited memory on a\ncommodity GPU, but the process is bottlenecked by token importance evaluation\noverhead and the disk's low bandwidth. In this paper, we present LeoAM, the\nfirst efficient importance-aware long-context LLM inference system for a single\ncommodity GPU with adaptive hierarchical GPU-CPU-Disk KV management. Our system\nemploys an adaptive KV management strategy that partitions KV data into\nvariable-sized chunks based on the skewed distribution of attention weights\nacross different layers to reduce computational and additional transmission\noverheads. Moreover, we propose a lightweight KV abstract method, which\nminimizes transmission latency by storing and extracting the KV abstract of\neach chunk on disk instead of the full KV data. LeoAM also leverages the\ndynamic compression and pipeline techniques to further accelerate inference.\nExperimental results demonstrate that LongInfer achieves an average inference\nlatency speedup of 3.46x, while maintaining comparable LLM response quality.

Despite notable\nadvances with recent efforts, current techniques still lag behind human\ncapabilities in handling drastic visual variations, occlusions, and complex\nscene changes. This limitation arises from their reliance on appearance\nmatching, neglecting the human-like conceptual understanding of objects that\nenables robust identification across temporal dynamics. Motivated by this gap,\nwe propose Segment Concept (SeC), a concept-driven segmentation framework that\nshifts from conventional feature matching to the progressive construction and\nutilization of high-level, object-centric representations. SeC employs Large\nVision-Language Models (LVLMs) to integrate visual cues across diverse frames,\nconstructing robust conceptual priors. During inference, SeC forms a\ncomprehensive semantic representation of the target based on processed frames,\nrealizing robust segmentation of follow-up frames. Furthermore, SeC adaptively\nbalances LVLM-based semantic reasoning with enhanced feature matching,\ndynamically adjusting computational efforts based on scene complexity. To\nrigorously assess VOS methods in scenarios demanding high-level conceptual\nreasoning and robust semantic understanding, we introduce the Semantic Complex\nScenarios Video Object Segmentation benchmark (SeCVOS). SeCVOS comprises 160\nmanually annotated multi-scenario videos designed to challenge models with\nsubstantial appearance variations and dynamic scene transformations. In\nparticular, SeC achieves an 11.8-point improvement over SAM 2.1 on SeCVOS,\nestablishing a new state-of-the-art in concept-aware video object segmentation.",

                "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently been extended to the video domain,\nenabling sophisticated video-language understanding. However, existing Video\nLLMs often exhibit limitations in fine-grained temporal reasoning, restricting\ntheir ability to precisely attribute responses to specific video moments,\nespecially under constrained supervision. We introduce DaMO, a data-efficient\nVideo LLM explicitly designed for accurate temporal reasoning and multimodal\nunderstanding. At its core, the proposed Temporal-aware Fuseformer employs a\nhierarchical dual-stream architecture that progressively captures temporal\ndynamics within each modality and effectively fuses complementary visual and\naudio information. To further enhance computational efficiency, DaMO integrates\na global residual that reduces spatial redundancy while preserving essential\nsemantic details.

                    "value": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently been extended to the video domain,\nenabling sophisticated video-language understanding. However, existing Video\nLLMs often exhibit limitations in fine-grained temporal reasoning, restricting\ntheir ability to precisely attribute responses to specific video moments,\nespecially under constrained supervision. We introduce DaMO, a data-efficient\nVideo LLM explicitly designed for accurate temporal reasoning and multimodal\nunderstanding. At its core, the proposed Temporal-aware Fuseformer employs a\nhierarchical dual-stream architecture that progressively captures temporal\ndynamics within each modality and effectively fuses complementary visual and\naudio information. To further enhance computational efficiency, DaMO integrates\na global residual that reduces spatial redundancy while preserving essential\nsemantic details.

To address this gap, we present GasAgent,\nthe first multi-agent system for smart contract Gas optimization that combines\ncompatibility with existing patterns and automated discovery/validation of new\npatterns, enabling end-to-end optimization. GasAgent consists of four\nspecialized agents, Seeker, Innovator, Executor, and Manager, that collaborate\nin a closed loop to identify, validate, and apply Gas-saving improvements.\nExperiments on 100 verified real-world contracts demonstrate that GasAgent\nsuccessfully optimizes 82 contracts, achieving an average deployment Gas\nsavings of 9.97%. In addition, our evaluation confirms its compatibility with\nexisting tools and validates the effectiveness of each module through ablation\nstudies. To assess broader usability, we further evaluate 500 contracts\ngenerated by five representative LLMs across 10 categories and find that\nGasAgent optimizes 79.8% of them, with deployment Gas savings ranging from\n4.79% to 13.93%, showing its usability as the optimization layer for\nLLM-assisted smart contract development.",

To address this gap, we present GasAgent,\nthe first multi-agent system for smart contract Gas optimization that combines\ncompatibility with existing patterns and automated discovery/validation of new\npatterns, enabling end-to-end optimization. GasAgent consists of four\nspecialized agents, Seeker, Innovator, Executor, and Manager, that collaborate\nin a closed loop to identify, validate, and apply Gas-saving improvements.\nExperiments on 100 verified real-world contracts demonstrate that GasAgent\nsuccessfully optimizes 82 contracts, achieving an average deployment Gas\nsavings of 9.97%. In addition, our evaluation confirms its compatibility with\nexisting tools and validates the effectiveness of each module through ablation\nstudies. To assess broader usability, we further evaluate 500 contracts\ngenerated by five representative LLMs across 10 categories and find that\nGasAgent optimizes 79.8% of them, with deployment Gas savings ranging from\n4.79% to 13.93%, showing its usability as the optimization layer for\nLLM-assisted smart contract development."

In particular, we design a self-supervised\nlightweight backbone that provides features to efficient task-specific heads.\nThe latter can be developed independently and with reduced data labeling\nrequirements thanks to the frozen backbone. Experiments on three sample tasks\nof cloud segmentation, flood detection, and marine debris classification on a\n7W embedded system show competitive results with inference quality close to\nhigh-complexity state-of-the-art models and high throughput in excess of 8\nMpx/s."

Finally, during inference,\nan adaptive FIFO-Diffusion strategy seamlessly connects adjacent clips,\nreducing boundary artifacts and enhancing smooth transitions. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances long-term temporal\nand content coherence without incurring prohibitive computational overhead.

We introduce\nBELO (BEnchmarking LLMs for Ophthalmology), a standardized and comprehensive\nevaluation benchmark developed through multiple rounds of expert checking by 13\nophthalmologists. BELO assesses ophthalmology-related clinical accuracy and\nreasoning quality. Using keyword matching and a fine-tuned PubMedBERT model, we\ncurated ophthalmology-specific multiple-choice-questions (MCQs) from diverse\nmedical datasets (BCSC, MedMCQA, MedQA, BioASQ, and PubMedQA). The dataset\nunderwent multiple rounds of expert checking. Duplicate and substandard\nquestions were systematically removed. Ten ophthalmologists refined the\nexplanations of each MCQ's correct answer. This was further adjudicated by\nthree senior ophthalmologists. To illustrate BELO's utility, we evaluated six\nLLMs (OpenAI o1, o3-mini, GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, Llama-3-8B, and Gemini 1.5 Pro)\nusing accuracy, macro-F1, and five text-generation metrics (ROUGE-L, BERTScore,\nBARTScore, METEOR, and AlignScore). In a further evaluation involving human\nexperts, two ophthalmologists qualitatively reviewed 50 randomly selected\noutputs for accuracy, comprehensiveness, and completeness. BELO consists of 900\nhigh-quality, expert-reviewed questions aggregated from five sources: BCSC\n(260), BioASQ (10), MedMCQA (572), MedQA (40), and PubMedQA (18). A public\nleaderboard has been established to promote transparent evaluation and\nreporting. Importantly, the BELO dataset will remain a hold-out,\nevaluation-only benchmark to ensure fair and reproducible comparisons of future\nmodels.",

Ten ophthalmologists refined the\nexplanations of each MCQ's correct answer. This was further adjudicated by\nthree senior ophthalmologists. To illustrate BELO's utility, we evaluated six\nLLMs (OpenAI o1, o3-mini, GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, Llama-3-8B, and Gemini 1.5 Pro)\nusing accuracy, macro-F1, and five text-generation metrics (ROUGE-L, BERTScore,\nBARTScore, METEOR, and AlignScore). In a further evaluation involving human\nexperts, two ophthalmologists qualitatively reviewed 50 randomly selected\noutputs for accuracy, comprehensiveness, and completeness. BELO consists of 900\nhigh-quality, expert-reviewed questions aggregated from five sources: BCSC\n(260), BioASQ (10), MedMCQA (572), MedQA (40), and PubMedQA (18). A public\nleaderboard has been established to promote transparent evaluation and\nreporting. Importantly, the BELO dataset will remain a hold-out,\nevaluation-only benchmark to ensure fair and reproducible comparisons of future\nmodels."

The standard assumption of ionization equilibrium invoked in\nabsorption line analyses requires gas to cool on longer timescales than ionic\nrecombination (t_cool >> t_rec). However, this assumption may not be valid at\nhigh metallicities due to enhanced cooling losses. This work presents a suite\nof time-dependent photoionization (TDP) models that self-consistently solve for\nthe ionization state of rapidly cooling gas irradiated by the extragalactic\nultraviolet background (UVB). The updated framework explores various revised\nUVBs from recent studies, a range of initial temperatures, and different\nelemental abundance patterns to quantify the effects of TDP on the observed ion\nfractions. A metal-enriched ($\\mathrm{[\\alpha/H]}=0.6_{-0.1}^{+0.2}$) C IV\nabsorption system at z ~ 1 previously studied using photoionization equilibrium\n(PIE) models is re-examined under the TDP framework. The main findings are as\nfollows: (1) varying prescriptions for the underlying UVB or adopting initial\ntemperatures T_0 < 1e6 K (with the starting ionization state in collisional\nequilibrium) change TDP ion fractions by up to a factor of three and ten\nrespectively, but the adopted relative elemental abundance pattern affects ion\nfractions by at most 40%; (2) the inferred gas densities are consistent between\nPIE and TDP, but under TDP solar metallicity cannot be ruled out at more than\n2-$\\sigma$ significance and a non-solar [C/$\\alpha$]$\\approx 0.25$ is robustly\nconstrained from the observed relative ion abundances. Extending the TDP\nanalyses to a larger sample of super-solar absorption components with high\nsignal-to-noise absorption spectra is needed to quantify the fraction of metal\nabsorbers originating in rapid cooling gas.",

However, due to the limitation of encoding time\nand decoder size, current INR based methods only consider lossy geometry\ncompression. In this paper, we propose the first INR based lossless point cloud\ngeometry compression method called Lossless Implicit Neural Representations for\nPoint Cloud Geometry Compression (LINR-PCGC). To accelerate encoding speed, we\ndesign a group of point clouds level coding framework with an effective network\ninitialization strategy, which can reduce around 60% encoding time. A\nlightweight coding network based on multiscale SparseConv, consisting of scale\ncontext extraction, child node prediction, and model compression modules, is\nproposed to realize fast inference and compact decoder size. Experimental\nresults show that our method consistently outperforms traditional and AI-based\nmethods: for example, with the convergence time in the MVUB dataset, our method\nreduces the bitstream by approximately 21.21% compared to G-PCC TMC13v23 and\n21.95% compared to SparsePCGC.

However, due to the limitation of encoding time\nand decoder size, current INR based methods only consider lossy geometry\ncompression. In this paper, we propose the first INR based lossless point cloud\ngeometry compression method called Lossless Implicit Neural Representations for\nPoint Cloud Geometry Compression (LINR-PCGC). To accelerate encoding speed, we\ndesign a group of point clouds level coding framework with an effective network\ninitialization strategy, which can reduce around 60% encoding time. A\nlightweight coding network based on multiscale SparseConv, consisting of scale\ncontext extraction, child node prediction, and model compression modules, is\nproposed to realize fast inference and compact decoder size. Experimental\nresults show that our method consistently outperforms traditional and AI-based\nmethods: for example, with the convergence time in the MVUB dataset, our method\nreduces the bitstream by approximately 21.21% compared to G-PCC TMC13v23 and\n21.95% compared to SparsePCGC. Our project can be seen on\nhttps://huangwenjie2023.github.io/LINR-PCGC/."

                "summary": "We present the JWST/NIRSpec G395H transmission spectrum of the young (10 - 20\nMyr old) transiting planet V1298 Tau b (9.85+/-0.35 Re, Teq=670K). Combined HST\nand JWST observations reveal a haze free, H/He dominated atmosphere with a\nlarge scale height (~1500km), allowing detection of CO2 (35 sigma), H2O (30\nsigma), CO (10 sigma), CH4 (6 sigma), SO2 (4 sigma) and OCS (3.5 sigma). Our\nobservations probe several scale heights (~4.4 in the CO2 4.3 microns and ~3 in\nthe 2.7 micron water band). The planet's mass, inferred from atmospheric scale\nheight using free retrieval and grid modelling is 12+/-1 and 15+/-1.7Me\nrespectively which is significantly lower than previous radial velocity\nestimates and confirm it as a 'gas-dwarf' sub-Neptune progenitor. We find an\natmospheric super-solar metallicity (logZ=0.6^+0.4_-0.6 x solar) and a\nsub-solar C/O ratio (0.22^+0.06_-0.05). The atmospheric metallicity is low\ncompared to matured sub-Neptunes by an order of magnitude. The CH4 abundance\n([CH4]=-6.2^+0.3_-0.5) is ~7 sigma lower than equilibrium chemistry prediction.\nTo adjust for the low methane abundance, the self-consistent grids favour a\nhigh internal temperature (~500K) and vertical mixing (Kzz ~10^7-10^8 cm2/s).\nThese internal temperatures are inconsistent with predictions from evolutionary\nmodels, which expect ~100 - 200K at the current system age.

Combined HST\nand JWST observations reveal a haze free, H/He dominated atmosphere with a\nlarge scale height (~1500km), allowing detection of CO2 (35 sigma), H2O (30\nsigma), CO (10 sigma), CH4 (6 sigma), SO2 (4 sigma) and OCS (3.5 sigma). Our\nobservations probe several scale heights (~4.4 in the CO2 4.3 microns and ~3 in\nthe 2.7 micron water band). The planet's mass, inferred from atmospheric scale\nheight using free retrieval and grid modelling is 12+/-1 and 15+/-1.7Me\nrespectively which is significantly lower than previous radial velocity\nestimates and confirm it as a 'gas-dwarf' sub-Neptune progenitor. We find an\natmospheric super-solar metallicity (logZ=0.6^+0.4_-0.6 x solar) and a\nsub-solar C/O ratio (0.22^+0.06_-0.05). The atmospheric metallicity is low\ncompared to matured sub-Neptunes by an order of magnitude. The CH4 abundance\n([CH4]=-6.2^+0.3_-0.5) is ~7 sigma lower than equilibrium chemistry prediction.\nTo adjust for the low methane abundance, the self-consistent grids favour a\nhigh internal temperature (~500K) and vertical mixing (Kzz ~10^7-10^8 cm2/s).\nThese internal temperatures are inconsistent with predictions from evolutionary\nmodels, which expect ~100 - 200K at the current system age. We estimate a\ngas-to-core mass fraction between 0.1 - 8 %, with a core mass of 11 - 12 Me,\nconsistent with in-situ gas dwarf formation. A deep atmospheric metallicity\ngradient may explain both the high internal temperature and low observable\nmetallicity.

Additionally, larger model\nparameters do not necessarily yield better tokenization quality or enhanced\nresults, highlighting the importance of tailored tokenization strategies that\nprioritize linguistic alignment. This framework sets a new standard for\ndeveloping robust tokenization methods optimized for morphologically complex\nand low-resource languages. Future work will refine morphological analysis,\nexplore domain-specific customizations, and conduct cross-linguistic\nevaluations to further enhance tokenization practices."

In\nparticular, we show that it enables identification and inference for a broad\nclass of counterfactual functionals characterized by moment equations. This\nincludes, for example, inference on quantile treatment effects.

IV methods have been extensively developed in recent years and\napplied across diverse domains, from economics to epidemiology. In this work,\nwe study the recently introduced multiplicative IV (MIV) model and demonstrate\nits utility for causal inference beyond the average treatment effect. In\nparticular, we show that it enables identification and inference for a broad\nclass of counterfactual functionals characterized by moment equations. This\nincludes, for example, inference on quantile treatment effects. We develop\nmethods for efficient and multiply robust estimation of such functionals, and\nprovide inference procedures with asymptotic validity. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that the proposed procedure performs well even with moderate sample\nsizes."

                "summary": "Many astronomical questions require deep, wide-field observations at low\nradio frequencies. Phased arrays like LOFAR and SKA-low are designed for this,\nbut have inherently unstable element gains, leading to time, frequency and\ndirection-dependent gain errors. Precise direction-dependent calibration of\nobservations is therefore key to reaching the highest possible dynamic range.\nMany tools for direction-dependent calibration utilise sky and beam models to\ninfer gains. However, these calibration tools struggle with precision\ncalibration for relatively bright (e.g. A-team) sources far from the beam\ncentre. Therefore, the point-spread-function of these sources can potentially\nobscure a faint signal of interest. We show that, and why, the assumption of a\nsmooth gain solution per station fails for realistic radio interferometers, and\nhow this affects gain-calibration results. Subsequently, we introduce an\nimprovement for smooth spectral gain constraints for direction-dependent\ngain-calibration algorithms, in which the level of regularisation is weighted\nby the expected station response to the sky model. We test this method using\ndirection-dependent calibration method DDECal and physically-motivated beam\nmodelling errors for LOFAR-HBA stations.

                    "value": "Many astronomical questions require deep, wide-field observations at low\nradio frequencies. Phased arrays like LOFAR and SKA-low are designed for this,\nbut have inherently unstable element gains, leading to time, frequency and\ndirection-dependent gain errors. Precise direction-dependent calibration of\nobservations is therefore key to reaching the highest possible dynamic range.\nMany tools for direction-dependent calibration utilise sky and beam models to\ninfer gains. However, these calibration tools struggle with precision\ncalibration for relatively bright (e.g. A-team) sources far from the beam\ncentre. Therefore, the point-spread-function of these sources can potentially\nobscure a faint signal of interest. We show that, and why, the assumption of a\nsmooth gain solution per station fails for realistic radio interferometers, and\nhow this affects gain-calibration results. Subsequently, we introduce an\nimprovement for smooth spectral gain constraints for direction-dependent\ngain-calibration algorithms, in which the level of regularisation is weighted\nby the expected station response to the sky model. We test this method using\ndirection-dependent calibration method DDECal and physically-motivated beam\nmodelling errors for LOFAR-HBA stations. The new method outperforms the\nstandard method for various calibration settings near nulls in the beam, and\nmatches the standard inverse-variance-weighted method's performance for the\nremainder of the data.

However, these\nmethods fail to capture the real human experience, and they cannot draw direct\nconclusions about the system's overall performance. As conversational\nrecommender systems become increasingly vital in e-commerce, social media, and\ncustomer support, the ability to evaluate both recommendation accuracy and\ndialogue management quality using a single metric, thereby authentically\nreflecting user experience, has become the principal challenge impeding\nprogress in this field.\n  In this work, we propose a user-centric evaluation framework based on large\nlanguage models (LLMs) for CRSs, namely Conversational Recommendation Evaluator\n(CoRE). CoRE consists of two main components: (1) LLM-As-Evaluator. Firstly, we\ncomprehensively summarize 12 key factors influencing user experience in CRSs\nand directly leverage LLM as an evaluator to assign a score to each factor. (2)\nMulti-Agent Debater. Secondly, we design a multi-agent debate framework with\nfour distinct roles (common user, domain expert, linguist, and HCI expert) to\ndiscuss and synthesize the 12 evaluation factors into a unified overall\nperformance score.\n  Furthermore, we apply the proposed framework to evaluate four CRSs on two\nbenchmark datasets. The experimental results show that CoRE aligns well with\nhuman evaluation in most of the 12 factors and the overall assessment.\nEspecially, CoRE's overall evaluation scores demonstrate significantly better\nalignment with human feedback compared to existing rule-based metrics.",

The key to ACS is a carefully designed principle\nthat controls the information available for decision making, allowing the data\nanalyst to explore the data adaptively while maintaining rigorous control of\nthe false discovery rate (FDR). Based on the ACS framework, we provide concrete\nselection algorithms for various goals, including model update/selection,\ndiversified selection, and incorporating newly available labeled data.

However, aligning FL with the rest of the\nrequirements of TAI presents a series of challenges, most of which arise from\nits inherently distributed nature. In this work, we adopt the requirements TAI\nas a guiding structure to systematically analyze the challenges of adapting FL\nto TAI. Specifically, we classify and examine the key obstacles to aligning FL\nwith TAI, providing a detailed exploration of what has been done, the trends,\nand the remaining work within each of the identified challenges."

However, existing Video\nLLMs often exhibit limitations in fine-grained temporal reasoning, restricting\ntheir ability to precisely attribute responses to specific video moments,\nespecially under constrained supervision. We introduce DaMO, a data-efficient\nVideo LLM explicitly designed for accurate temporal reasoning and multimodal\nunderstanding. At its core, the proposed Temporal-aware Fuseformer employs a\nhierarchical dual-stream architecture that progressively captures temporal\ndynamics within each modality and effectively fuses complementary visual and\naudio information.

We introduce DaMO, a data-efficient\nVideo LLM explicitly designed for accurate temporal reasoning and multimodal\nunderstanding. At its core, the proposed Temporal-aware Fuseformer employs a\nhierarchical dual-stream architecture that progressively captures temporal\ndynamics within each modality and effectively fuses complementary visual and\naudio information.

However, the lack of a dedicated benchmark that evaluates\nLLMs' ability to develop ideas in Interdisciplinary Research (IDR) settings\nposes a critical barrier to fully understanding their strengths and\nlimitations.

This benchmark\naims to provide a systematic framework for assessing LLM performance in\ncomplex, cross-domain scientific research. Our dataset consists of scientific\npublications sourced from the ArXiv platform covering six distinct disciplines,\nand is annotated by domain experts with diverse academic backgrounds. To ensure\nhigh-quality annotations, we emphasize clearly defined dimensions that\ncharacterize authentic interdisciplinary research. The design of evaluation\ntasks in IDRBench follows a progressive, real-world perspective, reflecting the\nnatural stages of interdisciplinary research development, including 1) IDR\nPaper Identification, 2) IDR Idea Integration, and 3) IDR Idea Recommendation.\nUsing IDRBench, we construct baselines across 10 LLMs and observe that despite\nfostering some level of IDR awareness, LLMs still struggle to produce quality\nIDR ideas.

We introduce\nBELO (BEnchmarking LLMs for Ophthalmology), a standardized and comprehensive\nevaluation benchmark developed through multiple rounds of expert checking by 13\nophthalmologists. BELO assesses ophthalmology-related clinical accuracy and\nreasoning quality. Using keyword matching and a fine-tuned PubMedBERT model, we\ncurated ophthalmology-specific multiple-choice-questions (MCQs) from diverse\nmedical datasets (BCSC, MedMCQA, MedQA, BioASQ, and PubMedQA). The dataset\nunderwent multiple rounds of expert checking. Duplicate and substandard\nquestions were systematically removed. Ten ophthalmologists refined the\nexplanations of each MCQ's correct answer. This was further adjudicated by\nthree senior ophthalmologists. To illustrate BELO's utility, we evaluated six\nLLMs (OpenAI o1, o3-mini, GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, Llama-3-8B, and Gemini 1.5 Pro)\nusing accuracy, macro-F1, and five text-generation metrics (ROUGE-L, BERTScore,\nBARTScore, METEOR, and AlignScore). In a further evaluation involving human\nexperts, two ophthalmologists qualitatively reviewed 50 randomly selected\noutputs for accuracy, comprehensiveness, and completeness. BELO consists of 900\nhigh-quality, expert-reviewed questions aggregated from five sources: BCSC\n(260), BioASQ (10), MedMCQA (572), MedQA (40), and PubMedQA (18). A public\nleaderboard has been established to promote transparent evaluation and\nreporting. Importantly, the BELO dataset will remain a hold-out,\nevaluation-only benchmark to ensure fair and reproducible comparisons of future\nmodels.",

In this paper, we aim to develop a computationally efficient FIQA\nmethod that can be easily deployed in real-world applications. Specifically,\nour method consists of two stages: training a powerful teacher model and\ndistilling a lightweight student model from it. To build a strong teacher\nmodel, we adopt a self-training strategy to improve its capacity. We first\ntrain the teacher model using labeled face images, then use it to generate\npseudo-labels for a set of unlabeled images. These pseudo-labeled samples are\nused in two ways: (1) to distill knowledge into the student model, and (2) to\ncombine with the original labeled images to further enhance the teacher model\nthrough self-training. The enhanced teacher model is used to further\npseudo-label another set of unlabeled images for distilling the student models.\nThe student model is trained using a combination of labeled images,\npseudo-labeled images from the original teacher model, and pseudo-labeled\nimages from the enhanced teacher model. Experimental results demonstrate that\nour student model achieves comparable performance to the teacher model with an\nextremely low computational overhead.

While current detection methods show promise, their underlying\nmechanisms remain poorly understood, and the large sizes of their models make\nthem challenging to deploy in resource-limited environments. This study\ninvestigates the application of the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) to deepfake\ndetection, aiming to identify the key features crucial for recognizing\ndeepfakes. We examine how neural networks can be efficiently pruned while\nmaintaining high detection accuracy. Through extensive experiments with\nMesoNet, CNN-5, and ResNet-18 architectures on the OpenForensic and\nFaceForensics++ datasets, we find that deepfake detection networks contain\nwinning tickets, i.e., subnetworks, that preserve performance even at\nsubstantial sparsity levels. Our results indicate that MesoNet retains 56.2%\naccuracy at 80% sparsity on the OpenForensic dataset, with only 3,000\nparameters, which is about 90% of its baseline accuracy (62.6%). The results\nalso show that our proposed LTH-based iterative magnitude pruning approach\nconsistently outperforms one-shot pruning methods. Using Grad-CAM\nvisualization, we analyze how pruned networks maintain their focus on critical\nfacial regions for deepfake detection. Additionally, we demonstrate the\ntransferability of winning tickets across datasets, suggesting potential for\nefficient, deployable deepfake detection systems.",

However, these systems may be\ninefficient as different queries may require different levels of reasoning,\ndomain knowledge or pre-processing. While generalist LLMs (e.g. GPT-4o,\nClaude-Sonnet) perform well across a wide range of tasks, they may incur\nsignificant financial, energy and computational costs.

However, these\nmethods fail to capture the real human experience, and they cannot draw direct\nconclusions about the system's overall performance. As conversational\nrecommender systems become increasingly vital in e-commerce, social media, and\ncustomer support, the ability to evaluate both recommendation accuracy and\ndialogue management quality using a single metric, thereby authentically\nreflecting user experience, has become the principal challenge impeding\nprogress in this field.\n  In this work, we propose a user-centric evaluation framework based on large\nlanguage models (LLMs) for CRSs, namely Conversational Recommendation Evaluator\n(CoRE). CoRE consists of two main components: (1) LLM-As-Evaluator. Firstly, we\ncomprehensively summarize 12 key factors influencing user experience in CRSs\nand directly leverage LLM as an evaluator to assign a score to each factor. (2)\nMulti-Agent Debater. Secondly, we design a multi-agent debate framework with\nfour distinct roles (common user, domain expert, linguist, and HCI expert) to\ndiscuss and synthesize the 12 evaluation factors into a unified overall\nperformance score.\n  Furthermore, we apply the proposed framework to evaluate four CRSs on two\nbenchmark datasets. The experimental results show that CoRE aligns well with\nhuman evaluation in most of the 12 factors and the overall assessment.\nEspecially, CoRE's overall evaluation scores demonstrate significantly better\nalignment with human feedback compared to existing rule-based metrics.",

However, LLMs, despite\ntheir general reasoning power, struggle significantly in specialized,\ndata-sensitive tasks such as designing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).

TVSRN-V2\ndemonstrates a significant improvement in segmentation accuracy (+4\\% Dice),\nhigher radiomic feature reproducibility, and enhanced predictive performance\n(+0.06 C-index and AUC). These results indicate that SR-driven recovery of\nstructural detail significantly enhances clinical decision support, positioning\nTVSRN-V2 as a well-engineered, clinically viable system for dose-efficient\nimaging and quantitative analysis in real-world CT workflows."
