Recent works on LLM inference use speculative decoding to\nachieve extreme speedups. However, most of these works implicitly design their\nalgorithms for high-end datacenter hardware. In this work, we ask the opposite\nquestion: how fast can we run LLMs on consumer machines? Consumer GPUs can no\nlonger fit the largest available models (50B+ parameters) and must offload them\nto RAM or SSD. When running with offloaded parameters, the inference engine can\nprocess batches of hundreds or thousands of tokens at the same time as just one\ntoken, making it a natural fit for speculative decoding. We propose SpecExec\n(Speculative Execution), a simple parallel decoding method that can generate up\nto 20 tokens per target model iteration for popular LLM families. It utilizes\nthe high spikiness of the token probabilities distribution in modern LLMs and a\nhigh degree of alignment between model output probabilities. SpecExec takes the\nmost probable tokens continuation from the draft model to build a \"cache\" tree\nfor the target model, which then gets validated in a single pass. Using\nSpecExec, we demonstrate inference of 50B+ parameter LLMs on consumer GPUs with\nRAM offloading at 4-6 tokens per second with 4-bit quantization or 2-3 tokens\nper second with 16-bit weights.",

Recent works on LLM inference use speculative decoding to\nachieve extreme speedups. However, most of these works implicitly design their\nalgorithms for high-end datacenter hardware. In this work, we ask the opposite\nquestion: how fast can we run LLMs on consumer machines? Consumer GPUs can no\nlonger fit the largest available models (50B+ parameters) and must offload them\nto RAM or SSD. When running with offloaded parameters, the inference engine can\nprocess batches of hundreds or thousands of tokens at the same time as just one\ntoken, making it a natural fit for speculative decoding. We propose SpecExec\n(Speculative Execution), a simple parallel decoding method that can generate up\nto 20 tokens per target model iteration for popular LLM families. It utilizes\nthe high spikiness of the token probabilities distribution in modern LLMs and a\nhigh degree of alignment between model output probabilities. SpecExec takes the\nmost probable tokens continuation from the draft model to build a \"cache\" tree\nfor the target model, which then gets validated in a single pass. Using\nSpecExec, we demonstrate inference of 50B+ parameter LLMs on consumer GPUs with\nRAM offloading at 4-6 tokens per second with 4-bit quantization or 2-3 tokens\nper second with 16-bit weights."

Rather than directly using the time-consuming model outputs,\nTeaCache focuses on model inputs, which have a strong correlation with the\nmodeloutputs while incurring negligible computational cost. TeaCache first\nmodulates the noisy inputs using the timestep embeddings to ensure their\ndifferences better approximating those of model outputs. TeaCache then\nintroduces a rescaling strategy to refine the estimated differences and\nutilizes them to indicate output caching. Experiments show that TeaCache\nachieves up to 4.41x acceleration over Open-Sora-Plan with negligible (-0.07%\nVbench score) degradation of visual quality.",

Rather than directly using the time-consuming model outputs,\nTeaCache focuses on model inputs, which have a strong correlation with the\nmodeloutputs while incurring negligible computational cost. TeaCache first\nmodulates the noisy inputs using the timestep embeddings to ensure their\ndifferences better approximating those of model outputs. TeaCache then\nintroduces a rescaling strategy to refine the estimated differences and\nutilizes them to indicate output caching. Experiments show that TeaCache\nachieves up to 4.41x acceleration over Open-Sora-Plan with negligible (-0.07%\nVbench score) degradation of visual quality."

Specifically, we explore interference management in a cache-aided\nwireless network assisted by an active IRS, to enhance the achievable degrees\nof freedom (DoF). To this end, we jointly design the content placement,\ndelivery phase, and phase shifts of the IRS and propose a one-shot achievable\nscheme. Our scheme exploits transmitters' cooperation, cache contents (as side\ninformation), interference alignment, and IRS capabilities, adapting to the\nnetwork's parameters.

Specifically, we explore interference management in a cache-aided\nwireless network assisted by an active IRS, to enhance the achievable degrees\nof freedom (DoF). To this end, we jointly design the content placement,\ndelivery phase, and phase shifts of the IRS and propose a one-shot achievable\nscheme. Our scheme exploits transmitters' cooperation, cache contents (as side\ninformation), interference alignment, and IRS capabilities, adapting to the\nnetwork's parameters.

To extend the generation length and facilitate real-world\napplications, a majority of video diffusion models (VDMs) generate videos in an\nautoregressive manner, i.e., generating subsequent clips conditioned on the\nlast frame(s) of the previous clip. However, existing autoregressive VDMs are\nhighly inefficient and redundant: The model must re-compute all the conditional\nframes that are overlapped between adjacent clips.

Deegen takes in the execution\nsemantics of the bytecodes implemented as C++ functions, and automatically\ngenerates a two-tier VM execution engine with a state-of-the-art interpreter, a\nstate-of-the-art baseline JIT, and the tier-switching logic that connects them\ninto a self-adaptive system.\n  We are the first to demonstrate the automatic generation of a JIT compiler,\nand the automatic generation of an interpreter that outperforms the state of\nthe art. Our performance comes from a long list of optimizations supported by\nDeegen, including bytecode specialization and quickening, register pinning, tag\nregister optimization, call inline caching, generic inline caching, JIT\npolymorphic IC, JIT IC inline slab, type-check removal and strength reduction,\ntype-based slow-path extraction and outlining, JIT hot-cold code splitting, and\nJIT OSR-entry. These optimizations are either employed automatically, or guided\nby the language implementer through intuitive APIs. As a result, the\ndisassembly of the Deegen-generated interpreter, baseline JIT, and the\ngenerated JIT code rivals the assembly code hand-written by experts in\nstate-of-the-art VMs.\n  We implement LuaJIT Remake (LJR), a standard-compliant Lua 5.1 VM, using\nDeegen. Across 44 benchmarks, LJR's interpreter is on average 179% faster than\nthe official PUC Lua interpreter, and 31% faster than LuaJIT's interpreter.\nLJR's baseline JIT has negligible startup delay, and its execution performance\nis on average 360% faster than PUC Lua and only 33% slower (but faster on 13/44\nbenchmarks) than LuaJIT's optimizing JIT.",

To address SAM's\nlimitations, we focus on visual length extrapolation and propose a lightweight\nmodel named HRSAM. The extrapolation enables HRSAM trained on low resolutions\nto generalize to high resolutions. We begin by finding the link between the\nextrapolation and attention scores, which leads us to base HRSAM on Swin\nattention. We then introduce the Flexible Local Attention (FLA) framework,\nusing CUDA-optimized Efficient Memory Attention to accelerate HRSAM. Within\nFLA, we implement Flash Swin attention, achieving over a 35% speedup compared\nto traditional Swin attention, and propose a KV-only padding mechanism to\nenhance extrapolation. We also develop the Cycle-scan module that uses State\nSpace models to efficiently expand HRSAM's receptive field. We further develop\nthe HRSAM++ within FLA by adding an anchor map, providing multi-scale data\naugmentation for the extrapolation and a larger receptive field at slight\ncomputational cost. Experiments show that, under standard training, HRSAMs\nsurpass the previous SOTA with only 38% of the latency.

In this work, we introduce AttriBoT, a series of novel techniques\nfor efficiently computing an approximation of the LOO error for context\nattribution. Specifically, AttriBoT uses cached activations to avoid redundant\noperations, performs hierarchical attribution to reduce computation, and\nemulates the behavior of large target models with smaller proxy models. Taken\ntogether, AttriBoT can provide a >300x speedup while remaining more faithful to\na target model's LOO error than prior context attribution methods. This stark\nincrease in performance makes computing context attributions for a given\nresponse 30x faster than generating the response itself, empowering real-world\napplications that require computing attributions at scale.

Although there are various\ntechniques to calculate the reuse profile from dynamic memory traces, it is\nboth time and space-consuming due to the requirement to collect dynamic memory\ntraces at runtime. In contrast, static analysis reuse profile estimation is a\npromisingly faster approach since it is calculated at compile time without\nrunning the program or collecting memory traces. This work presents a static\nanalysis technique to estimate the reuse profile of loop-based programs. For an\ninput program, we generate a basic block-level control flow graph and the\nexecution count by analyzing the LLVM IR of the program. We present the memory\naccesses of the application kernel in a compact bracketed format and use a\nrecursive algorithm to predict the reuse distance histogram. We deploy a\nseparate predictor that unrolls the loop(s) for smaller bounds and generates a\ntemporary reuse distance profile for those small cases. Using these smaller\nprofiles, the reuse profile is extrapolated for the actual loop bound(s). We\nuse this reuse profile to predict the cache hit rate. Results show that our\nmodel can predict cache hit rates with an average accuracy of 95% relative to\nthe dynamic reuse profile methods.",

To address this issue, we propose a wavelet learning framework\nto model complex temporal dependencies of the time series data.

Additionally,\nthe Softmax self-attention mechanism used by Transformers has quadratic\ncomplexity, which leads to excessive computational costs when capturing\nlong-term dependencies. Therefore, we propose a novel attention mechanism:\nRotary Route Attention (RoRA). Unlike Softmax attention, RoRA utilizes rotary\nposition embeddings to inject relative positional information to sequence\ntokens and introduces a small number of routing tokens $r$ to aggregate\ninformation from the $KV$ matrices and redistribute it to the $Q$ matrix,\noffering linear complexity. We further propose WaveRoRA, which leverages RoRA\nto capture inter-series dependencies in the wavelet domain. We conduct\nextensive experiments on eight real-world datasets.

It can quickly store and update the local topology of graph\nstructure and allows us to track patterns in the structure of graph networks,\njust like take snapshots of the graphs. In experiments, GraphSnapShot shows\nefficiency, it can achieve up to 30% training acceleration and 73% memory\nreduction for lossless graph ML training compared to current baselines such as\ndgl.This technique is particular useful for large dynamic graph learning tasks\nsuch as social media analysis and recommendation systems to process complex\nrelationships between entities.\n  The code for GraphSnapShot is publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/NoakLiu/GraphSnapShot."

Extensive experimental results on language\nmodeling demonstrate that Bi-Mamba achieves performance comparable to its\nfull-precision counterparts (e.g., FP16 or BF16) and much better accuracy than\npost-training-binarization (PTB) Mamba baselines, while significantly reducing\nmemory footprint and energy consumption compared to the original Mamba model.\nOur study pioneers a new linear computational complexity LLM framework under\nlow-bit representation and facilitates the future design of specialized\nhardware tailored for efficient 1-bit Mamba-based LLMs.",

For the AFM operation, we leverage unique universal\ncharacteristics (UCs) of a data-object and a cluster's mean set, which are\nskewed distributions on data relationships such as Zipf's law and a\nfeature-value concentration phenomenon. The UCs indicate that the most part of\nthe number of multiplications for similarity calculations is executed regarding\nterms with high document frequencies (df) and the most part of a similarity\nbetween an object- and a mean-feature vector is obtained by the multiplications\nregarding a few high mean-feature values. Our proposed algorithm applies an\ninverted-index data structure to a mean set, extracts the specific region with\nhigh-df terms and high mean-feature values in the mean-inverted index by newly\nintroduced two structural parameters, and exploits the index divided into three\nparts for efficient pruning. The algorithm determines the two structural\nparameters by minimizing the approximate number of multiplications related to\nthat of instructions, reduces the branch mispredictions by sharing the index\nstructure including the two parameters with all the objects, and suppressing\nthe cache misses by keeping in the caches the frequently used data in the\nforegoing specific region, resulting in working in the AFM. We experimentally\ndemonstrate that our algorithm efficiently achieves superior speed performance\nin large-scale documents compared with algorithms using the state-of-the-art\ntechniques.",

                "summary": "Operating Systems enforce logical isolation using abstractions such as\nprocesses, containers, and isolation technologies to protect a system from\nmalicious or buggy code. In this paper, we show new types of side channels\nthrough the file system that break this logical isolation. The file system\nplays a critical role in the operating system, managing all I/O activities\nbetween the application layer and the physical storage device. We observe that\nthe file system implementation is shared, leading to timing leakage when using\ncommon I/O system calls. Specifically, we found that modern operating systems\ntake advantage of any flush operation (which saves cached blocks in memory to\nthe SSD or disk) to flush all of the I/O buffers, even those used by other\nisolation domains. Thus, by measuring the delay of syncfs, the attacker can\ninfer the I/O behavior of victim programs. We then demonstrate a syncfs covert\nchannel attack on multiple file systems, including both Linux native file\nsystems and the Windows file system, achieving a maximum bandwidth of 5 Kbps\nwith an error rate of 0.15% on Linux and 7.6 Kbps with an error rate of 1.9% on\nWindows. In addition, we construct three side-channel attacks targeting both\nLinux and Android devices. On Linux devices, we implement a website\nfingerprinting attack and a video fingerprinting attack by tracking the write\npatterns of temporary buffering files. On Android devices, we design an\napplication fingerprinting attack that leaks application write patterns during\nboot-up. The attacks achieve over 90% F1 score, precision, and recall. Finally,\nwe demonstrate that these attacks can be exploited across containers\nimplementing a container detection technique and a cross-container covert\nchannel attack.",

                    "value": "Operating Systems enforce logical isolation using abstractions such as\nprocesses, containers, and isolation technologies to protect a system from\nmalicious or buggy code. In this paper, we show new types of side channels\nthrough the file system that break this logical isolation. The file system\nplays a critical role in the operating system, managing all I/O activities\nbetween the application layer and the physical storage device. We observe that\nthe file system implementation is shared, leading to timing leakage when using\ncommon I/O system calls. Specifically, we found that modern operating systems\ntake advantage of any flush operation (which saves cached blocks in memory to\nthe SSD or disk) to flush all of the I/O buffers, even those used by other\nisolation domains. Thus, by measuring the delay of syncfs, the attacker can\ninfer the I/O behavior of victim programs. We then demonstrate a syncfs covert\nchannel attack on multiple file systems, including both Linux native file\nsystems and the Windows file system, achieving a maximum bandwidth of 5 Kbps\nwith an error rate of 0.15% on Linux and 7.6 Kbps with an error rate of 1.9% on\nWindows. In addition, we construct three side-channel attacks targeting both\nLinux and Android devices. On Linux devices, we implement a website\nfingerprinting attack and a video fingerprinting attack by tracking the write\npatterns of temporary buffering files. On Android devices, we design an\napplication fingerprinting attack that leaks application write patterns during\nboot-up. The attacks achieve over 90% F1 score, precision, and recall. Finally,\nwe demonstrate that these attacks can be exploited across containers\nimplementing a container detection technique and a cross-container covert\nchannel attack."

The encouraging results, however, come with the\ncost of slow inference, since each denoising step requires inference on a\ntransformer model with a large scale of parameters. In this study, we make an\ninteresting and somehow surprising observation: the computation of a large\nproportion of layers in the diffusion transformer, through introducing a\ncaching mechanism, can be readily removed even without updating the model\nparameters. In the case of U-ViT-H/2, for example, we may remove up to 93.68%\nof the computation in the cache steps (46.84% for all steps), with less than\n0.01 drop in FID. To achieve this, we introduce a novel scheme, named\nLearning-to-Cache (L2C), that learns to conduct caching in a dynamic manner for\ndiffusion transformers. Specifically, by leveraging the identical structure of\nlayers in transformers and the sequential nature of diffusion, we explore\nredundant computations between timesteps by treating each layer as the\nfundamental unit for caching. To address the challenge of the exponential\nsearch space in deep models for identifying layers to cache and remove, we\npropose a novel differentiable optimization objective. An input-invariant yet\ntimestep-variant router is then optimized, which can finally produce a static\ncomputation graph. Experimental results show that L2C largely outperforms\nsamplers such as DDIM and DPM-Solver, alongside prior cache-based methods at\nthe same inference speed.

However, stacking multiple\nattention layers leads to attention concentration. One natural way to address\nthis issue is to use cross-layer attention, allowing information from earlier\nlayers to be directly accessible to later layers. However, this approach is\ncomputationally expensive. To address this problem, we propose Transformer with\nresidual value (ResFormer) which approximates cross-layer attention through\nadding a residual connection from the values of the the first layer to all\nsubsequent layers. Based on this method, one variant is the Transformer with\nsingle layer value (SVFormer), where all layers share the same value embedding\nfrom first layer, reducing the $KV$ cache by nearly 50\\%. Comprehensive\nempirical evidence demonstrates that ResFormer mitigates attention\nconcentration problem in deeper layers and enhances representation across most\nlayers, outperforming the vanilla Transformer, DenseFormer, and NeuTRENO in\ntraining error as well as downstream tasks. Further visualization results\nsuggest that Resformer alleviates attention sinks through avoiding value-state\ndrains. SVFormer trains significantly faster than the vanilla Transformer and\nperforms better than other methods like GQA and CLA, with performance\ninfluenced by sequence length and cumulative learning rate.",

However, this approach is\ncomputationally expensive. To address this problem, we propose Transformer with\nresidual value (ResFormer) which approximates cross-layer attention through\nadding a residual connection from the values of the the first layer to all\nsubsequent layers. Based on this method, one variant is the Transformer with\nsingle layer value (SVFormer), where all layers share the same value embedding\nfrom first layer, reducing the $KV$ cache by nearly 50\\%. Comprehensive\nempirical evidence demonstrates that ResFormer mitigates attention\nconcentration problem in deeper layers and enhances representation across most\nlayers, outperforming the vanilla Transformer, DenseFormer, and NeuTRENO in\ntraining error as well as downstream tasks. Further visualization results\nsuggest that Resformer alleviates attention sinks through avoiding value-state\ndrains. SVFormer trains significantly faster than the vanilla Transformer and\nperforms better than other methods like GQA and CLA, with performance\ninfluenced by sequence length and cumulative learning rate."

With the new algorithmic insights and careful engineering\neffort, we achieved a highly optimized implementation of the Pkd-tree.\n  We tested Pkd-tree with various synthetic and real-world datasets, including\nboth uniform and highly skewed data. We compare the Pkd-tree with\nstate-of-the-art parallel $k$d-tree implementations. In all tests, with better\nor competitive query performance, Pkd-tree is much faster in construction and\nupdates consistently than all baselines. We released our code."

To achieve these objectives, the most recent CXL protocol has\nbrought forth several innovative features, such as port-focused routing,\ndevice-handled coherence, and PCIe 6.0 compatibility. However, due to the\nlimited availability of hardware prototypes and simulators compatible with CXL,\nearlier CXL research has largely depended on emulating CXL devices using remote\nNUMA nodes. Unfortunately, these NUMA-based emulators have difficulties in\naccurately representing the new features due to fundamental differences in\nhardware and protocols. Moreover, the absence of support for non-tree topology\nand PCIe links makes it complex to merely adapt existing simulators for CXL\nsimulation. To overcome these problems, we introduce ESF, a simulation\nframework specifically designed for CXL systems.

In this paper, we propose a\nnovel training-free flow-solver to reduce NFE while maintaining high-quality\ngeneration. The key insight for the flow-solver is to leverage the previous\nsteps to reduce the NFE, where a cache is created to reuse these results from\nthe previous steps. Specifically, the Taylor expansion is first used to\napproximate the ODE. To calculate the high-order derivatives of Taylor\nexpansion, the flow-solver proposes to use the previous steps and a polynomial\ninterpolation to approximate it, where the number of orders we could\napproximate equals the number of previous steps we cached. We also prove that\nthe flow-solver has a more minor approximation error and faster generation\nspeed. Experimental results on the CIFAR-10, CelebA-HQ, LSUN-Bedroom,\nLSUN-Church, ImageNet, and real text-to-image generation prove the efficiency\nof the flow-solver.

A common\nstrategy for diminishing computational demands is to cache Key-Value (KV)\nstates from the attention mechanism which is adopted predominately by\nmainstream LLMs. It can mitigate the need of repeated attention computations,\nbut brings significant memory overhead. Current practices in NLP often use\nsparse attention which may, unfortunately, lead to substantial inaccuracies, or\nhallucinations, in code generation tasks. In this paper, we analyze the\nattention weights distribution within code generation models via an empirical\nstudy, uncovering a sparsity pattern, i.e., the aggregation of information at\nspecific anchor points. Based on this observation, we propose a novel approach,\nAnchorCoder, which features token-wise anchor attention designed to extract and\ncompress the contextual information, and layer-wise anchor attention enabling\ncross-layer communication to mitigate the issue of excessive superposition\ncaused by the compression. The extensive experiments across multiple benchmark\ndatasets confirm the effectiveness of AnchorCoder, which can consistently\nachieve a significant (at least 70%) reduction in KV cache requirements, while\npreserving the majority of model's performance.",

However, existing\nschedulers primarily target either GPU compute or Key-Value Cache (KVC)\nutilization, failing to fully optimize both GPU compute and KVC usage during\neach iteration or guarantee timely KVC allocations when needed. To address\nthese challenges, we conducted a trace-based experimental analysis and made\ninsightful observations, leading to the design of a system called EcoServe.\nEcoServe maximizes multi-resource utilization while ensuring service-level\nobjective (SLO) guarantees in LLM serving. To enable adding prompts to a batch\nto maximize GPU utilization in each iteration, EcoServe maintains separate\nwaiting queues for prompt processing tasks (PTs) and generation tasks (GTs). It\nbatches GTs with the same predicted response lengths (RL) to save scheduling\ntime and allocates KVC space for the predicted RL to avoid KVC allocation\nfailures. It further has a novel KVC pipelining method, allowing sharing\nallocated but unused KVC space to enhance KVC utilization. In addition, it\nprioritizes queued requests that occupy more KVC to release KVC earlier and\nsatisfy request service-level-objective (SLO). Experimental results demonstrate\nthat EcoServe increases throughput by up to 4$\\times$ with the same level of\nlatency, generates up to 91\\% lower job completion time and up to 91\\% higher\nSLO satisfaction ratio compared to vLLM. It also reduces the number of GPUs\nused in DistServe by up to 78\\% while maintaining the same level of goodput.",

                    "value": "As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to grow, reducing costs and\nalleviating GPU demands has become increasingly critical. However, existing\nschedulers primarily target either GPU compute or Key-Value Cache (KVC)\nutilization, failing to fully optimize both GPU compute and KVC usage during\neach iteration or guarantee timely KVC allocations when needed. To address\nthese challenges, we conducted a trace-based experimental analysis and made\ninsightful observations, leading to the design of a system called EcoServe.\nEcoServe maximizes multi-resource utilization while ensuring service-level\nobjective (SLO) guarantees in LLM serving. To enable adding prompts to a batch\nto maximize GPU utilization in each iteration, EcoServe maintains separate\nwaiting queues for prompt processing tasks (PTs) and generation tasks (GTs). It\nbatches GTs with the same predicted response lengths (RL) to save scheduling\ntime and allocates KVC space for the predicted RL to avoid KVC allocation\nfailures. It further has a novel KVC pipelining method, allowing sharing\nallocated but unused KVC space to enhance KVC utilization. In addition, it\nprioritizes queued requests that occupy more KVC to release KVC earlier and\nsatisfy request service-level-objective (SLO). Experimental results demonstrate\nthat EcoServe increases throughput by up to 4$\\times$ with the same level of\nlatency, generates up to 91\\% lower job completion time and up to 91\\% higher\nSLO satisfaction ratio compared to vLLM. It also reduces the number of GPUs\nused in DistServe by up to 78\\% while maintaining the same level of goodput."

We conduct a thorough evaluation of Hunyuan-Large's superior\nperformance across various benchmarks including language understanding and\ngeneration, logical reasoning, mathematical problem-solving, coding,\nlong-context, and aggregated tasks, where it outperforms LLama3.1-70B and\nexhibits comparable performance when compared to the significantly larger\nLLama3.1-405B model. Key practice of Hunyuan-Large include large-scale\nsynthetic data that is orders larger than in previous literature, a mixed\nexpert routing strategy, a key-value cache compression technique, and an\nexpert-specific learning rate strategy. Additionally, we also investigate the\nscaling laws and learning rate schedule of mixture of experts models, providing\nvaluable insights and guidances for future model development and optimization.\nThe code and checkpoints of Hunyuan-Large are released to facilitate future\ninnovations and applications.\n  Codes: https://github.com/Tencent/Hunyuan-Large\n  Models: https://huggingface.co/tencent/Tencent-Hunyuan-Large",

In our\nresearch, for the first time, we discovered a set of new timing side channels\nin LLM systems, arising from shared caches and GPU memory allocations, which\ncan be exploited to infer both confidential system prompts and those issued by\nother users. These vulnerabilities echo security challenges observed in\ntraditional computing systems, highlighting an urgent need to address potential\ninformation leakage in LLM serving infrastructures. In this paper, we report\nnovel attack strategies designed to exploit such timing side channels inherent\nin LLM deployments, specifically targeting the Key-Value (KV) cache and\nsemantic cache widely used to enhance LLM inference performance. Our approach\nleverages timing measurements and classification models to detect cache hits,\nallowing an adversary to infer private prompts with high accuracy. We also\npropose a token-by-token search algorithm to efficiently recover shared prompt\nprefixes in the caches, showing the feasibility of stealing system prompts and\nthose produced by peer users. Our experimental studies on black-box testing of\npopular online LLM services demonstrate that such privacy risks are completely\nrealistic, with significant consequences. Our findings underscore the need for\nrobust mitigation to protect LLM systems against such emerging threats.",

In this paper, we report\nnovel attack strategies designed to exploit such timing side channels inherent\nin LLM deployments, specifically targeting the Key-Value (KV) cache and\nsemantic cache widely used to enhance LLM inference performance. Our approach\nleverages timing measurements and classification models to detect cache hits,\nallowing an adversary to infer private prompts with high accuracy. We also\npropose a token-by-token search algorithm to efficiently recover shared prompt\nprefixes in the caches, showing the feasibility of stealing system prompts and\nthose produced by peer users. Our experimental studies on black-box testing of\npopular online LLM services demonstrate that such privacy risks are completely\nrealistic, with significant consequences. Our findings underscore the need for\nrobust mitigation to protect LLM systems against such emerging threats."

                "summary": "Decentralised learning has recently gained traction as an alternative to\nfederated learning in which both data and coordination are distributed. To\npreserve the confidentiality of users' data, decentralised learning relies on\ndifferential privacy, multi-party computation, or both. However, running\nmultiple privacy-preserving summations in sequence may allow adversaries to\nperform reconstruction attacks. Current reconstruction countermeasures either\ncannot trivially be adapted to the distributed setting, or add excessive\namounts of noise.\n  In this work, we first show that passive honest-but-curious adversaries can\ninfer other users' private data after several privacy-preserving summations.\nFor example, in subgraphs with 18 users, we show that only three passive\nhonest-but-curious adversaries succeed at reconstructing private data 11.0% of\nthe time, requiring an average of 8.8 summations per adversary. The success\nrate depends only on the adversaries' direct neighbourhood, and is independent\nof the size of the full network. We consider weak adversaries that do not\ncontrol the graph topology, cannot exploit the summation's inner workings, and\ndo not have auxiliary knowledge; and show that these adversaries can still\ninfer private data.\n  We analyse how reconstruction relates to topology and propose the first\ntopology-based decentralised defence against reconstruction attacks.

                    "value": "Decentralised learning has recently gained traction as an alternative to\nfederated learning in which both data and coordination are distributed. To\npreserve the confidentiality of users' data, decentralised learning relies on\ndifferential privacy, multi-party computation, or both. However, running\nmultiple privacy-preserving summations in sequence may allow adversaries to\nperform reconstruction attacks. Current reconstruction countermeasures either\ncannot trivially be adapted to the distributed setting, or add excessive\namounts of noise.\n  In this work, we first show that passive honest-but-curious adversaries can\ninfer other users' private data after several privacy-preserving summations.\nFor example, in subgraphs with 18 users, we show that only three passive\nhonest-but-curious adversaries succeed at reconstructing private data 11.0% of\nthe time, requiring an average of 8.8 summations per adversary. The success\nrate depends only on the adversaries' direct neighbourhood, and is independent\nof the size of the full network. We consider weak adversaries that do not\ncontrol the graph topology, cannot exploit the summation's inner workings, and\ndo not have auxiliary knowledge; and show that these adversaries can still\ninfer private data.\n  We analyse how reconstruction relates to topology and propose the first\ntopology-based decentralised defence against reconstruction attacks. We show\nthat reconstruction requires a number of adversaries linear in the length of\nthe network's shortest cycle. Consequently, exact attacks over\nprivacy-preserving summations are impossible in acyclic networks.\n  Our work is a stepping stone for a formal theory of topology-based\ndecentralised reconstruction defences.

Extensive experimental results validate our design choices and\ndemonstrate the superiority of our approach, dubbed ChronoDepth. Project page:\nhttps://xdimlab.github.io/ChronoDepth/."

To this end, we introduce invertible\nConsistency Distillation (iCD), a generalized consistency distillation\nframework that facilitates both high-quality image synthesis and accurate image\nencoding in only 3-4 inference steps.

Among the most promising breakthroughs are the rise of\nNeural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) and Gaussian Splatting (GS). NeRFs encode the\nobject's shape and color in neural network weights using a handful of images\nwith known camera positions to generate novel views. In contrast, GS provides\naccelerated training and inference without a decrease in rendering quality by\nencoding the object's characteristics in a collection of Gaussian\ndistributions. These two techniques have found many use cases in spatial\ncomputing and other domains. On the other hand, the emergence of deepfake\nmethods has sparked considerable controversy.

Among the most promising breakthroughs are the rise of\nNeural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) and Gaussian Splatting (GS). NeRFs encode the\nobject's shape and color in neural network weights using a handful of images\nwith known camera positions to generate novel views. In contrast, GS provides\naccelerated training and inference without a decrease in rendering quality by\nencoding the object's characteristics in a collection of Gaussian\ndistributions. These two techniques have found many use cases in spatial\ncomputing and other domains. On the other hand, the emergence of deepfake\nmethods has sparked considerable controversy.

Our GLOV meta-prompts an LLM with the\ndownstream task description, querying it for suitable VLM prompts (e.g., for\nzero-shot classification with CLIP). These prompts are ranked according to a\npurity measure obtained through a fitness function. In each respective\noptimization step, the ranked prompts are fed as in-context examples (with\ntheir accuracies) to equip the LLM with the knowledge of the type of text\nprompts preferred by the downstream VLM. Furthermore, we also explicitly steer\nthe LLM generation process in each optimization step by specifically adding an\noffset difference vector of the embeddings from the positive and negative\nsolutions found by the LLM, in previous optimization steps, to the intermediate\nlayer of the network for the next generation step. This offset vector steers\nthe LLM generation toward the type of language preferred by the downstream VLM,\nresulting in enhanced performance on the downstream vision tasks. We\ncomprehensively evaluate our GLOV on 16 diverse datasets using two families of\nVLMs, i.e., dual-encoder (e.g., CLIP) and encoder-decoder (e.g., LLaVa) models\n-- showing that the discovered solutions can enhance the recognition\nperformance by up to 15.0% and 57.5% (3.8% and 21.6% on average) for these\nmodels.",

However, the effectiveness of many moderation interventions is\nstill uncertain. Here, we apply a causal inference approach to shed light on\nthe effectiveness of The Great Ban, a massive social media deplatforming\nintervention. We analyze 53M comments shared by nearly 34K users, providing\nin-depth results on both the intended and unintended consequences of the ban.\nOur causal analyses reveal that 15.6% of the moderated users abandoned the\nplatform while the remaining ones decreased their overall toxicity by 4.1%.\nNonetheless, a subset of those users increased their toxicity by 70% after the\nintervention.

However, the effectiveness of many moderation interventions is\nstill uncertain. Here, we apply a causal inference approach to shed light on\nthe effectiveness of The Great Ban, a massive social media deplatforming\nintervention. We analyze 53M comments shared by nearly 34K users, providing\nin-depth results on both the intended and unintended consequences of the ban.\nOur causal analyses reveal that 15.6% of the moderated users abandoned the\nplatform while the remaining ones decreased their overall toxicity by 4.1%.\nNonetheless, a subset of those users increased their toxicity by 70% after the\nintervention. However, the increases in toxicity did not lead to marked\nincreases in activity or engagement, meaning that the most toxic users had an\noverall limited impact.

Due to the popularity of LLMs fine-tuning and its accompanying privacy\nconcerns, differentially private (DP) fine-tuning of pretrained LLMs has been\nwidely used to safeguarding the privacy of task-specific datasets. Lying at the\ndesign core of DP LLM fine-tuning methods is the satisfactory tradeoff among\nprivacy, utility, and scalability. Most existing methods build upon the seminal\nwork of DP-SGD. Despite pushing the scalability of DP-SGD to its limit,\nDP-SGD-based fine-tuning methods are unfortunately limited by the inherent\ninefficiency of SGD.\n  In this paper, we investigate the potential of DP zeroth-order methods for\nLLM pretraining, which avoids the scalability bottleneck of SGD by\napproximating the gradient with the more efficient zeroth-order gradient.\nRather than treating the zeroth-order method as a drop-in replacement for SGD,\nthis paper presents a comprehensive study both theoretically and empirically.\nFirst, we propose the stagewise DP zeroth-order method (DP-ZOSO) that\ndynamically schedules key hyperparameters. This design is grounded on the\nsynergy between DP random perturbation and the gradient approximation error of\nthe zeroth-order method, and its effect on fine-tuning trajectory.\n  We provide theoretical analysis for both proposed methods. We conduct\nextensive empirical analysis on both encoder-only masked language model and\ndecoder-only autoregressive language model, achieving impressive results in\nterms of scalability and utility regardless of the class of tasks (compared\nwith DPZero, DP-ZOPO improves $4.5\\%$ on SST-5, $5.5\\%$ on MNLI with\nRoBERTa-Large and 9.2\\% on CB, 3.9\\% on BoolQ with OPT-2.7b when $\\epsilon=4$,\ndemonstrates more significant enhancement in performance on more complicated\ntasks).",

Despite pushing the scalability of DP-SGD to its limit,\nDP-SGD-based fine-tuning methods are unfortunately limited by the inherent\ninefficiency of SGD.\n  In this paper, we investigate the potential of DP zeroth-order methods for\nLLM pretraining, which avoids the scalability bottleneck of SGD by\napproximating the gradient with the more efficient zeroth-order gradient.\nRather than treating the zeroth-order method as a drop-in replacement for SGD,\nthis paper presents a comprehensive study both theoretically and empirically.\nFirst, we propose the stagewise DP zeroth-order method (DP-ZOSO) that\ndynamically schedules key hyperparameters. This design is grounded on the\nsynergy between DP random perturbation and the gradient approximation error of\nthe zeroth-order method, and its effect on fine-tuning trajectory.\n  We provide theoretical analysis for both proposed methods. We conduct\nextensive empirical analysis on both encoder-only masked language model and\ndecoder-only autoregressive language model, achieving impressive results in\nterms of scalability and utility regardless of the class of tasks (compared\nwith DPZero, DP-ZOPO improves $4.5\\%$ on SST-5, $5.5\\%$ on MNLI with\nRoBERTa-Large and 9.2\\% on CB, 3.9\\% on BoolQ with OPT-2.7b when $\\epsilon=4$,\ndemonstrates more significant enhancement in performance on more complicated\ntasks)."

In this study, we quantify the impact of the correlated\nclustering of weak lensing source galaxies with the surrounding large-scale\nstructure, known as source-lens clustering (SLC), which is commonly neglected.\nFor this, we use simulated cosmological datasets with realistically distributed\ngalaxies and measure shear correlation functions for both clustered and\nuniformly distributed source galaxies. Cosmological analyses are performed for\nboth scenarios to quantify the impact of SLC on parameter inference for a\nKiDS-like and a Euclid-like setting. We find for Stage III surveys, SLC has a\nminor impact when accounting for nuisance parameters for intrinsic alignments\nand shifts of tomographic bins, as these nuisance parameters absorb the effect\nof SLC, thus changing their original meaning. For KiDS (Euclid), the inferred\nintrinsic alignment amplitude $A_{IA}$ changes from $0.11_{-0.46}^{+0.44}$\n($-0.009_{-0.080}^{+0.079}$) for data without SLC to $0.28_{-0.44}^{+0.42}$\n($0.022_{-0.082}^{+0.081}$) with SLC. However, fixed nuisance parameters lead\nto shifts in $S_8$ and $\\Omega_{m}$, emphasizing the need for including SLC in\nthe modelling. For Euclid, we find that $\\sigma_8$, $\\Omega_m$, and $w_0$ are\nshifted by $0.19$, $0.12$, and $0.12\\, \\sigma$, respectively, when including\nfree nuisance parameters, and by $0.20$, $0.16$, and $0.32\\,\\sigma$ when fixing\nthe nuisance parameters.

However, their demanding\ncomputational requirements have hindered their practical application in\nreal-time object detection (OD) scenarios. In this paper, we scrutinize the\nlimitations of two leading models in the OVDEval benchmark, OmDet and\nGrounding-DINO, and introduce OmDet-Turbo. This novel transformer-based\nreal-time OVD model features an innovative Efficient Fusion Head (EFH) module\ndesigned to alleviate the bottlenecks observed in OmDet and Grounding-DINO.\nNotably, OmDet-Turbo-Base achieves a 100.2 frames per second (FPS) with\nTensorRT and language cache techniques applied.

However, their demanding\ncomputational requirements have hindered their practical application in\nreal-time object detection (OD) scenarios. In this paper, we scrutinize the\nlimitations of two leading models in the OVDEval benchmark, OmDet and\nGrounding-DINO, and introduce OmDet-Turbo. This novel transformer-based\nreal-time OVD model features an innovative Efficient Fusion Head (EFH) module\ndesigned to alleviate the bottlenecks observed in OmDet and Grounding-DINO.\nNotably, OmDet-Turbo-Base achieves a 100.2 frames per second (FPS) with\nTensorRT and language cache techniques applied.

This paper aims to address such privacy concerns by examining\nthe representative case study of shared database scenarios in 5G Open Radio\nAccess Network (O-RAN) networks where we have a shared database within the\nnear-real-time (near-RT) RAN intelligent controller. We focus on securing the\ndata that can be used by machine learning (ML) models for spectrum sharing and\ninterference mitigation applications without compromising the model and network\nperformances.

While\nmultimodal large language models (MLLM) have demonstrated remarkable visual\nunderstanding capabilities, they arguably lack accurate perception abilities,\ne.g. the stage-of-the-art model Qwen2-VL only achieves a 43.9 recall rate on\nthe COCO dataset, limiting many tasks requiring the combination of perception\nand understanding. In this work, we aim to bridge this perception gap from both\nmodel designing and data development perspectives. We first introduce ChatRex,\nan MLLM with a decoupled perception design. Instead of having the LLM directly\npredict box coordinates, we feed the output boxes from a universal proposal\nnetwork into the LLM, allowing it to output the corresponding box indices to\nrepresent its detection results, turning the regression task into a\nretrieval-based task that LLM handles more proficiently. From the data\nperspective, we build a fully automated data engine and construct the\nRexverse-2M dataset which possesses multiple granularities to support the joint\ntraining of perception and understanding. After standard two-stage training,\nChatRex demonstrates strong perception capabilities while preserving multimodal\nunderstanding performance. The combination of these two capabilities\nsimultaneously unlocks many attractive applications, demonstrating the\ncomplementary roles of both perception and understanding in MLLM.

Drawing on previous\nsuccessful experiences, researchers have recently explored extending the\nsuccess to the video understanding realms. Apart from training from scratch, an\nefficient way is to utilize the pre-trained image-LLMs, leading to two\nmainstream approaches, i.e. zero-shot inference and further fine-tuning with\nvideo data. In this work, our study of these approaches harvests an effective\ndata augmentation method. We first make a deeper inspection of the zero-shot\ninference way and identify two limitations, i.e. limited generalization and\nlack of temporal understanding capabilities. Thus, we further investigate the\nfine-tuning approach and find a low learning efficiency when simply using all\nthe video data samples, which can be attributed to a lack of instruction\ndiversity. Aiming at this issue, we develop a method called T2Vid to synthesize\nvideo-like samples to enrich the instruction diversity in the training corpus.\nIntegrating these data enables a simple and efficient training scheme, which\nachieves performance comparable to or even superior to using full video\ndatasets by training with just 15% the sample size. Meanwhile, we find that the\nproposed scheme can boost the performance of long video understanding without\ntraining with long video samples. We hope our study will spark more thinking\nabout using MLLMs for video understanding and curation of high-quality data.\nThe code is released at https://github.com/xjtupanda/T2Vid.",

Moreover, to further align the model\nwith the critical token information during the alignment process, we extend the\nconventional DPO algorithms to token-level DPO and utilize the differential\nlikelihood from the aforementioned positive and negative model as important\nweight for token-level DPO learning.Experimental results on GSM8K and MATH500\nbenchmarks with two-widely used models Llama-3 (8B and 70B) and deepseek-math\n(7B) demonstrate the effectiveness of the propsoed approach cDPO."

The combination of helium\nenhancements with nebular continuum emission expected for intense bursts of\nstar formation have the potential to help reduce the tension between JWST\nobservations and certain galaxy formation models."

Recent LMMs have shown various\nintriguing abilities, such as solving math problems written on the blackboard,\nreasoning about events and celebrities in news images, and explaining visual\njokes. Rapid model advancements pose challenges to evaluation benchmark\ndevelopment. Problems include: (1) How to systematically structure and evaluate\nthe complicated multimodal tasks; (2) How to design evaluation metrics that\nwork well across question and answer types; and (3) How to give model insights\nbeyond a simple performance ranking. To this end, we present MM-Vet, designed\nbased on the insight that the intriguing ability to solve complicated tasks is\noften achieved by a generalist model being able to integrate different core\nvision-language (VL) capabilities. MM-Vet defines 6 core VL capabilities and\nexamines the 16 integrations of interest derived from the capability\ncombination.

                    "value": "We propose MM-Vet, an evaluation benchmark that examines large multimodal\nmodels (LMMs) on complicated multimodal tasks. Recent LMMs have shown various\nintriguing abilities, such as solving math problems written on the blackboard,\nreasoning about events and celebrities in news images, and explaining visual\njokes. Rapid model advancements pose challenges to evaluation benchmark\ndevelopment. Problems include: (1) How to systematically structure and evaluate\nthe complicated multimodal tasks; (2) How to design evaluation metrics that\nwork well across question and answer types; and (3) How to give model insights\nbeyond a simple performance ranking. To this end, we present MM-Vet, designed\nbased on the insight that the intriguing ability to solve complicated tasks is\noften achieved by a generalist model being able to integrate different core\nvision-language (VL) capabilities. MM-Vet defines 6 core VL capabilities and\nexamines the 16 integrations of interest derived from the capability\ncombination. For evaluation metrics, we propose an LLM-based evaluator for\nopen-ended outputs. The evaluator enables the evaluation across different\nquestion types and answer styles, resulting in a unified scoring metric.

                "summary": "Detecting Human-Object Interactions (HOI) in zero-shot settings, where models\nmust handle unseen classes, poses significant challenges. Existing methods that\nrely on aligning visual encoders with large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to\ntap into the extensive knowledge of VLMs, require large, computationally\nexpensive models and encounter training difficulties. Adapting VLMs with prompt\nlearning offers an alternative to direct alignment. However, fine-tuning on\ntask-specific datasets often leads to overfitting to seen classes and\nsuboptimal performance on unseen classes, due to the absence of unseen class\nlabels. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel prompt learning-based\nframework for Efficient Zero-Shot HOI detection (EZ-HOI). First, we introduce\nLarge Language Model (LLM) and VLM guidance for learnable prompts, integrating\ndetailed HOI descriptions and visual semantics to adapt VLMs to HOI tasks.\nHowever, because training datasets contain seen-class labels alone, fine-tuning\nVLMs on such datasets tends to optimize learnable prompts for seen classes\ninstead of unseen ones. Therefore, we design prompt learning for unseen classes\nusing information from related seen classes, with LLMs utilized to highlight\nthe differences between unseen and related seen classes. Quantitative\nevaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our EZ-HOI achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance across various zero-shot settings with only 10.35%\nto 33.95% of the trainable parameters compared to existing methods.

We also employ a supervised speech\ntokenizer derived from an automatic speech recognition (ASR) model by\nincorporating a vector-quantized bottleneck into the encoder. This supervised\ntraining approach results in discrete speech tokens with strong semantic\npreservation even at lower frame rates (e.g. 12.5Hz), while still maintaining\nspeech reconstruction quality. Starting from a pre-trained language model and\nscaling our pre-training to 1 trillion tokens (with 600B synthetic interleaved\nspeech-text data), we achieve state-of-the-art performance in speech language\nmodeling and spoken question answering, improving performance on spoken\nquestions tasks from the previous SOTA of 13% (Moshi) to 31%. We further\ndemonstrate that by fine-tuning the pre-trained model with speech dialogue\ndata, we can develop an end-to-end spoken chatbot that achieves competitive\nperformance comparable to existing baselines in both conversational abilities\nand speech quality, even operating exclusively in the speech domain.",

We further\ndemonstrate that by fine-tuning the pre-trained model with speech dialogue\ndata, we can develop an end-to-end spoken chatbot that achieves competitive\nperformance comparable to existing baselines in both conversational abilities\nand speech quality, even operating exclusively in the speech domain."

Benefiting from the transferred\nknowledge, our BK-SDMs deliver competitive results on zero-shot MS-COCO against\nlarger multi-billion parameter models. We further demonstrate the applicability\nof our lightweight backbones in personalized generation and image-to-image\ntranslation.

Benefiting from the transferred\nknowledge, our BK-SDMs deliver competitive results on zero-shot MS-COCO against\nlarger multi-billion parameter models. We further demonstrate the applicability\nof our lightweight backbones in personalized generation and image-to-image\ntranslation. Deployment of our models on edge devices attains 4-second\ninference. Code and models can be found at:\nhttps://github.com/Nota-NetsPresso/BK-SDM"

If it remains\nundiagnosed, depression can lead to severe health issues, which can manifest\nphysically and even lead to suicide. Generally, Diagnosing depression or any\nother mental disorder involves conducting semi-structured interviews alongside\nsupplementary questionnaires, including variants of the Patient Health\nQuestionnaire (PHQ) by Clinicians and mental health professionals. This\napproach places significant reliance on the experience and judgment of trained\nphysicians, making the diagnosis susceptible to personal biases. Given that the\nunderlying mechanisms causing depression are still being actively researched,\nphysicians often face challenges in diagnosing and treating the condition,\nparticularly in its early stages of clinical presentation. Recently,\nsignificant strides have been made in Artificial neural computing to solve\nproblems involving text, image, and speech in various domains. Our analysis has\naimed to leverage these state-of-the-art (SOTA) models in our experiments to\nachieve optimal outcomes leveraging multiple modalities. The experiments were\nperformed on the Extended Distress Analysis Interview Corpus Wizard of Oz\ndataset (E-DAIC) corpus presented in the Audio/Visual Emotion Challenge (AVEC)\n2019 Challenge. The proposed solutions demonstrate better results achieved by\nProprietary and Open-source Large Language Models (LLMs), which achieved a Root\nMean Square Error (RMSE) score of 3.98 on Textual Modality, beating the AVEC\n2019 challenge baseline results and current SOTA regression analysis\narchitectures. Additionally, the proposed solution achieved an accuracy of\n71.43% in the classification task.

With offshore wind turbine lifetimes of 25-30 years,\nand new offshore leases spanning 60 years, it is vital to consider long-term\nchanges in potential wind power resource at the farm planning stage. Such\nchanges may arise from multiple sources, including climate change, and\nincreasing wake-induced power losses. In this work, we investigate and compare\nthese two sources of long-term change in wind power, for a case study\nconsisting of 21 wind farms within the German Bight. Consistent with previous\nstudies, we find a small but significant reduction in wind resource due to\nclimate change by the end of the 21st century under the high-emission RCP8.5\nscenario, compared with a historical period, with a mean power reduction (over\nan ensemble of seven climate models) of 2.1%. To assess the impact of\nwake-induced losses due to increasingly dense farm build-out, we model wakes\nwithin the German Bight region using an engineering wake model, under various\nstages of (planned) build-out corresponding to the years 2010-2027. By\nidentifying clusters of wind farms, we decompose wake effects into long-range\n(inter-cluster), medium-range (intra-cluster) and short-range (intra-farm)\neffects. Inter-cluster wake-induced losses increase from 0 for the 2010\nscenario to 2.5% for the 2027 scenario, with intra-cluster losses also\nincreasing from 0 to 4.3%. Intra-farm losses are relatively constant, at around\n13%. While the evolution of wake effects therefore outweighs the climate\neffect, and impacts over a shorter timescale, both factors are significant. We\nalso find evidence of an interaction between the climate and wake effects. Both\nclimate change and evolving wake effects must therefore be considered within\nresource assessment and wind farm planning.",

In unimodal MIA, LUMIA\nachieves an average gain of 15.71 % in Area Under the Curve (AUC) over previous\ntechniques.

Drawing on previous\nsuccessful experiences, researchers have recently explored extending the\nsuccess to the video understanding realms. Apart from training from scratch, an\nefficient way is to utilize the pre-trained image-LLMs, leading to two\nmainstream approaches, i.e. zero-shot inference and further fine-tuning with\nvideo data. In this work, our study of these approaches harvests an effective\ndata augmentation method. We first make a deeper inspection of the zero-shot\ninference way and identify two limitations, i.e. limited generalization and\nlack of temporal understanding capabilities. Thus, we further investigate the\nfine-tuning approach and find a low learning efficiency when simply using all\nthe video data samples, which can be attributed to a lack of instruction\ndiversity. Aiming at this issue, we develop a method called T2Vid to synthesize\nvideo-like samples to enrich the instruction diversity in the training corpus.\nIntegrating these data enables a simple and efficient training scheme, which\nachieves performance comparable to or even superior to using full video\ndatasets by training with just 15% the sample size. Meanwhile, we find that the\nproposed scheme can boost the performance of long video understanding without\ntraining with long video samples. We hope our study will spark more thinking\nabout using MLLMs for video understanding and curation of high-quality data.\nThe code is released at https://github.com/xjtupanda/T2Vid.",

In this study, we introduce VersaTune, a novel\ndata composition framework designed for enhancing LLMs' overall multi-ability\nperformances during training. We categorize knowledge into distinct domains\nincluding law, medicine, finance, science, code, etc. We begin with detecting\nthe distribution of domain-specific knowledge within the base model, followed\nby the training data composition that aligns with the model's existing\nknowledge distribution. During the training process, domain weights are\ndynamically adjusted based on their learnable potential and forgetting degree.\nExperimental results demonstrate that VersaTune achieves significant\nimprovements in multi-domain performance, with an 35.21% enhancement in\ncomprehensive multi-domain tasks. Additionally, in scenarios where specific\ndomain optimization is required, VersaTune reduces the degradation of\nperformance in other domains by 38.77%, without compromising the target\ndomain's training efficacy.",

In this study, we introduce VersaTune, a novel\ndata composition framework designed for enhancing LLMs' overall multi-ability\nperformances during training. We categorize knowledge into distinct domains\nincluding law, medicine, finance, science, code, etc. We begin with detecting\nthe distribution of domain-specific knowledge within the base model, followed\nby the training data composition that aligns with the model's existing\nknowledge distribution. During the training process, domain weights are\ndynamically adjusted based on their learnable potential and forgetting degree.\nExperimental results demonstrate that VersaTune achieves significant\nimprovements in multi-domain performance, with an 35.21% enhancement in\ncomprehensive multi-domain tasks. Additionally, in scenarios where specific\ndomain optimization is required, VersaTune reduces the degradation of\nperformance in other domains by 38.77%, without compromising the target\ndomain's training efficacy."

Our work\nfundamentally challenges the \"static-environment\" notion of prior ObjectNav\nwork; the code and dataset for P-ObjectNav will be made publicly available to\nfoster research on embodied navigation in dynamic scenes.

Existing methods that\nrely on aligning visual encoders with large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to\ntap into the extensive knowledge of VLMs, require large, computationally\nexpensive models and encounter training difficulties. Adapting VLMs with prompt\nlearning offers an alternative to direct alignment. However, fine-tuning on\ntask-specific datasets often leads to overfitting to seen classes and\nsuboptimal performance on unseen classes, due to the absence of unseen class\nlabels. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel prompt learning-based\nframework for Efficient Zero-Shot HOI detection (EZ-HOI).

Therefore, we design prompt learning for unseen classes\nusing information from related seen classes, with LLMs utilized to highlight\nthe differences between unseen and related seen classes. Quantitative\nevaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our EZ-HOI achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance across various zero-shot settings with only 10.35%\nto 33.95% of the trainable parameters compared to existing methods.

Modularization decompose the driving task into\nmodules such as perception, prediction, planning, and control, and train them\nseparately.

Consumer GPUs can no\nlonger fit the largest available models (50B+ parameters) and must offload them\nto RAM or SSD. When running with offloaded parameters, the inference engine can\nprocess batches of hundreds or thousands of tokens at the same time as just one\ntoken, making it a natural fit for speculative decoding. We propose SpecExec\n(Speculative Execution), a simple parallel decoding method that can generate up\nto 20 tokens per target model iteration for popular LLM families. It utilizes\nthe high spikiness of the token probabilities distribution in modern LLMs and a\nhigh degree of alignment between model output probabilities. SpecExec takes the\nmost probable tokens continuation from the draft model to build a \"cache\" tree\nfor the target model, which then gets validated in a single pass.

LLM4Mat-Bench contains about 1.9M crystal structures in total,\ncollected from 10 publicly available materials data sources, and 45 distinct\nproperties. LLM4Mat-Bench features different input modalities: crystal\ncomposition, CIF, and crystal text description, with 4.7M, 615.5M, and 3.1B\ntokens in total for each modality, respectively. We use LLM4Mat-Bench to\nfine-tune models with different sizes, including LLM-Prop and MatBERT, and\nprovide zero-shot and few-shot prompts to evaluate the property prediction\ncapabilities of LLM-chat-like models, including Llama, Gemma, and Mistral. The\nresults highlight the challenges of general-purpose LLMs in materials science\nand the need for task-specific predictive models and task-specific\ninstruction-tuned LLMs in materials property prediction.",

To address these issues, we propose a novel post-training quantization\napproach with adaptive scale in one-step diffusion (OSD) image SR, PassionSR.\nFirst, we simplify OSD model to two core components, UNet and Variational\nAutoencoder (VAE) by removing the CLIPEncoder. Secondly, we propose Learnable\nBoundary Quantizer (LBQ) and Learnable Equivalent Transformation (LET) to\noptimize the quantization process and manipulate activation distributions for\nbetter quantization. Finally, we design a Distributed Quantization Calibration\n(DQC) strategy that stabilizes the training of quantized parameters for rapid\nconvergence. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that PassionSR with 8-bit\nand 6-bit obtains comparable visual results with full-precision model.\nMoreover, our PassionSR achieves significant advantages over recent leading\nlow-bit quantization methods for image SR.

The translation involves two steps\nleveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). First, an LLM transforms instructions\ninto a Hierarchical Task Tree, capturing logical and temporal relations. Next,\na fine-tuned LLM converts sub-tasks into flat LTL formulas, which are\naggregated into hierarchical specifications, with the lowest level\ncorresponding to ordered robot actions. These specifications are then used with\noff-the-shelf planners. Our~\\acronym{} demonstrates the potential of LLMs in\nhierarchical reasoning for multi-robot task planning. Evaluations in simulation\nand real-world experiments with human participants show that~\\acronym{}\noutperforms existing methods, handling more complex instructions while\nachieving higher success rates and lower costs in task allocation and planning.\nAdditional details are available at https://nl2hltl2plan.github.io ."

Computational auditory scene\nanalysis, disentangling acoustic scenes by detecting and classifying events,\nfocuses on objective attributes of sounds, such as their category and temporal\ncharacteristics, ignoring their effects on people, such as the emotions they\nevoke within a context. To fill this gap, we propose the soundscape captioning\ntask, which enables automated soundscape analysis, thus avoiding\nlabour-intensive subjective ratings and surveys in conventional methods. With\nsoundscape captioning, context-aware descriptions are generated for soundscape\nby capturing the acoustic scene, event information, and the corresponding human\naffective qualities (AQs). To this end, we propose an automatic soundscape\ncaptioner (SoundSCaper) system composed of an acoustic model, i.e. SoundAQnet,\nand a large language model (LLM). SoundAQnet simultaneously models multi-scale\ninformation about acoustic scenes, events, and perceived AQs, while the LLM\ndescribes the soundscape with captions by parsing the information captured with\nSoundAQnet. The soundscape caption's quality is assessed by a jury of 16\naudio/soundscape experts. The average score (out of 5) of SoundSCaper-generated\ncaptions is lower than the score of captions generated by two soundscape\nexperts by 0.21 and 0.25, respectively, on the evaluation set and the\nmodel-unknown mixed external dataset with varying lengths and acoustic\nproperties, but the differences are not statistically significant. Overall, the\nproposed SoundSCaper shows promising performance, with captions generated being\ncomparable to those annotated by soundscape experts.

Humans can reason\nnot only from a problem to a solution but also in reverse, i.e., start from the\nsolution and reason towards the problem.

To enable Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform reverse thinking,\nwe introduce Reverse-Enhanced Thinking (RevThink), a framework composed of data\naugmentation and learning objectives. In RevThink, we augment the dataset by\ncollecting structured forward-backward reasoning from a teacher model,\nconsisting of: (1) the original question, (2) forward reasoning, (3) backward\nquestion, and (4) backward reasoning. We then employ three objectives to train\na smaller student model in a multi-task learning fashion: (a) generate forward\nreasoning from a question, (b) generate a backward question from a question,\nand (c) generate backward reasoning from the backward question. Experiments\nacross 12 datasets covering commonsense, math, and logical reasoning show an\naverage 13.53% improvement over the student model's zero-shot performance and a\n6.84% improvement over the strongest knowledge distillation baselines.\nMoreover, our method demonstrates sample efficiency -- using only 10% of the\ncorrect forward reasoning from the training data, it outperforms a standard\nfine-tuning method trained on 10x more forward reasoning. RevThink also\nexhibits strong generalization to out-of-distribution held-out datasets.",
