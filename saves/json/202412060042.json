This\nstudy examines electron-beam-induced heating effects on a model metal sample\n(iron), directly measuring the locally deposited electron beam energy with a\nMEMS-based heating device and validating these measurements through\nsimulations, including Monte Carlo and Finite Element methods. The analysis\nfocuses on the effects of various experimental parameters such as acceleration\nvoltage (from 5 to 30 kV), beam current (from 0.17 nA to 22 nA), dwell time\n(from 1$\\mu$s to 1ms) and sample tilt (0{\\deg} to 70{\\deg}). The findings\nreveal that local sample temperatures can increase by up to 70 {\\deg}C during\nEBSD experiments, primarily affected by the choice in beam current and\nacceleration voltage, with beam current having the most significant impact.",

This\nstudy examines electron-beam-induced heating effects on a model metal sample\n(iron), directly measuring the locally deposited electron beam energy with a\nMEMS-based heating device and validating these measurements through\nsimulations, including Monte Carlo and Finite Element methods. The analysis\nfocuses on the effects of various experimental parameters such as acceleration\nvoltage (from 5 to 30 kV), beam current (from 0.17 nA to 22 nA), dwell time\n(from 1$\\mu$s to 1ms) and sample tilt (0{\\deg} to 70{\\deg}). The findings\nreveal that local sample temperatures can increase by up to 70 {\\deg}C during\nEBSD experiments, primarily affected by the choice in beam current and\nacceleration voltage, with beam current having the most significant impact."

The data migration between storing\ntiers of HSS is the way to achieve the cost-performance goal. The bandwidth\ncontrol is to limit the maximum amount of data migration. Most of previous\nresearch about HSS focus on studying the data migration policy instead of\nbandwidth control. However, the recent research about cache and networking\noptimization suggest that the bandwidth control has significant impact on the\nsystem performance. Few previous work achieves a satisfactory bandwidth control\nin HSS since it is hard to control bandwidth for so many data migration tasks\nsimultaneously. In this paper, we first give a stochastic programming model to\nformalize the bandwidth control problem in HSS. Then we propose a\nlearning-aided bandwidth control policy for HSS, named \\Pascal{}, which learns\nto control the bandwidth of different data migration task in an cooperative\nway. We implement \\Pascal{} on a commercial HSS and compare it with three\nstrong baselines over a group of workloads. Our evaluation on the physical\nsystem shows that \\Pascal{} can effectively decrease 1.95X the tail latency and\ngreatly improve throughput stability (2X $\\downarrow$ throughput jitter), and\nmeanwhile keep the throughput at a relatively high level.",

It achieves exceptional performance, ranking 6th overall\non Chatbot Arena, with particularly strong results (2nd to 4th place) in\nspecialized categories including Chinese, Math, Coding, and Hard Prompts.\nYi-Lightning leverages an enhanced Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture,\nfeaturing advanced expert segmentation and routing mechanisms coupled with\noptimized KV-caching techniques. Our development process encompasses\ncomprehensive pre-training, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and reinforcement\nlearning from human feedback (RLHF), where we devise deliberate strategies for\nmulti-stage training, synthetic data construction, and reward modeling.\nFurthermore, we implement RAISE (Responsible AI Safety Engine), a\nfour-component framework to address safety issues across pre-training,\npost-training, and serving phases. Empowered by our scalable super-computing\ninfrastructure, all these innovations substantially reduce training, deployment\nand inference costs while maintaining high-performance standards. With further\nevaluations on public academic benchmarks, Yi-Lightning demonstrates\ncompetitive performance against top-tier LLMs, while we observe a notable\ndisparity between traditional, static benchmark results and real-world, dynamic\nhuman preferences. This observation prompts a critical reassessment of\nconventional benchmarks' utility in guiding the development of more intelligent\nand powerful AI systems for practical applications.

Nitrogen oxides ($\\mathrm{NO_x = NO_2 + NO}$) and\nvolatile organic compounds (VOCs), in the presence of sunlight, lead to ozone\nformation in the troposphere. When the rate of oxidant production, defined as\nthe sum of $\\mathrm{O_3}$ and $\\mathrm{NO_2}$, is faster than the rate of\n$\\mathrm{NO_x}$ production, a region is said to be $\\mathrm{NO_x}$limited, and\nozone formation will be limited by the concentration of $\\mathrm{NO_x}$ species\nin the region. The inverse of this situation makes the region VOC-limited.\nKnowing whether a region is $\\mathrm{NO_x}$-limited or VOC-limited can aid in\ngenerating effective mitigation strategies. Understanding the background or\nregional contributions to ozone in a region, whether from the transport of\nprecursors or of ozone, provides information about the lower limit for ozone\nconcentrations that a region can achieve through regulation of local\nprecursors. In this paper, measured oxidant and $\\mathrm{NO_x}$ concentrations\nare analyzed from 14 counties in the state of Utah to calculate the regional\nand local contributions to ozone for each region. This analysis is used to\ndetermine the nature of the atmosphere in each county by identifying whether\nthe region is VOC or $\\mathrm{NO_x}$-limited. Furthermore, this analysis is\nperformed for each county for the years 2012 and 2022 to assess changes in the\noxidative nature and quantify regional and local contributions to ozone over a\n10-year period. All studied counties--except for Washington County--in Utah\nwere found to be VOC-limited in 2012. This shifted in 2022, with most counties\nbeing either in a transitional state or $\\mathrm{NO_x}$-limited. Local\ncontributions to ozone increased in two major counties, Cache and Salt Lake\nCounties, but decreased in Carbon, Davis, Duchesne, Uinta, Utah, Washington,\nand Weber Counties. Generally, the regional contributions to oxidant\nconcentrations decreased across the state. A summertime spike in both regional\nand local contributions to oxidants was observed. Smoke from wildfires was\nfound to increase regional contributions to oxidants and shift the local regime\nto be more $\\mathrm{NO_x}$-limited.",

While SwiGLU\nactivations can be pruned based on magnitude, the resulting sparsity patterns\nare difficult to predict, rendering previous approaches ineffective. To\ncircumvent this issue, our work introduces Dynamic Input Pruning (DIP): a\npredictor-free dynamic sparsification approach, which preserves accuracy with\nminimal fine-tuning. DIP can further use lightweight LoRA adapters to regain\nsome performance lost during sparsification. Lastly, we describe a novel\ncache-aware masking strategy, which considers the cache state and activation\nmagnitude to further increase cache hit rate, improving LLM token rate on\nmobile devices. DIP outperforms other methods in terms of accuracy, memory and\nthroughput trade-offs across simulated hardware settings.

For optimizer states, we\nintroduce a dynamic quantization approach that replaces the original 32-bit\nfloating-point values with a dynamic tree-based 8-bit data type. Experimental\nresults on VoxCeleb demonstrate that the reversible variants of ResNets and\nDF-ResNets can perform training without the need to cache activations in GPU\nmemory. In addition, the 8-bit versions of SGD and Adam save 75% of memory\ncosts while maintaining performance compared to their 32-bit counterparts.\nFinally, a detailed comparison of memory usage and performance indicates that\nour proposed models achieve up to 16.2x memory savings, with nearly identical\nparameters and performance compared to the vanilla systems.

To address the limited resources\nof IIoT sensor devices, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted mobile edge\ncomputing (MEC) has emerged as a promising solution, providing flexible and\ncost-effective services in close proximity of IIoT sensor devices (ISDs).\nHowever, leveraging aerial MEC to meet the delay-sensitive and\ncomputation-intensive requirements of the ISDs could face several challenges,\nincluding the limited communication, computation and caching (3C) resources,\nstringent offloading requirements for 3C services, and constrained on-board\nenergy of UAVs. To address these issues, we first present a collaborative\naerial MEC-assisted ICPS architecture by incorporating the computing\ncapabilities of the macro base station (MBS) and UAVs. We then formulate a\nservice delay minimization optimization problem (SDMOP). Since the SDMOP is\nproved to be an NP-hard problem, we propose a joint computation offloading,\ncaching, communication resource allocation, computation resource allocation,\nand UAV trajectory control approach (JC5A). Specifically, JC5A consists of a\nblock successive upper bound minimization method of multipliers (BSUMM) for\ncomputation offloading and service caching, a convex optimization-based method\nfor communication and computation resource allocation, and a successive convex\napproximation (SCA)-based method for UAV trajectory control. Moreover, we\ntheoretically prove the convergence and polynomial complexity of JC5A.\nSimulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach can achieve superior\nsystem performance compared to the benchmark approaches and algorithms.",

It utilizes\nthe high spikiness of the token probabilities distribution in modern LLMs and a\nhigh degree of alignment between model output probabilities. SpecExec takes the\nmost probable tokens continuation from the draft model to build a \"cache\" tree\nfor the target model, which then gets validated in a single pass.

However, as the resolution and duration\nof generated videos increase, the encoding cost of Video VAEs becomes a\nlimiting bottleneck in training LVDMs. Moreover, the block-wise inference\nmethod adopted by most LVDMs can lead to discontinuities of latent space when\nprocessing long-duration videos.

Experimental results show that our method\nachieves up to 35.8% lower latency and 46.2% higher throughput during decoding\ncompared to state-of-the-art approaches."

While prior methods have shown effectiveness in\naddressing distribution shift by adjusting classification logits, they are not\noptimal due to keeping text features unchanged. To address this issue, we\nintroduce a new approach called Test-time Alignment-Enhanced Adapter (TAEA),\nwhich trains an adapter with test samples to adjust text features during the\ntest phase. We can enhance the text-to-image alignment prediction by utilizing\nan adapter to adapt text features. Furthermore, we also propose to adopt the\nnegative cache from TDA as enhancement module, which further improves the\nperformance of TAEA. Our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art TTA method\nof pre-trained VLMs by an average of 0.75% on the out-of-distribution benchmark\nand 2.5% on the cross-domain benchmark, with an acceptable training time.

While prior methods have shown effectiveness in\naddressing distribution shift by adjusting classification logits, they are not\noptimal due to keeping text features unchanged. To address this issue, we\nintroduce a new approach called Test-time Alignment-Enhanced Adapter (TAEA),\nwhich trains an adapter with test samples to adjust text features during the\ntest phase. We can enhance the text-to-image alignment prediction by utilizing\nan adapter to adapt text features. Furthermore, we also propose to adopt the\nnegative cache from TDA as enhancement module, which further improves the\nperformance of TAEA. Our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art TTA method\nof pre-trained VLMs by an average of 0.75% on the out-of-distribution benchmark\nand 2.5% on the cross-domain benchmark, with an acceptable training time.

The leave-one-out\n(LOO) error, which measures the change in the likelihood of the LLM's response\nwhen a given span of the context is removed, provides a principled way to\nperform context attribution, but can be prohibitively expensive to compute for\nlarge models. In this work, we introduce AttriBoT, a series of novel techniques\nfor efficiently computing an approximation of the LOO error for context\nattribution. Specifically, AttriBoT uses cached activations to avoid redundant\noperations, performs hierarchical attribution to reduce computation, and\nemulates the behavior of large target models with smaller proxy models. Taken\ntogether, AttriBoT can provide a >300x speedup while remaining more faithful to\na target model's LOO error than prior context attribution methods. This stark\nincrease in performance makes computing context attributions for a given\nresponse 30x faster than generating the response itself, empowering real-world\napplications that require computing attributions at scale. We release a\nuser-friendly and efficient implementation of AttriBoT to enable efficient LLM\ninterpretability as well as encourage future development of efficient context\nattribution methods.",

The leave-one-out\n(LOO) error, which measures the change in the likelihood of the LLM's response\nwhen a given span of the context is removed, provides a principled way to\nperform context attribution, but can be prohibitively expensive to compute for\nlarge models. In this work, we introduce AttriBoT, a series of novel techniques\nfor efficiently computing an approximation of the LOO error for context\nattribution. Specifically, AttriBoT uses cached activations to avoid redundant\noperations, performs hierarchical attribution to reduce computation, and\nemulates the behavior of large target models with smaller proxy models. Taken\ntogether, AttriBoT can provide a >300x speedup while remaining more faithful to\na target model's LOO error than prior context attribution methods. This stark\nincrease in performance makes computing context attributions for a given\nresponse 30x faster than generating the response itself, empowering real-world\napplications that require computing attributions at scale. We release a\nuser-friendly and efficient implementation of AttriBoT to enable efficient LLM\ninterpretability as well as encourage future development of efficient context\nattribution methods."

Although there are various\ntechniques to calculate the reuse profile from dynamic memory traces, it is\nboth time and space-consuming due to the requirement to collect dynamic memory\ntraces at runtime. In contrast, static analysis reuse profile estimation is a\npromisingly faster approach since it is calculated at compile time without\nrunning the program or collecting memory traces. This work presents a static\nanalysis technique to estimate the reuse profile of loop-based programs. For an\ninput program, we generate a basic block-level control flow graph and the\nexecution count by analyzing the LLVM IR of the program. We present the memory\naccesses of the application kernel in a compact bracketed format and use a\nrecursive algorithm to predict the reuse distance histogram. We deploy a\nseparate predictor that unrolls the loop(s) for smaller bounds and generates a\ntemporary reuse distance profile for those small cases. Using these smaller\nprofiles, the reuse profile is extrapolated for the actual loop bound(s). We\nuse this reuse profile to predict the cache hit rate. Results show that our\nmodel can predict cache hit rates with an average accuracy of 95% relative to\nthe dynamic reuse profile methods.",

However,\nprevious works focus on extracting features either from the time domain or the\nfrequency domain, which inadequately captures the trends and periodic\ncharacteristics. To address this issue, we propose a wavelet learning framework\nto model complex temporal dependencies of the time series data. The wavelet\ndomain integrates both time and frequency information, allowing for the\nanalysis of local characteristics of signals at different scales. Additionally,\nthe Softmax self-attention mechanism used by Transformers has quadratic\ncomplexity, which leads to excessive computational costs when capturing\nlong-term dependencies. Therefore, we propose a novel attention mechanism:\nRotary Route Attention (RoRA). Unlike Softmax attention, RoRA utilizes rotary\nposition embeddings to inject relative positional information to sequence\ntokens and introduces a small number of routing tokens $r$ to aggregate\ninformation from the $KV$ matrices and redistribute it to the $Q$ matrix,\noffering linear complexity. We further propose WaveRoRA, which leverages RoRA\nto capture inter-series dependencies in the wavelet domain. We conduct\nextensive experiments on eight real-world datasets. The results indicate that\nWaveRoRA outperforms existing state-of-the-art models while maintaining lower\ncomputational costs. Our code is available at\nhttps://github.com/Leopold2333/WaveRoRA.",

The beam\ncould be modulated and the maximum overall duration was 50 ms. With the upgrade\nof RFX-mod to the present RFX-mod2 machine, the DNBI is being renovated to\nsolve several plant faults and improve the overall reliability of the system.\nThe 50 kV power supply is being improved, as well as the power supplies in the\nhigh voltage deck and its insulation transformer.

Bi-Mamba\nmodels are trained from scratch on data volume as regular LLM pertaining using\nan autoregressive distillation loss. Extensive experimental results on language\nmodeling demonstrate that Bi-Mamba achieves performance comparable to its\nfull-precision counterparts (e.g., FP16 or BF16) and much better accuracy than\npost-training-binarization (PTB) Mamba baselines, while significantly reducing\nmemory footprint and energy consumption compared to the original Mamba model.\nOur study pioneers a new linear computational complexity LLM framework under\nlow-bit representation and facilitates the future design of specialized\nhardware tailored for efficient 1-bit Mamba-based LLMs."

The encouraging results, however, come with the\ncost of slow inference, since each denoising step requires inference on a\ntransformer model with a large scale of parameters. In this study, we make an\ninteresting and somehow surprising observation: the computation of a large\nproportion of layers in the diffusion transformer, through introducing a\ncaching mechanism, can be readily removed even without updating the model\nparameters. In the case of U-ViT-H/2, for example, we may remove up to 93.68%\nof the computation in the cache steps (46.84% for all steps), with less than\n0.01 drop in FID. To achieve this, we introduce a novel scheme, named\nLearning-to-Cache (L2C), that learns to conduct caching in a dynamic manner for\ndiffusion transformers. Specifically, by leveraging the identical structure of\nlayers in transformers and the sequential nature of diffusion, we explore\nredundant computations between timesteps by treating each layer as the\nfundamental unit for caching. To address the challenge of the exponential\nsearch space in deep models for identifying layers to cache and remove, we\npropose a novel differentiable optimization objective. An input-invariant yet\ntimestep-variant router is then optimized, which can finally produce a static\ncomputation graph. Experimental results show that L2C largely outperforms\nsamplers such as DDIM and DPM-Solver, alongside prior cache-based methods at\nthe same inference speed.

Specifically, by leveraging the identical structure of\nlayers in transformers and the sequential nature of diffusion, we explore\nredundant computations between timesteps by treating each layer as the\nfundamental unit for caching. To address the challenge of the exponential\nsearch space in deep models for identifying layers to cache and remove, we\npropose a novel differentiable optimization objective. An input-invariant yet\ntimestep-variant router is then optimized, which can finally produce a static\ncomputation graph. Experimental results show that L2C largely outperforms\nsamplers such as DDIM and DPM-Solver, alongside prior cache-based methods at\nthe same inference speed.

With its extended capacity, Pie\noutperforms vLLM by up to 1.9X in throughput and 2X in latency. Additionally,\nPie can reduce GPU memory usage by up to 1.67X while maintaining the same\nperformance.

To evaluate our technique, we conduct experiments on\nResNet-18 and VGG-small CiM-BNNs designed at the 7nm technology node using\n8T-SRAM and 1T-1ReRAM. Our results show that BinSparX is highly effective in\nalleviating the impact of non-idealities, recouping the inference accuracy to\nnear-ideal (software) levels in some cases and providing accuracy boost of up\nto 77.25%.

Further, we find that bias transfer\nremains strongly correlated even when LLMs are specifically prompted to exhibit\nfair or biased behavior (rho >= 0.92), and few-shot length and stereotypical\ncomposition are varied (rho >= 0.97).

In this paper, we propose NVComposer, a novel approach that\neliminates the need for explicit external alignment. NVComposer enables the\ngenerative model to implicitly infer spatial and geometric relationships\nbetween multiple conditional views by introducing two key components: 1) an\nimage-pose dual-stream diffusion model that simultaneously generates target\nnovel views and condition camera poses, and 2) a geometry-aware feature\nalignment module that distills geometric priors from dense stereo models during\ntraining. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NVComposer achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance in generative multi-view NVS tasks, removing the\nreliance on external alignment and thus improving model accessibility. Our\napproach shows substantial improvements in synthesis quality as the number of\nunposed input views increases, highlighting its potential for more flexible and\naccessible generative NVS systems.",

Collectively, Cambrian-1 not only achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance but also serves as a comprehensive, open cookbook\nfor instruction-tuned MLLMs. We provide model weights, code, supporting tools,\ndatasets, and detailed instruction-tuning and evaluation recipes.

We use simple models to demonstrate\nthat the vertical thickness of an isothermal layer around the disk midplane has\nimportant effects on the CO column density radial profile, with a thick layer\nproducing a sharp CO snowline transition. We simulate ngVLA and ALMA images to\nshow that this sharp change in CO column density can be detected in the\nderivative of the radial profile of emission from optically thin CO\nisotopologue lines. We apply this method to archival ALMA observations of the\ndisk around the Herbig Ae star HD 163296 in the C$^{17}$O and C$^{18}$O J=1-0\nand J=2-1 lines to identify a sharp CO snowline transition near 80 au (0.8\narcsec at 101 pc), and show the CO column density decreases by more than a\nfactor of 20. This finding is consistent with previous inferences from the\nsteep rise of N$_2$H$^+$ emission, which marks the location where CO depletes.\nWe also demonstrate that the disk's thermal structure introduces a significant\nsystematic uncertainty to estimates of total disk gas mass derived from these\nlines. The substantial improvement in sensitivity envisioned for the ngVLA over\nALMA for observations of ground-state lines of CO isotopologues has the\npotential to extend this approach to a much larger population of disks.",

First, the impact of multimodal\nlearning varies between Vicuna and Mistral: we observe a degradation in\nlanguage reasoning for Mistral but improvements for Vicuna across most tasks.\nSecond, while multimodal instruction learning consistently degrades performance\non mathematical reasoning tasks (e.g., GSM8K), it enhances performance on\ncommonsense reasoning tasks (e.g., CommonsenseQA). Finally, we demonstrate that\na training-free model merging technique can effectively mitigate the language\nreasoning degradation observed in multimodal-adapted Mistral and even improve\nperformance on visual tasks.",

The latter ability is\nessential for tackling complex arithmetic and mathematical problems and serves\nas a foundation for most reasoning tasks, but previous work paid little\nattention to it or only discussed several restricted tasks (like integer\naddition). In this paper, we comprehensively investigate the numerical\nunderstanding and processing ability (NUPA) of LLMs. Firstly, we introduce a\nbenchmark covering four common numerical representations and 17 distinct\nnumerical tasks in four major categories, resulting in 41 meaningful\ncombinations in total. These tasks are derived from primary and secondary\neducation curricula, encompassing nearly all everyday numerical understanding\nand processing scenarios, and the rules of these tasks are very simple and\nclear. Through the benchmark, we find that current LLMs fail frequently in many\nof the tasks. To study the problem, we train small models with existing and\npotential techniques for enhancing NUPA (such as tokenizers, PEs, and number\nformats), comprehensively evaluating their effectiveness using our testbed. We\nalso finetune practical-scale LLMs on our proposed NUPA tasks and find that 1)\nnaive finetuning can improve NUPA a lot on many but not all tasks, and 2)\nsurprisingly, techniques designed to enhance NUPA prove ineffective for\nfinetuning pretrained models. We further explore the impact of chain-of-thought\ntechniques on NUPA. Our work provides a more detailed and comprehensive\nunderstanding of NUPA in LLMs. Our benchmark and code are released at\nhttps://github.com/GraphPKU/number_cookbook.",

However, these models incur significant computational and memory\noverhead during inference, which greatly hinders the efficient deployment in\npractical scenarios. The extensive key-value (KV) cache, necessitated by the\nlengthy input and output sequences, notably contributes to the high inference\ncost. Based on this, recent works have investigated ways to reduce the KV cache\nsize for higher efficiency. Although effective, they generally overlook the\ndistinct importance distributions of KV vectors across layers and maintain the\nsame cache size for each layer during the next token prediction. This results\nin the significant contextual information loss for certain layers, leading to\nnotable performance decline. To address this, we present PrefixKV. It reframes\nthe challenge of determining KV cache sizes for all layers into the task of\nsearching for the optimal global prefix configuration. With an adaptive\nlayer-wise KV retention recipe based on binary search, the maximum contextual\ninformation can thus be preserved in each layer, facilitating the generation.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves the state-of-the-art\nperformance compared with others.

Functionality understanding is highly\nchallenging, as it requires both world knowledge to interpret language and\nspatial perception to identify fine-grained objects. For example, given a task\nlike 'turn on the ceiling light', an embodied AI agent must infer that it needs\nto locate the light switch, even though the switch is not explicitly mentioned\nin the task description. To date, no dedicated methods have been developed for\nthis problem. In this paper, we introduce Fun3DU, the first approach designed\nfor functionality understanding in 3D scenes. Fun3DU uses a language model to\nparse the task description through Chain-of-Thought reasoning in order to\nidentify the object of interest. The identified object is segmented across\nmultiple views of the captured scene by using a vision and language model. The\nsegmentation results from each view are lifted in 3D and aggregated into the\npoint cloud using geometric information. Fun3DU is training-free, relying\nentirely on pre-trained models. We evaluate Fun3DU on SceneFun3D, the most\nrecent and only dataset to benchmark this task, which comprises over 3000 task\ndescriptions on 230 scenes.

While building a\nvoxel map through a hierarchical structure can refine exteroception processing,\nit introduces significant computational overhead, noise, and delays. In this\npaper, we present MOVE, a one-stage end-to-end learning framework capable of\nmulti-skill omnidirectional legged locomotion with limited view in 3D\nenvironments, just like what a real animal can do. When movement aligns with\nthe robot's line of sight, exteroceptive perception enhances locomotion,\nenabling extreme climbing and leaping. When vision is obstructed or the\ndirection of movement lies outside the robot's field of view, the robot relies\non proprioception for tasks like crawling and climbing stairs. We integrate all\nthese skills into a single neural network by introducing a pseudo-siamese\nnetwork structure combining supervised and contrastive learning which helps the\nrobot infer its surroundings beyond its field of view.

In this study, we introduce a lightweight masked language model,\ntermed tcrLM, to address this challenge.

To\nfurther enhance robustness, we incorporate virtual adversarial training into\ntcrLM. We construct the largest TCR CDR3 sequence set with more than 100\nmillion distinct sequences, and pretrain tcrLM on these sequences. The\npre-trained encoder is subsequently applied to predict TCR-antigen binding\nspecificity. We evaluate model performance on three test datasets: independent,\nexternal, and COVID-19 test set. The results demonstrate that tcrLM not only\nsurpasses existing TCR-antigen binding prediction methods, but also outperforms\nother mainstream protein language models. More interestingly, tcrLM effectively\ncaptures the biochemical properties and positional preference of amino acids\nwithin TCR sequences.

                "summary": "Understanding travelers' route choices can help policymakers devise optimal\noperational and planning strategies for both normal and abnormal circumstances.\nHowever, existing choice modeling methods often rely on predefined assumptions\nand struggle to capture the dynamic and adaptive nature of travel behavior.\nRecently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative,\ndemonstrating remarkable ability to replicate human-like behaviors across\nvarious fields. Despite this potential, their capacity to accurately simulate\nhuman route choice behavior in transportation contexts remains doubtful.

Finally, we offer a suite of\nmethods grounded in the paradigm, striking a balance between speed and accuracy\nthroughout different phases of the inference. Experimental results across 10\nbenchmarks indicate that our methods can achieve up to an 82.4% reduction in\nFLOPs with a minimal impact on performance, simultaneously surpassing\nstate-of-the-art training-free methods.

Central to our approach is a next-token prediction\nobjective, enabling the model to reason effectively over the user's query in\nthe context of current observations. Subsequently, a diffusion model is\nattached to generate robust action outputs. To enhance policy learning through\nself-reasoning, we introduce a novel reasoning injection module that integrates\nreasoning phrases directly into the policy learning process. The whole\nframework is simple and flexible, making it easy to deploy and upgrade. We\nconduct extensive experiments using multiple real robots to validate the\neffectiveness of DiffusionVLA. Our tests include a challenging factory sorting\ntask, where DiffusionVLA successfully categorizes objects, including those not\nseen during training. We observe that the reasoning module makes the model\ninterpretable. It allows observers to understand the model thought process and\nidentify potential causes of policy failures. Additionally, we test\nDiffusionVLA on a zero-shot bin-picking task, achieving 63.7\\% accuracy on 102\npreviously unseen objects. Our method demonstrates robustness to visual\nchanges, such as distractors and new backgrounds, and easily adapts to new\nembodiments. Furthermore, DiffusionVLA can follow novel instructions and retain\nconversational ability. Notably, DiffusionVLA is data-efficient and fast at\ninference; our smallest DiffusionVLA-2B runs 82Hz on a single A6000 GPU and can\ntrain from scratch on less than 50 demonstrations for a complex task. Finally,\nwe scale the model from 2B to 72B parameters, showcasing improved\ngeneralization capabilities with increased model size.",

However, recent works have shown that prompting these models\nto look back and critique their own generations can produce useful feedback.\nMotivated by this, we explore the question of whether LLMs can be empowered to\nthink (predict and score) backwards to provide unsupervised feedback that\ncomplements forward LLMs. Towards this, we introduce Time Reversed Language\nModels (TRLMs), which can score and generate queries when conditioned on\nresponses, effectively functioning in the reverse direction of time. Further,\nto effectively infer in the response to query direction, we pre-train and\nfine-tune a language model (TRLM-Ba) in the reverse token order from scratch.\nWe show empirically (and theoretically in a stylized setting) that\ntime-reversed models can indeed complement forward model predictions when used\nto score the query given response for re-ranking multiple forward generations.\nWe obtain up to 5\\% improvement on the widely used AlpacaEval Leaderboard over\nthe competent baseline of best-of-N re-ranking using self log-perplexity\nscores. We further show that TRLM scoring outperforms conventional forward\nscoring of response given query, resulting in significant gains in applications\nsuch as citation generation and passage retrieval. We next leverage the\ngenerative ability of TRLM to augment or provide unsupervised feedback to input\nsafety filters of LLMs, demonstrating a drastic reduction in false negative\nrate with negligible impact on false positive rates against several attacks\npublished on the popular JailbreakBench leaderboard.",

However, recent works have shown that prompting these models\nto look back and critique their own generations can produce useful feedback.\nMotivated by this, we explore the question of whether LLMs can be empowered to\nthink (predict and score) backwards to provide unsupervised feedback that\ncomplements forward LLMs. Towards this, we introduce Time Reversed Language\nModels (TRLMs), which can score and generate queries when conditioned on\nresponses, effectively functioning in the reverse direction of time. Further,\nto effectively infer in the response to query direction, we pre-train and\nfine-tune a language model (TRLM-Ba) in the reverse token order from scratch.\nWe show empirically (and theoretically in a stylized setting) that\ntime-reversed models can indeed complement forward model predictions when used\nto score the query given response for re-ranking multiple forward generations.\nWe obtain up to 5\\% improvement on the widely used AlpacaEval Leaderboard over\nthe competent baseline of best-of-N re-ranking using self log-perplexity\nscores. We further show that TRLM scoring outperforms conventional forward\nscoring of response given query, resulting in significant gains in applications\nsuch as citation generation and passage retrieval. We next leverage the\ngenerative ability of TRLM to augment or provide unsupervised feedback to input\nsafety filters of LLMs, demonstrating a drastic reduction in false negative\nrate with negligible impact on false positive rates against several attacks\npublished on the popular JailbreakBench leaderboard."

DualAD comprises two layers: a rule-based\nmotion planner at the bottom layer that handles routine driving tasks requiring\nminimal reasoning, and an upper layer featuring a rule-based text encoder that\nconverts driving scenarios from absolute states into text description. This\ntext is then processed by a large language model (LLM) to make driving\ndecisions. The upper layer intervenes in the bottom layer's decisions when\npotential danger is detected, mimicking human reasoning in critical situations.\nClosed-loop experiments demonstrate that DualAD, using a zero-shot pre-trained\nmodel, significantly outperforms rule-based motion planners that lack reasoning\nabilities. Our experiments also highlight the effectiveness of the text\nencoder, which considerably enhances the model's scenario understanding.\nAdditionally, the integrated DualAD model improves with stronger LLMs,\nindicating the framework's potential for further enhancement.

                    "value": "We present a novel autonomous driving framework, DualAD, designed to imitate\nhuman reasoning during driving. DualAD comprises two layers: a rule-based\nmotion planner at the bottom layer that handles routine driving tasks requiring\nminimal reasoning, and an upper layer featuring a rule-based text encoder that\nconverts driving scenarios from absolute states into text description. This\ntext is then processed by a large language model (LLM) to make driving\ndecisions. The upper layer intervenes in the bottom layer's decisions when\npotential danger is detected, mimicking human reasoning in critical situations.\nClosed-loop experiments demonstrate that DualAD, using a zero-shot pre-trained\nmodel, significantly outperforms rule-based motion planners that lack reasoning\nabilities. Our experiments also highlight the effectiveness of the text\nencoder, which considerably enhances the model's scenario understanding.\nAdditionally, the integrated DualAD model improves with stronger LLMs,\nindicating the framework's potential for further enhancement. Code and\nbenchmarks are available at github.com/TUM-AVS/DualAD."

The observed migration patterns of microseismicity in the\nfirst example and slow slip in the second example resemble diffusion processes\nbut involve diffusivity values that differ significantly from the fault\nhydraulic diffusivity. These results support the conclusion that the\nmicroseismicity front is not a direct proxy for the fluid diffusion front and\ncannot be used to directly infer hydraulic diffusivity, consistently with some\ndecametric scale in-situ experiments of fault activation under controlled\nconditions.

MTL\nnot only reduces training and inference time as opposed to having multiple\nsingle-task models, but also enhances task accuracy through the interaction of\nmultiple tasks. However, existing methods face limitations. They often rely on\nsuboptimal cross-task interactions, resulting in task-specific predictions with\npoor geometric and predictive coherence. In addition, many approaches use\ninadequate loss weighting strategies, which do not address the inherent\nvariability in task evolution during training. To overcome these challenges, we\npropose an advanced MTL model specifically designed for dense vision tasks. Our\nmodel leverages state-of-the-art vision transformers with task-specific\ndecoders. To enhance cross-task coherence, we introduce a trace-back method\nthat improves both cross-task geometric and predictive features. Furthermore,\nwe present a novel dynamic task balancing approach that projects task losses\nonto a common scale and prioritizes more challenging tasks during training.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method, establishing\nnew state-of-the-art performance across two benchmark datasets.

In this paper, we introduce VisionFuse, a novel integration\nframework that efficiently utilizes multiple vision encoders from off-the-shelf\nMLLMs to enhance visual perception without requiring additional training.

Building on these\ninsights, VisionFuse enriches the visual context by concatenating the tokens\ngenerated by the vision encoders of selected MLLMs within a family. By merging\nthe parameters of language models from these MLLMs, VisionFuse allows a single\nlanguage model to align with various vision encoders, significantly reducing\ndeployment overhead.

We find\nthat the best LLMs (Claude and GPT-4) rank in the 52nd percentile against\nhumans, and overall LLMs excel in divergent thinking and problem solving but\nlag in creative writing. When questioned 10 times, an LLM's collective\ncreativity is equivalent to 8-10 humans. When more responses are requested, two\nadditional responses of LLMs equal one extra human. Ultimately, LLMs, when\noptimally applied, may compete with a small group of humans in the future of\nwork.",

To measure the creativity of LLMs\nholistically, the current study uses 13 creative tasks spanning three domains.\nWe benchmark the LLMs against individual humans, and also take a novel approach\nby comparing them to the collective creativity of groups of humans. We find\nthat the best LLMs (Claude and GPT-4) rank in the 52nd percentile against\nhumans, and overall LLMs excel in divergent thinking and problem solving but\nlag in creative writing. When questioned 10 times, an LLM's collective\ncreativity is equivalent to 8-10 humans. When more responses are requested, two\nadditional responses of LLMs equal one extra human. Ultimately, LLMs, when\noptimally applied, may compete with a small group of humans in the future of\nwork."

DCVSMNet is a fast stereo matching network\nwith a 67 ms inference time and strong generalization ability which can produce\ncompetitive results compared to state-of-the-art methods. The results on\nseveral bench mark datasets show that DCVSMNet achieves better accuracy than\nmethods such as CGI-Stereo and BGNet at the cost of greater inference time."

Traditional\napproaches to verifiable FHE require expensive cryptographic proofs, which\nincur an overhead of up to seven orders of magnitude on top of FHE, making them\nimpractical.\n  With Argos, we show that trusted hardware can be securely used to provide\nverifiability for FHE computations, with minimal overhead relative to the\nbaseline FHE computation. An important contribution of Argos is showing that\nthe major security pitfall associated with trusted hardware, microarchitectural\nside channels, can be completely mitigated by excluding any secrets from the\nCPU and the memory hierarchy. This is made possible by focusing on building a\nplatform that only enforces program and data integrity and not confidentiality\n(which is sufficient for verifiable FHE, since all data remain encrypted at all\ntimes). All secrets related to the attestation mechanism are kept in a separate\ncoprocessor (e.g., a TPM) inaccessible to any software-based attacker. Relying\non a discrete TPM typically incurs significant performance overhead, which is\nwhy (insecure) software-based TPMs are used in practice. As a second\ncontribution, we show that for FHE applications, the attestation protocol can\nbe adapted to only incur a fixed cost.\n  Argos requires no dedicated hardware extensions and is supported on commodity\nprocessors from 2008 onward. Our prototype implementation introduces 6%\noverhead to the FHE evaluation, and 8% for more complex protocols. In\nparticular, we show that Argos can be adapted for real-world applications of\nFHE, such as PIR and PSI.

                    "value": "We present Argos, a simple approach for adding verifiability to fully\nhomomorphic encryption (FHE) schemes using trusted hardware. Traditional\napproaches to verifiable FHE require expensive cryptographic proofs, which\nincur an overhead of up to seven orders of magnitude on top of FHE, making them\nimpractical.\n  With Argos, we show that trusted hardware can be securely used to provide\nverifiability for FHE computations, with minimal overhead relative to the\nbaseline FHE computation. An important contribution of Argos is showing that\nthe major security pitfall associated with trusted hardware, microarchitectural\nside channels, can be completely mitigated by excluding any secrets from the\nCPU and the memory hierarchy. This is made possible by focusing on building a\nplatform that only enforces program and data integrity and not confidentiality\n(which is sufficient for verifiable FHE, since all data remain encrypted at all\ntimes). All secrets related to the attestation mechanism are kept in a separate\ncoprocessor (e.g., a TPM) inaccessible to any software-based attacker. Relying\non a discrete TPM typically incurs significant performance overhead, which is\nwhy (insecure) software-based TPMs are used in practice. As a second\ncontribution, we show that for FHE applications, the attestation protocol can\nbe adapted to only incur a fixed cost.\n  Argos requires no dedicated hardware extensions and is supported on commodity\nprocessors from 2008 onward. Our prototype implementation introduces 6%\noverhead to the FHE evaluation, and 8% for more complex protocols. In\nparticular, we show that Argos can be adapted for real-world applications of\nFHE, such as PIR and PSI. By demonstrating how to combine cryptography with\ntrusted hardware, Argos paves the way for widespread deployment of FHE-based\nprotocols beyond the semi-honest setting, without the overhead of cryptographic\nproofs."

It plays a key role in the\ndevelopment of educational technology systems and is traditionally rooted in\ndeterministic feedback defined by experts and their experience. However, with\nthe rise of generative AI and especially Large Language Models (LLMs), we\nexpect feedback as part of learning systems to transform, especially for the\ncontext of programming. In the past, it was challenging to automate feedback\nfor learners of programming. LLMs may create new possibilities to provide\nricher, and more individual feedback than ever before.\n  Objectives: This paper aims to generate specific types of feedback for\nintroductory programming tasks using LLMs. We revisit existing feedback\ntaxonomies to capture the specifics of the generated feedback, such as\nrandomness, uncertainty, and degrees of variation.\n  Methods: We iteratively designed prompts for the generation of specific\nfeedback types (as part of existing feedback taxonomies) in response to\nauthentic student programs. We then evaluated the generated output and\ndetermined to what extent it reflected certain feedback types.\n  Results and Conclusion: The present work provides a better understanding of\ndifferent feedback dimensions and characteristics. The results have\nimplications for future feedback research with regard to, for example, feedback\neffects and learners' informational needs. It further provides a basis for the\ndevelopment of new tools and learning systems for novice programmers including\nfeedback generated by AI.",

LLMs may create new possibilities to provide\nricher, and more individual feedback than ever before.\n  Objectives: This paper aims to generate specific types of feedback for\nintroductory programming tasks using LLMs. We revisit existing feedback\ntaxonomies to capture the specifics of the generated feedback, such as\nrandomness, uncertainty, and degrees of variation.\n  Methods: We iteratively designed prompts for the generation of specific\nfeedback types (as part of existing feedback taxonomies) in response to\nauthentic student programs. We then evaluated the generated output and\ndetermined to what extent it reflected certain feedback types.\n  Results and Conclusion: The present work provides a better understanding of\ndifferent feedback dimensions and characteristics. The results have\nimplications for future feedback research with regard to, for example, feedback\neffects and learners' informational needs. It further provides a basis for the\ndevelopment of new tools and learning systems for novice programmers including\nfeedback generated by AI."

However, these SAEs can have millions\nof distinct latent features, making it infeasible for humans to manually\ninterpret each one. In this work, we build an open-source automated pipeline to\ngenerate and evaluate natural language explanations for SAE features using\nLLMs. We test our framework on SAEs of varying sizes, activation functions, and\nlosses, trained on two different open-weight LLMs. We introduce five new\ntechniques to score the quality of explanations that are cheaper to run than\nthe previous state of the art. One of these techniques, intervention scoring,\nevaluates the interpretability of the effects of intervening on a feature,\nwhich we find explains features that are not recalled by existing methods. We\npropose guidelines for generating better explanations that remain valid for a\nbroader set of activating contexts, and discuss pitfalls with existing scoring\ntechniques. We use our explanations to measure the semantic similarity of\nindependently trained SAEs, and find that SAEs trained on nearby layers of the\nresidual stream are highly similar. Our large-scale analysis confirms that SAE\nlatents are indeed much more interpretable than neurons, even when neurons are\nsparsified using top-$k$ postprocessing.

The latter ability is\nessential for tackling complex arithmetic and mathematical problems and serves\nas a foundation for most reasoning tasks, but previous work paid little\nattention to it or only discussed several restricted tasks (like integer\naddition). In this paper, we comprehensively investigate the numerical\nunderstanding and processing ability (NUPA) of LLMs. Firstly, we introduce a\nbenchmark covering four common numerical representations and 17 distinct\nnumerical tasks in four major categories, resulting in 41 meaningful\ncombinations in total. These tasks are derived from primary and secondary\neducation curricula, encompassing nearly all everyday numerical understanding\nand processing scenarios, and the rules of these tasks are very simple and\nclear. Through the benchmark, we find that current LLMs fail frequently in many\nof the tasks. To study the problem, we train small models with existing and\npotential techniques for enhancing NUPA (such as tokenizers, PEs, and number\nformats), comprehensively evaluating their effectiveness using our testbed. We\nalso finetune practical-scale LLMs on our proposed NUPA tasks and find that 1)\nnaive finetuning can improve NUPA a lot on many but not all tasks, and 2)\nsurprisingly, techniques designed to enhance NUPA prove ineffective for\nfinetuning pretrained models.

While foundation models have demonstrated\nremarkable transfer capabilities across various domains, their effectiveness in\nhandling individual-specific physiological signals - crucial for precision\nmedicine - remains largely unexplored. This work introduces a systematic\npipeline for rapidly and efficiently evaluating foundation models' transfer\ncapabilities in medical contexts. Our pipeline employs a three-stage approach.\nFirst, it leverages physiological simulation software to generate diverse,\nclinically relevant scenarios, particularly focusing on data-scarce medical\nconditions. This simulation-based approach enables both targeted capability\nassessment and subsequent model fine-tuning. Second, the pipeline projects\nthese simulated signals through the foundation model to obtain embeddings,\nwhich are then evaluated using linear methods. This evaluation quantifies the\nmodel's ability to capture three critical aspects: physiological feature\nindependence, temporal dynamics preservation, and medical scenario\ndifferentiation. Finally, the pipeline validates these representations through\nspecific downstream medical tasks. Initial testing of our pipeline on the\nMoirai time series foundation model revealed significant limitations in\nphysiological signal processing, including feature entanglement, temporal\ndynamics distortion, and reduced scenario discrimination. These findings\nsuggest that current foundation models may require substantial architectural\nmodifications or targeted fine-tuning before deployment in clinical settings.",

While foundation models have demonstrated\nremarkable transfer capabilities across various domains, their effectiveness in\nhandling individual-specific physiological signals - crucial for precision\nmedicine - remains largely unexplored. This work introduces a systematic\npipeline for rapidly and efficiently evaluating foundation models' transfer\ncapabilities in medical contexts. Our pipeline employs a three-stage approach.\nFirst, it leverages physiological simulation software to generate diverse,\nclinically relevant scenarios, particularly focusing on data-scarce medical\nconditions. This simulation-based approach enables both targeted capability\nassessment and subsequent model fine-tuning. Second, the pipeline projects\nthese simulated signals through the foundation model to obtain embeddings,\nwhich are then evaluated using linear methods. This evaluation quantifies the\nmodel's ability to capture three critical aspects: physiological feature\nindependence, temporal dynamics preservation, and medical scenario\ndifferentiation. Finally, the pipeline validates these representations through\nspecific downstream medical tasks. Initial testing of our pipeline on the\nMoirai time series foundation model revealed significant limitations in\nphysiological signal processing, including feature entanglement, temporal\ndynamics distortion, and reduced scenario discrimination. These findings\nsuggest that current foundation models may require substantial architectural\nmodifications or targeted fine-tuning before deployment in clinical settings."

Our\ncomprehensive overview addresses three key research questions: the construction\nof cybersecurity-oriented LLMs, the application of LLMs to various\ncybersecurity tasks, the challenges and further research in this area. This\nstudy aims to shed light on the extensive potential of LLMs in enhancing\ncybersecurity practices and serve as a valuable resource for applying LLMs in\nthis field. We also maintain and regularly update a list of practical guides on\nLLMs for cybersecurity at https://github.com/tmylla/Awesome-LLM4Cybersecurity."

These procedures are not only complex but also\nprone to introducing noise and errors. In this paper, we propose an implicit\nfusion method, Weighted-Reward Preference Optimization (WRPO), which leverages\npreference optimization between the source LLMs and the target LLM to transfer\ntheir capabilities effectively. WRPO eliminates the need for vocabulary\nalignment and matrix fusion and can be efficiently scaled to accommodate\nvarious LLMs. To address distributional deviations between the source and\ntarget LLMs, WRPO introduces a progressive adaptation strategy that gradually\nshifts reliance on preferred examples from the target LLM to the source LLMs.\nExtensive experiments on the MT-Bench, AlpacaEval-2, and Arena-Hard benchmarks\ndemonstrate that WRPO consistently outperforms existing knowledge fusion\nmethods and various fine-tuning baselines. When applied to LLaMA3-8B-Instruct\nas the target model, WRPO achieves a length-controlled win rate of 55.9%\nagainst GPT-4-Preview-1106 on AlpacaEval-2 and a win rate of 46.2% against\nGPT-4-0314 on Arena-Hard.

Hence, we propose a novel\nProgressive Comprehension Network (PCNet) to leverage target-related textual\ncues from the input description for progressively localizing the target object.\nSpecifically, we first use a Large Language Model (LLM) to decompose the input\ntext description into short phrases. These short phrases are taken as\ntarget-related cues and fed into a Conditional Referring Module (CRM) in\nmultiple stages, to allow updating the referring text embedding and enhance the\nresponse map for target localization in a multi-stage manner. Based on the CRM,\nwe then propose a Region-aware Shrinking (RaS) loss to constrain the visual\nlocalization to be conducted progressively in a coarse-to-fine manner across\ndifferent stages. Finally, we introduce an Instance-aware Disambiguation (IaD)\nloss to suppress instance localization ambiguity by differentiating overlapping\nresponse maps generated by different referring texts on the same image.\nExtensive experiments show that our method outperforms SOTA methods on three\ncommon benchmarks.",

To render text descriptions into video clips, current video\ndiffusion models borrow features from text encoders yet struggle with limited\ntext comprehension.

It is an inherent building\nblock in many applications such as voice assistant, speech translation, etc.\nDespite the advancement of ASR technologies in recent years, it is still\ninevitable for modern ASR systems to have a substantial number of erroneous\nrecognition due to environmental noise, ambiguity, etc. Therefore, the error\ncorrection in ASR is crucial.\n  Motivated by this, this paper studies ASR error correction in the Chinese\nlanguage, which is one of the most popular languages and enjoys a large number\nof users in the world. We first create a benchmark dataset named \\emph{ASR-EC}\nthat contains a wide spectrum of ASR errors generated by industry-grade ASR\nsystems. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first Chinese ASR error\ncorrection benchmark. Then, inspired by the recent advances in \\emph{large\nlanguage models (LLMs)}, we investigate how to harness the power of LLMs to\ncorrect ASR errors. We apply LLMs to ASR error correction in three paradigms.\nThe first paradigm is prompting, which is further categorized as zero-shot,\nfew-shot, and multi-step. The second paradigm is finetuning, which finetunes\nLLMs with ASR error correction data. The third paradigm is multi-modal\naugmentation, which collectively utilizes the audio and ASR transcripts for\nerror correction. Extensive experiments reveal that prompting is not effective\nfor ASR error correction. Finetuning is effective only for a portion of LLMs.\nMulti-modal augmentation is the most effective method for error correction and\nachieves state-of-the-art performance.",

By integrating a simple Degradation Discriminator\ninto pre-trained multi-task models, CoR facilitates the process where models\nremove one degradation basis per step, continuing this process until the image\nis fully restored from the unknown composite degradation.

This\nresearch delves into enhancing the function-calling capabilities of LLMs by\nexploring different approaches, including prompt formats for integrating\nfunction descriptions, blending function-calling and instruction-following\ndata, introducing a novel Decision Token for conditional prompts, leveraging\nchain-of-thought reasoning, and overcoming multilingual challenges with a\ntranslation pipeline. Our key findings and contributions are as follows: (1)\nInstruction-following data improves both function-calling accuracy and\nrelevance detection. (2) The use of the newly proposed Decision Token, combined\nwith synthetic non-function-call data, enhances relevance detection. (3) A\ntailored translation pipeline effectively overcomes multilingual limitations,\ndemonstrating significant improvements in Traditional Chinese. These insights\nhighlight the potential for improved function-calling capabilities and\nmultilingual applications in LLMs."

However, all the existing\nLSS-based methods transform multi-view image features into a Cartesian\nBird's-Eye-View(BEV) representation, which does not take into account the\nnon-uniform image information distribution and hardly exploits the view\nsymmetry. In this paper, in order to adapt the image information distribution\nand preserve the view symmetry by regular convolution, we propose to employ the\npolar BEV representation to substitute the Cartesian BEV representation. To\nachieve this, we elaborately tailor three modules: a polar view transformer to\ngenerate the polar BEV representation, a polar temporal fusion module for\nfusing historical polar BEV features and a polar detection head to predict the\npolar-parameterized representation of the object. In addition, we design a 2D\nauxiliary detection head and a spatial attention enhancement module to improve\nthe quality of feature extraction in perspective view and BEV, respectively.\nFinally, we integrate the above improvements into a novel multi-view 3D object\ndetector, PolarBEVDet.

As handling the mixture of\ncode and data is a well-known challenge for XoM, most existing methods require\nthe strict separation of code and data areas via either compile-time\ntransformation or binary patching, so that the unreadable permission can be\nsafely enforced at the granularity of memory pages. In contrast to previous\napproaches, we provide a fine-grained memory permission control mechanism to\nrestrict the read permission of code while allowing legitimate data reads\nwithin code pages. This novelty enables PXoM to harden stripped binaries but\nwithout resorting to error-prone embedded data relocation. We leverage Intel's\nhardware feature, Memory Protection Keys, to offer an efficient fine-grained\npermission control. We measure PXoM's performance with both micro- and\nmacro-benchmarks, and it only introduces negligible runtime overhead. Our\nsecurity evaluation shows that PXoM leaves adversaries with little wiggle room\nto harvest all of the required gadgets, suggesting PXoM is practical for\nreal-world deployment.",

This component focuses on testing models' ability to reason\nabout sports solely through question-answering (QA), without requiring visual\ninputs; SPORTU-video, consisting of 1,701 slow-motion video clips across 7\ndifferent sports and 12,048 QA pairs, designed to assess multi-level reasoning,\nfrom simple sports recognition to complex tasks like foul detection and rule\napplication. We evaluate four prevalent LLMs mainly utilizing few-shot learning\nparadigms supplemented by chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting on the SPORTU-text\npart. We evaluate four LLMs using few-shot learning and chain-of-thought (CoT)\nprompting on SPORTU-text. GPT-4o achieves the highest accuracy of 71%, but\nstill falls short of human-level performance, highlighting room for improvement\nin rule comprehension and reasoning.

Among all the\nanalytical steps, assigning individual cells to specific types is fundamental\nfor understanding cellular heterogeneity. However, this process is usually\nlabor-intensive and requires extensive expert knowledge. Recent advances in\nlarge language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their ability to efficiently\nprocess and synthesize vast corpora of text to automatically extract essential\nbiological knowledge, such as marker genes, potentially promoting more\nefficient and automated cell type annotations. To thoroughly evaluate the\ncapability of modern instruction-tuned LLMs in automating the cell type\nidentification process, we introduce SOAR, a comprehensive benchmarking study\nof LLMs for cell type annotation tasks in single-cell genomics. Specifically,\nwe assess the performance of 8 instruction-tuned LLMs across 11 datasets,\nspanning multiple cell types and species. Our study explores the potential of\nLLMs to accurately classify and annotate cell types in single-cell RNA\nsequencing (scRNA-seq) data, while extending their application to multiomics\ndata through cross-modality translation. Additionally, we evaluate the\neffectiveness of chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting techniques in generating\ndetailed biological insights during the annotation process.

For\ninstance, given an issue on a source code repository, tests can clarify the\ndesired behavior among stake-holders before anyone writes code for the\nagreed-upon fix. Although there has been a lot of work on automated test\ngeneration for the practice \"write code first, test later\", there has been\nlittle such automation for TDD. Ideally, tests for TDD should be fail-to-pass\n(i.e., fail before the issue is resolved and pass after) and have good adequacy\nwith respect to covering the code changed during issue resolution. This paper\nintroduces TDD-Bench Verified, a high-quality benchmark suite of 449 issues\nmined from real-world GitHub code repositories. The benchmark's evaluation\nharness runs only relevant tests in isolation for simple yet accurate coverage\nmeasurements, and the benchmark's dataset is filtered both by human judges and\nby execution in the harness. This paper also presents Auto-TDD, an LLM-based\nsolution that takes as input an issue description and a codebase (prior to\nissue resolution) and returns as output a test that can be used to validate the\nchanges made for resolving the issue. Our evaluation shows that Auto-TDD yields\na better fail-to-pass rate than the strongest prior work while also yielding\nhigh coverage adequacy.
