A key challenge in\nthis task is to preserve the identity of the objects depicted in the input\nvisual prompts, while also generating diverse compositions across different\nimages. To address this challenge, we introduce a new KV-mixed cross-attention\nmechanism, in which keys and values are learned from distinct visual\nrepresentations. The keys are derived from an encoder with a small bottleneck\nfor layout control, whereas the values come from a larger bottleneck encoder\nthat captures fine-grained appearance details. By mixing keys and values from\nthese complementary sources, our model preserves the identity of the visual\nprompts while supporting flexible variations in object arrangement, pose, and\ncomposition. During inference, we further propose object-level compositional\nguidance to improve the method's identity preservation and layout correctness.\nResults show that our technique produces diverse scene compositions that\npreserve the unique characteristics of each visual prompt, expanding the\ncreative potential of text-to-image generation.",

By leveraging the\ndynamic sparsity of attention mechanism, RetrievalAttention proposes to build\napproximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) indexes for KV vectors in CPU memory\nand retrieve the most relevant ones through vector search during generation.\nUnfortunately, we observe that the off-the-shelf ANNS indexes are often\nineffective for such retrieval tasks due to the out-of-distribution (OOD)\nbetween query vectors and key vectors in the attention mechanism.\nRetrievalAttention addresses the OOD challenge by designing an attention-aware\nvector search algorithm that can adapt to the distribution of query vectors.\nOur evaluation demonstrates that RetrievalAttention achieves near full\nattention accuracy while only requiring access to 1--3% of the data.

While traditional FGIR\ndeals with classifying different species, UFGIR goes beyond by classifying\nsub-categories within a species such as cultivars of a plant. In recent times\nthe usage of Vision Transformer-based backbones has allowed methods to obtain\noutstanding recognition performances in this task but this comes at a\nsignificant cost in terms of computation specially since this task\nsignificantly benefits from incorporating higher resolution images. Therefore,\ntechniques such as token reduction have emerged to reduce the computational\ncost. However, dropping tokens leads to loss of essential information for\nfine-grained categories, specially as the token keep rate is reduced.\nTherefore, to counteract the loss of information brought by the usage of token\nreduction we propose a novel Cross-Layer Aggregation Classification Head and a\nCross-Layer Cache mechanism to recover and access information from previous\nlayers in later locations. Extensive experiments covering more than 2000 runs\nacross diverse settings including 5 datasets, 9 backbones, 7 token reduction\nmethods, 5 keep rates, and 2 image sizes demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nproposed plug-and-play modules and allow us to push the boundaries of accuracy\nvs cost for UFGIR by reducing the kept tokens to extremely low ratios of up to\n10\\% while maintaining a competitive accuracy to state-of-the-art models.

In addition, we apply orthogonal transformations to\nattention heads without changing the model to increase similarity between\nattention heads before pruning training, in order to further improve\nperformance of the model. Our method can be compatible with rotary position\nembedding (RoPE), which means the model after training can be fully adapted to\nthe mainstream standard GQA framework.

                "summary": "The expansion of large language models (LLMs) with hundreds of billions of\nparameters presents significant challenges to computational resources,\nparticularly data movement and memory bandwidth. Long-context LLMs, which\nprocess sequences of tens of thousands of tokens, further increase the demand\non the memory system as the complexity in attention layers and key-value cache\nsizes is proportional to the context length. Processing-in-Memory (PIM)\nmaximizes memory bandwidth by moving compute to the data and can address the\nmemory bandwidth challenges; however, PIM is not necessarily scalable to\naccelerate long-context LLM because of limited per-module memory capacity and\nthe inflexibility of fixed-functional unit PIM architecture and static memory\nmanagement. In this work, we propose LoL-PIM which is a multi-node PIM\narchitecture that accelerates long context LLM through hardware-software\nco-design.

                    "value": "The expansion of large language models (LLMs) with hundreds of billions of\nparameters presents significant challenges to computational resources,\nparticularly data movement and memory bandwidth. Long-context LLMs, which\nprocess sequences of tens of thousands of tokens, further increase the demand\non the memory system as the complexity in attention layers and key-value cache\nsizes is proportional to the context length. Processing-in-Memory (PIM)\nmaximizes memory bandwidth by moving compute to the data and can address the\nmemory bandwidth challenges; however, PIM is not necessarily scalable to\naccelerate long-context LLM because of limited per-module memory capacity and\nthe inflexibility of fixed-functional unit PIM architecture and static memory\nmanagement. In this work, we propose LoL-PIM which is a multi-node PIM\narchitecture that accelerates long context LLM through hardware-software\nco-design.

Extensive\nexperimental results demonstrate that FLUDE can effectively improve model\nperformance and resource efficiency of FL training in undependable\nenvironments."

As an\neffective approach for DiT acceleration, feature caching methods are designed\nto cache the features of DiT in previous timesteps and reuse them in the next\ntimesteps, allowing us to skip the computation in the next timesteps. However,\non the one hand, aggressively reusing all the features cached in previous\ntimesteps leads to a severe drop in generation quality. On the other hand,\nconservatively caching only the features in the redundant layers or tokens but\nstill computing the important ones successfully preserves the generation\nquality but results in reductions in acceleration ratios. Observing such a\ntradeoff between generation quality and acceleration performance, this paper\nbegins by quantitatively studying the accumulated error from cached features.\nSurprisingly, we find that aggressive caching does not introduce significantly\nmore caching errors in the caching step, and the conservative feature caching\ncan fix the error introduced by aggressive caching. Thereby, we propose a dual\ncaching strategy that adopts aggressive and conservative caching iteratively,\nleading to significant acceleration and high generation quality at the same\ntime.

In this paper, we\ndemonstrate that transforming a memory access pattern consisting of a single\nstride to one that concurrently accesses multiple strides, can boost the\nutilization of the hardware prefetcher, and in turn improves the performance of\nmemory-bound kernels significantly. Using a set of micro-benchmarks, we\nestablish that accessing memory in a multi-strided manner enables more cache\nlines to be concurrently brought into the cache, resulting in improved cache\nhit ratios and higher effective memory bandwidth without the introduction of\ncostly software prefetch instructions. Subsequently, we show that multi-strided\nvariants of a collection of six memory-bound dense compute kernels outperform\nstate-of-the-art counterparts on three different micro-architectures. More\nspecifically, for kernels among which Matrix Vector Multiplication, Convolution\nStencil and kernels from PolyBench, we achieve significant speedups of up to\n12.55x over Polly, 2.99x over MKL, 1.98x over OpenBLAS, 1.08x over Halide and\n1.87x over OpenCV. The code transformation to take advantage of multi-strided\nmemory access is a natural extension of the loop unroll and loop interchange\ntechniques, allowing this method to be incorporated into compiler pipelines in\nthe future.",

In this paper, we\ndemonstrate that transforming a memory access pattern consisting of a single\nstride to one that concurrently accesses multiple strides, can boost the\nutilization of the hardware prefetcher, and in turn improves the performance of\nmemory-bound kernels significantly. Using a set of micro-benchmarks, we\nestablish that accessing memory in a multi-strided manner enables more cache\nlines to be concurrently brought into the cache, resulting in improved cache\nhit ratios and higher effective memory bandwidth without the introduction of\ncostly software prefetch instructions. Subsequently, we show that multi-strided\nvariants of a collection of six memory-bound dense compute kernels outperform\nstate-of-the-art counterparts on three different micro-architectures. More\nspecifically, for kernels among which Matrix Vector Multiplication, Convolution\nStencil and kernels from PolyBench, we achieve significant speedups of up to\n12.55x over Polly, 2.99x over MKL, 1.98x over OpenBLAS, 1.08x over Halide and\n1.87x over OpenCV. The code transformation to take advantage of multi-strided\nmemory access is a natural extension of the loop unroll and loop interchange\ntechniques, allowing this method to be incorporated into compiler pipelines in\nthe future."

To\ntackle this problem, we propose ResQ, a PTQ method that pushes further the\nstate-of-the-art.

We empirically observe that,\nunlike single image inputs, VLLMs typically attend visual tokens from different\nframes at different decoding iterations, making a one-shot pruning strategy\nprone to removing important tokens by mistake. Motivated by this, we present\nDyCoke, a training-free token compression method to optimize token\nrepresentation and accelerate VLLMs. DyCoke incorporates a plug-and-play\ntemporal compression module to minimize temporal redundancy by merging\nredundant tokens across frames, and applies dynamic KV cache reduction to prune\nspatially redundant tokens selectively. It ensures high-quality inference by\ndynamically retaining the critical tokens at each decoding step. Extensive\nexperimental results demonstrate that DyCoke can outperform the prior SoTA\ncounterparts, achieving 1.5X inference speedup, 1.4X memory reduction against\nthe baseline VLLM, while still improving the performance, with no training.",

                    "value": "Video large language models (VLLMs) have significantly advanced recently in\nprocessing complex video content, yet their inference efficiency remains\nconstrained because of the high computational cost stemming from the thousands\nof visual tokens generated from the video inputs. We empirically observe that,\nunlike single image inputs, VLLMs typically attend visual tokens from different\nframes at different decoding iterations, making a one-shot pruning strategy\nprone to removing important tokens by mistake. Motivated by this, we present\nDyCoke, a training-free token compression method to optimize token\nrepresentation and accelerate VLLMs. DyCoke incorporates a plug-and-play\ntemporal compression module to minimize temporal redundancy by merging\nredundant tokens across frames, and applies dynamic KV cache reduction to prune\nspatially redundant tokens selectively. It ensures high-quality inference by\ndynamically retaining the critical tokens at each decoding step. Extensive\nexperimental results demonstrate that DyCoke can outperform the prior SoTA\ncounterparts, achieving 1.5X inference speedup, 1.4X memory reduction against\nthe baseline VLLM, while still improving the performance, with no training."

In addition,\nVivar leverages latent reuse and caching strategies to accelerate 2D and AR\ncontent generation. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our system\nachieves 11$\\times$ latency reduction without compromising quality.

The dynamic arrival and departure of connection requests in\noptical networks result in particular central links experiencing more traffic\nand congestion than non-central links. The occurrence of congested links leads\nto service blocking despite the availability of resources within the network,\nrestricting the efficient utilization of network resources. The available\nalgorithms in the literature that aim to balance load among network links offer\na trade-off between blocking performance and algorithmic complexity, thus\nincreasing service provisioning time. This work proposes a dynamic\nrouting-based congestion-aware routing, modulation, core, and spectrum\nassignment (RMCSA) algorithm for space division multiplexing elastic optical\nnetworks (SDM-EONs). The algorithm finds alternative candidate paths based on\nreal-time link occupancy metrics to minimize blocking due to link congestion\nunder dynamic traffic scenarios. As a result, the algorithm reduces the\nformation of congestion hotspots in the network owing to link-betweenness\ncentrality. We have performed extensive simulations using two realistic network\ntopologies to compare the performance of the proposed algorithm with relevant\nRMCSA algorithms available in the literature. The simulation results verify the\nsuperior performance of our proposed algorithm compared to the benchmark Yen's\nK-shortest paths and K-Disjoint shortest paths RMCSA algorithms in connection\nblocking ratio and spectrum utilization efficiency. To expedite the\nroute-finding process, we present a novel caching strategy that allows the\nproposed algorithm to demonstrate a much-reduced service delay time compared to\nthe recently developed adaptive link weight-based load-balancing RMCSA\nalgorithm.",

                "summary": "Deploying local AI models, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), to edge\ndevices can substantially enhance devices' independent capabilities, alleviate\nthe server's burden, and lower the response time. Owing to these tremendous\npotentials, many big tech companies have released several lightweight Small\nLanguage Models (SLMs) to bridge this gap. However, we still have huge\nmotivations to deploy more powerful (LLMs) AI models on edge devices and\nenhance their smartness level. Unlike the conventional approaches for AI model\ncompression, we investigate activation sparsity. The activation sparsity method\nis orthogonal and combinable with existing techniques to maximize compression\nrate while maintaining great accuracy. LLMs' Feed-Forward Network (FFN)\ncomponents, which typically comprise a large proportion of parameters (around\n3/2), ensure that our FFN optimizations would have a better chance of achieving\neffective compression. Moreover, our findings are beneficial to general LLMs\nand are not restricted to ReLU-based models. This work systematically\ninvestigates the tradeoff between enforcing activation sparsity and perplexity\n(accuracy) on state-of-the-art LLMs. Our empirical analysis demonstrates that\nwe can obtain around 50% of main memory and computing reductions for critical\nFFN components with negligible accuracy degradation. This extra 50% sparsity\ndoes not naturally exist in the current LLMs, which require tuning LLMs'\nactivation outputs by injecting zero-enforcing thresholds.

                    "value": "Deploying local AI models, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), to edge\ndevices can substantially enhance devices' independent capabilities, alleviate\nthe server's burden, and lower the response time. Owing to these tremendous\npotentials, many big tech companies have released several lightweight Small\nLanguage Models (SLMs) to bridge this gap. However, we still have huge\nmotivations to deploy more powerful (LLMs) AI models on edge devices and\nenhance their smartness level. Unlike the conventional approaches for AI model\ncompression, we investigate activation sparsity. The activation sparsity method\nis orthogonal and combinable with existing techniques to maximize compression\nrate while maintaining great accuracy. LLMs' Feed-Forward Network (FFN)\ncomponents, which typically comprise a large proportion of parameters (around\n3/2), ensure that our FFN optimizations would have a better chance of achieving\neffective compression. Moreover, our findings are beneficial to general LLMs\nand are not restricted to ReLU-based models. This work systematically\ninvestigates the tradeoff between enforcing activation sparsity and perplexity\n(accuracy) on state-of-the-art LLMs. Our empirical analysis demonstrates that\nwe can obtain around 50% of main memory and computing reductions for critical\nFFN components with negligible accuracy degradation. This extra 50% sparsity\ndoes not naturally exist in the current LLMs, which require tuning LLMs'\nactivation outputs by injecting zero-enforcing thresholds. To obtain the\nbenefits of activation sparsity, we provide a guideline for the system\narchitect for LLM prediction and prefetching. The success prediction allows the\nsystem to prefetch the necessary weights while omitting the inactive ones and\ntheir successors, therefore lowering cache and memory pollution and reducing\nLLM execution time on resource-constrained edge devices."

The\neffectiveness of a key-value cache relies on its ability of accommodating the\nneeded data. However, expanding the cache capacity is often more difficult than\ncommonly expected because of many practical constraints, such as server costs,\ncooling issues, rack space, and even human resource expenses. A potential\nsolution is compression, which virtually extends the cache capacity by\ncondensing data in cache. In practice, this seemingly simple idea has not\ngained much traction in key-value cache system design, due to several critical\nissues: the compression-unfriendly index structure, severe read/write\namplification, wasteful decompression operations, and heavy computing cost.\nThis paper presents a hybrid DRAM-SSD cache design to realize a systematic\nintegration of data compression in key-value cache. By treating compression as\nan essential component, we have redesigned the indexing structure, data\nmanagement, and leveraged the emerging computational SSD hardware for\ncollaborative optimizations.

However, their performance in 3D\nspatial comprehension, which is critical for embodied intelligence, remains\nlimited. Recent advances have leveraged 3D point clouds and multi-view images\nas inputs, yielding promising results. However, we propose exploring a purely\nvision-based solution inspired by human perception, which merely relies on\nvisual cues for 3D spatial understanding. This paper empirically investigates\nthe limitations of VLMs in 3D spatial knowledge, revealing that their primary\nshortcoming lies in the lack of global-local correspondence between the scene\nand individual frames. To address this, we introduce GPT4Scene, a novel visual\nprompting paradigm in VLM training and inference that helps build the\nglobal-local relationship, significantly improving the 3D spatial understanding\nof indoor scenes. Specifically, GPT4Scene constructs a 3D Bird's Eye View (BEV)\nimage from the video and marks consistent object IDs across both frames and the\nBEV image. The model then inputs the concatenated BEV image and video frames\nwith markers. In zero-shot evaluations, GPT4Scene improves performance over\nclosed-source VLMs like GPT-4o. Additionally, we prepare a processed video\ndataset consisting of 165K text annotation to fine-tune open-source VLMs,\nachieving state-of-the-art performance on all 3D understanding tasks.\nSurprisingly, after training with the GPT4Scene paradigm, VLMs consistently\nimprove during inference, even without visual prompting and BEV image as\nexplicit correspondence. It demonstrates that the proposed paradigm helps VLMs\ndevelop an intrinsic ability to understand 3D scenes, which paves the way for a\nnoninvasive approach to extending pre-trained VLMs for 3D scene understanding.",

Our approach addresses the task of generating\nsemantically coherent compositions across diverse scenes and styles, similar to\nthe versatility and expressiveness offered by text prompts. A key challenge in\nthis task is to preserve the identity of the objects depicted in the input\nvisual prompts, while also generating diverse compositions across different\nimages. To address this challenge, we introduce a new KV-mixed cross-attention\nmechanism, in which keys and values are learned from distinct visual\nrepresentations. The keys are derived from an encoder with a small bottleneck\nfor layout control, whereas the values come from a larger bottleneck encoder\nthat captures fine-grained appearance details. By mixing keys and values from\nthese complementary sources, our model preserves the identity of the visual\nprompts while supporting flexible variations in object arrangement, pose, and\ncomposition. During inference, we further propose object-level compositional\nguidance to improve the method's identity preservation and layout correctness.\nResults show that our technique produces diverse scene compositions that\npreserve the unique characteristics of each visual prompt, expanding the\ncreative potential of text-to-image generation.",

We first\nexamine the fundamentals of alignment, exploring its representational and\nbehavioral aspects, training methodologies, and theoretical foundations. We\nthen analyze misalignment phenomena across three semantic levels: object,\nattribute, and relational misalignment. Our investigation reveals that\nmisalignment emerges from challenges at multiple levels: the data level, the\nmodel level, and the inference level. We provide a comprehensive review of\nexisting mitigation strategies, categorizing them into parameter-frozen and\nparameter-tuning approaches. Finally, we outline promising future research\ndirections, emphasizing the need for standardized evaluation protocols and\nin-depth explainability studies."

For fine-tuning, we utilize the\nMentalllama and Llama models, while for prompting, we experiment with\nproprietary models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4o, as well as open-source models such\nas llama-3.1-8b and mixtral-8x7b."

While ICRL\ncapabilities have been demonstrated in transformers through task-specific\ntraining, the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) out-of-the-box remains\nlargely unexplored. Recent findings highlight that LLMs often face challenges\nwhen dealing with numerical contexts, and limited attention has been paid to\nevaluating their performance through preference feedback generated by the\nenvironment. This paper is the first to investigate LLMs as in-context\ndecision-makers under the problem of Dueling Bandits (DB), a stateless\npreference-based reinforcement learning setting that extends the classic\nMulti-Armed Bandit (MAB) model by querying for preference feedback. We compare\nGPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4, GPT-4 Turbo, Llama 3.1, and o1-Preview against nine\nwell-established DB algorithms. Our results reveal that our top-performing LLM,\nGPT-4 Turbo, has the zero-shot relative decision-making ability to achieve\nsurprisingly low weak regret across all the DB environment instances by quickly\nincluding the best arm in duels. However, an optimality gap exists between LLMs\nand classic DB algorithms in terms of strong regret. LLMs struggle to converge\nand consistently exploit even when explicitly prompted to do so, and are\nsensitive to prompt variations. To bridge this gap, we propose an agentic flow\nframework: LLM with Enhanced Algorithmic Dueling (LEAD), which integrates\noff-the-shelf DB algorithms with LLM agents through fine-grained adaptive\ninterplay. We show that LEAD has theoretical guarantees inherited from classic\nDB algorithms on both weak and strong regret. We validate its efficacy and\nrobustness even with noisy and adversarial prompts. The design of our framework\nsheds light on how to enhance the trustworthiness of LLMs used for in-context\ndecision-making.",

However, vendors often provide unstructured\nproduct descriptions, making attribute value extraction necessary to ensure\ndata consistency and usability. Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated\ntheir potential for product attribute value extraction in few-shot scenarios.\nRecent research has shown that self-refinement techniques can improve the\nperformance of LLMs on tasks such as code generation and text-to-SQL\ntranslation. For other tasks, the application of these techniques has resulted\nin increased costs due to processing additional tokens, without achieving any\nimprovement in performance. This paper investigates applying two\nself-refinement techniques, error-based prompt rewriting and self-correction,\nto the product attribute value extraction task.

                    "value": "Structured product data, in the form of attribute-value pairs, is essential\nfor e-commerce platforms to support features such as faceted product search and\nattribute-based product comparison. However, vendors often provide unstructured\nproduct descriptions, making attribute value extraction necessary to ensure\ndata consistency and usability. Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated\ntheir potential for product attribute value extraction in few-shot scenarios.\nRecent research has shown that self-refinement techniques can improve the\nperformance of LLMs on tasks such as code generation and text-to-SQL\ntranslation. For other tasks, the application of these techniques has resulted\nin increased costs due to processing additional tokens, without achieving any\nimprovement in performance. This paper investigates applying two\nself-refinement techniques, error-based prompt rewriting and self-correction,\nto the product attribute value extraction task.

Research has shown that cybersickness can significantly\nbe reflected in head and eye tracking data, along with other physiological data\n(e.g., TMP, EDA, and BMP). Despite the application of deep learning techniques\nsuch as CNNs and LSTMs, these models often struggle to capture the complex\ninteractions between multiple data modalities and lack the capacity for\nreal-time inference, limiting their practical application. Addressing this gap,\nwe propose a lightweight model that leverages a transformer-based encoder with\nsparse self-attention to process bio-signal features and a PP-TSN network for\nvideo feature extraction. These features are then integrated via a cross-modal\nfusion module, creating a video-aware bio-signal representation that supports\ncybersickness prediction based on both visual and bio-signal inputs. Our model,\ntrained with a lightweight framework, was validated on a public dataset\ncontaining eye and head tracking data, physiological data, and VR video, and\ndemonstrated state-of-the-art performance in cybersickness prediction,\nachieving a high accuracy of 93.13\\% using only VR video inputs. These findings\nsuggest that our approach not only enables effective, real-time cybersickness\nprediction but also addresses the longstanding issue of modality interaction in\nVR environments.

While\ngraph neural networks (GNNs) and large language models (LLMs) excel in their\nrespective domains, current approaches often fail to achieve true integration\nat the reasoning level. We propose HetGCoT-Rec, a framework that deeply\nintegrates heterogeneous graph transformer with LLMs through chain-of-thought\nreasoning. Our framework features two key technical innovations: (1) a\nstructure-aware mechanism that transforms heterogeneous graph neural network\nlearned subgraph information into natural language contexts, utilizing\npredefined metapaths to capture academic relationships, and (2) a multi-step\nreasoning strategy that systematically embeds graph-derived contexts into the\nLLM's stage-wise reasoning process. Experiments on a dataset collected from\nOpenAlex demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms baseline\nmethods, achieving 96.48% Hit rate and 92.21% H@1 accuracy. Furthermore, we\nvalidate the framework's adaptability across different LLM architectures,\nshowing consistent improvements in both recommendation accuracy and explanation\nquality.

Then, we designed a Large\nLanguage Model (LLM)-based tool named DiscomfortFilter, which constructs an\neditable preference profile for a user and helps the user express filtering\nneeds through conversation to mask discomforting preferences within the\nprofile. Based on the edited profile, DiscomfortFilter facilitates the\ndiscomforting recommendations filtering in a plug-and-play manner, maintaining\nflexibility and transparency. The constructed preference profile improves LLM\nreasoning and simplifies user alignment, enabling a 3.8B open-source LLM to\nrival top commercial models in an offline proxy task. A one-week user study\nwith 24 participants demonstrated the effectiveness of DiscomfortFilter, while\nalso highlighting its potential impact on platform recommendation outcomes.

These\nsystems are trained on tabular data with both numerical and categorical\ncolumns. Incorporating numerical columns poses a challenge, and they are\ntypically incorporated using a scalar transformation or binning, which can be\neither learned or chosen a-priori. In this work, we provide a systematic and\ntheoretically-justified way to incorporate numerical features into FM variants\nby encoding them into a vector of function values for a set of functions of\none's choice.\n  We view factorization machines as approximators of segmentized functions,\nnamely, functions from a field's value to the real numbers, assuming the\nremaining fields are assigned some given constants, which we refer to as the\nsegment. From this perspective, we show that our technique yields a model that\nlearns segmentized functions of the numerical feature spanned by the set of\nfunctions of one's choice, namely, the spanning coefficients vary between\nsegments. Hence, to improve model accuracy we advocate the use of functions\nknown to have strong approximation power, and offer the B-Spline basis due to\nits well-known approximation power, availability in software libraries, and\nefficiency. Our technique preserves fast training and inference, and requires\nonly a small modification of the computational graph of an FM model. Therefore,\nit is easy to incorporate into an existing system to improve its performance.\nFinally, we back our claims with a set of experiments, including synthetic,\nperformance evaluation on several data-sets, and an A/B test on a real online\nadvertising system which shows improved performance.",

Incorporating numerical columns poses a challenge, and they are\ntypically incorporated using a scalar transformation or binning, which can be\neither learned or chosen a-priori. In this work, we provide a systematic and\ntheoretically-justified way to incorporate numerical features into FM variants\nby encoding them into a vector of function values for a set of functions of\none's choice.\n  We view factorization machines as approximators of segmentized functions,\nnamely, functions from a field's value to the real numbers, assuming the\nremaining fields are assigned some given constants, which we refer to as the\nsegment. From this perspective, we show that our technique yields a model that\nlearns segmentized functions of the numerical feature spanned by the set of\nfunctions of one's choice, namely, the spanning coefficients vary between\nsegments. Hence, to improve model accuracy we advocate the use of functions\nknown to have strong approximation power, and offer the B-Spline basis due to\nits well-known approximation power, availability in software libraries, and\nefficiency. Our technique preserves fast training and inference, and requires\nonly a small modification of the computational graph of an FM model. Therefore,\nit is easy to incorporate into an existing system to improve its performance.\nFinally, we back our claims with a set of experiments, including synthetic,\nperformance evaluation on several data-sets, and an A/B test on a real online\nadvertising system which shows improved performance."

The BB84 protocol assumed single-photon sources,\nbut practical systems rely on weak coherent pulses vulnerable to\nphoton-number-splitting (PNS) attacks. The Gottesman-Lo-L\\\"utkenhaus-Preskill\n(GLLP) framework addressed these imperfections, deriving secure key rate bounds\nunder limited PNS. The Decoy-state protocol further improved performance by\nrefining single-photon yield estimates, but still considered multi-photon\nstates as insecure, limiting intensities and thereby constraining key rate and\ndistance. Here, we show that higher intensities can be securely permitted by\napplying Bayesian inference to estimate key parameters directly from observed\ndata rather than relying on worst-case assumptions. By raising the pulse\nintensity to 10 photons, we achieve 50 times the key rate and a 62.2% increase\nin operational range (about 200 km) compared to the decoy-state protocol.\nFurthermore, we accurately model after-pulsing using a Hidden Markov Model and\nreveal inaccuracies in decoy-state calculations that may produce erroneous\nkey-rate estimates. By bridging theoretical security and real-world conditions,\nthis Bayesian methodology provides a versatile post-processing step for many\ndiscrete-variable QKD protocols, advancing their reach, efficiency, and\nfacilitating broader adoption of quantum-secured communication.",

The BB84 protocol assumed single-photon sources,\nbut practical systems rely on weak coherent pulses vulnerable to\nphoton-number-splitting (PNS) attacks. The Gottesman-Lo-L\\\"utkenhaus-Preskill\n(GLLP) framework addressed these imperfections, deriving secure key rate bounds\nunder limited PNS. The Decoy-state protocol further improved performance by\nrefining single-photon yield estimates, but still considered multi-photon\nstates as insecure, limiting intensities and thereby constraining key rate and\ndistance. Here, we show that higher intensities can be securely permitted by\napplying Bayesian inference to estimate key parameters directly from observed\ndata rather than relying on worst-case assumptions. By raising the pulse\nintensity to 10 photons, we achieve 50 times the key rate and a 62.2% increase\nin operational range (about 200 km) compared to the decoy-state protocol.\nFurthermore, we accurately model after-pulsing using a Hidden Markov Model and\nreveal inaccuracies in decoy-state calculations that may produce erroneous\nkey-rate estimates. By bridging theoretical security and real-world conditions,\nthis Bayesian methodology provides a versatile post-processing step for many\ndiscrete-variable QKD protocols, advancing their reach, efficiency, and\nfacilitating broader adoption of quantum-secured communication."

                "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized a wide range of domains such\nas natural language processing, computer vision, and multi-modal tasks due to\ntheir ability to comprehend context and perform logical reasoning. However, the\ncomputational and memory demands of LLMs, particularly during inference, pose\nsignificant challenges when scaling them to real-world, long-context, and\nreal-time applications. Key-Value (KV) cache management has emerged as a\ncritical optimization technique for accelerating LLM inference by reducing\nredundant computations and improving memory utilization. This survey provides a\ncomprehensive overview of KV cache management strategies for LLM acceleration,\ncategorizing them into token-level, model-level, and system-level\noptimizations. Token-level strategies include KV cache selection, budget\nallocation, merging, quantization, and low-rank decomposition, while\nmodel-level optimizations focus on architectural innovations and attention\nmechanisms to enhance KV reuse. System-level approaches address memory\nmanagement, scheduling, and hardware-aware designs to improve efficiency across\ndiverse computing environments. Additionally, the survey provides an overview\nof both text and multimodal datasets and benchmarks used to evaluate these\nstrategies. By presenting detailed taxonomies and comparative analyses, this\nwork aims to offer useful insights for researchers and practitioners to support\nthe development of efficient and scalable KV cache management techniques,\ncontributing to the practical deployment of LLMs in real-world applications.\nThe curated paper list for KV cache management is in:\n\\href{https://github.com/TreeAI-Lab/Awesome-KV-Cache-Management}{https://github.com/TreeAI-Lab/Awesome-KV-Cache-Management}.",

                    "value": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized a wide range of domains such\nas natural language processing, computer vision, and multi-modal tasks due to\ntheir ability to comprehend context and perform logical reasoning. However, the\ncomputational and memory demands of LLMs, particularly during inference, pose\nsignificant challenges when scaling them to real-world, long-context, and\nreal-time applications. Key-Value (KV) cache management has emerged as a\ncritical optimization technique for accelerating LLM inference by reducing\nredundant computations and improving memory utilization. This survey provides a\ncomprehensive overview of KV cache management strategies for LLM acceleration,\ncategorizing them into token-level, model-level, and system-level\noptimizations. Token-level strategies include KV cache selection, budget\nallocation, merging, quantization, and low-rank decomposition, while\nmodel-level optimizations focus on architectural innovations and attention\nmechanisms to enhance KV reuse. System-level approaches address memory\nmanagement, scheduling, and hardware-aware designs to improve efficiency across\ndiverse computing environments. Additionally, the survey provides an overview\nof both text and multimodal datasets and benchmarks used to evaluate these\nstrategies. By presenting detailed taxonomies and comparative analyses, this\nwork aims to offer useful insights for researchers and practitioners to support\nthe development of efficient and scalable KV cache management techniques,\ncontributing to the practical deployment of LLMs in real-world applications.\nThe curated paper list for KV cache management is in:\n\\href{https://github.com/TreeAI-Lab/Awesome-KV-Cache-Management}{https://github.com/TreeAI-Lab/Awesome-KV-Cache-Management}."

Deep neural networks are\nprone to adversarial attacks and could be easily fooled by adversarial\nexamples. The current progress on this robustness issue is mainly about deep\nclassification models but pays little attention to DML models. Existing works\nfail to thoroughly inspect the robustness of DML and neglect an important DML\nscenario, the clustering-based inference. In this work, we first point out the\nrobustness issue of DML models in clustering-based inference scenarios. We find\nthat, for the clustering-based inference, existing defenses designed DML are\nunable to be reused and the adaptions of defenses designed for deep\nclassification models cannot achieve satisfactory robustness performance. To\nalleviate the hazard of adversarial examples, we propose a new defense, the\nEnsemble Adversarial Training (EAT), which exploits ensemble learning and\nadversarial training. EAT promotes the diversity of the ensemble, encouraging\neach model in the ensemble to have different robustness features, and employs a\nself-transferring mechanism to make full use of the robustness statistics of\nthe whole ensemble in the update of every single model. We evaluate the EAT\nmethod on three widely-used datasets with two popular model architectures.

                    "value": "Deep Metric Learning (DML) has shown remarkable successes in many domains by\ntaking advantage of powerful deep neural networks. Deep neural networks are\nprone to adversarial attacks and could be easily fooled by adversarial\nexamples. The current progress on this robustness issue is mainly about deep\nclassification models but pays little attention to DML models. Existing works\nfail to thoroughly inspect the robustness of DML and neglect an important DML\nscenario, the clustering-based inference. In this work, we first point out the\nrobustness issue of DML models in clustering-based inference scenarios. We find\nthat, for the clustering-based inference, existing defenses designed DML are\nunable to be reused and the adaptions of defenses designed for deep\nclassification models cannot achieve satisfactory robustness performance. To\nalleviate the hazard of adversarial examples, we propose a new defense, the\nEnsemble Adversarial Training (EAT), which exploits ensemble learning and\nadversarial training. EAT promotes the diversity of the ensemble, encouraging\neach model in the ensemble to have different robustness features, and employs a\nself-transferring mechanism to make full use of the robustness statistics of\nthe whole ensemble in the update of every single model. We evaluate the EAT\nmethod on three widely-used datasets with two popular model architectures. The\nresults show that the proposed EAT method greatly outperforms the adaptions of\ndefenses designed for deep classification models."

However, constrained by the low-rank\nbottleneck and quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms, stereo\ntransformers still fail to demonstrate sufficient nonlinear expressiveness\nwithin a reasonable inference time. The lack of focus on key homonymous points\nrenders the representations of such methods vulnerable to challenging\nconditions, including reflections and weak textures. Furthermore, a slow\ncomputing speed is not conducive to the application. To overcome these\ndifficulties, we present the \\textbf{H}adamard \\textbf{A}ttention\n\\textbf{R}ecurrent Stereo \\textbf{T}ransformer (HART) that incorporates the\nfollowing components: 1) For faster inference, we present a Hadamard product\nparadigm for the attention mechanism, achieving linear computational\ncomplexity. 2) We designed a Dense Attention Kernel (DAK) to amplify the\ndifferences between relevant and irrelevant feature responses. This allows HART\nto focus on important details. DAK also converts zero elements to non-zero\nelements to mitigate the reduced expressiveness caused by the low-rank\nbottleneck. 3) To compensate for the spatial and channel interaction missing in\nthe Hadamard product, we propose MKOI to capture both global and local\ninformation through the interleaving of large and small kernel convolutions.\nExperimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our HART.

In\nthis paper, we explore the working mechanism of LLMs in information processing\nfrom the perspective of Information Bottleneck Theory. We propose a\nnon-training construction strategy to define a task space and identify the\nfollowing key findings: (1) LLMs compress input information into specific task\nspaces (e.g., sentiment space, topic space) to facilitate task understanding;\n(2) they then extract and utilize relevant information from the task space at\ncritical moments to generate accurate predictions. Based on these insights, we\nintroduce two novel approaches: an Information Compression-based Context\nLearning (IC-ICL) and a Task-Space-guided Fine-Tuning (TS-FT). IC-ICL enhances\nreasoning performance and inference efficiency by compressing retrieved example\ninformation into the task space. TS-FT employs a space-guided loss to fine-tune\nLLMs, encouraging the learning of more effective compression and selection\nmechanisms. Experiments across multiple datasets validate the effectiveness of\ntask space construction. Additionally, IC-ICL not only improves performance but\nalso accelerates inference speed by over 40\\%, while TS-FT achieves superior\nresults with a minimal strategy adjustment.",

We propose to use regularized and\nadversarial regularized estimators to obtain an adaptive estimator with respect\nto the dependence structure which allows for rates of convergence to depend on\nthis intrinsic (lower) dimension.

In this paper, we explore the\ncharacteristics of visual embedding space under the LLM framework and discover\nthat the correlation between visual embeddings can help achieve more stable and\nrobust generation results. We present IAR, an Improved AutoRegressive Visual\nGeneration Method that enhances the training efficiency and generation quality\nof LLM-based visual generation models.

Leveraging the rearranged codebook, we\npropose a Cluster-oriented Cross-entropy Loss that guides the model to\ncorrectly predict the cluster where the token is located. This approach ensures\nthat even if the model predicts the wrong token index, there is a high\nprobability the predicted token is located in the correct cluster, which\nsignificantly enhances the generation quality and robustness. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that our method consistently enhances the model\ntraining efficiency and performance from 100M to 1.4B, reducing the training\ntime by half while achieving the same FID.

MERV is up to 3.7% better in accuracy\nthan Video-LLaVA across the standard suite video understanding benchmarks,\nwhile also having a better Video-ChatGPT score. We also improve upon SeViLA,\nthe previous best on zero-shot Perception Test accuracy, by 2.2%. MERV\nintroduces minimal extra parameters and trains faster than equivalent\nsingle-encoder methods while parallelizing the visual processing. Finally, we\nprovide qualitative evidence that MERV successfully captures domain knowledge\nfrom each of its encoders.

MERV is up to 3.7% better in accuracy\nthan Video-LLaVA across the standard suite video understanding benchmarks,\nwhile also having a better Video-ChatGPT score. We also improve upon SeViLA,\nthe previous best on zero-shot Perception Test accuracy, by 2.2%. MERV\nintroduces minimal extra parameters and trains faster than equivalent\nsingle-encoder methods while parallelizing the visual processing. Finally, we\nprovide qualitative evidence that MERV successfully captures domain knowledge\nfrom each of its encoders. Our results offer promising directions in utilizing\nmultiple vision encoders for comprehensive video understanding."

However, they can be easily misled by unfaithful\narguments during conversations, even when their original statements are\ncorrect. To this end, we investigate the problem of maintaining faithful\nintegrity in LLMs. This involves ensuring that LLMs adhere to their faithful\nstatements in the face of opposing arguments and are able to correct their\nincorrect statements when presented with faithful arguments. In this work, we\npropose a novel framework, named Alignment for Faithful Integrity with\nConfidence Estimation (AFICE), which aims to align the LLM responses with\nfaithful integrity. Specifically, AFICE first designs a Bilateral Confidence\nEstimation (BCE) approach for estimating the uncertainty of each response\ngenerated by the LLM given a specific context, which simultaneously estimate\nthe model's confidence to the question based on the internal states during\ndecoding as well as to the answer based on cumulative probability ratios. With\nthe BCE, we construct a conversational preference dataset composed of context,\noriginal statement, and argument, which is adopted for aligning the LLM for\nfaithful integrity using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Extensive\nexperimental results on a wide range of benchmarks demonstrate significant\nimprovements in the LLM's ability to maintain faithful responses when\nencountering opposing arguments, ensuring both the practical utility and\ntrustworthiness of LLMs in complex interactive settings.

Using this\nframework, we demonstrate how techniques like chain-of-thought prompting and\nreinforcement learning with human feedback fundamentally alter the knowledge\nstructures of internal (pre-trained) and external (context-dependent) knowledge\nin LLMs. CoT particularly enhances base model performance and shows synergistic\nbenefits when applied to aligned LLMs. Moreover, our layer-wise analysis\nreveals that higher layers in LLMs encode more high-confidence knowledge, while\nlow-confidence knowledge tends to emerge in middle-to-lower layers.",

While ICRL\ncapabilities have been demonstrated in transformers through task-specific\ntraining, the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) out-of-the-box remains\nlargely unexplored. Recent findings highlight that LLMs often face challenges\nwhen dealing with numerical contexts, and limited attention has been paid to\nevaluating their performance through preference feedback generated by the\nenvironment. This paper is the first to investigate LLMs as in-context\ndecision-makers under the problem of Dueling Bandits (DB), a stateless\npreference-based reinforcement learning setting that extends the classic\nMulti-Armed Bandit (MAB) model by querying for preference feedback. We compare\nGPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4, GPT-4 Turbo, Llama 3.1, and o1-Preview against nine\nwell-established DB algorithms. Our results reveal that our top-performing LLM,\nGPT-4 Turbo, has the zero-shot relative decision-making ability to achieve\nsurprisingly low weak regret across all the DB environment instances by quickly\nincluding the best arm in duels. However, an optimality gap exists between LLMs\nand classic DB algorithms in terms of strong regret. LLMs struggle to converge\nand consistently exploit even when explicitly prompted to do so, and are\nsensitive to prompt variations. To bridge this gap, we propose an agentic flow\nframework: LLM with Enhanced Algorithmic Dueling (LEAD), which integrates\noff-the-shelf DB algorithms with LLM agents through fine-grained adaptive\ninterplay. We show that LEAD has theoretical guarantees inherited from classic\nDB algorithms on both weak and strong regret. We validate its efficacy and\nrobustness even with noisy and adversarial prompts. The design of our framework\nsheds light on how to enhance the trustworthiness of LLMs used for in-context\ndecision-making.",

Given the high costs of annotating\nfine-grained labels and the substantial data needed for fine-tuning LLMs, we\npropose to adopt semi-supervised learning (SSL). Our framework, SeFAR,\nincorporates several innovative designs to tackle these challenges.\nSpecifically, to capture sufficient visual details, we construct Dual-level\ntemporal elements as more effective representations, based on which we design a\nnew strong augmentation strategy for the Teacher-Student learning paradigm\nthrough involving moderate temporal perturbation. Furthermore, to handle the\nhigh uncertainty within the teacher model's predictions for FAR, we propose the\nAdaptive Regulation to stabilize the learning process. Experiments show that\nSeFAR achieves state-of-the-art performance on two FAR datasets, FineGym and\nFineDiving, across various data scopes. It also outperforms other\nsemi-supervised methods on two classical coarse-grained datasets, UCF101 and\nHMDB51. Further analysis and ablation studies validate the effectiveness of our\ndesigns.

Our framework features two key technical innovations: (1) a\nstructure-aware mechanism that transforms heterogeneous graph neural network\nlearned subgraph information into natural language contexts, utilizing\npredefined metapaths to capture academic relationships, and (2) a multi-step\nreasoning strategy that systematically embeds graph-derived contexts into the\nLLM's stage-wise reasoning process. Experiments on a dataset collected from\nOpenAlex demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms baseline\nmethods, achieving 96.48% Hit rate and 92.21% H@1 accuracy. Furthermore, we\nvalidate the framework's adaptability across different LLM architectures,\nshowing consistent improvements in both recommendation accuracy and explanation\nquality.

Despite their strong instruction-following\ncapabilities, these models frequently struggled to align with user intent in\ncoding scenarios. In particular, they were hampered by datasets that lacked\ndiversity and failed to address specialized tasks or edge cases. Furthermore,\nchallenges in supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from\nhuman feedback (RLHF) led to failures in generating precise,\nhuman-intent-aligned code. To tackle these challenges and improve the code\ngeneration performance for automated programming systems, we propose\nFeedback-driven Adaptive Long/short-term memory reinforced Coding Optimization\n(i.e., FALCON). FALCON is structured into two hierarchical levels. From the\nglobal level, long-term memory improves code quality by retaining and applying\nlearned knowledge. At the local level, short-term memory allows for the\nincorporation of immediate feedback from compilers and AI systems.\nAdditionally, we introduce meta-reinforcement learning with feedback rewards to\nsolve the global-local bi-level optimization problem and enhance the model's\nadaptability across diverse code generation tasks. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that our technique achieves state-of-the-art performance, leading\nother reinforcement learning methods by more than 4.5 percentage points on the\nMBPP benchmark and 6.1 percentage points on the Humaneval benchmark.

To overcome this\nlimitation, we introduce SpeechRAG, a novel framework designed for\nopen-question answering over spoken data.

By aligning the embedding spaces\nof text and speech, our speech retriever directly retrieves audio passages from\ntext-based queries, leveraging the retrieval capacity of the frozen text\nretriever. Our retrieval experiments on spoken question answering datasets show\nthat direct speech retrieval does not degrade over the text-based baseline, and\noutperforms the cascaded systems using ASR. For generation, we use a speech\nlanguage model (SLM) as a generator, conditioned on audio passages rather than\ntranscripts.

We examine two fundamental\ngraph tasks: identifying common connections between two nodes and assessing\nsimilarity among three nodes, and show that the model's performance in these\ntasks significantly depends on the relative positioning of common edges. We\nevaluate three publicly available LLMs using various graph encoding techniques\nthat represent graph structures for LLM input. We propose a formulation for the\nlost-in-distance phenomenon and demonstrate that lost-in-distance and\nlost-in-the middle phenomenas occur independently. Results indicate that model\naccuracy can decline by up to 6x as the distance between node connections\nincreases, independent of graph encoding and model size."

In\nthis paper, we explore the working mechanism of LLMs in information processing\nfrom the perspective of Information Bottleneck Theory. We propose a\nnon-training construction strategy to define a task space and identify the\nfollowing key findings: (1) LLMs compress input information into specific task\nspaces (e.g., sentiment space, topic space) to facilitate task understanding;\n(2) they then extract and utilize relevant information from the task space at\ncritical moments to generate accurate predictions. Based on these insights, we\nintroduce two novel approaches: an Information Compression-based Context\nLearning (IC-ICL) and a Task-Space-guided Fine-Tuning (TS-FT). IC-ICL enhances\nreasoning performance and inference efficiency by compressing retrieved example\ninformation into the task space. TS-FT employs a space-guided loss to fine-tune\nLLMs, encouraging the learning of more effective compression and selection\nmechanisms. Experiments across multiple datasets validate the effectiveness of\ntask space construction. Additionally, IC-ICL not only improves performance but\nalso accelerates inference speed by over 40\\%, while TS-FT achieves superior\nresults with a minimal strategy adjustment.",

Human-AI teaming is an important paradigm for studying various aspects\nwhen humans and AI agents work together. The unique aspect of Human-AI teaming\nresearch is the need to jointly study humans and AI agents, demanding\nmultidisciplinary research efforts from machine learning to human-computer\ninteraction, robotics, cognitive science, neuroscience, psychology, social\nscience, and complex systems. However, existing platforms for Human-AI teaming\nresearch are limited, often supporting oversimplified scenarios and a single\ntask, or specifically focusing on either human-teaming research or multi-agent\nAI algorithms. We introduce CREW, a platform to facilitate Human-AI teaming\nresearch in real-time decision-making scenarios and engage collaborations from\nmultiple scientific disciplines, with a strong emphasis on human involvement.\nIt includes pre-built tasks for cognitive studies and Human-AI teaming with\nexpandable potentials from our modular design. Following conventional cognitive\nneuroscience research, CREW also supports multimodal human physiological signal\nrecording for behavior analysis. Moreover, CREW benchmarks real-time\nhuman-guided reinforcement learning agents using state-of-the-art algorithms\nand well-tuned baselines.

This oversight may lead to suboptimal utilization of visual\ngeneration capabilities within the LLM framework. In this paper, we explore the\ncharacteristics of visual embedding space under the LLM framework and discover\nthat the correlation between visual embeddings can help achieve more stable and\nrobust generation results. We present IAR, an Improved AutoRegressive Visual\nGeneration Method that enhances the training efficiency and generation quality\nof LLM-based visual generation models. Firstly, we propose a Codebook\nRearrangement strategy that uses balanced k-means clustering algorithm to\nrearrange the visual codebook into clusters, ensuring high similarity among\nvisual features within each cluster. Leveraging the rearranged codebook, we\npropose a Cluster-oriented Cross-entropy Loss that guides the model to\ncorrectly predict the cluster where the token is located. This approach ensures\nthat even if the model predicts the wrong token index, there is a high\nprobability the predicted token is located in the correct cluster, which\nsignificantly enhances the generation quality and robustness. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that our method consistently enhances the model\ntraining efficiency and performance from 100M to 1.4B, reducing the training\ntime by half while achieving the same FID. Additionally, our approach can be\napplied to various LLM-based visual generation models and adheres to the\nscaling law, providing a promising direction for future research in LLM-based\nvisual generation.",

However, existing models struggle with complex and detailed prompts,\nleading to potential performance degradation. We hypothesize that this problem\nstems from the simplicity and scarcity of the training data. This work aims to\ncreate a large-scale audio dataset with rich captions for improving audio\ngeneration models. We first develop an automated pipeline to generate detailed\ncaptions by transforming predicted visual captions, audio captions, and tagging\nlabels into comprehensive descriptions using a Large Language Model (LLM). The\nresulting dataset, Sound-VECaps, comprises 1.66M high-quality audio-caption\npairs with enriched details including audio event orders, occurred places and\nenvironment information.

However, existing models struggle with complex and detailed prompts,\nleading to potential performance degradation. We hypothesize that this problem\nstems from the simplicity and scarcity of the training data. This work aims to\ncreate a large-scale audio dataset with rich captions for improving audio\ngeneration models. We first develop an automated pipeline to generate detailed\ncaptions by transforming predicted visual captions, audio captions, and tagging\nlabels into comprehensive descriptions using a Large Language Model (LLM). The\nresulting dataset, Sound-VECaps, comprises 1.66M high-quality audio-caption\npairs with enriched details including audio event orders, occurred places and\nenvironment information.

While deep\nlearning approaches have been applied to address these challenges, their\nblack-box nature raises concerns about trust and explainability. Recently,\nlarge language models (LLMs) have shown promise in financial applications due\nto their ability to understand multi-modal data and generate explainable\ndecisions. However, single LLM faces limitations in complex, comprehensive\ntasks such as asset investment. These limitations are even more pronounced in\ncryptocurrency investment, where LLMs have less domain-specific knowledge in\ntheir training corpora.\n  To overcome these challenges, we propose an explainable, multi-modal,\nmulti-agent framework for cryptocurrency investment. Our framework uses\nspecialized agents that collaborate within and across teams to handle subtasks\nsuch as data analysis, literature integration, and investment decision-making\nfor the top 30 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. The expert training\nmodule fine-tunes agents using multi-modal historical data and professional\ninvestment literature, while the multi-agent investment module employs\nreal-time data to make informed cryptocurrency investment decisions. Unique\nintrateam and interteam collaboration mechanisms enhance prediction accuracy by\nadjusting final predictions based on confidence levels within agent teams and\nfacilitating information sharing between teams. Empirical evaluation using data\nfrom November 2023 to September 2024 demonstrates that our framework\noutperforms single-agent models and market benchmarks in classification, asset\npricing, portfolio, and explainability performance.",

Collaborative inference\nmitigates this by assigning shallow feature extraction to edge devices and\noffloading features to the cloud for further inference, reducing computational\nload. However, transmitted features remain susceptible to model inversion\nattacks (MIAs), which can reconstruct original input data. Current defenses,\nsuch as perturbation and information bottleneck techniques, offer explainable\nprotection but face limitations, including the lack of standardized criteria\nfor assessing MIA difficulty, challenges in mutual information estimation, and\ntrade-offs among usability, privacy, and deployability.\n  To address these challenges, we introduce the first criterion to evaluate MIA\ndifficulty in collaborative inference, supported by theoretical analysis of\nexisting attacks and defenses, validated using experiments with the Mutual\nInformation Neural Estimator (MINE). Based on these findings, we propose\nSiftFunnel, a privacy-preserving framework for collaborative inference. The\nedge model is trained with linear and non-linear correlation constraints to\nreduce redundant information in transmitted features, enhancing privacy\nprotection. Label smoothing and a cloud-based upsampling module are added to\nbalance usability and privacy. To improve deployability, the edge model\nincorporates a funnel-shaped structure and attention mechanisms, preserving\nboth privacy and usability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SiftFunnel\noutperforms state-of-the-art defenses against MIAs, achieving superior privacy\nprotection with less than 3% accuracy loss and striking an optimal balance\namong usability, privacy, and practicality.",

Traditional approaches, which\nprimarily rely on recurrent units or Transformer layers to capture long-term\ndependencies, often fall short in addressing these challenges. Large Language\nModels (LLMs), with their robust sequential modeling capabilities and extensive\ncommonsense knowledge, present new opportunities for long-term action\nanticipation. In this work, we introduce the ActionLLM framework, a novel\napproach that treats video sequences as successive tokens, leveraging LLMs to\nanticipate future actions. Our baseline model simplifies the LLM architecture\nby setting future tokens, incorporating an action tuning module, and reducing\nthe textual decoder layer to a linear layer, enabling straightforward action\nprediction without the need for complex instructions or redundant descriptions.\nTo further harness the commonsense reasoning of LLMs, we predict action\ncategories for observed frames and use sequential textual clues to guide\nsemantic understanding. In addition, we introduce a Cross-Modality Interaction\nBlock, designed to explore the specificity within each modality and capture\ninteractions between vision and textual modalities, thereby enhancing\nmultimodal tuning. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the\nsuperiority of the proposed ActionLLM framework, encouraging a promising\ndirection to explore LLMs in the context of action anticipation.

Our baseline model simplifies the LLM architecture\nby setting future tokens, incorporating an action tuning module, and reducing\nthe textual decoder layer to a linear layer, enabling straightforward action\nprediction without the need for complex instructions or redundant descriptions.\nTo further harness the commonsense reasoning of LLMs, we predict action\ncategories for observed frames and use sequential textual clues to guide\nsemantic understanding. In addition, we introduce a Cross-Modality Interaction\nBlock, designed to explore the specificity within each modality and capture\ninteractions between vision and textual modalities, thereby enhancing\nmultimodal tuning. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the\nsuperiority of the proposed ActionLLM framework, encouraging a promising\ndirection to explore LLMs in the context of action anticipation.
