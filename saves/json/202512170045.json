Central to the model is a 4-regular side-information hypergraph G, a new adjacency representation A_G = [A_1 ... A_N], and a simple fitting criterion for sub-hypergraph validity, in the presence of specially designed hyperedges that capture both side information and cross-sender signal cancellation. This formulation establishes a tight achievability-converse equivalence for the general N-sender, K-receiver problem: every valid fitting induces a valid linear multi-sender index code, every linear code induces a valid fitting, and the optimal scalar linear broadcast length equals the hyper-minrank l**lin(G) = hyperminrank(G) = min*{A fits G} sum_{n=1}^N rank(A_n). Beyond this exact characterization, the approach yields hypergraph analogues of Haemers-type bounds on the broadcast length, including a clique-cover upper bound and a lower bound via the clique number of a carefully defined complement hypergraph. Algorithmically, we provide an exact procedure to compute hyperminrank(G), and show that in certain regimes its complexity is asymptotically better than approximate LT-CMAR solutions. The framework captures well-known settings such as embedded index coding, and applies directly to multi-sender cache-aided communications, coded computation, distributed storage, and edge/satellite systems, where hyperminrank can serve as a unified design target.",

While masked diffusion models (MDMs) offer a parallel alternative, they suffer from critical drawbacks: high computational overhead from precluding Key-Value (KV) caching, and incoherent generation arising from learning dependencies over an intractable space of token combinations. To address these limitations, we introduce ReFusion, a novel masked diffusion model that achieves superior performance and efficiency by elevating parallel decoding from the token level to a higher slot level, where each slot is a fixed-length, contiguous sub-sequence. This is achieved through an iterative ``plan-and-infill'' decoding process: a diffusion-based planning step first identifies a set of weakly dependent slots, and an autoregressive infilling step then decodes these selected slots in parallel. The slot-based design simultaneously unlocks full KV cache reuse with a unified causal framework and reduces the learning complexity from the token combination space to a manageable slot-level permutation space. Extensive experiments on seven diverse benchmarks show that ReFusion not only overwhelmingly surpasses prior MDMs with 34% performance gains and an over 18$\\times$ speedup on average, but also bridges the performance gap to strong ARMs while maintaining a 2.33$\\times$ average speedup.",

Existing acceleration techniques such as prefetching or expert clustering often increase energy usage or reduce expert diversity. We present SliceMoE, an energy-efficient MoE inference framework for miss-rate-constrained deployment. SliceMoE introduces Dynamic Bit-Sliced Caching (DBSC), which caches experts at slice-level granularity and assigns precision on demand to expand effective expert capacity. To support mixed-precision experts without memory duplication, we propose Calibration-Free Asymmetric Matryoshka Quantization (AMAT), a truncation-based scheme that maintains compatibility between low-bit and high-bit slices. We further introduce Predictive Cache Warmup (PCW) to reduce early-decode cold misses by reshaping cache contents during prefill. Evaluated on DeepSeek-V2-Lite and Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B, SliceMoE reduces decode-stage energy consumption by up to 2.37x and 2.85x, respectively, and improves decode latency by up to 1.81x and 1.64x, while preserving near-high-bit accuracy. These results demonstrate that slice-level caching enables an efficient on-device MoE deployment.",

We present SliceMoE, an energy-efficient MoE inference framework for miss-rate-constrained deployment. SliceMoE introduces Dynamic Bit-Sliced Caching (DBSC), which caches experts at slice-level granularity and assigns precision on demand to expand effective expert capacity. To support mixed-precision experts without memory duplication, we propose Calibration-Free Asymmetric Matryoshka Quantization (AMAT), a truncation-based scheme that maintains compatibility between low-bit and high-bit slices. We further introduce Predictive Cache Warmup (PCW) to reduce early-decode cold misses by reshaping cache contents during prefill. Evaluated on DeepSeek-V2-Lite and Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B, SliceMoE reduces decode-stage energy consumption by up to 2.37x and 2.85x, respectively, and improves decode latency by up to 1.81x and 1.64x, while preserving near-high-bit accuracy. These results demonstrate that slice-level caching enables an efficient on-device MoE deployment."

However, the strict synchronization required by on-policy algorithms introduces severe dependency bubbles, forcing one cluster to idle while the dependent phase is running on the other. We present RollMux, a cluster scheduling framework that reclaims these bubbles through cross-cluster orchestration. RollMux is built on the insight that the structural idleness of one job can be effectively utilized by the active phase of another. To realize this, we introduce the co-execution group abstraction, which partitions the cluster into isolated locality domains. This abstraction enables a two-tier scheduling architecture: an inter-group scheduler that optimizes job placement using conservative stochastic planning, and an intra-group scheduler that orchestrates a provably optimal round-robin schedule. The group abstraction also imposes a residency constraint, ensuring that massive model states remain cached in host memory to enable \"warm-star\" context switching. We evaluate RollMux on a production-scale testbed with 328 H20 and 328 H800 GPUs. RollMux improves cost efficiency by 1.84x over standard disaggregation and 1.38x over state-of-the-art co-located baselines, all while achieving 100% SLO attainment.",

To this end, we introduce SUPERGEN, an efficient tile-based framework for ultra-high-resolution video generation. SUPERGEN features a novel training-free algorithmic innovation with tiling to successfully support a wide range of resolutions without additional training efforts while significantly reducing both memory footprint and computational complexity. Moreover, SUPERGEN incorporates a tile-tailored, adaptive, region-aware caching strategy that accelerates video generation by exploiting redundancy across denoising steps and spatial regions. SUPERGEN also integrates cache-guided, communication-minimized tile parallelism for enhanced throughput and minimized latency. Evaluations show that SUPERGEN maximizes performance gains while achieving high output quality across various benchmarks.",

This alignment enables robust, calibration-free vector quantization using a single reusable codebook.

Recent cache-based adaptation approaches (e.g., Tip-Adapter) address this challenge to some extent by learning lightweight residual adapters over frozen features, yet they still inherit CLIP's tendency to encode global, general-purpose representations that are not optimally discriminative to adapt the generalist to the specialist's domain in low-data regimes. We address this limitation with a novel patch-driven relational refinement that learns cache adapter weights from intra-image patch dependencies rather than treating an image embedding as a monolithic vector. Specifically, we introduce a relational gated graph attention network that constructs a patch graph and performs edge-aware attention to emphasize informative inter-patch interactions, producing context-enriched patch embeddings. A learnable multi-aggregation pooling then composes these into compact, task-discriminative representations that better align cache keys with the target few-shot classes. Crucially, the proposed graph refinement is used only during training to distil relational structure into the cache, incurring no additional inference cost beyond standard cache lookup. Final predictions are obtained by a residual fusion of cache similarity scores with CLIP zero-shot logits. Extensive evaluations on 11 benchmarks show consistent gains over state-of-the-art CLIP adapter and cache-based baselines while preserving zero-shot efficiency. We further validate battlefield relevance by introducing an Injured vs. Uninjured Soldier dataset for casualty recognition.

However, these models face fundamental memory and computational challenges because their key-value (KV) caches grow substantially with continuous streaming video input. This process requires an iterative prefill stage, which is a unique feature of streaming video LLMs. Due to its iterative prefill stage, it suffers from significant limitations, including extensive computation, substantial data transfer, and degradation in accuracy. Crucially, this issue is exacerbated for edge deployment, which is the primary target for these models.\n  In this work, we propose V-Rex, the first software-hardware co-designed accelerator that comprehensively addresses both algorithmic and hardware bottlenecks in streaming video LLM inference. At its core, V-Rex introduces ReSV, a training-free dynamic KV cache retrieval algorithm. ReSV exploits temporal and spatial similarity-based token clustering to reduce excessive KV cache memory across video frames. To fully realize these algorithmic benefits, V-Rex offers a compact, low-latency hardware accelerator with a dynamic KV cache retrieval engine (DRE), featuring bit-level and early-exit based computing units. V-Rex achieves unprecedented real-time of 3.9-8.3 FPS and energy-efficient streaming video LLM inference on edge deployment with negligible accuracy loss. While DRE only accounts for 2.2% power and 2.0% area, the system delivers 1.9-19.7x speedup and 3.1-18.5x energy efficiency improvements over AGX Orin GPU. This work is the first to comprehensively tackle KV cache retrieval across algorithms and hardware, enabling real-time streaming video LLM inference on resource-constrained edge devices.",

We analyze performance across various interconnects and find that CXL memory sharing achieves 7.2x-8.1x lower latency than TCP-based interconnects deployed in small- and medium-scale clusters. We address challenges of CXL memory sharing for MPI communication, including data object management over the dax representation [50], cache coherence, and atomic operations. Overall, cMPI outperforms TCP over standard Ethernet NIC and high-end SmartNIC by up to 49x and 72x in latency and bandwidth, respectively, for small messages.",

We analyze performance across various interconnects and find that CXL memory sharing achieves 7.2x-8.1x lower latency than TCP-based interconnects deployed in small- and medium-scale clusters. We address challenges of CXL memory sharing for MPI communication, including data object management over the dax representation [50], cache coherence, and atomic operations. Overall, cMPI outperforms TCP over standard Ethernet NIC and high-end SmartNIC by up to 49x and 72x in latency and bandwidth, respectively, for small messages."

However, as prompts grow to tens of thousands of tokens, edge hardware performance drops sharply with sequence length due to quadratic prefill cost and rapidly increasing KV-cache bandwidth demands, making inference latency of longer context length a first-order system concern. Recent studies on LLMs expose a fundamental prefill-decode asymmetry: prefill is compute-bound and dominated by dense matrix-matrix operations, whereas decoding is memory-bandwidth-bound and dominated by KV-cache traffic. A static accelerator must provision resources and a single dataflow for both regimes, leading to duplicated attention logic, underutilized fabric, and tight LUT/URAM limits that cap model size and usable context. We propose a prefill--decode disaggregated LLM accelerator, PD-Swap, that uses Dynamic Partial Reconfiguration (DPR) to time-multiplex the attention module on edge FPGAs. The core table-lookup ternary matrix multiplication and weight-buffering engines remain static, while the attention subsystem is a reconfigurable partition with two phase-specialized architectures: a compute-heavy, token-parallel prefill engine and a bandwidth-optimized, KV-cache-centric decoding engine. A roofline-inspired model and design space exploration jointly optimize reconfigurable-region size, parallelism under reconfiguration and routability constraints, and reconfiguration latency is hidden by computation latency.

                    "value": "Aggressively quantized large language models (LLMs), such as BitNet-style 1.58-bit Transformers with ternary weights, make it feasible to deploy generative AI on low-power edge FPGAs. However, as prompts grow to tens of thousands of tokens, edge hardware performance drops sharply with sequence length due to quadratic prefill cost and rapidly increasing KV-cache bandwidth demands, making inference latency of longer context length a first-order system concern. Recent studies on LLMs expose a fundamental prefill-decode asymmetry: prefill is compute-bound and dominated by dense matrix-matrix operations, whereas decoding is memory-bandwidth-bound and dominated by KV-cache traffic. A static accelerator must provision resources and a single dataflow for both regimes, leading to duplicated attention logic, underutilized fabric, and tight LUT/URAM limits that cap model size and usable context. We propose a prefill--decode disaggregated LLM accelerator, PD-Swap, that uses Dynamic Partial Reconfiguration (DPR) to time-multiplex the attention module on edge FPGAs. The core table-lookup ternary matrix multiplication and weight-buffering engines remain static, while the attention subsystem is a reconfigurable partition with two phase-specialized architectures: a compute-heavy, token-parallel prefill engine and a bandwidth-optimized, KV-cache-centric decoding engine. A roofline-inspired model and design space exploration jointly optimize reconfigurable-region size, parallelism under reconfiguration and routability constraints, and reconfiguration latency is hidden by computation latency. PD-Swap achieves up to 27~tokens/s decoding throughput, outperforming prior state-of-the-art works by 1.3x--2.1x (larger gains at longer context lengths), without extra area cost."

To address these limitations, we introduce \\textbf{FilmWeaver}, a novel framework designed to generate consistent, multi-shot videos of arbitrary length. First, it employs an autoregressive diffusion paradigm to achieve arbitrary-length video generation. To address the challenge of consistency, our key insight is to decouple the problem into inter-shot consistency and intra-shot coherence. We achieve this through a dual-level cache mechanism: a shot memory caches keyframes from preceding shots to maintain character and scene identity, while a temporal memory retains a history of frames from the current shot to ensure smooth, continuous motion. The proposed framework allows for flexible, multi-round user interaction to create multi-shot videos. Furthermore, due to this decoupled design, our method demonstrates high versatility by supporting downstream tasks such as multi-concept injection and video extension. To facilitate the training of our consistency-aware method, we also developed a comprehensive pipeline to construct a high-quality multi-shot video dataset. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method surpasses existing approaches on metrics for both consistency and aesthetic quality, opening up new possibilities for creating more consistent, controllable, and narrative-driven video content.

Both as-fabricated Cr2O3 and NiOx HJDs exhibited forward current density in a range of 130-150 A/cm^2 at 5 V with rectifying ratios >10^10 and a reverse leakage current density at 10^-8 A/cm^2 at -5 V. The differential specific on-resistance of Cr2O3 and NiOx HJDs was 12.01 mΩ*cm^2 and 12.05 mΩ*cm^2, respectively. Breakdown voltages of Cr2O3 HJDs ranged from 1.4-1.9 kV and 1.5-2.3 kV for NiOx HJDs. Theoretical band alignment between Cr2O3 and \\b{eta}-Ga2O3 was calculated from first principles. The ambient exposed NiOx/HVPE \\b{eta}-Ga2O3 HJDs forward current density degraded after 10 days while that of Cr2O3/HVPE \\b{eta}-Ga2O3 HJDs remained nearly unchanged after the same amount of time. It was later confirmed that the ambient exposed sputtered NiOx sheet resistance (Rsh) degradation gave rise to the reduction of the forward current density of the NiOx based HJDs, and water (H2O) was qualitatively determined to be the agent attributed to the forward conduction degradation by measuring the Rsh of NiOx-on-sapphire reference wafer after exposing it to different environments. The Cr2O3/HVPE \\b{eta}-Ga2O3 HJD also exhibited enhanced thermal stability compared to the NiOx/\\b{eta}-Ga2O3 heterostructures at elevated temperatures. Interfacial nickel gallate (Ga2NiO4) phase formation expected from phase diagrams can explain the reduced thermal stability of NiOx/\\b{eta}-Ga2O3 HJDs. This study indicates that Cr2O3 is a stable p-type oxide for the realization of robust multi-kV \\b{eta}-Ga2O3 HJDs.",

In this study, we propose REST, the first diffusion-based, real-time, end-to-end streaming audio-driven talking head generation framework. To support real-time end-to-end generation, a compact video latent space is first learned through high spatiotemporal VAE compression. Additionally, to enable autoregressive streaming within the compact video latent space, we introduce an ID-Context Cache mechanism, which integrates ID-Sink and Context-Cache principles to key-value caching for maintaining temporal consistency and identity coherence during long-time streaming generation. Furthermore, an Asynchronous Streaming Distillation (ASD) training strategy is proposed to mitigate error accumulation in autoregressive generation and enhance temporal consistency, which leverages a non-streaming teacher with an asynchronous noise schedule to supervise the training of the streaming student model. REST bridges the gap between autoregressive and diffusion-based approaches, demonstrating substantial value for applications requiring real-time talking head generation. Experimental results demonstrate that REST outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both generation speed and overall performance.",

In this paper, we propose CachePrune, a defense method that identifies and prunes task-triggering neurons from the KV cache of the input prompt context. By pruning such neurons, we encourage the LLM to interpret the input prompt context purely as data rather than as cues for instruction following. To identify these neurons, we introduce a neural attribution mechanism guided by a preferential attribution loss, which enables effective attribution with only a few samples while preserving response quality after pruning. We further enhance the efficacy of neural attribution by leveraging an observed triggering effect inherent in the model's response generation behavior. Notably, our approach does not impose additional formatting on the prompt or introduce extra test-time LLM calls.

We demonstrate an ultra-low-power electric-field control of altermagnetism in MnTe through strain-mediated coupling in MnTe/PMN-PT heterostructures with negligible Joule heating. Application of +6 kV/cm electric fields induces piezoelectric strain in PMN-PT, modulating the Néel temperature from 310 to 328 K. As a result, around the magnetic phase transition, the altermagnetic spin splitting of MnTe is reversibly switched \"on\" and \"off\" by the electric fields. Meanwhile, the piezoelectric strain generates lattice distortions and magnetic structure changes in MnTe, enabling up to 9.7% resistance modulation around the magnetic phase transition temperature. Leveraging this effect, we implement programmable resistance states in a Hopfield neuromorphic network, achieving 100% pattern recognition accuracy at <=40% noise levels. This approach establishes the electric-field control as a low-power strategy for altermagnetic manipulation while demonstrating the viability of altermagnetic materials for energy-efficient neuromorphic computing beyond conventional charge-based architectures.",

While existing caching strategies primarily focus on reducing local heuristic errors, they often overlook the accumulation of global errors, leading to noticeable content degradation between accelerated and original videos. To address this issue, we formulate cache scheduling as a directed graph with error-weighted edges and introduce a Lexicographic Minimax Path Optimization strategy that explicitly bounds the worst-case path error. This approach substantially improves the consistency of global content and style across generated frames. Extensive experiments on multiple text-to-video benchmarks demonstrate that LeMiCa delivers dual improvements in both inference speed and generation quality. Notably, our method achieves a 2.9x speedup on the Latte model and reaches an LPIPS score of 0.05 on Open-Sora, outperforming prior caching techniques. Importantly, these gains come with minimal perceptual quality degradation, making LeMiCa a robust and generalizable paradigm for accelerating diffusion-based video generation. We believe this approach can serve as a strong foundation for future research on efficient and reliable video synthesis. Our code is available at :https://github.com/UnicomAI/LeMiCa",

We recognize two key issues that contribute to the overhead: (1) the quadratic computational burden from processing long-horizon historical observations as massive sequences of tokens, and (2) the exploration-efficiency trade-off in DAgger, i.e., a data aggregation process of collecting agent-explored trajectories. While more exploration yields effective error-recovery trajectories for handling test-time distribution shifts, it comes at the cost of longer trajectory lengths for both training and inference. To address these challenges, we propose Efficient-VLN, a training-efficient VLN model. Specifically, to mitigate the token processing burden, we design two efficient memory mechanisms: a progressive memory that dynamically allocates more tokens to recent observations, and a learnable recursive memory that utilizes the key-value cache of learnable tokens as the memory state. Moreover, we introduce a dynamic mixed policy to balance the exploration-efficiency trade-off. Extensive experiments show that Efficient-VLN achieves state-of-the-art performance on R2R-CE (64.2% SR) and RxR-CE (67.0% SR). Critically, our model consumes merely 282 H800 GPU hours, demonstrating a dramatic reduction in training overhead compared to state-of-the-art methods.",

We implement a dual-branch conditioning framework, one optimized for CT intensity driven scattering in volumetric data and the other for real-world RGB scenes through normalized camera embeddings. To address scale ambiguity and maintain structural realism, we present a hybrid pose agnostic anchoring method that adaptively samples scene depth and material transitions, functioning as stable pivots during scene distillation. Our design integrates preoperative radiography simulation and consumer-grade 360° rendering into a singular inference pipeline, facilitating rapid, photorealistic view synthesis with inherent directionality. Evaluations on the Mip-NeRF 360, RealEstate10K, and DeepDRR datasets indicate superior SSIM and LPIPS performance, while runtime assessments confirm its viability for interactive applications.

To address scale ambiguity and maintain structural realism, we present a hybrid pose agnostic anchoring method that adaptively samples scene depth and material transitions, functioning as stable pivots during scene distillation. Our design integrates preoperative radiography simulation and consumer-grade 360° rendering into a singular inference pipeline, facilitating rapid, photorealistic view synthesis with inherent directionality. Evaluations on the Mip-NeRF 360, RealEstate10K, and DeepDRR datasets indicate superior SSIM and LPIPS performance, while runtime assessments confirm its viability for interactive applications. Disentangled360 facilitates mixed-reality medical supervision, robotic perception, and immersive content creation, eliminating the necessity for scene-specific finetuning or expensive photon simulations."

To effectively deploy large MoE models on memory-constrained devices, many systems introduce *expert offloading* that caches a subset of experts in fast memory, leaving others on slow memory to run on CPU or load on demand. While some research has exploited the locality of expert activations, where consecutive tokens activate similar experts, the degree of this **local routing consistency** varies across models and remains understudied. In this paper, we propose two metrics to measure local routing consistency of MoE models: (1) **Segment Routing Best Performance (SRP)**, which evaluates how well a fixed group of experts can cover the needs of a segment of tokens, and (2) **Segment Cache Best Hit Rate (SCH)**, which measures the hit rate of an expert cache utilizing a length of future information under a cache limit. We analyze 20 MoE LLMs with diverse sizes and architectures and use toy models to verify key factors related to local routing consistency. We find a strong trade-off between local routing consistency and *local* load balance, while showing that *global* load balance can coexist with local routing consistency. Meanwhile, settings like shared experts that decrease expert combination space can lead to low local routing consistency. We further reveal that domain-specialized experts contribute more to routing consistency than vocabulary-specialized ones, and that most models balance between cache effectiveness and efficiency with cache sizes approximately twice the active experts.

                "summary": "Finite-element (FE) discretisations have emerged as a powerful real-space alternative to large-scale Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT) calculations, offering systematic convergence, excellent parallel scalability, while accommodating generic boundary conditions. However, the dominant computational bottleneck in FE-based DFT arises from the repeated application of the discretised sparse Hamiltonian to large blocks of trial vectors during iterations in an iterative eigensolver. Traditional sparse matrix-vector multiplications and FE cell-matrix approaches encounter memory limitations and high data-movement overheads, particularly at higher polynomial orders, typically used in DFT calculations. To overcome these challenges, this work develops matrix-free algorithms for FE-discretised DFT that substantially accelerate these products by doing on-the-fly operations that utilize structured tensor contractions over 1D basis functions and quadrature data. A unified multilevel batched data layout that handles both real and complex-valued operators is introduced to maximise cache reuse and SIMD utilisation on Frontier (AVX2), Param Pravega (AVX512) and Fugaku (SVE).

Extensive benchmarks show that for large multivector pseudopotential DFT calculations, the matrix-free kernels deliver 1.5-4x speedups over the state-of-the-art cell-matrix approach baselines. For all-electron DFT calculations, the matrix-free operator achieves gains of up to 5.8x due to its efficient implementation and superior arithmetic intensity. When integrated with an error-tolerant Chebyshev-filtered subspace iteration eigensolver, the matrix-free formalism yields substantial reductions in end-to-end time-to-solution using FE meshes that deliver desired accuracies in ground-state properties.",

However, the dominant computational bottleneck in FE-based DFT arises from the repeated application of the discretised sparse Hamiltonian to large blocks of trial vectors during iterations in an iterative eigensolver. Traditional sparse matrix-vector multiplications and FE cell-matrix approaches encounter memory limitations and high data-movement overheads, particularly at higher polynomial orders, typically used in DFT calculations.

It is crucial to accurately predict the content that VUs are interested in without exposing their privacy. Traditional federated learning (FL) can protect user privacy by sharing models rather than raw data. However, the training of FL requires frequent model transmission, which can result in significant communication overhead. Additionally, vehicles may leave the road side unit (RSU) coverage area before training is completed, leading to training failures. To address these issues, in this letter, we propose a federated distillation-assisted vehicle edge caching scheme based on lightweight denoising diffusion probabilistic model (LDPM). The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed vehicle edge caching scheme has good robustness to variations in vehicle speed, significantly reducing communication overhead and improving cache hit percentage.",

Additionally, vehicles may leave the road side unit (RSU) coverage area before training is completed, leading to training failures. To address these issues, in this letter, we propose a federated distillation-assisted vehicle edge caching scheme based on lightweight denoising diffusion probabilistic model (LDPM). The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed vehicle edge caching scheme has good robustness to variations in vehicle speed, significantly reducing communication overhead and improving cache hit percentage."

To address these challenges, we develop a Trustworthy Decentralized Cooperative Caching (TDC-Cache) framework for Web3.0 to ensure efficient caching and enhance system resilience against adversarial threats. This framework features a two-layer architecture, wherein the Decentralized Oracle Network (DON) layer serves as a trusted intermediary platform for decentralized caching, bridging the contents from decentralized storage and the content requests from users.

Furthermore, we develop a Proof of Cooperative Learning (PoCL) consensus to maintain the consistency of decentralized caching decisions within DON. Experimental results show that, compared with existing approaches, the proposed framework reduces average access latency by 20%, increases the cache hit rate by at most 18%, and improves the average success consensus rate by 10%.

                "summary": "Window attention and linear attention represent two principal strategies for mitigating the quadratic complexity and ever-growing KV cache in Vision-Language Models (VLMs). However, we observe that window-based VLMs suffer performance degradation when sequence length exceeds the window size, while linear attention underperforms on information-intensive tasks such as OCR and document understanding. To overcome these limitations, we propose InfiniteVL, a linear-complexity VLM architecture that synergizes sliding window attention (SWA) with Gated DeltaNet. For achieving competitive multimodal performance under constrained resources, we design a three-stage training strategy comprising distillation pretraining, instruction tuning, and long-sequence SFT. Remarkably, using less than 2\\% of the training data required by leading VLMs, InfiniteVL not only substantially outperforms previous linear-complexity VLMs but also matches the performance of leading Transformer-based VLMs, while demonstrating effective long-term memory retention. Compared to similar-sized Transformer-based VLMs accelerated by FlashAttention-2, InfiniteVL achieves over 3.6\\times inference speedup while maintaining constant latency and memory footprint. In streaming video understanding scenarios, it sustains a stable 24 FPS real-time prefill speed while preserving long-term memory cache.

However, this efficiency optimization introduces significant yet underexplored privacy risks. This paper provides the first comprehensive analysis of these vulnerabilities, demonstrating that an attacker can reconstruct sensitive user inputs directly from the KV-cache. We design and implement three distinct attack vectors: a direct Inversion Attack, a more broadly applicable and potent Collision Attack, and a semantic-based Injection Attack. These methods demonstrate the practicality and severity of KV-cache privacy leakage issues. To mitigate this, we propose KV-Cloak, a novel, lightweight, and efficient defense mechanism. KV-Cloak uses a reversible matrix-based obfuscation scheme, combined with operator fusion, to secure the KV-cache. Our extensive experiments show that KV-Cloak effectively thwarts all proposed attacks, reducing reconstruction quality to random noise. Crucially, it achieves this robust security with virtually no degradation in model accuracy and minimal performance overhead, offering a practical solution for trustworthy LLM deployment.",

We design and implement three distinct attack vectors: a direct Inversion Attack, a more broadly applicable and potent Collision Attack, and a semantic-based Injection Attack. These methods demonstrate the practicality and severity of KV-cache privacy leakage issues. To mitigate this, we propose KV-Cloak, a novel, lightweight, and efficient defense mechanism. KV-Cloak uses a reversible matrix-based obfuscation scheme, combined with operator fusion, to secure the KV-cache. Our extensive experiments show that KV-Cloak effectively thwarts all proposed attacks, reducing reconstruction quality to random noise. Crucially, it achieves this robust security with virtually no degradation in model accuracy and minimal performance overhead, offering a practical solution for trustworthy LLM deployment."

We present MotionStream, enabling sub-second latency with up to 29 FPS streaming generation on a single GPU. Our approach begins by augmenting a text-to-video model with motion control, which generates high-quality videos that adhere to the global text prompt and local motion guidance, but does not perform inference on the fly. As such, we distill this bidirectional teacher into a causal student through Self Forcing with Distribution Matching Distillation, enabling real-time streaming inference. Several key challenges arise when generating videos of long, potentially infinite time-horizons -- (1) bridging the domain gap from training on finite length and extrapolating to infinite horizons, (2) sustaining high quality by preventing error accumulation, and (3) maintaining fast inference, without incurring growth in computational cost due to increasing context windows. A key to our approach is introducing carefully designed sliding-window causal attention, combined with attention sinks. By incorporating self-rollout with attention sinks and KV cache rolling during training, we properly simulate inference-time extrapolations with a fixed context window, enabling constant-speed generation of arbitrarily long videos. Our models achieve state-of-the-art results in motion following and video quality while being two orders of magnitude faster, uniquely enabling infinite-length streaming. With MotionStream, users can paint trajectories, control cameras, or transfer motion, and see results unfold in real-time, delivering a truly interactive experience.",

While early research focused on unconditional sampling, practitioners now demand controllable generation that allows precise specification of layout, pose, motion, or style. While ControlNet grants precise spatial-temporal control, its auxiliary branch markedly increases latency and introduces redundant computation in both uncontrolled regions and denoising steps, especially for video. To address this problem, we introduce EVCtrl, a lightweight, plug-and-play control adapter that slashes overhead without retraining the model. Specifically, we propose a spatio-temporal dual caching strategy for sparse control information. For spatial redundancy, we first profile how each layer of DiT-ControlNet responds to fine-grained control, then partition the network into global and local functional zones. A locality-aware cache focuses computation on the local zones that truly need the control signal, skipping the bulk of redundant computation in global regions. For temporal redundancy, we selectively omit unnecessary denoising steps to improve efficiency. Extensive experiments on CogVideo-Controlnet, Wan2.1-Controlnet, and Flux demonstrate that our method is effective in image and video control generation without the need for training. For example, it achieves 2.16 and 2.05 times speedups on CogVideo-Controlnet and Wan2.1-Controlnet, respectively, with almost no degradation in generation quality.Codes are available in the supplementary materials.",

By doing so, HACK effectively constrains the average KV cache length within a fixed budget $B$, reducing the theoretical attention complexity from $\\mathcal{O}(n^4)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(Bn^2)$. Extensive experiments on multiple VAR models across text-to-image and class-conditional tasks validate the effectiveness and generalizability of HACK.

The KV cache grows with sequence length and embedding dimension, often exceeding the memory footprint of the model itself and limiting achievable batch sizes and context windows. To address this challenge, we present KV CAR, a unified and architecture agnostic framework that significantly reduces KV cache storage while maintaining model fidelity. KV CAR combines two complementary techniques. First, a lightweight autoencoder learns compact representations of key and value tensors along the embedding dimension, compressing them before they are stored in the KV cache and restoring them upon retrieval. Second, a similarity driven reuse mechanism identifies opportunities to reuse KV tensors of specific attention heads across adjacent layers. Together, these methods reduce the dimensional and structural redundancy in KV tensors without requiring changes to the transformer architecture. Evaluations on GPT 2 and TinyLLaMA models across Wikitext, C4, PIQA, and Winogrande datasets demonstrate that KV CAR achieves up to 47.85 percent KV cache memory reduction with minimal impact on perplexity and zero shot accuracy. System level measurements on an NVIDIA A40 GPU show that the reduced KV footprint directly translates into longer sequence lengths and larger batch sizes during inference. These results highlight the effectiveness of KV CAR in enabling memory efficient LLM inference.",

Combined with lookup table (LUT)-based inference, CPUs run these ultra-low-bit LLMs even faster than NPUs, opening new opportunities for ubiquitous on-device intelligence.\n  However, this paper identifies that LUT-based inference underutilizes memory bandwidth during parallel inference, which is required for prefilling, test-time scaling, and other multi-token scenarios. The root cause is the scalar LUT paradigm, which performs repetitive and non-contiguous memory accesses for each token.\n  To solve the issue, we propose vector LUT, a new lookup paradigm that constructs a unified LUT across parallel tokens, and performs a single $1 \\rightarrow N$ lookup per index.

It employs a smaller model to generate a draft token sequence, which is then verified by the original base model. In multi-GPU systems, inference latency can be further reduced through tensor parallelism (TP), while the optimal TP size of the draft model is typically smaller than that of the base model, leading to GPU idling during the drafting stage. We observe that such inefficiency stems from the sequential execution of layers, which is seemingly natural but actually unnecessary. Therefore, we propose EasySpec, a layer-parallel speculation strategy that optimizes the efficiency of multi-GPU utilization. EasySpec breaks the inter-layer data dependencies in the draft model, enabling multiple layers to run simultaneously across multiple devices as 'fuzzy' speculation. After each drafting-and-verification iteration, the draft model's key-value cache is calibrated in a single forward pass, preventing long-term fuzzy-error accumulation at minimal additional latency. EasySpec is a training-free and plug-in method. We evaluated EasySpec on several mainstream open-source LLMs, using smaller versions of models from the same series as drafters. The results demonstrate that EasySpec can achieve a peak speedup of 4.17x compared to vanilla decoding, while preserving the original distributions of the base LLMs. Specifically, the drafting stage can be accelerated by up to 1.62x with a maximum speculation accuracy drop of only 7%.

As a result, they rely on generic kernels that suffer from poor cache locality, excessive memory movement, and substantial intermediate allocations. To address these limitations, we present Morphling, a domain-specific code synthesizer designed to bridge this gap. Morphling compiles high-level GNN specifications into portable, backend-specialized implementations targeting OpenMP, CUDA, and MPI.

Morphling also incorporates a runtime sparsity-aware execution engine that dynamically selects dense or sparse execution paths using input feature statistics, reducing unnecessary computation on zero-valued entries. We evaluate Morphling on eleven real-world datasets spanning diverse graph structures, feature dimensionalities, and sparsity regimes. Morphling improves per-epoch training throughput by an average of 20X on CPUs, 19X on GPUs, and 6X in distributed settings over PyG and DGL, with peak speedups reaching 66X. Morphling's memory-efficient layouts further reduce peak memory consumption by up to 15X, enabling large-scale GNN training on commodity hardware.

                "summary": "KV cache has traditionally been stored in GPU memory to accelerate the decoding phase of large language model (LLM) inference. However, it is increasingly necessary to move KV caches outside GPU devices, to enable cache reuse across different queries and inference engines. Our real-world usage statistics confirm this trend: over time, the total KV cache stored by users has grown rapidly, far exceeding the capacity of GPU memory. Despite this need, there lacks an efficient solution for offloading and transferring KV caches. We present LMCACHE, the first and so far the most efficient open-source KV caching solution, which extracts and stores KV caches generated by modern LLM engines (vLLM and SGLang) out of the GPU memory and shares them across engines and queries. LMCACHE supports both cache offloading (prefix reuse across queries) and prefill-decode (PD) disaggregation (cross-engine/GPU cache transfer). LMCACHE's high performance and wide adoption stem from the following contributions: (1) highly optimized KV cache data movement powered by batched data movement operations, compute and I/O pipelining; (2) a modular KV cache connector component, decoupling LMCACHE from the rapid evolution of inference engines; (3) a first-class control API for flexible cache orchestration across GPU, CPU, storage, and network layers. Our evaluation shows that combining LMCACHE with vLLM achieves up to 15x improvement in throughput across workloads such as multi-round question answering and document analysis. Large-scale adoption of LMCACHE in enterprise settings provides us valuable insights, for example, fetching KV cache from remote storage has unsurprisingly benefits to prefill delay, and that context truncation, which is a widely applied technique in industry, can greatly reduce prefix cache hit ratio by half.

To overcome this, we introduce Deep Forcing, which consists of two training-free mechanisms that address this without any fine-tuning. Specifically, 1) Deep Sink dedicates half of the sliding window to persistent sink tokens and re-aligns their temporal RoPE phase to the current timeline, stabilizing global context during long rollouts. 2) Participative Compression performs importance-aware KV cache pruning that preserves only tokens actively participating in recent attention while safely discarding redundant and degraded history, minimizing error accumulation under out-of-distribution length generation. Together, these components enable over 12x extrapolation (e.g. 5s-trained to 60s+ generation) with better imaging quality than LongLive, better aesthetic quality than RollingForcing, almost maintaining overall consistency, and substantial gains in dynamic degree, all while maintaining real-time generation.

To address this, we propose LiteVGGT, achieving up to 10x speedup and substantial memory reduction, enabling efficient processing of 1000-image scenes. We derive two key insights for 3D reconstruction: (1) tokens from local image regions have inherent geometric correlations, leading to high similarity and computational redundancy; (2) token similarity across adjacent network layers remains stable, allowing for reusable merge decisions. Guided by these, we design a simple yet efficient strategy, dubbed geometry-aware cached token merging. We analyze each token's geometric importance, optimizing anchor token selection to better preserve key information for reconstruction. We also cache and reuse merge indices across layers, substantially reducing latency with minimal accuracy impact. This strategy retains VGGT's core performance, enabling efficient fine-tuning and FP8 quantization for further gains.

                "summary": "Autoregressive (AR) visual generation has emerged as a powerful paradigm for image and multimodal synthesis, owing to its scalability and generality. However, existing AR image generation suffers from severe memory bottlenecks due to the need to cache all previously generated visual tokens during decoding, leading to both high storage requirements and low throughput. In this paper, we introduce \\textbf{LineAR}, a novel, training-free progressive key-value (KV) cache compression pipeline for autoregressive image generation. By fully exploiting the intrinsic characteristics of visual attention, LineAR manages the cache at the line level using a 2D view, preserving the visual dependency regions while progressively evicting less-informative tokens that are harmless for subsequent line generation, guided by inter-line attention. LineAR enables efficient autoregressive (AR) image generation by utilizing only a few lines of cache, achieving both memory savings and throughput speedup, while maintaining or even improving generation quality. Extensive experiments across six autoregressive image generation models, including class-conditional and text-to-image generation, validate its effectiveness and generality. LineAR improves ImageNet FID from 2.77 to 2.68 and COCO FID from 23.85 to 22.86 on LlamaGen-XL and Janus-Pro-1B, while retaining only 1/6 KV cache. It also improves DPG on Lumina-mGPT-768 with just 1/8 KV cache. Additionally, LineAR achieves significant memory and throughput gains, including up to 67.61% memory reduction and 7.57x speedup on LlamaGen-XL, and 39.66% memory reduction and 5.62x speedup on Janus-Pro-7B.",

                    "value": "Autoregressive (AR) visual generation has emerged as a powerful paradigm for image and multimodal synthesis, owing to its scalability and generality. However, existing AR image generation suffers from severe memory bottlenecks due to the need to cache all previously generated visual tokens during decoding, leading to both high storage requirements and low throughput. In this paper, we introduce \\textbf{LineAR}, a novel, training-free progressive key-value (KV) cache compression pipeline for autoregressive image generation. By fully exploiting the intrinsic characteristics of visual attention, LineAR manages the cache at the line level using a 2D view, preserving the visual dependency regions while progressively evicting less-informative tokens that are harmless for subsequent line generation, guided by inter-line attention.

However, most existing approaches address only one of these aspects in isolation, as achieving all three simultaneously is highly challenging-for example, long-term memory mechanisms often degrade real-time performance. In this work, we present RELIC, a unified framework that tackles these three challenges altogether. Given a single image and a text description, RELIC enables memory-aware, long-duration exploration of arbitrary scenes in real time. Built upon recent autoregressive video-diffusion distillation techniques, our model represents long-horizon memory using highly compressed historical latent tokens encoded with both relative actions and absolute camera poses within the KV cache. This compact, camera-aware memory structure supports implicit 3D-consistent content retrieval and enforces long-term coherence with minimal computational overhead. In parallel, we fine-tune a bidirectional teacher video model to generate sequences beyond its original 5-second training horizon, and transform it into a causal student generator using a new memory-efficient self-forcing paradigm that enables full-context distillation over long-duration teacher as well as long student self-rollouts. Implemented as a 14B-parameter model and trained on a curated Unreal Engine-rendered dataset, RELIC achieves real-time generation at 16 FPS while demonstrating more accurate action following, more stable long-horizon streaming, and more robust spatial-memory retrieval compared with prior work. These capabilities establish RELIC as a strong foundation for the next generation of interactive world modeling.",

                "summary": "Attention mechanisms are the core of foundation models, but their quadratic complexity remains a critical bottleneck for scaling. This challenge has driven the development of efficient attention mechanisms, with sparsity emerging as the dominant paradigm. Current methods typically retain or discard entire key-value blocks with binary masks, resulting in substantial information loss under high sparsity. To mitigate this gap, we present Pyramid Sparse Attention (PSA), a versatile module applicable to both video understanding and generation tasks. Instead of binary masking, PSA introduces multi-level pooled KV representations, enabling finer mask granularity. Specifically, each query block dynamically allocates lower pooling levels to critical KV blocks and higher levels to less important ones, creating an informative interpolation between full retention and complete pruning. This design, analogous to fixed-point quantization and classical feature pyramid networks in computer vision, effectively mitigates information loss while preserving computational efficiency under a low compute budget. It works with a native, hardware-friendly kernel that leverages decoupled block-tile design to ensure efficient execution. Across video understanding and generation benchmarks, PSA preserves contextual information and visual fidelity, consistently outperforming or achieving comparable performance over existing sparse attention baselines with superior efficiency-quality trade-offs.

                    "value": "Attention mechanisms are the core of foundation models, but their quadratic complexity remains a critical bottleneck for scaling. This challenge has driven the development of efficient attention mechanisms, with sparsity emerging as the dominant paradigm. Current methods typically retain or discard entire key-value blocks with binary masks, resulting in substantial information loss under high sparsity. To mitigate this gap, we present Pyramid Sparse Attention (PSA), a versatile module applicable to both video understanding and generation tasks.

Although Cross-layer KV Cache sharing (e.g., YOCO, CLA) offers a path to mitigate KV Cache bottleneck, it typically underperforms within-layer methods like GQA. To understand the root cause, we investigate the information flow of keys and values of the top-layers. Our preliminary reveals a clear distribution: values are predominantly derived from the bottom layer, while keys draw more information from both bottom and middle layers. Building upon this, we propose FusedKV, whose top-layer KV caches are a learnable fusion of the most informative ones from the bottom and middle layers. This fusion operates directly on post-RoPE keys, preserving relative positional information without the computational cost of re-applying rotary embeddings. To further improve efficiency, we propose FusedKV-Lite, an cross-layer sharing approach, where top-layer KV caches are directly derived from the bottom-layer values and the middle-layer keys. Compared to FusedKV, FusedKV-Lite reduces I/O overhead at the cost of a slight increase in perplexity.

Existing learning-based approaches ground spatial understanding in limited scene dataset, restricting generalization to new layouts. We instead reprogram a pre-trained 3D instance generator to act as a scene level learner, replacing dataset-bounded supervision with model-centric spatial supervision. This reprogramming unlocks the generator transferable spatial knowledge, enabling generalization to unseen layouts and novel object compositions. Remarkably, spatial reasoning still emerges even when the training scenes are randomly composed objects. This demonstrates that the generator's transferable scene prior provides a rich learning signal for inferring proximity, support, and symmetry from purely geometric cues. Replacing widely used canonical space, we instantiate this insight with a view-centric formulation of the scene space, yielding a fully feed-forward, generalizable scene generator that learns spatial relations directly from the instance model. Quantitative and qualitative results show that a 3D instance generator is an implicit spatial learner and reasoner, pointing toward foundation models for interactive 3D scene understanding and generation.

Remarkably, spatial reasoning still emerges even when the training scenes are randomly composed objects. This demonstrates that the generator's transferable scene prior provides a rich learning signal for inferring proximity, support, and symmetry from purely geometric cues. Replacing widely used canonical space, we instantiate this insight with a view-centric formulation of the scene space, yielding a fully feed-forward, generalizable scene generator that learns spatial relations directly from the instance model. Quantitative and qualitative results show that a 3D instance generator is an implicit spatial learner and reasoner, pointing toward foundation models for interactive 3D scene understanding and generation.

This design enables precise preference-aligned updates while preserving overall model capabilities. In addition, existing personalization benchmarks frequently rely on persona-based dialogs between LLMs rather than user-LLM interactions, or focus primarily on stylistic imitation while neglecting information-seeking tasks that require accurate recall of user-specific preferences. We introduce User Preference Question Answering (UPQA), a short-answer QA dataset constructed from in-situ user queries with varying levels of difficulty.

Although educational resources are burgeoning, educators face challenges selecting materials that both align with intended learning outcomes and address diverse learner needs. Large Language Models (LLMs) are attracting growing interest for their potential to create learning resources that better support personalization, but verifying coverage of intended outcomes still requires human alignment review, which is costly and limits scalability. We propose a framework that supports the cost-effective automation of evaluating alignment between educational resources and intended learning outcomes. Using human-generated materials, we benchmarked LLM-based text-embedding models and found that the most accurate model (Voyage) achieved 79% accuracy in detecting alignment. We then applied the optimal model to LLM-generated resources and, via expert evaluation, confirmed that it reliably assessed correspondence to intended outcomes (83% accuracy). Finally, in a three-group experiment with 360 learners, higher alignment scores were positively related to greater learning performance, chi-squared(2, N = 360) = 15.39, p < 0.001. These findings show that embedding-based alignment scores can facilitate scalable personalization by confirming alignment with learning outcomes, which allows teachers to focus on tailoring content to diverse learner needs.",

This study evaluates four abliteration tools (Heretic, DECCP, ErisForge, FailSpy) across sixteen instruction-tuned models (7B-14B parameters), reporting tool compatibility on all 16 models and quantitative metrics on subsets dictated by tool support. Single-pass methods demonstrated superior capability preservation on the benchmarked subset (avg GSM8K change across three models: ErisForge -0.28 pp; DECCP -0.13 pp), while Bayesian-optimized abliteration produced variable distribution shift (KL divergence: 0.043-1.646) with model-dependent capability impact. These findings provide researchers with evidence-based selection criteria for abliteration tool deployment across diverse model architectures.

Online Reinforcement Learning offers a promising pathway to address these issues through trial-and-error learning. However, applying online reinforcement learning to VLA models in autonomous driving is hindered by inefficient exploration in continuous action spaces. To overcome this limitation, we propose MindDrive, a VLA framework comprising a large language model (LLM) with two distinct sets of LoRA parameters. The one LLM serves as a Decision Expert for scenario reasoning and driving decision-making, while the other acts as an Action Expert that dynamically maps linguistic decisions into feasible trajectories. By feeding trajectory-level rewards back into the reasoning space, MindDrive enables trial-and-error learning over a finite set of discrete linguistic driving decisions, instead of operating directly in a continuous action space. This approach effectively balances optimal decision-making in complex scenarios, human-like driving behavior, and efficient exploration in online reinforcement learning. MindDrive achieves strong closed-loop performance on the challenging Bench2Drive benchmark, with a Driving Score (DS) of 78.04 and a Success Rate (SR) of 55.09%. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to demonstrate the effectiveness of online reinforcement learning for the VLA model in autonomous driving.",

However, acquiring ST data remains prohibitively expensive, and traditional fixed-grid sampling strategies lead to redundant measurements of morphologically similar or biologically uninformative regions, thus resulting in scarce data that constrain current methods. The well-established single-cell sequencing field, however, could provide rich biological data as an effective auxiliary source to mitigate this limitation. To bridge these gaps, we introduce SCR2-ST, a unified framework that leverages single-cell prior knowledge to guide efficient data acquisition and accurate expression prediction. SCR2-ST integrates a single-cell guided reinforcement learning-based (SCRL) active sampling and a hybrid regression-retrieval prediction network SCR2Net. SCRL combines single-cell foundation model embeddings with spatial density information to construct biologically grounded reward signals, enabling selective acquisition of informative tissue regions under constrained sequencing budgets. SCR2Net then leverages the actively sampled data through a hybrid architecture combining regression-based modeling with retrieval-augmented inference, where a majority cell-type filtering mechanism suppresses noisy matches and retrieved expression profiles serve as soft labels for auxiliary supervision. We evaluated SCR2-ST on three public ST datasets, demonstrating SOTA performance in both sampling efficiency and prediction accuracy, particularly under low-budget scenarios.

We compared two statistical frameworks tailored to such endpoints: the joint frailty model (JFM) and the last-event assisted recurrent-event win ratio (LWR). The JFM specifies proportional hazards for the recurrent and terminal events linked through a shared frailty, yielding covariate-adjusted, component-specific hazard ratios that account for informative recurrences and dependence with death. The LWR is a nonparametric, prioritized pairwise comparison that incorporates all observed events over follow-up and summarizes a population-level benefit of treatment while respecting a pre-specified hierarchy between death and recurrences. We first assessed the performance of the methods using simulations that varied both the gamma-frailty variance and the event rates. Next, we investigated these two frameworks using practical clinical applications, to assess the performance of the methods and to estimate the sample size required to achieve adequate power. These two approaches delivered complementary insights. The JFM provided component-specific estimates, while the LWR led to a summary measure of treatment effect with direction. Power was systematically improved with JFM, which thus appeared as the most reliable approach for inference and sample size estimation. Methodological extensions of the LWR to appropriately handle censoring and to formalize causal estimands remain a promising direction for future research.",

A world model should possess three essential properties: controllability, long-term visual quality, and temporal consistency. To this end, we take a progressive approach-first enhancing controllability and then extending toward long-term, high-quality generation. We present LongVie 2, an end-to-end autoregressive framework trained in three stages: (1) Multi-modal guidance, which integrates dense and sparse control signals to provide implicit world-level supervision and improve controllability; (2) Degradation-aware training on the input frame, bridging the gap between training and long-term inference to maintain high visual quality; and (3) History-context guidance, which aligns contextual information across adjacent clips to ensure temporal consistency. We further introduce LongVGenBench, a comprehensive benchmark comprising 100 high-resolution one-minute videos covering diverse real-world and synthetic environments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LongVie 2 achieves state-of-the-art performance in long-range controllability, temporal coherence, and visual fidelity, and supports continuous video generation lasting up to five minutes, marking a significant step toward unified video world modeling.",

For the dark sector, we consider fermionic dark matter (FDM) interacting via a dark vector meson, and two bosonic dark matter models (BDM1 and BDM2) characterized by self-interacting scalar fields. Bayesian inference is employed to constrain the model parameters, including the dark matter mass, coupling strength, and dark matter fraction within NSs. Our analysis finds that all models yield consistent nuclear matter parameters, allowing a small dark matter fraction under 10%. The presence of dark matter slightly softens the EoS, leading to a modest reduction in NS mass, radius, and tidal deformability, though all models remain compatible with NICER and GW170817 observations. The log-evidence and likelihood analyses reveal no statistical preference among the FDM and BDM models, indicating that current astrophysical data cannot decisively distinguish between fermionic and bosonic dark matter scenarios.

MixtureVitae follows a permissive-first, risk-mitigated sourcing strategy that combines public-domain and permissively licensed text (e.g., CC-BY/Apache) with carefully justified low-risk additions (e.g., government works and EU TDM-eligible sources). MixtureVitae adopts a simple, single-stage pretraining recipe that integrates a large proportion of permissive synthetic instruction and reasoning data-signals typically introduced during post-training and generally scarce in permissive web corpora. We categorize all sources into a three-tier scheme that reflects varying risk levels and provide shard-level provenance metadata to enable risk-aware usage. In controlled experiments using the open-sci-ref training protocol (fixed architectures and hyperparameters; 50B and 300B token budgets across 130M-1.7B parameters), models trained on MixtureVitae consistently outperform other permissive datasets across a suite of standard benchmarks, and at the 1.7B-parameters/300B-tokens setting, they surpass FineWeb-Edu and approach DCLM late in training. Performance is particularly strong on MMLU and on math and code benchmarks: a 1.7B model pretrained on 300B MixtureVitae tokens matches or exceeds a strong 1.7B instruction-tuned baseline on GSM8K, HumanEval, and MBPP, despite using over 36 times fewer tokens (300B vs. ~11T). Supported by a thorough decontamination analysis, these results show that permissive-first data with high instruction and reasoning density, tiered by licensing and provenance-related risk, can provide a practical and risk-mitigated foundation for training capable LLMs, reducing reliance on broad web scrapes without sacrificing competitiveness.

Existing works that fall under the umbrella of agent memory often differ substantially in their motivations, implementations, and evaluation protocols, while the proliferation of loosely defined memory terminologies has further obscured conceptual clarity. Traditional taxonomies such as long/short-term memory have proven insufficient to capture the diversity of contemporary agent memory systems. This work aims to provide an up-to-date landscape of current agent memory research. We begin by clearly delineating the scope of agent memory and distinguishing it from related concepts such as LLM memory, retrieval augmented generation (RAG), and context engineering. We then examine agent memory through the unified lenses of forms, functions, and dynamics. From the perspective of forms, we identify three dominant realizations of agent memory, namely token-level, parametric, and latent memory. From the perspective of functions, we propose a finer-grained taxonomy that distinguishes factual, experiential, and working memory. From the perspective of dynamics, we analyze how memory is formed, evolved, and retrieved over time. To support practical development, we compile a comprehensive summary of memory benchmarks and open-source frameworks. Beyond consolidation, we articulate a forward-looking perspective on emerging research frontiers, including memory automation, reinforcement learning integration, multimodal memory, multi-agent memory, and trustworthiness issues. We hope this survey serves not only as a reference for existing work, but also as a conceptual foundation for rethinking memory as a first-class primitive in the design of future agentic intelligence.",

LLMs are pre-trained on vast text data to learn general language patterns, but a subsequent post-training phase is critical to align them for specific real-world tasks. Reinforcement learning (RL) is the leading post-training technique, yet its economic impact remains largely underexplored and unquantified. We examine this question through the lens of the first deployment of an RL-trained LLM for generative advertising on Facebook. Integrated into Meta's Text Generation feature, our model, \"AdLlama,\" powers an AI tool that helps advertisers create new variations of human-written ad text. To train this model, we introduce reinforcement learning with performance feedback (RLPF), a post-training method that uses historical ad performance data as a reward signal. In a large-scale 10-week A/B test on Facebook spanning nearly 35,000 advertisers and 640,000 ad variations, we find that AdLlama improves click-through rates by 6.7% (p=0.0296) compared to a supervised imitation model trained on curated ads. This represents a substantial improvement in advertiser return on investment on Facebook. We also find that advertisers who used AdLlama generated more ad variations, indicating higher satisfaction with the model's outputs. To our knowledge, this is the largest study to date on the use of generative AI in an ecologically valid setting, offering an important data point quantifying the tangible impact of RL post-training. Furthermore, the results show that RLPF is a promising and generalizable approach for metric-driven post-training that bridges the gap between highly capable language models and tangible outcomes.",

We identify distinct time-varying structures in the near-infrared that we interpret as planetary-scale wave (e.g., Rossby or Kelvin)-associated cloud modulation. We detect deviations from bulk (composite) variability in water (S/N = 14.0), carbon monoxide (S/N = 13.0), and methane (S/N = 14.9) molecular signatures. Forsterite cloud modulation is anti-correlated with overlying carbon monoxide and water abundances and correlated with deep methane absorption, suggesting complex interaction between cloud formation, atmospheric chemistry, and temperature structure. Furthermore, we identify distinct harmonic behavior between methane and carbon monoxide absorption bands, providing evidence for time-resolved disequilibrium carbon chemistry. At the lowest pressures (< 100 mbar), we find mapped methane lines transition from absorption to emission, supporting evidence of high-altitude auroral heating via electron precipitation.",

We confront this model with Planck 2018 temperature, polarisation, and lensing data, SPT-3G high-$\\ell$ measurements, DESI DR2 BAO, and Pantheon$+$ supernovae, assuming that the axion makes up all of the dark matter and that the dilaton plays the role of a dark energy field.

The model fits this enlarged data set as well as the $w_0w_a$ model with an electron mass modified by hand at recombination, though it does so with calculable dynamics. Axio-dilaton self-interactions robustly fake a phantom equation of state in DESI measurements. There is a sting: cosmology prefers dilaton-matter couplings $|\\mathbf{g}|\\sim 10^{-2}$-$10^{-1}$, which are large enough to have been detected in solar-system tests of General Relativity. These results show how axio-dilatons can provide a viable cosmology preferred by current data at surprisingly large couplings, within a framework that links dark energy, dark matter, and time-dependent particle masses in a coherent way.

While existing agents struggle to produce accurate law formulas, this paper introduces SLDAgent, an evolution-based agent that co-optimize the scaling law model and the parameters, enabling it to autonomously explore complex relationships between variables. For the first time, we demonstrates that SLDAgent can automatically discover laws that exhibit consistently more accurate extrapolation than their established, human-derived counterparts across all tasks. Through comprehensive analysis, we elucidate why these discovered laws are superior and verify their practical utility in both pretraining and finetuning applications.

Such agents could intentionally sabotage these codebases if they were misaligned. We investigate asynchronous monitoring, in which a monitoring system reviews agent actions after the fact. Unlike synchronous monitoring, this approach does not impose runtime latency, while still attempting to disrupt attacks before irreversible harm occurs. We treat monitor development as an adversarial game between a blue team (who design monitors) and a red team (who create sabotaging agents). We attempt to set the game rules such that they upper bound the sabotage potential of an agent based on Claude 4.1 Opus. To ground this game in a realistic, high-stakes deployment scenario, we develop a suite of 5 diverse software engineering environments that simulate tasks that an agent might perform within an AI developer's internal infrastructure. Over the course of the game, we develop an ensemble monitor that achieves a 6% false negative rate at 1% false positive rate on a held out test environment. Then, we estimate risk of sabotage at deployment time by extrapolating from our monitor's false negative rate. We describe one simple model for this extrapolation, present a sensitivity analysis, and describe situations in which the model would be invalid.

In this paper, we propose Janus, a scalable MoE inference system that disaggregates attention and experts on separate GPU sub-clusters, enabling each module to be managed and scaled independently.

First, it proposes an adaptive two-phase communication scheme that exploits intra- and inter-node bandwidth hierarchies for low-latency data exchange. Second, motivated by the memory-bound nature of MoE modules, Janus introduces a lightweight scheduler and implements it as a GPU kernel to balance the number of activated experts across GPUs at minimal overhead, thereby reducing inference latency. Third, Janus performs fine-grained resource management to dynamically adjust expert placement and independently scale attention and MoE resources to improve overall efficiency. Evaluation shows Janus achieves up to 3.9 higher perGPU throughput than state-of-the-art systems while meeting per-token latency requirements.",

Traditional deep learning methods have been widely applied to this task but often lack generalisability when confronted with newly emerging spoofing techniques and more tasks such as spoof attribution recognition rather than simple binary classification. In principle, Large Language Models (LLMs) are considered to possess the needed generalisation capabilities. However, previous research on Audio LLMs (ALLMs) indicates a generalization bottleneck in audio deepfake detection performance, even when sufficient data is available. Consequently, this study investigates the model architecture and examines the effects of the primary components of ALLMs, namely the audio encoder and the text-based LLM. Our experiments demonstrate that the careful selection and combination of audio encoders and text-based LLMs are crucial for unlocking the deepfake detection potential of ALLMs. We further propose an ALLM structure capable of generalizing deepfake detection abilities to out-of-domain spoofing tests and other deepfake tasks, such as spoof positioning and spoof attribution recognition. Our proposed model architecture achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across multiple datasets, including ASVSpoof2019, InTheWild, and Demopage, with accuracy reaching up to 95.76% on average, and exhibits competitive capabilities in other deepfake detection tasks such as attribution, and localisation compared to SOTA audio understanding models.

Their restoration, including denoising, deblurring, and sometimes super-resolution, is required before their exploitation. Moreover, quantifying the uncertainties related to this restoration helps to reduce the risks of misinterpreting the image content. Deep learning methods are now state-of-the-art for satellite image restoration. Among them, direct inversion methods train a specific network for each sensor, and generally provide a point estimation of the restored image without the associated uncertainties. Alternatively, deep regularization (DR) methods learn a deep prior on target images before plugging it, as the regularization term, into a model-based optimization scheme. This allows for restoring images from several sensors with a single network and possibly for estimating associated uncertainties. In this paper, we introduce VBLE-xz, a DR method that solves the inverse problem in the latent space of a variational compressive autoencoder (CAE). We adapt the regularization strength by modulating the bitrate of the trained CAE with a training-free approach. Then, VBLE-xz estimates relevant uncertainties jointly in the latent and in the image spaces by sampling an explicit posterior estimated within variational inference. This enables fast posterior sampling, unlike state-of-the-art DR methods that use Markov chains or diffusion-based approaches. We conduct a comprehensive set of experiments on very high-resolution simulated and real Pléiades images, asserting the performance, robustness and scalability of the proposed method. They demonstrate that VBLE-xz represents a compelling alternative to direct inversion methods when uncertainty quantification is required.

The proposed method for migration essentially appears as a framework that leverages the best aspects of traditional software engineering techniques and provides an iterative, scalable, precise and efficient solution for modern database transformations. The central piece of the approach is the integration of a fine-tuned Large Language Model to address critical issues in SQL code conversion, such as syntax mapping, resolving discrepancies between Oracle PL/SQL and PostgreSQL, and optimising database elements such as stored procedures, triggers, views, and overall database logic. Thus, the method involves a trade-off between fine-tuning and prompt engineering. Special attention is given to a fine-tuning approach, which enhances the adaptability and compatibility with migration requirements across the entire database. According to the achieved results, fine-tuning plays a very important role. The study employs targeted evaluation methodologies along with computational metrics to measure the success of iterative conversion cycles. Core innovations include automated SQL feature detection, semi-supervised error analysis and integration of Subject Matter Experts feedback within a systematic migration workflow. The methodology achieves significant reductions in Syntax Error Rates, enhances feature alignment throughout migration iterations, and leverages dataset sampling to ensure continual improvement. By embedding GAI into the migration process, the framework facilitates precise feature mapping, semi-automated error resolution, and data-driven optimisation loops, improving workflow efficiency.",

For evaluating time-awareness in retrieval, we propose a new benchmark with temporally opposite (chiral) actions as hard negatives and curated splits for chiral and non-chiral actions. We show that TARA outperforms all existing video-text models on this chiral benchmark while also achieving strong results on standard benchmarks. Furthermore, we discover additional benefits of TARA beyond time-awareness: (i) TARA embeddings are negation-aware as shown in NegBench benchmark that evaluates negation in video retrieval, (ii) TARA achieves state of the art performance on verb and adverb understanding in videos. Overall, TARA yields a strong, versatile, time-aware video-text embedding model with state of the art zero-shot performance.",

Autoregressive Language Models (ARMs), which generate tokens sequentially conditioned on all previous tokens, have been the predominant paradigm for LLMs. While these models have achieved high accuracy across a range of downstream tasks, they exhibit low arithmetic intensity due to the inherent sequential dependency in next-token prediction. Recently, Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative architecture. DLMs generate output tokens in parallel, mitigating the limitations of sequential decoding. However, the performance implications of DLMs relative to commonly deployed ARMs are not fully understood. In this work, we present a comprehensive study of the performance characteristics of ARMs and DLMs, combining theoretical analysis with empirical profiling to characterize the trade-offs between these approaches. We show that although DLMs can achieve higher arithmetic intensity than ARMs by leveraging parallelism across token positions, they fail to scale effectively with longer contexts. We then explore block-wise decoding for DLMs, which decouples arithmetic intensity from sequence length and enables better scaling to long contexts (similar to ARMs). We also examine batched inference and find that ARMs exhibit superior throughput as they benefit more from parallelism across sequences in the batch. Finally, we highlight opportunities for accelerating DLM inference, emphasizing that reducing the number of sampling steps is key for open-source DLMs to achieve lower latency relative to ARMs.",

However, the complexity and cost of multiplex data acquisition have hindered its widespread adoption. Additionally, most existing large repositories of H&E images lack corresponding multiplex images, limiting opportunities for multimodal analysis. To address these challenges, we leverage recent advances in latent diffusion models (LDMs), which excel at modeling complex data distributions by utilizing their powerful priors for fine-tuning to a target domain. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for virtual multiplex staining that utilizes pretrained LDM parameters to generate multiplex images from H&E images using a conditional diffusion model. Our approach enables marker-by-marker generation by conditioning the diffusion model on each marker, while sharing the same architecture across all markers. To tackle the challenge of varying pixel value distributions across different marker stains and to improve inference speed, we fine-tune the model for single-step sampling, enhancing both color contrast fidelity and inference efficiency through pixel-level loss functions. We validate our framework on two publicly available datasets, notably demonstrating its effectiveness in generating up to 18 different marker types with improved accuracy, a substantial increase over the 2-3 marker types achieved in previous approaches. This validation highlights the potential of our framework, pioneering virtual multiplex staining. Finally, this paper bridges the gap between H&E and multiplex imaging, potentially enabling retrospective studies and large-scale analyses of existing H&E image repositories.",

We construct Soul-1M, containing 1 million finely annotated samples with a precise automated annotation pipeline (covering portrait, upper-body, full-body, and multi-person scenes) to mitigate data scarcity, and we carefully curate Soul-Bench for comprehensive and fair evaluation of audio-/text-guided animation methods. The model is built on the Wan2.2-5B backbone, integrating audio-injection layers and multiple training strategies together with threshold-aware codebook replacement to ensure long-term generation consistency. Meanwhile, step/CFG distillation and a lightweight VAE are used to optimize inference efficiency, achieving an 11.4$\\times$ speedup with negligible quality loss. Extensive experiments show that Soul significantly outperforms current leading open-source and commercial models on video quality, video-text alignment, identity preservation, and lip-synchronization accuracy, demonstrating broad applicability in real-world scenarios such as virtual anchors and film production.

However, their substantial parameter sizes pose significant challenges for deployment on edge devices with limited computational and memory resources. Low-rank compression is a promising approach to address this issue, as it reduces both computational and memory costs, making LLM more suitable for resource-constrained environments. Nonetheless, naïve low-rank compression methods require a significant reduction in the retained rank to achieve meaningful memory and computation savings. For a low-rank model, the ranks need to be reduced by more than half to yield efficiency gains. Such aggressive truncation, however, typically results in substantial performance degradation. To address this trade-off, we propose SkipCat, a novel low-rank compression framework that enables the use of higher ranks while achieving the same compression rates. First, we introduce an intra-layer shared low-rank projection method, where multiple matrices that share the same input use a common projection. This reduces redundancy and improves compression efficiency. Second, we propose a block skipping technique that omits computations and memory transfers for selected sub-blocks within the low-rank decomposition. These two techniques jointly enable our compressed model to retain more effective ranks under the same compression budget. Experimental results show that, without any additional fine-tuning, our method outperforms previous low-rank compression approaches by 7% accuracy improvement on zero-shot tasks under the same compression rate. These results highlight the effectiveness of our rank-maximized compression strategy in preserving model performance under tight resource constraints.",

(2) A workplace setting observing behaviour when recognition is unfair. Our findings reveal consistent evidence of envy-like patterns in certain LLMs, with large variation across models and contexts. For instance, GPT-5-mini and Claude-3.7-Sonnet show a clear tendency to pull down the peer model to equalize outcomes, whereas Mistral-Small-3.2-24B instead focuses on maximizing its own individual gains.

Softmax-driven competition and greedy decoding cause models to discard valid interpretations before sufficient context is available, resulting in brittle reasoning and context failures. We introduce Non-Resolution Reasoning (NRR), a general computational framework that preserves semantic ambiguity during inference and performs resolution only when explicitly required. NRR integrates three components: (1) Multi-Vector Embeddings that maintain multiple viable interpretations per token, (2) Non-Collapsing Attention that prevents winner-take-all dynamics across layers, and (3) Contextual Identity Tracking (CIT), which assigns context-specific identities to recurring entities (e.g., distinguishing \"Dr. Smith the cardiologist\" from \"Dr. Smith the researcher\"). These mechanisms are unified by an external Resolution Operator $ρ$ that makes semantic commitment explicit, controllable, and task-dependent. Unlike standard architectures, NRR separates representation from resolution, allowing a single model to shift between creative, factual, and ambiguity-preserving reasoning without retraining. A synthetic evaluation demonstrates NRR's ability to preserve ambiguity and track context: CIT-enhanced models achieve 90.9% accuracy on out-of-distribution identity-shift tasks, compared to 9.1% for transformer baselines. NRR provides a principled alternative to premature collapse, reframing ambiguity as an explicit representational state rather than a failure mode. The question is not whether AI should resolve ambiguity, but when, how, and under whose control.",

The study demonstrates that multilingual pre-training provides synergistic benefits, particularly between syntactically similar PLs. Further, the pre-training strategy of the parallel pairing (concatenating code snippets with their translations) significantly enhances cross-lingual abilities with favorable scaling properties. Finally, a proportion-dependent multilingual scaling law is proposed to optimally allocate training tokens by prioritizing high-utility PLs (e.g., Python), balancing high-synergy pairs (e.g., JavaScript-TypeScript), and reducing allocation to fast-saturating languages (Rust), achieving superior average performance across all PLs compared to uniform distribution under the same compute budget.",

To accomplish this, we build upon our previous work on physics-aware recurrent convolutions (PARC). PARC embeds knowledge of underlying physics into its neural network architecture for more robust and accurate prediction of evolving physical fields. PARC was shown to effectively learn complex nonlinear features such as the formation of hotspots and coupled shock fronts in various initiation scenarios of EMs, as a function of microstructures, serving effectively as a microstructure-aware burn model. In this work, we further accelerate PARC and reduce its computational cost by projecting the original dynamics onto a lower-dimensional invariant manifold, or 'latent space.' The projected latent representation encodes the complex geometry of evolving fields (e.g. temperature and pressure) in a set of data-driven features. The reduced dimension of this latent space allows us to learn the dynamics during the initiation of EM with a lighter and more efficient model. We observe a significant decrease in training and inference time while maintaining results comparable to PARC at inference. This work takes steps towards enabling rapid prediction of EM thermomechanics at larger scales and characterization of EM structure-property-performance linkages at a full application scale.",

In this study, we identify linear operators that characterize the behavior of fluid systems across a wide parameter range by using flow field datasets at several representative parameter values. We then comprehensively assess the applicability of ROMs constructed through the interpolation of these operators. Specifically, we consider two intrusive operator-based ROMs: one derived from Galerkin projection and the other based on operator inference using dynamic mode decomposition (DMD). The performance of these ROMs is evaluated for flows around circular and elliptical cylinders over a range of Reynolds numbers and aspect ratios. The Galerkin-based ROM successfully predicts only the eigenvalue and eigenmode corresponding to the fundamental frequency of the Kármán vortex shedding, while other frequencies are not captured and show a decaying behavior. In contrast, the DMD-based ROM accurately predicts both the fundamental frequency and its higher harmonics. Furthermore, visualization of the linear operator matrix elements reveals that interpolation fails when the subspace includes bases contaminated by numerical errors. However, by carefully selecting the subspace dimension and reference conditions, it is possible to accurately predict eigenvalues and corresponding modes even under conditions where multiple low-frequency modes exist outside the harmonic structure of the fundamental frequency. These findings underscore the robustness of the DMD-based parametric operator ROM approach.",

                "summary": "Accurate and timely identification of plant leaf diseases is essential for resilient and sustainable agriculture, yet most deep learning approaches rely on large annotated datasets and computationally intensive models that are unsuitable for data-scarce and resource-constrained environments. To address these challenges we present a few-shot learning approach within a lightweight yet efficient framework that combines domain-adapted MobileNetV2 and MobileNetV3 models as feature extractors, along with a feature fusion technique to generate robust feature representation. For the classification task, the fused features are passed through a Bi-LSTM classifier enhanced with attention mechanisms to capture sequential dependencies and focus on the most relevant features, thereby achieving optimal classification performance even in complex, real-world environments with noisy or cluttered backgrounds. The proposed framework was evaluated across multiple experimental setups, including both laboratory-controlled and field-captured datasets. On tomato leaf diseases from the PlantVillage dataset, it consistently improved performance across 1 to 15 shot scenarios, reaching 98.23+-0.33% at 15 shot, closely approaching the 99.98% SOTA benchmark achieved by a Transductive LSTM with attention, while remaining lightweight and mobile-friendly. Under real-world conditions using field images from the Dhan Shomadhan dataset, it maintained robust performance, reaching 69.28+-1.49% at 15-shot and demonstrating strong resilience to complex backgrounds.

                    "value": "Accurate and timely identification of plant leaf diseases is essential for resilient and sustainable agriculture, yet most deep learning approaches rely on large annotated datasets and computationally intensive models that are unsuitable for data-scarce and resource-constrained environments. To address these challenges we present a few-shot learning approach within a lightweight yet efficient framework that combines domain-adapted MobileNetV2 and MobileNetV3 models as feature extractors, along with a feature fusion technique to generate robust feature representation. For the classification task, the fused features are passed through a Bi-LSTM classifier enhanced with attention mechanisms to capture sequential dependencies and focus on the most relevant features, thereby achieving optimal classification performance even in complex, real-world environments with noisy or cluttered backgrounds. The proposed framework was evaluated across multiple experimental setups, including both laboratory-controlled and field-captured datasets. On tomato leaf diseases from the PlantVillage dataset, it consistently improved performance across 1 to 15 shot scenarios, reaching 98.23+-0.33% at 15 shot, closely approaching the 99.98% SOTA benchmark achieved by a Transductive LSTM with attention, while remaining lightweight and mobile-friendly. Under real-world conditions using field images from the Dhan Shomadhan dataset, it maintained robust performance, reaching 69.28+-1.49% at 15-shot and demonstrating strong resilience to complex backgrounds. Notably, it also outperformed the previous SOTA accuracy of 96.0% on six diseases from PlantVillage, achieving 99.72% with only 15-shot learning. With a compact model size of approximately 40 MB and inference complexity of approximately 1.12 GFLOPs, this work establishes a scalable, mobile-ready foundation for precise plant disease diagnostics in data-scarce regions."

On occasions, the augmented spin-down decays gradually in an exponential manner, particularly after the largest glitch events. The young pulsar PSR J0537-6910 exhibits the highest known glitching rate, with 60 events detected in nearly 18 years of monitoring. Despite most PSR J0537-6910 glitches being large, only one exponential recovery has been reported, following its first discovered glitch.

We aim to determine whether this reflects an intrinsic difference in PSR J0537-6910 or a detectability issue, for example due to its high glitch frequency. The full dataset, including recent NICER observations, was systematically searched for exponential relaxations. Each glitch was tested for evidence of a recovery over a broad range of trial timescales. Promising candidates were investigated further by comparing recovery models with and without an exponential term using Bayesian evidence. We discovered six new glitches, bringing the total to 66. Our criteria strongly indicates the presence of 11 previously undetected exponential recoveries. We presente updated glitch and timing solutions. Exponential recoveries are detected only for the largest glitches, though not all of them. The inferred timescales range from 4 to 37 d, with the decaying frequency increment generally below $1\\%$ of the total. We find that $\\ddotν$ can remain stable across several glitches, with persistent changes associated with only some events. In particular, it tends to be lowest after glitches with exponential recoveries, yielding inter-glitch braking indices between 6 and 9.

This paper presents a comprehensive benchmarking study of multiple reasoning-focused LLMs, with a special emphasis on the newly introduced DeepSeek models, across a suite of fifteen Arabic NLP tasks. We experiment with various strategies, including zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning. This allows us to systematically evaluate performance on datasets covering a range of applications to examine their capacity for linguistic reasoning under different levels of complexity. Our experiments reveal several key findings. First, carefully selecting just three in-context examples delivers an average uplift of over 13 F1 points on classification tasks-boosting sentiment analysis from 35.3% to 87.5% and paraphrase detection from 56.1% to 87.0%. Second, reasoning-focused DeepSeek architectures outperform a strong GPT o4-mini baseline by an average of 12 F1 points on complex inference tasks in the zero-shot setting. Third, LoRA-based fine-tuning yields up to an additional 8 points in F1 and BLEU compared to equivalent increases in model scale.

Prior-driven deblending techniques require extensive fine-tuning and struggle to process large fields. This work aims to develop a fast, reliable deep-learning based deconvolution and denoising super-resolution (SR) technique. We employ a transformer neural network to improve the resolution of Herschel/SPIRE 500 $μ$m observations by a factor 4.5, using Spitzer/MIPS 24$μ$m and Herschel/SPIRE 250, 350, 500$μ$m images. Trained on SIDES and SHARK simulations, we injected instrumental noise into the input simulated images, while keeping the target images noise-free to enhance de-noising capabilities of our method.\n  We evaluated the performance on simulated test sets and real JCMT/SCUBA-2 450 $μ$m observations in the COSMOS field which have superior resolution compared to Herschel. Our SR method achieves an inference time of $1s/deg^2$ on consumer GPUs, much faster than traditional deblending techniques. Using the simulation test sets, we show that fluxes of the extracted sources from the super-resolved image are accurate to within 5% for sources with an intrinsic flux $\\gtrsim$ 8 mJy, which is a substantial improvement compared to blind extraction on the native images. Astrometric error is low ($\\lesssim$ 1\" vs 12\" pixel scale). Reliability is $\\gtrsim$ 90% for sources $>$3 mJy and $>$90% of sources with intrinsic fluxes $\\gtrsim5$ mJy are recovered. Applied to real 500 $μ$m observations, fluxes of the extracted sources from the super-resolved map agree well with SCUBA-2 measured fluxes for sources $\\geq$10 mJy.

                "summary": "The use of lightweight machine learning (ML) models in internet of things (IoT) networks enables resource constrained IoT devices to perform on-device inference for several critical applications. However, the inference accuracy deteriorates due to the non-stationarity in the IoT environment and limited initial training data. To counteract this, the deployed models can be updated occasionally with new observed data samples. However, this approach consumes additional energy, which is undesirable for energy constrained IoT devices. This letter introduces an event-driven communication framework that strategically integrates continual learning (CL) in IoT networks for energy-efficient fault detection. Our framework enables the IoT device and the edge server (ES) to collaboratively update the lightweight ML model by adapting to the wireless link conditions for communication and the available energy budget. Evaluation on real-world datasets show that the proposed approach can outperform both periodic sampling and non-adaptive CL in terms of inference recall; our proposed approach achieves up to a 42.8% improvement, even under tight energy and bandwidth constraint.",

                    "value": "The use of lightweight machine learning (ML) models in internet of things (IoT) networks enables resource constrained IoT devices to perform on-device inference for several critical applications. However, the inference accuracy deteriorates due to the non-stationarity in the IoT environment and limited initial training data. To counteract this, the deployed models can be updated occasionally with new observed data samples. However, this approach consumes additional energy, which is undesirable for energy constrained IoT devices. This letter introduces an event-driven communication framework that strategically integrates continual learning (CL) in IoT networks for energy-efficient fault detection. Our framework enables the IoT device and the edge server (ES) to collaboratively update the lightweight ML model by adapting to the wireless link conditions for communication and the available energy budget. Evaluation on real-world datasets show that the proposed approach can outperform both periodic sampling and non-adaptive CL in terms of inference recall; our proposed approach achieves up to a 42.8% improvement, even under tight energy and bandwidth constraint."

However, prior work exhibits limited efficiency in generating long-duration high-resolution videos, suffering from temporal drifting, quality degradation, and weak prompt following as video length increases. To address these challenges, we propose KlingAvatar 2.0, a spatio-temporal cascade framework that performs upscaling in both spatial resolution and temporal dimension. The framework first generates low-resolution blueprint video keyframes that capture global semantics and motion, and then refines them into high-resolution, temporally coherent sub-clips using a first-last frame strategy, while retaining smooth temporal transitions in long-form videos. To enhance cross-modal instruction fusion and alignment in extended videos, we introduce a Co-Reasoning Director composed of three modality-specific large language model (LLM) experts. These experts reason about modality priorities and infer underlying user intent, converting inputs into detailed storylines through multi-turn dialogue. A Negative Director further refines negative prompts to improve instruction alignment. Building on these components, we extend the framework to support ID-specific multi-character control. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model effectively addresses the challenges of efficient, multimodally aligned long-form high-resolution video generation, delivering enhanced visual clarity, realistic lip-teeth rendering with accurate lip synchronization, strong identity preservation, and coherent multimodal instruction following.",

Warning dialogues are a standard mitigation measure, but the lack of explanatory clarity and static content limits their effectiveness. In this paper, we report on our research to assess the capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate clear, concise, and scalable explanations for phishing warnings. We carried out a large-scale between-subjects user study (N = 750) to compare the influence of warning dialogues supplemented with manually generated explanations against those generated by two LLMs, Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Llama 3.3 70B. We investigated two explanatory styles (feature-based and counterfactual) for their effects on behavioural metrics (click-through rate) and perceptual outcomes (e.g., trust, risk, clarity). The results provide empirical evidence that LLM-generated explanations achieve a level of protection statistically comparable to expert-crafted messages, effectively automating a high-cost task. While Claude 3.5 Sonnet showed a trend towards reducing click-through rates compared to manual baselines, Llama 3.3, despite being perceived as clearer, did not yield the same behavioral benefits. Feature-based explanations were more effective for genuine phishing attempts, whereas counterfactual explanations diminished false-positive rates. Other variables, such as workload, gender, and prior familiarity with warning dialogues, significantly moderated the effectiveness of warnings. These results indicate that LLMs can be used to automatically build explanations for warning users against phishing, and that such solutions are scalable, adaptive, and consistent with human-centred values.",

Through systematic experimentation with GPT-2 fine-tuned on The Psychology of Artificial Superintelligence, we evaluate five locality configurations: two uniform baselines (fully distributed and fully localist) and three progressive polynomial schedules. We investigate whether interpretability constraints can be aligned with natural semantic structure while being applied strategically across network depth. We demonstrate that progressive semantic localization, combining adaptive semantic block partitioning with steep polynomial locality schedules, achieves near-baseline language modeling performance while providing interpretable attention patterns. Multiple independent training runs with different random seeds establish that results are statistically robust and highly reproducible. The approach dramatically outperforms both fixed-window localization and naive uniform locality constraints. Analysis reveals that maintaining flexibility through low-fidelity constraints preserves model capacity while providing interpretability benefits, and that steep schedules concentrating locality in decision-critical final layers while preserving distributed learning in early layers achieve near-baseline attention distribution characteristics. These findings demonstrate that interpretability mechanisms should align with semantic structure to achieve practical performance-interpretability tradeoffs for trustworthy AI systems.",

However, this heterogeneous sequence length distribution poses significant challenges for existing training systems, as they fail to simultaneously achieve high training efficiency for both long and short sequences, resulting in sub-optimal end-to-end system performance in Long-SFT. In this paper, we present a novel perspective on data scheduling to address the challenges posed by the heterogeneous data distributions in Long-SFT.

Through dynamic data scheduling, Skrull balances the computation requirements of long and short sequences, improving overall training efficiency. Furthermore, we formulate the scheduling process as a joint optimization problem and thoroughly analyze the trade-offs involved. Based on those analysis, Skrull employs a lightweight scheduling algorithm to achieve near-zero cost online scheduling in Long-SFT.

By modeling the generation process with a structural causal model and enforcing statistical independence through Gumbel-Softmax-based feature masking and Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) constraints, CausalCLIP isolates stable causal features robust to distribution shifts.

However, most existing methods rely on discrete-time representations and smoothness priors to infer a robot's motion states, which often struggle with ensuring multi-sensor data synchronization. In this article, we present a continuous-time UWB-Inertial-Odometer localization system (CT-UIO), utilizing a non-uniform B-spline framework with fewer anchors. Unlike traditional uniform B-spline-based continuous-time methods, we introduce an adaptive knot-span adjustment strategy for non-uniform continuous-time trajectory representation. This is accomplished by adjusting control points dynamically based on movement speed. To enable efficient fusion of {inertial measurement unit (IMU) and odometer data, we propose an improved extended Kalman filter (EKF) with innovation-based adaptive estimation to provide short-term accurate motion prior. Furthermore, to address the challenge of achieving a fully observable UWB localization system under few-anchor conditions, the virtual anchor (VA) generation method based on multiple hypotheses is proposed. At the backend, we propose an adaptive sliding window strategy for global trajectory estimation. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on three self-collected datasets with different UWB anchor numbers and motion modes. The result shows that the proposed CT-UIO achieves 0.403m, 0.150m, and 0.189m localization accuracy in corridor, exhibition hall, and office environments, yielding 17.2%, 26.1%, and 15.2% improvements compared with competing state-of-the-art UIO systems, respectively.

To address this, this paper proposes a dual-qubit hierarchical fuzzy neural network (DQ-HFNN), encoding feature pairs onto a pair of entangled qubits, which extends the single-feature fuzzy model to a joint fuzzy representation. By introducing quantum entanglement, the dual-qubit circuit can encode non-classical correlations, enabling the model to directly learn relationship patterns between feature pairs. Experiments on benchmarks show that DQ-HFNN demonstrates higher classification accuracy than QA-HFNN, as well as classical deep learning baselines. Furthermore, ablation studies after controlling for circuit depth and parameter counts show that the performance gain mainly stems from the relational modeling capability enabled by entanglement rather than enhanced expressivity. The proposed DQ-HFNN model exhibits high parameter efficiency and fast inference speed. Experiments under noisy conditions suggest that it is robust against noise and has the potential to be implemented on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices.",

                "summary": "Despite recent advances in the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), improving the reasoning ability of Small Language Models (SLMs, e.g., up to 1.5B parameters) remains challenging. A key obstacle lies in the complexity and variability of natural language: essentially equivalent problems often appear in diverse surface forms, often obscured by redundant or distracting details. This imposes a dual burden on SLMs: they must first extract the core problem from complex linguistic input, and then perform reasoning based on that understanding. The resulting vast and noisy problem space hinders optimization, particularly for models with limited capacity. To address this, we propose a new framework that decouples understanding from reasoning by mapping natural language problems into a canonical problem space-a semantically simplified yet expressive domain. This enables SLMs to focus on reasoning over standardized inputs, free from linguistic variability. Within this framework, we introduce DURIT (Decoupled Understanding from Reasoning via Iterative Training), a three-step algorithm that iteratively: (1) mapping natural language problems via reinforcement learning, (2) aligns reasoning trajectories through self-distillation, and (3) trains reasoning policies in the problem space. The mapper and reasoner are co-trained in an alternating loop throughout this process. Experiments show that DURIT substantially improves SLMs' performance on both in-domain and out-of-domain mathematical and logical reasoning tasks. Beyond improving reasoning capabilities, DURIT also improves the robustness of reasoning, validating decoupling understanding from reasoning as an effective strategy for strengthening SLMs.",

A key obstacle lies in the complexity and variability of natural language: essentially equivalent problems often appear in diverse surface forms, often obscured by redundant or distracting details. This imposes a dual burden on SLMs: they must first extract the core problem from complex linguistic input, and then perform reasoning based on that understanding.

We establish large-sample theory, particularly asymptotic normality, for the proposed estimator despite the ill-posedness of the problem.

Existing 2D speech-to-video diffusion models depend heavily on reference guidance, leading to limited motion diversity. At the same time, 3D-aware animation typically relies on inversion through pre-trained tri-plane generators, which often leads to imperfect reconstructions and identity drift. We rethink reference- and geometry-based paradigms in two ways. First, we deviate from strict reference conditioning at pre-training by introducing softer identity constraints. Second, we address 3D awareness implicitly within the 2D video domain by leveraging the inherent multi-view nature of video data. STARCaster adopts a compositional approach progressing from ID-aware motion modeling, to audio-visual synchronization via lip reading-based supervision, and finally to novel view animation through temporal-to-spatial adaptation. To overcome the scarcity of 4D audio-visual data, we propose a decoupled learning approach in which view consistency and temporal coherence are trained independently. A self-forcing training scheme enables the model to learn from longer temporal contexts than those generated at inference, mitigating the overly static animations common in existing autoregressive approaches. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that STARCaster generalizes effectively across tasks and identities, consistently surpassing prior approaches in different benchmarks.",

The key idea behind our method is to employ multiple MLP connectors, each with a different image compression ratio, to downsample the vision tokens based on the semantic complexity of the image. During training, we minimize the KL divergence between the responses conditioned on different MLP connectors. At inference time, we introduce an image router, termed Visual Resolution Router (ViR), that automatically selects the appropriate compression rate for each image patch. Compared with existing dynamic high-resolution strategies, which adjust the number of visual tokens based on image resolutions, our method dynamically adapts the number of visual tokens according to semantic complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can reduce the number of vision tokens by up to 50% while maintaining the model's perception, reasoning, and OCR capabilities. We hope this work will contribute to the development of more efficient MLLMs. The code and models will be released to facilitate future research.",

In particular, there is a lack of observations between chirp masses of 10 and 12 $M_\\odot$. In this article, we report that observations significantly favour the model supporting suppression of the rate in a narrow chirp mass range compared to the model that doesn't include suppression at a confidence greater than 99.5\\%. Using another test, which measures the deviation between the inferred chirp mass distributions from the two models, we conservatively estimate a 95\\% confidence in the presence of a feature. A lack of confidence has been reported in the presence of a gap around a comparable location in the component mass distribution. The differing conclusions are due to a unique correlation between the primary~(heavier of the two masses) and the secondary~(lighter of the two masses) masses of binary black holes.

However, the interest around C. reinhardtii goes beyond its swimming capabilities. In fact, light can drastically alter its behavior: under blue illumination, the cell attaches to a nearby surface and intermittently glides on it. Such a gliding motility is powered by molecular-motor proteins operating on the cell's cilia, and the related machinery has established the cell as a prime reference for the study of intraciliary-transport mechanisms. This is what we focus on in the present work, by combining in-line holographic microscopy -which leads to unprecedented spatial and temporal resolutions on the gliding dynamics -and statistical inference. We show that, while gliding, the cells exhibit anomalous-diffusive features, including Lorentzian-like distributions of displacements, which are reminiscent of enhanced search strategies. The latter may be exploited by the cells to facilitate colony formation, or, more broadly, by organisms possessing an intraciliary-transport machinery for the transport of cargo molecules and signaling. Furthermore, gliding trajectories, by being intermittent, are valid candidates to infer forces at the molecular-motor scale that are necessary for the cells to move, or symetrically, to transport cargo molecules. We report a gliding threshold of about 20 pN, compatible with the activity of single molecular motors.",

However, its core component -- the rejection sampling mechanism -- relies on a fixed, context-independent random threshold. This leads to a significant \"random rejection\" problem in high-uncertainty generation scenarios, where plausible candidate tokens are frequently rejected due to random chance, undermining inference efficiency. This paper introduces Efficient Adaptive Rejection Sampling (EARS), a novel method that dynamically adjusts the acceptance threshold by incorporating the target model's own predictive uncertainty, measured as \\(1 - \\max(P_{\\mathrm{target}})\\). By introducing a tolerance term proportional to this uncertainty, EARS intelligently relaxes the acceptance criterion when the model is uncertain, effectively reducing random rejections while maintaining strict standards when the model is confident. Experiments on creative writing and open-domain QA tasks demonstrate that EARS significantly enhances the efficiency of speculative decoding, achieving up to an 18.12% increase in throughput with a negligible 0.84% accuracy drop on the GSM8K benchmark. The method requires no modifications to model architectures and can be seamlessly integrated into existing speculative decoding frameworks.",

With the growing demand for predictive analytics, the deep integration of machine learning (ML) into RDBMS has become critical. However, a fundamental challenge hinders this evolution: conventional ML models are static and task-specific, whereas RDBMS environments are dynamic and must support diverse analytical queries. Each analytical task entails constructing a bespoke pipeline from scratch, which incurs significant development overhead and hence limits wide adoption of ML in analytics.\n  We present NeurIDA, an autonomous end-to-end system for in-database analytics that dynamically \"tweaks\" the best available base model to better serve a given analytical task. In particular, we propose a novel paradigm of dynamic in-database modeling to pre-train a composable base model architecture over the relational data. Upon receiving a task, NeurIDA formulates the task and data profile to dynamically select and configure relevant components from the pool of base models and shared model components for prediction. For friendly user experience, NeurIDA supports natural language queries; it interprets user intent to construct structured task profiles, and generates analytical reports with dedicated LLM agents. By design, NeurIDA enables ease-of-use and yet effective and efficient in-database AI analytics. Extensive experiment study shows that NeurIDA consistently delivers up to 12% improvement in AUC-ROC and 25% relative reduction in MAE across ten tasks on five real-world datasets.

To address these challenges, this paper presents GAPses, a novel smart glasses platform designed for unobtrusive, comfortable, and secure acquisition and processing of electroencephalography (EEG) and electrooculography (EOG) signals. We introduce a direct electrode-electronics interface with custom dry soft electrodes to enhance comfort for long wear. An integrated parallel ultra-low-power RISC-V processor (GAP9, Greenwaves Technologies) processes data at the edge, thereby eliminating the need for continuous data streaming through a wireless link, enhancing privacy, and increasing system reliability in adverse channel conditions. We demonstrate the broad applicability of the designed prototype through validation in a number of EEG-based interaction tasks, including alpha waves, steady-state visual evoked potential analysis, and motor movement classification. Furthermore, we demonstrate an EEG-based biometric subject recognition task, where we reach a sensitivity and specificity of 98.87% and 99.86% respectively, with only 8 EEG channels and an energy consumption per inference on the edge as low as 121 $μJ$. Moreover, in an EOG-based eye movement classification task, we reach an accuracy of 96.68% on 11 classes, resulting in an information transfer rate of 94.78 bit/min, which can be further increased to 161.43 bit/min by reducing the accuracy to 81.43%. The deployed implementation has an energy consumption of 40 $μJ$ per inference and a total system power of only 12.4 mW, of which only 1.61% is used for classification, allowing for continuous operation of more than 22 h with a small 75 mAh battery.",

                    "value": "Recent advancements in head-mounted wearable technology are revolutionizing the field of biopotential measurement, but the integration of these technologies into practical, user-friendly devices remains challenging due to issues with design intrusiveness, comfort, and data privacy. To address these challenges, this paper presents GAPses, a novel smart glasses platform designed for unobtrusive, comfortable, and secure acquisition and processing of electroencephalography (EEG) and electrooculography (EOG) signals. We introduce a direct electrode-electronics interface with custom dry soft electrodes to enhance comfort for long wear. An integrated parallel ultra-low-power RISC-V processor (GAP9, Greenwaves Technologies) processes data at the edge, thereby eliminating the need for continuous data streaming through a wireless link, enhancing privacy, and increasing system reliability in adverse channel conditions. We demonstrate the broad applicability of the designed prototype through validation in a number of EEG-based interaction tasks, including alpha waves, steady-state visual evoked potential analysis, and motor movement classification. Furthermore, we demonstrate an EEG-based biometric subject recognition task, where we reach a sensitivity and specificity of 98.87% and 99.86% respectively, with only 8 EEG channels and an energy consumption per inference on the edge as low as 121 $μJ$. Moreover, in an EOG-based eye movement classification task, we reach an accuracy of 96.68% on 11 classes, resulting in an information transfer rate of 94.78 bit/min, which can be further increased to 161.43 bit/min by reducing the accuracy to 81.43%. The deployed implementation has an energy consumption of 40 $μJ$ per inference and a total system power of only 12.4 mW, of which only 1.61% is used for classification, allowing for continuous operation of more than 22 h with a small 75 mAh battery."

Ideally, one would perform a fully hierarchical Bayesian inference where the pulse profile and EOS model parameters are jointly fit, but implementing such a framework is complex and computationally demanding. Here, we present an intermediate solution introducing an EOS-informed prior on mass-radius into the existing PPM pipeline using normalizing flows. By focusing on the parameter space consistent with certain EOSs, this approach both tightens constraints on neutron star parameters while reducing computational costs and requiring minimal additional implementation effort. We test this approach on two pulsars, PSR J0740+6620 and PSR J0437-4715, and with two EOS model families: a model based on the speed of sound inside the neutron star interior (CS) and a piecewise-polytropic (PP) model.

For both pulsar datasets, the inferred radius credible intervals are narrower than in the EOS-agnostic case, with CS favoring smaller radii and PP favoring larger radii. For PSR J0437-4715, the EOS-informed priors reveal a new, more extreme geometric mode that is statistically favored but physically questionable. Including the PPM posteriors in the subsequent EOS inference further tightens the mass-radius posteriors through the chiral effective field theory constraints.

Yet current approaches are often computationally expensive, data-intensive, susceptible to catastrophic forgetting, and prone to performance degradation in multi-turn interactions or when handling implicit queries. To address these challenges, we conceptualize personalization as a model editing task and introduce Personalization Editing, a framework that applies localized edits guided by clustered preference representations. This design enables precise preference-aligned updates while preserving overall model capabilities. In addition, existing personalization benchmarks frequently rely on persona-based dialogs between LLMs rather than user-LLM interactions, or focus primarily on stylistic imitation while neglecting information-seeking tasks that require accurate recall of user-specific preferences. We introduce User Preference Question Answering (UPQA), a short-answer QA dataset constructed from in-situ user queries with varying levels of difficulty. Unlike prior benchmarks, UPQA directly evaluates a model's ability to recall and apply specific user preferences. Across experimental settings, Personalization Editing achieves higher editing accuracy and greater computational efficiency than fine-tuning, while outperforming prompting-based baselines in multi-turn conversations and implicit preference questions settings.",

A key challenge, however, is bridging the gap between computational route design and practical laboratory execution, particularly the accurate prediction of viable experimental procedures for each synthesis step. In this work, we present QFANG, a scientific reasoning language model capable of generating precise, structured experimental procedures directly from reaction equations, with explicit chain-of-thought reasoning. To develop QFANG, we curated a high-quality dataset comprising 905,990 chemical reactions paired with structured action sequences, extracted and processed from patent literature using large language models. We introduce a Chemistry-Guided Reasoning (CGR) framework that produces chain-of-thought data grounded in chemical knowledge at scale. The model subsequently undergoes supervised fine-tuning to elicit complex chemistry reasoning. Finally, we apply Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to further enhance procedural accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that QFANG outperforms advanced general-purpose reasoning models and nearest-neighbor retrieval baselines, measured by traditional NLP similarity metrics and a chemically aware evaluator using an LLM-as-a-judge. Moreover, QFANG generalizes to certain out-of-domain reaction classes and adapts to variations in laboratory conditions and user-specific constraints. We believe that QFANG's ability to generate high-quality synthesis procedures represents an important step toward bridging the gap between computational synthesis planning and fully automated laboratory synthesis.",

Although educational resources are burgeoning, educators face challenges selecting materials that both align with intended learning outcomes and address diverse learner needs. Large Language Models (LLMs) are attracting growing interest for their potential to create learning resources that better support personalization, but verifying coverage of intended outcomes still requires human alignment review, which is costly and limits scalability. We propose a framework that supports the cost-effective automation of evaluating alignment between educational resources and intended learning outcomes. Using human-generated materials, we benchmarked LLM-based text-embedding models and found that the most accurate model (Voyage) achieved 79% accuracy in detecting alignment. We then applied the optimal model to LLM-generated resources and, via expert evaluation, confirmed that it reliably assessed correspondence to intended outcomes (83% accuracy). Finally, in a three-group experiment with 360 learners, higher alignment scores were positively related to greater learning performance, chi-squared(2, N = 360) = 15.39, p < 0.001. These findings show that embedding-based alignment scores can facilitate scalable personalization by confirming alignment with learning outcomes, which allows teachers to focus on tailoring content to diverse learner needs.",

This study evaluates four abliteration tools (Heretic, DECCP, ErisForge, FailSpy) across sixteen instruction-tuned models (7B-14B parameters), reporting tool compatibility on all 16 models and quantitative metrics on subsets dictated by tool support. Single-pass methods demonstrated superior capability preservation on the benchmarked subset (avg GSM8K change across three models: ErisForge -0.28 pp; DECCP -0.13 pp), while Bayesian-optimized abliteration produced variable distribution shift (KL divergence: 0.043-1.646) with model-dependent capability impact. These findings provide researchers with evidence-based selection criteria for abliteration tool deployment across diverse model architectures.

Online Reinforcement Learning offers a promising pathway to address these issues through trial-and-error learning.

To overcome this limitation, we propose MindDrive, a VLA framework comprising a large language model (LLM) with two distinct sets of LoRA parameters. The one LLM serves as a Decision Expert for scenario reasoning and driving decision-making, while the other acts as an Action Expert that dynamically maps linguistic decisions into feasible trajectories. By feeding trajectory-level rewards back into the reasoning space, MindDrive enables trial-and-error learning over a finite set of discrete linguistic driving decisions, instead of operating directly in a continuous action space. This approach effectively balances optimal decision-making in complex scenarios, human-like driving behavior, and efficient exploration in online reinforcement learning. MindDrive achieves strong closed-loop performance on the challenging Bench2Drive benchmark, with a Driving Score (DS) of 78.04 and a Success Rate (SR) of 55.09%.

MixtureVitae follows a permissive-first, risk-mitigated sourcing strategy that combines public-domain and permissively licensed text (e.g., CC-BY/Apache) with carefully justified low-risk additions (e.g., government works and EU TDM-eligible sources). MixtureVitae adopts a simple, single-stage pretraining recipe that integrates a large proportion of permissive synthetic instruction and reasoning data-signals typically introduced during post-training and generally scarce in permissive web corpora. We categorize all sources into a three-tier scheme that reflects varying risk levels and provide shard-level provenance metadata to enable risk-aware usage. In controlled experiments using the open-sci-ref training protocol (fixed architectures and hyperparameters; 50B and 300B token budgets across 130M-1.7B parameters), models trained on MixtureVitae consistently outperform other permissive datasets across a suite of standard benchmarks, and at the 1.7B-parameters/300B-tokens setting, they surpass FineWeb-Edu and approach DCLM late in training. Performance is particularly strong on MMLU and on math and code benchmarks: a 1.7B model pretrained on 300B MixtureVitae tokens matches or exceeds a strong 1.7B instruction-tuned baseline on GSM8K, HumanEval, and MBPP, despite using over 36 times fewer tokens (300B vs. ~11T). Supported by a thorough decontamination analysis, these results show that permissive-first data with high instruction and reasoning density, tiered by licensing and provenance-related risk, can provide a practical and risk-mitigated foundation for training capable LLMs, reducing reliance on broad web scrapes without sacrificing competitiveness.

As research on agent memory rapidly expands and attracts unprecedented attention, the field has also become increasingly fragmented. Existing works that fall under the umbrella of agent memory often differ substantially in their motivations, implementations, and evaluation protocols, while the proliferation of loosely defined memory terminologies has further obscured conceptual clarity. Traditional taxonomies such as long/short-term memory have proven insufficient to capture the diversity of contemporary agent memory systems. This work aims to provide an up-to-date landscape of current agent memory research. We begin by clearly delineating the scope of agent memory and distinguishing it from related concepts such as LLM memory, retrieval augmented generation (RAG), and context engineering. We then examine agent memory through the unified lenses of forms, functions, and dynamics. From the perspective of forms, we identify three dominant realizations of agent memory, namely token-level, parametric, and latent memory. From the perspective of functions, we propose a finer-grained taxonomy that distinguishes factual, experiential, and working memory. From the perspective of dynamics, we analyze how memory is formed, evolved, and retrieved over time. To support practical development, we compile a comprehensive summary of memory benchmarks and open-source frameworks. Beyond consolidation, we articulate a forward-looking perspective on emerging research frontiers, including memory automation, reinforcement learning integration, multimodal memory, multi-agent memory, and trustworthiness issues. We hope this survey serves not only as a reference for existing work, but also as a conceptual foundation for rethinking memory as a first-class primitive in the design of future agentic intelligence.",

LLMs are pre-trained on vast text data to learn general language patterns, but a subsequent post-training phase is critical to align them for specific real-world tasks. Reinforcement learning (RL) is the leading post-training technique, yet its economic impact remains largely underexplored and unquantified. We examine this question through the lens of the first deployment of an RL-trained LLM for generative advertising on Facebook. Integrated into Meta's Text Generation feature, our model, \"AdLlama,\" powers an AI tool that helps advertisers create new variations of human-written ad text. To train this model, we introduce reinforcement learning with performance feedback (RLPF), a post-training method that uses historical ad performance data as a reward signal. In a large-scale 10-week A/B test on Facebook spanning nearly 35,000 advertisers and 640,000 ad variations, we find that AdLlama improves click-through rates by 6.7% (p=0.0296) compared to a supervised imitation model trained on curated ads. This represents a substantial improvement in advertiser return on investment on Facebook. We also find that advertisers who used AdLlama generated more ad variations, indicating higher satisfaction with the model's outputs. To our knowledge, this is the largest study to date on the use of generative AI in an ecologically valid setting, offering an important data point quantifying the tangible impact of RL post-training. Furthermore, the results show that RLPF is a promising and generalizable approach for metric-driven post-training that bridges the gap between highly capable language models and tangible outcomes.",

Unlike synchronous monitoring, this approach does not impose runtime latency, while still attempting to disrupt attacks before irreversible harm occurs. We treat monitor development as an adversarial game between a blue team (who design monitors) and a red team (who create sabotaging agents). We attempt to set the game rules such that they upper bound the sabotage potential of an agent based on Claude 4.1 Opus. To ground this game in a realistic, high-stakes deployment scenario, we develop a suite of 5 diverse software engineering environments that simulate tasks that an agent might perform within an AI developer's internal infrastructure. Over the course of the game, we develop an ensemble monitor that achieves a 6% false negative rate at 1% false positive rate on a held out test environment. Then, we estimate risk of sabotage at deployment time by extrapolating from our monitor's false negative rate. We describe one simple model for this extrapolation, present a sensitivity analysis, and describe situations in which the model would be invalid.

Over the course of the game, we develop an ensemble monitor that achieves a 6% false negative rate at 1% false positive rate on a held out test environment. Then, we estimate risk of sabotage at deployment time by extrapolating from our monitor's false negative rate. We describe one simple model for this extrapolation, present a sensitivity analysis, and describe situations in which the model would be invalid.

Traditional deep learning methods have been widely applied to this task but often lack generalisability when confronted with newly emerging spoofing techniques and more tasks such as spoof attribution recognition rather than simple binary classification. In principle, Large Language Models (LLMs) are considered to possess the needed generalisation capabilities. However, previous research on Audio LLMs (ALLMs) indicates a generalization bottleneck in audio deepfake detection performance, even when sufficient data is available. Consequently, this study investigates the model architecture and examines the effects of the primary components of ALLMs, namely the audio encoder and the text-based LLM. Our experiments demonstrate that the careful selection and combination of audio encoders and text-based LLMs are crucial for unlocking the deepfake detection potential of ALLMs. We further propose an ALLM structure capable of generalizing deepfake detection abilities to out-of-domain spoofing tests and other deepfake tasks, such as spoof positioning and spoof attribution recognition. Our proposed model architecture achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across multiple datasets, including ASVSpoof2019, InTheWild, and Demopage, with accuracy reaching up to 95.76% on average, and exhibits competitive capabilities in other deepfake detection tasks such as attribution, and localisation compared to SOTA audio understanding models.

The proposed method for migration essentially appears as a framework that leverages the best aspects of traditional software engineering techniques and provides an iterative, scalable, precise and efficient solution for modern database transformations. The central piece of the approach is the integration of a fine-tuned Large Language Model to address critical issues in SQL code conversion, such as syntax mapping, resolving discrepancies between Oracle PL/SQL and PostgreSQL, and optimising database elements such as stored procedures, triggers, views, and overall database logic. Thus, the method involves a trade-off between fine-tuning and prompt engineering. Special attention is given to a fine-tuning approach, which enhances the adaptability and compatibility with migration requirements across the entire database. According to the achieved results, fine-tuning plays a very important role. The study employs targeted evaluation methodologies along with computational metrics to measure the success of iterative conversion cycles. Core innovations include automated SQL feature detection, semi-supervised error analysis and integration of Subject Matter Experts feedback within a systematic migration workflow. The methodology achieves significant reductions in Syntax Error Rates, enhances feature alignment throughout migration iterations, and leverages dataset sampling to ensure continual improvement. By embedding GAI into the migration process, the framework facilitates precise feature mapping, semi-automated error resolution, and data-driven optimisation loops, improving workflow efficiency.",

For evaluating time-awareness in retrieval, we propose a new benchmark with temporally opposite (chiral) actions as hard negatives and curated splits for chiral and non-chiral actions. We show that TARA outperforms all existing video-text models on this chiral benchmark while also achieving strong results on standard benchmarks.

Overall, TARA yields a strong, versatile, time-aware video-text embedding model with state of the art zero-shot performance.",

However, their substantial parameter sizes pose significant challenges for deployment on edge devices with limited computational and memory resources. Low-rank compression is a promising approach to address this issue, as it reduces both computational and memory costs, making LLM more suitable for resource-constrained environments. Nonetheless, naïve low-rank compression methods require a significant reduction in the retained rank to achieve meaningful memory and computation savings. For a low-rank model, the ranks need to be reduced by more than half to yield efficiency gains. Such aggressive truncation, however, typically results in substantial performance degradation. To address this trade-off, we propose SkipCat, a novel low-rank compression framework that enables the use of higher ranks while achieving the same compression rates. First, we introduce an intra-layer shared low-rank projection method, where multiple matrices that share the same input use a common projection. This reduces redundancy and improves compression efficiency. Second, we propose a block skipping technique that omits computations and memory transfers for selected sub-blocks within the low-rank decomposition. These two techniques jointly enable our compressed model to retain more effective ranks under the same compression budget. Experimental results show that, without any additional fine-tuning, our method outperforms previous low-rank compression approaches by 7% accuracy improvement on zero-shot tasks under the same compression rate. These results highlight the effectiveness of our rank-maximized compression strategy in preserving model performance under tight resource constraints.",

For a low-rank model, the ranks need to be reduced by more than half to yield efficiency gains. Such aggressive truncation, however, typically results in substantial performance degradation. To address this trade-off, we propose SkipCat, a novel low-rank compression framework that enables the use of higher ranks while achieving the same compression rates. First, we introduce an intra-layer shared low-rank projection method, where multiple matrices that share the same input use a common projection. This reduces redundancy and improves compression efficiency. Second, we propose a block skipping technique that omits computations and memory transfers for selected sub-blocks within the low-rank decomposition. These two techniques jointly enable our compressed model to retain more effective ranks under the same compression budget. Experimental results show that, without any additional fine-tuning, our method outperforms previous low-rank compression approaches by 7% accuracy improvement on zero-shot tasks under the same compression rate. These results highlight the effectiveness of our rank-maximized compression strategy in preserving model performance under tight resource constraints."

A promising way to fill this gap in Agentic AI is to equip agents with long-lived digital identities and introduce tamper-proof and flexible identity-bound attestations of agents, provisioned by commonly trusted third parties and designed for cross-domain verifiability. This article presents a conceptual framework and a prototypical multi-agent system, where each agent is endowed with a self-sovereign digital identity.

(2) A workplace setting observing behaviour when recognition is unfair. Our findings reveal consistent evidence of envy-like patterns in certain LLMs, with large variation across models and contexts. For instance, GPT-5-mini and Claude-3.7-Sonnet show a clear tendency to pull down the peer model to equalize outcomes, whereas Mistral-Small-3.2-24B instead focuses on maximizing its own individual gains.

However, different programming languages (PLs) have varying impacts during pre-training that significantly affect base model performance, leading to inaccurate performance prediction. Besides, existing works focus on language-agnostic settings, neglecting the inherently multilingual nature of modern software development. Therefore, it is first necessary to investigate the scaling laws of different PLs, and then consider their mutual influences to arrive at the final multilingual scaling law. In this paper, we present the first systematic exploration of scaling laws for multilingual code pre-training, conducting over 1000+ experiments (Equivalent to 336,000+ H800 hours) across multiple PLs, model sizes (0.2B to 14B parameters), and dataset sizes (1T tokens). We establish comprehensive scaling laws for code LLMs across multiple PLs, revealing that interpreted languages (e.g., Python) benefit more from increased model size and data than compiled languages (e.g., Rust). The study demonstrates that multilingual pre-training provides synergistic benefits, particularly between syntactically similar PLs. Further, the pre-training strategy of the parallel pairing (concatenating code snippets with their translations) significantly enhances cross-lingual abilities with favorable scaling properties. Finally, a proportion-dependent multilingual scaling law is proposed to optimally allocate training tokens by prioritizing high-utility PLs (e.g., Python), balancing high-synergy pairs (e.g., JavaScript-TypeScript), and reducing allocation to fast-saturating languages (Rust), achieving superior average performance across all PLs compared to uniform distribution under the same compute budget.",

The proposed AVSE system employs convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for spectral feature extraction and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks for temporal modeling, enabling robust speech enhancement through multimodal fusion of audio and visual cues. Multiple deployment scenarios are investigated, including cloud-based, edge-assisted, and standalone device implementations. Their performance is evaluated in terms of speech quality improvement, latency, and computational overhead. Real-world experiments are conducted across various network conditions, including Ethernet, Wi-Fi, 4G, and 5G, to analyze the trade-offs between processing delay, communication latency, and perceptual speech quality. The results show that while cloud deployment achieves the highest enhancement quality, edge-assisted architectures offer the best balance between latency and intelligibility, meeting real-time requirements under 5G and Wi-Fi 6 conditions. These findings provide practical guidelines for selecting and optimizing AVSE deployment architectures in diverse applications, including assistive hearing devices, telepresence, and industrial communications.",

Second, the need to process large, complex UI trees as input while generating long, compositional transformation programs, making the search space vast and error-prone. Toward addressing the preceding limitations, we present UIFormer, the first automated optimization framework that synthesizes UI transformation programs by conducting constraint-based optimization with structured decomposition of the complex synthesis task.

Second, UIFormer conducts LLM-based iterative refinement with correctness and efficiency rewards, providing guidance for achieving the efficiency-completeness co-optimization. UIFormer operates as a lightweight plugin that applies transformation programs for seamless integration with existing LLM agents, requiring minimal modifications to their core logic. Evaluations across three UI navigation benchmarks spanning Android and Web platforms with five LLMs demonstrate that UIFormer achieves 48.7% to 55.8% token reduction with minimal runtime overhead while maintaining or improving agent performance.

This paper presents a comprehensive benchmarking study of multiple reasoning-focused LLMs, with a special emphasis on the newly introduced DeepSeek models, across a suite of fifteen Arabic NLP tasks. We experiment with various strategies, including zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning. This allows us to systematically evaluate performance on datasets covering a range of applications to examine their capacity for linguistic reasoning under different levels of complexity. Our experiments reveal several key findings. First, carefully selecting just three in-context examples delivers an average uplift of over 13 F1 points on classification tasks-boosting sentiment analysis from 35.3% to 87.5% and paraphrase detection from 56.1% to 87.0%. Second, reasoning-focused DeepSeek architectures outperform a strong GPT o4-mini baseline by an average of 12 F1 points on complex inference tasks in the zero-shot setting. Third, LoRA-based fine-tuning yields up to an additional 8 points in F1 and BLEU compared to equivalent increases in model scale.

Experiments across multiple LLM MU methods demonstrate that FROC produces stable, interpretable risk landscapes and reveals consistent relationships between unlearning configurations, semantic shift, and utility impact.

Through a systematic evaluation of a leading SLM (Qwen3 4B), we find that while the base model exhibits fundamental limitations in arithmetic tasks, our proposed error-driven method, which clusters erroneous predictions to refine prompt-rules iteratively, dramatically improves performance, elevating the model's accuracy to 70.8\\%.

However, prior work exhibits limited efficiency in generating long-duration high-resolution videos, suffering from temporal drifting, quality degradation, and weak prompt following as video length increases. To address these challenges, we propose KlingAvatar 2.0, a spatio-temporal cascade framework that performs upscaling in both spatial resolution and temporal dimension. The framework first generates low-resolution blueprint video keyframes that capture global semantics and motion, and then refines them into high-resolution, temporally coherent sub-clips using a first-last frame strategy, while retaining smooth temporal transitions in long-form videos. To enhance cross-modal instruction fusion and alignment in extended videos, we introduce a Co-Reasoning Director composed of three modality-specific large language model (LLM) experts. These experts reason about modality priorities and infer underlying user intent, converting inputs into detailed storylines through multi-turn dialogue. A Negative Director further refines negative prompts to improve instruction alignment. Building on these components, we extend the framework to support ID-specific multi-character control. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model effectively addresses the challenges of efficient, multimodally aligned long-form high-resolution video generation, delivering enhanced visual clarity, realistic lip-teeth rendering with accurate lip synchronization, strong identity preservation, and coherent multimodal instruction following.",

Warning dialogues are a standard mitigation measure, but the lack of explanatory clarity and static content limits their effectiveness. In this paper, we report on our research to assess the capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate clear, concise, and scalable explanations for phishing warnings. We carried out a large-scale between-subjects user study (N = 750) to compare the influence of warning dialogues supplemented with manually generated explanations against those generated by two LLMs, Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Llama 3.3 70B. We investigated two explanatory styles (feature-based and counterfactual) for their effects on behavioural metrics (click-through rate) and perceptual outcomes (e.g., trust, risk, clarity). The results provide empirical evidence that LLM-generated explanations achieve a level of protection statistically comparable to expert-crafted messages, effectively automating a high-cost task. While Claude 3.5 Sonnet showed a trend towards reducing click-through rates compared to manual baselines, Llama 3.3, despite being perceived as clearer, did not yield the same behavioral benefits. Feature-based explanations were more effective for genuine phishing attempts, whereas counterfactual explanations diminished false-positive rates. Other variables, such as workload, gender, and prior familiarity with warning dialogues, significantly moderated the effectiveness of warnings.

A common solution is to use multi-task learning (MTL) to train a unified model on post-click data to estimate the conversion rate (CVR) for these diverse targets. In practice, CVR prediction often encounters missing conversion data as many advertisers submit only a subset of user conversion actions due to privacy or other constraints, making the labels of multi-task data incomplete. If the model is trained on all available samples where advertisers submit user conversion actions, it may struggle when deployed to serve a subset of advertisers targeting specific conversion actions, as the training and deployment data distributions are mismatched. While considerable MTL efforts have been made, a long-standing challenge is how to effectively train a unified model with the incomplete and skewed multi-label data. In this paper, we propose a fine-grained Knowledge transfer framework for Asymmetric Multi-Label data (KAML). We introduce an attribution-driven masking strategy (ADM) to better utilize data with asymmetric multi-label data in training. However, the more relaxed masking in ADM is a double-edged sword: it provides additional training signals but also introduces noise due to skewed data. To address this, we propose a hierarchical knowledge extraction mechanism (HKE) to model the sample discrepancy within the target task tower. Finally, to maximize the utility of unlabeled samples, we incorporate ranking loss strategy to further enhance our model.

Through systematic experimentation with GPT-2 fine-tuned on The Psychology of Artificial Superintelligence, we evaluate five locality configurations: two uniform baselines (fully distributed and fully localist) and three progressive polynomial schedules. We investigate whether interpretability constraints can be aligned with natural semantic structure while being applied strategically across network depth. We demonstrate that progressive semantic localization, combining adaptive semantic block partitioning with steep polynomial locality schedules, achieves near-baseline language modeling performance while providing interpretable attention patterns. Multiple independent training runs with different random seeds establish that results are statistically robust and highly reproducible. The approach dramatically outperforms both fixed-window localization and naive uniform locality constraints. Analysis reveals that maintaining flexibility through low-fidelity constraints preserves model capacity while providing interpretability benefits, and that steep schedules concentrating locality in decision-critical final layers while preserving distributed learning in early layers achieve near-baseline attention distribution characteristics.

To smoothly adapt LLMs to long-context scenarios, this process typically entails training on mixed datasets containing both long and short sequences. However, this heterogeneous sequence length distribution poses significant challenges for existing training systems, as they fail to simultaneously achieve high training efficiency for both long and short sequences, resulting in sub-optimal end-to-end system performance in Long-SFT. In this paper, we present a novel perspective on data scheduling to address the challenges posed by the heterogeneous data distributions in Long-SFT. We propose Skrull, a dynamic data scheduler specifically designed for efficient long-SFT. Through dynamic data scheduling, Skrull balances the computation requirements of long and short sequences, improving overall training efficiency. Furthermore, we formulate the scheduling process as a joint optimization problem and thoroughly analyze the trade-offs involved. Based on those analysis, Skrull employs a lightweight scheduling algorithm to achieve near-zero cost online scheduling in Long-SFT. Finally, we implement Skrull upon DeepSpeed, a state-of-the-art distributed training system for LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate that Skrull outperforms DeepSpeed by 3.76x on average (up to 7.54x) in real-world long-SFT scenarios.",

AIR first identifies reasoning-critical attention heads of an off-the-shelf model, then constructs a weakened reference model with disabled head influence, and finally quantifies the resulting loss divergence as the Attention Influence Score. This score enables fine-grained assessment at both the step and sample levels, supporting step-level weighted fine-tuning and global sample selection.

                "summary": "Speculative Decoding is a prominent technique for accelerating the autoregressive inference of large language models (LLMs) by employing a fast draft model to propose candidate token sequences and a large target model to verify them in parallel. However, its core component -- the rejection sampling mechanism -- relies on a fixed, context-independent random threshold. This leads to a significant \"random rejection\" problem in high-uncertainty generation scenarios, where plausible candidate tokens are frequently rejected due to random chance, undermining inference efficiency. This paper introduces Efficient Adaptive Rejection Sampling (EARS), a novel method that dynamically adjusts the acceptance threshold by incorporating the target model's own predictive uncertainty, measured as \\(1 - \\max(P_{\\mathrm{target}})\\). By introducing a tolerance term proportional to this uncertainty, EARS intelligently relaxes the acceptance criterion when the model is uncertain, effectively reducing random rejections while maintaining strict standards when the model is confident. Experiments on creative writing and open-domain QA tasks demonstrate that EARS significantly enhances the efficiency of speculative decoding, achieving up to an 18.12% increase in throughput with a negligible 0.84% accuracy drop on the GSM8K benchmark.

                    "value": "Speculative Decoding is a prominent technique for accelerating the autoregressive inference of large language models (LLMs) by employing a fast draft model to propose candidate token sequences and a large target model to verify them in parallel. However, its core component -- the rejection sampling mechanism -- relies on a fixed, context-independent random threshold. This leads to a significant \"random rejection\" problem in high-uncertainty generation scenarios, where plausible candidate tokens are frequently rejected due to random chance, undermining inference efficiency. This paper introduces Efficient Adaptive Rejection Sampling (EARS), a novel method that dynamically adjusts the acceptance threshold by incorporating the target model's own predictive uncertainty, measured as \\(1 - \\max(P_{\\mathrm{target}})\\). By introducing a tolerance term proportional to this uncertainty, EARS intelligently relaxes the acceptance criterion when the model is uncertain, effectively reducing random rejections while maintaining strict standards when the model is confident. Experiments on creative writing and open-domain QA tasks demonstrate that EARS significantly enhances the efficiency of speculative decoding, achieving up to an 18.12% increase in throughput with a negligible 0.84% accuracy drop on the GSM8K benchmark. The method requires no modifications to model architectures and can be seamlessly integrated into existing speculative decoding frameworks."

Many state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods have achieved communication efficiency and high performance via intermediate fusion. However, they share a critical vulnerability: their performance degrades under adverse communication conditions due to the misalignment induced by data transmission, which severely hampers their practical deployment. To bridge this gap, we re-examine different fusion paradigms, and recover that the strengths of intermediate and late fusion are not a trade-off, but a complementary pairing. Based on this key insight, we propose CoRA, a novel collaborative robust architecture with a hybrid approach to decouple performance from robustness with low communication. It is composed of two components: a feature-level fusion branch and an object-level correction branch. Its first branch selects critical features and fuses them efficiently to ensure both performance and scalability. The second branch leverages semantic relevance to correct spatial displacements, guaranteeing resilience against pose errors. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of CoRA. Under extreme scenarios, CoRA improves upon its baseline performance by approximately 19% in AP@0.7 with more than 5x less communication volume, which makes it a promising solution for robust collaborative perception.",

                "summary": "Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS) manage complex, interrelated data and support a broad spectrum of analytical tasks. With the growing demand for predictive analytics, the deep integration of machine learning (ML) into RDBMS has become critical. However, a fundamental challenge hinders this evolution: conventional ML models are static and task-specific, whereas RDBMS environments are dynamic and must support diverse analytical queries. Each analytical task entails constructing a bespoke pipeline from scratch, which incurs significant development overhead and hence limits wide adoption of ML in analytics.\n  We present NeurIDA, an autonomous end-to-end system for in-database analytics that dynamically \"tweaks\" the best available base model to better serve a given analytical task. In particular, we propose a novel paradigm of dynamic in-database modeling to pre-train a composable base model architecture over the relational data. Upon receiving a task, NeurIDA formulates the task and data profile to dynamically select and configure relevant components from the pool of base models and shared model components for prediction. For friendly user experience, NeurIDA supports natural language queries; it interprets user intent to construct structured task profiles, and generates analytical reports with dedicated LLM agents. By design, NeurIDA enables ease-of-use and yet effective and efficient in-database AI analytics. Extensive experiment study shows that NeurIDA consistently delivers up to 12% improvement in AUC-ROC and 25% relative reduction in MAE across ten tasks on five real-world datasets.

                    "value": "Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS) manage complex, interrelated data and support a broad spectrum of analytical tasks. With the growing demand for predictive analytics, the deep integration of machine learning (ML) into RDBMS has become critical. However, a fundamental challenge hinders this evolution: conventional ML models are static and task-specific, whereas RDBMS environments are dynamic and must support diverse analytical queries. Each analytical task entails constructing a bespoke pipeline from scratch, which incurs significant development overhead and hence limits wide adoption of ML in analytics.\n  We present NeurIDA, an autonomous end-to-end system for in-database analytics that dynamically \"tweaks\" the best available base model to better serve a given analytical task. In particular, we propose a novel paradigm of dynamic in-database modeling to pre-train a composable base model architecture over the relational data. Upon receiving a task, NeurIDA formulates the task and data profile to dynamically select and configure relevant components from the pool of base models and shared model components for prediction. For friendly user experience, NeurIDA supports natural language queries; it interprets user intent to construct structured task profiles, and generates analytical reports with dedicated LLM agents. By design, NeurIDA enables ease-of-use and yet effective and efficient in-database AI analytics. Extensive experiment study shows that NeurIDA consistently delivers up to 12% improvement in AUC-ROC and 25% relative reduction in MAE across ten tasks on five real-world datasets.

This lack of transparency has motivated the recent development of open-source post-training corpora. While training on these open alternatives can yield performance comparable to that of leading models, systematic comparisons remain challenging due to the significant computational cost of conducting them rigorously at scale, and are therefore largely absent. As a result, it remains unclear how specific samples, task types, or curation strategies influence downstream performance when assessing data quality. In this work, we conduct the first comprehensive side-by-side analysis of two prominent open post-training datasets: Tulu-3-SFT-Mix and SmolTalk. Using the Magpie framework, we annotate each sample with detailed quality metrics, including turn structure (single-turn vs. multi-turn), task category, input quality, and response quality, and we derive statistics that reveal structural and qualitative similarities and differences between the two datasets. Based on these insights, we design a principled curation recipe that produces a new data mixture, TuluTalk, which contains 14% fewer samples than either source dataset while matching or exceeding their performance on key benchmarks. Our findings offer actionable insights for constructing more effective post-training datasets that improve model performance within practical resource limits.

Can AI understand what we cannot say? We investigate whether LLMs coherently represent abortion stigma across the cognitive, interpersonal, and structural levels where it operates. We systematically tested 627 demographically diverse personas across five leading LLMs using the validated Individual Level Abortion Stigma Scale (ILAS). Our multilevel analysis examined whether models coherently represent stigma at the cognitive level (self-judgment), interpersonal level (anticipated judgment and isolation), and structural level (community condemnation and disclosure patterns), as well as overall stigma. Models fail tests of genuine understanding across all levels. They overestimate interpersonal stigma while underestimating cognitive stigma, assume uniform community condemnation, introduce demographic biases absent from human validation data, miss the empirically validated stigma-secrecy relationship, and contradict themselves within theoretical constructs. These patterns reveal that current alignment approaches ensure appropriate language but not coherent multilevel understanding. This work provides empirical evidence that current LLMs lack coherent multilevel understanding of psychological and physiological constructs. AI safety in high-stakes contexts demands new approaches to design (multilevel coherence), evaluation (continuous auditing), governance and regulation (mandatory audits, accountability, deployment restrictions), and AI literacy in domains where understanding what people cannot say determines whether support helps or harms.",

Despite substantial research progress, a comprehensive review that systematically traces the development trajectory and provides explicit guidance for future research is still lacking. To bridge this gap, this paper presents a thorough review and analysis of hundreds of publications on intelligent CIR across various types of mechanical equipment from 2002 to 2025, summarizing its technological evolution and offering insights for future development. The early stages are dominated by traditional machine learning approaches that relied on manually engineered features under the guidance of domain expert knowledge. The advent of deep learning has driven the development of end-to-end models capable of automatically extracting features from multi-source signals, thereby significantly improving recognition performance and robustness. Recently, physical informed diagnostic models have been proposed to embed domain knowledge into deep learning models, which can enhance interpretability and cross-condition generalization. In the future, transfer learning, multi-modal fusion, lightweight network architectures, and the deployment of industrial agents are expected to propel CIR technology into a new stage, addressing challenges in multi-source data acquisition, standardized evaluation, and industrial implementation. The paper aims to systematically outline the evolution of CIR technology and highlight the emerging trend of integrating deep learning with physical knowledge.

However, challenges remain in efficiently integrating physics priors, evaluating the effectiveness of physics constraints, balancing model accuracy and physics consistency, and enabling real-world implementation. To address these gaps, this study introduces a Physics-Informed Modularized Neural Network (PI-ModNN), which incorporates physics priors through a physics-informed model structure, loss functions, and hard constraints. A new evaluation metric called \"temperature response violation\" is developed to quantify the physical consistency of data-driven building dynamic models under varying control inputs and training data sizes. Additionally, a physics prior evaluation framework based on rule importance is proposed to assess the contribution of each individual physics prior, offering guidance on selecting appropriate PIML techniques. Results indicate that incorporating physical priors does not always improve model performance; inappropriate priors may decrease model accuracy and consistency. However, hard constraints are effective in enforcing model consistency. Furthermore, we present a general workflow for developing control-oriented PIML models and integrating them with deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Following this framework, a case study implementing DRL in an office space over three months demonstrates potential energy savings of 31.4%. Finally, we provide a general guideline for integrating data-driven models with advanced building control through a four-step evaluation framework, paving the way for reliable and scalable deployment of advanced building controls.",

To alleviate this problem, recent work has explored unsupervised RLVR methods that derive rewards solely from the model's internal consistency, such as through entropy and majority voting. While seemingly promising, these methods often suffer from model collapse in the later stages of training, which may arise from the reinforcement of incorrect reasoning patterns in the absence of external supervision. In this work, we investigate a novel semi-supervised RLVR paradigm that utilizes a small labeled set to guide RLVR training on unlabeled samples. Our key insight is that supervised rewards are essential for stabilizing consistency-based training on unlabeled samples, ensuring that only reasoning patterns verified on labeled instances are incorporated into RL training. Technically, we propose an effective policy optimization algorithm, TraPO, that identifies reliable unlabeled samples by matching their learning trajectory similarity to labeled ones. Building on this, TraPO achieves remarkable data efficiency and strong generalization on six widely used mathematical reasoning benchmarks (AIME24/25, AMC, MATH-500, Minerva, and Olympiad) and three out-of-distribution tasks (ARC-c, GPQA-diamond, and MMLU-pro). With only 1K labeled and 3K unlabeled samples, TraPO reaches 42.6% average accuracy, surpassing the best unsupervised method trained on 45K unlabeled samples (38.3%).

Prior work has primarily explored effective ways for a teacher to instruct the student, where the teacher identifies student gaps and provides guidance. In this work, we shift the focus to the student and investigate effective strategies to actively query the teacher in seeking useful information. Across math and coding benchmarks, where baseline student models begin with near-zero performance, we show that student-led approaches consistently yield absolute Pass@k improvements of at least 0.5 over static baselines. To improve question quality, we train students using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with guidance from either self or stronger students. We find that this guided training enables smaller models to learn how to ask better questions, further enhancing learning efficiency.",

CaMVo adaptively selects a subset of LLMs for each data instance based on contextual embeddings, balancing confidence and cost without requiring pre-training or ground-truth labels. Leveraging a LinUCB-based selection mechanism and a Bayesian estimator over confidence scores, CaMVo estimates a lower bound on labeling accuracy for each LLM and aggregates responses through weighted majority voting. Our empirical evaluation on the MMLU and IMDB Movie Review datasets demonstrates that CaMVo achieves comparable or superior accuracy to full majority voting while significantly reducing labeling costs. This establishes CaMVo as a practical and robust solution for cost-efficient annotation in dynamic labeling environments.",

While existing research mainly targets RAG's performance and efficiency, emerging studies highlight critical security concerns. Yet, current adversarial approaches remain limited, mostly addressing white-box scenarios or heuristic black-box attacks without fully investigating vulnerabilities in the retrieval phase. Additionally, prior works mainly focus on factoid Q&A tasks, their attacks lack complexity and can be easily corrected by advanced LLMs. In this paper, we investigate a more realistic and critical threat scenario: adversarial attacks intended for opinion manipulation against black-box RAG models, particularly on controversial topics. Specifically, we propose FlippedRAG, a transfer-based adversarial attack against black-box RAG systems. We first demonstrate that the underlying retriever of a black-box RAG system can be reverse-engineered, enabling us to train a surrogate retriever. Leveraging the surrogate retriever, we further craft target poisoning triggers, altering vary few documents to effectively manipulate both retrieval and subsequent generation. Extensive empirical results show that FlippedRAG substantially outperforms baseline methods, improving the average attack success rate by 16.7%. FlippedRAG achieves on average a 50% directional shift in the opinion polarity of RAG-generated responses, ultimately causing a notable 20% shift in user cognition. Furthermore, we evaluate the performance of several potential defensive measures, concluding that existing mitigation strategies remain insufficient against such sophisticated manipulation attacks. These results highlight an urgent need for developing innovative defensive solutions to ensure the security and trustworthiness of RAG systems.",

We diagnose this instability and demonstrate that simply scaling the number of rollouts -- a common strategy to improve performance -- only delays, but does not prevent, this collapse. To counteract this instability, we first introduce M-GRPO (Momentum-Anchored Group Relative Policy Optimization), a framework that leverages a slowly evolving momentum model to provide a stable training target. In addition, we identify that this process is often accompanied by a rapid collapse in policy entropy, resulting in a prematurely confident and suboptimal policy. To specifically address this issue, we propose a second contribution: an adaptive filtering method based on the interquartile range (IQR) that dynamically prunes low-entropy trajectories, preserving essential policy diversity. Our extensive experiments on multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that M-GRPO stabilizes the training process while the IQR filter prevents premature convergence. The combination of these two innovations leads to superior training stability and state-of-the-art performance.",

While existing serverless solutions follow exclusive GPU allocation, we take a step back to explore modern platforms and find that: Emerging CPU architectures with built-in accelerators are capable of serving LLMs but remain underutilized, and both CPUs and GPUs can accommodate multiple LLMs simultaneously.\n  We propose SLINFER, a resource-efficient serverless inference scheme tailored for small- to mid-sized LLMs that enables elastic and on-demand sharing across heterogeneous hardware. SLINFER tackles three fundamental challenges: (1) precise, fine-grained compute resource allocation at token-level to handle fluctuating computational demands; (2) a coordinated and forward-looking memory scaling mechanism to detect out-of-memory hazards and reduce operational overhead; and (3) a dual approach that consolidates fragmented instances through proactive preemption and reactive bin-packing. Experimental results on 4 32-core CPUs and 4 A100 GPUs show that SLINFER improves serving capacity by 47% - 62% through sharing, while further leveraging CPUs boosts this to 86% - 154%.",

While existing serverless solutions follow exclusive GPU allocation, we take a step back to explore modern platforms and find that: Emerging CPU architectures with built-in accelerators are capable of serving LLMs but remain underutilized, and both CPUs and GPUs can accommodate multiple LLMs simultaneously.\n  We propose SLINFER, a resource-efficient serverless inference scheme tailored for small- to mid-sized LLMs that enables elastic and on-demand sharing across heterogeneous hardware.

While much progress has been made and techniques originating from different disciplines have been proposed, APR techniques generally suffer from the patch overfitting issue, i.e., the generated patches are not genuinely correct despite they pass the employed tests. To alleviate this issue, many research efforts have been devoted for automated patch correctness assessment (APCA). In particular, with the emergence of large language model (LLM) technology, researchers have employed LLM to assess the patch correctness and have obtained the state-of-the-art performance. The literature on APCA has demonstrated the importance of capturing patch semantic and explicitly considering certain code attributes in predicting patch correctness. However, existing LLM-based methods typically treat code as token sequences and ignore the inherent formal structure for code, making it difficult to capture the deep patch semantics. Moreover, these LLM-based methods also do not explicitly account for enough code attributes. To overcome these drawbacks, we in this paper design a novel patch graph representation named attributed patch semantic graph (APSG), which adequately captures the patch semantic and explicitly reflects important patch attributes. To effectively use graph information in APSG, we accordingly propose a new parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method of LLMs named Graph-LoRA. Extensive evaluations have been conducted to evaluate our method, and the results show that compared to the state-of-the-art methods, our method improves the accuracy and F1 score by 3.1\\% to 7.5\\% and 3.0\\% to 7.1\\% respectively.",

However, once a device model is widely deployed, the performance of each device becomes different after a period of running. This is caused by the differences in user configurations, environmental conditions, manufacturing variances, battery degradation, etc. Existing DNN compression methods have not taken this scenario into consideration and can not guarantee good compression results in all homogeneous edge devices. To address this, we propose Homogeneous-Device Aware Pruning (HDAP), a hardware-aware DNN compression framework explicitly designed for homogeneous edge devices, aiming to achieve optimal average performance of the compressed model across all devices. To deal with the difficulty of time-consuming hardware-aware evaluations for thousands or millions of homogeneous edge devices, HDAP partitions all the devices into several device clusters, which can dramatically reduce the number of devices to evaluate and use the surrogate-based evaluation instead of hardware evaluation in real-time. Extensive experiments on multiple device types (Jetson Xavier NX and Jetson Nano) and task types (image classification with ResNet50, MobileNetV1, ResNet56, VGG16; object detection with YOLOv8n) demonstrate that HDAP consistently achieves lower average latency and competitive accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods, with significant speedups (e.g., 2.86$\\times$ on ResNet50 at 1.0G FLOPs). HDAP offers an effective solution for scalable, high-performance DNN deployment methods for homogeneous edge devices.",

However, the traditional paradigm of developing features, fixing bugs, and maintaining the system incurs significant overhead, especially as systems grow in complexity. This paper proposes a new paradigm, generative file systems, which leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate and evolve a file system from prompts, effectively addressing the need for robust evolution. Despite the widespread success of LLMs in code generation, attempts to create a functional file system have thus far been unsuccessful, mainly due to the ambiguity of natural language prompts.\n  This paper introduces SYSSPEC, a framework for developing generative file systems. Its key insight is to replace ambiguous natural language with principles adapted from formal methods. Instead of imprecise prompts, SYSSPEC employs a multi-part specification that accurately describes a file system's functionality, modularity, and concurrency. The specification acts as an unambiguous blueprint, guiding LLMs to generate expected code flexibly. To manage evolution, we develop a DAG-structured patch that operates on the specification itself, enabling new features to be added without violating existing invariants. Moreover, the SYSSPEC toolchain features a set of LLM-based agents with mechanisms to mitigate hallucination during construction and evolution. We demonstrate our approach by generating SPECFS, a concurrent file system. SPECFS passes hundreds of regression tests, matching a manually-coded baseline. We further confirm its evolvability by seamlessly integrating 10 real-world features from Ext4. Our work shows that a specification-guided approach makes generating and evolving complex systems not only feasible but also highly effective.",

In this paper, we introduce SNS-Bench-VL, a comprehensive multimodal benchmark designed to assess the performance of Vision-Language LLMs in real-world social media scenarios. SNS-Bench-VL incorporates images and text across 8 multimodal tasks, including note comprehension, user engagement analysis, information retrieval, and personalized recommendation. It comprises 4,001 carefully curated multimodal question-answer pairs, covering single-choice, multiple-choice, and open-ended tasks. We evaluate over 25 state-of-the-art multimodal LLMs, analyzing their performance across tasks. Our findings highlight persistent challenges in multimodal social context comprehension. We hope SNS-Bench-VL will inspire future research towards robust, context-aware, and human-aligned multimodal intelligence for next-generation social networking services.",

This paper presents a method for designing controllers that minimize inter-agent communication in multi-agent systems while satisfying safety and coordination requirements, while conforming to communication delay constraints. The control synthesis problem is cast as a rank minimization problem, where a convex relaxation is obtained via system level synthesis.

This paper presents a method for designing controllers that minimize inter-agent communication in multi-agent systems while satisfying safety and coordination requirements, while conforming to communication delay constraints. The control synthesis problem is cast as a rank minimization problem, where a convex relaxation is obtained via system level synthesis. Simulation results on various tasks, including trajectory tracking with relative and heterogeneous sensing, demonstrate that the proposed method significantly reduces inter-agent transmission compared to baseline approaches."

However, accurately recording all wrong-way cycling events is both unnecessary and infeasible in resource-constrained environments, as it requires high-resolution cameras for evidence collection and event detection. To address this challenge, we propose WWC-Predictor, a novel method for efficiently estimating the wrong-way cycling ratio, defined as the proportion of wrong-way cycling events relative to the total number of cycling movements over a given time period. The core innovation of our method lies in accurately detecting wrong-way cycling events in sparsely sampled frames using a light-weight detector, then estimating the overall ratio using an autoregressive moving average model. To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we construct a benchmark dataset consisting of 35 minutes of video sequences with minute-level annotations.Our method achieves an average error rate of a mere 1.475\\% while consuming only 19.12\\% GPU time required by conventional tracking methods, validating its effectiveness in estimating the wrong-way cycling ratio.

Using word association datasets from native speakers in the US (English) and China (Mandarin), we train Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen-2.5-7B via supervised fine-tuning and preference optimization. We evaluate models' cultural alignment through a two-tier evaluation framework that spans lexical associations and cultural value alignment using the World Values Survey. Results show significant improvements in lexical alignment (16-20% English, 43-165% Mandarin on Precision@5) and high-level cultural value shifts. On a subset of 50 questions where US and Chinese respondents diverge most, fine-tuned Qwen nearly doubles its response alignment with Chinese values (13 to 25). Remarkably, our trained 7-8B models match or exceed vanilla 70B baselines, demonstrating that a few million of culture-grounded associations achieve value alignment without expensive retraining.

In this paper, we introduce DABL, a novel approach for detecting semantic anomalies in business processes using large language models (LLMs). We collect 143,137 real-world process models from various domains. By generating normal traces through the playout of these process models and simulating both ordering and exclusion anomalies, we fine-tune Llama 2 using the resulting log. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that DABL surpasses existing state-of-the-art semantic anomaly detection methods in terms of both generalization ability and learning of given processes.

Through a systematic analysis of recent research published between 2020 and 2025, we explore how LLMs are being integrated into various aspects of power system operations, planning, and management. The review covers key application areas including fault diagnosis, load forecasting, cybersecurity, control and optimization, system planning, simulation, and knowledge management. Our findings indicate that while LLMs show promising potential in enhancing power system operations through their advanced natural language processing and reasoning capabilities, significant challenges remain in their practical implementation. These challenges include limited domain-specific training data, concerns about reliability and safety in critical infrastructure, and the need for enhanced explainability. The review also highlights emerging trends such as the development of power system-specific LLMs and hybrid approaches combining LLMs with traditional power engineering methods. We identify crucial research directions for advancing the field, including the development of specialized architectures, improved security frameworks, and enhanced integration with existing power system tools. This survey provides power system researchers and practitioners with a comprehensive overview of the current state of LLM applications in the field and outlines future pathways for research and development.",

However, real-world applications often face situations where no training data is available, such as when launching new services or handling entirely new users. In such cases, conventional approaches cannot be applied. This study focuses on training-free recommendation, where no task-specific training is performed, and particularly on \\textit{training-free cold-start recommendation} (TFCSR), the more challenging case where the target user has no interactions. Large language models (LLMs) have recently been explored as a promising solution, and numerous studies have been proposed. As the ability of text embedding models (TEMs) increases, they are increasingly recognized as applicable to training-free recommendation, but no prior work has directly compared LLMs and TEMs under identical conditions. We present the first controlled experiments that systematically evaluate these two approaches in the same setting. The results show that TEMs outperform LLM rerankers, and this trend holds not only in cold-start settings but also in warm-start settings with rich interactions. These findings indicate that direct LLM ranking is not the only viable option, contrary to the commonly shared belief, and TEM-based approaches provide a stronger and more scalable basis for training-free recommendation.",
