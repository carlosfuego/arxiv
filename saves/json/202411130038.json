Specifically, we decompose the MoE\nlayer in LLMs by placing the gating network and the preceding neural network\nlayer at BS, while distributing the expert networks among the devices. This\ndeployment leverages the parallel inference capabilities of expert networks on\nmobile devices, effectively utilizing the limited computing and caching\nresources of these devices. Accordingly, we develop a performance metric for\nWDMoE-based LLMs, which accounts for both model capability and latency. To\nminimize the latency while maintaining accuracy, we jointly optimize expert\nselection and bandwidth allocation based on the performance metric. Moreover,\nwe build a hardware testbed using NVIDIA Jetson kits to validate the\neffectiveness of WDMoE. Both theoretical simulations and practical hardware\nexperiments demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly reduce the\nlatency without compromising LLM performance.",

                "summary": "Incremental graph learning has gained significant attention for its ability\nto address the catastrophic forgetting problem in graph representation\nlearning. However, traditional methods often rely on a large number of labels\nfor node classification, which is impractical in real-world applications. This\nmakes few-shot incremental learning on graphs a pressing need. Current methods\ntypically require extensive training samples from meta-learning to build memory\nand perform intensive fine-tuning of GNN parameters, leading to high memory\nconsumption and potential loss of previously learned knowledge. To tackle these\nchallenges, we introduce Mecoin, an efficient method for building and\nmaintaining memory. Mecoin employs Structured Memory Units to cache prototypes\nof learned categories, as well as Memory Construction Modules to update these\nprototypes for new categories through interactions between the nodes and the\ncached prototypes. Additionally, we have designed a Memory Representation\nAdaptation Module to store probabilities associated with each class prototype,\nreducing the need for parameter fine-tuning and lowering the forgetting rate.\nWhen a sample matches its corresponding class prototype, the relevant\nprobabilities are retrieved from the MRaM. Knowledge is then distilled back\ninto the GNN through a Graph Knowledge Distillation Module, preserving the\nmodel's memory. We analyze the effectiveness of Mecoin in terms of\ngeneralization error and explore the impact of different distillation\nstrategies on model performance through experiments and VC-dimension analysis.\nCompared to other related works, Mecoin shows superior performance in accuracy\nand forgetting rate. Our code is publicly available on the\nhttps://github.com/Arvin0313/Mecoin-GFSCIL.git .",

To address the limited resources\nof IIoT sensor devices, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted mobile edge\ncomputing (MEC) has emerged as a promising solution, providing flexible and\ncost-effective services in close proximity of IIoT sensor devices (ISDs).\nHowever, leveraging aerial MEC to meet the delay-sensitive and\ncomputation-intensive requirements of the ISDs could face several challenges,\nincluding the limited communication, computation and caching (3C) resources,\nstringent offloading requirements for 3C services, and constrained on-board\nenergy of UAVs. To address these issues, we first present a collaborative\naerial MEC-assisted ICPS architecture by incorporating the computing\ncapabilities of the macro base station (MBS) and UAVs. We then formulate a\nservice delay minimization optimization problem (SDMOP). Since the SDMOP is\nproved to be an NP-hard problem, we propose a joint computation offloading,\ncaching, communication resource allocation, computation resource allocation,\nand UAV trajectory control approach (JC5A). Specifically, JC5A consists of a\nblock successive upper bound minimization method of multipliers (BSUMM) for\ncomputation offloading and service caching, a convex optimization-based method\nfor communication and computation resource allocation, and a successive convex\napproximation (SCA)-based method for UAV trajectory control. Moreover, we\ntheoretically prove the convergence and polynomial complexity of JC5A.\nSimulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach can achieve superior\nsystem performance compared to the benchmark approaches and algorithms.",

To address these issues, we first present a collaborative\naerial MEC-assisted ICPS architecture by incorporating the computing\ncapabilities of the macro base station (MBS) and UAVs. We then formulate a\nservice delay minimization optimization problem (SDMOP). Since the SDMOP is\nproved to be an NP-hard problem, we propose a joint computation offloading,\ncaching, communication resource allocation, computation resource allocation,\nand UAV trajectory control approach (JC5A). Specifically, JC5A consists of a\nblock successive upper bound minimization method of multipliers (BSUMM) for\ncomputation offloading and service caching, a convex optimization-based method\nfor communication and computation resource allocation, and a successive convex\napproximation (SCA)-based method for UAV trajectory control. Moreover, we\ntheoretically prove the convergence and polynomial complexity of JC5A.\nSimulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach can achieve superior\nsystem performance compared to the benchmark approaches and algorithms."

We conduct a thorough evaluation of Hunyuan-Large's superior\nperformance across various benchmarks including language understanding and\ngeneration, logical reasoning, mathematical problem-solving, coding,\nlong-context, and aggregated tasks, where it outperforms LLama3.1-70B and\nexhibits comparable performance when compared to the significantly larger\nLLama3.1-405B model. Key practice of Hunyuan-Large include large-scale\nsynthetic data that is orders larger than in previous literature, a mixed\nexpert routing strategy, a key-value cache compression technique, and an\nexpert-specific learning rate strategy. Additionally, we also investigate the\nscaling laws and learning rate schedule of mixture of experts models, providing\nvaluable insights and guidances for future model development and optimization.\nThe code and checkpoints of Hunyuan-Large are released to facilitate future\ninnovations and applications.\n  Codes: https://github.com/Tencent/Hunyuan-Large\n  Models: https://huggingface.co/tencent/Tencent-Hunyuan-Large",

This communication\noften includes the full context of the query so far, which can introduce\nsignificant prefill-phase latency, especially with long contexts.\n  We introduce DroidSpeak, a novel framework to target this cross-LLM\ncommunication by leveraging the reuse of intermediate data, such as input\nembeddings (E-cache) and key-value caches (KV-cache).

While traditional content\nrecommendations are oblivious to network conditions, the paradigm of\nNetwork-Friendly Recommendations (NFR) has recently emerged, favoring content\nthat improves network performance (e.g. cached near the user), while still\nbeing appealing to the user. However, NFR algorithms sometimes achieve their\ngoal by shrinking the pool of content recommended to users.

This reduced diversity is problematic for both\nusers, who are prevented from exploring a broader range of content, and content\ncreators (e.g. YouTubers) whose content may be recommended less frequently,\nleading to perceived unfairness. In this paper, we first investigate - using\nreal data and state-of-the-art NFR schemes - the extent of this phenomenon. We\nthen formulate a ``Diverse-NFR'' optimization problem (i.e., network-friendly\nrecommendations with - sufficient - content diversity), and through a series of\ntransformation steps, we manage to reduce it to a linear program that can be\nsolved fast and optimally.

Similar to an implementation of LRU using queues, it adapts to\nchanging workload patterns based on the history of requests for different\nkey-value pairs. It is superior to LRU because it considers both the size and\ncost of key-value pairs to maximize the utility of the available memory across\ncompeting applications. We compare CAMP with both LRU and an alternative that\nrequires human intervention to partition memory into pools and assign grouping\nof key-value pairs to different pools.

Similar to an implementation of LRU using queues, it adapts to\nchanging workload patterns based on the history of requests for different\nkey-value pairs. It is superior to LRU because it considers both the size and\ncost of key-value pairs to maximize the utility of the available memory across\ncompeting applications. We compare CAMP with both LRU and an alternative that\nrequires human intervention to partition memory into pools and assign grouping\nof key-value pairs to different pools. The results demonstrate CAMP is as fast\nas LRU while outperforming both LRU and the pooled alternative. We also present\nresults from an implementation of CAMP using Twitter's version of memcached."

Further\nimprovement of the systems scalability was done through the use of Docker and\nKubernetes which enabled services to be expanded horizontally to cope with the\nchanges in demand. The error rates were very low, at 0.2% further enhancing the\nefficiency of the system in handling real-time data integration. This approach\nis suggested to meet the specific needs of the airline reservation system. It\nis secure, fast, scalable, all serving to improve the user experience as well\nas the efficiency of operations.

A system throughput of 1050 events per second was\nachieved so that the acceptability level was maintained even during peak time.\nRedis caching reduced a 92% cache hit ratio on the database thereby lowering\nthe burden on the database and increasing the speed of response. Further\nimprovement of the systems scalability was done through the use of Docker and\nKubernetes which enabled services to be expanded horizontally to cope with the\nchanges in demand. The error rates were very low, at 0.2% further enhancing the\nefficiency of the system in handling real-time data integration. This approach\nis suggested to meet the specific needs of the airline reservation system. It\nis secure, fast, scalable, all serving to improve the user experience as well\nas the efficiency of operations. The low latency and high data integration\nlevels and prevaiing efficient usage of the resources demonstrates the\narchitecture ability to offer continued support in the ever growing high demand\nsituations."

To alleviate the computation cost of running $k$\ninference passes, we propose Superposed Decoding, a new decoding algorithm that\ngenerates $k$ drafts at the computation cost of one autoregressive inference\npass. We achieve this by feeding a superposition of the most recent token\nembeddings from the $k$ drafts as input to the next decoding step of the\nlanguage model. At every inference step we combine the $k$ drafts with the\ntop-$k$ tokens to get $k^2$ new drafts and cache the $k$ most likely options,\nusing an n-gram interpolation with minimal compute overhead to filter out\nincoherent generations. Our experiments show that $k$ drafts from Superposed\nDecoding are at least as coherent and factual as Nucleus Sampling and Greedy\nDecoding respectively, while being at least $2.44\\times$ faster for $k\\ge3$.

Additionally, BUZZ achieves significant\ninference speedup with a $\\log{n}$ time complexity. The code is available at\nhttps://github.com/JunqiZhao888/buzz-llm."

                "summary": "Last few years have seen unprecedented advances in capabilities of Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs). These advancements promise to deeply benefit a vast\narray of application domains. However, due to their immense size, performing\ninference with LLMs is both costly and slow. Consequently, a plethora of recent\nwork has proposed strategies to enhance inference efficiency, e.g.,\nquantization, pruning, and caching. These acceleration strategies reduce the\ninference cost and latency, often by several factors, while maintaining much of\nthe predictive performance measured via common benchmarks. In this work, we\nexplore another critical aspect of LLM performance: demographic bias in model\ngenerations due to inference acceleration optimizations. Using a wide range of\nmetrics, we probe bias in model outputs from a number of angles. Analysis of\noutputs before and after inference acceleration shows significant change in\nbias.

                    "value": "Last few years have seen unprecedented advances in capabilities of Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs). These advancements promise to deeply benefit a vast\narray of application domains. However, due to their immense size, performing\ninference with LLMs is both costly and slow. Consequently, a plethora of recent\nwork has proposed strategies to enhance inference efficiency, e.g.,\nquantization, pruning, and caching. These acceleration strategies reduce the\ninference cost and latency, often by several factors, while maintaining much of\nthe predictive performance measured via common benchmarks. In this work, we\nexplore another critical aspect of LLM performance: demographic bias in model\ngenerations due to inference acceleration optimizations. Using a wide range of\nmetrics, we probe bias in model outputs from a number of angles. Analysis of\noutputs before and after inference acceleration shows significant change in\nbias. Worryingly, these bias effects are complex and unpredictable. A\ncombination of an acceleration strategy and bias type may show little bias\nchange in one model but may lead to a large effect in another. Our results\nhighlight a need for in-depth and case-by-case evaluation of model bias after\nit has been modified to accelerate inference."

However, as the key-value (KV) cache expands with the sequence\nlength, the increasing memory footprint and the need to access it for each\ntoken generation both result in low throughput when serving long-context LLMs.\nWhile various dynamic sparse attention methods have been proposed to speed up\ninference while maintaining generation quality, they either fail to\nsufficiently reduce GPU memory consumption or introduce significant decoding\nlatency by offloading the KV cache to the CPU. We present ShadowKV, a\nhigh-throughput long-context LLM inference system that stores the low-rank key\ncache and offloads the value cache to reduce the memory footprint for larger\nbatch sizes and longer sequences. To minimize decoding latency, ShadowKV\nemploys an accurate KV selection strategy that reconstructs minimal sparse KV\npairs on-the-fly. By evaluating ShadowKV on a broad range of benchmarks,\nincluding RULER, LongBench, and Needle In A Haystack, and models like\nLlama-3.1-8B, Llama-3-8B-1M, GLM-4-9B-1M, Yi-9B-200K, Phi-3-Mini-128K, and\nQwen2-7B-128K, we demonstrate that it can support up to 6$\\times$ larger batch\nsizes and boost throughput by up to 3.04$\\times$ on an A100 GPU without\nsacrificing accuracy, even surpassing the performance achievable with infinite\nbatch size under the assumption of infinite GPU memory.

However, as the key-value (KV) cache expands with the sequence\nlength, the increasing memory footprint and the need to access it for each\ntoken generation both result in low throughput when serving long-context LLMs.\nWhile various dynamic sparse attention methods have been proposed to speed up\ninference while maintaining generation quality, they either fail to\nsufficiently reduce GPU memory consumption or introduce significant decoding\nlatency by offloading the KV cache to the CPU. We present ShadowKV, a\nhigh-throughput long-context LLM inference system that stores the low-rank key\ncache and offloads the value cache to reduce the memory footprint for larger\nbatch sizes and longer sequences. To minimize decoding latency, ShadowKV\nemploys an accurate KV selection strategy that reconstructs minimal sparse KV\npairs on-the-fly. By evaluating ShadowKV on a broad range of benchmarks,\nincluding RULER, LongBench, and Needle In A Haystack, and models like\nLlama-3.1-8B, Llama-3-8B-1M, GLM-4-9B-1M, Yi-9B-200K, Phi-3-Mini-128K, and\nQwen2-7B-128K, we demonstrate that it can support up to 6$\\times$ larger batch\nsizes and boost throughput by up to 3.04$\\times$ on an A100 GPU without\nsacrificing accuracy, even surpassing the performance achievable with infinite\nbatch size under the assumption of infinite GPU memory. The code is available\nat https://github.com/bytedance/ShadowKV."

Quantization\nis a promising approach for compressing KV cache activations; however, existing\nsolutions fail to represent activations accurately in sub-4-bit precision. Our\nwork, KVQuant, facilitates low precision KV cache quantization by incorporating\nseveral novel methods: (i) Per-Channel Key Quantization, where we adjust the\ndimension along which we quantize the Key activations to better match the\ndistribution; (ii) Pre-RoPE Key Quantization, where we quantize Key activations\nbefore the rotary positional embedding to mitigate its impact on quantization;\n(iii) Non-Uniform KV Cache Quantization, where we derive per-layer\nsensitivity-weighted non-uniform datatypes that better represent the\ndistributions; and (iv) Per-Vector Dense-and-Sparse Quantization, where we\nisolate outliers separately for each vector to minimize skews in quantization\nranges. By applying our method to the LLaMA, Llama-2, Llama-3, and Mistral\nmodels, we achieve < 0.1 perplexity degradation with 3-bit quantization on both\nWikitext-2 and C4, outperforming existing approaches.

In this study, we\nconsider the mathematical reasoning task, defining each reasoning step as text\naccompanied by a Python code snippet. To facilitate a longer reasoning path,\nself-correction is enabled through interactions with the code interpreter. Our\nMCoT aims to compress previous reasoning steps into a simplified question,\nenabling efficient next-step inference without relying on a lengthy KV cache.\nIn our experiments, we curate the \\texttt{MCoTInstruct} dataset, and the\nempirical results indicate that MCoT not only significantly enhances efficiency\nbut also maintains comparable accuracy. While much remains to be explored, this\nwork paves the way for exploring the long CoT reasoning abilities of LLMs."

We adapt the standard recipe with minimal changes to compress the output\nof any key or value projection matrix in a pretrained LLM: we scale the vector\nby its standard deviation, divide channels into groups and then quantize each\ngroup with the same residual vector quantizer. We learn the codebook using\nexponential moving average and there are no other learnable parameters\nincluding the input and output projections normally used in a vector\nquantization set up. We find that a residual depth of 8 recovers most of the\nperformance of the unquantized model. We also find that grouping non-contiguous\nchannels together works better than grouping contiguous channels for\ncompressing key matrix and the method further benefits from a light weight\nfinetuning of LLM together with the quantization. Overall, the proposed\ntechnique is competitive with existing quantization methods while being much\nsimpler and results in 5.5x compression compared to half precision.",

We learn the codebook using\nexponential moving average and there are no other learnable parameters\nincluding the input and output projections normally used in a vector\nquantization set up. We find that a residual depth of 8 recovers most of the\nperformance of the unquantized model. We also find that grouping non-contiguous\nchannels together works better than grouping contiguous channels for\ncompressing key matrix and the method further benefits from a light weight\nfinetuning of LLM together with the quantization. Overall, the proposed\ntechnique is competitive with existing quantization methods while being much\nsimpler and results in 5.5x compression compared to half precision."

Edge AI aims to optimize data processing efficiency and\nvelocity while ensuring data confidentiality and integrity. Despite being a\nrelatively new field of research from 2014 to the present, it has shown\nsignificant and rapid development over the last five years. This article\npresents a systematic literature review for Edge AI to discuss the existing\nresearch, recent advancements, and future research directions. We created a\ncollaborative edge AI learning system for cloud and edge computing analysis,\nincluding an in-depth study of the architectures that facilitate this\nmechanism. The taxonomy for Edge AI facilitates the classification and\nconfiguration of Edge AI systems while examining its potential influence across\nmany fields through compassing infrastructure, cloud computing, fog computing,\nservices, use cases, ML and deep learning, and resource management. This study\nhighlights the significance of Edge AI in processing real-time data at the edge\nof the network. Additionally, it emphasizes the research challenges encountered\nby Edge AI systems, including constraints on resources, vulnerabilities to\nsecurity threats, and problems with scalability. Finally, this study highlights\nthe potential future research directions that aim to address the current\nlimitations of Edge AI by providing innovative solutions."

To bridge this gap, we develop ChemAgent, an enhanced\nchemistry agent over ChemCrow, and conduct a comprehensive evaluation of its\nperformance on both specialized chemistry tasks and general chemistry\nquestions. Surprisingly, ChemAgent does not consistently outperform its base\nLLMs without tools. Our error analysis with a chemistry expert suggests that:\nFor specialized chemistry tasks, such as synthesis prediction, we should\naugment agents with specialized tools; however, for general chemistry questions\nlike those in exams, agents' ability to reason correctly with chemistry\nknowledge matters more, and tool augmentation does not always help.",

However, their evaluations are narrow in scope,\nleaving a large gap in understanding the benefits of tools across diverse\nchemistry tasks. To bridge this gap, we develop ChemAgent, an enhanced\nchemistry agent over ChemCrow, and conduct a comprehensive evaluation of its\nperformance on both specialized chemistry tasks and general chemistry\nquestions. Surprisingly, ChemAgent does not consistently outperform its base\nLLMs without tools. Our error analysis with a chemistry expert suggests that:\nFor specialized chemistry tasks, such as synthesis prediction, we should\naugment agents with specialized tools; however, for general chemistry questions\nlike those in exams, agents' ability to reason correctly with chemistry\nknowledge matters more, and tool augmentation does not always help."

To address this, we introduce a\nPopulation Dynamics Foundation Model (PDFM) that aims to capture the\nrelationships between diverse data modalities and is applicable to a broad\nrange of geospatial tasks. We first construct a geo-indexed dataset for postal\ncodes and counties across the United States, capturing rich aggregated\ninformation on human behavior from maps, busyness, and aggregated search\ntrends, and environmental factors such as weather and air quality. We then\nmodel this data and the complex relationships between locations using a graph\nneural network, producing embeddings that can be adapted to a wide range of\ndownstream tasks using relatively simple models. We evaluate the effectiveness\nof our approach by benchmarking it on 27 downstream tasks spanning three\ndistinct domains: health indicators, socioeconomic factors, and environmental\nmeasurements.

                "summary": "Recent works have shown a surprising result: a small fraction of Large\nLanguage Model (LLM) parameter outliers are disproportionately important to the\nquality of the model. LLMs contain billions of parameters, so these small\nfractions, such as 0.01%, translate to hundreds of thousands of parameters. In\nthis work, we present an even more surprising finding: Pruning as few as a\nsingle parameter can destroy an LLM's ability to generate text -- increasing\nperplexity by 3 orders of magnitude and reducing zero-shot accuracy to\nguessing. We propose a data-free method for identifying such parameters, termed\nsuper weights, using a single forward pass through the model.

                    "value": "Recent works have shown a surprising result: a small fraction of Large\nLanguage Model (LLM) parameter outliers are disproportionately important to the\nquality of the model. LLMs contain billions of parameters, so these small\nfractions, such as 0.01%, translate to hundreds of thousands of parameters. In\nthis work, we present an even more surprising finding: Pruning as few as a\nsingle parameter can destroy an LLM's ability to generate text -- increasing\nperplexity by 3 orders of magnitude and reducing zero-shot accuracy to\nguessing. We propose a data-free method for identifying such parameters, termed\nsuper weights, using a single forward pass through the model.

Existing autoencoder\nmodels have demonstrated impressive results at a moderate spatial compression\nratio (e.g., 8x), but fail to maintain satisfactory reconstruction accuracy for\nhigh spatial compression ratios (e.g., 64x). We address this challenge by\nintroducing two key techniques: (1) Residual Autoencoding, where we design our\nmodels to learn residuals based on the space-to-channel transformed features to\nalleviate the optimization difficulty of high spatial-compression autoencoders;\n(2) Decoupled High-Resolution Adaptation, an efficient decoupled three-phases\ntraining strategy for mitigating the generalization penalty of high\nspatial-compression autoencoders. With these designs, we improve the\nautoencoder's spatial compression ratio up to 128 while maintaining the\nreconstruction quality. Applying our DC-AE to latent diffusion models, we\nachieve significant speedup without accuracy drop. For example, on ImageNet\n512x512, our DC-AE provides 19.1x inference speedup and 17.9x training speedup\non H100 GPU for UViT-H while achieving a better FID, compared with the widely\nused SD-VAE-f8 autoencoder.

Human-curated symbolic knowledge sources, such as\nlexicons for standard language and slang terms, can potentially elevate social\nmedia signals in evolving language. We introduce a neurosymbolic method that\nintegrates neural networks with symbolic knowledge sources, enhancing the\ndetection and interpretation of mental health-related tweets relevant to\nCOVID-19. Our method was evaluated using a corpus of large datasets\n(approximately 12 billion tweets, 2.5 million subreddit data, and 700k news\narticles) and multiple knowledge graphs. This method dynamically adapts to\nevolving language, outperforming purely data-driven models with an F1 score\nexceeding 92\\%. This approach also showed faster adaptation to new data and\nlower computational demands than fine-tuning pre-trained large language models\n(LLMs).

In this work, we present Chinese\nSimpleQA, the first comprehensive Chinese benchmark to evaluate the factuality\nability of language models to answer short questions, and Chinese SimpleQA\nmainly has five properties (i.e., Chinese, Diverse, High-quality, Static,\nEasy-to-evaluate). Specifically, first, we focus on the Chinese language over 6\nmajor topics with 99 diverse subtopics. Second, we conduct a comprehensive\nquality control process to achieve high-quality questions and answers, where\nthe reference answers are static and cannot be changed over time. Third,\nfollowing SimpleQA, the questions and answers are very short, and the grading\nprocess is easy-to-evaluate based on OpenAI API. Based on Chinese SimpleQA, we\nperform a comprehensive evaluation on the factuality abilities of existing\nLLMs. Finally, we hope that Chinese SimpleQA could guide the developers to\nbetter understand the Chinese factuality abilities of their models and\nfacilitate the growth of foundation models.",

                    "value": "New LLM evaluation benchmarks are important to align with the rapid\ndevelopment of Large Language Models (LLMs). In this work, we present Chinese\nSimpleQA, the first comprehensive Chinese benchmark to evaluate the factuality\nability of language models to answer short questions, and Chinese SimpleQA\nmainly has five properties (i.e., Chinese, Diverse, High-quality, Static,\nEasy-to-evaluate). Specifically, first, we focus on the Chinese language over 6\nmajor topics with 99 diverse subtopics. Second, we conduct a comprehensive\nquality control process to achieve high-quality questions and answers, where\nthe reference answers are static and cannot be changed over time. Third,\nfollowing SimpleQA, the questions and answers are very short, and the grading\nprocess is easy-to-evaluate based on OpenAI API. Based on Chinese SimpleQA, we\nperform a comprehensive evaluation on the factuality abilities of existing\nLLMs. Finally, we hope that Chinese SimpleQA could guide the developers to\nbetter understand the Chinese factuality abilities of their models and\nfacilitate the growth of foundation models."

However, due to the auto-regressive nature of LLMs, they are\nsusceptible to error accumulation during code generation. Once an error is\nproduced, LLMs can merely continue to generate the subsequent code conditioned\non it, given their inability to adjust previous outputs. Existing LLM-based\napproaches typically consider post-revising after code generation, leading to\nthe challenging resolution of accumulated errors and the significant wastage of\nresources.

In this paper, we propose ROCODE, which\nintegrates the backtracking mechanism and program analysis into LLMs for code\ngeneration.

However, recent studies reveal that fine-tuning data,\ndue to their sensitive nature, domain-specific characteristics, and\nidentifiability, pose significant privacy concerns. To help develop more\nprivacy-resilient fine-tuning models, we introduce a novel active privacy\nauditing framework, dubbed Parsing, designed to identify and quantify privacy\nleakage risks during the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of language models (LMs).\nThe framework leverages improved white-box membership inference attacks (MIAs)\nas the core technology, utilizing novel learning objectives and a two-stage\npipeline to monitor the privacy of the LMs' fine-tuning process, maximizing the\nexposure of privacy risks. Additionally, we have improved the effectiveness of\nMIAs on large LMs including GPT-2, Llama2, and certain variants of them. Our\nresearch aims to provide the SFT community of LMs with a reliable, ready-to-use\nprivacy auditing tool, and to offer valuable insights into safeguarding privacy\nduring the fine-tuning process. Experimental results confirm the framework's\nefficiency across various models and tasks, emphasizing notable privacy\nconcerns in the fine-tuning process.

However, recent studies reveal that fine-tuning data,\ndue to their sensitive nature, domain-specific characteristics, and\nidentifiability, pose significant privacy concerns. To help develop more\nprivacy-resilient fine-tuning models, we introduce a novel active privacy\nauditing framework, dubbed Parsing, designed to identify and quantify privacy\nleakage risks during the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of language models (LMs).\nThe framework leverages improved white-box membership inference attacks (MIAs)\nas the core technology, utilizing novel learning objectives and a two-stage\npipeline to monitor the privacy of the LMs' fine-tuning process, maximizing the\nexposure of privacy risks. Additionally, we have improved the effectiveness of\nMIAs on large LMs including GPT-2, Llama2, and certain variants of them. Our\nresearch aims to provide the SFT community of LMs with a reliable, ready-to-use\nprivacy auditing tool, and to offer valuable insights into safeguarding privacy\nduring the fine-tuning process. Experimental results confirm the framework's\nefficiency across various models and tasks, emphasizing notable privacy\nconcerns in the fine-tuning process.

Despite recent advances in Large Language\nModels (LLMs) for Chinese medicine, their performance is sub-optimal in\npediatric applications due to inadequate instruction data and vulnerable\ntraining procedures. To address the above issues, this paper builds PedCorpus,\na high-quality dataset of over 300,000 multi-task instructions from pediatric\ntextbooks, guidelines, and knowledge graph resources to fulfil diverse\ndiagnostic demands. Upon well-designed PedCorpus, we propose PediatricsGPT, the\nfirst Chinese pediatric LLM assistant built on a systematic and robust training\npipeline. In the continuous pre-training phase, we introduce a hybrid\ninstruction pre-training mechanism to mitigate the internal-injected knowledge\ninconsistency of LLMs for medical domain adaptation. Immediately, the\nfull-parameter Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is utilized to incorporate the\ngeneral medical knowledge schema into the models.

                    "value": "Developing intelligent pediatric consultation systems offers promising\nprospects for improving diagnostic efficiency, especially in China, where\nhealthcare resources are scarce. Despite recent advances in Large Language\nModels (LLMs) for Chinese medicine, their performance is sub-optimal in\npediatric applications due to inadequate instruction data and vulnerable\ntraining procedures. To address the above issues, this paper builds PedCorpus,\na high-quality dataset of over 300,000 multi-task instructions from pediatric\ntextbooks, guidelines, and knowledge graph resources to fulfil diverse\ndiagnostic demands. Upon well-designed PedCorpus, we propose PediatricsGPT, the\nfirst Chinese pediatric LLM assistant built on a systematic and robust training\npipeline. In the continuous pre-training phase, we introduce a hybrid\ninstruction pre-training mechanism to mitigate the internal-injected knowledge\ninconsistency of LLMs for medical domain adaptation. Immediately, the\nfull-parameter Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is utilized to incorporate the\ngeneral medical knowledge schema into the models. After that, we devise a\ndirect following preference optimization to enhance the generation of\npediatrician-like humanistic responses. In the parameter-efficient secondary\nSFT phase, a mixture of universal-specific experts strategy is presented to\nresolve the competency conflict between medical generalist and pediatric\nexpertise mastery.

The\nQ-learning agent on the first layer learns the robot's higher-level behaviour.\nOn the second layer, a heuristic-based ToM infers the user's intended strategy\nand is responsible for implementing the robot's assistance, as well as\nproviding the motivation behind its choice. We conducted a user study in a\nreal-world setting, involving 56 participants who interacted with either an\nadaptive robot capable of ToM, or with a robot lacking such abilities. Our\nfindings suggest that participants in the ToM condition performed better,\naccepted the robot's assistance more often, and perceived its ability to adapt,\npredict and recognise their intents to a higher degree. Our preliminary\ninsights could inform future research and pave the way for designing more\ncomplex computation architectures for adaptive behaviour with ToM capabilities.",

In this work, we present an exploratory comparative\nstudy to investigate how social robots equipped with ToM abilities impact\nusers' performance and perception. We design a two-layer architecture. The\nQ-learning agent on the first layer learns the robot's higher-level behaviour.\nOn the second layer, a heuristic-based ToM infers the user's intended strategy\nand is responsible for implementing the robot's assistance, as well as\nproviding the motivation behind its choice. We conducted a user study in a\nreal-world setting, involving 56 participants who interacted with either an\nadaptive robot capable of ToM, or with a robot lacking such abilities. Our\nfindings suggest that participants in the ToM condition performed better,\naccepted the robot's assistance more often, and perceived its ability to adapt,\npredict and recognise their intents to a higher degree. Our preliminary\ninsights could inform future research and pave the way for designing more\ncomplex computation architectures for adaptive behaviour with ToM capabilities."

Moreover, directly using pre-estimated angles to calculate\nweighted coefficients can lead to performance loss. Thus, a green multi-modal\n(MM) fusion DOA framework is proposed to realize a more practical, low-cost and\nhigh time-efficiency DOA estimation for a H$^2$AD array.

One of the most common use cases is conversational interactions,\nenabled by the language generation capabilities of LLMs. Just as between two\nhumans, a conversation between an LLM-powered entity and a human depends on the\npersonality of the conversants.

This paper introduces the Language Model\nLinguistic Personality Assessment (LMLPA), a system designed to evaluate the\nlinguistic personalities of LLMs. Our system helps to understand LLMs' language\ngeneration capabilities by quantitatively assessing the distinct personality\ntraits reflected in their linguistic outputs. Unlike traditional human-centric\npsychometrics, the LMLPA adapts a personality assessment questionnaire,\nspecifically the Big Five Inventory, to align with the operational capabilities\nof LLMs, and also incorporates the findings from previous language-based\npersonality measurement literature. To mitigate sensitivity to the order of\noptions, our questionnaire is designed to be open-ended, resulting in textual\nanswers. Thus, the AI rater is needed to transform ambiguous personality\ninformation from text responses into clear numerical indicators of personality\ntraits. Utilising Principal Component Analysis and reliability validations, our\nfindings demonstrate that LLMs possess distinct personality traits that can be\neffectively quantified by the LMLPA.

For topic\nmodeling, we leverage the stack of BERTopic scaled up to be applied on large\ncorpora of textual documents (we find hundreds of topics on hundreds of\nthousands of documents), introducing i) a novel LLM-based embeddings\ncomputation for representing scientific abstracts in the continuous space and\nii) a hyperparameter optimizer to efficiently find the best configuration for\nany new big datasets. We additionally produce the visualization of results on\ninteractive dashboards reporting topics' temporal evolution. Results are made\ninspectable and explorable, contributing to the interpretability of the topic\nmodeling process. Our proposed LLM-based topic modeling pipeline for big-text\ndatasets allows users to capture insights on the evolution of the attitude\ntoward SDGs within scientific abstracts in the 2006-2023 time span. All the\nresults are reproducible by using our system; the workflow can be generalized\nto be applied at any point in time to any big corpus of textual documents."

The trained models have been available at\n\\href{https://huggingface.co/collections/yang31210999/llm-neo-66e3c882f5579b829ff57eba}{this\nrepository}."

Aliasing folds\nhigh-frequency components into the low-frequency range, making aliased and\noriginal frequency components indistinguishable and introducing two practical\nissues. First, aliasing complicates the waveform generation process, as the\nsubsequent layers must address these aliasing effects, increasing the\ncomputational complexity. Second, it limits extrapolation performance,\nparticularly in handling high fundamental frequencies, which degrades the\nperceptual quality of generated speech waveforms. This paper demonstrates that\n1) time-domain nonlinear operations inevitably introduce aliasing but provide a\nstrong inductive bias for harmonic generation, and 2) time-frequency-domain\nprocessing can achieve aliasing-free waveform synthesis but lacks the inductive\nbias for effective harmonic generation. Building on this insight, we propose\nWavehax, an aliasing-free neural WAVEform generator that integrates 2D\nconvolution and a HArmonic prior for reliable Complex Spectrogram estimation.\nExperimental results show that Wavehax achieves speech quality comparable to\nexisting high-fidelity neural vocoders and exhibits exceptional robustness in\nscenarios requiring high fundamental frequency extrapolation, where aliasing\neffects become typically severe. Moreover, Wavehax requires less than 5% of the\nmultiply-accumulate operations and model parameters compared to HiFi-GAN V1,\nwhile achieving over four times faster CPU inference speed.",

As an alternative form of natural\nlanguage, input-output examples (I/O examples) provide an accessible,\nunambiguous, and flexible way to describe functionalities, but the diversity,\nsparseness, and incompleteness of I/O examples also place challenges on\nunderstanding and implementing requirements. Therefore, generating code from\ninput-output examples (i.e., example-based code generation) provides a new\nperspective, allowing us to evaluate LLMs' capability to infer target\nfunctionalities from limited information and to process new-form requirements.\nHowever, related research about LLMs in example-based code generation remains\nlargely unexplored. To fill this gap, this paper presents the first\ncomprehensive study on example-based code generation using LLMs. To address the\nincorrectness caused by the incompleteness of I/O examples, we adopt an\niterative evaluation framework and formalize the objective of example-based\ncode generation as two sequential sub-objectives: generating code conforming to\ngiven examples and generating code that successfully implements the target\nfunctionalities from (iteratively) given examples. We assess six\nstate-of-the-art LLMs using a new benchmark of 168 diverse target\nfunctionalities. The results demonstrate that when requirements were described\nusing iterative I/O examples rather than natural language, the LLMs' score\ndecreased by over 60%, indicating that example-based code generation remains\nchallenging for the evaluated LLMs. More interestingly, the vast majority (even\nover 95%) of successfully implemented functionalities are achieved in the first\nround of iterations, suggesting that the LLMs struggle to effectively utilize\nthe iteratively supplemented requirements.",

Not only are current CC-ReID models\nconstrained by the limited diversity of clothing in current CC-ReID datasets,\nbut generating additional data that retains important personal features for\naccurate identification is a current challenge. To address this issue we\npropose DLCR, a novel data expansion framework that leverages pre-trained\ndiffusion and large language models (LLMs) to accurately generate diverse\nimages of individuals in varied attire.

Subsequently, the system\nincrementally identifies unknown attack types by leveraging a Gaussian Mixture\nModel (GMM) to cluster features derived from high-dimensional BERT embeddings.\nThis approach allows the framework to dynamically adjust its identification\ncapabilities as new attack clusters are discovered, maintaining high detection\naccuracy.

However, traditional\nfrequency-based, data-driven neural network-based approaches can miss newly\nrelevant content due to the evolving nature of language in a dynamically\nevolving environment. Human-curated symbolic knowledge sources, such as\nlexicons for standard language and slang terms, can potentially elevate social\nmedia signals in evolving language. We introduce a neurosymbolic method that\nintegrates neural networks with symbolic knowledge sources, enhancing the\ndetection and interpretation of mental health-related tweets relevant to\nCOVID-19. Our method was evaluated using a corpus of large datasets\n(approximately 12 billion tweets, 2.5 million subreddit data, and 700k news\narticles) and multiple knowledge graphs. This method dynamically adapts to\nevolving language, outperforming purely data-driven models with an F1 score\nexceeding 92\\%. This approach also showed faster adaptation to new data and\nlower computational demands than fine-tuning pre-trained large language models\n(LLMs). This study demonstrates the benefit of neurosymbolic methods in\ninterpreting text in a dynamic environment for tasks such as health\nsurveillance.",

                    "value": "Monitoring public sentiment via social media is potentially helpful during\nhealth crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic. However, traditional\nfrequency-based, data-driven neural network-based approaches can miss newly\nrelevant content due to the evolving nature of language in a dynamically\nevolving environment. Human-curated symbolic knowledge sources, such as\nlexicons for standard language and slang terms, can potentially elevate social\nmedia signals in evolving language. We introduce a neurosymbolic method that\nintegrates neural networks with symbolic knowledge sources, enhancing the\ndetection and interpretation of mental health-related tweets relevant to\nCOVID-19. Our method was evaluated using a corpus of large datasets\n(approximately 12 billion tweets, 2.5 million subreddit data, and 700k news\narticles) and multiple knowledge graphs. This method dynamically adapts to\nevolving language, outperforming purely data-driven models with an F1 score\nexceeding 92\\%. This approach also showed faster adaptation to new data and\nlower computational demands than fine-tuning pre-trained large language models\n(LLMs). This study demonstrates the benefit of neurosymbolic methods in\ninterpreting text in a dynamic environment for tasks such as health\nsurveillance."

                "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in code\ngeneration recently, offering programmers revolutionary assistance in software\ndevelopment. However, due to the auto-regressive nature of LLMs, they are\nsusceptible to error accumulation during code generation. Once an error is\nproduced, LLMs can merely continue to generate the subsequent code conditioned\non it, given their inability to adjust previous outputs. Existing LLM-based\napproaches typically consider post-revising after code generation, leading to\nthe challenging resolution of accumulated errors and the significant wastage of\nresources. Ideally, LLMs should rollback and resolve the occurred error in time\nduring code generation, rather than proceed on the basis of the error and wait\nfor post-revising after generation. In this paper, we propose ROCODE, which\nintegrates the backtracking mechanism and program analysis into LLMs for code\ngeneration. Specifically, we employ program analysis to perform incremental\nerror detection during the generation process. When an error is detected, the\nbacktracking mechanism is triggered to priming rollback strategies and\nconstraint regeneration, thereby eliminating the error early and ensuring\ncontinued generation on the correct basis. Experiments on multiple code\ngeneration benchmarks show that ROCODE can significantly reduce the errors\ngenerated by LLMs, with a compilation pass rate of 99.1%.

                    "value": "Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in code\ngeneration recently, offering programmers revolutionary assistance in software\ndevelopment. However, due to the auto-regressive nature of LLMs, they are\nsusceptible to error accumulation during code generation. Once an error is\nproduced, LLMs can merely continue to generate the subsequent code conditioned\non it, given their inability to adjust previous outputs. Existing LLM-based\napproaches typically consider post-revising after code generation, leading to\nthe challenging resolution of accumulated errors and the significant wastage of\nresources. Ideally, LLMs should rollback and resolve the occurred error in time\nduring code generation, rather than proceed on the basis of the error and wait\nfor post-revising after generation. In this paper, we propose ROCODE, which\nintegrates the backtracking mechanism and program analysis into LLMs for code\ngeneration. Specifically, we employ program analysis to perform incremental\nerror detection during the generation process. When an error is detected, the\nbacktracking mechanism is triggered to priming rollback strategies and\nconstraint regeneration, thereby eliminating the error early and ensuring\ncontinued generation on the correct basis. Experiments on multiple code\ngeneration benchmarks show that ROCODE can significantly reduce the errors\ngenerated by LLMs, with a compilation pass rate of 99.1%. The test pass rate is\nimproved by up to 23.8% compared to the best baseline approach. Compared to the\npost-revising baseline, the token cost is reduced by 19.3%. Moreover, our\napproach is model-agnostic and achieves consistent improvements across nine\nrepresentative LLMs."

To address\nthese limitations, we present AutoRestTest, the first black-box framework to\nadopt a dependency-embedded multi-agent approach for REST API testing,\nintegrating Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) with a Semantic Property\nDependency Graph (SPDG) and Large Language Models (LLMs). Our approach treats\nREST API testing as a separable problem, where four agents -- API, dependency,\nparameter, and value -- collaborate to optimize API exploration. LLMs handle\ndomain-specific value restrictions, the SPDG model simplifies the search space\nfor dependencies using a similarity score between API operations, and MARL\ndynamically optimizes the agents' behavior. Evaluated on 12 real-world REST\nservices, AutoRestTest outperforms the four leading black-box REST API testing\ntools, including those assisted by RESTGPT (which augments realistic test\ninputs using LLMs), in terms of code coverage, operation coverage, and fault\ndetection.

The first is implementation complexity, as autonomy requires\nhybrid RISs (HRISs) equipped with additional on-board hardware to monitor the\npropagation environment and conduct local channel estimation (CHEST), a process\nknown as probing. The second challenge, termed probe distortion, reflects a\nform of the observer effect: during probing, an HRIS can inadvertently alter\nthe propagation environment, potentially disrupting the operations of other\ncommunicating devices. While implementation complexity has been extensively\nstudied, probe distortion remains largely unexplored. To further assess the\npotential of autonomous RISs, this paper comprehensively and pragmatically\nstudies fundamental trade-offs posed by these challenges. We examine the\nrobustness of an HRIS-assisted massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO)\nsystem under minimal design choices that reflect the essential elements and\nstringent conditions, including (a) two extremes of implementation complexity\nrealized through minimalist operational designs of two HRIS hardware\narchitectures, and (b) an oblivious BS that fully embraces probe distortion. To\nmake our analysis possible, we propose a physical-layer orchestration framework\nthat aligns HRIS and mMIMO operations.

Throughout the last decade, the most\nwidely used pruning paradigm has focused on pruning and re-training, which\nnowadays is inconvenient due to the vast amount of pre-trained models, which\nare in any case too expensive to re-train. In this paper, we exploit functional\ninformation from dense pre-trained models, i.e., their activations, to obtain\nsparse models that maximize the activations' alignment w.r.t. their\ncorresponding dense models. Hence, we propose \\textsc{NeuroAl}, a \\emph{top-up}\nalgorithm that can be used on top of any given pruning algorithm for LLMs, that\nmodifies the block-wise and row-wise sparsity ratios to maximize the\n\\emph{neuron alignment} among activations. Moreover, differently from existing\nmethods, our approach adaptively selects the best parameters for the block-wise\nand row-wise sparsity ratios w.r.t. to the model and the desired sparsity\n(given as input), and requires \\emph{no re-training}.

In addition, while some\nLLMs can locate and repair bugs in certain functions using the related\nartifacts (e.g., test cases), existing methods still depend on statement-level\nfault localization methods to provide a list of buggy hunks for repair.

Based on this\ninsight, we designed D4C, a straightforward prompting framework for APR. D4C\ncan repair 180 bugs correctly in Defects4J, with each patch being sampled only\n10 times.

The consensus mechanism, Proof of Work (PoW), requires miners to\nsolve difficult cryptographic puzzles to add new blocks, while the incentive\nmechanism rewards them with newly minted bitcoins. However, as Bitcoin's\nacceptance grows, it faces increasing threats from attacks targeting these\nmechanisms, such as selfish mining, double-spending, and block withholding.\nThese attacks compromise security, efficiency, and reward distribution. Recent\nresearch shows that these attacks can be combined with each other or with\neither malicious strategies, such as network-layer attacks, or non-malicious\nstrategies, like honest mining. These combinations lead to more sophisticated\nattacks, increasing the attacker's success rates and profitability. Therefore,\nunderstanding and evaluating these attacks is essential for developing\neffective countermeasures and ensuring long-term security.

While existing benchmarks provide general\nevaluations of LLMs, there are no benchmarks that address the practical and\napplied aspects of CTI-specific tasks. To bridge this gap, we introduce\nCTIBench, a benchmark designed to assess LLMs' performance in CTI applications.\nCTIBench includes multiple datasets focused on evaluating knowledge acquired by\nLLMs in the cyber-threat landscape.

The recent rise of Large Language Models (LLMs)\nhave shown potential in this domain, but concerns about their reliability,\naccuracy, and hallucinations persist. While existing benchmarks provide general\nevaluations of LLMs, there are no benchmarks that address the practical and\napplied aspects of CTI-specific tasks. To bridge this gap, we introduce\nCTIBench, a benchmark designed to assess LLMs' performance in CTI applications.\nCTIBench includes multiple datasets focused on evaluating knowledge acquired by\nLLMs in the cyber-threat landscape. Our evaluation of several state-of-the-art\nmodels on these tasks provides insights into their strengths and weaknesses in\nCTI contexts, contributing to a better understanding of LLM capabilities in\nCTI."

One of the most common use cases is conversational interactions,\nenabled by the language generation capabilities of LLMs. Just as between two\nhumans, a conversation between an LLM-powered entity and a human depends on the\npersonality of the conversants. However, measuring the personality of a given\nLLM is currently a challenge. This paper introduces the Language Model\nLinguistic Personality Assessment (LMLPA), a system designed to evaluate the\nlinguistic personalities of LLMs. Our system helps to understand LLMs' language\ngeneration capabilities by quantitatively assessing the distinct personality\ntraits reflected in their linguistic outputs. Unlike traditional human-centric\npsychometrics, the LMLPA adapts a personality assessment questionnaire,\nspecifically the Big Five Inventory, to align with the operational capabilities\nof LLMs, and also incorporates the findings from previous language-based\npersonality measurement literature. To mitigate sensitivity to the order of\noptions, our questionnaire is designed to be open-ended, resulting in textual\nanswers. Thus, the AI rater is needed to transform ambiguous personality\ninformation from text responses into clear numerical indicators of personality\ntraits. Utilising Principal Component Analysis and reliability validations, our\nfindings demonstrate that LLMs possess distinct personality traits that can be\neffectively quantified by the LMLPA. This research contributes to\nHuman-Computer Interaction and Human-Centered AI, providing a robust framework\nfor future studies to refine AI personality assessments and expand their\napplications in multiple areas, including education and manufacturing.",

Instruction tuning refers to the process of further\ntraining LLMs on a dataset consisting of \\textsc{(instruction, output)} pairs\nin a supervised fashion, which bridges the gap between the next-word prediction\nobjective of LLMs and the users' objective of having LLMs adhere to human\ninstructions. In this work, we make a systematic review of the literature,\nincluding the general methodology of IT, the construction of IT datasets, the\ntraining of IT models, and applications to different modalities, domains and\napplication, along with analysis on aspects that influence the outcome of IT\n(e.g., generation of instruction outputs, size of the instruction dataset,\netc). We also review the potential pitfalls of IT along with criticism against\nit, along with efforts pointing out current deficiencies of existing strategies\nand suggest some avenues for fruitful research.Project page:\ngithub.com/xiaoya-li/Instruction-Tuning-Survey",

Our mathematical\ncharacterization shows that Transformer architectures can execute path-finding\nby embedding the adjacency and reachability matrices within their weights.\nFurthermore, our theoretical analysis of gradient-based learning dynamics\nreveals that LLMs can learn both the adjacency and a limited form of the\nreachability matrices.

When applying our methodology to the real-world\nplanning benchmark Blocksworld, our observations remain consistent.\nAdditionally, our analyses uncover a fundamental limitation of current\nTransformer architectures in path-finding: these architectures cannot identify\nreachability relationships through transitivity, which leads to failures in\ngenerating paths when concatenation is required.

In our evaluation, the code\nLLM models trained with two methods have exceeds all current best performing\nmodel which size is much larger."

In a 10-day field study, SSAG\ndemonstrated performance comparable to full script alignment and outperformed\nrule-based chatbots, empirically supporting SSAG as an efficient approach for\naligning LLMs with domain expertise.

The case study shows that\nthe QA algorithm can find the optimal placement of EVCS within seconds. The\nquality of the solutions obtained using QC is not sensitive to the shape or\nsize of the area where EVCS are to be deployed."

As\nLLMs' training sequence length extends to 32k or even 128k, the current\npipeline parallel methods face severe bottlenecks, including high memory\nfootprints and substantial pipeline bubbles, greatly hindering model\nscalability and training throughput. To enhance memory efficiency and training\nthroughput, in this work, we introduce an efficient sequence-level\none-forward-one-backward (1F1B) pipeline scheduling method tailored for\ntraining LLMs on long sequences named Seq1F1B. Seq1F1B decomposes batch-level\nschedulable units into finer sequence-level units, reducing bubble size and\nmemory footprint. Considering that Seq1F1B may produce slight extra bubbles if\nsequences are split evenly, we design a computation-wise strategy to partition\ninput sequences and mitigate this side effect. Compared to competitive pipeline\nbaseline methods such as Megatron 1F1B pipeline parallelism, our method\nachieves higher training throughput with less memory footprint. Notably,\nSeq1F1B efficiently trains a LLM with 30B parameters on sequences up to 64k\nusing 64 NVIDIA A100 GPUs without recomputation strategies, a feat unachievable\nwith existing methods.

Unlike existing works, vTune is able to scale to verification of\nfine-tuning on state-of-the-art LLMs, and can be used both with open-source and\nclosed-source models. We test our approach across several model families and\nsizes as well as across multiple instruction-tuning datasets, and find that the\nstatistical test is satisfied with p-values on the order of $\\sim 10^{-40}$,\nwith no negative impact on downstream task performance. Further, we explore\nseveral attacks that attempt to subvert vTune and demonstrate the method's\nrobustness to these attacks."
