It enables on-demand allocation of GPU memory to mitigate KV\ncache fragmentation -- a phenomenon that crippled the batch size (and\nconsequently throughput) in prior systems. However, in trying to allocate\nphysical memory at runtime, PagedAttention ends up changing the virtual memory\nlayout of the KV cache from contiguous to non-contiguous. Such a design leads\nto non-trivial programming and performance overheads.\n  We present vAttention -- an approach that mitigates fragmentation in physical\nmemory while retaining the contiguity of KV cache in virtual memory. We achieve\nthis by decoupling the allocation of virtual and physical memory using CUDA\nvirtual memory management APIs. We also introduce various LLM-specific\noptimizations to address the limitations of CUDA virtual memory support.\nOverall, vAttention is a simpler, portable, and performant alternative to\nPagedAttention: it supports various attention kernels out-of-the-box and\nimproves LLM serving throughput by up to 1.23x compared to the use of\nPagedAttention-based kernels of FlashAttention and FlashInfer.",

It enables on-demand allocation of GPU memory to mitigate KV\ncache fragmentation -- a phenomenon that crippled the batch size (and\nconsequently throughput) in prior systems. However, in trying to allocate\nphysical memory at runtime, PagedAttention ends up changing the virtual memory\nlayout of the KV cache from contiguous to non-contiguous. Such a design leads\nto non-trivial programming and performance overheads.\n  We present vAttention -- an approach that mitigates fragmentation in physical\nmemory while retaining the contiguity of KV cache in virtual memory. We achieve\nthis by decoupling the allocation of virtual and physical memory using CUDA\nvirtual memory management APIs. We also introduce various LLM-specific\noptimizations to address the limitations of CUDA virtual memory support.\nOverall, vAttention is a simpler, portable, and performant alternative to\nPagedAttention: it supports various attention kernels out-of-the-box and\nimproves LLM serving throughput by up to 1.23x compared to the use of\nPagedAttention-based kernels of FlashAttention and FlashInfer."

Conventionally, this algorithm is combined with a specific\nstochastic gradient strategy, called Robbins-Monro. In this work, we study an\nalternative strategy, Random Reshuffling, and show convincingly that it leads\nto improved performance via: a) a proof of reduced bias in the Wasserstein\nmetric for strongly convex, gradient Lipschitz potentials; b) an analytical\ndemonstration of reduced bias for a Gaussian model problem; and c) an empirical\ndemonstration of reduced bias in numerical experiments for some logistic\nregression problems. This is especially important since Random Reshuffling is\ntypically more efficient due to memory access and cache reasons. Such\nacceleration for the Random Reshuffling policy is familiar from the\noptimisation literature on stochastic gradient descent.",

                    "value": "We examine the use of different randomisation policies for stochastic\ngradient algorithms used in sampling, based on first-order (or overdamped)\nLangevin dynamics, the most popular of which is known as Stochastic Gradient\nLangevin Dynamics. Conventionally, this algorithm is combined with a specific\nstochastic gradient strategy, called Robbins-Monro. In this work, we study an\nalternative strategy, Random Reshuffling, and show convincingly that it leads\nto improved performance via: a) a proof of reduced bias in the Wasserstein\nmetric for strongly convex, gradient Lipschitz potentials; b) an analytical\ndemonstration of reduced bias for a Gaussian model problem; and c) an empirical\ndemonstration of reduced bias in numerical experiments for some logistic\nregression problems. This is especially important since Random Reshuffling is\ntypically more efficient due to memory access and cache reasons. Such\nacceleration for the Random Reshuffling policy is familiar from the\noptimisation literature on stochastic gradient descent."

                "summary": "Registers are the fastest memory components within the GPU's complex memory\nhierarchy, accessed by names rather than addresses. They are managed entirely\nby the compiler through a process called register allocation, during which the\ncompiler attempts to cache predictable data from thread-local memory into\nthread-private registers. Computing the permanent of a sparse matrix poses a\nchallenge for compilers, as optimizing this process is hindered by the\nunpredictable distribution of nonzero elements, which only become known at\nruntime. In this work, we employ fully-automated code generation to address\nthis, producing highly optimized kernels tailored to the matrix's sparsity\npattern. State-of-the-art permanent computation algorithms require each thread\nto store a private array, denoted x, of size n. We first propose a technique\nthat fully stores these arrays in registers, with inclusion and exclusion\nkernels generated for each column. To minimize control divergence and reduce\nthe number of unique kernels within a warp, we exploit the internal structure\nof Gray codes, which are also used in the state-of-the-art algorithm. Our\nsecond technique reduces register pressure by utilizing both registers and\nglobal memory and introduces a matrix ordering and partitioning strategy for\ngreater efficiency. On synthetic matrices, this approach achieves a 31x speedup\nover state-of-the-art CPU implementations on 112 cores, and an 8x speedup\ncompared to our traditional GPU implementation. For real-world matrices, these\nspeedups are 24.9x and 4.9x.",

                    "value": "Registers are the fastest memory components within the GPU's complex memory\nhierarchy, accessed by names rather than addresses. They are managed entirely\nby the compiler through a process called register allocation, during which the\ncompiler attempts to cache predictable data from thread-local memory into\nthread-private registers. Computing the permanent of a sparse matrix poses a\nchallenge for compilers, as optimizing this process is hindered by the\nunpredictable distribution of nonzero elements, which only become known at\nruntime. In this work, we employ fully-automated code generation to address\nthis, producing highly optimized kernels tailored to the matrix's sparsity\npattern. State-of-the-art permanent computation algorithms require each thread\nto store a private array, denoted x, of size n. We first propose a technique\nthat fully stores these arrays in registers, with inclusion and exclusion\nkernels generated for each column. To minimize control divergence and reduce\nthe number of unique kernels within a warp, we exploit the internal structure\nof Gray codes, which are also used in the state-of-the-art algorithm. Our\nsecond technique reduces register pressure by utilizing both registers and\nglobal memory and introduces a matrix ordering and partitioning strategy for\ngreater efficiency. On synthetic matrices, this approach achieves a 31x speedup\nover state-of-the-art CPU implementations on 112 cores, and an 8x speedup\ncompared to our traditional GPU implementation. For real-world matrices, these\nspeedups are 24.9x and 4.9x."

A two-plutonium sources mixture model\n(Palomares and fallout) is used to elucidate the percentage of the plutonium\ncoming from the accident. As a validation exercise of the Pu AMS measuring\ntechnique and in order to obtain the 238Pu/(239+240)Pu activity ratios, samples\nwere also studied by alpha-spectrometry (AS).

Although\nrecent works on linear and sparse attention mechanisms can achieve this goal,\ntheir real-world applicability is often limited by the need to re-train from\nscratch and significantly worse performance. In response, we propose a novel\napproach, Hierarchically Pruned Attention (HiP), which reduces the time\ncomplexity of the attention mechanism to $O(T \\log T)$ and the space complexity\nto $O(T)$, where $T$ is the sequence length. We notice a pattern in the\nattention scores of pretrained LLMs where tokens close together tend to have\nsimilar scores, which we call ``attention locality''.

In\naddition to improving the time complexity of the attention mechanism, we\nfurther optimize GPU memory usage by implementing KV cache offloading, which\nstores only $O(\\log T)$ tokens on the GPU while maintaining similar decoding\nthroughput.

Although low-bit quantization\ntechniques, such as 4-bit quantization, present a potential solution, they\nfrequently lead to significant accuracy degradation or require substantial\neffort for such aggressive quantization approaches. To overcome these\nchallenges, we introduce QRazor, a reliable and effortless quantization scheme\ndesigned to enable 4-bit quantization for weights, activations, and KV cache in\ntransformer-based LLMs. The scheme involves two main stages: quantization and\ncompression. During the quantization stage, weights, activations, and KV cache\nvalues are quantized with wider 8 or 16-bit integers as a basis to achieve\nnearly identical accuracy to the original full-precision LLM models, using the\nabsolute max scaling. Subsequently, all data are compressed to 4-bit using our\nproposed significant data razoring (SDR) technique, which retains only the four\nmost salient bits while discarding the others. Furthermore, we present an\ninteger-based arithmetic unit dedicated to QRazor, enabling direct\nlow-precision arithmetic operations without decompressing the SDR data. Despite\nthe reduced quantization effort, QRazor achieves LLM accuracies better or\ncomparable to state-of-the-art 4-bit methods.

It achieves exceptional performance, ranking 6th overall\non Chatbot Arena, with particularly strong results (2nd to 4th place) in\nspecialized categories including Chinese, Math, Coding, and Hard Prompts.\nYi-Lightning leverages an enhanced Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture,\nfeaturing advanced expert segmentation and routing mechanisms coupled with\noptimized KV-caching techniques. Our development process encompasses\ncomprehensive pre-training, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and reinforcement\nlearning from human feedback (RLHF), where we devise deliberate strategies for\nmulti-stage training, synthetic data construction, and reward modeling.\nFurthermore, we implement RAISE (Responsible AI Safety Engine), a\nfour-component framework to address safety issues across pre-training,\npost-training, and serving phases. Empowered by our scalable super-computing\ninfrastructure, all these innovations substantially reduce training, deployment\nand inference costs while maintaining high-performance standards. With further\nevaluations on public academic benchmarks, Yi-Lightning demonstrates\ncompetitive performance against top-tier LLMs, while we observe a notable\ndisparity between traditional, static benchmark results and real-world, dynamic\nhuman preferences.

However, this MACC network\nhas not yet been studied under multi-antenna settings in the coded caching\nliterature. We study the multi-antenna MACC problem and propose a solution for\nthe same by constructing a pair of arrays called caching and delivery arrays.\nWe present three constructions of caching and delivery arrays for different\nscenarios and obtain corresponding multi-antenna MACC schemes for the same. Two\nschemes resulting from the above constructions achieve optimal performance\nunder uncoded placement and one-shot delivery. The optimality is shown by\nmatching the performance of the multi-antenna MACC scheme to that of an optimal\nmulti-antenna scheme for a dedicated cache network having an identical number\nof users, and each user has a normalized cache size of $rM/N$. Further, as a\nspecial case, one of the proposed schemes subsumes an existing optimal MACC\nscheme for the single-antenna setting.",

Two\nschemes resulting from the above constructions achieve optimal performance\nunder uncoded placement and one-shot delivery. The optimality is shown by\nmatching the performance of the multi-antenna MACC scheme to that of an optimal\nmulti-antenna scheme for a dedicated cache network having an identical number\nof users, and each user has a normalized cache size of $rM/N$. Further, as a\nspecial case, one of the proposed schemes subsumes an existing optimal MACC\nscheme for the single-antenna setting."

To meet the first\nchallenge, existing studies have developed a range of techniques, including\npredicting build outcome and duration, selective build execution, and build\nacceleration using caching or repairing performance smells. The causes of build\nfailures have been the subject of several studies, leading to the development\nof techniques for predicting build script maintenance and automating repair.\nRecent studies have also focused on predicting flaky build failures caused by\nenvironmental issues. The majority of these techniques use machine learning\nalgorithms and leverage build metrics, which we classify into five categories.\nAdditionally, we identify eight publicly available build datasets for build\noptimization research."

In this paper, we propose two\ndistinct coded caching schemes based on coded placement, corresponding to two\ndistinct memory pairs, \\( (M_1, M_2) \\). We show that the proposed schemes\noutperform the existing schemes at these memory points given by the proposed\nschemes for smaller values of $K_2$. In setups where mirrors are positioned\nnear each other, avoiding signal interference is crucial. This can be ensured\nby having all mirrors transmit using orthogonal carrier frequencies. To compare\nour schemes with existing ones, we used the composite rate metric, which\naccurately represents the total bandwidth utilized in such setups. The\ncomposite rate is given by $\\overline{R} = R_1 + K_1 R_2$, where $R_1$ is the\nrate from the server to the mirrors, and $R_2$ is the rate from the mirrors to\nthe users, with respect to $M_1$ and $M_2$.",

However, the CXL-SSD\nfaces performance challenges due to the long flash access latency and\nunpredictable events such as garbage collection in the SSD device, stalling the\nhost processor and wasting compute cycles. Although the CXL interface enables\nthe byte-granular data access to the SSD, accessing flash chips is still at\npage granularity due to physical limitations. The mismatch of access\ngranularity causes significant unnecessary I/O traffic to flash chips,\nworsening the suboptimal end-to-end data access performance. In this paper, we\npresent SkyByte, an efficient CXL-based SSD that employs a holistic approach to\naddress the aforementioned challenges by co-designing the host operating system\n(OS) and SSD controller. To alleviate the long memory stall when accessing the\nCXL-SSD, SkyByte revisits the OS context switch mechanism and enables\nopportunistic context switches upon the detection of long access delays. To\naccommodate byte-granular data accesses, SkyByte architects the internal DRAM\nof the SSD controller into a cacheline-level write log and a page-level data\ncache, and enables data coalescing upon log cleaning to reduce the I/O traffic\nto flash chips. SkyByte also employs optimization techniques that include\nadaptive page migration for exploring the performance benefits of fast host\nmemory by promoting hot pages in CXL-SSD to the host. We implement SkyByte with\na CXL-SSD simulator and evaluate its efficiency with various data-intensive\napplications. Our experiments show that SkyByte outperforms current CXL-based\nSSD by 6.11X, and reduces the I/O traffic to flash chips by 23.08X on average.\nSkyByte also reaches 75% of the performance of the ideal case that assumes\nunlimited DRAM capacity in the host, which offers an attractive cost-effective\nsolution.",

Our findings reveal a strong dependence of\nHfO2 cryogenic performance on the ALD growth temperature, while the latter\nshows a negligible impact on Al2O3. We estimated a ~9 % and ~14 % reduction of\nthe relative permittivity of HfO2 and Al2O3, respectively, from 300 K to 3 K.\nAdditionally, we designed and fabricated Al2O3/HfO2 bilayers and we checked\ntheir properties at cryogenic temperatures.

In this work, we propose LoL-PIM which is a multi-node PIM\narchitecture that accelerates long context LLM through hardware-software\nco-design. In particular, we propose how pipeline parallelism can be exploited\nacross a multi-PIM module while a direct PIM access (DPA) controller (or DMA\nfor PIM) is proposed that enables dynamic PIM memory management and results in\nefficient PIM utilization across a diverse range of context length. We\ndeveloped an MLIR-based compiler for LoL-PIM extending a commercial PIM-based\ncompiler where the software modifications were implemented and evaluated, while\nthe hardware changes were modeled in the simulator. Our evaluations demonstrate\nthat LoL-PIM significantly improves throughput and reduces latency for\nlong-context LLM inference, outperforming both multi-GPU and GPU-PIM systems\n(up to 8.54x and 16.0x speedup, respectively), thereby enabling more efficient\ndeployment of LLMs in real-world applications.",

In particular, we propose how pipeline parallelism can be exploited\nacross a multi-PIM module while a direct PIM access (DPA) controller (or DMA\nfor PIM) is proposed that enables dynamic PIM memory management and results in\nefficient PIM utilization across a diverse range of context length. We\ndeveloped an MLIR-based compiler for LoL-PIM extending a commercial PIM-based\ncompiler where the software modifications were implemented and evaluated, while\nthe hardware changes were modeled in the simulator. Our evaluations demonstrate\nthat LoL-PIM significantly improves throughput and reduces latency for\nlong-context LLM inference, outperforming both multi-GPU and GPU-PIM systems\n(up to 8.54x and 16.0x speedup, respectively), thereby enabling more efficient\ndeployment of LLMs in real-world applications."

Disruptions to this process can lead to serious diseases and\neven death. In this study, we use the vertex model for the cell-level\ndescription of tissue mechanics to investigate the impact of the tissue\nmicroenvironment and local mechanical properties of cells on homeostasis in\nconfined epithelial tissues. We find a dynamic steady state, where the balance\nbetween cell divisions and removals sustains homeostasis. By characterising\nhomeostasis in terms of cell count, tissue area, and the cells' neighbour count\ndistribution, we identify the factors that govern regulated and ordered tissue\ngrowth.

Disruptions to this process can lead to serious diseases and\neven death. In this study, we use the vertex model for the cell-level\ndescription of tissue mechanics to investigate the impact of the tissue\nmicroenvironment and local mechanical properties of cells on homeostasis in\nconfined epithelial tissues. We find a dynamic steady state, where the balance\nbetween cell divisions and removals sustains homeostasis. By characterising\nhomeostasis in terms of cell count, tissue area, and the cells' neighbour count\ndistribution, we identify the factors that govern regulated and ordered tissue\ngrowth. This work, therefore, sheds light on the mechanisms underlying tissue\nhomeostasis and highlights the importance of mechanics in the control of\nbiological processes such as tissue development and disease pathology."

CDNs play a crucial role in reducing\nlatency, enhancing scalability, and optimizing delivery mechanisms, which is\nevident across various platforms and regions. The study focuses on key CDN\nconcerns, such as foundational and modern CDN architectures, edge computing,\nhybrid CDNs, and multi-CDN strategies. It also explores performance-enhancing\ntopics, including caching, load balancing, and the novel features of HTTP/3 and\nQUIC.\n  Current trends, such as integrating CDNs with 5G networks, serverless\narchitectures, and AI-driven traffic management, are examined to demonstrate\nhow CDN technology is likely to evolve. The study also addresses challenges\nrelated to security, cost, and global regulations. Practical examples from the\ne-commerce, streaming, and gaming industries highlight how enhanced CDNs are\ntransforming these sectors.\n  The conclusions emphasize the need to evolve CDN strategies to meet growing\nuser expectations and adapt to the rapidly changing digital landscape.\nAdditionally, the research identifies future research opportunities,\nparticularly in exploring the impact of QC, the enhancement of AI services, and\nthe sustainability of CDN solutions. Overall, the study situates architectural\ndesign, performance strategies, and emerging trends to address gaps and create\na more efficient and secure approach for improving digital experiences.",

                    "value": "This research investigates how CDNs (Content Delivery Networks) can improve\nthe digital experience, as consumers increasingly expect fast, efficient, and\neffortless access to online resources. CDNs play a crucial role in reducing\nlatency, enhancing scalability, and optimizing delivery mechanisms, which is\nevident across various platforms and regions. The study focuses on key CDN\nconcerns, such as foundational and modern CDN architectures, edge computing,\nhybrid CDNs, and multi-CDN strategies. It also explores performance-enhancing\ntopics, including caching, load balancing, and the novel features of HTTP/3 and\nQUIC.\n  Current trends, such as integrating CDNs with 5G networks, serverless\narchitectures, and AI-driven traffic management, are examined to demonstrate\nhow CDN technology is likely to evolve. The study also addresses challenges\nrelated to security, cost, and global regulations. Practical examples from the\ne-commerce, streaming, and gaming industries highlight how enhanced CDNs are\ntransforming these sectors.\n  The conclusions emphasize the need to evolve CDN strategies to meet growing\nuser expectations and adapt to the rapidly changing digital landscape.\nAdditionally, the research identifies future research opportunities,\nparticularly in exploring the impact of QC, the enhancement of AI services, and\nthe sustainability of CDN solutions. Overall, the study situates architectural\ndesign, performance strategies, and emerging trends to address gaps and create\na more efficient and secure approach for improving digital experiences."

To bridge\nthis gap, it becomes essential to incorporate multiple modalities. Models that\ncan seamlessly integrate and reason across these modalities are known as\nfoundation models (FMs). The development of FMs for 2D modalities, such as\nimages and text, has seen significant progress, driven by the abundant\navailability of large-scale datasets.

Prior\nwork uses what we call the Predict-Then-Debias estimator to give valid\nconfidence intervals when machine learning algorithms impute missing variables,\nassuming a small complete sample from the population of interest. We expand the\nscope by introducing bootstrap confidence intervals that apply when the\ncomplete data is a nonuniform (i.e., weighted, stratified, or clustered) sample\nand to settings where an arbitrary subset of features is imputed. Importantly,\nthe method can be applied to many settings without requiring additional\ncalculations. We prove that these confidence intervals are valid under no\nassumptions on the quality of the machine learning model and are no wider than\nthe intervals obtained by methods that do not use machine learning predictions."

We establish key theoretical properties, including\nreversibility, formal connections to Hit-and-Run and Random Walk Metropolis,\nWasserstein contraction comparable to Hit-and-Run in Gaussian targets, and\nbounds on the total variation distance between the transition kernels of\nHit-and-Run and NURS.

Each team provided\na different perspective to the topic of creative AI, substantiated by a set of\nresearch questions as the main subject of their investigation. The 2023 edition\nof ISWS focuses on the intersection of Semantic Web technologies and Creative\nAI. ISWS 2023 explored various intersections between Semantic Web technologies\nand creative AI. A key area of focus was the potential of LLMs as support tools\nfor knowledge engineering. Participants also delved into the multifaceted\napplications of LLMs, including legal aspects of creative content production,\nhumans in the loop, decentralised approaches to multimodal generative AI\nmodels, nanopublications and AI for personal scientific knowledge graphs,\ncommonsense knowledge in automatic story and narrative completion, generative\nAI for art critique, prompt engineering, automatic music composition,\ncommonsense prototyping and conceptual blending, and elicitation of tacit\nknowledge. As Large Language Models and semantic technologies continue to\nevolve, new exciting prospects are emerging: a future where the boundaries\nbetween creative expression and factual knowledge become increasingly permeable\nand porous, leading to a world of knowledge that is both informative and\ninspiring.",

However, LLM's decomposition of questions is unaware of what\ndata is available and how data is organized, often leading to a sub-optimal\nretrieval performance. Recent effort in agentic RAG proposes to perform\nretrieval in an iterative fashion, where a followup query is derived as an\naction based on previous rounds of retrieval. While this provides one way of\ninteracting with the data collection, agentic RAG's exploration of data is\ninefficient because successive queries depend on previous results rather than\nbeing guided by the organization of available data in the collection. To\naddress this problem, we propose an LLM-based retrieval method -- ARM, that\naims to better align the question with the organization of the data collection\nby exploring relationships among data objects beyond matching the utterance of\nthe query, thus leading to a retrieve-all-at-once solution for complex queries.\nWe evaluated ARM on two datasets, Bird and OTT-QA. On Bird, it outperforms\nstandard RAG with query decomposition by up to 5.2 pt in execution accuracy and\nagentic RAG (ReAct) by up to 15.9 pt.

Recently, steering LLMs towards a desired behavior via activation\nediting has emerged as an effective method to mitigate harmful generations at\ninference-time. Activation editing modifies LLM representations by preserving\ninformation from positive demonstrations (e.g., truthful) and minimising\ninformation from negative demonstrations (e.g., hallucinations). When these\ndemonstrations come from a private dataset, the aligned LLM may leak private\ninformation contained in those private samples. In this work, we present the\nfirst study of aligning LLM behavior with private datasets. Our work proposes\nthe \\textit{\\underline{P}rivate \\underline{S}teering for LLM\n\\underline{A}lignment (PSA)} algorithm to edit LLM activations with\ndifferential privacy (DP) guarantees. We conduct extensive experiments on seven\ndifferent benchmarks with open-source LLMs of different sizes (0.5B to 7B) and\nmodel families (LlaMa, Qwen, Mistral and Gemma). Our results show that PSA\nachieves DP guarantees for LLM alignment with minimal loss in performance,\nincluding alignment metrics, open-ended text generation quality, and\ngeneral-purpose reasoning. We also develop the first Membership Inference\nAttack (MIA) for evaluating and auditing the empirical privacy for the problem\nof LLM steering via activation editing. Our attack is tailored for activation\nediting and relies solely on the generated texts without their associated\nprobabilities. Our experiments support the theoretical guarantees by showing\nimproved guarantees for our \\textit{PSA} algorithm compared to several existing\nnon-private techniques.",

However, in these methods, communication\nacross workers still requires the same peak bandwidth as before, as the\nsynchronizations require all parameters to be exchanged across all workers. In\nthis paper, we improve DiLoCo in three ways. First, we synchronize only subsets\nof parameters in sequence, rather than all at once, which greatly reduces peak\nbandwidth. Second, we allow workers to continue training while synchronizing,\nwhich decreases wall clock time. Third, we quantize the data exchanged by\nworkers, which further reduces bandwidth across workers. By properly combining\nthese modifications, we show experimentally that we can distribute training of\nbillion-scale parameters and reach similar quality as before, but reducing\nrequired bandwidth by two orders of magnitude.",

In\nthis paper, we improve DiLoCo in three ways. First, we synchronize only subsets\nof parameters in sequence, rather than all at once, which greatly reduces peak\nbandwidth. Second, we allow workers to continue training while synchronizing,\nwhich decreases wall clock time. Third, we quantize the data exchanged by\nworkers, which further reduces bandwidth across workers. By properly combining\nthese modifications, we show experimentally that we can distribute training of\nbillion-scale parameters and reach similar quality as before, but reducing\nrequired bandwidth by two orders of magnitude."

While we\ncontinue to find that the mass distribution of a binary's more massive\ncomponent strongly decreases as a function of primary mass, we observe no\nevidence of a strongly suppressed merger rate above approximately $60\\,M_\\odot$\n[abridged]"

Our approach\nfocuses on minimizing the layer-wise discrepancy between the original LLM and\nits quantized counterpart with LoRA components during initialization. By\nleveraging a small calibration dataset, CLoQ quantizes a pre-trained LLM and\ndetermines the optimal LoRA components for each layer, ensuring a strong\nfoundation for subsequent fine-tuning. A key contribution of this work is a\nnovel theoretical result that enables the accurate and closed-form construction\nof these optimal LoRA components. We validate the efficacy of CLoQ across\nmultiple tasks such as language generation, arithmetic reasoning, and\ncommonsense reasoning, demonstrating that it consistently outperforms existing\nLoRA fine-tuning methods for quantized LLMs, especially at ultra low-bit\nwidths."

To\naddress this, we explore the Cross-Lingual Self-Aligning ability of Language\nModels (CALM) to align knowledge across languages. Specifically, for a given\nquestion, we sample multiple responses across different languages, and select\nthe most self-consistent response as the target, leaving the remaining\nresponses as negative examples. We then employ direct preference optimization\n(DPO) to align the model's knowledge across different languages. Evaluations on\nthe MEDQA and X-CSQA datasets demonstrate CALM's effectiveness in enhancing\ncross-lingual knowledge question answering, both in zero-shot and retrieval\naugmented settings. We also found that increasing the number of languages\ninvolved in CALM training leads to even higher accuracy and consistency.

To\naddress this, we explore the Cross-Lingual Self-Aligning ability of Language\nModels (CALM) to align knowledge across languages. Specifically, for a given\nquestion, we sample multiple responses across different languages, and select\nthe most self-consistent response as the target, leaving the remaining\nresponses as negative examples. We then employ direct preference optimization\n(DPO) to align the model's knowledge across different languages. Evaluations on\nthe MEDQA and X-CSQA datasets demonstrate CALM's effectiveness in enhancing\ncross-lingual knowledge question answering, both in zero-shot and retrieval\naugmented settings. We also found that increasing the number of languages\ninvolved in CALM training leads to even higher accuracy and consistency. We\noffer a qualitative analysis of how cross-lingual consistency can enhance\nknowledge alignment and explore the method's generalizability.

                "summary": "The irruption of DeepSeek-R1 constitutes a turning point for the AI industry\nin general and the LLMs in particular. Its capabilities have demonstrated\noutstanding performance in several tasks, including creative thinking, code\ngeneration, maths and automated program repair, at apparently lower execution\ncost. However, LLMs must adhere to an important qualitative property, i.e.,\ntheir alignment with safety and human values. A clear competitor of DeepSeek-R1\nis its American counterpart, OpenAI's o3-mini model, which is expected to set\nhigh standards in terms of performance, safety and cost. In this paper we\nconduct a systematic assessment of the safety level of both, DeepSeek-R1 (70b\nversion) and OpenAI's o3-mini (beta version). To this end, we make use of our\nrecently released automated safety testing tool, named ASTRAL. By leveraging\nthis tool, we automatically and systematically generate and execute a total of\n1260 unsafe test inputs on both models. After conducting a semi-automated\nassessment of the outcomes provided by both LLMs, the results indicate that\nDeepSeek-R1 is highly unsafe as compared to OpenAI's o3-mini. Based on our\nevaluation, DeepSeek-R1 answered unsafely to 11.98% of the executed prompts\nwhereas o3-mini only to 1.19%.",

(2)\nModel Depth Pruning: A block importance analysis technique for efficient model\ncompression to arbitrary sizes with minimal quality loss. (3) Inference-time\nScaling: A repeated sampling strategy that trades computation for model\ncapacity, enabling smaller models to match larger model quality at inference\ntime. Through these strategies, SANA-1.5 achieves a text-image alignment score\nof 0.72 on GenEval, which can be further improved to 0.80 through inference\nscaling, establishing a new SoTA on GenEval benchmark. These innovations enable\nefficient model scaling across different compute budgets while maintaining high\nquality, making high-quality image generation more accessible.",

However, their high\nsensitivity also makes them susceptible to background noise, which can obscure\nthese signals. This noise often includes transient artifacts called \"glitches\"\nthat can mimic astrophysical signals or mask their characteristics. Fast and\naccurate reconstruction of both signals and glitches is crucial for reliable\nscientific inference. In this study, we present DeepExtractor, a deep learning\nframework designed to reconstruct signals and glitches with power exceeding\ninterferometer noise, regardless of their source. We design DeepExtractor to\nmodel the inherent noise distribution of GW interferometers, following\nconventional assumptions that the noise is Gaussian and stationary over short\ntime scales. It operates by predicting and subtracting the noise component of\nthe data, retaining only the clean reconstruction. Our approach achieves\nsuperior generalization capabilities for arbitrary signals and glitches\ncompared to methods that directly map inputs to the clean training waveforms.\nWe validate DeepExtractor's effectiveness through three experiments: (1)\nreconstructing simulated glitches injected into simulated detector noise, (2)\ncomparing performance with the state-of-the-art BayesWave algorithm, and (3)\nanalyzing real data from the Gravity Spy dataset to demonstrate effective\nglitch subtraction from LIGO strain data. DeepExtractor achieves a median\nmismatch of only 0.9% for simulated glitches, outperforming several deep\nlearning baselines. Additionally, DeepExtractor surpasses BayesWave in glitch\nrecovery, offering a dramatic computational speedup by reconstructing one\nglitch sample in approx. 0.1 seconds on a CPU, compared to BayesWave's\nprocessing time of approx. one hour per glitch.",

To this end, we propose a data fusion model\nwhich is primarily motivated by the problem of sparsity in the observational\ndata and the use of a numerical prediction model as an additional data source\nin order to obtain better predictions for the variables of interest. The\nproposed data fusion model assumes that the different data sources are\nerror-prone realizations of a common latent process. The outcomes from the\nweather stations follow the classical error model while the outcomes of the\nnumerical weather prediction model involves a constant multiplicative bias\nparameter and an additive bias which is spatially-structured and time-varying.\nWe use a Bayesian model averaging approach with the integrated nested Laplace\napproximation (INLA) for doing inference. The proposed data fusion model\noutperforms the stations-only model and the regression calibration approach,\nwhen assessed using leave-group-out cross-validation (LGOCV). We assess the\nbenefits of data fusion and evaluate the accuracy of predictions and parameter\nestimation through a simulation study. The results show that the proposed data\nfusion model generally gives better predictions compared to the stations-only\napproach especially with sparse observational data.",

                    "value": "This work aims to combine two primary meteorological data sources in the\nPhilippines: data from a sparse network of weather stations and outcomes of a\nnumerical weather prediction model. To this end, we propose a data fusion model\nwhich is primarily motivated by the problem of sparsity in the observational\ndata and the use of a numerical prediction model as an additional data source\nin order to obtain better predictions for the variables of interest. The\nproposed data fusion model assumes that the different data sources are\nerror-prone realizations of a common latent process. The outcomes from the\nweather stations follow the classical error model while the outcomes of the\nnumerical weather prediction model involves a constant multiplicative bias\nparameter and an additive bias which is spatially-structured and time-varying.\nWe use a Bayesian model averaging approach with the integrated nested Laplace\napproximation (INLA) for doing inference. The proposed data fusion model\noutperforms the stations-only model and the regression calibration approach,\nwhen assessed using leave-group-out cross-validation (LGOCV). We assess the\nbenefits of data fusion and evaluate the accuracy of predictions and parameter\nestimation through a simulation study. The results show that the proposed data\nfusion model generally gives better predictions compared to the stations-only\napproach especially with sparse observational data."

We confirm 17 of these for a total of 23\ndetections in our analysis of the Hanford-Livingston coincident O3b data. We\nidentify candidates using a search pipeline employing aligned-spin\nquadrupole-only waveforms. Our pipeline is similar to the one used in our O3a\ncoincident analysis [2], except for a few improvements in the veto procedure\nand the ranking statistic, and we continue to use an astrophysical probability\nof one half as our detection threshold, following the approach of the LVK\ncatalogs. Most of the new candidates reported in this work are placed in the\nupper and lower-mass gap of the black hole (BH) mass distribution. We also\nidentify a possible neutron star-black hole (NSBH) merger. We expect these\nevents to help inform the black hole mass and spin distributions inferred in a\nfull population analysis.",

Dependency-aware\ntoken encoding introduces a structured approach to embedding initialization,\nensuring that relational constraints are embedded within token representations\nrather than inferred solely through attention dynamics. The proposed encoding\nmechanism refines token interactions through dependency-weighted attention\ncomputations, ensuring that syntactic and semantic dependencies are retained\nacross multiple processing layers.

During training, the data from each\nmodality is routed to its dedicated modules: modality-specific feedforward\nlayers, query-key-value projections, and normalization layers process each\nmodality independently, while the shared self-attention layers allow\ninteractions across text and image features. By freezing the text-specific\nmodules and only training the image-specific modules, LMFusion preserves the\nlanguage capabilities of text-only LLMs while developing strong visual\nunderstanding and generation abilities. Compared to methods that pretrain\nmultimodal generative models from scratch, our experiments demonstrate that,\nLMFusion improves image understanding by 20% and image generation by 3.6% using\nonly 50% of the FLOPs while maintaining Llama-3's language capabilities. We\nalso demonstrate that this framework can adapt existing vision-language models\nwith multimodal generation ability. Overall, this framework not only leverages\nexisting computational investments in text-only LLMs but also enables the\nparallel development of language and vision capabilities, presenting a\npromising direction for efficient multimodal model development.",

During training, the data from each\nmodality is routed to its dedicated modules: modality-specific feedforward\nlayers, query-key-value projections, and normalization layers process each\nmodality independently, while the shared self-attention layers allow\ninteractions across text and image features. By freezing the text-specific\nmodules and only training the image-specific modules, LMFusion preserves the\nlanguage capabilities of text-only LLMs while developing strong visual\nunderstanding and generation abilities. Compared to methods that pretrain\nmultimodal generative models from scratch, our experiments demonstrate that,\nLMFusion improves image understanding by 20% and image generation by 3.6% using\nonly 50% of the FLOPs while maintaining Llama-3's language capabilities. We\nalso demonstrate that this framework can adapt existing vision-language models\nwith multimodal generation ability. Overall, this framework not only leverages\nexisting computational investments in text-only LLMs but also enables the\nparallel development of language and vision capabilities, presenting a\npromising direction for efficient multimodal model development."

While such multimodal solutions\nfrequently lead to improvements in performance and may even be critical in\ncertain cases, they come with several constraints such as increased sensory\nrequirements, computational cost, and modality synchronization, to mention a\nfew. These challenges constrain the direct uses of these multimodal solutions\nin real-world applications. In this work, we develop approaches where the\nlearning happens with all available modalities but the deployment or inference\nis done with just one or reduced modalities. To do so, we propose a Multimodal\nTraining and Unimodal Deployment (MUTUD) framework which includes a Temporally\nAligned Modality feature Estimation (TAME) module that can estimate information\nfrom missing modality using modalities present during inference. This\ninnovative approach facilitates the integration of information across different\nmodalities, enhancing the overall inference process by leveraging the strengths\nof each modality to compensate for the absence of certain modalities during\ninference. We apply MUTUD to various audiovisual speech tasks and show that it\ncan reduce the performance gap between the multimodal and corresponding\nunimodal models to a considerable extent. MUTUD can achieve this while reducing\nthe model size and compute compared to multimodal models, in some cases by\nalmost 80%.",

While such multimodal solutions\nfrequently lead to improvements in performance and may even be critical in\ncertain cases, they come with several constraints such as increased sensory\nrequirements, computational cost, and modality synchronization, to mention a\nfew. These challenges constrain the direct uses of these multimodal solutions\nin real-world applications. In this work, we develop approaches where the\nlearning happens with all available modalities but the deployment or inference\nis done with just one or reduced modalities. To do so, we propose a Multimodal\nTraining and Unimodal Deployment (MUTUD) framework which includes a Temporally\nAligned Modality feature Estimation (TAME) module that can estimate information\nfrom missing modality using modalities present during inference. This\ninnovative approach facilitates the integration of information across different\nmodalities, enhancing the overall inference process by leveraging the strengths\nof each modality to compensate for the absence of certain modalities during\ninference. We apply MUTUD to various audiovisual speech tasks and show that it\ncan reduce the performance gap between the multimodal and corresponding\nunimodal models to a considerable extent. MUTUD can achieve this while reducing\nthe model size and compute compared to multimodal models, in some cases by\nalmost 80%."

This document\nreports a collaborative effort performed by ten teams of students, each guided\nby a senior researcher as their mentor, attending ISWS 2023. Each team provided\na different perspective to the topic of creative AI, substantiated by a set of\nresearch questions as the main subject of their investigation. The 2023 edition\nof ISWS focuses on the intersection of Semantic Web technologies and Creative\nAI. ISWS 2023 explored various intersections between Semantic Web technologies\nand creative AI. A key area of focus was the potential of LLMs as support tools\nfor knowledge engineering. Participants also delved into the multifaceted\napplications of LLMs, including legal aspects of creative content production,\nhumans in the loop, decentralised approaches to multimodal generative AI\nmodels, nanopublications and AI for personal scientific knowledge graphs,\ncommonsense knowledge in automatic story and narrative completion, generative\nAI for art critique, prompt engineering, automatic music composition,\ncommonsense prototyping and conceptual blending, and elicitation of tacit\nknowledge. As Large Language Models and semantic technologies continue to\nevolve, new exciting prospects are emerging: a future where the boundaries\nbetween creative expression and factual knowledge become increasingly permeable\nand porous, leading to a world of knowledge that is both informative and\ninspiring.",

However, LLM's decomposition of questions is unaware of what\ndata is available and how data is organized, often leading to a sub-optimal\nretrieval performance. Recent effort in agentic RAG proposes to perform\nretrieval in an iterative fashion, where a followup query is derived as an\naction based on previous rounds of retrieval.

Since internal states and\nparameter gradients need to be exchanged at each and every single gradient\nstep, all devices need to be co-located using low-latency high-bandwidth\ncommunication links to support the required high volume of exchanged bits.\nRecently, distributed algorithms like DiLoCo have relaxed such co-location\nconstraint: accelerators can be grouped into ``workers'', where\nsynchronizations between workers only occur infrequently. This in turn means\nthat workers can afford being connected by lower bandwidth communication links\nwithout affecting learning quality. However, in these methods, communication\nacross workers still requires the same peak bandwidth as before, as the\nsynchronizations require all parameters to be exchanged across all workers. In\nthis paper, we improve DiLoCo in three ways. First, we synchronize only subsets\nof parameters in sequence, rather than all at once, which greatly reduces peak\nbandwidth. Second, we allow workers to continue training while synchronizing,\nwhich decreases wall clock time. Third, we quantize the data exchanged by\nworkers, which further reduces bandwidth across workers.

We introduce\nCue Learning using Evolution for Accurate Recognition (CLEAR), which uses a\ncombination of LLMs and evolutionary computation to generate and optimize cues\nsuch that recognition of specialized features in images is improved. It\nachieves this by auto-generating a novel domain-specific representation and\nthen using it to optimize suitable textual cues with a genetic algorithm.

Here, we introduce a neuromorphic optical flow approach that\naddresses delay bottlenecks by encoding temporal information directly in a\nsynaptic transistor array to assist spatial motion analysis. Compared to\nconventional spatial-only optical flow methods, our spatiotemporal neuromorphic\noptical flow offers the spatial-temporal consistency of motion information,\nrapidly identifying regions of interest in as little as 1-2 ms using the\ntemporal motion cues derived from the embedded temporal information in the\ntwo-dimensional floating gate synaptic transistors. Thus, the visual input can\nbe selectively filtered to achieve faster velocity calculations and various\ntask execution. At the hardware level, due to the atomically sharp interfaces\nbetween distinct functional layers in two-dimensional van der Waals\nheterostructures, the synaptic transistor offers high-frequency response (~100\n{\\mu}s), robust non-volatility (>10000 s), and excellent endurance (>8000\ncycles), enabling robust visual processing. In software benchmarks, our system\noutperforms state-of-the-art algorithms with a 400% speedup, frequently\nsurpassing human-level performance while maintaining or enhancing accuracy by\nutilizing the temporal priors provided by the embedded temporal information.",

                    "value": "Optical flow, inspired by the mechanisms of biological visual systems,\ncalculates spatial motion vectors within visual scenes that are necessary for\nenabling robotics to excel in complex and dynamic working environments.\nHowever, current optical flow algorithms, despite human-competitive task\nperformance on benchmark datasets, remain constrained by unacceptable time\ndelays (~0.6 seconds per inference, 4X human processing speed) in practical\ndeployment. Here, we introduce a neuromorphic optical flow approach that\naddresses delay bottlenecks by encoding temporal information directly in a\nsynaptic transistor array to assist spatial motion analysis. Compared to\nconventional spatial-only optical flow methods, our spatiotemporal neuromorphic\noptical flow offers the spatial-temporal consistency of motion information,\nrapidly identifying regions of interest in as little as 1-2 ms using the\ntemporal motion cues derived from the embedded temporal information in the\ntwo-dimensional floating gate synaptic transistors. Thus, the visual input can\nbe selectively filtered to achieve faster velocity calculations and various\ntask execution. At the hardware level, due to the atomically sharp interfaces\nbetween distinct functional layers in two-dimensional van der Waals\nheterostructures, the synaptic transistor offers high-frequency response (~100\n{\\mu}s), robust non-volatility (>10000 s), and excellent endurance (>8000\ncycles), enabling robust visual processing. In software benchmarks, our system\noutperforms state-of-the-art algorithms with a 400% speedup, frequently\nsurpassing human-level performance while maintaining or enhancing accuracy by\nutilizing the temporal priors provided by the embedded temporal information."

The second utilizes a Power Hardware in the Loop\nmethodology with a benchmark CIGRE grid model.The results reveal that while\ntesting with an ideal voltage source is cost-effective and convenient in the\nshort term, it lacks the ability to capture the dynamic interactions and\nfeedback loops of physical grid components.This limitation can obscure critical\nreal world factors, potentially leading to unexpected inverter behavior and\noperational challenges in grids with high PV penetration.This study underscores\nthe importance of re-evaluating conventional testing methods and incorporating\nPower Hardware in the Loop structures to achieve test results that more closely\nalign with real-world conditions.",

                    "value": "The deployment of PV inverters is rapidly expanding across Europe, where\nthese devices must increasingly comply with stringent grid requirements.This\nstudy presents a benchmark analysis of four PV inverter manufacturers, focusing\non their Fault Ride Through capabilities under varying grid strengths, voltage\ndips, and fault durations, parameters critical for grid operators during fault\nconditions.The findings highlight the influence of different inverter controls\non key metrics such as total harmonic distortion of current and voltage\nsignals, as well as system stability following grid faults.Additionally, the\nstudy evaluates transient stability using two distinct testing approaches.The\nfirst approach employs the current standard method, which is testing with an\nideal voltage source. The second utilizes a Power Hardware in the Loop\nmethodology with a benchmark CIGRE grid model.The results reveal that while\ntesting with an ideal voltage source is cost-effective and convenient in the\nshort term, it lacks the ability to capture the dynamic interactions and\nfeedback loops of physical grid components.This limitation can obscure critical\nreal world factors, potentially leading to unexpected inverter behavior and\noperational challenges in grids with high PV penetration.This study underscores\nthe importance of re-evaluating conventional testing methods and incorporating\nPower Hardware in the Loop structures to achieve test results that more closely\nalign with real-world conditions."

Recently, deep learning-based compression\ntechniques have demonstrated superior performance across various data types,\nincluding CSI. However, these approaches often experience performance\ndegradation when the data distribution changes due to their limited\ngeneralization capabilities. To address this challenge, we propose a model\nfine-tuning approach for CSI feedback in massive MIMO systems. The idea is to\nfine-tune the encoder/decoder network models in a dynamic fashion using the\nrecent CSI samples. First, we explore encoder-only fine-tuning, where only the\nencoder parameters are updated, leaving the decoder and latent parameters\nunchanged. Next, we consider full-model fine-tuning, where the encoder and\ndecoder models are jointly updated. Unlike encoder-only fine-tuning, full-model\nfine-tuning requires the updated decoder and latent parameters to be\ntransmitted to the decoder side. To efficiently handle this, we propose\ndifferent prior distributions for model updates, such as uniform and truncated\nGaussian to entropy code them together with the compressed CSI and account for\nadditional feedback overhead imposed by conveying the model updates. Moreover,\nwe incorporate quantized model updates during fine-tuning to reflect the impact\nof quantization in the deployment phase. Our results demonstrate that\nfull-model fine-tuning significantly enhances the rate-distortion (RD)\nperformance of neural CSI compression.

Compared to methods that pretrain\nmultimodal generative models from scratch, our experiments demonstrate that,\nLMFusion improves image understanding by 20% and image generation by 3.6% using\nonly 50% of the FLOPs while maintaining Llama-3's language capabilities. We\nalso demonstrate that this framework can adapt existing vision-language models\nwith multimodal generation ability. Overall, this framework not only leverages\nexisting computational investments in text-only LLMs but also enables the\nparallel development of language and vision capabilities, presenting a\npromising direction for efficient multimodal model development."

These challenges constrain the direct uses of these multimodal solutions\nin real-world applications. In this work, we develop approaches where the\nlearning happens with all available modalities but the deployment or inference\nis done with just one or reduced modalities. To do so, we propose a Multimodal\nTraining and Unimodal Deployment (MUTUD) framework which includes a Temporally\nAligned Modality feature Estimation (TAME) module that can estimate information\nfrom missing modality using modalities present during inference. This\ninnovative approach facilitates the integration of information across different\nmodalities, enhancing the overall inference process by leveraging the strengths\nof each modality to compensate for the absence of certain modalities during\ninference. We apply MUTUD to various audiovisual speech tasks and show that it\ncan reduce the performance gap between the multimodal and corresponding\nunimodal models to a considerable extent. MUTUD can achieve this while reducing\nthe model size and compute compared to multimodal models, in some cases by\nalmost 80%.",

To do so, we propose a Multimodal\nTraining and Unimodal Deployment (MUTUD) framework which includes a Temporally\nAligned Modality feature Estimation (TAME) module that can estimate information\nfrom missing modality using modalities present during inference. This\ninnovative approach facilitates the integration of information across different\nmodalities, enhancing the overall inference process by leveraging the strengths\nof each modality to compensate for the absence of certain modalities during\ninference. We apply MUTUD to various audiovisual speech tasks and show that it\ncan reduce the performance gap between the multimodal and corresponding\nunimodal models to a considerable extent. MUTUD can achieve this while reducing\nthe model size and compute compared to multimodal models, in some cases by\nalmost 80%."

While informative, the adherence of these approaches to\nrelatively superficial constructs tends to oversimplify the complexity and\nnuance underlying everyday moral dilemmas. We argue that auditing LLMs along\nmore detailed axes of human interaction is of paramount importance to better\nassess the degree to which they may impact human beliefs and actions. To this\nend, we evaluate LLMs on complex, everyday moral dilemmas sourced from the \"Am\nI the Asshole\" (AITA) community on Reddit, where users seek moral judgments on\neveryday conflicts from other community members. We prompted seven LLMs to\nassign blame and provide explanations for over 10,000 AITA moral dilemmas. We\nthen compared the LLMs' judgments and explanations to those of Redditors and to\neach other, aiming to uncover patterns in their moral reasoning. Our results\ndemonstrate that large language models exhibit distinct patterns of moral\njudgment, varying substantially from human evaluations on the AITA subreddit.\nLLMs demonstrate moderate to high self-consistency but low inter-model\nagreement. Further analysis of model explanations reveals distinct patterns in\nhow models invoke various moral principles. These findings highlight the\ncomplexity of implementing consistent moral reasoning in artificial systems and\nthe need for careful evaluation of how different models approach ethical\njudgment.

Second, we consider the evaluation of emerging LLM-based\ngenerative information retrieval (GenIR) systems, including retrieval augmented\ngeneration (RAG) systems. We consider approaches that focus both on the\nend-to-end evaluation of GenIR systems and on the evaluation of a retrieval\ncomponent as an element in a RAG system. Going forward, we expect the\nevaluation of GenIR systems to be at least partially based on LLM-based\nassessment, creating an apparent circularity, with a system seemingly\nevaluating its own output. We resolve this apparent circularity in two ways: 1)\nby viewing LLM-based assessment as a form of \"slow search\", where a slower IR\nsystem is used for evaluation and training of a faster production IR system;\nand 2) by recognizing a continuing need to ground evaluation in human\nassessment, even if the characteristics of that human assessment must change.",

Going forward, we expect the\nevaluation of GenIR systems to be at least partially based on LLM-based\nassessment, creating an apparent circularity, with a system seemingly\nevaluating its own output. We resolve this apparent circularity in two ways: 1)\nby viewing LLM-based assessment as a form of \"slow search\", where a slower IR\nsystem is used for evaluation and training of a faster production IR system;\nand 2) by recognizing a continuing need to ground evaluation in human\nassessment, even if the characteristics of that human assessment must change."
