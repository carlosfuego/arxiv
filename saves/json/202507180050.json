In addition, the\nperformance of a graph-based ANNS algorithm is highly sensitive to parameters,\nwhile selecting the optimal parameters is cost-prohibitive, e.g., manual tuning\nrequires repeatedly re-building the index. This paper introduces VSAG, an\nopen-source framework that aims to enhance the in production performance of\ngraph-based ANNS algorithms. VSAG has been deployed at scale in the services of\nAnt Group, and it incorporates three key optimizations: (i) efficient memory\naccess: it reduces L3 cache misses with pre-fetching and cache-friendly vector\norganization; (ii) automated parameter tuning: it automatically selects\nperformance-optimal parameters without requiring index rebuilding; (iii)\nefficient distance computation: it leverages modern hardware, scalar\nquantization, and smartly switches to low-precision representation to\ndramatically reduce the distance computation costs. We evaluate VSAG on\nreal-world datasets. The experimental results show that VSAG achieves the\nstate-of-the-art performance and provides up to 4x speedup over HNSWlib (an\nindustry-standard library) while ensuring the same accuracy.",

Kernel-native\ndistributed file systems supply raw speed, but their privileged code base\ncouples every release to the kernel, widens the blast radius of crashes, and\nslows innovation. FUSE-based distributed file systems flip those trade-offs:\nthey run in user space for fast deployment and strong fault isolation, yet the\nFUSE interface disables the kernel's write-back page cache whenever strong\nconsistency is required. Practitioners must therefore choose between (i) weak\nconsistency with fast write-back caching or (ii) strong consistency with slow\nwrite-through I/O, an limitation that has kept FUSE distributed file systems\nout of write-intensive cloud workloads.\n  To this end, We present DistFUSE, the first distributed FUSE file system that\ndelivers write-back kernel caching and strong consistency. DistFUSE achieves\nthis by offloading userspace consistency control to the kernel driver, allowing\ncoordinated access to the kernel's page cache across nodes. This design\neliminates blind local cache updates and ensures cluster-wide strong\nconsistency without compromising performance. In our evaluation, DistFUSE\nachieves up to 68.0% higher throughput and 40.4% lower latency than the\nexisting write-through design of FUSE-based distributed file system.",

FUSE-based distributed file systems flip those trade-offs:\nthey run in user space for fast deployment and strong fault isolation, yet the\nFUSE interface disables the kernel's write-back page cache whenever strong\nconsistency is required. Practitioners must therefore choose between (i) weak\nconsistency with fast write-back caching or (ii) strong consistency with slow\nwrite-through I/O, an limitation that has kept FUSE distributed file systems\nout of write-intensive cloud workloads.\n  To this end, We present DistFUSE, the first distributed FUSE file system that\ndelivers write-back kernel caching and strong consistency. DistFUSE achieves\nthis by offloading userspace consistency control to the kernel driver, allowing\ncoordinated access to the kernel's page cache across nodes. This design\neliminates blind local cache updates and ensures cluster-wide strong\nconsistency without compromising performance. In our evaluation, DistFUSE\nachieves up to 68.0% higher throughput and 40.4% lower latency than the\nexisting write-through design of FUSE-based distributed file system."

Caching techniques, which leverage data reuse to reduce\ncomputation, offer opportunities to optimize the performance of LLM inference\nengines. On the one hand, the low-level key-value (KV) cache working at the\ntoken level is widely adopted, albeit it incurs significant overhead as request\nvolume grows. On the other hand, instruction-level caching, which stores full\ninstruction-response pairs, is expected to play an increasingly crucial role.\nHowever, the high variability in the content and length of instructions make it\nrare for identical instructions to recur within a short time window, presenting\nchallenges for effective caching instruction-response pairs. To address this\nchallenge, we propose InstCache, a predictive caching mechanism for LLM serving\nsystems. Leveraging the capability of LLMs, we can effectively reorder the\nrepresentation space of instruction texts and develop a sufficient level of\nspatial locality. Such spatial locality enables us to predict potential\ninstructions located in a compact region in the space, resulting in an\neffective caching system at runtime. Experimental results demonstrate that\nInstCache achieves a 2.3x higher hit rate compared to the upper bound of\ntraditional caching mechanisms on WildChat dataset and reduces the time per\noutput token of vLLM by up to 42.0% and 50.0% on LMSys and Moss datasets,\nrespectively.",

Efficient Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is\ncrucial to address these issues. However, unlike traditional models, diffusion\nmodels critically rely on the time-step for the multi-round denoising.\nTypically, each time-step is encoded into a hypersensitive temporal feature by\nseveral modules. Despite this, existing PTQ methods do not optimize these\nmodules individually. Instead, they employ unsuitable reconstruction objectives\nand complex calibration methods, leading to significant disturbances in the\ntemporal feature and denoising trajectory, as well as reduced compression\nefficiency. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel quantization\nframework that includes three strategies: 1) TIB-based Maintenance: Based on\nour innovative Temporal Information Block (TIB) definition, Temporal\nInformation-aware Reconstruction (TIAR) and Finite Set Calibration (FSC) are\ndeveloped to efficiently align original temporal features. 2) Cache-based\nMaintenance: Instead of indirect and complex optimization for the related\nmodules, pre-computing and caching quantized counterparts of temporal features\nare developed to minimize errors. 3) Disturbance-aware Selection: Employ\ntemporal feature errors to guide a fine-grained selection between the two\nmaintenance strategies for further disturbance reduction.

This optimization reduces cold-start time when booting\nand loading dependencies at runtime inside a function container. Previous\nresearch has extensively focused on reducing cold-start latency for specific\nfunctions. However, little attention has been given to skewed production\nworkloads. In such cases, cross-function optimization becomes essential.\nWithout cross-function optimization, a cloud provider is left with two equally\npoor options: (i) Either the cloud provider gives up optimization for each\nfunction in the long tail (which is slow); or (ii) the cloud provider applies\nfunction-specific optimizations (e.g., cache function images) to every function\nin the long tail (which violates the vendor's cache constraints). HotSwap\ndemonstrates cross-function optimization using a novel pre-warming strategy. In\nthis strategy, a pre-initialized live dependency image is migrated to the new\nfunction instance. At the same time, HotSwap respects the provider's cache\nconstraints, because a single pre-warmed dependency image in the cache can be\nshared among all serverless functions that require that image. HotSwap has been\ntested on seven representative functions from FunctionBench. In those tests,\nHotSwap accelerates dependency loading for those serverless functions with\nlarge dependency requirements by a factor ranging from 2.2 to 3.2.

One approach to achieving a large\nelectrocaloric response is to exploit the substantial polarization change\nassociated with the first-order phase transition at the Curie temperature.\nFollowing this strategy, we investigated the electrocaloric response of\n(1$-x$)BaTiO$_3$-$x$Na$_{0.5}$Bi$_{0.5}$TiO$_3$ (BT-NBT) ceramics for x = 0.05,\n0.10, 0.20, and 0.30. In this BT-rich region of the solid solution, it is\nestablished that increasing the NBT content enhances the tetragonality of\nBaTiO$_3$. We show that this increase in tetragonality helps maintain the\nfirst-order nature of the phase transition and enables a correspondingly large\nelectrocaloric response, despite the simultaneous enhancement of relaxor\nferroelectric character with NBT substitution. A significantly large effective\nelectrocaloric temperature change ($\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{eff}}$) of ~1.65 K was\nobtained for the x = 0.20 composition under an applied field of 40 kV/cm using\ndirect electrocaloric measurements, in reasonable agreement with the indirect\nresults.",

One approach to achieving a large\nelectrocaloric response is to exploit the substantial polarization change\nassociated with the first-order phase transition at the Curie temperature.\nFollowing this strategy, we investigated the electrocaloric response of\n(1$-x$)BaTiO$_3$-$x$Na$_{0.5}$Bi$_{0.5}$TiO$_3$ (BT-NBT) ceramics for x = 0.05,\n0.10, 0.20, and 0.30. In this BT-rich region of the solid solution, it is\nestablished that increasing the NBT content enhances the tetragonality of\nBaTiO$_3$. We show that this increase in tetragonality helps maintain the\nfirst-order nature of the phase transition and enables a correspondingly large\nelectrocaloric response, despite the simultaneous enhancement of relaxor\nferroelectric character with NBT substitution. A significantly large effective\nelectrocaloric temperature change ($\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{eff}}$) of ~1.65 K was\nobtained for the x = 0.20 composition under an applied field of 40 kV/cm using\ndirect electrocaloric measurements, in reasonable agreement with the indirect\nresults."

For example, the Disk Access Machine\n(DAM) model assumes that a storage device transfers data in fixed-size blocks\nof size B and that all transfers have unit latency. This abstraction is already\nsufficient to explain some of the benefits of data structures such as B-trees\nand Log-Structured Merge trees (LSM trees); however, storage technology\nadvances have significantly reduced current models' accuracy and utility.\n  This paper introduces the Multi-Queue Solid State Drive (MQSSD) model, a new\nstorage abstraction. This model builds upon previous models and aims to more\naccurately represent the performance characteristics of modern storage\nhardware. We identify key performance-critical aspects of modern multi-queue\nsolid-state drives on which we base our model and demonstrate these\ncharacteristics on actual hardware. We then show how our model can be applied\nto LSM-tree-based storage engines to optimize them for modern storage hardware.\nWe highlight that leveraging concurrent access is crucial for fully utilizing\nthe high throughput of multi-queue SSDs, enabling designs that may appear\ncounterintuitive under traditional paradigms We then validate these insights\nthrough experiments using Facebook's LSM-tree-based key-value store, RocksDB.\nWe conclude that the MQSSD model offers a more accurate abstraction of modern\nhardware than previous models, allowing for greater insight and optimization.",

                    "value": "Understanding the performance profiles of storage devices and how best to\nutilize them has always been non-trivial due to factors such as seek times,\ncaching, scheduling, concurrent access, flash wear-out, and garbage collection.\nHowever, analytical frameworks that provide simplified abstractions of storage\nperformance can still be accurate enough to evaluate external memory algorithms\nand data structures at the design stage. For example, the Disk Access Machine\n(DAM) model assumes that a storage device transfers data in fixed-size blocks\nof size B and that all transfers have unit latency. This abstraction is already\nsufficient to explain some of the benefits of data structures such as B-trees\nand Log-Structured Merge trees (LSM trees); however, storage technology\nadvances have significantly reduced current models' accuracy and utility.\n  This paper introduces the Multi-Queue Solid State Drive (MQSSD) model, a new\nstorage abstraction. This model builds upon previous models and aims to more\naccurately represent the performance characteristics of modern storage\nhardware. We identify key performance-critical aspects of modern multi-queue\nsolid-state drives on which we base our model and demonstrate these\ncharacteristics on actual hardware. We then show how our model can be applied\nto LSM-tree-based storage engines to optimize them for modern storage hardware.\nWe highlight that leveraging concurrent access is crucial for fully utilizing\nthe high throughput of multi-queue SSDs, enabling designs that may appear\ncounterintuitive under traditional paradigms We then validate these insights\nthrough experiments using Facebook's LSM-tree-based key-value store, RocksDB.\nWe conclude that the MQSSD model offers a more accurate abstraction of modern\nhardware than previous models, allowing for greater insight and optimization."

In this work,\nrather than following prevalent approaches such as linear attention (or SSMs)\nand local attention, we introduce an intermediate design called \\rat between\nrecurrence and attention mechanisms. It partitions the input into chunks,\napplies a simple linear recurrence within each chunk to capture local\ndependencies, and then performs softmax attention across chunks to model\nlong-range interactions. By adjusting the size of the chunk, \\rat enables\nflexible trade-offs, combining the strengths of RNN and attention. Empirically,\nwith a chunk size of 16, the \\rat layer achieves a \\(7\\times\\) improvement in\ntraining speed with 100K token sequences and \\(9\\times\\) in generation at 4K\nsequence length, while maintaining similar or sometimes even better accuracy\ncompared to standard attention. We demonstrate this by training 1.3B parameter\nmodels from scratch and performing large-scale evaluations, including short-\nand long-context benchmarks, as well as supervised fine-tuning~(SFT). We\nfurther propose a hybrid architecture that interleaves \\rat with local\nattention. By combining efficient long-range modeling with strong local\ninteractions, this hybrid design not only improves inference speed and reduces\ncache memory usage compared to attention, but also consistently enhances\nperformance, for example, achieving an average 1 point gain in commonsense\nreasoning tasks, up to 4 points on code tasks, and a 1 point Rouge-L increase\nin a summarization SFT task.

In this\nwork, we investigate how MLLMs process visual inputs by analyzing their\nattention mechanisms. We reveal a surprising sparsity phenomenon: only a small\nsubset (approximately less than 5%) of attention heads in LLMs actively\ncontribute to visual understanding, termed visual heads. To identify these\nheads efficiently, we design a training-free framework that quantifies\nhead-level visual relevance through targeted response analysis. Building on\nthis discovery, we introduce SparseMM, a KV-Cache optimization strategy that\nallocates asymmetric computation budgets to heads in LLMs based on their visual\nscores, leveraging the sparity of visual heads for accelerating the inference\nof MLLMs. Compared with prior KV-Cache acceleration methods that ignore the\nparticularity of visual, SparseMM prioritizes stress and retaining visual\nsemantics during decoding. Extensive evaluations across mainstream multimodal\nbenchmarks demonstrate that SparseMM achieves superior accuracy-efficiency\ntrade-offs. Notably, SparseMM delivers 1.38x real-time acceleration and 52%\nmemory reduction during generation while maintaining performance parity on\nefficiency test.

We\nshow that CAOTE, when combined with the state-of-the-art attention score-based\nmethods, always improves accuracies on the downstream task, indicating the\nimportance of leveraging information from values during token eviction process."

                "summary": "Speculative decoding generally dictates having a small, efficient draft model\nthat is either pretrained or distilled offline to a particular target model\nseries, for instance, Llama or Qwen models. However, within online deployment\nsettings, there are two major challenges: 1) usage of a target model that is\nincompatible with the draft model; 2) expectation of latency improvements over\nusage and time. In this work, we propose OmniDraft, a unified framework that\nenables a single draft model to operate with any target model and adapt\ndynamically to user data. We introduce an online n-gram cache with hybrid\ndistillation fine-tuning to address the cross-vocabulary mismatch across draft\nand target models; and further improve decoding speed by leveraging adaptive\ndrafting techniques. OmniDraft is particularly suitable for on-device LLM\napplications where model cost, efficiency and user customization are the major\npoints of contention. This further highlights the need to tackle the above\nchallenges and motivates the \\textit{``one drafter for all''} paradigm. We\nshowcase the proficiency of the OmniDraft framework by performing online\nlearning on math reasoning, coding and text generation tasks. Notably,\nOmniDraft enables a single Llama-68M model to pair with various target models\nincluding Vicuna-7B, Qwen2-7B and Llama3-8B models for speculative decoding;\nand additionally provides up to 1.5-2x speedup.",

                    "value": "Speculative decoding generally dictates having a small, efficient draft model\nthat is either pretrained or distilled offline to a particular target model\nseries, for instance, Llama or Qwen models. However, within online deployment\nsettings, there are two major challenges: 1) usage of a target model that is\nincompatible with the draft model; 2) expectation of latency improvements over\nusage and time. In this work, we propose OmniDraft, a unified framework that\nenables a single draft model to operate with any target model and adapt\ndynamically to user data. We introduce an online n-gram cache with hybrid\ndistillation fine-tuning to address the cross-vocabulary mismatch across draft\nand target models; and further improve decoding speed by leveraging adaptive\ndrafting techniques. OmniDraft is particularly suitable for on-device LLM\napplications where model cost, efficiency and user customization are the major\npoints of contention. This further highlights the need to tackle the above\nchallenges and motivates the \\textit{``one drafter for all''} paradigm. We\nshowcase the proficiency of the OmniDraft framework by performing online\nlearning on math reasoning, coding and text generation tasks. Notably,\nOmniDraft enables a single Llama-68M model to pair with various target models\nincluding Vicuna-7B, Qwen2-7B and Llama3-8B models for speculative decoding;\nand additionally provides up to 1.5-2x speedup."

Often, the learned component is shared between mutually-distrusting\nusers or processes, much like microarchitectural resources such as caches,\npotentially giving rise to highly-realistic attacker models. However, compared\nto attacks on other ML-based systems, attackers face a level of indirection as\nthey cannot interact directly with the learned model. Additionally, the\ndifference between the attack surface of learned and non-learned versions of\nthe same system is often subtle. These factors obfuscate the de-facto risks\nthat the incorporation of ML carries. We analyze the root causes of\npotentially-increased attack surface in learned database systems and develop a\nframework for identifying vulnerabilities that stem from the use of ML. We\napply our framework to a broad set of learned components currently being\nexplored in the database community. To empirically validate the vulnerabilities\nsurfaced by our framework, we choose 3 of them and implement and evaluate\nexploits against these. We show that the use of ML cause leakage of past\nqueries in a database, enable a poisoning attack that causes exponential memory\nblowup in an index structure and crashes it in seconds, and enable index users\nto snoop on each others' key distributions by timing queries over their own\nkeys. We find that adversarial ML is an universal threat against learned\ncomponents in database systems, point to open research gaps in our\nunderstanding of learned-systems security, and conclude by discussing\nmitigations, while noting that data leakage is inherent in systems whose\nlearned component is shared between multiple parties.",

Fine-tuning LLMs with\nparameter-efficient adapters, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), enables these\nmodels to efficiently adapt to downstream tasks without extensive retraining.\nDeploying fine-tuned LLMs on multi-tenant edge devices offers substantial\nbenefits, such as reduced latency, enhanced privacy, and personalized\nresponses. However, serving LLMs efficiently on resource-constrained edge\ndevices presents critical challenges, including the complexity of adapter\nselection for different tasks and memory overhead from frequent adapter\nswapping.

This paper introduces EdgeLoRA, an efficient\nsystem for serving LLMs on edge devices in multi-tenant environments.

Comprehensive\nevaluations using the Llama3.1-8B model demonstrate that EdgeLoRA significantly\noutperforms the status quo (i.e., llama.cpp) in terms of both latency and\nthroughput. The results demonstrate that EdgeLoRA can achieve up to a 4 times\nboost in throughput. Even more impressively, it can serve several orders of\nmagnitude more adapters simultaneously.

In this paper, we present LeoAM, the\nfirst efficient importance-aware long-context LLM inference system for a single\ncommodity GPU with adaptive hierarchical GPU-CPU-Disk KV management.

Moreover, we propose a lightweight KV abstract method, which\nminimizes transmission latency by storing and extracting the KV abstract of\neach chunk on disk instead of the full KV data. LeoAM also leverages the\ndynamic compression and pipeline techniques to further accelerate inference.\nExperimental results demonstrate that LongInfer achieves an average inference\nlatency speedup of 3.46x, while maintaining comparable LLM response quality.

A central server housing\na library of files populates both private and access caches using uncoded\nplacement. In this work, we focus on a constrained indexing regime, referred to\nas the intersection class, in which the sets used to index the demands of each\nuser must have a nonempty intersection. This regime models resource-limited IoT\nscenarios such as edge-assisted IoT systems, where devices with small private\ncaches connect to a small number of shared caches. We provide a necessary and\nsufficient condition under which the system parameters fall within this\nintersection class.

A central server housing\na library of files populates both private and access caches using uncoded\nplacement. In this work, we focus on a constrained indexing regime, referred to\nas the intersection class, in which the sets used to index the demands of each\nuser must have a nonempty intersection. This regime models resource-limited IoT\nscenarios such as edge-assisted IoT systems, where devices with small private\ncaches connect to a small number of shared caches.

Proposed in the literature bioinspired\nneuromorphic Time-Difference Encoder (TDE-2) combines event-based sensors and\nprocessors with spiking neural networks to provide real-time and\nenergy-efficient motion detection through extracting temporal correlations\nbetween two points in space. However, on the algorithmic level, this design\nleads to loss of direction-selectivity of individual TDEs in textured\nenvironments. Here we propose an augmented 3-point TDE (TDE-3) with additional\ninhibitory input that makes TDE-3 direction-selectivity robust in textured\nenvironments. We developed a procedure to train the new TDE-3 using\nbackpropagation through time and surrogate gradients to linearly map input\nvelocities into an output spike count or an Inter-Spike Interval (ISI). Our\nwork is the first instance of training a spiking neuron to have a specific ISI.\nUsing synthetic data we compared training and inference with spike count and\nISI with respect to changes in stimuli dynamic range, spatial frequency, and\nlevel of noise. ISI turns out to be more robust towards variation in spatial\nfrequency, whereas the spike count is a more reliable training signal in the\npresence of noise. We performed the first in-depth quantitative investigation\nof optical flow coding with TDE and compared TDE-2 vs TDE-3 in terms of\nenergy-efficiency and coding precision. Results show that on the network level\nboth detectors show similar precision (20 degree angular error, 88% correlation\nwith ground truth). Yet, due to the more robust direction-selectivity of\nindividual TDEs, TDE-3 based network spike less and hence is more\nenergy-efficient. Reported precision is on par with model-based methods but the\nspike-based processing of the TDEs provides allows more energy-efficient\ninference with neuromorphic hardware.",

The hierarchical model yielded a significantly lower and more precise\nbranching factor estimate mean (0.742 +- 0.026) than the pooled model (0.899 +-\n0.015) and narrower intervals than the unpooled model (0.717 +- 0.139). This\nled to a threefold smaller cascade of events per onset under the hierarchical\nmodel. Sensitivity analyses confirmed robustness to prior and likelihood\nperturbations while the unpooled model showed instability for sparse\nindividuals.

In this work, we propose NOCTA, a Non-Greedy Objective Cost-Tradeoff\nAcquisition method that sequentially acquires the most informative features at\ninference time while accounting for both temporal dynamics and acquisition\ncost. We first introduce a cohesive estimation target for our NOCTA setting,\nand then develop two complementary estimators: 1) a non-parametric method based\non nearest neighbors to guide the acquisition (NOCTA-NP), and 2) a parametric\nmethod that directly predicts the utility of potential acquisitions (NOCTA-P).\nExperiments on synthetic and real-world medical datasets demonstrate that both\nNOCTA variants outperform existing baselines.",

These findings suggest\nthat eukaryotic gene regulation has evolved to balance precision with reaction\nrate and energy dissipation constraints, favoring non-equilibrium architectures\nfor optimal information transmission."

However, achieving visually coherent\nestimation for mobile AR is challenging due to several key limitations in AR\ndevice sensing capabilities, including low camera FoV and limited pixel dynamic\nranges. Recent advancements in generative AI, which can generate high-quality\nimages from different types of prompts, including texts and images, present a\npotential solution for high-quality lighting estimation. Still, to effectively\nuse generative image diffusion models, we must address two key limitations of\ncontent quality and slow inference. In this work, we design and implement a\ngenerative lighting estimation system called CleAR that can produce\nhigh-quality, diverse environment maps in the format of 360{\\deg} HDR images.\nSpecifically, we design a two-step generation pipeline guided by AR environment\ncontext data to ensure the output aligns with the physical environment's visual\ncontext and color appearance. To improve the estimation robustness under\ndifferent lighting conditions, we design a real-time refinement component to\nadjust lighting estimation results on AR devices. Through a combination of\nquantitative and qualitative evaluations, we show that CleAR outperforms\nstate-of-the-art lighting estimation methods on both estimation accuracy,\nlatency, and robustness, and is rated by 31 participants as producing better\nrenderings for most virtual objects. For example, CleAR achieves 51% to 56%\naccuracy improvement on virtual object renderings across objects of three\ndistinctive types of materials and reflective properties.

To\naddress this, we introduce GitChameleon, a novel, meticulously curated dataset\ncomprising 328 Python code completion problems, each conditioned on specific\nlibrary versions and accompanied by executable unit tests. GitChameleon\nrigorously evaluates the capacity of contemporary large language models (LLMs),\nLLM-powered agents, code assistants, and RAG systems to perform\nversion-conditioned code generation that demonstrates functional accuracy\nthrough execution. Our extensive evaluations indicate that state-of-the-art\nsystems encounter significant challenges with this task; enterprise models\nachieving baseline success rates in the 48-51\\% range, underscoring the\nintricacy of the problem. By offering an execution-based benchmark emphasizing\nthe dynamic nature of code libraries, GitChameleon enables a clearer\nunderstanding of this challenge and helps guide the development of more\nadaptable and dependable AI code generation methods.

To\naddress this, we introduce GitChameleon, a novel, meticulously curated dataset\ncomprising 328 Python code completion problems, each conditioned on specific\nlibrary versions and accompanied by executable unit tests. GitChameleon\nrigorously evaluates the capacity of contemporary large language models (LLMs),\nLLM-powered agents, code assistants, and RAG systems to perform\nversion-conditioned code generation that demonstrates functional accuracy\nthrough execution. Our extensive evaluations indicate that state-of-the-art\nsystems encounter significant challenges with this task; enterprise models\nachieving baseline success rates in the 48-51\\% range, underscoring the\nintricacy of the problem. By offering an execution-based benchmark emphasizing\nthe dynamic nature of code libraries, GitChameleon enables a clearer\nunderstanding of this challenge and helps guide the development of more\nadaptable and dependable AI code generation methods. We make the dataset and\nevaluation code publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/mrcabbage972/GitChameleonBenchmark."

Traditional post-hoc interpretation methods,\nbased on attention and gradient-based analysis, offer limited insights as they\nonly approximate the model's decision-making processes and have been proved to\nbe unreliable. For this reason, Concept-Bottleneck Models (CBMs) have been\nlately proposed in the textual field to provide interpretable predictions based\non human-understandable concepts. However, CBMs still exhibit several\nlimitations due to their architectural constraints limiting their expressivity,\nto the absence of task-interpretability when employing non-linear task\npredictors and for requiring extensive annotations that are impractical for\nreal-world text data. In this paper, we address these challenges by proposing a\nnovel Linearly Interpretable Concept Embedding Model (LICEM) going beyond the\ncurrent accuracy-interpretability trade-off. LICEMs classification accuracy is\nbetter than existing interpretable models and matches black-box ones. We show\nthat the explanations provided by our models are more interveneable and\ncausally consistent with respect to existing solutions. Finally, we show that\nLICEMs can be trained without requiring any concept supervision, as concepts\ncan be automatically predicted when using an LLM backbone.",

For this reason, Concept-Bottleneck Models (CBMs) have been\nlately proposed in the textual field to provide interpretable predictions based\non human-understandable concepts. However, CBMs still exhibit several\nlimitations due to their architectural constraints limiting their expressivity,\nto the absence of task-interpretability when employing non-linear task\npredictors and for requiring extensive annotations that are impractical for\nreal-world text data. In this paper, we address these challenges by proposing a\nnovel Linearly Interpretable Concept Embedding Model (LICEM) going beyond the\ncurrent accuracy-interpretability trade-off. LICEMs classification accuracy is\nbetter than existing interpretable models and matches black-box ones. We show\nthat the explanations provided by our models are more interveneable and\ncausally consistent with respect to existing solutions. Finally, we show that\nLICEMs can be trained without requiring any concept supervision, as concepts\ncan be automatically predicted when using an LLM backbone."

This paper\npresents the design, implementation, and evaluation of the autonomous museum\nguide robot Alter-Ego equipped with advanced navigation and interactive\ncapabilities. The robot leverages state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs)\nto provide real-time, context aware question-and-answer (Q&A) interactions,\nallowing visitors to engage in conversations about exhibits. It also employs\nrobust simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) techniques, enabling\nseamless navigation through museum spaces and route adaptation based on user\nrequests. The system was tested in a real museum environment with 34\nparticipants, combining qualitative analysis of visitor-robot conversations and\nquantitative analysis of pre and post interaction surveys. Results showed that\nthe robot was generally well-received and contributed to an engaging museum\nexperience, despite some limitations in comprehension and responsiveness. This\nstudy sheds light on HRI in cultural spaces, highlighting not only the\npotential of AI-driven robotics to support accessibility and knowledge\nacquisition, but also the current limitations and challenges of deploying such\ntechnologies in complex, real-world environments.",

Conversely, Electroencephalogram (EEG)\nprovides millisecond-scale temporal precision (<=1 ms sampling rate) for\nreal-time guidance of continuous task execution, albeit constrained by low\nspatial resolution.

Our research investigates the relationship\nbetween the uncertainty in training dynamics and the emergence of\nhallucinations. Using models from the Pythia suite and several hallucination\ndetection metrics, we analyze hallucination trends and identify significant\nvariance during training. To address this, we propose \\textbf{Sensitivity\nDropout (SenD)}, a novel training protocol designed to reduce hallucination\nvariance during training by deterministically dropping embedding indices with\nsignificant variability. In addition, we develop an unsupervised hallucination\ndetection metric, Efficient EigenScore (EES), which approximates the\ntraditional EigenScore in 2x speed. This metric is integrated into our training\nprotocol, allowing SenD to be both computationally scalable and effective at\nreducing hallucination variance. SenD improves test-time reliability of Pythia\nand Meta's Llama models by up to 17\\% and enhances factual accuracy in\nWikipedia, Medical, Legal, and Coding domains without affecting downstream task\nperformance.",

In this work, we\napply a quantum metrology tool - the quantum Fisher information - to the\nsqueezed quantum state describing cosmological perturbations at the end of\ninflation. This quantifies the ultimate precision achievable in parameter\nestimation, assuming ideal access to early-universe information. By comparing\nthe quantum Fisher information to its classical counterpart - derived from\nmeasurements of the curvature perturbation power spectrum alone (homodyne\nmeasurement) - we evaluate how close current observations come to this quantum\nlimit. Focusing on the tensor-to-scalar ratio as a case study, we find that the\ngap between classical and quantum Fisher information grows exponentially with\nthe number of e-folds a mode spends outside the horizon. This suggests the\nexistence of a highly efficient (but presently inaccessible) optimal\nmeasurement. Conversely, we show that accessing the decaying mode of\ninflationary perturbations is a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for\nexponentially improving the inference of the tensor-to-scalar ratio.",

In this work, we\napply a quantum metrology tool - the quantum Fisher information - to the\nsqueezed quantum state describing cosmological perturbations at the end of\ninflation. This quantifies the ultimate precision achievable in parameter\nestimation, assuming ideal access to early-universe information. By comparing\nthe quantum Fisher information to its classical counterpart - derived from\nmeasurements of the curvature perturbation power spectrum alone (homodyne\nmeasurement) - we evaluate how close current observations come to this quantum\nlimit. Focusing on the tensor-to-scalar ratio as a case study, we find that the\ngap between classical and quantum Fisher information grows exponentially with\nthe number of e-folds a mode spends outside the horizon. This suggests the\nexistence of a highly efficient (but presently inaccessible) optimal\nmeasurement. Conversely, we show that accessing the decaying mode of\ninflationary perturbations is a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for\nexponentially improving the inference of the tensor-to-scalar ratio."

Intelligent roadside infrastructure perception systems, installed at\nelevated vantage points, can provide wide, unobstructed intersection coverage,\nsupplying a complementary information stream to autonomous vehicles via\nvehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication. However, conventional 3D\nobject-detection algorithms struggle to generalize under the domain shift\nintroduced by top-down perspectives and steep camera angles. We introduce a\n2.5D object detection framework, tailored specifically for infrastructure\nroadside-mounted cameras. Unlike conventional 2D or 3D object detection, we\nemploy a prediction approach to detect ground planes of vehicles as\nparallelograms in the image frame. The parallelogram preserves the planar\nposition, size, and orientation of objects while omitting their height, which\nis unnecessary for most downstream applications. For training, a mix of\nreal-world and synthetically generated scenes is leveraged. We evaluate\ngeneralizability on a held-out camera viewpoint and in adverse-weather\nscenarios absent from the training set. Our results show high detection\naccuracy, strong cross-viewpoint generalization, and robustness to diverse\nlighting and weather conditions.

However, challenges remain,\nincluding finding optimal initialization strategies or mitigating\noverparametrization in low-rank matrix factorization. In this work, we propose\na novel approach that addresses both of the challenges simultaneously within a\nunified framework. Our method treats a set of fixed-rank LoRA matrices as a\nsmooth manifold.

                    "value": "Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has become a widely adopted standard for\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs), significantly\nreducing memory and computational demands. However, challenges remain,\nincluding finding optimal initialization strategies or mitigating\noverparametrization in low-rank matrix factorization. In this work, we propose\na novel approach that addresses both of the challenges simultaneously within a\nunified framework. Our method treats a set of fixed-rank LoRA matrices as a\nsmooth manifold.

We validated the two\nsets of catalogues by analysing number densities, power spectra, and 2-point\ncorrelation functions, showing that the Flagship spectroscopic catalogue is\nconsistent with being one of the realisations of the simulated sets, although\nwe noticed small deviations limited to the quadrupole at k>0.2 h/Mpc. We show\ncosmological parameter inference from these catalogues and demonstrate that\nusing one realisation of EuclidLargeMocks in place of the Flagship mock\nproduces the same posteriors, to within the expected shift given by sample\nvariance.

We show\ncosmological parameter inference from these catalogues and demonstrate that\nusing one realisation of EuclidLargeMocks in place of the Flagship mock\nproduces the same posteriors, to within the expected shift given by sample\nvariance. These simulated skies will be used for the galaxy clustering analysis\nof Euclid's Data Release 1 (DR1)."

Despite\nachieving state-of-the-art performance on major benchmarks, Transformers remain\ncomputationally expensive, particularly with dense video data. To address this,\nwe propose a lightweight Video Focal Modulation Network, DVFL-Net, which\ndistills spatiotemporal knowledge from a large pre-trained teacher into a\ncompact nano student model, enabling efficient on-device deployment. DVFL-Net\nutilizes knowledge distillation and spatial-temporal feature modulation to\nsignificantly reduce computation while preserving high recognition performance.\nWe employ forward Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence alongside spatio-temporal\nfocal modulation to effectively transfer both local and global context from the\nVideo-FocalNet Base (teacher) to the proposed VFL-Net (student). We evaluate\nDVFL-Net on UCF50, UCF101, HMDB51, SSV2, and Kinetics-400, benchmarking it\nagainst recent state-of-the-art methods in Human Action Recognition (HAR).\nAdditionally, we conduct a detailed ablation study analyzing the impact of\nforward KL divergence.

However,\nprevailing on-policy RL methods often contend with significant training\ninstability and inefficiency. This is primarily due to a capacity-difficulty\nmismatch, where the complexity of training data frequently outpaces the model's\ncurrent capabilities, leading to critically sparse reward signals and stalled\nlearning progress. This challenge is particularly acute for smaller, more\nresource-efficient LLMs. To overcome this, we introduce the Guided Hybrid\nPolicy Optimization (GHPO), a novel difficulty-aware reinforcement learning\nframework. GHPO dynamically calibrates task difficulty by employing adaptive\nprompt refinement to provide targeted guidance. This unique approach adaptively\nbalances direct imitation learning for problems currently beyond the model's\nreach with exploration-based reinforcement learning for more manageable tasks,\neffectively creating a smooth and optimized learning curriculum. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that GHPO achieves an average performance gain of\napproximately 5% across six challenging mathematics benchmarks, consistently\noutperforming strong on-policy reinforcement learning and curriculum learning\nbaselines. Further analysis confirms that our framework significantly enhances\nboth training stability and final reasoning performance, thus offering a\nscalable and efficient solution for developing powerful and robust reasoning\nmodels.",

Traditional post-hoc interpretation methods,\nbased on attention and gradient-based analysis, offer limited insights as they\nonly approximate the model's decision-making processes and have been proved to\nbe unreliable. For this reason, Concept-Bottleneck Models (CBMs) have been\nlately proposed in the textual field to provide interpretable predictions based\non human-understandable concepts. However, CBMs still exhibit several\nlimitations due to their architectural constraints limiting their expressivity,\nto the absence of task-interpretability when employing non-linear task\npredictors and for requiring extensive annotations that are impractical for\nreal-world text data. In this paper, we address these challenges by proposing a\nnovel Linearly Interpretable Concept Embedding Model (LICEM) going beyond the\ncurrent accuracy-interpretability trade-off. LICEMs classification accuracy is\nbetter than existing interpretable models and matches black-box ones. We show\nthat the explanations provided by our models are more interveneable and\ncausally consistent with respect to existing solutions. Finally, we show that\nLICEMs can be trained without requiring any concept supervision, as concepts\ncan be automatically predicted when using an LLM backbone.",

In this paper, we address these challenges by proposing a\nnovel Linearly Interpretable Concept Embedding Model (LICEM) going beyond the\ncurrent accuracy-interpretability trade-off. LICEMs classification accuracy is\nbetter than existing interpretable models and matches black-box ones. We show\nthat the explanations provided by our models are more interveneable and\ncausally consistent with respect to existing solutions. Finally, we show that\nLICEMs can be trained without requiring any concept supervision, as concepts\ncan be automatically predicted when using an LLM backbone."

                "summary": "Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease affecting 35% of\nextremely low birth weight infants. Defined by oxygen dependence at 36 weeks\npostmenstrual age, it causes lifelong respiratory complications. However,\npreventive interventions carry severe risks, including neurodevelopmental\nimpairment, ventilator-induced lung injury, and systemic complications.\nTherefore, early BPD prognosis and prediction of BPD outcome is crucial to\navoid unnecessary toxicity in low risk infants. Admission radiographs of\nextremely preterm infants are routinely acquired within 24h of life and could\nserve as a non-invasive prognostic tool. In this work, we developed and\ninvestigated a deep learning approach using chest X-rays from 163 extremely\nlow-birth-weight infants ($\\leq$32 weeks gestation, 401-999g) obtained within\n24 hours of birth. We fine-tuned a ResNet-50 pretrained specifically on adult\nchest radiographs, employing progressive layer freezing with discriminative\nlearning rates to prevent overfitting and evaluated a CutMix augmentation and\nlinear probing. For moderate/severe BPD outcome prediction, our best performing\nmodel with progressive freezing, linear probing and CutMix achieved an AUROC of\n0.78 $\\pm$ 0.10, balanced accuracy of 0.69 $\\pm$ 0.10, and an F1-score of 0.67\n$\\pm$ 0.11. In-domain pre-training significantly outperformed ImageNet\ninitialization (p = 0.031) which confirms domain-specific pretraining to be\nimportant for BPD outcome prediction. Routine IRDS grades showed limited\nprognostic value (AUROC 0.57 $\\pm$ 0.11), confirming the need of learned\nmarkers. Our approach demonstrates that domain-specific pretraining enables\naccurate BPD prediction from routine day-1 radiographs. Through progressive\nfreezing and linear probing, the method remains computationally feasible for\nsite-level implementation and future federated learning deployments.",

We formalise the abstraction\nin the eXchange Calculus (XC), a core functional language based on neighbouring\nvalues (maps from neighbours to values) where state and interaction is handled\nthrough a single primitive, exchange, and provide a corresponding\nimplementation in the FCPP language. Then, we exercise distributed collective\nprocesses using two case studies: multi-hop message propagation and distributed\nmonitoring of spatial properties. Finally, we discuss the features of the\nabstraction and its suitability for different kinds of distributed computing\napplications."

In\nthis study, we investigate the potential of current LLMs to enhance call-graph\nanalysis and type inference for Python and JavaScript programs. We empirically\nevaluated 24 LLMs, including OpenAI's GPT series and open-source models like\nLLaMA and Mistral, using existing and newly developed benchmarks. Specifically,\nwe enhanced TypeEvalPy, a micro-benchmarking framework for type inference in\nPython, with auto-generation capabilities, expanding its scope from 860 to\n77,268 type annotations for Python. Additionally, we introduced SWARM-CG and\nSWARM-JS, comprehensive benchmarking suites for evaluating call-graph\nconstruction tools across multiple programming languages.\n  Our findings reveal a contrasting performance of LLMs in static analysis\ntasks. For call-graph generation, traditional static analysis tools such as\nPyCG for Python and Jelly for JavaScript consistently outperform LLMs. While\nadvanced models like mistral-large-it-2407-123b and gpt-4o show promise, they\nstill struggle with completeness and soundness in call-graph analysis across\nboth languages. In contrast, LLMs demonstrate a clear advantage in type\ninference for Python, surpassing traditional tools like HeaderGen and hybrid\napproaches such as HiTyper. These results suggest that, while LLMs hold promise\nin type inference, their limitations in call-graph analysis highlight the need\nfor further research.

                "summary": "Game playing has long served as a fundamental benchmark for evaluating\nArtificial General Intelligence (AGI). While Large Language Models (LLMs) have\ndemonstrated impressive capabilities in general reasoning, their effectiveness\nin spatial strategic reasoning, which is critical for complex and fully\nobservable board games, remains insufficiently explored. In this work, we adopt\nChinese Chess (Xiangqi) as a challenging and rich testbed due to its intricate\nrules and spatial complexity. To advance LLMs' strategic competence in such\nenvironments, we propose a training framework tailored to Xiangqi, built upon a\nlarge-scale dataset of five million board-move pairs enhanced with expert\nannotations and engine evaluations. Building on this foundation, we introduce\nXiangqi-R1, a 7B-parameter model trained in multi-stage manner: (1) fine-tuning\nfor legal move prediction to capture basic spatial rules, (2) incorporating\nstrategic annotations to improve decision-making, and (3) applying\nreinforcement learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with\nmulti-dimensional reward signals to enhance reasoning stability. Our\nExperimental results indicate that, despite their size and power,\ngeneral-purpose LLMs struggle to achieve satisfactory performance in these\ntasks. Compared to general-purpose LLMs, Xiangqi-R1 greatly advances with an\n18% rise in move legality and a 22% boost in analysis accuracy. Our results\npoint to a promising path for creating general strategic intelligence in\nspatially complex areas.",

However, fully quantized models may exhibit sub-optimal performance\nbelow acceptable levels and face deployment challenges on low-end hardware\naccelerators due to practical constraints. To address these issues,\nquantization can be selectively applied to only a subset of layers, but\nselecting which layers to exclude is non-trivial. To this direction, we propose\nTuneQn, a suite enabling selective quantization, deployment and execution of\nONNX models across various CPU and GPU devices, combined with profiling and\nmulti-objective optimization. TuneQn generates selectively quantized ONNX\nmodels, deploys them on different hardware, measures performance on metrics\nlike accuracy and size, performs Pareto Front minimization to identify the best\nmodel candidate and visualizes the results. To demonstrate the effectiveness of\nTuneQn, we evaluated TuneQn on four ONNX models with two quantization settings\nacross CPU and GPU devices. As a result, we demonstrated that our utility\neffectively performs selective quantization and tuning, selecting ONNX model\ncandidates with up to a $54.14$% reduction in accuracy loss compared to the\nfully quantized model, and up to a $72.9$% model size reduction compared to the\noriginal model.",

This paper presents a novel approach for their safety\nverification based on systematic situation extraction, probabilistic modelling\nand verification. We build upon the concept of a situation coverage grid, which\nexhaustively enumerates environmental configurations relevant to the vehicle's\noperation. This grid is augmented with quantitative probabilistic data\ncollected from situation-based system testing, capturing probabilistic\ntransitions between situations.

This paper presents a novel approach for their safety\nverification based on systematic situation extraction, probabilistic modelling\nand verification. We build upon the concept of a situation coverage grid, which\nexhaustively enumerates environmental configurations relevant to the vehicle's\noperation. This grid is augmented with quantitative probabilistic data\ncollected from situation-based system testing, capturing probabilistic\ntransitions between situations. We then generate a probabilistic model that\nencodes the dynamics of both normal and unsafe system behaviour.

We call our approach\nMathematics Explanations through Games by AI LLMs (MEGA). Some students\nstruggle with Maths and as a result avoid Math-related discipline or subjects\ndespite the importance of Maths across many fields, including signal\nprocessing.

We compared the MEGA method to the traditional step-by-step (CoT)\nmethod to ascertain which is better by using a within-group design after\nrandomly assigning questions for the participants, who are university students.\nSamples (n=60) were randomly drawn from each of the two test sets of the Grade\nSchool Math 8K (GSM8K) and Mathematics Aptitude Test of Heuristics (MATH)\ndatasets, based on the error margin of 11%, the confidence level of 90%, and a\nmanageable number of samples for the student evaluators. These samples were\nused to evaluate two capable LLMs at length (Generative Pretrained Transformer\n4o (GPT4o) and Claude 3.5 Sonnet) out of the initial six that were tested for\ncapability. The results showed that students agree in more instances that the\nMEGA method is experienced as better for learning for both datasets. It is even\nmuch better than the CoT (47.5% compared to 26.67%) in the more difficult MATH\ndataset, indicating that MEGA is better at explaining difficult Maths problems.",

We administered the test to 24 humans and to an\nequal number of LLMs, and we automatically evaluated their answers using OCSAI\ntool for three criteria: Originality, Elaboration, and Flexibility. The results\nshow that LLMs not only outperformed humans in all the assessed criteria, but\ndid better in six out of the eight test tasks. We then computed the uniqueness\nof the individual answers, which showed some minor differences between humans\nand LLMs. Finally, we performed a short manual analysis of the dataset, which\nrevealed that humans are more inclined towards E(extending)-creativity, while\nLLMs favor F(ixed)-creativity.",

Furthermore,\nwe construct ReviewAgents, a multi-role, multi-LLM agent review framework, to\nenhance the review comment generation process. Additionally, we propose\nReviewBench, a benchmark for evaluating the review comments generated by LLMs.\nOur experimental results on ReviewBench demonstrate that while existing LLMs\nexhibit a certain degree of potential for automating the review process, there\nremains a gap when compared to human-generated reviews.

These certificates, such as\nbarrier functions, often learned alongside control policies, once verified,\nserve as mathematical proofs of system safety. However, traditional formal\nverification of their defining conditions typically faces scalability\nchallenges due to exhaustive state-space exploration. To address this\nchallenge, we propose a lightweight runtime monitoring framework that\nintegrates real-time verification and does not require access to the underlying\ncontrol policy. Our monitor observes the system during deployment and performs\non-the-fly verification of the certificate over a lookahead region to ensure\nsafety within a finite prediction horizon. We instantiate this framework for\nReLU-based control barrier functions and demonstrate its practical\neffectiveness in a case study. Our approach enables timely detection of safety\nviolations and incorrect certificates with minimal overhead, providing an\neffective but lightweight alternative to the static verification of the\ncertificates.",

                    "value": "Neural certificates have emerged as a powerful tool in cyber-physical systems\ncontrol, providing witnesses of correctness. These certificates, such as\nbarrier functions, often learned alongside control policies, once verified,\nserve as mathematical proofs of system safety. However, traditional formal\nverification of their defining conditions typically faces scalability\nchallenges due to exhaustive state-space exploration. To address this\nchallenge, we propose a lightweight runtime monitoring framework that\nintegrates real-time verification and does not require access to the underlying\ncontrol policy. Our monitor observes the system during deployment and performs\non-the-fly verification of the certificate over a lookahead region to ensure\nsafety within a finite prediction horizon. We instantiate this framework for\nReLU-based control barrier functions and demonstrate its practical\neffectiveness in a case study. Our approach enables timely detection of safety\nviolations and incorrect certificates with minimal overhead, providing an\neffective but lightweight alternative to the static verification of the\ncertificates."

Therefore, this study\ninvestigates the influence of value similarity on relationship-building among\nLLM agents through two experiments. First, in a preliminary experiment, we\nevaluated the controllability of values in LLMs to identify the most effective\nmodel and prompt design for controlling the values. Subsequently, in the main\nexperiment, we generated pairs of LLM agents imbued with specific values and\nanalyzed their mutual evaluations of trust and interpersonal closeness\nfollowing a dialogue. The experiments were conducted in English and Japanese to\ninvestigate language dependence. The results confirmed that pairs of agents\nwith higher value similarity exhibited greater mutual trust and interpersonal\ncloseness. Our findings demonstrate that the LLM agent simulation serves as a\nvalid testbed for social science theories, contributes to elucidating the\nmechanisms by which values influence relationship building, and provides a\nfoundation for inspiring new theories and insights into the social sciences.",

To bridge this, we introduce Farseer, a novel and refined scaling\nlaw offering enhanced predictive accuracy across scales. By systematically\nconstructing a model loss surface $L(N,D)$, Farseer achieves a significantly\nbetter fit to empirical data than prior laws (e.g., Chinchilla's law). Our\nmethodology yields accurate, robust, and highly generalizable predictions,\ndemonstrating excellent extrapolation capabilities, improving upon Chinchilla's\nlaw by reducing extrapolation error by 433\\%. This allows for the reliable\nevaluation of competing training strategies across all $(N,D)$ settings,\nenabling conclusions from small-scale ablation studies to be confidently\nextrapolated to predict large-scale performance. Furthermore, Farseer provides\nnew insights into optimal compute allocation, better reflecting the nuanced\ndemands of modern LLM training. To validate our approach, we trained an\nextensive suite of approximately 1,000 LLMs across diverse scales and\nconfigurations, consuming roughly 3 million NVIDIA H100 GPU hours. We are\ncomprehensively open-sourcing all models, data, results, and logs at\nhttps://github.com/Farseer-Scaling-Law/Farseer to foster further research.",

                    "value": "Training Large Language Models (LLMs) is prohibitively expensive, creating a\ncritical scaling gap where insights from small-scale experiments often fail to\ntransfer to resource-intensive production systems, thereby hindering efficient\ninnovation. To bridge this, we introduce Farseer, a novel and refined scaling\nlaw offering enhanced predictive accuracy across scales. By systematically\nconstructing a model loss surface $L(N,D)$, Farseer achieves a significantly\nbetter fit to empirical data than prior laws (e.g., Chinchilla's law). Our\nmethodology yields accurate, robust, and highly generalizable predictions,\ndemonstrating excellent extrapolation capabilities, improving upon Chinchilla's\nlaw by reducing extrapolation error by 433\\%. This allows for the reliable\nevaluation of competing training strategies across all $(N,D)$ settings,\nenabling conclusions from small-scale ablation studies to be confidently\nextrapolated to predict large-scale performance. Furthermore, Farseer provides\nnew insights into optimal compute allocation, better reflecting the nuanced\ndemands of modern LLM training. To validate our approach, we trained an\nextensive suite of approximately 1,000 LLMs across diverse scales and\nconfigurations, consuming roughly 3 million NVIDIA H100 GPU hours. We are\ncomprehensively open-sourcing all models, data, results, and logs at\nhttps://github.com/Farseer-Scaling-Law/Farseer to foster further research."

To bridge this gap, we introduce Hyperphantasia, a synthetic\nbenchmark designed to evaluate the mental visualization abilities of MLLMs\nthrough four carefully constructed puzzles.
