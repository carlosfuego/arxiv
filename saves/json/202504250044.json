Whole slide imaging promises numerous advantages;\nhowever, adoption is limited by challenges in ease of use and speed of\nhigh-quality image rendering relative to the simplicity and visual quality of\nglass slides. We introduce Iris, a new high-performance digital pathology\nrendering system. Specifically, we outline and detail the performance metrics\nof Iris Core, the core rendering engine technology. Iris Core comprises machine\ncode modules written from the ground up in C++ and using Vulkan, a low-level\nand low-overhead cross-platform graphical processing unit application program\ninterface, and our novel rapid tile buffering algorithms. We provide a detailed\nexplanation of Iris Core's system architecture, including the stateless\nisolation of core processes, interprocess communication paradigms, and explicit\nsynchronization paradigms that provide powerful control over the graphical\nprocessing unit. Iris Core achieves slide rendering at the sustained maximum\nframe rate on all tested platforms and buffers an entire new slide field of,\nview without overlapping pixels, in 10 ms with enhanced detail in 30 ms. It is\nable to buffer and compute high-fidelity reduction-enhancements for viewing\nlow-power cytology with increased visual quality at a rate of 100-160 us per\nslide tile, and with a cumulative median buffering rate of 1.36 GB of\ndecompressed image data per second. This buffering rate allows for an entirely\nnew field of view to be fully buffered and rendered in less than a single\nmonitor refresh on a standard display, and high detail features within 2-3\nmonitor refresh frames. These metrics far exceed previously published\nspecifications, beyond an order of magnitude in some contexts. The system shows\nno slowing with high use loads, but rather increases performance due to cache\nmechanisms.",

Here we investigated the CDW transition in KV$_3$Sb$_5$ by\nisolating the ultrafast electronic phase transition using time- and\nangleresolved photoemission spectroscopy. An ultrafast electronic phase\ntransition was observed at a critical photoexcitation fluence, Fc, without\nreduction in CDW lattice-distortion-induced band folding. This folded band\npersisted up to 150 K under equilibrium heating, well above the CDW\ncondensation temperature of Tc = 78 K. Notably, the pump-induced band shifts at\nFc were comparable to those caused by thermal effects at Tc. These findings\nsuggest that in KV$_3$Sb$_5$, a fluctuating lattice-driven in-plane CDW emerges\nabove 150 K, with out-of-plane electronic correlations leading to the $2\\times2\n\\times 2$ CDW near Tc, offering key insights into the interplay between the\nelectronic and structural dynamics in AV$_3$Sb$_5$.",

Existing techniques, such\nas pruning, quantization, and mixture of experts/depth, reduce memory capacity\nand/or bandwidth consumption at the cost of slight degradation in inference\nquality. This paper introduces a design solution that further alleviates memory\nbottlenecks by enhancing the on-chip memory controller in AI accelerators to\nachieve two main objectives: (1) significantly reducing memory capacity and\nbandwidth usage through lossless block compression~(e.g., LZ4 and ZSTD) of\nmodel weights and key-value (KV) cache without compromising inference quality,\nand (2) enabling memory bandwidth and energy consumption to scale\nproportionally with context-dependent dynamic quantization. These goals are\naccomplished by equipping the on-chip memory controller with mechanisms to\nimprove fine-grained bit-level accessibility and compressibility of weights and\nKV cache through LLM-aware configuration of in-memory placement and\nrepresentation. Experimental results on publicly available LLMs demonstrate the\neffectiveness of this approach, showing memory footprint reductions of 25.2\\%\nfor model weights and 46.9\\% for KV cache.

To address these issues, we introduce LServe, an\nefficient system that accelerates long-sequence LLM serving via hybrid sparse\nattention. This method unifies different hardware-friendly, structured sparsity\npatterns for both prefilling and decoding attention into a single framework,\nwhere computations on less important tokens are skipped block-wise.

Specifically, we convert half of the attention heads to nearly\nfree streaming heads in both the prefilling and decoding stages. Additionally,\nwe find that only a constant number of KV pages is required to preserve\nlong-context and reasoning capabilities, irrespective of context length. We\nthen design a hierarchical KV page selection policy that dynamically prunes KV\npages based on query-centric similarity.

                "summary": "Pipeline parallelism has emerged as a predominant approach for deploying\nlarge language models (LLMs) across distributed nodes, owing to its lower\ncommunication overhead compared to tensor parallelism. While demonstrating high\nthroughput in request serving, pipeline parallelism often suffers from\nperformance limitations caused by pipeline bubbles, which are primarily\nresulted from imbalanced computation delays across batches. Existing methods\nlike Sarathi-Serve attempt to address this through hybrid scheduling of chunked\nprefill and decode tokens using a fixed token budget. However, such methods may\nexperience significant fluctuations due to either insufficient prefill tokens\nor uneven distribution of decode tokens, ultimately leading to computational\nimbalance. To overcome these inefficiencies, we present gLLM, a globally\nbalanced pipeline parallelism system incorporating Token Throttling to\neffectively mitigate the pipeline bubbles. Our Token Throttling mechanism is a\nfine-grained scheduling policy that independently regulates the quantities of\nprefill and decode tokens, thus enabling balanced computation by leveraging\nglobal information from the inference system. Specifically, for decode tokens,\ngLLM maintains near-consistent token count across processing batches. For\nprefill tokens, it dynamically adjusts batch sizes based on both total pending\ntokens and the memory utilization rates of key-value cache (KV cache).\nFurthermore, gLLM runtime adopts an asynchronous execution and message passing\narchitecture specifically optimized for pipeline parallelism characteristics.\nExperimental evaluations with representative LLMs show that gLLM achieves\nsignificant performance improvements, delivering 11% to 398% higher maximum\nthroughput compared to state-of-the-art pipeline or tensor parallelism systems,\nwhile simultaneously maintaining lower latency.",

On Intel\nprocessors, one of the main challenges for identifying contending addresses is\nthe sliced cache design, where the processor hashes the physical address to\ndetermine where in the cache a memory location is stored. While past works have\ndemonstrated that the hash function can be reversed, they also showed that it\ndepends on physical address bits that the adversary does not know.\n  In this work, we make three main contributions to the art of finding eviction\nsets. We first exploit microarchitectural races to compare memory access times\nand identify the cache slice to which an address maps. We then use the known\nhash function to both reduce the error rate in our slice identification method\nand to reduce the work by extrapolating slice mappings to untested memory\naddresses. Finally, we show how to propagate information on eviction sets\nacross different page offsets for the hitherto unexplored case of non-linear\nhash functions.\n  Our contributions allow for entire LLC eviction set generation in 0.7 seconds\non the Intel i7-9850H and 1.6 seconds on the i9-10900K, both using non-linear\nfunctions. This represents a significant improvement compared to\nstate-of-the-art techniques taking 9x and 10x longer, respectively.",

However, LLMs still face distinct\nchallenges in complex logical reasoning, as (1) proof-finding requires\nsystematic exploration and the maintenance of logical coherence and (2)\nsearching the right combination of premises at each reasoning step is\ninherently challenging in tasks with large premise space.

There\nexists some prior work that target the last-level cache (LLC) of Intel\nprocessors, which is inclusive of higher-level caches, and L2 caches of ARM\nsystems. In this paper, we target the System-Level Cache (SLC) of Apple\nM-series SoCs, which is exclusive to higher-level CPU caches. We address the\nchallenges of the exclusiveness and propose a suite of SLC-cache occupancy\nattacks, the first of its kind, where an adversary can monitor GPU and other\nCPU cluster activities from their own CPU cluster. We first discover the\nstructure of SLC in Apple M1 SOC and various policies pertaining to access and\nsharing through reverse engineering. We propose two attacks against websites.\nOne is a coarse-grained fingerprinting attack, recognizing which website is\naccessed based on their different GPU memory access patterns monitored through\nthe SLC occupancy channel. The other attack is a fine-grained pixel stealing\nattack, which precisely monitors the GPU memory usage for rendering different\npixels, through the SLC occupancy channel. Third, we introduce a novel screen\ncapturing attack which works beyond webpages, with the monitoring granularity\nof 57 rows of pixels (there are 1600 rows for the screen). This significantly\nexpands the attack surface, allowing the adversary to retrieve any screen\ndisplay, posing a substantial new threat to system security. Our findings\nreveal critical vulnerabilities in Apple's M-series SoCs and emphasize the\nurgent need for effective countermeasures against cache occupancy attacks in\nheterogeneous computing environments.",

In this paper, we target the System-Level Cache (SLC) of Apple\nM-series SoCs, which is exclusive to higher-level CPU caches. We address the\nchallenges of the exclusiveness and propose a suite of SLC-cache occupancy\nattacks, the first of its kind, where an adversary can monitor GPU and other\nCPU cluster activities from their own CPU cluster. We first discover the\nstructure of SLC in Apple M1 SOC and various policies pertaining to access and\nsharing through reverse engineering. We propose two attacks against websites.\nOne is a coarse-grained fingerprinting attack, recognizing which website is\naccessed based on their different GPU memory access patterns monitored through\nthe SLC occupancy channel. The other attack is a fine-grained pixel stealing\nattack, which precisely monitors the GPU memory usage for rendering different\npixels, through the SLC occupancy channel. Third, we introduce a novel screen\ncapturing attack which works beyond webpages, with the monitoring granularity\nof 57 rows of pixels (there are 1600 rows for the screen). This significantly\nexpands the attack surface, allowing the adversary to retrieve any screen\ndisplay, posing a substantial new threat to system security. Our findings\nreveal critical vulnerabilities in Apple's M-series SoCs and emphasize the\nurgent need for effective countermeasures against cache occupancy attacks in\nheterogeneous computing environments."

To investigate long-context video modeling, we introduce\nFrame AutoRegressive (FAR), a strong baseline for video autoregressive\nmodeling. Just as language models learn causal dependencies between tokens\n(i.e., Token AR), FAR models temporal causal dependencies between continuous\nframes, achieving better convergence than Token AR and video diffusion\ntransformers. Building on FAR, we observe that long-context video modeling\nfaces challenges due to visual redundancy. Training on long videos is\ncomputationally expensive, as vision tokens grow much faster than language\ntokens. To tackle this issue, we propose balancing locality and long-range\ndependency through long short-term context modeling. A high-resolution\nshort-term context window ensures fine-grained temporal consistency, while an\nunlimited long-term context window encodes long-range information using fewer\ntokens. With this approach, we can train on long video sequences with a\nmanageable token context length, thereby significantly reducing training time\nand memory usage. Furthermore, we propose a multi-level KV cache designed to\nsupport the long short-term context modeling, which accelerating inference on\nlong video sequences.

This includes\nshortest-path and branch-and-bound benchmarks that resemble real applications.\nMoreover, the MultiQueue can be configured easily to balance throughput and\nquality according to the application's requirements. We employ a seemingly\nparadoxical technique of wait-free locking that might be of broader interest\nfor converting sequential data structures into relaxed concurrent data\nstructures."

To raise awareness of this problem, we study an interaction between\ntwo state-of-the art defenses in this paper, timing obfuscations of remote\ncache lines (TORC) and delaying speculative changes to remote cache lines\n(DSRC). TORC mitigates cache-hit based attacks and DSRC mitigates speculative\ncoherence state change attacks.\n  We observe that DSRC enables coherence information to be retrieved into the\nprocessor core, where it is out of the reach of timing obfuscations to protect.\nThis creates an unforeseen consequence that redo operations can be triggered\nwithin the core to detect the presence or absence of remote cache lines, which\nconstitutes a security vulnerability. We demonstrate that a new covert channel\nattack is possible using this vulnerability. We propose two ways to mitigate\nthe attack, whose performance varies depending on an application's cache usage.\nOne way is to never send remote exclusive coherence state (E) information to\nthe core even if it is created. The other way is to never create a remote E\nstate, which is responsible for triggering redos.\n  We demonstrate the timing difference caused by this microarchitectural\ndefense assumption violation using GEM5 simulations.

However, as the resolution and duration\nof generated videos increase, the encoding cost of Video VAEs becomes a\nlimiting bottleneck in training LVDMs. Moreover, the block-wise inference\nmethod adopted by most LVDMs can lead to discontinuities of latent space when\nprocessing long-duration videos. The key to addressing the computational\nbottleneck lies in decomposing videos into distinct components and efficiently\nencoding the critical information. Wavelet transform can decompose videos into\nmultiple frequency-domain components and improve the efficiency significantly,\nwe thus propose Wavelet Flow VAE (WF-VAE), an autoencoder that leverages\nmulti-level wavelet transform to facilitate low-frequency energy flow into\nlatent representation. Furthermore, we introduce a method called Causal Cache,\nwhich maintains the integrity of latent space during block-wise inference.\nCompared to state-of-the-art video VAEs, WF-VAE demonstrates superior\nperformance in both PSNR and LPIPS metrics, achieving 2x higher throughput and\n4x lower memory consumption while maintaining competitive reconstruction\nquality.

                    "value": "Video Variational Autoencoder (VAE) encodes videos into a low-dimensional\nlatent space, becoming a key component of most Latent Video Diffusion Models\n(LVDMs) to reduce model training costs. However, as the resolution and duration\nof generated videos increase, the encoding cost of Video VAEs becomes a\nlimiting bottleneck in training LVDMs. Moreover, the block-wise inference\nmethod adopted by most LVDMs can lead to discontinuities of latent space when\nprocessing long-duration videos. The key to addressing the computational\nbottleneck lies in decomposing videos into distinct components and efficiently\nencoding the critical information. Wavelet transform can decompose videos into\nmultiple frequency-domain components and improve the efficiency significantly,\nwe thus propose Wavelet Flow VAE (WF-VAE), an autoencoder that leverages\nmulti-level wavelet transform to facilitate low-frequency energy flow into\nlatent representation. Furthermore, we introduce a method called Causal Cache,\nwhich maintains the integrity of latent space during block-wise inference.\nCompared to state-of-the-art video VAEs, WF-VAE demonstrates superior\nperformance in both PSNR and LPIPS metrics, achieving 2x higher throughput and\n4x lower memory consumption while maintaining competitive reconstruction\nquality.

However,\nthe high memory and computation cost induced by the KV cache limits the\ninference efficiency, especially for long input sequences. Compute-in-memory\n(CIM)-based accelerators have been proposed for LLM acceleration with KV cache\npruning.

In this paper, we\npropose a ferroelectric FET (FeFET)-based unified content addressable memory\n(CAM) and CIM architecture, dubbed as UniCAIM. UniCAIM features simultaneous\nsupport for static and dynamic pruning with 3 computation modes: 1) in the CAM\nmode, UniCAIM enables approximate similarity measurement in O(1) time for\ndynamic KV cache pruning with high energy efficiency; 2) in the charge-domain\nCIM mode, static pruning can be supported based on accumulative similarity\nscore, which is much more flexible compared to fixed patterns; 3) in the\ncurrent-domain mode, exact attention computation can be conducted with a subset\nof selected KV cache. We further propose a novel CAM/CIM cell design that\nleverages the multi-level characteristics of FeFETs for signed multibit storage\nof the KV cache and in-place attention computation. With extensive experimental\nresults, we demonstrate UniCAIM can reduce the area-energy-delay product (AEDP)\nby 8.2-831x over the state-ofthe-art CIM-based LLM accelerators at the circuit\nlevel, along with high accuracy comparable with dense attention at the\napplication level, showing its great potential for efficient long-context LLM\ninference.",

However, the dual requirements for graph computation\nefficiency (with contiguous structures) and graph update efficiency (with\nlinked list-like structures) present a conflict in the design principles of\ngraph structures. After experimental studies of existing state-of-the-art\ndynamic graph structures, we observe that the overhead of cache misses accounts\nfor a major portion of the graph computation time. This paper presents\nGastCoCo, a system with graph storage and coroutine-based prefetch co-design.\nBy employing software prefetching via stackless coroutines and introducing a\nprefetch-friendly data structure CBList, GastCoCo significantly alleviates the\nperformance degradation caused by cache misses. Our results show that GastCoCo\noutperforms state-of-the-art graph storage systems by 1.3x - 180x in graph\nupdates and 1.4x - 41.1x in graph computation.",

                    "value": "An efficient data structure is fundamental to meeting the growing demands in\ndynamic graph processing. However, the dual requirements for graph computation\nefficiency (with contiguous structures) and graph update efficiency (with\nlinked list-like structures) present a conflict in the design principles of\ngraph structures. After experimental studies of existing state-of-the-art\ndynamic graph structures, we observe that the overhead of cache misses accounts\nfor a major portion of the graph computation time. This paper presents\nGastCoCo, a system with graph storage and coroutine-based prefetch co-design.\nBy employing software prefetching via stackless coroutines and introducing a\nprefetch-friendly data structure CBList, GastCoCo significantly alleviates the\nperformance degradation caused by cache misses. Our results show that GastCoCo\noutperforms state-of-the-art graph storage systems by 1.3x - 180x in graph\nupdates and 1.4x - 41.1x in graph computation."

                "summary": "Addressing the inherent low acquisition frequency limitation of 3D LiDAR to\nachieve high-frequency output has become a critical research focus in the\nLiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO) domain. To ensure real-time performance,\nfrequency-enhanced LIO systems must process each sweep within significantly\nreduced timeframe, which presents substantial challenges for deployment on\nlow-computational-power platforms. To address these limitations, we introduce\nSR-LIO++, an innovative LIO system capable of achieving doubled output\nfrequency relative to input frequency on resource-constrained hardware\nplatforms, including the Raspberry Pi 4B. Our system employs a sweep\nreconstruction methodology to enhance LiDAR sweep frequency, generating\nhigh-frequency reconstructed sweeps. Building upon this foundation, we propose\na caching mechanism for intermediate results (i.e., surface parameters) of the\nmost recent segments, effectively minimizing redundant processing of common\nsegments in adjacent reconstructed sweeps. This method decouples processing\ntime from the traditionally linear dependence on reconstructed sweep frequency.\nFurthermore, we present a quantized map point management based on index table\nmapping, significantly reducing memory usage by converting global 3D point\nstorage from 64-bit double precision to 8-bit char representation. This method\nalso converts the computationally intensive Euclidean distance calculations in\nnearest neighbor searches from 64-bit double precision to 16-bit short and\n32-bit integer formats, significantly reducing both memory and computational\ncost. Extensive experimental evaluations across three distinct computing\nplatforms and four public datasets demonstrate that SR-LIO++ maintains\nstate-of-the-art accuracy while substantially enhancing efficiency. Notably,\nour system successfully achieves 20Hz state output on Raspberry Pi 4B hardware.",

                "summary": "Test-time scaling has emerged as a prominent research direction in machine\nlearning, enabling models to enhance their expressive capabilities during\ninference.Transformers, renowned for striking a delicate balance between\nefficiency and expressiveness, have benefited from test-time scaling techniques\nthat leverage an expanding key-value (KV) cache to significantly improve\nperformance.In this paper, we introduce a novel state-based approach to\ntest-time scaling, which we term state tuning, tailored to the RNN-based RWKV-7\nmodel.By exploiting the unique strengths of RWKV-7, our method achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on the target task without altering the model's\npre-trained weights. Our approach centers on three key innovations. First, we\ndevelop an observer framework that allows a smaller model to replicate and\nlearn the state dynamics of the RWKV-7 model. Second, we employ a kernel method\nto dynamically upscale the state size, enhancing the model's capacity to\ncapture intricate patterns. Third, we integrate Decorrelated Backpropagation\n(DBP) to optimize the upscaled state matrix, thereby improving convergence and\nexpressivity. By tuning only the state matrix, we demonstrate that a smaller\nmodel can outperform larger models on the given task. This method preserves the\nefficiency of the original RWKV-7 architecture while harnessing the power of\ntest-time scaling to deliver superior results. Our findings underscore the\npotential of state tuning as an effective strategy for advancing model\nperformance in resource-constrained settings.

                    "value": "Test-time scaling has emerged as a prominent research direction in machine\nlearning, enabling models to enhance their expressive capabilities during\ninference.Transformers, renowned for striking a delicate balance between\nefficiency and expressiveness, have benefited from test-time scaling techniques\nthat leverage an expanding key-value (KV) cache to significantly improve\nperformance.In this paper, we introduce a novel state-based approach to\ntest-time scaling, which we term state tuning, tailored to the RNN-based RWKV-7\nmodel.By exploiting the unique strengths of RWKV-7, our method achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on the target task without altering the model's\npre-trained weights. Our approach centers on three key innovations. First, we\ndevelop an observer framework that allows a smaller model to replicate and\nlearn the state dynamics of the RWKV-7 model. Second, we employ a kernel method\nto dynamically upscale the state size, enhancing the model's capacity to\ncapture intricate patterns. Third, we integrate Decorrelated Backpropagation\n(DBP) to optimize the upscaled state matrix, thereby improving convergence and\nexpressivity. By tuning only the state matrix, we demonstrate that a smaller\nmodel can outperform larger models on the given task. This method preserves the\nefficiency of the original RWKV-7 architecture while harnessing the power of\ntest-time scaling to deliver superior results. Our findings underscore the\npotential of state tuning as an effective strategy for advancing model\nperformance in resource-constrained settings.

Existing\nneural stylization techniques primarily focus on transferring appearance\nfeatures such as color and texture, often neglecting the equally crucial aspect\nof structural stylization. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study on\nthe simultaneous stylization of structure and appearance of 2D images.\nSpecifically, we introduce DiffArtist, which, to the best of our knowledge, is\nthe first stylization method to allow for dual controllability over structure\nand appearance. Our key insight is to represent structure and appearance as\nseparate diffusion processes to achieve complete disentanglement without\nrequiring any training, thereby endowing users with unprecedented\ncontrollability for both components. The evaluation of stylization of both\nappearance and structure, however, remains challenging as it necessitates\nsemantic understanding. To this end, we further propose a Multimodal LLM-based\nstyle evaluator, which better aligns with human preferences than metrics\nlacking semantic understanding. With this powerful evaluator, we conduct\nextensive analysis, demonstrating that DiffArtist achieves superior style\nfidelity, editability, and structure-appearance disentanglement. These merits\nmake DiffArtist a highly versatile solution for creative applications. Project\nhomepage: https://github.com/songrise/Artist.",

In this paper, we present a comprehensive study on\nthe simultaneous stylization of structure and appearance of 2D images.\nSpecifically, we introduce DiffArtist, which, to the best of our knowledge, is\nthe first stylization method to allow for dual controllability over structure\nand appearance. Our key insight is to represent structure and appearance as\nseparate diffusion processes to achieve complete disentanglement without\nrequiring any training, thereby endowing users with unprecedented\ncontrollability for both components. The evaluation of stylization of both\nappearance and structure, however, remains challenging as it necessitates\nsemantic understanding. To this end, we further propose a Multimodal LLM-based\nstyle evaluator, which better aligns with human preferences than metrics\nlacking semantic understanding. With this powerful evaluator, we conduct\nextensive analysis, demonstrating that DiffArtist achieves superior style\nfidelity, editability, and structure-appearance disentanglement. These merits\nmake DiffArtist a highly versatile solution for creative applications. Project\nhomepage: https://github.com/songrise/Artist."

We observed pi1 Gru with ALMA and VLT/SPHERE.\nIn addition, we collected archival photometry data and used the Hipparcos-Gaia\nproper motion anomaly. We derive the best orbital parameters from Bayesian\ninference. Results. The inner companion, pi1 Gru C was located at 37.4 +/- 2.0\nmas from the primary in June-July 2019 (projected separation of 6.05 +/- 0.55\nau at 161.7 +/- 11.7 pc). The best orbital solution gives a companion mass of\n0.86 (+0.22/-0.20) Msun (using the derived mass of the primary), and a\nsemi-major axis of 7.05 (+0.54/-0.57) au. This leads to an orbital period of\n11.0 (+1.7/-1.5) yr. The best solution is an elliptical orbit with eccentricity\ne = 0.35 (+0.18/-0.17), but a circular orbit cannot be totally excluded. The\nclose companion can either be a K1V (F9.5V/K7V) star or a white dwarf. The\nultraviolet and millimeter continuum photometry are consistent with the\npresence of an accretion disk around the close companion.

Conclusions.\nThough the close companion and the AGB star are interacting, and an accretion\ndisk is observed around the companion, the mass-accretion rate is too low to\ncause a Ia supernova but could produce novae every ~900 yr.

To overcome this limitation, we introduce a\nDecoupled Global-Local Alignment (DeGLA) framework that improves compositional\nunderstanding while substantially mitigating losses in general capabilities.

We present a\npreemption aware scheduling approach for priority and deadline constrained task\noffloading in homogeneous edge networks. Our scheduling approach consists of\ntwo distinct scheduling algorithms, designed to accommodate the differing\nrequirements of high and low priority tasks. To satisfy a task's deadline, our\nscheduling approach considers the availability of both communication and\ncomputational resources in the network when making placements in both the\ncurrent time-slot and future time-slots. The scheduler implements a\ndeadline-aware preemption mechanism to guarantee resource access to high\npriority tasks. When low-priority tasks are selected for preemption, the\nscheduler will attempt to reallocate them if possible before their deadline. We\nimplement this scheduling approach into a task offloading system which we\nevaluate empirically in the real-world on a network of edge devices composed of\nfour Raspberry Pi 2 Model B's. We evaluate this system under against a version\nwithout a task preemption mechanism as well as workstealing approaches to\ncompare the impact on high priority task completion and the ability to complete\noverall frames. These solutions are evaluated under a workload of 1296 frames.\nOur findings show that our scheduling approach allows for 99\\% of high-priority\ntasks to complete while also providing a 3 - 8\\% increase in the number of\nframes fully classified end-to-end over both workstealing approaches and\nsystems without a preemption mechanism.",

These solutions are evaluated under a workload of 1296 frames.\nOur findings show that our scheduling approach allows for 99\\% of high-priority\ntasks to complete while also providing a 3 - 8\\% increase in the number of\nframes fully classified end-to-end over both workstealing approaches and\nsystems without a preemption mechanism."

Yet, their multi-step inference process remains computationally\nintensive, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. Moreover,\nexisting methods often struggle to generate face images that are harmonious,\nrealistic, and consistent with the subject's identity. In this work, we propose\nOSDFace, a novel one-step diffusion model for face restoration. Specifically,\nwe propose a visual representation embedder (VRE) to better capture prior\ninformation and understand the input face. In VRE, low-quality faces are\nprocessed by a visual tokenizer and subsequently embedded with a\nvector-quantized dictionary to generate visual prompts. Additionally, we\nincorporate a facial identity loss derived from face recognition to further\nensure identity consistency. We further employ a generative adversarial network\n(GAN) as a guidance model to encourage distribution alignment between the\nrestored face and the ground truth. Experimental results demonstrate that\nOSDFace surpasses current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in both visual\nquality and quantitative metrics, generating high-fidelity, natural face images\nwith high identity consistency. The code and model will be released at\nhttps://github.com/jkwang28/OSDFace.",

Yet, their multi-step inference process remains computationally\nintensive, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. Moreover,\nexisting methods often struggle to generate face images that are harmonious,\nrealistic, and consistent with the subject's identity. In this work, we propose\nOSDFace, a novel one-step diffusion model for face restoration. Specifically,\nwe propose a visual representation embedder (VRE) to better capture prior\ninformation and understand the input face. In VRE, low-quality faces are\nprocessed by a visual tokenizer and subsequently embedded with a\nvector-quantized dictionary to generate visual prompts. Additionally, we\nincorporate a facial identity loss derived from face recognition to further\nensure identity consistency. We further employ a generative adversarial network\n(GAN) as a guidance model to encourage distribution alignment between the\nrestored face and the ground truth. Experimental results demonstrate that\nOSDFace surpasses current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in both visual\nquality and quantitative metrics, generating high-fidelity, natural face images\nwith high identity consistency. The code and model will be released at\nhttps://github.com/jkwang28/OSDFace."

In this paper, we provide a systematic overview of existing\ncommunication protocols for LLM agents.

Specifically, we formulate a joint optimization problem\nthat integrates resource allocation, server selection, and task offloading,\naiming to minimize the weighted sum of task execution delay and energy\nconsumption. We also introduce a user-server co-selection algorithm to address\nthe selection issue between users and servers. Furthermore, we design an\nalgorithm centered on user pre-decision to coordinate the outputs of continuous\nand discrete hybrid decisions, and introduce a priority sampling mechanism\nbased on reward-error trade-off to optimize the experience replay mechanism of\nthe network.

We performed a thorough\nevaluation of existing synthetic text detection approaches on lyrics, a\npreviously unexplored data type. We also investigated methods to adapt the\nbest-performing features to lyrics through unsupervised domain adaptation.\nFollowing both music and industrial constraints, we examined how well these\napproaches generalize across languages, scale with data availability, handle\nmultilingual language content, and perform on novel genres in few-shot\nsettings.

To address\nthis gap, we curated a diverse dataset of real and synthetic lyrics from\nmultiple languages, music genres, and artists. The generation pipeline was\nvalidated using both humans and automated methods. We performed a thorough\nevaluation of existing synthetic text detection approaches on lyrics, a\npreviously unexplored data type. We also investigated methods to adapt the\nbest-performing features to lyrics through unsupervised domain adaptation.\nFollowing both music and industrial constraints, we examined how well these\napproaches generalize across languages, scale with data availability, handle\nmultilingual language content, and perform on novel genres in few-shot\nsettings. Our findings show promising results that could inform policy\ndecisions around AI-generated music and enhance transparency for users."

In this paper, we propose SEGA, a novel\napproach for Single-imagE-based 3D drivable Gaussian head Avatar creation that\ncombines generalized prior models with a new hierarchical UV-space Gaussian\nSplatting framework. SEGA seamlessly combines priors derived from large-scale\n2D datasets with 3D priors learned from multi-view, multi-expression, and\nmulti-ID data, achieving robust generalization to unseen identities while\nensuring 3D consistency across novel viewpoints and expressions. We further\npresent a hierarchical UV-space Gaussian Splatting framework that leverages\nFLAME-based structural priors and employs a dual-branch architecture to\ndisentangle dynamic and static facial components effectively. The dynamic\nbranch encodes expression-driven fine details, while the static branch focuses\non expression-invariant regions, enabling efficient parameter inference and\nprecomputation. This design maximizes the utility of limited 3D data and\nachieves real-time performance for animation and rendering. Additionally, SEGA\nperforms person-specific fine-tuning to further enhance the fidelity and\nrealism of the generated avatars. Experiments show our method outperforms\nstate-of-the-art approaches in generalization ability, identity preservation,\nand expression realism, advancing one-shot avatar creation for practical\napplications.",

We present a compositional learning algorithm implementing these\nideas, where learning counterexamples precisely correspond to distribution\ncounterexamples under well-defined conditions. We provide an implementation,\ncalled CoalA, using the state-of-the-art active learning library LearnLib. Our\nexperiments show that in more than 630 subject systems, CoalA delivers orders\nof magnitude improvements (up to five orders) in membership queries and in\nsystems with significant concurrency, it also achieves better scalability in\nthe number of equivalence queries."

Therefore, we propose a new\nfew-shot temporal action localization method by Chain-of-Thought textual\nreasoning to improve localization performance. Specifically, we design a novel\nfew-shot learning framework that leverages textual semantic information to\nenhance the model's ability to capture action commonalities and variations,\nwhich includes a semantic-aware text-visual alignment module designed to align\nthe query and support videos at different levels. Meanwhile, to better express\nthe temporal dependencies and causal relationships between actions at the\ntextual level to assist action localization, we design a Chain of Thought\n(CoT)-like reasoning method that progressively guides the Vision Language Model\n(VLM) and Large Language Model (LLM) to generate CoT-like text descriptions for\nvideos. The generated texts can capture more variance of action than visual\nfeatures. We conduct extensive experiments on the publicly available\nActivityNet1.3 and THUMOS14 datasets. We introduce the first dataset named\nHuman-related Anomaly Localization and explore the application of the TAL task\nin human anomaly detection. The experimental results demonstrate that our\nproposed method significantly outperforms existing methods in single-instance\nand multi-instance scenarios.

Specifically, we design a novel\nfew-shot learning framework that leverages textual semantic information to\nenhance the model's ability to capture action commonalities and variations,\nwhich includes a semantic-aware text-visual alignment module designed to align\nthe query and support videos at different levels. Meanwhile, to better express\nthe temporal dependencies and causal relationships between actions at the\ntextual level to assist action localization, we design a Chain of Thought\n(CoT)-like reasoning method that progressively guides the Vision Language Model\n(VLM) and Large Language Model (LLM) to generate CoT-like text descriptions for\nvideos. The generated texts can capture more variance of action than visual\nfeatures. We conduct extensive experiments on the publicly available\nActivityNet1.3 and THUMOS14 datasets. We introduce the first dataset named\nHuman-related Anomaly Localization and explore the application of the TAL task\nin human anomaly detection. The experimental results demonstrate that our\nproposed method significantly outperforms existing methods in single-instance\nand multi-instance scenarios. We will release our code, data and benchmark."

Meanwhile, existing execution\nmechanisms struggle to balance complexity and stability, and their limited\naction space restricts their ability to handle diverse real-world tasks. To\naddress these limitations, we propose GoalAct, a novel agent framework that\nintroduces a continuously updated global planning mechanism and integrates a\nhierarchical execution strategy. GoalAct decomposes task execution into\nhigh-level skills, including searching, coding, writing and more, thereby\nreducing planning complexity while enhancing the agents' adaptability across\ndiverse task scenarios. We evaluate GoalAct on LegalAgentBench, a benchmark\nwith multiple types of legal tasks that require the use of multiple types of\ntools. Experimental results demonstrate that GoalAct achieves state-of-the-art\n(SOTA) performance, with an average improvement of 12.22% in success rate.\nThese findings highlight GoalAct's potential to drive the development of more\nadvanced intelligent agent systems, making them more effective across complex\nreal-world applications.

In this\nwork, we investigate how conversational UIs powered by LLMs drive these\npsychological factors and psychological ownership, the sense of possession a\nuser may come to feel towards an entity or object they may not legally own. We\ndesigned four SAV UIs with varying levels of anthropomorphic characteristics\nand psychological ownership triggers. Quantitative measures of psychological\nownership, anthropomorphism, quality of service, disclosure tendency, sentiment\nof SAV responses, and overall acceptance were collected after participants\ninteracted with each SAV. Qualitative feedback was also gathered regarding the\nexperience of psychological ownership during the interactions. The results\nindicate that an SAV conversational UI designed to be more anthropomorphic and\nto induce psychological ownership improved users' perceptions of the SAV's\nhuman-like qualities and improved the sentiment of responses compared to a\ncontrol condition. These findings provide practical guidance for designing\nLLM-based conversational UIs that enhance user experience and adoption of SAVs.",

                    "value": "There has been extensive prior work exploring how psychological factors such\nas anthropomorphism affect the adoption of shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs).\nHowever, limited research has been conducted on how prompt strategies in large\nlanguage model (LLM)-powered SAV User Interfaces (UIs) affect users'\nperceptions, experiences, and intentions to adopt such technology. In this\nwork, we investigate how conversational UIs powered by LLMs drive these\npsychological factors and psychological ownership, the sense of possession a\nuser may come to feel towards an entity or object they may not legally own. We\ndesigned four SAV UIs with varying levels of anthropomorphic characteristics\nand psychological ownership triggers. Quantitative measures of psychological\nownership, anthropomorphism, quality of service, disclosure tendency, sentiment\nof SAV responses, and overall acceptance were collected after participants\ninteracted with each SAV. Qualitative feedback was also gathered regarding the\nexperience of psychological ownership during the interactions. The results\nindicate that an SAV conversational UI designed to be more anthropomorphic and\nto induce psychological ownership improved users' perceptions of the SAV's\nhuman-like qualities and improved the sentiment of responses compared to a\ncontrol condition. These findings provide practical guidance for designing\nLLM-based conversational UIs that enhance user experience and adoption of SAVs."

This paper\nsystematically investigates the jailbreak vulnerabilities of four prominent MAD\nframeworks built upon leading commercial LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4, GPT-3.5-turbo,\nand DeepSeek) without compromising internal agents. We introduce a novel\nstructured prompt-rewriting framework specifically designed to exploit MAD\ndynamics via narrative encapsulation, role-driven escalation, iterative\nrefinement, and rhetorical obfuscation. Our extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat MAD systems are inherently more vulnerable than single-agent setups.\nCrucially, our proposed attack methodology significantly amplifies this\nfragility, increasing average harmfulness from 28.14% to 80.34% and achieving\nattack success rates as high as 80% in certain scenarios. These findings reveal\nintrinsic vulnerabilities in MAD architectures and underscore the urgent need\nfor robust, specialized defenses prior to real-world deployment.",

This paper investigates\nthe performance of zero-shot classifiers (ZSCs) on a multi-label industrial\ndataset. We focuse on classifying requirements according to a taxonomy designed\nto support requirements tracing. We compare multiple variants of ZSCs using\ndifferent embeddings, including 9 language models (LMs) with a reduced number\nof parameters (up to 3B), e.g., BERT, and 5 large LMs (LLMs) with a large\nnumber of parameters (up to 70B), e.g., Llama.

This aims to better capture the\nclassification's hierarchical nature and provides a more nuanced evaluation of\nhow far the results are from the ground truth. 1) The top-performing model on 5\nout of 6 output spaces is T5-xl, with maximum $F_\\beta$ = 0.78 and Dn = 0.04,\nwhile BERT base outperformed the other models in one case, with maximum\n$F_\\beta$ = 0.83 and Dn = 0.04. 2) LMs with smaller parameter size produce the\nbest classification results compared to LLMs. Thus, addressing the problem in\npractice is feasible as limited computing power is needed. 3) The model\narchitecture (autoencoding, autoregression, and sentence-to-sentence)\nsignificantly affects the classifier's performance.

Recent advancements in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), such as\nOpenAI o1 and DeepSeek-R1, have further improved performance in System-2\nreasoning domains like mathematics and programming by harnessing supervised\nfine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to enhance the\nChain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, while longer CoT reasoning sequences\nimprove performance, they also introduce significant computational overhead due\nto verbose and redundant outputs, known as the \"overthinking phenomenon\". In\nthis paper, we provide the first structured survey to systematically\ninvestigate and explore the current progress toward achieving efficient\nreasoning in LLMs. Overall, relying on the inherent mechanism of LLMs, we\ncategorize existing works into several key directions: (1) model-based\nefficient reasoning, which considers optimizing full-length reasoning models\ninto more concise reasoning models or directly training efficient reasoning\nmodels; (2) reasoning output-based efficient reasoning, which aims to\ndynamically reduce reasoning steps and length during inference; (3) input\nprompts-based efficient reasoning, which seeks to enhance reasoning efficiency\nbased on input prompt properties such as difficulty or length control.\nAdditionally, we introduce the use of efficient data for training reasoning\nmodels, explore the reasoning capabilities of small language models, and\ndiscuss evaluation methods and benchmarking.",

Web APIs that employ the REST style are\nknown as RESTful (or REST) APIs. When using or testing a RESTful API,\ndevelopers may need to employ its specification, which is often defined by\nopen-source standards such as the OpenAPI Specification (OAS). However, it can\nbe very time-consuming and error-prone to write and update these\nspecifications, which may negatively impact the use of RESTful APIs, especially\nwhen the software requirements change. Many tools and methods have been\nproposed to solve this problem, such as Respector and Swagger Core. OAS\ngeneration can be regarded as a common text-generation task that creates a\nformal description of API endpoints derived from the source code. A potential\nsolution for this may involve using Large Language Models (LLMs), which have\nstrong capabilities in both code understanding and text generation. Motivated\nby this, we propose a novel approach for generating the OASs of RESTful APIs\nusing LLMs: LLM-based RESTful API-Specification Generation (LRASGen). To the\nbest of our knowledge, this is the first use of LLMs and API source code to\ngenerate OASs for RESTful APIs. Compared with existing tools and methods,\nLRASGen can generate the OASs, even when the implementation is incomplete (with\npartial code, and/or missing annotations/comments, etc.). To evaluate the\nLRASGen performance, we conducted a series of empirical studies on 20\nreal-world RESTful APIs. The results show that two LLMs (GPT-4o mini and\nDeepSeek V3) can both support LARSGen to generate accurate specifications, and\nLRASGen-generated specifications cover an average of 48.85% more missed\nentities than the developer-provided specifications.",

Requirements classification is a common task in RE.\nWhile non-generative LLMs like BERT have been successfully applied to this\ntask, there has been limited exploration of generative LLMs. This gap raises an\nimportant question: how well can generative LLMs, which produce context-aware\noutputs, perform in requirements classification? In this study, we explore the\neffectiveness of three generative LLMs-Bloom, Gemma, and Llama-in performing\nboth binary and multi-class requirements classification. We design an extensive\nexperimental study involving over 400 experiments across three widely used\ndatasets (PROMISE NFR, Functional-Quality, and SecReq). Our study concludes\nthat while factors like prompt design and LLM architecture are universally\nimportant, others-such as dataset variations-have a more situational impact,\ndepending on the complexity of the classification task. This insight can guide\nfuture model development and deployment strategies, focusing on optimising\nprompt structures and aligning model architectures with task-specific needs for\nimproved performance.",

                    "value": "In recent years, transformer-based large language models (LLMs) have\nrevolutionised natural language processing (NLP), with generative models\nopening new possibilities for tasks that require context-aware text generation.\nRequirements engineering (RE) has also seen a surge in the experimentation of\nLLMs for different tasks, including trace-link detection, regulatory\ncompliance, and others. Requirements classification is a common task in RE.\nWhile non-generative LLMs like BERT have been successfully applied to this\ntask, there has been limited exploration of generative LLMs. This gap raises an\nimportant question: how well can generative LLMs, which produce context-aware\noutputs, perform in requirements classification? In this study, we explore the\neffectiveness of three generative LLMs-Bloom, Gemma, and Llama-in performing\nboth binary and multi-class requirements classification. We design an extensive\nexperimental study involving over 400 experiments across three widely used\ndatasets (PROMISE NFR, Functional-Quality, and SecReq). Our study concludes\nthat while factors like prompt design and LLM architecture are universally\nimportant, others-such as dataset variations-have a more situational impact,\ndepending on the complexity of the classification task. This insight can guide\nfuture model development and deployment strategies, focusing on optimising\nprompt structures and aligning model architectures with task-specific needs for\nimproved performance."

We propose a unique multi-frame localization paradigm\nfor estimating the states of a UAV in various frames of reference using\nmultiple sensors simultaneously. The system enables complex missions in GNSS\nand GNSS-denied environments, including outdoor-indoor transitions and the\nexecution of redundant estimators for backing up unreliable localization\nsources. Two feedback control designs are presented: one for precise and\naggressive maneuvers, and the other for stable and smooth flight with a noisy\nstate estimate. The proposed control and estimation pipeline are constructed\nwithout using the Euler/Tait-Bryan angle representation of orientation in 3D.\nInstead, we rely on rotation matrices and a novel heading-based convention to\nrepresent the one free rotational degree-of-freedom in 3D of a standard\nmultirotor helicopter. We provide an actively maintained and well-documented\nopen-source implementation, including realistic simulation of UAV, sensors, and\nlocalization systems. The proposed system is the product of years of applied\nresearch on multi-robot systems, aerial swarms, aerial manipulation, motion\nplanning, and remote sensing. All our results have been supported by real-world\nsystem deployment that shaped the system into the form presented here. In\naddition, the system was utilized during the participation of our team from the\nCTU in Prague in the prestigious MBZIRC 2017 and 2020 robotics competitions,\nand also in the DARPA SubT challenge. Each time, our team was able to secure\ntop places among the best competitors from all over the world.

The architecture theoretically\nconverges with the Free Energy Principle, potentially offering a formal account\nof how cognitive systems could maintain identity through prediction error\nminimization across physical and computational boundaries. The resulting\nframework aims to deliver a morally tractable cognitive infrastructure that\ncould maintain human-alignment through irreversible hardware constraints and\nidentity-bound epistemic mechanisms resistant to replication or subversion."

Key advantages include enhanced\nspectral and energy efficiency, expanded network coverage, and flexible\ndeployment. One of the main challenges in employing UAV-mounted IRS (UMI)\ntechnology is the random fluctuations of hovering UAVs. Focusing on this\nchallenge, this paper explores the capabilities of UMI with passive/active\nelements affected by UAV fluctuations in both horizontal and vertical angles,\nconsidering the three-dimensional (3D) radiation pattern of the IRS. The\nrelationship between UAV fluctuations and IRS pattern is investigated by taking\ninto account the random angular vibrations of UAVs. A tractable and closed-form\ndistribution function for the IRS pattern is derived, using linear\napproximation and by dividing it into several sectors. In addition, closed-form\nexpressions for outage probability (OP) are obtained using central limit\ntheorem (CLT) and Gamma approximation. The theoretical expressions are\nvalidated through Monte Carlo simulations. The findings indicate that the\nrandom fluctuations of hovering UAVs have a notable impact on the performance\nof UMI systems. To avoid link interruptions due to UAV instability, IRS should\nutilize fewer elements, even though this leads to a decrease in directivity. As\na result, unlike terrestrial IRS, incorporating more elements into aerial IRS\nsystems does not necessarily improve performance due to the fluctuations in\nUAV. Numerical results show that the OP can be minimized by selecting the\noptimal number of IRS elements and using active elements.",

We introduce CAPO (Cost-Aware Prompt\nOptimization), an algorithm that enhances prompt optimization efficiency by\nintegrating AutoML techniques. CAPO is an evolutionary approach with LLMs as\noperators, incorporating racing to save evaluations and multi-objective\noptimization to balance performance with prompt length. It jointly optimizes\ninstructions and few-shot examples while leveraging task descriptions for\nimproved robustness. Our extensive experiments across diverse datasets and LLMs\ndemonstrate that CAPO outperforms state-of-the-art discrete prompt optimization\nmethods in 11/15 cases with improvements up to 21%p. Our algorithm achieves\nbetter performances already with smaller budgets, saves evaluations through\nracing, and decreases average prompt length via a length penalty, making it\nboth cost-efficient and cost-aware. Even without few-shot examples, CAPO\noutperforms its competitors and generally remains robust to initial prompts.\nCAPO represents an important step toward making prompt optimization more\npowerful and accessible by improving cost-efficiency.",

Meanwhile, existing execution\nmechanisms struggle to balance complexity and stability, and their limited\naction space restricts their ability to handle diverse real-world tasks. To\naddress these limitations, we propose GoalAct, a novel agent framework that\nintroduces a continuously updated global planning mechanism and integrates a\nhierarchical execution strategy. GoalAct decomposes task execution into\nhigh-level skills, including searching, coding, writing and more, thereby\nreducing planning complexity while enhancing the agents' adaptability across\ndiverse task scenarios.

Aortic CT\nangiography (CTA) is the imaging protocol of choice in patients with suspected\nAAS. However, due to economic and workflow constraints in China, the majority\nof suspected patients initially undergo non-contrast CT as the initial imaging\ntesting, and CTA is reserved for those at higher risk. In this work, we present\nan artificial intelligence-based warning system, iAorta, using non-contrast CT\nfor AAS identification in China, which demonstrates remarkably high accuracy\nand provides clinicians with interpretable warnings. iAorta was evaluated\nthrough a comprehensive step-wise study. In the multi-center retrospective\nstudy (n = 20,750), iAorta achieved a mean area under the receiver operating\ncurve (AUC) of 0.958 (95% CI 0.950-0.967). In the large-scale real-world study\n(n = 137,525), iAorta demonstrated consistently high performance across various\nnon-contrast CT protocols, achieving a sensitivity of 0.913-0.942 and a\nspecificity of 0.991-0.993. In the prospective comparative study (n = 13,846),\niAorta demonstrated the capability to significantly shorten the time to correct\ndiagnostic pathway. For the prospective pilot deployment that we conducted,\niAorta correctly identified 21 out of 22 patients with AAS among 15,584\nconsecutive patients presenting with acute chest pain and under non-contrast CT\nprotocol in the emergency department (ED) and enabled the average diagnostic\ntime of these 21 AAS positive patients to be 102.1 (75-133) mins.

This paper investigates\nthe performance of zero-shot classifiers (ZSCs) on a multi-label industrial\ndataset. We focuse on classifying requirements according to a taxonomy designed\nto support requirements tracing. We compare multiple variants of ZSCs using\ndifferent embeddings, including 9 language models (LMs) with a reduced number\nof parameters (up to 3B), e.g., BERT, and 5 large LMs (LLMs) with a large\nnumber of parameters (up to 70B), e.g., Llama.

This aims to better capture the\nclassification's hierarchical nature and provides a more nuanced evaluation of\nhow far the results are from the ground truth. 1) The top-performing model on 5\nout of 6 output spaces is T5-xl, with maximum $F_\\beta$ = 0.78 and Dn = 0.04,\nwhile BERT base outperformed the other models in one case, with maximum\n$F_\\beta$ = 0.83 and Dn = 0.04. 2) LMs with smaller parameter size produce the\nbest classification results compared to LLMs. Thus, addressing the problem in\npractice is feasible as limited computing power is needed. 3) The model\narchitecture (autoencoding, autoregression, and sentence-to-sentence)\nsignificantly affects the classifier's performance.

Experiments\nshow that our method outperforms existing RAG models, achieving higher accuracy\non tasks requiring precise information retrieval. This advancement enhances the\nreliability of RAG systems, making them particularly beneficial for\napplications like fact-checking and multi-hop reasoning."

The primary\nalgorithms for generating DP synthetic data for FL applications require careful\nprompt engineering based on public information and/or iterative private client\nfeedback.

Our algorithm, Preference Optimization for\nPrivate Client Data (POPri) harnesses client feedback using preference\noptimization algorithms such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to\nfine-tune LLMs to generate high-quality DP synthetic data. To evaluate POPri,\nwe release LargeFedBench, a new federated text benchmark for uncontaminated LLM\nevaluations on federated client data. POPri substantially improves the utility\nof DP synthetic data relative to prior work on LargeFedBench datasets and an\nexisting benchmark from Xie et al. (2024).

We believe that MMLA will serve as a solid foundation\nfor exploring the potential of large language models in multimodal language\nanalysis and provide valuable resources to advance this field. The datasets and\ncode are open-sourced at https://github.com/thuiar/MMLA."

Achieving high service goodput -- i.e., meeting service level\nobjectives (SLOs) for pipeline latency, accuracy, and costs -- requires\neffective planning of operator placement, configuration, and resource\nallocation across infrastructure tiers. However, the diverse SLO requirements,\nvarying edge capabilities, and high query volumes create an enormous planning\nsearch space, rendering current solutions fundamentally limited for real-time\nserving and cost-efficient deployments.\n  This paper presents Circinus, an SLO-aware query planner for large-scale\ncompound AI workloads. Circinus novelly decomposes multi-query planning and\nmulti-dimensional SLO objectives while preserving global decision quality.
