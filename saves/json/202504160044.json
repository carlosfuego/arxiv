We demonstrate that a new covert channel\nattack is possible using this vulnerability.

In RAG scenarios, by defining each passage\nas a block, Block-attention enables us to reuse the KV states of passages that\nhave been seen before, thereby significantly reducing the latency and the\ncomputation overhead during inference. The implementation of Block-attention\ninvolves block segmentation, position re-encoding, and fine-tuning the LLM to\nadapt to the Block-attention mechanism.

While coalescing strided\naccesses is a natural solution, effectively gathering or scattering elements at\nfixed strides remains challenging. Naive approaches rely on high-overhead\ncrossbars that remap any byte between memory and registers, leading to physical\ndesign issues. Segment operations require row-column transpositions, typically\nhandled using either element-level in-place transposition (degrading\nperformance) or large buffer-based bulk transposition (incurring high area\noverhead). In this paper, we present EARTH, a novel vector memory access\narchitecture designed to overcome these challenges through shifting-based\noptimizations. For strided accesses, EARTH integrates specialized shift\nnetworks for gathering and scattering elements. After coalescing multiple\naccesses within the same cache line, data is routed between memory and\nregisters through the shifting network with minimal overhead. For segment\noperations, EARTH employs a shifted register bank enabling direct column-wise\naccess, eliminating dedicated segment buffers while providing high-performance,\nin-place bulk transposition. Implemented on FPGA with Chisel HDL based on an\nopen-source RISC-V vector unit, EARTH enhances performance for strided memory\naccesses, achieving 4x-8x speedups in benchmarks dominated by strided\noperations. Compared to conventional designs, EARTH reduces hardware area by 9%\nand power consumption by 41%, significantly advancing both performance and\nefficiency of vector processors.",

As demand for LLM services continues to grow, scaling\nthese systems to handle high request rates while meeting latency Service-Level\nObjectives (SLOs), referred to as effective throughput, becomes critical.\nHowever, existing systems often struggle to improve effective throughput,\nprimarily due to a significant decline in Time To First Token (TTFT) SLO\nattainment. We identify two major causes of this bottleneck: (1)\nmemory-intensive KV cache that limits batch size expansion under GPU memory\nconstraints, and (2) rigid batch composition enforced by the default\nFirst-Come-First-Serve scheduling policy. In this paper, we introduce\nApt-Serve, a scalable framework designed to enhance effective throughput in LLM\ninference serving. Apt-Serve features a new hybrid cache scheme that combines\nKV cache with a memory-efficient hidden cache for reusable input hidden state\nvectors, allowing large batch sizes and improving request concurrency. Based on\nthe hybrid cache, Apt-Serve employs an adaptive runtime scheduling mechanism\nthat dynamically optimizes batch composition. We formally define the adaptive\nscheduling optimization problem and propose an efficient algorithm with\ntheoretical guarantees. Extensive evaluations on three real-world datasets and\nLLMs ranging from 13B to 66B parameters demonstrate that Apt-Serve achieves up\nto 8.8x improvement in effective throughput compared to the state-of-the-art\ninference serving systems.",

Apt-Serve features a new hybrid cache scheme that combines\nKV cache with a memory-efficient hidden cache for reusable input hidden state\nvectors, allowing large batch sizes and improving request concurrency. Based on\nthe hybrid cache, Apt-Serve employs an adaptive runtime scheduling mechanism\nthat dynamically optimizes batch composition. We formally define the adaptive\nscheduling optimization problem and propose an efficient algorithm with\ntheoretical guarantees. Extensive evaluations on three real-world datasets and\nLLMs ranging from 13B to 66B parameters demonstrate that Apt-Serve achieves up\nto 8.8x improvement in effective throughput compared to the state-of-the-art\ninference serving systems."

We find that modern reasoning-capable LLMs can perform inference\nwith shared Key-Value cache out of the box, without additional fine-tuning."

A set of contents are stored at the the server where they\ncontinuously get updated. The local cache keeps copies, potentially stale, of a\nsubset of the contents. The users make content requests to the local cache\nwhich either can serve the local version if available or can fetch a fresh\nversion or can wait for additional requests before fetching and serving a fresh\nversion. Serving a stale version of a content incurs an age-of-version(AoV)\ndependent ageing cost, fetching it from the server incurs a fetching cost, and\nmaking a request wait incurs a per unit time waiting cost. We focus on the\noptimal actions subject to the cache capacity constraint at each decision\nepoch, aiming at minimizing the long term average cost. We pose the problem as\na Restless Multi-armed Bandit(RMAB) Problem and propose a Whittle index based\npolicy which is known to be asymptotically optimal. We explicitly characterize\nthe Whittle indices. We numerically evaluate the proposed policy and also\ncompare it to a greedy policy. We show that it is close to the optimal policy\nand substantially outperforms the exising policies.",

                    "value": "We consider a system with a local cache connected to a backend server and an\nend user population. A set of contents are stored at the the server where they\ncontinuously get updated. The local cache keeps copies, potentially stale, of a\nsubset of the contents. The users make content requests to the local cache\nwhich either can serve the local version if available or can fetch a fresh\nversion or can wait for additional requests before fetching and serving a fresh\nversion. Serving a stale version of a content incurs an age-of-version(AoV)\ndependent ageing cost, fetching it from the server incurs a fetching cost, and\nmaking a request wait incurs a per unit time waiting cost. We focus on the\noptimal actions subject to the cache capacity constraint at each decision\nepoch, aiming at minimizing the long term average cost. We pose the problem as\na Restless Multi-armed Bandit(RMAB) Problem and propose a Whittle index based\npolicy which is known to be asymptotically optimal. We explicitly characterize\nthe Whittle indices. We numerically evaluate the proposed policy and also\ncompare it to a greedy policy. We show that it is close to the optimal policy\nand substantially outperforms the exising policies."

                "summary": "The increasing complexity of autonomous systems has driven a shift to\nintegrated heterogeneous SoCs with real-time and safety demands. Ensuring\ndeterministic WCETs and low-latency for critical tasks requires minimizing\ninterference on shared resources like virtual memory. Existing techniques, such\nas software coloring and memory replication, introduce significant area and\nperformance overhead, especially with virtualized memory where address\ntranslation adds latency uncertainty. To address these limitations, we propose\nCVA6-VMRT, an extension of the open-source RISC-V CVA6 core, adding hardware\nsupport for predictability in virtual memory access with minimal area overhead.\nCVA6-VMRT features dynamically partitioned Translation Look-aside Buffers\n(TLBs) and hybrid L1 cache/scratchpad memory (SPM) functionality. It allows\nfine-grained per-thread control of resources, enabling the operating system to\nmanage TLB replacements, including static overwrites, to ensure single-cycle\naddress translation for critical memory regions.

                    "value": "The increasing complexity of autonomous systems has driven a shift to\nintegrated heterogeneous SoCs with real-time and safety demands. Ensuring\ndeterministic WCETs and low-latency for critical tasks requires minimizing\ninterference on shared resources like virtual memory. Existing techniques, such\nas software coloring and memory replication, introduce significant area and\nperformance overhead, especially with virtualized memory where address\ntranslation adds latency uncertainty. To address these limitations, we propose\nCVA6-VMRT, an extension of the open-source RISC-V CVA6 core, adding hardware\nsupport for predictability in virtual memory access with minimal area overhead.\nCVA6-VMRT features dynamically partitioned Translation Look-aside Buffers\n(TLBs) and hybrid L1 cache/scratchpad memory (SPM) functionality. It allows\nfine-grained per-thread control of resources, enabling the operating system to\nmanage TLB replacements, including static overwrites, to ensure single-cycle\naddress translation for critical memory regions. Additionally, CVA6-VMRT\nenables runtime partitioning of data and instruction caches into cache and SPM\nsections, providing low and predictable access times for critical data without\nimpacting other accesses. In a virtualized setting, CVA6-VMRT enhances\nexecution time determinism for critical guests by 94% during interference from\nnon-critical guests, with minimal impact on their average absolute execution\ntime compared to isolated execution of the critical guests only.

To speed up the prefill of the long\nLLM inputs, one can pre-compute the KV cache of a text and re-use the KV cache\nwhen the context is reused as the prefix of another LLM input. However, the\nreused text chunks are not always the input prefix, which makes precomputed KV\ncaches not directly usable since they ignore the text's cross-attention with\nthe preceding texts. Thus, the benefits of reusing KV caches remain largely\nunrealized.\n  This paper tackles just one challenge: when an LLM input contains multiple\ntext chunks, how to quickly combine their precomputed KV caches in order to\nachieve the same generation quality as the expensive full prefill (i.e.,\nwithout reusing KV cache)? This challenge naturally arises in\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG) where the input is supplemented with\nmultiple retrieved texts as the context. We present CacheBlend, a scheme that\nreuses the precomputed KV caches, regardless prefix or not, and selectively\nrecomputes the KV values of a small subset of tokens to partially update each\nreused KV cache. In the meantime, the small extra delay for recomputing some\ntokens can be pipelined with the retrieval of KV caches within the same job,\nallowing CacheBlend to store KV caches in slower devices with more storage\ncapacity while retrieving them without increasing the inference delay. By\ncomparing CacheBlend with the state-of-the-art KV cache reusing schemes on\nthree open-source LLMs of various sizes and four popular benchmark datasets of\ndifferent tasks, we show that CacheBlend reduces time-to-first-token (TTFT) by\n2.2-3.3x and increases the inference throughput by 2.8-5x from full KV\nrecompute without compromising generation quality.

This is unfortunate for large language model (LLM)\ntoken generation, which is heavily memory-bound. Previous work has proposed to\nleverage natural dynamic activation sparsity in ReLU-activated LLMs to reduce\neffective DRAM bandwidth per token. However, more recent LLMs use SwiGLU\ninstead of ReLU, which results in little inherent sparsity. While SwiGLU\nactivations can be pruned based on magnitude, the resulting sparsity patterns\nare difficult to predict, rendering previous approaches ineffective. To\ncircumvent this issue, our work introduces Dynamic Input Pruning (DIP): a\npredictor-free dynamic sparsification approach, which preserves accuracy with\nminimal fine-tuning. DIP can further use lightweight LoRA adapters to regain\nsome performance lost during sparsification. Lastly, we describe a novel\ncache-aware masking strategy, which considers the cache state and activation\nmagnitude to further increase cache hit rate, improving LLM token rate on\nmobile devices. DIP outperforms other methods in terms of accuracy, memory and\nthroughput trade-offs across simulated hardware settings.

This approach significantly improves large language models on\nknowledge-intensive tasks, including opendomain question answering and complex\nreasoning. Our framework integrates two complementary techniques:\nPolicy-Optimized RetrievalAugmented Generation (PORAG), which optimizes the use\nof retrieved information, and Adaptive Token-Layer Attention Scoring (ATLAS),\nwhich dynamically determines retrieval timing and content based on contextual\nneeds. Together, these techniques enhance both the utilization and relevance of\nretrieved content, improving factual accuracy and response quality. Designed as\na lightweight solution compatible with any Transformer-based LLM without\nrequiring additional training, our framework excels in knowledge-intensive\ntasks, boosting output accuracy in RAG settings.

This approach significantly improves large language models on\nknowledge-intensive tasks, including opendomain question answering and complex\nreasoning. Our framework integrates two complementary techniques:\nPolicy-Optimized RetrievalAugmented Generation (PORAG), which optimizes the use\nof retrieved information, and Adaptive Token-Layer Attention Scoring (ATLAS),\nwhich dynamically determines retrieval timing and content based on contextual\nneeds. Together, these techniques enhance both the utilization and relevance of\nretrieved content, improving factual accuracy and response quality. Designed as\na lightweight solution compatible with any Transformer-based LLM without\nrequiring additional training, our framework excels in knowledge-intensive\ntasks, boosting output accuracy in RAG settings.

Using systematic\nexperiments, we determined the fixed charge density (> 1013 cm-2), the\ndielectric/interface, and electric fields in the oxide of under flat-band\nconditions in the semiconductor. Low gate-to-drain leakage current of up to 5 x\n10-7 A/cm2 were obtained in the metal-oxide-semiconductor structures. In\nlateral metal-semiconductor-insulator test structures, breakdown voltage\nexceeding 1 kV was obtained with a channel sheet charge density of 1.27 x 1013\ncm-2. The effective peak electric field and average breakdown field were\nestimated to be > 4.27 MV/cm and 1.99 MV/cm, respectively. These findings\ndemonstrate the potential of Al2O2 integration for enhancing the breakdown\nperformance of UWBG AlGaN HEMTs."

On the one hand, slide\nelectrification generates electricity with possible applications on tiny\ndevices.

To find out how surfactants\naffect slide electrification, we measured drop charges of aqueous drops\ncontaining cationic CTAB, anionic SDS and neutral C8E3 sliding on different\nhydrophobic surfaces. The result is: addition of surfactant significantly\nreduces the spontaneous charging of moving water drops. Based on zeta potential\nmeasurements, confocal microscopy of deposited surface-active dyes and drop\nimpact studies, we propose that several factors contribute to this suppression\nof charge separation: (1) Surfactants tend to lower the contact angles, which\nreduces charge separation. (2) Surfactant adsorption at the solid-liquid\ninterface can reduce the density of primary ions, particularly for anionic\nsurfactants.

During decoding, SentenceKV generates\ntokens by selectively retrieving semantically relevant sentence-level KV\nentries, leveraging the semantic similarity between the prefilling-stage\nsemantic vectors and decoding-stage queries. This ensures efficient and\ncontextually accurate predictions, minimizing the loading of redundant or\nirrelevant data into GPU memory and significantly reducing memory overhead\nwhile maintaining stable inference latency, even for extremely long contexts.\nExtensive evaluations on benchmarks including PG-19, LongBench, and\nNeedle-In-A-Haystack demonstrate that SentenceKV significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods in both efficiency and memory usage, without\ncompromising model accuracy."

To address\nthis critical bottleneck, we propose AirCache, a novel KV cache compression\nmethod aimed at accelerating LVLMs inference.

Inspired by these findings, we introduce an elite observation\nwindow for assessing the importance of visual components in the KV cache,\nfocusing on stable inter-modal relevancy modeling with enhanced\nmulti-perspective consistency. Additionally, we develop an adaptive layer-wise\nbudget allocation strategy that capitalizes on the strength and skewness of\ntoken importance distribution, showcasing superior efficiency compared to\nuniform allocation. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple LVLMs and\nbenchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves comparable performance to the\nfull cache while retaining only 10% of visual KV cache, thereby reducing\ndecoding latency by 29% to 66% across various batch size and prompt length of\ninputs.

                "summary": "Transformer-based models have driven significant advancements in Multimodal\nLarge Language Models (MLLMs), yet their computational costs surge drastically\nwhen scaling resolution, training data, and model parameters. A key bottleneck\nstems from the proliferation of visual tokens required for fine-grained image\nunderstanding. We propose Skip-Vision, a unified framework addressing both\ntraining and inference inefficiencies in vision-language models. On top of\nconventional token compression approaches, our method introduces two\ncomplementary acceleration strategies.

To address these\nlimitations, we propose COSMIC (Clique-Oriented Semantic Multi-space\nIntegration for CLIP), a robust test-time adaptation framework that enhances\nadaptability through multi-granular, cross-modal semantic caching and\ngraph-based querying mechanisms. Our framework introduces two key innovations:\nDual Semantics Graph (DSG) and Clique Guided Hyper-class (CGH). The Dual\nSemantics Graph constructs complementary semantic spaces by incorporating\ntextual features, coarse-grained CLIP features, and fine-grained DINOv2\nfeatures to capture rich semantic relationships. Building upon these dual\ngraphs, the Clique Guided Hyper-class component leverages structured class\nrelationships to enhance prediction robustness through correlated class\nselection. Extensive experiments demonstrate COSMIC's superior performance\nacross multiple benchmarks, achieving significant improvements over\nstate-of-the-art methods: 15.81% gain on out-of-distribution tasks and 5.33% on\ncross-domain generation with CLIP RN-50.

During the autoregressive decoding phase, we use\nPQ codes and centroids to approximately identify important preceding tokens,\nthen fetch the corresponding key-value pairs for self-attention computation.\nThrough meticulous design of overlapping and caching, we minimize any\nadditional computation and communication overhead during both phases.

                "summary": "Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success across a range\nof multimodal tasks; however, their practical deployment is often constrained\nby high computational costs and prolonged inference times. Since the vision\nmodality typically carries more information than the text modality, compressing\nvisual prompts offers a promising solution to alleviate these challenges.\nExisting approaches predominantly focus on refining model architectures or\ndirectly reducing the number of visual tokens. However, these methods often\ncompromise inference performance due to a lack of consideration for the unique\nspatial and temporal characteristics of visual data.

Since the vision\nmodality typically carries more information than the text modality, compressing\nvisual prompts offers a promising solution to alleviate these challenges.\nExisting approaches predominantly focus on refining model architectures or\ndirectly reducing the number of visual tokens. However, these methods often\ncompromise inference performance due to a lack of consideration for the unique\nspatial and temporal characteristics of visual data.

In\nthis work, we propose a dynamic long video encoding method utilizing the\ntemporal relationship between frames, named Temporal Dynamic Context (TDC).\nFirstly, we segment the video into semantically consistent scenes based on\ninter-frame similarities, then encode each frame into tokens using visual-audio\nencoders.

PersuSafety covers 6 diverse unethical persuasion topics and\n15 common unethical strategies. Through extensive experiments across 8 widely\nused LLMs, we observe significant safety concerns in most LLMs, including\nfailing to identify harmful persuasion tasks and leveraging various unethical\npersuasion strategies.

These tailored models are increasingly made\navailable through dedicated marketplaces, such as OpenAI's GPT Store. However,\ntheir black-box nature introduces significant safety and compliance risks. In\nthis work, we present a scalable framework for the automated evaluation of\nCustom GPTs against OpenAI's usage policies, which define the permissible\nbehaviors of these systems. Our framework integrates three core components: (1)\nautomated discovery and data collection of models from the GPT store, (2) a\nred-teaming prompt generator tailored to specific policy categories and the\ncharacteristics of each target GPT, and (3) an LLM-as-a-judge technique to\nanalyze each prompt-response pair for potential policy violations. We validate\nour framework with a manually annotated ground truth, and evaluate it through a\nlarge-scale study with 782 Custom GPTs across three categories: Romantic,\nCybersecurity, and Academic GPTs. Our manual annotation process achieved an F1\nscore of 0.975 in identifying policy violations, confirming the reliability of\nthe framework's assessments. The results reveal that 58.7% of the analyzed\nmodels exhibit indications of non-compliance, exposing weaknesses in the GPT\nstore's review and approval processes. Furthermore, our findings indicate that\na model's popularity does not correlate with compliance, and non-compliance\nissues largely stem from behaviors inherited from base models rather than\nuser-driven customizations. We believe this approach is extendable to other\nchatbot platforms and policy domains, improving LLM-based systems safety.",

In this paper, we derive an\nasymptotic expansion of the local likelihood ratios of selection models. We\nshow that under mild regularity conditions, they behave asymptotically like a\nsequence of Gaussian selection models. This generalizes the Local Asymptotic\nNormality framework of Le Cam (1960) to a class of non-regular models, and\nindicates a notion of local asymptotic selective normality as the appropriate\nsimplifying theoretical framework for analysis of selective inference.\nFurthermore, we establish practical consequences for Bayesian selective\ninference. Specifically, we derive the asymptotic shape of Bayesian posterior\ndistributions constructed from selection models, and show that they will\ntypically be significantly miscalibrated in a frequentist sense, demonstrating\nthat the familiar asymptotic equivalence between Bayesian and frequentist\napproaches does not hold under selection.",

In this paper, we derive an\nasymptotic expansion of the local likelihood ratios of selection models. We\nshow that under mild regularity conditions, they behave asymptotically like a\nsequence of Gaussian selection models. This generalizes the Local Asymptotic\nNormality framework of Le Cam (1960) to a class of non-regular models, and\nindicates a notion of local asymptotic selective normality as the appropriate\nsimplifying theoretical framework for analysis of selective inference.\nFurthermore, we establish practical consequences for Bayesian selective\ninference. Specifically, we derive the asymptotic shape of Bayesian posterior\ndistributions constructed from selection models, and show that they will\ntypically be significantly miscalibrated in a frequentist sense, demonstrating\nthat the familiar asymptotic equivalence between Bayesian and frequentist\napproaches does not hold under selection."

MultiLoKo consists of three partitions: a main partition\nconsisting of 500 questions per language, separately sourced to be locally\nrelevant to the specific language, and two translated partitions, containing\nhuman-authored translations from 30 non-English languages to English and vice\nversa. For comparison, we also release corresponding machine-authored\ntranslations. The data is equally distributed over two splits: a dev split and\na blind, out-of-distribution test split. MultiLoKo can be used to study a\nvariety of questions regarding the multilinguality of LLMs as well as\nmeta-questions about multilingual benchmark creation. We compute MultiLoKo\nscores for 11 base and chat models marketed to be multilingual and study their\naverage performance, their performance parity across languages, how much their\nability to answer questions depends on the question language, and which\nlanguages are most difficult. None of the models we studied performs well on\nMultiLoKo, as indicated by low average scores as well as large differences\nbetween the best and worst scoring languages. Furthermore, we find a\nsubstantial effect of the question language, indicating sub-optimal knowledge\ntransfer between languages. Lastly, we find that using local vs\nEnglish-translated data can result in differences more than 20 points for the\nbest performing models, drastically change the estimated difficulty of some\nlanguages. For using machines instead of human translations, we find a weaker\neffect on ordering of language difficulty, a larger difference in model\nrankings, and a substantial drop in estimated performance for all models.",

In this work, we introduce the forecasting problem from\ntextual time series, where timestamped clinical findings--extracted via an\nLLM-assisted annotation pipeline--serve as the primary input for prediction. We\nsystematically evaluate a diverse suite of models, including fine-tuned\ndecoder-based large language models and encoder-based transformers, on tasks of\nevent occurrence prediction, temporal ordering, and survival analysis. Our\nexperiments reveal that encoder-based models consistently achieve higher F1\nscores and superior temporal concordance for short- and long-horizon event\nforecasting, while fine-tuned masking approaches enhance ranking performance.\nIn contrast, instruction-tuned decoder models demonstrate a relative advantage\nin survival analysis, especially in early prognosis settings. Our sensitivity\nanalyses further demonstrate the importance of time ordering, which requires\nclinical time series construction, as compared to text ordering, the format of\nthe text inputs that LLMs are classically trained on.

In this work, we introduce the forecasting problem from\ntextual time series, where timestamped clinical findings--extracted via an\nLLM-assisted annotation pipeline--serve as the primary input for prediction. We\nsystematically evaluate a diverse suite of models, including fine-tuned\ndecoder-based large language models and encoder-based transformers, on tasks of\nevent occurrence prediction, temporal ordering, and survival analysis. Our\nexperiments reveal that encoder-based models consistently achieve higher F1\nscores and superior temporal concordance for short- and long-horizon event\nforecasting, while fine-tuned masking approaches enhance ranking performance.\nIn contrast, instruction-tuned decoder models demonstrate a relative advantage\nin survival analysis, especially in early prognosis settings. Our sensitivity\nanalyses further demonstrate the importance of time ordering, which requires\nclinical time series construction, as compared to text ordering, the format of\nthe text inputs that LLMs are classically trained on. This highlights the\nadditional benefit that can be ascertained from time-ordered corpora, with\nimplications for temporal tasks in the era of widespread LLM use."

In this paper, we propose Heimdall, the long CoT verification LLM\nthat can accurately judge the correctness of solutions. With pure reinforcement\nlearning, we boost the verification accuracy from 62.5% to 94.5% on competitive\nmath problems. By scaling with repeated sampling, the accuracy further\nincreases to 97.5%.

Furthermore, we\npropose Pessimistic Verification to extend the functionality of Heimdall to\nscaling up the problem solving. It calls Heimdall to judge the solutions from a\nsolver model and based on the pessimistic principle, selects the most likely\ncorrect solution with the least uncertainty.

The core of R1 lies in its\nrule-based reward formulation, which leverages tasks with deterministic\nground-truth answers to enable precise and stable reward computation. In the\nvisual domain, we similarly observe that a wide range of visual understanding\ntasks are inherently equipped with well-defined ground-truth annotations. This\nproperty makes them naturally compatible with rule-based reward mechanisms.\nMotivated by this observation, we investigate the extension of R1-style\nreinforcement learning to Vision-Language Models (VLMs), aiming to enhance\ntheir visual reasoning capabilities. To this end, we develop VLM-R1, a\ndedicated framework designed to harness RL for improving VLMs' performance on\ngeneral vision-language tasks. Using this framework, we further explore the\nfeasibility of applying RL to visual domain. Experimental results indicate that\nthe RL-based model not only delivers competitive performance on visual\nunderstanding tasks but also surpasses Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) in\ngeneralization ability. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies\nthat uncover a series of noteworthy insights, including the presence of reward\nhacking in object detection, the emergence of the \"OD aha moment\", the impact\nof training data quality, and the scaling behavior of RL across different model\nsizes.

A major contributor to\nthe success of such methods is their robustness in the face of non-smooth and\ndiscontinuous optimization landscapes that are characteristic of contact\ninteractions, yet zeroth-order methods remain computationally inefficient. It\nis therefore desirable to develop methods for perception, planning and control\nin contact-rich settings that can achieve further efficiency by making use of\nfirst and second order information (i.e., gradients and Hessians). To\nfacilitate this, we present a joint formulation of collision detection and\ncontact modelling which, compared to existing differentiable simulation\napproaches, provides the following benefits: i) it results in forward and\ninverse dynamics that are entirely analytical (i.e. do not require solving\noptimization or root-finding problems with iterative methods) and smooth (i.e.\ntwice differentiable), ii) it supports arbitrary collision geometries without\nneeding a convex decomposition, and iii) its runtime is independent of the\nnumber of contacts. Through simulation experiments, we demonstrate the validity\nof the proposed formulation as a \"physics for inference\" that can facilitate\nfuture development of efficient methods to generate intelligent contact-rich\nbehavior.",

                    "value": "Generating intelligent robot behavior in contact-rich settings is a research\nproblem where zeroth-order methods currently prevail. A major contributor to\nthe success of such methods is their robustness in the face of non-smooth and\ndiscontinuous optimization landscapes that are characteristic of contact\ninteractions, yet zeroth-order methods remain computationally inefficient. It\nis therefore desirable to develop methods for perception, planning and control\nin contact-rich settings that can achieve further efficiency by making use of\nfirst and second order information (i.e., gradients and Hessians). To\nfacilitate this, we present a joint formulation of collision detection and\ncontact modelling which, compared to existing differentiable simulation\napproaches, provides the following benefits: i) it results in forward and\ninverse dynamics that are entirely analytical (i.e. do not require solving\noptimization or root-finding problems with iterative methods) and smooth (i.e.\ntwice differentiable), ii) it supports arbitrary collision geometries without\nneeding a convex decomposition, and iii) its runtime is independent of the\nnumber of contacts. Through simulation experiments, we demonstrate the validity\nof the proposed formulation as a \"physics for inference\" that can facilitate\nfuture development of efficient methods to generate intelligent contact-rich\nbehavior."

Rather than repairing the\ngenerated code, an alternative way is to address the underlying failures of\nmodels. LM repair offers a lightweight solution to this challenge: it requires\nminimal data, reduces computational costs, and reduces the side effects. Unlike\nretraining, LM repair focuses on applying tailored updates to targeted neurons,\nmaking it ideal for scenarios with limited resources, high-performance demands,\nor strict safety requirements. In this paper, we propose \\ul{S}emantic\n\\ul{T}argeting for \\ul{A}nalytical \\ul{R}epair (\\textsc{STAR}), a pioneering\nand novel semantic-based optimization approach for repairing LLMs.\n\\textsc{STAR} realizes main operations in LM repair methods in an optimization\nprocess, including locating ``buggy neurons'', solving ``neuron patches'', and\npatching ``buggy neurons''. Correspondingly, it computes the deltas of weight\nmatrix as the prior information to guide optimization; and attributes the\ntargeted layers and neurons leveraging statistical insights. The neuron patches\nare computed with a solid semantic-based analytical formula, which directly\nbridges the changes to logits with the deltas of neurons, by steering latent\nrepresentations. Compared to the prior work of LM repair (\\textsc{MINT}) and\noptimization methods (\\textsc{SGD}), \\textsc{STAR} integrates their strengths\nwhile mitigating their limitations. \\textsc{STAR} supports solving multiple\nfailures together, significantly improving the usefulness.

In Paper II, we further improved its noise\ncharacterization performance by replacing its null stream with a more stable\nchannel, $C^{12}_3$. In this work, we present a novel TDI scheme, PD4L, which\nfeatures minimal null frequencies and a reduced time span. Unlike the hybrid\nRelay or the second-generation Michelson which require delays up to $7L$ (with\n$L$ denoting the light-travel time between spacecraft), the PD4L uses delays no\nlonger than $3L$, corresponding to a total time span of $4L$. This compact\nstructure yields several advantages: 1) reducing data margins at segment\nboundaries, 2) mitigating aliasing in the high frequency regime, and 3)\nshortening the signal tails caused by long span. To evaluate PD4L's\nperformance, we perform parameter inference for chirping GW signals from\ncoalescing MBBHs. Our results show that the PD4L outperforms the hybrid Relay\nin the high frequency band and performs comparably at low frequencies.\nMoreover, PD4L's null stream exhibits the same minimal null frequencies as its\nscience channels and maintains a more stable noise spectrum than $C^{12}_3$.\nWhile the noise spectra of its science channels are slightly less stable than\nthose of the hybrid Relay, PD4L can still reliably infer noise parameters for\ndata durations of up to four months. These results suggest PD4L as a promising\nTDI scheme, particularly well-suited for analyzing GW signal in the\nhigher-frequency domain.",

In this work, we introduce MT-R1-Zero, the first\nopen-source adaptation of the R1-Zero RL framework for MT without supervised\nfine-tuning or cold-start.

The emission function, which expresses the line integrated\nintensity as a function of the gas column density, is an empirical fit to high\nresolution (< 0.05 pc) multi-line observations of the Orion B molecular cloud.\nThe column density PDF is assumed to be parametric, composed of a lognormal\ndistribution at moderate column densities and a power law distribution at\nhigher column densities. To estimate the sub-beam column density PDF, the\nemission model is combined with a Bayesian inversion algorithm (the Beetroots\ncode), which takes account of thermal noise and calibration errors. We validate\nour method by demonstrating that it recovers the true column density PDF of the\nOrion B cloud, reproducing the observed emission line integrated intensities.\nWe apply the method to 12CO(J=1-0), 13CO(J=1-0), C18O(J=1-0), HCN(J=1-0),\nHCO+(J=1-0) and N2H+(J=1-0) observations of a 700 x 700 pc2 field of view (FoV)\nin the nearby galaxy M51. On average, the model reproduces the observed\nintensities within 30%. The column density PDFs obtained for the spiral arm\nregion within our test FoV are dominated by a power-law tail at high column\ndensities, with slopes that are consistent with gravitational collapse. Outside\nthe spiral arm, the column density PDFs are predominantly lognormal, consistent\nwith supersonic isothermal turbulence.

Aligning with the recent breakthrough of the Shallow Brain\nHypothesis (SBH) in neuroscience and the mixture of experts in model\nsparsification, we conceptualize each LLM layer as an expert and propose a\nMixture-of-Layers Vision-Language-Action model (MoLe-VLA, or simply MoLe)\narchitecture for dynamic LLM layer activation. We introduce a Spatial-Temporal\nAware Router (STAR) for MoLe to selectively activate only parts of the layers\nbased on the robot's current state, mimicking the brain's distinct signal\npathways specialized for cognition and causal reasoning. Additionally, to\ncompensate for the cognitive ability of LLMs lost in MoLe, we devise a\nCognition Self-Knowledge Distillation (CogKD) framework. CogKD enhances the\nunderstanding of task demands and improves the generation of task-relevant\naction sequences by leveraging cognitive features. Extensive experiments\nconducted in both RLBench simulation and real-world environments demonstrate\nthe superiority of MoLe-VLA in both efficiency and performance.

                "summary": "We introduce InternVL3, a significant advancement in the InternVL series\nfeaturing a native multimodal pre-training paradigm. Rather than adapting a\ntext-only large language model (LLM) into a multimodal large language model\n(MLLM) that supports visual inputs, InternVL3 jointly acquires multimodal and\nlinguistic capabilities from both diverse multimodal data and pure-text corpora\nduring a single pre-training stage. This unified training paradigm effectively\naddresses the complexities and alignment challenges commonly encountered in\nconventional post-hoc training pipelines for MLLMs. To further improve\nperformance and scalability, InternVL3 incorporates variable visual position\nencoding (V2PE) to support extended multimodal contexts, employs advanced\npost-training techniques such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and mixed\npreference optimization (MPO), and adopts test-time scaling strategies\nalongside an optimized training infrastructure. Extensive empirical evaluations\ndemonstrate that InternVL3 delivers superior performance across a wide range of\nmulti-modal tasks. In particular, InternVL3-78B achieves a score of 72.2 on the\nMMMU benchmark, setting a new state-of-the-art among open-source MLLMs. Its\ncapabilities remain highly competitive with leading proprietary models,\nincluding ChatGPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.5 Pro, while also\nmaintaining strong pure-language proficiency. In pursuit of open-science\nprinciples, we will publicly release both the training data and model weights\nto foster further research and development in next-generation MLLMs.",

                    "value": "We introduce InternVL3, a significant advancement in the InternVL series\nfeaturing a native multimodal pre-training paradigm. Rather than adapting a\ntext-only large language model (LLM) into a multimodal large language model\n(MLLM) that supports visual inputs, InternVL3 jointly acquires multimodal and\nlinguistic capabilities from both diverse multimodal data and pure-text corpora\nduring a single pre-training stage. This unified training paradigm effectively\naddresses the complexities and alignment challenges commonly encountered in\nconventional post-hoc training pipelines for MLLMs. To further improve\nperformance and scalability, InternVL3 incorporates variable visual position\nencoding (V2PE) to support extended multimodal contexts, employs advanced\npost-training techniques such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and mixed\npreference optimization (MPO), and adopts test-time scaling strategies\nalongside an optimized training infrastructure. Extensive empirical evaluations\ndemonstrate that InternVL3 delivers superior performance across a wide range of\nmulti-modal tasks. In particular, InternVL3-78B achieves a score of 72.2 on the\nMMMU benchmark, setting a new state-of-the-art among open-source MLLMs. Its\ncapabilities remain highly competitive with leading proprietary models,\nincluding ChatGPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.5 Pro, while also\nmaintaining strong pure-language proficiency. In pursuit of open-science\nprinciples, we will publicly release both the training data and model weights\nto foster further research and development in next-generation MLLMs."

However, existing models still struggle\nwith long video processing due to the context length constraint of LLMs and the\nvast amount of information within the video. Although some recent methods are\ndesigned for long video understanding, they often lose crucial information\nduring token compression and struggle with additional modality like audio. In\nthis work, we propose a dynamic long video encoding method utilizing the\ntemporal relationship between frames, named Temporal Dynamic Context (TDC).\nFirstly, we segment the video into semantically consistent scenes based on\ninter-frame similarities, then encode each frame into tokens using visual-audio\nencoders. Secondly, we propose a novel temporal context compressor to reduce\nthe number of tokens within each segment. Specifically, we employ a query-based\nTransformer to aggregate video, audio, and instruction text tokens into a\nlimited set of temporal context tokens. Finally, we feed the static frame\ntokens and the temporal context tokens into the LLM for video understanding.\nFurthermore, to handle extremely long videos, we propose a training-free\nchain-of-thought strategy that progressively extracts answers from multiple\nvideo segments. These intermediate answers serve as part of the reasoning\nprocess and contribute to the final answer. We conduct extensive experiments on\ngeneral video understanding and audio-video understanding benchmarks, where our\nmethod demonstrates strong performance.

PersuSafety covers 6 diverse unethical persuasion topics and\n15 common unethical strategies. Through extensive experiments across 8 widely\nused LLMs, we observe significant safety concerns in most LLMs, including\nfailing to identify harmful persuasion tasks and leveraging various unethical\npersuasion strategies.

                "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained unprecedented prominence, achieving\nwidespread adoption across diverse domains and integrating deeply into society.\nThe capability to fine-tune general-purpose LLMs, such as Generative\nPre-trained Transformers (GPT), for specific tasks has facilitated the\nemergence of numerous Custom GPTs. These tailored models are increasingly made\navailable through dedicated marketplaces, such as OpenAI's GPT Store. However,\ntheir black-box nature introduces significant safety and compliance risks. In\nthis work, we present a scalable framework for the automated evaluation of\nCustom GPTs against OpenAI's usage policies, which define the permissible\nbehaviors of these systems. Our framework integrates three core components: (1)\nautomated discovery and data collection of models from the GPT store, (2) a\nred-teaming prompt generator tailored to specific policy categories and the\ncharacteristics of each target GPT, and (3) an LLM-as-a-judge technique to\nanalyze each prompt-response pair for potential policy violations. We validate\nour framework with a manually annotated ground truth, and evaluate it through a\nlarge-scale study with 782 Custom GPTs across three categories: Romantic,\nCybersecurity, and Academic GPTs. Our manual annotation process achieved an F1\nscore of 0.975 in identifying policy violations, confirming the reliability of\nthe framework's assessments. The results reveal that 58.7% of the analyzed\nmodels exhibit indications of non-compliance, exposing weaknesses in the GPT\nstore's review and approval processes.

                    "value": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained unprecedented prominence, achieving\nwidespread adoption across diverse domains and integrating deeply into society.\nThe capability to fine-tune general-purpose LLMs, such as Generative\nPre-trained Transformers (GPT), for specific tasks has facilitated the\nemergence of numerous Custom GPTs. These tailored models are increasingly made\navailable through dedicated marketplaces, such as OpenAI's GPT Store. However,\ntheir black-box nature introduces significant safety and compliance risks. In\nthis work, we present a scalable framework for the automated evaluation of\nCustom GPTs against OpenAI's usage policies, which define the permissible\nbehaviors of these systems. Our framework integrates three core components: (1)\nautomated discovery and data collection of models from the GPT store, (2) a\nred-teaming prompt generator tailored to specific policy categories and the\ncharacteristics of each target GPT, and (3) an LLM-as-a-judge technique to\nanalyze each prompt-response pair for potential policy violations. We validate\nour framework with a manually annotated ground truth, and evaluate it through a\nlarge-scale study with 782 Custom GPTs across three categories: Romantic,\nCybersecurity, and Academic GPTs. Our manual annotation process achieved an F1\nscore of 0.975 in identifying policy violations, confirming the reliability of\nthe framework's assessments. The results reveal that 58.7% of the analyzed\nmodels exhibit indications of non-compliance, exposing weaknesses in the GPT\nstore's review and approval processes. Furthermore, our findings indicate that\na model's popularity does not correlate with compliance, and non-compliance\nissues largely stem from behaviors inherited from base models rather than\nuser-driven customizations. We believe this approach is extendable to other\nchatbot platforms and policy domains, improving LLM-based systems safety."

                "summary": "Crafting a marketing message (copy), or copywriting is a challenging\ngeneration task, as the copy must adhere to various constraints. Copy creation\nis inherently iterative for humans, starting with an initial draft followed by\nsuccessive refinements. However, manual copy creation is time-consuming and\nexpensive, resulting in only a few copies for each use case. This limitation\nrestricts our ability to personalize content to customers. Contrary to the\nmanual approach, LLMs can generate copies quickly, but the generated content\ndoes not consistently meet all the constraints on the first attempt (similar to\nhumans). While recent studies have shown promise in improving constrained\ngeneration through iterative refinement, they have primarily addressed tasks\nwith only a few simple constraints. Consequently, the effectiveness of\niterative refinement for tasks such as copy generation, which involves many\nintricate constraints, remains unclear. To address this gap, we propose an\nLLM-based end-to-end framework for scalable copy generation using iterative\nrefinement. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to address\nmultiple challenging constraints simultaneously in copy generation. Examples of\nthese constraints include length, topics, keywords, preferred lexical ordering,\nand tone of voice. We demonstrate the performance of our framework by creating\ncopies for e-commerce banners for three different use cases of varying\ncomplexity.

                    "value": "Crafting a marketing message (copy), or copywriting is a challenging\ngeneration task, as the copy must adhere to various constraints. Copy creation\nis inherently iterative for humans, starting with an initial draft followed by\nsuccessive refinements. However, manual copy creation is time-consuming and\nexpensive, resulting in only a few copies for each use case. This limitation\nrestricts our ability to personalize content to customers. Contrary to the\nmanual approach, LLMs can generate copies quickly, but the generated content\ndoes not consistently meet all the constraints on the first attempt (similar to\nhumans). While recent studies have shown promise in improving constrained\ngeneration through iterative refinement, they have primarily addressed tasks\nwith only a few simple constraints. Consequently, the effectiveness of\niterative refinement for tasks such as copy generation, which involves many\nintricate constraints, remains unclear. To address this gap, we propose an\nLLM-based end-to-end framework for scalable copy generation using iterative\nrefinement. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to address\nmultiple challenging constraints simultaneously in copy generation. Examples of\nthese constraints include length, topics, keywords, preferred lexical ordering,\nand tone of voice. We demonstrate the performance of our framework by creating\ncopies for e-commerce banners for three different use cases of varying\ncomplexity. Our results show that iterative refinement increases the copy\nsuccess rate by $16.25-35.91$% across use cases. Furthermore, the copies\ngenerated using our approach outperformed manually created content in multiple\npilot studies using a multi-armed bandit framework.

In this paper, we emphasize the critical importance of\nintegrating fine-grained reasoning into video evaluation, and we propose\n$\\textbf{F}$ing$\\textbf{ER}$, a novel entity-level reasoning evaluation\nframework that first automatically generates $\\textbf{F}$ine-grained\n$\\textbf{E}$ntity-level questions, and then answers those questions by a\n$\\textbf{R}$easoning model with scores, which can be subsequently weighted\nsummed to an overall score for different applications. Specifically, we\nleverage LLMs to derive entity-level questions across five distinct\nperspectives, which (i) often focus on some specific entities of the content,\nthereby making answering or scoring much easier by MLLMs, and (ii) are more\ninterpretable. Then we construct a FingER dataset, consisting of approximately\n3.3k videos and corresponding 60k fine-grained QA annotations, each with\ndetailed reasons. Based on that, we further investigate various training\nprotocols to best incentivize the reasoning capability of MLLMs for correct\nanswer prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that a reasoning model\ntrained using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a cold-start\nstrategy achieves the best performance. Notably, our model surpasses existing\nmethods by a relative margin of $11.8\\%$ on GenAI-Bench and $5.5\\%$ on\nMonetBench with only 3.3k training videos, which is at most one-tenth of the\ntraining samples utilized by other methods.

MultiLoKo consists of three partitions: a main partition\nconsisting of 500 questions per language, separately sourced to be locally\nrelevant to the specific language, and two translated partitions, containing\nhuman-authored translations from 30 non-English languages to English and vice\nversa. For comparison, we also release corresponding machine-authored\ntranslations. The data is equally distributed over two splits: a dev split and\na blind, out-of-distribution test split. MultiLoKo can be used to study a\nvariety of questions regarding the multilinguality of LLMs as well as\nmeta-questions about multilingual benchmark creation. We compute MultiLoKo\nscores for 11 base and chat models marketed to be multilingual and study their\naverage performance, their performance parity across languages, how much their\nability to answer questions depends on the question language, and which\nlanguages are most difficult. None of the models we studied performs well on\nMultiLoKo, as indicated by low average scores as well as large differences\nbetween the best and worst scoring languages. Furthermore, we find a\nsubstantial effect of the question language, indicating sub-optimal knowledge\ntransfer between languages. Lastly, we find that using local vs\nEnglish-translated data can result in differences more than 20 points for the\nbest performing models, drastically change the estimated difficulty of some\nlanguages.

In this work, we introduce the forecasting problem from\ntextual time series, where timestamped clinical findings--extracted via an\nLLM-assisted annotation pipeline--serve as the primary input for prediction. We\nsystematically evaluate a diverse suite of models, including fine-tuned\ndecoder-based large language models and encoder-based transformers, on tasks of\nevent occurrence prediction, temporal ordering, and survival analysis. Our\nexperiments reveal that encoder-based models consistently achieve higher F1\nscores and superior temporal concordance for short- and long-horizon event\nforecasting, while fine-tuned masking approaches enhance ranking performance.\nIn contrast, instruction-tuned decoder models demonstrate a relative advantage\nin survival analysis, especially in early prognosis settings. Our sensitivity\nanalyses further demonstrate the importance of time ordering, which requires\nclinical time series construction, as compared to text ordering, the format of\nthe text inputs that LLMs are classically trained on. This highlights the\nadditional benefit that can be ascertained from time-ordered corpora, with\nimplications for temporal tasks in the era of widespread LLM use.",

In this work, we introduce the forecasting problem from\ntextual time series, where timestamped clinical findings--extracted via an\nLLM-assisted annotation pipeline--serve as the primary input for prediction. We\nsystematically evaluate a diverse suite of models, including fine-tuned\ndecoder-based large language models and encoder-based transformers, on tasks of\nevent occurrence prediction, temporal ordering, and survival analysis. Our\nexperiments reveal that encoder-based models consistently achieve higher F1\nscores and superior temporal concordance for short- and long-horizon event\nforecasting, while fine-tuned masking approaches enhance ranking performance.\nIn contrast, instruction-tuned decoder models demonstrate a relative advantage\nin survival analysis, especially in early prognosis settings. Our sensitivity\nanalyses further demonstrate the importance of time ordering, which requires\nclinical time series construction, as compared to text ordering, the format of\nthe text inputs that LLMs are classically trained on. This highlights the\nadditional benefit that can be ascertained from time-ordered corpora, with\nimplications for temporal tasks in the era of widespread LLM use."

We leverage large language models (LLMs) as teacher\nmodels to generate these explanations and distill this knowledge into smaller,\nopenly available student models. Our student models are trained to generate\nmeaningful reasoning and rerank documents, achieving competitive performance\nacross multiple datasets, including MSMARCO and BRIGHT. Experiments demonstrate\nthat R2R not only improves reranking accuracy but also provides valuable\ninsights into the decision-making process. By offering a structured and\ninterpretable solution with openly accessible resources, R2R aims to bridge the\ngap between effectiveness and transparency in information retrieval, fostering\nreproducibility and further research in the field."

However, the high cost and limited flexibility of\nPCIe switches hinder their widespread adoption beyond specialized datacenter\nuse cases.\n  This paper argues that PCIe device pooling can be effectively implemented in\nsoftware using CXL memory pools. CXL memory pools improve memory utilization\nand already have positive return on investment. We find that, once CXL pools\nare in place, they can serve as a building block for pooling any kind of PCIe\ndevice. We demonstrate that PCIe devices can directly use CXL memory as I/O\nbuffers without device modifications, which enables routing PCIe traffic\nthrough CXL pool memory. This software-based approach is deployable on today's\nhardware and is more flexible than hardware PCIe switches.

Despite the\nmajor attempts to analyze personality expression through output-based\nevaluations, little is known about how such traits are internally encoded\nwithin LLM parameters. In this paper, we introduce a layer-wise probing\nframework to systematically investigate the layer-wise capability of LLMs in\nencoding personality for responding. We conduct probing experiments on 11\nopen-source LLMs over the PersonalityEdit benchmark and find that LLMs\npredominantly encode personality for responding in their middle and upper\nlayers, with instruction-tuned models demonstrating a slightly clearer\nseparation of personality traits. Furthermore, by interpreting the trained\nprobing hyperplane as a layer-wise boundary for each personality category, we\npropose a layer-wise perturbation method to edit the personality expressed by\nLLMs during inference. Our results show that even when the prompt explicitly\nspecifies a particular personality, our method can still successfully alter the\nresponse personality of LLMs. Interestingly, the difficulty of converting\nbetween certain personality traits varies substantially, which aligns with the\nrepresentational distances in our probing experiments. Finally, we conduct a\ncomprehensive MMLU benchmark evaluation and time overhead analysis,\ndemonstrating that our proposed personality editing method incurs only minimal\ndegradation in general capabilities while maintaining low training costs and\nacceptable inference latency. Our code is publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/universe-sky/probing-then-editing-personality.",

Vulnerability datasets, often derived from the National\nVulnerability Database (NVD) or directly from GitHub, are essential for\ntraining machine learning models to detect these security flaws. However, these\ndatasets frequently suffer from significant noise, typically 40% to 75%, due\nprimarily to the automatic and indiscriminate labeling of all changes in\nvulnerability-fixing commits (VFCs) as vulnerability-related. This\nmisclassification occurs because not all changes in a commit aimed at fixing\nvulnerabilities pertain to security threats; many are routine updates like bug\nfixes or test improvements.\n  This paper introduces the first methodology that uses the Large Language\nModel (LLM) with a heuristic enhancement to automatically identify\nvulnerability-fixing changes from VFCs, achieving an F1-score of 0.82.\nVulSifter was applied to a large-scale study, where we conducted a crawl of\n127,063 repositories on GitHub, resulting in the acquisition of 5,352,105\ncommits. VulSifter involves utilizing an LLM to comprehend code semantics and\ncontextual information, while applying heuristics to filter out unrelated\nchanges. We then developed CleanVul, a high-quality dataset comprising 8,203\nfunctions using our LLM heuristic enhancement approach, demonstrating\nCorrectness (90.6%) comparable to established datasets such as SVEN and\nPrimeVul.\n  To evaluate the CleanVul dataset, we conducted experiments focusing on\nfine-tuning various LLMs on CleanVul and other high-quality datasets.\nEvaluation results reveal that LLMs fine-tuned on CleanVul not only exhibit\nenhanced accuracy but also superior generalization capabilities compared to\nthose trained on uncleaned datasets. Specifically, models trained on CleanVul\nand tested on PrimeVul achieve accuracy higher than those trained and tested\nexclusively on PrimeVul.",

However, visual reasoning,\nreasoning involving both visual and textual inputs, remains underexplored.\nRecent advancements, including the reasoning models like OpenAI o1 and Gemini\n2.0 Flash Thinking, which incorporate image inputs, have opened this\ncapability. In this ongoing work, we focus specifically on photography-related\ntasks because a photo is a visual snapshot of the physical world where the\nunderlying physics (i.e., illumination, blur extent, etc.) interplay with the\ncamera parameters. Successfully reasoning from the visual information of a\nphoto to identify these numerical camera settings requires the MLLMs to have a\ndeeper understanding of the underlying physics for precise visual\ncomprehension, representing a challenging and intelligent capability essential\nfor practical applications like photography assistant agents. We aim to\nevaluate MLLMs on their ability to distinguish visual differences related to\nnumerical camera settings, extending a methodology previously proposed for\nvision-language models (VLMs). Our preliminary results demonstrate the\nimportance of visual reasoning in photography-related tasks. Moreover, these\nresults show that no single MLLM consistently dominates across all evaluation\ntasks, demonstrating ongoing challenges and opportunities in developing MLLMs\nwith better visual reasoning.",

                    "value": "Large language models (LLMs) and multimodal large language models (MLLMs)\nhave significantly advanced artificial intelligence. However, visual reasoning,\nreasoning involving both visual and textual inputs, remains underexplored.\nRecent advancements, including the reasoning models like OpenAI o1 and Gemini\n2.0 Flash Thinking, which incorporate image inputs, have opened this\ncapability. In this ongoing work, we focus specifically on photography-related\ntasks because a photo is a visual snapshot of the physical world where the\nunderlying physics (i.e., illumination, blur extent, etc.) interplay with the\ncamera parameters. Successfully reasoning from the visual information of a\nphoto to identify these numerical camera settings requires the MLLMs to have a\ndeeper understanding of the underlying physics for precise visual\ncomprehension, representing a challenging and intelligent capability essential\nfor practical applications like photography assistant agents. We aim to\nevaluate MLLMs on their ability to distinguish visual differences related to\nnumerical camera settings, extending a methodology previously proposed for\nvision-language models (VLMs). Our preliminary results demonstrate the\nimportance of visual reasoning in photography-related tasks. Moreover, these\nresults show that no single MLLM consistently dominates across all evaluation\ntasks, demonstrating ongoing challenges and opportunities in developing MLLMs\nwith better visual reasoning."

We conduct our analysis both in terms of a compute budget and\nreal-world costs and find that LLM researchers expecting reasonably large\ninference demand (~1B requests) should train models smaller and longer than\nChinchilla-optimal. Furthermore, we train 47 models of varying sizes and\nparameter counts to validate our formula and find that model quality continues\nto improve as we scale tokens per parameter to extreme ranges (up to 10,000).\nFinally, we ablate the procedure used to fit the Chinchilla scaling law\ncoefficients and find that developing scaling laws only from data collected at\ntypical token/parameter ratios overestimates the impact of additional tokens at\nthese extreme ranges.",
