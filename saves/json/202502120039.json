GPUs are known for their strong\narithmetic computing capabilities and are highly suited for BLAS operations.\nHowever, porting code to GPUs often requires significant effort, especially for\nlarge, complex codes or legacy codes, even for BLAS-heavy applications. While\nvarious tools exist to automatically offload BLAS to GPUs, they are often\nimpractical due to the high costs associated with mandatory data transfers. The\nadvent of unified memory architectures in recent GPU designs, such as the\nNVIDIA Grace-Hopper, allows cache-coherent memory access across all types of\nmemory for both CPU and GPU, potentially eliminating the bottlenecks faced in\nconventional architectures. This breakthrough paves the way for innovative\napplication developments and porting strategies. Building on our preliminary\nwork demonstrating the potential of automatic *gemm offload, this paper extends\nthe framework to all level-3 BLAS operations and introduces SCILIB-Accel, a\nnovel tool for automatic BLAS offload. SCILIB-Accel leverages the memory\ncoherency in Grace-Hopper and introduces a Device First-Use data movement\npolicy inspired by the OpenMP First-Touch approach in multi-socket CPU\nprogramming, minimizing CPU-GPU data transfers for typical scientific computing\ncodes. Additionally, utilizing dynamic binary instrumentation, the tool\nintercepts BLAS symbols directly from a CPU binary, requiring no code\nmodifications or recompilation. SCILIB-Accel has been evaluated using multiple\nquantum physics codes on up to a few hundred GPU nodes, yielding promising\nspeedups. Notably, for the LSMS method in the MuST suite, a 3x speedup was\nachieved on Grace-Hopper compared to Grace-Grace.",

The\ncircuit board leverages low-voltage resistive components connected in series to\ncontrol voltages of up to 1.8 kV within a compact size, suitable for\nfrequencies ranging from 0 to 1 kHz. A single-channel control board weighs only\n2.5 g. We tested the performance of the control circuit under different load\nconditions and power supplies. Based on this control circuit, along with a\ncommercial miniature high-voltage power converter, we construct an untethered\ncrawling robot driven by a cylindrical DEA. The 42-g untethered robots\nsuccessfully obtained crawling locomotion on a bench and within a pipeline at a\ndriving frequency of 15 Hz, while simultaneously transmitting real-time video\ndata via an onboard camera and antenna. Our work provides a practical way to\nuse low-voltage control electronics to achieve the untethered driving of DEAs,\nand therefore portable and wearable devices."

However, existing methods relying on different projection formats\noften encounter challenges, either struggling with distortion and discontinuity\nin the case of equirectangular, cubemap, and tangent projections, or\nexperiencing a loss of texture details with the spherical projection. To tackle\nthese concerns, we present SphereFusion, an end-to-end framework that combines\nthe strengths of various projection methods. Specifically, SphereFusion\ninitially employs 2D image convolution and mesh operations to extract two\ndistinct types of features from the panorama image in both equirectangular and\nspherical projection domains. These features are then projected onto the\nspherical domain, where a gate fusion module selects the most reliable features\nfor fusion. Finally, SphereFusion estimates panorama depth within the spherical\ndomain. Meanwhile, SphereFusion employs a cache strategy to improve the\nefficiency of mesh operation. Extensive experiments on three public panorama\ndatasets demonstrate that SphereFusion achieves competitive results with other\nstate-of-the-art methods, while presenting the fastest inference speed at only\n17 ms on a 512$\\times$1024 panorama image.",

Despite its\nbenefits, SMC introduces unique microarchitectural behaviors that can be\nexploited for malicious purposes. In this paper, we explore the security\nimplications of SMC by examining how specific x86 instructions affecting\ninstruction cache lines lead to measurable timing discrepancies between cache\nhits and misses. These discrepancies facilitate refined cache attacks, making\nthem less noisy and more effective.

Despite its\nbenefits, SMC introduces unique microarchitectural behaviors that can be\nexploited for malicious purposes. In this paper, we explore the security\nimplications of SMC by examining how specific x86 instructions affecting\ninstruction cache lines lead to measurable timing discrepancies between cache\nhits and misses. These discrepancies facilitate refined cache attacks, making\nthem less noisy and more effective.

Adaptive\nattention techniques can dynamically reduce computational redundancy and thus\nimprove efficiency. Although current adaptive attention methods significantly\nreduce the memory requirements of Transformer-based language models, they are\nnot tailored for LVLMs. We observe that LVLMs generate responses from both\nremote image tokens and local text tokens, and different modalities have\ndifferent attention patterns. This observation inspires us to manage the\nattention for each modality separately. Specifically, for visual input, we\nstore the cache of potentially useful information but only compute the most\ncritical parts. For language input, we care more about local information. Based\non our observation and analysis of vision-language attention patterns, we\ndevelop A-VL, a plug-and-play adaptive attention tailored for LVLM inference.\nExtensive evaluations on three vision-language tasks and five datasets show the\neffectiveness of our designs. Our approach A-VL outperforms existing adaptive\nattention methods in reducing memory usage and computational load without\ncompromising performance.",

Adaptive\nattention techniques can dynamically reduce computational redundancy and thus\nimprove efficiency. Although current adaptive attention methods significantly\nreduce the memory requirements of Transformer-based language models, they are\nnot tailored for LVLMs. We observe that LVLMs generate responses from both\nremote image tokens and local text tokens, and different modalities have\ndifferent attention patterns. This observation inspires us to manage the\nattention for each modality separately. Specifically, for visual input, we\nstore the cache of potentially useful information but only compute the most\ncritical parts. For language input, we care more about local information. Based\non our observation and analysis of vision-language attention patterns, we\ndevelop A-VL, a plug-and-play adaptive attention tailored for LVLM inference.\nExtensive evaluations on three vision-language tasks and five datasets show the\neffectiveness of our designs. Our approach A-VL outperforms existing adaptive\nattention methods in reducing memory usage and computational load without\ncompromising performance."

However, current methods have three unsolved\nissues: overlooking layer-wise sensitivity to KV cache quantization, high\noverhead of online fine-grained decision-making, and low flexibility to\ndifferent LLMs and constraints. Therefore, we thoroughly analyze the inherent\ncorrelation of layer-wise transformer attention patterns to KV cache\nquantization errors and study why key cache is more important than value cache\nfor quantization error reduction. We further propose a simple yet effective\nframework KVTuner to adaptively search for the optimal hardware-friendly\nlayer-wise KV quantization precision pairs for coarse-grained KV cache with\nmulti-objective optimization and directly utilize the offline searched\nconfigurations during online inference. To reduce the computational cost of\noffline calibration, we utilize the intra-layer KV precision pair pruning and\ninter-layer clustering to reduce the search space. Experimental results show\nthat we can achieve nearly lossless 3.25-bit mixed precision KV cache\nquantization for LLMs like Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and 4.0-bit for sensitive\nmodels like Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct on mathematical reasoning tasks.

In this work, we propose ZACK, the first KV\ndimensionality compression system that achieves zero-overhead compression and\ndecompression and also reduces attention computation time. It complements and\ncan be combined with eviction-based and quantization-based methods to further\nenhance KV compression. Moreover, ZACK employs adaptive compression, tailoring\nKV compression rates across heads and layers based on their contributions to\ninference to maximize overall compression while maintaining an accuracy loss\nconstraint. Additionally, ZACK enhances the self-attention kernel to balance\nthe uneven workloads caused by the adaptive compression approach to further\nreduce attention computation latency. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate\nthat when combined with ZACK, state-of-the-art eviction-based and\nquantization-based methods for KV compression further reduce KV size by up to\n68%, Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) by up to 44%, and Time-Between-Tokens (TBT) by\nup to 55% and achieve up to 1.72X throughput under the same latency, while\nmaintaining 99% of the baseline accuracy.

                    "value": "In large-language models, memory constraints in the Key-Value Cache (KVC)\npose a challenge during inference. In this work, we propose ZACK, the first KV\ndimensionality compression system that achieves zero-overhead compression and\ndecompression and also reduces attention computation time. It complements and\ncan be combined with eviction-based and quantization-based methods to further\nenhance KV compression. Moreover, ZACK employs adaptive compression, tailoring\nKV compression rates across heads and layers based on their contributions to\ninference to maximize overall compression while maintaining an accuracy loss\nconstraint. Additionally, ZACK enhances the self-attention kernel to balance\nthe uneven workloads caused by the adaptive compression approach to further\nreduce attention computation latency. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate\nthat when combined with ZACK, state-of-the-art eviction-based and\nquantization-based methods for KV compression further reduce KV size by up to\n68%, Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) by up to 44%, and Time-Between-Tokens (TBT) by\nup to 55% and achieve up to 1.72X throughput under the same latency, while\nmaintaining 99% of the baseline accuracy. We open-sourced the code."

However, their substantial sizes\npose considerable challenges, particularly in computational demands and\ninference speed, due to their quadratic complexity. In this work, we have\nidentified a key pattern: certain seemingly meaningless special tokens (i.e.,\nseparators) contribute disproportionately to attention scores compared to\nsemantically meaningful tokens. This observation suggests that information of\nthe segments between these separator tokens can be effectively condensed into\nthe separator tokens themselves without significant information loss. Guided by\nthis insight, we introduce SepLLM, a plug-and-play framework that accelerates\ninference by compressing these segments and eliminating redundant tokens.\nAdditionally, we implement efficient kernels for training acceleration.\nExperimental results across training-free, training-from-scratch, and\npost-training settings demonstrate SepLLM's effectiveness. Notably, using the\nLlama-3-8B backbone, SepLLM achieves over 50% reduction in KV cache on the\nGSM8K-CoT benchmark while maintaining comparable performance. Furthermore, in\nstreaming settings, SepLLM effectively processes sequences of up to 4 million\ntokens or more while maintaining consistent language modeling capabilities.",

This framework is implemented as a boundary\ncondition for the continuum kinetic Boltzmann equation. The IIEE model is used\nto study how emissions affect sheath formation near biased Z-pinch electrodes.\n1X-1V (one spatial and one velocity dimension) Boltzmann-Poisson simulations\nare performed for a proton-electron plasma doubly bounded by two biased copper\nelectrodes with and without IIEE at bias potentials from 0 kV to 9 kV. The ions\nare accelerated to higher energies by the sheath potentials at the electrodes\ninducing electron emission. The secondary electron yield (SEY), defined as the\nratio of the flux of emitted electrons to impacting ions, increases with bias\npotential at both electrodes, but more significantly at the cathode. Despite\nthe SEY crossing 1 at 7 kV, a classical sheath, rather than a space-charge\nlimited or inverse sheath, forms for all cases. The emitted electrons present\nas a beam that is accelerated by the sheath potential into the domain resulting\nin increased electron temperatures due to collisions. For bias potentials\ngreater than 2 kV, the potential difference at the cathode is sufficiently\nstrong for emissive heating to increase the plasma potential compared to\nemissionless simulations. The emitted electrons increase the current in the\ndomain from 130 kA to 199 kA closely matching the experimental value of 200 kA.",

                    "value": "A generalized kinetic ion induced electron emission (IIEE) model is developed\nto obtain the emitted electron energy spectrum for a distribution of ion\nimpacts on a metallic surface. This framework is implemented as a boundary\ncondition for the continuum kinetic Boltzmann equation. The IIEE model is used\nto study how emissions affect sheath formation near biased Z-pinch electrodes.\n1X-1V (one spatial and one velocity dimension) Boltzmann-Poisson simulations\nare performed for a proton-electron plasma doubly bounded by two biased copper\nelectrodes with and without IIEE at bias potentials from 0 kV to 9 kV. The ions\nare accelerated to higher energies by the sheath potentials at the electrodes\ninducing electron emission. The secondary electron yield (SEY), defined as the\nratio of the flux of emitted electrons to impacting ions, increases with bias\npotential at both electrodes, but more significantly at the cathode. Despite\nthe SEY crossing 1 at 7 kV, a classical sheath, rather than a space-charge\nlimited or inverse sheath, forms for all cases. The emitted electrons present\nas a beam that is accelerated by the sheath potential into the domain resulting\nin increased electron temperatures due to collisions. For bias potentials\ngreater than 2 kV, the potential difference at the cathode is sufficiently\nstrong for emissive heating to increase the plasma potential compared to\nemissionless simulations. The emitted electrons increase the current in the\ndomain from 130 kA to 199 kA closely matching the experimental value of 200 kA."

Deploying post-trained models faces significant\nchallenges due to substantial memory overhead and noticeable inference latency.\nExisting work has identified significant redundancies in LLMs and proposed\nefficient architectures, namely intra-layer KV sharing and cross-layer KV\nsharing. However, intra-layer KV sharing still results in high inference costs,\nwhile cross-layer KV sharing leads to significant performance degradation. As a\nresult, both methods remain suboptimal for post-training pre-trained LLMs. In\nthis paper, we identify that the \\texttt{Softmax} operation is a primary\nbottleneck for LLM inference and discover that it is actually highly redundant\nduring post-training. We propose Softmax \\textbf{Uni}fication in\n\\textbf{Att}e\\textbf{n}tion (\\textbf{UniAttn}), a novel post-training method\nthat unifies Softmax activations across transformer blocks to reduce LLM\ninference costs. Additionally, UniAttn adopts a linear projection to compensate\nfor the errors induced by Softmax unification. Experiments show that UniAttn\nmatches the performance of standard post-training while significantly reducing\ninference costs, outperforming existing efficient architectures during\npost-training.

Such a design leads\nto non-trivial programming and performance overheads.\n  We present vAttention -- an approach that mitigates fragmentation in physical\nmemory while retaining the contiguity of KV cache in virtual memory. We achieve\nthis by decoupling the allocation of virtual and physical memory using CUDA\nvirtual memory management APIs. We also introduce various LLM-specific\noptimizations to address the limitations of CUDA virtual memory support.\nOverall, vAttention is a simpler, portable, and performant alternative to\nPagedAttention: it supports various attention kernels out-of-the-box and\nimproves LLM serving throughput by up to 1.23x compared to the use of\nPagedAttention-based kernels of FlashAttention and FlashInfer.",

                "summary": "Modern embedded systems are evolving toward complex, heterogeneous\narchitectures to accommodate increasingly demanding applications. Driven by\nSWAP-C constraints, this shift has led to consolidating multiple systems onto\nsingle hardware platforms. Static Partitioning Hypervisors offer a promising\nsolution to partition hardware resources and provide spatial isolation between\ncritical workloads. However, shared resources like the Last-Level Cache and\nsystem bus can introduce temporal interference between virtual machines (VMs),\nnegatively impacting performance and predictability. Over the past decade,\nacademia and industry have developed interference mitigation techniques, such\nas cache partitioning and memory bandwidth reservation. However, configuring\nthese techniques is complex and time-consuming. Cache partitioning requires\nbalancing cache sections across VMs, while memory bandwidth reservation needs\ntuning bandwidth budgets and periods. Testing all configurations is impractical\nand often leads to suboptimal results. Moreover, understanding how these\ntechniques interact is limited, as their combined use can produce compounded or\nconflicting effects on performance. Static analysis tools estimating worst-case\nexecution times offer guidance for configuring mitigation techniques but often\nfail to capture the complexity of modern multi-core systems. They typically\nfocus on limited shared resources while neglecting others, such as IOMMUs and\ninterrupt controllers. To address these challenges, we present SP-IMPact, an\nopen-source framework for analyzing and guiding interference mitigation\nconfigurations. SP-IMPact supports (i) cache coloring and (ii) memory bandwidth\nreservation, while evaluating their interactions and cumulative impact.

                    "value": "Modern embedded systems are evolving toward complex, heterogeneous\narchitectures to accommodate increasingly demanding applications. Driven by\nSWAP-C constraints, this shift has led to consolidating multiple systems onto\nsingle hardware platforms. Static Partitioning Hypervisors offer a promising\nsolution to partition hardware resources and provide spatial isolation between\ncritical workloads. However, shared resources like the Last-Level Cache and\nsystem bus can introduce temporal interference between virtual machines (VMs),\nnegatively impacting performance and predictability. Over the past decade,\nacademia and industry have developed interference mitigation techniques, such\nas cache partitioning and memory bandwidth reservation. However, configuring\nthese techniques is complex and time-consuming. Cache partitioning requires\nbalancing cache sections across VMs, while memory bandwidth reservation needs\ntuning bandwidth budgets and periods. Testing all configurations is impractical\nand often leads to suboptimal results. Moreover, understanding how these\ntechniques interact is limited, as their combined use can produce compounded or\nconflicting effects on performance. Static analysis tools estimating worst-case\nexecution times offer guidance for configuring mitigation techniques but often\nfail to capture the complexity of modern multi-core systems. They typically\nfocus on limited shared resources while neglecting others, such as IOMMUs and\ninterrupt controllers. To address these challenges, we present SP-IMPact, an\nopen-source framework for analyzing and guiding interference mitigation\nconfigurations. SP-IMPact supports (i) cache coloring and (ii) memory bandwidth\nreservation, while evaluating their interactions and cumulative impact. By\nproviding insights on real hardware, SP-IMPact helps optimize configurations\nfor mixed-criticality systems, ensuring performance and predictability."

Our comparison\nfocused on runtime perfor-mance, and was carried out empirically, using a\nreal-world web-based collec-tion in the field of digital humanities. The\nresults obtained show that the re-source-based strategy clearly outperforms the\nquery-based one."

Experimental results demonstrate that this approach\nenhances the generalization of multilingual models to other languages while\npreserving interpretability.

It uses embodied conversation to fix its\ndeficient domain model -- through dialogue, the agent discovers and then learns\nto exploit unforeseen possibilities. In particular, SECURE learns from the\nuser's embodied corrective feedback when it makes a mistake, and it makes\nstrategic dialogue decisions to reveal useful evidence about novel concepts for\nsolving the instructed task. Together, these abilities allow the agent to\ngeneralise to subsequent tasks using newly acquired knowledge.

Recent efforts,\nsuch as SWAN (Ma et al., 2024) address this by eliminating the need for\noptimizer states while achieving performance comparable to Adam via a\nmulti-step preprocessing procedure applied to instantaneous gradients.\nMotivated by the success of SWAN, we introduce a novel framework for designing\nstateless optimizers that normalizes stochastic gradients according to multiple\nnorms. To achieve this, we propose a simple alternating scheme to enforce the\nnormalization of gradients w.r.t these norms. We show that our procedure can\nproduce, up to an arbitrary precision, a fixed-point of the problem, and that\nSWAN is a particular instance of our approach with carefully chosen norms,\nproviding a deeper understanding of its design. However, SWAN's computationally\nexpensive whitening/orthogonalization step limit its practicality for large\nLMs. Using our principled perspective, we develop of a more efficient,\nscalable, and practical stateless optimizer. Our algorithm relaxes the\nproperties of SWAN, significantly reducing its computational cost while\nretaining its memory efficiency, making it applicable to training large-scale\nmodels.

                "summary": "Pretraining large language models (LLMs) on vast and heterogeneous datasets\nis crucial for achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse downstream\ntasks. However, current training paradigms treat all samples equally,\noverlooking the importance or relevance of individual samples throughout the\ntraining process. Existing reweighting strategies, which primarily focus on\ngroup-level data importance, fail to leverage fine-grained instance-level\ninformation and do not adapt dynamically to individual sample importance as\ntraining progresses. In this paper, we introduce novel algorithms for dynamic,\ninstance-level data reweighting aimed at improving both the efficiency and\neffectiveness of LLM pretraining. Our methods adjust the weight of each\ntraining sample based on its loss value in an online fashion, allowing the\nmodel to dynamically focus on more informative or important samples at the\ncurrent training stage. In particular, our framework allows us to\nsystematically devise reweighting strategies deprioritizing redundant or\nuninformative data, which we find tend to work best. Furthermore, we develop a\nnew theoretical framework for analyzing the impact of loss-based reweighting on\nthe convergence of gradient-based optimization, providing the first formal\ncharacterization of how these strategies affect convergence bounds. We\nempirically validate our approach across a spectrum of tasks, from pretraining\n7B and 1.4B parameter LLMs to smaller-scale language models and linear\nregression problems, demonstrating that our loss-based reweighting approach can\nlead to faster convergence and significantly improved performance.",

                    "value": "Pretraining large language models (LLMs) on vast and heterogeneous datasets\nis crucial for achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse downstream\ntasks. However, current training paradigms treat all samples equally,\noverlooking the importance or relevance of individual samples throughout the\ntraining process. Existing reweighting strategies, which primarily focus on\ngroup-level data importance, fail to leverage fine-grained instance-level\ninformation and do not adapt dynamically to individual sample importance as\ntraining progresses. In this paper, we introduce novel algorithms for dynamic,\ninstance-level data reweighting aimed at improving both the efficiency and\neffectiveness of LLM pretraining. Our methods adjust the weight of each\ntraining sample based on its loss value in an online fashion, allowing the\nmodel to dynamically focus on more informative or important samples at the\ncurrent training stage. In particular, our framework allows us to\nsystematically devise reweighting strategies deprioritizing redundant or\nuninformative data, which we find tend to work best. Furthermore, we develop a\nnew theoretical framework for analyzing the impact of loss-based reweighting on\nthe convergence of gradient-based optimization, providing the first formal\ncharacterization of how these strategies affect convergence bounds. We\nempirically validate our approach across a spectrum of tasks, from pretraining\n7B and 1.4B parameter LLMs to smaller-scale language models and linear\nregression problems, demonstrating that our loss-based reweighting approach can\nlead to faster convergence and significantly improved performance."

In this paper, we focus on two core questions: (1) What is the optimal\napproach to scale test-time computation across different policy models, PRMs,\nand problem difficulty levels?

Through comprehensive\nexperiments on MATH-500 and challenging AIME24 tasks, we have the following\nobservations: (1) The compute-optimal TTS strategy is highly dependent on the\nchoice of policy model, PRM, and problem difficulty. (2) With our\ncompute-optimal TTS strategy, extremely small policy models can outperform\nlarger models. For example, a 1B LLM can exceed a 405B LLM on MATH-500.\nMoreover, on both MATH-500 and AIME24, a 0.5B LLM outperforms GPT-4o, a 3B LLM\nsurpasses a 405B LLM, and a 7B LLM beats o1 and DeepSeek-R1, while with higher\ninference efficiency.

Existing research is constrained by\ngeneral or niche datasets that lack sufficient scale for training dialogue\nsystems. To address this gap, we introduce DiaSynth - a synthetic dialogue\ngeneration framework capable of generating high-quality, contextually rich\ndialogues across a wide range of domains. Unlike existing frameworks, DiaSynth\nuses Large Language Models (LLMs) and Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning to\ngenerate dynamic, domain-specific dialogues with simulated personas and diverse\nconversational features. We perform our experiments by generating synthetic\ndata using different LLMs and few-shot examples from DialogSum and SAMSum. The\npretrained language models fine-tuned on the synthetic data outperform the base\nmodels by 16.47% on dialogue summarization, while the comparison between models\nfine-tuned on in-domain data and synthetic data shows that the synthetic data\nis able to capture 90.48% of the performance distribution of the in-domain data\non dialogue summarization. The quality of the data generated also increases as\nwe increase the size of LLM from 3B to 8B. These results validate DiaSynth's\npotential as a robust alternative to traditional data collection methods. We\nopen source the code and data generated for future research.",

Existing research is constrained by\ngeneral or niche datasets that lack sufficient scale for training dialogue\nsystems. To address this gap, we introduce DiaSynth - a synthetic dialogue\ngeneration framework capable of generating high-quality, contextually rich\ndialogues across a wide range of domains. Unlike existing frameworks, DiaSynth\nuses Large Language Models (LLMs) and Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning to\ngenerate dynamic, domain-specific dialogues with simulated personas and diverse\nconversational features. We perform our experiments by generating synthetic\ndata using different LLMs and few-shot examples from DialogSum and SAMSum. The\npretrained language models fine-tuned on the synthetic data outperform the base\nmodels by 16.47% on dialogue summarization, while the comparison between models\nfine-tuned on in-domain data and synthetic data shows that the synthetic data\nis able to capture 90.48% of the performance distribution of the in-domain data\non dialogue summarization. The quality of the data generated also increases as\nwe increase the size of LLM from 3B to 8B. These results validate DiaSynth's\npotential as a robust alternative to traditional data collection methods. We\nopen source the code and data generated for future research."

However, as\nMoE models scale, they need to be distributed across GPU devices, thus face\ncritical performance bottlenecks due to their large memory footprint. Expert\nparallelism distributes experts across GPUs, however, faces key challenges\nincluding an unbalanced token routing and expert activation, resulting in\ncommunication tail latency and processing inefficiencies. While existing\nsolutions address some of these issues, they fail to resolve the dual\nchallenges of load imbalance and communication skew. The imbalance in token\nprocessing load across experts causes uneven processing times on different\nGPUs, while communication skew between GPUs leads to unbalanced inter-GPU data\ntransfers. These factors degrade the performance of MoE models by increasing\ntail latency and reducing overall throughput. To address these limitations, we\npropose an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulation to optimize expert\nplacement by jointly considering token load, communication, and computation\ncosts. We exploit the property that there is a token routing dependency across\nlayers, where tokens routed to a specific expert in one layer are likely to be\nrouted to a limited set of experts in the subsequent layer. Our solution,\nMoETuner, offers an optimal expert-to-GPU assignment that minimizes inter-GPU\ntoken routing costs and balances token processing across devices, thereby\nreducing tail latency and end-to-end execution time. Experimental results\ndemonstrate 9.3% and 17.5% of end-to-end speedups for single-node and\nmulti-node inference respectively, showcasing the potential of our ILP-based\noptimization for offering expert parallel solutions for next-generation MoEs.",

This highlights the\nimportance of integrated content-format optimization and offers a practical,\nmodel-agnostic approach to enhancing LLM performance. Code is available at\nhttps://github.com/HenryLau7/CFPO."

Recent advancements in large language models\n(LLMs) have inspired a number of algorithm techniques for improving DP\nsynthetic data generation. One family of approaches uses DP finetuning on the\nfoundation model weights; however, the model weights for state-of-the-art\nmodels may not be public. In this work we propose two DP synthetic tabular data\nalgorithms that only require API access to the foundation model. We adapt the\nPrivate Evolution algorithm (Lin et al., 2023; Xie et al., 2024) -- which was\ndesigned for image and text data -- to the tabular data domain. In our\nextension of Private Evolution, we define a query workload-based distance\nmeasure, which may be of independent interest. We propose a family of\nalgorithms that use one-shot API access to LLMs, rather than adaptive queries\nto the LLM. Our findings reveal that API-access to powerful LLMs does not\nalways improve the quality of DP synthetic data compared to established\nbaselines that operate without such access. We provide insights into the\nunderlying reasons and propose improvements to LLMs that could make them more\neffective for this application.",

Recent advancements in large language models\n(LLMs) have inspired a number of algorithm techniques for improving DP\nsynthetic data generation. One family of approaches uses DP finetuning on the\nfoundation model weights; however, the model weights for state-of-the-art\nmodels may not be public. In this work we propose two DP synthetic tabular data\nalgorithms that only require API access to the foundation model. We adapt the\nPrivate Evolution algorithm (Lin et al., 2023; Xie et al., 2024) -- which was\ndesigned for image and text data -- to the tabular data domain. In our\nextension of Private Evolution, we define a query workload-based distance\nmeasure, which may be of independent interest. We propose a family of\nalgorithms that use one-shot API access to LLMs, rather than adaptive queries\nto the LLM. Our findings reveal that API-access to powerful LLMs does not\nalways improve the quality of DP synthetic data compared to established\nbaselines that operate without such access. We provide insights into the\nunderlying reasons and propose improvements to LLMs that could make them more\neffective for this application."

At\nthe same time, we found that few-shot prompting can boost the performance of\ndifferent LLMs, including Gemma (+14%) and LLama-3 (+43%).

The transcripts were labeled by\nmental health experts for training and evaluation.\n  Results: In the zero-shot inference setting using GPT-4 Turbo, 73 out of 102\nsegments demonstrated a recall mid-token distance d < 20 in identifying\nsymptom-related sections. For recognizing specific symptoms, fine-tuning\noutperformed zero-shot inference, achieving an accuracy, precision, recall, and\nF1-score of 0.82. For the generative summarization task, LLMs using symptom and\nstressor information scored highly on G-Eval metrics: coherence (4.66),\nconsistency (4.73), fluency (2.16), and relevance (4.67). Retrieval-augmented\ngeneration showed no notable performance improvement.\n  Conclusions: LLMs, with fine-tuning or appropriate prompting, demonstrated\nstrong accuracy (over 0.8) for symptom delineation and achieved high coherence\n(4.6+) in summarization.

For the generative summarization task, LLMs using symptom and\nstressor information scored highly on G-Eval metrics: coherence (4.66),\nconsistency (4.73), fluency (2.16), and relevance (4.67). Retrieval-augmented\ngeneration showed no notable performance improvement.\n  Conclusions: LLMs, with fine-tuning or appropriate prompting, demonstrated\nstrong accuracy (over 0.8) for symptom delineation and achieved high coherence\n(4.6+) in summarization. This study highlights their potential to assist mental\nhealth practitioners in analyzing psychiatric interviews."

In this paper, we\npropose a principled approach for identifying and estimating the counterfactual\noutcome. We first introduce a simple and intuitive rank preservation assumption\nto identify the counterfactual outcome without relying on a known structural\ncausal model. Building on this, we propose a novel ideal loss for theoretically\nunbiased learning of the counterfactual outcome and further develop a\nkernel-based estimator for its empirical estimation. Our theoretical analysis\nshows that the rank preservation assumption is not stronger than the\nhomogeneity and strict monotonicity assumptions, and shows that the proposed\nideal loss is convex, and the proposed estimator is unbiased. Extensive\nsemi-synthetic and real-world experiments are conducted to demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed method.",

In this paper, we\npropose a principled approach for identifying and estimating the counterfactual\noutcome. We first introduce a simple and intuitive rank preservation assumption\nto identify the counterfactual outcome without relying on a known structural\ncausal model. Building on this, we propose a novel ideal loss for theoretically\nunbiased learning of the counterfactual outcome and further develop a\nkernel-based estimator for its empirical estimation. Our theoretical analysis\nshows that the rank preservation assumption is not stronger than the\nhomogeneity and strict monotonicity assumptions, and shows that the proposed\nideal loss is convex, and the proposed estimator is unbiased. Extensive\nsemi-synthetic and real-world experiments are conducted to demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed method."

LinkQ simplifies this process by\nimplementing a multistep protocol in which the LLM interprets a user's\nquestion, then systematically converts it into a well-formed query. LinkQ helps\nusers iteratively refine any open-ended questions into precise ones, supporting\nboth targeted and exploratory analysis. Further, LinkQ guards against the LLM\nhallucinating outputs by ensuring users' questions are only ever answered from\nground truth KG data. We demonstrate the efficacy of LinkQ through a\nqualitative study with five KG practitioners. Our results indicate that\npractitioners find LinkQ effective for KG question-answering, and desire future\nLLM-assisted exploratory data analysis systems.",

However, current studies do not systematically analyze how\npolicy models, Process Reward Models (PRMs), and problem difficulty influence\nTTS. This lack of analysis limits the understanding and practical use of TTS\nmethods. In this paper, we focus on two core questions: (1) What is the optimal\napproach to scale test-time computation across different policy models, PRMs,\nand problem difficulty levels? (2) To what extent can extended computation\nimprove the performance of LLMs on complex tasks, and can smaller language\nmodels outperform larger ones through this approach? Through comprehensive\nexperiments on MATH-500 and challenging AIME24 tasks, we have the following\nobservations: (1) The compute-optimal TTS strategy is highly dependent on the\nchoice of policy model, PRM, and problem difficulty. (2) With our\ncompute-optimal TTS strategy, extremely small policy models can outperform\nlarger models.

                    "value": "Test-Time Scaling (TTS) is an important method for improving the performance\nof Large Language Models (LLMs) by using additional computation during the\ninference phase. However, current studies do not systematically analyze how\npolicy models, Process Reward Models (PRMs), and problem difficulty influence\nTTS. This lack of analysis limits the understanding and practical use of TTS\nmethods. In this paper, we focus on two core questions: (1) What is the optimal\napproach to scale test-time computation across different policy models, PRMs,\nand problem difficulty levels? (2) To what extent can extended computation\nimprove the performance of LLMs on complex tasks, and can smaller language\nmodels outperform larger ones through this approach?

Recently, the increasing concerns\nabout cloud costs, latency, and privacy make it an urgent requirement to\ndevelop compact edge language models. Distinguished from direct pretraining\nthat bounded by the scaling law, this work proposes the pruning-aware\npretraining, focusing on retaining performance of much larger optimized models.\nIt features following characteristics: 1) Data-scalable: we introduce minimal\nparameter groups in LLM and continuously optimize structural pruning, extending\npost-training pruning methods like LLM-Pruner and SparseGPT into the\npretraining phase. 2) Architecture-agnostic: the LLM architecture is\nauto-designed using saliency-driven pruning, which is the first time to exceed\nSoTA human-designed LLMs in modern pretraining. We reveal that it achieves\ntop-quality edge language models, termed EfficientLLM, by scaling up LLM\ncompression and extending its boundary. EfficientLLM significantly outperforms\nSoTA baselines with $100M \\sim 1B$ parameters, such as MobileLLM, SmolLM,\nQwen2.5-0.5B, OLMo-1B, Llama3.2-1B in common sense benchmarks. As the first\nattempt, EfficientLLM bridges the performance gap between traditional LLM\ncompression and direct pretraining methods, and we will fully open source at\nhttps://github.com/Xingrun-Xing2/EfficientLLM.",

This work presents the first systematic investigation in\nunderstanding, analyzing, and mitigating bias inheritance. We study this\nproblem by fine-tuning LLMs with a combined dataset consisting of original and\nLLM-augmented data, where bias ratio represents the proportion of augmented\ndata. Through systematic experiments across 10 classification and generation\ntasks, we analyze how 6 different types of biases manifest at varying bias\nratios. Our results reveal that bias inheritance has nuanced effects on\ndownstream tasks, influencing both classification tasks and generation tasks\ndifferently. Then, our analysis identifies three key misalignment factors:\nmisalignment of values, group data, and data distributions. Based on these\ninsights, we propose three mitigation strategies: token-based, mask-based, and\nloss-based approaches. Experiments demonstrate that these strategies also work\ndifferently on various tasks and bias, indicating the substantial challenges to\nfully mitigate bias inheritance.

While\nrecent research has focused on optimizing prompt content, the role of prompt\nformatting, a critical but often overlooked dimension, has received limited\nsystematic investigation. In this paper, we introduce Content-Format Integrated\nPrompt Optimization (CFPO), an innovative methodology that jointly optimizes\nboth prompt content and formatting through an iterative refinement process.\nCFPO leverages natural language mutations to explore content variations and\nemploys a dynamic format exploration strategy that systematically evaluates\ndiverse format options. Our extensive evaluations across multiple tasks and\nopen-source LLMs demonstrate that CFPO demonstrates measurable performance\nimprovements compared to content-only optimization methods. This highlights the\nimportance of integrated content-format optimization and offers a practical,\nmodel-agnostic approach to enhancing LLM performance.

However, 3D shape generation\ntechnology has so far lagged behind, constrained by limitations in 3D data\nscale, complexity of 3D data process- ing, and insufficient exploration of\nadvanced tech- niques in the 3D domain. Current approaches to 3D shape\ngeneration face substantial challenges in terms of output quality,\ngeneralization capa- bility, and alignment with input conditions. We present\nTripoSG, a new streamlined shape diffu- sion paradigm capable of generating\nhigh-fidelity 3D meshes with precise correspondence to input images.\nSpecifically, we propose: 1) A large-scale rectified flow transformer for 3D\nshape generation, achieving state-of-the-art fidelity through training on\nextensive, high-quality data. 2) A hybrid supervised training strategy\ncombining SDF, normal, and eikonal losses for 3D VAE, achieving high- quality\n3D reconstruction performance. 3) A data processing pipeline to generate 2\nmillion high- quality 3D samples, highlighting the crucial rules for data\nquality and quantity in training 3D gen- erative models. Through comprehensive\nexperi- ments, we have validated the effectiveness of each component in our new\nframework. The seamless integration of these parts has enabled TripoSG to\nachieve state-of-the-art performance in 3D shape generation. The resulting 3D\nshapes exhibit en- hanced detail due to high-resolution capabilities and\ndemonstrate exceptional fidelity to input im- ages. Moreover, TripoSG\ndemonstrates improved versatility in generating 3D models from diverse image\nstyles and contents, showcasing strong gen- eralization capabilities. To foster\nprogress and innovation in the field of 3D generation, we will make our model\npublicly available.",

Two key requirements for such assistants\nare personalization - in the sense that the assistant should recognizably\nreflect the user's own writing style - and privacy - users may justifiably be\nwary of uploading extremely personal data, such as their email archive, to a\nthird-party service. In this paper, we present a new design and evaluation for\nsuch an automated assistant, for the specific use case of email generation,\nwhich we call Panza. Panza's personalization features are based on a\ncombination of fine-tuning using a variant of the Reverse Instructions\ntechnique together with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). We demonstrate\nthat this combination allows us to fine-tune an LLM to reflect a user's writing\nstyle using limited data, while executing on extremely limited resources, e.g.\non a free Google Colab instance. Our key methodological contribution is the\nfirst detailed study of evaluation metrics for this personalized writing task,\nand of how different choices of system components--the use of RAG and of\ndifferent fine-tuning approaches-impact the system's performance. Additionally,\nwe demonstrate that very little data - under 100 email samples - are sufficient\nto create models that convincingly imitate humans. This finding showcases a\npreviously-unknown attack vector in language models - that access to a small\nnumber of writing samples can allow a bad actor to cheaply create generative\nmodels that imitate a target's writing style. We are releasing the full Panza\ncode as well as three new email datasets licensed for research use at\nhttps://github.com/IST-DASLab/PanzaMail.",

The transcripts were labeled by\nmental health experts for training and evaluation.\n  Results: In the zero-shot inference setting using GPT-4 Turbo, 73 out of 102\nsegments demonstrated a recall mid-token distance d < 20 in identifying\nsymptom-related sections. For recognizing specific symptoms, fine-tuning\noutperformed zero-shot inference, achieving an accuracy, precision, recall, and\nF1-score of 0.82.

These agents aim to execute human\ninstructions on smartphones by interpreting textual instructions and performing\nactions via the device's interface. While promising, current approaches face\nsignificant limitations. Methods that use large proprietary models, such as\nGPT-4o, are computationally expensive, while those that use smaller fine-tuned\nmodels often lack adaptability to out-of-distribution tasks.

In this paper, we investigate the questions of\nassessing the performance of human annotators and incentivizing them to provide\nhigh-quality annotations. The quality assessment of language/text annotation\nfaces two challenges: (i) the intrinsic heterogeneity among annotators, which\nprevents the classic methods that assume the underlying existence of a true\nlabel; and (ii) the unclear relationship between the annotation quality and the\nperformance of downstream tasks, which excludes the possibility of inferring\nthe annotators' behavior based on the model performance trained from the\nannotation data. Then we formulate a principal-agent model to characterize the\nbehaviors of and the interactions between the company and the human annotators.\nThe model rationalizes a practical mechanism of a bonus scheme to incentivize\nannotators which benefits both parties and it underscores the importance of the\njoint presence of an assessment system and a proper contract scheme. From a\ntechnical perspective, our analysis extends the existing literature on the\nprincipal-agent model by considering a continuous action space for the agent.\nWe show the gap between the first-best and the second-best solutions (under the\ncontinuous action space) is of $\\Theta(1/\\sqrt{n \\log n})$ for the binary\ncontracts and $\\Theta(1/n)$ for the linear contracts, where $n$ is the number\nof samples used for performance assessment; this contrasts with the known\nresult of $\\exp(-\\Theta(n))$ for the binary contracts when the action space is\ndiscrete.

To facilitate long context training of LLMs,\nsequence parallelism has emerged as an essential technique, which scatters each\ninput sequence across multiple devices and necessitates communication to\nprocess the sequence. In essence, existing sequence parallelism methods assume\nhomogeneous sequence lengths (i.e., all input sequences are equal in length)\nand therefore leverages a single, static scattering strategy for all input\nsequences. However, in reality, the sequence lengths in LLM training corpora\nexhibit substantial variability, often following a long-tail distribution,\nwhich leads to workload heterogeneity. In this paper, we show that employing a\nsingle, static strategy results in inefficiency and resource under-utilization,\nhighlighting the need for adaptive approaches to handle the heterogeneous\nworkloads across sequences. To address this, we propose a\nheterogeneity-adaptive sequence parallelism method. For each training step, our\napproach captures the variability in sequence lengths and assigns the optimal\ncombination of scattering strategies based on workload characteristics. We\nmodel this problem as a linear programming optimization and design an efficient\nand effective solver to find the optimal solution.

Such malicious interventions could be\nincorporated into high-level wrapped APIs where the final input prompt is not\nshown to end-users. To address this issue, we investigate the detection and\nreversal of IKE-edits.

However, LLMs are vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, which can generate\nmalicious content. This paper investigates the feasibility and rationale behind\napplying traditional LLM jailbreak attacks to EAI systems. We aim to answer\nthree questions: (1) Do traditional LLM jailbreak attacks apply to EAI systems?\n(2) What challenges arise if they do not? and (3) How can we defend against EAI\njailbreak attacks? To this end, we first measure existing LLM-based EAI systems\nusing a newly constructed dataset, i.e., the Harmful-RLbench. Our study\nconfirms that traditional LLM jailbreak attacks are not directly applicable to\nEAI systems and identifies two unique challenges. First, the harmful text does\nnot necessarily constitute harmful policies. Second, even if harmful policies\ncan be generated, they are not necessarily executable by the EAI systems, which\nlimits the potential risk. To facilitate a more comprehensive security\nanalysis, we refine and introduce POEX, a novel red teaming framework that\noptimizes adversarial suffixes to induce harmful yet executable policies\nagainst EAI systems. The design of POEX employs adversarial constraints, policy\nevaluators, and suffix optimization to ensure successful policy execution while\nevading safety detection inside an EAI system. Experiments on the real-world\nrobotic arm and simulator using Harmful-RLbench demonstrate the efficacy,\nhighlighting severe safety vulnerabilities and high transferability across\nmodels. Finally, we propose prompt-based and model-based defenses, achieving an\n85% success rate in mitigating attacks and enhancing safety awareness in EAI\nsystems.

However, their\nreliance on extensive and often undisclosed pre-training datasets raises\nsignificant concerns about data leakage, where the evaluation benchmark data is\nunintentionally ``seen'' by LLMs during the model's construction phase. The\ndata leakage issue could largely undermine the validity of LLM-based research\nand evaluations. Despite the increasing use of LLMs in the SE community, there\nis no comprehensive study that assesses the extent of data leakage in SE\nbenchmarks for LLMs yet. To address this gap, this paper presents the first\nlarge-scale analysis of data leakage in 83 SE benchmarks concerning LLMs. Our\nresults show that in general, data leakage in SE benchmarks is minimal, with\naverage leakage ratios of only 4.8\\%, 2.8\\%, and 0.7\\% for Python, Java, and\nC/C++ benchmarks, respectively. However, some benchmarks exhibit relatively\nhigher leakage ratios, which raises concerns about their bias in evaluation.\nFor instance, QuixBugs and BigCloneBench have leakage ratios of 100.0\\% and\n55.7\\%, respectively. Furthermore, we observe that data leakage has a\nsubstantial impact on LLM evaluation. We also identify key causes of high data\nleakage, such as the direct inclusion of benchmark data in pre-training\ndatasets and the use of coding platforms like LeetCode for benchmark\nconstruction. To address the data leakage, we introduce\n\\textbf{LessLeak-Bench}, a new benchmark that removes leaked samples from the\n83 SE benchmarks, enabling more reliable LLM evaluations in future research.\nOur study enhances the understanding of data leakage in SE benchmarks and\nprovides valuable insights for future research involving LLMs in SE.",

The\ndata leakage issue could largely undermine the validity of LLM-based research\nand evaluations. Despite the increasing use of LLMs in the SE community, there\nis no comprehensive study that assesses the extent of data leakage in SE\nbenchmarks for LLMs yet. To address this gap, this paper presents the first\nlarge-scale analysis of data leakage in 83 SE benchmarks concerning LLMs. Our\nresults show that in general, data leakage in SE benchmarks is minimal, with\naverage leakage ratios of only 4.8\\%, 2.8\\%, and 0.7\\% for Python, Java, and\nC/C++ benchmarks, respectively. However, some benchmarks exhibit relatively\nhigher leakage ratios, which raises concerns about their bias in evaluation.\nFor instance, QuixBugs and BigCloneBench have leakage ratios of 100.0\\% and\n55.7\\%, respectively. Furthermore, we observe that data leakage has a\nsubstantial impact on LLM evaluation. We also identify key causes of high data\nleakage, such as the direct inclusion of benchmark data in pre-training\ndatasets and the use of coding platforms like LeetCode for benchmark\nconstruction. To address the data leakage, we introduce\n\\textbf{LessLeak-Bench}, a new benchmark that removes leaked samples from the\n83 SE benchmarks, enabling more reliable LLM evaluations in future research.\nOur study enhances the understanding of data leakage in SE benchmarks and\nprovides valuable insights for future research involving LLMs in SE."

After generating and manually scoring\nLLM responses on three recent SE datasets of code translation, code generation,\nand code summarization, we then prompt these methods to evaluate each response.\nFinally, we compare the scores generated by these methods with human\nevaluation. The results indicate that output-based methods reach the highest\nPearson correlation of 81.32 and 68.51 with human scores in code translation\nand generation, achieving near-human evaluation, noticeably outperforming\nChrF++, one of the best conventional metrics, at 34.23 and 64.92. Such\noutput-based methods prompt LLMs to output judgments directly, and exhibit more\nbalanced score distributions that resemble human score patterns. Finally, we\nprovide..."
