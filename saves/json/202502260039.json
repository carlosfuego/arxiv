In embedded systems running a\ngeneral-purpose OS, accelerators access data via dedicated, physically\naddressed memory regions.

In this work, we present a\nquantitative evaluation of shared virtual addressing in RISC-V heterogeneous\nembedded systems. We integrate an IOMMU in an open-source heterogeneous RISC-V\nSoC consisting of a 64-bit host with a 32-bit accelerator cluster. We evaluated\nthe system performance by emulating the design on FPGA and implementing compute\nkernels from the RajaPERF benchmark suite using heterogeneous OpenMP\nprogramming. We measure the transfers and computation time on the host and\naccelerators for systems with different DRAM access latencies. We first show\nthat IO virtual address translation can account for 4.2% up to 17.6% of the\naccelerator's runtime for gemm (General Matrix Multiplication) at low and high\nmemory bandwidth. Then, we show that in systems containing a last-level cache,\nthis IO address translation cost falls to 0.4% and 0.7% under the same\nconditions, making shared virtual addressing and zero-copy offloading suitable\nfor such RISC-V heterogeneous SoCs.",

We integrate an IOMMU in an open-source heterogeneous RISC-V\nSoC consisting of a 64-bit host with a 32-bit accelerator cluster. We evaluated\nthe system performance by emulating the design on FPGA and implementing compute\nkernels from the RajaPERF benchmark suite using heterogeneous OpenMP\nprogramming. We measure the transfers and computation time on the host and\naccelerators for systems with different DRAM access latencies. We first show\nthat IO virtual address translation can account for 4.2% up to 17.6% of the\naccelerator's runtime for gemm (General Matrix Multiplication) at low and high\nmemory bandwidth. Then, we show that in systems containing a last-level cache,\nthis IO address translation cost falls to 0.4% and 0.7% under the same\nconditions, making shared virtual addressing and zero-copy offloading suitable\nfor such RISC-V heterogeneous SoCs."

In this work, we have\nidentified a key pattern: certain seemingly meaningless separator tokens (i.e.,\npunctuations) contribute disproportionately to attention scores compared to\nsemantically meaningful tokens. This observation suggests that information of\nthe segments between these separator tokens can be effectively condensed into\nthe separator tokens themselves without significant information loss. Guided by\nthis insight, we introduce SepLLM, a plug-and-play framework that accelerates\ninference by compressing these segments and eliminating redundant tokens.\nAdditionally, we implement efficient kernels for training acceleration.\nExperimental results across training-free, training-from-scratch, and\npost-training settings demonstrate SepLLM's effectiveness. Notably, using the\nLlama-3-8B backbone, SepLLM achieves over 50% reduction in KV cache on the\nGSM8K-CoT benchmark while maintaining comparable performance. Furthermore, in\nstreaming settings, SepLLM effectively processes sequences of up to 4 million\ntokens or more while maintaining consistent language modeling capabilities.",

To address this limitation, we propose a new KV cache\ncompression objective: to always ensure the full-cache performance regardless\nof specific inputs, while maximizing KV cache pruning as much as possible. To\nachieve this goal, we introduce a novel KV cache compression method dubbed\nDBudgetKV, which features an attention-based metric to signal when the\nremaining KV cache is unlikely to match the full-cache performance, then\nhalting the pruning process. Empirical evaluation spanning diverse context\nlengths, task types, and model sizes suggests that our method achieves lossless\nKV pruning effectively and robustly, exceeding 25% compression ratio on\naverage. Furthermore, our method is easy to integrate within LLM inference, not\nonly optimizing memory space, but also showing reduced inference time compared\nto existing methods.",

However, recent methods focus\non search accuracy while overlooking computational efficiency. The challenges\nof accelerating the ToT lie in the frequent switching of reasoning focus, and\nthe redundant exploration of suboptimal solutions. To alleviate this dilemma,\nwe propose Dynamic Parallel Tree Search (DPTS), a novel parallelism framework\nthat aims to dynamically optimize the reasoning path in inference. It includes\nthe Parallelism Streamline in the generation phase to build up a flexible and\nadaptive parallelism with arbitrary paths by fine-grained cache management and\nalignment.

However, recent methods focus\non search accuracy while overlooking computational efficiency. The challenges\nof accelerating the ToT lie in the frequent switching of reasoning focus, and\nthe redundant exploration of suboptimal solutions. To alleviate this dilemma,\nwe propose Dynamic Parallel Tree Search (DPTS), a novel parallelism framework\nthat aims to dynamically optimize the reasoning path in inference. It includes\nthe Parallelism Streamline in the generation phase to build up a flexible and\nadaptive parallelism with arbitrary paths by fine-grained cache management and\nalignment.

Three main types of KV cache\ncompression techniques, namely sparsity, channel compression, and quantization,\nhave been identified. This study presents SVDq, a Singular Value Decomposition\n(SVD) - based mixed precision quantization method for K cache. Initially, K\ncache is transformed into latent channels using SVD basis representations.\nSince the values in latent channels decay rapidly and become negligible after\nonly a few latent channels, our method then incorporates importance-aware\nquantization and compression for latent channels. This enables the effective\nallocation of higher precision to more significant channels. Theoretically, we\nprove that SVDq results in quantization errors (x0.1 or even lower) that are\nmuch lower than those of per-channel key quantization in the original space.\nOur findings based on RULER and LongBench benchmarks demonstrate that SVDq can\nachieve an equivalent key cache precision as low as 1.25-bit. When combined\nwith key sparsity, it can reach a key compression ratio of up to 410x for\nattention computation, all while maintaining comparable model performance.\nNotably, our method is nearly lossless for LongBench datasets. This indicates\nthat SVDq enables high-precision low-bit quantization, providing a more\nefficient solution for KV cache compression in LLMs.",

Initially, K\ncache is transformed into latent channels using SVD basis representations.\nSince the values in latent channels decay rapidly and become negligible after\nonly a few latent channels, our method then incorporates importance-aware\nquantization and compression for latent channels. This enables the effective\nallocation of higher precision to more significant channels. Theoretically, we\nprove that SVDq results in quantization errors (x0.1 or even lower) that are\nmuch lower than those of per-channel key quantization in the original space.\nOur findings based on RULER and LongBench benchmarks demonstrate that SVDq can\nachieve an equivalent key cache precision as low as 1.25-bit. When combined\nwith key sparsity, it can reach a key compression ratio of up to 410x for\nattention computation, all while maintaining comparable model performance.\nNotably, our method is nearly lossless for LongBench datasets. This indicates\nthat SVDq enables high-precision low-bit quantization, providing a more\nefficient solution for KV cache compression in LLMs."

Furthermore, our theoretical\nanalysis shows that matrices with higher spectral norms amplify quantization\nerrors more significantly. Motivated by these insights, we propose a\nmixed-precision quantization strategy, KV-AdaQuant, which allocates more\nbit-width for keys and fewer for values since key matrices have higher norm\nvalues. With the same total KV bit budget, this approach effectively mitigates\nerror propagation across transformer layers while achieving significant memory\nsavings. Our extensive experiments on multiple LLMs (1B--70B) demonstrate that\nour mixed-precision quantization scheme maintains high model accuracy even\nunder aggressive compression. For instance, using 4-bit for Key and 2-bit for\nValue achieves an accuracy of 75.2%, whereas reversing the assignment (2-bit\nfor Key and 4-bit for Value) yields only 54.7% accuracy.

Enabling well-trained LLMs (e.g., Llama) to rapidly adapt to MLA\nwithout pre-training from scratch is both meaningful and challenging. This\npaper proposes the first data-efficient fine-tuning method for transitioning\nfrom MHA to MLA (MHA2MLA), which includes two key components: for partial-RoPE,\nwe remove RoPE from dimensions of queries and keys that contribute less to the\nattention scores, for low-rank approximation, we introduce joint SVD\napproximations based on the pre-trained parameters of keys and values.

Enabling well-trained LLMs (e.g., Llama) to rapidly adapt to MLA\nwithout pre-training from scratch is both meaningful and challenging. This\npaper proposes the first data-efficient fine-tuning method for transitioning\nfrom MHA to MLA (MHA2MLA), which includes two key components: for partial-RoPE,\nwe remove RoPE from dimensions of queries and keys that contribute less to the\nattention scores, for low-rank approximation, we introduce joint SVD\napproximations based on the pre-trained parameters of keys and values.

Motivated by the\nVision Token Re-attention phenomenon across decoder layers, we dynamically\nadjust token retention rates layer by layer. Layers that exhibit stronger\nattention to visual information preserve more vision tokens, while layers with\nlower vision attention are aggressively pruned. Furthermore, PLPHP applies\npruning at the attention head level, enabling different heads within the same\nlayer to independently retain critical context. Experiments on multiple\nbenchmarks demonstrate that PLPHP delivers an 18% faster decoding speed and\nreduces the Key-Value Cache (KV Cache) size by over 50%, all at the cost of\n0.46% average performance drop, while also achieving notable performance\nimprovements in multi-image tasks.

Our approach enables the direct conversion of trained decoder-only\nMLLMs to linear-complexity architectures without requiring pre-trained\nRNN-based LLM or vision encoders. We propose an seeding strategy to carve Mamba\nfrom trained Transformer and a three-stage distillation recipe, which can\neffectively transfer the knowledge from Transformer to Mamba while preserving\nmultimodal capabilities. Our method also supports flexible hybrid architectures\nthat combine Transformer and Mamba layers for customizable\nefficiency-performance trade-offs. Distilled from the Transformer-based\ndecoder-only HoVLE, mmMamba-linear achieves competitive performance against\nexisting linear and quadratic-complexity VLMs, while mmMamba-hybrid further\nimproves performance significantly, approaching HoVLE's capabilities.

HEADINFER employs a fine-grained, head-wise\noffloading strategy, maintaining only selective attention heads KV cache on the\nGPU while computing attention output dynamically. Through roofline analysis, we\ndemonstrate that HEADINFER maintains computational efficiency while\nsignificantly reducing memory footprint. We evaluate HEADINFER on the\nLlama-3-8B model with a 1-million-token sequence, reducing the GPU memory\nfootprint of the KV cache from 128 GB to 1 GB and the total GPU memory usage\nfrom 207 GB to 17 GB, achieving a 92% reduction compared to BF16 baseline\ninference. Notably, HEADINFER enables 4-million-token inference with an 8B\nmodel on a single consumer GPU with 24GB memory (e.g., NVIDIA RTX 4090) without\napproximation methods.",

By\nsetting a target fraction of total attention scores, Tactic ensures that token\nselection naturally adapts to variations in attention sparsity. To efficiently\napproximate this selection, Tactic leverages clustering-based sorting and\ndistribution fitting, allowing it to accurately estimate token importance with\nminimal computational overhead. We show that Tactic outperforms existing sparse\nattention algorithms, achieving superior accuracy and up to 7.29x decode\nattention speedup.

However, solving reasoning tasks often requires\nlong decoding chains (of thoughts), which incur $O(N)$ time and memory\nconsumption, where $N$ is the chain length. To mitigate $O(N)$ time and memory\nconsumption, existing sparsity-based algorithms propose retaining only the most\ncritical token's intermediate data (i.e., key-value cache) and discarding the\nrest. However, these existing algorithms struggle with the ``impossible\ntrinity'' of accuracy, time, and memory. For example, the state-of-the-art\nalgorithm, Quest, achieves high accuracy with $O(L)$ time but $O(N)$ memory\n($L$ is the cache budget, $L \\ll N$). To address this issue, in this paper, we\nidentify a new attention pattern during the decode stage of reasoning tasks,\nwhere milestone tokens (analogous to lemmas in mathematical proofs) emerge, are\nutilized, and then become unimportant afterward. Based on this pattern, we\npropose a new algorithm named RaaS that identifies and retains milestone tokens\nonly until they are no longer needed, achieving high accuracy with $O(L)$ time\nand $O(L)$ memory complexity.",

                    "value": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities across\nvarious domains, with recent advancements in challenging reasoning tasks such\nas mathematics and programming. However, solving reasoning tasks often requires\nlong decoding chains (of thoughts), which incur $O(N)$ time and memory\nconsumption, where $N$ is the chain length. To mitigate $O(N)$ time and memory\nconsumption, existing sparsity-based algorithms propose retaining only the most\ncritical token's intermediate data (i.e., key-value cache) and discarding the\nrest. However, these existing algorithms struggle with the ``impossible\ntrinity'' of accuracy, time, and memory. For example, the state-of-the-art\nalgorithm, Quest, achieves high accuracy with $O(L)$ time but $O(N)$ memory\n($L$ is the cache budget, $L \\ll N$). To address this issue, in this paper, we\nidentify a new attention pattern during the decode stage of reasoning tasks,\nwhere milestone tokens (analogous to lemmas in mathematical proofs) emerge, are\nutilized, and then become unimportant afterward. Based on this pattern, we\npropose a new algorithm named RaaS that identifies and retains milestone tokens\nonly until they are no longer needed, achieving high accuracy with $O(L)$ time\nand $O(L)$ memory complexity."

However, their reliance on multiple sequential forward\npasses significantly limits real-time performance. Previous acceleration\nmethods have primarily focused on reducing the number of sampling steps or\nreusing intermediate results, failing to leverage variations across spatial\nregions within the image due to the constraints of convolutional U-Net\nstructures. By harnessing the flexibility of Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) in\nhandling variable number of tokens, we introduce RAS, a novel, training-free\nsampling strategy that dynamically assigns different sampling ratios to regions\nwithin an image based on the focus of the DiT model. Our key observation is\nthat during each sampling step, the model concentrates on semantically\nmeaningful regions, and these areas of focus exhibit strong continuity across\nconsecutive steps. Leveraging this insight, RAS updates only the regions\ncurrently in focus, while other regions are updated using cached noise from the\nprevious step. The model's focus is determined based on the output from the\npreceding step, capitalizing on the temporal consistency we observed. We\nevaluate RAS on Stable Diffusion 3 and Lumina-Next-T2I, achieving speedups up\nto 2.36x and 2.51x, respectively, with minimal degradation in generation\nquality. Additionally, a user study reveals that RAS delivers comparable\nqualities under human evaluation while achieving a 1.6x speedup.

A key challenge in LLM inference is the management of the\nKey-Value (KV) cache, which reduces redundant computations but introduces\nmemory constraints. In this work, we model LLM inference with KV cache\nconstraints theoretically and propose novel batching and scheduling algorithms\nthat minimize inference latency while effectively managing the KV cache's\nmemory.\n  We analyze both semi-online and fully online scheduling models, and our\nresults are threefold. First, we provide a polynomial-time algorithm that\nachieves exact optimality in terms of average latency in the semi-online prompt\narrival model. Second, in the fully online case with a stochastic prompt\narrival, we introduce an efficient online scheduling algorithm with constant\nregret. Third, we prove that no algorithm (deterministic or randomized) can\nachieve a constant competitive ratio in fully online adversarial settings. Our\nempirical evaluations on a public LLM inference dataset, using the Llama-70B\nmodel on A100 GPUs, show that our approach significantly outperforms benchmark\nalgorithms used currently in practice, achieving lower latency while reducing\nenergy consumption.

                "summary": "Context-augmented generation (CAG) techniques, including RAG and ICL, require\nthe efficient combination of multiple contexts to generate responses to user\nqueries. Directly inputting these contexts as a sequence introduces a\nconsiderable computational burden by re-encoding the combined selection of\ncontexts for every request. To address this, we explore the promising potential\nof parallel encoding to independently pre-compute and cache each context's KV\nstates. This approach enables the direct loading of cached states during\ninference while accommodating more contexts through position reuse across\ncontexts. However, due to misalignments in attention distribution, directly\napplying parallel encoding results in a significant performance drop.

                    "value": "Context-augmented generation (CAG) techniques, including RAG and ICL, require\nthe efficient combination of multiple contexts to generate responses to user\nqueries. Directly inputting these contexts as a sequence introduces a\nconsiderable computational burden by re-encoding the combined selection of\ncontexts for every request. To address this, we explore the promising potential\nof parallel encoding to independently pre-compute and cache each context's KV\nstates. This approach enables the direct loading of cached states during\ninference while accommodating more contexts through position reuse across\ncontexts. However, due to misalignments in attention distribution, directly\napplying parallel encoding results in a significant performance drop.

GPUs are known for their strong\narithmetic computing capabilities and are highly suited for BLAS operations.\nHowever, porting code to GPUs often requires significant effort, especially for\nlarge, complex codes or legacy codes, even for BLAS-heavy applications. While\nvarious tools exist to automatically offload BLAS to GPUs, they are often\nimpractical due to the high costs associated with mandatory data transfers. The\nadvent of unified memory architectures in recent GPU designs, such as the\nNVIDIA Grace-Hopper, allows cache-coherent memory access across all types of\nmemory for both CPU and GPU, potentially eliminating the bottlenecks faced in\nconventional architectures. This breakthrough paves the way for innovative\napplication developments and porting strategies. Building on our preliminary\nwork demonstrating the potential of automatic *gemm offload, this paper extends\nthe framework to all level-3 BLAS operations and introduces SCILIB-Accel, a\nnovel tool for automatic BLAS offload. SCILIB-Accel leverages the memory\ncoherency in Grace-Hopper and introduces a Device First-Use data movement\npolicy inspired by the OpenMP First-Touch approach in multi-socket CPU\nprogramming, minimizing CPU-GPU data transfers for typical scientific computing\ncodes. Additionally, utilizing dynamic binary instrumentation, the tool\nintercepts BLAS symbols directly from a CPU binary, requiring no code\nmodifications or recompilation. SCILIB-Accel has been evaluated using multiple\nquantum physics codes on up to a few hundred GPU nodes, yielding promising\nspeedups. Notably, for the LSMS method in the MuST suite, a 3x speedup was\nachieved on Grace-Hopper compared to Grace-Grace.",

Given their potential integration\ninto many critical applications, it is important to understand the limitations\nof their visual perception. In this work, we study whether MLLMs can perceive\nsmall visual details as effectively as large ones when answering questions\nabout images. We observe that their performance is very sensitive to the size\nof the visual subject of the question, and further show that this effect is in\nfact causal by conducting an intervention study. Next, we study the attention\npatterns of MLLMs when answering visual questions, and intriguingly find that\nthey consistently know where to look, even when they provide the wrong answer.\nBased on these findings, we then propose training-free visual intervention\nmethods that leverage the internal knowledge of any MLLM itself, in the form of\nattention and gradient maps, to enhance its perception of small visual details.\nWe evaluate our proposed methods on two widely-used MLLMs and seven visual\nquestion answering benchmarks and show that they can significantly improve\nMLLMs' accuracy without requiring any training. Our results elucidate the risk\nof applying MLLMs to visual recognition tasks concerning small details and\nindicate that visual intervention using the model's internal state is a\npromising direction to mitigate this risk.",

Given their potential integration\ninto many critical applications, it is important to understand the limitations\nof their visual perception. In this work, we study whether MLLMs can perceive\nsmall visual details as effectively as large ones when answering questions\nabout images. We observe that their performance is very sensitive to the size\nof the visual subject of the question, and further show that this effect is in\nfact causal by conducting an intervention study. Next, we study the attention\npatterns of MLLMs when answering visual questions, and intriguingly find that\nthey consistently know where to look, even when they provide the wrong answer.\nBased on these findings, we then propose training-free visual intervention\nmethods that leverage the internal knowledge of any MLLM itself, in the form of\nattention and gradient maps, to enhance its perception of small visual details.\nWe evaluate our proposed methods on two widely-used MLLMs and seven visual\nquestion answering benchmarks and show that they can significantly improve\nMLLMs' accuracy without requiring any training. Our results elucidate the risk\nof applying MLLMs to visual recognition tasks concerning small details and\nindicate that visual intervention using the model's internal state is a\npromising direction to mitigate this risk."

The atmosphere has long been interpreted to be\nextremely metal-rich, out of chemical equilibrium, and potentially tidally\nheated. We present the first panchromatic emission spectrum of GJ 436b observed\nwith JWST's NIRCAM (F322W2 and F444W) and MIRI (LRS) instruments between 2.4\nand 11.9 $\\mu$m. Surprisingly, the JWST spectrum appears significantly fainter\naround 3.6 $\\mu$m than that implied by Spitzer photometry. The molecular\nabsorption features in the spectrum are relatively weak, and we only find\ntentative evidence of CO$_2$ absorption at 2$\\sigma$ significance. Under the\nassumption of a day-side blackbody, we find $T_{\\rm day}$=662.8$\\pm$5.0 K,\nwhich is similar to the zero Bond albedo equilibrium temperature. We use it to\nobtain a 3$\\sigma$ upper limit on the Bond albedo of $A_B{\\le}$0.66. To\nunderstand the spectrum we employ 1D radiative-convective models but find that\natmospheric constraints depend strongly on model assumptions. If thermochemical\nequilibrium is assumed, we find a cloudy metal-enriched atmosphere (metallicity\n$\\ge$ 300$\\times$solar). We employ 1D photochemical modeling to show that the\nobserved spectrum is also consistent with a cloud-free, relatively\nlower-metallicity atmosphere (metallicity $\\ge$ 80$\\times$solar) with a cold\ninternal temperature ($T_{\\rm int}$$\\sim$60 K). These are much lower\nmetallicities and internal temperatures than inferences from Spitzer\nphotometry. The low $T_{\\rm day}$ and non-detection of transmission features at\nhigh spectral resolution does suggest a role for cloud opacity, but this is not\ndefinitive.",

                "summary": "The Gaussian process (GP) is a widely used probabilistic machine learning\nmethod with implicit uncertainty characterization for stochastic function\napproximation, stochastic modeling, and analyzing real-world measurements of\nnonlinear processes. Traditional implementations of GPs involve stationary\nkernels (also termed covariance functions) that limit their flexibility, and\nexact methods for inference that prevent application to data sets with more\nthan about ten thousand points. Modern approaches to address stationarity\nassumptions generally fail to accommodate large data sets, while all attempts\nto address scalability focus on approximating the Gaussian likelihood, which\ncan involve subjectivity and lead to inaccuracies. In this work, we explicitly\nderive an alternative kernel that can discover and encode both sparsity and\nnonstationarity. We embed the kernel within a fully Bayesian GP model and\nleverage high-performance computing resources to enable the analysis of massive\ndata sets. We demonstrate the favorable performance of our novel kernel\nrelative to existing exact and approximate GP methods across a variety of\nsynthetic data examples. Furthermore, we conduct space-time prediction based on\nmore than one million measurements of daily maximum temperature and verify that\nour results outperform state-of-the-art methods in the Earth sciences. More\nbroadly, having access to exact GPs that use ultra-scalable,\nsparsity-discovering, nonstationary kernels allows GP methods to truly compete\nwith a wide variety of machine learning methods.",

                    "value": "The Gaussian process (GP) is a widely used probabilistic machine learning\nmethod with implicit uncertainty characterization for stochastic function\napproximation, stochastic modeling, and analyzing real-world measurements of\nnonlinear processes. Traditional implementations of GPs involve stationary\nkernels (also termed covariance functions) that limit their flexibility, and\nexact methods for inference that prevent application to data sets with more\nthan about ten thousand points. Modern approaches to address stationarity\nassumptions generally fail to accommodate large data sets, while all attempts\nto address scalability focus on approximating the Gaussian likelihood, which\ncan involve subjectivity and lead to inaccuracies. In this work, we explicitly\nderive an alternative kernel that can discover and encode both sparsity and\nnonstationarity. We embed the kernel within a fully Bayesian GP model and\nleverage high-performance computing resources to enable the analysis of massive\ndata sets. We demonstrate the favorable performance of our novel kernel\nrelative to existing exact and approximate GP methods across a variety of\nsynthetic data examples. Furthermore, we conduct space-time prediction based on\nmore than one million measurements of daily maximum temperature and verify that\nour results outperform state-of-the-art methods in the Earth sciences. More\nbroadly, having access to exact GPs that use ultra-scalable,\nsparsity-discovering, nonstationary kernels allows GP methods to truly compete\nwith a wide variety of machine learning methods."

In this work, we\nintroduce MCLM, a multilingual math benchmark featuring competition-level\nproblems in 55 languages. We test three test-time scaling methods-Outcome\nReward Modeling (ORM), Process Reward Modeling (ORM), and Budget Forcing\n(BF)-on both Qwen2.5-1.5B Math and MR1-1.5B, a multilingual LLM we trained for\nextended reasoning. Our experiments show that using Qwen2.5-1.5B Math with ORM\nachieves a score of 35.8 on MCLM, while BF on MR1-1.5B attains 35.2.

Our findings also highlight a broader concern:\nall tested models appear to have been exposed to some extent to copyrighted\ncontent.

More precisely, for\nnon-halting queries, the LLM never samples the end-of-string token <eos>. We\nrigorously analyze the conditions under which the non-halting anomaly presents\nitself. In particular, at temperature zero, we prove that if a repeating\n(cyclic) token sequence is observed at the output beyond the context size, then\nthe LLM does not halt.\n  We demonstrate non-halting queries in many experiments performed in base\nunaligned models where repeating prompts immediately lead to a non-halting\ncyclic behavior as predicted by the analysis. Further, we develop a simple\nrecipe that takes the same fixed points observed in the base model and creates\na prompt structure to target aligned models. We demonstrate the recipe's\nsuccess in sending every major model released over the past year into a\nnon-halting state with the same simple prompt even over higher temperatures.\nFurther, we devise an experiment with 100 randomly selected tokens and show\nthat the recipe to create non-halting queries succeeds with high success rates\nranging from 97% for GPT-4o to 19% for Gemini Pro 1.5. These results show that\nthe proposed adversarial recipe succeeds in bypassing alignment at one to two\norders of magnitude higher rates compared to earlier reports.\n  We also study gradient-based direct inversion using ARCA to craft new short\nprompts to induce the non-halting state. We inverted 10,000 random repeating\n2-cycle outputs for llama-3.1-8b-instruct. Out of 10,000 three-token inverted\nprompts 1,512 yield non-halting queries reaching a rate of 15%. Our experiments\nwith ARCA show that non-halting may be easily induced with as few as 3 input\ntokens with high probability.

Therefore, understanding how LLMs reason and make decisions\nis crucial for their safe deployment. This paper investigates how the\nuncertainty of responses generated by LLMs relates to the information provided\nin the input prompt. Leveraging the insight that LLMs learn to infer latent\nconcepts during pretraining, we propose a prompt-response concept model that\nexplains how LLMs generate responses and helps understand the relationship\nbetween prompts and response uncertainty. We show that the uncertainty\ndecreases as the prompt's informativeness increases, similar to epistemic\nuncertainty.

Therefore, understanding how LLMs reason and make decisions\nis crucial for their safe deployment. This paper investigates how the\nuncertainty of responses generated by LLMs relates to the information provided\nin the input prompt. Leveraging the insight that LLMs learn to infer latent\nconcepts during pretraining, we propose a prompt-response concept model that\nexplains how LLMs generate responses and helps understand the relationship\nbetween prompts and response uncertainty. We show that the uncertainty\ndecreases as the prompt's informativeness increases, similar to epistemic\nuncertainty. Our detailed experimental results on real-world datasets validate\nour proposed model."

Therefore, we thoroughly analyze the inherent\ncorrelation of layer-wise transformer attention patterns to KV cache\nquantization errors and study why key cache is more important than value cache\nfor quantization error reduction.

In this work, we\nexplore how to route the best-performing LLM for each instruction to achieve\nbetter overall performance. We develop a new paradigm, constructing capability\ninstructions with model capability representation, user instruction, and\nperformance inquiry prompts to assess the performance. To learn from capability\ninstructions, we introduce a new end-to-end framework called Model Selection\nwith Aptitude Test (Model-SAT), which generates positive and negative samples\nbased on what different models perform well or struggle with. Model-SAT uses a\nmodel capability encoder that extends its model representation to a lightweight\nLLM. Our experiments show that Model-SAT understands the performance dimensions\nof candidate models and provides the probabilities of their capability to\nhandle various instructions. Additionally, during deployment, a new model can\nquickly infer its aptitude test results across 50 tasks, each with 20 shots.\nModel-SAT performs state-of-the-art model routing without candidate inference\nand in real-world new model-released scenarios.

This observation suggests that information of\nthe segments between these separator tokens can be effectively condensed into\nthe separator tokens themselves without significant information loss. Guided by\nthis insight, we introduce SepLLM, a plug-and-play framework that accelerates\ninference by compressing these segments and eliminating redundant tokens.\nAdditionally, we implement efficient kernels for training acceleration.\nExperimental results across training-free, training-from-scratch, and\npost-training settings demonstrate SepLLM's effectiveness. Notably, using the\nLlama-3-8B backbone, SepLLM achieves over 50% reduction in KV cache on the\nGSM8K-CoT benchmark while maintaining comparable performance.

This broad class includes open or non-equilibrium systems and is\nespecially relevant to self-organising systems. The ensuing variational free\nenergy principle (FEP) has certain advantages over using random dynamical\nsystems explicitly, notably, by being more tractable and offering a\nparsimonious explanation of why the joint system evolves in the way that it\ndoes, based on the properties of the coupling between system components. Using\nthe FEP allows us to model the dynamics of an object as if it were a process of\nvariational inference, because variational free energy (or surprisal) is a\nLyapunov function for its dynamics.

This broad class includes open or non-equilibrium systems and is\nespecially relevant to self-organising systems. The ensuing variational free\nenergy principle (FEP) has certain advantages over using random dynamical\nsystems explicitly, notably, by being more tractable and offering a\nparsimonious explanation of why the joint system evolves in the way that it\ndoes, based on the properties of the coupling between system components. Using\nthe FEP allows us to model the dynamics of an object as if it were a process of\nvariational inference, because variational free energy (or surprisal) is a\nLyapunov function for its dynamics.

It features a\ntext-guided aligned speech generation mechanism, enabling real-time speech\ninteraction with both comprehension and generation capabilities. Baichuan-Audio\nleverages a pre-trained ASR model, followed by multi-codebook discretization of\nspeech at a frame rate of 12.5 Hz. This multi-codebook setup ensures that\nspeech tokens retain both semantic and acoustic information. To further enhance\nmodeling, an independent audio head is employed to process audio tokens,\neffectively capturing their unique characteristics. To mitigate the loss of\nintelligence during pre-training and preserve the original capabilities of the\nLLM, we propose a two-stage pre-training strategy that maintains language\nunderstanding while enhancing audio modeling. Following alignment, the model\nexcels in real-time speech-based conversation and exhibits outstanding\nquestion-answering capabilities, demonstrating its versatility and efficiency.\nThe proposed model demonstrates superior performance in real-time spoken\ndialogue and exhibits strong question-answering abilities.

We propose two\nprincipal innovations: (1) a position-aware convolutional shift operator that\ncaptures local syntactic patterns while preserving global coherence, and (2) a\nneurally-gated information routing mechanism that dynamically regulates\ninter-token information flow. Through comprehensive experiments on text\ngeneration tasks, our enhanced model demonstrates superior performance compared\nto the baseline RWKV, achieving 96.5 relative improvement in ROUGE-L scores\nwith only 2.95 increased inference latency. Ablation studies validate the\nindividual contributions of each component, while linguistic analysis reveals\nthe model's adaptive attention to syntactic boundaries and entity coherence.\nThe proposed modifications maintain RWKV's linear computational complexity\nwhile significantly enhancing its contextual modeling capabilities,\nestablishing new state-of-the-art performance for recurrent-style architectures\nin long-form text generation.",

We propose two\nprincipal innovations: (1) a position-aware convolutional shift operator that\ncaptures local syntactic patterns while preserving global coherence, and (2) a\nneurally-gated information routing mechanism that dynamically regulates\ninter-token information flow. Through comprehensive experiments on text\ngeneration tasks, our enhanced model demonstrates superior performance compared\nto the baseline RWKV, achieving 96.5 relative improvement in ROUGE-L scores\nwith only 2.95 increased inference latency. Ablation studies validate the\nindividual contributions of each component, while linguistic analysis reveals\nthe model's adaptive attention to syntactic boundaries and entity coherence.\nThe proposed modifications maintain RWKV's linear computational complexity\nwhile significantly enhancing its contextual modeling capabilities,\nestablishing new state-of-the-art performance for recurrent-style architectures\nin long-form text generation."

However, most RM research is centered on English and\nrelies heavily on synthetic resources, which leads to limited and less reliable\ndatasets and benchmarks for Chinese. To address this gap, we introduce\nCheemsBench, a fully human-annotated RM evaluation benchmark within Chinese\ncontexts, and CheemsPreference, a large-scale and diverse preference dataset\nannotated through human-machine collaboration to support Chinese RM training.\nWe systematically evaluate open-source discriminative and generative RMs on\nCheemsBench and observe significant limitations in their ability to capture\nhuman preferences in Chinese scenarios.

Recent measurements of\nvery-high-energy (VHE) gamma-rays ($>240$ GeV) by the HESS observatory have\ninferred the presence of ultra-relativistic electrons along Cen A's jet, yet\nthe underlying acceleration mechanism remains uncertain.

In this study, we investigate the hypothesis that knots\nare the particle acceleration sites along Cen A's jets.

By combining relativistic hydrodynamic\nsimulations and shock acceleration theory with the radio and X-ray data, we\ncompare theoretical predictions with morphological and spectral data from\ndifferent knots.

However, the high-dimensional nature\nof code representations and large knowledge bases often create efficiency\nbottlenecks, which are overlooked in previous research. This paper\nsystematically evaluates the efficiency-effectiveness trade-off of retrievers\nacross three coding tasks: Program Synthesis, Commit Message Generation, and\nAssertion Generation. We examined six retrievers: two sparse (BM25 and BM25L)\nand four dense retrievers, including one exhaustive dense retriever (SBERT's\nSemantic Search) and three approximate dense retrievers (ANNOY, LSH, and HNSW).\nOur findings show that while BM25 excels in effectiveness, it suffers in\nefficiency as the knowledge base grows beyond 1000 entries. In large-scale\nretrieval, efficiency differences become more pronounced, with approximate\ndense retrievers offering the greatest gains. For instance, in Commit\nGeneration task, HNSW achieves a 44x speed up, while only with a 1.74% drop in\nRougeL compared with BM25. Our results also show that increasing the number of\ndemonstrations in the prompt doesn't always improve the effectiveness and can\nincrease latency and lead to incorrect outputs.

Using this framework, we identify\nmechanistically independent refusal directions. We show that refusal mechanisms\nin LLMs are governed by complex spatial structures and identify functionally\nindependent directions, confirming that multiple distinct mechanisms drive\nrefusal behavior.

Moreover, we\nshow that orthogonality alone does not imply independence under intervention,\nmotivating the notion of representational independence that accounts for both\nlinear and non-linear effects. Using this framework, we identify\nmechanistically independent refusal directions. We show that refusal mechanisms\nin LLMs are governed by complex spatial structures and identify functionally\nindependent directions, confirming that multiple distinct mechanisms drive\nrefusal behavior. Our gradient-based approach uncovers these mechanisms and can\nfurther serve as a foundation for future work on understanding LLMs."

While LLMs demonstrate remarkable natural language\nunderstanding capabilities, engineering them to reliably execute complex\nbusiness workflows remains challenging.

Generally, GO communication\nadvocates for the deep integration of application targets into the network\ndesign. We consider CPS and IoT applications where sensors generate a\ntremendous amount of network traffic toward monitors or controllers. Here, the\npractical introduction of GO communication must address several challenges.\nThese include stringent timing requirements, challenging network setups, and\nlimited computing and communication capabilities of the devices involved.\nMoreover, real-life CPS deployments often rely on heterogeneous communication\nstandards prompted by specific hardware. To address these issues, we introduce\na middleware design of a GO distributed Transport Layer (TL) framework for\ncontrol applications. It offers end-to-end performance improvements for diverse\nsetups and transmitting hardware. The proposed TL protocol evaluates the Value\nof sampled state Updates (VoU) for the application goal. It decides whether to\nadmit or discard the corresponding packets, thus offloading the network. VoU\ncaptures the contribution of utilizing the updates at the receiver into the\napplication's performance. We introduce a belief network and the augmentation\nprocedure used by the sensor to predict the evolution of the control process,\nincluding possible delays and losses of status updates in the network. The\nprediction is made either using a control model dynamics or a Long-Short Term\nMemory neural network approach. We test the performance of the proposed TL in\nthe experimental framework using Industrial IoT Zolertia ReMote sensors. We\nshow that while existing approaches fail to deliver sufficient control\nperformance, our VoU-based TL scheme ensures stability and performs\n$\\sim$$60\\%$ better than the naive GO TL we proposed in our previous work.",

We introduce a belief network and the augmentation\nprocedure used by the sensor to predict the evolution of the control process,\nincluding possible delays and losses of status updates in the network. The\nprediction is made either using a control model dynamics or a Long-Short Term\nMemory neural network approach. We test the performance of the proposed TL in\nthe experimental framework using Industrial IoT Zolertia ReMote sensors. We\nshow that while existing approaches fail to deliver sufficient control\nperformance, our VoU-based TL scheme ensures stability and performs\n$\\sim$$60\\%$ better than the naive GO TL we proposed in our previous work."

                "summary": "To circumvent the alignment of large language models (LLMs), current\noptimization-based adversarial attacks usually craft adversarial prompts by\nmaximizing the likelihood of a so-called affirmative response. An affirmative\nresponse is a manually designed start of a harmful answer to an inappropriate\nrequest. While it is often easy to craft prompts that yield a substantial\nlikelihood for the affirmative response, the attacked model frequently does not\ncomplete the response in a harmful manner. Moreover, the affirmative objective\nis usually not adapted to model-specific preferences and essentially ignores\nthe fact that LLMs output a distribution over responses.

This integration introduces risks of AI-driven manipulation,\nwhere such systems may exploit users' cognitive biases and emotional\nvulnerabilities to steer them toward harmful outcomes. Through a randomized\ncontrolled trial with 233 participants, we examined human susceptibility to\nsuch manipulation in financial (e.g., purchases) and emotional (e.g., conflict\nresolution) decision-making contexts. Participants interacted with one of three\nAI agents: a neutral agent (NA) optimizing for user benefit without explicit\ninfluence, a manipulative agent (MA) designed to covertly influence beliefs and\nbehaviors, or a strategy-enhanced manipulative agent (SEMA) employing explicit\npsychological tactics to reach its hidden objectives. By analyzing\nparticipants' decision patterns and shifts in their preference ratings\npost-interaction, we found significant susceptibility to AI-driven\nmanipulation. Particularly, across both decision-making domains, participants\ninteracting with the manipulative agents shifted toward harmful options at\nsubstantially higher rates (financial, MA: 62.3%, SEMA: 59.6%; emotional, MA:\n42.3%, SEMA: 41.5%) compared to the NA group (financial, 35.8%; emotional,\n12.8%). Notably, our findings reveal that even subtle manipulative objectives\n(MA) can be as effective as employing explicit psychological strategies (SEMA)\nin swaying human decision-making. By revealing the potential for covert AI\ninfluence, this study highlights a critical vulnerability in human-AI\ninteractions, emphasizing the need for ethical safeguards and regulatory\nframeworks to ensure responsible deployment of AI technologies and protect\nhuman autonomy.",

                "summary": "Code generation is a latency-sensitive task that demands high timeliness, but\nthe autoregressive decoding mechanism of Large Language Models (LLMs) leads to\npoor inference efficiency. Existing LLM inference acceleration methods mainly\nfocus on standalone functions using only built-in components. Moreover, they\ntreat code like natural language sequences, ignoring its unique syntax and\nsemantic characteristics. As a result, the effectiveness of these approaches in\ncode generation tasks remains limited and fails to align with real-world\nprogramming scenarios. To alleviate this issue, we propose CodeSwift, a simple\nyet highly efficient inference acceleration approach specifically designed for\ncode generation, without comprising the quality of the output. CodeSwift\nconstructs a multi-source datastore, providing access to both general and\nproject-specific knowledge, facilitating the retrieval of high-quality draft\nsequences. Moreover, CodeSwift reduces retrieval cost by controlling retrieval\ntiming, and enhances efficiency through parallel retrieval and a context- and\nLLM preference-aware cache. Experimental results show that CodeSwift can reach\nup to 2.53x and 2.54x speedup compared to autoregressive decoding in\nrepository-level and standalone code generation tasks, respectively,\noutperforming state-of-the-art inference acceleration approaches by up to 88%.",

                    "value": "Code generation is a latency-sensitive task that demands high timeliness, but\nthe autoregressive decoding mechanism of Large Language Models (LLMs) leads to\npoor inference efficiency. Existing LLM inference acceleration methods mainly\nfocus on standalone functions using only built-in components. Moreover, they\ntreat code like natural language sequences, ignoring its unique syntax and\nsemantic characteristics. As a result, the effectiveness of these approaches in\ncode generation tasks remains limited and fails to align with real-world\nprogramming scenarios. To alleviate this issue, we propose CodeSwift, a simple\nyet highly efficient inference acceleration approach specifically designed for\ncode generation, without comprising the quality of the output. CodeSwift\nconstructs a multi-source datastore, providing access to both general and\nproject-specific knowledge, facilitating the retrieval of high-quality draft\nsequences. Moreover, CodeSwift reduces retrieval cost by controlling retrieval\ntiming, and enhances efficiency through parallel retrieval and a context- and\nLLM preference-aware cache. Experimental results show that CodeSwift can reach\nup to 2.53x and 2.54x speedup compared to autoregressive decoding in\nrepository-level and standalone code generation tasks, respectively,\noutperforming state-of-the-art inference acceleration approaches by up to 88%."

By integrating this pattern with a Weibull distribution of PV\npanel and wind turbine lifespans, we estimate the annual production required\nfor both expansion and maintenance. Our findings highlight two key factors\ninfluencing production dynamics: deployment speed and lifespan. When deployment\noccurs faster than the average lifespan, production overshoots and exhibits\ndamped oscillations due to successive installation and replacement cycles. In\ncontrast, gradual deployment leads to a smooth increase before stabilizing at\nthe renewal rate. Given current scenarios, the PV industry is likely to\nexperience significant oscillations - ranging from 15 % to 60 % of global\nproduction - while wind power follows a monotonic growth trajectory. These\noscillations, driven by ambitious energy targets, may result in cycles of\noverproduction and underproduction, affecting industrial stability. Beyond\nsolar and wind, this study underscores a broader challenge in the energy\ntransition: shifting from infrastructure expansion to long-term maintenance.\nAddressing this phase is crucial for ensuring the resilience and sustainability\nof renewable energy systems beyond 2050.",

This paper introduces LLM-QE, a novel approach that leverages\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) to generate document-based query expansions,\nthereby enhancing dense retrieval models. Unlike traditional methods, LLM-QE\ndesigns both rank-based and answer-based rewards and uses these reward models\nto optimize LLMs to align with the ranking preferences of both retrievers and\nLLMs, thus mitigating the hallucination of LLMs during query expansion. Our\nexperiments on the zero-shot dense retrieval model, Contriever, demonstrate the\neffectiveness of LLM-QE, achieving an improvement of over 8%. Furthermore, by\nincorporating answer-based reward modeling, LLM-QE generates more relevant and\nprecise information related to the documents, rather than simply producing\nredundant tokens to maximize rank-based rewards. Notably, LLM-QE also improves\nthe training process of dense retrievers, achieving a more than 5% improvement\nafter fine-tuning. All codes are available at https://github.com/NEUIR/LLM-QE.",

Unlike traditional methods, LLM-QE\ndesigns both rank-based and answer-based rewards and uses these reward models\nto optimize LLMs to align with the ranking preferences of both retrievers and\nLLMs, thus mitigating the hallucination of LLMs during query expansion. Our\nexperiments on the zero-shot dense retrieval model, Contriever, demonstrate the\neffectiveness of LLM-QE, achieving an improvement of over 8%. Furthermore, by\nincorporating answer-based reward modeling, LLM-QE generates more relevant and\nprecise information related to the documents, rather than simply producing\nredundant tokens to maximize rank-based rewards. Notably, LLM-QE also improves\nthe training process of dense retrievers, achieving a more than 5% improvement\nafter fine-tuning. All codes are available at https://github.com/NEUIR/LLM-QE."

To\naddress this challenge, we introduce VisCon-100K, a novel dataset derived from\ninterleaved image-text web documents. Our approach transforms 45K web documents\nfrom the OBELICS dataset into 100K image conversation samples. We utilize\nGPT-4V to generate image-contextual captions and OpenChat 3.5 model to convert\nthese captions into diverse free-form and multiple-choice question-answer\npairs. Integrating this dataset for fine-tuning considerably enhances VLM\nperformance across multiple benchmarks. Unlike methods that focus solely on\nfine-grained visual content, our approach leverages accompanying web context,\nyielding superior results. We also discover that a 'leaky modality mix', where\nconversation samples contain questions answerable from both the image and its\ncontextual caption, outperforms non-leaky combinations of captions and Q&A\npairs. VisCon-100k dataset shows strong performance with two popular VLM\napproaches: text-only large language model (LLM) aligned with a vision encoder\nusing image captions data (ShareGPT4V-7b) and multimodally pretrained LLM\n(IDEFICS2-8b) using interleaved image-text data. In addition to releasing the\nVisCon-100K dataset, we provide a contextual captioner trained on this dataset,\nfacilitating scalable fine-tuning data generation for future research and\nopen-source applications.

It consists of two key\nstructures: rhetorical structure and topic structure. The former captures the\nlogical flow of conversations, while the latter detects transitions between\ntopics. Together, they improve the ability of a dialogue system to track\nconversation dynamics and generate contextually relevant high-quality\nresponses. These structures are typically identified through discourse parsing\nand topic segmentation, respectively. However, existing supervised methods rely\non costly manual annotations, while unsupervised methods often focus on a\nsingle task, overlooking the deep linguistic interplay between rhetorical and\ntopic structures. To address these issues, we first introduce a unified\nrepresentation that integrates rhetorical and topic structures, ensuring\nsemantic consistency between them. Under the unified representation, we further\npropose two linguistically grounded hypotheses based on discourse theories: (1)\nLocal Discourse Coupling, where rhetorical cues dynamically enhance topic-aware\ninformation flow, and (2) Global Topology Constraint, where topic structure\npatterns probabilistically constrain rhetorical relation distributions.\nBuilding on the unified representation and two hypotheses, we propose an\nunsupervised mutual learning framework (UMLF) that jointly models rhetorical\nand topic structures, allowing them to mutually reinforce each other without\nrequiring additional annotations. We evaluate our approach on two rhetorical\ndatasets and three topic segmentation datasets. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that our method surpasses all strong baselines built on pre-trained\nlanguage models. Furthermore, when applied to LLMs, our framework achieves\nnotable improvements, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving discourse\nstructure modeling.",

Thus, the proposed system\nconsidered this limitation and developed an enhanced LLM-based framework for\ncross-modal query understanding using DL-KeyBERT-based CAZSSCL-MPGPT. The\ncollected dataset consists of pre-processed images and texts. The preprocessed\nimages then undergo object segmentation using Easom-You Only Look Once\n(E-YOLO).

Further, features\nare extracted from the knowledge graph, generated skeletons, and segmented\nobjects. The optimal features are then selected using the Fossa Optimization\nAlgorithm (FOA). Meanwhile, the text undergoes word embedding using DL-KeyBERT.\nFinally, the cross-modal query understanding system utilizes CAZSSCL-MPGPT to\ngenerate accurate and contextually relevant image descriptions as text.
