                "summary": "Disaggregating memory from compute offers the opportunity to better utilize\nstranded memory in data centers. It is important to cache data in the compute\nnodes and maintain cache coherence across multiple compute nodes to save on\nround-trip communication cost between the disaggregated memory and the compute\nnodes. However, the limited computing power on the disaggregated memory servers\nmakes it challenging to maintain cache coherence among multiple compute-side\ncaches over disaggregated shared memory. This paper introduces SELCC; a\nShared-Exclusive Latch Cache Coherence protocol that maintains cache coherence\nwithout imposing any computational burden on the remote memory side. SELCC\nbuilds on a one-sided shared-exclusive latch protocol by introducing lazy latch\nrelease and invalidation messages among the compute nodes so that it can\nguarantee both data access atomicity and cache coherence. SELCC minimizes\ncommunication round-trips by embedding the current cache copy holder IDs into\nRDMA latch words and prioritizes local concurrency control over global\nconcurrency control. We instantiate the SELCC protocol onto compute-sided\ncache, forming an abstraction layer over disaggregated memory. This abstraction\nlayer provides main-memory-like APIs to upper-level applications, and thus\nenabling existing data structures and algorithms to function over disaggregated\nmemory with minimal code change. To demonstrate the usability of SELCC, we\nimplement a B-tree and three transaction concurrency control algorithms over\nSELCC's APIs.

                    "value": "Disaggregating memory from compute offers the opportunity to better utilize\nstranded memory in data centers. It is important to cache data in the compute\nnodes and maintain cache coherence across multiple compute nodes to save on\nround-trip communication cost between the disaggregated memory and the compute\nnodes. However, the limited computing power on the disaggregated memory servers\nmakes it challenging to maintain cache coherence among multiple compute-side\ncaches over disaggregated shared memory. This paper introduces SELCC; a\nShared-Exclusive Latch Cache Coherence protocol that maintains cache coherence\nwithout imposing any computational burden on the remote memory side. SELCC\nbuilds on a one-sided shared-exclusive latch protocol by introducing lazy latch\nrelease and invalidation messages among the compute nodes so that it can\nguarantee both data access atomicity and cache coherence. SELCC minimizes\ncommunication round-trips by embedding the current cache copy holder IDs into\nRDMA latch words and prioritizes local concurrency control over global\nconcurrency control. We instantiate the SELCC protocol onto compute-sided\ncache, forming an abstraction layer over disaggregated memory. This abstraction\nlayer provides main-memory-like APIs to upper-level applications, and thus\nenabling existing data structures and algorithms to function over disaggregated\nmemory with minimal code change. To demonstrate the usability of SELCC, we\nimplement a B-tree and three transaction concurrency control algorithms over\nSELCC's APIs. Micro-benchmark results show that the SELCC protocol achieves\nbetter performance compared to RPC-based cache-coherence protocols.\nAdditionally, YCSB and TPC-C benchmarks indicate that applications over SELCC\ncan achieve comparable or superior performance against competitors over\ndisaggregated memory."

FDIP is\ndriven by the Branch Prediction Unit (BPU), relying on the BPU's accuracy and\nbranch target tracking structures to speculatively fetch instructions into the\nInstruction Cache (L1I). As data center applications become more complex, their\ncode footprints also grow, resulting in an increase in Branch Target Buffer\n(BTB) misses. FDIP can alleviate L1I cache misses, but when it encounters a BTB\nmiss, the BPU may not identify the current instruction as a branch to FDIP.\nThis can prevent FDIP from prefetching or cause it to speculate down the wrong\npath, further polluting the L1I cache.

QET leverages the\nlocal structure of matrix elements by iteratively swapping elements to create a\nlocally ordered matrix, which is then grouped and quantized column by column.\nTo enhance QET, we introduce two optimizations: residual quantization to\nfurther reduce Mean Squared Error (MSE) and masking with batch processing to\naccelerate the algorithm.\n  Our experiments demonstrate that QET can reduce MSE to 12.3% of its original\nvalue at the same compression ratio, outperforming leading baseline methods.\nOur contributions include framing the QEM problem specifically for LLM and KV\ncache compression, developing the QET algorithm, and implementing optimizations\nthat improve accuracy and processing speed."

                "summary": "Massive off-chip accesses in GPUs are the main performance bottleneck, and we\ndivided these accesses into three types: (1) Write, (2) Data-Read, and (3)\nRead-Only. Besides, We find that many writes are duplicate, and the duplication\ncan be inter-dup and intra-dup. While inter-dup means different memory blocks\nare identical, and intra-dup means all the 4B elements in a line are the same.\nIn this work, we propose a cache-assisted GPU memory deduplication architecture\nnamed CMD to reduce the off-chip accesses via utilizing the data duplication in\nGPU applications. CMD includes three key design contributions which aim to\nreduce the three kinds of accesses: (1) A novel GPU memory deduplication\narchitecture that removes the inter-dup and inter-dup lines. As for the\ninter-dup detection, we reduce the extra read requests caused by the\ntraditional read-verify hash process. Besides, we design several techniques to\nmanage duplicate blocks. (2) We propose a cache-assisted read scheme to reduce\nthe reads to duplicate data. When an L2 cache miss wants to read the duplicate\nblock, if the reference block has been fetched to L2 and it is clean, we can\ncopy it to the L2 missed block without accessing off-chip DRAM. As for the\nreads to intra-dup data, CMD uses the on-chip metadata cache to get the data.\n(3) When a cache line is evicted, the clean sectors in the line are invalidated\nwhile the dirty sectors are written back. However, most read-only victims are\nre-referenced from DRAM more than twice. Therefore, we add a full-associate\nFIFO to accommodate the read-only (it is also clean) victims to reduce the\nre-reference counts. Experiments show that CMD can decrease the off-chip\naccesses by 31.01%, reduce the energy by 32.78% and improve performance by\n37.79%. Besides, CMD can improve the performance of memory-intensive workloads\nby 50.18%.",

                "summary": "Recent large language model applications, such as Retrieval-Augmented\nGeneration and chatbots, have led to an increased need to process longer input\ncontexts. However, this requirement is hampered by inherent limitations.\nArchitecturally, models are constrained by a context window defined during\ntraining. Additionally, processing extensive texts requires substantial GPU\nmemory. We propose a novel approach, Finch, to compress the input context by\nleveraging the pre-trained model weights of the self-attention.

However, this requirement is hampered by inherent limitations.\nArchitecturally, models are constrained by a context window defined during\ntraining. Additionally, processing extensive texts requires substantial GPU\nmemory. We propose a novel approach, Finch, to compress the input context by\nleveraging the pre-trained model weights of the self-attention.

                "summary": "Recent advances in edge computing~(EC) have pushed cloud-based data caching\nservices to edge, however, such emerging edge storage comes with numerous\nchallenging and unique security issues. One of them is the problem of edge data\nintegrity verification (EDIV) which coordinates multiple participants (e.g.,\ndata owners and edge nodes) to inspect whether data cached on edge is\nauthentic. To date, various solutions have been proposed to address the EDIV\nproblem, while there is no systematic review. Thus, we offer a comprehensive\nsurvey for the first time, aiming to show current research status, open\nproblems, and potentially promising insights for readers to further investigate\nthis under-explored field. Specifically, we begin by stating the significance\nof the EDIV problem, the integrity verification difference between data cached\non cloud and edge, and three typical system models with corresponding\ninspection processes.

                    "value": "Recent advances in edge computing~(EC) have pushed cloud-based data caching\nservices to edge, however, such emerging edge storage comes with numerous\nchallenging and unique security issues. One of them is the problem of edge data\nintegrity verification (EDIV) which coordinates multiple participants (e.g.,\ndata owners and edge nodes) to inspect whether data cached on edge is\nauthentic. To date, various solutions have been proposed to address the EDIV\nproblem, while there is no systematic review. Thus, we offer a comprehensive\nsurvey for the first time, aiming to show current research status, open\nproblems, and potentially promising insights for readers to further investigate\nthis under-explored field. Specifically, we begin by stating the significance\nof the EDIV problem, the integrity verification difference between data cached\non cloud and edge, and three typical system models with corresponding\ninspection processes.

However, these\nstudies only focus on one or several characteristics of NVM, while failing to\nexploit its best practice by putting NVM in the proper position of the whole\nstorage stack. In this paper, we present NVPC, a transparent acceleration to\nexisting kernel file systems with an NVM-enhanced page cache. The acceleration\nlies in two aspects, respectively matching the desperate needs of existing disk\nfile systems: sync writes and cache-missed operations. Besides, the fast DRAM\npage cache is preserved for cache-hit operations. For sync writes, a\nhigh-performance log-based sync absorbing area is provided to redirect data\ndestination from the slow disk to the fast NVM. Meanwhile, the byte-addressable\nfeature of NVM is used to prevent write amplification. For cache-missed\noperations, NVPC makes use of the idle space on NVM to extend the DRAM page\ncache, so that more and larger workloads can fit into the cache. NVPC is\nentirely implemented as a page cache, thus can provide efficient speed-up to\ndisk file systems with full transparency to users and full compatibility to\nlower file systems.\n  In Filebench macro-benchmarks, NVPC achieves at most 3.55x, 2.84x, and 2.64x\nfaster than NOVA, Ext-4, and SPFS. In RocksDB workloads with working set larger\nthan DRAM, NVPC achieves 1.12x, 2.59x, and 2.11x faster than NOVA, Ext-4, and\nSPFS. Meanwhile, NVPC gains positive revenue from NOVA, Ext-4, and SPFS in\n62.5% of the tested cases in our read/write/sync mixed evaluation,\ndemonstrating that NVPC is more balanced and adaptive to complex real-world\nworkloads. Experimental results also show that NVPC is the only method that\naccelerates Ext-4 in particular cases for up to 15.19x, with no slow-down to\nany other use cases.",

We\nshow that the proposed ML model achieves $R^2$ scores greater than 0.97 and\nmiss-predicts performance by less than 1 iteration per second on average.\nExperimental results on LLM inference traces show that \\textit{throttLL'eM}\nachieves up to 43.8\\% lower energy consumption and an energy efficiency\nimprovement of at least $1.71\\times$ under SLOs, when compared to NVIDIA's\nTriton server."

To optimize offloading, MoE-Infinity\nachieves novel request-level tracing for expert activation, capturing MoE's\nsparse execution patterns such as selective activation, group activation, and\nskewed reuse. Leveraging the request-level trace, MoE-Infinity performs\neffective expert prefetching and expert caching, achieving high efficiency in\ntransferring model parameters from host memory to GPU memory. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that MoE-Infinity achieves low latency comparable to\nexpensive full-GPU deployments, which require up to 4X more GPU resources than\nMoE-Infinity. Compared to offloading-supporting LLM serving systems such as\nDeepSpeed-Inference, Llama.cpp, Mixtral Offloading, and BrainStorm,\nMoE-Infinity exhibits superior latency performance, providing 2-20X\nimprovements when serving various MoE models for a large collection of LLM\ntasks.

To solve this, we propose\nAccumulative Attention Score with Forgetting Factor (A2SF) technique, which\nintroduces a Forgetting Factor in the Attention Score accumulation process.\nA2SF applies a penalty to the past Attention Score generated from old tokens by\nrepeatedly multiplying the Forgetting Factor to the Attention Score over time.\nTherefore, older tokens receive a larger penalty, providing fairness among\ndifferent ages of tokens. Through the fair comparison among tokens, we can more\neffectively select important tokens.

                "summary": "Sparse matrix computation is crucial in various modern applications,\nincluding large-scale graph analytics, deep learning, and recommender systems.\nThe performance of sparse kernels varies greatly depending on the structure of\nthe input matrix, making it difficult to gain a comprehensive understanding of\nsparse computation and its relationship to inputs, algorithms, and target\nmachine architecture. Despite extensive research on certain sparse kernels,\nsuch as Sparse Matrix-Vector Multiplication (SpMV), the overall family of\nsparse algorithms has yet to be investigated as a whole. This paper introduces\nSpChar, a workload characterization methodology for general sparse computation.\nSpChar employs tree-based models to identify the most relevant hardware and\ninput characteristics, starting from hardware and input-related metrics\ngathered from Performance Monitoring Counters (PMCs) and matrices. Our analysis\nenables the creation of a characterization loop that facilitates the\noptimization of sparse computation by mapping the impact of architectural\nfeatures to inputs and algorithmic choices. We apply SpChar to more than 600\nmatrices from the SuiteSparse Matrix collection and three state-of-the-art Arm\nCPUs to determine the critical hardware and software characteristics that\naffect sparse computation. In our analysis, we determine that the biggest\nlimiting factors for high-performance sparse computation are (1) the latency of\nthe memory system, (2) the pipeline flush overhead resulting from branch\nmisprediction, and (3) the poor reuse of cached elements. Additionally, we\npropose software and hardware optimizations that designers can implement to\ncreate a platform suitable for sparse computation.

                    "value": "Sparse matrix computation is crucial in various modern applications,\nincluding large-scale graph analytics, deep learning, and recommender systems.\nThe performance of sparse kernels varies greatly depending on the structure of\nthe input matrix, making it difficult to gain a comprehensive understanding of\nsparse computation and its relationship to inputs, algorithms, and target\nmachine architecture. Despite extensive research on certain sparse kernels,\nsuch as Sparse Matrix-Vector Multiplication (SpMV), the overall family of\nsparse algorithms has yet to be investigated as a whole. This paper introduces\nSpChar, a workload characterization methodology for general sparse computation.\nSpChar employs tree-based models to identify the most relevant hardware and\ninput characteristics, starting from hardware and input-related metrics\ngathered from Performance Monitoring Counters (PMCs) and matrices. Our analysis\nenables the creation of a characterization loop that facilitates the\noptimization of sparse computation by mapping the impact of architectural\nfeatures to inputs and algorithmic choices. We apply SpChar to more than 600\nmatrices from the SuiteSparse Matrix collection and three state-of-the-art Arm\nCPUs to determine the critical hardware and software characteristics that\naffect sparse computation. In our analysis, we determine that the biggest\nlimiting factors for high-performance sparse computation are (1) the latency of\nthe memory system, (2) the pipeline flush overhead resulting from branch\nmisprediction, and (3) the poor reuse of cached elements. Additionally, we\npropose software and hardware optimizations that designers can implement to\ncreate a platform suitable for sparse computation. We then investigate these\noptimizations using the gem5 simulator to achieve a significant speedup of up\nto 2.63x compared to a CPU where the optimizations are not applied."

Only a very small fraction is captured upon returning to the vicinity of\nthe supermassive black hole. Nearly all the debris returns to the apocenter,\nwhere shocks produce a thick irregular cloud on this radial scale and power the\noptical/UV flare. These simulation results imply that over a few years, the\nthick cloud settles into an accretion flow responsible for the long term\nemission. Despite not being designed to match observations, the dynamical\npicture given by the three simulations aligns well with observations of typical\nevents, correctly predicting the flares' total radiated energy, luminosity,\ntemperature and emission line width. On the basis of these predictions, we\nprovide an updated method ({\\sc TDEmass}) to infer the stellar and black hole\nmasses from a flare's peak luminosity and temperature. This picture also\ncorrectly predicts the luminosity observed years after the flare.

This enhancement was consistent across low, medium, and high\ncomplexity queries, indicating the critical role of contextual knowledge in\nquery generation.\n  Discussion: The integration of a business context document markedly improved\nthe LLM's ability to generate accurate and contextually relevant SQL queries.\nPerformance achieved a maximum of 85\\% when high complexity queries are\nexcluded, suggesting promise for routine deployment.\n  Conclusion: This study presents a novel approach to employing LLMs for safety\ndata retrieval and analysis, demonstrating significant advancements in query\ngeneration accuracy. The methodology offers a framework applicable to various\ndata-intensive domains, enhancing the accessibility and efficiency of\ninformation retrieval for non-technical users."

                "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have obtained promising results in mathematical\nreasoning, which is a foundational skill for human intelligence. Most previous\nstudies focus on improving and measuring the performance of LLMs based on\ntextual math reasoning datasets (e.g., MATH, GSM8K). Recently, a few\nresearchers have released English multimodal math datasets (e.g., MATHVISTA and\nMATH-V) to evaluate the effectiveness of large multimodal models (LMMs). In\nthis paper, we release a Chinese multimodal math (CMM-Math) dataset, including\nbenchmark and training parts, to evaluate and enhance the mathematical\nreasoning of LMMs. CMM-Math contains over 28,000 high-quality samples,\nfeaturing a variety of problem types (e.g., multiple-choice, fill-in-the-blank,\nand so on) with detailed solutions across 12 grade levels from elementary to\nhigh school in China. Specifically, the visual context may be present in the\nquestions or opinions, which makes this dataset more challenging. Through\ncomprehensive analysis, we discover that state-of-the-art LMMs on the CMM-Math\ndataset face challenges, emphasizing the necessity for further improvements in\nLMM development. We also propose a Multimodal Mathematical LMM (Math-LMM) to\nhandle the problems with mixed input of multiple images and text segments.

                    "value": "Large language models (LLMs) have obtained promising results in mathematical\nreasoning, which is a foundational skill for human intelligence. Most previous\nstudies focus on improving and measuring the performance of LLMs based on\ntextual math reasoning datasets (e.g., MATH, GSM8K). Recently, a few\nresearchers have released English multimodal math datasets (e.g., MATHVISTA and\nMATH-V) to evaluate the effectiveness of large multimodal models (LMMs). In\nthis paper, we release a Chinese multimodal math (CMM-Math) dataset, including\nbenchmark and training parts, to evaluate and enhance the mathematical\nreasoning of LMMs. CMM-Math contains over 28,000 high-quality samples,\nfeaturing a variety of problem types (e.g., multiple-choice, fill-in-the-blank,\nand so on) with detailed solutions across 12 grade levels from elementary to\nhigh school in China. Specifically, the visual context may be present in the\nquestions or opinions, which makes this dataset more challenging. Through\ncomprehensive analysis, we discover that state-of-the-art LMMs on the CMM-Math\ndataset face challenges, emphasizing the necessity for further improvements in\nLMM development. We also propose a Multimodal Mathematical LMM (Math-LMM) to\nhandle the problems with mixed input of multiple images and text segments. We\ntrain our model using three stages, including foundational pre-training,\nfoundational fine-tuning, and mathematical fine-tuning. The extensive\nexperiments indicate that our model effectively improves math reasoning\nperformance by comparing it with the SOTA LMMs over three multimodal\nmathematical datasets."

Understanding and\nexecuting complex rules, along with multi-step planning, are fundamental to\nlogical reasoning and critical for practical LLM agents and decision-making\nsystems. However, evaluating LLMs as effective rule-based executors and\nplanners remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce LogicGame, a novel\nbenchmark designed to evaluate the comprehensive rule understanding, execution,\nand planning capabilities of LLMs. Unlike traditional benchmarks, LogicGame\nprovides diverse games that contain a series of rules with an initial state,\nrequiring models to comprehend and apply predefined regulations to solve\nproblems. We create simulated scenarios in which models execute or plan\noperations to achieve specific outcomes. These game scenarios are specifically\ndesigned to distinguish logical reasoning from mere knowledge by relying\nexclusively on predefined rules. This separation allows for a pure assessment\nof rule-based reasoning capabilities. The evaluation considers not only final\noutcomes but also intermediate steps, providing a comprehensive assessment of\nmodel performance. Moreover, these intermediate steps are deterministic and can\nbe automatically verified. LogicGame defines game scenarios with varying\ndifficulty levels, from simple rule applications to complex reasoning chains,\nin order to offer a precise evaluation of model performance on rule\nunderstanding and multi-step execution. Utilizing LogicGame, we test various\nLLMs and identify notable shortcomings in their rule-based logical reasoning\nabilities.",

This negation blindness refers to LLMs inability to correctly\ncomprehend NO related natural language prompts to generate the desired images.\nInterestingly, all tested LLMs including GPT-4, Gemini, and Copilot were found\nto be suffering from this syndrome. To demonstrate the generalization of this\nlimitation, we carried out simulation experiments and conducted entropy-based\nand benchmark statistical analysis tests on various LLMs in multiple languages,\nincluding English, Hindi, and French. We conclude that the NO syndrome is a\nsignificant flaw in current LLMs that needs to be addressed. A related finding\nof this study showed a consistent discrepancy between image and textual\nresponses as a result of this NO syndrome.

The epitaxial films were prepared by molecular beam epitaxy and\ntheir magnetic properties explored by element-specific x-ray magnetic circular\ndichroism that showed ferromagnetic ordering up to 375 K. Both surface and bulk\nsensitive x-ray absorption modes were used to confirm that the magnetic signal\nis of an intrinsic nature. Fe occupation within the van der Waals gap was\ndetermined by x-ray diffraction which showed a notably higher occupation with\nrespect to bulk crystals. We thus infer, supported by first-principles\ncalculations, that the higher magnetic ordering temperature results from an\nincreased exchange interaction between the individual Fe5GeTe2 layers mediated\nby Fe atoms residing within the van der Waals gaps.

It has been successfully applied for many complex models.\nHowever, its wider application is limited by two issues. First, weight\nselection of marginal likelihood can have a significant impact on the\ninformation efficiency and is currently an open question.

Traditional\napproaches relying on pre-trained models necessitate extensive domain-specific\ndata and considerable reward feedback, with their lack of real-time\nadaptability hindering their effectiveness in dynamic environments. In this\npaper, we introduce the Graph Retrieval Augmented Reasoning (GRATR) framework,\nleveraging the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technique to bolster\ntrustworthiness reasoning in agents. GRATR constructs a dynamic trustworthiness\ngraph, updating it in real-time with evidential information, and retrieves\nrelevant trust data to augment the reasoning capabilities of Large Language\nModels (LLMs). We validate our approach through experiments on the multiplayer\ngame \"Werewolf,\" comparing GRATR against baseline LLM and LLM enhanced with\nNative RAG and Rerank RAG. Our results demonstrate that GRATR surpasses the\nbaseline methods by over 30\\% in winning rate, with superior reasoning\nperformance. Moreover, GRATR effectively mitigates LLM hallucinations, such as\nidentity and objective amnesia, and crucially, it renders the reasoning process\nmore transparent and traceable through the use of the trustworthiness graph.",

In this\npaper, we introduce the Graph Retrieval Augmented Reasoning (GRATR) framework,\nleveraging the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technique to bolster\ntrustworthiness reasoning in agents. GRATR constructs a dynamic trustworthiness\ngraph, updating it in real-time with evidential information, and retrieves\nrelevant trust data to augment the reasoning capabilities of Large Language\nModels (LLMs). We validate our approach through experiments on the multiplayer\ngame \"Werewolf,\" comparing GRATR against baseline LLM and LLM enhanced with\nNative RAG and Rerank RAG. Our results demonstrate that GRATR surpasses the\nbaseline methods by over 30\\% in winning rate, with superior reasoning\nperformance. Moreover, GRATR effectively mitigates LLM hallucinations, such as\nidentity and objective amnesia, and crucially, it renders the reasoning process\nmore transparent and traceable through the use of the trustworthiness graph."

                "summary": "Real-world autonomous driving systems must make safe decisions in the face of\nrare and diverse traffic scenarios. Current state-of-the-art planners are\nmostly evaluated on real-world datasets like nuScenes (open-loop) or nuPlan\n(closed-loop). In particular, nuPlan seems to be an expressive evaluation\nmethod since it is based on real-world data and closed-loop, yet it mostly\ncovers basic driving scenarios.

Current research\nhas not thoroughly assessed potential biases in the sociodemographic population\nrepresented within the language model's framework. Additionally, the subjective\nworlds of LLMs often show inconsistencies in how closely their responses match\nthose of groups of human respondents. In this paper, we used ChatGPT-3.5 to\nsimulate the sampling process and generated six socioeconomic characteristics\nfrom the 2020 US population. We also analyzed responses to questions about\nincome inequality and gender roles to explore GPT's subjective attitudes. By\nusing repeated random sampling, we created a sampling distribution to identify\nthe parameters of the GPT-generated population and compared these with Census\ndata.

Current research\nhas not thoroughly assessed potential biases in the sociodemographic population\nrepresented within the language model's framework. Additionally, the subjective\nworlds of LLMs often show inconsistencies in how closely their responses match\nthose of groups of human respondents. In this paper, we used ChatGPT-3.5 to\nsimulate the sampling process and generated six socioeconomic characteristics\nfrom the 2020 US population. We also analyzed responses to questions about\nincome inequality and gender roles to explore GPT's subjective attitudes. By\nusing repeated random sampling, we created a sampling distribution to identify\nthe parameters of the GPT-generated population and compared these with Census\ndata.

                "summary": "Deep learning (DL) techniques are increasingly pervasive across various\ndomains, including wireless communication, where they extract insights from raw\nradio signals. However, the computational demands of DL pose significant\nchallenges, particularly in distributed wireless networks like Cell-free\nnetworks, where deploying DL models on edge devices becomes hard due to\nheightened computational loads. These computational loads escalate with larger\ninput sizes, often correlating with improved model performance. To mitigate\nthis challenge, Early Exiting (EE) techniques have been introduced in DL,\nprimarily targeting the depth of the model. This approach enables models to\nexit during inference based on specified criteria, leveraging entropy measures\nat intermediate exits. Doing so makes less complex samples exit early, reducing\nthe average computational load and inference time.

                    "value": "Deep learning (DL) techniques are increasingly pervasive across various\ndomains, including wireless communication, where they extract insights from raw\nradio signals. However, the computational demands of DL pose significant\nchallenges, particularly in distributed wireless networks like Cell-free\nnetworks, where deploying DL models on edge devices becomes hard due to\nheightened computational loads. These computational loads escalate with larger\ninput sizes, often correlating with improved model performance. To mitigate\nthis challenge, Early Exiting (EE) techniques have been introduced in DL,\nprimarily targeting the depth of the model. This approach enables models to\nexit during inference based on specified criteria, leveraging entropy measures\nat intermediate exits. Doing so makes less complex samples exit early, reducing\nthe average computational load and inference time.

One object is\nspectroscopically confirmed at $z_{\\rm spec}=5.051$, while the other has a\nrobust $z_{\\rm phot}=6.7\\pm0.3$. Thanks to their extremely red colors\n($F277W-F444W\\sim1.7$ mag), these galaxies satisfy the nominal color-selection\nfor the widely-studied ``little red dot\" (LRD) population with the exception of\ntheir spatially-resolved morphologies.

To\naddress the growing complexity of transmission encryption techniques, various\nmachine learning and deep learning methods have been proposed. However,\nexisting approaches face two main challenges. Firstly, they struggle with model\ninefficiency due to the quadratic complexity of the widely used Transformer\narchitecture. Secondly, they suffer from inadequate traffic representation\nbecause of discarding important byte information while retaining unwanted\nbiases. To address these challenges, we propose NetMamba, an efficient\nlinear-time state space model equipped with a comprehensive traffic\nrepresentation scheme. We adopt a specially selected and improved\nunidirectional Mamba architecture for the networking field, instead of the\nTransformer, to address efficiency issues. In addition, we design a traffic\nrepresentation scheme to extract valid information from massive traffic data\nwhile removing biased information. Evaluation experiments on six public\ndatasets encompassing three main classification tasks showcase NetMamba's\nsuperior classification performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines. It\nachieves an accuracy rate of nearly 99% (some over 99%) in all tasks.\nAdditionally, NetMamba demonstrates excellent efficiency, improving inference\nspeed by up to 60 times while maintaining comparably low memory usage.\nFurthermore, NetMamba exhibits superior few-shot learning abilities, achieving\nbetter classification performance with fewer labeled data.

This information is provided in an unstructured fashion and\nautomated approaches are applied to extract relevant parameters. To ease this\nprocess, log parsing can be applied, which transforms log messages into\nstructured log templates. Recent advances in language models have led to\nseveral studies that apply ChatGPT to the task of log parsing with promising\nresults. However, the performance of other state-of-the-art large language\nmodels (LLMs) on the log parsing task remains unclear.\n  Aims: In this study, we investigate the current capability of\nstate-of-the-art LLMs to perform log parsing.\n  Method: We select six recent LLMs, including both paid proprietary (GPT-3.5,\nClaude 2.1) and four free-to-use open models, and compare their performance on\nsystem logs obtained from a selection of mature open-source projects. We design\ntwo different prompting approaches and apply the LLMs on 1, 354 log templates\nacross 16 different projects. We evaluate their effectiveness, in the number of\ncorrectly identified templates, and the syntactic similarity between the\ngenerated templates and the ground truth.\n  Results: We found that free-to-use models are able to compete with paid\nmodels, with CodeLlama extracting 10% more log templates correctly than\nGPT-3.5. Moreover, we provide qualitative insights into the usability of\nlanguage models (e.g., how easy it is to use their responses).\n  Conclusions: Our results reveal that some of the smaller, free-to-use LLMs\ncan considerably assist log parsing compared to their paid proprietary\ncompetitors, especially code-specialized models.",

Traditional fingerprint-based localization\nmethods, which infer coordinates from channel information within pre-set\nrectangular areas, often face challenges due to the heterogeneous distribution\nof fingerprints inherent in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios, particularly\nwithin orthogonal frequency division multiplexing systems. To overcome this\nlimitation, we develop a novel multi-sources information fusion learning\nframework referred to as the Autosync Multi-Domains NLOS Localization\n(AMDNLoc). Specifically, AMDNLoc employs a two-stage matched filter fused with\na target tracking algorithm and iterative centroid-based clustering to\nautomatically and irregularly segment NLOS regions, ensuring uniform\ndistribution within channel state information across frequency, power, and\ntime-delay domains. Additionally, the framework utilizes a segment-specific\nlinear classifier array, coupled with deep residual network-based feature\nextraction and fusion, to establish the correlation function between\nfingerprint features and coordinates within these regions. Simulation results\nreveal that AMDNLoc achieves an impressive NLOS localization accuracy of 1.46\nmeters on typical wireless artificial intelligence research datasets and\ndemonstrates significant improvements in interpretability, adaptability, and\nscalability.",

As the network configuration in a practical setup can change\ndynamically within milliseconds, we propose an adaptive NRX architecture\ncapable of supporting dynamic modulation and coding scheme (MCS) configurations\nwithout the need for any re-training and without additional inference cost. We\noptimize the latency of the neural network (NN) architecture to achieve\ninference times of less than 1ms on an NVIDIA A100 GPU using the TensorRT\ninference library. These latency constraints effectively limit the size of the\nNN and we quantify the resulting signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) degradation as\nless than 0.7 dB when compared to a preliminary non-real-time NRX architecture.\nFinally, we explore the potential for site-specific adaptation of the receiver\nby investigating the required size of the training dataset and the number of\nfine-tuning iterations to optimize the NRX for specific radio environments\nusing a ray tracing-based channel model. The resulting NRX is ready for\ndeployment in a real-time 5G NR system and the source code including the\nTensorRT experiments is available online.",

As the network configuration in a practical setup can change\ndynamically within milliseconds, we propose an adaptive NRX architecture\ncapable of supporting dynamic modulation and coding scheme (MCS) configurations\nwithout the need for any re-training and without additional inference cost. We\noptimize the latency of the neural network (NN) architecture to achieve\ninference times of less than 1ms on an NVIDIA A100 GPU using the TensorRT\ninference library. These latency constraints effectively limit the size of the\nNN and we quantify the resulting signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) degradation as\nless than 0.7 dB when compared to a preliminary non-real-time NRX architecture.\nFinally, we explore the potential for site-specific adaptation of the receiver\nby investigating the required size of the training dataset and the number of\nfine-tuning iterations to optimize the NRX for specific radio environments\nusing a ray tracing-based channel model. The resulting NRX is ready for\ndeployment in a real-time 5G NR system and the source code including the\nTensorRT experiments is available online."

In this work, we show that a simple and\nscalable combination of learning rate (LR) re-warming, LR re-decaying, and\nreplay of previous data is sufficient to match the performance of fully\nre-training from scratch on all available data, as measured by the final loss\nand the average score on several language model (LM) evaluation benchmarks.\nSpecifically, we show this for a weak but realistic distribution shift between\ntwo commonly used LLM pre-training datasets (English$\\rightarrow$English) and a\nstronger distribution shift (English$\\rightarrow$German) at the $405$M\nparameter model scale with large dataset sizes (hundreds of billions of\ntokens). Selecting the weak but realistic shift for larger-scale experiments,\nwe also find that our continual learning strategies match the re-training\nbaseline for a 10B parameter LLM. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can be\nsuccessfully updated via simple and scalable continual learning strategies,\nmatching the re-training baseline using only a fraction of the compute.\nFinally, inspired by previous work, we propose alternatives to the cosine\nlearning rate schedule that help circumvent forgetting induced by LR re-warming\nand that are not bound to a fixed token budget.",

Recently, a few\nresearchers have released English multimodal math datasets (e.g., MATHVISTA and\nMATH-V) to evaluate the effectiveness of large multimodal models (LMMs). In\nthis paper, we release a Chinese multimodal math (CMM-Math) dataset, including\nbenchmark and training parts, to evaluate and enhance the mathematical\nreasoning of LMMs. CMM-Math contains over 28,000 high-quality samples,\nfeaturing a variety of problem types (e.g., multiple-choice, fill-in-the-blank,\nand so on) with detailed solutions across 12 grade levels from elementary to\nhigh school in China. Specifically, the visual context may be present in the\nquestions or opinions, which makes this dataset more challenging. Through\ncomprehensive analysis, we discover that state-of-the-art LMMs on the CMM-Math\ndataset face challenges, emphasizing the necessity for further improvements in\nLMM development.

To address this, we introduce\nLongRecipe, an efficient training strategy for extending the context window of\nLLMs, including impactful token analysis, position index transformation, and\ntraining optimization strategies. It simulates long-sequence inputs while\nmaintaining training efficiency and significantly improves the model's\nunderstanding of long-range dependencies. Experiments on three types of LLMs\nshow that LongRecipe can utilize long sequences while requiring only 30% of the\ntarget context window size, and reduces computational training resource over\n85% compared to full sequence training. Furthermore, LongRecipe also preserves\nthe original LLM's capabilities in general tasks. Ultimately, we can extend the\neffective context window of open-source LLMs from 8k to 128k, achieving\nperformance close to GPT-4 with just one day of dedicated training using a\nsingle GPU with 80G memory.

Can we apply the same techniques used in traditional design,\nlike the double diamond model, or do we need new methods for design\nengineering? How can we quickly design visualisations and craft new ideas with\ngenerative AI? This paper seeks to start this critical conversation and offers\npractical insights into the potential of AI in driving creativity in data\nvisualisation."

DiME employs foundation models as embedding kernels for\nefficient distribution matching, leveraging maximum mean discrepancy to\nfacilitate effective knowledge distillation. Simultaneously, NICKEL employs an\ninteractive compression method that enhances the communication between the\nstudent generator and discriminator, achieving a balanced and stable\ncompression process. Our comprehensive evaluation on the StyleGAN2 architecture\nwith the FFHQ dataset shows the effectiveness of our approach, with NICKEL &\nDiME achieving FID scores of 10.45 and 15.93 at compression rates of 95.73% and\n98.92%, respectively. Remarkably, our methods sustain generative quality even\nat an extreme compression rate of 99.69%, surpassing the previous\nstate-of-the-art performance by a large margin. These findings not only\ndemonstrate our methodologies' capacity to significantly lower GANs'\ncomputational demands but also pave the way for deploying high-quality GAN\nmodels in settings with limited resources.

We train the\nencoder in a contrastive setup to learn context-aware sentence representations.\nOur method considerably outperforms prior works on prompt compression on\nbenchmark datasets and is up to 10.93x faster at inference compared to the best\ntoken-level compression method. We also find better improvement for shorter\nlength constraints in most benchmarks, showing the effectiveness of our\nproposed solution in the compression of relevant information in a shorter\ncontext. Finally, we release the code and the dataset for quick reproducibility\nand further development: https://github.com/Workday/cpc."

Using a\nseries of controlled experiments, we tested various LLMs, including GPT-3.5\nTurbo, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Mistral, Math$\\Sigma$tral, and Llama 3.1, on tasks\ndesigned to measure their propensity for additive versus subtractive\nmodifications. Our findings demonstrate a significant preference for additive\nchanges across all tested models. For example, in a palindrome creation task,\nLlama 3.1 favored adding letters 97.85% of the time over removing them.\nSimilarly, in a Lego tower balancing task, GPT-3.5 Turbo chose to add a brick\n76.38% of the time rather than remove one. In a text summarization task,\nMistral 7B produced longer summaries in 59.40% to 75.10% of cases when asked to\nimprove its own or others' writing. These results indicate that, similar to\nhumans, LLMs exhibit a marked additive bias, which might have implications when\nLLMs are used on a large scale. Addittive bias might increase resource use and\nenvironmental impact, leading to higher economic costs due to overconsumption\nand waste. This bias should be considered in the development and application of\nLLMs to ensure balanced and efficient problem-solving approaches.",

The\ncentral aim is to generate the missing reasoning link between a message and the\nimplied meanings encoding the misogyny. Our study uses argumentation theory as\na foundation to form a collection of prompts in both zero-shot and few-shot\nsettings. These prompts integrate different techniques, including\nchain-of-thought reasoning and augmented knowledge. Our findings show that LLMs\nfall short on reasoning capabilities about misogynistic comments and that they\nmostly rely on their implicit knowledge derived from internalized common\nstereotypes about women to generate implied assumptions, rather than on\ninductive reasoning."

However, only 19.44 percent of GPT-4's replicated confidence\nintervals contain the original effect sizes, with the majority of replicated\neffect sizes exceeding the 95 percent confidence interval of the original\nstudies. Additionally, there is a 71.6 percent rate of unexpected significant\nresults where the original studies reported null findings, suggesting potential\noverestimation or false positives. Our results demonstrate the potential of\nLLMs as powerful tools in psychological research but also emphasize the need\nfor caution in interpreting AI-driven findings.

We find that GPT-4 successfully replicates 76.0\npercent of main effects and 47.0 percent of interaction effects observed in the\noriginal studies, closely mirroring human responses in both direction and\nsignificance. However, only 19.44 percent of GPT-4's replicated confidence\nintervals contain the original effect sizes, with the majority of replicated\neffect sizes exceeding the 95 percent confidence interval of the original\nstudies. Additionally, there is a 71.6 percent rate of unexpected significant\nresults where the original studies reported null findings, suggesting potential\noverestimation or false positives. Our results demonstrate the potential of\nLLMs as powerful tools in psychological research but also emphasize the need\nfor caution in interpreting AI-driven findings. While LLMs can complement human\nstudies, they cannot yet fully replace the nuanced insights provided by human\nsubjects."

The AIWolfDial2024\naddresses these challenges by employing the Werewolf Game, an incomplete\ninformation game, to test the capabilities of LLMs in complex interactive\nenvironments. This paper introduces a LLM-based Werewolf Game AI, where each\nrole is supported by situation analysis to aid response generation.\nAdditionally, for the werewolf role, various persuasion strategies, including\nlogical appeal, credibility appeal, and emotional appeal, are employed to\neffectively persuade other players to align with its actions."

However, their application to\nprivacy compliance and technical privacy reviews remains under-explored,\nraising critical concerns about their ability to adhere to global privacy\nstandards and protect sensitive user data. This paper seeks to address this gap\nby providing a comprehensive case study evaluating LLMs' performance in\nprivacy-related tasks such as privacy information extraction (PIE), legal and\nregulatory key point detection (KPD), and question answering (QA) with respect\nto privacy policies and data protection regulations. We introduce a Privacy\nTechnical Review (PTR) framework, highlighting its role in mitigating privacy\nrisks during the software development life-cycle. Through an empirical\nassessment, we investigate the capacity of several prominent LLMs, including\nBERT, GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and custom models, in executing privacy compliance checks\nand technical privacy reviews. Our experiments benchmark the models across\nmultiple dimensions, focusing on their precision, recall, and F1-scores in\nextracting privacy-sensitive information and detecting key regulatory\ncompliance points. While LLMs show promise in automating privacy reviews and\nidentifying regulatory discrepancies, significant gaps persist in their ability\nto fully comply with evolving legal standards. We provide actionable\nrecommendations for enhancing LLMs' capabilities in privacy compliance,\nemphasizing the need for robust model improvements and better integration with\nlegal and regulatory requirements. This study underscores the growing\nimportance of developing privacy-aware LLMs that can both support businesses in\ncompliance efforts and safeguard user privacy rights.",

Although GA workflows are the primary means for automation,\naccording to our experience and observations, human intervention is necessary\nto correct defects, update dependencies, or refactor existing workflow files.\nIn fact, previous research has shown that software artifacts similar to\nworkflows, such as build files and bots, can introduce additional maintenance\ntasks in software projects.
