To achieve this, layers define an explicit\nrepresentation of their state over time (e.g., a Transformer KV cache, a\nconvolution buffer, an RNN hidden state), and a step method that evolves that\nstate, tested to give identical results to a stateless layer-wise invocation.\nThis and other aspects of the SequenceLayers contract enables complex models to\nbe immediately streamable, mitigates a wide range of common bugs arising in\nboth streaming and parallel sequence processing, and can be implemented in any\ndeep learning library. A composable and declarative API, along with a\ncomprehensive suite of layers and combinators, streamlines the construction of\nproduction-scale models from simple streamable components while preserving\nstrong correctness guarantees.

                    "value": "We introduce a neural network layer API and library for sequence modeling,\ndesigned for easy creation of sequence models that can be executed both\nlayer-by-layer (e.g., teacher-forced training) and step-by-step (e.g.,\nautoregressive sampling). To achieve this, layers define an explicit\nrepresentation of their state over time (e.g., a Transformer KV cache, a\nconvolution buffer, an RNN hidden state), and a step method that evolves that\nstate, tested to give identical results to a stateless layer-wise invocation.\nThis and other aspects of the SequenceLayers contract enables complex models to\nbe immediately streamable, mitigates a wide range of common bugs arising in\nboth streaming and parallel sequence processing, and can be implemented in any\ndeep learning library. A composable and declarative API, along with a\ncomprehensive suite of layers and combinators, streamlines the construction of\nproduction-scale models from simple streamable components while preserving\nstrong correctness guarantees. Our current implementations of SequenceLayers\n(JAX, TensorFlow 2) are available at https://github.com/google/sequence-layers."

However, the limited storage capacity of edge servers poses\nsignificant challenges in handling high volume and latency sensitive data\naccess requests, particularly under dynamic workloads. In this work, we propose\na profit driven framework that integrates three key mechanisms which are\ncollaborative caching, erasure coding, and elastic storage partitioning. Unlike\ntraditional replication, erasure coding enables space efficient redundancy,\nallowing data to be reconstructed from any subset of K out of K plus M coded\nblocks. We dynamically partition each edge server s storage into private and\npublic regions. The private region is further subdivided among access points\nbased on their incoming request rates, enabling adaptive control over data\nlocality and ownership. We design a data placement and replacement policy that\ndetermines how and where to store or evict coded data blocks to maximize data\naccess within deadlines. While the private region serves requests from local\nAPs, the public region handles cooperative storage requests from neighboring\nservers. Our proposed Dynamic Space Partitioning and Elastic caching strategy\nis evaluated on both synthetic and real world traces from Netflix and Spotify.\nExperimental results show that our method improves overall system profitability\nby approximately 5 to 8% compared to state of the art approaches under varied\nworkload conditions.",

                    "value": "Edge Storage Systems have emerged as a critical enabler of low latency data\naccess in modern cloud networks by bringing storage and computation closer to\nend users. However, the limited storage capacity of edge servers poses\nsignificant challenges in handling high volume and latency sensitive data\naccess requests, particularly under dynamic workloads. In this work, we propose\na profit driven framework that integrates three key mechanisms which are\ncollaborative caching, erasure coding, and elastic storage partitioning. Unlike\ntraditional replication, erasure coding enables space efficient redundancy,\nallowing data to be reconstructed from any subset of K out of K plus M coded\nblocks. We dynamically partition each edge server s storage into private and\npublic regions. The private region is further subdivided among access points\nbased on their incoming request rates, enabling adaptive control over data\nlocality and ownership. We design a data placement and replacement policy that\ndetermines how and where to store or evict coded data blocks to maximize data\naccess within deadlines. While the private region serves requests from local\nAPs, the public region handles cooperative storage requests from neighboring\nservers. Our proposed Dynamic Space Partitioning and Elastic caching strategy\nis evaluated on both synthetic and real world traces from Netflix and Spotify.\nExperimental results show that our method improves overall system profitability\nby approximately 5 to 8% compared to state of the art approaches under varied\nworkload conditions."

We challenge this paradigm with SmallThinker, a family of LLMs\nnatively designed - not adapted - for the unique constraints of local devices:\nweak computational power, limited memory, and slow storage. Unlike traditional\napproaches that mainly compress existing models built for clouds, we architect\nSmallThinker from the ground up to thrive within these limitations. Our\ninnovation lies in a deployment-aware architecture that transforms constraints\ninto design principles. First, We introduce a two-level sparse structure\ncombining fine-grained Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with sparse feed-forward\nnetworks, drastically reducing computational demands without sacrificing model\ncapacity. Second, to conquer the I/O bottleneck of slow storage, we design a\npre-attention router that enables our co-designed inference engine to prefetch\nexpert parameters from storage while computing attention, effectively hiding\nstorage latency that would otherwise cripple on-device inference. Third, for\nmemory efficiency, we utilize NoPE-RoPE hybrid sparse attention mechanism to\nslash KV cache requirements. We release SmallThinker-4B-A0.6B and\nSmallThinker-21B-A3B, which achieve state-of-the-art performance scores and\neven outperform larger LLMs. Remarkably, our co-designed system mostly\neliminates the need for expensive GPU hardware: with Q4_0 quantization, both\nmodels exceed 20 tokens/s on ordinary consumer CPUs, while consuming only 1GB\nand 8GB of memory respectively.

However, traditional skiplists suffer from poor\ncache locality, as they store only a single element per node, leaving\nperformance on the table. Minimizing last-level cache misses is key to\nmaximizing in-memory index performance, making high cache locality essential.\nIn this paper, we present a practical concurrent B-skiplist that enhances cache\nlocality and performance while preserving the simplicity of traditional\nskiplist structures and concurrency control schemes. Our key contributions\ninclude a top-down, single-pass insertion algorithm for B-skiplists and a\ncorresponding simple and efficient top-down concurrency control scheme. On 128\nthreads, the proposed concurrent B-skiplist achieves between 2x-9x higher\nthroughput compared to state-of-the-art concurrent skiplist implementations,\nincluding Facebook's concurrent skiplist from Folly and the Java\nConcurrentSkipListMap. Furthermore, we find that the B-skiplist achieves\ncompetitive (0.9x-1.7x) throughput on point workloads compared to\nstate-of-the-art cache-optimized tree-based indices (e.g., Masstree). For a\nmore complete picture of the performance, we also measure the latency of\nskiplist and tree-based indices and find that the B-skiplist achieves between\n3.5x-103x lower 99% latency compared to other concurrent skiplists and between\n0.85x-64x lower 99% latency compared to tree-based indices on point workloads\nwith inserts.",

                "summary": "Recent advances in diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities\nin video generation. However, the computational intensity remains a significant\nchallenge for practical applications. While feature caching has been proposed\nto reduce the computational burden of diffusion models, existing methods\ntypically overlook the heterogeneous significance of individual blocks,\nresulting in suboptimal reuse and degraded output quality. To this end, we\naddress this gap by introducing ProfilingDiT, a novel adaptive caching strategy\nthat explicitly disentangles foreground and background-focused blocks. Through\na systematic analysis of attention distributions in diffusion models, we reveal\na key observation: 1) Most layers exhibit a consistent preference for either\nforeground or background regions. 2) Predicted noise shows low inter-step\nsimilarity initially, which stabilizes as denoising progresses.

                    "value": "Recent advances in diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities\nin video generation. However, the computational intensity remains a significant\nchallenge for practical applications. While feature caching has been proposed\nto reduce the computational burden of diffusion models, existing methods\ntypically overlook the heterogeneous significance of individual blocks,\nresulting in suboptimal reuse and degraded output quality. To this end, we\naddress this gap by introducing ProfilingDiT, a novel adaptive caching strategy\nthat explicitly disentangles foreground and background-focused blocks. Through\na systematic analysis of attention distributions in diffusion models, we reveal\na key observation: 1) Most layers exhibit a consistent preference for either\nforeground or background regions. 2) Predicted noise shows low inter-step\nsimilarity initially, which stabilizes as denoising progresses.

Step-3 innovates in two key dimensions: (1) A novel\nMulti-Matrix Factorization Attention (MFA) mechanism that significantly reduces\nboth KV cache size and computation while maintaining high attention\nexpressiveness, and (2) Attention-FFN Disaggregation (AFD), a distributed\ninference system that decouples attention and Feed-Forward Network (FFN) layers\ninto specialized subsystems. This co-design achieves unprecedented cost\nefficiency: Step-3 significantly reduces theoretical decoding costs compared\nwith models like DeepSeek-V3 and Qwen3 MoE 235B, with the gains widening at\nlonger context. Step-3 achieves low cost while activating 38B parameters per\ntoken (more than DeepSeek-V3 and Qwen3 MoE 235B), demonstrating that\nhardware-aligned attention arithmetic intensity, MoE sparsity, and AFD are\ncritical to cost-effectiveness. We perform a head-to-head comparison with\nDeepSeek-V3 in its favorable scenarios.

In this report, we present a preview version of\n\\method, which creates a dynamic world from an input image and allows\nexploration of the world using keyboard actions. To achieve this high-fidelity\nand interactive video world generation, we introduce a well-designed framework,\nwhich consists of four main components, including camera motion quantization,\nvideo generation architecture, advanced sampler, and model acceleration. First,\nwe quantize camera motions for stable training and user-friendly interaction\nusing keyboard inputs. Then, we introduce the Masked Video Diffusion\nTransformer~(MVDT) with a memory module for infinite video generation in an\nautoregressive manner. After that, training-free Anti-Artifact Mechanism (AAM)\nand Time Travel Sampling based on Stochastic Differential Equations (TTS-SDE)\nare introduced to the sampler for better visual quality and more precise\ncontrol. Moreover, we investigate model acceleration by synergistic\noptimization of adversarial distillation and caching mechanisms. We use the\nhigh-quality world exploration dataset \\sekai to train \\method, and it achieves\nremarkable results in diverse scenes and applications. All data, codebase, and\nmodel weights are available on https://github.com/stdstu12/YUME. Yume will\nupdate monthly to achieve its original goal.

To achieve this high-fidelity\nand interactive video world generation, we introduce a well-designed framework,\nwhich consists of four main components, including camera motion quantization,\nvideo generation architecture, advanced sampler, and model acceleration. First,\nwe quantize camera motions for stable training and user-friendly interaction\nusing keyboard inputs. Then, we introduce the Masked Video Diffusion\nTransformer~(MVDT) with a memory module for infinite video generation in an\nautoregressive manner. After that, training-free Anti-Artifact Mechanism (AAM)\nand Time Travel Sampling based on Stochastic Differential Equations (TTS-SDE)\nare introduced to the sampler for better visual quality and more precise\ncontrol. Moreover, we investigate model acceleration by synergistic\noptimization of adversarial distillation and caching mechanisms. We use the\nhigh-quality world exploration dataset \\sekai to train \\method, and it achieves\nremarkable results in diverse scenes and applications. All data, codebase, and\nmodel weights are available on https://github.com/stdstu12/YUME. Yume will\nupdate monthly to achieve its original goal.

However,\ndirectly adopting standard CXL primitives leads to performance degradation due\nto the high cost of maintaining cross-node cache coherence. To address the CXL\nchallenges, this paper introduces CtXnL, a software-hardware co-designed system\nthat implements a novel hybrid coherence primitive tailored to the loosely\ncoherent nature of transactional data. The core innovation of CtXnL is\nempowering transaction system developers with the ability to selectively\nachieve data coherence. Our evaluations on OLTP workloads demonstrate that\nCtXnL enhances performance, outperforming current network-based systems and\nachieves with up to 2.08x greater throughput than vanilla CXL memory sharing\narchitectures across universal transaction processing policies.",

                    "value": "Transaction processing systems are the crux for modern data-center\napplications, yet current multi-node systems are slow due to network overheads.\nThis paper advocates for Compute Express Link (CXL) as a network alternative,\nwhich enables low-latency and cache-coherent shared memory accesses. However,\ndirectly adopting standard CXL primitives leads to performance degradation due\nto the high cost of maintaining cross-node cache coherence. To address the CXL\nchallenges, this paper introduces CtXnL, a software-hardware co-designed system\nthat implements a novel hybrid coherence primitive tailored to the loosely\ncoherent nature of transactional data. The core innovation of CtXnL is\nempowering transaction system developers with the ability to selectively\nachieve data coherence. Our evaluations on OLTP workloads demonstrate that\nCtXnL enhances performance, outperforming current network-based systems and\nachieves with up to 2.08x greater throughput than vanilla CXL memory sharing\narchitectures across universal transaction processing policies."

As a result, serverless is becoming\nincreasingly popular to support highly elastic and bursty workloads. However,\nexisting platforms are supported by bloated virtualization stacks, which,\ncombined with bursty and irregular invocations, lead to high memory and latency\noverheads.\n  To reduce the virtualization stack bloat, we propose Hydra, a virtualized\nmulti-language runtime and platform capable of hosting multiple sandboxes\nrunning concurrently. To fully leverage Hydra's virtualized runtime, we revisit\nthe existing serverless platform design to make it colocation-aware across\nowners and functions, and to feature a caching layer of pre-allocated Hydra\ninstances that can be used by different functions written in different\nlanguages to reduce cold starts. We also propose a snapshotting mechanism to\ncheckpoint and restore individual sandboxes.\n  By consolidating multiple serverless function invocations through Hydra, we\nimprove the overall function density (ops/GB-sec) by 2.41x on average compared\nto OpenWhisk runtimes, the state-of-the-art single-language runtimes used in\nmost serverless platforms, and by 1.43x on average compared to Knative runtimes\nsupporting invocation colocation within the same function. When reproducing the\nAzure Functions trace, our serverless platform operating Hydra instances\nreduces the overall memory footprint by 21.3-43.9% compared to operating\nOpenWhisk instances and by 14.5-30% compared to operating Knative instances.\nHydra eliminates cold starts thanks to the pool of pre-warmed runtime\ninstances, reducing p99 latency by 45.3-375.5x compared to OpenWhisk and by\n1.9-51.4x compared to Knative.",

Lizard addresses these limitations by introducing a subquadratic\nattention mechanism that closely approximates softmax attention while\npreserving the output quality. Unlike previous linearization methods, which are\noften limited by fixed model structures and therefore exclude gating\nmechanisms, Lizard incorporates a gating module inspired by recent\nstate-of-the-art linear models. This enables adaptive memory control, supports\nconstant-memory inference, offers strong length generalization, and allows more\nflexible model design. Lizard combines gated linear attention for global\ncontext compression with sliding window attention enhanced by meta memory,\nforming a hybrid mechanism that captures both long-range dependencies and\nfine-grained local interactions. Moreover, we introduce a hardware-aware\nalgorithm that accelerates the training speed of our models. Extensive\nexperiments show that Lizard achieves near-lossless recovery of the teacher\nmodel's performance across standard language modeling tasks, while\nsignificantly outperforming previous linearization methods. On the 5-shot MMLU\nbenchmark, Lizard improves over prior models by 18 points and shows significant\nimprovements on associative recall tasks.",

In this paper, we investigate a\nnew strategy to eliminate such inefficiency, where the KV cache of each\ndocument is precomputed independently. During inference, the KV caches of\nretrieved documents are concatenated, allowing the model to reuse cached\nrepresentations instead of recomputing them. To mitigate the performance\ndegradation when using KV caches computed independently for each document,\nKVLink introduces two key techniques: adjusting positional embeddings of the KV\ncache at inference to match the global position after concatenation, and using\ntrainable special tokens to restore self-attention across independently encoded\ndocuments. Experiments across 7 datasets demonstrate that KVLink improves\nquestion answering accuracy by an average of 4% over state-of-the-art methods.\nFurthermore, by leveraging precomputed KV caches, our approach reduces\ntime-to-first-token by up to 96% compared to standard LLM inference, making it\na scalable and efficient solution for context reuse.

A significant\ndevelopment is the diversification of custom hardware solely targeting the most\nexpensive parts of CNNs. DLAs (deep learning accelerators) and NPUs (neural\nprocessing units), among others, can overcome the approaching limits of\ntraditional silicon scaling and provide a solution to the power/performance\ntradeoff within embedded SoCs.

There is a critical need for proper system\nintegration and an efficient compilation/execution model for balanced execution\nin these heterogeneous architectures. This work highlights the hardware\nintegration challenges for efficiently placing these units within the memory\nhierarchy and correct proximity to other execution blocks.

It is a challenging\nproblem since (1) Progressive error accumulation from cached blocks\nsignificantly degrades generation quality, particularly when over 50\\% of\nblocks are cached; (2) Current error compensation approaches neglect dynamic\nperturbation patterns during the caching process, leading to suboptimal error\ncorrection. To solve these problems, we propose the Gradient-Optimized Cache\n(GOC) with two key innovations: (1) Cached Gradient Propagation: A gradient\nqueue dynamically computes the gradient differences between cached and\nrecomputed features. These gradients are weighted and propagated to subsequent\nsteps, directly compensating for the approximation errors introduced by\ncaching. (2) Inflection-Aware Optimization: Through statistical analysis of\nfeature variation patterns, we identify critical inflection points where the\ndenoising trajectory changes direction. By aligning gradient updates with these\ndetected phases, we prevent conflicting gradient directions during error\ncorrection. Extensive evaluations on ImageNet demonstrate GOC's superior\ntrade-off between efficiency and quality. With 50\\% cached blocks, GOC achieves\nIS 216.28 (26.3\\% higher) and FID 3.907 (43\\% lower) compared to baseline DiT,\nwhile maintaining identical computational costs. These improvements persist\nacross various cache ratios, demonstrating robust adaptability to different\nacceleration requirements.

We introduce algorithmic optimizations based on SIMD and\nmatrix units to address strided memory accesses, alignment conflicts, and\nredundant accesses. We propose memory optimizations to boost on-package memory\nefficiency, and a novel multi-thread parallelism paradigm to overcome\ndata-sharing challenges caused by the absence of shared data caches. MMStencil\nsustains consistently high hardware utilization across diverse stencil shapes\nand dimensions. Our DMA-based inter-NUMA communication further mitigates NUMA\neffects and MPI limitations in hybrid parallelism. Combining all the\ninnovations, MMStencil outperforms state-of-the-art libraries on Nvidia A100\nGPGPU by up to 2.1x. Moreover, the performance improvements translate directly\nto real-world HPC applications and enable RTM applications to yield 1.8x\nspeedup versus a highly optimized industrial Nvidia A100 GPGPU version.",

We introduce algorithmic optimizations based on SIMD and\nmatrix units to address strided memory accesses, alignment conflicts, and\nredundant accesses. We propose memory optimizations to boost on-package memory\nefficiency, and a novel multi-thread parallelism paradigm to overcome\ndata-sharing challenges caused by the absence of shared data caches. MMStencil\nsustains consistently high hardware utilization across diverse stencil shapes\nand dimensions. Our DMA-based inter-NUMA communication further mitigates NUMA\neffects and MPI limitations in hybrid parallelism. Combining all the\ninnovations, MMStencil outperforms state-of-the-art libraries on Nvidia A100\nGPGPU by up to 2.1x. Moreover, the performance improvements translate directly\nto real-world HPC applications and enable RTM applications to yield 1.8x\nspeedup versus a highly optimized industrial Nvidia A100 GPGPU version."

In this paper, we\npropose a new KV cache optimization paradigm called LaCache, a training-free\nmethod for efficient and accurate generative inference of LLMs. LaCache enables\nLLMs to simultaneously address both of the critical challenges in long-range\nmodeling: robust long-range capabilities and continuous generation without\nrunning out-of-memory (OOM). Specifically, LaCache integrates two key\ninnovations: (1) a ladder-shaped KV cache pattern that stores KV pairs not only\nsequentially (left-to-right within each layer) but also across layers (from\nshallow to deep), providing an extended span for capturing long-range\ndependencies under a fixed storage budget, thereby boosting long-range\ncapabilities; and (2) an iterative compaction mechanism that progressively\ncompresses older caches, freeing up space for new tokens within a fixed cache\nsize. This token distance-based dynamic compression enables more effective\ncontinuous generation under constrained cache budgets. Experiments across\nvarious tasks, benchmarks, and LLM models consistently validate LaCache's\neffectiveness in enhancing LLMs' long-range capabilities.

Current RPKI design heavily reuses legacy PKI components, such\nas X.509 EE-certificates, ASN.1 encoding, and XML-based repository protocols,\nwhich introduce excessive cryptographic validation, redundant metadata, and\ninefficiencies in both storage and processing. We show that these design\nchoices, although based on established standards, create significant\nperformance bottlenecks, increase the vulnerability surface, and hinder\nscalability for wide-scale Internet deployment.\n  In this paper, we perform the first systematic analysis of the root causes of\ncomplexity in RPKI's design and experimentally quantify their real-world\nimpact. We show that over 70\\% of validation time in RPKI relying parties is\nspent on certificate parsing and signature verification, much of it\nunnecessary. Building on this insight, we introduce the improved RPKI (iRPKI),\na backwards-compatible redesign that preserves all security guarantees while\nsubstantially reducing protocol overhead. iRPKI eliminates EE-certificates and\nROA signatures, merges revocation and integrity objects, replaces verbose\nencodings with Protobuf, and restructures repository metadata for more\nefficient access. We experimentally demonstrate that our implementation of\niRPKI in the Routinator validator achieves a 20x speed-up of processing time,\n18x improvement of bandwidth requirements and 8x reduction in cache memory\nfootprint, while also eliminating classes of vulnerabilities that have led to\nat least 10 vulnerabilities in RPKI software. iRPKI significantly increases the\nfeasibility of deploying RPKI at scale in the Internet, and especially in\nconstrained environments. Our design may be deployed incrementally without\nimpacting existing operations.",

                    "value": "Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) is a critical security mechanism\nfor BGP, but the complexity of its architecture is a growing concern as its\nadoption scales. Current RPKI design heavily reuses legacy PKI components, such\nas X.509 EE-certificates, ASN.1 encoding, and XML-based repository protocols,\nwhich introduce excessive cryptographic validation, redundant metadata, and\ninefficiencies in both storage and processing. We show that these design\nchoices, although based on established standards, create significant\nperformance bottlenecks, increase the vulnerability surface, and hinder\nscalability for wide-scale Internet deployment.\n  In this paper, we perform the first systematic analysis of the root causes of\ncomplexity in RPKI's design and experimentally quantify their real-world\nimpact. We show that over 70\\% of validation time in RPKI relying parties is\nspent on certificate parsing and signature verification, much of it\nunnecessary. Building on this insight, we introduce the improved RPKI (iRPKI),\na backwards-compatible redesign that preserves all security guarantees while\nsubstantially reducing protocol overhead. iRPKI eliminates EE-certificates and\nROA signatures, merges revocation and integrity objects, replaces verbose\nencodings with Protobuf, and restructures repository metadata for more\nefficient access. We experimentally demonstrate that our implementation of\niRPKI in the Routinator validator achieves a 20x speed-up of processing time,\n18x improvement of bandwidth requirements and 8x reduction in cache memory\nfootprint, while also eliminating classes of vulnerabilities that have led to\nat least 10 vulnerabilities in RPKI software. iRPKI significantly increases the\nfeasibility of deploying RPKI at scale in the Internet, and especially in\nconstrained environments. Our design may be deployed incrementally without\nimpacting existing operations."

Among\nvarious TTA approaches, cache-based methods show promise by preserving\nhistorical knowledge from low-entropy samples in a dynamic cache and fostering\nefficient adaptation. However, these methods face two critical reliability\nchallenges: (1) entropy often becomes unreliable under distribution shifts,\ncausing error accumulation in the cache and degradation in adaptation\nperformance; (2) the final predictions may be unreliable due to inflexible\ndecision boundaries that fail to accommodate large downstream shifts. To\naddress these challenges, we propose a Reliable Test-time Adaptation (ReTA)\nmethod that integrates two complementary strategies to enhance reliability from\ntwo perspectives. First, to mitigate the unreliability of entropy as a sample\nselection criterion for cache construction, we introduce Consistency-aware\nEntropy Reweighting (CER), which incorporates consistency constraints to weight\nentropy during cache updating. While conventional approaches rely solely on low\nentropy for cache prioritization and risk introducing noise, our method\nleverages predictive consistency to maintain a high-quality cache and\nfacilitate more robust adaptation. Second, we present Diversity-driven\nDistribution Calibration (DDC), which models class-wise text embeddings as\nmultivariate Gaussian distributions, enabling adaptive decision boundaries for\nmore accurate predictions across visually diverse content. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that ReTA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art\nmethods, particularly under challenging real-world distribution shifts.",

Among\nvarious TTA approaches, cache-based methods show promise by preserving\nhistorical knowledge from low-entropy samples in a dynamic cache and fostering\nefficient adaptation. However, these methods face two critical reliability\nchallenges: (1) entropy often becomes unreliable under distribution shifts,\ncausing error accumulation in the cache and degradation in adaptation\nperformance; (2) the final predictions may be unreliable due to inflexible\ndecision boundaries that fail to accommodate large downstream shifts. To\naddress these challenges, we propose a Reliable Test-time Adaptation (ReTA)\nmethod that integrates two complementary strategies to enhance reliability from\ntwo perspectives. First, to mitigate the unreliability of entropy as a sample\nselection criterion for cache construction, we introduce Consistency-aware\nEntropy Reweighting (CER), which incorporates consistency constraints to weight\nentropy during cache updating. While conventional approaches rely solely on low\nentropy for cache prioritization and risk introducing noise, our method\nleverages predictive consistency to maintain a high-quality cache and\nfacilitate more robust adaptation. Second, we present Diversity-driven\nDistribution Calibration (DDC), which models class-wise text embeddings as\nmultivariate Gaussian distributions, enabling adaptive decision boundaries for\nmore accurate predictions across visually diverse content. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that ReTA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art\nmethods, particularly under challenging real-world distribution shifts."

This optimization reduces cold-start time when booting\nand loading dependencies at runtime inside a function container. Previous\nresearch has extensively focused on reducing cold-start latency for specific\nfunctions. However, little attention has been given to skewed production\nworkloads. In such cases, cross-function optimization becomes essential.\nWithout cross-function optimization, a cloud provider is left with two equally\npoor options: (i) Either the cloud provider gives up optimization for each\nfunction in the long tail (which is slow); or (ii) the cloud provider applies\nfunction-specific optimizations (e.g., cache function images) to every function\nin the long tail (which violates the vendor's cache constraints). HotSwap\ndemonstrates cross-function optimization using a novel pre-warming strategy. In\nthis strategy, a pre-initialized live dependency image is migrated to the new\nfunction instance. At the same time, HotSwap respects the provider's cache\nconstraints, because a single pre-warmed dependency image in the cache can be\nshared among all serverless functions that require that image. HotSwap has been\ntested on seven representative functions from FunctionBench. In those tests,\nHotSwap accelerates dependency loading for those serverless functions with\nlarge dependency requirements by a factor ranging from 2.2 to 3.2.

However, its stability to noise has only been\nsystematically understood for Abelian TOs. In this work, we exploit the\nnon-deterministic fusion of non-Abelian anyons to inform active error\ncorrection and design decoders where the fusion products, instead of flag\nqubits, herald the noise. This intrinsic heralding enhances thresholds over\nthose of Abelian counterparts when noise is dominated by a single non-Abelian\nanyon type.

However, its stability to noise has only been\nsystematically understood for Abelian TOs. In this work, we exploit the\nnon-deterministic fusion of non-Abelian anyons to inform active error\ncorrection and design decoders where the fusion products, instead of flag\nqubits, herald the noise. This intrinsic heralding enhances thresholds over\nthose of Abelian counterparts when noise is dominated by a single non-Abelian\nanyon type.

We investigate the asymptotic\nproperties of the test and its finite-sample behavior for various data types,\nincluding distributional data and point cloud data.

Identifying this process in the fully hadronic decay\nchannel is particularly challenging due to overwhelming backgrounds from\n$t\\bar{t}, t\\bar{t}W, t\\bar{t}Z$, and triple-top production processes.

The proposed model\nintegrates Graph layers for particle-level features, a custom Multi Layer\nPerceptron(MLP) based global stream with a quantum circuit and cross-attention\nfusion to combine local and global representations. Physics-informed Loss\nfunction enforce jet multiplicity constraints, derived from event decay\ndynamics. Benchmarked against conventional methods, the GNN achieves a signal\nsignificance $(S/\\sqrt{S+B})$ of $0.174$ and ROC-AUC of 0.974, surpassing BDT's\nsignificance of $0.148$ and ROC of $0.913$, while Xgboost achieves a\nsignificance of $0.149$ and ROC of $0.920$. The classification models are\ntrained on Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, with events normalized using\ncross-section-based reweighting to reflect their expected contributions in a\ndataset corresponding to $350\\;$fb$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity.

Hence, the proposed method\nnot only provides an improved PA map but also produces an estimation of risk on\nthe output PA values.

These agents are\ninteractively guided by GPT-4o via conversational prompts, enabling intuitive\nand user-friendly interaction. We validate CFDagent by reproducing canonical\nsphere flows at Reynolds numbers of 100 and 300 using three distinct inputs: a\nsimple text prompt (i.e., \"sphere\"), an image-based input, and a standard\nsphere model. The computed drag and lift coefficients from meshes produced by\neach input approach closely match available data. The proposed system enables\nsynthesization of flow simulations and photorealistic visualizations for\ncomplex geometries. Through extensive tests on canonical and realistic\nscenarios, we demonstrate the robustness, versatility, and practical\napplicability of CFDagent.

This is due to strong (self-)occlusions, depth ambiguities,\nthe vast intra- and inter-class shape variance, and the lack of 3D ground truth\nfor natural images. Existing deep-network methods are trained on synthetic\ndatasets to predict 3D shapes, so they often struggle generalizing to\nreal-world images. Moreover, they lack an explicit feedback loop for refining\nnoisy estimates, and primarily focus on geometry without directly considering\npixel alignment. To tackle these limitations, we develop a novel\nrender-and-compare optimization framework, called SDFit. This has three key\ninnovations: First, it uses a learned category-specific and morphable\nsigned-distance-function (mSDF) model, and fits this to an image by iteratively\nrefining both 3D pose and shape. The mSDF robustifies inference by constraining\nthe search on the manifold of valid shapes, while allowing for arbitrary shape\ntopologies. Second, SDFit retrieves an initial 3D shape that likely matches the\nimage, by exploiting foundational models for efficient look-up into 3D shape\ndatabases. Third, SDFit initializes pose by establishing rich 2D-3D\ncorrespondences between the image and the mSDF through foundational features.\nWe evaluate SDFit on three image datasets, i.e., Pix3D, Pascal3D+, and COMIC.\nSDFit performs on par with SotA feed-forward networks for unoccluded images and\ncommon poses, but is uniquely robust to occlusions and uncommon poses.\nMoreover, it requires no retraining for unseen images. Thus, SDFit contributes\nnew insights for generalizing in the wild. Code is available at\nhttps://anticdimi.github.io/sdfit.",

The limited size of memory module hinders the\nacquisition of complete memories and impacts the memory recall performance in\npractice. Memory theories suggest that the person's relevant memory can be\nproactively activated through some effective cues. Inspired by this, we propose\na novel strategy-guided agent-assisted memory recall method, allowing the agent\nto transform an original query into a cue-rich one via the judiciously designed\nstrategy to help the person recall memories. To this end, there are two key\nchallenges. (1) How to choose the appropriate recall strategy for diverse\nforgetting scenarios with distinct memory-recall characteristics? (2) How to\nobtain the high-quality responses leveraging recall strategies, given only\nabstract and sparsely annotated strategy patterns? To address the challenges,\nwe propose a Recall Router framework. Specifically, we design a 5W Recall Map\nto classify memory queries into five typical scenarios and define fifteen\nrecall strategy patterns across the corresponding scenarios. We then propose a\nhierarchical recall tree combined with the Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm to\noptimize the selection of strategy and the generation of strategy responses. We\nconstruct an instruction tuning dataset and fine-tune multiple open-source\nlarge language models (LLMs) to develop MemoCue, an agent that excels in\nproviding memory-inspired responses.

This prompts an important question:\ncan robot models achieve better performance in multi-task , complex\nenvironments by reviewing prior observations and then providing task-specific\nreasoning to guide action prediction? In this paper, we introduce\nChain-of-Affordance (CoA-VLA) , a novel approach to scaling robot models by\nincorporating reasoning in the format of sequential robot affordances to\nfacilitate task completion. Specifically, we prompt the model to consider the\nfollowing four types of affordances before taking action: (1) object affordance\n- what object to manipulate and where it is ; (2) grasp affordance - the\nspecific object part to grasp ; (3) spatial affordance - the optimal space to\nplace the object ; and (4) movement affordance-the collision - free path for\nmovement. We further transform each affordance into two prompting formats:\nvisual affordance and textual affordance. We introduce a novel vision-language\nco-injection module that integrates this knowledge into the policy network.\nThis allows the robot to leverage essential contextual information during\naction inference, resulting in improved precision and robustness.

In this\npaper, we describe our experience in using Large Language Models towards\nautomating the code review process in Ericsson. We describe the development of\na lightweight tool using LLMs and static program analysis. We then describe our\npreliminary experiments with experienced developers in evaluating our code\nreview tool and the encouraging results."

We\nfind that the evaluated PEFT methods are only half as memory-efficient when\napplied to depthwise-separable convolution architectures, compared to their\nefficiency with LLMs. Conversely, when targeting convolu- tional architectures\noptimized for edge deployment, adapter-based PEFT methods can reduce floating\npoint operations (FLOPs) during model updates by up to 95%. These insights\noffer valuable guidance for selecting PEFT methods based on hardware\nconstraints, performance requirements, and application needs. Our code is\nonline."

First, existing methods depend on 3D training data collected\nfrom limited environments, constraining out-of-distribution generalization.

To address these challenges, we introduce Mocap-2-to-3, a novel\nframework that performs multi-view lifting from monocular input by leveraging\n2D data pre-training, enabling the reconstruction of metrically accurate 3D\nmotions with absolute positions. To leverage abundant 2D data, we decompose\ncomplex 3D motion into multi-view syntheses. We first pretrain a single-view\ndiffusion model on extensive 2D datasets, then fine-tune a multi-view model\nusing public 3D data to enable view-consistent motion generation from monocular\ninput, allowing the model to acquire action priors and diversity through 2D\ndata. Furthermore, to recover absolute poses, we propose a novel human motion\nrepresentation that decouples the learning of local pose and global movements,\nwhile encoding geometric priors of the ground to accelerate convergence. This\nenables progressive recovery of motion in absolute space during inference.\nExperimental results on in-the-wild benchmarks demonstrate that our method\nsurpasses state-of-the-art approaches in both camera-space motion realism and\nworld-grounded human positioning, while exhibiting superior generalization\ncapability.

However, how LLMs acquire this pragmatic competence throughout\nthe training process remains poorly understood. In this work, we introduce\nALTPRAG, a dataset grounded in the pragmatic concept of alternatives, to\nevaluate whether LLMs at different training stages can accurately infer nuanced\nspeaker intentions. Each instance pairs two equally plausible yet pragmatically\ndivergent continuations and requires the model to (i) infer the speaker's\nintended meaning and (ii) explain when and why a speaker would choose one\nutterance over its alternative, thus directly probing pragmatic competence\nthrough contrastive reasoning. We systematically evaluate 22 LLMs across 3 key\ntraining stages: after pre-training, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and\npreference optimization, to examine the development of pragmatic competence.\nOur results show that even base models exhibit notable sensitivity to pragmatic\ncues, which improves consistently with increases in model and data scale.\nAdditionally, SFT and RLHF contribute further gains, particularly in\ncognitive-pragmatic scenarios. These findings highlight pragmatic competence as\nan emergent and compositional property of LLM training and offer new insights\nfor aligning models with human communicative norms.",

However, how LLMs acquire this pragmatic competence throughout\nthe training process remains poorly understood. In this work, we introduce\nALTPRAG, a dataset grounded in the pragmatic concept of alternatives, to\nevaluate whether LLMs at different training stages can accurately infer nuanced\nspeaker intentions. Each instance pairs two equally plausible yet pragmatically\ndivergent continuations and requires the model to (i) infer the speaker's\nintended meaning and (ii) explain when and why a speaker would choose one\nutterance over its alternative, thus directly probing pragmatic competence\nthrough contrastive reasoning. We systematically evaluate 22 LLMs across 3 key\ntraining stages: after pre-training, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and\npreference optimization, to examine the development of pragmatic competence.\nOur results show that even base models exhibit notable sensitivity to pragmatic\ncues, which improves consistently with increases in model and data scale.\nAdditionally, SFT and RLHF contribute further gains, particularly in\ncognitive-pragmatic scenarios. These findings highlight pragmatic competence as\nan emergent and compositional property of LLM training and offer new insights\nfor aligning models with human communicative norms."

By capturing trajectory curvature via the estimated\nStein score, our approach enables accurate anomaly scoring with only five\ndiffusion steps. A single SBDDM pre-trained on a large, semantically aligned\nmedical dataset generalizes effectively across multiple Near-OOD and Far-OOD\nbenchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance while drastically reducing\ncomputational cost during inference.

Previous studies categorize jailbreaks\nas successful or failed based on whether responses contain malicious content.\nHowever, given the stochastic nature of MLLM responses, this binary\nclassification of an input's ability to jailbreak MLLMs is inappropriate.\nDerived from this viewpoint, we introduce jailbreak probability to quantify the\njailbreak potential of an input, which represents the likelihood that MLLMs\ngenerated a malicious response when prompted with this input. We approximate\nthis probability through multiple queries to MLLMs. After modeling the\nrelationship between input hidden states and their corresponding jailbreak\nprobability using Jailbreak Probability Prediction Network (JPPN), we use\ncontinuous jailbreak probability for optimization. Specifically, we propose\nJailbreak-Probability-based Attack (JPA) that optimizes adversarial\nperturbations on input image to maximize jailbreak probability, and further\nenhance it as Multimodal JPA (MJPA) by including monotonic text rephrasing. To\ncounteract attacks, we also propose Jailbreak-Probability-based Finetuning\n(JPF), which minimizes jailbreak probability through MLLM parameter updates.\nExtensive experiments show that (1) (M)JPA yields significant improvements when\nattacking a wide range of models under both white and black box settings.

While commercial, cloud-based AI\nchatbots have garnered significant attention in translation studies, concerns\nregarding data privacy, security, and equitable access necessitate exploration\nof alternative deployment models. This paper investigates the feasibility and\nperformance of locally deployable, free language models as a viable alternative\nto proprietary, cloud-based AI solutions. This study evaluates three\nopen-source models installed on CPU-based platforms and compared against\ncommercially available online chat-bots. The evaluation focuses on functional\nperformance rather than a comparative analysis of human-machine translation\nquality, an area already subject to extensive research.

While commercial, cloud-based AI\nchatbots have garnered significant attention in translation studies, concerns\nregarding data privacy, security, and equitable access necessitate exploration\nof alternative deployment models. This paper investigates the feasibility and\nperformance of locally deployable, free language models as a viable alternative\nto proprietary, cloud-based AI solutions. This study evaluates three\nopen-source models installed on CPU-based platforms and compared against\ncommercially available online chat-bots. The evaluation focuses on functional\nperformance rather than a comparative analysis of human-machine translation\nquality, an area already subject to extensive research.

In particular, we observe that a major\nsource of error in current multimodal reasoning lies in the perception of\nvisual inputs.

In this paper, we propose\nthe first approach which incorporates risk estimation into a pixel attribution\nmethod for improved image classification explainability. The proposed method\niteratively applies a classification model with a pixel attribution method to\ncreate a volume of PA maps. This volume is used for the first time, to generate\na pixel-wise distribution of PA values. We introduce a method to generate an\nenhanced PA map by estimating the expectation values of the pixel-wise\ndistributions. In addition, the coefficient of variation (CV) is used to\nestimate pixel-wise risk of this enhanced PA map. Hence, the proposed method\nnot only provides an improved PA map but also produces an estimation of risk on\nthe output PA values.

These agents are\ninteractively guided by GPT-4o via conversational prompts, enabling intuitive\nand user-friendly interaction. We validate CFDagent by reproducing canonical\nsphere flows at Reynolds numbers of 100 and 300 using three distinct inputs: a\nsimple text prompt (i.e., \"sphere\"), an image-based input, and a standard\nsphere model. The computed drag and lift coefficients from meshes produced by\neach input approach closely match available data. The proposed system enables\nsynthesization of flow simulations and photorealistic visualizations for\ncomplex geometries. Through extensive tests on canonical and realistic\nscenarios, we demonstrate the robustness, versatility, and practical\napplicability of CFDagent.

While these models demonstrate strong\ngenerative capabilities, their effectiveness in producing structured and\nexecutable plans remains uncertain. This paper presents a systematic evaluation\nof a broad spectrum of current state of the art language models, each directly\nprompted using Planning Domain Definition Language domain and problem files,\nand compares their planning performance with the Fast Downward planner across a\nvariety of benchmarks.

Previous studies categorize jailbreaks\nas successful or failed based on whether responses contain malicious content.\nHowever, given the stochastic nature of MLLM responses, this binary\nclassification of an input's ability to jailbreak MLLMs is inappropriate.\nDerived from this viewpoint, we introduce jailbreak probability to quantify the\njailbreak potential of an input, which represents the likelihood that MLLMs\ngenerated a malicious response when prompted with this input. We approximate\nthis probability through multiple queries to MLLMs. After modeling the\nrelationship between input hidden states and their corresponding jailbreak\nprobability using Jailbreak Probability Prediction Network (JPPN), we use\ncontinuous jailbreak probability for optimization.

With the rapid advancement\nof large language models (LLMs), substantial progress has been made in\naddressing real-world software engineering tasks. Recent studies have\nintroduced ensemble reasoning techniques to enhance the performance of\nLLM-based issue resolution. However, existing prompting-based methods still\nface limitations in effectively exploring large ensemble spaces and lack the\ncapacity for repository-level understanding, both of which constrain their\noverall effectiveness. In this paper, we propose Trae Agent, the first\nagent-based ensemble reasoning approach for repository-level issue resolution.\nTrae Agent formulates our goal as an optimal solution search problem and\naddresses two key challenges, i.e., large ensemble spaces and repository-level\nunderstanding, through modular agents for generation, pruning, and selection.\nWe conduct extensive experiments using three leading LLMs on the widely-adopted\nSWE-bench benchmark, comparing Trae Agent against four state-of-the-art\nensemble reasoning techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that Trae Agent\nconsistently achieves superior performance, with an average improvement of\n10.22% over all baselines in terms of Pass@1.

Although many\nfine-tuning techniques have been developed to reduce the time and computational\ncost involved, the challenge persists as LLMs continue to grow in size and\ncomplexity. To address this, a new approach to knowledge expansion in LLMs is\nneeded.

Current AV planning systems typically\nrely on rigid rules, which struggle to balance these competing considerations\nand can lead to behaviour that misaligns with human expectations. This paper\nproposes a novel reasons-based trajectory evaluation framework that\noperationalises the tracking condition of Meaningful Human Control (MHC). The\nframework models the reasons of human agents, such as regulatory compliance, as\nquantifiable functions and evaluates how well candidate AV trajectories align\nwith these reasons. By assigning adjustable weights to agent priorities and\nintegrating a balance function to discourage the exclusion of any agent, the\nframework supports interpretable decision evaluation. Through a\nreal-world-inspired overtaking scenario, we show how this approach reveals\ntensions, for instance between regulatory compliance, efficiency, and comfort.\nThe framework functions as a modular evaluation layer over existing planning\nalgorithms.

                    "value": "A key challenge in deploying automated vehicles (AVs) is ensuring they make\nappropriate decisions in ethically challenging everyday driving situations.\nWhile much attention has been paid to rare, high-stakes dilemmas such as\ntrolley problems, similar tensions also arise in routine scenarios, such as\nnavigating empty intersections, where multiple human considerations, including\nlegality and comfort, often conflict. Current AV planning systems typically\nrely on rigid rules, which struggle to balance these competing considerations\nand can lead to behaviour that misaligns with human expectations. This paper\nproposes a novel reasons-based trajectory evaluation framework that\noperationalises the tracking condition of Meaningful Human Control (MHC). The\nframework models the reasons of human agents, such as regulatory compliance, as\nquantifiable functions and evaluates how well candidate AV trajectories align\nwith these reasons. By assigning adjustable weights to agent priorities and\nintegrating a balance function to discourage the exclusion of any agent, the\nframework supports interpretable decision evaluation. Through a\nreal-world-inspired overtaking scenario, we show how this approach reveals\ntensions, for instance between regulatory compliance, efficiency, and comfort.\nThe framework functions as a modular evaluation layer over existing planning\nalgorithms. It offers a transparent tool for assessing ethical alignment in\neveryday scenarios and provides a practical step toward implementing MHC in\nreal-world AV deployment."

We propose a chain-of-thought reasoning strategy that\ncreates adaptive prompts to steer RAG systems away from sensitive content.\nSpecifically, we first decompose adversarial queries to maximize information\ndisparity and then apply a semantic relationship scoring to resolve lexical and\nsyntactic ambiguities. We finally train a neural network on these feature\nscores to precisely identify sentences containing private information. Unlike\nprior work, our framework generalizes to unseen domains through iterative\nrefinement without pre-defined knowledge. Experimental results show that we\nachieve over 91% privacy extraction rate in single-domain and 83% in\nmulti-domain scenarios, reducing sensitive sentence exposure by over 65% in\ncase studies.
