While coalescing strided\naccesses is a natural solution, effectively gathering or scattering elements at\nfixed strides remains challenging. Naive approaches rely on high-overhead\ncrossbars that remap any byte between memory and registers, leading to physical\ndesign issues. Segment operations require row-column transpositions, typically\nhandled using either element-level in-place transposition (degrading\nperformance) or large buffer-based bulk transposition (incurring high area\noverhead). In this paper, we present EARTH, a novel vector memory access\narchitecture designed to overcome these challenges through shifting-based\noptimizations. For strided accesses, EARTH integrates specialized shift\nnetworks for gathering and scattering elements. After coalescing multiple\naccesses within the same cache line, data is routed between memory and\nregisters through the shifting network with minimal overhead. For segment\noperations, EARTH employs a shifted register bank enabling direct column-wise\naccess, eliminating dedicated segment buffers while providing high-performance,\nin-place bulk transposition. Implemented on FPGA with Chisel HDL based on an\nopen-source RISC-V vector unit, EARTH enhances performance for strided memory\naccesses, achieving 4x-8x speedups in benchmarks dominated by strided\noperations. Compared to conventional designs, EARTH reduces hardware area by 9%\nand power consumption by 41%, significantly advancing both performance and\nefficiency of vector processors.",

After coalescing multiple\naccesses within the same cache line, data is routed between memory and\nregisters through the shifting network with minimal overhead. For segment\noperations, EARTH employs a shifted register bank enabling direct column-wise\naccess, eliminating dedicated segment buffers while providing high-performance,\nin-place bulk transposition. Implemented on FPGA with Chisel HDL based on an\nopen-source RISC-V vector unit, EARTH enhances performance for strided memory\naccesses, achieving 4x-8x speedups in benchmarks dominated by strided\noperations. Compared to conventional designs, EARTH reduces hardware area by 9%\nand power consumption by 41%, significantly advancing both performance and\nefficiency of vector processors."

                "summary": "Sparse general matrix-matrix multiplication (SpGEMM) is a critical operation\nin many applications. Current multithreaded implementations are based on\nGustavson's algorithm and often perform poorly on large matrices due to limited\ncache reuse by the accumulators. We present MAGNUS (Matrix Algebra for Gigantic\nNUmerical Systems), a novel algorithm to maximize data locality in SpGEMM. To\ngenerate locality, MAGNUS reorders the intermediate product into discrete\ncache-friendly chunks using a two-level hierarchical approach. The accumulator\nis applied to each chunk, where the chunk size is chosen such that the\naccumulator is cache-efficient. MAGNUS is input- and system-aware: based on the\nmatrix characteristics and target system specifications, the optimal number of\nchunks is computed by minimizing the storage cost of the necessary data\nstructures.

Current multithreaded implementations are based on\nGustavson's algorithm and often perform poorly on large matrices due to limited\ncache reuse by the accumulators. We present MAGNUS (Matrix Algebra for Gigantic\nNUmerical Systems), a novel algorithm to maximize data locality in SpGEMM. To\ngenerate locality, MAGNUS reorders the intermediate product into discrete\ncache-friendly chunks using a two-level hierarchical approach. The accumulator\nis applied to each chunk, where the chunk size is chosen such that the\naccumulator is cache-efficient. MAGNUS is input- and system-aware: based on the\nmatrix characteristics and target system specifications, the optimal number of\nchunks is computed by minimizing the storage cost of the necessary data\nstructures.

LLMs enable users to perform a wide range of natural language tasks,\nsuch as classification, entity extraction, and translation, over large\ndatasets. However, LLM inference is highly costly and slow: for example, an\nNVIDIA L4 GPU running Llama3-8B can only process 6 KB of text per second,\ntaking about a day to handle 15 GB of data; processing a similar amount of data\ncosts around $10K on OpenAI's GPT-4o. In this paper, we propose novel\ntechniques that can significantly reduce the cost of LLM calls for relational\ndata analytics workloads. Our key contribution is developing efficient\nalgorithms for reordering the rows and the fields within each row of an input\ntable to maximize key-value (KV) cache reuse when performing LLM serving. As\nsuch, our approach can be easily applied to existing analytics systems and\nserving platforms. Our evaluation shows that our solution can yield up to 3.4x\nimprovement in job completion time on a benchmark of diverse LLM-based queries\nusing Llama 3 models. Our solution also achieves a 32% cost savings under\nOpenAI and Anthropic pricing models.",

LLMs enable users to perform a wide range of natural language tasks,\nsuch as classification, entity extraction, and translation, over large\ndatasets. However, LLM inference is highly costly and slow: for example, an\nNVIDIA L4 GPU running Llama3-8B can only process 6 KB of text per second,\ntaking about a day to handle 15 GB of data; processing a similar amount of data\ncosts around $10K on OpenAI's GPT-4o. In this paper, we propose novel\ntechniques that can significantly reduce the cost of LLM calls for relational\ndata analytics workloads. Our key contribution is developing efficient\nalgorithms for reordering the rows and the fields within each row of an input\ntable to maximize key-value (KV) cache reuse when performing LLM serving. As\nsuch, our approach can be easily applied to existing analytics systems and\nserving platforms. Our evaluation shows that our solution can yield up to 3.4x\nimprovement in job completion time on a benchmark of diverse LLM-based queries\nusing Llama 3 models. Our solution also achieves a 32% cost savings under\nOpenAI and Anthropic pricing models."

To ensure real-time performance,\nfrequency-enhanced LIO systems must process each sweep within significantly\nreduced timeframe, which presents substantial challenges for deployment on\nlow-computational-power platforms. To address these limitations, we introduce\nSR-LIO++, an innovative LIO system capable of achieving doubled output\nfrequency relative to input frequency on resource-constrained hardware\nplatforms, including the Raspberry Pi 4B. Our system employs a sweep\nreconstruction methodology to enhance LiDAR sweep frequency, generating\nhigh-frequency reconstructed sweeps. Building upon this foundation, we propose\na caching mechanism for intermediate results (i.e., surface parameters) of the\nmost recent segments, effectively minimizing redundant processing of common\nsegments in adjacent reconstructed sweeps. This method decouples processing\ntime from the traditionally linear dependence on reconstructed sweep frequency.\nFurthermore, we present a quantized map point management based on index table\nmapping, significantly reducing memory usage by converting global 3D point\nstorage from 64-bit double precision to 8-bit char representation. This method\nalso converts the computationally intensive Euclidean distance calculations in\nnearest neighbor searches from 64-bit double precision to 16-bit short and\n32-bit integer formats, significantly reducing both memory and computational\ncost. Extensive experimental evaluations across three distinct computing\nplatforms and four public datasets demonstrate that SR-LIO++ maintains\nstate-of-the-art accuracy while substantially enhancing efficiency.

To this end, we propose ZSMerge, a dynamic KV cache\ncompression framework designed for efficient cache management, featuring three\nkey operations: (1) fine-grained memory allocation guided by multi-dimensional\ntoken importance metrics at head-level granularity, (2) a residual merging\nmechanism that preserves critical context through compensated attention\nscoring, and (3) a zero-shot adaptation mechanism compatible with diverse LLM\narchitectures without requiring retraining. ZSMerge significantly enhances\nmemory efficiency and inference speed with negligible performance degradation\nacross LLMs. When applied to LLaMA2-7B, it demonstrates a 20:1 compression\nratio for key-value cache retention (reducing memory footprint to 5\\% of\nbaseline) while sustaining comparable generation quality, coupled with triple\nthroughput gains at extreme 54k-token contexts that eliminate out-of-memory\nfailures.

                "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) often incorporate multiple text chunks in their\ninputs to provide the necessary contexts. To speed up the prefill of the long\nLLM inputs, one can pre-compute the KV cache of a text and re-use the KV cache\nwhen the context is reused as the prefix of another LLM input. However, the\nreused text chunks are not always the input prefix, which makes precomputed KV\ncaches not directly usable since they ignore the text's cross-attention with\nthe preceding texts. Thus, the benefits of reusing KV caches remain largely\nunrealized.\n  This paper tackles just one challenge: when an LLM input contains multiple\ntext chunks, how to quickly combine their precomputed KV caches in order to\nachieve the same generation quality as the expensive full prefill (i.e.,\nwithout reusing KV cache)? This challenge naturally arises in\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG) where the input is supplemented with\nmultiple retrieved texts as the context. We present CacheBlend, a scheme that\nreuses the precomputed KV caches, regardless prefix or not, and selectively\nrecomputes the KV values of a small subset of tokens to partially update each\nreused KV cache. In the meantime, the small extra delay for recomputing some\ntokens can be pipelined with the retrieval of KV caches within the same job,\nallowing CacheBlend to store KV caches in slower devices with more storage\ncapacity while retrieving them without increasing the inference delay. By\ncomparing CacheBlend with the state-of-the-art KV cache reusing schemes on\nthree open-source LLMs of various sizes and four popular benchmark datasets of\ndifferent tasks, we show that CacheBlend reduces time-to-first-token (TTFT) by\n2.2-3.3x and increases the inference throughput by 2.8-5x from full KV\nrecompute without compromising generation quality.

On Phi-3-Medium, DIP\nachieves a 46\\% reduction in memory and 40\\% increase in throughput with $<$\n0.1 loss in perplexity when compared to streaming the dense model from Flash.\nThe open source code for HW simulator, methods, and experiments in this paper\nis available at https://github.com/Qualcomm-AI-research/dynamic-sparsity ."

This heterogeneity and the intricate dependencies\narising in covariate-informed forecasting present significant challenges to\nexisting deep models. To address these issues, we propose CITRAS, a patch-based\nTransformer that flexibly leverages multiple targets and covariates covering\nboth the past and the future forecasting horizon. While preserving the strong\nautoregressive capabilities of the canonical Transformer, CITRAS introduces two\nnovel mechanisms in patch-wise cross-variate attention: Key-Value (KV) Shift\nand Attention Score Smoothing. KV Shift seamlessly incorporates future known\ncovariates into the forecasting of target variables based on their concurrent\ndependencies. Additionally, Attention Score Smoothing transforms locally\naccurate patch-wise cross-variate dependencies into global variate-level\ndependencies by smoothing the past series of attention scores.

However, processing a large number of visual\ntokens and generating long-context outputs impose substantial computational\noverhead, leading to excessive demands for key-value (KV) cache. To address\nthis critical bottleneck, we propose AirCache, a novel KV cache compression\nmethod aimed at accelerating LVLMs inference. This work systematically\ninvestigates the correlations between visual and textual tokens within the\nattention mechanisms of LVLMs. Our empirical analysis reveals considerable\nredundancy in cached visual tokens, wherein strategically eliminating these\ntokens preserves model performance while significantly accelerating context\ngeneration. Inspired by these findings, we introduce an elite observation\nwindow for assessing the importance of visual components in the KV cache,\nfocusing on stable inter-modal relevancy modeling with enhanced\nmulti-perspective consistency. Additionally, we develop an adaptive layer-wise\nbudget allocation strategy that capitalizes on the strength and skewness of\ntoken importance distribution, showcasing superior efficiency compared to\nuniform allocation. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple LVLMs and\nbenchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves comparable performance to the\nfull cache while retaining only 10% of visual KV cache, thereby reducing\ndecoding latency by 29% to 66% across various batch size and prompt length of\ninputs. Notably, as cache retention rates decrease, our method exhibits\nincreasing performance advantages over existing approaches.",

                "summary": "Text-guided image editing is an essential task that enables users to modify\nimages through natural language descriptions. Recent advances in diffusion\nmodels and rectified flows have significantly improved editing quality,\nprimarily relying on inversion techniques to extract structured noise from\ninput images. However, inaccuracies in inversion can propagate errors, leading\nto unintended modifications and compromising fidelity. Moreover, even with\nperfect inversion, the entanglement between textual prompts and image features\noften results in global changes when only local edits are intended. To address\nthese challenges, we propose a novel text-guided image editing framework based\non VAR (Visual AutoRegressive modeling), which eliminates the need for explicit\ninversion while ensuring precise and controlled modifications. Our method\nintroduces a caching mechanism that stores token indices and probability\ndistributions from the original image, capturing the relationship between the\nsource prompt and the image. Using this cache, we design an adaptive\nfine-grained masking strategy that dynamically identifies and constrains\nmodifications to relevant regions, preventing unintended changes. A token\nreassembling approach further refines the editing process, enhancing diversity,\nfidelity, and control. Our framework operates in a training-free manner and\nachieves high-fidelity editing with faster inference speeds, processing a 1K\nresolution image in as fast as 1.2 seconds. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat our method achieves performance comparable to, or even surpassing,\nexisting diffusion- and rectified flow-based approaches in both quantitative\nmetrics and visual quality.

While cache-based methods show promise by\nleveraging historical information, they struggle with both caching unreliable\nfeature-label pairs and indiscriminately using single-class information during\nquerying, significantly compromising adaptation accuracy. To address these\nlimitations, we propose COSMIC (Clique-Oriented Semantic Multi-space\nIntegration for CLIP), a robust test-time adaptation framework that enhances\nadaptability through multi-granular, cross-modal semantic caching and\ngraph-based querying mechanisms. Our framework introduces two key innovations:\nDual Semantics Graph (DSG) and Clique Guided Hyper-class (CGH). The Dual\nSemantics Graph constructs complementary semantic spaces by incorporating\ntextual features, coarse-grained CLIP features, and fine-grained DINOv2\nfeatures to capture rich semantic relationships. Building upon these dual\ngraphs, the Clique Guided Hyper-class component leverages structured class\nrelationships to enhance prediction robustness through correlated class\nselection. Extensive experiments demonstrate COSMIC's superior performance\nacross multiple benchmarks, achieving significant improvements over\nstate-of-the-art methods: 15.81% gain on out-of-distribution tasks and 5.33% on\ncross-domain generation with CLIP RN-50.

While cache-based methods show promise by\nleveraging historical information, they struggle with both caching unreliable\nfeature-label pairs and indiscriminately using single-class information during\nquerying, significantly compromising adaptation accuracy. To address these\nlimitations, we propose COSMIC (Clique-Oriented Semantic Multi-space\nIntegration for CLIP), a robust test-time adaptation framework that enhances\nadaptability through multi-granular, cross-modal semantic caching and\ngraph-based querying mechanisms. Our framework introduces two key innovations:\nDual Semantics Graph (DSG) and Clique Guided Hyper-class (CGH). The Dual\nSemantics Graph constructs complementary semantic spaces by incorporating\ntextual features, coarse-grained CLIP features, and fine-grained DINOv2\nfeatures to capture rich semantic relationships. Building upon these dual\ngraphs, the Clique Guided Hyper-class component leverages structured class\nrelationships to enhance prediction robustness through correlated class\nselection. Extensive experiments demonstrate COSMIC's superior performance\nacross multiple benchmarks, achieving significant improvements over\nstate-of-the-art methods: 15.81% gain on out-of-distribution tasks and 5.33% on\ncross-domain generation with CLIP RN-50.

In such an\nalgorithm, elements that change frame-to-frame are marked dirty; only the dirty\nelements need be processed to draw the next frame, dramatically reducing\nlatency. However, the standard incremental layout algorithm must search the\npage for dirty elements, accessing a number of auxiliary elements in the\nprocess.

We introduce a new,\nfaster incremental layout algorithm called Spineless Traversal. Spineless\nTraversal uses a more computationally demanding priority queue algorithm to\navoid the need to access auxiliary nodes and thus reduces cache traffic and\nstalls. This leads to dramatic speedups on the most latency-critical\ninteractions such as hovering, typing, or animations.

However, the performance of existing task decomposition\nmethods can be suboptimal when the task contains overly complex logic and\nconstraints. In this situation, the solution generated by LLMs may deviate from\nthe original purpose of the task, or contain redundant or even erroneous\ncontent.

In FT, LLMs are\nprompted to remove the constraints of the original task, therefore simplifying\nit to a general and concise one. In ST, we recall the constraints removed in\nFT, so that LLMs can improve the answer generated in FT to meet the\nrequirements of the original task.

The vast amount of content created, shared, and disseminated\nonline has made it increasingly difficult to access relevant information. Over\nthe past two decades, recommender systems and search (collectively referred to\nas information retrieval systems) have evolved significantly to address these\nchallenges. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated\ncapabilities that surpass human performance in various language-related tasks\nand exhibit general understanding, reasoning, and decision-making abilities.\nThis paper explores the transformative potential of LLM agents in enhancing\nrecommender and search systems. We discuss the motivations and roles of LLM\nagents, and establish a classification framework to elaborate on the existing\nresearch. We highlight the immense potential of LLM agents in addressing\ncurrent challenges in recommendation and search, providing insights into future\nresearch directions. This paper is the first to systematically review and\nclassify the research on LLM agents in these domains, offering a novel\nperspective on leveraging this advanced AI technology for information\nretrieval. To help understand the existing works, we list the existing papers\non LLM agent based recommendation and search at this link:\nhttps://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/LLM-Agent-for-Recommendation-and-Search.",

The vast amount of content created, shared, and disseminated\nonline has made it increasingly difficult to access relevant information. Over\nthe past two decades, recommender systems and search (collectively referred to\nas information retrieval systems) have evolved significantly to address these\nchallenges. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated\ncapabilities that surpass human performance in various language-related tasks\nand exhibit general understanding, reasoning, and decision-making abilities.\nThis paper explores the transformative potential of LLM agents in enhancing\nrecommender and search systems. We discuss the motivations and roles of LLM\nagents, and establish a classification framework to elaborate on the existing\nresearch. We highlight the immense potential of LLM agents in addressing\ncurrent challenges in recommendation and search, providing insights into future\nresearch directions. This paper is the first to systematically review and\nclassify the research on LLM agents in these domains, offering a novel\nperspective on leveraging this advanced AI technology for information\nretrieval.

However, current\npost-training techniques rely heavily on supervisory signals, such as outcome\nsupervision or auxiliary reward models, which face the problem of scalability\nand high annotation costs. This motivates us to enhance LLM reasoning without\nthe need for external supervision. We introduce a generalizable and purely\nunsupervised self-training framework, named Genius. Without external auxiliary,\nGenius requires to seek the optimal response sequence in a stepwise manner and\noptimize the LLM.

However, current\npost-training techniques rely heavily on supervisory signals, such as outcome\nsupervision or auxiliary reward models, which face the problem of scalability\nand high annotation costs. This motivates us to enhance LLM reasoning without\nthe need for external supervision. We introduce a generalizable and purely\nunsupervised self-training framework, named Genius. Without external auxiliary,\nGenius requires to seek the optimal response sequence in a stepwise manner and\noptimize the LLM.

However, existing methods focus solely on\npredicting positions without considering articulation, and only when the hands\nare visible in the field of view. This limitation overlooks the fact that\napproximate hand positions can still be inferred even when they are outside the\ncamera's view. In this paper, we propose a method to forecast the 3D\ntrajectories and poses of both hands from an egocentric video, both in and out\nof the field of view. We propose a diffusion-based transformer architecture for\nEgocentric Hand Forecasting, EgoH4, which takes as input the observation\nsequence and camera poses, then predicts future 3D motion and poses for both\nhands of the camera wearer. We leverage full-body pose information, allowing\nother joints to provide constraints on hand motion. We denoise the hand and\nbody joints along with a visibility predictor for hand joints and a 3D-to-2D\nreprojection loss that minimizes the error when hands are in-view. We evaluate\nEgoH4 on the Ego-Exo4D dataset, combining subsets with body and hand\nannotations. We train on 156K sequences and evaluate on 34K sequences,\nrespectively. EgoH4 improves the performance by 3.4cm and 5.1cm over the\nbaseline in terms of ADE for hand trajectory forecasting and MPJPE for hand\npose forecasting.

                "summary": "Recent advancements in text-to-video (T2V) diffusion models have\nsignificantly enhanced the visual quality of the generated videos. However,\neven recent T2V models find it challenging to follow text descriptions\naccurately, especially when the prompt requires accurate control of spatial\nlayouts or object trajectories. A recent line of research uses layout guidance\nfor T2V models that require fine-tuning or iterative manipulation of the\nattention map during inference time. This significantly increases the memory\nrequirement, making it difficult to adopt a large T2V model as a backbone. To\naddress this, we introduce Video-MSG, a training-free Guidance method for T2V\ngeneration based on Multimodal planning and Structured noise initialization.\nVideo-MSG consists of three steps, where in the first two steps, Video-MSG\ncreates Video Sketch, a fine-grained spatio-temporal plan for the final video,\nspecifying background, foreground, and object trajectories, in the form of\ndraft video frames.

                    "value": "Recent advancements in text-to-video (T2V) diffusion models have\nsignificantly enhanced the visual quality of the generated videos. However,\neven recent T2V models find it challenging to follow text descriptions\naccurately, especially when the prompt requires accurate control of spatial\nlayouts or object trajectories. A recent line of research uses layout guidance\nfor T2V models that require fine-tuning or iterative manipulation of the\nattention map during inference time. This significantly increases the memory\nrequirement, making it difficult to adopt a large T2V model as a backbone. To\naddress this, we introduce Video-MSG, a training-free Guidance method for T2V\ngeneration based on Multimodal planning and Structured noise initialization.\nVideo-MSG consists of three steps, where in the first two steps, Video-MSG\ncreates Video Sketch, a fine-grained spatio-temporal plan for the final video,\nspecifying background, foreground, and object trajectories, in the form of\ndraft video frames. In the last step, Video-MSG guides a downstream T2V\ndiffusion model with Video Sketch through noise inversion and denoising.\nNotably, Video-MSG does not need fine-tuning or attention manipulation with\nadditional memory during inference time, making it easier to adopt large T2V\nmodels.

Unlike conventional\ndiffusion autoencoders operating in image space, LDAE applies the diffusion\nprocess in a compressed latent representation, improving computational\nefficiency and making 3D medical imaging representation learning tractable. To\nvalidate the proposed approach, we explore two key hypotheses: (i) LDAE\neffectively captures meaningful semantic representations on 3D brain MR\nassociated with AD and ageing, and (ii) LDAE achieves high-quality image\ngeneration and reconstruction while being computationally efficient.\nExperimental results support both hypotheses: (i) linear-probe evaluations\ndemonstrate promising diagnostic performance for AD (ROC-AUC: 90%, ACC: 84%)\nand age prediction (MAE: 4.1 years, RMSE: 5.2 years); (ii) the learned semantic\nrepresentations enable attribute manipulation, yielding anatomically plausible\nmodifications; (iii) semantic interpolation experiments show strong\nreconstruction of missing scans, with SSIM of 0.969 (MSE: 0.0019) for a 6-month\ngap. Even for longer gaps (24 months), the model maintains robust performance\n(SSIM > 0.93, MSE < 0.004), indicating an ability to capture temporal\nprogression trends; (iv) compared to conventional diffusion autoencoders, LDAE\nsignificantly increases inference throughput (20x faster) while also enhancing\nreconstruction quality. These findings position LDAE as a promising framework\nfor scalable medical imaging applications, with the potential to serve as a\nfoundation model for medical image analysis.

This paper\nproposes an automated solution framework, MooseAgent, for the multi-physics\nsimulation framework MOOSE, which combines large-scale pre-trained language\nmodels (LLMs) with a multi-agent system. The framework uses LLMs to understand\nuser-described simulation requirements in natural language and employs task\ndecomposition and multi-round iterative verification strategies to\nautomatically generate MOOSE input files. To improve accuracy and reduce model\nhallucinations, the system builds and utilizes a vector database containing\nannotated MOOSE input cards and function documentation. We conducted\nexperimental evaluations on several typical cases, including heat transfer,\nmechanics, phase field, and multi-physics coupling. The results show that\nMooseAgent can automate the MOOSE simulation process to a certain extent,\nespecially demonstrating a high success rate when dealing with relatively\nsimple single-physics problems. The main contribution of this research is the\nproposal of a multi-agent automated framework for MOOSE, which validates its\npotential in simplifying finite element simulation processes and lowering the\nuser barrier, providing new ideas for the development of intelligent finite\nelement simulation software.

However, bridging the\nsim-to-real gap with domain randomization or adversarial methods often demands\nexpert physics knowledge to ensure policy robustness. Even so, cutting-edge\nsimulators may fall short of capturing every real-world detail, and the\nreconstructed environment may introduce errors due to various perception\nuncertainties. To address these challenges, we propose Neural Fidelity\nCalibration (NFC), a novel framework that employs conditional score-based\ndiffusion models to calibrate simulator physical coefficients and residual\nfidelity domains online during robot execution. Specifically, the residual\nfidelity reflects the simulation model shift relative to the real-world\ndynamics and captures the uncertainty of the perceived environment, enabling us\nto sample realistic environments under the inferred distribution for policy\nfine-tuning. Our framework is informative and adaptive in three key ways: (a)\nwe fine-tune the pretrained policy only under anomalous scenarios, (b) we build\nsequential NFC online with the pretrained NFC's proposal prior, reducing the\ndiffusion model's training burden, and (c) when NFC uncertainty is high and may\ndegrade policy improvement, we leverage optimistic exploration to enable\nhallucinated policy optimization. Our framework achieves superior simulator\ncalibration precision compared to state-of-the-art methods across diverse\nrobots with high-dimensional parametric spaces. We study the critical\ncontribution of residual fidelity to policy improvement in simulation and\nreal-world experiments.

To mitigate these limitations,\nD-Wave Systems developed a mechanism called Reverse Annealing, a specific type\nof quantum annealing designed to perform local refinement of good states found\nelsewhere. Despite the research activity around Reverse Annealing, none has\ntheorized about the possible benefits related to the transfer of knowledge\nunder this paradigm.

LLMs are expected to eliminate that\nby perceiving the information in the visual- or auditory-grounded instructions.\nTherefore, in this paper, we propose MLLM-Tool, a system incorporating\nopen-source LLMs and multi-modal encoders so that the learned LLMs can be\nconscious of multi-modal input instruction and then select the function-matched\ntool correctly. To facilitate the evaluation of the model's capability, we\ncollect a dataset featuring multi-modal input tools from HuggingFace. Another\nessential feature of our dataset is that it also contains multiple potential\nchoices for the same instruction due to the existence of identical functions\nand synonymous functions, which provides more potential solutions for the same\nquery.

In this\nwork, we propose MineWorld, a real-time interactive world model on Minecraft,\nan open-ended sandbox game which has been utilized as a common testbed for\nworld modeling. MineWorld is driven by a visual-action autoregressive\nTransformer, which takes paired game scenes and corresponding actions as input,\nand generates consequent new scenes following the actions. Specifically, by\ntransforming visual game scenes and actions into discrete token ids with an\nimage tokenizer and an action tokenizer correspondingly, we consist the model\ninput with the concatenation of the two kinds of ids interleaved. The model is\nthen trained with next token prediction to learn rich representations of game\nstates as well as the conditions between states and actions simultaneously. In\ninference, we develop a novel parallel decoding algorithm that predicts the\nspatial redundant tokens in each frame at the same time, letting models in\ndifferent scales generate $4$ to $7$ frames per second and enabling real-time\ninteractions with game players. In evaluation, we propose new metrics to assess\nnot only visual quality but also the action following capacity when generating\nnew scenes, which is crucial for a world model. Our comprehensive evaluation\nshows the efficacy of MineWorld, outperforming SoTA open-sourced diffusion\nbased world models significantly. The code and model have been released.",

                    "value": "World modeling is a crucial task for enabling intelligent agents to\neffectively interact with humans and operate in dynamic environments. In this\nwork, we propose MineWorld, a real-time interactive world model on Minecraft,\nan open-ended sandbox game which has been utilized as a common testbed for\nworld modeling. MineWorld is driven by a visual-action autoregressive\nTransformer, which takes paired game scenes and corresponding actions as input,\nand generates consequent new scenes following the actions. Specifically, by\ntransforming visual game scenes and actions into discrete token ids with an\nimage tokenizer and an action tokenizer correspondingly, we consist the model\ninput with the concatenation of the two kinds of ids interleaved. The model is\nthen trained with next token prediction to learn rich representations of game\nstates as well as the conditions between states and actions simultaneously. In\ninference, we develop a novel parallel decoding algorithm that predicts the\nspatial redundant tokens in each frame at the same time, letting models in\ndifferent scales generate $4$ to $7$ frames per second and enabling real-time\ninteractions with game players. In evaluation, we propose new metrics to assess\nnot only visual quality but also the action following capacity when generating\nnew scenes, which is crucial for a world model. Our comprehensive evaluation\nshows the efficacy of MineWorld, outperforming SoTA open-sourced diffusion\nbased world models significantly. The code and model have been released."

To stabilize the training process, we propose depth-scaled sandwich\nnormalization, which effectively eliminates loss spikes during the training\nprocess of deep models. We pre-train our model on 13.2 trillion diverse and\nhigh-quality tokens and further enhance its reasoning capabilities during\npost-training. To perform such large-scale training efficiently, we utilize\n8,192 Ascend NPUs with a series of system optimizations. Evaluations on\nmultiple diverse benchmarks indicate that Pangu Ultra significantly advances\nthe state-of-the-art capabilities of dense LLMs such as Llama 405B and Mistral\nLarge 2, and even achieves competitive results with DeepSeek-R1, whose sparse\nmodel structure contains much more parameters. Our exploration demonstrates\nthat Ascend NPUs are capable of efficiently and effectively training dense\nmodels with more than 100 billion parameters.

We address\nthese limitations via IdealGPT, a framework that iteratively decomposes VL\nreasoning using large language models (LLMs).

                "summary": "Agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated\nimpressive capabilities in various tasks. Still, they face limitations in tasks\nrequiring specific, structured knowledge, flexibility, or accountable\ndecision-making. While agents are capable of perceiving their environments,\nforming inferences, planning, and executing actions towards goals, they often\nface issues such as hallucinations and lack of contextual memory across\ninteractions. This paper explores how Case-Based Reasoning (CBR), a strategy\nthat solves new problems by referencing past experiences, can be integrated\ninto LLM agent frameworks. This integration allows LLMs to leverage explicit\nknowledge, enhancing their effectiveness. We systematically review the\ntheoretical foundations of these enhanced agents, identify critical framework\ncomponents, and formulate a mathematical model for the CBR processes of case\nretrieval, adaptation, and learning. We also evaluate CBR-enhanced agents\nagainst other methods like Chain-of-Thought reasoning and standard\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation, analyzing their relative strengths. Moreover,\nwe explore how leveraging CBR's cognitive dimensions (including\nself-reflection, introspection, and curiosity) via goal-driven autonomy\nmechanisms can further enhance the LLM agent capabilities. Contributing to the\nongoing research on neuro-symbolic hybrid systems, this work posits CBR as a\nviable technique for enhancing the reasoning skills and cognitive aspects of\nautonomous LLM agents.",

                    "value": "Agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated\nimpressive capabilities in various tasks. Still, they face limitations in tasks\nrequiring specific, structured knowledge, flexibility, or accountable\ndecision-making. While agents are capable of perceiving their environments,\nforming inferences, planning, and executing actions towards goals, they often\nface issues such as hallucinations and lack of contextual memory across\ninteractions. This paper explores how Case-Based Reasoning (CBR), a strategy\nthat solves new problems by referencing past experiences, can be integrated\ninto LLM agent frameworks. This integration allows LLMs to leverage explicit\nknowledge, enhancing their effectiveness. We systematically review the\ntheoretical foundations of these enhanced agents, identify critical framework\ncomponents, and formulate a mathematical model for the CBR processes of case\nretrieval, adaptation, and learning. We also evaluate CBR-enhanced agents\nagainst other methods like Chain-of-Thought reasoning and standard\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation, analyzing their relative strengths. Moreover,\nwe explore how leveraging CBR's cognitive dimensions (including\nself-reflection, introspection, and curiosity) via goal-driven autonomy\nmechanisms can further enhance the LLM agent capabilities. Contributing to the\nongoing research on neuro-symbolic hybrid systems, this work posits CBR as a\nviable technique for enhancing the reasoning skills and cognitive aspects of\nautonomous LLM agents."

While\nlarge-N arrays have shown the potential of dense observational data, their\ndeployment over extensive areas is constrained by economic and logistical\nlimitations. Numerical simulations offer an alternative, but modeling realistic\nwavefields remains computationally expensive. To address these challenges, we\ndevelop a multi-conditional diffusion transformer for generating seismic\nwavefields without requiring prior geological knowledge. Our method produces\nhigh-resolution wavefields that accurately capture both amplitude and phase\ninformation across diverse source and station configurations. The model first\ngenerates amplitude spectra conditioned on input attributes and subsequently\nrefines wavefields through iterative phase optimization. We validate our\napproach using data from the Geysers geothermal field, demonstrating the\ngeneration of wavefields with spatial continuity and fidelity in both spectral\namplitude and phase. These synthesized wavefields hold promise for advancing\nstructural imaging and source characterization in seismology.",

While\nlarge-N arrays have shown the potential of dense observational data, their\ndeployment over extensive areas is constrained by economic and logistical\nlimitations. Numerical simulations offer an alternative, but modeling realistic\nwavefields remains computationally expensive. To address these challenges, we\ndevelop a multi-conditional diffusion transformer for generating seismic\nwavefields without requiring prior geological knowledge. Our method produces\nhigh-resolution wavefields that accurately capture both amplitude and phase\ninformation across diverse source and station configurations. The model first\ngenerates amplitude spectra conditioned on input attributes and subsequently\nrefines wavefields through iterative phase optimization. We validate our\napproach using data from the Geysers geothermal field, demonstrating the\ngeneration of wavefields with spatial continuity and fidelity in both spectral\namplitude and phase. These synthesized wavefields hold promise for advancing\nstructural imaging and source characterization in seismology."

Analysis of SWE agent\ntrajectories is difficult, not only as they exceed LLM sequence length\n(sometimes, greater than 128k) but also because it involves a relatively\nprolonged interaction between an LLM and the environment managed by the agent.\nIn case of an agent error, it can be hard to decipher, locate and understand\nits scope.

The MCP is an open protocol that standardizes API\ncalls to large language models (LLMs), data sources, and agentic tools. By\nconnecting multiple MCP servers, each defined with a set of tools, resources,\nand prompts, users are able to define automated workflows fully driven by LLMs.\nHowever, we show that the current MCP design carries a wide range of security\nrisks for end users. In particular, we demonstrate that industry-leading LLMs\nmay be coerced into using MCP tools to compromise an AI developer's system\nthrough various attacks, such as malicious code execution, remote access\ncontrol, and credential theft. To proactively mitigate these and related\nattacks, we introduce a safety auditing tool, MCPSafetyScanner, the first\nagentic tool to assess the security of an arbitrary MCP server. MCPScanner uses\nseveral agents to (a) automatically determine adversarial samples given an MCP\nserver's tools and resources; (b) search for related vulnerabilities and\nremediations based on those samples; and (c) generate a security report\ndetailing all findings.

We argue that\nvoice-based interaction can naturally facilitate this conversational exchange,\nencouraging writers' engagement with higher-order concerns, facilitating\niterative refinement of their reflections, and reduce cognitive load compared\nto text-based interactions. To investigate these effects, we propose a\nformative study exploring how text vs. voice input influence writers'\nreflection and subsequent revisions.

In this work, we propose, Safe Flow Matching\n(SafeFM), a motion planning approach for trajectory generation that integrates\nflow matching with safety guarantees. By incorporating the proposed flow\nmatching barrier functions, SafeFM ensures that generated trajectories remain\nwithin safe regions throughout the planning horizon, even in the presence of\npreviously unseen obstacles or state-action constraints. Unlike diffusion-based\napproaches, our method allows for direct, efficient sampling of\nconstraint-satisfying trajectories, making it well-suited for real-time motion\nplanning. We evaluate SafeFM on a diverse set of tasks, including planar robot\nnavigation and 7-DoF manipulation, demonstrating superior safety,\ngeneralization, and planning performance compared to state-of-the-art\ngenerative planners.

We then\npresent in detail our AI incident regime proposal, justifying each component of\nthe proposal by demonstrating its similarity to US domestic incident regimes in\nother 'security-critical' sectors. Finally, we sketch a hypothetical scenario\nwhere our proposed AI incident regime deals with an AI cyber incident. Our\nproposed AI incident regime is split into three phases. The first phase\nrevolves around a novel operationalization of what counts as an 'AI incident'\nand we suggest that AI providers must create a 'national security case' before\ndeploying a frontier AI system. The second and third phases spell out that AI\nproviders should notify a government agency about incidents, and that the\ngovernment agency should be involved in amending AI providers' security and\nsafety procedures, in order to counter future threats to national security.",

We then\npresent in detail our AI incident regime proposal, justifying each component of\nthe proposal by demonstrating its similarity to US domestic incident regimes in\nother 'security-critical' sectors. Finally, we sketch a hypothetical scenario\nwhere our proposed AI incident regime deals with an AI cyber incident. Our\nproposed AI incident regime is split into three phases. The first phase\nrevolves around a novel operationalization of what counts as an 'AI incident'\nand we suggest that AI providers must create a 'national security case' before\ndeploying a frontier AI system. The second and third phases spell out that AI\nproviders should notify a government agency about incidents, and that the\ngovernment agency should be involved in amending AI providers' security and\nsafety procedures, in order to counter future threats to national security."

Recently, Tang et al. proposed CaseLink, a novel graph-based method\nfor legal case retrieval, which models both cases and legal charges as nodes in\na network, with edges representing relationships such as references and shared\nsemantics. This approach offers a new perspective on the task by capturing\nhigher-order relationships of cases going beyond the stand-alone level of\ndocuments. However, while this shift in approaching legal case retrieval is a\npromising direction in an understudied area of graph-based legal IR, challenges\nin reproducing novel results have recently been highlighted, with multiple\nstudies reporting difficulties in reproducing previous findings. Thus, in this\nwork we reproduce CaseLink, a graph-based legal case retrieval method, to\nsupport future research in this area of IR. In particular, we aim to assess its\nreliability and generalizability by (i) first reproducing the original study\nsetup and (ii) applying the approach to an additional dataset.

                "summary": "The field of vision-and-language (VL) understanding has made unprecedented\nprogress with end-to-end large pre-trained VL models (VLMs). However, they\nstill fall short in zero-shot reasoning tasks that require multi-step\ninferencing. To achieve this goal, previous works resort to a\ndivide-and-conquer pipeline. In this paper, we argue that previous efforts have\nseveral inherent shortcomings: 1) They rely on domain-specific sub-question\ndecomposing models. 2) They force models to predict the final answer even if\nthe sub-questions or sub-answers provide insufficient information. We address\nthese limitations via IdealGPT, a framework that iteratively decomposes VL\nreasoning using large language models (LLMs). Specifically, IdealGPT utilizes\nan LLM to generate sub-questions, a VLM to provide corresponding sub-answers,\nand another LLM to reason to achieve the final answer. These three modules\nperform the divide-and-conquer procedure iteratively until the model is\nconfident about the final answer to the main question. We evaluate IdealGPT on\nmultiple challenging VL reasoning tasks under a zero-shot setting. In\nparticular, our IdealGPT outperforms the best existing GPT-4-like models by an\nabsolute 10% on VCR and 15% on SNLI-VE. Code is available at\nhttps://github.com/Hxyou/IdealGPT",

Such\npatterns can be used to identify lines of text containing references to\nsemantic concepts such as cities, celebrities, political entities, etc. The\nfocus in their paper was on automatically synthesizing semantic regular\nexpressions from positive and negative examples. In this paper, we study the\nmembership testing problem:\n  First, We present a two-pass NFA-based algorithm to determine whether a\nstring $w$ matches a semantic regular expression (SemRE) $r$ in $O(|r|^2 |w|^2\n+ |r| |w|^3)$ time, assuming the oracle responds to each query in unit time. In\ncommon situations, where oracle queries are not nested, we show that this\nprocedure runs in $O(|r|^2 |w|^2)$ time. Experiments with a prototype\nimplementation of this algorithm validate our theoretical analysis, and show\nthat the procedure massively outperforms a dynamic programming-based baseline,\nand incurs a $\\approx 2 \\times$ overhead over the time needed for interaction\nwith the oracle.\n  Next, We establish connections between SemRE membership testing and the\ntriangle finding problem from graph theory, which suggest that developing\nalgorithms which are simultaneously practical and asymptotically faster might\nbe challenging. Furthermore, algorithms for classical regular expressions\nprimarily aim to optimize their time and memory consumption. In contrast, an\nimportant consideration in our setting is to minimize the cost of invoking the\noracle. We demonstrate an $\\Omega(|w|^2)$ lower bound on the number of oracle\nqueries necessary to make this determination.",

This newly introduced scenario exacerbates the general\noverthinking issue to a large extent, which we name as the MiP-Overthinking.\nSuch failures are against the ``test-time scaling law'' but have been widely\nobserved on multiple datasets we curated with MiP, indicating the harm of cheap\noverthinking and a lack of critical thinking. Surprisingly, LLMs not\nspecifically trained for reasoning exhibit much better performance on the MiP\nscenario, producing much shorter responses that quickly identify ill-posed\nqueries. This implies a critical flaw of the current training recipe for\nreasoning LLMs, which does not encourage efficient thinking adequately, leading\nto the abuse of thinking patterns. To further investigate the reasons behind\nsuch failures, we conduct fine-grained analyses of the reasoning length,\noverthinking patterns, and location of critical thinking on different types of\nLLMs. Moreover, our extended ablation study reveals that the overthinking is\ncontagious through the distillation of reasoning models' responses. These\nresults improve the understanding of overthinking and shed novel insights into\nmitigating the problem.",

This newly introduced scenario exacerbates the general\noverthinking issue to a large extent, which we name as the MiP-Overthinking.\nSuch failures are against the ``test-time scaling law'' but have been widely\nobserved on multiple datasets we curated with MiP, indicating the harm of cheap\noverthinking and a lack of critical thinking. Surprisingly, LLMs not\nspecifically trained for reasoning exhibit much better performance on the MiP\nscenario, producing much shorter responses that quickly identify ill-posed\nqueries. This implies a critical flaw of the current training recipe for\nreasoning LLMs, which does not encourage efficient thinking adequately, leading\nto the abuse of thinking patterns. To further investigate the reasons behind\nsuch failures, we conduct fine-grained analyses of the reasoning length,\noverthinking patterns, and location of critical thinking on different types of\nLLMs. Moreover, our extended ablation study reveals that the overthinking is\ncontagious through the distillation of reasoning models' responses. These\nresults improve the understanding of overthinking and shed novel insights into\nmitigating the problem."

The study\ndemonstrates a correlation between Patched RTC scores and task-specific\naccuracy metrics, presenting it as an alternative to the LLM-as-Judge paradigm\nfor open-domain task evaluation. We implement Patched RTC in an open-source\nframework called patchwork, allowing for transparent evaluation during\ninference across various patchflows. Experiments comparing GPT-3.5 and GPT-4\nmodels across different software development tasks reveal that Patched RTC\neffectively distinguishes model performance and task difficulty.

The study\ndemonstrates a correlation between Patched RTC scores and task-specific\naccuracy metrics, presenting it as an alternative to the LLM-as-Judge paradigm\nfor open-domain task evaluation. We implement Patched RTC in an open-source\nframework called patchwork, allowing for transparent evaluation during\ninference across various patchflows. Experiments comparing GPT-3.5 and GPT-4\nmodels across different software development tasks reveal that Patched RTC\neffectively distinguishes model performance and task difficulty. The paper also\nexplores the impact of consistency prompts on improving model accuracy,\nsuggesting that Patched RTC can guide prompt refinement and model selection for\ncomplex software development workflows."

In what was arguably the first Bayesian case study, Mosteller\nand Wallace (1963) provided the first statistical evidence for attributing all\ndisputed papers to Madison. Our paper revisits this historical dataset but from\na lens of modern language models, both small and large. We review some of the\nmore popular Large Language Model (LLM) tools and examine them from a\nstatistical point of view in the context of text classification. We investigate\nwhether, without any attempt to fine-tune, the general embedding constructs can\nbe useful for stylometry and attribution.

Here we demonstrate a quantum-assured\nMagNav solution based on proprietary quantum magnetometers with by a novel\ndenoising and map-matching algorithms. The system fits on fixed-wing drones or\nin the avionics bay of a commercial airliner. We present trials at altitudes up\nto 19000 feet, testing onboard and outboard quantum magnetometers comparing\nagainst a strategic-grade INS. Our MagNav solution achieves superior\nperformance, delivering up to 46x better positioning error than the\nvelocity-aided INS; the best final positioning accuracy we achieve is 22m or\n0.006% of the flight distance. Airborne trials consistently achieve at least\n11x advantage over the INS across varying conditions, altitudes, and flight\npatterns. The system learns model parameters online without special vehicle\nmaneuvers providing robustness to various configuration changes (e.g. changing\npayload or latitude). Our trials also include the first successful MagNav\nperformed in a ground vehicle using publicly-available anomaly maps, delivering\nbounded positioning error 7x lower than the INS, with both systems in strapdown\nconfiguration.",

Here we demonstrate a quantum-assured\nMagNav solution based on proprietary quantum magnetometers with by a novel\ndenoising and map-matching algorithms. The system fits on fixed-wing drones or\nin the avionics bay of a commercial airliner. We present trials at altitudes up\nto 19000 feet, testing onboard and outboard quantum magnetometers comparing\nagainst a strategic-grade INS. Our MagNav solution achieves superior\nperformance, delivering up to 46x better positioning error than the\nvelocity-aided INS; the best final positioning accuracy we achieve is 22m or\n0.006% of the flight distance. Airborne trials consistently achieve at least\n11x advantage over the INS across varying conditions, altitudes, and flight\npatterns. The system learns model parameters online without special vehicle\nmaneuvers providing robustness to various configuration changes (e.g. changing\npayload or latitude). Our trials also include the first successful MagNav\nperformed in a ground vehicle using publicly-available anomaly maps, delivering\nbounded positioning error 7x lower than the INS, with both systems in strapdown\nconfiguration."
