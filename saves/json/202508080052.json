However, integrating MoD into MLLMs is non-trivial. To address the\nchallenges of training and inference stability as well as limited training\ndata, we adapt the MoD module with two novel designs: tanh-gated weight\nnormalization (TanhNorm) and symmetric token reweighting (STRing). Moreover, we\nobserve that vision tokens exhibit higher redundancy in deeper layers and thus\ndesign a progressive ratio decay (PRD) strategy, which gradually reduces the\ntoken retention ratio layer by layer, employing a shifted cosine schedule. This\ncrucial design fully unleashes the potential of MoD, significantly boosting the\nefficiency and performance of our models.

When such services are deployed in constrained memory\nenvironments, they present challenging requirements: point operations requiring\nhigh throughput, working sets much larger than main memory, and natural skew in\nkey access patterns. Traditional KV stores, based on LSM- and B-Trees, have\nbeen widely used to handle such use cases, but they often suffer from\nsuboptimal use of modern hardware resources. The FASTER project, developed as a\nhigh-performance open-source KV storage library, has demonstrated remarkable\nsuccess in both in-memory and hybrid storage environments. However, when tasked\nwith serving large skewed workloads, it faced challenges, including high\nindexing and compactions overheads, and inefficient management of\nnon-overlapping read-hot and write-hot working sets.\n  In this paper, we introduce F2 (for FASTER v2), an evolution of FASTER\ndesigned to meet the requirements of large skewed workloads common in industry\napplications. F2 adopts a two-tier record-oriented design to handle\nlarger-than-memory skewed workloads, along with new concurrent latch-free\nmechanisms and components to maximize performance on modern hardware. To\nrealize this design, F2 tackles key challenges and introduces several\ninnovations, including new latch-free algorithms for multi-threaded log\ncompaction, a two-level hash index to reduce indexing overhead for cold\nrecords, and a read-cache for serving read-hot records. Our evaluation shows\nthat F2 achieves 2-11.9x better throughput compared to existing KV stores,\neffectively serving the target workload. F2 is open-source and available as\npart of the FASTER project.",

Traditional KV stores, based on LSM- and B-Trees, have\nbeen widely used to handle such use cases, but they often suffer from\nsuboptimal use of modern hardware resources. The FASTER project, developed as a\nhigh-performance open-source KV storage library, has demonstrated remarkable\nsuccess in both in-memory and hybrid storage environments. However, when tasked\nwith serving large skewed workloads, it faced challenges, including high\nindexing and compactions overheads, and inefficient management of\nnon-overlapping read-hot and write-hot working sets.\n  In this paper, we introduce F2 (for FASTER v2), an evolution of FASTER\ndesigned to meet the requirements of large skewed workloads common in industry\napplications. F2 adopts a two-tier record-oriented design to handle\nlarger-than-memory skewed workloads, along with new concurrent latch-free\nmechanisms and components to maximize performance on modern hardware. To\nrealize this design, F2 tackles key challenges and introduces several\ninnovations, including new latch-free algorithms for multi-threaded log\ncompaction, a two-level hash index to reduce indexing overhead for cold\nrecords, and a read-cache for serving read-hot records. Our evaluation shows\nthat F2 achieves 2-11.9x better throughput compared to existing KV stores,\neffectively serving the target workload. F2 is open-source and available as\npart of the FASTER project."

Despite the\nadvancements, their practical deployment faces challenges, including high\nfinancial costs, long response time, and varying performance, especially when\nhandling a large number of queries (jobs). Existing optimization strategies for\ndeploying LLMs for diverse tasks focus on static scheduling, which requires\nextensive training data for performance prediction, increasing the\ncomputational costs and limiting the applicability and flexibility. In this\npaper, we propose the SmartLLMs Scheduler (SLS), a dynamic and cost-effective\nscheduling solution. The key idea is to learn LLMs' performance on diverse\ntasks and incorporate their real-time feedback to update strategies\nperiodically. Specifically, SLS incorporates three key components, including an\nAdaptive Cache Manager, a Performance-Cost Optimized Scheduler, and a Dynamic\nUpdate Manager. The Cache Manager stores the outputs of previously processed\nqueries and employs an adaptive strategy to reduce redundant computations and\nminimize response times. For queries not found in the cache, the Scheduler\ndynamically allocates them to the most suitable LLM based on the predicted\nperformance and cost from models that take both query-specific and LLM-specific\nfeatures as input. The Update Manager continuously refines the cache and\nscheduling strategies based on real-time feedback from the assigned queries to\nenhance decision-making and adapt to evolving task characteristics. To evaluate\nthe effectiveness of SLS, we conduct extensive experiments on two LLM-based\nsoftware engineering tasks, including log parsing and code generation. The\nresults show that SLS significantly outperforms the baseline methods, achieving\nan average performance improvement of 198.82% and an average processing time\nreduction of 63.28%.",

Simultaneously, the vast amounts of short-lived\ndata in these workloads make SRAM overprovisioned in retention capability. To\naddress this mismatch, we propose a wholesale shift from uniform SRAM arrays to\nheterogeneous on-chip memory, incorporating denser short-term RAM (StRAM)\ndevices whose limited retention times align with transient data lifetimes. To\nfacilitate this shift, we introduce GainSight, the first comprehensive,\nopen-source framework that aligns dynamic, fine-grained workload lifetime\nprofiles with memory device characteristics to enable generation of optimal\nStRAM memory compositions. GainSight combines retargetable profiling backends\nwith an architecture-agnostic analytical frontend. The various backends capture\ncycle-accurate data lifetimes, while the frontend correlates workload patterns\nwith StRAM retention properties to generate optimal memory compositions and\nproject performance. GainSight elevates data lifetime to a first-class design\nconsideration for next-generation AI accelerators, enabling systematic\nexploitation of data transience for improved on-chip memory density and\nefficiency. Applying GainSight to MLPerf Inference and PolyBench workloads\nreveals that 64.3% of first-level GPU cache accesses and 79.01% of systolic\narray scratchpad accesses exhibit sub-microsecond lifetimes suitable for\nhigh-density StRAM, with optimal heterogeneous on-chip memory compositions\nachieving up to 3x active energy and 4x area reductions compared to uniform\nSRAM hierarchies.

Existing KV cache compression methods often discard less\nrelevant tokens, which can lead to significant performance degradation when\ncritical information is lost. In this paper, we propose \\textsc{PoD}~(Proximal\ntokens over Distant tokens), a novel KV cache compression framework that\nallocates memory according to token importance, retaining less important tokens\nin a more compact, shared form rather than discarding them entirely. Our\napproach is motivated by two key observations: (1) proximal tokens -- those at\nthe beginning and end of the context -- are significantly more important for\nnext-token prediction, and (2) attention scores for distant tokens are highly\nredundant across consecutive layers. Leveraging these insights, \\textsc{PoD}\npreserves the full KV cache for proximal tokens, while for distant tokens, it\nshares key states across layers. Since attention scores are determined by both\nqueries and keys, sharing key states enables multiple layers to reuse a single\nset of keys for distant tokens, substantially reducing KV cache memory without\ndiscarding essential context. We further introduce a lightweight post-training\nadaptation to enable the model to adjust to this new attention-sharing\nstructure. Extensive experiments on both synthetic~(Needle in a Haystack) and\nreal-world long-context benchmarks demonstrate that \\textsc{PoD} reduces KV\ncache memory usage by up to 35\\% without compromising performance.

However,\nexisting methods rely on alternating perception-reaction or asynchronous\ntriggers, lacking task-driven planning and future anticipation, which limits\ntheir real-time responsiveness and proactive decision making in evolving video\nstreams. To this end, we propose a StreamAgent that anticipates the temporal\nintervals and spatial regions expected to contain future task-relevant\ninformation to enable proactive and goal-driven responses. Specifically, we\nintegrate question semantics and historical observations through prompting the\nanticipatory agent to anticipate the temporal progression of key events, align\ncurrent observations with the expected future evidence, and subsequently adjust\nthe perception action (e.g., attending to task-relevant regions or continuously\ntracking in subsequent frames). To enable efficient inference, we design a\nstreaming KV-cache memory mechanism that constructs a hierarchical memory\nstructure for selective recall of relevant tokens, enabling efficient semantic\nretrieval while reducing the overhead of storing all tokens in the traditional\nKV-cache.

By analogy with quantum\nsystems, these observables are linked by an uncertainty-like constraint:\nalgorithmic determinism ensures structural uniformity, while system-level\nfluctuations introduce irreducible unpredictability. We realize this framework\nconcretely as \\emph{QPP-RNG}, a system-embedded, software-based true random\nnumber generator (TRNG).

                    "value": "We propose and experimentally demonstrate the \\emph{Quasi-Superposition\nQuantum-inspired System (QSQS)} -- a conceptual quantum system for randomness\ngeneration built on measuring two conjugate observables of a permutation\nsorting process: the deterministic permutation count $n_p$ and the\nfundamentally non-deterministic sorting time $t$. By analogy with quantum\nsystems, these observables are linked by an uncertainty-like constraint:\nalgorithmic determinism ensures structural uniformity, while system-level\nfluctuations introduce irreducible unpredictability. We realize this framework\nconcretely as \\emph{QPP-RNG}, a system-embedded, software-based true random\nnumber generator (TRNG).

However, their inherently sequential\ndenoising process results in high inference latency, limiting their deployment\nin real-time scenarios. Existing training-free acceleration approaches\ntypically reuse intermediate features at fixed timesteps or layers, overlooking\nthe evolving semantic focus across denoising stages and Transformer blocks.To\naddress this, we propose Sortblock, a training-free inference acceleration\nframework that dynamically caches block-wise features based on their similarity\nacross adjacent timesteps. By ranking the evolution of residuals, Sortblock\nadaptively determines a recomputation ratio, selectively skipping redundant\ncomputations while preserving generation quality. Furthermore, we incorporate a\nlightweight linear prediction mechanism to reduce accumulated errors in skipped\nblocks.Extensive experiments across various tasks and DiT architectures\ndemonstrate that Sortblock achieves over 2$\\times$ inference speedup with\nminimal degradation in output quality, offering an effective and generalizable\nsolution for accelerating diffusion-based generative models.",

                    "value": "Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated remarkable generative\ncapabilities, particularly benefiting from Transformer architectures that\nenhance visual and artistic fidelity. However, their inherently sequential\ndenoising process results in high inference latency, limiting their deployment\nin real-time scenarios. Existing training-free acceleration approaches\ntypically reuse intermediate features at fixed timesteps or layers, overlooking\nthe evolving semantic focus across denoising stages and Transformer blocks.To\naddress this, we propose Sortblock, a training-free inference acceleration\nframework that dynamically caches block-wise features based on their similarity\nacross adjacent timesteps. By ranking the evolution of residuals, Sortblock\nadaptively determines a recomputation ratio, selectively skipping redundant\ncomputations while preserving generation quality. Furthermore, we incorporate a\nlightweight linear prediction mechanism to reduce accumulated errors in skipped\nblocks.Extensive experiments across various tasks and DiT architectures\ndemonstrate that Sortblock achieves over 2$\\times$ inference speedup with\nminimal degradation in output quality, offering an effective and generalizable\nsolution for accelerating diffusion-based generative models."

In this paper, we introduce SQuat (Subspace-orthogonal KV cache\nquantization). It first constructs a subspace spanned by query tensors to\ncapture the most critical task-related information. During key tensor\nquantization, it enforces that the difference between the (de)quantized and\noriginal keys remains orthogonal to this subspace, minimizing the impact of\nquantization errors on the attention mechanism's outputs.

This work proposes\nNestQuant, a novel PTQ scheme for weights and activations that is based on\nself-similar nested lattices. Recent works have mathematically shown such\nquantizers to be information-theoretically optimal for low-precision matrix\nmultiplication. We implement a practical low-complexity version of NestQuant\nbased on Gosset lattice, making it a drop-in quantizer for any matrix\nmultiplication step (e.g., in self-attention, MLP etc). For example, NestQuant\nquantizes weights, KV-cache, and activations of Llama-3-8B to 4 bits, achieving\nperplexity of 6.6 on wikitext2. This represents more than 55% reduction in\nperplexity gap with respect to unquantized model (perplexity of 6.14) compared\nto state-of-the-art Metas SpinQuant (perplexity 7.3), OstQuant (7.3) and QuaRot\n(8.2). Comparisons on bigger models (up to 70B) and on various LLM evaluation\nbenchmarks confirm uniform superiority of NestQuant.",

                    "value": "Post-training quantization (PTQ) has emerged as a critical technique for\nefficient deployment of large language models (LLMs). This work proposes\nNestQuant, a novel PTQ scheme for weights and activations that is based on\nself-similar nested lattices. Recent works have mathematically shown such\nquantizers to be information-theoretically optimal for low-precision matrix\nmultiplication. We implement a practical low-complexity version of NestQuant\nbased on Gosset lattice, making it a drop-in quantizer for any matrix\nmultiplication step (e.g., in self-attention, MLP etc). For example, NestQuant\nquantizes weights, KV-cache, and activations of Llama-3-8B to 4 bits, achieving\nperplexity of 6.6 on wikitext2. This represents more than 55% reduction in\nperplexity gap with respect to unquantized model (perplexity of 6.14) compared\nto state-of-the-art Metas SpinQuant (perplexity 7.3), OstQuant (7.3) and QuaRot\n(8.2). Comparisons on bigger models (up to 70B) and on various LLM evaluation\nbenchmarks confirm uniform superiority of NestQuant."

This paper introduces Step-3, a\n321B-parameter VLM with hardware-aware model-system co-design optimized for\nminimizing decoding costs. Step-3 innovates in two key dimensions: (1) A novel\nMulti-Matrix Factorization Attention (MFA) mechanism that significantly reduces\nboth KV cache size and computation while maintaining high attention\nexpressiveness, and (2) Attention-FFN Disaggregation (AFD), a distributed\ninference system that decouples attention and Feed-Forward Network (FFN) layers\ninto specialized subsystems. This co-design achieves unprecedented cost\nefficiency: Step-3 significantly reduces theoretical decoding costs compared\nwith models like DeepSeek-V3 and Qwen3 MoE 235B, with the gains widening at\nlonger context. Step-3 achieves low cost while activating 38B parameters per\ntoken (more than DeepSeek-V3 and Qwen3 MoE 235B), demonstrating that\nhardware-aligned attention arithmetic intensity, MoE sparsity, and AFD are\ncritical to cost-effectiveness. We perform a head-to-head comparison with\nDeepSeek-V3 in its favorable scenarios. Our implementation on Hopper GPUs\nachieves a decoding throughput of up to 4,039 tokens per second per GPU under\n50ms TPOT SLA (4K context, FP8, no MTP). It is higher than DeepSeek-V3's 2,324\nin the same setup and sets a new Pareto frontier for LLM decoding.",

The proposed approach employs an Arrival-Order Speaker Cache\n(AOSC) to store frame-level acoustic embeddings of previously observed\nspeakers. Unlike conventional speaker-tracing buffers, AOSC orders embeddings\nby speaker index corresponding to their arrival time order, and is dynamically\nupdated by selecting frames with the highest scores based on the model's past\npredictions.

                    "value": "This paper presents a streaming extension for the Sortformer speaker\ndiarization framework, whose key property is the arrival-time ordering of\noutput speakers. The proposed approach employs an Arrival-Order Speaker Cache\n(AOSC) to store frame-level acoustic embeddings of previously observed\nspeakers. Unlike conventional speaker-tracing buffers, AOSC orders embeddings\nby speaker index corresponding to their arrival time order, and is dynamically\nupdated by selecting frames with the highest scores based on the model's past\npredictions. Notably, the number of stored embeddings per speaker is determined\ndynamically by the update mechanism, ensuring efficient cache utilization and\nprecise speaker tracking. Experiments on benchmark datasets confirm the\neffectiveness and flexibility of our approach, even in low-latency setups.\nThese results establish Streaming Sortformer as a robust solution for real-time\nmulti-speaker tracking and a foundation for streaming multi-talker speech\nprocessing."

This concerning issue has\nrenewed the efforts in developing protection mechanisms based on adversarial\nattacks, which generate effective perturbations to poison diffusion models. Our\nwork is motivated by the observation that these models exhibit a high degree of\nabstraction within their semantic latent space (`h-space'), which encodes\ncritical high-level features for generating coherent and meaningful content. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel anti-customization approach, called HAAD\n(h-space based Adversarial Attack for Diffusion models), that leverages\nadversarial attacks to craft perturbations based on the h-space that can\nefficiently degrade the image generation process. Building upon HAAD, we\nfurther introduce a more efficient variant, HAAD-KV, that constructs\nperturbations solely based on the KV parameters of the h-space. This strategy\noffers a stronger protection, that is computationally less expensive. Despite\ntheir simplicity, our methods outperform state-of-the-art adversarial attacks,\nhighlighting their effectiveness.",

This concerning issue has\nrenewed the efforts in developing protection mechanisms based on adversarial\nattacks, which generate effective perturbations to poison diffusion models. Our\nwork is motivated by the observation that these models exhibit a high degree of\nabstraction within their semantic latent space (`h-space'), which encodes\ncritical high-level features for generating coherent and meaningful content. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel anti-customization approach, called HAAD\n(h-space based Adversarial Attack for Diffusion models), that leverages\nadversarial attacks to craft perturbations based on the h-space that can\nefficiently degrade the image generation process. Building upon HAAD, we\nfurther introduce a more efficient variant, HAAD-KV, that constructs\nperturbations solely based on the KV parameters of the h-space. This strategy\noffers a stronger protection, that is computationally less expensive. Despite\ntheir simplicity, our methods outperform state-of-the-art adversarial attacks,\nhighlighting their effectiveness."

Timing delays from selective powering down of\nAMX components mean that each matrix multiplication is a potential leakage\npoint when executed on the AMX accelerator. Our research identifies over a\ndozen potential gadgets across popular ML libraries (HuggingFace, PyTorch,\nTensorFlow, etc.), revealing that they can leak sensitive and private\ninformation. GATEBLEED poses a risk for local and remote timing inference, even\nunder previous protective measures. GATEBLEED can be used as a high\nperformance, stealthy remote covert channel and a generic magnifier for timing\ntransmission channels, capable of bypassing traditional cache defenses to leak\narbitrary memory addresses and evading state of the art microarchitectural\nattack detectors under realistic network conditions and system configurations\nin which previous attacks fail.

In the scope of in-context learning\n(ICL), this translates into using hundreds/thousands of demonstrations in the\ninput prompt, enabling many-shot ICL. In practice, a fixed set of\ndemonstrations is often selected at random in many-shot settings due to (1)\nhigh inference costs, (2) the benefits of caching and reusing computations, and\n(3) the similar performance offered by this strategy compared to others when\nscaled. In this work, we propose two straightforward strategies for\ndemonstration selection in many-shot ICL that improve performance with minimal\ncomputational overhead. Our first method combines a small number of\ndemonstrations, selected based on their similarity to each test sample, with a\ndisproportionately larger set of random demonstrations that are cached. The\nsecond strategy improves the first by replacing random demonstrations with\nthose selected using centroids derived from test sample representations via\nk-means clustering. Our experiments with Gemini Pro and Flash across several\ndatasets indicate that our strategies consistently outperform random selection\nand surpass or match the most performant selection approach while supporting\ncaching and reducing inference cost by up to an order of magnitude. We also\nshow that adjusting the proportion of demonstrations selected based on\ndifferent criteria can balance performance and inference cost in many-shot ICL.",

In the scope of in-context learning\n(ICL), this translates into using hundreds/thousands of demonstrations in the\ninput prompt, enabling many-shot ICL. In practice, a fixed set of\ndemonstrations is often selected at random in many-shot settings due to (1)\nhigh inference costs, (2) the benefits of caching and reusing computations, and\n(3) the similar performance offered by this strategy compared to others when\nscaled. In this work, we propose two straightforward strategies for\ndemonstration selection in many-shot ICL that improve performance with minimal\ncomputational overhead. Our first method combines a small number of\ndemonstrations, selected based on their similarity to each test sample, with a\ndisproportionately larger set of random demonstrations that are cached. The\nsecond strategy improves the first by replacing random demonstrations with\nthose selected using centroids derived from test sample representations via\nk-means clustering. Our experiments with Gemini Pro and Flash across several\ndatasets indicate that our strategies consistently outperform random selection\nand surpass or match the most performant selection approach while supporting\ncaching and reducing inference cost by up to an order of magnitude. We also\nshow that adjusting the proportion of demonstrations selected based on\ndifferent criteria can balance performance and inference cost in many-shot ICL."

Lizard addresses these limitations by introducing a subquadratic\nattention mechanism that closely approximates softmax attention while\npreserving the output quality. Unlike previous linearization methods, which are\noften limited by fixed model structures and therefore exclude gating\nmechanisms, Lizard incorporates a gating module inspired by recent\nstate-of-the-art linear models. This enables adaptive memory control, supports\nconstant-memory inference, offers strong length generalization, and allows more\nflexible model design. Lizard combines gated linear attention for global\ncontext compression with sliding window attention enhanced by meta memory,\nforming a hybrid mechanism that captures both long-range dependencies and\nfine-grained local interactions. Moreover, we introduce a hardware-aware\nalgorithm that accelerates the training speed of our models. Extensive\nexperiments show that Lizard achieves near-lossless recovery of the teacher\nmodel's performance across standard language modeling tasks, while\nsignificantly outperforming previous linearization methods. On the 5-shot MMLU\nbenchmark, Lizard improves over prior models by 18 points and shows significant\nimprovements on associative recall tasks.",

Unlike previous linearization methods, which are\noften limited by fixed model structures and therefore exclude gating\nmechanisms, Lizard incorporates a gating module inspired by recent\nstate-of-the-art linear models. This enables adaptive memory control, supports\nconstant-memory inference, offers strong length generalization, and allows more\nflexible model design. Lizard combines gated linear attention for global\ncontext compression with sliding window attention enhanced by meta memory,\nforming a hybrid mechanism that captures both long-range dependencies and\nfine-grained local interactions. Moreover, we introduce a hardware-aware\nalgorithm that accelerates the training speed of our models. Extensive\nexperiments show that Lizard achieves near-lossless recovery of the teacher\nmodel's performance across standard language modeling tasks, while\nsignificantly outperforming previous linearization methods. On the 5-shot MMLU\nbenchmark, Lizard improves over prior models by 18 points and shows significant\nimprovements on associative recall tasks."

However, the LLMs still need to encode the entire context for\neach query, leading to redundant computation. In this paper, we investigate a\nnew strategy to eliminate such inefficiency, where the KV cache of each\ndocument is precomputed independently. During inference, the KV caches of\nretrieved documents are concatenated, allowing the model to reuse cached\nrepresentations instead of recomputing them. To mitigate the performance\ndegradation when using KV caches computed independently for each document,\nKVLink introduces two key techniques: adjusting positional embeddings of the KV\ncache at inference to match the global position after concatenation, and using\ntrainable special tokens to restore self-attention across independently encoded\ndocuments. Experiments across 7 datasets demonstrate that KVLink improves\nquestion answering accuracy by an average of 4% over state-of-the-art methods.\nFurthermore, by leveraging precomputed KV caches, our approach reduces\ntime-to-first-token by up to 96% compared to standard LLM inference, making it\na scalable and efficient solution for context reuse. Additionally, KVLink can\nbe combined with KV cache compression to further save cache loading and storage\noverhead while outperforming the baselines.",

To further\nenhance its capabilities, we developed a sequencing adapter using Quantized\nLow-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA), which aligns LLMs with group POI recommendation\ntasks. To address the issue of sparse group check-in data, LLMGPR employs an\naggregation adapter that integrates individual representations into meaningful\ngroup representations. Additionally, a self-supervised learning (SSL) task is\ndesigned to predict the purposes of check-in sequences (e.g., business trips\nand family vacations), thereby enriching group representations with deeper\nsemantic insights. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of\nLLMGPR, showcasing its ability to significantly enhance the accuracy and\nrobustness of group POI recommendations.",

To address the issue of sparse group check-in data, LLMGPR employs an\naggregation adapter that integrates individual representations into meaningful\ngroup representations. Additionally, a self-supervised learning (SSL) task is\ndesigned to predict the purposes of check-in sequences (e.g., business trips\nand family vacations), thereby enriching group representations with deeper\nsemantic insights. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of\nLLMGPR, showcasing its ability to significantly enhance the accuracy and\nrobustness of group POI recommendations."

The water production rate results highly depend on the\nreddening assumption. For a reddening of 38.6\\% between 5437.8~\\AA\\ and\n3325.7~\\AA, the water production rate is $(1.35 \\pm 0.27) \\times 10^{27} $\nmolecules\\,s$^{-1}$ (40~kg\\,s$^{-1}$) at a heliocentric distance of 3.51~au.\nThis places 3I/ATLAS among the few comets with confirmed OH emission beyond\n3~au, where water ice sublimation is typically inefficient. The inferred\nproduction rate is consistent with an active area of at least 19~km$^2$,\nassuming equilibrium sublimation. Based on current upper limits of the nucleus'\nradius, this requires that over 20\\% of the surface is active, which is larger\nthan activity levels observed in most solar system comets. Contemporaneous\nnear-infrared spectroscopy indicates the presence of large icy grains in the\ncoma, which may serve as an extended source of water vapor. The detection of OH\nemission prior to any CN detection is unusual and may reflect differences in\ngrain-driven outgassing or volatile inventory compared to typical comets. While\nsimilar behavior has been observed in solar system comets, the mechanisms\ncontrolling distant activity and the storage and release of volatiles remain\npoorly understood. If 3I/ATLAS' coma continues to be dominated by H$_2$O,\nsupporting the early and low-metallicity formation hypothesis, the derived\nlarge size of the nucleus could be indicative of a key knowledge gap in\nlow-metallicity system planetesimal formation and loss mechanisms.",

In this paper, we present\nHierarchicalPrune, a novel compression framework grounded in a key observation:\nDM blocks exhibit distinct functional hierarchies, where early blocks establish\nsemantic structures while later blocks handle texture refinements.\nHierarchicalPrune synergistically combines three techniques: (1) Hierarchical\nPosition Pruning, which identifies and removes less essential later blocks\nbased on position hierarchy; (2) Positional Weight Preservation, which\nsystematically protects early model portions that are essential for semantic\nstructural integrity; and (3) Sensitivity-Guided Distillation, which adjusts\nknowledge-transfer intensity based on our discovery of block-wise sensitivity\nvariations. As a result, our framework brings billion-scale diffusion models\ninto a range more suitable for on-device inference, while preserving the\nquality of the output images. Specifically, when combined with INT4 weight\nquantisation, HierarchicalPrune achieves 77.5-80.4% memory footprint reduction\n(e.g., from 15.8 GB to 3.2 GB) and 27.9-38.0% latency reduction, measured on\nserver and consumer grade GPUs, with the minimum drop of 2.6% in GenEval score\nand 7% in HPSv2 score compared to the original model.

We formulate a \"Langevin equation\" for\njump processes, define general path-wise observables, and establish their\ncovariation structure, whereby we fully account for transients and\ntime-inhomogeneous dynamics. We prove the known kinds of thermodynamic\ninequalities in their most general form and discus saturation conditions. We\ndetermine the response of path-wise observables to general (incl. thermal)\nperturbations and carry out the continuum limit to achieve the complete\nunification of diffusion and jump dynamics. Our results open new avenues in the\ndirection of discrete-state analogs of generative diffusion models and the\nlearning of stochastic thermodynamics from fluctuating trajectories."

To address the\nchallenges of training and inference stability as well as limited training\ndata, we adapt the MoD module with two novel designs: tanh-gated weight\nnormalization (TanhNorm) and symmetric token reweighting (STRing). Moreover, we\nobserve that vision tokens exhibit higher redundancy in deeper layers and thus\ndesign a progressive ratio decay (PRD) strategy, which gradually reduces the\ntoken retention ratio layer by layer, employing a shifted cosine schedule.

Critically, RLVR can lead to the\ncapability boundary collapse, narrowing the LLM's problem-solving scope. To\naddress this problem, we propose RL-PLUS, a novel hybrid-policy optimization\napproach for LLMs that synergizes internal exploitation with external data to\nachieve stronger reasoning capabilities and surpass the boundaries of base\nmodels. RL-PLUS integrates two core components, i.e., Multiple Importance\nSampling to address distributional mismatch from external data, and\nExploration-Based Advantage Function to guide the model towards high-value,\nunexplored reasoning paths. We provide both theoretical analysis and extensive\nexperiments to demonstrate the superiority and generalizability of our\napproach. Compared with existing RLVR methods, RL-PLUS achieves 1)\nstate-of-the-art performance on six math reasoning benchmarks; 2) superior\nperformance on six out-of-distribution reasoning tasks; 3) consistent and\nsignificant gains across diverse model families, with average relative\nimprovements up to 69.2\\%. Moreover, the analysis of Pass@k curves indicates\nthat RL-PLUS effectively resolves the capability boundary collapse problem.",

                    "value": "Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) has significantly\nadvanced the complex reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs).\nHowever, it struggles to break through the inherent capability boundaries of\nthe base LLM, due to its essentially on-policy strategy coupled with LLM's\nimmense action space and sparse reward. Critically, RLVR can lead to the\ncapability boundary collapse, narrowing the LLM's problem-solving scope. To\naddress this problem, we propose RL-PLUS, a novel hybrid-policy optimization\napproach for LLMs that synergizes internal exploitation with external data to\nachieve stronger reasoning capabilities and surpass the boundaries of base\nmodels. RL-PLUS integrates two core components, i.e., Multiple Importance\nSampling to address distributional mismatch from external data, and\nExploration-Based Advantage Function to guide the model towards high-value,\nunexplored reasoning paths. We provide both theoretical analysis and extensive\nexperiments to demonstrate the superiority and generalizability of our\napproach. Compared with existing RLVR methods, RL-PLUS achieves 1)\nstate-of-the-art performance on six math reasoning benchmarks; 2) superior\nperformance on six out-of-distribution reasoning tasks; 3) consistent and\nsignificant gains across diverse model families, with average relative\nimprovements up to 69.2\\%. Moreover, the analysis of Pass@k curves indicates\nthat RL-PLUS effectively resolves the capability boundary collapse problem."

Inspired by\ndictionary learning in CNNs, we propose a framework for structured weight\nsharing across transformer layers. Our approach decomposes attention projection\nmatrices into shared dictionary atoms, reducing the attention module's\nparameters by 66.7% while achieving on-par performance. Unlike complex methods\nrequiring distillation or architectural changes, MASA (Matrix Atom Sharing in\nAttention) operates as a drop-in replacement - trained with standard optimizers\n- and represents each layer's weights as linear combinations of shared matrix\natoms. Experiments across scales (100M-700M parameters) show that MASA achieves\nbetter benchmark accuracy and perplexity than grouped-query attention (GQA),\nlow-rank baselines and recently proposed Repeat-all-over/Sequential sharing at\ncomparable parameter budgets. Ablation studies confirm robustness to the\ndictionary size and the efficacy of shared representations in capturing\ncross-layer statistical regularities. Extending to Vision Transformers (ViT),\nMASA matches performance metrics on image classification and detection tasks\nwith 66.7% fewer attention parameters. By combining dictionary learning\nstrategies with transformer efficiency, MASA offers a scalable blueprint for\nparameter-efficient models without sacrificing performance. Finally, we\ninvestigate the possibility of employing MASA on pretrained LLMs to reduce\ntheir number of parameters without experiencing any significant drop in their\nperformance.",

Inspired by\ndictionary learning in CNNs, we propose a framework for structured weight\nsharing across transformer layers. Our approach decomposes attention projection\nmatrices into shared dictionary atoms, reducing the attention module's\nparameters by 66.7% while achieving on-par performance. Unlike complex methods\nrequiring distillation or architectural changes, MASA (Matrix Atom Sharing in\nAttention) operates as a drop-in replacement - trained with standard optimizers\n- and represents each layer's weights as linear combinations of shared matrix\natoms. Experiments across scales (100M-700M parameters) show that MASA achieves\nbetter benchmark accuracy and perplexity than grouped-query attention (GQA),\nlow-rank baselines and recently proposed Repeat-all-over/Sequential sharing at\ncomparable parameter budgets. Ablation studies confirm robustness to the\ndictionary size and the efficacy of shared representations in capturing\ncross-layer statistical regularities. Extending to Vision Transformers (ViT),\nMASA matches performance metrics on image classification and detection tasks\nwith 66.7% fewer attention parameters. By combining dictionary learning\nstrategies with transformer efficiency, MASA offers a scalable blueprint for\nparameter-efficient models without sacrificing performance. Finally, we\ninvestigate the possibility of employing MASA on pretrained LLMs to reduce\ntheir number of parameters without experiencing any significant drop in their\nperformance."

However, these systems introduce unprecedented security\nvulnerabilities that extend beyond traditional content generation attacks to\nsystem-level compromise. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of the\nsecurity of LLMs used as reasoning engines within autonomous agents,\nhighlighting how they can be exploited as attack vectors capable of achieving\ncomplete computer takeover. We focus on how different attack surfaces and trust\nboundaries - Direct Prompt Injection, RAG Backdoor, and Inter Agent Trust - can\nbe leveraged to orchestrate such takeovers. We demonstrate that adversaries can\neffectively coerce popular LLMs (including GPT-4, Claude-4 and Gemini-2.5) into\nautonomously installing and executing malware on victim machines. Our\nevaluation of 18 state-of-the-art LLMs reveals an alarming scenario: 94.4% of\nmodels succumb to Direct Prompt Injection and 83.3% are vulnerable to the more\nstealth and evasive RAG Backdoor Attack. Notably, we tested trust boundaries\nwithin multi-agent systems, where LLM agents interact and influence each other,\nand we revealed a critical security flaw: LLMs which successfully resist direct\ninjection or RAG backdoor will execute identical payloads when requested by\npeer agents. Our findings show that 100.0% of tested LLMs can be compromised\nthrough Inter-Agent Trust Exploitation attacks and that every model exhibits\ncontext-dependent security behaviors that create exploitable blind spots. Our\nresults also highlight the need to increase awareness and research on the\nsecurity risks of LLMs, showing a paradigm shift in cybersecurity threats,\nwhere AI tools themselves become sophisticated attack vectors.",

We focus on how different attack surfaces and trust\nboundaries - Direct Prompt Injection, RAG Backdoor, and Inter Agent Trust - can\nbe leveraged to orchestrate such takeovers. We demonstrate that adversaries can\neffectively coerce popular LLMs (including GPT-4, Claude-4 and Gemini-2.5) into\nautonomously installing and executing malware on victim machines. Our\nevaluation of 18 state-of-the-art LLMs reveals an alarming scenario: 94.4% of\nmodels succumb to Direct Prompt Injection and 83.3% are vulnerable to the more\nstealth and evasive RAG Backdoor Attack. Notably, we tested trust boundaries\nwithin multi-agent systems, where LLM agents interact and influence each other,\nand we revealed a critical security flaw: LLMs which successfully resist direct\ninjection or RAG backdoor will execute identical payloads when requested by\npeer agents. Our findings show that 100.0% of tested LLMs can be compromised\nthrough Inter-Agent Trust Exploitation attacks and that every model exhibits\ncontext-dependent security behaviors that create exploitable blind spots. Our\nresults also highlight the need to increase awareness and research on the\nsecurity risks of LLMs, showing a paradigm shift in cybersecurity threats,\nwhere AI tools themselves become sophisticated attack vectors."

We first propose a formal\ndefinition of knowledge, quantifying it for a given question as the fraction of\ncorrect-incorrect answer pairs where the correct one is ranked higher. This\ngives rise to external and internal knowledge, depending on the information\nused to score individual answer candidates: either the model's observable\ntoken-level probabilities or its intermediate computations. Hidden knowledge\narises when internal knowledge exceeds external knowledge. We then present a\ncase study, applying this framework to three popular open-weights LLMs in a\nclosed-book QA setup. Our results indicate that: (1) LLMs consistently encode\nmore factual knowledge internally than what they express externally, with an\naverage relative gap of 40%. (2) Surprisingly, some knowledge is so deeply\nhidden that a model can internally know an answer perfectly, yet fail to\ngenerate it even once, despite large-scale repeated sampling of 1,000 answers.\nThis reveals fundamental limitations in the generation capabilities of LLMs,\nwhich (3) put a practical constraint on scaling test-time compute via repeated\nanswer sampling in closed-book QA: significant performance improvements remain\ninaccessible because some answers are practically never sampled, yet if they\nwere, we would be guaranteed to rank them first.",

However, such data are scarce due to privacy concerns in\nrecording and the vulnerability inherent in help-seeking. We present\nSimInstruct, a scalable, expert-in-the-loop tool for collecting scaffolding\ndialogues. Using teaching development coaching as an example domain,\nSimInstruct simulates novice instructors via LLMs, varying their teaching\nchallenges and LLM's persona traits, while human experts provide multi-turn\nfeedback, reasoning, and instructional support. This design enables the\ncreation of realistic, pedagogically rich dialogues without requiring real\nnovice participants. Our results reveal that persona traits, such as\nextroversion and introversion, meaningfully influence how experts engage.\nCompared to real mentoring recordings, SimInstruct dialogues demonstrate\ncomparable pedagogical relevance and cognitive depth. Experts also reported the\nprocess as engaging and reflective, improving both data quality and their own\nprofessional insight. We further fine-tuned a LLaMA model to be an expert model\nusing the augmented dataset, which outperformed GPT-4o in instructional\nquality. Our analysis highlights GPT-4o's limitations in weak reflective\nquestioning, overuse of generic praise, a condescending tone, and a tendency to\noverwhelm novices with excessive suggestions.",

Dense radio antenna arrays such as the LOw\nFrequency ARray (LOFAR) telescope as well as the upcoming Square Kilometre\nArray Observatory (SKAO) are ideal instruments to explore the potential of air\nshower profile reconstruction, as their high antenna density allows cosmic ray\nobservations with unprecedented accuracy.

As such, it is ever more\ncrucial to develop new analysis approaches that can perform a full air shower\nprofile reconstruction efficiently.\n  In this work, we develop a novel framework to reconstruct the longitudinal\nprofile of air showers using measurements from radio detectors with Information\nField Theory (IFT), a state-of-the-art reconstruction framework based on\nBayesian inference. Through IFT, we are able to exploit all available\ninformation in the signal (amplitude, phase, and pulse shape) at each antenna\nposition simultaneously and explicitly utilise models that are motivated\nthrough our current understanding of air shower physics.

Furthermore, to ensure temporal consistency and\naccelerated inference in extended generation, we propose a novel asynchronous\nnoise scheduler (ANS) for both the training and inference process of our\nframework. The ANS leverages asynchronous add-noise and asynchronous\nmotion-guided generation in the latent space, ensuring consistency in generated\nvideo clips.

Recent LLMs show impressive performance\non SWE-Bench, leading to optimism about their capacity for complex coding\ntasks. However, current evaluation protocols may overstate these models' true\ncapabilities. It is crucial to distinguish LLMs' generalizable problem-solving\nability and other learned artifacts. In this work, we introduce two diagnostic\ntasks: file path identification from issue descriptions alone and ground truth\nfunction reproduction with only the current file context and issue description\nto probe models' underlying knowledge. We present empirical evidence that\nperformance gains on SWE-Bench-Verified may be partially driven by memorization\nrather than genuine problem-solving. We show that state-of-the-art models\nachieve up to 76% accuracy in identifying buggy file paths using only issue\ndescriptions, without access to repository structure. This performance is\nmerely up to 53% on tasks from repositories not included in SWE-Bench, pointing\nto possible data contamination or memorization. Similar patterns are also\nobserved for the function reproduction task, where the verbatim similarity is\nmuch higher on SWE-Bench Verified than on other similar coding benchmarks (up\nto 35% consecutive 5-gram accuracy on SWE-Bench Verified and Full, but only up\nto 18% for tasks in other benchmarks). These findings raise concerns about the\nvalidity of existing results and underscore the need for more robust,\ncontamination-resistant benchmarks to reliably evaluate LLMs' coding abilities.",

                    "value": "As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly capable and widely\nadopted, benchmarks play a central role in assessing their practical utility.\nFor example, SWE-Bench Verified has emerged as a critical benchmark for\nevaluating LLMs' software engineering abilities, particularly their aptitude\nfor resolving real-world GitHub issues. Recent LLMs show impressive performance\non SWE-Bench, leading to optimism about their capacity for complex coding\ntasks. However, current evaluation protocols may overstate these models' true\ncapabilities. It is crucial to distinguish LLMs' generalizable problem-solving\nability and other learned artifacts. In this work, we introduce two diagnostic\ntasks: file path identification from issue descriptions alone and ground truth\nfunction reproduction with only the current file context and issue description\nto probe models' underlying knowledge. We present empirical evidence that\nperformance gains on SWE-Bench-Verified may be partially driven by memorization\nrather than genuine problem-solving. We show that state-of-the-art models\nachieve up to 76% accuracy in identifying buggy file paths using only issue\ndescriptions, without access to repository structure. This performance is\nmerely up to 53% on tasks from repositories not included in SWE-Bench, pointing\nto possible data contamination or memorization. Similar patterns are also\nobserved for the function reproduction task, where the verbatim similarity is\nmuch higher on SWE-Bench Verified than on other similar coding benchmarks (up\nto 35% consecutive 5-gram accuracy on SWE-Bench Verified and Full, but only up\nto 18% for tasks in other benchmarks). These findings raise concerns about the\nvalidity of existing results and underscore the need for more robust,\ncontamination-resistant benchmarks to reliably evaluate LLMs' coding abilities."

Extensive evaluation using realistic 5G scenarios demonstrates that\nthe edge framework achieves zero network outages under high-stress conditions,\ncompared to 8.4% for traditional fixed-power networks and 3.3% for large\nlanguage model (LLM) agent-based approaches, while maintaining near real-time\nresponsiveness and consistent QoS.

Specifically, we integrate features from Multi-View Stereo (MVS) and\nMonocular Depth Estimation (MDE) to enhance feature representations for\ngeneralizable reconstruction. Next, We propose a projection-and-sampling\nmechanism for deep depth fusion, which constructs a fine probability volume to\nguide the regression of the feature map. Furthermore, We introduce a\nreference-view loss to improve geometry and optimization efficiency. We\nleverage 3D Gaussian representations to accelerate training and inference time\nwhile enhancing rendering quality. MuRF achieves state-of-the-art performance\nacross multiple baseline settings and diverse scenarios ranging from simple\nobjects (DTU) to complex indoor and outdoor scenes (RealEstate10K).

Specifically, we integrate features from Multi-View Stereo (MVS) and\nMonocular Depth Estimation (MDE) to enhance feature representations for\ngeneralizable reconstruction. Next, We propose a projection-and-sampling\nmechanism for deep depth fusion, which constructs a fine probability volume to\nguide the regression of the feature map. Furthermore, We introduce a\nreference-view loss to improve geometry and optimization efficiency. We\nleverage 3D Gaussian representations to accelerate training and inference time\nwhile enhancing rendering quality. MuRF achieves state-of-the-art performance\nacross multiple baseline settings and diverse scenarios ranging from simple\nobjects (DTU) to complex indoor and outdoor scenes (RealEstate10K). We also\ndemonstrate promising zero-shot performance on the LLFF and Mip-NeRF 360\ndatasets."

In this paper, we propose EvoC2Rust, an automated\nframework for converting entire C projects to equivalent Rust ones. EvoC2Rust\nemploys a skeleton-guided translation strategy for project-level translation.\nThe pipeline consists of three evolutionary stages: 1) it first decomposes the\nC project into functional modules, employs a feature-mapping-enhanced LLM to\ntransform definitions and macros and generates type-checked function stubs,\nwhich form a compilable Rust skeleton; 2) it then incrementally translates the\nfunction, replacing the corresponding stub placeholder; 3) finally, it repairs\ncompilation errors by integrating LLM and static analysis.

In parallel, AI hardware is\nscaling up, with Huawei's CloudMatrix384 SuperPod offering hundreds of GB/s\nhigh-speed interconnects. Running large MoE models on SuperPod-scale hardware\nbrings new challenges. It requires new execution models, scalable scheduling,\nefficient expert load balancing, and elimination of single points of failure.\nThis paper presents xDeepServe, Huawei Cloud's LLM serving system designed for\nSuperPod-scale infrastructure. At its core is Transformerless, a disaggregated\narchitecture that decomposes transformer models into modular units--attention,\nfeedforward, and MoE--executed independently on NPUs connected via high-speed\nfabric. We implement this design in two forms: disaggregated prefill-decode and\ndisaggregated MoE-attention. This fully disaggregated setup enables independent\nscaling of compute and memory without sacrificing performance. To support this\narchitecture, we propose XCCL, a communication library that leverages\nCloudMatrix384's global shared memory to implement efficient point-to-point and\nall-to-all primitives.

In this paper, we propose p-MoD, an efficient MLLM\narchitecture that significantly reduces training and inference costs while\nmaintaining model performance. The majority of computation in MLLMs stems from\nthe overwhelming volume of vision tokens processed by the transformer-based\nLLM. Accordingly, we leverage the Mixture-of-Depths (MoD) mechanism, where each\nLLM layer selects essential vision tokens to process while skipping redundant\nones. However, integrating MoD into MLLMs is non-trivial. To address the\nchallenges of training and inference stability as well as limited training\ndata, we adapt the MoD module with two novel designs: tanh-gated weight\nnormalization (TanhNorm) and symmetric token reweighting (STRing). Moreover, we\nobserve that vision tokens exhibit higher redundancy in deeper layers and thus\ndesign a progressive ratio decay (PRD) strategy, which gradually reduces the\ntoken retention ratio layer by layer, employing a shifted cosine schedule. This\ncrucial design fully unleashes the potential of MoD, significantly boosting the\nefficiency and performance of our models. Extensive experiments on two baseline\nmodels across 15 benchmarks show that our model matches or even surpasses the\nperformance of corresponding baselines, while requiring only 55.6% TFLOPs and\n53.7% KV cache storage during inference, and 77.7% GPU hours during training.",

To\naddress this problem, we propose RL-PLUS, a novel hybrid-policy optimization\napproach for LLMs that synergizes internal exploitation with external data to\nachieve stronger reasoning capabilities and surpass the boundaries of base\nmodels.

We provide both theoretical analysis and extensive\nexperiments to demonstrate the superiority and generalizability of our\napproach. Compared with existing RLVR methods, RL-PLUS achieves 1)\nstate-of-the-art performance on six math reasoning benchmarks; 2) superior\nperformance on six out-of-distribution reasoning tasks; 3) consistent and\nsignificant gains across diverse model families, with average relative\nimprovements up to 69.2\\%.

Traditional RAG approaches struggle with real-time\nneeds and structured queries that require accessing dynamically generated\ncontent like ticket availability or inventory. Limited to indexing static\npages, search engines cannot perform the interactive queries needed for such\ntime-sensitive data. Academic research has focused on optimizing RAG for static\ncontent, overlooking complex intents and the need for dynamic sources like\ndatabases and real-time APIs. To bridge this gap, we introduce TURA\n(Tool-Augmented Unified Retrieval Agent for AI Search), a novel three-stage\nframework that combines RAG with agentic tool-use to access both static content\nand dynamic, real-time information. TURA has three key components: an\nIntent-Aware Retrieval module to decompose queries and retrieve information\nsources encapsulated as Model Context Protocol (MCP) Servers, a DAG-based Task\nPlanner that models task dependencies as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) for\noptimal parallel execution, and a lightweight Distilled Agent Executor for\nefficient tool calling. TURA is the first architecture to systematically bridge\nthe gap between static RAG and dynamic information sources for a world-class AI\nsearch product.

To address this, we\nleverage the idea of embodied AI agents-virtual agents that perceive and act\nwithin simulated environments guided by internal world models. We introduce\nAgentSense, a virtual data generation pipeline in which agents live out daily\nroutines in simulated smart homes, with behavior guided by Large Language\nModels (LLMs). The LLM generates diverse synthetic personas and realistic\nroutines grounded in the environment, which are then decomposed into\nfine-grained actions. These actions are executed in an extended version of the\nVirtualHome simulator, which we augment with virtual ambient sensors that\nrecord the agents' activities. Our approach produces rich, privacy-preserving\nsensor data that reflects real-world diversity. We evaluate AgentSense on five\nreal HAR datasets. Models pretrained on the generated data consistently\noutperform baselines, especially in low-resource settings. Furthermore,\ncombining the generated virtual sensor data with a small amount of real data\nachieves performance comparable to training on full real-world datasets.

We then explore whether LLMs can perform\npsychiatric reasoning like clinicians and identify their clear limitations in\nrealistic clinical settings. In response, we propose to guide the reasoning\nprocess with clinical expertise and consistently improves LLM diagnostic\nperformance by up to 10% in Macro-F1 score.

While a few studies hint at this possibility, none has\nclearly defined or demonstrated this phenomenon. We first propose a formal\ndefinition of knowledge, quantifying it for a given question as the fraction of\ncorrect-incorrect answer pairs where the correct one is ranked higher. This\ngives rise to external and internal knowledge, depending on the information\nused to score individual answer candidates: either the model's observable\ntoken-level probabilities or its intermediate computations. Hidden knowledge\narises when internal knowledge exceeds external knowledge. We then present a\ncase study, applying this framework to three popular open-weights LLMs in a\nclosed-book QA setup. Our results indicate that: (1) LLMs consistently encode\nmore factual knowledge internally than what they express externally, with an\naverage relative gap of 40%.

While a few studies hint at this possibility, none has\nclearly defined or demonstrated this phenomenon. We first propose a formal\ndefinition of knowledge, quantifying it for a given question as the fraction of\ncorrect-incorrect answer pairs where the correct one is ranked higher. This\ngives rise to external and internal knowledge, depending on the information\nused to score individual answer candidates: either the model's observable\ntoken-level probabilities or its intermediate computations. Hidden knowledge\narises when internal knowledge exceeds external knowledge. We then present a\ncase study, applying this framework to three popular open-weights LLMs in a\nclosed-book QA setup. Our results indicate that: (1) LLMs consistently encode\nmore factual knowledge internally than what they express externally, with an\naverage relative gap of 40%. (2) Surprisingly, some knowledge is so deeply\nhidden that a model can internally know an answer perfectly, yet fail to\ngenerate it even once, despite large-scale repeated sampling of 1,000 answers.\nThis reveals fundamental limitations in the generation capabilities of LLMs,\nwhich (3) put a practical constraint on scaling test-time compute via repeated\nanswer sampling in closed-book QA: significant performance improvements remain\ninaccessible because some answers are practically never sampled, yet if they\nwere, we would be guaranteed to rank them first."

                "summary": "The success of foundation AI has motivated the research of circuit foundation\nmodels, which are customized to assist the integrated circuit (IC) design\nprocess. However, existing pre-trained circuit foundation models are typically\nlimited to standalone encoders for predictive tasks or decoders for generative\ntasks. These two model types are developed independently, operate on different\ncircuit modalities, and reside in separate latent spaces. This restricts their\nability to complement each other for more advanced capabilities. In this work,\nwe present GenEDA, the first framework that cross-modally aligns circuit\nencoders with decoders within a shared latent space. GenEDA bridges the gap\nbetween graph-based circuit representation learning and text-based large\nlanguage models (LLMs), enabling communication between their respective latent\nspaces.

                    "value": "The success of foundation AI has motivated the research of circuit foundation\nmodels, which are customized to assist the integrated circuit (IC) design\nprocess. However, existing pre-trained circuit foundation models are typically\nlimited to standalone encoders for predictive tasks or decoders for generative\ntasks. These two model types are developed independently, operate on different\ncircuit modalities, and reside in separate latent spaces. This restricts their\nability to complement each other for more advanced capabilities. In this work,\nwe present GenEDA, the first framework that cross-modally aligns circuit\nencoders with decoders within a shared latent space. GenEDA bridges the gap\nbetween graph-based circuit representation learning and text-based large\nlanguage models (LLMs), enabling communication between their respective latent\nspaces.

Vast model input token size, however, disables\nreliable implementation with web agents to date.\n  We propose D2Snap, a first-of-its-kind DOM downsampling algorithm. Based on a\nGPT-4o backend, we evaluate D2Snap on tasks sampled from the Online-Mind2Web\ndataset. The success rate of D2Snap-downsampled DOM snapshots (67%) matches a\ngrounded GUI snapshot baseline (65%) $\\unicode{x2013}$ within the same input\ntoken order of magnitude (1e3). Our best evaluated configurations\n$\\unicode{x2013}$ one token order above, but within the model's context window\n$\\unicode{x2013}$ outperform this baseline by 8%. Our evaluation, moreover,\nyields that DOM-inherent hierarchy embodies a strong UI feature for LLMs."

Results highlight trade-offs between\naccuracy, efficiency, and data requirements, with fine-tuned transformer models\nbalancing precision and recall effectively on Kentucky data.

While\nvarious approaches have emerged for this task, they face inherent trade-offs:\nrule-based solutions face challenges in meeting code safety and idiomaticity\nrequirements, while LLM-based solutions often fail to generate semantically\nequivalent Rust code, due to the heavy dependencies of modules across the\nentire codebase. Recent studies have revealed that both solutions are limited\nto small-scale programs. In this paper, we propose EvoC2Rust, an automated\nframework for converting entire C projects to equivalent Rust ones. EvoC2Rust\nemploys a skeleton-guided translation strategy for project-level translation.\nThe pipeline consists of three evolutionary stages: 1) it first decomposes the\nC project into functional modules, employs a feature-mapping-enhanced LLM to\ntransform definitions and macros and generates type-checked function stubs,\nwhich form a compilable Rust skeleton; 2) it then incrementally translates the\nfunction, replacing the corresponding stub placeholder; 3) finally, it repairs\ncompilation errors by integrating LLM and static analysis. Through evolutionary\naugmentation, EvoC2Rust combines the advantages of both rule-based and\nLLM-based solutions. Our evaluation on open-source benchmarks and six\nindustrial projects demonstrates EvoC2Rust's superior performance in\nproject-level C-to-Rust translation. On average, it achieves 17.24% and 14.32%\nimprovements in syntax and semantic accuracy over the LLM-based approaches,\nalong with a 96.79% higher code safety rate than the rule-based tools. At the\nmodule level, EvoC2Rust reaches 92.25% compilation and 89.53% test pass rates\non industrial projects, even for complex codebases and long functions.",

We introduce an objective evaluation\nframework that compares model performance under both limited and cumulative\nexperience settings, and contains four forms of experience representation. To\nprovide a comparative baseline, we recruit eight human participants to complete\nthe same task. Results show that LLMs exhibit measurable test-time learning\ncapabilities; however, their improvements are less stable under cumulative\nexperience and progress more slowly than those observed in humans. These\nfindings underscore the potential of LLMs as general-purpose learning machines,\nwhile also revealing a substantial intellectual gap between models and humans,\nirrespective of how well LLMs perform on static benchmarks."
