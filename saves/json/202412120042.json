Notably, the MLLMs are constrained\nby their limited context lengths and the substantial costs while processing\nlong videos. Although several existing methods attempt to reduce visual tokens,\ntheir strategies encounter severe bottleneck, restricting MLLMs' ability to\nperceive fine-grained visual details. In this work, we propose Video-XL, a\nnovel approach that leverages MLLMs' inherent key-value (KV) sparsification\ncapacity to condense the visual input. Specifically, we introduce a new special\ntoken, the Visual Summarization Token (VST), for each interval of the video,\nwhich summarizes the visual information within the interval as its associated\nKV. The VST module is trained by instruction fine-tuning, where two optimizing\nstrategies are offered. 1.Curriculum learning, where VST learns to make small\n(easy) and large compression (hard) progressively. 2. Composite data curation,\nwhich integrates single-image, multi-image, and synthetic data to overcome the\nscarcity of long-video instruction data. The compression quality is further\nimproved by dynamic compression, which customizes compression granularity based\non the information density of different video intervals. Video-XL's\neffectiveness is verified from three aspects. First, it achieves a superior\nlong-video understanding capability, outperforming state-of-the-art models of\ncomparable sizes across multiple popular benchmarks. Second, it effectively\npreserves video information, with minimal compression loss even at 16x\ncompression ratio. Third, it realizes outstanding cost-effectiveness, enabling\nhigh-quality processing of thousands of frames on a single A100 GPU.",

Its cache entry identifies\na unique one-hop sub-query (key) and its result set consisting of immutable\nvertex ids (value). When processing a gR-Tx, the query processor identifies its\nsequence of individual one-hop sub-queries and looks up their results in the\ncache. A cache hit fetches less data from the storage manager and eliminates\nthe requirement to process the one-hop sub-query. A cache miss populates the\ncache asynchronously and in a transactional manner, maintaining the separation\nof read and write paths of our transactional storage manager. A graph read and\nwrite transaction, gRW-Tx, identifies the impacted cache entries and either\ndeletes or updates them. Our implementation of the cache is inside the graph\nquery processing engine and transparent to a user application. We evaluate the\ncache using our eCommerce production workload and with rules that re-write\ngraph queries to maximize the performance enhancements observed with the cache.\nObtained results show the cache enhances 95th and 99th percentile of query\nresponse times by at least 2x and 1.63x, respectively.

Existing methods\nfor vision-language models (VLMs) typically rely on self-attention scores from\nlarge language models (LLMs) to identify and prune irrelevant tokens. However,\nthese approaches overlook the inherent distributional discrepancies between\nmodalities, often leading to inaccurate token importance estimation and the\nover-pruning of critical visual tokens. To address this, we propose decomposing\nattention scores into intra-modality attention (within the same modality) and\ninter-modality attention (across modalities), enabling more precise KV cache\npruning by independently managing these distinct attention types. Additionally,\nwe introduce an n-softmax function to counteract distribution shifts caused by\npruning, preserving the original smoothness of attention scores and ensuring\nstable performance. Our final training-free method,\n\\textbf{C}ross-\\textbf{S}elf \\textbf{P}runing (CSP), achieves competitive\nperformance compared to models with full KV caches while significantly\noutperforming previous pruning methods. Extensive evaluations on MileBench, a\nbenchmark encompassing 29 multimodal datasets, demonstrate CSP's effectiveness,\nachieving up to a 41\\% performance improvement on challenging tasks like\nconversational embodied dialogue while reducing the KV cache budget by 13.6\\%.\nThe code is available at https://github.com/TerryPei/CSP",

To address this, two critical steps are often required: a\npretrained LLM typically undergoes a separate stage for context length\nextension by training on long-context data, followed by architectural\nmodifications to reduce the overhead of KV cache during serving. This paper\nargues that integrating length extension with a GPU-friendly KV cache reduction\narchitecture not only reduces training overhead during length extension, but\nalso achieves better long-context performance. This leads to our proposed\nLongGen, which finetunes a pretrained LLM into an efficient architecture during\nlength extension. LongGen builds on three key insights: (1) Sparse attention\npatterns, such as window attention (attending to recent tokens), attention sink\n(initial ones), and blockwise sparse attention (strided token blocks) are\nwell-suited for building efficient long-context models, primarily due to their\nGPU-friendly memory access patterns, enabling efficiency gains not just\ntheoretically but in practice as well. (2) It is essential for the model to\nhave direct access to all tokens. A hybrid architecture with 1/3 full attention\nlayers and 2/3 efficient ones achieves a balanced trade-off between efficiency\nand long-context performance. (3) Lightweight training on 5B long-context data\nis sufficient to extend the hybrid model's context length from 4K to 128K.\n  We evaluate LongGen on both Llama-2 7B and Llama-2 70B, demonstrating its\neffectiveness across different scales. During training with 128K-long contexts,\nLongGen achieves 1.55x training speedup and reduces wall-clock time by 36%,\ncompared to a full-attention baseline. During inference, LongGen reduces KV\ncache memory by 62%, achieving 1.67x prefilling speedup and 1.41x decoding\nspeedup.",

LongGen builds on three key insights: (1) Sparse attention\npatterns, such as window attention (attending to recent tokens), attention sink\n(initial ones), and blockwise sparse attention (strided token blocks) are\nwell-suited for building efficient long-context models, primarily due to their\nGPU-friendly memory access patterns, enabling efficiency gains not just\ntheoretically but in practice as well. (2) It is essential for the model to\nhave direct access to all tokens. A hybrid architecture with 1/3 full attention\nlayers and 2/3 efficient ones achieves a balanced trade-off between efficiency\nand long-context performance. (3) Lightweight training on 5B long-context data\nis sufficient to extend the hybrid model's context length from 4K to 128K.\n  We evaluate LongGen on both Llama-2 7B and Llama-2 70B, demonstrating its\neffectiveness across different scales. During training with 128K-long contexts,\nLongGen achieves 1.55x training speedup and reduces wall-clock time by 36%,\ncompared to a full-attention baseline. During inference, LongGen reduces KV\ncache memory by 62%, achieving 1.67x prefilling speedup and 1.41x decoding\nspeedup."

To address these challenges, we introduce LeanKV, a unified KV cache\ncompression framework that enhances LLM serving efficiency without compromising\naccuracy through three innovations: (1) Hetero-KV quantization, which stores\nkeys at a higher precision than values to reflect their greater impact on\nattention computations; (2) per-head dynamic sparsity, which allocates memory\nbased on token importance per head and per request; and (3) unified KV\ncompression, integrating mixed-precision quantization and selective pruning to\nenable a smooth tradeoff between model accuracy and memory efficiency. To\nefficiently support these techniques, LeanKV introduces systems optimizations\nincluding unified paging and on-GPU parallel memory management. Implemented on\nvLLM, LeanKV compresses the KV cache by $3.0\\times$ to $5.0\\times$ without\naccuracy loss and up to $11.0\\times$ with under 5% accuracy loss, enhancing\nthroughput by $1.9\\times$ to $2.5\\times$, and up to $6.9\\times$.",

However, stacking multiple\nattention layers leads to attention concentration. One natural way to address\nthis issue is to use cross-layer attention, allowing information from earlier\nlayers to be directly accessible to later layers. However, this approach is\ncomputationally expensive. To address this problem, we propose Transformer with\nresidual value (ResFormer) which approximates cross-layer attention through\nadding a residual connection from the values of the the first layer to all\nsubsequent layers. Based on this method, one variant is the Transformer with\nsingle layer value (SVFormer), where all layers share the same value embedding\nfrom first layer. Comprehensive empirical evidence demonstrates ResFormer\nachieves equivalent validation loss with 10.4% fewer model parameters and 13.6%\nless training data compared to Transformer, while maintaining similar memory\nusage and computational cost. Besides, SVFormer reduces KV cache size by nearly\nhalf with only a small performance penalty and can be integrated with other\nKV-efficient methods, yielding further reductions in KV cache, with performance\ninfluenced by sequence length and cumulative learning rate. Further\nvisualization results suggest that Resformer and SVFormer alleviate attention\nconcentration in deeper layers through avoiding value-state drains and enhance\nrepresentation across most layers.",

                    "value": "Transformers can capture long-range dependencies using self-attention,\nallowing tokens to attend to all others directly. However, stacking multiple\nattention layers leads to attention concentration. One natural way to address\nthis issue is to use cross-layer attention, allowing information from earlier\nlayers to be directly accessible to later layers. However, this approach is\ncomputationally expensive. To address this problem, we propose Transformer with\nresidual value (ResFormer) which approximates cross-layer attention through\nadding a residual connection from the values of the the first layer to all\nsubsequent layers. Based on this method, one variant is the Transformer with\nsingle layer value (SVFormer), where all layers share the same value embedding\nfrom first layer. Comprehensive empirical evidence demonstrates ResFormer\nachieves equivalent validation loss with 10.4% fewer model parameters and 13.6%\nless training data compared to Transformer, while maintaining similar memory\nusage and computational cost. Besides, SVFormer reduces KV cache size by nearly\nhalf with only a small performance penalty and can be integrated with other\nKV-efficient methods, yielding further reductions in KV cache, with performance\ninfluenced by sequence length and cumulative learning rate. Further\nvisualization results suggest that Resformer and SVFormer alleviate attention\nconcentration in deeper layers through avoiding value-state drains and enhance\nrepresentation across most layers."

This is unfortunate for large language model (LLM)\ntoken generation, which is heavily memory-bound. Previous work has proposed to\nleverage natural dynamic activation sparsity in ReLU-activated LLMs to reduce\neffective DRAM bandwidth per token. However, more recent LLMs use SwiGLU\ninstead of ReLU, which result in little inherent sparsity. While SwiGLU\nactivations can be pruned based on magnitude, the resulting sparsity patterns\nare difficult to predict, rendering previous approaches ineffective. To\ncircumvent this issue, our work introduces Dynamic Input Pruning (DIP): a\npredictor-free dynamic sparsification approach, which preserves accuracy with\nminimal fine-tuning. DIP can further use lightweight LoRA adapters to regain\nsome performance lost during sparsification. Lastly, we describe a novel\ncache-aware masking strategy, which considers the cache state and activation\nmagnitude to further increase cache hit rate, improving LLM token rate on\nmobile devices. DIP outperforms other methods in terms of accuracy, memory and\nthroughput trade-offs across simulated hardware settings. On Phi-3-Medium, DIP\nachieves a 46% reduction in memory and 40% increase in throughput with $<$ 0.1\nloss in perplexity.",

In this paper, we explore a memory-efficient\ntraining strategy for deep speaker embedding learning in resource-constrained\nscenarios. Firstly, we conduct a systematic analysis of GPU memory allocation\nduring SV system training. Empirical observations show that activations and\noptimizer states are the main sources of memory consumption. For activations,\nwe design two types of reversible neural networks which eliminate the need to\nstore intermediate activations during back-propagation, thereby significantly\nreducing memory usage without performance loss. For optimizer states, we\nintroduce a dynamic quantization approach that replaces the original 32-bit\nfloating-point values with a dynamic tree-based 8-bit data type. Experimental\nresults on VoxCeleb demonstrate that the reversible variants of ResNets and\nDF-ResNets can perform training without the need to cache activations in GPU\nmemory. In addition, the 8-bit versions of SGD and Adam save 75% of memory\ncosts while maintaining performance compared to their 32-bit counterparts.\nFinally, a detailed comparison of memory usage and performance indicates that\nour proposed models achieve up to 16.2x memory savings, with nearly identical\nparameters and performance compared to the vanilla systems. In contrast to the\nprevious need for multiple high-end GPUs such as the A100, we can effectively\ntrain deep speaker embedding extractors with just one or two consumer-level\n2080Ti GPUs.",

                "summary": "As large language models gain widespread adoption, running them efficiently\nbecomes crucial. Recent works on LLM inference use speculative decoding to\nachieve extreme speedups. However, most of these works implicitly design their\nalgorithms for high-end datacenter hardware. In this work, we ask the opposite\nquestion: how fast can we run LLMs on consumer machines? Consumer GPUs can no\nlonger fit the largest available models (50B+ parameters) and must offload them\nto RAM or SSD. When running with offloaded parameters, the inference engine can\nprocess batches of hundreds or thousands of tokens at the same time as just one\ntoken, making it a natural fit for speculative decoding. We propose SpecExec\n(Speculative Execution), a simple parallel decoding method that can generate up\nto 20 tokens per target model iteration for popular LLM families. It utilizes\nthe high spikiness of the token probabilities distribution in modern LLMs and a\nhigh degree of alignment between model output probabilities. SpecExec takes the\nmost probable tokens continuation from the draft model to build a \"cache\" tree\nfor the target model, which then gets validated in a single pass. Using\nSpecExec, we demonstrate inference of 50B+ parameter LLMs on consumer GPUs with\nRAM offloading at 4-6 tokens per second with 4-bit quantization or 2-3 tokens\nper second with 16-bit weights.",

Recent works on LLM inference use speculative decoding to\nachieve extreme speedups. However, most of these works implicitly design their\nalgorithms for high-end datacenter hardware. In this work, we ask the opposite\nquestion: how fast can we run LLMs on consumer machines? Consumer GPUs can no\nlonger fit the largest available models (50B+ parameters) and must offload them\nto RAM or SSD. When running with offloaded parameters, the inference engine can\nprocess batches of hundreds or thousands of tokens at the same time as just one\ntoken, making it a natural fit for speculative decoding. We propose SpecExec\n(Speculative Execution), a simple parallel decoding method that can generate up\nto 20 tokens per target model iteration for popular LLM families. It utilizes\nthe high spikiness of the token probabilities distribution in modern LLMs and a\nhigh degree of alignment between model output probabilities. SpecExec takes the\nmost probable tokens continuation from the draft model to build a \"cache\" tree\nfor the target model, which then gets validated in a single pass. Using\nSpecExec, we demonstrate inference of 50B+ parameter LLMs on consumer GPUs with\nRAM offloading at 4-6 tokens per second with 4-bit quantization or 2-3 tokens\nper second with 16-bit weights."

These tasks usually show the\ncharacteristic of prefix sharing, where different prompt input can partially\nshow the common prefix. However, the existing LLM inference engines tend to\noptimize the streaming requests and show limitations of supporting the large\nbatched tasks with the prefix sharing characteristic. The existing solutions\nuse the LRU-based cache to reuse the KV context of common prefix. The KV\ncontext that is about to be reused may prematurely be evicted with the implicit\ncache management. Even if not evicted, the lifetime of the shared KV context is\nextended since requests sharing the same context are not scheduled together,\nresulting in larger memory usage. These streaming oriented systems schedule the\nrequests in the first-come-first-serve or similar order. As a result, the\nrequests with larger ratio of decoding steps may be scheduled too late to be\nable to mix with the prefill chunks to increase the hardware utilization.\nBesides, the token and request number based batching can limit the size of\ntoken-batch, which keeps the GPU from saturating for the iterations dominated\nby decoding tokens. We propose BatchLLM to address the above problems. BatchLLM\nexplicitly identifies the common prefixes globally. The requests sharing the\nsame prefix will be scheduled together to reuse the KV context the best, which\nalso shrinks the lifetime of common KV memory. BatchLLM reorders the requests\nand schedules the requests with larger ratio of decoding first to better mix\nthe decoding tokens with the latter prefill chunks and applies memory-centric\ntoken batching to enlarge the token-batch sizes, which helps to increase the\nGPU utilization.

However, as the resolution and duration\nof generated videos increase, the encoding cost of Video VAEs becomes a\nlimiting bottleneck in training LVDMs. Moreover, the block-wise inference\nmethod adopted by most LVDMs can lead to discontinuities of latent space when\nprocessing long-duration videos. The key to addressing the computational\nbottleneck lies in decomposing videos into distinct components and efficiently\nencoding the critical information. Wavelet transform can decompose videos into\nmultiple frequency-domain components and improve the efficiency significantly,\nwe thus propose Wavelet Flow VAE (WF-VAE), an autoencoder that leverages\nmulti-level wavelet transform to facilitate low-frequency energy flow into\nlatent representation. Furthermore, we introduce a method called Causal Cache,\nwhich maintains the integrity of latent space during block-wise inference.\nCompared to state-of-the-art video VAEs, WF-VAE demonstrates superior\nperformance in both PSNR and LPIPS metrics, achieving 2x higher throughput and\n4x lower memory consumption while maintaining competitive reconstruction\nquality.

                    "value": "Video Variational Autoencoder (VAE) encodes videos into a low-dimensional\nlatent space, becoming a key component of most Latent Video Diffusion Models\n(LVDMs) to reduce model training costs. However, as the resolution and duration\nof generated videos increase, the encoding cost of Video VAEs becomes a\nlimiting bottleneck in training LVDMs. Moreover, the block-wise inference\nmethod adopted by most LVDMs can lead to discontinuities of latent space when\nprocessing long-duration videos. The key to addressing the computational\nbottleneck lies in decomposing videos into distinct components and efficiently\nencoding the critical information. Wavelet transform can decompose videos into\nmultiple frequency-domain components and improve the efficiency significantly,\nwe thus propose Wavelet Flow VAE (WF-VAE), an autoencoder that leverages\nmulti-level wavelet transform to facilitate low-frequency energy flow into\nlatent representation. Furthermore, we introduce a method called Causal Cache,\nwhich maintains the integrity of latent space during block-wise inference.\nCompared to state-of-the-art video VAEs, WF-VAE demonstrates superior\nperformance in both PSNR and LPIPS metrics, achieving 2x higher throughput and\n4x lower memory consumption while maintaining competitive reconstruction\nquality.

Existing inverse rendering techniques with co-located light-camera\nfocus on single objects only, without modeling global illumination and\nnear-field lighting more prominent in scenes with multiple objects. We\nintroduce a system that solves this problem in two stages; we first reconstruct\nthe geometry powered by neural volumetric rendering NeuS, followed by inverse\nneural radiosity that uses the previously predicted geometry to estimate albedo\nand roughness. However, such a naive combination fails and we propose multiple\ntechnical contributions that enable this two-stage approach. We observe that\nNeuS fails to handle near-field illumination and strong specular reflections\nfrom the flashlight in a scene. We propose to implicitly model the effects of\nnear-field illumination and introduce a surface angle loss function to handle\nspecular reflections. Similarly, we observe that invNeRad assumes constant\nillumination throughout the capture and cannot handle moving flashlights during\ncapture. We propose a light position-aware radiance cache network and\nadditional smoothness priors on roughness to reconstruct reflectance.\nExperimental evaluation on synthetic and real data shows that our method\noutperforms the existing co-located light-camera-based inverse rendering\ntechniques.

To extend the generation length and facilitate real-world\napplications, a majority of video diffusion models (VDMs) generate videos in an\nautoregressive manner, i.e., generating subsequent clips conditioned on the\nlast frame(s) of the previous clip. However, existing autoregressive VDMs are\nhighly inefficient and redundant: The model must re-compute all the conditional\nframes that are overlapped between adjacent clips. This issue is exacerbated\nwhen the conditional frames are extended autoregressively to provide the model\nwith long-term context. In such cases, the computational demands increase\nsignificantly (i.e., with a quadratic complexity w.r.t. the autoregression\nstep). In this paper, we propose Ca2-VDM, an efficient autoregressive VDM with\nCausal generation and Cache sharing. For causal generation, it introduces\nunidirectional feature computation, which ensures that the cache of conditional\nframes can be precomputed in previous autoregression steps and reused in every\nsubsequent step, eliminating redundant computations. For cache sharing, it\nshares the cache across all denoising steps to avoid the huge cache storage\ncost.

We\npresent Deegen, a meta-compiler that allows users to generate a\nhigh-performance JIT-capable VM for their own language at an engineering cost\nsimilar to writing a simple interpreter. Deegen takes in the execution\nsemantics of the bytecodes implemented as C++ functions, and automatically\ngenerates a two-tier VM execution engine with a state-of-the-art interpreter, a\nstate-of-the-art baseline JIT, and the tier-switching logic that connects them\ninto a self-adaptive system.\n  We are the first to demonstrate the automatic generation of a JIT compiler,\nand the automatic generation of an interpreter that outperforms the state of\nthe art. Our performance comes from a long list of optimizations supported by\nDeegen, including bytecode specialization and quickening, register pinning, tag\nregister optimization, call inline caching, generic inline caching, JIT\npolymorphic IC, JIT IC inline slab, type-check removal and strength reduction,\ntype-based slow-path extraction and outlining, JIT hot-cold code splitting, and\nJIT OSR-entry. These optimizations are either employed automatically, or guided\nby the language implementer through intuitive APIs. As a result, the\ndisassembly of the Deegen-generated interpreter, baseline JIT, and the\ngenerated JIT code rivals the assembly code hand-written by experts in\nstate-of-the-art VMs.\n  We implement LuaJIT Remake (LJR), a standard-compliant Lua 5.1 VM, using\nDeegen. Across 44 benchmarks, LJR's interpreter is on average 179% faster than\nthe official PUC Lua interpreter, and 31% faster than LuaJIT's interpreter.\nLJR's baseline JIT has negligible startup delay, and its execution performance\nis on average 360% faster than PUC Lua and only 33% slower (but faster on 13/44\nbenchmarks) than LuaJIT's optimizing JIT.",

However, for many of\nthese applications, much of the context in the prompt is fixed across different\nuser inputs, thereby providing the opportunity to perform offline optimizations\nto process user inputs quickly, as they are received. In this work, we propose\nSqueezed Attention as a mechanism to accelerate LLM applications where a large\nportion of the input prompt is fixed. We first leverage K-means clustering\noffline to group the keys for the fixed context based on semantic similarity\nand represent each cluster with a single centroid value. During inference, we\ncompare query tokens from the user input with the centroids to predict which of\nthe keys from the fixed context are semantically relevant and need to be loaded\nduring inference. We then compute exact attention using only these important\nkeys from the fixed context, thereby reducing bandwidth and computational\ncosts. We also extend our method to use a hierarchical centroid lookup to\nidentify important keys, which can reduce the complexity of attention from\nlinear to logarithmic with respect to the context length. We implement\noptimized Triton kernels for centroid comparison and sparse FlashAttention with\nimportant keys, achieving more than 4x speedups during both the prefill and\ngeneration phases for long-context inference. Furthermore, we have extensively\nevaluated our method on various long-context benchmarks including LongBench,\nwhere it achieves a 3x reduction in KV cache budget without accuracy loss and\nup to an 8x reduction with <0.5 point accuracy gap for various models.",

This requires\ndownsampling to meet GPU constraints, sacrificing the fine-grained details\nneeded for high-precision interactive segmentation. To address SAM's\nlimitations, we focus on visual length extrapolation and propose a lightweight\nmodel named HRSAM. The extrapolation enables HRSAM trained on low resolutions\nto generalize to high resolutions. We begin by finding the link between the\nextrapolation and attention scores, which leads us to base HRSAM on Swin\nattention. We then introduce the Flexible Local Attention (FLA) framework,\nusing CUDA-optimized Efficient Memory Attention to accelerate HRSAM. Within\nFLA, we implement Flash Swin attention, achieving over a 35% speedup compared\nto traditional Swin attention, and propose a KV-only padding mechanism to\nenhance extrapolation. We also develop the Cycle-scan module that uses State\nSpace models to efficiently expand HRSAM's receptive field. We further develop\nthe HRSAM++ within FLA by adding an anchor map, providing multi-scale data\naugmentation for the extrapolation and a larger receptive field at slight\ncomputational cost. Experiments show that, under standard training, HRSAMs\nsurpass the previous SOTA with only 38% of the latency. With SAM-distillation,\nthe extrapolation enables HRSAMs to outperform the teacher model at lower\nlatency. Further finetuning achieves performance significantly exceeding the\nprevious SOTA.",

The training of the U-Net model for liver region segmentation\ntook under 30 minutes and the automatic delineation of a liver dome for any\ntriggered image took less than one second.

Using these smaller\nprofiles, the reuse profile is extrapolated for the actual loop bound(s). We\nuse this reuse profile to predict the cache hit rate. Results show that our\nmodel can predict cache hit rates with an average accuracy of 95% relative to\nthe dynamic reuse profile methods."

                "summary": "In recent years, Transformer-based models (Transformers) have achieved\nsignificant success in multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF). However,\nprevious works focus on extracting features either from the time domain or the\nfrequency domain, which inadequately captures the trends and periodic\ncharacteristics. To address this issue, we propose a wavelet learning framework\nto model complex temporal dependencies of the time series data. The wavelet\ndomain integrates both time and frequency information, allowing for the\nanalysis of local characteristics of signals at different scales. Additionally,\nthe Softmax self-attention mechanism used by Transformers has quadratic\ncomplexity, which leads to excessive computational costs when capturing\nlong-term dependencies. Therefore, we propose a novel attention mechanism:\nRotary Route Attention (RoRA). Unlike Softmax attention, RoRA utilizes rotary\nposition embeddings to inject relative positional information to sequence\ntokens and introduces a small number of routing tokens $r$ to aggregate\ninformation from the $KV$ matrices and redistribute it to the $Q$ matrix,\noffering linear complexity. We further propose WaveRoRA, which leverages RoRA\nto capture inter-series dependencies in the wavelet domain. We conduct\nextensive experiments on eight real-world datasets. The results indicate that\nWaveRoRA outperforms existing state-of-the-art models while maintaining lower\ncomputational costs. Our code is available at\nhttps://github.com/Leopold2333/WaveRoRA.",

For\nthis purpose, a DNBI was installed and operated in the RFX-mod experiment,\nwhich was designed to confine plasma mainly through the Reversed Field Pinch\nconfiguration. The DNBI, designed and built by the Budker Institute of Plasma\nPhysics, was based on a source of positive hydrogen ions, accelerated to 50 keV\nand for an equivalent neutral beam current of about 5 A at the source. The beam\ncould be modulated and the maximum overall duration was 50 ms.

For\nthis purpose, a DNBI was installed and operated in the RFX-mod experiment,\nwhich was designed to confine plasma mainly through the Reversed Field Pinch\nconfiguration. The DNBI, designed and built by the Budker Institute of Plasma\nPhysics, was based on a source of positive hydrogen ions, accelerated to 50 keV\nand for an equivalent neutral beam current of about 5 A at the source. The beam\ncould be modulated and the maximum overall duration was 50 ms.

BiMediX2 leverages the Llama3.1 architecture and integrates text\nand visual capabilities to facilitate seamless interactions in both English and\nArabic, supporting text-based inputs and multi-turn conversations involving\nmedical images. The model is trained on an extensive bilingual healthcare\ndataset consisting of 1.6M samples of diverse medical interactions for both\ntext and image modalities, mixed in Arabic and English. We also propose the\nfirst bilingual GPT-4o based medical LMM benchmark named BiMed-MBench. BiMediX2\nis benchmarked on both text-based and image-based tasks, achieving\nstate-of-the-art performance across several medical benchmarks. It outperforms\nrecent state-of-the-art models in medical LLM evaluation benchmarks. Our model\nalso sets a new benchmark in multimodal medical evaluations with over 9%\nimprovement in English and over 20% in Arabic evaluations. Additionally, it\nsurpasses GPT-4 by around 9% in UPHILL factual accuracy evaluations and excels\nin various medical Visual Question Answering, Report Generation, and Report\nSummarization tasks.

However, 2D control signals are inherently limited in expressing the\n3D nature of object motions. To overcome this problem, we introduce\n3DTrajMaster, a robust controller that regulates multi-entity dynamics in 3D\nspace, given user-desired 6DoF pose (location and rotation) sequences of\nentities. At the core of our approach is a plug-and-play 3D-motion grounded\nobject injector that fuses multiple input entities with their respective 3D\ntrajectories through a gated self-attention mechanism. In addition, we exploit\nan injector architecture to preserve the video diffusion prior, which is\ncrucial for generalization ability. To mitigate video quality degradation, we\nintroduce a domain adaptor during training and employ an annealed sampling\nstrategy during inference. To address the lack of suitable training data, we\nconstruct a 360-Motion Dataset, which first correlates collected 3D human and\nanimal assets with GPT-generated trajectory and then captures their motion with\n12 evenly-surround cameras on diverse 3D UE platforms. Extensive experiments\nshow that 3DTrajMaster sets a new state-of-the-art in both accuracy and\ngeneralization for controlling multi-entity 3D motions.

To automate this process while maintaining data privacy, we\ndevelop a practical approach using locally deployable large language models\n(LLMs). Inspired by recent advances in automatic International Classification\nof Diseases (ICD) coding, our method frames ATC coding as a hierarchical\ninformation extraction task, guiding LLMs through the ATC ontology level by\nlevel. We evaluate our approach using GPT-4o as an accuracy ceiling and focus\ndevelopment on open-source Llama models suitable for privacy-sensitive\ndeployment. Testing across Health Canada drug product data, the RABBITS\nbenchmark, and real clinical notes from Ontario Health, our method achieves 78%\nexact match accuracy with GPT-4o and 60% with Llama 3.1 70B. We investigate\nknowledge grounding through drug definitions, finding modest improvements in\naccuracy.

To automate this process while maintaining data privacy, we\ndevelop a practical approach using locally deployable large language models\n(LLMs). Inspired by recent advances in automatic International Classification\nof Diseases (ICD) coding, our method frames ATC coding as a hierarchical\ninformation extraction task, guiding LLMs through the ATC ontology level by\nlevel. We evaluate our approach using GPT-4o as an accuracy ceiling and focus\ndevelopment on open-source Llama models suitable for privacy-sensitive\ndeployment. Testing across Health Canada drug product data, the RABBITS\nbenchmark, and real clinical notes from Ontario Health, our method achieves 78%\nexact match accuracy with GPT-4o and 60% with Llama 3.1 70B. We investigate\nknowledge grounding through drug definitions, finding modest improvements in\naccuracy.

                "summary": "The recent surge of interest in comprehensive multimodal models has\nnecessitated the unification of diverse modalities. However, the unification\nsuffers from disparate methodologies. Continuous visual generation necessitates\nthe full-sequence diffusion-based approach, despite its divergence from the\nautoregressive modeling in the text domain. We posit that autoregressive\nmodeling, i.e., predicting the future based on past deterministic experience,\nremains crucial in developing both a visual generation model and a potential\nunified multimodal model. In this paper, we explore an interpolation between\nthe autoregressive modeling and full-parameters diffusion to model visual\ninformation. At its core, we present ACDiT, an Autoregressive blockwise\nConditional Diffusion Transformer, where the block size of diffusion, i.e., the\nsize of autoregressive units, can be flexibly adjusted to interpolate between\ntoken-wise autoregression and full-sequence diffusion. ACDiT is easy to\nimplement, as simple as creating a Skip-Causal Attention Mask (SCAM) during\ntraining.

                    "value": "The recent surge of interest in comprehensive multimodal models has\nnecessitated the unification of diverse modalities. However, the unification\nsuffers from disparate methodologies. Continuous visual generation necessitates\nthe full-sequence diffusion-based approach, despite its divergence from the\nautoregressive modeling in the text domain. We posit that autoregressive\nmodeling, i.e., predicting the future based on past deterministic experience,\nremains crucial in developing both a visual generation model and a potential\nunified multimodal model. In this paper, we explore an interpolation between\nthe autoregressive modeling and full-parameters diffusion to model visual\ninformation. At its core, we present ACDiT, an Autoregressive blockwise\nConditional Diffusion Transformer, where the block size of diffusion, i.e., the\nsize of autoregressive units, can be flexibly adjusted to interpolate between\ntoken-wise autoregression and full-sequence diffusion. ACDiT is easy to\nimplement, as simple as creating a Skip-Causal Attention Mask (SCAM) during\ntraining. During inference, the process iterates between diffusion denoising\nand autoregressive decoding that can make full use of KV-Cache. We verify the\neffectiveness of ACDiT on image and video generation tasks. We also demonstrate\nthat benefitted from autoregressive modeling, ACDiT can be seamlessly used in\nvisual understanding tasks despite being trained on the diffusion objective.\nThe analysis of the trade-off between autoregressive modeling and diffusion\ndemonstrates the potential of ACDiT to be used in long-horizon visual\ngeneration tasks.

However,\ntraditional machine learning (ML) approaches, which require extensive local\ntraining on sensitive datasets, pose substantial privacy risks and compliance\nchallenges with regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)\nand California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Existing privacy-preserving\ntechniques, such as anonymization, differential privacy, and federated\nlearning, address some concerns but face limitations in utility, scalability,\nand complexity. This paper introduces the Privacy-Preserving Zero-Shot Learning\n(PP-ZSL) framework, a novel approach leveraging large language models (LLMs) in\na zero-shot learning mode. Unlike conventional ML methods, PP-ZSL eliminates\nthe need for local training on sensitive data by utilizing pre-trained LLMs to\ngenerate responses directly. The framework incorporates real-time data\nanonymization to redact or mask sensitive information, retrieval-augmented\ngeneration (RAG) for domain-specific query resolution, and robust\npost-processing to ensure compliance with regulatory standards. This\ncombination reduces privacy risks, simplifies compliance, and enhances\nscalability and operational efficiency. Empirical analysis demonstrates that\nthe PP-ZSL framework provides accurate, privacy-compliant responses while\nsignificantly lowering the costs and complexities of deploying AI-driven\ncustomer support systems. The study highlights potential applications across\nindustries, including financial services, healthcare, e-commerce, legal\nsupport, telecommunications, and government services. By addressing the dual\nchallenges of privacy and performance, this framework establishes a foundation\nfor secure, efficient, and regulatory-compliant AI applications in customer\ninteractions.",

Existing debiasing methods often rely on prior knowledge of\nspecific dataset biases, which is challenging to acquire a priori. We propose\nRAZOR (Rewriting And Zero-bias Optimization Refinement), a novel, unsupervised,\nand data-focused debiasing approach based on text rewriting for shortcut\nmitigation. RAZOR leverages LLMs to iteratively rewrite potentially biased text\nsegments by replacing them with heuristically selected alternatives in a\nshortcut space defined by token statistics and positional information.

We collect 104GB of\nDutch text ($32$B tokens) from various sources to first apply continued\npretraining using low-rank adaptation (LoRA), complemented with Dutch\nposttraining strategies provided by prior work. For Llama-2, we consider using\n(i) the tokenizer of the original model, and (ii) training a new,\nDutch-specific tokenizer combined with embedding reinitialization. We evaluate\nour adapted models, ChocoLlama-2, both on standard benchmarks and a novel Dutch\nbenchmark, ChocoLlama-Bench. Our results demonstrate that LoRA can effectively\nscale for language adaptation, and that tokenizer modification with careful\nweight reinitialization can improve performance. Notably, Llama-3 was released\nduring the course of this project and, upon evaluation, demonstrated superior\nDutch capabilities compared to our Dutch-adapted versions of Llama-2. We hence\napply the same adaptation technique to Llama-3, using its original tokenizer.\nWhile our adaptation methods enhanced Llama-2's Dutch capabilities, we found\nlimited gains when applying the same techniques to Llama-3.

Existing methodologies employ\nword embedding models for acquiring text representations as node features,\nwhich are subsequently fed into Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for training.\nRecently, the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has introduced their\npowerful capabilities in information retrieval and text generation, which can\ngreatly enhance the text attributes of graph data. Furthermore, the acquisition\nand labeling of extensive datasets are both costly and time-consuming\nendeavors. Consequently, few-shot learning has emerged as a crucial problem in\nthe context of graph learning tasks. In order to tackle this challenge, we\npropose a lightweight paradigm called LLM4NG, which adopts a plug-and-play\napproach to empower text-attributed graphs through node generation using LLMs.\nSpecifically, we utilize LLMs to extract semantic information from the labels\nand generate samples that belong to these categories as exemplars.\nSubsequently, we employ an edge predictor to capture the structural information\ninherent in the raw dataset and integrate the newly generated samples into the\noriginal graph. This approach harnesses LLMs for enhancing class-level\ninformation and seamlessly introduces labeled nodes and edges without modifying\nthe raw dataset, thereby facilitating the node classification task in few-shot\nscenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate the outstanding performance of our\nproposed paradigm, particularly in low-shot scenarios.

Such approaches\nimplicitly treat discrepancies in recommended items as biases, overlooking\nwhether these changes might stem from genuine personalization aligned with true\npreferences of users. Moreover, these earlier studies typically address single\nsensitive attributes in isolation, neglecting the complex interplay of\nintersectional identities. In response to these shortcomings, we introduce\nCFaiRLLM, an enhanced evaluation framework that not only incorporates true\npreference alignment but also rigorously examines intersectional fairness by\nconsidering overlapping sensitive attributes. Additionally, CFaiRLLM introduces\ndiverse user profile sampling strategies-random, top-rated, and\nrecency-focused-to better understand the impact of profile generation fed to\nLLMs in light of inherent token limitations in these systems. Given that\nfairness depends on accurately understanding users' tastes and preferences,,\nthese strategies provide a more realistic assessment of fairness within\nRecLLMs.\n  The results demonstrated that true preference alignment offers a more\npersonalized and fair assessment compared to similarity-based measures,\nrevealing significant disparities when sensitive and intersectional attributes\nare incorporated. Notably, our study finds that intersectional attributes\namplify fairness gaps more prominently, especially in less structured domains\nsuch as music recommendations in LastFM.",

Through empirical analysis of\nestablished text-to-image diffusion models, we conduct an in-depth\ninvestigation into how model size influences sampling efficiency across varying\nsampling steps. Our findings unveil a surprising trend: when operating under a\ngiven inference budget, smaller models frequently outperform their larger\nequivalents in generating high-quality results. Moreover, we extend our study\nto demonstrate the generalizability of the these findings by applying various\ndiffusion samplers, exploring diverse downstream tasks, evaluating\npost-distilled models, as well as comparing performance relative to training\ncompute. These findings open up new pathways for the development of LDM scaling\nstrategies which can be employed to enhance generative capabilities within\nlimited inference budgets.",

Through empirical analysis of\nestablished text-to-image diffusion models, we conduct an in-depth\ninvestigation into how model size influences sampling efficiency across varying\nsampling steps. Our findings unveil a surprising trend: when operating under a\ngiven inference budget, smaller models frequently outperform their larger\nequivalents in generating high-quality results. Moreover, we extend our study\nto demonstrate the generalizability of the these findings by applying various\ndiffusion samplers, exploring diverse downstream tasks, evaluating\npost-distilled models, as well as comparing performance relative to training\ncompute. These findings open up new pathways for the development of LDM scaling\nstrategies which can be employed to enhance generative capabilities within\nlimited inference budgets."

AiM employs Mamba, a novel state-space model characterized\nby its exceptional performance for long-sequence modeling with linear time\ncomplexity, to supplant the commonly utilized Transformers in AR image\ngeneration models, aiming to achieve both superior generation quality and\nenhanced inference speed. Unlike existing methods that adapt Mamba to handle\ntwo-dimensional signals via multi-directional scan, AiM directly utilizes the\nnext-token prediction paradigm for autoregressive image generation. This\napproach circumvents the need for extensive modifications to enable Mamba to\nlearn 2D spatial representations. By implementing straightforward yet\nstrategically targeted modifications for visual generative tasks, we preserve\nMamba's core structure, fully exploiting its efficient long-sequence modeling\ncapabilities and scalability.

On the ImageNet1K 256*256\nbenchmark, our best AiM model achieves a FID of 2.21, surpassing all existing\nAR models of comparable parameter counts and demonstrating significant\ncompetitiveness against diffusion models, with 2 to 10 times faster inference\nspeed.

The dust\ncontinuum emission is compact with $\\sim 80\\%$ recovered within $r<0.\"3$ $(1.6\\\n\\rm{kpc})$, whereas the [C II] emission profile is composed of a central\nGaussian ($r<0.\"4$, i.e. $<2.2\\ \\rm{kpc}$) and an extended component (detected\nup to $\\sim 10\\ \\rm{kpc}$ at $>3\\sigma$). We infer a direct contribution of the\nquasar to the observed 260\\ \\rm{GHz} continuum $S_{\\nu,\\rm{QSO}} /\nS_{\\nu,\\rm{QSO+Host}} \\lesssim 1\\%$. We report the detection of FIR-detected\nstar-forming clumps with $r<200 \\ \\rm{pc}$ and properties similar to that of\nrest-frame UV-optical clumps reported in the literature. The $200\\ \\rm{pc}$\nresolved [C II]/FIR ratio follows the global relation with the FIR surface\nbrightness established in low- and high-redshift galaxies, even at the quasar\nlocation. We find that dust continuum is emitted in regions of\n$\\sim0.\"02-0.\"04$ consistent with the size of photo-dissociation regions (PDR),\nwhereas $50\\%$ of the [C II] originates from larger physical scales ($\\theta\n\\gtrsim 2\"$).

The dust\ncontinuum emission is compact with $\\sim 80\\%$ recovered within $r<0.\"3$ $(1.6\\\n\\rm{kpc})$, whereas the [C II] emission profile is composed of a central\nGaussian ($r<0.\"4$, i.e. $<2.2\\ \\rm{kpc}$) and an extended component (detected\nup to $\\sim 10\\ \\rm{kpc}$ at $>3\\sigma$). We infer a direct contribution of the\nquasar to the observed 260\\ \\rm{GHz} continuum $S_{\\nu,\\rm{QSO}} /\nS_{\\nu,\\rm{QSO+Host}} \\lesssim 1\\%$. We report the detection of FIR-detected\nstar-forming clumps with $r<200 \\ \\rm{pc}$ and properties similar to that of\nrest-frame UV-optical clumps reported in the literature. The $200\\ \\rm{pc}$\nresolved [C II]/FIR ratio follows the global relation with the FIR surface\nbrightness established in low- and high-redshift galaxies, even at the quasar\nlocation. We find that dust continuum is emitted in regions of\n$\\sim0.\"02-0.\"04$ consistent with the size of photo-dissociation regions (PDR),\nwhereas $50\\%$ of the [C II] originates from larger physical scales ($\\theta\n\\gtrsim 2\"$).

However, this swift advancement has also introduced new\nsecurity vulnerabilities. Jailbreaking, a form of attack that induces LLMs to\nproduce harmful content through carefully crafted prompts, presents a\nsignificant challenge to the safe and trustworthy development of LLMs. Previous\njailbreak methods primarily exploited the internal properties or capabilities\nof LLMs, such as optimization-based jailbreak approaches and methods that\nleveraged the model's context-learning abilities. In this paper, we introduce a\nnovel jailbreak method, SQL Injection Jailbreak (SIJ), which targets the\nexternal properties of LLMs, specifically, the way LLMs construct input\nprompts.

                "summary": "Large language models (LLMs), trained on diverse data effectively acquire a\nbreadth of information across various domains. However, their computational\ncomplexity, cost, and lack of transparency hinder their direct application for\nspecialised tasks. In fields such as clinical research, acquiring expert\nannotations or prior knowledge about predictive models is often costly and\ntime-consuming. This study proposes the use of LLMs to elicit expert prior\ndistributions for predictive models. This approach also provides an alternative\nto in-context learning, where language models are tasked with making\npredictions directly. In this work, we compare LLM-elicited and uninformative\npriors, evaluate whether LLMs truthfully generate parameter distributions, and\npropose a model selection strategy for in-context learning and prior\nelicitation. Our findings show that LLM-elicited prior parameter distributions\nsignificantly reduce predictive error compared to uninformative priors in\nlow-data settings. Applied to clinical problems, this translates to fewer\nrequired biological samples, lowering cost and resources. Prior elicitation\nalso consistently outperforms and proves more reliable than in-context learning\nat a lower cost, making it a preferred alternative in our setting. We\ndemonstrate the utility of this method across various use cases, including\nclinical applications. For infection prediction, using LLM-elicited priors\nreduced the number of required labels to achieve the same accuracy as an\nuninformative prior by 55%, 200 days earlier in the study.",

Our findings indicate that the LLM's language orientation and\nthe task's domain influence the effectiveness of the prompt strategy, which\nenriches previous research findings. We built closely-interconnected reasoning\nand memorization tasks, and found that some LLMs struggle with memorizing\nChinese commonsense, affecting their reasoning ability, while others show\ndifferences in reasoning despite similar memorization performance. We also\nevaluated the LLMs' memorization-independent reasoning abilities and analyzed\nthe typical errors. Our study precisely identified the LLMs' strengths and\nweaknesses, providing the clear direction for optimization. It can also serve\nas a reference for studies in other fields.

                "summary": "In sequential recommendation (SR), neural models have been actively explored\ndue to their remarkable performance, but they suffer from inefficiency inherent\nto their complexity. On the other hand, linear SR models exhibit high\nefficiency and achieve competitive or superior accuracy compared to neural\nmodels. However, they solely deal with the sequential order of items (i.e.,\nsequential information) and overlook the actual timestamp (i.e., temporal\ninformation). It is limited to effectively capturing various user preference\ndrifts over time. To address this issue, we propose a novel linear SR model,\nnamed TemporAl LinEar item-item model (TALE), incorporating temporal\ninformation while preserving training/inference efficiency, with three key\ncomponents. (i) Single-target augmentation concentrates on a single target\nitem, enabling us to learn the temporal correlation for the target item. (ii)\nTime interval-aware weighting utilizes the actual timestamp to discern the item\ncorrelation depending on time intervals. (iii) Trend-aware normalization\nreflects the dynamic shift of item popularity over time. Our empirical studies\nshow that TALE outperforms ten competing SR models by up to 18.71% gains on\nfive benchmark datasets. It also exhibits remarkable effectiveness in\nevaluating long-tail items by up to 30.45% gains. The source code is available\nat https://github.com/psm1206/TALE.",

On the other hand, linear SR models exhibit high\nefficiency and achieve competitive or superior accuracy compared to neural\nmodels. However, they solely deal with the sequential order of items (i.e.,\nsequential information) and overlook the actual timestamp (i.e., temporal\ninformation). It is limited to effectively capturing various user preference\ndrifts over time. To address this issue, we propose a novel linear SR model,\nnamed TemporAl LinEar item-item model (TALE), incorporating temporal\ninformation while preserving training/inference efficiency, with three key\ncomponents. (i) Single-target augmentation concentrates on a single target\nitem, enabling us to learn the temporal correlation for the target item. (ii)\nTime interval-aware weighting utilizes the actual timestamp to discern the item\ncorrelation depending on time intervals. (iii) Trend-aware normalization\nreflects the dynamic shift of item popularity over time. Our empirical studies\nshow that TALE outperforms ten competing SR models by up to 18.71% gains on\nfive benchmark datasets. It also exhibits remarkable effectiveness in\nevaluating long-tail items by up to 30.45% gains. The source code is available\nat https://github.com/psm1206/TALE."

We compare these posteriors\nwith those obtained from Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques and discuss the\ndifferences that appear, in particular in relation with the important role that\ndata compression has in the modular implementation of the method that we\npresent."

To address this, we introduce\nConceptSearch, a novel function-search algorithm that leverages LLMs for\nprogram generation and employs a concept-based scoring method to guide the\nsearch efficiently. Unlike simplistic pixel-based metrics like Hamming\ndistance, ConceptSearch evaluates programs on their ability to capture the\nunderlying transformation concept reflected in the input-output examples. We\nexplore three scoring functions: Hamming distance, a CNN-based scoring\nfunction, and an LLM-based natural language scoring function. Experimental\nresults demonstrate the effectiveness of ConceptSearch, achieving a significant\nperformance improvement over direct prompting with GPT-4. Moreover, our novel\nconcept-based scoring exhibits up to 30% greater efficiency compared to Hamming\ndistance, measured in terms of the number of iterations required to reach the\ncorrect solution.

BiMediX2 leverages the Llama3.1 architecture and integrates text\nand visual capabilities to facilitate seamless interactions in both English and\nArabic, supporting text-based inputs and multi-turn conversations involving\nmedical images. The model is trained on an extensive bilingual healthcare\ndataset consisting of 1.6M samples of diverse medical interactions for both\ntext and image modalities, mixed in Arabic and English. We also propose the\nfirst bilingual GPT-4o based medical LMM benchmark named BiMed-MBench. BiMediX2\nis benchmarked on both text-based and image-based tasks, achieving\nstate-of-the-art performance across several medical benchmarks. It outperforms\nrecent state-of-the-art models in medical LLM evaluation benchmarks. Our model\nalso sets a new benchmark in multimodal medical evaluations with over 9%\nimprovement in English and over 20% in Arabic evaluations. Additionally, it\nsurpasses GPT-4 by around 9% in UPHILL factual accuracy evaluations and excels\nin various medical Visual Question Answering, Report Generation, and Report\nSummarization tasks.

By leveraging user feedback\nwith interactive prompts at a frame, e.g., a simple click or draw of boxes, TTC\ncould immediately update the corresponding detection results for future\nstreaming inputs, even though the model is deployed with fixed parameters. This\nenables autonomous driving systems to adapt to new scenarios immediately and\ndecrease deployment risks reliably without additional expensive training. To\nachieve such TTC system, we equip existing 3D detectors with Online Adapter\n(OA) module, a prompt-driven query generator for online correction. At the core\nof OA module are visual prompts, images of missed object-of-interest for\nguiding the corresponding detection and subsequent tracking. Those visual\nprompts, belonging to missed objects through online inference, are maintained\nby the visual prompt buffer for continuous error correction in subsequent\nframes. By doing so, TTC consistently detects online missed objects and\nimmediately lowers driving risks. It achieves reliable, versatile, and adaptive\ndriving autonomy. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant gain on instant\nerror rectification over pre-trained 3D detectors, even in challenging\nscenarios with limited labels, zero-shot detection, and adverse conditions. We\nhope this work would inspire the community to investigate online rectification\nsystems for autonomous driving post-deployment. Code would be publicly shared.",

However, effectively integrating recommender system\nknowledge into LLMs for natural language generation which is tailored towards\nrecommendation tasks remains a challenge. This paper addresses this challenge\nby making two key contributions.\n  First, we introduce a new dataset (REGEN) for natural language generation\ntasks in conversational recommendations. REGEN (Reviews Enhanced with\nGEnerative Narratives) extends the Amazon Product Reviews dataset with rich\nuser narratives, including personalized explanations of product preferences,\nproduct endorsements for recommended items, and summaries of user purchase\nhistory. REGEN is made publicly available to facilitate further research.\nFurthermore, we establish benchmarks using well-known generative metrics, and\nperform an automated evaluation of the new dataset using a rater LLM. Second,\nthe paper introduces a fusion architecture (CF model with an LLM) which serves\nas a baseline for REGEN. And to the best of our knowledge, represents the first\nattempt to analyze the capabilities of LLMs in understanding recommender\nsignals and generating rich narratives. We demonstrate that LLMs can\neffectively learn from simple fusion architectures utilizing interaction-based\nCF embeddings, and this can be further enhanced using the metadata and\npersonalization data associated with items. Our experiments show that combining\nCF and content embeddings leads to improvements of 4-12% in key language\nmetrics compared to using either type of embedding individually. We also\nprovide an analysis to interpret how CF and content embeddings contribute to\nthis new generative task.",

However, effectively integrating recommender system\nknowledge into LLMs for natural language generation which is tailored towards\nrecommendation tasks remains a challenge. This paper addresses this challenge\nby making two key contributions.\n  First, we introduce a new dataset (REGEN) for natural language generation\ntasks in conversational recommendations. REGEN (Reviews Enhanced with\nGEnerative Narratives) extends the Amazon Product Reviews dataset with rich\nuser narratives, including personalized explanations of product preferences,\nproduct endorsements for recommended items, and summaries of user purchase\nhistory. REGEN is made publicly available to facilitate further research.\nFurthermore, we establish benchmarks using well-known generative metrics, and\nperform an automated evaluation of the new dataset using a rater LLM. Second,\nthe paper introduces a fusion architecture (CF model with an LLM) which serves\nas a baseline for REGEN. And to the best of our knowledge, represents the first\nattempt to analyze the capabilities of LLMs in understanding recommender\nsignals and generating rich narratives. We demonstrate that LLMs can\neffectively learn from simple fusion architectures utilizing interaction-based\nCF embeddings, and this can be further enhanced using the metadata and\npersonalization data associated with items. Our experiments show that combining\nCF and content embeddings leads to improvements of 4-12% in key language\nmetrics compared to using either type of embedding individually. We also\nprovide an analysis to interpret how CF and content embeddings contribute to\nthis new generative task."

However, it has been challenging to date to apply these methods\nto the full scale of LLM pretraining. In this paper, we refine existing\ngradient-based methods to work effectively at scale, allowing us to retrieve\ninfluential examples for an 8B-parameter language model from a pretraining\ncorpus of over 160B tokens with no need for subsampling or pre-filtering. Our\nmethod combines several techniques, including optimizer state correction, a\ntask-specific Hessian approximation, and normalized encodings, which we find to\nbe critical for performance at scale. In quantitative evaluations on a fact\ntracing task, our method performs best at identifying examples that influence\nmodel predictions, but classical, model-agnostic retrieval methods such as BM25\nstill perform better at finding passages which explicitly contain relevant\nfacts. These results demonstrate a misalignment between factual *attribution*\nand causal *influence*. With increasing model size and training tokens, we find\nthat influence more closely aligns with factual attribution. Finally, we\nexamine different types of examples identified as influential by our method,\nfinding that while many directly entail a particular fact, others support the\nsame output by reinforcing priors on relation types, common entities, and\nnames. We release our prompt set and model outputs, along with a web-based\nvisualization tool to explore influential examples for factual predictions,\ncommonsense reasoning, arithmetic, and open-ended generation for an\n8B-parameter LLM.",

                    "value": "Training data attribution (TDA) methods aim to attribute model outputs back\nto specific training examples, and the application of these methods to large\nlanguage model (LLM) outputs could significantly advance model transparency and\ndata curation. However, it has been challenging to date to apply these methods\nto the full scale of LLM pretraining. In this paper, we refine existing\ngradient-based methods to work effectively at scale, allowing us to retrieve\ninfluential examples for an 8B-parameter language model from a pretraining\ncorpus of over 160B tokens with no need for subsampling or pre-filtering. Our\nmethod combines several techniques, including optimizer state correction, a\ntask-specific Hessian approximation, and normalized encodings, which we find to\nbe critical for performance at scale. In quantitative evaluations on a fact\ntracing task, our method performs best at identifying examples that influence\nmodel predictions, but classical, model-agnostic retrieval methods such as BM25\nstill perform better at finding passages which explicitly contain relevant\nfacts. These results demonstrate a misalignment between factual *attribution*\nand causal *influence*. With increasing model size and training tokens, we find\nthat influence more closely aligns with factual attribution. Finally, we\nexamine different types of examples identified as influential by our method,\nfinding that while many directly entail a particular fact, others support the\nsame output by reinforcing priors on relation types, common entities, and\nnames. We release our prompt set and model outputs, along with a web-based\nvisualization tool to explore influential examples for factual predictions,\ncommonsense reasoning, arithmetic, and open-ended generation for an\n8B-parameter LLM."

Recently, single-agent environments address this by generating new\ntasks based on agent actions, enhancing task diversity. We consider the\ndecision-making problem in multi-agent settings, where tasks are further\ninfluenced by social connections, affecting rewards and information access.\nHowever, existing multi-agent environments lack a combination of adaptive\nphysical surroundings and social connections, hindering the learning of\nintelligent behaviors. To address this, we introduce AdaSociety, a customizable\nmulti-agent environment featuring expanding state and action spaces, alongside\nexplicit and alterable social structures. As agents progress, the environment\nadaptively generates new tasks with social structures for agents to undertake.\nIn AdaSociety, we develop three mini-games showcasing distinct social\nstructures and tasks. Initial results demonstrate that specific social\nstructures can promote both individual and collective benefits, though current\nreinforcement learning and LLM-based algorithms show limited effectiveness in\nleveraging social structures to enhance performance. Overall, AdaSociety serves\nas a valuable research platform for exploring intelligence in diverse physical\nand social settings. The code is available at\nhttps://github.com/bigai-ai/AdaSociety.",

In\nthis work, we explore strategies for adapting the primarily English LLMs\n(Llama-2 and Llama-3) to Dutch, a language spoken by 30 million people\nworldwide yet often underrepresented in LLM development. We collect 104GB of\nDutch text ($32$B tokens) from various sources to first apply continued\npretraining using low-rank adaptation (LoRA), complemented with Dutch\nposttraining strategies provided by prior work. For Llama-2, we consider using\n(i) the tokenizer of the original model, and (ii) training a new,\nDutch-specific tokenizer combined with embedding reinitialization. We evaluate\nour adapted models, ChocoLlama-2, both on standard benchmarks and a novel Dutch\nbenchmark, ChocoLlama-Bench. Our results demonstrate that LoRA can effectively\nscale for language adaptation, and that tokenizer modification with careful\nweight reinitialization can improve performance. Notably, Llama-3 was released\nduring the course of this project and, upon evaluation, demonstrated superior\nDutch capabilities compared to our Dutch-adapted versions of Llama-2. We hence\napply the same adaptation technique to Llama-3, using its original tokenizer.\nWhile our adaptation methods enhanced Llama-2's Dutch capabilities, we found\nlimited gains when applying the same techniques to Llama-3. This suggests that\nfor ever improving, multilingual foundation models, language adaptation\ntechniques may benefit more from focusing on language-specific posttraining\nrather than on continued pretraining. We hope this work contributes to the\nbroader understanding of adapting LLMs to lower-resource languages, and to the\ndevelopment of Dutch LLMs in particular.",

Secondly, our optimization framework minimizes\nthe need for extensive prototyping, significantly reducing the iterative design\nprocess. The methodology enables the identification of stiffness parameters\nthat are more practical and achievable within current manufacturing\ncapabilities. The proposed approach demonstrates a substantial improvement in\nthe efficiency of prototype development while maintaining the desired\nperformance characteristics. This work represents a step forward in bridging\nthe sim-to-real gap in soft robotics, paving the way towards a faster and more\nreliable deployment of soft robotic systems."

We focus on three types of miscommunications\nthat could happen in real-world dialogues but are underrepresented in the\nbenchmark dataset: misunderstandings, non-understandings and vaguely related\nquestions. Our two-step approach uses a state-of-the-art Large Language Model\n(LLM) to first create the error and secondly the repairing utterance. We\nperform Language Model-based evaluation to ensure the quality of the generated\nutterances. We apply the method to the MultiWOZ dataset and evaluate it both\nqualitatively and empirically as well as with human judges. Our results\nindicate that current LLMs can aid in adding post-hoc miscommunications to\nbenchmark datasets as a form of data augmentation.

However, this swift advancement has also introduced new\nsecurity vulnerabilities. Jailbreaking, a form of attack that induces LLMs to\nproduce harmful content through carefully crafted prompts, presents a\nsignificant challenge to the safe and trustworthy development of LLMs. Previous\njailbreak methods primarily exploited the internal properties or capabilities\nof LLMs, such as optimization-based jailbreak approaches and methods that\nleveraged the model's context-learning abilities. In this paper, we introduce a\nnovel jailbreak method, SQL Injection Jailbreak (SIJ), which targets the\nexternal properties of LLMs, specifically, the way LLMs construct input\nprompts. By injecting jailbreak information into user prompts, SIJ successfully\ninduces the model to output harmful content. Our SIJ method achieves near 100\\%\nattack success rates on five well-known open-source LLMs on the AdvBench, while\nincurring lower time costs compared to previous methods. More importantly, SIJ\nis the first method to exploit the external properties of LLMs for jailbreak\nattacks and exposes a new vulnerability in LLMs that urgently requires\nmitigation. To address this, we propose a simple defense method called\nSelf-Reminder-Key to counter SIJ and demonstrate its effectiveness through\nexperimental results.

However, their computational\ncomplexity, cost, and lack of transparency hinder their direct application for\nspecialised tasks. In fields such as clinical research, acquiring expert\nannotations or prior knowledge about predictive models is often costly and\ntime-consuming. This study proposes the use of LLMs to elicit expert prior\ndistributions for predictive models. This approach also provides an alternative\nto in-context learning, where language models are tasked with making\npredictions directly. In this work, we compare LLM-elicited and uninformative\npriors, evaluate whether LLMs truthfully generate parameter distributions, and\npropose a model selection strategy for in-context learning and prior\nelicitation. Our findings show that LLM-elicited prior parameter distributions\nsignificantly reduce predictive error compared to uninformative priors in\nlow-data settings. Applied to clinical problems, this translates to fewer\nrequired biological samples, lowering cost and resources. Prior elicitation\nalso consistently outperforms and proves more reliable than in-context learning\nat a lower cost, making it a preferred alternative in our setting. We\ndemonstrate the utility of this method across various use cases, including\nclinical applications.

However, their computational\ncomplexity, cost, and lack of transparency hinder their direct application for\nspecialised tasks. In fields such as clinical research, acquiring expert\nannotations or prior knowledge about predictive models is often costly and\ntime-consuming.

The top-ranked\nsegment is then broadcast to all LLMs, encouraging them to generate\nhigher-quality segments in the next round. This approach also allows the base\nLLMs to be plug-and-play, without any training or adaptation, avoiding\ngeneralization limitations.

While LLMs excel in program synthesis, their\ndirect application to ARC yields limited success. To address this, we introduce\nConceptSearch, a novel function-search algorithm that leverages LLMs for\nprogram generation and employs a concept-based scoring method to guide the\nsearch efficiently. Unlike simplistic pixel-based metrics like Hamming\ndistance, ConceptSearch evaluates programs on their ability to capture the\nunderlying transformation concept reflected in the input-output examples. We\nexplore three scoring functions: Hamming distance, a CNN-based scoring\nfunction, and an LLM-based natural language scoring function. Experimental\nresults demonstrate the effectiveness of ConceptSearch, achieving a significant\nperformance improvement over direct prompting with GPT-4. Moreover, our novel\nconcept-based scoring exhibits up to 30% greater efficiency compared to Hamming\ndistance, measured in terms of the number of iterations required to reach the\ncorrect solution. These findings highlight the potential of LLM-driven program\nsearch when integrated with concept-based guidance for tackling challenging\ngeneralization problems like ARC.

Experimental\nresults demonstrate the effectiveness of ConceptSearch, achieving a significant\nperformance improvement over direct prompting with GPT-4. Moreover, our novel\nconcept-based scoring exhibits up to 30% greater efficiency compared to Hamming\ndistance, measured in terms of the number of iterations required to reach the\ncorrect solution. These findings highlight the potential of LLM-driven program\nsearch when integrated with concept-based guidance for tackling challenging\ngeneralization problems like ARC.

However, data analysts\noften encounter two primary challenges: (1) the need to craft SQL queries\nskillfully, and (2) the requirement to generate suitable visualization types\nthat enhance the interpretation of query results. Due to its significance,\nsubstantial research efforts have been made to explore different approaches to\naddress these challenges, including leveraging large language models (LLMs).\nHowever, existing methods fail to meet real-world data exploration requirements\nprimarily due to (1) complex database schema; (2) unclear user intent; (3)\nlimited cross-domain generalization capability; and (4) insufficient end-to-end\ntext-to-visualization capability.\n  This paper presents TiInsight, an automated SQL-based cross-domain\nexploratory data analysis system. First, we propose hierarchical data context\n(i.e., HDC), which leverages LLMs to summarize the contexts related to the\ndatabase schema, which is crucial for open-world EDA systems to generalize\nacross data domains. Second, the EDA system is divided into four components\n(i.e., stages): HDC generation, question clarification and decomposition,\ntext-to-SQL generation (i.e., TiSQL), and data visualization (i.e., TiChart).\nFinally, we implemented an end-to-end EDA system with a user-friendly GUI\ninterface in the production environment at PingCAP. We have also open-sourced\nall APIs of TiInsight to facilitate research within the EDA community. Through\nextensive evaluations by a real-world user study, we demonstrate that TiInsight\noffers remarkable performance compared to human experts. Specifically, TiSQL\nachieves an execution accuracy of 86.3% on the Spider dataset using GPT-4. It\nalso demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on the Bird dataset.",

To tackle these issues, we propose EDiT, an\ninnovative Efficient Distributed Training method that combines a tailored Local\nSGD approach with model sharding techniques to enhance large-scale training\nefficiency. EDiT performs layer-wise parameter synchronization during forward\npass, reducing communication and memory overhead and enabling the overlap of\ncomputation and communication.

Additionally, we introduce A-EDiT, a fully asynchronous variant of\nEDiT that accommodates heterogeneous clusters. Building on EDiT/A-EDiT, we\nconduct a series of experiments to validate large-scale asynchronous training\nfor LLMs, accompanied by comprehensive analyses.

Furthermore,\nMobileViTV2_050-B, our second enhanced model trained on a broader rice leaf\ndataset, demonstrated a 22.12% improvement, reaching 99.6% test accuracy.\nAdditionally, MobileViTV2-A attained an F1-score of 93% across four rice labels\nand a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve ranging from 87% to 97%. In\nterms of resource consumption, our enhanced models reduced the total parameters\nof the baseline CNN model by up to 92.50%, from 14 million to 1.1 million.\nThese results indicate that MobileViTV2_050 not only improves computational\nefficiency through its separable self-attention mechanism but also enhances\nglobal context learning.

Extensive experiments on 4 language modeling benchmarks, including the\nlatest RULER benchmark, demonstrate that HARPE excels in understanding and\nintegrating long-context tasks with single-stage training, matching and even\noutperforming existing multi-stage methods. Our results highlight that HARPE\nsuccessfully breaks the stage barrier for training LLMs with long context\nmodeling capabilities."

Furthermore, we introduce a benchmark of the summarization\nperformance of two general-purpose LLMs and three healthcare-adapted LLMs.\nUsing clinical notes as input, we apply prompting-based (using in-context\nlearning) and fine-tuning-based adaptation strategies to three open-source LLMs\n(Clinical-T5-Large, Llama2-13B, FLAN-UL2) and two proprietary LLMs (GPT-3.5,\nGPT-4).

We further conduct a clinical study with\nfive clinicians, comparing clinician-written and LLM-generated BHCs across 30\nsamples, focusing on their potential to enhance clinical decision-making\nthrough improved summary quality. We observe that the Llama2-13B fine-tuned LLM\noutperforms other domain-adapted models given quantitative evaluation metrics\nof BLEU and BERT-Score.

This paper presents the UniAudio system, which,\nunlike prior task-specific approaches, leverages LLM techniques to generate\nmultiple types of audio (including speech, sounds, music, and singing) with\ngiven input conditions. UniAudio 1) first tokenizes all types of target audio\nalong with other condition modalities, 2) concatenates source-target pair as a\nsingle sequence, and 3) performs next-token prediction using LLM. Also, a\nmulti-scale Transformer model is proposed to handle the overly long sequences\ncaused by the residual vector quantization based neural codec in tokenization.\nTraining of UniAudio is scaled up to 165K hours of audio and 1B parameters,\nbased on all generative tasks, aiming to obtain sufficient prior knowledge not\nonly in the intrinsic properties of audio but also the inter-relationship\nbetween audio and other modalities. Therefore, the trained UniAudio model has\nthe potential to become a foundation model for universal audio generation: it\nshows strong capability in all trained tasks and can seamlessly support new\naudio generation tasks after simple fine-tuning.
