Our\nessential design enables random order by inserting a \"position instruction\ntoken\" before each image token to be predicted, representing the spatial\nlocation of the next image token. Trained on randomly permuted token sequences\n-- a more challenging task than fixed-order generation, RandAR achieves\ncomparable performance to its conventional raster-order counterpart. More\nimportantly, decoder-only transformers trained from random orders acquire new\ncapabilities. For the efficiency bottleneck of AR models, RandAR adopts\nparallel decoding with KV-Cache at inference time, enjoying 2.5x acceleration\nwithout sacrificing generation quality. Additionally, RandAR supports\ninpainting, outpainting and resolution extrapolation in a zero-shot manner.

In this work,\nrather than following prevalent approaches such as linear attention (or SSMs)\nand local attention, we introduce an intermediate design called \\rat between\nrecurrence and attention mechanisms. It partitions the input into chunks,\napplies a simple linear recurrence within each chunk to capture local\ndependencies, and then performs softmax attention across chunks to model\nlong-range interactions. By adjusting the size of the chunk, \\rat enables\nflexible trade-offs, combining the strengths of RNN and attention. Empirically,\nwith a chunk size of 16, the \\rat layer achieves a \\(7\\times\\) improvement in\ntraining speed with 100K token sequences and \\(9\\times\\) in generation at 4K\nsequence length, while maintaining similar or sometimes even better accuracy\ncompared to standard attention. We demonstrate this by training 1.3B parameter\nmodels from scratch and performing large-scale evaluations, including short-\nand long-context benchmarks, as well as supervised fine-tuning~(SFT). We\nfurther propose a hybrid architecture that interleaves \\rat with local\nattention. By combining efficient long-range modeling with strong local\ninteractions, this hybrid design not only improves inference speed and reduces\ncache memory usage compared to attention, but also consistently enhances\nperformance, for example, achieving an average 1 point gain in commonsense\nreasoning tasks, up to 4 points on code tasks, and a 1 point Rouge-L increase\nin a summarization SFT task.

                "summary": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are commonly derived by extending\npre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) with visual capabilities. In this\nwork, we investigate how MLLMs process visual inputs by analyzing their\nattention mechanisms. We reveal a surprising sparsity phenomenon: only a small\nsubset (approximately less than 5%) of attention heads in LLMs actively\ncontribute to visual understanding, termed visual heads. To identify these\nheads efficiently, we design a training-free framework that quantifies\nhead-level visual relevance through targeted response analysis. Building on\nthis discovery, we introduce SparseMM, a KV-Cache optimization strategy that\nallocates asymmetric computation budgets to heads in LLMs based on their visual\nscores, leveraging the sparity of visual heads for accelerating the inference\nof MLLMs. Compared with prior KV-Cache acceleration methods that ignore the\nparticularity of visual, SparseMM prioritizes stress and retaining visual\nsemantics during decoding. Extensive evaluations across mainstream multimodal\nbenchmarks demonstrate that SparseMM achieves superior accuracy-efficiency\ntrade-offs. Notably, SparseMM delivers 1.38x real-time acceleration and 52%\nmemory reduction during generation while maintaining performance parity on\nefficiency test.

                "summary": "Speculative decoding generally dictates having a small, efficient draft model\nthat is either pretrained or distilled offline to a particular target model\nseries, for instance, Llama or Qwen models. However, within online deployment\nsettings, there are two major challenges: 1) usage of a target model that is\nincompatible with the draft model; 2) expectation of latency improvements over\nusage and time. In this work, we propose OmniDraft, a unified framework that\nenables a single draft model to operate with any target model and adapt\ndynamically to user data. We introduce an online n-gram cache with hybrid\ndistillation fine-tuning to address the cross-vocabulary mismatch across draft\nand target models; and further improve decoding speed by leveraging adaptive\ndrafting techniques. OmniDraft is particularly suitable for on-device LLM\napplications where model cost, efficiency and user customization are the major\npoints of contention. This further highlights the need to tackle the above\nchallenges and motivates the \\textit{``one drafter for all''} paradigm. We\nshowcase the proficiency of the OmniDraft framework by performing online\nlearning on math reasoning, coding and text generation tasks. Notably,\nOmniDraft enables a single Llama-68M model to pair with various target models\nincluding Vicuna-7B, Qwen2-7B and Llama3-8B models for speculative decoding;\nand additionally provides up to 1.5-2x speedup.",

                    "value": "Speculative decoding generally dictates having a small, efficient draft model\nthat is either pretrained or distilled offline to a particular target model\nseries, for instance, Llama or Qwen models. However, within online deployment\nsettings, there are two major challenges: 1) usage of a target model that is\nincompatible with the draft model; 2) expectation of latency improvements over\nusage and time. In this work, we propose OmniDraft, a unified framework that\nenables a single draft model to operate with any target model and adapt\ndynamically to user data. We introduce an online n-gram cache with hybrid\ndistillation fine-tuning to address the cross-vocabulary mismatch across draft\nand target models; and further improve decoding speed by leveraging adaptive\ndrafting techniques. OmniDraft is particularly suitable for on-device LLM\napplications where model cost, efficiency and user customization are the major\npoints of contention. This further highlights the need to tackle the above\nchallenges and motivates the \\textit{``one drafter for all''} paradigm. We\nshowcase the proficiency of the OmniDraft framework by performing online\nlearning on math reasoning, coding and text generation tasks. Notably,\nOmniDraft enables a single Llama-68M model to pair with various target models\nincluding Vicuna-7B, Qwen2-7B and Llama3-8B models for speculative decoding;\nand additionally provides up to 1.5-2x speedup."

                "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained significant attention due to their\nversatility across a wide array of applications. Fine-tuning LLMs with\nparameter-efficient adapters, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), enables these\nmodels to efficiently adapt to downstream tasks without extensive retraining.\nDeploying fine-tuned LLMs on multi-tenant edge devices offers substantial\nbenefits, such as reduced latency, enhanced privacy, and personalized\nresponses. However, serving LLMs efficiently on resource-constrained edge\ndevices presents critical challenges, including the complexity of adapter\nselection for different tasks and memory overhead from frequent adapter\nswapping. Moreover, given the multiple requests in multi-tenant settings,\nprocessing requests sequentially results in underutilization of computational\nresources and increased latency. This paper introduces EdgeLoRA, an efficient\nsystem for serving LLMs on edge devices in multi-tenant environments. EdgeLoRA\nincorporates three key innovations: (1) an adaptive adapter selection mechanism\nto streamline the adapter configuration process; (2) heterogeneous memory\nmanagement, leveraging intelligent adapter caching and pooling to mitigate\nmemory operation overhead; and (3) batch LoRA inference, enabling efficient\nbatch processing to significantly reduce computational latency. Comprehensive\nevaluations using the Llama3.1-8B model demonstrate that EdgeLoRA significantly\noutperforms the status quo (i.e., llama.cpp) in terms of both latency and\nthroughput. The results demonstrate that EdgeLoRA can achieve up to a 4 times\nboost in throughput. Even more impressively, it can serve several orders of\nmagnitude more adapters simultaneously. These results highlight EdgeLoRA's\npotential to transform edge deployment of LLMs in multi-tenant scenarios,\noffering a scalable and efficient solution for resource-constrained\nenvironments.",

                    "value": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained significant attention due to their\nversatility across a wide array of applications. Fine-tuning LLMs with\nparameter-efficient adapters, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), enables these\nmodels to efficiently adapt to downstream tasks without extensive retraining.\nDeploying fine-tuned LLMs on multi-tenant edge devices offers substantial\nbenefits, such as reduced latency, enhanced privacy, and personalized\nresponses. However, serving LLMs efficiently on resource-constrained edge\ndevices presents critical challenges, including the complexity of adapter\nselection for different tasks and memory overhead from frequent adapter\nswapping. Moreover, given the multiple requests in multi-tenant settings,\nprocessing requests sequentially results in underutilization of computational\nresources and increased latency.

Besides, to reduce communication cost, PAE MobiLLM develops a\none-token (i.e., ``pivot'' token) activation shortcut that transmits only a\nsingle activation dimension instead of full activation matrices to guide the\nside network tuning. Last but not least, PAE MobiLLM introduces the additive\nadapter side-network design which makes the server train the adapter modules\nbased on device-defined prediction differences rather than raw ground-truth\nlabels.

However,\nexisting approaches introduce unnecessary complexity: they cache the full\nsampling trajectory, depend on differentiable reward models or large preference\ndatasets, or require specialized guidance techniques. Motivated by the \"golden\nnoise\" hypothesis -- that certain initial noise samples can consistently yield\nsuperior alignment -- we introduce Noise PPO, a minimalist RL algorithm that\nleaves the pre-trained diffusion model entirely frozen and learns a\nprompt-conditioned initial noise generator. Our approach requires no trajectory\nstorage, reward backpropagation, or complex guidance tricks. Extensive\nexperiments show that optimizing the initial noise distribution consistently\nimproves alignment and sample quality over the original model, with the most\nsignificant gains at low inference steps. As the number of inference steps\nincreases, the benefit of noise optimization diminishes but remains present.\nThese findings clarify the scope and limitations of the golden noise hypothesis\nand reinforce the practical value of minimalist RL fine-tuning for diffusion\nmodels.",

                    "value": "Recent work uses reinforcement learning (RL) to fine-tune text-to-image\ndiffusion models, improving text-image alignment and sample quality. However,\nexisting approaches introduce unnecessary complexity: they cache the full\nsampling trajectory, depend on differentiable reward models or large preference\ndatasets, or require specialized guidance techniques. Motivated by the \"golden\nnoise\" hypothesis -- that certain initial noise samples can consistently yield\nsuperior alignment -- we introduce Noise PPO, a minimalist RL algorithm that\nleaves the pre-trained diffusion model entirely frozen and learns a\nprompt-conditioned initial noise generator. Our approach requires no trajectory\nstorage, reward backpropagation, or complex guidance tricks. Extensive\nexperiments show that optimizing the initial noise distribution consistently\nimproves alignment and sample quality over the original model, with the most\nsignificant gains at low inference steps. As the number of inference steps\nincreases, the benefit of noise optimization diminishes but remains present.\nThese findings clarify the scope and limitations of the golden noise hypothesis\nand reinforce the practical value of minimalist RL fine-tuning for diffusion\nmodels."

These\nprocessors exchange massive amounts of data at cache-line granularity,\nprompting the adoption of new interconnect protocols like CXL, NVLink, and\nUALink, designed for high bandwidth and small payloads. However, the increasing\ntransfer rates of these protocols heighten susceptibility to errors. While\nmechanisms like Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) and Forward Error Correction\n(FEC) are standard for reliable data transmission, scaling chip interconnects\nto multi-node configurations introduces new challenges, particularly in\nmanaging silently dropped flits in switching devices. This paper introduces\nImplicit Sequence Number (ISN), a novel mechanism that ensures precise flit\ndrop detection and in-order delivery without adding header overhead.\nAdditionally, we propose Reliability Extended Link (RXL), an extension of CXL\nthat incorporates ISN to support scalable, reliable multi-node interconnects\nwhile maintaining compatibility with the existing flit structure. By elevating\nCRC to a transport-layer mechanism for end-to-end data and sequence integrity,\nand relying on FEC for link-layer error correction and detection, RXL delivers\nrobust reliability and scalability without compromising bandwidth efficiency.",

These\nprocessors exchange massive amounts of data at cache-line granularity,\nprompting the adoption of new interconnect protocols like CXL, NVLink, and\nUALink, designed for high bandwidth and small payloads. However, the increasing\ntransfer rates of these protocols heighten susceptibility to errors. While\nmechanisms like Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) and Forward Error Correction\n(FEC) are standard for reliable data transmission, scaling chip interconnects\nto multi-node configurations introduces new challenges, particularly in\nmanaging silently dropped flits in switching devices. This paper introduces\nImplicit Sequence Number (ISN), a novel mechanism that ensures precise flit\ndrop detection and in-order delivery without adding header overhead.\nAdditionally, we propose Reliability Extended Link (RXL), an extension of CXL\nthat incorporates ISN to support scalable, reliable multi-node interconnects\nwhile maintaining compatibility with the existing flit structure. By elevating\nCRC to a transport-layer mechanism for end-to-end data and sequence integrity,\nand relying on FEC for link-layer error correction and detection, RXL delivers\nrobust reliability and scalability without compromising bandwidth efficiency."

                "summary": "Long-video understanding (LVU) remains a severe challenge for existing\nmultimodal large language models (MLLMs), primarily due to the prohibitive\ncomputational cost. Recent approaches have explored KV compression to mitigate\nthis issue, but they often suffer from significant information loss at high\ncompression ratios. In this paper, we introduce Video-X^2L, which flexibly\npreserves critical video information for each LVU task. Video-X^2L involves two\nkey operations. The first one is called bi-level KV compression. During the\nMLLM's pre-filling stage, Video-X^2L generates two types of compressed KVs:\nlow-compression KVs (L-KVs) to capture fine-grained video details and\nhigh-compression KVs (H-KVs) to offer compact video representations.

                    "value": "Long-video understanding (LVU) remains a severe challenge for existing\nmultimodal large language models (MLLMs), primarily due to the prohibitive\ncomputational cost. Recent approaches have explored KV compression to mitigate\nthis issue, but they often suffer from significant information loss at high\ncompression ratios. In this paper, we introduce Video-X^2L, which flexibly\npreserves critical video information for each LVU task. Video-X^2L involves two\nkey operations. The first one is called bi-level KV compression. During the\nMLLM's pre-filling stage, Video-X^2L generates two types of compressed KVs:\nlow-compression KVs (L-KVs) to capture fine-grained video details and\nhigh-compression KVs (H-KVs) to offer compact video representations. The second\none is called selective KV re-loading. During the MLLM's decoding stage,\nVideo-X^2L selectively re-loads L-KVs for the most critical video chunks while\nusing H-KVs for other less important ones.

Low-rank\napproximation offers a promising compression solution, yet existing approaches\nhave two main limitations: (1) They focus on minimizing the output error of\nindividual linear layers, without considering the architectural characteristics\nof Transformers, and (2) they decompose a large weight matrix into two small\nlow-rank matrices. Consequently, these methods often fall short compared to\nother compression techniques like pruning and quantization, and introduce\nruntime overhead such as the extra GEMM kernel launches for decomposed small\nmatrices. To address these limitations, we propose $\\tt A^\\tt 3$, a\npost-training low-rank approximation framework. $\\tt A^\\tt 3$ splits a\nTransformer layer into three functional components, namely $\\tt QK$, $\\tt OV$,\nand $\\tt MLP$. For each component, $\\tt A^\\tt 3$ provides an analytical\nsolution that reduces the hidden dimension size inside each component while\nminimizing the component's functional loss ($\\it i.e.$, error in attention\nscores, attention outputs, and MLP outputs). This approach directly reduces\nmodel sizes, KV cache sizes, and FLOPs without introducing any runtime\noverheads. In addition, it provides a new narrative in advancing the\noptimization problem from singular linear layer loss optimization toward\nimproved end-to-end performance. Through extensive experiments, we show that\n$\\tt A^\\tt 3$ maintains superior performance compared to SoTAs. For example,\nunder the same reduction budget in computation and memory, our low-rank\napproximated LLaMA 3.1-70B achieves a perplexity of 4.69 on WikiText-2,\noutperforming the previous SoTA's 7.87 by 3.18.

Consequently, these methods often fall short compared to\nother compression techniques like pruning and quantization, and introduce\nruntime overhead such as the extra GEMM kernel launches for decomposed small\nmatrices. To address these limitations, we propose $\\tt A^\\tt 3$, a\npost-training low-rank approximation framework. $\\tt A^\\tt 3$ splits a\nTransformer layer into three functional components, namely $\\tt QK$, $\\tt OV$,\nand $\\tt MLP$. For each component, $\\tt A^\\tt 3$ provides an analytical\nsolution that reduces the hidden dimension size inside each component while\nminimizing the component's functional loss ($\\it i.e.$, error in attention\nscores, attention outputs, and MLP outputs). This approach directly reduces\nmodel sizes, KV cache sizes, and FLOPs without introducing any runtime\noverheads. In addition, it provides a new narrative in advancing the\noptimization problem from singular linear layer loss optimization toward\nimproved end-to-end performance. Through extensive experiments, we show that\n$\\tt A^\\tt 3$ maintains superior performance compared to SoTAs. For example,\nunder the same reduction budget in computation and memory, our low-rank\napproximated LLaMA 3.1-70B achieves a perplexity of 4.69 on WikiText-2,\noutperforming the previous SoTA's 7.87 by 3.18. We also demonstrate the\nversatility of $\\tt A^\\tt 3$, including KV cache compression, quantization, and\nmixed-rank assignments for enhanced performance."

Furthermore, the number of ionizing photon\ninteractions in gold nanoparticles in a cell near the surface is lower by a\nfactor of about 2 than for cells at 5 mm and 1 cm depth. Using the average dose\nin voxels of size in the order of 200 nm for assessing cell survival with the\nlocal effect model (LEM) leads to an underestimation of the number of lesions\nfrom a single ionized AuNP by roughly two orders of magnitude and thus to an\noverestimation of cell survival. The effect of cell geometry on the survival\nrate was examined for approximate cell geometries and 100 kV x-ray irradiation,\nfor which the probability of photon interaction in gold nanoparticles is by\nmore than two orders of magnitude higher than for Co-60 irradiation.

We present\nGainSight, a profiling framework that analyzes fine-grained memory access\npatterns and data lifetimes in domain-specific accelerators. By instrumenting\nretargetable architectural simulator backends with application- and\ndevice-agnostic analytical frontends, GainSight aligns workload-specific\ntraffic and lifetime metrics with mockups of emerging memory devices, informing\nsystem-level heterogeneous memory design. We also present a set of case studies\non MLPerf Inference and PolyBench workloads using simulated GPU and systolic\narray architectures, highlighting the utility of GainSight and the insights it\nprovides: (1) 64% of L1 and 18% of L2 GPU cache accesses, and 79% of systolic\narray scratchpad accesses across profiled workloads are short-lived and\nsuitable for silicon-based gain cell RAM (Si-GCRAM); (2) Heterogeneous memory\narrays that augment SRAM with GCRAM can reduce active energy consumption by up\nto 66.8%. To facilitate further research in this domain, GainSight is open\nsource at https://gainsight.stanford.edu/."

We observe that quantizing\nthe KV cache of different tokens has varying impacts on the quality of\nattention outputs. To systematically investigate this phenomenon, we perform\nforward error propagation analysis on attention and propose the Anchor Score\n(AnS) that quantifies the sensitivity of each token's KV cache to\nquantization-induced error. Our analysis reveals significant disparities in AnS\nacross tokens, suggesting that preserving a small subset with full precision\n(FP16) of high-AnS tokens can greatly mitigate accuracy loss in aggressive\nquantization scenarios. Based on this insight, we introduce AnTKV, a novel\nframework that leverages Anchor Token-aware Vector Quantization to compress the\nKV cache. Furthermore, to support efficient deployment, we design and develop a\ntriton kernel that is fully compatible with FlashAttention, enabling fast\nonline Anchor Token selection. AnTKV enables LLaMA-3-8B to handle context\nlengths up to 840K tokens on a single 80GB A100 GPU, while achieving up to 3.5x\nhigher decoding throughput compared to the FP16 baseline. Our experiment\nresults demonstrate that AnTKV matches or outperforms prior works such as KIVI,\nSKVQ, KVQuant, and CQ under 4-bit settings. More importantly, AnTKV achieves\nsignificantly lower perplexity under ultra-low-bit quantization on Mistral-7B,\nwith only 6.32 at 1-bit and 8.87 at 0.375-bit, compared to the FP16 baseline of\n4.73.",

We introduce\n\\textbf{Mem4Nav}, a hierarchical spatial-cognition long-short memory system\nthat can augment any VLN backbone.

At each step, STM retrieval sharply\nprunes dynamic context, and, when deeper history is needed, LTM tokens are\ndecoded losslessly to reconstruct past embeddings. Evaluated on Touchdown and\nMap2Seq across three backbones (modular, state-of-the-art VLN with prompt-based\nLLM, and state-of-the-art VLN with strided-attention MLLM), Mem4Nav yields 7-13\npp gains in Task Completion, sufficient SPD reduction, and >10 pp nDTW\nimprovement.

The widespread usage of sparse data has inspired many in-memory and\non-disk storage formats, but the only widely adopted storage specifications are\nthe Matrix Market and FROSTT file formats, which both use ASCII text. Due to\nthe inefficiency of text storage, these files typically have larger file sizes\nand longer parsing times than binary storage formats, which directly store an\nin-memory representation to disk. This can be a major bottleneck; since sparse\ncomputation is often bandwidth-bound, the cost of loading or storing a matrix\nto disk often exceeds the cost of performing a sparse computation. While it is\ncommon practice for practitioners to develop their own, custom, non-portable\nbinary formats for high-performance sparse matrix storage, there is currently\nno cross-platform binary sparse matrix storage format. We present Binsparse, a\ncross-platform binary sparse matrix and tensor format specification. Binsparse\nis a modular, embeddable format, consisting of a JSON descriptor, which\ndescribes the matrix or tensor dimensions, type, and format, and a series of\nbinary arrays, which can be stored in all modern binary containers, such as\nHDF5, Zarr, or NPZ. We provide several reference implementations of Binsparse\nspanning 5 languages, 5 frameworks, and 4 binary containers. We evaluate our\nBinsparse format on every matrix in the SuiteSparse Matrix Collection and a\nselection of tensors from the FROSTT collection.

We first introduce additive quantization with a\nlightweight encoder and codebook to compress the KV cache, which can be decoded\nvia simple matrix multiplication. To further reduce computational costs during\ndecoding, we design the codebook to be commutative with Rotary Position\nEmbedding (RoPE) and train it using an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm.\nThis enables efficient integration of decoding into the self-attention\nmechanism. Our approach achieves high accuracy with additive quantization and\nlow overhead via the RoPE-commutative codebook.

                "summary": "The emergence of long-context large language models (LLMs) offers a promising\nalternative to traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for processing\nextensive documents. However, the computational overhead of long-context\ninference presents significant efficiency challenges. While Speculative\nDecoding (SD) traditionally accelerates inference using smaller draft models,\nits effectiveness diminishes substantially in long-context scenarios due to\nmemory-bound KV cache operations. We introduce Retrieval-Augmented Speculative\nDecoding (RAPID), which leverages RAG for both accelerating and enhancing\ngeneration quality in long-context inference.

While Speculative\nDecoding (SD) traditionally accelerates inference using smaller draft models,\nits effectiveness diminishes substantially in long-context scenarios due to\nmemory-bound KV cache operations.

We show that vectors with compression\nratios up to x1500 exist, which highlights two orders of magnitude gap between\nexisting and practically attainable solutions. Furthermore, we empirically show\nthat the compression limits are determined not by the length of the input but\nby the amount of uncertainty to be reduced, namely, the cross-entropy loss on\nthis sequence without any conditioning.

OpenAgentSafety is\ndesigned for extensibility, allowing researchers to add tools, tasks, websites,\nand adversarial strategies with minimal effort. It combines rule-based analysis\nwith LLM-as-judge assessments to detect both overt and subtle unsafe behaviors.\nEmpirical analysis of five prominent LLMs in agentic scenarios reveals unsafe\nbehavior in 51.2% of safety-vulnerable tasks with Claude-Sonnet-3.7, to 72.7%\nwith o3-mini, highlighting critical safety vulnerabilities and the need for\nstronger safeguards before real-world deployment.",

The approach models autonomous agents that identify risks,\nactivate risk detection tools, within specific use-cases and facilitate\ncontinuous monitoring and reporting to enhance AI safety, and user\nexpectations. The code is available at\nhttps://github.com/IBM/risk-atlas-nexus-demos/tree/main/gaf-guard."

To address this, we propose Chain-of-Reasoning Embedding\n(CoRE), a series of hidden states in latent space to enable label-free\nself-evaluation on intermediate reasoning steps of LRMs, so as to enhance\nmetacognition abilities for improved reasoning efficiency.

Experiments across multiple backbone models and benchmarks show that MeCo\nreliably detects LLMs' internal cognitive signals and significantly improves\ntool-use decision-making."

Among 75 participants providing comparative\nfeedback, 71% reported greater trust in the chatbot, highlighting clearer\nstructure, interpretive guidance, and a supportive tone. Mean ratings (0-10)\nwere 8.4 for comfort, 7.7 for voice clarity, 7.6 for handling sensitive topics,\nand 7.4 for recommendation helpfulness; the latter varied significantly by\nemployment status and prior mental-health service use (p < 0.05). Overall,\n87.1% expressed willingness to reuse or recommend HopeBot. These findings\ndemonstrate voice-based LLM chatbots can feasibly serve as scalable, low-burden\nadjuncts for routine depression screening.",

Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves\nnear-perfect retention of prior knowledge while seamlessly integrating new\ninformation, effectively overcoming the core limitations of existing methods.\nOur code will be released after acceptance."

The emission intensity of\nthe bubble is nearly independent of the tracing isotopolog, suggesting a very\nrich observable chemistry, as long as its signal can be deblended from the\nextended disk emission.

Spatial capture-recapture (SCR) models\nprovide estimates of population size and spatial density from data collected\nfrom remote sensors such as camera traps. Such data contain spatial correlation\nbetween observations of the same individual, which SCR models partly account\nfor through a latent individual-specific activity centre, a location near which\nthe individual is more likely detected. However, SCR models assume that the\nobservations of an individual are independent over time and space, conditional\non its activity centre, so that observed sightings at a given time and location\ndo not influence the probability of being seen at future times and/or\nlocations. This assumption is ecologically unrealistic given the smooth\nmovement of animals over space through time.

Unfortunately, the current\npractice for constructing such neurosymbolic AR systems is an ad hoc\nprogramming model that does not have the strong guarantees of traditional\nsymbolic algorithms, nor a deep enough synchronization of neural networks and\nsymbolic reasoning to unlock the full potential of LLM-powered reasoning.

SLMs offer lightweight and\ncost-effective alternatives to Large Language Models (LLMs), making them\nattractive for use in resource-constrained environments. However, empirical\nunderstanding of SLMs, particularly their capabilities, limitations, and\nperformance trade-offs in code generation remains limited. This study presents\na comprehensive empirical evaluation of 20 open-source SLMs ranging from 0.4B\nto 10B parameters on five diverse code-related benchmarks (HumanEval, MBPP,\nMercury, HumanEvalPack, and CodeXGLUE). The models are assessed along three\ndimensions: i) functional correctness of generated code, ii) computational\nefficiency and iii) performance across multiple programming languages. The\nfindings of this study reveal that several compact SLMs achieve competitive\nresults while maintaining a balance between performance and efficiency, making\nthem viable for deployment in resource-constrained environments. However,\nachieving further improvements in accuracy requires switching to larger models.\nThese models generally outperform their smaller counterparts, but they require\nmuch more computational power. We observe that for 10% performance\nimprovements, models can require nearly a 4x increase in VRAM consumption,\nhighlighting a trade-off between effectiveness and scalability. Besides, the\nmultilingual performance analysis reveals that SLMs tend to perform better in\nlanguages such as Python, Java, and PHP, while exhibiting relatively weaker\nperformance in Go, C++, and Ruby. However, statistical analysis suggests these\ndifferences are not significant, indicating a generalizability of SLMs across\nprogramming languages.

The proposed framework\nprovides an easy-to-implement, automated TTnet-based design toolbox with an\nunderlying (python-based) open-source Concrete implementation (CPU-based and\nimplementing lookup tables) for inference over encrypted data. Experimental\nevaluation shows that TT-TFHE greatly outperforms in terms of time and accuracy\nall Homomorphic Encryption (HE) set-ups on three tabular datasets, all other\nfeatures being equal. On image datasets such as MNIST and CIFAR-10, we show\nthat TT-TFHE consistently and largely outperforms other TFHE set-ups and is\ncompetitive against other HE variants such as BFV or CKKS (while maintaining\nthe same level of 128-bit encryption security guarantees). In addition, our\nsolutions present a very low memory footprint (down to dozens of MBs for\nMNIST), which is in sharp contrast with other HE set-ups that typically require\ntens to hundreds of GBs of memory per user (in addition to their communication\noverheads).

                    "value": "This paper presents TT-TFHE, a deep neural network Fully Homomorphic\nEncryption (FHE) framework that effectively scales Torus FHE (TFHE) usage to\ntabular and image datasets using a recent family of convolutional neural\nnetworks called Truth-Table Neural Networks (TTnet). The proposed framework\nprovides an easy-to-implement, automated TTnet-based design toolbox with an\nunderlying (python-based) open-source Concrete implementation (CPU-based and\nimplementing lookup tables) for inference over encrypted data. Experimental\nevaluation shows that TT-TFHE greatly outperforms in terms of time and accuracy\nall Homomorphic Encryption (HE) set-ups on three tabular datasets, all other\nfeatures being equal. On image datasets such as MNIST and CIFAR-10, we show\nthat TT-TFHE consistently and largely outperforms other TFHE set-ups and is\ncompetitive against other HE variants such as BFV or CKKS (while maintaining\nthe same level of 128-bit encryption security guarantees). In addition, our\nsolutions present a very low memory footprint (down to dozens of MBs for\nMNIST), which is in sharp contrast with other HE set-ups that typically require\ntens to hundreds of GBs of memory per user (in addition to their communication\noverheads). This is the first work presenting a fully practical solution of\nprivate inference (i.e. a few seconds for inference time and a few dozens MBs\nof memory) on both tabular datasets and MNIST, that can easily scale to\nmultiple threads and users on server side."

To systematically examine the\npredictive capabilities and affective biases of LLMs in ROP risk\nstratification, we propose Affective-ROPTester, an automated evaluation\nframework incorporating three prompting strategies: Instruction-based,\nChain-of-Thought (CoT), and In-Context Learning (ICL).

Empirical results derived from the CROP dataset yield\ntwo principal observations. First, LLMs demonstrate limited efficacy in ROP\nrisk prediction when operating solely on intrinsic knowledge, yet exhibit\nmarked performance gains when augmented with structured external inputs.\nSecond, affective biases are evident in the model outputs, with a consistent\ninclination toward overestimating medium- and high-risk cases. Third, compared\nto negative emotions, positive emotional framing contributes to mitigating\npredictive bias in model outputs.

Network quantization, as a standard compression\nand acceleration technique, reduces storage costs and enables potential\ninference acceleration by discretizing network weights and activations into a\nfinite set of integer values. However, current quantization methods are often\ncomplex and sensitive, requiring extensive task-specific hyperparameters, where\neven a single misconfiguration can impair model performance, limiting\ngenerality across different models and tasks. In this paper, we propose\nQuantization without Tears (QwT), a method that simultaneously achieves\nquantization speed, accuracy, simplicity, and generality. The key insight of\nQwT is to incorporate a lightweight additional structure into the quantized\nnetwork to mitigate information loss during quantization. This structure\nconsists solely of a small set of linear layers, keeping the method simple and\nefficient. More importantly, it provides a closed-form solution, allowing us to\nimprove accuracy effortlessly under 2 minutes. Extensive experiments across\nvarious vision, language, and multimodal tasks demonstrate that QwT is both\nhighly effective and versatile. In fact, our approach offers a robust solution\nfor network quantization that combines simplicity, accuracy, and adaptability,\nwhich provides new insights for the design of novel quantization paradigms.

SQLBarber\nintroduces (i) a declarative interface for users to effortlessly generate\ncustomized SQL templates, (ii) an LLM-powered pipeline augmented with a\nself-correction module that profiles, refines, and prunes SQL templates based\non query costs, and (iii) a Bayesian Optimizer to efficiently explore different\npredicate values and identify a set of queries that satisfy the target cost\ndistribution. We construct and open-source ten benchmarks of varying difficulty\nlevels and target query cost distributions based on real-world statistics from\nSnowflake and Amazon Redshift.

We introduce MedGemma, a collection of medical\nvision-language foundation models based on Gemma 3 4B and 27B. MedGemma\ndemonstrates advanced medical understanding and reasoning on images and text,\nsignificantly exceeding the performance of similar-sized generative models and\napproaching the performance of task-specific models, while maintaining the\ngeneral capabilities of the Gemma 3 base models. For out-of-distribution tasks,\nMedGemma achieves 2.6-10% improvement on medical multimodal question answering,\n15.5-18.1% improvement on chest X-ray finding classification, and 10.8%\nimprovement on agentic evaluations compared to the base models. Fine-tuning\nMedGemma further improves performance in subdomains, reducing errors in\nelectronic health record information retrieval by 50% and reaching comparable\nperformance to existing specialized state-of-the-art methods for pneumothorax\nclassification and histopathology patch classification. We additionally\nintroduce MedSigLIP, a medically-tuned vision encoder derived from SigLIP.\nMedSigLIP powers the visual understanding capabilities of MedGemma and as an\nencoder achieves comparable or better performance than specialized medical\nimage encoders. Taken together, the MedGemma collection provides a strong\nfoundation of medical image and text capabilities, with potential to\nsignificantly accelerate medical research and development of downstream\napplications.

Additionally, we present\nseveral case studies to highlight SAGE's qualitative effectiveness over\ncommercial software and Large Language Models (LLMs)."

Our benchmark, Daily Oracle, automatically generates\nquestion-answer (QA) pairs from daily news, challenging LLMs to predict\n\"future\" event outcomes. Our findings reveal that as pre-training data becomes\noutdated, LLM performance degrades over time. While Retrieval Augmented\nGeneration (RAG) has the potential to enhance prediction accuracy, the\nperformance degradation pattern persists, highlighting the need for continuous\nmodel updates. Code and data are available at\nhttps://agenticlearning.ai/daily-oracle."

By leveraging hierarchical reinforcement learning to model the\nstructured phases of dialogue and employ meta-learning to enhance adaptability\nacross diverse user profiles, our approach enhances adaptability and\nefficiency, enabling the system to learn from limited data, transition fluidly\nbetween dialogue phases, and personalize responses to heterogeneous patient\nneeds. We apply our framework to Motivational Interviews, aiming to foster\nbehavior change, and demonstrate that the proposed dialogue manager outperforms\na state-of-the-art LLM baseline in terms of reward, showing a potential benefit\nof conditioning LLMs to create open-ended dialogue systems with specific goals."

However, real-world surgical applications demand\ndexterous manipulation over extended durations and generalization to the\ninherent variability of human tissue. These challenges remain difficult to\naddress using existing logic-based or conventional end-to-end learning\napproaches. To address this gap, we propose a hierarchical framework for\nperforming dexterous, long-horizon surgical steps. Our approach utilizes a\nhigh-level policy for task planning and a low-level policy for generating robot\ntrajectories. The high-level planner plans in language space, generating\ntask-level or corrective instructions that guide the robot through the\nlong-horizon steps and correct for the low-level policy's errors. We validate\nour framework through ex vivo experiments on cholecystectomy, a\ncommonly-practiced minimally invasive procedure, and conduct ablation studies\nto evaluate key components of the system. Our method achieves a 100\\% success\nrate across eight unseen ex vivo gallbladders, operating fully autonomously\nwithout human intervention. This work demonstrates step-level autonomy in a\nsurgical procedure, marking a milestone toward clinical deployment of\nautonomous surgical systems.",

To support further research in efficient and interpretable\nText-to-SQL modeling, we release two curated datasets: (i) a collection of\n5,024 reasoning traces with varying context lengths, and (ii) a\npositive-sampled corpus of 36,356 corpus of weakly supervised queries, each\nannotated with six semantically diverse reasoning paths. Together, these\ncontributions advance scalable, execution-aligned Text-to-SQL generation."

We introduce Feedback-Refined Agent\nMethodology (FRAME), a novel framework that enhances medical paper generation\nthrough iterative refinement and structured feedback. Our approach comprises\nthree key innovations: (1) A structured dataset construction method that\ndecomposes 4,287 medical papers into essential research components through\niterative refinement; (2) A tripartite architecture integrating Generator,\nEvaluator, and Reflector agents that progressively improve content quality\nthrough metric-driven feedback; and (3) A comprehensive evaluation framework\nthat combines statistical metrics with human-grounded benchmarks. Experimental\nresults demonstrate FRAME's effectiveness, achieving significant improvements\nover conventional approaches across multiple models (9.91% average gain with\nDeepSeek V3, comparable improvements with GPT-4o Mini) and evaluation\ndimensions. Human evaluation confirms that FRAME-generated papers achieve\nquality comparable to human-authored works, with particular strength in\nsynthesizing future research directions. The results demonstrated our work\ncould efficiently assist medical research by building a robust foundation for\nautomated medical research paper generation while maintaining rigorous academic\nstandards.",

We introduce Feedback-Refined Agent\nMethodology (FRAME), a novel framework that enhances medical paper generation\nthrough iterative refinement and structured feedback. Our approach comprises\nthree key innovations: (1) A structured dataset construction method that\ndecomposes 4,287 medical papers into essential research components through\niterative refinement; (2) A tripartite architecture integrating Generator,\nEvaluator, and Reflector agents that progressively improve content quality\nthrough metric-driven feedback; and (3) A comprehensive evaluation framework\nthat combines statistical metrics with human-grounded benchmarks. Experimental\nresults demonstrate FRAME's effectiveness, achieving significant improvements\nover conventional approaches across multiple models (9.91% average gain with\nDeepSeek V3, comparable improvements with GPT-4o Mini) and evaluation\ndimensions. Human evaluation confirms that FRAME-generated papers achieve\nquality comparable to human-authored works, with particular strength in\nsynthesizing future research directions. The results demonstrated our work\ncould efficiently assist medical research by building a robust foundation for\nautomated medical research paper generation while maintaining rigorous academic\nstandards."

While existing graph-aware calibration methods seek\nto mitigate this limitation, they primarily depend on coarse one-hop\nstatistics, such as neighbor-predicted confidence, or latent node embeddings,\nthereby neglecting the fine-grained structural heterogeneity inherent in graph\ntopology. In this work, we propose Wavelet-Aware Temperature Scaling (WATS), a\npost-hoc calibration framework that assigns node-specific temperatures based on\ntunable heat-kernel graph wavelet features. Specifically, WATS harnesses the\nscalability and topology sensitivity of graph wavelets to refine confidence\nestimates, all without necessitating model retraining or access to neighboring\nlogits or predictions. Extensive evaluations across seven benchmark datasets\nwith varying graph structures and two GNN backbones demonstrate that WATS\nachieves the lowest Expected Calibration Error (ECE) among all compared\nmethods, outperforming both classical and graph-specific baselines by up to\n42.3\\% in ECE and reducing calibration variance by 17.24\\% on average compared\nwith graph-specific methods. Moreover, WATS remains computationally efficient,\nscaling well across graphs of diverse sizes and densities. Code will be\nreleased based on publication.",

This paper offers a comprehensive introduction to\nHiBayES, including illustrative examples, comparisons to conventional\nstatistical methods, and practical guidance for implementing multilevel\nBayesian GLMs. Additionally, we provide a HiBayES software package [4] (Beta\nversion) for out-of-the-box implementation."

This study presents\na comprehensive empirical evaluation of 20 open-source SLMs ranging from 0.4B\nto 10B parameters on five diverse code-related benchmarks (HumanEval, MBPP,\nMercury, HumanEvalPack, and CodeXGLUE). The models are assessed along three\ndimensions: i) functional correctness of generated code, ii) computational\nefficiency and iii) performance across multiple programming languages. The\nfindings of this study reveal that several compact SLMs achieve competitive\nresults while maintaining a balance between performance and efficiency, making\nthem viable for deployment in resource-constrained environments.

To systematically examine the\npredictive capabilities and affective biases of LLMs in ROP risk\nstratification, we propose Affective-ROPTester, an automated evaluation\nframework incorporating three prompting strategies: Instruction-based,\nChain-of-Thought (CoT), and In-Context Learning (ICL). The Instruction scheme\nassesses LLMs' intrinsic knowledge and associated biases, whereas the CoT and\nICL schemes leverage external medical knowledge to enhance predictive accuracy.\nCrucially, we integrate emotional elements at the prompt level to investigate\nhow different affective framings influence the model's ability to predict ROP\nand its bias patterns. Empirical results derived from the CROP dataset yield\ntwo principal observations. First, LLMs demonstrate limited efficacy in ROP\nrisk prediction when operating solely on intrinsic knowledge, yet exhibit\nmarked performance gains when augmented with structured external inputs.\nSecond, affective biases are evident in the model outputs, with a consistent\ninclination toward overestimating medium- and high-risk cases. Third, compared\nto negative emotions, positive emotional framing contributes to mitigating\npredictive bias in model outputs. These findings highlight the critical role of\naffect-sensitive prompt engineering in enhancing diagnostic reliability and\nemphasize the utility of Affective-ROPTester as a framework for evaluating and\nmitigating affective bias in clinical language modeling systems.",

We present two\nillustrative use cases: the first demonstrates the Gem's multimodal ability to\nanalyze a student's hand-drawn force diagram and apply notational rules from a\n'Knowledge' file; the second showcases its capacity to guide conceptual\nreasoning in electromagnetism using its pre-trained knowledge without using\nspecific documents provided by the instructor. Our findings show that the\n'role-engineered' Gem successfully facilitates a Socratic dialogue, in stark\ncontrast to a standard Gemini model, which tends to immediately provide direct\nsolutions. We conclude that role engineering is a pivotal and accessible method\nfor educators to transform a general-purpose 'solution provider' into a\nreliable pedagogical tutor capable of engaging students in an active reflection\nprocess. This approach offers a powerful tool for both instructors and\nstudents, while also highlighting the importance of addressing the technology's\ninherent limitations, such as the potential for occasional inaccuracies.",

Practitioners lack\naccessible and interpretable tools to expose and repair hidden failure modes.\nHere we introduce ModelAuditor, a self-reflective agent that converses with\nusers, selects task-specific metrics, and simulates context-dependent,\nclinically relevant distribution shifts. ModelAuditor then generates\ninterpretable reports explaining how much performance likely degrades during\ndeployment, discussing specific likely failure modes and identifying root\ncauses and mitigation strategies.

                    "value": "The deployment of AI models in clinical practice faces a critical challenge:\nmodels achieving expert-level performance on benchmarks can fail\ncatastrophically when confronted with real-world variations in medical imaging.\nMinor shifts in scanner hardware, lighting or demographics can erode accuracy,\nbut currently reliability auditing to identify such catastrophic failure cases\nbefore deployment is a bespoke and time-consuming process. Practitioners lack\naccessible and interpretable tools to expose and repair hidden failure modes.\nHere we introduce ModelAuditor, a self-reflective agent that converses with\nusers, selects task-specific metrics, and simulates context-dependent,\nclinically relevant distribution shifts. ModelAuditor then generates\ninterpretable reports explaining how much performance likely degrades during\ndeployment, discussing specific likely failure modes and identifying root\ncauses and mitigation strategies.

However, the existing UAV-assisted offloading strategies are\ninsufficient in coordinating heterogeneous computing resources and adapting to\ndynamic network conditions. Hence, this paper proposes a dual-layer\nUAV-assisted edge computing architecture based on partial offloading, composed\nof the relay capability of high-altitude UAVs and the computing support of\nlow-altitude UAVs. The proposed architecture enables efficient integration and\ncoordination of heterogeneous resources. A joint optimization problem is\nformulated to minimize the system delay and energy consumption while ensuring\nthe task completion rate. To solve the high-dimensional decision problem, we\nreformulate the problem as a Markov decision process and propose a hierarchical\noffloading scheme based on the soft actor-critic algorithm. The method\ndecouples global and local decisions, where the global decisions integrate\noffloading ratios and trajectory planning into continuous actions, while the\nlocal scheduling is handled via designing a priority-based mechanism.\nSimulations are conducted and demonstrate that the proposed approach\noutperforms several baselines in task completion rate, system efficiency, and\nconvergence speed, showing strong robustness and applicability in dynamic\nvehicular environments.",
