After subsequent indications of\nmajor changes in patients' physicality and anatomy adaptive CT scans were\nacquired as per institutional protocol. Both the primary planning CT and the\nindicative cone-beam CT (CBCT) last acquired before the commencement of the\nadaptive treatment were imported into Velocity workstation. Rigid and\ndeformable image registration techniques were used for the generation of a\nSynthetic CT (sCT). Simultaneously replanning was done on re-planning CT (rCT)\nfor adaptive plan execution. The primary plan dose was subsequently mapped and\ndeformed onto the Synthetic CT in Velocity workstation, allowing for a\ncomparative dosimetric analysis between the sCT and rCT plan doses. This\ncomparison was conducted in both Velocity and Eclipse, focusing on dose\nvariations across different organs at risk (OARs) and the planning target\nvolume (PTV). Additionally, dosimetric indices were evaluated to assess and\nvalidate the accuracy and quality of the synthetic CT-based dose mapping\nrelative to adaptive planning.\n  Results: The dosimetric comparison between sCT and rCT stated that Mean dose\nfor OARs and PTVs were found to be similar in the two planning and the level of\nconfidence by using T-statistics. Collaborative research has the potential to\neliminate the need of rCT as a standard requirement.\n  Conclusion: The sCT shows comparable CT numbers and doses to the replanning\nCT, suggesting it's potential as a replacement pending clinical correlation and\ncontour adjustments.",

Additionally, dosimetric indices were evaluated to assess and\nvalidate the accuracy and quality of the synthetic CT-based dose mapping\nrelative to adaptive planning.\n  Results: The dosimetric comparison between sCT and rCT stated that Mean dose\nfor OARs and PTVs were found to be similar in the two planning and the level of\nconfidence by using T-statistics. Collaborative research has the potential to\neliminate the need of rCT as a standard requirement.\n  Conclusion: The sCT shows comparable CT numbers and doses to the replanning\nCT, suggesting it's potential as a replacement pending clinical correlation and\ncontour adjustments."

Yet existing methods face two major limitations: (i)\nevicting entries after full-context prefill causes unbounded peak memory, and\n(ii) query-dependent eviction narrows the cache to a single query, leading to\ndegraded accuracy in multi-turn conversations. We introduce EpiCache, a\ntraining-free KV cache management framework for long conversational question\nanswering (LongConvQA) under fixed memory budgets. EpiCache bounds cache growth\nthrough block-wise prefill and preserves topic-relevant context via episodic KV\ncompression, which clusters conversation history into coherent episodes and\napplies episode-specific KV cache eviction. We further design an adaptive\nlayer-wise budget allocation strategy that measures each layer's sensitivity to\neviction and distributes the memory budget across layers accordingly. Across\nthree LongConvQA benchmarks, EpiCache improves accuracy by up to 40% over\nrecent baselines, sustains near-full KV accuracy under 4-6x compression, and\nreduces latency and memory by up to 2.4x and 3.5x, thereby enabling efficient\nmulti-turn interaction under strict resource constraints.",

Existing\ncaching solutions focus on exact-match queries, limiting their effectiveness\nfor semantic knowledge reuse.\n  To address this challenge, we introduce Asteria, a novel cross-region\nknowledge caching architecture for LLM agents. At its core are two\nabstractions: Semantic Element (SE) and Semantic Retrieval Index (Sine). A\nsemantic element captures the semantic embedding representation of an LLM query\ntogether with performance-aware metadata such as latency, cost, and staticity.\nSine then provides two-stage retrieval: a vector similar index with semantic\nembedding for fast candidate selection and a lightweight LLM-powered semantic\njudger for precise validation. Atop these primitives, Asteria builds a new\ncache interface that includes a new semantic-aware cache hit definition, a\ncost-efficient eviction policy, and proactive prefetching. To reduce overhead,\nAsteria co-locates the small LLM judger with the main LLM using adaptive\nscheduling and resource sharing. Our evaluation demonstrates that Asteria\ndelivers substantial performance improvements without compromising correctness.\nOn representative search workloads, Asteria achieves up to a 3.6$\\times$\nincrease in throughput by maintaining cache hit rates of over 85%, while\npreserving accuracy virtually identical to non-cached baselines.

We\nstudy speculative decoding for VLMs and introduce SpecVLM, a practical system\nthat (1) establishes a strong EAGLE-2-style baseline, EagleVLM, delivering\n1.5--2.3x end-to-end speedups over full autoregressive inference, and (2)\nfurther accelerates VLM inference with an elastic visual compressor that\nadaptively selects among pruning, pooling, convolution, and resampler\nprimitives to balance FLOPs/parameters and accuracy per input. To avoid costly\noffline distillation corpora, we propose an online-logit distillation protocol\nthat trains the draft model with on-the-fly teacher logits and penultimate\nfeatures using a combined cross-entropy and Smooth L1 objective, eliminating\nstorage and preprocessing while remaining compute-efficient.

To\naccount for coating thickness, we developed a digital correction method that\nsimulates pore dilation, enabling the pore structure to be estimated for\nuncoated membranes. Dilation yielded uncoated porosity values of 23% for the UF\nmembrane and 20% for the RO support, about 3-fold greater than values observed\nwith a 4 nm coating. Mean pore diameters were 2-fold greater for the UF\nmembrane and 1.5-fold greater for the RO support.

The lack\nof suitable compact radiation sources limits the clinical application of\nminibeams to superficial tumors and renders it impossible for microbeams. We\ndeveloped the first prototype of a compact line-focus X-ray tube (LFXT) with\ntechnology potentially suitable for clinical translation of minibeams and\nmicrobeams. We give an overview of the commissioning process preceding first\noperation, present optical and radiological focal spot characterization\nmethods, and dosimetric measurements. Additionally, we report on first\npreclinical in vitro cell and in vivo mouse brain irradiations conducted with\nthe LFXT prototype. The LFXT was high voltage conditioned up to 300 kV.The\nfocal spot characterization resulted in a strongly eccentric electron\ndistribution with a width of 72.3 $\\mu$m. Dosimetry showed sharp microbeam dose\nprofiles with steep lateral penumbras and a peak-to-valley dose ratio above 10\nthroughout a 70 mm thick PMMA phantom. An open-field dose rate of 4.3 Gy/s was\nmeasured at an acceleration voltage of 150 kV and a beam current of 17.4 mA at\n150 mm distance from the focal spot. In vitro and in vivo experiments\ndemonstrated the feasibility of the LFXT for minibeam and microbeam\napplications with field sizes of 1.5-2 cm. The mice displayed no observable\nside effects after whole-brain 260 $\\mu$m-minibeam irradiation. We successfully\nconstructed and commissioned the first proof-of-concept LFXT prototype.\nDosimetric characterizations of the achieved microbeam field showed the\nsuperiority of the LFXT compared to conventional X-ray tubes in terms of beam\nquality. In future developments, the remaining limitations of the prototype\nwill be addressed for improved minibeam and first ever microbeam radiation\ntherapy in a clinical setting.",

Moreover,\nrejecting a token in the candidate sequence invalidates all subsequent tokens,\nleading to wasted computation during drafting. To overcome these limitations,\nwe propose a cache-assisted parallel speculative decoding framework called\nCARD, which employs a novel query-and-correct paradigm. Our approach decouples\ndrafting from verification: the draft model populates a shared cache with\ncandidate tokens, while the target model concurrently refines the draft's\ntrajectory. This enables inference at near-draft-speed, effectively leveraging\nthe draft model's efficiency without additional fine-tuning.

Theoretically, we show that attention score\napproximation does not guarantee output preservation, and demonstrate that\nCUR-based selection minimizes end-to-end attention reconstruction loss.\nEmpirically, CurDKV achieves up to 9.6% higher accuracy than state-of-the-art\nmethods like SnapKV and ChunkKV under aggressive compression budgets on LLaMA\nand Mistral, while maintaining compatibility with FlashAttention and Grouped\nQuery Attention. In addition to improved accuracy, CurDKV reduces generation\nlatency by up to 40% at high compression, offering a practical speed-accuracy\ntradeoff."

In this paper, we extend the concept\nto general K packing, allowing variable size bundles for improved flexibility\nand performance. We formulate the K PackCache problem from a content delivery\nnetwork CDN operator perspective, aiming to minimize total cost comprising two\ncomponents: transfer cost modeled as a base cost plus a linearly increasing\nterm with the number of items packed, and memory rental cost for caching, which\ndepends on how long and how much is stored. Overpacking increases cost due to\nlow utility, underpacking leads to missed sharing opportunities. We propose an\nonline algorithm, Adaptive K PackCache AKPC, which dynamically forms, merges,\nand splits data cliques based on user access patterns and content correlation.\nOur approach supports batch requests, enables approximate clique merging, and\noffers a formal competitive guarantee. Through extensive evaluation on the\nNetflix and Spotify datasets, AKPC reduces total cost by up to 63 and 55\npercentage over online baselines, respectively, and achieves performance within\n15 and 13 percentage of the optimal. This demonstrates its scalability and\neffectiveness for real world caching systems.",

To address this, we\nintroduce AQUA (Attention via QUery mAgnitudes) a novel and versatile\napproximation strategy that significantly reduces the cost of attention with a\ngraceful performance trade-off. Our method operates in two phases: an efficient\noffline step where we compute a universal, language agnostic projection matrix\nvia SVD on a calibration dataset, and an online inference step where we project\nquery and key vectors and dynamically select a sparse subset of dimensions\nbased on the query's magnitude. We provide a formal theoretical analysis of\nAQUA, establishing the break-even point at which it becomes more\ncomputationally efficient than standard attention. Our empirical evaluations on\nstate-of-the-art models like Llama-3.1-8B demonstrate that a 25% reduction in\nthe attention dot-product computation can be achieved with a statistically\ninsignificant impact on performance across a wide range of benchmarks. We\nfurther showcase the versatility of AQUA by demonstrating its ability to\nsynergistically accelerate existing token eviction methods like H2O and to\ndirectly reduce KV-cache memory size.

                    "value": "The quadratic complexity of the attention mechanism remains a fundamental\nbarrier to scaling Large Language Models (LLMs) to longer contexts, creating a\ncritical bottleneck in both computation and memory. To address this, we\nintroduce AQUA (Attention via QUery mAgnitudes) a novel and versatile\napproximation strategy that significantly reduces the cost of attention with a\ngraceful performance trade-off. Our method operates in two phases: an efficient\noffline step where we compute a universal, language agnostic projection matrix\nvia SVD on a calibration dataset, and an online inference step where we project\nquery and key vectors and dynamically select a sparse subset of dimensions\nbased on the query's magnitude. We provide a formal theoretical analysis of\nAQUA, establishing the break-even point at which it becomes more\ncomputationally efficient than standard attention. Our empirical evaluations on\nstate-of-the-art models like Llama-3.1-8B demonstrate that a 25% reduction in\nthe attention dot-product computation can be achieved with a statistically\ninsignificant impact on performance across a wide range of benchmarks. We\nfurther showcase the versatility of AQUA by demonstrating its ability to\nsynergistically accelerate existing token eviction methods like H2O and to\ndirectly reduce KV-cache memory size. By offering a controllable knob to\nbalance efficiency and accuracy, AQUA provides a practical and powerful tool\nfor making large-scale LLM inference more accessible and sustainable."

Recently,\nfeature caching has been introduced to accelerate diffusion transformers by\ncaching the feature computation in previous timesteps and reusing it in the\nfollowing timesteps, which leverage the temporal similarity of diffusion models\nwhile ignoring the similarity in the spatial dimension. In this paper, we\nintroduce Cluster-Driven Feature Caching (ClusCa) as an orthogonal and\ncomplementary perspective for previous feature caching. Specifically, ClusCa\nperforms spatial clustering on tokens in each timestep, computes only one token\nin each cluster and propagates their information to all the other tokens, which\nis able to reduce the number of tokens by over 90%. Extensive experiments on\nDiT, FLUX and HunyuanVideo demonstrate its effectiveness in both text-to-image\nand text-to-video generation. Besides, it can be directly applied to any\ndiffusion transformer without requirements for training. For instance, ClusCa\nachieves 4.96x acceleration on FLUX with an ImageReward of 99.49%, surpassing\nthe original model by 0.51%.

The goal of the Svalbard Marginal Ice Zone 2025\nCampaign (SvalMIZ-25) was to observe and better understand the complex\ninterplay between atmosphere, waves, and sea-ice in the winter Marginal Ice\nZone (MIZ) in order to advance predictive skill of coupled Arctic forecasting\nsystems. The main objective has been to set up a network of observations with a\nspatial distribution that allows for a representative comparison between in\nsitu observations and gridded model data. The observed variables include air\nand surface temperature, sea-ice drift, and wave energy spectra. With the\nsupport of the Norwegian Coast Guard, we participated in the research cruise\nwith KV Svalbard from 22.April - 11.May 2025. In total 21 buoys were deployed\nin the Marginal Ice Zone north of the Svalbard Archipelago.",

Recently, neural network-based ILF\nschemes have achieved remarkable coding gains, emerging as a powerful candidate\nfor next-generation video coding standards. However, the use of deep neural\nnetworks (DNN) brings significant computational and time complexity or high\ndemands for dedicated hardware, making it challenging for general use. To\naddress this limitation, we study a practical ILF solution by adopting look-up\ntables (LUTs). After training a DNN with a restricted reference range for ILF,\nall possible inputs are traversed, and the output values of the DNN are cached\ninto LUTs. During the coding process, the filtering process is performed by\nsimply retrieving the filtered pixel through locating the input pixels and\ninterpolating between the cached values, instead of relying on heavy inference\ncomputations. In this paper, we propose a universal LUT-based ILF framework,\ntermed LUT-ILF++. First, we introduce the cooperation of multiple kinds of\nfiltering LUTs and propose a series of customized indexing mechanisms to enable\nbetter filtering reference perception with limited storage consumption.

Third, in order to make our solution\npractical for coding uses, we propose the LUT compaction scheme to enable the\nLUT pruning, achieving a lower storage cost of the entire solution.

This work demonstrates that transformer layer caching\nis a practical solution for optimizing diffusion transformer-based TTS models\nwithout requiring architectural changes or retraining. Example inference\nresults can be heard at https://siratish.github.io/F5-TTS_SmoothCache/ ."

Modern accelerators featuring High-Bandwidth Memory\n(HBM) offer a new opportunity: Vaswani et al. [OSDI'18] point out that\neavesdropping on HBM is difficult -- even for physical attackers -- as its\nmemory channels are sealed together with processor cores inside the same\nphysical package. Later, Hunt et al. [NSDI'20] show that, with proper\nisolation, HBM can be turned into an unobservable region where both data and\nmemory traces are hidden.

BOLT introduces three key innovations:\n(i) a new OMAP algorithm that leverages isolated HBM as an unobservable cache\nto accelerate oblivious access to large host memory; (ii) a self-hosted\narchitecture that offloads execution and memory control from the host to\nmitigate CPU-side leakage; and (iii) tailored algorithm-architecture co-designs\nthat maximize resource efficiency.

Existing analysis identifies possible contentions between\nparallel tasks by leveraging the partial order of the tasks or their program\nregions. Unfortunately, they overestimate the number of cache misses caused by\na remote block access without considering the actual cache state and the number\nof accesses. This paper reports a new analysis for inter-core cache contention.\nBased on the order of program regions in a task, we first identify memory\nreferences that could be affected if a remote access occurs in a region.\nAfterwards, a fine-grained contention analysis is constructed that computes the\nnumber of cache misses based on the access quantity of local and remote blocks.\nWe demonstrate that the overall inter-core cache interference of a task can be\nobtained via dynamic programming. Experiments show that compared to existing\nmethods, the proposed analysis reduces inter-core cache interference and WCET\nestimations by 52.31% and 8.94% on average, without significantly increasing\ncomputation overhead.",

                    "value": "WCET (Worst-Case Execution Time) estimation on multicore architecture is\nparticularly challenging mainly due to the complex accesses over cache shared\nby multiple cores. Existing analysis identifies possible contentions between\nparallel tasks by leveraging the partial order of the tasks or their program\nregions. Unfortunately, they overestimate the number of cache misses caused by\na remote block access without considering the actual cache state and the number\nof accesses. This paper reports a new analysis for inter-core cache contention.\nBased on the order of program regions in a task, we first identify memory\nreferences that could be affected if a remote access occurs in a region.\nAfterwards, a fine-grained contention analysis is constructed that computes the\nnumber of cache misses based on the access quantity of local and remote blocks.\nWe demonstrate that the overall inter-core cache interference of a task can be\nobtained via dynamic programming. Experiments show that compared to existing\nmethods, the proposed analysis reduces inter-core cache interference and WCET\nestimations by 52.31% and 8.94% on average, without significantly increasing\ncomputation overhead."

Specifically, we augment the typical RGB decoder with\na 3DGS decoder, which is supervised by the output of the RGB decoder. In this\napproach, the 3DGS decoder can be purely trained with synthetic data generated\nby video diffusion models. At inference time, our model can synthesize 3D\nscenes from either a text prompt or a single image for real-time rendering.

Strategic dishonesty already has a practical impact on safety\nevaluations, as we show that dishonest responses fool all output-based monitors\nused to detect jailbreaks that we test, rendering benchmark scores unreliable.\nFurther, strategic dishonesty can act like a honeypot against malicious users,\nwhich noticeably obfuscates prior jailbreak attacks. While output monitors\nfail, we show that linear probes on internal activations can be used to\nreliably detect strategic dishonesty.

Lavida-O incorporates a novel\nElastic Mixture-of-Transformers (Elastic-MoT) architecture that couples a\nlightweight generation branch with a larger understanding branch, supported by\ntoken compression, universal text conditioning and stratified sampling for\nefficient and high-quality generation. Lavida-O further incorporates planning\nand iterative self-reflection in image generation and editing tasks, seamlessly\nboosting generation quality with its understanding capabilities. Lavida-O\nachieves state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of benchmarks including\nRefCOCO object grounding, GenEval text-to-image generation, and ImgEdit image\nediting, outperforming existing autoregressive models and continuous diffusion\nmodels such as Qwen2.5-VL and FluxKontext-dev, while offering considerable\nspeedup at inference.

Designing an effective chatbot with appropriate methods and\nevaluating its effectiveness is among the challenges in this domain. This study\npresents a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot that harnesses a\nknowledge graph and vector search retrieval to deliver precise, context-rich\nresponses in an exemplary use case from over high-volume engineering\nproject-related emails, thereby minimising the need for document chunking. A\ncentral innovation of this work is the introduction of RAG Evaluation\n(RAG-Eval), a novel chain-of-thought LLM-based tripartite evaluation framework\nspecifically developed to assess RAG applications. This framework operates in\nparallel with the chatbot, jointly assessing the user's query, the retrieved\ndocument, and the generated response, enabling a holistic evaluation across\nmultiple quality metrics like query relevance, factual accuracy, coverage,\ncoherence and fluency.

Designing an effective chatbot with appropriate methods and\nevaluating its effectiveness is among the challenges in this domain. This study\npresents a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot that harnesses a\nknowledge graph and vector search retrieval to deliver precise, context-rich\nresponses in an exemplary use case from over high-volume engineering\nproject-related emails, thereby minimising the need for document chunking. A\ncentral innovation of this work is the introduction of RAG Evaluation\n(RAG-Eval), a novel chain-of-thought LLM-based tripartite evaluation framework\nspecifically developed to assess RAG applications. This framework operates in\nparallel with the chatbot, jointly assessing the user's query, the retrieved\ndocument, and the generated response, enabling a holistic evaluation across\nmultiple quality metrics like query relevance, factual accuracy, coverage,\ncoherence and fluency. The resulting scoring system is provided directly to\nusers as a confidence score (1 to 100%), enabling quick identification of\npossible misaligned or incomplete answers. This proposed approach promotes\ntransparency and rapid verification by incorporating metadata email IDs,\ntimestamps into responses.

Moreover,\ncaptioning models tend to exhibit bias towards the ``average'' caption, which\ncaptures only the more general aspects, thus overlooking finer details.

A key limitation of traditional\ndeep learning approaches, however, is their inability to provide reliable\nestimates of predictive uncertainty. Such uncertainty quantification is\ncritical for assessing model reliability, especially in materials science,\nwhere often the model is applied on out-of-distribution data. Different\nstrategies have been proposed to address this challenge, with deep ensembles\nand Bayesian neural networks being among the most widely used. In this work, we\nintroduce an implementation of Bayesian neural networks with variational\ninference in the aenet-PyTorch framework. To evaluate their applicability to\nmachine learning interatomic potentials, we systematically compare the\nperformance of variational BNNs and deep ensembles on a dataset of 7,815\nTiO$_{2}$ structures. The models are trained on both the full dataset and a\nsubset to assess how variations in data representation influence predictive\naccuracy and uncertainty estimation. This analysis provides insights into the\nstrengths and limitations of each approach, offering practical guidance for the\ndevelopment of uncertainty-aware machine learning interatomic potentials.",

A key limitation of traditional\ndeep learning approaches, however, is their inability to provide reliable\nestimates of predictive uncertainty. Such uncertainty quantification is\ncritical for assessing model reliability, especially in materials science,\nwhere often the model is applied on out-of-distribution data. Different\nstrategies have been proposed to address this challenge, with deep ensembles\nand Bayesian neural networks being among the most widely used. In this work, we\nintroduce an implementation of Bayesian neural networks with variational\ninference in the aenet-PyTorch framework. To evaluate their applicability to\nmachine learning interatomic potentials, we systematically compare the\nperformance of variational BNNs and deep ensembles on a dataset of 7,815\nTiO$_{2}$ structures. The models are trained on both the full dataset and a\nsubset to assess how variations in data representation influence predictive\naccuracy and uncertainty estimation. This analysis provides insights into the\nstrengths and limitations of each approach, offering practical guidance for the\ndevelopment of uncertainty-aware machine learning interatomic potentials."

FSPO introduces a simple\nremedy: we clip the sequence log-IS ratio with a band that scales as\n$\\sqrt{L}$. Theoretically, we formalize length fairness via a Length\nReweighting Error (LRE) and prove that small LRE yields a cosine directional\nguarantee between the clipped and true updates. Empirically, FSPO flattens clip\nrates across length bins, stabilizes training, and outperforms all baselines\nacross multiple evaluation datasets on Qwen3-8B-Base model."

Experiments conducted on\nlong-form reasoning tasks using 128 H100 GPUs demonstrate that PipelineRL\nachieves approximately $\\sim 2x$ faster learning compared to conventional RL\nbaselines while maintaining highly on-policy training data.

PipelineRL employs\nconcurrent asynchronous data generation and model training, distinguished by\nthe novel in-flight weight updates. This mechanism allows the LLM generation\nengine to receive updated model weights with minimal interruption during the\ngeneration of token sequences, thereby maximizing both the accelerator\nutilization and the freshness of training data. Experiments conducted on\nlong-form reasoning tasks using 128 H100 GPUs demonstrate that PipelineRL\nachieves approximately $\\sim 2x$ faster learning compared to conventional RL\nbaselines while maintaining highly on-policy training data. A scalable and\nmodular open-source implementation of PipelineRL is also released as a key\ncontribution."

In this thesis, we\ndiscuss recent progress toward designing algorithms that exhibit desirable\nrobustness properties. First, we discuss the problem of adversarial examples in\ncomputer vision, for which we introduce new technical results, training\nparadigms, and certification algorithms. Next, we consider the problem of\ndomain generalization, wherein the task is to train neural networks to\ngeneralize from a family of training distributions to unseen test\ndistributions. We present new algorithms that achieve state-of-the-art\ngeneralization in medical imaging, molecular identification, and image\nclassification. Finally, we study the setting of jailbreaking large language\nmodels (LLMs), wherein an adversarial user attempts to design prompts that\nelicit objectionable content from an LLM. We propose new attacks and defenses,\nwhich represent the frontier of progress toward designing robust language-based\nagents.",

In this thesis, we\ndiscuss recent progress toward designing algorithms that exhibit desirable\nrobustness properties. First, we discuss the problem of adversarial examples in\ncomputer vision, for which we introduce new technical results, training\nparadigms, and certification algorithms. Next, we consider the problem of\ndomain generalization, wherein the task is to train neural networks to\ngeneralize from a family of training distributions to unseen test\ndistributions. We present new algorithms that achieve state-of-the-art\ngeneralization in medical imaging, molecular identification, and image\nclassification. Finally, we study the setting of jailbreaking large language\nmodels (LLMs), wherein an adversarial user attempts to design prompts that\nelicit objectionable content from an LLM. We propose new attacks and defenses,\nwhich represent the frontier of progress toward designing robust language-based\nagents."

PoT\nthen aggregates and reweights these candidates according to inferred user\npreferences, yielding a final personalized response that benefits from the\ncomplementary strengths of diverse reasoning paths. Experiments on the LaMP-QA\nbenchmark for personalized QA show that PoT consistently outperforms\ncompetitive baselines, achieving up to a 13.1% relative improvement.

DBVI retains the\nmathematical elegance of DDVI, including Girsanov-based ELBOs and reverse-time\nSDEs,while reinterpreting the prior via a Doob-bridged diffusion process. We\nderive a tractable training objective under this formulation and implement DBVI\nfor scalable inference in large-scale DGPs. Across regression, classification,\nand image reconstruction tasks, DBVI consistently outperforms DDVI and other\nvariational baselines in predictive accuracy, convergence speed, and posterior\nquality."

                "summary": "Recent advances in Artificial Intelligence Generated Content have led to\nhighly realistic synthetic videos, particularly in human-centric scenarios\ninvolving speech, gestures, and full-body motion, posing serious threats to\ninformation authenticity and public trust. Unlike DeepFake techniques that\nfocus on localized facial manipulation, human-centric video generation methods\ncan synthesize entire human bodies with controllable movements, enabling\ncomplex interactions with environments, objects, and even other people.\nHowever, existing detection methods largely overlook the growing risks posed by\nsuch full-body synthetic content. Meanwhile, a growing body of research has\nexplored leveraging LLMs for interpretable fake detection, aiming to explain\ndecisions in natural language.

Current zero-shot detectors often employ Gaussian distributions\nas statistical measure for computing detection thresholds, which falters when\nconfronted with the heavy-tailed statistical artifacts characteristic of\nadversarial or non-native English texts. In this paper, we introduce T-Detect,\na novel detection method that fundamentally redesigns the curvature-based\ndetectors. Our primary innovation is the replacement of standard Gaussian\nnormalization with a heavy-tailed discrepancy score derived from the Student's\nt-distribution. This approach is theoretically grounded in the empirical\nobservation that adversarial texts exhibit significant leptokurtosis, rendering\ntraditional statistical assumptions inadequate. T-Detect computes a detection\nscore by normalizing the log-likelihood of a passage against the expected\nmoments of a t-distribution, providing superior resilience to statistical\noutliers. We validate our approach on the challenging RAID benchmark for\nadversarial text and the comprehensive HART dataset. Experiments show that\nT-Detect provides a consistent performance uplift over strong baselines,\nimproving AUROC by up to 3.9\\% in targeted domains. When integrated into a\ntwo-dimensional detection framework (CT), our method achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance, with an AUROC of 0.926 on the Books domain of RAID.

Our goal\nis to provide the Italian and international research communities with valuable\ninsights into emerging trends and key developments over time, supporting\ninformed decisions and future directions in the field."

However, the precision control of TTS\ninference is still challenging. Although instruction-based Text-to-Speech\n(Instruct-TTS) models are proposed, these models still lack fine-grained\ncontrol due to the modality gap between single-level text instructions and\nmultilevel speech tokens.

To bridge the modality\ngap of these tokens, we propose a hierarchical decoding strategy, where the LLM\ngenerates tokens in a structured order: first semantic, then fine-grained\nstyle, and finally complete acoustic representation. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that this hierarchical paradigm significantly improves instruction\nadherence and achieves state-of-the-art naturalness, validating our approach\nfor precise and controllable speech synthesis.

We initialize\nagents with realistic profiles calibrated on real-world online conversations\nfrom the 2022 Italian political election and extend an existing simulator by\nintroducing mechanisms for opinion modeling. We examine how LLM agents simulate\nonline conversations, interact with others, and evolve their opinions under\ndifferent scenarios. Our results show that LLM agents generate coherent\ncontent, form connections, and build a realistic social network structure.\nHowever, their generated content displays less heterogeneity in tone and\ntoxicity compared to real data. We also find that LLM-based opinion dynamics\nevolve over time in ways similar to traditional mathematical models. Varying\nparameter configurations produces no significant changes, indicating that\nsimulations require more careful cognitive modeling at initialization to\nreplicate human behavior more faithfully.

                "summary": "Bayesian networks (BN) are probabilistic graphical models that enable\nefficient knowledge representation and inference. These have proven effective\nacross diverse domains, including healthcare, bioinformatics and economics. The\nstructure and parameters of a BN can be obtained by domain experts or directly\nlearned from available data. However, as privacy concerns escalate, it becomes\nincreasingly critical for publicly released models to safeguard sensitive\ninformation in training data. Typically, released models do not prioritize\nprivacy by design. In particular, tracing attacks from adversaries can combine\nthe released BN with auxiliary data to determine whether specific individuals\nbelong to the data from which the BN was learned. State-of-the-art protection\ntecniques involve introducing noise into the learned parameters. While this\noffers robust protection against tracing attacks, it significantly impacts the\nmodel's utility, in terms of both the significance and accuracy of the\nresulting inferences. Hence, high privacy may be attained at the cost of\nreleasing a possibly ineffective model. This paper introduces credal networks\n(CN) as a novel solution for balancing the model's privacy and utility. After\nadapting the notion of tracing attacks, we demonstrate that a CN enables the\nmasking of the learned BN, thereby reducing the probability of successful\nattacks. As CNs are obfuscated but not noisy versions of BNs, they can achieve\nmeaningful inferences while safeguarding privacy. Moreover, we identify key\nlearning information that must be concealed to prevent attackers from\nrecovering the underlying BN. Finally, we conduct a set of numerical\nexperiments to analyze how privacy gains can be modulated by tuning the CN\nhyperparameters. Our results confirm that CNs provide a principled, practical,\nand effective approach towards the development of privacy-aware probabilistic\ngraphical models.",

                    "value": "Bayesian networks (BN) are probabilistic graphical models that enable\nefficient knowledge representation and inference. These have proven effective\nacross diverse domains, including healthcare, bioinformatics and economics. The\nstructure and parameters of a BN can be obtained by domain experts or directly\nlearned from available data. However, as privacy concerns escalate, it becomes\nincreasingly critical for publicly released models to safeguard sensitive\ninformation in training data. Typically, released models do not prioritize\nprivacy by design. In particular, tracing attacks from adversaries can combine\nthe released BN with auxiliary data to determine whether specific individuals\nbelong to the data from which the BN was learned. State-of-the-art protection\ntecniques involve introducing noise into the learned parameters. While this\noffers robust protection against tracing attacks, it significantly impacts the\nmodel's utility, in terms of both the significance and accuracy of the\nresulting inferences. Hence, high privacy may be attained at the cost of\nreleasing a possibly ineffective model. This paper introduces credal networks\n(CN) as a novel solution for balancing the model's privacy and utility. After\nadapting the notion of tracing attacks, we demonstrate that a CN enables the\nmasking of the learned BN, thereby reducing the probability of successful\nattacks. As CNs are obfuscated but not noisy versions of BNs, they can achieve\nmeaningful inferences while safeguarding privacy. Moreover, we identify key\nlearning information that must be concealed to prevent attackers from\nrecovering the underlying BN. Finally, we conduct a set of numerical\nexperiments to analyze how privacy gains can be modulated by tuning the CN\nhyperparameters. Our results confirm that CNs provide a principled, practical,\nand effective approach towards the development of privacy-aware probabilistic\ngraphical models."

While output monitors\nfail, we show that linear probes on internal activations can be used to\nreliably detect strategic dishonesty. We validate probes on datasets with\nverifiable outcomes and by using them as steering vectors. Overall, we consider\nstrategic dishonesty as a concrete example of a broader concern that alignment\nof LLMs is hard to control, especially when helpfulness and harmlessness\nconflict."

Efficient\ncompression and representation are crucial for analyzing complex motion\ndynamics. In this work, we introduce an adversarially-refined VQ-GAN framework\nwith dense motion tokenization for compressing spatio-temporal heatmaps while\npreserving the fine-grained traces of human motion. Our approach combines dense\nmotion tokenization with adversarial refinement, which eliminates\nreconstruction artifacts like motion smearing and temporal misalignment\nobserved in non-adversarial baselines. Our experiments on the CMU Panoptic\ndataset provide conclusive evidence of our method's superiority, outperforming\nthe dVAE baseline by 9.31% SSIM and reducing temporal instability by 37.1%.\nFurthermore, our dense tokenization strategy enables a novel analysis of motion\ncomplexity, revealing that 2D motion can be optimally represented with a\ncompact 128-token vocabulary, while 3D motion's complexity demands a much\nlarger 1024-token codebook for faithful reconstruction. These results establish\npractical deployment feasibility across diverse motion analysis applications.\nThe code base for this work is available at\nhttps://github.com/TeCSAR-UNCC/Pose-Quantization.",

To address these obstacles, we present Embodied Arena, a\ncomprehensive, unified, and evolving evaluation platform for Embodied AI.

In this\npaper, we aim to bridge this gap by studying a teacher-student kernel\nregression setup trained via online stochastic gradient descent (SGD).\nLeveraging a novel intrinsic time viewpoint and stochastic differential\nequation (SDE) modeling of SGD, we introduce the Functional Scaling Law (FSL),\nwhich characterizes the evolution of population risk during the training\nprocess for general LRSs. Remarkably, the impact of the LRSs is captured\nthrough an explicit convolution-type functional term, making their effects\nfully tractable. To illustrate the utility of FSL, we analyze three widely used\nLRSs -- constant, exponential decay, and warmup-stable-decay (WSD) -- under\nboth data-limited and compute-limited regimes. We provide theoretical\njustification for widely adopted empirical practices in LLMs pre-training such\nas (i) higher-capacity models are more data- and compute-efficient; (ii)\nlearning rate decay can improve training efficiency; (iii) WSD-like schedules\ncan outperform direct-decay schedules. Lastly, we explore the practical\nrelevance of FSL as a surrogate model for fitting, predicting and optimizing\nthe loss curves in LLM pre-training, with experiments conducted across model\nsizes ranging from 0.1B to 1B parameters. We hope our FSL framework can deepen\nthe understanding of LLM pre-training dynamics and provide insights for\nimproving large-scale model training.",

However, effectively scaling\nthese RL methods presents significant challenges, primarily due to the\ndifficulty in maintaining high AI accelerator utilization without generating\nstale, off-policy data that harms common RL algorithms. This paper introduces\nPipelineRL, an approach designed to achieve a superior trade-off between\nhardware efficiency and data on-policyness for LLM training. PipelineRL employs\nconcurrent asynchronous data generation and model training, distinguished by\nthe novel in-flight weight updates. This mechanism allows the LLM generation\nengine to receive updated model weights with minimal interruption during the\ngeneration of token sequences, thereby maximizing both the accelerator\nutilization and the freshness of training data. Experiments conducted on\nlong-form reasoning tasks using 128 H100 GPUs demonstrate that PipelineRL\nachieves approximately $\\sim 2x$ faster learning compared to conventional RL\nbaselines while maintaining highly on-policy training data. A scalable and\nmodular open-source implementation of PipelineRL is also released as a key\ncontribution.",

Popular\nbenchmarks may entangle multiple reasoning skills and thus provide unfaithful\nevaluations on the logic reasoning skill. Meanwhile, existing logic reasoning\nbenchmarks are limited in language diversity and their distributions are\ndeviated from the distribution of an ideal logic reasoning benchmark, which may\nlead to biased evaluation results. This paper thereby proposes a new classical\nlogic benchmark DivLogicEval, consisting of natural sentences composed of\ndiverse statements in a counterintuitive way. To ensure a more reliable\nevaluation, we also introduce a new evaluation metric that mitigates the\ninfluence of bias and randomness inherent in LLMs. Through experiments, we\ndemonstrate the extent to which logical reasoning is required to answer the\nquestions in DivLogicEval and compare the performance of different popular LLMs\nin conducting logical reasoning.",

                    "value": "Logic reasoning in natural language has been recognized as an important\nmeasure of human intelligence for Large Language Models (LLMs). Popular\nbenchmarks may entangle multiple reasoning skills and thus provide unfaithful\nevaluations on the logic reasoning skill. Meanwhile, existing logic reasoning\nbenchmarks are limited in language diversity and their distributions are\ndeviated from the distribution of an ideal logic reasoning benchmark, which may\nlead to biased evaluation results. This paper thereby proposes a new classical\nlogic benchmark DivLogicEval, consisting of natural sentences composed of\ndiverse statements in a counterintuitive way. To ensure a more reliable\nevaluation, we also introduce a new evaluation metric that mitigates the\ninfluence of bias and randomness inherent in LLMs. Through experiments, we\ndemonstrate the extent to which logical reasoning is required to answer the\nquestions in DivLogicEval and compare the performance of different popular LLMs\nin conducting logical reasoning."

On the ChemProt\nbenchmark, RELATE achieves 52% exact match and 94% accuracy@10, and in 2,400\nHEAL Project abstracts, it effectively rejects irrelevant associations (0.4%)\nand identifies negated assertions. RELATE captures nuanced biomedical\nrelationships while ensuring quality for KG augmentation. By combining vector\nsearch with contextual LLM reasoning, RELATE provides a scalable, semantically\naccurate framework for converting unstructured biomedical literature into\nstandardized KGs."

                "summary": "Multi-agent systems (MAS) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for\norchestrating large language models (LLMs) and specialized tools to\ncollaboratively address complex tasks. However, existing MAS frameworks often\nrequire manual workflow configuration and lack native support for dynamic\nevolution and performance optimization. In addition, many MAS optimization\nalgorithms are not integrated into a unified framework. In this paper, we\npresent EvoAgentX, an open-source platform that automates the generation,\nexecution, and evolutionary optimization of multi-agent workflows. EvoAgentX\nemploys a modular architecture consisting of five core layers: the basic\ncomponents, agent, workflow, evolving, and evaluation layers. Specifically,\nwithin the evolving layer, EvoAgentX integrates three MAS optimization\nalgorithms, TextGrad, AFlow, and MIPRO, to iteratively refine agent prompts,\ntool configurations, and workflow topologies. We evaluate EvoAgentX on\nHotPotQA, MBPP, and MATH for multi-hop reasoning, code generation, and\nmathematical problem solving, respectively, and further assess it on real-world\ntasks using GAIA. Experimental results show that EvoAgentX consistently\nachieves significant performance improvements, including a 7.44% increase in\nHotPotQA F1, a 10.00% improvement in MBPP pass@1, a 10.00% gain in MATH solve\naccuracy, and an overall accuracy improvement of up to 20.00% on GAIA.

                    "value": "Multi-agent systems (MAS) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for\norchestrating large language models (LLMs) and specialized tools to\ncollaboratively address complex tasks. However, existing MAS frameworks often\nrequire manual workflow configuration and lack native support for dynamic\nevolution and performance optimization. In addition, many MAS optimization\nalgorithms are not integrated into a unified framework. In this paper, we\npresent EvoAgentX, an open-source platform that automates the generation,\nexecution, and evolutionary optimization of multi-agent workflows. EvoAgentX\nemploys a modular architecture consisting of five core layers: the basic\ncomponents, agent, workflow, evolving, and evaluation layers. Specifically,\nwithin the evolving layer, EvoAgentX integrates three MAS optimization\nalgorithms, TextGrad, AFlow, and MIPRO, to iteratively refine agent prompts,\ntool configurations, and workflow topologies. We evaluate EvoAgentX on\nHotPotQA, MBPP, and MATH for multi-hop reasoning, code generation, and\nmathematical problem solving, respectively, and further assess it on real-world\ntasks using GAIA. Experimental results show that EvoAgentX consistently\nachieves significant performance improvements, including a 7.44% increase in\nHotPotQA F1, a 10.00% improvement in MBPP pass@1, a 10.00% gain in MATH solve\naccuracy, and an overall accuracy improvement of up to 20.00% on GAIA.

To address this limitation, we propose HD-PPT, a\nframework that transforms speech synthesis into a structured, hierarchical\ntask.

To bridge the modality\ngap of these tokens, we propose a hierarchical decoding strategy, where the LLM\ngenerates tokens in a structured order: first semantic, then fine-grained\nstyle, and finally complete acoustic representation. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that this hierarchical paradigm significantly improves instruction\nadherence and achieves state-of-the-art naturalness, validating our approach\nfor precise and controllable speech synthesis.

To address\nthe first challenge, we decompose real-world variations into three critical\ndomains: object 3D transformations that affect spatial reasoning, illumination\nvariations that challenge visual perception, and adversarial patches that\ndisrupt scene understanding. For the second challenge, we introduce a\ncontinuous black-box optimization framework that transforms discrete physical\nvariations into parameter optimization, enabling systematic exploration of\nworst-case scenarios. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art OpenVLA models\nacross multiple benchmarks reveal alarming vulnerabilities: all variation types\ntrigger failure rates exceeding 60%, with object transformations causing up to\n97.8% failure in long-horizon tasks.

Detecting such malicious contracts at the time\nof deployment is an important proactive strategy preventing loss from victim\ncontracts. It offers a better cost-benefit than detecting vulnerabilities on\ndiverse potential victims. However, existing works are not generic with limited\ndetection types and effectiveness due to imbalanced samples, while the emerging\nLLM technologies, which show its potentials in generalization, have two key\nproblems impeding its application in this task: hard digestion of compiled-code\ninputs, especially those with task-specific logic, and hard assessment of LLMs'\ncertainty in their binary answers, i.e., yes-or-no answers. Therefore, we\npropose a generic adversarial smart contracts detection framework FinDet, which\nleverages LLMs with two enhancements addressing above two problems. FinDet\ntakes as input only the EVM-bytecode contracts and identifies adversarial ones\namong them with high balanced accuracy. The first enhancement extracts concise\nsemantic intentions and high-level behavioral logic from the low-level bytecode\ninputs, unleashing the LLM reasoning capability restricted by the task input.\nThe second enhancement probes and measures the LLM uncertainty to its\nmulti-round answering to the same query, improving the LLM answering robustness\nfor binary classifications required by the task output. Our comprehensive\nevaluation shows that FinDet achieves a BAC of 0.9223 and a TPR of 0.8950,\nsignificantly outperforming existing baselines.

We propose a unified\nreinforcement learning-based control policy for whole-body visuomotor skills\ninvolving all degrees of freedom to achieve effective shuttlecock tracking and\nstriking.

Extensive experimental results in a\nvariety of environments validate the robot's capability to predict shuttlecock\ntrajectories, navigate the service area effectively, and execute precise\nstrikes against human players, demonstrating the feasibility of using legged\nmobile manipulators in complex and dynamic sports scenarios.",

The high\ncost of annotation and the limited transferability of these methods\nsignificantly hinder the practical deployment of DVGL in open-world scenarios.\nTo address these limitations, we propose a novel end-to-end self-supervised\nlearning method with a shallow backbone network, called the dynamic\nmemory-driven and neighborhood information learning (DMNIL) method. It employs\na clustering algorithm to generate pseudo-labels and adopts a dual-path\ncontrastive learning framework to learn discriminative intra-view\nrepresentations.

The DHML module combines\nshort-term and long-term memory to enhance intra-view feature consistency and\ndiscriminability.

SmartWilds is a synchronized collection of drone imagery, camera trap\nphotographs and videos, and bioacoustic recordings collected during summer 2025\nat The Wilds safari park in Ohio. This dataset supports multimodal AI research\nfor comprehensive environmental monitoring, addressing critical needs in\nendangered species research, conservation ecology, and habitat management. Our\npilot deployment captured four days of synchronized monitoring across three\nmodalities in a 220-acre pasture containing Pere David's deer, Sichuan takin,\nPrzewalski's horses, as well as species native to Ohio, including bald eagles,\nwhite-tailed deer, and coyotes. We provide a comparative analysis of sensor\nmodality performance, demonstrating complementary strengths for landuse\npatterns, species detection, behavioral analysis, and habitat monitoring.

SmartWilds is a synchronized collection of drone imagery, camera trap\nphotographs and videos, and bioacoustic recordings collected during summer 2025\nat The Wilds safari park in Ohio. This dataset supports multimodal AI research\nfor comprehensive environmental monitoring, addressing critical needs in\nendangered species research, conservation ecology, and habitat management. Our\npilot deployment captured four days of synchronized monitoring across three\nmodalities in a 220-acre pasture containing Pere David's deer, Sichuan takin,\nPrzewalski's horses, as well as species native to Ohio, including bald eagles,\nwhite-tailed deer, and coyotes. We provide a comparative analysis of sensor\nmodality performance, demonstrating complementary strengths for landuse\npatterns, species detection, behavioral analysis, and habitat monitoring.

This is particularly problematic for homogeneously\nincorrect groups, where GRPO's advantage function yields a value of zero,\nleading to null gradients and the loss of valuable learning signals. To\novercome this issue, we propose NGRPO (Negative-enhanced Group Relative Policy\nOptimization), an algorithm designed to convert homogeneous errors into robust\nlearning signals. First, NGRPO introduces Advantage Calibration. This mechanism\nhypothesizes the existence of a virtual maximum-reward sample during advantage\ncalculation, thereby altering the mean and variance of rewards within a group\nand ensuring that the advantages for homogeneously incorrect samples are no\nlonger zero. Second, NGRPO employs Asymmetric Clipping, which relaxes the\nupdate magnitude for positive samples while imposing stricter constraints on\nthat of negative samples. This serves to stabilize the exploration pressure\nintroduced by the advantage calibration. Our experiments on Qwen2.5-Math-7B\ndemonstrate that NGRPO significantly outperforms baselines such as PPO, GRPO,\nDAPO, and PSR-NSR on mathematical benchmarks including MATH500, AMC23, and\nAIME2025.
