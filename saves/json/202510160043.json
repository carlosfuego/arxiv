Comprehensive evaluations on challenging benchmarks: LongBench,\nNeedle-In-A-HayStack, GSM8K, and JailbreakV demonstrate that ChunkKV\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 8.7\\% in precision while\nmaintaining the same compression ratio. These results confirm that\nsemantic-aware compression significantly enhances both efficiency and\nperformance for long-context LLM inference, providing a simple yet effective\nsolution to the memory bottleneck problem.

                "summary": "Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have become a prominent paradigm for\nembodied intelligence, yet further performance improvements typically rely on\nscaling up training data and model size -- an approach that is prohibitively\nexpensive for robotics and fundamentally limited by data collection costs. We\naddress this limitation with $\\mathbf{RoVer}$, an embodied test-time scaling\nframework that uses a $\\mathbf{Ro}$bot Process Reward Model (PRM) as a\nTest-Time $\\mathbf{Ver}$ifier to enhance the capabilities of existing VLA\nmodels without modifying their architectures or weights. Specifically, RoVer\n(i) assigns scalar-based process rewards to evaluate the reliability of\ncandidate actions, and (ii) predicts an action-space direction for candidate\nexpansion/refinement. During inference, RoVer generates multiple candidate\nactions concurrently from the base policy, expands them along PRM-predicted\ndirections, and then scores all candidates with PRM to select the optimal\naction for execution.

                    "value": "Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have become a prominent paradigm for\nembodied intelligence, yet further performance improvements typically rely on\nscaling up training data and model size -- an approach that is prohibitively\nexpensive for robotics and fundamentally limited by data collection costs. We\naddress this limitation with $\\mathbf{RoVer}$, an embodied test-time scaling\nframework that uses a $\\mathbf{Ro}$bot Process Reward Model (PRM) as a\nTest-Time $\\mathbf{Ver}$ifier to enhance the capabilities of existing VLA\nmodels without modifying their architectures or weights. Specifically, RoVer\n(i) assigns scalar-based process rewards to evaluate the reliability of\ncandidate actions, and (ii) predicts an action-space direction for candidate\nexpansion/refinement. During inference, RoVer generates multiple candidate\nactions concurrently from the base policy, expands them along PRM-predicted\ndirections, and then scores all candidates with PRM to select the optimal\naction for execution.

In addition, beyond static prompt-based\ngeneration, interactive capabilities, such as streaming prompt inputs, are\ncritical for dynamic content creation, enabling users to guide narratives in\nreal time. This interactive requirement significantly increases complexity,\nespecially in ensuring visual consistency and semantic coherence during prompt\ntransitions. To address these challenges, LongLive adopts a causal, frame-level\nAR design that integrates a KV-recache mechanism that refreshes cached states\nwith new prompts for smooth, adherent switches; streaming long tuning to enable\nlong video training and to align training and inference (train-long-test-long);\nand short window attention paired with a frame-level attention sink, shorten as\nframe sink, preserving long-range consistency while enabling faster generation.\nWith these key designs, LongLive fine-tunes a 1.3B-parameter short-clip model\nto minute-long generation in just 32 GPU-days.

Current systems rely on static pipeline\nconfigurations that struggle to adapt to dynamic workload conditions, leading\nto substantial inefficiencies. We present FlexPipe, a novel system that\ndynamically reconfigures pipeline architectures during runtime to address these\nfundamental limitations. FlexPipe decomposes models into fine-grained stages\nand intelligently adjusts pipeline granularity based on real-time request\npattern analysis, implementing three key innovations: fine-grained model\npartitioning with preserved computational graph constraints, inflight pipeline\nrefactoring with consistent cache transitions, and topology-aware resource\nallocation that navigates GPU fragmentation. Comprehensive evaluation on an\n82-GPU cluster demonstrates that FlexPipe achieves up to 8.5x better resource\nefficiency while maintaining 38.3% lower latency compared to state-of-the-art\nsystems, reducing GPU reservation requirements from 75% to 30% of peak\ncapacity.",

                    "value": "Serving Large Language Models (LLMs) in production faces significant\nchallenges from highly variable request patterns and severe resource\nfragmentation in serverless clusters. Current systems rely on static pipeline\nconfigurations that struggle to adapt to dynamic workload conditions, leading\nto substantial inefficiencies. We present FlexPipe, a novel system that\ndynamically reconfigures pipeline architectures during runtime to address these\nfundamental limitations. FlexPipe decomposes models into fine-grained stages\nand intelligently adjusts pipeline granularity based on real-time request\npattern analysis, implementing three key innovations: fine-grained model\npartitioning with preserved computational graph constraints, inflight pipeline\nrefactoring with consistent cache transitions, and topology-aware resource\nallocation that navigates GPU fragmentation. Comprehensive evaluation on an\n82-GPU cluster demonstrates that FlexPipe achieves up to 8.5x better resource\nefficiency while maintaining 38.3% lower latency compared to state-of-the-art\nsystems, reducing GPU reservation requirements from 75% to 30% of peak\ncapacity."

Hyper-parallel\nscaling computes and aggregates multiple output proposals for a single token\nfrom the model. We implement this concept in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models,\nwhich we refer to as Roster of Experts (RoE). RoE is a training-free inference\nalgorithm that turns a single MoE into a dynamic ensemble of MoEs. RoE injects\ncontrolled stochasticity into the expert routing mechanism, enabling it to\nsample multiple diverse experts for each token and aggregate their outputs for\na more accurate final prediction. To overcome the computational cost, we\nintroduce an efficient batching strategy and a specialized KV-caching mechanism\nthat minimizes compute and memory overhead. For example, RoE enables a 7B MoE\nmodel to match the performance of a 10.5B MoE model while using 30% less\ncompute for inference.

                "summary": "We present the design and characterization of a low-noise environment for\nmeasuring the electron's electric dipole moment (EDM) with a beam of molecules.\nTo minimize magnetic Johnson noise from metals, the design features ceramic\nelectric field plates housed in a glass vacuum chamber. To suppress external\nmagnetic noise the apparatus is enclosed within a cylindrical four-layer\nmu-metal shield with a shielding factor exceeding $10^6$ in one radial\ndirection and $10^5$ in the other. Finite element modelling shows that the\ndifference between these shielding factors is due to imperfect joints between\nsections of mu-metal. Using atomic magnetometers to monitor the magnetic field\ninside the shield, we measure noise below 40 fT/$\\sqrt{{\\rm Hz}}$ at 1 Hz and\nabove, rising to 500 fT/$\\sqrt{{\\rm Hz}}$ at 0.1 Hz. Analytical and numerical\nstudies show that residual magnetic Johnson noise contributes approximately 13\nfT/$\\sqrt{{\\rm Hz}}$. The background magnetic field averaged along the beamline\nis maintained below 3 pT, with typical gradients of a few nT/m. An electric\nfield of 20 kV/cm is applied without discharges and with leakage currents below\n1 nA. Each magnetometer measures the magnetic field correlated with the\ndirection of the applied electric field with a precision of 0.11 fT in 104\nhours of data. These results demonstrate that the apparatus is suitable for\nmeasuring the electron EDM with precision at the $10^{-31}$ e cm level. The\ndesign principles and characterization techniques presented here are broadly\napplicable to precision measurements probing fundamental symmetries in\nmolecules, atoms, and neutrons.",

To ensure compression performance while directly\nleveraging anchor tokens, SAC incorporates two key designs: (1) anchor\nembeddings that enable the compressor to identify critical tokens, and (2)\nbidirectional attention modification that allows anchor tokens to capture\ninformation from the entire context.

Even small\ninefficiencies in the allocators ripple through caches and the rest of the\nmemory hierarchy, collectively imposing what operators often call a \"datacenter\ntax\". At hyperscale, even a 1% improvement in allocator efficiency can unlock\nmillions of dollars in savings and measurable reductions in datacenter energy\nconsumption. Modern memory allocators are designed to optimize allocation speed\nand memory fragmentation in multi-threaded environments, relying on complex\nmetadata and control logic to achieve high performance. However, the overhead\nintroduced by this complexity prompts a reevaluation of allocator design.\nNotably, such overhead can be avoided in single-threaded scenarios, which\ncontinue to be widely used across diverse application domains.\n  In this paper, we introduce Exgen-Malloc, a memory allocator purpose-built\nfor single-threaded applications. By specializing for single-threaded\nexecution, Exgen-Malloc eliminates unnecessary metadata, simplifies the control\nflow, thereby reducing overhead and improving allocation efficiency. Its core\ndesign features include a centralized heap, a single free-block list, and a\nbalanced strategy for memory commitment and relocation. Additionally,\nExgen-Malloc incorporates design principles in modern multi-threaded\nallocators, which do not exist in legacy single-threaded allocators such as\ndlmalloc. We evaluate Exgen-Malloc on two Intel Xeon platforms. Across both\nsystems, Exgen-Malloc achieves a speedup of 1.17x, 1.10x, and 1.93x over\ndlmalloc on SPEC CPU2017, redis-benchmark, and mimalloc-bench, respectively. In\naddition to performance, Exgen-Malloc achieves 6.2%, 0.1%, and 25.2% memory\nsavings over mimalloc on SPEC CPU2017, redis-benchmark, and mimalloc-bench,\nrespectively.",

Modern memory allocators are designed to optimize allocation speed\nand memory fragmentation in multi-threaded environments, relying on complex\nmetadata and control logic to achieve high performance. However, the overhead\nintroduced by this complexity prompts a reevaluation of allocator design.\nNotably, such overhead can be avoided in single-threaded scenarios, which\ncontinue to be widely used across diverse application domains.\n  In this paper, we introduce Exgen-Malloc, a memory allocator purpose-built\nfor single-threaded applications. By specializing for single-threaded\nexecution, Exgen-Malloc eliminates unnecessary metadata, simplifies the control\nflow, thereby reducing overhead and improving allocation efficiency. Its core\ndesign features include a centralized heap, a single free-block list, and a\nbalanced strategy for memory commitment and relocation. Additionally,\nExgen-Malloc incorporates design principles in modern multi-threaded\nallocators, which do not exist in legacy single-threaded allocators such as\ndlmalloc. We evaluate Exgen-Malloc on two Intel Xeon platforms. Across both\nsystems, Exgen-Malloc achieves a speedup of 1.17x, 1.10x, and 1.93x over\ndlmalloc on SPEC CPU2017, redis-benchmark, and mimalloc-bench, respectively. In\naddition to performance, Exgen-Malloc achieves 6.2%, 0.1%, and 25.2% memory\nsavings over mimalloc on SPEC CPU2017, redis-benchmark, and mimalloc-bench,\nrespectively."

                "summary": "Vision-language models (VLMs) could power real-time assistants and autonomous\nagents, but they face a critical challenge: understanding near-infinite video\nstreams without escalating latency and memory usage. Processing entire videos\nwith full attention leads to quadratic computational costs and poor performance\non long videos. Meanwhile, simple sliding window methods are also flawed, as\nthey either break coherence or suffer from high latency due to redundant\nrecomputation. In this paper, we introduce StreamingVLM, a model designed for\nreal-time, stable understanding of infinite visual input. Our approach is a\nunified framework that aligns training with streaming inference. During\ninference, we maintain a compact KV cache by reusing states of attention sinks,\na short window of recent vision tokens, and a long window of recent text\ntokens. This streaming ability is instilled via a simple supervised fine-tuning\n(SFT) strategy that applies full attention on short, overlapped video chunks,\nwhich effectively mimics the inference-time attention pattern without training\non prohibitively long contexts. For evaluation, we build Inf-Streams-Eval, a\nnew benchmark with videos averaging over two hours that requires dense,\nper-second alignment between frames and text. On Inf-Streams-Eval, StreamingVLM\nachieves a 66.18% win rate against GPT-4O mini and maintains stable, real-time\nperformance at up to 8 FPS on a single NVIDIA H100. Notably, our SFT strategy\nalso enhances general VQA abilities without any VQA-specific fine-tuning,\nimproving performance on LongVideoBench by +4.30 and OVOBench Realtime by\n+5.96.

                    "value": "Vision-language models (VLMs) could power real-time assistants and autonomous\nagents, but they face a critical challenge: understanding near-infinite video\nstreams without escalating latency and memory usage. Processing entire videos\nwith full attention leads to quadratic computational costs and poor performance\non long videos. Meanwhile, simple sliding window methods are also flawed, as\nthey either break coherence or suffer from high latency due to redundant\nrecomputation. In this paper, we introduce StreamingVLM, a model designed for\nreal-time, stable understanding of infinite visual input. Our approach is a\nunified framework that aligns training with streaming inference. During\ninference, we maintain a compact KV cache by reusing states of attention sinks,\na short window of recent vision tokens, and a long window of recent text\ntokens. This streaming ability is instilled via a simple supervised fine-tuning\n(SFT) strategy that applies full attention on short, overlapped video chunks,\nwhich effectively mimics the inference-time attention pattern without training\non prohibitively long contexts. For evaluation, we build Inf-Streams-Eval, a\nnew benchmark with videos averaging over two hours that requires dense,\nper-second alignment between frames and text. On Inf-Streams-Eval, StreamingVLM\nachieves a 66.18% win rate against GPT-4O mini and maintains stable, real-time\nperformance at up to 8 FPS on a single NVIDIA H100. Notably, our SFT strategy\nalso enhances general VQA abilities without any VQA-specific fine-tuning,\nimproving performance on LongVideoBench by +4.30 and OVOBench Realtime by\n+5.96.

However, it exhibits low communication efficiency,\nrestricting its practical applicability. This inefficiency stems from the\nmismatch between the Ring AllGather communication primitive it adopts and the\nAlltoAll topology of modern accelerators. A Ring AllGather primitive is\ncomposed of iterations of ring-styled data transfer, which can only utilize a\nvery limited fraction of an AlltoAll topology.\n  Inspired by the Hamiltonian decomposition of complete directed graphs, we\nidentify that modern accelerator topology can be decomposed into multiple\northogonal ring datapaths which can concurrently transfer data without\ninterference. Based on this, we further observe that the Ring AllGather\nprimitive can also be decomposed into the same number of concurrent ring-styled\ndata transfer at every iteration. Based on these insights, we propose TASP, a\ntopology-aware SP method for long-context LLMs that fully utilizes the\ncommunication capacity of modern accelerators via topology decomposition and\nprimitive decomposition. Experimental results on both single-node and\nmulti-node NVIDIA H100 systems and a single-node AMD MI300X system demonstrate\nthat TASP achieves higher communication efficiency than Ring Attention on these\nmodern accelerator topologies and achieves up to 3.58 speedup than Ring\nAttention and its variant Zigzag-Ring Attention.

                "summary": "Diffusion language models offer parallel token generation and inherent\nbidirectionality, promising more efficient and powerful sequence modeling\ncompared to autoregressive approaches. However, state-of-the-art diffusion\nmodels (e.g., Dream 7B, LLaDA 8B) suffer from slow inference. While they match\nthe quality of similarly sized autoregressive (AR) models (e.g., Qwen2.5 7B,\nLlama3 8B), their iterative denoising requires multiple full-sequence forward\npasses, resulting in high computational costs and latency, particularly for\nlong input prompts and long-context scenarios. Furthermore, parallel token\ngeneration introduces token incoherence problems, and current sampling\nheuristics suffer from significant quality drops with decreasing denoising\nsteps. We address these limitations with two training-free techniques. First,\nwe propose FreeCache, a Key-Value (KV) approximation caching technique that\nreuses stable KV projections across denoising steps, effectively reducing the\ncomputational cost of DLM inference. Second, we introduce Guided Diffusion, a\ntraining-free method that uses a lightweight pretrained autoregressive model to\nsupervise token unmasking, dramatically reducing the total number of denoising\niterations without sacrificing quality. We conduct extensive evaluations on\nopen-source reasoning benchmarks, and our combined methods deliver an average\nof 12.14x end-to-end speedup across various tasks with negligible accuracy\ndegradation. For the first time, diffusion language models achieve a comparable\nand even faster latency as the widely adopted autoregressive models.

                    "value": "Diffusion language models offer parallel token generation and inherent\nbidirectionality, promising more efficient and powerful sequence modeling\ncompared to autoregressive approaches. However, state-of-the-art diffusion\nmodels (e.g., Dream 7B, LLaDA 8B) suffer from slow inference. While they match\nthe quality of similarly sized autoregressive (AR) models (e.g., Qwen2.5 7B,\nLlama3 8B), their iterative denoising requires multiple full-sequence forward\npasses, resulting in high computational costs and latency, particularly for\nlong input prompts and long-context scenarios. Furthermore, parallel token\ngeneration introduces token incoherence problems, and current sampling\nheuristics suffer from significant quality drops with decreasing denoising\nsteps. We address these limitations with two training-free techniques. First,\nwe propose FreeCache, a Key-Value (KV) approximation caching technique that\nreuses stable KV projections across denoising steps, effectively reducing the\ncomputational cost of DLM inference. Second, we introduce Guided Diffusion, a\ntraining-free method that uses a lightweight pretrained autoregressive model to\nsupervise token unmasking, dramatically reducing the total number of denoising\niterations without sacrificing quality. We conduct extensive evaluations on\nopen-source reasoning benchmarks, and our combined methods deliver an average\nof 12.14x end-to-end speedup across various tasks with negligible accuracy\ndegradation. For the first time, diffusion language models achieve a comparable\nand even faster latency as the widely adopted autoregressive models. Our work\nsuccessfully paved the way for scaling up the diffusion language model to a\nbroader scope of applications across different domains."

                "summary": "The immense model sizes of large language models (LLMs) challenge deployment\non memory-limited consumer GPUs. Although model compression and parameter\noffloading are common strategies to address memory limitations, compression can\ndegrade quality, and offloading maintains quality but suffers from slow\ninference. Speculative decoding presents a promising avenue to accelerate\nparameter offloading, utilizing a fast draft model to propose multiple draft\ntokens, which are then verified by the target LLM in parallel with a single\nforward pass. This method reduces the time-consuming data transfers in forward\npasses that involve offloaded weight transfers. Existing methods often rely on\npretrained weights of the same family, but require additional training to align\nwith custom-trained models. Moreover, approaches that involve draft model\ntraining usually yield only modest speedups. This limitation arises from\ninsufficient alignment with the target model, preventing higher token\nacceptance lengths.

                    "value": "The immense model sizes of large language models (LLMs) challenge deployment\non memory-limited consumer GPUs. Although model compression and parameter\noffloading are common strategies to address memory limitations, compression can\ndegrade quality, and offloading maintains quality but suffers from slow\ninference. Speculative decoding presents a promising avenue to accelerate\nparameter offloading, utilizing a fast draft model to propose multiple draft\ntokens, which are then verified by the target LLM in parallel with a single\nforward pass. This method reduces the time-consuming data transfers in forward\npasses that involve offloaded weight transfers. Existing methods often rely on\npretrained weights of the same family, but require additional training to align\nwith custom-trained models. Moreover, approaches that involve draft model\ntraining usually yield only modest speedups. This limitation arises from\ninsufficient alignment with the target model, preventing higher token\nacceptance lengths.

In particular, it supports both\ncache offloading (prefix reuse across queries) and prefill-decode\ndisaggregation (cross-engine cache transfer).

Most recovery occurred during the first two\ncycles, with diminishing improvements in later cycles, indicating that most\nthermally recoverable traps were mitigated early. Capacitance-voltage (C-V)\nmeasurements revealed a substantial reduction in carrier concentration,\ndecreasing from 3.2E16 cm^-3 pre-radiation to 5.5E15 cm^-3 after the first\nelectro-thermal testing cycle, indicating an over 82% reduction.

The breakdown voltage exhibited\na remarkable enhancement, increasing from approximately 300 V to 1.28 kV (a\n~325% improvement) after the first electro-thermal testing, attributed to the\nreduction in carrier concentration by compensating radiation-induced traps.\nSubsequent testing reduced breakdown voltage slightly to 940 V due to partial\nrecovery of carrier concentration, but it remained significantly higher than\npre-radiation levels, highlighting the promise of $\\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ power\ndevices for high-power applications in radiation-intense environments.",

While recent methods have explored quantizing the cache,\nevicting tokens, or using binary sketches for keys (e.g., Loki), these\napproaches often provide an incomplete solution by leaving one component (like\nvalues) uncompressed or by discarding context information. This paper\nintroduces the Hybrid One-Bit KV Cache (H1B-KV), a comprehensive compression\nscheme that radically reduces memory usage without sacrificing context. H1B-KV\nrepresents each key vector using a 1-bit binary sketch, enabling\nhardware-friendly bitwise attention, and further compresses value vectors using\n4-bit quantization. This holistic, hybrid approach allows a 7-billion parameter\nLLM to handle an 8k-token context with under 60 MB of cache memory - a 70x\nreduction.

KV quantization is a key\nlever for reducing cache cost, but accuracy drops sharply as the native KV\ndistribution lacks flatness and thus maintains a wide quantization range. Prior\nwork focuses on isolating outliers, which caps their error but fails to flatten\nthe overall distribution, leaving performance fragile under low-bit settings.\nIn this work, we show that the K cache maintains a stable structure that\nevolves gradually with context, while the V cache carries latent semantic\nregularities. Building on these insights, we propose PatternKV, a\npattern-aligned residual quantization scheme.

Furthermore, we demonstrate\nAx-Prover's assistant capabilities in a practical use case, showing how it\nenabled an expert mathematician to formalize the proof of a complex\ncryptography theorem."

To address this, we\nintroduce CARVQ, a post-training novel Corrective Adaptor combined with group\nResidual Vector Quantization. CARVQ relies on the composition of both linear\nand non-linear maps and mimics the original model embedding to compress to\napproximately 1.6 bits without requiring specialized hardware to support\nlower-bit storage.

We show that in most cases, CARVQ can achieve lower average\nbitwidth-per-parameter while maintaining reasonable perplexity and accuracy\ncompared to scalar quantization. Our contributions include a novel compression\ntechnique that is compatible with state-of-the-art transformer quantization\nmethods and can be seamlessly integrated into any hardware supporting 4-bit\nmemory to reduce the model's memory footprint in memory-constrained devices.\nThis work demonstrates a crucial step toward the efficient deployment of LLMs\non edge devices.",

Experiments across\nmultiple benchmarks and models demonstrate that our framework improves judgment\naccuracy over majority voting while maintaining computational efficiency."

In this work, we propose OmniDraft, a unified framework that\nenables a single draft model to operate with any target model and adapt\ndynamically to user data. We introduce an online n-gram cache with hybrid\ndistillation fine-tuning to address the cross-vocabulary mismatch across draft\nand target models; and further improve decoding speed by leveraging adaptive\ndrafting techniques. OmniDraft is particularly suitable for on-device LLM\napplications where model cost, efficiency and user customization are the major\npoints of contention.

These variations are likely driven by factors such as\nintrinsic dust properties, total dust content, and the dust-star geometry. In\nthis work, we explore how the shape of dust attenuation curves-quantified by\nthe UV-optical slope (S) and UV bump strength (B)-correlates with galaxy\nproperties. Our goal is to identify the key physical mechanisms shaping\nattenuation curves through cosmic time. We build on arXiv:2402.05996, analyzing\n173 dusty galaxies at z ~ 2-11.5, with attenuation curves inferred via SED\nfitting of JWST data using a modified version of BAGPIPES (arXiv:2304.11178).\nWe investigate trends between S, B, and properties inferred from SED fitting:\nAV, SFR, stellar mass (M*), specific SFR (sSFR), mass-weighted stellar age\n(a*), ionization parameter (U), and metallicity (Z). For a subset, we also\nconsider oxygen abundance (12 + log(O/H)), derived via Te-based methods. We\nfind that lower AV galaxies tend to have steeper slopes and stronger UV bumps,\nconsistent with radiative transfer predictions involving dust geometry and\ncontent. S also correlates with a* and sSFR, suggesting that strong radiation\nfields in young, bursty galaxies may destroy small grains, flattening the\nslope. B correlates with 12 + log(O/H), possibly due to metallicity-driven dust\ncomposition changes. Overall, attenuation curve shapes appear most strongly\nlinked to: (1) redshift (dust evolution), (2) AV (RT effects), (3) a* or sSFR\n(radiation field), and (4) oxygen abundance (dust composition).

However, the knowledge updating\nmechanism of LLMs remains largely unexplored due to insufficient, isolated, and\nsmall-scale evaluation. For instance, are LLMs similar to humans in modifying\ncertain knowledge? What differs editing and unlearning as training data\nincreases? This paper proposes KnowledgeSmith, a unified framework to\nsystematically understand the updating mechanism of LLMs. We first cast editing\nand unlearning as instances of one constrained optimization problem. Then, we\npropose an automatic dataset generator that provides structured interventions\nacross multiple graph levels and data scales, enabling controlled studies of\nhow different modification strategies propagate through model knowledge.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate nuanced insights over knowledge propagation,\nplasticity scaling, consistency, and robustness. For instance, our results show\nthat LLMs do not exhibit similar updating as humans for different levels of\nknowledge, and there exists consistency-capacity trade-off. We hope our\nfindings can offer suggestions to the design of more reliable and scalable\nstrategies. Code: https://github.com/AIFrontierLab/KnowledgeSmith.git",

                    "value": "Knowledge editing and machine unlearning are two popular approaches for large\nlanguage models (LLMs) to stay up-to-date. However, the knowledge updating\nmechanism of LLMs remains largely unexplored due to insufficient, isolated, and\nsmall-scale evaluation. For instance, are LLMs similar to humans in modifying\ncertain knowledge? What differs editing and unlearning as training data\nincreases? This paper proposes KnowledgeSmith, a unified framework to\nsystematically understand the updating mechanism of LLMs. We first cast editing\nand unlearning as instances of one constrained optimization problem. Then, we\npropose an automatic dataset generator that provides structured interventions\nacross multiple graph levels and data scales, enabling controlled studies of\nhow different modification strategies propagate through model knowledge.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate nuanced insights over knowledge propagation,\nplasticity scaling, consistency, and robustness. For instance, our results show\nthat LLMs do not exhibit similar updating as humans for different levels of\nknowledge, and there exists consistency-capacity trade-off. We hope our\nfindings can offer suggestions to the design of more reliable and scalable\nstrategies. Code: https://github.com/AIFrontierLab/KnowledgeSmith.git"

Medication\nmanagement is a complex task that requires synthesis of drug formulation and\ncomplete order instructions for safe use. Here, the performance of GPT 4o, an\nLLM available with ChatGPT, was tested for three medication management tasks.\nMethods: GPT-4o performance was tested using three medication tasks:\nidentifying available formulations for a given generic drug name, identifying\ndrug-drug interactions (DDI) for a given medication regimen, and preparing a\nmedication order for a given generic drug name. For each experiment, the models\nraw text response was captured exactly as returned and evaluated using\nclinician evaluation in addition to standard LLM metrics, including Term\nFrequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF IDF) vectors, normalized Levenshtein\nsimilarity, and Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation (ROUGE\n1/ROUGE L F1) between each response and its reference string. Results: For the\nfirst task of drug-formulation matching, GPT-4o had 49% accuracy for generic\nmedications being matched to all available formulations, with an average of\n1.23 omissions per medication and 1.14 hallucinations per medication. For the\nsecond task of drug-drug interaction identification, the accuracy was 54.7% for\nidentifying the DDI pair.

In this work, we\nreframe working memory management as a learnable, intrinsic capability. We\npropose a novel framework, Memory-as-Action, where an agent actively manages\nits working memory by executing explicit editing operations as part of a\nunified policy. This formulation allows an agent, trained via reinforcement\nlearning, to balance memory curation against long-term task objectives under\ngiven resource constraints. However, such memory editing actions break the\nstandard assumption of a continuously growing prefix in LLM interactions,\nleading to what we call trajectory fractures. These non-prefix changes disrupt\nthe causal continuity required by standard policy gradient methods, making\nthose methods inapplicable. To address this, we propose a new algorithm,\nDynamic Context Policy Optimization, which enables stable end-to-end\nreinforcement learning by segmenting trajectories at memory action points and\napplying trajectory-level advantages to the resulting action segments. Our\nresults demonstrate that jointly optimizing for task reasoning and memory\nmanagement in an end-to-end fashion not only reduces overall computational\nconsumption but also improves task performance, driven by adaptive context\ncuration strategies tailored to the model's intrinsic capabilities.",

This formulation allows an agent, trained via reinforcement\nlearning, to balance memory curation against long-term task objectives under\ngiven resource constraints. However, such memory editing actions break the\nstandard assumption of a continuously growing prefix in LLM interactions,\nleading to what we call trajectory fractures. These non-prefix changes disrupt\nthe causal continuity required by standard policy gradient methods, making\nthose methods inapplicable. To address this, we propose a new algorithm,\nDynamic Context Policy Optimization, which enables stable end-to-end\nreinforcement learning by segmenting trajectories at memory action points and\napplying trajectory-level advantages to the resulting action segments. Our\nresults demonstrate that jointly optimizing for task reasoning and memory\nmanagement in an end-to-end fashion not only reduces overall computational\nconsumption but also improves task performance, driven by adaptive context\ncuration strategies tailored to the model's intrinsic capabilities."

                "summary": "With the increasing integration of large language models (LLMs) into\nopen-domain writing, detecting machine-generated text has become a critical\ntask for ensuring content authenticity and trust. Existing approaches rely on\nstatistical discrepancies or model-specific heuristics to distinguish between\nLLM-generated and human-written text. However, these methods struggle in\nreal-world scenarios due to limited generalization, vulnerability to\nparaphrasing, and lack of explainability, particularly when facing stylistic\ndiversity or hybrid human-AI authorship. In this work, we propose\nStyleDecipher, a robust and explainable detection framework that revisits\nLLM-generated text detection using combined feature extractors to quantify\nstylistic differences. By jointly modeling discrete stylistic indicators and\ncontinuous stylistic representations derived from semantic embeddings,\nStyleDecipher captures distinctive style-level divergences between human and\nLLM outputs within a unified representation space. This framework enables\naccurate, explainable, and domain-agnostic detection without requiring access\nto model internals or labeled segments. Extensive experiments across five\ndiverse domains, including news, code, essays, reviews, and academic abstracts,\ndemonstrate that StyleDecipher consistently achieves state-of-the-art in-domain\naccuracy. Moreover, in cross-domain evaluations, it surpasses existing\nbaselines by up to 36.30%, while maintaining robustness against adversarial\nperturbations and mixed human-AI content. Further qualitative and quantitative\nanalysis confirms that stylistic signals provide explainable evidence for\ndistinguishing machine-generated text.

This conveys\nunfaithful information about the uncertain state of the LLMs' knowledge,\ncreating a faithfulness gap that affects even strong LLMs. We introduce\nFaithful Uncertainty Tuning (FUT): a fine-tuning approach that teaches\ninstruction-tuned LLMs to express uncertainty faithfully without altering their\nunderlying answer distribution. We construct training data by augmenting model\nsamples with uncertainty hedges (i.e. verbal cues such as 'possibly' or\n'likely') aligned with sample consistency, requiring no supervision beyond the\nmodel and a set of prompts. We evaluate FUT on open-domain question answering\n(QA) across multiple models and datasets. Our results show that FUT\nsubstantially reduces the faithfulness gap, while preserving QA accuracy and\nintroducing minimal semantic distribution shift. Further analyses demonstrate\nrobustness across decoding strategies, choice of hedgers, and other forms of\nuncertainty expression (i.e. numerical). These findings establish FUT as a\nsimple and effective way to teach LLMs to communicate uncertainty faithfully.",

This conveys\nunfaithful information about the uncertain state of the LLMs' knowledge,\ncreating a faithfulness gap that affects even strong LLMs. We introduce\nFaithful Uncertainty Tuning (FUT): a fine-tuning approach that teaches\ninstruction-tuned LLMs to express uncertainty faithfully without altering their\nunderlying answer distribution. We construct training data by augmenting model\nsamples with uncertainty hedges (i.e. verbal cues such as 'possibly' or\n'likely') aligned with sample consistency, requiring no supervision beyond the\nmodel and a set of prompts. We evaluate FUT on open-domain question answering\n(QA) across multiple models and datasets. Our results show that FUT\nsubstantially reduces the faithfulness gap, while preserving QA accuracy and\nintroducing minimal semantic distribution shift. Further analyses demonstrate\nrobustness across decoding strategies, choice of hedgers, and other forms of\nuncertainty expression (i.e. numerical). These findings establish FUT as a\nsimple and effective way to teach LLMs to communicate uncertainty faithfully."

We developed three artificial\nconsciousnesses (self-awareness, unconsciousness, and preconsciousness) based\non the principles of psychoanalysis. Additionally, we designed 16 characters\nwith different personalities representing the sixteen MBTI types, with several\nattributes such as needs, status, and memories. To determine if our model's\nartificial consciousness exhibits human-like cognition, we created ten distinct\nsituations considering seven attributes such as emotional understanding and\nlogical thinking. The decision-making process of artificial consciousness and\nthe final action were evaluated in three ways: survey evaluation, three-tier\nclassification via ChatGPT, and qualitative review. Both quantitative and\nqualitative analyses indicated a high likelihood of well-simulated\nconsciousness, although the difference in response between different characters\nand consciousnesses was not very significant. This implies that the developed\nmodels incorporating elements of psychoanalysis and personality theory can lead\nto building a more intuitive and adaptable AI system with humanoid\nconsciousness.

We assess whether standard tides can reproduce the present-day\narchitecture of the Quaoar-Weywot system and identify the initial conditions\nrequired.

With the nominal Weywot mass, both tidal prescriptions converge on\nWeywot's observed orbital distance for a wide range of initial orbital\ndistances and eccentricities; eccentricity is damped and present-day tidal\ntorques are negligible, rendering the orbit quasi-stationary. Quaoar's spin,\nhowever, remains essentially unchanged from its inferred primordial period\nbased on its present-day flattening, and does not reproduce the observed value.\nA match is possible only if Weywot is 5-10x more massive than current estimates\nand if its initial eccentricity is finely tuned; such scenarios are\ninconsistent with occultation-derived masses and imply an implausibly dense\nsatellite. Based on the best fitting viscoelastic parameters, the most\nplausible composition for Quaoar is found to be a partially differentiated\ndwarf planet containing roughly equal masses of silicate rock and H2O-dominated\nwarm (150-180K) ices.

Gen-C employs a dual Variational Graph\nAutoencoder (VGAE) architecture that jointly learns connectivity patterns and\nnode features conditioned on textual and structural signals, overcoming the\nlimitations of direct LLM generation to enable scalable, environment-aware\nmulti-agent crowd simulations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Gen-C on\nscenarios with diverse behaviors such as a University Campus and a Train\nStation, showing that it generates heterogeneous crowds, coherent interactions,\nand high-level decision-making patterns consistent with real-world crowd\ndynamics.",

However, these systems face\ntwo major challenges. First, they typically perform modeling and reasoning on\nindividual frames, struggling to capture the temporal context of consecutive\nframes. Second, to reduce the cost of dense frame-level captioning, they adopt\nsparse frame sampling, which risks discarding crucial information. To overcome\nthese limitations, we propose VideoLucy, a deep memory backtracking framework\nfor long video understanding. Inspired by the human recollection process from\ncoarse to fine, VideoLucy employs a hierarchical memory structure with\nprogressive granularity.

In\naddition, we introduce EgoMem, a new benchmark for long video understanding.\nEgoMem is designed to comprehensively evaluate a model's ability to understand\ncomplex events that unfold over time and capture fine-grained details in\nextremely long videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of\nVideoLucy. Built on open-source models, VideoLucy significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods on multiple long video understanding benchmarks,\nachieving performance even surpassing the latest proprietary models such as\nGPT-4o.

The existing\nstate-of-the-art models rely solely on detecting assembly object states in\nindividual video frames.

To\novercome these limitations, we propose Spatio-Temporal Occlusion-Resilient\nModeling for Procedure Step Recognition (STORM-PSR), a dual-stream framework\nfor PSR that leverages both spatial and temporal features. The assembly state\ndetection stream operates effectively with unobstructed views of the object,\nwhile the spatio-temporal stream captures both spatial and temporal features to\nrecognize step completions even under partial occlusion. This stream includes a\nspatial encoder, pre-trained using a novel weakly supervised approach to\ncapture meaningful spatial representations, and a transformer-based temporal\nencoder that learns how these spatial features relate over time. STORM-PSR is\nevaluated on the MECCANO and IndustReal datasets, reducing the average delay\nbetween actual and predicted assembly step completions by 11.2% and 26.1%,\nrespectively, compared to prior methods. We demonstrate that this reduction in\ndelay is driven by the spatio-temporal stream, which does not rely on\nunobstructed views of the object to infer completed steps.

Yet, their adoption in\npractice has been hampered by the lack of such specifications in real world\ncode. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in inferring formal\npostconditions from natural language hints embedded in code such as function\nnames, comments or documentation. Using the generated postconditions as\nspecifications in a subsequent verification, however, often leads verifiers to\nsuggest invalid inputs, hinting at potential issues that ultimately turn out to\nbe false alarms.\n  To address this, we revisit the problem of specification inference from\nnatural language in the context of automatic software verification. In the\nprocess, we introduce NL2Contract, the task of employing LLMs to translate\ninformal natural language into formal functional contracts, consisting of\npostconditions as well as preconditions. We introduce metrics to validate and\ncompare different NL2Contract approaches, using soundness, bug discriminative\npower of the generated contracts and their usability in the context of\nautomatic software verification as key metrics. We evaluate NL2Contract with\ndifferent LLMs and compare it to the task of postcondition generation\nnl2postcond. Our evaluation shows that (1) LLMs are generally effective at\ngenerating functional contracts sound for all possible inputs, (2) the\ngenerated contracts are sufficiently expressive for discriminating buggy from\ncorrect behavior, and (3) verifiers supplied with LLM inferred functional\ncontracts produce fewer false alarms than when provided with postconditions\nalone. Further investigations show that LLM inferred preconditions generally\nalign well with developers intentions which allows us to use automatic software\nverifiers to catch real-world bugs.",

Yet\nour experiments reveal that current hybrid thinking LLMs only achieve partial\nmode separation: reasoning behaviors often leak into the no-think mode. To\nunderstand and mitigate this, we analyze the factors influencing\ncontrollability and identify four that matter most: (1) larger data scale, (2)\nusing think and no-think answers from different questions rather than the same\nquestion, (3) a moderate increase in no-think data number, and (4) a two-phase\nstrategy that first trains reasoning ability and then applies hybrid think\ntraining. Building on these findings, we propose a practical recipe that,\ncompared to standard training, can maintain accuracy in both modes while\nsignificantly reducing no-think output length (from $1085$ to $585$ on MATH500)\nand occurrences of reasoning-supportive tokens such as ``\\texttt{wait}'' (from\n$5917$ to $522$ on MATH500).

                "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning\ncapabilities under the widely adopted SFT+RLVR paradigm, which first performs\nSupervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on human-annotated reasoning trajectories\n(rationales) to establish initial reasoning behaviors, then applies\nReinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to optimize the model\nusing verifiable signals without golden rationales. However, annotating\nhigh-quality rationales for the SFT stage remains prohibitively expensive. This\npaper investigates when and how rationale annotation costs can be substantially\nreduced without compromising reasoning performance. We identify a broad class\nof problems, termed patterned reasoning tasks, where reasoning follows a fixed,\nprocedural strategy consistent across instances.

                    "value": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning\ncapabilities under the widely adopted SFT+RLVR paradigm, which first performs\nSupervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on human-annotated reasoning trajectories\n(rationales) to establish initial reasoning behaviors, then applies\nReinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to optimize the model\nusing verifiable signals without golden rationales. However, annotating\nhigh-quality rationales for the SFT stage remains prohibitively expensive. This\npaper investigates when and how rationale annotation costs can be substantially\nreduced without compromising reasoning performance. We identify a broad class\nof problems, termed patterned reasoning tasks, where reasoning follows a fixed,\nprocedural strategy consistent across instances.

                "summary": "Human social interactions depend on the ability to infer others' unspoken\nintentions, emotions, and beliefs-a cognitive skill grounded in the\npsychological concept of Theory of Mind (ToM). While large language models\n(LLMs) excel in semantic understanding tasks, they struggle with the ambiguity\nand contextual nuance inherent in human communication. To bridge this gap, we\nintroduce MetaMind, a multi-agent framework inspired by psychological theories\nof metacognition, designed to emulate human-like social reasoning. MetaMind\ndecomposes social understanding into three collaborative stages: (1) a\nTheory-of-Mind Agent generates hypotheses about user mental states (e.g.,\nintent, emotion), (2) a Moral Agent refines these hypotheses using cultural\nnorms and ethical constraints, and (3) a Response Agent generates contextually\nappropriate responses while validating alignment with inferred intent. Our\nframework achieves state-of-the-art performance across three challenging\nbenchmarks, with 35.7% improvement in real-world social scenarios and 6.2% gain\nin ToM reasoning. Notably, it enables LLMs to match human-level performance on\nkey ToM tasks for the first time.

                    "value": "Human social interactions depend on the ability to infer others' unspoken\nintentions, emotions, and beliefs-a cognitive skill grounded in the\npsychological concept of Theory of Mind (ToM). While large language models\n(LLMs) excel in semantic understanding tasks, they struggle with the ambiguity\nand contextual nuance inherent in human communication. To bridge this gap, we\nintroduce MetaMind, a multi-agent framework inspired by psychological theories\nof metacognition, designed to emulate human-like social reasoning. MetaMind\ndecomposes social understanding into three collaborative stages: (1) a\nTheory-of-Mind Agent generates hypotheses about user mental states (e.g.,\nintent, emotion), (2) a Moral Agent refines these hypotheses using cultural\nnorms and ethical constraints, and (3) a Response Agent generates contextually\nappropriate responses while validating alignment with inferred intent. Our\nframework achieves state-of-the-art performance across three challenging\nbenchmarks, with 35.7% improvement in real-world social scenarios and 6.2% gain\nin ToM reasoning. Notably, it enables LLMs to match human-level performance on\nkey ToM tasks for the first time. Ablation studies confirm the necessity of all\ncomponents, which showcase the framework's ability to balance contextual\nplausibility, social appropriateness, and user adaptation.

This framework enables\naccurate, explainable, and domain-agnostic detection without requiring access\nto model internals or labeled segments. Extensive experiments across five\ndiverse domains, including news, code, essays, reviews, and academic abstracts,\ndemonstrate that StyleDecipher consistently achieves state-of-the-art in-domain\naccuracy. Moreover, in cross-domain evaluations, it surpasses existing\nbaselines by up to 36.30%, while maintaining robustness against adversarial\nperturbations and mixed human-AI content. Further qualitative and quantitative\nanalysis confirms that stylistic signals provide explainable evidence for\ndistinguishing machine-generated text.

This paper\nproposes an automated solution framework, MooseAgent, for the multi-physics\nsimulation framework MOOSE, which combines large-scale pre-trained language\nmodels (LLMs) with a multi-agent system. The framework uses LLMs to understand\nuser-described simulation requirements in natural language and employs task\ndecomposition and multi-round iterative verification strategies to\nautomatically generate MOOSE input files. To improve accuracy and reduce model\nhallucinations, the system builds and utilizes a vector database containing\nannotated MOOSE input cards and function documentation. We conducted\nexperimental evaluations on several typical cases, including heat transfer,\nmechanics, phase field, and multi-physics coupling. The results show that\nMooseAgent can automate the MOOSE simulation process to a certain extent,\nespecially demonstrating a high success rate when dealing with relatively\nsimple single-physics problems. The main contribution of this research is the\nproposal of a multi-agent automated framework for MOOSE, which validates its\npotential in simplifying finite element simulation processes and lowering the\nuser barrier, providing new ideas for the development of intelligent finite\nelement simulation software.

                "summary": "Recent studies have explored the deployment of privacy-preserving deep neural\nnetworks utilizing homomorphic encryption (HE), especially for private\ninference (PI). Many works have attempted the approximation-aware training\n(AAT) approach in PI, changing the activation functions of a model to\nlow-degree polynomials that are easier to compute on HE by allowing model\nretraining. However, due to constraints in the training environment, it is\noften necessary to consider post-training approximation (PTA), using the\npre-trained parameters of the existing plaintext model without retraining.\nExisting PTA studies have uniformly approximated the activation function in all\nlayers to a high degree to mitigate accuracy loss from approximation, leading\nto significant time consumption. This study proposes an optimized layerwise\napproximation (OLA), a systematic framework that optimizes both accuracy loss\nand time consumption by using different approximation polynomials for each\nlayer in the PTA scenario. For efficient approximation, we reflect the\nlayerwise impact on the classification accuracy by considering the actual input\ndistribution of each activation function while constructing the optimization\nproblem. Additionally, we provide a dynamic programming technique to solve the\noptimization problem and achieve the optimized layerwise degrees in polynomial\ntime. As a result, the OLA method reduces inference times for the ResNet-20\nmodel and the ResNet-32 model by 3.02 times and 2.82 times, respectively,\ncompared to prior state-of-the-art implementations employing uniform degree\npolynomials. Furthermore, we successfully classified CIFAR-10 by replacing the\nGELU function in the ConvNeXt model with only 3-degree polynomials using the\nproposed method, without modifying the backbone model.",

In this framework, the unaligned upstream model serves\nas the proposal distribution, while the alignment process is framed as\nsecondary sampling based on an autoregressive alignment module that acts as an\nestimator of the importance weights. This design enables a natural detachment\nof the alignment module from the target aligned model, improving flexibility\nand scalability. Based on this model, we derive an efficient sequence-level\ntraining strategy for the alignment module, which operates independently of the\nproposal module. Additionally, we develop a resampling algorithm with iterative\ntoken-level decoding to address the common first-token latency issue in\ncomparable methods.

Building on these findings,\nwe propose CLEAR (Conflict-Localized and Enhanced Attention for RAG), a\nframework that (i) decomposes context into fine-grained sentence-level\nknowledge, (ii) employs hidden-state probing to localize conflicting knowledge,\nand (iii) introduces conflict-aware fine-tuning to guide the model to\naccurately integrate retrieved evidence. Extensive experiments across three\nbenchmarks demonstrate that CLEAR substantially improves both accuracy and\ncontextual faithfulness, consistently outperforming strong baselines under\ndiverse conflict conditions.

However, existing SSC methods\nrelying on temporal stacking or depth projection often lack explicit motion\nreasoning and struggle with occlusions and noisy depth supervision.

We evaluate\ndiscovered scaffolds on widely recognized reasoning, mathematics, and safety\nbenchmarks and compare them with popular baselines. In \"blue\" mode, we see a\n79.4% average uplift in safety benchmark performance while maintaining or\nimproving capability scores. In \"red\" mode, we find adversarially weak\nscaffolds emerging concurrently with capability optimization. Our work\ndemonstrates the risks of multi-agent scaffolding and provides a framework for\nmitigating them. Code is available at\nhttps://github.com/jrosseruk/AgentBreeder."

This paper presents a\nscoping review of research at the intersection of SE and psychology (PSY),\nfocusing on the use of verbal data. To make large-scale interdisciplinary\nreviews feasible, we employed a large language model (LLM)-assisted screening\npipeline using GPT to assess the relevance of over 9,000 papers based solely on\ntitles. We addressed two questions: what themes emerge from\nverbalization-related work in SE, and how effective are LLMs in supporting\ninterdisciplinary review processes? We validated GPT's outputs against human\nreviewers and found high consistency, with a 13\\% disagreement rate. Prominent\nthemes mainly were tied to the craft of SE, while more human-centered topics\nwere underrepresented. The data also suggests that SE frequently draws on PSY\nmethods, whereas the reverse is rare.",
