                "summary": "Inference for Large Language Models (LLMs) is computationally demanding. To\nreduce the cost of auto-regressive decoding, Key-Value (KV) cache is used to\nstore intermediate activations, which significantly lowers the computational\noverhead for token generation. However, the memory required for the KV cache\ngrows rapidly, often exceeding the capacity of GPU memory. A cost-effective\nalternative is to offload KV cache to CPU memory, which alleviates GPU memory\npressure, but shifts the bottleneck to the limited bandwidth of the PCIe\nconnection between the CPU and GPU. Existing methods attempt to address these\nissues by overlapping GPU computation with I/O or employing CPU-GPU\nheterogeneous execution, but they are hindered by excessive data movement and\ndependence on CPU capabilities. Fully overlapping PCIe communication latency\ngets challenging as the size of the KV cache grows and/or the GPU compute\ncapabilities increase. In this paper, we introduce KVPR, an efficient I/O-aware\nLLM inference method where the CPU first transfers a partial set of\nactivations, from which the GPU can start recomputing the KV cache values.\nWhile the GPU recomputes the partial KV cache, the remaining portion of the KV\ncache is transferred concurrently from the CPU. This approach overlaps GPU\nrecomputation with KV cache transfer to minimize idle GPU time and maximize\ninference performance. KVPR is fully automated by integrating a profiler module\nthat utilizes input characteristics and system hardware information, a\nscheduler module to optimize the distribution of computation and communication\nworkloads, and a runtime module to efficiently execute the derived execution\nplan. Experimental results show that KVPR achieves up to 35.8% lower latency\nand 46.2% higher throughput during decoding compared to state-of-the-art\napproaches.

To\nreduce the cost of auto-regressive decoding, Key-Value (KV) cache is used to\nstore intermediate activations, which significantly lowers the computational\noverhead for token generation. However, the memory required for the KV cache\ngrows rapidly, often exceeding the capacity of GPU memory. A cost-effective\nalternative is to offload KV cache to CPU memory, which alleviates GPU memory\npressure, but shifts the bottleneck to the limited bandwidth of the PCIe\nconnection between the CPU and GPU.

However, emerging AI applications, such as LLM-based\nagents, present unique workload characteristics: instead of diverse independent\nrequests, agentic frameworks typically submit repetitive inference requests,\nsuch as multi-agent pipelines performing similar subtasks or self-refinement\nloops iteratively enhancing outputs. These workloads result in long and highly\npredictable sequences, which current speculative decoding methods do not\neffectively exploit.

This observation suggests that information of\nthe segments between these separator tokens can be effectively condensed into\nthe separator tokens themselves without significant information loss. Guided by\nthis insight, we introduce SepLLM, a plug-and-play framework that accelerates\ninference by compressing these segments and eliminating redundant tokens.\nAdditionally, we implement efficient kernels for training acceleration.\nExperimental results across training-free, training-from-scratch, and\npost-training settings demonstrate SepLLM's effectiveness. Notably, using the\nLlama-3-8B backbone, SepLLM achieves over 50% reduction in KV cache on the\nGSM8K-CoT benchmark while maintaining comparable performance.

                "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities, yet ensuring\ntheir outputs conform to strict structural or grammatical constraints remains\nchallenging, which is critical in function calls and domain-specific language\n(DSL) generation. Constrained decoding with context-free grammar is a flexible\napproach to guarantee LLMs' adherence to a specific format by dynamically\nbuilding a token logits mask. However, creating this mask requires checking the\nvalidity of all tokens in the LLM vocabulary at every decoding step, which\noften incurs significant overheads in existing constrained decoding engines. To\naddress this challenge, we propose $\\textbf{ZapFormat}$, a novel\n$\\textbf{dynamic pruning}$ strategy based on the Earley algorithm that\nidentifies and eliminates invalid or redundant Earley states in real-time,\nsignificantly reducing memory occupation of the Earley algorithm's states. This\nfurther enables us to use a state cache to speed up structured generations on a\nlarge number of queries. We implemented ZapFormat in a new constrained decoding\nengine called Formatron which also incorporates existing optimizations. Through\ncomprehensive experiments on structured generation tasks, including JSON\ngeneration, JSON Schema validation, and semantic parsing, we demonstrate that\nFormatron not only $\\textbf{consistently maintains}$ high-precision compliant\noutputs but also achieves $\\textbf{significant improvements}$ in inference\nspeed up to 2x compared to state-of-the-art implementations. More importantly,\nFormatron is generally applicable across various LLM architectures. We release\nFormatron as open source at https://github.com/Dan-wanna-M/formatron.",

                    "value": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities, yet ensuring\ntheir outputs conform to strict structural or grammatical constraints remains\nchallenging, which is critical in function calls and domain-specific language\n(DSL) generation. Constrained decoding with context-free grammar is a flexible\napproach to guarantee LLMs' adherence to a specific format by dynamically\nbuilding a token logits mask. However, creating this mask requires checking the\nvalidity of all tokens in the LLM vocabulary at every decoding step, which\noften incurs significant overheads in existing constrained decoding engines. To\naddress this challenge, we propose $\\textbf{ZapFormat}$, a novel\n$\\textbf{dynamic pruning}$ strategy based on the Earley algorithm that\nidentifies and eliminates invalid or redundant Earley states in real-time,\nsignificantly reducing memory occupation of the Earley algorithm's states. This\nfurther enables us to use a state cache to speed up structured generations on a\nlarge number of queries. We implemented ZapFormat in a new constrained decoding\nengine called Formatron which also incorporates existing optimizations. Through\ncomprehensive experiments on structured generation tasks, including JSON\ngeneration, JSON Schema validation, and semantic parsing, we demonstrate that\nFormatron not only $\\textbf{consistently maintains}$ high-precision compliant\noutputs but also achieves $\\textbf{significant improvements}$ in inference\nspeed up to 2x compared to state-of-the-art implementations. More importantly,\nFormatron is generally applicable across various LLM architectures. We release\nFormatron as open source at https://github.com/Dan-wanna-M/formatron."

While\npromising, they commonly rely on two optimistic assumptions: 1) full access to\nthe parameters of a PTM, and 2) sufficient memory capacity to cache all\nintermediate activations for gradient computation. However, in most real-world\napplications, PTMs serve as black-box APIs or proprietary software without full\nparameter accessibility. Besides, it is hard to meet a large memory requirement\nfor modern PTMs. This work proposes black-box visual prompting (BlackVIP),\nwhich efficiently adapts the PTMs without knowledge of their architectures or\nparameters. BlackVIP has two components: 1) Coordinator and 2) simultaneous\nperturbation stochastic approximation with gradient correction (SPSA-GC). The\nCoordinator designs input-dependent visual prompts, which allow the target PTM\nto adapt in the wild. SPSA-GC efficiently estimates the gradient of PTM to\nupdate Coordinator. Besides, we introduce a variant, BlackVIP-SE, which\nsignificantly reduces the runtime and computational cost of BlackVIP. Extensive\nexperiments on 19 datasets demonstrate that BlackVIPs enable robust adaptation\nto diverse domains and tasks with minimal memory requirements. We further\nprovide a theoretical analysis on the generalization of visual prompting\nmethods by presenting their connection to the certified robustness of\nrandomized smoothing, and presenting an empirical support for improved\nrobustness.",

To address these challenges, we propose QuickVideo, a\nsystem-algorithm co-design that substantially accelerates long-video\nunderstanding to support real-time downstream applications. It comprises three\nkey innovations: QuickDecoder, a parallelized CPU-based video decoder that\nachieves 2-3 times speedup by splitting videos into keyframe-aligned intervals\nprocessed concurrently; QuickPrefill, a memory-efficient prefilling method\nusing KV-cache pruning to support more frames with less GPU memory; and an\noverlapping scheme that overlaps CPU video decoding with GPU inference.\nTogether, these components infernece time reduce by a minute on long video\ninputs, enabling scalable, high-quality video understanding even on limited\nhardware. Experiments show that QuickVideo generalizes across durations and\nsampling rates, making long video processing feasible in practice.",

Existing methods\nfor WSN anomaly detection often face challenges such as the limited extraction\nof spatiotemporal correlation features, the absence of sample labels, few\nanomaly samples, and an imbalanced sample distribution. To address these\nissues, a spatiotemporal correlation detection model (MTAD-RD) considering both\nmodel architecture and a two-stage training strategy perspective is proposed.\nIn terms of model structure design, the proposed MTAD-RD backbone network\nincludes a retentive network (RetNet) enhanced by a cross-retention (CR)\nmodule, a multigranular feature fusion module, and a graph attention network\nmodule to extract internode correlation information. This proposed model can\nintegrate the intermodal correlation features and spatial features of WSN\nneighbor nodes while extracting global information from time series data.\nMoreover, its serialized inference characteristic can remarkably reduce\ninference overhead. For model training, a two-stage training approach was\ndesigned. First, a contrastive learning proxy task was designed for time series\ndata with graph structure information in WSNs, enabling the backbone network to\nlearn transferable features from unlabeled data using unsupervised contrastive\nlearning methods, thereby addressing the issue of missing sample labels in the\ndataset. Then, a caching-based sample sampler was designed to divide samples\ninto few-shot and contrastive learning data. A specific joint loss function was\ndeveloped to jointly train the dual-graph discriminator network to address the\nproblem of sample imbalance effectively. In experiments carried out on real\npublic datasets, the designed MTAD-RD anomaly detection method achieved an F1\nscore of 90.97%, outperforming existing supervised WSN anomaly detection\nmethods.",

However, natural language exhibits inherent semantic\nhierarchies and nuanced geometric structure, which current LLMs do not capture\ncompletely owing to their reliance on Euclidean operations. Recent studies have\nalso shown that not respecting the geometry of token embeddings leads to\ntraining instabilities and degradation of generative capabilities. These\nfindings suggest that shifting to non-Euclidean geometries can better align\nlanguage models with the underlying geometry of text. We thus propose to\noperate fully in Hyperbolic space, known for its expansive, scale-free, and\nlow-distortion properties. We thus introduce HELM, a family of HypErbolic Large\nLanguage Models, offering a geometric rethinking of the Transformer-based LLM\nthat addresses the representational inflexibility, missing set of necessary\noperations, and poor scalability of existing hyperbolic LMs. We additionally\nintroduce a Mixture-of-Curvature Experts model, HELM-MICE, where each expert\noperates in a distinct curvature space to encode more fine-grained geometric\nstructure from text, as well as a dense model, HELM-D. For HELM-MICE, we\nfurther develop hyperbolic Multi-Head Latent Attention (HMLA) for efficient,\nreduced-KV-cache training and inference. For both models, we develop essential\nhyperbolic equivalents of rotary positional encodings and RMS normalization. We\nare the first to train fully hyperbolic LLMs at billion-parameter scale, and\nevaluate them on well-known benchmarks such as MMLU and ARC, spanning STEM\nproblem-solving, general knowledge, and commonsense reasoning. Our results show\nconsistent gains from our HELM architectures -- up to 4% -- over popular\nEuclidean architectures used in LLaMA and DeepSeek, highlighting the efficacy\nand enhanced reasoning afforded by hyperbolic geometry in large-scale LM\npretraining.",

                "summary": "Serving Large Language Models (LLMs) efficiently in multi-region setups\nremains a challenge. Due to cost and GPU availability concerns, providers\ntypically deploy LLMs in multiple regions using instance with long-term\ncommitments, like reserved instances or on-premise clusters, which are often\nunderutilized due to their region-local traffic handling and diurnal traffic\nvariance. In this paper, we introduce SkyLB, a locality-aware multi-region load\nbalancer for LLM inference that aggregates regional diurnal patterns through\ncross-region traffic handling. By doing so, SkyLB enables providers to reserve\ninstances based on expected global demand, rather than peak demand in each\nindividual region. Meanwhile, SkyLB preserves KV-Cache locality and a balanced\nload, ensuring cost efficiency without sacrificing performance. SkyLB achieves\nthis with a cache-aware cross-region traffic handler and a selective pushing\nload balancing mechanism based on checking pending requests. Our evaluation on\nreal-world workloads shows that it achieves 1.12-2.06x higher throughput and\n1.74-6.30x lower latency compared to existing load balancers, while reducing\ntotal serving cost by 25%.",

The performance heterogeneity inherent in S-NUCA systems\ncomplicates task scheduling due to varying cache access latencies across cores.\nThis paper introduces a novel QoS management policy to maintain application\nexecution within predefined Quality of Service (QoS) targets, measured using\nthe Application Heartbeats framework. QoS metrics like Heartbeats ensure\npredictable application performance in dynamic computing environments. The\nproposed policy dynamically controls QoS by orchestrating task migrations\nwithin the S-NUCA many-core system and adjusting the clock frequency of cores.\nAfter satisfying the QoS objectives, the policy optimizes energy efficiency,\nreducing overall system energy consumption without compromising performance\nconstraints. Our work leverages the state-of-the-art multi-/many-core simulator\n{\\em HotSniper}. We have extended it with two key components: an integrated\nheartbeat framework for precise, application-specific performance monitoring,\nand our QoS management policy that maintains application QoS requirements while\nminimizing the system's energy consumption.

                    "value": "Optimizing performance and energy efficiency in many-core processors,\nespecially within Non-Uniform Cache Access (NUCA) architectures, remains a\ncritical challenge. The performance heterogeneity inherent in S-NUCA systems\ncomplicates task scheduling due to varying cache access latencies across cores.\nThis paper introduces a novel QoS management policy to maintain application\nexecution within predefined Quality of Service (QoS) targets, measured using\nthe Application Heartbeats framework. QoS metrics like Heartbeats ensure\npredictable application performance in dynamic computing environments. The\nproposed policy dynamically controls QoS by orchestrating task migrations\nwithin the S-NUCA many-core system and adjusting the clock frequency of cores.\nAfter satisfying the QoS objectives, the policy optimizes energy efficiency,\nreducing overall system energy consumption without compromising performance\nconstraints. Our work leverages the state-of-the-art multi-/many-core simulator\n{\\em HotSniper}. We have extended it with two key components: an integrated\nheartbeat framework for precise, application-specific performance monitoring,\nand our QoS management policy that maintains application QoS requirements while\nminimizing the system's energy consumption. Experimental evaluations\ndemonstrate that our approach effectively maintains desired QoS levels and\nachieves 18.7\\% energy savings compared to state-of-the-art scheduling methods."

The core idea is that, instead of\ngenerating an entire video on a single GPU, we parallelize both temporal frames\nand model layers across GPUs. However, a naive implementation of this division\nfaces a key limitation: since diffusion models require synchronized noise\nlevels across frames, this implementation leads to the serialization of\noriginal parallelisms. We leverage a block-wise denoising scheme to handle\nthis. Namely, we process a sequence of frame blocks through the pipeline with\nprogressively decreasing noise levels. Each GPU handles a specific block and\nlayer subset while passing previous results to the next GPU, enabling\nasynchronous computation and communication. To further optimize performance, we\nincorporate two key enhancements. Firstly, a feature cache is implemented on\neach GPU to store and reuse features from the prior block as context,\nminimizing inter-GPU communication and redundant computation. Secondly, we\nemploy a coordinated noise initialization strategy, ensuring globally\nconsistent temporal dynamics by sharing initial noise patterns across GPUs\nwithout extra resource costs. Together, these enable fast, artifact-free, and\ninfinitely long video generation.

Quantization\nis a promising approach for compressing KV cache activations; however, existing\nsolutions fail to represent activations accurately in sub-4-bit precision. Our\nwork, KVQuant, facilitates low precision KV cache quantization by incorporating\nseveral novel methods: (i) Per-Channel Key Quantization, where we adjust the\ndimension along which we quantize the Key activations to better match the\ndistribution; (ii) Pre-RoPE Key Quantization, where we quantize Key activations\nbefore the rotary positional embedding to mitigate its impact on quantization;\n(iii) Non-Uniform KV Cache Quantization, where we derive per-layer\nsensitivity-weighted non-uniform datatypes that better represent the\ndistributions; and (iv) Per-Vector Dense-and-Sparse Quantization, where we\nisolate outliers separately for each vector to minimize skews in quantization\nranges. By applying our method to the LLaMA, Llama-2, Llama-3, and Mistral\nmodels, we achieve < 0.1 perplexity degradation with 3-bit quantization on both\nWikitext-2 and C4, outperforming existing approaches. Our method enables\nserving LLaMA-7B with a context length of up to 1 million on a single A100-80GB\nGPU and up to 10 million on an 8-GPU system. We develop custom CUDA kernels for\nKVQuant, showing that we can achieve up to ~1.7x speedups, compared to baseline\nfp16 matrix-vector multiplications, for the LLaMA-7B model.",

However, since practical video caching networks involve various\nparties (e.g., users, isp, and csp) that do not wish to reveal information such\nas past history to each other, privacy-preserving solutions are required.\nMotivated by this, we propose a proactive caching method based on users'\nprivacy-preserving multi-slot future demand predictions -- obtained from a\ntrained Transformer -- to optimize revenue. Specifically, we first use a\nprivacy-preserving fl algorithm to train a Transformer to predict multi-slot\nfuture demands of the users. However, prediction accuracy is not perfect and\ndecreases the farther into the future the prediction is done. We model the\nimpact of prediction errors invoking the file popularities, based on which we\nformulate a long-term system revenue optimization to make the cache placement\ndecisions. As the formulated problem is NP-hard, we use a greedy algorithm to\nefficiently obtain an approximate solution. Simulation results validate that\n(i) the fl solution achieves results close to the centralized\n(non-privacy-preserving) solution and (ii) optimization of revenue may provide\ndifferent solutions than the classical chr criterion.",

However, since practical video caching networks involve various\nparties (e.g., users, isp, and csp) that do not wish to reveal information such\nas past history to each other, privacy-preserving solutions are required.\nMotivated by this, we propose a proactive caching method based on users'\nprivacy-preserving multi-slot future demand predictions -- obtained from a\ntrained Transformer -- to optimize revenue. Specifically, we first use a\nprivacy-preserving fl algorithm to train a Transformer to predict multi-slot\nfuture demands of the users. However, prediction accuracy is not perfect and\ndecreases the farther into the future the prediction is done. We model the\nimpact of prediction errors invoking the file popularities, based on which we\nformulate a long-term system revenue optimization to make the cache placement\ndecisions. As the formulated problem is NP-hard, we use a greedy algorithm to\nefficiently obtain an approximate solution. Simulation results validate that\n(i) the fl solution achieves results close to the centralized\n(non-privacy-preserving) solution and (ii) optimization of revenue may provide\ndifferent solutions than the classical chr criterion."

However, state-of-the-art diffusion\nmodels (e.g., Dream 7B, LLaDA 8B) suffer from slow inference. While they match\nthe quality of similarly sized Autoregressive (AR) Models (e.g., Qwen2.5 7B,\nLlama3 8B), their iterative denoising requires multiple full-sequence forward\npasses, resulting in high computational costs and latency, particularly for\nlong input prompts and long-context scenarios. Furthermore, parallel token\ngeneration introduces token incoherence problems, and current sampling\nheuristics suffer from significant quality drops with decreasing denoising\nsteps. We address these limitations with two training-free techniques. First,\nwe propose FreeCache, a Key-Value (KV) approximation caching technique that\nreuses stable KV projections across denoising steps, effectively reducing the\ncomputational cost of DLM inference. Second, we introduce Guided Diffusion, a\ntraining-free method that uses a lightweight pretrained autoregressive model to\nsupervise token unmasking, dramatically reducing the total number of denoising\niterations without sacrificing quality. We conduct extensive evaluations on\nopen-source reasoning benchmarks, and our combined methods deliver up to a 34x\nend-to-end speedup without compromising accuracy.

In production environments, image\nediting typically involves a mask that specifies the regions of an image\ntemplate to be edited. The use of masks provides direct control over the\nediting process and introduces sparsity in the model inference. In this paper,\nwe present InstGenIE, a system that efficiently serves image editing requests.\nThe key insight behind InstGenIE is that image editing only modifies the masked\nregions of image templates while preserving the original content in the\nunmasked areas.

To mitigate the high cache loading\noverhead, InstGenIE employs a bubble-free pipeline scheme that overlaps\ncomputation with cache loading. Additionally, to reduce queuing latency in\nonline serving while improving the GPU utilization, InstGenIE proposes a novel\ncontinuous batching strategy for diffusion model serving, allowing newly\narrived requests to join the running batch in just one step of denoising\ncomputation, without waiting for the entire batch to complete. As heterogeneous\nmasks induce imbalanced loads, InstGenIE also develops a load balancing\nstrategy that takes into account the loads of both computation and cache\nloading.

Existing solutions such as \"keep-alive\" or \"pre-warming\"\nare costly and unreliable under bursty workloads. We propose universal workers,\nwhich are computational units capable of executing any function with minimal\ninitialization overhead.

This raises a research\nquestion: how to pinpoint the texts (e.g., sentences, passages, or paragraphs)\nin the context that contribute most to or are responsible for the generated\noutput by an LLM? This process, which we call context traceback, has various\nreal-world applications, such as 1) debugging LLM-based systems, 2) conducting\npost-attack forensic analysis for attacks (e.g., prompt injection attack,\nknowledge corruption attacks) to an LLM, and 3) highlighting knowledge sources\nto enhance the trust of users towards outputs generated by LLMs. When applied\nto context traceback for long context LLMs, existing feature attribution\nmethods such as Shapley have sub-optimal performance and/or incur a large\ncomputational cost. In this work, we develop TracLLM, the first generic context\ntraceback framework tailored to long context LLMs. Our framework can improve\nthe effectiveness and efficiency of existing feature attribution methods. To\nimprove the efficiency, we develop an informed search based algorithm in\nTracLLM. We also develop contribution score ensemble/denoising techniques to\nimprove the accuracy of TracLLM. Our evaluation results show TracLLM can\neffectively identify texts in a long context that lead to the output of an LLM.\nOur code and data are at: https://github.com/Wang-Yanting/TracLLM.",

This process, which we call context traceback, has various\nreal-world applications, such as 1) debugging LLM-based systems, 2) conducting\npost-attack forensic analysis for attacks (e.g., prompt injection attack,\nknowledge corruption attacks) to an LLM, and 3) highlighting knowledge sources\nto enhance the trust of users towards outputs generated by LLMs. When applied\nto context traceback for long context LLMs, existing feature attribution\nmethods such as Shapley have sub-optimal performance and/or incur a large\ncomputational cost. In this work, we develop TracLLM, the first generic context\ntraceback framework tailored to long context LLMs. Our framework can improve\nthe effectiveness and efficiency of existing feature attribution methods. To\nimprove the efficiency, we develop an informed search based algorithm in\nTracLLM. We also develop contribution score ensemble/denoising techniques to\nimprove the accuracy of TracLLM. Our evaluation results show TracLLM can\neffectively identify texts in a long context that lead to the output of an LLM.\nOur code and data are at: https://github.com/Wang-Yanting/TracLLM."

Layer pruning has emerged as a strategy to alleviate these\ninefficiencies, but conventional static pruning methods overlook two critical\ndynamics inherent to LLM inference: (1) horizontal dynamics, where token-level\nheterogeneity demands context-aware pruning decisions, and (2) vertical\ndynamics, where the distinct functional roles of MLP and self-attention layers\nnecessitate component-specific pruning policies. We introduce SkipGPT, a\ndynamic layer pruning framework designed to optimize computational resource\nallocation through two core innovations: (1) global token-aware routing to\nprioritize critical tokens, and (2) decoupled pruning policies for MLP and\nself-attention components. To mitigate training instability, we propose a\ntwo-stage optimization paradigm: first, a disentangled training phase that\nlearns routing strategies via soft parameterization to avoid premature pruning\ndecisions, followed by parameter-efficient LoRA fine-tuning to restore\nperformance impacted by layer removal. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nSkipGPT reduces over 40% of model parameters while matching or exceeding the\nperformance of the original dense model across benchmarks. By harmonizing\ndynamic efficiency with preserved expressivity, SkipGPT advances the practical\ndeployment of scalable, resource-aware LLMs. Our code is publicly available at:\nhttps://github.com/EIT-NLP/SkipGPT.",

We test this approach with two\nclass-imbalanced binary classification datasets and evaluate the effectiveness\nof imputation using classification-based evaluation metrics. The experimental\nresults demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces the input prompt\nsize while maintaining or improving imputation quality compared to our baseline\nprompt, especially for datasets that are of relatively smaller in size. The\ncontributions of this presented work is two-fold -- 1) it sheds light on the\nimportance of prompt design when leveraging LLMs for synthetic data generation\nand 2) it addresses a critical gap in LLM-based data imputation for\nclass-imbalanced datasets with missing data by providing a practical solution\nwithin computational constraints. We hope that our work will foster further\nresearch and discussions about leveraging the incredible potential of LLMs and\nprompt engineering techniques for synthetic data generation.",

To our knowledge, no existing dataset captures patient\ninformation needs in the context of their EHRs. We introduce ArchEHR-QA, an\nexpert-annotated dataset based on real-world patient cases from intensive care\nunit and emergency department settings. The cases comprise questions posed by\npatients to public health forums, clinician-interpreted counterparts, relevant\nclinical note excerpts with sentence-level relevance annotations, and\nclinician-authored answers. To establish benchmarks for grounded EHR question\nanswering (QA), we evaluated three open-weight large language models\n(LLMs)--Llama 4, Llama 3, and Mixtral--across three prompting strategies:\ngenerating (1) answers with citations to clinical note sentences, (2) answers\nbefore citations, and (3) answers from filtered citations. We assessed\nperformance on two dimensions: Factuality (overlap between cited note sentences\nand ground truth) and Relevance (textual and semantic similarity between system\nand reference answers). The final dataset contains 134 patient cases. The\nanswer-first prompting approach consistently performed best, with Llama 4\nachieving the highest scores. Manual error analysis supported these findings\nand revealed common issues such as omitted key clinical evidence and\ncontradictory or hallucinated content. Overall, ArchEHR-QA provides a strong\nbenchmark for developing and evaluating patient-centered EHR QA systems,\nunderscoring the need for further progress toward generating factual and\nrelevant responses in clinical contexts.",

                    "value": "Patients have distinct information needs about their hospitalization that can\nbe addressed using clinical evidence from electronic health records (EHRs).\nWhile artificial intelligence (AI) systems show promise in meeting these needs,\nrobust datasets are needed to evaluate the factual accuracy and relevance of\nAI-generated responses. To our knowledge, no existing dataset captures patient\ninformation needs in the context of their EHRs. We introduce ArchEHR-QA, an\nexpert-annotated dataset based on real-world patient cases from intensive care\nunit and emergency department settings. The cases comprise questions posed by\npatients to public health forums, clinician-interpreted counterparts, relevant\nclinical note excerpts with sentence-level relevance annotations, and\nclinician-authored answers. To establish benchmarks for grounded EHR question\nanswering (QA), we evaluated three open-weight large language models\n(LLMs)--Llama 4, Llama 3, and Mixtral--across three prompting strategies:\ngenerating (1) answers with citations to clinical note sentences, (2) answers\nbefore citations, and (3) answers from filtered citations. We assessed\nperformance on two dimensions: Factuality (overlap between cited note sentences\nand ground truth) and Relevance (textual and semantic similarity between system\nand reference answers). The final dataset contains 134 patient cases. The\nanswer-first prompting approach consistently performed best, with Llama 4\nachieving the highest scores. Manual error analysis supported these findings\nand revealed common issues such as omitted key clinical evidence and\ncontradictory or hallucinated content. Overall, ArchEHR-QA provides a strong\nbenchmark for developing and evaluating patient-centered EHR QA systems,\nunderscoring the need for further progress toward generating factual and\nrelevant responses in clinical contexts."

While this approach is effective in closed,\nnarrowly scoped environments, it presents two major challenges for real-world,\nopen-ended scenarios: (1) it significantly restricts the planning and acting\ncapabilities of LLM agents, and (2) it requires substantial human effort to\nenumerate and implement all possible actions, which is impractical in complex\nenvironments with a vast number of potential actions. To address these\nlimitations, we propose an LLM agent framework that can dynamically create and\ncompose actions as needed. In this framework, the agent interacts with its\nenvironment by generating and executing programs written in a general-purpose\nprogramming language. Moreover, generated actions are accumulated over time for\nfuture reuse. Our extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show that\nthis framework significantly improves flexibility and outperforms prior methods\nthat rely on a fixed action set. Notably, it enables LLM agents to adapt and\nrecover in scenarios where predefined actions are insufficient or fail due to\nunforeseen edge cases.

                    "value": "Existing LLM agent systems typically select actions from a fixed and\npredefined set at every step. While this approach is effective in closed,\nnarrowly scoped environments, it presents two major challenges for real-world,\nopen-ended scenarios: (1) it significantly restricts the planning and acting\ncapabilities of LLM agents, and (2) it requires substantial human effort to\nenumerate and implement all possible actions, which is impractical in complex\nenvironments with a vast number of potential actions. To address these\nlimitations, we propose an LLM agent framework that can dynamically create and\ncompose actions as needed. In this framework, the agent interacts with its\nenvironment by generating and executing programs written in a general-purpose\nprogramming language. Moreover, generated actions are accumulated over time for\nfuture reuse. Our extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show that\nthis framework significantly improves flexibility and outperforms prior methods\nthat rely on a fixed action set. Notably, it enables LLM agents to adapt and\nrecover in scenarios where predefined actions are insufficient or fail due to\nunforeseen edge cases. Our code can be found in\nhttps://github.com/adobe-research/dynasaur."

To\nreduce the cost of auto-regressive decoding, Key-Value (KV) cache is used to\nstore intermediate activations, which significantly lowers the computational\noverhead for token generation. However, the memory required for the KV cache\ngrows rapidly, often exceeding the capacity of GPU memory. A cost-effective\nalternative is to offload KV cache to CPU memory, which alleviates GPU memory\npressure, but shifts the bottleneck to the limited bandwidth of the PCIe\nconnection between the CPU and GPU. Existing methods attempt to address these\nissues by overlapping GPU computation with I/O or employing CPU-GPU\nheterogeneous execution, but they are hindered by excessive data movement and\ndependence on CPU capabilities. Fully overlapping PCIe communication latency\ngets challenging as the size of the KV cache grows and/or the GPU compute\ncapabilities increase. In this paper, we introduce KVPR, an efficient I/O-aware\nLLM inference method where the CPU first transfers a partial set of\nactivations, from which the GPU can start recomputing the KV cache values.\nWhile the GPU recomputes the partial KV cache, the remaining portion of the KV\ncache is transferred concurrently from the CPU. This approach overlaps GPU\nrecomputation with KV cache transfer to minimize idle GPU time and maximize\ninference performance. KVPR is fully automated by integrating a profiler module\nthat utilizes input characteristics and system hardware information, a\nscheduler module to optimize the distribution of computation and communication\nworkloads, and a runtime module to efficiently execute the derived execution\nplan. Experimental results show that KVPR achieves up to 35.8% lower latency\nand 46.2% higher throughput during decoding compared to state-of-the-art\napproaches.

Post-challenge\nexperiments reveal that fine-tuning Whisper Large V3 Turbo with the \"Extra\"\nscheme yielded a 5.5% WER, an 11.3% relative improvement over the \"Pure\" scheme\n(6.2% WER). This demonstrates that explicit, realistic filled-pause labeling\nsignificantly enhances ASR accuracy for verbatim L2 speech transcription."

Our findings show that (1) LLMs are more accurate on legal\nevent ordering than on narrative (up to +10.5%); (2) longer input contexts and\nimplicit events boost accuracy, reaching 80.8% for implicit-explicit event\npairs; (3) legal linguistic complexities and nested clauses remain a challenge.\nWe investigate how context length, explicit vs implicit event pairs, and legal\nlanguage features affect model performance, demonstrating the need for specific\nmodeling strategies to enhance temporal event reasoning.",

We introduce LexTime, the first dataset designed to\nevaluate LLMs' event ordering capabilities in legal language, consisting of 512\ninstances from U.S. Federal Complaints with annotated event pairs and their\ntemporal relations. Our findings show that (1) LLMs are more accurate on legal\nevent ordering than on narrative (up to +10.5%); (2) longer input contexts and\nimplicit events boost accuracy, reaching 80.8% for implicit-explicit event\npairs; (3) legal linguistic complexities and nested clauses remain a challenge.\nWe investigate how context length, explicit vs implicit event pairs, and legal\nlanguage features affect model performance, demonstrating the need for specific\nmodeling strategies to enhance temporal event reasoning."

Objectives: (1) To\nconstruct and instantiate a Patient Simulator to train and test an AI health\nagent, based on patient vignettes derived from real EHR data. (2) To test the\nvalidity and alignment of the simulated encounters provided by the Patient\nSimulator to expert human clinical providers. (3) To illustrate the evaluation\nframework of such an LLM system on the generated realistic, data-driven\nsimulations -- yielding a preliminary assessment of our proposed system.\nMethods: We first constructed realistic clinical scenarios by deriving patient\nvignettes from real-world EHR encounters. These vignettes cover a variety of\npresenting symptoms and underlying conditions. We then evaluate the performance\nof the Patient Simulator as a simulacrum of a real patient encounter across\nover 500 different patient vignettes. We leveraged a separate AI agent to\nprovide multi-turn questions to obtain a history of present illness. The\nresulting multiturn conversations were evaluated by two expert clinicians.\nResults: Clinicians scored the Patient Simulator as consistent with the patient\nvignettes in those same 97.7% of cases. The extracted case summary based on the\nconversation history was 99% relevant. Conclusions: We developed a methodology\nto incorporate vignettes derived from real healthcare patient data to build a\nsimulation of patient responses to symptom checking agents.

Finally, we use our 3D B-field model to infer the initial\nmagnetic field orientation in the solar neighborhood prior to the Local\nBubble's formation, and derive an orientation parallel to the present-day Local\nArm of the galaxy.

We present a two-stage\ndeep-learning framework that, without incorporating any time-of-flight (TOF)\ninformation, restores high-quality images from data with about 50% missing\ncoincidences - double the loss levels previously addressed by CNN-based\nmethods. The pipeline operates in two stages: a projection-domain Attention\nU-Net first predicts the missing sections of the sinogram by leveraging spatial\ncontext from neighbouring slices, after which the completed data are\nreconstructed with OSEM algorithm and passed to a U-Net-diffusion module that\nremoves residual artefacts while reinstating high-frequency detail. Using 206\nbrain volumes from a public dataset, the result shows that our model\nsuccessfully preserves most anatomical structures and tracer distribution\nfeatures with PSNR of 30.92 dB and SSIM of 0.9708. We also achieve higher\ninference speed, thus providing an effective solution for incomplete-ring PET\nimaging.",

However, constructing such a\ntree heavily relies on domain expertise, which is time-consuming and\nlabor-intensive. To address this issue, this paper proposes an automatic\nmulti-level feature tree construction framework named FTBUILDER, which consists\nof three stages. It automatically crawls domain-specific software repositories\nand merges their metadata to construct a structured artifact library. It\nemploys clustering algorithms to identify a set of artifacts with common\nfeatures. It constructs a prompt and uses LLMs to summarize their common\nfeatures.

To validate\nFTBUILDER, we conduct experiments from multiple aspects (e.g., tree quality and\ntime cost) using the Linux distribution ecosystem. Specifically, we first\nsimultaneously develop and evaluate 24 alternative solutions in the FTBUILDER.\nWe then construct a three-level feature tree using the best solution among\nthem.

Recently, In-context\nConditioning emerged as a powerful paradigm for unified conditional video\ngeneration, which enables diverse controls by concatenating varying context\nconditioning signals with noisy video latents into a long unified token\nsequence and jointly processing them via full-attention, e.g., FullDiT. Despite\ntheir effectiveness, these methods face quadratic computation overhead as task\ncomplexity increases, hindering practical deployment. In this paper, we study\nthe efficiency bottleneck neglected in original in-context conditioning video\ngeneration framework. We begin with systematic analysis to identify two key\nsources of the computation inefficiencies: the inherent redundancy within\ncontext condition tokens and the computational redundancy in context-latent\ninteractions throughout the diffusion process. Based on these insights, we\npropose FullDiT2, an efficient in-context conditioning framework for general\ncontrollability in both video generation and editing tasks, which innovates\nfrom two key perspectives. Firstly, to address the token redundancy, FullDiT2\nleverages a dynamic token selection mechanism to adaptively identify important\ncontext tokens, reducing the sequence length for unified full-attention.\nAdditionally, a selective context caching mechanism is devised to minimize\nredundant interactions between condition tokens and video latents. Extensive\nexperiments on six diverse conditional video editing and generation tasks\ndemonstrate that FullDiT2 achieves significant computation reduction and 2-3\ntimes speedup in averaged time cost per diffusion step, with minimal\ndegradation or even higher performance in video generation quality.

In this work, we study the problem of CoT\ncondensation for resource-efficient reasoning training, aimed at pruning\nintermediate reasoning steps (i.e., thoughts) in CoT traces, enabling\nsupervised model training on length-reduced CoT data while preserving both\nanswer accuracy and the model's ability to generate coherent reasoning. Our\nrationale is that CoT traces typically follow a three-stage structure: problem\nunderstanding, exploration, and solution convergence. Through empirical\nanalysis, we find that retaining the structure of the reasoning trace,\nespecially the early stage of problem understanding (rich in reflective cues)\nand the final stage of solution convergence, is sufficient to achieve lossless\nreasoning supervision. To this end, we propose an Edge-Preserving Condensation\nmethod, EPiC, which selectively retains only the initial and final segments of\neach CoT trace while discarding the middle portion. This design draws an\nanalogy to preserving the \"edge\" of a reasoning trajectory, capturing both the\ninitial problem framing and the final answer synthesis, to maintain logical\ncontinuity. Experiments across multiple model families (Qwen and LLaMA) and\nbenchmarks show that EPiC reduces training time by over 34% while achieving\nlossless reasoning accuracy on MATH500, comparable to full CoT supervision.

Given\nan instruction and a long context (e.g., documents, PDF files, webpages), a\nlong context LLM can generate an output grounded in the provided context,\naiming to provide more accurate, up-to-date, and verifiable outputs while\nreducing hallucinations and unsupported claims. This raises a research\nquestion: how to pinpoint the texts (e.g., sentences, passages, or paragraphs)\nin the context that contribute most to or are responsible for the generated\noutput by an LLM? This process, which we call context traceback, has various\nreal-world applications, such as 1) debugging LLM-based systems, 2) conducting\npost-attack forensic analysis for attacks (e.g., prompt injection attack,\nknowledge corruption attacks) to an LLM, and 3) highlighting knowledge sources\nto enhance the trust of users towards outputs generated by LLMs. When applied\nto context traceback for long context LLMs, existing feature attribution\nmethods such as Shapley have sub-optimal performance and/or incur a large\ncomputational cost. In this work, we develop TracLLM, the first generic context\ntraceback framework tailored to long context LLMs. Our framework can improve\nthe effectiveness and efficiency of existing feature attribution methods. To\nimprove the efficiency, we develop an informed search based algorithm in\nTracLLM. We also develop contribution score ensemble/denoising techniques to\nimprove the accuracy of TracLLM.

Layer pruning has emerged as a strategy to alleviate these\ninefficiencies, but conventional static pruning methods overlook two critical\ndynamics inherent to LLM inference: (1) horizontal dynamics, where token-level\nheterogeneity demands context-aware pruning decisions, and (2) vertical\ndynamics, where the distinct functional roles of MLP and self-attention layers\nnecessitate component-specific pruning policies. We introduce SkipGPT, a\ndynamic layer pruning framework designed to optimize computational resource\nallocation through two core innovations: (1) global token-aware routing to\nprioritize critical tokens, and (2) decoupled pruning policies for MLP and\nself-attention components. To mitigate training instability, we propose a\ntwo-stage optimization paradigm: first, a disentangled training phase that\nlearns routing strategies via soft parameterization to avoid premature pruning\ndecisions, followed by parameter-efficient LoRA fine-tuning to restore\nperformance impacted by layer removal. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nSkipGPT reduces over 40% of model parameters while matching or exceeding the\nperformance of the original dense model across benchmarks. By harmonizing\ndynamic efficiency with preserved expressivity, SkipGPT advances the practical\ndeployment of scalable, resource-aware LLMs. Our code is publicly available at:\nhttps://github.com/EIT-NLP/SkipGPT.",

This study measures the\nknowledge users acquire with unsupervised, supervised LLM-based exploratory\napproaches or traditional topic models on two datasets. While LLM-based methods\ngenerate more human-readable topics and show higher average win probabilities\nthan traditional models for data exploration, they produce overly generic\ntopics for domain-specific datasets that do not easily allow users to learn\nmuch about the documents. Adding human supervision to the LLM generation\nprocess improves data exploration by mitigating hallucination and\nover-genericity but requires greater human effort. In contrast, traditional.\nmodels like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) remain effective for exploration\nbut are less user-friendly. We show that LLMs struggle to describe the haystack\nof large corpora without human help, particularly domain-specific data, and\nface scaling and hallucination limitations due to context length constraints.",

This study measures the\nknowledge users acquire with unsupervised, supervised LLM-based exploratory\napproaches or traditional topic models on two datasets. While LLM-based methods\ngenerate more human-readable topics and show higher average win probabilities\nthan traditional models for data exploration, they produce overly generic\ntopics for domain-specific datasets that do not easily allow users to learn\nmuch about the documents. Adding human supervision to the LLM generation\nprocess improves data exploration by mitigating hallucination and\nover-genericity but requires greater human effort. In contrast, traditional.\nmodels like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) remain effective for exploration\nbut are less user-friendly. We show that LLMs struggle to describe the haystack\nof large corpora without human help, particularly domain-specific data, and\nface scaling and hallucination limitations due to context length constraints."

However, it is difficult to compare them because they are tested on\ndifferent datasets and there is no universal benchmark. For this reason, we\npropose AmbiK (Ambiguous Tasks in Kitchen Environment), the fully textual\ndataset of ambiguous instructions addressed to a robot in a kitchen\nenvironment. AmbiK was collected with the assistance of LLMs and is\nhuman-validated. It comprises 1000 pairs of ambiguous tasks and their\nunambiguous counterparts, categorized by ambiguity type (Human Preferences,\nCommon Sense Knowledge, Safety), with environment descriptions, clarifying\nquestions and answers, user intents, and task plans, for a total of 2000 tasks.\nWe hope that AmbiK will enable researchers to perform a unified comparison of\nambiguity detection methods.

                    "value": "As a part of an embodied agent, Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically\nused for behavior planning given natural language instructions from the user.\nHowever, dealing with ambiguous instructions in real-world environments remains\na challenge for LLMs. Various methods for task ambiguity detection have been\nproposed. However, it is difficult to compare them because they are tested on\ndifferent datasets and there is no universal benchmark. For this reason, we\npropose AmbiK (Ambiguous Tasks in Kitchen Environment), the fully textual\ndataset of ambiguous instructions addressed to a robot in a kitchen\nenvironment. AmbiK was collected with the assistance of LLMs and is\nhuman-validated. It comprises 1000 pairs of ambiguous tasks and their\nunambiguous counterparts, categorized by ambiguity type (Human Preferences,\nCommon Sense Knowledge, Safety), with environment descriptions, clarifying\nquestions and answers, user intents, and task plans, for a total of 2000 tasks.\nWe hope that AmbiK will enable researchers to perform a unified comparison of\nambiguity detection methods. AmbiK is available at\nhttps://github.com/cog-model/AmbiK-dataset."

This study, hence, focuses\non producing precise, in-situ, step-by-step navigation instructions that are\npractically usable by VI users. Concretely, we propose LaF-GRPO\n(LLM-as-Follower GRPO), where an LLM simulates VI user responses to generate\nrewards guiding the Vision-Language Model (VLM) post-training. This enhances\ninstruction usability while reducing costly real-world data needs. To\nfacilitate training and testing, we introduce NIG4VI, a 27k-sample open-sourced\nbenchmark. It provides diverse navigation scenarios with accurate spatial\ncoordinates, supporting detailed, open-ended in-situ instruction generation.\nExperiments on NIG4VI show the effectiveness of LaF-GRPO by quantitative\nmetrics (e.g., Zero-(LaF-GRPO) boosts BLEU +14\\%; SFT+(LaF-GRPO) METEOR 0.542\nvs. GPT-4o's 0.323) and yields more intuitive, safer instructions.

This study, hence, focuses\non producing precise, in-situ, step-by-step navigation instructions that are\npractically usable by VI users. Concretely, we propose LaF-GRPO\n(LLM-as-Follower GRPO), where an LLM simulates VI user responses to generate\nrewards guiding the Vision-Language Model (VLM) post-training. This enhances\ninstruction usability while reducing costly real-world data needs. To\nfacilitate training and testing, we introduce NIG4VI, a 27k-sample open-sourced\nbenchmark. It provides diverse navigation scenarios with accurate spatial\ncoordinates, supporting detailed, open-ended in-situ instruction generation.\nExperiments on NIG4VI show the effectiveness of LaF-GRPO by quantitative\nmetrics (e.g., Zero-(LaF-GRPO) boosts BLEU +14\\%; SFT+(LaF-GRPO) METEOR 0.542\nvs. GPT-4o's 0.323) and yields more intuitive, safer instructions.

This\nchallenge becomes severe, particularly in under-explored and low-resource\nlanguages like Arabic. This paper presents a comprehensive investigation of\nArabic machine-generated text, examining multiple generation strategies\n(generation from the title only, content-aware generation, and text refinement)\nacross diverse model architectures (ALLaM, Jais, Llama, and GPT-4) in academic,\nand social media domains. Our stylometric analysis reveals distinctive\nlinguistic patterns differentiating human-written from machine-generated Arabic\ntext across these varied contexts. Despite their human-like qualities, we\ndemonstrate that LLMs produce detectable signatures in their Arabic outputs,\nwith domain-specific characteristics that vary significantly between different\ncontexts. Based on these insights, we developed BERT-based detection models\nthat achieved exceptional performance in formal contexts (up to 99.9\\%\nF1-score) with strong precision across model architectures. Our cross-domain\nanalysis confirms generalization challenges previously reported in the\nliterature. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the most\ncomprehensive investigation of Arabic machine-generated text to date, uniquely\ncombining multiple prompt generation methods, diverse model architectures, and\nin-depth stylometric analysis across varied textual domains, establishing a\nfoundation for developing robust, linguistically-informed detection systems\nessential for preserving information integrity in Arabic-language contexts.",

One is an ad hoc logic-based repair approach that employs an\nontology-specific check to find common words that cause false mappings. These\nwords are stored in a reserved word set and applied before the text\npreprocessing. By leveraging the power of large language models (LLMs), we also\npropose a post hoc LLM-based repair approach. This approach utilises the strong\nbackground knowledge provided by LLMs to repair non-existent and\ncounter-intuitive false mappings after the text preprocessing. It also\novercomes the tendency towards unstable true mappings by injecting the classic\ntext preprocessing pipeline via function calling.

To address this, we introduce CheckEmbed (CE): a simple, scalable,\nand accurate verification method. CE reduces each LLM answer to a single\nembedding vector using powerful modern embedding LLM models like\nSFR-Embedding-Mistral. Prior methods such as BERTScore and SelfCheckGPT relied\non weaker encoders like BERT, forcing them to operate at token or sentence\ngranularity. In contrast, CE performs fast, semantically rich comparisons\ndirectly at the whole-answer level, overcoming key limitations in both accuracy\nand scalability.

To address this, we introduce CheckEmbed (CE): a simple, scalable,\nand accurate verification method. CE reduces each LLM answer to a single\nembedding vector using powerful modern embedding LLM models like\nSFR-Embedding-Mistral. Prior methods such as BERTScore and SelfCheckGPT relied\non weaker encoders like BERT, forcing them to operate at token or sentence\ngranularity. In contrast, CE performs fast, semantically rich comparisons\ndirectly at the whole-answer level, overcoming key limitations in both accuracy\nand scalability.

However,\nwriting unit tests manually is laborious, especially for strong typed languages\nlike Java, motivating the need for automated approaches.

However, existing LLM-based methods often\nrequire LLM fine-tuning or rely on external tools such as EvoSuite for test\nprefix generation.\n  In this work, we propose CANDOR, a novel end-to-end, prompt-based LLM\nframework for automated JUnit test generation. CANDOR orchestrates multiple\nspecialized LLM agents to generate JUnit tests, including both high-quality\ntest prefixes and accurate oracles. To mitigate the notorious hallucinations in\nLLMs, we introduce a novel strategy that engages multiple reasoning LLMs in a\npanel discussion and generate accurate oracles based on consensus.\nAdditionally, to reduce the verbosity of reasoning LLMs' outputs, we propose a\nnovel dual-LLM pipeline to produce concise and structured oracle evaluations.\n  Our experiments on the HumanEvalJava and LeetCodeJava datasets show that\nCANDOR can generate accurate oracles and is slightly better than EvoSuite in\ngenerating tests with high line coverage and clearly superior in terms of\nmutation score. Moreover, CANDOR significantly outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art, prompt-based test generator LLM-Empirical, achieving\nimprovements of 15.8 to 25.1 percentage points in oracle correctness on both\ncorrect and faulty source code.

However, this approach leads to a massive number of visual\ntokens, especially for long videos. A practical solution is to first extract\nrelevant visual information from the large visual context before feeding it\ninto the LLM backbone, thereby reducing computational overhead. In this work,\nwe introduce DynTok, a novel \\textbf{Dyn}amic video \\textbf{Tok}en compression\nstrategy. DynTok adaptively splits visual tokens into groups and merges them\nwithin each group, achieving high compression in regions with low information\ndensity while preserving essential content. Our method reduces the number of\ntokens to 44.4% of the original size while maintaining comparable performance.\nIt further benefits from increasing the number of video frames and achieves\n65.3% on Video-MME and 72.5% on MLVU. By applying this simple yet effective\ncompression method, we expose the redundancy in video token representations and\noffer insights for designing more efficient video modeling techniques.",

                    "value": "Typical video modeling methods, such as LLava, represent videos as sequences\nof visual tokens, which are then processed by the LLM backbone for effective\nvideo understanding. However, this approach leads to a massive number of visual\ntokens, especially for long videos. A practical solution is to first extract\nrelevant visual information from the large visual context before feeding it\ninto the LLM backbone, thereby reducing computational overhead. In this work,\nwe introduce DynTok, a novel \\textbf{Dyn}amic video \\textbf{Tok}en compression\nstrategy. DynTok adaptively splits visual tokens into groups and merges them\nwithin each group, achieving high compression in regions with low information\ndensity while preserving essential content. Our method reduces the number of\ntokens to 44.4% of the original size while maintaining comparable performance.\nIt further benefits from increasing the number of video frames and achieves\n65.3% on Video-MME and 72.5% on MLVU. By applying this simple yet effective\ncompression method, we expose the redundancy in video token representations and\noffer insights for designing more efficient video modeling techniques."

Experimental results on the CBC benchmark demonstrate\nthat MS-YOLO achieves precise detection of overlapping cells and multi-scale\nobjects, particularly small targets such as platelets, achieving an mAP@50 of\n97.4% that outperforms existing models.

However,\nRL approaches struggle to impart new capabilities not presented in the base\nmodel, highlighting the need to integrate more knowledge like FL into NL math\nreasoning effectively. Yet, this integration is challenging due to inherent\ndisparities in problem structure and reasoning format between NL and FL. To\naddress these challenges, we introduce **NL-FL HybridReasoning**, an end-to-end\nframework designed to incorporate the FL expert into NL math problem-solving.\nTo bridge the NL and FL input format gap, we propose the *NL-FL Problem\nAlignment* method, which reformulates the Question-Answering (QA) problems in\nNL as existence theorems in FL. Subsequently, the *Mixed Problem Input*\ntechnique we provide enables the FL reasoner to handle both QA and existence\nproblems concurrently. Lastly, we mitigate the NL and FL output format gap in\nreasoning through an LLM-based *Answer Extraction* mechanism. Comprehensive\nexperiments demonstrate that the **HybridReasoning** framework achieves\n**89.80%** and **84.34%** accuracy rates on the MATH-500 and the AMC\nbenchmarks, surpassing the NL baseline by 4.60% and 4.82%, respectively.\nNotably, some problems resolved by our framework remain unsolved by the NL\nbaseline model even under a larger number of trials.",

To\naddress these challenges, we introduce **NL-FL HybridReasoning**, an end-to-end\nframework designed to incorporate the FL expert into NL math problem-solving.\nTo bridge the NL and FL input format gap, we propose the *NL-FL Problem\nAlignment* method, which reformulates the Question-Answering (QA) problems in\nNL as existence theorems in FL. Subsequently, the *Mixed Problem Input*\ntechnique we provide enables the FL reasoner to handle both QA and existence\nproblems concurrently. Lastly, we mitigate the NL and FL output format gap in\nreasoning through an LLM-based *Answer Extraction* mechanism. Comprehensive\nexperiments demonstrate that the **HybridReasoning** framework achieves\n**89.80%** and **84.34%** accuracy rates on the MATH-500 and the AMC\nbenchmarks, surpassing the NL baseline by 4.60% and 4.82%, respectively.\nNotably, some problems resolved by our framework remain unsolved by the NL\nbaseline model even under a larger number of trials."
