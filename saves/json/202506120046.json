To address this\nlimitation, we propose a new KV cache compression objective: to always ensure\nthe full-cache performance regardless of specific inputs, while maximizing KV\ncache pruning as much as possible. To achieve this goal, we introduce a novel\nKV cache compression method dubbed DBudgetKV, which features an attention-based\nmetric to signal when the remaining KV cache is unlikely to match the\nfull-cache performance, then halting the pruning process. Empirical evaluation\nspanning diverse context lengths, task types, and model sizes suggests that our\nmethod achieves lossless KV pruning effectively and robustly, exceeding 25%\ncompression ratio on average. Furthermore, our method is easy to integrate\nwithin LLM inference, not only optimizing memory space, but also showing\nreduced inference time compared to existing methods.",

We introduce Graph-KV with the\npotential to overcome this limitation.

We evaluate Graph-KV across three scenarios: (1)\nseven RAG benchmarks spanning direct inference, multi-hop reasoning, and\nlong-document understanding; (2) Arxiv-QA, a novel academic paper QA task with\nfull-text scientific papers structured as citation ego-graphs; and (3) paper\ntopic classification within a citation network.

Existing software mitigations,\nhowever, often introduce excessive overhead by indiscriminately hardening\ninstructions without assessing their vulnerability. We propose an analysis\nframework that employs a novel fixpoint algorithm to detect Spectre\nvulnerabilities and apply targeted hardening. The fixpoint algorithm accounts\nfor program behavior changes induced by stepwise hardening, enabling precise,\nsound and efficient vulnerability detection. This framework also provides\nflexibility for diverse hardening strategies and attacker models, enabling\ncustomized targeted hardening. We instantiate the framework as LightSLH, which\nhardens program with provable security.\n  We evaluate LightSLH on cryptographic algorithms from OpenSSL, Libsodium,\nNaCL and PQClean. Across all experimental cases, LightSLH provides the lowest\noverhead among current provable protection strategies, including 0\\% overhead\nin 50\\% cases. Notably, the analysis of LightSLH reveals two previously unknown\nsecurity issues: (1) The compiler can introduce risks overlooked by LLSCT, a\nhardening method proven secure at the LLVM IR level.

                    "value": "Spectre v1 attacks pose a substantial threat to security-critical software,\nparticularly cryptographic implementations. Existing software mitigations,\nhowever, often introduce excessive overhead by indiscriminately hardening\ninstructions without assessing their vulnerability. We propose an analysis\nframework that employs a novel fixpoint algorithm to detect Spectre\nvulnerabilities and apply targeted hardening. The fixpoint algorithm accounts\nfor program behavior changes induced by stepwise hardening, enabling precise,\nsound and efficient vulnerability detection. This framework also provides\nflexibility for diverse hardening strategies and attacker models, enabling\ncustomized targeted hardening. We instantiate the framework as LightSLH, which\nhardens program with provable security.\n  We evaluate LightSLH on cryptographic algorithms from OpenSSL, Libsodium,\nNaCL and PQClean. Across all experimental cases, LightSLH provides the lowest\noverhead among current provable protection strategies, including 0\\% overhead\nin 50\\% cases. Notably, the analysis of LightSLH reveals two previously unknown\nsecurity issues: (1) The compiler can introduce risks overlooked by LLSCT, a\nhardening method proven secure at the LLVM IR level. We successfully construct\na side channel by exploiting compiler-inserted stack loads, confirming this\nrisk.

We reveal that conventional\ninference scaling techniques, despite their success in reasoning tasks, perform\npoorly in safety contexts, even falling short of basic approaches like\nBest-of-N Sampling.

To overcome this dilemma, we propose SAFFRON, a novel inference\nscaling paradigm tailored explicitly for safety assurance. Central to our\napproach is the introduction of a multifurcation reward model (MRM) that\nsignificantly reduces the required number of reward model evaluations.

However, the scarcity of\nwell-annotated long videos has left the training of hour-long Video-LLMs\nunderexplored. To close this gap, we present VideoMarathon, a large-scale\nhour-long video instruction-following dataset. This dataset includes around\n9,700 hours of long videos sourced from diverse domains, ranging from 3 to 60\nminutes per video. Specifically, it contains 3.3M high-quality QA pairs,\nspanning six fundamental topics: temporality, spatiality, object, action,\nscene, and event. Compared to existing video instruction datasets,\nVideoMarathon significantly extends training video durations up to 1 hour, and\nsupports 22 diverse tasks requiring both short- and long-term video\ncomprehension. Building on VideoMarathon, we propose Hour-LLaVA, a powerful and\nefficient Video-LMM for hour-scale video-language modeling. It enables\nhour-long video training and inference at 1-FPS sampling by leveraging a memory\naugmentation module, which adaptively integrates user question-relevant and\nspatiotemporal-informative semantics from a cached full video context.

                    "value": "Recent long-form video-language understanding benchmarks have driven progress\nin video large multimodal models (Video-LMMs). However, the scarcity of\nwell-annotated long videos has left the training of hour-long Video-LLMs\nunderexplored. To close this gap, we present VideoMarathon, a large-scale\nhour-long video instruction-following dataset. This dataset includes around\n9,700 hours of long videos sourced from diverse domains, ranging from 3 to 60\nminutes per video. Specifically, it contains 3.3M high-quality QA pairs,\nspanning six fundamental topics: temporality, spatiality, object, action,\nscene, and event. Compared to existing video instruction datasets,\nVideoMarathon significantly extends training video durations up to 1 hour, and\nsupports 22 diverse tasks requiring both short- and long-term video\ncomprehension. Building on VideoMarathon, we propose Hour-LLaVA, a powerful and\nefficient Video-LMM for hour-scale video-language modeling. It enables\nhour-long video training and inference at 1-FPS sampling by leveraging a memory\naugmentation module, which adaptively integrates user question-relevant and\nspatiotemporal-informative semantics from a cached full video context. In our\nexperiments, Hour-LLaVA achieves the best performance on multiple long\nvideo-language benchmarks, demonstrating the high quality of the VideoMarathon\ndataset and the superiority of the Hour-LLaVA model."

Furthermore, we empirically show\nthat the compression limits are determined not by the length of the input but\nby the amount of uncertainty to be reduced, namely, the cross-entropy loss on\nthis sequence without any conditioning.

Recently, In-context\nConditioning emerged as a powerful paradigm for unified conditional video\ngeneration, which enables diverse controls by concatenating varying context\nconditioning signals with noisy video latents into a long unified token\nsequence and jointly processing them via full-attention, e.g., FullDiT. Despite\ntheir effectiveness, these methods face quadratic computation overhead as task\ncomplexity increases, hindering practical deployment. In this paper, we study\nthe efficiency bottleneck neglected in original in-context conditioning video\ngeneration framework. We begin with systematic analysis to identify two key\nsources of the computation inefficiencies: the inherent redundancy within\ncontext condition tokens and the computational redundancy in context-latent\ninteractions throughout the diffusion process. Based on these insights, we\npropose FullDiT2, an efficient in-context conditioning framework for general\ncontrollability in both video generation and editing tasks, which innovates\nfrom two key perspectives. Firstly, to address the token redundancy, FullDiT2\nleverages a dynamic token selection mechanism to adaptively identify important\ncontext tokens, reducing the sequence length for unified full-attention.\nAdditionally, a selective context caching mechanism is devised to minimize\nredundant interactions between condition tokens and video latents. Extensive\nexperiments on six diverse conditional video editing and generation tasks\ndemonstrate that FullDiT2 achieves significant computation reduction and 2-3\ntimes speedup in averaged time cost per diffusion step, with minimal\ndegradation or even higher performance in video generation quality.

To\nreduce the cost of auto-regressive decoding, Key-Value (KV) cache is used to\nstore intermediate activations, which significantly lowers the computational\noverhead for token generation. However, the memory required for the KV cache\ngrows rapidly, often exceeding the capacity of GPU memory. A cost-effective\nalternative is to offload KV cache to CPU memory, which alleviates GPU memory\npressure, but shifts the bottleneck to the limited bandwidth of the PCIe\nconnection between the CPU and GPU. Existing methods attempt to address these\nissues by overlapping GPU computation with I/O or employing CPU-GPU\nheterogeneous execution, but they are hindered by excessive data movement and\ndependence on CPU capabilities. Fully overlapping PCIe communication latency\ngets challenging as the size of the KV cache grows and/or the GPU compute\ncapabilities increase. In this paper, we introduce KVPR, an efficient I/O-aware\nLLM inference method where the CPU first transfers a partial set of\nactivations, from which the GPU can start recomputing the KV cache values.\nWhile the GPU recomputes the partial KV cache, the remaining portion of the KV\ncache is transferred concurrently from the CPU. This approach overlaps GPU\nrecomputation with KV cache transfer to minimize idle GPU time and maximize\ninference performance. KVPR is fully automated by integrating a profiler module\nthat utilizes input characteristics and system hardware information, a\nscheduler module to optimize the distribution of computation and communication\nworkloads, and a runtime module to efficiently execute the derived execution\nplan. Experimental results show that KVPR achieves up to 35.8% lower latency\nand 46.2% higher throughput during decoding compared to state-of-the-art\napproaches.

A common observation is that DiT latent noise vectors change slowly\nacross inference steps, which suggests that the DiT compute may be redundant\nacross steps. In this paper, we aim to speed up inference by reducing this\nredundancy, without additional training. We first study how activations change\nbetween steps in two state-of-the-art open-source DiTs. We find that just 5-25%\nof the values in attention and MLP explain 70-90% of the change in activations\nacross steps. This finding motivates our approach, Chipmunk, which uses dynamic\nsparsity at inference time to recompute only the fastest-changing intermediate\nactivations, while caching the rest. Dynamic sparsity introduces two systems\nchallenges: (1) sparse attention and MLP operations tend to underutilize GPU\ntensor cores; and (2) computing dynamic sparsity patterns at runtime and\ncaching activations both introduce overhead. To address these challenges,\nChipmunk first uses a voxel-based reordering of input tokens to introduce\ncolumn-wise sparsity. We implement column-sparse kernels utilizing efficient\nsparse gathers from global to shared GPU memory, achieving a 9.3x speedup at\n93% sparsity compared to highly-optimized dense baselines. Second, Chipmunk\noverlaps the computation of sparsity patterns and cache updates with other\nparts of the computation (e.g., second layer of the MLP) to hide the extra\nlatency. Chipmunk achieves up to 2.16x speedup on HunyuanVideo and 1.41x on\nFLUX.1-dev without compromising generation quality. Furthermore, we show that\nChipmunk can be stacked on top of full step caching, achieving a 3.72x speedup\non HunyuanVideo, a 2.67x speedup on WAN2.1, and a 2.25x speedup on FLUX.1-dev\nwith minimal quality impact.",

In this work, we propose METok, a\ntraining-free, Multi-stage Event-based Token compression framework designed to\naccelerate VLLMs' inference while preserving accuracy.

Our experiments on diverse video benchmarks demonstrate that METok\nachieves an optimal trade-off between efficiency and accuracy by dynamically\nselecting informative visual tokens.

Under these requirements, the monolithic active pixel sensor\n(MAPS) is considered as a promising candidate for the ITK. To minimize the\npower consumption of MAPS (for low material budget), larger-size sensors are\nproposed to reduce the scale of the readout circuitry while preserving the\nrequired position resolution. Multiple sensors with varying dimensions and\nstructures were designed and integrated in several prototype chips for\nperformance comparison, fabricated in a 180~nm CIS process. The in-pixel\nreadout circuit can also provide time of arrival (ToA) and time-over-threshold\n(ToT) of the hit signal, with a least significant bit (LSB) of 50 ns. The\nperipheral readout circuit performs operations including timestamp correction,\ndata aggregation, caching, framing, 8b/10b encoding, and serialization.\nAccording to simulation, the power consumption for a full-scale chip is about\n55.7 mW/cm2.

Under these requirements, the monolithic active pixel sensor\n(MAPS) is considered as a promising candidate for the ITK. To minimize the\npower consumption of MAPS (for low material budget), larger-size sensors are\nproposed to reduce the scale of the readout circuitry while preserving the\nrequired position resolution. Multiple sensors with varying dimensions and\nstructures were designed and integrated in several prototype chips for\nperformance comparison, fabricated in a 180~nm CIS process. The in-pixel\nreadout circuit can also provide time of arrival (ToA) and time-over-threshold\n(ToT) of the hit signal, with a least significant bit (LSB) of 50 ns. The\nperipheral readout circuit performs operations including timestamp correction,\ndata aggregation, caching, framing, 8b/10b encoding, and serialization.\nAccording to simulation, the power consumption for a full-scale chip is about\n55.7 mW/cm2. Preliminary measurements have been conducted on the prototype\nchips."

Constrained decoding with context-free grammar is a flexible\napproach to guarantee LLMs' adherence to a specific format by dynamically\nbuilding a token logits mask. However, creating this mask requires checking the\nvalidity of all tokens in the LLM vocabulary at every decoding step, which\noften incurs significant overheads in existing constrained decoding engines. To\naddress this challenge, we propose $\\textbf{ZapFormat}$, a novel\n$\\textbf{dynamic pruning}$ strategy based on the Earley algorithm that\nidentifies and eliminates invalid or redundant Earley states in real-time,\nsignificantly reducing memory occupation of the Earley algorithm's states. This\nfurther enables us to use a state cache to speed up structured generations on a\nlarge number of queries. We implemented ZapFormat in a new constrained decoding\nengine called Formatron which also incorporates existing optimizations. Through\ncomprehensive experiments on structured generation tasks, including JSON\ngeneration, JSON Schema validation, and semantic parsing, we demonstrate that\nFormatron not only $\\textbf{consistently maintains}$ high-precision compliant\noutputs but also achieves $\\textbf{significant improvements}$ in inference\nspeed up to 2x compared to state-of-the-art implementations.

Low-rank\napproximation offers a promising compression solution, yet existing approaches\nhave two main limitations: (1) They focus on minimizing the output error of\nindividual linear layers, without considering the architectural characteristics\nof Transformers, and (2) they decompose a large weight matrix into two small\nlow-rank matrices.

To address these challenges, we propose QuickVideo, a\nsystem-algorithm co-design that substantially accelerates long-video\nunderstanding to support real-time downstream applications.

Therefore, we theoretically analyze the\ninherent correlation of layer-wise transformer attention patterns to KV cache\nquantization errors and study why key cache is generally more important than\nvalue cache for quantization error reduction.

We\nimplement the approach and evaluate it in 10 open-source Rust crates.\nExperimental results show that within just two or three hours, PALM can\nsignificantly improves test coverage compared to classic methods, with\nincreases in overall project coverage exceeding 50% in some instances and its\ngenerated tests achieving an average coverage of 75.77%, comparable to human\neffort (71.30%), highlighting the potential of LLMs in automated test\ngeneration. We submitted 91 PALM-generated unit tests targeting new code. Of\nthese submissions, 80 were accepted, 5 were rejected, and 6 remain pending\nreview. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating program\nanalysis with AI and open new avenues for future research in automated software\ntesting."

Evaluation on the HumanEval and MBPP benchmarks reveals that AdaDec\nachieves up to a 15.5% improvement in Pass@1 accuracy compared to greedy\ndecoding, matches or outperforms traditional beam search, and reduces both\ncomputational overhead and latency through targeted, selective pausing.

AdaDec\ndynamically learns uncertainty thresholds tailored to each model and employs a\npause-then-rerank mechanism with lookahead when the uncertainty surpasses these\nthresholds. Evaluation on the HumanEval and MBPP benchmarks reveals that AdaDec\nachieves up to a 15.5% improvement in Pass@1 accuracy compared to greedy\ndecoding, matches or outperforms traditional beam search, and reduces both\ncomputational overhead and latency through targeted, selective pausing. Our\nfindings suggest that uncertainty-aware adaptive decoding holds considerable\npotential for enhancing both the reliability and efficiency of code generation\nwith LLMs."

For dealing with the implicitness introduced\nin the diffusion term, we provide a framework to derive the asymptotic error\ndistribution of diffusion-implicit or fully implicit numerical methods, which\nenables us to construct a fully explicit numerical method sharing the same\nasymptotic error distribution as the SRK method. Further, we show for the\nmultiplicative noise that the limit distribution $U(T)$ satisfies $\\mathbf\nE|U(T)|^2\\le e^{L_1T}(1+\\eta_1)T^3$ for some $\\eta_1$ only depending on the\ncoefficients of the SRK method. Thus, we infer that $\\eta_1$ is the key\nparameter reflecting the growth rate of the mean-square error of the SRK\nmethod. Especially, among the SRK methods of strong order $1$, those of weak\norder $2$ ($\\eta_1=0$) share the unified asymptotic error distribution and have\nthe smallest mean-square errors after a long time. This property is also found\nfor the case of additive noise. It seems that we are the first to give the\nasymptotic error distribution of fully implicit numerical methods for SDEs.",

For dealing with the implicitness introduced\nin the diffusion term, we provide a framework to derive the asymptotic error\ndistribution of diffusion-implicit or fully implicit numerical methods, which\nenables us to construct a fully explicit numerical method sharing the same\nasymptotic error distribution as the SRK method. Further, we show for the\nmultiplicative noise that the limit distribution $U(T)$ satisfies $\\mathbf\nE|U(T)|^2\\le e^{L_1T}(1+\\eta_1)T^3$ for some $\\eta_1$ only depending on the\ncoefficients of the SRK method. Thus, we infer that $\\eta_1$ is the key\nparameter reflecting the growth rate of the mean-square error of the SRK\nmethod. Especially, among the SRK methods of strong order $1$, those of weak\norder $2$ ($\\eta_1=0$) share the unified asymptotic error distribution and have\nthe smallest mean-square errors after a long time. This property is also found\nfor the case of additive noise. It seems that we are the first to give the\nasymptotic error distribution of fully implicit numerical methods for SDEs."

These operate over layerwise pooled\nembeddings guided by a learned attention profile, reshaping internal geometry\nwithout modifying the base model, and achieve up to 39% ASR reduction.\nMoreover, we introduce AVQI, a geometry aware metric that quantifies latent\nalignment failure via cluster separation and compactness.

To mitigate\nthis vulnerability, we introduce GRACE - Geometric Representation Aware\nContrastive Enhancement, an alignment framework coupling preference learning\nwith latent space regularization. GRACE enforces two constraints: latent\nseparation between safe and adversarial completions, and adversarial cohesion\namong unsafe and jailbreak behaviors. These operate over layerwise pooled\nembeddings guided by a learned attention profile, reshaping internal geometry\nwithout modifying the base model, and achieve up to 39% ASR reduction.\nMoreover, we introduce AVQI, a geometry aware metric that quantifies latent\nalignment failure via cluster separation and compactness. AVQI reveals when\nunsafe completions mimic the geometry of safe ones, offering a principled lens\ninto how models internally encode safety. We make the code publicly available\nat https://anonymous.4open.science/r/alkali-B416/README.md."

Across groups, NERs,\nn-gram patterns, and topic ontology showed within-group homogeneity. EEG\nrevealed significant differences in brain connectivity: Brain-only participants\nexhibited the strongest, most distributed networks; Search Engine users showed\nmoderate engagement; and LLM users displayed the weakest connectivity.\nCognitive activity scaled down in relation to external tool use. In session 4,\nLLM-to-Brain participants showed reduced alpha and beta connectivity,\nindicating under-engagement. Brain-to-LLM users exhibited higher memory recall\nand activation of occipito-parietal and prefrontal areas, similar to Search\nEngine users. Self-reported ownership of essays was the lowest in the LLM group\nand the highest in the Brain-only group. LLM users also struggled to accurately\nquote their own work. While LLMs offer immediate convenience, our findings\nhighlight potential cognitive costs. Over four months, LLM users consistently\nunderperformed at neural, linguistic, and behavioral levels.

Extracting entities such as\npercentages of physical and/or psychological disability and the involved\ncompensation amounts is a challenging process, even for experts, due to the\nsubtle arguments and reasoning in the court decision. A two-step procedure is\nproposed: first, segmenting the document identifying the most relevant\nsegments, and then extracting the entities. For text segmentation, two\nmethodologies are compared: a classic method based on regular expressions and a\nsecond approach that divides the document into blocks of n-tokens, which are\nthen vectorized using multilingual models for semantic searches\n(text-embedding-ada-002/MiniLM-L12-v2 ). Subsequently, large language models\n(LLaMA-2 7b, 70b, LLaMA-3 8b, and GPT-4 Turbo) are applied with prompting to\nthe selected segments for entity extraction. For the LLaMA models, fine-tuning\nis performed using LoRA. LLaMA-2 7b, even with zero temperature, shows a\nsignificant number of hallucinations in extractions which are an important\ncontention point for named entity extraction. This work shows that these\nhallucinations are substantially reduced after finetuning the model. The\nperformance of the methodology based on segment vectorization and subsequent\nuse of LLMs significantly surpasses the classic method which achieves an\naccuracy of 39.5%. Among open-source models, LLaMA-2 70B with finetuning\nachieves the highest accuracy 79.4%, surpassing its base version 61.7%.\nNotably, the base LLaMA-3 8B model already performs comparably to the finetuned\nLLaMA-2 70B model, achieving 76.6%, highlighting the rapid progress in model\ndevelopment. Meanwhile, GPT-4 Turbo achieves the highest accuracy at 86.1%.",

                    "value": "The extraction of information about traffic accidents from legal documents is\ncrucial for quantifying insurance company costs. Extracting entities such as\npercentages of physical and/or psychological disability and the involved\ncompensation amounts is a challenging process, even for experts, due to the\nsubtle arguments and reasoning in the court decision. A two-step procedure is\nproposed: first, segmenting the document identifying the most relevant\nsegments, and then extracting the entities. For text segmentation, two\nmethodologies are compared: a classic method based on regular expressions and a\nsecond approach that divides the document into blocks of n-tokens, which are\nthen vectorized using multilingual models for semantic searches\n(text-embedding-ada-002/MiniLM-L12-v2 ). Subsequently, large language models\n(LLaMA-2 7b, 70b, LLaMA-3 8b, and GPT-4 Turbo) are applied with prompting to\nthe selected segments for entity extraction. For the LLaMA models, fine-tuning\nis performed using LoRA. LLaMA-2 7b, even with zero temperature, shows a\nsignificant number of hallucinations in extractions which are an important\ncontention point for named entity extraction. This work shows that these\nhallucinations are substantially reduced after finetuning the model. The\nperformance of the methodology based on segment vectorization and subsequent\nuse of LLMs significantly surpasses the classic method which achieves an\naccuracy of 39.5%. Among open-source models, LLaMA-2 70B with finetuning\nachieves the highest accuracy 79.4%, surpassing its base version 61.7%.\nNotably, the base LLaMA-3 8B model already performs comparably to the finetuned\nLLaMA-2 70B model, achieving 76.6%, highlighting the rapid progress in model\ndevelopment. Meanwhile, GPT-4 Turbo achieves the highest accuracy at 86.1%."

Despite the growing need for automated equivalence checks --\ndriven, for example, by optimization copilots, which generate problem\nformulations from natural language descriptions -- current approaches rely on\nsimple heuristics that fail to reliably check formulation equivalence. Inspired\nby Karp reductions, in this work we introduce Quasi-Karp equivalence, a formal\ncriterion for determining when two optimization formulations are equivalent\nbased on the existence of a mapping between their decision variables. We\npropose EquivaMap, a framework that leverages large language models to\nautomatically discover such mappings for scalable, reliable equivalence\nchecking, with a verification stage that ensures mapped solutions preserve\nfeasibility and optimality without additional solver calls. To evaluate our\napproach, we construct EquivaFormulation, the first open-source dataset of\nequivalent optimization formulations, generated by applying transformations\nsuch as adding slack variables or valid inequalities to existing formulations.\nEmpirically, EquivaMap significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving\nsubstantial improvements in correctly identifying formulation equivalence.",

                    "value": "A fundamental problem in combinatorial optimization is identifying equivalent\nformulations. Despite the growing need for automated equivalence checks --\ndriven, for example, by optimization copilots, which generate problem\nformulations from natural language descriptions -- current approaches rely on\nsimple heuristics that fail to reliably check formulation equivalence. Inspired\nby Karp reductions, in this work we introduce Quasi-Karp equivalence, a formal\ncriterion for determining when two optimization formulations are equivalent\nbased on the existence of a mapping between their decision variables. We\npropose EquivaMap, a framework that leverages large language models to\nautomatically discover such mappings for scalable, reliable equivalence\nchecking, with a verification stage that ensures mapped solutions preserve\nfeasibility and optimality without additional solver calls. To evaluate our\napproach, we construct EquivaFormulation, the first open-source dataset of\nequivalent optimization formulations, generated by applying transformations\nsuch as adding slack variables or valid inequalities to existing formulations.\nEmpirically, EquivaMap significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving\nsubstantial improvements in correctly identifying formulation equivalence."

                "summary": "Recent advancements underscore the significant role of Reinforcement Learning\n(RL) in enhancing the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities of large\nlanguage models (LLMs). Two prominent RL algorithms, Direct Preference\nOptimization (DPO) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), are central\nto these developments, showcasing different pros and cons. Autoregressive image\ngeneration, also interpretable as a sequential CoT reasoning process, presents\nunique challenges distinct from LLM-based CoT reasoning. These encompass\nensuring text-image consistency, improving image aesthetic quality, and\ndesigning sophisticated reward models, rather than relying on simpler\nrule-based rewards. While recent efforts have extended RL to this domain, these\nexplorations typically lack an in-depth analysis of the domain-specific\nchallenges and the characteristics of different RL strategies. To bridge this\ngap, we provide the first comprehensive investigation of the GRPO and DPO\nalgorithms in autoregressive image generation, evaluating their in-domain\nperformance and out-of-domain generalization, while scrutinizing the impact of\ndifferent reward models on their respective capabilities. Our findings reveal\nthat GRPO and DPO exhibit distinct advantages, and crucially, that reward\nmodels possessing stronger intrinsic generalization capabilities potentially\nenhance the generalization potential of the applied RL algorithms. Furthermore,\nwe systematically explore three prevalent scaling strategies to enhance both\ntheir in-domain and out-of-domain proficiency, deriving unique insights into\nefficiently scaling performance for each paradigm. We hope our study paves a\nnew path for inspiring future work on developing more effective RL algorithms\nto achieve robust CoT reasoning in the realm of autoregressive image\ngeneration.

                    "value": "Recent advancements underscore the significant role of Reinforcement Learning\n(RL) in enhancing the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities of large\nlanguage models (LLMs). Two prominent RL algorithms, Direct Preference\nOptimization (DPO) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), are central\nto these developments, showcasing different pros and cons. Autoregressive image\ngeneration, also interpretable as a sequential CoT reasoning process, presents\nunique challenges distinct from LLM-based CoT reasoning. These encompass\nensuring text-image consistency, improving image aesthetic quality, and\ndesigning sophisticated reward models, rather than relying on simpler\nrule-based rewards. While recent efforts have extended RL to this domain, these\nexplorations typically lack an in-depth analysis of the domain-specific\nchallenges and the characteristics of different RL strategies. To bridge this\ngap, we provide the first comprehensive investigation of the GRPO and DPO\nalgorithms in autoregressive image generation, evaluating their in-domain\nperformance and out-of-domain generalization, while scrutinizing the impact of\ndifferent reward models on their respective capabilities. Our findings reveal\nthat GRPO and DPO exhibit distinct advantages, and crucially, that reward\nmodels possessing stronger intrinsic generalization capabilities potentially\nenhance the generalization potential of the applied RL algorithms. Furthermore,\nwe systematically explore three prevalent scaling strategies to enhance both\ntheir in-domain and out-of-domain proficiency, deriving unique insights into\nefficiently scaling performance for each paradigm. We hope our study paves a\nnew path for inspiring future work on developing more effective RL algorithms\nto achieve robust CoT reasoning in the realm of autoregressive image\ngeneration.

Furthermore, we demonstrate\neffectiveness of LT-PINNs on more complex time-dependent and time-independent\nflow problems without relying on measurement data, and showcase their\nengineering application potential in flow velocity rearrangement, transforming\na uniform upstream velocity into a sine-shaped downstream profile.

However, the scarcity of challenging\nfinancial datasets, particularly for Japanese financial data, impedes academic\ninnovation in financial analytics. As LLMs advance, this lack of accessible\nresearch resources increasingly hinders their development and evaluation in\nthis specialized domain. To address this gap, we introduce EDINET-Bench, an\nopen-source Japanese financial benchmark designed to evaluate the performance\nof LLMs on challenging financial tasks including accounting fraud detection,\nearnings forecasting, and industry prediction. EDINET-Bench is constructed by\ndownloading annual reports from the past 10 years from Japan's Electronic\nDisclosure for Investors' NETwork (EDINET) and automatically assigning labels\ncorresponding to each evaluation task. Our experiments reveal that even\nstate-of-the-art LLMs struggle, performing only slightly better than logistic\nregression in binary classification for fraud detection and earnings\nforecasting. These results highlight significant challenges in applying LLMs to\nreal-world financial applications and underscore the need for domain-specific\nadaptation. Our dataset, benchmark construction code, and evaluation code is\npublicly available to facilitate future research in finance with LLMs.",

                    "value": "Financial analysis presents complex challenges that could leverage large\nlanguage model (LLM) capabilities. However, the scarcity of challenging\nfinancial datasets, particularly for Japanese financial data, impedes academic\ninnovation in financial analytics. As LLMs advance, this lack of accessible\nresearch resources increasingly hinders their development and evaluation in\nthis specialized domain. To address this gap, we introduce EDINET-Bench, an\nopen-source Japanese financial benchmark designed to evaluate the performance\nof LLMs on challenging financial tasks including accounting fraud detection,\nearnings forecasting, and industry prediction. EDINET-Bench is constructed by\ndownloading annual reports from the past 10 years from Japan's Electronic\nDisclosure for Investors' NETwork (EDINET) and automatically assigning labels\ncorresponding to each evaluation task. Our experiments reveal that even\nstate-of-the-art LLMs struggle, performing only slightly better than logistic\nregression in binary classification for fraud detection and earnings\nforecasting. These results highlight significant challenges in applying LLMs to\nreal-world financial applications and underscore the need for domain-specific\nadaptation. Our dataset, benchmark construction code, and evaluation code is\npublicly available to facilitate future research in finance with LLMs."

It is crucial to\nunderstand the design and operation of GenAI browser extensions, including how\nthey collect, store, process, and share user data. To this end, we study their\nability to profile users and personalize their responses based on explicit or\ninferred demographic attributes and interests of users. We perform network\ntraffic analysis and use a novel prompting framework to audit tracking,\nprofiling, and personalization by the ten most popular GenAI browser assistant\nextensions. We find that instead of relying on local in-browser models, these\nassistants largely depend on server-side APIs, which can be auto-invoked\nwithout explicit user interaction. When invoked, they collect and share webpage\ncontent, often the full HTML DOM and sometimes even the user's form inputs,\nwith their first-party servers. Some assistants also share identifiers and user\nprompts with third-party trackers such as Google Analytics. The collection and\nsharing continues even if a webpage contains sensitive information such as\nhealth or personal information such as name or SSN entered in a web form. We\nfind that several GenAI browser assistants infer demographic attributes such as\nage, gender, income, and interests and use this profile--which carries across\nbrowsing contexts--to personalize responses. In summary, our work shows that\nGenAI browser assistants can and do collect personal and sensitive information\nfor profiling and personalization with little to no safeguards.",

To this end, we study their\nability to profile users and personalize their responses based on explicit or\ninferred demographic attributes and interests of users. We perform network\ntraffic analysis and use a novel prompting framework to audit tracking,\nprofiling, and personalization by the ten most popular GenAI browser assistant\nextensions. We find that instead of relying on local in-browser models, these\nassistants largely depend on server-side APIs, which can be auto-invoked\nwithout explicit user interaction. When invoked, they collect and share webpage\ncontent, often the full HTML DOM and sometimes even the user's form inputs,\nwith their first-party servers. Some assistants also share identifiers and user\nprompts with third-party trackers such as Google Analytics. The collection and\nsharing continues even if a webpage contains sensitive information such as\nhealth or personal information such as name or SSN entered in a web form. We\nfind that several GenAI browser assistants infer demographic attributes such as\nage, gender, income, and interests and use this profile--which carries across\nbrowsing contexts--to personalize responses. In summary, our work shows that\nGenAI browser assistants can and do collect personal and sensitive information\nfor profiling and personalization with little to no safeguards."

This results in three key limitations: (1) an\ninability to utilize images without accompanying captions, (2) the risk that\ncaptions omit critical visual details, and (3) the challenge that certain\nvision-centric content cannot be adequately conveyed through text. As a result,\ncurrent LVLMs often prioritize vision-to-language alignment while potentially\noverlooking fine-grained visual information. While some prior works have\nexplored autoregressive image generation, effectively leveraging autoregressive\nvisual supervision to enhance image understanding remains an open challenge. In\nthis paper, we introduce Autoregressive Semantic Visual Reconstruction (ASVR),\nwhich enables joint learning of visual and textual modalities within a unified\nautoregressive framework. We show that autoregressively reconstructing the raw\nvisual appearance of images does not enhance and may even impair multimodal\nunderstanding. In contrast, autoregressively reconstructing the semantic\nrepresentation of images consistently improves comprehension. Notably, we find\nthat even when models are given continuous image features as input, they can\neffectively reconstruct discrete semantic tokens, resulting in stable and\nconsistent improvements across a wide range of multimodal understanding\nbenchmarks. Our approach delivers significant performance gains across varying\ndata scales (556k-2M) and types of LLM bacbones. Specifically, ASVR improves\nLLaVA-1.5 by 5% in average scores across 14 multimodal benchmarks. The code is\navailable at https://github.com/AlenjandroWang/ASVR.",

We present a novel approach to learn their full joint\ndistribution using Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) trained on\npaired CIB-tSZ patches at 150 GHz, from the Agora suite of extragalactic sky\nsimulations. While simulations like Agora, which are based on N-body\ncalculations, can take thousands of CPU hours, DDPM can synthesize realistic\nCIB-tSZ patches that faithfully reproduce both auto- and cross-spectral\nstatistics of the 2-point, 3-point, and 4-point correlation functions, in a\nmatter of seconds. We further demonstrate matching pixel-value histograms and\nMinkowski functionals, confirming that conventional non-Gaussian benchmarks are\nalso satisfied. This framework provides a powerful generative tool for\nforward-modeling correlated extragalactic foregrounds in current and future CMB\nanalyses. Although we mainly demonstrate the joint modeling of tSZ and CIB at a\nsingle frequency, we also include examples of its extension to multiple\nfrequencies, showing that the framework can learn the spectral energy\ndistributions (SEDs) across different bands. While establishing DDPMs as a\npromising tool for addressing foreground contamination in next-generation CMB\nsurveys, we also outline remaining challenges to their practical deployment in\nanalysis pipelines, such as scaling to larger sky areas and reliance on the\nunderlying cosmological and astrophysical assumptions in the simulations used\nfor training.",

                "summary": "The rapid emergence of diverse large language models (LLMs) has spurred the\ndevelopment of LLM routers that assign user queries to the most suitable model.\nHowever, existing LLM routers typically perform a single-round, one-to-one\nmapping (\\textit{i.e.}, assigning each query to a single model in isolation),\nwhich limits their capability to tackle complex tasks that demand the\ncomplementary strengths of multiple LLMs. In this paper, we present\n\\textbf{Router-R1}, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework that\nformulates multi-LLM routing and aggregation as a sequential decision process.\nRouter-R1 instantiates the router itself as a capable LLM, leveraging its\nreasoning ability to interleave \"think\" actions (internal deliberation) with\n\"route\" actions (dynamic model invocation), and integrates each response into\nits evolving context. To guide learning, we employ a lightweight rule-based\nreward comprising format rewards, final outcome rewards, and a novel cost\nreward for performance and cost trade-off optimization, opening a pathway\ntoward optimizing performance-cost tradeoffs via RL. Router-R1 also conditions\nonly on simple model descriptors such as pricing, latency, and example\nperformance, enabling strong generalization to unseen model selection.\nExperiments on seven general and multi-hop QA benchmarks show that Router-R1\noutperforms over several strong baselines, achieving superior performance while\nmaintaining robust generalization and cost management.Code is available at\nhttps://github.com/ulab-uiuc/Router-R1.",

                    "value": "The rapid emergence of diverse large language models (LLMs) has spurred the\ndevelopment of LLM routers that assign user queries to the most suitable model.\nHowever, existing LLM routers typically perform a single-round, one-to-one\nmapping (\\textit{i.e.}, assigning each query to a single model in isolation),\nwhich limits their capability to tackle complex tasks that demand the\ncomplementary strengths of multiple LLMs. In this paper, we present\n\\textbf{Router-R1}, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework that\nformulates multi-LLM routing and aggregation as a sequential decision process.\nRouter-R1 instantiates the router itself as a capable LLM, leveraging its\nreasoning ability to interleave \"think\" actions (internal deliberation) with\n\"route\" actions (dynamic model invocation), and integrates each response into\nits evolving context. To guide learning, we employ a lightweight rule-based\nreward comprising format rewards, final outcome rewards, and a novel cost\nreward for performance and cost trade-off optimization, opening a pathway\ntoward optimizing performance-cost tradeoffs via RL. Router-R1 also conditions\nonly on simple model descriptors such as pricing, latency, and example\nperformance, enabling strong generalization to unseen model selection.\nExperiments on seven general and multi-hop QA benchmarks show that Router-R1\noutperforms over several strong baselines, achieving superior performance while\nmaintaining robust generalization and cost management.Code is available at\nhttps://github.com/ulab-uiuc/Router-R1."

Findings show that both human and\nLLM proofreading enhance bigram lexical features, which may contribute to\nbetter coherence and contextual connectedness between adjacent words. However,\nLLM proofreading exhibits a more generative approach, extensively reworking\nvocabulary and sentence structures, such as employing more diverse and\nsophisticated vocabulary and incorporating a greater number of adjective\nmodifiers in noun phrases.

Findings show that both human and\nLLM proofreading enhance bigram lexical features, which may contribute to\nbetter coherence and contextual connectedness between adjacent words. However,\nLLM proofreading exhibits a more generative approach, extensively reworking\nvocabulary and sentence structures, such as employing more diverse and\nsophisticated vocabulary and incorporating a greater number of adjective\nmodifiers in noun phrases. The proofreading outcomes are highly consistent in\nmajor lexical and syntactic features across the three models."

High definition (HD) maps offer a promising solution, but\ntheir high maintenance cost poses a significant barrier to scalable deployment.\nThis challenge is addressed by online HD map construction methods, which\ngenerate local HD maps from live sensor data. However, these methods are\ninherently limited by the short perception range of onboard sensors. To\novercome this limitation and improve general performance, recent approaches\nhave explored the use of standard definition (SD) maps as prior, which are\nsignificantly easier to maintain. We propose SDTagNet, the first online HD map\nconstruction method that fully utilizes the information of widely available SD\nmaps, like OpenStreetMap, to enhance far range detection accuracy. Our approach\nintroduces two key innovations. First, in contrast to previous work, we\nincorporate not only polyline SD map data with manually selected classes, but\nadditional semantic information in the form of textual annotations. In this\nway, we enrich SD vector map tokens with NLP-derived features, eliminating the\ndependency on predefined specifications or exhaustive class taxonomies. Second,\nwe introduce a point-level SD map encoder together with orthogonal element\nidentifiers to uniformly integrate all types of map elements. Experiments on\nArgoverse 2 and nuScenes show that this boosts map perception performance by up\nto +5.9 mAP (+45%) w.r.t. map construction without priors and up to +3.2 mAP\n(+20%) w.r.t. previous approaches that already use SD map priors.

To\novercome this, quantizing SSMs with low bit-width data formats can reduce model\nsize and benefit from hardware acceleration. As SSMs are prone to\nquantization-induced errors, recent efforts have focused on optimizing a\nparticular model or bit-width for efficiency without sacrificing performance.\nHowever, distinct bit-width configurations are essential for different\nscenarios, like W4A8 for boosting large-batch decoding speed, and W4A16 for\nenhancing generation speed in short prompt applications for a single user. To\nthis end, we present Quamba2, compatible with W8A8, W4A8, and W4A16 for both\nMamba1 and Mamba2 backbones, addressing the growing demand for SSM deployment\non various platforms. Based on the channel order preserving and activation\npersistence of SSMs, we propose an offline approach to quantize inputs of a\nlinear recurrence in 8-bit by sorting and clustering for input $x$, combined\nwith a per-state-group quantization for input-dependent parameters $B$ and $C$.\nTo ensure compute-invariance in the SSM output, we rearrange weights offline\naccording to the clustering sequence.

In this work, we conduct an empirical\nanalysis demonstrating that a significant portion of generation errors arises\nfrom incorrect token ranking at high-uncertainty steps, where the ground truth\ntoken exists in the candidate set but fails to be ranked first.\n  Inspired by this insight, we introduce AdaDec, an adaptive decoding framework\nguided by token-level uncertainty quantified via Shannon entropy.

While these efforts advance AI in mental health, achieving\nmore realistic seeker simulation remains hindered by two key challenges:\ndynamic evolution and multi-session memory. Seekers' mental states often\nfluctuate during counseling, which typically spans multiple sessions. To\naddress this, we propose AnnaAgent, an emotional and cognitive dynamic agent\nsystem equipped with tertiary memory. AnnaAgent incorporates an emotion\nmodulator and a complaint elicitor trained on real counseling dialogues,\nenabling dynamic control of the simulator's configurations. Additionally, its\ntertiary memory mechanism effectively integrates short-term and long-term\nmemory across sessions. Evaluation results, both automated and manual,\ndemonstrate that AnnaAgent achieves more realistic seeker simulation in\npsychological counseling compared to existing baselines. The ethically reviewed\nand screened code can be found on https://github.com/sci-m-wang/AnnaAgent.",

                    "value": "Constrained by the cost and ethical concerns of involving real seekers in\nAI-driven mental health, researchers develop LLM-based conversational agents\n(CAs) with tailored configurations, such as profiles, symptoms, and scenarios,\nto simulate seekers. While these efforts advance AI in mental health, achieving\nmore realistic seeker simulation remains hindered by two key challenges:\ndynamic evolution and multi-session memory. Seekers' mental states often\nfluctuate during counseling, which typically spans multiple sessions. To\naddress this, we propose AnnaAgent, an emotional and cognitive dynamic agent\nsystem equipped with tertiary memory. AnnaAgent incorporates an emotion\nmodulator and a complaint elicitor trained on real counseling dialogues,\nenabling dynamic control of the simulator's configurations. Additionally, its\ntertiary memory mechanism effectively integrates short-term and long-term\nmemory across sessions. Evaluation results, both automated and manual,\ndemonstrate that AnnaAgent achieves more realistic seeker simulation in\npsychological counseling compared to existing baselines. The ethically reviewed\nand screened code can be found on https://github.com/sci-m-wang/AnnaAgent."

Our results challenge the paradigm that state-of-the-art\nmathematical reasoning necessitates massive infrastructure, democratizing\naccess to high-performance AI research.\nhttps://github.com/shinandrew/YouronMath."

Participants were divided into three groups: LLM, Search Engine,\nand Brain-only (no tools). Each completed three sessions under the same\ncondition. In a fourth session, LLM users were reassigned to Brain-only group\n(LLM-to-Brain), and Brain-only users were reassigned to LLM condition\n(Brain-to-LLM). A total of 54 participants took part in Sessions 1-3, with 18\ncompleting session 4. We used electroencephalography (EEG) to assess cognitive\nload during essay writing, and analyzed essays using NLP, as well as scoring\nessays with the help from human teachers and an AI judge. Across groups, NERs,\nn-gram patterns, and topic ontology showed within-group homogeneity. EEG\nrevealed significant differences in brain connectivity: Brain-only participants\nexhibited the strongest, most distributed networks; Search Engine users showed\nmoderate engagement; and LLM users displayed the weakest connectivity.\nCognitive activity scaled down in relation to external tool use. In session 4,\nLLM-to-Brain participants showed reduced alpha and beta connectivity,\nindicating under-engagement. Brain-to-LLM users exhibited higher memory recall\nand activation of occipito-parietal and prefrontal areas, similar to Search\nEngine users. Self-reported ownership of essays was the lowest in the LLM group\nand the highest in the Brain-only group. LLM users also struggled to accurately\nquote their own work. While LLMs offer immediate convenience, our findings\nhighlight potential cognitive costs. Over four months, LLM users consistently\nunderperformed at neural, linguistic, and behavioral levels. These results\nraise concerns about the long-term educational implications of LLM reliance and\nunderscore the need for deeper inquiry into AI's role in learning.",

Extracting entities such as\npercentages of physical and/or psychological disability and the involved\ncompensation amounts is a challenging process, even for experts, due to the\nsubtle arguments and reasoning in the court decision. A two-step procedure is\nproposed: first, segmenting the document identifying the most relevant\nsegments, and then extracting the entities. For text segmentation, two\nmethodologies are compared: a classic method based on regular expressions and a\nsecond approach that divides the document into blocks of n-tokens, which are\nthen vectorized using multilingual models for semantic searches\n(text-embedding-ada-002/MiniLM-L12-v2 ). Subsequently, large language models\n(LLaMA-2 7b, 70b, LLaMA-3 8b, and GPT-4 Turbo) are applied with prompting to\nthe selected segments for entity extraction. For the LLaMA models, fine-tuning\nis performed using LoRA.

Extracting entities such as\npercentages of physical and/or psychological disability and the involved\ncompensation amounts is a challenging process, even for experts, due to the\nsubtle arguments and reasoning in the court decision. A two-step procedure is\nproposed: first, segmenting the document identifying the most relevant\nsegments, and then extracting the entities. For text segmentation, two\nmethodologies are compared: a classic method based on regular expressions and a\nsecond approach that divides the document into blocks of n-tokens, which are\nthen vectorized using multilingual models for semantic searches\n(text-embedding-ada-002/MiniLM-L12-v2 ). Subsequently, large language models\n(LLaMA-2 7b, 70b, LLaMA-3 8b, and GPT-4 Turbo) are applied with prompting to\nthe selected segments for entity extraction. For the LLaMA models, fine-tuning\nis performed using LoRA.

By constraining LLM\nreasoning to respect these security labels, SAFEFLOW prevents untrusted or\nadversarial inputs from contaminating high-integrity decisions. To ensure\nrobustness in concurrent multi-agent settings, SAFEFLOW introduces\ntransactional execution, conflict resolution, and secure scheduling over shared\nstate, preserving global consistency across agents. We further introduce\nmechanisms, including write-ahead logging, rollback, and secure caches, that\nfurther enhance resilience against runtime errors and policy violations. To\nvalidate the performances, we built SAFEFLOWBENCH, a comprehensive benchmark\nsuite designed to evaluate agent reliability under adversarial, noisy, and\nconcurrent operational conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nagents built with SAFEFLOW maintain impressive task performance and security\nguarantees even in hostile environments, substantially outperforming\nstate-of-the-art.

We uncover another asymmetry: while sparing\nfrequently-used neurons significantly improves retention of existing knowledge\nfor non-contradictory updates (98% vs 93% with standard updates), contradictory\nupdates trigger catastrophic interference regardless of targeting strategy.\nThis effect which persists across tested model scales (GPT-2 to GPT-J-6B),\nsuggests a fundamental limitation in how neural networks handle contradictions.\nFinally, we demonstrate that contradictory information can be reliably detected\n(95%+ accuracy) using simple model features, offering a potential protective\nmechanism. These findings motivate new architectures that can, like humans,\nnaturally resist contradictions rather than allowing destructive overwrites."

Existing QR approaches typically fall into two categories:\ndiscriminative models and generative methods leveraging large language models\n(LLMs). Discriminative models often struggle with natural language\nunderstanding and offer limited flexibility in rewriting, while generative\nLLMs, despite producing high-quality rewrites, face high inference latency and\ncost in online settings.

However, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) still struggle\nwith some seemingly straightforward visual tasks, such as counting and solving\njigsaw puzzles. We argue that these tasks challenge the ability of\nvisual-to-textual conversion, where MLLMs convert visual information perceived\nfrom the input scene, to textual information for further reasoning and\ngenerating the answer. If the complexity of the visual input is beyond the\nperceptual capability of the MLLMs, without decomposing this conversion\nprocess, simply scaling inference-time reasoning cannot solve the task because\nit repeatedly encounters the same perceptual bottleneck. We propose an\napproach, autonomous imagination, to enable MLLMs to iteratively modify visual\ninputs (e.g. isolating objects, rearranging puzzle pieces) into intermediate\nvisual states, decomposing visual-to-textual conversion into closed-loop visual\nmodification steps. We show that, without any retraining, MLLMs can now solve\ntasks initially beyond their perceptual capability, highlighting that\nclosed-loop visual modification can be an effective way of decomposing the\nvisual reasoning task into solvable substeps.
