                "summary": "The disaggregated memory (DM) architecture offers high resource elasticity at\nthe cost of data access performance. While caching frequently accessed data in\ncompute nodes (CNs) reduces access overhead, it requires costly centralized\nmaintenance of cache coherence across CNs. This paper presents DiFache, an\nefficient, scalable, and coherent CN-side caching framework for DM\napplications. Observing that DM applications already serialize conflicting\nremote data access internally rather than relying on the cache layer, DiFache\nintroduces decentralized coherence that aligns its consistency model with\nmemory nodes instead of CPU caches, thereby eliminating the need for\ncentralized management.

                    "value": "The disaggregated memory (DM) architecture offers high resource elasticity at\nthe cost of data access performance. While caching frequently accessed data in\ncompute nodes (CNs) reduces access overhead, it requires costly centralized\nmaintenance of cache coherence across CNs. This paper presents DiFache, an\nefficient, scalable, and coherent CN-side caching framework for DM\napplications. Observing that DM applications already serialize conflicting\nremote data access internally rather than relying on the cache layer, DiFache\nintroduces decentralized coherence that aligns its consistency model with\nmemory nodes instead of CPU caches, thereby eliminating the need for\ncentralized management.

We introduce the\nconcept of Chain-of-Representation (CoR), which formulates the hidden states at\neach layer as a combination of multiple sub-representations (i.e., chains) at\nthe hidden dimension level. In each layer, each chain from the output\nrepresentations can only view all of its preceding chains in the input\nrepresentations. Consequently, the model built upon CoM framework can\nprogressively scale up the model size by increasing the chains based on the\nprevious models (i.e., chains), and offer multiple sub-models at varying sizes\nfor elastic inference by using different chain numbers. Based on this\nprinciple, we devise Chain-of-Language-Model (CoLM), which incorporates the\nidea of CoM into each layer of Transformer architecture. Based on CoLM, we\nfurther introduce CoLM-Air by introducing a KV sharing mechanism, that computes\nall keys and values within the first chain and then shares across all chains.\nThis design demonstrates additional extensibility, such as enabling seamless LM\nswitching, prefilling acceleration and so on. Experimental results demonstrate\nour CoLM family can achieve comparable performance to the standard Transformer,\nwhile simultaneously enabling greater flexiblity, such as progressive scaling\nto improve training efficiency and offer multiple varying model sizes for\nelastic inference, paving a a new way toward building language models.

However, as\nthese models continue to scale in size, memory constraints pose substantial\nchallenge. Key and Value cache (KV cache) quantization has been well-documented\nas a promising solution to this limitation. In this work, we provide two novel\ntheorems aimed at enhancing KV quantization methods. Our first theorem, termed\nKey-Value Norm Disparity, states that the key weight matrices by nature carry\nricher information compared to the value weight matrices, as evidenced by\nhigher spectral and Frobenius norms across most of the layers. Our second\ntheorem, Key-Driven Quantization, posits that prioritizing the quantization\nprecision of keys over values induces significant improvements to the overall\nquantization performance. In particular, assigning greater precision to the\nkeys compared to the values achieves a higher degree of precision reduction\nwith minimal impact on model accuracy. We validate these theorems through\ntheory and extensive experiments on several state-of-the-art LLM architectures\nand benchmarks. These findings offer valuable guidelines for improving KV cache\nquantization strategies, facilitating more efficient memory utilization without\ncompromising model performance across diverse NLP tasks.

                    "value": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have introduced significant advancements to the\ncapabilities of Natural Language Processing (NLP) in recent years. However, as\nthese models continue to scale in size, memory constraints pose substantial\nchallenge. Key and Value cache (KV cache) quantization has been well-documented\nas a promising solution to this limitation. In this work, we provide two novel\ntheorems aimed at enhancing KV quantization methods. Our first theorem, termed\nKey-Value Norm Disparity, states that the key weight matrices by nature carry\nricher information compared to the value weight matrices, as evidenced by\nhigher spectral and Frobenius norms across most of the layers. Our second\ntheorem, Key-Driven Quantization, posits that prioritizing the quantization\nprecision of keys over values induces significant improvements to the overall\nquantization performance. In particular, assigning greater precision to the\nkeys compared to the values achieves a higher degree of precision reduction\nwith minimal impact on model accuracy. We validate these theorems through\ntheory and extensive experiments on several state-of-the-art LLM architectures\nand benchmarks. These findings offer valuable guidelines for improving KV cache\nquantization strategies, facilitating more efficient memory utilization without\ncompromising model performance across diverse NLP tasks.

                "summary": "Despite their impressive capabilities, Large Language Models struggle with\ngeneralisation beyond their training distribution, often exhibiting\nsophisticated pattern interpolation rather than true abstract reasoning\n(extrapolation). In this work, we approach this limitation through the lens of\nInformation Bottleneck (IB) theory, which posits that model generalisation\nemerges from an optimal balance between input compression and retention of\npredictive information in latent representations. We prove using IB theory that\ndecoder-only Transformers are inherently constrained in their ability to form\ntask-optimal sequence representations. We then use this result to demonstrate\nthat periodic global transformation of the internal sequence-level\nrepresentations (KV cache) is a necessary computational step for improving\nTransformer generalisation in reasoning tasks. Based on these theoretical\ninsights, we propose a modification to the Transformer architecture, in the\nform of an additional module that globally rewrites the KV cache at periodic\nintervals, shifting its capacity away from memorising input prefixes and toward\nencoding features most useful for predicting future tokens. Our model delivers\nsubstantial gains on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, outperforming both\nvanilla Transformers with up to 3.5x more parameters, as well as\nheuristic-driven pruning mechanisms for cache compression. Our approach can be\nseen as a principled generalisation of existing KV-cache compression methods;\nwhereas such methods focus solely on compressing input representations, they\noften do so at the expense of retaining predictive information, and thus their\ncapabilities are inherently bounded by those of an unconstrained model.

                    "value": "Despite their impressive capabilities, Large Language Models struggle with\ngeneralisation beyond their training distribution, often exhibiting\nsophisticated pattern interpolation rather than true abstract reasoning\n(extrapolation). In this work, we approach this limitation through the lens of\nInformation Bottleneck (IB) theory, which posits that model generalisation\nemerges from an optimal balance between input compression and retention of\npredictive information in latent representations. We prove using IB theory that\ndecoder-only Transformers are inherently constrained in their ability to form\ntask-optimal sequence representations. We then use this result to demonstrate\nthat periodic global transformation of the internal sequence-level\nrepresentations (KV cache) is a necessary computational step for improving\nTransformer generalisation in reasoning tasks. Based on these theoretical\ninsights, we propose a modification to the Transformer architecture, in the\nform of an additional module that globally rewrites the KV cache at periodic\nintervals, shifting its capacity away from memorising input prefixes and toward\nencoding features most useful for predicting future tokens. Our model delivers\nsubstantial gains on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, outperforming both\nvanilla Transformers with up to 3.5x more parameters, as well as\nheuristic-driven pruning mechanisms for cache compression. Our approach can be\nseen as a principled generalisation of existing KV-cache compression methods;\nwhereas such methods focus solely on compressing input representations, they\noften do so at the expense of retaining predictive information, and thus their\ncapabilities are inherently bounded by those of an unconstrained model. This\nestablishes a principled framework to manipulate Transformer memory using\ninformation theory, addressing fundamental reasoning limitations that scaling\nalone cannot overcome."

While existing works can manipulate sounds by text\ninstructions or audio exemplar pairs, they often struggled to modify audio\ncontent precisely while preserving fidelity to the original recording. In this\nwork, we introduce a novel editing approach that enables localized\nmodifications to specific time-frequency regions while keeping the remaining of\nthe audio intact by operating on spectrograms directly. To achieve this, we\npropose AudioMorphix, a training-free audio editor that manipulates a target\nregion on the spectrogram by referring to another recording. Inspired by\nmorphing theory, we conceptualize audio mixing as a process where different\nsounds blend seamlessly through morphing and can be decomposed back into\nindividual components via demorphing. Our AudioMorphix optimizes the noised\nlatent conditioned on raw input and reference audio while rectifying the guided\ndiffusion process through a series of energy functions. Additionally, we\nenhance self-attention layers with a cache mechanism to preserve detailed\ncharacteristics from the original recordings. To advance audio editing\nresearch, we devise a new evaluation benchmark, which includes a curated\ndataset with a variety of editing instructions. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that AudioMorphix yields promising performance on various audio\nediting tasks, including addition, removal, time shifting and stretching, and\npitch shifting, achieving high fidelity and precision.

                    "value": "Editing sound with precision is a crucial yet underexplored challenge in\naudio content creation. While existing works can manipulate sounds by text\ninstructions or audio exemplar pairs, they often struggled to modify audio\ncontent precisely while preserving fidelity to the original recording. In this\nwork, we introduce a novel editing approach that enables localized\nmodifications to specific time-frequency regions while keeping the remaining of\nthe audio intact by operating on spectrograms directly. To achieve this, we\npropose AudioMorphix, a training-free audio editor that manipulates a target\nregion on the spectrogram by referring to another recording. Inspired by\nmorphing theory, we conceptualize audio mixing as a process where different\nsounds blend seamlessly through morphing and can be decomposed back into\nindividual components via demorphing. Our AudioMorphix optimizes the noised\nlatent conditioned on raw input and reference audio while rectifying the guided\ndiffusion process through a series of energy functions. Additionally, we\nenhance self-attention layers with a cache mechanism to preserve detailed\ncharacteristics from the original recordings. To advance audio editing\nresearch, we devise a new evaluation benchmark, which includes a curated\ndataset with a variety of editing instructions. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that AudioMorphix yields promising performance on various audio\nediting tasks, including addition, removal, time shifting and stretching, and\npitch shifting, achieving high fidelity and precision. Demo and code are\navailable at this url."

However, the LLMs still need to encode the entire context for\neach query, leading to redundant computation. In this paper, we investigate a\nnew strategy to eliminate such inefficiency, where the KV cache of each\ndocument is precomputed independently. During inference, the KV caches of\nretrieved documents are concatenated, allowing the model to reuse cached\nrepresentations instead of recomputing them. To mitigate the performance\ndegradation when using KV caches computed independently for each document,\nKVLink introduces two key techniques: adjusting positional embeddings of the KV\ncache at inference to match the global position after concatenation, and using\ntrainable special tokens to restore self-attention across independently encoded\ndocuments. Experiments across 7 datasets demonstrate that KVLink improves\nquestion answering accuracy by an average of 4% over state-of-the-art methods.\nFurthermore, by leveraging precomputed KV caches, our approach reduces\ntime-to-first-token by up to 96% compared to standard LLM inference, making it\na scalable and efficient solution for context reuse.

Yet, learning effective long-context policies from\ndemonstrations remains challenging. As context length increases, training\nbecomes increasingly expensive due to rising memory demands, and policy\nperformance often degrades as a result of spurious correlations. Recent methods\ntypically sidestep these issues by truncating context length, discarding\nhistorical information that may be critical for subsequent decisions. In this\npaper, we propose an alternative approach that explicitly regularizes the\nretention of past information. We first revisit the copycat problem in\nimitation learning and identify an opposite challenge in recent diffusion\npolicies: rather than over-relying on prior actions, they often fail to capture\nessential dependencies between past and future actions. To address this, we\nintroduce Past-Token Prediction (PTP), an auxiliary task in which the policy\nlearns to predict past action tokens alongside future ones. This regularization\nsignificantly improves temporal modeling in the policy head, with minimal\nreliance on visual representations. Building on this observation, we further\nintroduce a multistage training strategy: pre-train the visual encoder with\nshort contexts, and fine-tune the policy head using cached long-context\nembeddings. This strategy preserves the benefits of PTP while greatly reducing\nmemory and computational overhead. Finally, we extend PTP into a\nself-verification mechanism at test time, enabling the policy to score and\nselect candidates consistent with past actions during inference.

                "summary": "Essential to visual generation is efficient modeling of visual data priors.\nConventional next-token prediction methods define the process as learning the\nconditional probability distribution of successive tokens. Recently, next-scale\nprediction methods redefine the process to learn the distribution over\nmulti-scale representations, significantly reducing generation latency.\nHowever, these methods condition each scale on all previous scales and require\neach token to consider all preceding tokens, exhibiting scale and spatial\nredundancy. To better model the distribution by mitigating redundancy, we\npropose Markovian Visual AutoRegressive modeling (MVAR), a novel autoregressive\nframework that introduces scale and spatial Markov assumptions to reduce the\ncomplexity of conditional probability modeling. Specifically, we introduce a\nscale-Markov trajectory that only takes as input the features of adjacent\npreceding scale for next-scale prediction, enabling the adoption of a parallel\ntraining strategy that significantly reduces GPU memory consumption.\nFurthermore, we propose spatial-Markov attention, which restricts the attention\nof each token to a localized neighborhood of size k at corresponding positions\non adjacent scales, rather than attending to every token across these scales,\nfor the pursuit of reduced modeling complexity. Building on these improvements,\nwe reduce the computational complexity of attention calculation from O(N^2) to\nO(Nk), enabling training with just eight NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPUs and eliminating\nthe need for KV cache during inference. Extensive experiments on ImageNet\ndemonstrate that MVAR achieves comparable or superior performance with both\nsmall model trained from scratch and large fine-tuned models, while reducing\nthe average GPU memory footprint by 3.0x.",

                    "value": "Essential to visual generation is efficient modeling of visual data priors.\nConventional next-token prediction methods define the process as learning the\nconditional probability distribution of successive tokens. Recently, next-scale\nprediction methods redefine the process to learn the distribution over\nmulti-scale representations, significantly reducing generation latency.\nHowever, these methods condition each scale on all previous scales and require\neach token to consider all preceding tokens, exhibiting scale and spatial\nredundancy. To better model the distribution by mitigating redundancy, we\npropose Markovian Visual AutoRegressive modeling (MVAR), a novel autoregressive\nframework that introduces scale and spatial Markov assumptions to reduce the\ncomplexity of conditional probability modeling. Specifically, we introduce a\nscale-Markov trajectory that only takes as input the features of adjacent\npreceding scale for next-scale prediction, enabling the adoption of a parallel\ntraining strategy that significantly reduces GPU memory consumption.\nFurthermore, we propose spatial-Markov attention, which restricts the attention\nof each token to a localized neighborhood of size k at corresponding positions\non adjacent scales, rather than attending to every token across these scales,\nfor the pursuit of reduced modeling complexity. Building on these improvements,\nwe reduce the computational complexity of attention calculation from O(N^2) to\nO(Nk), enabling training with just eight NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPUs and eliminating\nthe need for KV cache during inference. Extensive experiments on ImageNet\ndemonstrate that MVAR achieves comparable or superior performance with both\nsmall model trained from scratch and large fine-tuned models, while reducing\nthe average GPU memory footprint by 3.0x."

Unlike image generation, video generation requires a\nsubstantially larger number of tokens to produce coherent temporal frames,\nresulting in significant overhead during the decoding phase. Our key\nobservations are: (i) MLP modules in the decode phase dominate the inference\nlatency, and (ii) there exists high temporal redundancy in MLP outputs of\nadjacent frames. In this paper, we propose the \\textbf{FastCar} framework to\naccelerate the decode phase for the AR video generation by exploring the\ntemporal redundancy. The Temporal Attention Score (TAS) is proposed to\ndetermine whether to apply the replay strategy (\\textit{i.e.}, reusing cached\nMLP outputs from the previous frame to reduce redundant computations) with\ndetailed theoretical analysis and justification. Also, we develop a hardware\naccelerator on FPGA with Dynamic Resource Scheduling (DRS) based on TAS to\nenable better resource utilization and faster inference. Experimental results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our method, which outperforms traditional\nsparse attention approaches with more than 2.1x decoding speedup and higher\nenergy efficiency on the edge. Furthermore, by combining FastCar and sparse\nattention, FastCar can boost the performance of sparse attention with\nalleviated drifting, demonstrating our unique advantages for high-resolution\nand long-duration video generation.

In this paper, we introduce Linear\nAttention Sequence Parallelism (LASP), an efficient SP approach designed for\nlinear attention-based transformer models. Specifically, we design an efficient\npoint-to-point ring-style communication mechanism to leverage the right-product\nkernel trick of linear attention, which sharply decreases the communication\noverhead, comparing with existing SP methods. We enhance the computation\nefficiency of LASP by performing kernel fusion and intermediate state caching,\nmaking the implementation of LASP hardware-friendly on GPUs. Furthermore, we\nmeticulously ensure the compatibility of sequence-level LASP with all types of\nbatch-level data parallel methods, which is vital for distributed training on\nlarge clusters with very-long sequences. We also discuss the generalization of\nLASP on other linear sequence modeling methods. Extensive experiments on linear\nattention-based models are conducted with varying sequence lengths from 2K to\n4096K.

Motivated by these insights, we developed PyramidKV, a\nnovel and effective KV cache compression method. This approach dynamically\nadjusts the KV cache size across different layers, allocating more cache in\nlower layers and less in higher ones, diverging from traditional methods that\nmaintain a uniform KV cache size. Our experimental evaluations, utilizing the\nLongBench benchmark, show that PyramidKV matches the performance of models with\na full KV cache while retaining only 12% of the KV cache, thus significantly\nreducing memory usage. In scenarios emphasizing memory efficiency, where only\n0.7% of the KV cache is maintained, PyramidKV surpasses other KV cache\ncompression techniques, achieving up to a 20.5 absolute accuracy improvement on\nTREC dataset. In the Needle-in-a-Haystack experiment, PyramidKV outperforms\ncompeting methods in maintaining long-context comprehension in LLMs; notably,\nretaining just 128 KV cache entries enables the LLAMA-3-70B model to achieve\n100.0 Acc. performance.",

Our primary\ncontributions include: (1) a hierarchical prompting architecture enabling\nstable simulation beyond 4,000 timesteps while reducing token usage by 73%, (2)\nan attention-based memory system achieving 80% cache hit rates (95% CI [78%,\n82%]) with sub-linear memory growth of 9.5%, and (3) formal bounds on\npersonality stability. Through extensive validation against SNAP ego networks,\nwe demonstrate the first LLM-based framework capable of modeling long-term\nsocial phenomena while maintaining empirically validated behavioral fidelity."

Although large language\nmodels (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across languages and tasks,\ntheir ability to understand Arabic poetry remains largely unexplored. In this\nwork, we introduce `Fann or Flop`, the first benchmark designed to assess the\ncomprehension of Arabic poetry by LLMs in twelve historical eras, covering 21\ncore poetic genres and a variety of metrical forms, from classical structures\nto contemporary free verse. The benchmark comprises a curated corpus of poems\nwith explanations that assess semantic understanding, metaphor interpretation,\nprosodic awareness, and cultural context. We argue that poetic comprehension\noffers a strong indicator for testing how good the LLM is in understanding\nclassical Arabic through the Arabic poetry. Unlike surface-level tasks, this\ndomain demands deeper interpretive reasoning and cultural sensitivity. Our\nevaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs shows that most models struggle with poetic\nunderstanding despite strong results on standard Arabic benchmarks. We release\n`Fann or Flop` along with the evaluation suite as an open-source resource to\nenable rigorous evaluation and advancement for Arabic language models.

Despite understanding the production mechanism of these\nneutrinos, the lack of direct observations raises questions about particle\nacceleration efficiency and the involved astrophysical conditions. This study\nfocuses on neutrino emission from H-rich SNe with low-mass CSM, such as SN\n2023ixf. We developed a semi-analytical model to characterize the progenitor\nand CSM at the explosion time, allowing us to infer the expected neutrino flux\nat Earth during the SN's interaction phase. Our model shows that neutrino\nemission depends not only on shock velocity and CSM mass but also on the\nspatial matter distribution of the CSM. By analysing the bolometric light curve\nof SN 2023ixf beyond 100 days post-explosion, we find that its ejecta,\nconsisting of $9\\,\\text{M}_{\\rm \\odot}$ (including $0.07\\,\\text{M}_{\\rm \\odot}$\nof radioactive $^{56}$Ni) and having a kinetic energy of $1.8\\,\\text{foe}$,\ncollides with a low-mass CSM of $0.06\\,\\text{M}_{\\rm \\odot}$ distributed\naccording to a power-law density profile with an exponent of $s=2.9$. Through\nthese parameters, we estimate that up to $4\\pm1\\times 10^{-2}$ muon\n(anti-)neutrino events could be detected by IceCube within 50 days\npost-explosion. Although the predicted flux ($\\lesssim 3\\times\n10^{-9}\\,\\text{GeV} \\, \\text{cm}^{-2} \\, \\text{s}^{-1}$) is below current\nIceCube sensitivity, future telescopes like IceCube-Gen2 and KM3NeT could\ndetect HE-$\\nu$ from similar SN events.",

                "summary": "Visual Instruction Tuning (VisIT) data, commonly available as human-assistant\nconversations with images interleaved in the human turns, are currently the\nmost widespread vehicle for aligning strong LLMs to understand visual inputs,\nconverting them to strong LMMs. While many VisIT datasets are available, most\nare constructed using ad-hoc techniques developed independently by different\ngroups. They are often poorly documented, lack reproducible code, and rely on\npaid, closed-source model APIs such as GPT-4, Gemini, or Claude to convert\nimage metadata (labels) into VisIT instructions. This leads to high costs and\nmakes it challenging to scale, enhance quality, or generate VisIT data for new\ndatasets. In this work, we address these challenges and propose an open and\nunified recipe and approach,~\\textbf{\\method}, for converting available\nmetadata to VisIT instructions using open LLMs. Our multi-stage \\method\nfeatures an efficient framework for metadata grouping, quality control, data\nand prompt organization, and conversation sampling. We show that our approach\ncan reproduce or enhance the data quality of available VisIT datasets when\napplied to the same image data and metadata sources, improving GPT-4 generated\nVisIT instructions by ~3\\% on average and up to 12\\% on individual benchmarks\nusing open models, such as Gemma 2 27B and LLaMa 3.1 70B. Additionally, our\napproach enables effective performance scaling - both in quantity and quality -\nby enhancing the resulting LMM performance across a wide range of benchmarks.\nWe also analyze the impact of various factors, including conversation format,\nbase model selection, and resampling strategies.

                    "value": "Visual Instruction Tuning (VisIT) data, commonly available as human-assistant\nconversations with images interleaved in the human turns, are currently the\nmost widespread vehicle for aligning strong LLMs to understand visual inputs,\nconverting them to strong LMMs. While many VisIT datasets are available, most\nare constructed using ad-hoc techniques developed independently by different\ngroups. They are often poorly documented, lack reproducible code, and rely on\npaid, closed-source model APIs such as GPT-4, Gemini, or Claude to convert\nimage metadata (labels) into VisIT instructions. This leads to high costs and\nmakes it challenging to scale, enhance quality, or generate VisIT data for new\ndatasets. In this work, we address these challenges and propose an open and\nunified recipe and approach,~\\textbf{\\method}, for converting available\nmetadata to VisIT instructions using open LLMs. Our multi-stage \\method\nfeatures an efficient framework for metadata grouping, quality control, data\nand prompt organization, and conversation sampling. We show that our approach\ncan reproduce or enhance the data quality of available VisIT datasets when\napplied to the same image data and metadata sources, improving GPT-4 generated\nVisIT instructions by ~3\\% on average and up to 12\\% on individual benchmarks\nusing open models, such as Gemma 2 27B and LLaMa 3.1 70B. Additionally, our\napproach enables effective performance scaling - both in quantity and quality -\nby enhancing the resulting LMM performance across a wide range of benchmarks.\nWe also analyze the impact of various factors, including conversation format,\nbase model selection, and resampling strategies.

In this work,\nwe propose \\textbf{ManuSearch}, a transparent and modular multi-agent framework\ndesigned to democratize deep search for LLMs. ManuSearch decomposes the search\nand reasoning process into three collaborative agents: (1) a solution planning\nagent that iteratively formulates sub-queries, (2) an Internet search agent\nthat retrieves relevant documents via real-time web search, and (3) a\nstructured webpage reading agent that extracts key evidence from raw web\ncontent. To rigorously evaluate deep reasoning abilities, we introduce\n\\textbf{ORION}, a challenging benchmark focused on open-web reasoning over\nlong-tail entities, covering both English and Chinese. Experimental results\nshow that ManuSearch substantially outperforms prior open-source baselines and\neven surpasses leading closed-source systems. Our work paves the way for\nreproducible, extensible research in open deep search systems. We release the\ndata and code in https://github.com/RUCAIBox/ManuSearch",

In this work,\nwe propose \\textbf{ManuSearch}, a transparent and modular multi-agent framework\ndesigned to democratize deep search for LLMs. ManuSearch decomposes the search\nand reasoning process into three collaborative agents: (1) a solution planning\nagent that iteratively formulates sub-queries, (2) an Internet search agent\nthat retrieves relevant documents via real-time web search, and (3) a\nstructured webpage reading agent that extracts key evidence from raw web\ncontent. To rigorously evaluate deep reasoning abilities, we introduce\n\\textbf{ORION}, a challenging benchmark focused on open-web reasoning over\nlong-tail entities, covering both English and Chinese. Experimental results\nshow that ManuSearch substantially outperforms prior open-source baselines and\neven surpasses leading closed-source systems. Our work paves the way for\nreproducible, extensible research in open deep search systems. We release the\ndata and code in https://github.com/RUCAIBox/ManuSearch"

Many of these models are optimized\nto predict one step ahead; such approaches produce calibrated one-step\npredictions if the predictive model can quantify uncertainty, such as Deep\nEnsembles. At inference time, multi-step predictions are generated via\nautoregression, which needs a sound uncertainty propagation method to produce\ncalibrated multi-step predictions. This work introduces an alternative\nPredictor-Corrector approach named \\hop{} that uses Modern Hopfield Networks\n(MHN) to learn the errors of a deterministic Predictor that approximates the\ndynamical system. The Corrector predicts a set of errors for the Predictor's\noutput based on a context state at any timestep during autoregression. The set\nof errors creates sharper and well-calibrated prediction intervals with higher\npredictive accuracy compared to baselines without uncertainty propagation. The\ncalibration and prediction performances are evaluated across a set of dynamical\nsystems. This work is also the first to benchmark existing uncertainty\npropagation methods based on calibration errors.",

Many of these models are optimized\nto predict one step ahead; such approaches produce calibrated one-step\npredictions if the predictive model can quantify uncertainty, such as Deep\nEnsembles. At inference time, multi-step predictions are generated via\nautoregression, which needs a sound uncertainty propagation method to produce\ncalibrated multi-step predictions. This work introduces an alternative\nPredictor-Corrector approach named \\hop{} that uses Modern Hopfield Networks\n(MHN) to learn the errors of a deterministic Predictor that approximates the\ndynamical system. The Corrector predicts a set of errors for the Predictor's\noutput based on a context state at any timestep during autoregression. The set\nof errors creates sharper and well-calibrated prediction intervals with higher\npredictive accuracy compared to baselines without uncertainty propagation. The\ncalibration and prediction performances are evaluated across a set of dynamical\nsystems. This work is also the first to benchmark existing uncertainty\npropagation methods based on calibration errors."

We validate AiM-ED using synthetic late gadolinium enhanced (LGE) images\nfrom the MR extended cardiac-torso (MRXCAT) phantom and free-breathing\nsingle-shot LGE images from healthy subjects (24 slices) and patients (5\nslices) under various levels of added noise. Additionally, we demonstrate the\nclinical feasibility of AiM-ED by applying it to data from patients (6 slices)\nscanned on a 0.55T scanner.\n  Results: Compared to a traditional energy-minimization-based image\nregistration method and DL-based VoxelMorph, images registered using AiM-ED\nexhibit higher values of recovery SNR and three perceptual image quality\nmetrics. An ablation study shows the benefit of both jointly processing\nmultiple source images and using an edge map in AiM-ED.\n  Conclusion: For single-shot LGE imaging, AiM-ED outperforms existing image\nregistration methods in terms of image quality. With fast inference, minimal\ntraining data requirements, and robust performance at various noise levels,\nAiM-ED has the potential to benefit single-shot CMR applications.",

                "summary": "Discrete choice models (DCMs) are used to analyze individual decision-making\nin contexts such as transportation choices, political elections, and consumer\npreferences. DCMs play a central role in applied econometrics by enabling\ninference on key economic variables, such as marginal rates of substitution,\nrather than focusing solely on predicting choices on new unlabeled data.\nHowever, while traditional DCMs offer high interpretability and support for\npoint and interval estimation of economic quantities, these models often\nunderperform in predictive tasks compared to deep learning (DL) models. Despite\ntheir predictive advantages, DL models remain largely underutilized in discrete\nchoice due to concerns about their lack of interpretability, unstable parameter\nestimates, and the absence of established methods for uncertainty\nquantification. Here, we introduce a deep learning model architecture\nspecifically designed to integrate with approximate Bayesian inference methods,\nsuch as Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD).

                    "value": "Discrete choice models (DCMs) are used to analyze individual decision-making\nin contexts such as transportation choices, political elections, and consumer\npreferences. DCMs play a central role in applied econometrics by enabling\ninference on key economic variables, such as marginal rates of substitution,\nrather than focusing solely on predicting choices on new unlabeled data.\nHowever, while traditional DCMs offer high interpretability and support for\npoint and interval estimation of economic quantities, these models often\nunderperform in predictive tasks compared to deep learning (DL) models. Despite\ntheir predictive advantages, DL models remain largely underutilized in discrete\nchoice due to concerns about their lack of interpretability, unstable parameter\nestimates, and the absence of established methods for uncertainty\nquantification. Here, we introduce a deep learning model architecture\nspecifically designed to integrate with approximate Bayesian inference methods,\nsuch as Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD).

We observe that many widely-used preference models, including\nhuman evaluators, GPT-4, and top-ranking models on the RewardBench benchmark,\nexhibit strong biases towards specific format patterns, such as lists, links,\nbold text, and emojis. Furthermore, large language models (LLMs) can exploit\nthese biases to achieve higher rankings on popular benchmarks like AlpacaEval\nand LMSYS Chatbot Arena. One notable example of this is verbosity bias, where\ncurrent preference models favor longer responses that appear more\ncomprehensive, even when their quality is equal to or lower than shorter,\ncompeting responses. However, format biases beyond verbosity remain largely\nunderexplored in the literature. In this work, we extend the study of biases in\npreference learning beyond the commonly recognized length bias, offering a\ncomprehensive analysis of a wider range of format biases. Additionally, we show\nthat with a small amount of biased data (less than 1%), we can inject\nsignificant bias into the reward model. Moreover, these format biases can also\nbe easily exploited by downstream alignment algorithms, such as best-of-n\nsampling and online iterative DPO, as it is usually easier to manipulate the\nformat than to improve the quality of responses.

Deep Inverse Reinforcement\nLearning (IRL) methods based on maximum entropy principles show promise in\nrecovering adversaries' goals but are typically offline, require large batch\nsizes with gradient descent, and rely on first-order updates, limiting their\napplicability in real-time scenarios. We propose an online Recursive Deep\nInverse Reinforcement Learning (RDIRL) approach to recover the cost function\ngoverning the adversary actions and goals. Specifically, we minimize an upper\nbound on the standard Guided Cost Learning (GCL) objective using sequential\nsecond-order Newton updates, akin to the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), leading\nto a fast (in terms of convergence) learning algorithm. We demonstrate that\nRDIRL is able to recover cost and reward functions of expert agents in standard\nand adversarial benchmark tasks. Experiments on benchmark tasks show that our\nproposed approach outperforms several leading IRL algorithms.",

One sticking point is\nthat outcome-based reinforcement learning for forecasting must learn from\nbinary, delayed, and noisy rewards, a regime where standard fine-tuning is\nbrittle. We show that outcome-only online RL on a 14B model can match\nfrontier-scale accuracy and surpass it in calibration and hypothetical\nprediction market betting by adapting two leading algorithms, Group-Relative\nPolicy Optimisation (GRPO) and ReMax, to the forecasting setting. Our\nadaptations remove per-question variance scaling in GRPO, apply\nbaseline-subtracted advantages in ReMax, hydrate training with 100k temporally\nconsistent synthetic questions, and introduce lightweight guard-rails that\npenalise gibberish, non-English responses and missing rationales, enabling a\nsingle stable pass over 110k events. Scaling ReMax to 110k questions and\nensembling seven predictions yields a 14B model that matches frontier baseline\no1 on accuracy on our holdout set (Brier = 0.193, p = 0.23) while beating it in\ncalibration (ECE = 0.042, p < 0.001). A simple trading rule turns this\ncalibration edge into \\$127 of hypothetical profit versus \\$92 for o1 (p =\n0.037).

Prior work typically\nprojects gradients of linear layers using approaches based on Singular Value\nDecomposition (SVD). However, applying SVD-based procedures individually to\neach layer in large models is computationally expensive and incurs additional\nmemory costs due to storing the projection matrices. In this work, we propose a\ncomputationally efficient and conceptually simple two-step procedure to\napproximate SVD-based gradient projections into lower-dimensional spaces.\nFirst, we construct a complete orthogonal basis using predefined orthogonal\nmatrices of the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). Second, we adaptively select\nbasis columns based on their alignment with the gradient of each layer. Each\nprojection matrix in our method is obtained via a single matrix multiplication\nfollowed by a lightweight sorting step to identify the most relevant basis\nvectors. Due to the predefined nature of the orthogonal bases, they are\ncomputed once at the start of training. During training, we store only the\nindices of the selected columns, avoiding the need to store full projection\nmatrices for each layer.

                    "value": "Low-rank optimization has emerged as a promising direction in training large\nlanguage models (LLMs) to reduce the memory usage of adaptive optimizers by\nconstraining learning to a lower-dimensional space. Prior work typically\nprojects gradients of linear layers using approaches based on Singular Value\nDecomposition (SVD). However, applying SVD-based procedures individually to\neach layer in large models is computationally expensive and incurs additional\nmemory costs due to storing the projection matrices. In this work, we propose a\ncomputationally efficient and conceptually simple two-step procedure to\napproximate SVD-based gradient projections into lower-dimensional spaces.\nFirst, we construct a complete orthogonal basis using predefined orthogonal\nmatrices of the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). Second, we adaptively select\nbasis columns based on their alignment with the gradient of each layer. Each\nprojection matrix in our method is obtained via a single matrix multiplication\nfollowed by a lightweight sorting step to identify the most relevant basis\nvectors. Due to the predefined nature of the orthogonal bases, they are\ncomputed once at the start of training. During training, we store only the\nindices of the selected columns, avoiding the need to store full projection\nmatrices for each layer. Our numerical experiments on both pre-training and\nfine-tuning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our dual strategy in\napproximating optimal low-rank projections, matching the performance of costly\nSVD-based methods while achieving faster runtime and reduced memory usage."

When there are multiple historical datasets, there has been\nlimited research on how to choose priors for the multiple discounting\nparameters of the NPP to induce desirable information borrowing behavior.

We\ndevelop the adapted normalized power prior (ANPP), which establishes dependence\nbetween the dataset-specific discounting parameters of the NPP, leading to\ninferences that are identical to the BHM. We establish a direct relationship\nbetween the prior for the dataset-specific discounting parameters of the ANPP\nand the prior for the variance parameter of the BHM. Establishing this\nrelationship not only justifies the NPP from the perspective of hierarchical\nmodeling, but also achieves easy prior elicitation for the NPP for the purpose\nof dynamic borrowing.

However, its adoption is limited by the\nhigh cost of expert annotations required for training and inter-observer\nvariability in datasets.

Similarly, promptable segmentation aims to allow\nsegmentation with no re-training for new tasks at inference, however, existing\nmodels perform poorly on pathological regions, again necessitating large\ndatasets for training. In this work we propose a novel approach for promptable\nsegmentation requiring only 24 fully-segmented images, supplemented by 8\nweakly-labelled images, for training. Curating this minimal data to a high\nstandard is relatively feasible and thus issues with the cost and variability\nof obtaining labels can be mitigated. By leveraging two classifiers, one\nweakly-supervised and one fully-supervised, our method refines segmentation\nthrough a guided search process initiated by a single-point prompt. Our\napproach outperforms existing promptable segmentation methods, and performs\ncomparably with fully-supervised methods, for the task of prostate cancer\nsegmentation, while using substantially less annotated data (up to 100X less).\nThis enables promptable segmentation with very minimal labelled data, such that\nthe labels can be curated to a very high standard.",

Experimental results on three established\nT2I meta-evaluation benchmarks demonstrate that T2I-Eval-R1 achieves\nsignificantly higher alignment with human assessments and offers more accurate\ninterpretable score rationales compared to strong baseline methods."

While large-scale LLMs have shown\nimpressive progress in natural language processing tasks, including machine\ntranslation, smaller models. Leveraging this insight, we developed Mutarjim\nbased on Kuwain-1.5B , a language model tailored for both Arabic and English.\nDespite its modest size, Mutarjim outperforms much larger models on several\nestablished benchmarks, achieved through an optimized two-phase training\napproach and a carefully curated, high-quality training corpus.. Experimental\nresults show that Mutarjim rivals models up to 20 times larger while\nsignificantly reducing computational costs and training requirements. We also\nintroduce Tarjama-25, a new benchmark designed to overcome limitations in\nexisting Arabic-English benchmarking datasets, such as domain narrowness, short\nsentence lengths, and English-source bias. Tarjama-25 comprises 5,000\nexpert-reviewed sentence pairs and spans a wide range of domains, offering a\nmore comprehensive and balanced evaluation framework. Notably, Mutarjim\nachieves state-of-the-art performance on the English-to-Arabic task in\nTarjama-25, surpassing even significantly larger and proprietary models like\nGPT-4o mini.

Unlike\nmost existing research, which assumes a closed-set scenario, our work considers\nthe more realistic open-set case, where unknown subjects might be present at\ninference time, and should be correctly recognized by the system. Point clouds\nare well-suited for edge computing applications with resource constraints, but\nare more significantly affected by noise and random fluctuations than other\nrepresentations, like the more common micro-Doppler signature. This is the\nfirst work addressing open-set gait recognition with sparse point cloud data.\nTo do so, we propose a novel neural network architecture that combines\nsupervised classification with unsupervised reconstruction of the point clouds,\ncreating a robust, rich, and highly regularized latent space of gait features.\nTo detect unknown subjects at inference time, we introduce a probabilistic\nnovelty detection algorithm that leverages the structured latent space and\noffers a tunable trade-off between inference speed and prediction accuracy.\nAlong with this paper, we release mmGait10, an original human gait dataset\nfeaturing over five hours of measurements from ten subjects, under varied\nwalking modalities.

In contrast, transformers scale linearly in\nFLOPs and, at best, linearly in memory during generation, since they must\nattend to all previous tokens explicitly. Despite this inference-time\nadvantage, training large RNNs on long contexts remains impractical because\nstandard optimization methods depend on Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT).\nBPTT requires retention of all intermediate activations during the forward\npass, causing memory usage to scale linearly with both context length and model\nsize. In this paper, we show that Zero-Order Optimization (ZOO) methods such as\nRandom-vector Gradient Estimation (RGE) can successfully replace BPTT to train\nRNNs with convergence rates that match, or exceed BPTT by up to 19 fold, while\nusing orders of magnitude less memory and cost, as the model remains in\ninference mode throughout training. We further demonstrate that\nCentral-Difference RGE (CD-RGE) corresponds to optimizing a smoothed surrogate\nloss, inherently regularizing training and improving generalization. Our method\nmatches or outperforms BPTT across three settings: (1) overfitting, (2)\ntransduction, and (3) language modeling. Across all tasks, with sufficient\nperturbations, our models generalize as well as or better than those trained\nwith BPTT, often in fewer steps.

In this paper,\nwe propose a novel mutual distillation framework, LLMD4Rec, that fosters\ndynamic and bidirectional knowledge exchange between LLM-centric and CRM-based\nrecommendation systems. Unlike traditional unidirectional distillation methods,\nLLMD4Rec enables iterative optimization by alternately refining both models,\nenhancing the semantic understanding of CRMs and enriching LLMs with\ncollaborative signals from user-item interactions. By leveraging sample-wise\nadaptive weighting and aligning output distributions, our approach eliminates\nthe need for additional parameters while ensuring effective knowledge transfer.\nExtensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that LLMD4Rec\nsignificantly improves recommendation accuracy across multiple benchmarks\nwithout increasing inference costs. This method provides a scalable and\nefficient solution for combining the strengths of both LLMs and CRMs in\nsequential recommendation systems.",

In this paper,\nwe propose a novel mutual distillation framework, LLMD4Rec, that fosters\ndynamic and bidirectional knowledge exchange between LLM-centric and CRM-based\nrecommendation systems. Unlike traditional unidirectional distillation methods,\nLLMD4Rec enables iterative optimization by alternately refining both models,\nenhancing the semantic understanding of CRMs and enriching LLMs with\ncollaborative signals from user-item interactions. By leveraging sample-wise\nadaptive weighting and aligning output distributions, our approach eliminates\nthe need for additional parameters while ensuring effective knowledge transfer.\nExtensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that LLMD4Rec\nsignificantly improves recommendation accuracy across multiple benchmarks\nwithout increasing inference costs. This method provides a scalable and\nefficient solution for combining the strengths of both LLMs and CRMs in\nsequential recommendation systems."

However, existing models often\nstruggle to effectively fuse and interpret audio information, limiting their\ncapacity for comprehensive video temporal understanding. To address this, we\npresent TriSense, a triple-modality large language model designed for holistic\nvideo temporal understanding through the integration of visual, audio, and\nspeech modalities. Central to TriSense is a Query-Based Connector that\nadaptively reweights modality contributions based on the input query, enabling\nrobust performance under modality dropout and allowing flexible combinations of\navailable inputs. To support TriSense's multimodal capabilities, we introduce\nTriSense-2M, a high-quality dataset of over 2 million curated samples generated\nvia an automated pipeline powered by fine-tuned LLMs. TriSense-2M includes\nlong-form videos and diverse modality combinations, facilitating broad\ngeneralization.

We observe that many widely-used preference models, including\nhuman evaluators, GPT-4, and top-ranking models on the RewardBench benchmark,\nexhibit strong biases towards specific format patterns, such as lists, links,\nbold text, and emojis. Furthermore, large language models (LLMs) can exploit\nthese biases to achieve higher rankings on popular benchmarks like AlpacaEval\nand LMSYS Chatbot Arena. One notable example of this is verbosity bias, where\ncurrent preference models favor longer responses that appear more\ncomprehensive, even when their quality is equal to or lower than shorter,\ncompeting responses. However, format biases beyond verbosity remain largely\nunderexplored in the literature. In this work, we extend the study of biases in\npreference learning beyond the commonly recognized length bias, offering a\ncomprehensive analysis of a wider range of format biases. Additionally, we show\nthat with a small amount of biased data (less than 1%), we can inject\nsignificant bias into the reward model. Moreover, these format biases can also\nbe easily exploited by downstream alignment algorithms, such as best-of-n\nsampling and online iterative DPO, as it is usually easier to manipulate the\nformat than to improve the quality of responses. Our findings emphasize the\nneed to disentangle format and content both for designing alignment algorithms\nand evaluating models.",

The distilled model is effective across multiple\ndatasets and label spaces, outperforming strong baselines of similar size and\napproaching GPT-4's zero-shot performance, while being over 10,000 times\nsmaller."

To overcome the scarcity of high-quality text-music paired data,\nthis paper introduces a dual-source data acquisition approach combining online\nscraping and LLM-based prompting, where carefully designed prompts leverage\nLLMs' comprehensive music knowledge to generate contextually rich descriptions.\nExten1sive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves\nsignificant performance improvements over existing benchmarks through objective\nmetrics, subjective evaluations, and real-world A/B testing on the Huawei Music\nstreaming platform."

We show that outcome-only online RL on a 14B model can match\nfrontier-scale accuracy and surpass it in calibration and hypothetical\nprediction market betting by adapting two leading algorithms, Group-Relative\nPolicy Optimisation (GRPO) and ReMax, to the forecasting setting. Our\nadaptations remove per-question variance scaling in GRPO, apply\nbaseline-subtracted advantages in ReMax, hydrate training with 100k temporally\nconsistent synthetic questions, and introduce lightweight guard-rails that\npenalise gibberish, non-English responses and missing rationales, enabling a\nsingle stable pass over 110k events. Scaling ReMax to 110k questions and\nensembling seven predictions yields a 14B model that matches frontier baseline\no1 on accuracy on our holdout set (Brier = 0.193, p = 0.23) while beating it in\ncalibration (ECE = 0.042, p < 0.001). A simple trading rule turns this\ncalibration edge into \\$127 of hypothetical profit versus \\$92 for o1 (p =\n0.037).

A prerequisite for this vision is understanding how well\nan AI model can identify the underlying structure of a black-box system from\nits behavior. In this paper, we explore how well a large language model (LLM)\nlearns to identify a black-box function from passively observed versus actively\ncollected data. We investigate the reverse-engineering capabilities of LLMs\nacross three distinct types of black-box systems, each chosen to represent\ndifferent problem domains where future autonomous AI researchers may have\nconsiderable impact: Program, Formal Language, and Math Equation. Through\nextensive experiments, we show that LLMs fail to extract information from\nobservations, reaching a performance plateau that falls short of the ideal of\nBayesian inference. However, we demonstrate that prompting LLMs to not only\nobserve but also intervene -- actively querying the black-box with specific\ninputs to observe the resulting output -- improves performance by allowing LLMs\nto test edge cases and refine their beliefs. By providing the intervention data\nfrom one LLM to another, we show that this improvement is partly a result of\nengaging in the process of generating effective interventions, paralleling\nresults in the literature on human learning. Further analysis reveals that\nengaging in intervention can help LLMs escape from two common failure modes:\novercomplication, where the LLM falsely assumes prior knowledge about the\nblack-box, and overlooking, where the LLM fails to incorporate observations.\nThese insights provide practical guidance for helping LLMs more effectively\nreverse-engineer black-box systems, supporting their use in making new\ndiscoveries.",

In this paper, we explore how well a large language model (LLM)\nlearns to identify a black-box function from passively observed versus actively\ncollected data. We investigate the reverse-engineering capabilities of LLMs\nacross three distinct types of black-box systems, each chosen to represent\ndifferent problem domains where future autonomous AI researchers may have\nconsiderable impact: Program, Formal Language, and Math Equation. Through\nextensive experiments, we show that LLMs fail to extract information from\nobservations, reaching a performance plateau that falls short of the ideal of\nBayesian inference. However, we demonstrate that prompting LLMs to not only\nobserve but also intervene -- actively querying the black-box with specific\ninputs to observe the resulting output -- improves performance by allowing LLMs\nto test edge cases and refine their beliefs. By providing the intervention data\nfrom one LLM to another, we show that this improvement is partly a result of\nengaging in the process of generating effective interventions, paralleling\nresults in the literature on human learning. Further analysis reveals that\nengaging in intervention can help LLMs escape from two common failure modes:\novercomplication, where the LLM falsely assumes prior knowledge about the\nblack-box, and overlooking, where the LLM fails to incorporate observations.\nThese insights provide practical guidance for helping LLMs more effectively\nreverse-engineer black-box systems, supporting their use in making new\ndiscoveries."

Experimental\nresults show that Mutarjim rivals models up to 20 times larger while\nsignificantly reducing computational costs and training requirements. We also\nintroduce Tarjama-25, a new benchmark designed to overcome limitations in\nexisting Arabic-English benchmarking datasets, such as domain narrowness, short\nsentence lengths, and English-source bias. Tarjama-25 comprises 5,000\nexpert-reviewed sentence pairs and spans a wide range of domains, offering a\nmore comprehensive and balanced evaluation framework. Notably, Mutarjim\nachieves state-of-the-art performance on the English-to-Arabic task in\nTarjama-25, surpassing even significantly larger and proprietary models like\nGPT-4o mini.

Yet the emergence of AI\nagents driven by large language models (LLMs) threatens to upend this business\nmodel. Agents can not only free user attention with autonomy across diverse\nplatforms and therefore bypass the user-attention-based monetization, but might\nalso become the new entrance for digital traffic. Hence, we argue that\nsuperplatforms have to attack AI agents to defend their centralized control of\ndigital traffic entrance. Specifically, we analyze the fundamental conflict\nbetween user-attention-based monetization and agent-driven autonomy through the\nlens of our gatekeeping theory. We show how AI agents can disintermediate\nsuperplatforms and potentially become the next dominant gatekeepers, thereby\nforming the urgent necessity for superplatforms to proactively constrain and\nattack AI agents. Moreover, we go through the potential technologies for\nsuperplatform-initiated attacks, covering a brand-new, unexplored technical\narea with unique challenges. We have to emphasize that, despite our position,\nthis paper does not advocate for adversarial attacks by superplatforms on AI\nagents, but rather offers an envisioned trend to highlight the emerging\ntensions between superplatforms and AI agents. Our aim is to raise awareness\nand encourage critical discussion for collaborative solutions, prioritizing\nuser interests and perserving the openness of digital ecosystems in the age of\nAI agents.",

We evaluated eight LLMs\nfor factual accuracy and persona consistency. The top-performing open-source\nmodel, Llama 3.3, was validated by four clinicians to confirm the robustness of\nour framework. As an open-source, customizable platform, PatientSim provides a\nreproducible and scalable solution that can be customized for specific training\nneeds.

However, their reliability decreases when confronted with\nconflicting evidence from sources of varying credibility. This paper presents\nthe first systematic evaluation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models\nfor fact-checking in the presence of conflicting evidence. To support this\nstudy, we introduce \\textbf{CONFACT} (\\textbf{Con}flicting Evidence for\n\\textbf{Fact}-Checking) (Dataset available at\nhttps://github.com/zoeyyes/CONFACT), a novel dataset comprising questions\npaired with conflicting information from various sources. Extensive experiments\nreveal critical vulnerabilities in state-of-the-art RAG methods, particularly\nin resolving conflicts stemming from differences in media source credibility.\nTo address these challenges, we investigate strategies to integrate media\nbackground information into both the retrieval and generation stages. Our\nresults show that effectively incorporating source credibility significantly\nenhances the ability of RAG models to resolve conflicting evidence and improve\nfact-checking performance."

Using this method, we evaluate state-of-the-art\nproprietary and open-source LLMs on two datasets available in English and\nSpanish: the public MMLU benchmark and the private UNED-Access 2024 dataset.\nResults show that all models experience remarkable accuracy drops under our\nproposed variation, with an average loss of 57% on MMLU and 50% on UNED-Access\n2024, ranging from 10% to 93% across models. Notably, the most accurate model\nin our experimentation (OpenAI-o3-mini) is not the most robust\n(DeepSeek-R1-70B), suggesting that the best models in standard evaluations may\nnot be the ones with better reasoning capabilities.
