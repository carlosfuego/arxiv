Speculative decoding (SD) is a widely used\ntechnique to reduce latency without sacrificing performance but the\nconventional wisdom suggests that its efficacy is limited to small batch sizes.\nIn MagicDec, we show that surprisingly SD can achieve speedup even for a high\nthroughput inference regime for moderate to long sequences. More interestingly,\nan intelligent drafting strategy can achieve better speedup with increasing\nbatch size based on our rigorous analysis. MagicDec first identifies the\nbottleneck shifts with increasing batch size and sequence length, and uses\nthese insights to deploy speculative decoding more effectively for high\nthroughput inference. Then, it leverages draft models with sparse KV cache to\naddress the KV bottleneck that scales with both sequence length and batch size.\nThis finding underscores the broad applicability of speculative decoding in\nlong-context serving, as it can enhance throughput and reduce latency without\ncompromising accuracy. For moderate to long sequences, we demonstrate up to 2x\nspeedup for LLaMA-2-7B-32K and 1.84x speedup for LLaMA-3.1-8B when serving\nbatch sizes ranging from 32 to 256 on 8 NVIDIA A100 GPUs.

Besides, We find that many writes are duplicate, and the duplication\ncan be inter-dup and intra-dup. While inter-dup means different memory blocks\nare identical, and intra-dup means all the 4B elements in a line are the same.\nIn this work, we propose a cache-assisted GPU memory deduplication architecture\nnamed CMD to reduce the off-chip accesses via utilizing the data duplication in\nGPU applications. CMD includes three key design contributions which aim to\nreduce the three kinds of accesses: (1) A novel GPU memory deduplication\narchitecture that removes the inter-dup and inter-dup lines. As for the\ninter-dup detection, we reduce the extra read requests caused by the\ntraditional read-verify hash process. Besides, we design several techniques to\nmanage duplicate blocks. (2) We propose a cache-assisted read scheme to reduce\nthe reads to duplicate data. When an L2 cache miss wants to read the duplicate\nblock, if the reference block has been fetched to L2 and it is clean, we can\ncopy it to the L2 missed block without accessing off-chip DRAM. As for the\nreads to intra-dup data, CMD uses the on-chip metadata cache to get the data.\n(3) When a cache line is evicted, the clean sectors in the line are invalidated\nwhile the dirty sectors are written back. However, most read-only victims are\nre-referenced from DRAM more than twice. Therefore, we add a full-associate\nFIFO to accommodate the read-only (it is also clean) victims to reduce the\nre-reference counts. Experiments show that CMD can decrease the off-chip\naccesses by 31.01%, reduce the energy by 32.78% and improve performance by\n37.79%.

However, their efficiency is challenged by the Transformer\narchitecture' s struggle with handling long texts. KV-Cache has emerged as a\npivotal solution to this issue, converting the time complexity of token\ngeneration from quadratic to linear, albeit with increased GPU memory overhead\nproportional to conversation length. With the development of the LLM community\nand academia, various KV-Cache compression methods have been proposed. In this\nreview, we dissect the various properties of KV-Cache and elaborate on various\nmethods currently used to optimize the KV-Cache space usage of LLMs. These\nmethods span the pre-training phase, deployment phase, and inference phase, and\nwe summarize the commonalities and differences among these methods.\nAdditionally, we list some metrics for evaluating the long-text capabilities of\nlarge language models, from both efficiency and capability perspectives. Our\nreview thus sheds light on the evolving landscape of LLM optimization, offering\ninsights into future advancements in this dynamic field.",

                    "value": "Large Language Models (LLMs), epitomized by ChatGPT' s release in late 2022,\nhave revolutionized various industries with their advanced language\ncomprehension. However, their efficiency is challenged by the Transformer\narchitecture' s struggle with handling long texts. KV-Cache has emerged as a\npivotal solution to this issue, converting the time complexity of token\ngeneration from quadratic to linear, albeit with increased GPU memory overhead\nproportional to conversation length. With the development of the LLM community\nand academia, various KV-Cache compression methods have been proposed. In this\nreview, we dissect the various properties of KV-Cache and elaborate on various\nmethods currently used to optimize the KV-Cache space usage of LLMs. These\nmethods span the pre-training phase, deployment phase, and inference phase, and\nwe summarize the commonalities and differences among these methods.\nAdditionally, we list some metrics for evaluating the long-text capabilities of\nlarge language models, from both efficiency and capability perspectives. Our\nreview thus sheds light on the evolving landscape of LLM optimization, offering\ninsights into future advancements in this dynamic field."

                "summary": "Compute Express Link (CXL) emerges as a solution for wide gap between\ncomputational speed and data communication rates among host and multiple\ndevices. It fosters a unified and coherent memory space between host and CXL\nstorage devices such as such as Solid-state drive (SSD) for memory expansion,\nwith a corresponding DRAM implemented as the device cache. However, this\nintroduces challenges such as substantial cache miss penalties, sub-optimal\ncaching due to data access granularity mismatch between the DRAM \"cache\" and\nSSD \"memory\", and inefficient hardware cache management. To address these\nissues, we propose a novel solution, named ICGMM, which optimizes caching and\neviction directly on hardware, employing a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)-based\napproach.

                    "value": "Compute Express Link (CXL) emerges as a solution for wide gap between\ncomputational speed and data communication rates among host and multiple\ndevices. It fosters a unified and coherent memory space between host and CXL\nstorage devices such as such as Solid-state drive (SSD) for memory expansion,\nwith a corresponding DRAM implemented as the device cache. However, this\nintroduces challenges such as substantial cache miss penalties, sub-optimal\ncaching due to data access granularity mismatch between the DRAM \"cache\" and\nSSD \"memory\", and inefficient hardware cache management. To address these\nissues, we propose a novel solution, named ICGMM, which optimizes caching and\neviction directly on hardware, employing a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)-based\napproach.

Efficient Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is\ncrucial to address these issues.

However, these\nstudies only focus on one or several characteristics of NVM, while failing to\nexploit its best practice by putting NVM in the proper position of the whole\nstorage stack. In this paper, we present NVPC, a transparent acceleration to\nexisting kernel file systems with an NVM-enhanced page cache. The acceleration\nlies in two aspects, respectively matching the desperate needs of existing disk\nfile systems: sync writes and cache-missed operations. Besides, the fast DRAM\npage cache is preserved for cache-hit operations. For sync writes, a\nhigh-performance log-based sync absorbing area is provided to redirect data\ndestination from the slow disk to the fast NVM. Meanwhile, the byte-addressable\nfeature of NVM is used to prevent write amplification. For cache-missed\noperations, NVPC makes use of the idle space on NVM to extend the DRAM page\ncache, so that more and larger workloads can fit into the cache. NVPC is\nentirely implemented as a page cache, thus can provide efficient speed-up to\ndisk file systems with full transparency to users and full compatibility to\nlower file systems.\n  In Filebench macro-benchmarks, NVPC achieves at most 3.55x, 2.84x, and 2.64x\nfaster than NOVA, Ext-4, and SPFS. In RocksDB workloads with working set larger\nthan DRAM, NVPC achieves 1.12x, 2.59x, and 2.11x faster than NOVA, Ext-4, and\nSPFS. Meanwhile, NVPC gains positive revenue from NOVA, Ext-4, and SPFS in\n62.5% of the tested cases in our read/write/sync mixed evaluation,\ndemonstrating that NVPC is more balanced and adaptive to complex real-world\nworkloads. Experimental results also show that NVPC is the only method that\naccelerates Ext-4 in particular cases for up to 15.19x, with no slow-down to\nany other use cases.",

However, key-value (KV) cache, which is stored to avoid\nre-computation, has emerged as a critical bottleneck by growing linearly in\nsize with the sequence length. Due to the auto-regressive nature of LLMs, the\nentire KV cache will be loaded for every generated token, resulting in low\nutilization of computational cores and high latency. While various compression\nmethods for KV cache have been proposed to alleviate this issue, they suffer\nfrom degradation in generation quality. We introduce TriForce, a hierarchical\nspeculative decoding system that is scalable for long sequence generation. This\napproach leverages the original model weights and dynamic sparse KV cache via\nretrieval as a draft model, which serves as an intermediate layer in the\nhierarchy and is further speculated by a smaller model to reduce its drafting\nlatency. TriForce not only facilitates impressive speedups for Llama2-7B-128K,\nachieving up to 2.31$\\times$ on an A100 GPU but also showcases scalability in\nhandling even longer contexts. For the offloading setting on two RTX 4090 GPUs,\nTriForce achieves 0.108s/token$\\unicode{x2014}$only half as slow as the\nauto-regressive baseline on an A100, which attains 7.78$\\times$ on our\noptimized offloading system. Additionally, TriForce performs 4.86$\\times$ than\nDeepSpeed-Zero-Inference on a single RTX 4090 GPU.

Despite extensive research on certain sparse kernels,\nsuch as Sparse Matrix-Vector Multiplication (SpMV), the overall family of\nsparse algorithms has yet to be investigated as a whole. This paper introduces\nSpChar, a workload characterization methodology for general sparse computation.\nSpChar employs tree-based models to identify the most relevant hardware and\ninput characteristics, starting from hardware and input-related metrics\ngathered from Performance Monitoring Counters (PMCs) and matrices. Our analysis\nenables the creation of a characterization loop that facilitates the\noptimization of sparse computation by mapping the impact of architectural\nfeatures to inputs and algorithmic choices. We apply SpChar to more than 600\nmatrices from the SuiteSparse Matrix collection and three state-of-the-art Arm\nCPUs to determine the critical hardware and software characteristics that\naffect sparse computation. In our analysis, we determine that the biggest\nlimiting factors for high-performance sparse computation are (1) the latency of\nthe memory system, (2) the pipeline flush overhead resulting from branch\nmisprediction, and (3) the poor reuse of cached elements. Additionally, we\npropose software and hardware optimizations that designers can implement to\ncreate a platform suitable for sparse computation.

The second is\nknowledge-guided cache refinement, which refines pair values (i.e.,\npseudo-labels) and cache weights by leveraging knowledge distillation from\nlarge-scale vision language models.

Our analysis\nreveals that, apart from the fact that different applications may require\ndifferent retention times, the clock frequency, which is typically ignored in\nmost STT-RAM studies, may also significantly impact applications' retention\ntime needs. Based on our findings, we propose an asymmetric-retention core\n(ARC) design for multicore architectures. ARC features retention time\nheterogeneity to specialize STT-RAM retention times to applications' needs. We\nalso propose a runtime prediction model to determine the best core on which to\nrun an application, based on the applications' characteristics, their retention\ntime requirements, and available DVFS settings. Results reveal that the\nproposed approach can reduce the average cache energy by 20.19% and overall\nprocessor energy by 7.66%, compared to a homogeneous STT-RAM cache design.",

Our analysis\nreveals that, apart from the fact that different applications may require\ndifferent retention times, the clock frequency, which is typically ignored in\nmost STT-RAM studies, may also significantly impact applications' retention\ntime needs. Based on our findings, we propose an asymmetric-retention core\n(ARC) design for multicore architectures. ARC features retention time\nheterogeneity to specialize STT-RAM retention times to applications' needs. We\nalso propose a runtime prediction model to determine the best core on which to\nrun an application, based on the applications' characteristics, their retention\ntime requirements, and available DVFS settings. Results reveal that the\nproposed approach can reduce the average cache energy by 20.19% and overall\nprocessor energy by 7.66%, compared to a homogeneous STT-RAM cache design."

Building on these insights, we introduce the\nVCUT, a training-free approach optimized for efficiency within the SVD\narchitecture. VCUT eliminates temporal cross-attention and replaces spatial\ncross-attention with a one-time computed linear layer, significantly reducing\ncomputational load. The implementation of VCUT leads to a reduction of up to\n322T Multiple-Accumulate Operations (MACs) per video and a decrease in model\nparameters by up to 50M, achieving a 20% reduction in latency compared to the\nbaseline.

As a solution, we propose\nDynamic Memory Compression (DMC), a method for online key-value cache\ncompression at inference time. Most importantly, the model learns to apply\ndifferent compression ratios in different heads and layers. We retrofit\npre-trained LLMs such as Llama 2 (7B, 13B and 70B) into DMC Transformers,\nachieving up to 7x throughput increase during auto-regressive inference on an\nNVIDIA H100 GPU. DMC is applied via continued pre-training on a negligible\npercentage of the original data without adding any extra parameters. DMC\npreserves the original downstream performance with up to 4x cache compression,\noutperforming up-trained grouped-query attention (GQA) and key-value eviction\npolicies (H$_2$O, TOVA). GQA and DMC can be even combined to obtain compounded\ngains.

                    "value": "Transformers have emerged as the backbone of large language models (LLMs).\nHowever, generation remains inefficient due to the need to store in memory a\ncache of key-value representations for past tokens, whose size scales linearly\nwith the input sequence length and batch size. As a solution, we propose\nDynamic Memory Compression (DMC), a method for online key-value cache\ncompression at inference time. Most importantly, the model learns to apply\ndifferent compression ratios in different heads and layers. We retrofit\npre-trained LLMs such as Llama 2 (7B, 13B and 70B) into DMC Transformers,\nachieving up to 7x throughput increase during auto-regressive inference on an\nNVIDIA H100 GPU. DMC is applied via continued pre-training on a negligible\npercentage of the original data without adding any extra parameters. DMC\npreserves the original downstream performance with up to 4x cache compression,\noutperforming up-trained grouped-query attention (GQA) and key-value eviction\npolicies (H$_2$O, TOVA). GQA and DMC can be even combined to obtain compounded\ngains. Hence, DMC can serve as a drop-in replacement for KV caching in existing\nLLMs to fit longer contexts and larger batches within any given memory budget."

In\nthis paper, we introduce the notion of compaction chains and we analyse how\nthey affect tail latency. Then, we show that modern designs reduce tail\nlatency, by trading I/O amplification or require large amounts of memory. Based\non our analysis, we present vLSM, a new KV store design that improves tail\nlatency significantly without compromising on memory or I/O amplification. vLSM\nreduces (a) compaction chain width by using small SSTs and eliminating the\ntiering compaction required in L0 by modern systems and (b) compaction chain\nlength by using a larger than typical growth factor between L1 and L2 and\nintroducing overlap-aware SSTs in L1. We implement vLSM in RocksDB and evaluate\nit using db_bench and YCSB. Our evaluation highlights the underlying trade-off\namong memory requirements, I/O amplification, and tail latency, as well as the\nadvantage of vLSM over current approaches. vLSM improves P99 tail latency by up\nto 4.8x for writes and by up to 12.5x for reads, reduces cumulative write\nstalls by up to 60% while also slightly improves I/O amplification at the same\nmemory budget.",

However,\nthis approach suffers from the high computational costs of graph partitioning\nalgorithms and inefficient communication across GPUs.\n  To address these overheads, we propose Large-scale Storage-based Multi-GPU\nGNN framework (LSM-GNN), a storagebased approach to train GNN models that\nutilizes a novel communication layer enabling GPU software caches to function\nas a system-wide shared cache with low overheads.LSM-GNN incorporates a hybrid\neviction policy that intelligently manages cache space by using both static and\ndynamic node information to significantly enhance cache performance.\nFurthermore, we introduce the Preemptive Victim-buffer Prefetcher (PVP), a\nmechanism for prefetching node feature data from a Victim Buffer located in CPU\npinned-memory to further reduce the pressure on the storage devices.\nExperimental results show that despite the lower compute capabilities and\nmemory capacities, LSM-GNN in a single node with two GPUs offers superior\nperformance over two-node-four-GPU Dist-DGL baseline and provides up to 3.75x\nspeed up on end-to-end epoch time while running large-scale GNN training",

However,\nthis approach suffers from the high computational costs of graph partitioning\nalgorithms and inefficient communication across GPUs.\n  To address these overheads, we propose Large-scale Storage-based Multi-GPU\nGNN framework (LSM-GNN), a storagebased approach to train GNN models that\nutilizes a novel communication layer enabling GPU software caches to function\nas a system-wide shared cache with low overheads.LSM-GNN incorporates a hybrid\neviction policy that intelligently manages cache space by using both static and\ndynamic node information to significantly enhance cache performance.\nFurthermore, we introduce the Preemptive Victim-buffer Prefetcher (PVP), a\nmechanism for prefetching node feature data from a Victim Buffer located in CPU\npinned-memory to further reduce the pressure on the storage devices.\nExperimental results show that despite the lower compute capabilities and\nmemory capacities, LSM-GNN in a single node with two GPUs offers superior\nperformance over two-node-four-GPU Dist-DGL baseline and provides up to 3.75x\nspeed up on end-to-end epoch time while running large-scale GNN training"

To mitigate computational costs, LLMs often employ the KV\nCache technique to improve the generation speed. While improving the\ncomputational efficiency, the storage requirements of the KV cache are\nsubstantial, particularly in long-context scenarios, leading to significant\nmemory consumption. Existing KV cache eviction methods often degrade the\nperformance of LLMs in long-context scenarios due to the information loss\nintroduced by eviction. In this paper, we propose a novel KV cache merging\napproach, called KVMerger, to achieve adaptive KV cache compression for\nlong-context tasks without significant performance degradation under\nconstrained memory budgets. Our approach is inspired by the intriguing\nobservation that key states exhibit high similarity at the token level within a\nsingle sequence. To facilitate merging, we develop an effective yet\nstraightforward merging set identification algorithm to identify suitable KV\nstates for merging. Our merging set identification algorithm stimulates the\nsecond observation that KV cache sparsity, from similarity perspective, is\nindependent of the dataset and remains persistent at the model level.\nSubsequently, we propose a Gaussian kernel weighted merging algorithm to\nselectively merge all states within each merging set. We conduct extensive\nexperiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of KVMerger for long-context tasks\nunder constrained memory budgets, applying it to models including\nLlama2-7B-chat and Llama2-13B-chat. Using the LongBench and ZeroScroll\nbenchmarks, we compare our method with other KV cache compression techniques,\nincluding H2O and CaM, showing that our method achieves superior performance\nacross tasks with both 50% and 35% KV cache budgets.",

                "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have become more prevalent in long-context\napplications such as interactive chatbots, document analysis, and agent\nworkflows, but it is challenging to serve long-context requests with low\nlatency and high throughput. Speculative decoding (SD) is a widely used\ntechnique to reduce latency without sacrificing performance but the\nconventional wisdom suggests that its efficacy is limited to small batch sizes.\nIn MagicDec, we show that surprisingly SD can achieve speedup even for a high\nthroughput inference regime for moderate to long sequences. More interestingly,\nan intelligent drafting strategy can achieve better speedup with increasing\nbatch size based on our rigorous analysis. MagicDec first identifies the\nbottleneck shifts with increasing batch size and sequence length, and uses\nthese insights to deploy speculative decoding more effectively for high\nthroughput inference. Then, it leverages draft models with sparse KV cache to\naddress the KV bottleneck that scales with both sequence length and batch size.\nThis finding underscores the broad applicability of speculative decoding in\nlong-context serving, as it can enhance throughput and reduce latency without\ncompromising accuracy. For moderate to long sequences, we demonstrate up to 2x\nspeedup for LLaMA-2-7B-32K and 1.84x speedup for LLaMA-3.1-8B when serving\nbatch sizes ranging from 32 to 256 on 8 NVIDIA A100 GPUs.

                    "value": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have become more prevalent in long-context\napplications such as interactive chatbots, document analysis, and agent\nworkflows, but it is challenging to serve long-context requests with low\nlatency and high throughput. Speculative decoding (SD) is a widely used\ntechnique to reduce latency without sacrificing performance but the\nconventional wisdom suggests that its efficacy is limited to small batch sizes.\nIn MagicDec, we show that surprisingly SD can achieve speedup even for a high\nthroughput inference regime for moderate to long sequences. More interestingly,\nan intelligent drafting strategy can achieve better speedup with increasing\nbatch size based on our rigorous analysis. MagicDec first identifies the\nbottleneck shifts with increasing batch size and sequence length, and uses\nthese insights to deploy speculative decoding more effectively for high\nthroughput inference. Then, it leverages draft models with sparse KV cache to\naddress the KV bottleneck that scales with both sequence length and batch size.\nThis finding underscores the broad applicability of speculative decoding in\nlong-context serving, as it can enhance throughput and reduce latency without\ncompromising accuracy. For moderate to long sequences, we demonstrate up to 2x\nspeedup for LLaMA-2-7B-32K and 1.84x speedup for LLaMA-3.1-8B when serving\nbatch sizes ranging from 32 to 256 on 8 NVIDIA A100 GPUs.

                "summary": "Code benchmarks such as HumanEval are widely adopted to evaluate the\ncapabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), providing insights into their\nstrengths and weaknesses. However, current benchmarks primarily exercise LLMs'\ncapability on common coding tasks (e.g., bubble sort, greatest common divisor),\nleaving domain-specific coding tasks (e.g., computation, system, cryptography)\nunexplored. To fill this gap, we propose a multi-domain code benchmark,\nDOMAINEVAL, designed to evaluate LLMs' coding capabilities thoroughly. Our\npipeline works in a fully automated manner, enabling a push-bottom construction\nfrom code repositories into formatted subjects under study.

To fill this gap, we propose a multi-domain code benchmark,\nDOMAINEVAL, designed to evaluate LLMs' coding capabilities thoroughly.

To address this challenge, this study proposes an innovative model,\nSpatial-to-Relational Transformation and Curriculum Q-Learning (S2RCQL). To\naddress the spatial hallucination of LLMs, we propose the Spatial-to-Relational\napproach, which transforms spatial prompts into entity relations and paths\nrepresenting entity relation chains.

As a result, we design a path-planning\nalgorithm based on Q-learning to mitigate the context inconsistency\nhallucination, which enhances the reasoning ability of LLMs. Using the Q-value\nof state-action as auxiliary information for prompts, we correct the\nhallucinations of LLMs, thereby guiding LLMs to learn the optimal path.\nFinally, we propose a reverse curriculum learning technique based on LLMs to\nfurther mitigate the context inconsistency hallucination.

While prior research has\ninvestigated the effect of information technology in general on human labor\nfrom a macro perspective, this paper complements the literature by examining\nthe impact of LLMs on freelancers from a micro perspective. Specifically, we\nleverage the release of ChatGPT to investigate how AI influences freelancers\nacross different online labor markets (OLMs). Employing the\nDifference-in-Differences method, we discovered two distinct scenarios\nfollowing ChatGPT's release: 1) the displacement effect of LLMs, featuring\nreduced work volume and earnings, as is exemplified by the translation &\nlocalization OLM; 2) the productivity effect of LLMs, featuring increased work\nvolume and earnings, as is exemplified by the web development OLM. To shed\nlight on the underlying mechanisms, we developed a Cournot-type competition\nmodel to highlight the existence of an inflection point for each occupation\nwhich separates the timeline of AI progress into a honeymoon phase and a\nsubstitution phase. Before AI performance crosses the inflection point, human\nlabor benefits each time AI improves, resulting in the honeymoon phase.\nHowever, after AI performance crosses the inflection point, additional AI\nenhancement hurts human labor. Further analyzing the progression from ChatGPT\n3.5 to 4.0, we found three effect scenarios (i.e., productivity to\nproductivity, displacement to displacement, and productivity to displacement),\nconsistent with the inflection point conjecture. Heterogeneous analyses reveal\nthat U.S. web developers tend to benefit more from the release of ChatGPT\ncompared to their counterparts in other regions, and somewhat surprisingly,\nexperienced translators seem more likely to exit the market than less\nexperienced translators after the release of ChatGPT.",

While\nthis offers great language interoperability, high-level programming languages\nlike C++ make software development quicker and less error-prone.\n  We propose novel C++ language bindings that cover all abstraction levels from\nlow-level MPI calls to convenient STL-style bindings, where most parameters are\ninferred from a small subset of parameters, by bringing named parameters to\nC++. This enables rapid prototyping and fine-tuning runtime behavior and memory\nmanagement. A flexible type system and additional safety guarantees help to\nprevent programming errors.\n  By exploiting C++'s template metaprogramming capabilities, this has (near)\nzero overhead, as only required code paths are generated at compile time.\n  We demonstrate that our library is a strong foundation for a future\ndistributed standard library using multiple application benchmarks, ranging\nfrom text-book sorting algorithms to phylogenetic interference."

We conduct\nexperiments on 3 benchmark datasets in knowledge-intensive question answering\ntask with different LLMs and domains, achieving the new state-of-the-art.\nFurther analysis shows the effectiveness of different modules in our approach."

Extensive experiments on multimodal\ndatasets reveal that our approach significantly improves ICL performance across\nvarious scenarios, such as challenging tasks and resource-constrained\nenvironments.

To facilitate the effective\ntraining of ParGo, we collect a large-scale detail-captioned image-text dataset\nnamed ParGoCap-1M-PT, consisting of 1 million images paired with high-quality\ncaptions. Extensive experiments on several MLLM benchmarks demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our ParGo, highlighting its superiority in aligning vision and\nlanguage modalities. Compared to conventional Q-Former projector, our ParGo\nachieves an improvement of 259.96 in MME benchmark.

To address this issue, we propose SUBLLM, short for\nSubsampling-Upsampling-Bypass Large Language Model, an innovative architecture\nthat extends the core decoder-only framework by incorporating subsampling,\nupsampling, and bypass modules. The subsampling modules are responsible for\nshortening the sequence, while the upsampling modules restore the sequence\nlength, and the bypass modules enhance convergence.

In this\nwork, we propose a novel test-time defense strategy called Robust Feature\nInference (RFI) that is easy to integrate with any existing (robust) training\nprocedure without additional test-time computation. Based on the notion of\nrobustness of features that we present, the key idea is to project the trained\nmodels to the most robust feature space, thereby reducing the vulnerability to\nadversarial attacks in non-robust directions. We theoretically characterize the\nsubspace of the eigenspectrum of the feature covariance that is the most robust\nfor a generalized additive model. Our extensive experiments on CIFAR-10,\nCIFAR-100, tiny ImageNet and ImageNet datasets for several robustness\nbenchmarks, including the state-of-the-art methods in RobustBench show that RFI\nimproves robustness across adaptive and transfer attacks consistently.

Online Subspace\nDescent is flexible and introduces only minimum overhead to training. We show\nthat for the task of pretraining LLaMA models ranging from 60M to 7B parameters\non the C4 dataset, Online Subspace Descent achieves lower perplexity and better\ndownstream tasks performance than state-of-the-art low-rank training methods\nacross different settings and narrows the gap with full-rank baselines."

To address these challenges, we\nderive adjustment terms for model bias and policy shift within a unified\nprobabilistic inference framework.

                "summary": "As a key component in boosting online user growth, uplift modeling aims to\nmeasure individual user responses (e.g., whether to play the game) to various\ntreatments, such as gaming bonuses, thereby enhancing business outcomes.\nHowever, previous research typically considers a single-task, single-treatment\nsetting, where only one treatment exists and the overall treatment effect is\nmeasured by a single type of user response. In this paper, we propose a\nMulti-Treatment Multi-Task (MTMT) uplift network to estimate treatment effects\nin a multi-task scenario. We identify the multi-treatment problem as a causal\ninference problem with a tiered response, comprising a base effect (from\noffering a treatment) and an incremental effect (from offering a specific type\nof treatment), where the base effect can be numerically much larger than the\nincremental effect. Specifically, MTMT separately encodes user features and\ntreatments.

                    "value": "As a key component in boosting online user growth, uplift modeling aims to\nmeasure individual user responses (e.g., whether to play the game) to various\ntreatments, such as gaming bonuses, thereby enhancing business outcomes.\nHowever, previous research typically considers a single-task, single-treatment\nsetting, where only one treatment exists and the overall treatment effect is\nmeasured by a single type of user response. In this paper, we propose a\nMulti-Treatment Multi-Task (MTMT) uplift network to estimate treatment effects\nin a multi-task scenario. We identify the multi-treatment problem as a causal\ninference problem with a tiered response, comprising a base effect (from\noffering a treatment) and an incremental effect (from offering a specific type\nof treatment), where the base effect can be numerically much larger than the\nincremental effect. Specifically, MTMT separately encodes user features and\ntreatments. The user feature encoder uses a multi-gate mixture of experts\n(MMOE) network to encode relevant user features, explicitly learning inter-task\nrelations. The resultant embeddings are used to measure natural responses per\ntask.

In our study, we introduce\nAutoJailbreak, an innovative automatic jailbreak technique inspired by prompt\noptimization. We leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) for red-teaming to\nrefine the jailbreak prompt and employ weak-to-strong in-context learning\nprompts to boost efficiency. Furthermore, we present an effective search method\nthat incorporates early stopping to minimize optimization time and token\nexpenditure. Our experiments demonstrate that AutoJailbreak significantly\nsurpasses conventional methods, achieving an Attack Success Rate (ASR)\nexceeding 95.3\\%. This research sheds light on strengthening GPT-4V security,\nunderscoring the potential for LLMs to be exploited in compromising GPT-4V\nintegrity.",

                "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 and Llama3 have significantly\nimpacted various fields by enabling high-quality synthetic data generation and\nreducing dependence on expensive human-generated datasets. Despite this,\nchallenges remain in the areas of generalization, controllability, diversity,\nand truthfulness within the existing generative frameworks. To address these\nchallenges, this paper presents UniGen, a comprehensive LLM-powered framework\ndesigned to produce diverse, accurate, and highly controllable datasets. UniGen\nis adaptable, supporting all types of text datasets and enhancing the\ngenerative process through innovative mechanisms. To augment data diversity,\nUniGen incorporates an attribute-guided generation module and a group checking\nfeature. For accuracy, it employs a code-based mathematical assessment for\nlabel verification alongside a retrieval-augmented generation technique for\nfactual validation. The framework also allows for user-specified constraints,\nenabling customization of the data generation process to suit particular\nrequirements.

Despite this,\nchallenges remain in the areas of generalization, controllability, diversity,\nand truthfulness within the existing generative frameworks. To address these\nchallenges, this paper presents UniGen, a comprehensive LLM-powered framework\ndesigned to produce diverse, accurate, and highly controllable datasets. UniGen\nis adaptable, supporting all types of text datasets and enhancing the\ngenerative process through innovative mechanisms. To augment data diversity,\nUniGen incorporates an attribute-guided generation module and a group checking\nfeature. For accuracy, it employs a code-based mathematical assessment for\nlabel verification alongside a retrieval-augmented generation technique for\nfactual validation. The framework also allows for user-specified constraints,\nenabling customization of the data generation process to suit particular\nrequirements.

Given that the LLM\napps are developed by third-parties and that anecdotal evidence suggests LLM\nplatforms currently do not strictly enforce their policies, user data shared\nwith arbitrary third-parties poses a significant privacy risk. In this paper we\naim to bring transparency in data practices of LLM apps. As a case study, we\nstudy OpenAI's GPT app ecosystem. We develop an LLM-based framework to conduct\nthe static analysis of natural language-based source code of GPTs and their\nActions (external services) to characterize their data collection practices.\nOur findings indicate that Actions collect expansive data about users,\nincluding sensitive information prohibited by OpenAI, such as passwords. We\nfind that some Actions, including related to advertising and analytics, are\nembedded in multiple GPTs, which allow them to track user activities across\nGPTs. Additionally, co-occurrence of Actions exposes as much as 9.5x more data\nto them, than it is exposed to individual Actions. Lastly, we develop an\nLLM-based privacy policy analysis framework to automatically check the\nconsistency of data collection by Actions with disclosures in their privacy\npolicies. Our measurements indicate that the disclosures for most of the\ncollected data types are omitted in privacy policies, with only 5.8% of Actions\nclearly disclosing their data collection practices.",

Given that the LLM\napps are developed by third-parties and that anecdotal evidence suggests LLM\nplatforms currently do not strictly enforce their policies, user data shared\nwith arbitrary third-parties poses a significant privacy risk. In this paper we\naim to bring transparency in data practices of LLM apps. As a case study, we\nstudy OpenAI's GPT app ecosystem. We develop an LLM-based framework to conduct\nthe static analysis of natural language-based source code of GPTs and their\nActions (external services) to characterize their data collection practices.\nOur findings indicate that Actions collect expansive data about users,\nincluding sensitive information prohibited by OpenAI, such as passwords. We\nfind that some Actions, including related to advertising and analytics, are\nembedded in multiple GPTs, which allow them to track user activities across\nGPTs. Additionally, co-occurrence of Actions exposes as much as 9.5x more data\nto them, than it is exposed to individual Actions. Lastly, we develop an\nLLM-based privacy policy analysis framework to automatically check the\nconsistency of data collection by Actions with disclosures in their privacy\npolicies. Our measurements indicate that the disclosures for most of the\ncollected data types are omitted in privacy policies, with only 5.8% of Actions\nclearly disclosing their data collection practices."

To address this challenge, this study proposes an innovative model,\nSpatial-to-Relational Transformation and Curriculum Q-Learning (S2RCQL).

While prior research has\ninvestigated the effect of information technology in general on human labor\nfrom a macro perspective, this paper complements the literature by examining\nthe impact of LLMs on freelancers from a micro perspective. Specifically, we\nleverage the release of ChatGPT to investigate how AI influences freelancers\nacross different online labor markets (OLMs). Employing the\nDifference-in-Differences method, we discovered two distinct scenarios\nfollowing ChatGPT's release: 1) the displacement effect of LLMs, featuring\nreduced work volume and earnings, as is exemplified by the translation &\nlocalization OLM; 2) the productivity effect of LLMs, featuring increased work\nvolume and earnings, as is exemplified by the web development OLM. To shed\nlight on the underlying mechanisms, we developed a Cournot-type competition\nmodel to highlight the existence of an inflection point for each occupation\nwhich separates the timeline of AI progress into a honeymoon phase and a\nsubstitution phase. Before AI performance crosses the inflection point, human\nlabor benefits each time AI improves, resulting in the honeymoon phase.\nHowever, after AI performance crosses the inflection point, additional AI\nenhancement hurts human labor. Further analyzing the progression from ChatGPT\n3.5 to 4.0, we found three effect scenarios (i.e., productivity to\nproductivity, displacement to displacement, and productivity to displacement),\nconsistent with the inflection point conjecture. Heterogeneous analyses reveal\nthat U.S. web developers tend to benefit more from the release of ChatGPT\ncompared to their counterparts in other regions, and somewhat surprisingly,\nexperienced translators seem more likely to exit the market than less\nexperienced translators after the release of ChatGPT.",

This research explores the deployment of a spiking recurrent neural\nnetwork (SRNN) with liquid time constant neurons for gesture recognition. We\nfocus on the energy efficiency and computational efficacy of NVIDIA Jetson Nano\nembedded GPU platforms.

Second, we develop an\nanalytical framework to address biases in multimodal input formatting for\nreal-world datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ICL examples where\nbaseline performance is poor, even when they are represented in unseen formats.\nLastly, we propose an on-the-fly approach for ICL (Anchored-by-Text ICL) that\ndemonstrates effectiveness in detecting hateful memes, a task where typical ICL\nstruggles due to resource limitations. Extensive experiments on multimodal\ndatasets reveal that our approach significantly improves ICL performance across\nvarious scenarios, such as challenging tasks and resource-constrained\nenvironments. Moreover, it provides valuable insights into the mechanisms of\nin-context learning in LLMs. Our findings have important implications for\ndeveloping more interpretable, efficient, and robust multimodal AI systems,\nespecially in challenging tasks and resource-constrained environments.",

                "summary": "The increasing demand for large-scale language models (LLMs) has highlighted\nthe importance of efficient data retrieval mechanisms. Neural graph databases\n(NGDBs) have emerged as a promising approach to storing and querying\ngraph-structured data in neural space, enabling the retrieval of relevant\ninformation for LLMs. However, existing NGDBs are typically designed to operate\non a single graph, limiting their ability to reason across multiple graphs.\nFurthermore, the lack of support for multi-source graph data in existing NGDBs\nhinders their ability to capture the complexity and diversity of real-world\ndata. In many applications, data is distributed across multiple sources, and\nthe ability to reason across these sources is crucial for making informed\ndecisions.

According to\nGartner's prediction, the use of AI technology for automated IT operations has\nbecome a new trend. Large language models (LLMs) that have exhibited remarkable\ncapabilities in NLP-related tasks, are showing great potential in the field of\nAIOps, such as in aspects of root cause analysis of failures, generation of\noperations and maintenance scripts, and summarizing of alert information.\nNevertheless, the performance of current LLMs in Ops tasks is yet to be\ndetermined. In this paper, we present OpsEval, a comprehensive task-oriented\nOps benchmark designed for LLMs. For the first time, OpsEval assesses LLMs'\nproficiency in various crucial scenarios at different ability levels. The\nbenchmark includes 7184 multi-choice questions and 1736 question-answering (QA)\nformats in English and Chinese. By conducting a comprehensive performance\nevaluation of the current leading large language models, we show how various\nLLM techniques can affect the performance of Ops, and discussed findings\nrelated to various topics, including model quantification, QA evaluation, and\nhallucination issues. To ensure the credibility of our evaluation, we invite\ndozens of domain experts to manually review our questions. At the same time, we\nhave open-sourced 20% of the test QA to assist current researchers in\npreliminary evaluations of their OpsLLM models. The remaining 80% of the data,\nwhich is not disclosed, is used to eliminate the issue of the test set leakage.\nAdditionally, we have constructed an online leaderboard that is updated in\nreal-time and will continue to be updated, ensuring that any newly emerging\nLLMs will be evaluated promptly.

Large language models (LLMs) that have exhibited remarkable\ncapabilities in NLP-related tasks, are showing great potential in the field of\nAIOps, such as in aspects of root cause analysis of failures, generation of\noperations and maintenance scripts, and summarizing of alert information.\nNevertheless, the performance of current LLMs in Ops tasks is yet to be\ndetermined. In this paper, we present OpsEval, a comprehensive task-oriented\nOps benchmark designed for LLMs. For the first time, OpsEval assesses LLMs'\nproficiency in various crucial scenarios at different ability levels. The\nbenchmark includes 7184 multi-choice questions and 1736 question-answering (QA)\nformats in English and Chinese. By conducting a comprehensive performance\nevaluation of the current leading large language models, we show how various\nLLM techniques can affect the performance of Ops, and discussed findings\nrelated to various topics, including model quantification, QA evaluation, and\nhallucination issues. To ensure the credibility of our evaluation, we invite\ndozens of domain experts to manually review our questions. At the same time, we\nhave open-sourced 20% of the test QA to assist current researchers in\npreliminary evaluations of their OpsLLM models. The remaining 80% of the data,\nwhich is not disclosed, is used to eliminate the issue of the test set leakage.\nAdditionally, we have constructed an online leaderboard that is updated in\nreal-time and will continue to be updated, ensuring that any newly emerging\nLLMs will be evaluated promptly. Both our dataset and leaderboard have been\nmade public."

This approach offers real-time insights\ninto individuals' physical and mental states, creating opportunities for\npersonalised treatment and interventions. However, the potential of analysing\nthe textual content viewed on smartphones to predict affective states remains\nunderexplored. To better understand how the screen text that users are exposed\nto and interact with can influence their affects, we investigated a subset of\ndata obtained from a digital phenotyping study of Australian university\nstudents conducted in 2023. We employed linear regression, zero-shot, and\nmulti-shot prompting using a large language model (LLM) to analyse\nrelationships between screen text and affective states.

This approach offers real-time insights\ninto individuals' physical and mental states, creating opportunities for\npersonalised treatment and interventions. However, the potential of analysing\nthe textual content viewed on smartphones to predict affective states remains\nunderexplored. To better understand how the screen text that users are exposed\nto and interact with can influence their affects, we investigated a subset of\ndata obtained from a digital phenotyping study of Australian university\nstudents conducted in 2023. We employed linear regression, zero-shot, and\nmulti-shot prompting using a large language model (LLM) to analyse\nrelationships between screen text and affective states. Our findings indicate\nthat multi-shot prompting substantially outperforms both linear regression and\nzero-shot prompting, highlighting the importance of context in affect\nprediction.

Our agent\nconstructs a flexible action space that enhances adaptability across various\napplications including parser, text and vision descriptions. The agent operates\nthrough two main phases: exploration and deployment. During the exploration\nphase, functionalities of user interface elements are documented either through\nagent-driven or manual explorations into a customized structured knowledge\nbase. In the deployment phase, RAG technology enables efficient retrieval and\nupdate from this knowledge base, thereby empowering the agent to perform tasks\neffectively and accurately. This includes performing complex, multi-step\noperations across various applications, thereby demonstrating the framework's\nadaptability and precision in handling customized task workflows. Our\nexperimental results across various benchmarks demonstrate the framework's\nsuperior performance, confirming its effectiveness in real-world scenarios. Our\ncode will be open source soon."

However, creating commentary is a\ntime-consuming task, even for skilled commentators.

These requirements can be categorized into two levels: 1)\nfundamental requirements, which include creating well-structured and logically\nconsistent narratives, and 2) advanced requirements, which involve generating\nquality arguments and providing convincing evidence. In this paper, we\nintroduce Xinyu, an efficient LLM-based system designed to assist commentators\nin generating Chinese commentaries. To meet the fundamental requirements, we\ndeconstruct the generation process into sequential steps, proposing targeted\nstrategies and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for each step. To address the\nadvanced requirements, we present an argument ranking model for arguments and\nestablish a comprehensive evidence database that includes up-to-date events and\nclassic books, thereby strengthening the substantiation of the evidence with\nretrieval augmented generation (RAG) technology. To evaluate the generated\ncommentaries more fairly, corresponding to the two-level requirements, we\nintroduce a comprehensive evaluation metric that considers five distinct\nperspectives in commentary generation. Our experiments confirm the\neffectiveness of our proposed system.

This creates a realistic test-bed for detecting and\nverbalizing these fallacies under real-world input conditions, and enables\nnovel passage-retrieval tasks. MissciPlus is the first logical fallacy dataset\nwhich pairs the real-world misrepresented evidence with incorrect claims,\nidentical to the input to evidence-based fact-checking models. With MissciPlus,\nwe i) benchmark retrieval models in identifying passages that support claims\nonly when fallacies are applied, ii) evaluate how well LLMs articulate\nfallacious reasoning from misrepresented scientific passages, and iii) assess\nthe effectiveness of fact-checking models in refuting claims that misrepresent\nbiomedical research. Our findings show that current fact-checking models\nstruggle to use relevant passages from misrepresented publications to refute\nmisinformation. Moreover, these passages can mislead LLMs into accepting false\nclaims as true.",

This creates a realistic test-bed for detecting and\nverbalizing these fallacies under real-world input conditions, and enables\nnovel passage-retrieval tasks. MissciPlus is the first logical fallacy dataset\nwhich pairs the real-world misrepresented evidence with incorrect claims,\nidentical to the input to evidence-based fact-checking models. With MissciPlus,\nwe i) benchmark retrieval models in identifying passages that support claims\nonly when fallacies are applied, ii) evaluate how well LLMs articulate\nfallacious reasoning from misrepresented scientific passages, and iii) assess\nthe effectiveness of fact-checking models in refuting claims that misrepresent\nbiomedical research. Our findings show that current fact-checking models\nstruggle to use relevant passages from misrepresented publications to refute\nmisinformation. Moreover, these passages can mislead LLMs into accepting false\nclaims as true."

However, their practical application is constrained by substantial\nmemory and computational demands. Post-training quantization (PTQ) is\nconsidered an effective method to accelerate LLM inference. Despite its growing\npopularity in LLM model compression, PTQ deployment faces two major challenges.\nFirst, low-bit quantization leads to performance degradation. Second,\nrestricted by the limited integer computing unit type on GPUs, quantized matrix\noperations with different precisions cannot be effectively accelerated. To\naddress these issues, we introduce a novel arbitrary-bit quantization algorithm\nand inference framework, ABQ-LLM. It achieves superior performance across\nvarious quantization settings and enables efficient arbitrary-precision\nquantized inference on the GPU. ABQ-LLM introduces several key innovations: (1)\na distribution correction method for transformer blocks to mitigate\ndistribution differences caused by full quantization of weights and\nactivations, improving performance at low bit-widths. (2) the bit balance\nstrategy to counteract performance degradation from asymmetric distribution\nissues at very low bit-widths (e.g., 2-bit). (3) an innovative quantization\nacceleration framework that reconstructs the quantization matrix multiplication\nof arbitrary precision combinations based on BTC (Binary TensorCore)\nequivalents, gets rid of the limitations of INT4/INT8 computing units. ABQ-LLM\ncan convert each component bit width gain into actual acceleration gain,\nmaximizing performance under mixed precision(e.g., W6A6, W2A8). Based on W2*A8\nquantization configuration on LLaMA-7B model, it achieved a WikiText2\nperplexity of 7.59 (2.17$\\downarrow $ vs 9.76 in AffineQuant).

However, LLMs cannot separate user inputs from context,\nenabling context injection. This paper introduces a methodology to\nsystematically inject misleading context (i.e., chat history) into LLM\nconversations without prior knowledge of the target model. We formalize context\ninjection through a response retrieval task and propose an LLM-Guided Genetic\nAlgorithm (LLMGA) to create effective injection prompts, leading the target LLM\nto recognize injected context as genuine. We explore how context injection can\nbe used to elicit disallowed content, posing risks of illegal actions and\ninappropriate responses. Our elicitation strategies, including acceptance\nelicitation and word anonymization, can effectively elicit disallowed responses\nwith success rates reaching 97% on ChatGPT. Comprehensive evaluations on\nreal-world LLMs including ChatGPT and Llama-2/3 demonstrate the efficacy of\nLLMGA and our injection strategies.

Therefore, we address three related\nresearch questions in this work. First, we explore the optimal strength of the\nKL divergence constraint in DPO, which penalizes deviations from the reference\npolicy, and find that DPO is sensitive to this strength. Next, we examine the\nnecessity of the KL-constraint from the reference policies in DPO by providing\nboth theoretical and empirical comparisons between DPO and related learning\nobjectives, demonstrating DPO's superiority in this controlled setting.\nAdditionally, we investigate whether DPO benefits from stronger reference\npolicies, finding that a stronger reference policy can lead to improved\nperformance, but only when it is similar to the model being fine-tuned.

To this end, we introduce the RuleAlign\nframework, designed to align LLMs with specific diagnostic rules. We develop a\nmedical dialogue dataset comprising rule-based communications between patients\nand physicians and design an alignment learning approach through preference\nlearning. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed\napproach. We hope that our work can serve as an inspiration for exploring the\npotential of LLMs as AI physicians."

Supervised methods are adept at\ntext categorization, yet the dynamic nature of social media discussions poses a\ncontinual challenge for these techniques due to the constant shifting of the\nfocus. On the other hand, traditional unsupervised methods for extracting\nthemes from public discourse, such as topic modeling, often reveal overarching\npatterns that might not capture specific nuances. Consequently, a significant\nportion of research into social media discourse still depends on\nlabor-intensive manual coding techniques and a human-in-the-loop approach,\nwhich are both time-consuming and costly. In this work, we study the problem of\ndiscovering arguments associated with a specific theme. We propose a generic\nLLMs-in-the-Loop strategy that leverages the advanced capabilities of Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) to extract latent arguments from social media messaging.\nTo demonstrate our approach, we apply our framework to contentious topics. We\nuse two publicly available datasets: (1) the climate campaigns dataset of 14k\nFacebook ads with 25 themes and (2) the COVID-19 vaccine campaigns dataset of\n9k Facebook ads with 14 themes. Additionally, we design a downstream task as\nstance prediction by leveraging talking points in climate debates. Furthermore,\nwe analyze demographic targeting and the adaptation of messaging based on\nreal-world events.",

On the other hand, traditional unsupervised methods for extracting\nthemes from public discourse, such as topic modeling, often reveal overarching\npatterns that might not capture specific nuances. Consequently, a significant\nportion of research into social media discourse still depends on\nlabor-intensive manual coding techniques and a human-in-the-loop approach,\nwhich are both time-consuming and costly. In this work, we study the problem of\ndiscovering arguments associated with a specific theme. We propose a generic\nLLMs-in-the-Loop strategy that leverages the advanced capabilities of Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) to extract latent arguments from social media messaging.\nTo demonstrate our approach, we apply our framework to contentious topics. We\nuse two publicly available datasets: (1) the climate campaigns dataset of 14k\nFacebook ads with 25 themes and (2) the COVID-19 vaccine campaigns dataset of\n9k Facebook ads with 14 themes. Additionally, we design a downstream task as\nstance prediction by leveraging talking points in climate debates. Furthermore,\nwe analyze demographic targeting and the adaptation of messaging based on\nreal-world events."

                "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable capabilities in\nnatural language generation, but they have also been observed to magnify\nsocietal biases, particularly those related to gender. In response to this\nissue, several benchmarks have been proposed to assess gender bias in LLMs.\nHowever, these benchmarks often lack practical flexibility or inadvertently\nintroduce biases. To address these shortcomings, we introduce GenderCARE, a\ncomprehensive framework that encompasses innovative Criteria, bias Assessment,\nReduction techniques, and Evaluation metrics for quantifying and mitigating\ngender bias in LLMs. To begin, we establish pioneering criteria for gender\nequality benchmarks, spanning dimensions such as inclusivity, diversity,\nexplainability, objectivity, robustness, and realisticity. Guided by these\ncriteria, we construct GenderPair, a novel pair-based benchmark designed to\nassess gender bias in LLMs comprehensively. Our benchmark provides standardized\nand realistic evaluations, including previously overlooked gender groups such\nas transgender and non-binary individuals. Furthermore, we develop effective\ndebiasing techniques that incorporate counterfactual data augmentation and\nspecialized fine-tuning strategies to reduce gender bias in LLMs without\ncompromising their overall performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate a\nsignificant reduction in various gender bias benchmarks, with reductions\npeaking at over 90% and averaging above 35% across 17 different LLMs.\nImportantly, these reductions come with minimal variability in mainstream\nlanguage tasks, remaining below 2%. By offering a realistic assessment and\ntailored reduction of gender biases, we hope that our GenderCARE can represent\na significant step towards achieving fairness and equity in LLMs. More details\nare available at https://github.com/kstanghere/GenderCARE-ccs24.",
