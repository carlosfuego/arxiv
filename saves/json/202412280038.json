HashEvict quickly locates tokens in the cache\nthat are cosine dissimilar to the current query token.

We maintain a lightweight binary\nstructure in GPU memory to facilitate these calculations. Unlike existing\ncompression strategies that compute attention to determine token retention,\nHashEvict makes these decisions pre-attention, thereby reducing computational\ncosts. Additionally, HashEvict is dynamic - at every decoding step, the key and\nvalue of the current token replace the embeddings of a token expected to\nproduce the lowest attention score. We demonstrate that HashEvict can compress\nthe KV cache by 30%-70% while maintaining high performance across reasoning,\nmultiple-choice, long-context retrieval and summarization tasks.",

However, current FSDMC research often\nlacks generalizability due to its focus on specific datasets. Additionally,\ndefect classification heavily relies on contextual information within images,\nand existing methods fall short of effectively extracting this information. To\naddress these challenges, we propose a general FSDMC framework called MVREC,\nwhich offers two primary advantages: (1) MVREC extracts general features for\ndefect instances by incorporating the pre-trained AlphaCLIP model. (2) It\nutilizes a region-context framework to enhance defect features by leveraging\nmask region input and multi-view context augmentation. Furthermore, Few-shot\nZip-Adapter(-F) classifiers within the model are introduced to cache the visual\nfeatures of the support set and perform few-shot classification. We also\nintroduce MVTec-FS, a new FSDMC benchmark based on MVTec AD, which includes\n1228 defect images with instance-level mask annotations and 46 defect types.\nExtensive experiments conducted on MVTec-FS and four additional datasets\ndemonstrate its effectiveness in general defect classification and its ability\nto incorporate contextual information to improve classification performance.\nCode: https://github.com/ShuaiLYU/MVREC",

It achieves exceptional performance, ranking 6th overall\non Chatbot Arena, with particularly strong results (2nd to 4th place) in\nspecialized categories including Chinese, Math, Coding, and Hard Prompts.\nYi-Lightning leverages an enhanced Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture,\nfeaturing advanced expert segmentation and routing mechanisms coupled with\noptimized KV-caching techniques. Our development process encompasses\ncomprehensive pre-training, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and reinforcement\nlearning from human feedback (RLHF), where we devise deliberate strategies for\nmulti-stage training, synthetic data construction, and reward modeling.\nFurthermore, we implement RAISE (Responsible AI Safety Engine), a\nfour-component framework to address safety issues across pre-training,\npost-training, and serving phases. Empowered by our scalable super-computing\ninfrastructure, all these innovations substantially reduce training, deployment\nand inference costs while maintaining high-performance standards. With further\nevaluations on public academic benchmarks, Yi-Lightning demonstrates\ncompetitive performance against top-tier LLMs, while we observe a notable\ndisparity between traditional, static benchmark results and real-world, dynamic\nhuman preferences. This observation prompts a critical reassessment of\nconventional benchmarks' utility in guiding the development of more intelligent\nand powerful AI systems for practical applications.

With\nthe advent of large language models (LLMs) featuring significantly extended\ncontext windows, this paper proposes an alternative paradigm, cache-augmented\ngeneration (CAG) that bypasses real-time retrieval. Our method involves\npreloading all relevant resources, especially when the documents or knowledge\nfor retrieval are of a limited and manageable size, into the LLM's extended\ncontext and caching its runtime parameters. During inference, the model\nutilizes these preloaded parameters to answer queries without additional\nretrieval steps. Comparative analyses reveal that CAG eliminates retrieval\nlatency and minimizes retrieval errors while maintaining context relevance.\nPerformance evaluations across multiple benchmarks highlight scenarios where\nlong-context LLMs either outperform or complement traditional RAG pipelines.\nThese findings suggest that, for certain applications, particularly those with\na constrained knowledge base, CAG provide a streamlined and efficient\nalternative to RAG, achieving comparable or superior results with reduced\ncomplexity.",

With\nthe advent of large language models (LLMs) featuring significantly extended\ncontext windows, this paper proposes an alternative paradigm, cache-augmented\ngeneration (CAG) that bypasses real-time retrieval. Our method involves\npreloading all relevant resources, especially when the documents or knowledge\nfor retrieval are of a limited and manageable size, into the LLM's extended\ncontext and caching its runtime parameters. During inference, the model\nutilizes these preloaded parameters to answer queries without additional\nretrieval steps. Comparative analyses reveal that CAG eliminates retrieval\nlatency and minimizes retrieval errors while maintaining context relevance.\nPerformance evaluations across multiple benchmarks highlight scenarios where\nlong-context LLMs either outperform or complement traditional RAG pipelines.\nThese findings suggest that, for certain applications, particularly those with\na constrained knowledge base, CAG provide a streamlined and efficient\nalternative to RAG, achieving comparable or superior results with reduced\ncomplexity."

The design of Nemesis is inspired by Rache\n(SIGMOD'23), which introduced a caching mechanism for encrypted integers and\nscalars. Nemesis extends this idea with more advanced caching techniques and\nmathematical tools, enabling efficient operations over multi-slot FHE schemes\nand overcoming Rache's limitations to support general plaintext structures. We\nformally prove the security of Nemesis under standard cryptographic assumptions\nand evaluate its performance extensively on widely used datasets, including\nMNIST, FashionMNIST, and CIFAR-10. Experimental results show that Nemesis\nsignificantly reduces the computational overhead of FHE-based ML systems,\npaving the way for broader adoption of privacy-preserving technologies."

                "summary": "The efficiency of large vision-language models (LVLMs) is constrained by the\ncomputational bottleneck of the attention mechanism during the prefill phase\nand the memory bottleneck of fetching the key-value (KV) cache in the decoding\nphase, particularly in scenarios involving high-resolution images or videos.\nVisual content often exhibits substantial redundancy, resulting in highly\nsparse attention maps within LVLMs. This sparsity can be leveraged to\naccelerate attention computation or compress the KV cache through various\napproaches. However, most studies focus on addressing only one of these\nbottlenecks and do not adequately support dynamic adjustment of sparsity\nconcerning distinct layers or tasks. In this paper, we present ZipVL, an\nefficient inference framework designed for LVLMs through a dynamic ratio\nallocation strategy of important tokens. This ratio is adaptively determined\nbased on the layer-specific distribution of attention scores, rather than fixed\nhyper-parameters, thereby improving efficiency for less complex tasks while\nmaintaining high performance for more challenging ones.

                    "value": "The efficiency of large vision-language models (LVLMs) is constrained by the\ncomputational bottleneck of the attention mechanism during the prefill phase\nand the memory bottleneck of fetching the key-value (KV) cache in the decoding\nphase, particularly in scenarios involving high-resolution images or videos.\nVisual content often exhibits substantial redundancy, resulting in highly\nsparse attention maps within LVLMs. This sparsity can be leveraged to\naccelerate attention computation or compress the KV cache through various\napproaches. However, most studies focus on addressing only one of these\nbottlenecks and do not adequately support dynamic adjustment of sparsity\nconcerning distinct layers or tasks. In this paper, we present ZipVL, an\nefficient inference framework designed for LVLMs through a dynamic ratio\nallocation strategy of important tokens. This ratio is adaptively determined\nbased on the layer-specific distribution of attention scores, rather than fixed\nhyper-parameters, thereby improving efficiency for less complex tasks while\nmaintaining high performance for more challenging ones. Then we select\nimportant tokens based on their normalized attention scores and perform sparse\nattention mechanism solely on those important tokens, reducing the latency in\nthe prefill phase. Tokens deemed less important will be discarded to reduce KV\ncache size, alleviating the memory bottleneck in the decoding phase.

The dynamic arrival and departure of connection requests in\noptical networks result in particular central links experiencing more traffic\nand congestion than non-central links. The occurrence of congested links leads\nto service blocking despite the availability of resources within the network,\nrestricting the efficient utilization of network resources. The available\nalgorithms in the literature that aim to balance load among network links offer\na trade-off between blocking performance and algorithmic complexity, thus\nincreasing service provisioning time. This work proposes a dynamic\nrouting-based congestion-aware routing, modulation, core, and spectrum\nassignment (RMCSA) algorithm for space division multiplexing elastic optical\nnetworks (SDM-EONs). The algorithm finds alternative candidate paths based on\nreal-time link occupancy metrics to minimize blocking due to link congestion\nunder dynamic traffic scenarios. As a result, the algorithm reduces the\nformation of congestion hotspots in the network owing to link-betweenness\ncentrality. We have performed extensive simulations using two realistic network\ntopologies to compare the performance of the proposed algorithm with relevant\nRMCSA algorithms available in the literature. The simulation results verify the\nsuperior performance of our proposed algorithm compared to the benchmark Yen's\nK-shortest paths and K-Disjoint shortest paths RMCSA algorithms in connection\nblocking ratio and spectrum utilization efficiency. To expedite the\nroute-finding process, we present a novel caching strategy that allows the\nproposed algorithm to demonstrate a much-reduced service delay time compared to\nthe recently developed adaptive link weight-based load-balancing RMCSA\nalgorithm.",

DeepSeek-VL2 achieves competitive or state-of-the-art\nperformance with similar or fewer activated parameters compared to existing\nopen-source dense and MoE-based models. Codes and pre-trained models are\npublicly accessible at https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-VL2."

                "summary": "Despite the efficiency of prompt learning in transferring vision-language\nmodels (VLMs) to downstream tasks, existing methods mainly learn the prompts in\na coarse-grained manner where the learned prompt vectors are shared across all\ncategories. Consequently, the tailored prompts often fail to discern\nclass-specific visual concepts, thereby hindering the transferred performance\nfor classes that share similar or complex visual attributes. Recent advances\nmitigate this challenge by leveraging external knowledge from Large Language\nModels (LLMs) to furnish class descriptions, yet incurring notable inference\ncosts. In this paper, we introduce TextRefiner, a plug-and-play method to\nrefine the text prompts of existing methods by leveraging the internal\nknowledge of VLMs. Particularly, TextRefiner builds a novel local cache module\nto encapsulate fine-grained visual concepts derivedfrom local tokens within the\nimage branch.

                    "value": "Despite the efficiency of prompt learning in transferring vision-language\nmodels (VLMs) to downstream tasks, existing methods mainly learn the prompts in\na coarse-grained manner where the learned prompt vectors are shared across all\ncategories. Consequently, the tailored prompts often fail to discern\nclass-specific visual concepts, thereby hindering the transferred performance\nfor classes that share similar or complex visual attributes. Recent advances\nmitigate this challenge by leveraging external knowledge from Large Language\nModels (LLMs) to furnish class descriptions, yet incurring notable inference\ncosts. In this paper, we introduce TextRefiner, a plug-and-play method to\nrefine the text prompts of existing methods by leveraging the internal\nknowledge of VLMs. Particularly, TextRefiner builds a novel local cache module\nto encapsulate fine-grained visual concepts derivedfrom local tokens within the\nimage branch. By aggregating and aligning the cached visual descriptions with\nthe original output of the text branch, TextRefiner can efficiently refine and\nenrich the learned prompts from existing methods without relying on any\nexternal expertise.

ACDiT is easy to\nimplement, as simple as creating a Skip-Causal Attention Mask (SCAM) during\ntraining. During inference, the process iterates between diffusion denoising\nand autoregressive decoding that can make full use of KV-Cache. We verify the\neffectiveness of ACDiT on image and video generation tasks. We also demonstrate\nthat benefitted from autoregressive modeling, ACDiT can be seamlessly used in\nvisual understanding tasks despite being trained on the diffusion objective.\nThe analysis of the trade-off between autoregressive modeling and diffusion\ndemonstrates the potential of ACDiT to be used in long-horizon visual\ngeneration tasks. These strengths make it promising as the backbone of future\nunified models."

                "summary": "Recently, large vision-language models (LVLMs) have rapidly gained popularity\nfor their strong generation and reasoning capabilities given diverse multimodal\ninputs. However, these models incur significant computational and memory\noverhead during inference, which greatly hinders the efficient deployment in\npractical scenarios. The extensive key-value (KV) cache, necessitated by the\nlengthy input and output sequences, notably contributes to the high inference\ncost. Based on this, recent works have investigated ways to reduce the KV cache\nsize for higher efficiency. Although effective, they generally overlook the\ndistinct importance distributions of KV vectors across layers and maintain the\nsame cache size for each layer during the next token prediction. This results\nin the significant contextual information loss for certain layers, leading to\nnotable performance decline. To address this, we present PrefixKV. It reframes\nthe challenge of determining KV cache sizes for all layers into the task of\nsearching for the optimal global prefix configuration.

                    "value": "Recently, large vision-language models (LVLMs) have rapidly gained popularity\nfor their strong generation and reasoning capabilities given diverse multimodal\ninputs. However, these models incur significant computational and memory\noverhead during inference, which greatly hinders the efficient deployment in\npractical scenarios. The extensive key-value (KV) cache, necessitated by the\nlengthy input and output sequences, notably contributes to the high inference\ncost. Based on this, recent works have investigated ways to reduce the KV cache\nsize for higher efficiency. Although effective, they generally overlook the\ndistinct importance distributions of KV vectors across layers and maintain the\nsame cache size for each layer during the next token prediction. This results\nin the significant contextual information loss for certain layers, leading to\nnotable performance decline. To address this, we present PrefixKV. It reframes\nthe challenge of determining KV cache sizes for all layers into the task of\nsearching for the optimal global prefix configuration. With an adaptive\nlayer-wise KV retention recipe based on binary search, the maximum contextual\ninformation can thus be preserved in each layer, facilitating the generation.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves the state-of-the-art\nperformance compared with others.

In SM-SoCs, system-wide shared physical\nmemory enables a convenient and financially-feasible way to make data\naccessible by dozens of processing units (PUs), such as CPU cores and domain\nspecific accelerators. In this study, we investigate vulnerabilities that stem\nfrom the shared use of physical memory in such systems.

While the literature proposes covert\nchannel attacks for shared memory systems, high-throughput communication is\ncurrently possible by either relying on an LLC or privileged/physical access to\nthe shared memory subsystem.\n  In this study, we introduce a new memory-contention based covert\ncommunication attack, MC3, which specifically targets the shared system memory\nin mobile SoCs. Different from existing attacks, our approach achieves high\nthroughput communication between applications running on CPU and GPU without\nthe need for an LLC or elevated access to the system. We extensively explore\nthe effectiveness of our methodology by demonstrating the trade-off between the\nchannel transmission rate and the robustness of the communication.

We propose Ltri-LLM\nframework, which divides KVs into spans, stores them in an offline index, and\nretrieves the relevant KVs into memory for various queries. Experimental\nresults on popular long text benchmarks show that Ltri-LLM can achieve\nperformance close to FA while maintaining efficient, streaming-based inference."

Its cache entry identifies\na unique one-hop sub-query (key) and its result set consisting of immutable\nvertex ids (value). When processing a gR-Tx, the query processor identifies its\nsequence of individual one-hop sub-queries and looks up their results in the\ncache.

To address this, two critical steps are often required: a\npretrained LLM typically undergoes a separate stage for context length\nextension by training on long-context data, followed by architectural\nmodifications to reduce the overhead of KV cache during serving. This paper\nargues that integrating length extension with a GPU-friendly KV cache reduction\narchitecture not only reduces training overhead during length extension, but\nalso achieves better long-context performance. This leads to our proposed\nLongGen, which finetunes a pretrained LLM into an efficient architecture during\nlength extension. LongGen builds on three key insights: (1) Sparse attention\npatterns, such as window attention (attending to recent tokens), attention sink\n(initial ones), and blockwise sparse attention (strided token blocks) are\nwell-suited for building efficient long-context models, primarily due to their\nGPU-friendly memory access patterns, enabling efficiency gains not just\ntheoretically but in practice as well. (2) It is essential for the model to\nhave direct access to all tokens. A hybrid architecture with 1/3 full attention\nlayers and 2/3 efficient ones achieves a balanced trade-off between efficiency\nand long-context performance. (3) Lightweight training on 5B long-context data\nis sufficient to extend the hybrid model's context length from 4K to 128K.\n  We evaluate LongGen on both Llama-2 7B and Llama-2 70B, demonstrating its\neffectiveness across different scales. During training with 128K-long contexts,\nLongGen achieves 1.55x training speedup and reduces wall-clock time by 36%,\ncompared to a full-attention baseline.

We\nfind that modern key-value designs are either optimized for memory-efficiency,\nsacrificing high-performance (LSM-tree designs), or achieve high-performance,\nsaturating modern NVMe SSD bandwidth, at the cost of substantial memory\nresources or high disk wear (CPU-optimized designs).

We introduce LatentCRF, a continuous Conditional\nRandom Field (CRF) model, implemented as a neural network layer, that models\nthe spatial and semantic relationships among the latent vectors in the LDM. By\nreplacing some of the computationally-intensive LDM inference iterations with\nour lightweight LatentCRF, we achieve a superior balance between quality, speed\nand diversity. We increase inference efficiency by 33% with no loss in image\nquality or diversity compared to the full LDM. LatentCRF is an easy add-on,\nwhich does not require modifying the LDM."

Existing tools for generating obfuscated code often require access\nto the original source code (e.g., C++ or Java), and adding new obfuscations is\na non-trivial, labor-intensive process.

If so, this poses a risk to anti-virus engines and\npotentially increases the flexibility of attackers to create new obfuscation\npatterns. We answer this in the affirmative by developing the MetamorphASM\nbenchmark comprising MetamorphASM Dataset (MAD) along with three code\nobfuscation techniques: dead code, register substitution, and control flow\nchange. The MetamorphASM systematically evaluates the ability of LLMs to\ngenerate and analyze obfuscated code using MAD, which contains 328,200\nobfuscated assembly code samples.

Recent studies demonstrate that large\nlanguage models (LLMs) possess exceptional sentiment understanding\ncapabilities.

Therefore, this paper investigates the distillation of\nfine-grained sentiment understanding from LLMs into small language models\n(SLMs). We prompt LLMs to examine and interpret the sentiments of given reviews\nand then utilize the generated content to pretrain SLMs. Additionally, we\ndevelop a comprehensive FSA benchmark to evaluate both SLMs and LLMs. Extensive\nexperiments on this benchmark reveal that: (1) distillation significantly\nenhances the performance of SLMs in FSA tasks, achieving a 6.00\\% improvement\nin $F_1$-score, and the distilled model can outperform Llama-2-7b with only\n220M parameters; (2) distillation equips SLMs with excellent zero-shot\nsentiment classification capabilities, enabling them to match or even exceed\ntheir teacher models. These results suggest that distillation from LLMs is a\nhighly promising direction for FSA.

In this study, we propose a novel large language model\n(LLM) guided deep reinforcement learning (LGDRL) framework for addressing the\ndecision-making problem of autonomous vehicles. Within this framework, an\nLLM-based driving expert is integrated into the DRL to provide intelligent\nguidance for the learning process of DRL.

Experimental results demonstrate that our\nmethod not only achieves superior driving performance with a 90\\% task success\nrate but also significantly improves the learning efficiency and expert\nguidance utilization efficiency compared to state-of-the-art baseline\nalgorithms.

We will release our code and demos on\nthe project page: https://sites.google.com/view/mr-steve."

Common KGC tasks are mostly\nabout inferring unknown elements with one or two elements being known in a\ntriple. In comparison, the Triple Set Prediction (TSP) task is a more realistic\nknowledge graph completion task. It aims to predict all elements of unknown\ntriples based on the information from known triples. In recent years, large\nlanguage models (LLMs) have exhibited significant advancements in language\ncomprehension, demonstrating considerable potential for KGC tasks. However, the\npotential of LLM on the TSP task has not yet to be investigated. Thus in this\npaper we proposed a new framework to explore the strengths and limitations of\nLLM in the TSP task. Specifically, the framework consists of LLM-based rule\nmining and LLM-based triple set prediction. The relation list of KG embedded\nwithin rich semantic information is first leveraged to prompt LLM in the\ngeneration of rules. This process is both efficient and independent of\nstatistical information, making it easier to mine effective and realistic\nrules. For each subgraph, the specified rule is applied in conjunction with the\nrelevant triples within that subgraph to guide the LLM in predicting the\nmissing triples. Subsequently, the predictions from all subgraphs are\nconsolidated to derive the complete set of predicted triples on KG. Finally,\nthe method is evaluated on the relatively complete CFamily dataset. The\nexperimental results indicate that when LLMs are required to adhere to a large\namount of factual knowledge to predict missing triples, significant\nhallucinations occurs, leading to a noticeable decline in performance.

Each conversation contains\ncomprehensive multimodal interactions, rich elements, and natural dialogues.\nData in Muse are automatically synthesized by a multi-agent framework powered\nby multimodal large language models (MLLMs). It innovatively derives user\nprofiles from real-world scenarios rather than depending on manual design and\nhistory data for better scalability, and then it fulfills conversation\nsimulation and optimization. Both human and LLM evaluations demonstrate the\nhigh quality of conversations in Muse. Additionally, fine-tuning experiments on\nthree MLLMs demonstrate Muse's learnable patterns for recommendations and\nresponses, confirming its value for multimodal conversational recommendation.\nOur dataset and codes are available at\n\\url{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Muse-0086}.",

In this paper, we introduce a novel\ngenerative framework, the Recurrent Diffusion Probabilistic Model (RDPM), which\nenhances the diffusion process through a recurrent token prediction mechanism,\nthereby pioneering the field of Discrete Diffusion. By progressively\nintroducing Gaussian noise into the latent representations of images and\nencoding them into vector-quantized tokens in a recurrent manner, RDPM\nfacilitates a unique diffusion process on discrete-value domains.

RDPM demonstrates superior\nperformance while benefiting from the speed advantage of requiring only a few\ninference steps. This model not only leverages the diffusion process to ensure\nhigh-quality generation but also converts continuous signals into a series of\nhigh-fidelity discrete tokens, thereby maintaining a unified optimization\nstrategy with other discrete tokens, such as text.

However, discrepancies between developer-implemented logic and the\ndynamically generated content of LLMs in terms of behavior and expected\noutcomes can lead to defects, such as tool invocation failures and task\nexecution errors. These issues introduce specific risks, leading to various\ndefects in LLM-based AI Agents, such as service interruptions.

In this paper,\nwe present the first study focused on identifying and detecting defects in LLM\nAgents. We collected and analyzed 6,854 relevant posts from StackOverflow to\ndefine 8 types of agent defects. For each type, we provided detailed\ndescriptions with an example.

However existing methods still\nhave challenges: the inability to use external tools autonomously, and the\ninability to work in teams. Humans tend to know whether they need to use\nexternal tools when they encounter a new question, e.g., they tend to be able\nto give a direct answer to a familiar question, whereas they tend to use tools\nsuch as search engines when they encounter an unfamiliar question. In addition,\nhumans also tend to collaborate and discuss with others to get better answers.\nInspired by this, we propose the multi-agent voting framework. We design three\nLLM-based agents that simulate different levels of staff in a team, and assign\nthe available tools according to the levels. Each agent provides the\ncorresponding answer, and finally all the answers provided by the agents are\nvoted to get the final answer.

However existing methods still\nhave challenges: the inability to use external tools autonomously, and the\ninability to work in teams. Humans tend to know whether they need to use\nexternal tools when they encounter a new question, e.g., they tend to be able\nto give a direct answer to a familiar question, whereas they tend to use tools\nsuch as search engines when they encounter an unfamiliar question. In addition,\nhumans also tend to collaborate and discuss with others to get better answers.\nInspired by this, we propose the multi-agent voting framework. We design three\nLLM-based agents that simulate different levels of staff in a team, and assign\nthe available tools according to the levels. Each agent provides the\ncorresponding answer, and finally all the answers provided by the agents are\nvoted to get the final answer. Experiments on OK-VQA and A-OKVQA show that our\napproach outperforms other baselines by 2.2 and 1.0, respectively."

For each image, intensity\nvalues were manually clipped to the emphysema window setting and a baseline\n'full-range' window setting. Class-balanced train, validation, and test sets\ncontained 3,392, 1,114, and 2,688 images. The network backbone was optimized by\ncomparing various CNN architectures. Furthermore, automated WSO was implemented\nby adding a customized layer to the model. The image-level area under the\nReceiver Operating Characteristics curve (AUC) [lower, upper limit 95%\nconfidence] was utilized to compare model variations. Repeated inference (n=7)\non the test set showed that the DenseNet was the most efficient backbone and\nachieved a mean AUC of 0.80 [0.76, 0.85] without WSO.

                "summary": "Reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a crucial ability,\nespecially in complex decision-making tasks. One significant task to show LLMs'\nreasoning capability is code time complexity prediction, which involves various\nintricate factors such as the input range of variables and conditional loops.\nCurrent benchmarks fall short of providing a rigorous assessment due to limited\ndata, language constraints, and insufficient labeling. They do not consider\ntime complexity based on input representation and merely evaluate whether\npredictions fall into the same class, lacking a measure of how close incorrect\npredictions are to the correct ones.

We frame human preference alignment as online reinforcement learning\nusing human feedback (RLHF), where the goal is to maximize the reward function\nwhile regularizing the generator distribution to remain close to a reference\ndiffusion process. Unlike traditional RLHF approaches, which rely on the KL\ndivergence for regularization, we introduce a novel score-based divergence\nregularization, which leads to significantly better performances. Although the\ndirect calculation of this preference alignment objective remains intractable,\nwe demonstrate that we can efficiently compute its gradient by deriving an\nequivalent yet tractable loss function. Remarkably, we used Diff-Instruct* to\ntrain a Stable Diffusion-XL-based 1-step model, the 2.6B DI*-SDXL-1step\ntext-to-image model, which can generate images of a resolution of 1024x1024\nwith only 1 generation step. DI*-SDXL-1step model uses only 1.88% inference\ntime and 29.30% GPU memory cost to outperform 12B FLUX-dev-50step significantly\nin PickScore, ImageReward, and CLIPScore on Parti prompt benchmark and HPSv2.1\non Human Preference Score benchmark, establishing a new state-of-the-art\nbenchmark of human-preferred 1-step text-to-image generative models. Besides\nthe strong quantitative performances, extensive qualitative comparisons also\nconfirm the advantages of DI* in terms of maintaining diversity, improving\nimage layouts, and enhancing aesthetic colors.

However, with the advancement of\ndigital technology, decision-makers constantly analyze past data and generate\nnew data through their decisions. We model this as a Markov decision process\nand show that the dynamic interaction between data generation and data analysis\nleads to a new type of bias -- reinforcement bias -- that exacerbates the\nendogeneity problem in standard data analysis. We propose a class of instrument\nvariable (IV)-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms to correct for the\nbias and establish their theoretical properties by incorporating them into a\nstochastic approximation (SA) framework.

                    "value": "In the standard data analysis framework, data is collected (once and for\nall), and then data analysis is carried out. However, with the advancement of\ndigital technology, decision-makers constantly analyze past data and generate\nnew data through their decisions. We model this as a Markov decision process\nand show that the dynamic interaction between data generation and data analysis\nleads to a new type of bias -- reinforcement bias -- that exacerbates the\nendogeneity problem in standard data analysis. We propose a class of instrument\nvariable (IV)-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms to correct for the\nbias and establish their theoretical properties by incorporating them into a\nstochastic approximation (SA) framework.

                "summary": "Vision transformers have emerged as a promising alternative to convolutional\nneural networks for various image analysis tasks, offering comparable or\nsuperior performance. However, one significant drawback of ViTs is their\nresource-intensive nature, leading to increased memory footprint, computation\ncomplexity, and power consumption. To democratize this high-performance\ntechnology and make it more environmentally friendly, it is essential to\ncompress ViT models, reducing their resource requirements while maintaining\nhigh performance. In this paper, we introduce a new block-structured pruning to\naddress the resource-intensive issue for ViTs, offering a balanced trade-off\nbetween accuracy and hardware acceleration. Unlike unstructured pruning or\nchannel-wise structured pruning, block pruning leverages the block-wise\nstructure of linear layers, resulting in more efficient matrix multiplications.\nTo optimize this pruning scheme, our paper proposes a novel hardware-aware\nlearning objective that simultaneously maximizes speedup and minimizes power\nconsumption during inference, tailored to the block sparsity structure. This\nobjective eliminates the need for empirical look-up tables and focuses solely\non reducing parametrized layer connections. Moreover, our paper provides a\nlightweight algorithm to achieve post-training pruning for ViTs, utilizing\nsecond-order Taylor approximation and empirical optimization to solve the\nproposed hardware-aware objective. Extensive experiments on ImageNet are\nconducted across various ViT architectures, including DeiT-B and DeiT-S,\ndemonstrating competitive performance with other pruning methods and achieving\na remarkable balance between accuracy preservation and power savings.\nEspecially, we achieve up to 3.93x and 1.79x speedups on dedicated hardware and\nGPUs respectively for DeiT-B, and also observe an inference power reduction by\n1.4x on real-world GPUs.",

                    "value": "Vision transformers have emerged as a promising alternative to convolutional\nneural networks for various image analysis tasks, offering comparable or\nsuperior performance. However, one significant drawback of ViTs is their\nresource-intensive nature, leading to increased memory footprint, computation\ncomplexity, and power consumption. To democratize this high-performance\ntechnology and make it more environmentally friendly, it is essential to\ncompress ViT models, reducing their resource requirements while maintaining\nhigh performance. In this paper, we introduce a new block-structured pruning to\naddress the resource-intensive issue for ViTs, offering a balanced trade-off\nbetween accuracy and hardware acceleration.

However, due to the high complexity of learning-based models,\ntheir practical application as text compressors has been largely overlooked. To\naddress this issue, our work focuses on a low-complexity design while\nmaintaining compression performance. We introduce a novel Learned Lossless\nLow-complexity Text Compression method (L3TC). Specifically, we conduct\nextensive experiments demonstrating that RWKV models achieve the fastest\ndecoding speed with a moderate compression ratio, making it the most suitable\nbackbone for our method. Second, we propose an outlier-aware tokenizer that\nuses a limited vocabulary to cover frequent tokens while allowing outliers to\nbypass the prediction and encoding. Third, we propose a novel high-rank\nreparameterization strategy that enhances the learning capability during\ntraining without increasing complexity during inference. Experimental results\nvalidate that our method achieves 48% bit saving compared to gzip compressor.\nBesides, L3TC offers compression performance comparable to other learned\ncompressors, with a 50x reduction in model parameters. More importantly, L3TC\nis the fastest among all learned compressors, providing real-time decoding\nspeeds up to megabytes per second.

If so, this poses a risk to anti-virus engines and\npotentially increases the flexibility of attackers to create new obfuscation\npatterns. We answer this in the affirmative by developing the MetamorphASM\nbenchmark comprising MetamorphASM Dataset (MAD) along with three code\nobfuscation techniques: dead code, register substitution, and control flow\nchange.

We perform several experiments both in ST and ASR to understand how to\nbest train the model and what data has the most impact on performance in\npreviously unseen languages. In ST, our best model is capable to achieve BLEU\nscores over 23 in CoVoST2 for two previously unseen languages, while in ASR, we\nachieve WERs of up to 28.2\\%.

This paper presents a detailed technical report on\nYuLan-Mini, a highly capable base model with 2.42B parameters that achieves\ntop-tier performance among models of similar parameter scale. Our pre-training\napproach focuses on enhancing training efficacy through three key technical\ncontributions: an elaborate data pipeline combines data cleaning with data\nschedule strategies, a robust optimization method to mitigate training\ninstability, and an effective annealing approach that incorporates targeted\ndata selection and long context training. Remarkably, YuLan-Mini, trained on\n1.08T tokens, achieves performance comparable to industry-leading models that\nrequire significantly more data. To facilitate reproduction, we release the\nfull details of the data composition for each training phase.

Our pre-training\napproach focuses on enhancing training efficacy through three key technical\ncontributions: an elaborate data pipeline combines data cleaning with data\nschedule strategies, a robust optimization method to mitigate training\ninstability, and an effective annealing approach that incorporates targeted\ndata selection and long context training. Remarkably, YuLan-Mini, trained on\n1.08T tokens, achieves performance comparable to industry-leading models that\nrequire significantly more data. To facilitate reproduction, we release the\nfull details of the data composition for each training phase. Project details\ncan be accessed at the following link: https://github.com/RUC-GSAI/YuLan-Mini."

                "summary": "The core of the Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) task is to predict and\ncomplete the missing relations or nodes in a KG. Common KGC tasks are mostly\nabout inferring unknown elements with one or two elements being known in a\ntriple. In comparison, the Triple Set Prediction (TSP) task is a more realistic\nknowledge graph completion task. It aims to predict all elements of unknown\ntriples based on the information from known triples. In recent years, large\nlanguage models (LLMs) have exhibited significant advancements in language\ncomprehension, demonstrating considerable potential for KGC tasks. However, the\npotential of LLM on the TSP task has not yet to be investigated. Thus in this\npaper we proposed a new framework to explore the strengths and limitations of\nLLM in the TSP task. Specifically, the framework consists of LLM-based rule\nmining and LLM-based triple set prediction. The relation list of KG embedded\nwithin rich semantic information is first leveraged to prompt LLM in the\ngeneration of rules. This process is both efficient and independent of\nstatistical information, making it easier to mine effective and realistic\nrules. For each subgraph, the specified rule is applied in conjunction with the\nrelevant triples within that subgraph to guide the LLM in predicting the\nmissing triples. Subsequently, the predictions from all subgraphs are\nconsolidated to derive the complete set of predicted triples on KG. Finally,\nthe method is evaluated on the relatively complete CFamily dataset. The\nexperimental results indicate that when LLMs are required to adhere to a large\namount of factual knowledge to predict missing triples, significant\nhallucinations occurs, leading to a noticeable decline in performance.

                    "value": "The core of the Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) task is to predict and\ncomplete the missing relations or nodes in a KG. Common KGC tasks are mostly\nabout inferring unknown elements with one or two elements being known in a\ntriple. In comparison, the Triple Set Prediction (TSP) task is a more realistic\nknowledge graph completion task. It aims to predict all elements of unknown\ntriples based on the information from known triples. In recent years, large\nlanguage models (LLMs) have exhibited significant advancements in language\ncomprehension, demonstrating considerable potential for KGC tasks. However, the\npotential of LLM on the TSP task has not yet to be investigated. Thus in this\npaper we proposed a new framework to explore the strengths and limitations of\nLLM in the TSP task. Specifically, the framework consists of LLM-based rule\nmining and LLM-based triple set prediction. The relation list of KG embedded\nwithin rich semantic information is first leveraged to prompt LLM in the\ngeneration of rules. This process is both efficient and independent of\nstatistical information, making it easier to mine effective and realistic\nrules. For each subgraph, the specified rule is applied in conjunction with the\nrelevant triples within that subgraph to guide the LLM in predicting the\nmissing triples. Subsequently, the predictions from all subgraphs are\nconsolidated to derive the complete set of predicted triples on KG. Finally,\nthe method is evaluated on the relatively complete CFamily dataset. The\nexperimental results indicate that when LLMs are required to adhere to a large\namount of factual knowledge to predict missing triples, significant\nhallucinations occurs, leading to a noticeable decline in performance. To\nfurther explore the causes of this phenomenon, this paper presents a\ncomprehensive analysis supported by a detailed case study."

One approach to fine-tune such huge models is to aggregate\ndevice memory from many GPUs. However, this approach introduces prohibitive\ncosts for most data scientists with a limited budget for high-end GPU servers.\nIn this paper, we focus on LLM fine-tuning on a single consumer-grade GPU in a\ncommodity server with limited main memory capacity, which is accessible to most\nAI researchers. In such a scenario, existing offloading-based methods fail to\nfine-tune an LLM efficiently due to a lack of holistic intra-server tensor\nmovement management. To this end, we present LoHan, a low-cost,\nhigh-performance deep learning training framework that enables efficient\n100B-scale model fine-tuning on a commodity server with a consumer-grade GPU\nand limited main memory capacity. The key idea is to add holistic offloading\ntraffic as an optimization dimension for 1)active gradient offloading, and\n2)holistic traffic-aware activation swapping mechanism. The experimental\nresults show that 1)LoHan is the first to fine-tune a 175B model on an RTX 4090\nand 256 GB main memory, 2)LoHan achieves 2.32x throughput than the\nstate-of-the-art baselines when fine-tuning a small 13B model, and 3)LoHan\nenables a cheap low-end consumer GPU to have higher cost-effectiveness than a\nDGX-A100 cluster when fine-tuning a 175B model.",

Here, we establish the ontology model and entity\ntypes, using the BERT model and LoRA-tuned LLM for named entity recognition,\nconstructing the knowledge graph with 9668 triples. Next, by analyzing the\nnetwork distances between disease, symptom, and drug modules, it was found that\ncloser network distances among diseases can predict greater similarities in\ntheir clinical manifestations, treatment approaches, and psychological\nmechanisms, and closer distances between symptoms indicate that they are more\nlikely to co-occur. Lastly, by comparing the proximity d and proximity z score,\nit was shown that symptom-disease pairs in primary diagnostic relationships\nhave a stronger association and are of higher referential value than those in\ndiagnostic relationships. The research results revealed the potential\nconnections between diseases, co-occurring symptoms, and similarities in\ntreatment strategies, providing new perspectives for the diagnosis and\ntreatment of psychosomatic disorders and valuable information for future mental\nhealth research and practice.",

In this paper, we introduce a novel\ngenerative framework, the Recurrent Diffusion Probabilistic Model (RDPM), which\nenhances the diffusion process through a recurrent token prediction mechanism,\nthereby pioneering the field of Discrete Diffusion. By progressively\nintroducing Gaussian noise into the latent representations of images and\nencoding them into vector-quantized tokens in a recurrent manner, RDPM\nfacilitates a unique diffusion process on discrete-value domains. This process\niteratively predicts the token codes for subsequent timesteps, transforming the\ninitial standard Gaussian noise into the source data distribution, aligning\nwith GPT-style models in terms of the loss function. RDPM demonstrates superior\nperformance while benefiting from the speed advantage of requiring only a few\ninference steps. This model not only leverages the diffusion process to ensure\nhigh-quality generation but also converts continuous signals into a series of\nhigh-fidelity discrete tokens, thereby maintaining a unified optimization\nstrategy with other discrete tokens, such as text. We anticipate that this work\nwill contribute to the development of a unified model for multimodal\ngeneration, specifically by integrating continuous signal domains such as\nimages, videos, and audio with text. We will release the code and model weights\nto the open-source community.",

This challenge focuses on\ndetecting machine-generated vs. human-authored essays for academic purposes.\nThe task is defined as follows: \"Given an essay, identify whether it is\ngenerated by a machine or authored by a human.'' The challenge involves two\nlanguages: English and Arabic. During the evaluation phase, 25 teams submitted\nsystems for English and 21 teams for Arabic, reflecting substantial interest in\nthe task. Finally, seven teams submitted system description papers. The\nmajority of submissions utilized fine-tuned transformer-based models, with one\nteam employing Large Language Models (LLMs) such as Llama 2 and Llama 3. This\npaper outlines the task formulation, details the dataset construction process,\nand explains the evaluation framework.

                "summary": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as state-of-the-art methods to\nlearn from graph-structured data for recommendation. However, most existing\nGNN-based recommendation methods focus on the optimization of model structures\nand learning strategies based on pre-defined graphs, neglecting the importance\nof the graph construction stage. Earlier works for graph construction usually\nrely on speciffic rules or crowdsourcing, which are either too simplistic or\ntoo labor-intensive. Recent works start to utilize large language models (LLMs)\nto automate the graph construction, in view of their abundant open-world\nknowledge and remarkable reasoning capabilities. Nevertheless, they generally\nsuffer from two limitations: (1) invisibility of global view (e.g., overlooking\ncontextual information) and (2) construction inefficiency. To this end, we\nintroduce AutoGraph, an automatic graph construction framework based on LLMs\nfor recommendation.

                    "value": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as state-of-the-art methods to\nlearn from graph-structured data for recommendation. However, most existing\nGNN-based recommendation methods focus on the optimization of model structures\nand learning strategies based on pre-defined graphs, neglecting the importance\nof the graph construction stage. Earlier works for graph construction usually\nrely on speciffic rules or crowdsourcing, which are either too simplistic or\ntoo labor-intensive. Recent works start to utilize large language models (LLMs)\nto automate the graph construction, in view of their abundant open-world\nknowledge and remarkable reasoning capabilities. Nevertheless, they generally\nsuffer from two limitations: (1) invisibility of global view (e.g., overlooking\ncontextual information) and (2) construction inefficiency. To this end, we\nintroduce AutoGraph, an automatic graph construction framework based on LLMs\nfor recommendation. Specifically, we first use LLMs to infer the user\npreference and item knowledge, which is encoded as semantic vectors. Next, we\nemploy vector quantization to extract the latent factors from the semantic\nvectors.

Current AIGC models primarily focus on\ncontent quality within a centralized framework, resulting in a high service\ndelay and negative user experiences. However, not only does the workload of an\nAIGC task depend on the AIGC model's complexity rather than the amount of data,\nbut the large model and its multi-layer encoder structure also result in a huge\ndemand for computational and memory resources. These unique characteristics\npose new challenges in its modeling, deployment, and scheduling at edge\nnetworks. Thus, we model an offloading problem among edges for providing real\nAIGC services and propose LAD-TS, a novel Latent Action Diffusion-based Task\nScheduling method that orchestrates multiple edge servers for expedited AIGC\nservices. The LAD-TS generates a near-optimal offloading decision by leveraging\nthe diffusion model's conditional generation capability and the reinforcement\nlearning's environment interaction ability, thereby minimizing the service\ndelays under multiple resource constraints. Meanwhile, a latent action\ndiffusion strategy is designed to guide decision generation by utilizing\nhistorical action probability, enabling rapid achievement of near-optimal\ndecisions. Furthermore, we develop DEdgeAI, a prototype edge system with a\nrefined AIGC model deployment to implement and evaluate our LAD-TS method.\nDEdgeAI provides a real AIGC service for users, demonstrating up to 29.18%\nshorter service delays than the current five representative AIGC platforms.

To mitigate potential\nharm and prevent misuse, there have been concerted efforts to align the LLMs\nwith human values and legal compliance by incorporating various techniques,\nsuch as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), into the training of\nthe LLMs. However, recent research has exposed that even aligned LLMs are\nsusceptible to adversarial manipulations known as Jailbreak Attacks. To address\nthis challenge, this paper proposes a method called Token Highlighter to\ninspect and mitigate the potential jailbreak threats in the user query. Token\nHighlighter introduced a concept called Affirmation Loss to measure the LLM's\nwillingness to answer the user query. It then uses the gradient of Affirmation\nLoss for each token in the user query to locate the jailbreak-critical tokens.\nFurther, Token Highlighter exploits our proposed Soft Removal technique to\nmitigate the jailbreak effects of critical tokens via shrinking their token\nembeddings. Experimental results on two aligned LLMs (LLaMA-2 and Vicuna-V1.5)\ndemonstrate that the proposed method can effectively defend against a variety\nof Jailbreak Attacks while maintaining competent performance on benign\nquestions of the AlpacaEval benchmark. In addition, Token Highlighter is a\ncost-effective and interpretable defense because it only needs to query the\nprotected LLM once to compute the Affirmation Loss and can highlight the\ncritical tokens upon refusal.",

We ask an ambitious question: can a pre-trained AR model be adapted to\ngenerate outputs in just one or two steps? If successful, this would\nsignificantly advance the development and deployment of AR models. We notice\nthat existing works that try to speed up AR generation by generating multiple\ntokens at once fundamentally cannot capture the output distribution due to the\nconditional dependencies between tokens, limiting their effectiveness for\nfew-step generation. To address this, we propose Distilled Decoding (DD), which\nuses flow matching to create a deterministic mapping from Gaussian distribution\nto the output distribution of the pre-trained AR model. We then train a network\nto distill this mapping, enabling few-step generation. DD doesn't need the\ntraining data of the original AR model, making it more practical. We evaluate\nDD on state-of-the-art image AR models and present promising results on\nImageNet-256. For VAR, which requires 10-step generation, DD enables one-step\ngeneration (6.3$\\times$ speed-up), with an acceptable increase in FID from 4.19\nto 9.96. For LlamaGen, DD reduces generation from 256 steps to 1, achieving an\n217.8$\\times$ speed-up with a comparable FID increase from 4.11 to 11.35. In\nboth cases, baseline methods completely fail with FID>100. DD also excels on\ntext-to-image generation, reducing the generation from 256 steps to 2 for\nLlamaGen with minimal FID increase from 25.70 to 28.95. As the first work to\ndemonstrate the possibility of one-step generation for image AR models, DD\nchallenges the prevailing notion that AR models are inherently slow, and opens\nup new opportunities for efficient AR generation.

This rapid\nproliferation of knowledge presents unprecedented opportunities for scientific\ndiscovery and formidable challenges for researchers striving to keep abreast of\nthe latest advancements. One significant challenge is navigating the vast\ncorpus of literature to extract vital gene-related information, a\ntime-consuming and cumbersome task. To enhance the efficiency of this process,\nit is crucial to address several key challenges: (1) the overwhelming volume of\nliterature, (2) the complexity of gene functions, and (3) the automated\nintegration and generation. In response, we propose GeneSUM, a two-stage\nautomated gene summary extractor utilizing a large language model (LLM). Our\napproach retrieves and eliminates redundancy of target gene literature and then\nfine-tunes the LLM to refine and streamline the summarization process.

                    "value": "Emerging topics in biomedical research are continuously expanding, providing\na wealth of information about genes and their function. This rapid\nproliferation of knowledge presents unprecedented opportunities for scientific\ndiscovery and formidable challenges for researchers striving to keep abreast of\nthe latest advancements. One significant challenge is navigating the vast\ncorpus of literature to extract vital gene-related information, a\ntime-consuming and cumbersome task. To enhance the efficiency of this process,\nit is crucial to address several key challenges: (1) the overwhelming volume of\nliterature, (2) the complexity of gene functions, and (3) the automated\nintegration and generation. In response, we propose GeneSUM, a two-stage\nautomated gene summary extractor utilizing a large language model (LLM). Our\napproach retrieves and eliminates redundancy of target gene literature and then\nfine-tunes the LLM to refine and streamline the summarization process. We\nconducted extensive experiments to validate the efficacy of our proposed\nframework. The results demonstrate that LLM significantly enhances the\nintegration of gene-specific information, allowing more efficient\ndecision-making in ongoing research."

Despite its importance, a systematic study to assess the prevalence\nof AIGTs on social media is still lacking. To address this gap, this paper aims\nto quantify, monitor, and analyze the AIGTs on online social media platforms.\nWe first collect a dataset (SM-D) with around 2.4M posts from 3 major social\nmedia platforms: Medium, Quora, and Reddit. Then, we construct a diverse\ndataset (AIGTBench) to train and evaluate AIGT detectors. AIGTBench combines\npopular open-source datasets and our AIGT datasets generated from social media\ntexts by 12 LLMs, serving as a benchmark for evaluating mainstream detectors.\nWith this setup, we identify the best-performing detector (OSM-Det). We then\napply OSM-Det to SM-D to track AIGTs over time and observe different trends of\nAI Attribution Rate (AAR) across social media platforms from January 2022 to\nOctober 2024. Specifically, Medium and Quora exhibit marked increases in AAR,\nrising from 1.77% to 37.03% and 2.06% to 38.95%, respectively. In contrast,\nReddit shows slower growth, with AAR increasing from 1.31% to 2.45% over the\nsame period. Our further analysis indicates that AIGTs differ from\nhuman-written texts across several dimensions, including linguistic patterns,\ntopic distributions, engagement levels, and the follower distribution of\nauthors.

However, existing research\nprimarily focuses on tuning language and image instructions, ignoring the\ncritical pretraining phase where models learn to process textual and visual\nmodalities jointly. In this paper, we propose a new pretraining paradigm for\nLMMs to enhance the visual comprehension capabilities of LLMs by introducing a\nnovel cross-modal comprehension stage. Specifically, we design a dynamically\nlearnable prompt token pool and employ the Hungarian algorithm to replace part\nof the original visual tokens with the most relevant prompt tokens. Then, we\nconceptualize visual tokens as analogous to a \"foreign language\" for the LLMs\nand propose a mixed attention mechanism with bidirectional visual attention and\nunidirectional textual attention to comprehensively enhance the understanding\nof visual tokens. Meanwhile, we integrate a detailed caption generation task,\nleveraging rich descriptions to further facilitate LLMs in understanding visual\nsemantic information. After pretraining on 1.5 million publicly accessible\ndata, we present a new foundation model called Croc. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that Croc achieves new state-of-the-art performance on massive\nvision-language benchmarks.

With growing concerns about privacy protection and\ndata-sharing restrictions, generating high-quality synthetic tabular data has\nbecome essential. Recent advancements show that large language models (LLMs)\ncan effectively gener-ate realistic tabular data by leveraging semantic\ninformation and overcoming the challenges of high-dimensional data that arise\nfrom one-hot encoding. However, current methods do not fully utilize the rich\ninformation available in tables. To address this, we introduce AI Generative\nTable (AIGT) based on prompt enhancement, a novel approach that utilizes meta\ndata information, such as table descriptions and schemas, as prompts to\ngenerate ultra-high quality synthetic data. To overcome the token limit\nconstraints of LLMs, we propose long-token partitioning algorithms that enable\nAIGT to model tables of any scale. AIGT achieves state-of-the-art performance\non 14 out of 20 public datasets and two real industry datasets within the\nAlipay risk control system.",

With growing concerns about privacy protection and\ndata-sharing restrictions, generating high-quality synthetic tabular data has\nbecome essential. Recent advancements show that large language models (LLMs)\ncan effectively gener-ate realistic tabular data by leveraging semantic\ninformation and overcoming the challenges of high-dimensional data that arise\nfrom one-hot encoding. However, current methods do not fully utilize the rich\ninformation available in tables. To address this, we introduce AI Generative\nTable (AIGT) based on prompt enhancement, a novel approach that utilizes meta\ndata information, such as table descriptions and schemas, as prompts to\ngenerate ultra-high quality synthetic data. To overcome the token limit\nconstraints of LLMs, we propose long-token partitioning algorithms that enable\nAIGT to model tables of any scale. AIGT achieves state-of-the-art performance\non 14 out of 20 public datasets and two real industry datasets within the\nAlipay risk control system."

This study describes the\ndevelopment and evaluation of the PErioperative AI CHatbot (PEACH), a secure\nLLM-based system integrated with local perioperative guidelines to support\npreoperative clinical decision-making. PEACH was embedded with 35 institutional\nperioperative protocols in the secure Claude 3.5 Sonet LLM framework within\nPair Chat (developed by Singapore Government) and tested in a silent deployment\nwith real-world data. Accuracy, safety, and usability were assessed. Deviations\nand hallucinations were categorized based on potential harm, and user feedback\nwas evaluated using the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). Updates were made\nafter the initial silent deployment to amend one protocol.\n  In 240 real-world clinical iterations, PEACH achieved a first-generation\naccuracy of 97.5% (78/80) and an overall accuracy of 96.7% (232/240) across\nthree iterations. The updated PEACH demonstrated improved accuracy of 97.9%\n(235/240), with a statistically significant difference from the null hypothesis\nof 95% accuracy (p = 0.018, 95% CI: 0.952-0.991). Minimal hallucinations and\ndeviations were observed (both 1/240 and 2/240, respectively). Clinicians\nreported that PEACH expedited decisions in 95% of cases, and inter-rater\nreliability ranged from kappa 0.772-0.893 within PEACH and 0.610-0.784 among\nattendings.\n  PEACH is an accurate, adaptable tool that enhances consistency and efficiency\nin perioperative decision-making. Future research should explore its\nscalability across specialties and its impact on clinical outcomes.",
