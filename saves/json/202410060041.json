                "summary": "Intelligent embodied agents need to quickly adapt to new scenarios by\nintegrating long histories of experience into decision-making. For instance, a\nrobot in an unfamiliar house initially wouldn't know the locations of objects\nneeded for tasks and might perform inefficiently. However, as it gathers more\nexperience, it should learn the layout of its environment and remember where\nobjects are, allowing it to complete new tasks more efficiently. To enable such\nrapid adaptation to new tasks, we present ReLIC, a new approach for in-context\nreinforcement learning (RL) for embodied agents. With ReLIC, agents are capable\nof adapting to new environments using 64,000 steps of in-context experience\nwith full attention while being trained through self-generated experience via\nRL. We achieve this by proposing a novel policy update scheme for on-policy RL\ncalled \"partial updates'' as well as a Sink-KV mechanism that enables effective\nutilization of a long observation history for embodied agents. Our method\noutperforms a variety of meta-RL baselines in adapting to unseen houses in an\nembodied multi-object navigation task. In addition, we find that ReLIC is\ncapable of few-shot imitation learning despite never being trained with expert\ndemonstrations. We also provide a comprehensive analysis of ReLIC, highlighting\nthat the combination of large-scale RL training, the proposed partial updates\nscheme, and the Sink-KV are essential for effective in-context learning.

Drawing from the\nextensive potential unveiled by the Diffusion Model in both semantic\ncorrespondence and open vocabulary segmentation, our work initiates an\ninvestigation into employing the Latent Diffusion Model for Few-shot Semantic\nSegmentation. Recently, inspired by the in-context learning ability of large\nlanguage models, Few-shot Semantic Segmentation has evolved into In-context\nSegmentation tasks, morphing into a crucial element in assessing generalist\nsegmentation models. In this context, we concentrate on Few-shot Semantic\nSegmentation, establishing a solid foundation for the future development of a\nDiffusion-based generalist model for segmentation. Our initial focus lies in\nunderstanding how to facilitate interaction between the query image and the\nsupport image, resulting in the proposal of a KV fusion method within the\nself-attention framework. Subsequently, we delve deeper into optimizing the\ninfusion of information from the support mask and simultaneously re-evaluating\nhow to provide reasonable supervision from the query mask. Based on our\nanalysis, we establish a simple and effective framework named DiffewS,\nmaximally retaining the original Latent Diffusion Model's generative framework\nand effectively utilizing the pre-training prior. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the previous SOTA models\nin multiple settings.",

                    "value": "The Diffusion Model has not only garnered noteworthy achievements in the\nrealm of image generation but has also demonstrated its potential as an\neffective pretraining method utilizing unlabeled data. Drawing from the\nextensive potential unveiled by the Diffusion Model in both semantic\ncorrespondence and open vocabulary segmentation, our work initiates an\ninvestigation into employing the Latent Diffusion Model for Few-shot Semantic\nSegmentation. Recently, inspired by the in-context learning ability of large\nlanguage models, Few-shot Semantic Segmentation has evolved into In-context\nSegmentation tasks, morphing into a crucial element in assessing generalist\nsegmentation models. In this context, we concentrate on Few-shot Semantic\nSegmentation, establishing a solid foundation for the future development of a\nDiffusion-based generalist model for segmentation. Our initial focus lies in\nunderstanding how to facilitate interaction between the query image and the\nsupport image, resulting in the proposal of a KV fusion method within the\nself-attention framework. Subsequently, we delve deeper into optimizing the\ninfusion of information from the support mask and simultaneously re-evaluating\nhow to provide reasonable supervision from the query mask. Based on our\nanalysis, we establish a simple and effective framework named DiffewS,\nmaximally retaining the original Latent Diffusion Model's generative framework\nand effectively utilizing the pre-training prior. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the previous SOTA models\nin multiple settings."

Locret is fine-tuned on top of the frozen\nbackbone LLM using a minimal amount of data from standard long-context SFT\ndatasets.

Upon detailed analysis, we pinpoint\nthat these discrepancies primarily stem from two aspects: (1) Prior Timestep\nDisregard, where training ignores the effect of cache usage at earlier\ntimesteps, and (2) Objective Mismatch, where the training target (align\npredicted noise in each timestep) deviates from the goal of inference (generate\nthe high-quality image). To alleviate these discrepancies, we propose\nHarmoniCa, a novel method that Harmonizes training and inference with a novel\nlearning-based Caching framework built upon Step-Wise Denoising Training (SDT)\nand Image Error Proxy-Guided Objective (IEPO). Compared to the traditional\ntraining paradigm, the newly proposed SDT maintains the continuity of the\ndenoising process, enabling the model to leverage information from prior\ntimesteps during training, similar to the way it operates during inference.\nFurthermore, we design IEPO, which integrates an efficient proxy mechanism to\napproximate the final image error caused by reusing the cached feature.\nTherefore, IEPO helps balance final image quality and cache utilization,\nresolving the issue of training that only considers the impact of cache usage\non the predicted output at each timestep.",

Upon detailed analysis, we pinpoint\nthat these discrepancies primarily stem from two aspects: (1) Prior Timestep\nDisregard, where training ignores the effect of cache usage at earlier\ntimesteps, and (2) Objective Mismatch, where the training target (align\npredicted noise in each timestep) deviates from the goal of inference (generate\nthe high-quality image). To alleviate these discrepancies, we propose\nHarmoniCa, a novel method that Harmonizes training and inference with a novel\nlearning-based Caching framework built upon Step-Wise Denoising Training (SDT)\nand Image Error Proxy-Guided Objective (IEPO). Compared to the traditional\ntraining paradigm, the newly proposed SDT maintains the continuity of the\ndenoising process, enabling the model to leverage information from prior\ntimesteps during training, similar to the way it operates during inference.\nFurthermore, we design IEPO, which integrates an efficient proxy mechanism to\napproximate the final image error caused by reusing the cached feature.\nTherefore, IEPO helps balance final image quality and cache utilization,\nresolving the issue of training that only considers the impact of cache usage\non the predicted output at each timestep."

However, the basic abilities such as the controllability of\nLLMs are still limited. To address this, we propose \"Self-controller\", a novel\nagentic framework bringing self-awareness into LLMs' reasoning logic. The core\nidea of this work is to maintain states based on the LLM's response, letting\nthe LLM become self-aware of current status and think step by step in a\nmulti-round chain-of-thought paradigm. Our experiment on the state of textual\nlength has shown the controllability and effectiveness of the Self-controller.\nWe further implement a binary search algorithm to accelerate the generation\nprocess based on the linearity and monotonicity of the textual length state.\nAnother advantage of the Self-controller comes with DeepSeek's Context Caching\ntechnology, which significantly saves computational token consumption when a\ncluster of conversations shares the same prefix of context. Theoretically, we\nprove that in this scenario the extra time complexity is $O(c \\log n)$.

However, the basic abilities such as the controllability of\nLLMs are still limited. To address this, we propose \"Self-controller\", a novel\nagentic framework bringing self-awareness into LLMs' reasoning logic. The core\nidea of this work is to maintain states based on the LLM's response, letting\nthe LLM become self-aware of current status and think step by step in a\nmulti-round chain-of-thought paradigm. Our experiment on the state of textual\nlength has shown the controllability and effectiveness of the Self-controller.\nWe further implement a binary search algorithm to accelerate the generation\nprocess based on the linearity and monotonicity of the textual length state.\nAnother advantage of the Self-controller comes with DeepSeek's Context Caching\ntechnology, which significantly saves computational token consumption when a\ncluster of conversations shares the same prefix of context. Theoretically, we\nprove that in this scenario the extra time complexity is $O(c \\log n)$.

Unlike\nfew-shot learning methods in natural images that can leverage the labels of\neach image, existing few-shot WSI classification methods only utilize a small\nnumber of fine-grained labels or weakly supervised slide labels for training in\norder to avoid expensive fine-grained annotation.

To address\nthe above issues, we propose a novel and efficient dual-tier few-shot learning\nparadigm for WSI classification, named FAST. FAST consists of a dual-level\nannotation strategy and a dual-branch classification framework. Firstly, to\navoid expensive fine-grained annotation, we collect a very small number of WSIs\nat the slide level, and annotate an extremely small number of patches. Then, to\nfully mining the available WSIs, we use all the patches and available patch\nlabels to build a cache branch, which utilizes the labeled patches to learn the\nlabels of unlabeled patches and through knowledge retrieval for patch\nclassification.

The segments were converted\nto stereolithographic (STL) files and smoothed in Fusion360. A slit to\naccommodate a radiochromic film (RCF) was added at the location of the glioma\ntumor. UPDOG was 3D printed on a polyjet printer using VeroUltraWhite ($\\rho$ =\n1.19-1.20 g/cm\\textsuperscript{3}) for the bone and Agilus30 ($\\rho$ =\n1.14-1.15 g/cm\\textsuperscript{3}) for the soft tissue. CT scans of UPDOG were\nacquired on a clinical CT scanner. An LD-V1 RCF was inserted into UPDOG and\nirradiated with a kV x-ray source from two angles. The delivered dose to the\nRCF was compared to Monte Carlo (MC) simulations performed in TOPAS.\n  Results: The bone and soft tissue segments in UPDOG were mimicked the patient\nanatomy well with tube voltage-dependent CT numbers. The contrast in HU was of\n49, 47 and 50 HU for the 80, 100, and 120 kVp scans, respectively, sufficient\nfor anatomy visualization. The irradiations delivered a maximum dose to RCF of\n284 mGy which was compared to the results of MC simulations using a depth dose\ncurve and central-axis (CAX) beam profiles. The mean difference in CAX profiles\nand PDD between RCF and MC results was 15.9\\% and 2.3\\%, respectively.\n  Conclusions: We have demonstrated that UPDOG is a useful QA tool for kV\ncanine radiotherapy. UPDOG successfully anatomically mimicked the dog anatomy,\nwith a reduced but sufficient bone contrast. We showed that dose delivered to a\ncanine glioma with kV x-rays can be successfully measured with an RCF\npositioned at the tumor location.",

In this paper, we address this critical need by introducing the\nFlooNoC Network-on-Chip (NoC), featuring very wide, fully Advanced eXtensible\nInterface (AXI4) compliant links designed to meet the massive bandwidth needs\nat high energy efficiency.

Wind lulls are\nsurprisingly frequent, occasionally lasting a week or more, and are always\nlikely to be beyond the capabilities of stored or imported electrical energy to\nmitigate them. The models indicate that there will be a continuing need for gas\npowered generation to mitigate wind lulls.

Unfortunately, we observe that the off-the-shelf ANNS\nindexes are often ineffective for such retrieval tasks due to the\nout-of-distribution (OOD) between query vectors and key vectors in attention\nmechanism. RetrievalAttention addresses the OOD challenge by designing an\nattention-aware vector search algorithm that can adapt to the distribution of\nquery vectors. Our evaluation shows that RetrievalAttention only needs to\naccess 1--3% of data while maintaining high model accuracy. This leads to\nsignificant reduction in the inference cost of long-context LLMs with much\nlower GPU memory footprint. In particular, RetrievalAttention only needs a\nsingle NVIDIA RTX4090 (24GB) for serving 128K tokens in LLMs with 8B\nparameters, which is capable of generating one token in 0.188 seconds.",

RetrievalAttention addresses the OOD challenge by designing an\nattention-aware vector search algorithm that can adapt to the distribution of\nquery vectors. Our evaluation shows that RetrievalAttention only needs to\naccess 1--3% of data while maintaining high model accuracy. This leads to\nsignificant reduction in the inference cost of long-context LLMs with much\nlower GPU memory footprint. In particular, RetrievalAttention only needs a\nsingle NVIDIA RTX4090 (24GB) for serving 128K tokens in LLMs with 8B\nparameters, which is capable of generating one token in 0.188 seconds."

However, detailed experimental characterization of its\nintrinsic defects as well as its defect creation characteristics under electron\nirradiation are scarce. Here, we report on the creation and stability of a\nvariety of defect configurations under 60 kV electron irradiation in mono- and\nbilayer phosphorene including the first experimental reports of stable\nadatom-vacancy-complexes. Displacement cross section measurements in bilayer\nphosphorene yield a value of 7.7 +- 1.4 barn with an estimated lifetime of\nadatom-vacancy-complexes of 19.9 +- 0.7 s, while some are stable for up to 68 s\nunder continuous electron irradiation. Surprisingly, ab initio-based\nsimulations indicate that the complexes should readily recombine, even in\nstructures strained by up to 3 %. The presented results will help to improve\nthe understanding of the wide variety of defects in phosphorene, their\ncreation, and their stability, which may enable new pathways for defect\nengineered phosphorene devices.",

In\nthis work, we propose Domain-Aware Real-Time Dynamic Adaptation (DARDA) to\naddress such issues. Our key approach is to proactively learn latent\nrepresentations of some corruption types, each one associated with a\nsub-network state tailored to correctly classify inputs affected by that\ncorruption. After deployment, DARDA adapts the DNN to previously unseen\ncorruptions in an unsupervised fashion by (i) estimating the latent\nrepresentation of the ongoing corruption; (ii) selecting the sub-network whose\nassociated corruption is the closest in the latent space to the ongoing\ncorruption; and (iii) adapting DNN state, so that its representation matches\nthe ongoing corruption. This way, DARDA is more resource efficient and can\nswiftly adapt to new distributions caused by different corruptions without\nrequiring a large variety of input data. Through experiments with two popular\nmobile edge devices - Raspberry Pi and NVIDIA Jetson Nano - we show that DARDA\nreduces energy consumption and average cache memory footprint respectively by\n1.74x and 2.64x with respect to the state of the art, while increasing the\nperformance by 10.4%, 5.7% and 4.4% on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and TinyImagenet.",

In\nthis paper, we propose DACAT, a novel dual-stream model that adaptively learns\nclip-aware context information to enhance the temporal relationship. In one\nstream, DACAT pretrains a frame encoder, caching all historical frame-wise\nfeatures. In the other stream, DACAT fine-tunes a new frame encoder to extract\nthe frame-wise feature at the current moment. Additionally, a max clip-response\nread-out (Max-R) module is introduced to bridge the two streams by using the\ncurrent frame-wise feature to adaptively fetch the most relevant past clip from\nthe feature cache. The clip-aware context feature is then encoded via\ncross-attention between the current frame and its fetched adaptive clip, and\nfurther utilized to enhance the time modeling for accurate online surgical\nphase recognition. The benchmark results on three public datasets, i.e.,\nCholec80, M2CAI16, and AutoLaparo, demonstrate the superiority of our proposed\nDACAT over existing state-of-the-art methods, with improvements in Jaccard\nscores of at least 4.5%, 4.6%, and 2.7%, respectively.

We show that by removing\nthese biases our approach improves the generality of radiance cache based\ninverse rendering, as well as increasing quality in the presence of challenging\nlight transport effects such as specular reflections."

The KV cache stores key-value\nstates of previously generated tokens, significantly reducing the need for\nrepetitive computations and thereby lowering latency in autoregressive\ngeneration. However, the size of the KV cache grows linearly with sequence\nlength, posing challenges for applications requiring long context input and\nextensive sequence generation. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective\napproach, called MiniCache, to compress the KV cache across layers from a novel\ndepth perspective, significantly reducing the memory footprint for LLM\ninference. Our approach is based on the observation that KV cache states\nexhibit high similarity between the adjacent layers in the middle-to-deep\nportion of LLMs. To facilitate merging, we propose disentangling the states\ninto the magnitude and direction components, interpolating the directions of\nthe state vectors while preserving their lengths unchanged. Furthermore, we\nintroduce a token retention strategy to keep highly distinct state pairs\nunmerged, thus preserving the information with minimal additional storage\noverhead. Our MiniCache is training-free and general, complementing existing KV\ncache compression strategies, such as quantization and sparsity. We conduct a\ncomprehensive evaluation of MiniCache utilizing various models including\nLLaMA-2, LLaMA-3, Phi-3, Mistral, and Mixtral across multiple benchmarks,\ndemonstrating its exceptional performance in achieving superior compression\nratios and high throughput.

As semiconductor devices face challenges such as\nincreased leakage currents and reduced performance at higher temperatures,\nthese novel technologies offer high performance and low power computation.\nConventional semiconductor electronics operating at cryogenic temperatures\n(below -150{\\deg}C or 123.15 K) can benefit from reduced leakage currents and\nimproved electron mobility. On the other hand, superconductor electronics,\noperating below 10 K, allow electrons to flow without resistance, offering the\npotential for ultra-low-power, high-speed computation. This study presents a\ncomprehensive performance modeling and analysis of these technologies and\nprovides insights into their potential benefits and limitations.

One explanation for this is the scarcity of open-sourced edit\ndata. While high-quality instruction data for code synthesis is already scarce,\nhigh-quality edit data is even scarcer. To fill this gap, we develop a\nsynthetic data generation algorithm called LintSeq. This algorithm refactors\nexisting code into a sequence of code edits by using a linter to procedurally\nsample across the error-free insertions that can be used to sequentially write\nprograms.

                "summary": "Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has demonstrated\neffectiveness in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences.\nHowever, token-level RLHF suffers from the credit assignment problem over long\nsequences, where delayed rewards make it challenging for the model to discern\nwhich actions contributed to successful outcomes. This hinders learning\nefficiency and slows convergence. In this paper, we propose MA-RLHF, a simple\nyet effective RLHF framework that incorporates macro actions -- sequences of\ntokens or higher-level language constructs -- into the learning process. By\noperating at this higher level of abstraction, our approach reduces the\ntemporal distance between actions and rewards, facilitating faster and more\naccurate credit assignment. This results in more stable policy gradient\nestimates and enhances learning efficiency within each episode, all without\nincreasing computational complexity during training or inference. We validate\nour approach through extensive experiments across various model sizes and\ntasks, including text summarization, dialogue generation, question answering,\nand program synthesis. Our method achieves substantial performance improvements\nover standard RLHF, with performance gains of up to 30% in text summarization\nand code generation, 18% in dialogue, and 8% in question answering tasks.\nNotably, our approach reaches parity with vanilla RLHF 1.7x to 2x faster in\nterms of training time and continues to outperform it with further training. We\nwill make our code and data publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/ernie-research/MA-RLHF .",

                    "value": "Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has demonstrated\neffectiveness in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences.\nHowever, token-level RLHF suffers from the credit assignment problem over long\nsequences, where delayed rewards make it challenging for the model to discern\nwhich actions contributed to successful outcomes. This hinders learning\nefficiency and slows convergence. In this paper, we propose MA-RLHF, a simple\nyet effective RLHF framework that incorporates macro actions -- sequences of\ntokens or higher-level language constructs -- into the learning process. By\noperating at this higher level of abstraction, our approach reduces the\ntemporal distance between actions and rewards, facilitating faster and more\naccurate credit assignment. This results in more stable policy gradient\nestimates and enhances learning efficiency within each episode, all without\nincreasing computational complexity during training or inference. We validate\nour approach through extensive experiments across various model sizes and\ntasks, including text summarization, dialogue generation, question answering,\nand program synthesis. Our method achieves substantial performance improvements\nover standard RLHF, with performance gains of up to 30% in text summarization\nand code generation, 18% in dialogue, and 8% in question answering tasks.\nNotably, our approach reaches parity with vanilla RLHF 1.7x to 2x faster in\nterms of training time and continues to outperform it with further training. We\nwill make our code and data publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/ernie-research/MA-RLHF ."

                "summary": "The recent popularity of foundation models and the pre-train-and-adapt\nparadigm, where a large-scale model is transferred to downstream tasks, is\ngaining attention for volumetric medical image segmentation. However, current\ntransfer learning strategies devoted to full fine-tuning for transfer learning\nmay require significant resources and yield sub-optimal results when the\nlabeled data of the target task is scarce. This makes its applicability in real\nclinical settings challenging since these institutions are usually constrained\non data and computational resources to develop proprietary solutions. To\naddress this challenge, we formalize Few-Shot Efficient Fine-Tuning (FSEFT), a\nnovel and realistic scenario for adapting medical image segmentation foundation\nmodels. This setting considers the key role of both data- and parameter-\nefficiency during adaptation.

However, current\ntransfer learning strategies devoted to full fine-tuning for transfer learning\nmay require significant resources and yield sub-optimal results when the\nlabeled data of the target task is scarce. This makes its applicability in real\nclinical settings challenging since these institutions are usually constrained\non data and computational resources to develop proprietary solutions. To\naddress this challenge, we formalize Few-Shot Efficient Fine-Tuning (FSEFT), a\nnovel and realistic scenario for adapting medical image segmentation foundation\nmodels. This setting considers the key role of both data- and parameter-\nefficiency during adaptation.

Despite their advanced language capabilities, when it comes to\ndomain-specific and knowledge-intensive tasks, LLMs suffer from hallucinations,\nknowledge cut-offs, and lack of knowledge attributions. Additionally, fine\ntuning LLMs' intrinsic knowledge to highly specific domains is an expensive and\ntime consuming process. The retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) process has\nrecently emerged as a method capable of optimization of LLM responses, by\nreferencing them to a predetermined ontology. It was shown that using a\nKnowledge Graph (KG) ontology for RAG improves the QA accuracy, by taking into\naccount relevant sub-graphs that preserve the information in a structured\nmanner. In this paper, we introduce SMART-SLIC, a highly domain-specific LLM\nframework, that integrates RAG with KG and a vector store (VS) that store\nfactual domain specific information. Importantly, to avoid hallucinations in\nthe KG, we build these highly domain-specific KGs and VSs without the use of\nLLMs, but via NLP, data mining, and nonnegative tensor factorization with\nautomatic model selection. Pairing our RAG with a domain-specific: (i) KG\n(containing structured information), and (ii) VS (containing unstructured\ninformation) enables the development of domain-specific chat-bots that\nattribute the source of information, mitigate hallucinations, lessen the need\nfor fine-tuning, and excel in highly domain-specific question answering tasks.\nWe pair SMART-SLIC with chain-of-thought prompting agents.

Operating\nwithin the framework of canonicalization, LieLAC can easily be integrated with\nunconstrained pre-trained models, transforming inputs to a canonical form\nbefore feeding them into the existing model, effectively aligning the input for\nmodel inference according to allowed symmetries. LieLAC utilizes standard Lie\ngroup descent schemes, achieving equivariance in pre-trained models. Finally,\nwe showcase LieLAC's efficacy on tasks of invariant image classification and\nLie point symmetry equivariant neural PDE solvers using pre-trained models."

Ideally,\nLLMs should provide informative responses while avoiding the disclosure of\nharmful or sensitive information. However, current alignment approaches, which\nrely heavily on refusal strategies, such as training models to completely\nreject harmful prompts or applying coarse filters are limited by their binary\nnature. These methods either fully deny access to information or grant it\nwithout sufficient nuance, leading to overly cautious responses or failures to\ndetect subtle harmful content. For example, LLMs may refuse to provide basic,\npublic information about medication due to misuse concerns. Moreover, these\nrefusal-based methods struggle to handle mixed-content scenarios and lack the\nability to adapt to context-dependent sensitivities, which can result in\nover-censorship of benign content. To overcome these challenges, we introduce\nHiddenGuard, a novel framework for fine-grained, safe generation in LLMs.\nHiddenGuard incorporates Prism (rePresentation Router for In-Stream\nModeration), which operates alongside the LLM to enable real-time, token-level\ndetection and redaction of harmful content by leveraging intermediate hidden\nstates. This fine-grained approach allows for more nuanced, context-aware\nmoderation, enabling the model to generate informative responses while\nselectively redacting or replacing sensitive information, rather than outright\nrefusal. We also contribute a comprehensive dataset with token-level\nfine-grained annotations of potentially harmful information across diverse\ncontexts. Our experiments demonstrate that HiddenGuard achieves over 90% in F1\nscore for detecting and redacting harmful content while preserving the overall\nutility and informativeness of the model's responses.",

To overcome these challenges, we introduce\nHiddenGuard, a novel framework for fine-grained, safe generation in LLMs.\nHiddenGuard incorporates Prism (rePresentation Router for In-Stream\nModeration), which operates alongside the LLM to enable real-time, token-level\ndetection and redaction of harmful content by leveraging intermediate hidden\nstates. This fine-grained approach allows for more nuanced, context-aware\nmoderation, enabling the model to generate informative responses while\nselectively redacting or replacing sensitive information, rather than outright\nrefusal. We also contribute a comprehensive dataset with token-level\nfine-grained annotations of potentially harmful information across diverse\ncontexts. Our experiments demonstrate that HiddenGuard achieves over 90% in F1\nscore for detecting and redacting harmful content while preserving the overall\nutility and informativeness of the model's responses."

We\nevaluate models on two setups: CulturalBench-Easy and CulturalBench-Hard which\nshare the same questions but asked differently. We find that LLMs are sensitive\nto such difference in setups (e.g., GPT-4o with 27.3% difference). Compared to\nhuman performance (92.6% accuracy), CulturalBench-Hard is more challenging for\nfrontier LLMs with the best performing model (GPT-4o) at only 61.5% and the\nworst (Llama3-8b) at 21.4%. Moreover, we find that LLMs often struggle with\ntricky questions that have multiple correct answers (e.g., What utensils do the\nChinese usually use?), revealing a tendency to converge to a single answer.

To channel LLMs' impact on\nsociety, we need to develop systems to measure and benchmark their\npersuasiveness. With this motivation, we introduce PersuasionBench and\nPersuasionArena, the first large-scale benchmark and arena containing a battery\nof tasks to measure the persuasion ability of generative models automatically.\nWe investigate to what extent LLMs know and leverage linguistic patterns that\ncan help them generate more persuasive language. Our findings indicate that the\npersuasiveness of LLMs correlates positively with model size, but smaller\nmodels can also be made to have a higher persuasiveness than much larger\nmodels.

                "summary": "Information retrieval (IR) systems have played a vital role in modern digital\nlife and have cemented their continued usefulness in this new era of generative\nAI via retrieval-augmented generation. With strong language processing\ncapabilities and remarkable versatility, large language models (LLMs) have\nbecome popular choices for zero-shot re-ranking in IR systems. So far,\nLLM-based re-ranking methods rely on strong generative capabilities, which\nrestricts their use to either specialized or powerful proprietary models. Given\nthese restrictions, we ask: is autoregressive generation necessary and optimal\nfor LLMs to perform re-ranking? We hypothesize that there are abundant signals\nrelevant to re-ranking within LLMs that might not be used to their full\npotential via generation. To more directly leverage such signals, we propose\nin-context re-ranking (ICR), a novel method that leverages the change in\nattention pattern caused by the search query for accurate and efficient\nre-ranking. To mitigate the intrinsic biases in LLMs, we propose a calibration\nmethod using a content-free query. Due to the absence of generation, ICR only\nrequires two ($O(1)$) forward passes to re-rank $N$ documents, making it\nsubstantially more efficient than generative re-ranking methods that require at\nleast $O(N)$ forward passes. Our novel design also enables ICR to be applied to\nany LLM without specialized training while guaranteeing a well-formed ranking.\nExtensive experiments with two popular open-weight LLMs on standard single-hop\nand multi-hop information retrieval benchmarks show that ICR outperforms\nRankGPT while cutting the latency by more than 60% in practice. Through\ndetailed analyses, we show that ICR's performance is specially strong on tasks\nthat require more complex re-ranking signals. Our findings call for further\nexploration on novel ways of utilizing open-weight LLMs beyond text generation.",

                    "value": "Information retrieval (IR) systems have played a vital role in modern digital\nlife and have cemented their continued usefulness in this new era of generative\nAI via retrieval-augmented generation. With strong language processing\ncapabilities and remarkable versatility, large language models (LLMs) have\nbecome popular choices for zero-shot re-ranking in IR systems. So far,\nLLM-based re-ranking methods rely on strong generative capabilities, which\nrestricts their use to either specialized or powerful proprietary models. Given\nthese restrictions, we ask: is autoregressive generation necessary and optimal\nfor LLMs to perform re-ranking? We hypothesize that there are abundant signals\nrelevant to re-ranking within LLMs that might not be used to their full\npotential via generation. To more directly leverage such signals, we propose\nin-context re-ranking (ICR), a novel method that leverages the change in\nattention pattern caused by the search query for accurate and efficient\nre-ranking. To mitigate the intrinsic biases in LLMs, we propose a calibration\nmethod using a content-free query. Due to the absence of generation, ICR only\nrequires two ($O(1)$) forward passes to re-rank $N$ documents, making it\nsubstantially more efficient than generative re-ranking methods that require at\nleast $O(N)$ forward passes. Our novel design also enables ICR to be applied to\nany LLM without specialized training while guaranteeing a well-formed ranking.\nExtensive experiments with two popular open-weight LLMs on standard single-hop\nand multi-hop information retrieval benchmarks show that ICR outperforms\nRankGPT while cutting the latency by more than 60% in practice. Through\ndetailed analyses, we show that ICR's performance is specially strong on tasks\nthat require more complex re-ranking signals. Our findings call for further\nexploration on novel ways of utilizing open-weight LLMs beyond text generation."

Higher average\npayoffs for the more intelligent agents are usually observed, albeit at the\nexpense of less intelligent agents. The results from game play with simulated\nagents not only convey insights on potential human behaviours under specified\nexperimental set-ups, they also offer valuable understanding of strategic\ninteractions among algorithms."

To address this challenge, we introduce\nScylla, a dynamic evaluation framework that quantitatively measures the\ngeneralization abilities of LLMs. Scylla disentangles generalization from\nmemorization via assessing model performance on both in-distribution (ID) and\nout-of-distribution (OOD) data through 20 tasks across 5 levels of complexity.\nThrough extensive experiments, we uncover a non-monotonic relationship between\ntask complexity and the performance gap between ID and OOD data, which we term\nthe generalization valley. Specifically, this phenomenon reveals a critical\nthreshold - referred to as critical complexity - where reliance on\nnon-generalizable behavior peaks, indicating the upper bound of LLMs'\ngeneralization capabilities. As model size increases, the critical complexity\nshifts toward higher levels of task complexity, suggesting that larger models\ncan handle more complex reasoning tasks before over-relying on memorization.\nLeveraging Scylla and the concept of critical complexity, we benchmark 28LLMs\nincluding both open-sourced models such as LLaMA and Qwen families, and\nclose-sourced models like Claude and GPT, providing a more robust evaluation\nand establishing a clearer understanding of LLMs' generalization capabilities.",

However, challenges arise due to dynamic disturbances, e.g.,\nlight reflections and refraction from the random air-water interface, irregular\nliquid flow, and similar factors, which can lead to potential failures in\nperception and navigation systems. Traditional computer vision algorithms\nstruggle to differentiate between real and virtual image regions, significantly\ncomplicating tasks. A virtual image region is an apparent representation formed\nby the redirection of light rays, typically through reflection or refraction,\ncreating the illusion of an object's presence without its actual physical\nlocation. This work proposes a novel approach for segmentation on real and\nvirtual image regions, exploiting synthetic images combined with\ndomain-invariant information, a Motion Entropy Kernel, and Epipolar Geometric\nConsistency. Our segmentation network does not need to be re-trained if the\ndomain changes. We show this by deploying the same segmentation network in two\ndifferent domains: simulation and the real world. By creating realistic\nsynthetic images that mimic the complexities of the water surface, we provide\nfine-grained training data for our network (MARVIS) to discern between real and\nvirtual images effectively. By motion & geometry-aware design choices and\nthrough comprehensive experimental analysis, we achieve state-of-the-art\nreal-virtual image segmentation performance in unseen real world domain,\nachieving an IoU over 78% and a F1-Score over 86% while ensuring a small\ncomputational footprint.

Our system employs a simple but effective heuristic\nexploration policy to interact with the objects as well as end-to-end\nlearning-based algorithms to fuse vibration signals to infer object properties.\nOur framework underscores the significance of in-hand acoustic vibration\nsensing in advancing robot tactile perception."

To\nobtain accurate IQA scores, namely scores consistent with humans, we design an\nMLLM-based inference pipeline that imitates human experts. In detail, Dog-IQA\napplies two techniques.

Second, Dog-IQA comprehensively takes local semantic\nobjects and the whole image as input and aggregates their scores, leveraging\nlocal and global information.

Autoregressive large language models (LLMs) have achieved\ngreat success in generating coherent and long sequences of tokens in the domain\nof natural language processing, while the exploration of autoregressive LLMs\nfor video generation is limited to generating short videos of several seconds.\nIn this work, we conduct a deep analysis of the challenges that prevent\nautoregressive LLM-based video generators from generating long videos. Based on\nthe observations and analysis, we propose Loong, a new autoregressive LLM-based\nvideo generator that can generate minute-long videos. Specifically, we model\nthe text tokens and video tokens as a unified sequence for autoregressive LLMs\nand train the model from scratch. We propose progressive short-to-long training\nwith a loss re-weighting scheme to mitigate the loss imbalance problem for long\nvideo training. We further investigate inference strategies, including video\ntoken re-encoding and sampling strategies, to diminish error accumulation\nduring inference. Our proposed Loong can be trained on 10-second videos and be\nextended to generate minute-level long videos conditioned on text prompts, as\ndemonstrated by the results.

One explanation for this is the scarcity of open-sourced edit\ndata. While high-quality instruction data for code synthesis is already scarce,\nhigh-quality edit data is even scarcer. To fill this gap, we develop a\nsynthetic data generation algorithm called LintSeq. This algorithm refactors\nexisting code into a sequence of code edits by using a linter to procedurally\nsample across the error-free insertions that can be used to sequentially write\nprograms. It outputs edit sequences as text strings consisting of consecutive\nprogram diffs. To test LintSeq, we use it to refactor a dataset of instruction\n+ program pairs into instruction + program-diff-sequence tuples. Then, we\ninstruction finetune a series of smaller LLMs ranging from 2.6B to 14B\nparameters on both the re-factored and original versions of this dataset,\ncomparing zero-shot performance on code synthesis benchmarks. We show that\nduring repeated sampling, edit sequence finetuned models produce more diverse\nprograms than baselines. This results in better inference-time scaling for\nbenchmark coverage as a function of samples, i.e. the fraction of problems\n\"pass@k\" solved by any attempt given \"k\" tries. For example, on HumanEval\npass@50, small LLMs finetuned on synthetic edit sequences are competitive with\nGPT-4 and outperform models finetuned on the baseline dataset by +20% (+/-3%)\nin absolute score.

                "summary": "Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has demonstrated\neffectiveness in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences.\nHowever, token-level RLHF suffers from the credit assignment problem over long\nsequences, where delayed rewards make it challenging for the model to discern\nwhich actions contributed to successful outcomes. This hinders learning\nefficiency and slows convergence. In this paper, we propose MA-RLHF, a simple\nyet effective RLHF framework that incorporates macro actions -- sequences of\ntokens or higher-level language constructs -- into the learning process. By\noperating at this higher level of abstraction, our approach reduces the\ntemporal distance between actions and rewards, facilitating faster and more\naccurate credit assignment.

This hinders learning\nefficiency and slows convergence. In this paper, we propose MA-RLHF, a simple\nyet effective RLHF framework that incorporates macro actions -- sequences of\ntokens or higher-level language constructs -- into the learning process. By\noperating at this higher level of abstraction, our approach reduces the\ntemporal distance between actions and rewards, facilitating faster and more\naccurate credit assignment.

However, they are all confined to a single-GPU optimization, while\nproduction LLM serving systems are distributed by nature.\n  This paper proposes Preble, the first distributed LLM serving platform that\ntargets and optimizes for prompt sharing. We designed a distributed scheduling\nsystem that co-optimizes KV state reuse and computation load-balancing with a\nnew scheduling algorithm and a hierarchical scheduling mechanism. Our\nevaluation of Preble with real workloads and request arrival patterns on two\nopen-source LLMs shows that Preble outperforms the SOTA serving systems by 1.5X\nto 14.5X on average latency and 2X to 10X on p99 latency.",

Despite their advanced language capabilities, when it comes to\ndomain-specific and knowledge-intensive tasks, LLMs suffer from hallucinations,\nknowledge cut-offs, and lack of knowledge attributions. Additionally, fine\ntuning LLMs' intrinsic knowledge to highly specific domains is an expensive and\ntime consuming process. The retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) process has\nrecently emerged as a method capable of optimization of LLM responses, by\nreferencing them to a predetermined ontology. It was shown that using a\nKnowledge Graph (KG) ontology for RAG improves the QA accuracy, by taking into\naccount relevant sub-graphs that preserve the information in a structured\nmanner. In this paper, we introduce SMART-SLIC, a highly domain-specific LLM\nframework, that integrates RAG with KG and a vector store (VS) that store\nfactual domain specific information. Importantly, to avoid hallucinations in\nthe KG, we build these highly domain-specific KGs and VSs without the use of\nLLMs, but via NLP, data mining, and nonnegative tensor factorization with\nautomatic model selection. Pairing our RAG with a domain-specific: (i) KG\n(containing structured information), and (ii) VS (containing unstructured\ninformation) enables the development of domain-specific chat-bots that\nattribute the source of information, mitigate hallucinations, lessen the need\nfor fine-tuning, and excel in highly domain-specific question answering tasks.\nWe pair SMART-SLIC with chain-of-thought prompting agents.

The study introduces a novel and efficient format for\nthe representation of code modification, using advanced Large Language Models\n(LLMs) such as Code Llama and Mistral. These models, fine-tuned on datasets\nfeaturing C code vulnerabilities, significantly improve the accuracy and\nadaptability of automated code repair techniques. A key finding is the enhanced\nrepair accuracy of these models when compared to previous methods such as\nVulRepair, which underscores their practical utility and efficiency. The\nresearch also offers a critical assessment of current evaluation metrics, such\nas perfect predictions, and their limitations in reflecting the true\ncapabilities of automated repair models in real-world scenarios. Following\nthis, it underscores the importance of using test datasets devoid of train\nsamples, emphasizing the need for dataset integrity to enhance the\neffectiveness of LLMs in code repair tasks. The significance of this work is\nits contribution to digital security, setting new standards for automated code\nvulnerability repair and paving the way for future advancements in the fields\nof cybersecurity and artificial intelligence. The study does not only highlight\nthe potential of LLMs in enhancing code security but also fosters further\nexploration and research in these crucial areas.",

However, such issue in vision-language\nmodels like CLIP, particularly after fine-tuning, has not been fully addressed.\nIn this work, we demonstrate that existing prompt tuning methods usually lead\nto a trade-off of calibration between base and new classes: the cross-entropy\nloss in CoOp causes overconfidence in new classes by increasing textual label\ndivergence, whereas the regularization of KgCoOp maintains the confidence level\nbut results in underconfidence in base classes due to the improved accuracy.\nInspired by the observations, we introduce Dynamic Outlier Regularization (DOR)\nto ensure the confidence calibration on both base and new classes after\nfine-tuning. In particular, we propose to minimize the feature deviation of\nnovel textual labels (instead of base classes) sampled from a large vocabulary.\nIn effect, DOR prevents the increase in textual divergence for new labels while\neasing restrictions on base classes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DOR\ncan enhance the calibration performance of current fine-tuning methods on base\nand new classes.",

However, such issue in vision-language\nmodels like CLIP, particularly after fine-tuning, has not been fully addressed.\nIn this work, we demonstrate that existing prompt tuning methods usually lead\nto a trade-off of calibration between base and new classes: the cross-entropy\nloss in CoOp causes overconfidence in new classes by increasing textual label\ndivergence, whereas the regularization of KgCoOp maintains the confidence level\nbut results in underconfidence in base classes due to the improved accuracy.\nInspired by the observations, we introduce Dynamic Outlier Regularization (DOR)\nto ensure the confidence calibration on both base and new classes after\nfine-tuning. In particular, we propose to minimize the feature deviation of\nnovel textual labels (instead of base classes) sampled from a large vocabulary.\nIn effect, DOR prevents the increase in textual divergence for new labels while\neasing restrictions on base classes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DOR\ncan enhance the calibration performance of current fine-tuning methods on base\nand new classes."

                "summary": "Recent advances in robotics are pushing real-world autonomy, enabling robots\nto perform long-term and large-scale missions. A crucial component for\nsuccessful missions is the incorporation of loop closures through place\nrecognition, which effectively mitigates accumulated pose estimation drift.\nDespite computational advancements, optimizing performance for real-time\ndeployment remains challenging, especially in resource-constrained mobile\nrobots and multi-robot systems since, conventional keyframe sampling practices\nin place recognition often result in retaining redundant information or\noverlooking relevant data, as they rely on fixed sampling intervals or work\ndirectly in the 3D space instead of the feature space. To address these\nconcerns, we introduce the concept of sample space in place recognition and\ndemonstrate how different sampling techniques affect the query process and\noverall performance. We then present a novel keyframe sampling approach for\nLiDAR-based place recognition, which focuses on redundancy minimization and\ninformation preservation in the hyper-dimensional descriptor space.

                    "value": "Recent advances in robotics are pushing real-world autonomy, enabling robots\nto perform long-term and large-scale missions. A crucial component for\nsuccessful missions is the incorporation of loop closures through place\nrecognition, which effectively mitigates accumulated pose estimation drift.\nDespite computational advancements, optimizing performance for real-time\ndeployment remains challenging, especially in resource-constrained mobile\nrobots and multi-robot systems since, conventional keyframe sampling practices\nin place recognition often result in retaining redundant information or\noverlooking relevant data, as they rely on fixed sampling intervals or work\ndirectly in the 3D space instead of the feature space. To address these\nconcerns, we introduce the concept of sample space in place recognition and\ndemonstrate how different sampling techniques affect the query process and\noverall performance. We then present a novel keyframe sampling approach for\nLiDAR-based place recognition, which focuses on redundancy minimization and\ninformation preservation in the hyper-dimensional descriptor space.

With strong language processing\ncapabilities and remarkable versatility, large language models (LLMs) have\nbecome popular choices for zero-shot re-ranking in IR systems. So far,\nLLM-based re-ranking methods rely on strong generative capabilities, which\nrestricts their use to either specialized or powerful proprietary models. Given\nthese restrictions, we ask: is autoregressive generation necessary and optimal\nfor LLMs to perform re-ranking? We hypothesize that there are abundant signals\nrelevant to re-ranking within LLMs that might not be used to their full\npotential via generation. To more directly leverage such signals, we propose\nin-context re-ranking (ICR), a novel method that leverages the change in\nattention pattern caused by the search query for accurate and efficient\nre-ranking. To mitigate the intrinsic biases in LLMs, we propose a calibration\nmethod using a content-free query. Due to the absence of generation, ICR only\nrequires two ($O(1)$) forward passes to re-rank $N$ documents, making it\nsubstantially more efficient than generative re-ranking methods that require at\nleast $O(N)$ forward passes. Our novel design also enables ICR to be applied to\nany LLM without specialized training while guaranteeing a well-formed ranking.\nExtensive experiments with two popular open-weight LLMs on standard single-hop\nand multi-hop information retrieval benchmarks show that ICR outperforms\nRankGPT while cutting the latency by more than 60% in practice. Through\ndetailed analyses, we show that ICR's performance is specially strong on tasks\nthat require more complex re-ranking signals.

This evolution is\nfostering the emergence of near-field communications (NFC) in future wireless\nsystems. Considerable attention has been directed towards this cutting-edge\ntechnology due to its potential to enhance the capacity of wireless networks by\nintroducing increased spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs) in the range domain.\nWithin this context, a comprehensive review of the state of the art on NFC is\npresented, with a specific focus on its 1) fundamental operating principles, 2)\nchannel modeling, 3) performance analysis, 4) signal processing techniques, and\n5) integration with other emerging applications.

As the first binarization\nmethod for diffusion models, W1A4 BinaryDM achieves impressive 15.2x OPs and\n29.2x model size savings, showcasing its substantial potential for edge\ndeployment."

To address this challenge, we introduce\nScylla, a dynamic evaluation framework that quantitatively measures the\ngeneralization abilities of LLMs. Scylla disentangles generalization from\nmemorization via assessing model performance on both in-distribution (ID) and\nout-of-distribution (OOD) data through 20 tasks across 5 levels of complexity.\nThrough extensive experiments, we uncover a non-monotonic relationship between\ntask complexity and the performance gap between ID and OOD data, which we term\nthe generalization valley. Specifically, this phenomenon reveals a critical\nthreshold - referred to as critical complexity - where reliance on\nnon-generalizable behavior peaks, indicating the upper bound of LLMs'\ngeneralization capabilities. As model size increases, the critical complexity\nshifts toward higher levels of task complexity, suggesting that larger models\ncan handle more complex reasoning tasks before over-relying on memorization.\nLeveraging Scylla and the concept of critical complexity, we benchmark 28LLMs\nincluding both open-sourced models such as LLaMA and Qwen families, and\nclose-sourced models like Claude and GPT, providing a more robust evaluation\nand establishing a clearer understanding of LLMs' generalization capabilities.",

                    "value": "While large language models (LLMs) have shown exceptional capabilities in\nunderstanding complex queries and performing sophisticated tasks, their\ngeneralization abilities are often deeply entangled with memorization,\nnecessitating more precise evaluation. To address this challenge, we introduce\nScylla, a dynamic evaluation framework that quantitatively measures the\ngeneralization abilities of LLMs. Scylla disentangles generalization from\nmemorization via assessing model performance on both in-distribution (ID) and\nout-of-distribution (OOD) data through 20 tasks across 5 levels of complexity.\nThrough extensive experiments, we uncover a non-monotonic relationship between\ntask complexity and the performance gap between ID and OOD data, which we term\nthe generalization valley. Specifically, this phenomenon reveals a critical\nthreshold - referred to as critical complexity - where reliance on\nnon-generalizable behavior peaks, indicating the upper bound of LLMs'\ngeneralization capabilities. As model size increases, the critical complexity\nshifts toward higher levels of task complexity, suggesting that larger models\ncan handle more complex reasoning tasks before over-relying on memorization.\nLeveraging Scylla and the concept of critical complexity, we benchmark 28LLMs\nincluding both open-sourced models such as LLaMA and Qwen families, and\nclose-sourced models like Claude and GPT, providing a more robust evaluation\nand establishing a clearer understanding of LLMs' generalization capabilities."

Technically,\n$\\texttt{AgentPrune}$ is the first to identify and formally define the\n\\textit{communication redundancy} issue present in current LLM-based\nmulti-agent pipelines, and efficiently performs one-shot pruning on the\nspatial-temporal message-passing graph, yielding a token-economic and\nhigh-performing communication topology. Extensive experiments across six\nbenchmarks demonstrate that $\\texttt{AgentPrune}$ \\textbf{(I)} achieves\ncomparable results as state-of-the-art topologies at merely $\\$5.6$ cost\ncompared to their $\\$43.7$, \\textbf{(II)} integrates seamlessly into existing\nmulti-agent frameworks with $28.1\\%\\sim72.8\\%\\downarrow$ token reduction, and\n\\textbf{(III)} successfully defend against two types of agent-based adversarial\nattacks with $3.5\\%\\sim10.8\\%\\uparrow$ performance boost."

It is often done by tuning the\nmodel or inserting preset aligning prompts. Recently, representation\nengineering, a method which alters the model's behavior via changing its\nrepresentations post-training, was shown to be effective in aligning LLMs (Zou\net al., 2023a). Representation engineering yields gains in alignment oriented\ntasks such as resistance to adversarial attacks and reduction of social biases,\nbut was also shown to cause a decrease in the ability of the model to perform\nbasic tasks. In this paper we study the tradeoff between the increase in\nalignment and decrease in helpfulness of the model. We propose a theoretical\nframework which provides bounds for these two quantities, and demonstrate their\nrelevance empirically. First, we find that under the conditions of our\nframework, alignment can be guaranteed with representation engineering, and at\nthe same time that helpfulness is harmed in the process. Second, we show that\nhelpfulness is harmed quadratically with the norm of the representation\nengineering vector, while the alignment increases linearly with it, indicating\na regime in which it is efficient to use representation engineering. We\nvalidate our findings empirically, and chart the boundaries to the usefulness\nof representation engineering for alignment.",
