It employs a smaller model to generate a\ndraft token sequence, which is then verified by the original base model. In\nmulti-GPU systems, inference latency can be further reduced through tensor\nparallelism (TP), while the optimal TP size of the draft model is typically\nsmaller than that of the base model, leading to GPU idling during the drafting\nstage. To solve this problem, we propose EasySpec, a layer-parallel speculation\nstrategy that optimizes the efficiency of multi-GPU utilization.EasySpec breaks\nthe sequential execution order of layers in the drafting model, enabling\nmulti-layer parallelization across devices, albeit with some induced\napproximation errors. After each drafting-and-verification iteration, the draft\nmodel's key-value (KV) cache is calibrated in a single forward pass, preventing\nlong-term error accumulation at minimal additional latency. We evaluated\nEasySpec on several mainstream open-source LLMs, using smaller versions of\nmodels from the same series as drafters. The results demonstrate that EasySpec\ncan achieve a peak speedup of 4.17x compared to vanilla decoding, while\npreserving the original distribution of the base LLMs. Specifically, the\ndrafting stage can be accelerated by up to 1.62x with a maximum accuracy drop\nof only 7%, requiring no training or fine-tuning on the draft models.",

While existing methods achieve impressive compression ratios on\nlong-context benchmarks, their effects on core model capabilities remain\nunderstudied. We present a comprehensive empirical study evaluating prominent\nKV cache compression methods across diverse tasks, spanning world knowledge,\ncommonsense reasoning, arithmetic reasoning, code generation, safety, and\nlong-context understanding and generation.Our analysis reveals that KV cache\ncompression methods exhibit task-specific performance degradation. Arithmetic\nreasoning tasks prove particularly sensitive to aggressive compression, with\ndifferent methods showing performance drops of $17.4\\%$-$43.3\\%$. Notably, the\nDeepSeek R1 Distill model exhibits more robust compression tolerance compared\nto instruction-tuned models, showing only $9.67\\%$-$25.53\\%$ performance\ndegradation. Based on our analysis of attention patterns and cross-task\ncompression performance, we propose ShotKV, a novel compression approach that\ndistinctly handles prefill and decoding phases while maintaining shot-level\nsemantic coherence. Empirical results show that ShotKV achieves $9\\%$-$18\\%$\nperformance improvements on long-context generation tasks under aggressive\ncompression ratios.",

                    "value": "This paper investigates an under-explored challenge in large language models\n(LLMs): the impact of KV cache compression methods on LLMs' fundamental\ncapabilities. While existing methods achieve impressive compression ratios on\nlong-context benchmarks, their effects on core model capabilities remain\nunderstudied. We present a comprehensive empirical study evaluating prominent\nKV cache compression methods across diverse tasks, spanning world knowledge,\ncommonsense reasoning, arithmetic reasoning, code generation, safety, and\nlong-context understanding and generation.Our analysis reveals that KV cache\ncompression methods exhibit task-specific performance degradation. Arithmetic\nreasoning tasks prove particularly sensitive to aggressive compression, with\ndifferent methods showing performance drops of $17.4\\%$-$43.3\\%$. Notably, the\nDeepSeek R1 Distill model exhibits more robust compression tolerance compared\nto instruction-tuned models, showing only $9.67\\%$-$25.53\\%$ performance\ndegradation. Based on our analysis of attention patterns and cross-task\ncompression performance, we propose ShotKV, a novel compression approach that\ndistinctly handles prefill and decoding phases while maintaining shot-level\nsemantic coherence. Empirical results show that ShotKV achieves $9\\%$-$18\\%$\nperformance improvements on long-context generation tasks under aggressive\ncompression ratios."

Two major factors affecting the latency and throughput are\nthe topology of links between chiplets and the chiplet placement. In this work,\nwe present PlaceIT, a novel methodology to jointly optimize the ICI topology\nand the chiplet placement. While state-of-the-art methods optimize the chiplet\nplacement for a predetermined ICI topology, or they select one topology out of\na set of candidates, we generate a completely new topology for each placement.\nOur process of inferring placement-based ICI topologies connects chiplets that\nare in close proximity to each other, making it particularly attractive for\nchips with silicon bridges or passive silicon interposers with severely limited\nlink lengths. We provide an open-source implementation of our method that\noptimizes the placement of homogeneously or heterogeneously shaped chiplets and\nthe ICI topology connecting them for a user-defined mix of four different\ntraffic types. We evaluate our methodology using synthetic traffic and traces,\nand we compare our results to a 2D mesh baseline. PlaceIT reduces the latency\nof synthetic L1-to-L2 and L2-to-memory traffic, the two most important types\nfor cache coherency traffic, by up to 28% and 62%, respectively.

In this work, we explore the potential of rotation\ntechnique for 2-bit KV quantization and propose RotateKV, which achieves\naccurate and robust performance through the following innovations: (i)\nOutlier-Aware Rotation, which utilizes channel-reordering to adapt the\nrotations to varying channel-wise outlier distributions without sacrificing the\ncomputational efficiency of the fast Walsh-Hadamard transform (FWHT); (ii)\nPre-RoPE Grouped-Head Rotation, which mitigates the impact of rotary position\nembedding (RoPE) on proposed outlier-aware rotation and further smooths\noutliers across heads; (iii) Attention-Sink-Aware Quantization, which leverages\nthe massive activations to precisely identify and protect attention sinks.\nRotateKV achieves less than 0.3 perplexity (PPL) degradation with 2-bit\nquantization on WikiText-2 using LLaMA-2-13B, maintains strong CoT reasoning\nand long-context capabilities, with less than 1.7\\% degradation on GSM8K,\noutperforming existing methods even at lower average bit-widths.

Most\nof these algorithms involve multiple passes over a transformer model to\ngenerate tokens or denoise inputs. However, the model size is kept consistent\nthroughout all iterations, which makes it computationally expensive. In this\nwork, we aim to address this issue primarily through two key ideas - (a) not\nall parts of the generation process need equal compute, and we design a decode\ntime model scaling schedule to utilize compute effectively, and (b) we can\ncache and reuse some of the computation. Combining these two ideas leads to\nusing smaller models to process more tokens while large models process fewer\ntokens. These different-sized models do not increase the parameter size, as\nthey share parameters. We rigorously experiment with ImageNet256$\\times$256 ,\nUCF101, and Kinetics600 to showcase the efficacy of the proposed method for\nimage/video generation and frame prediction.

However, the model size is kept consistent\nthroughout all iterations, which makes it computationally expensive. In this\nwork, we aim to address this issue primarily through two key ideas - (a) not\nall parts of the generation process need equal compute, and we design a decode\ntime model scaling schedule to utilize compute effectively, and (b) we can\ncache and reuse some of the computation. Combining these two ideas leads to\nusing smaller models to process more tokens while large models process fewer\ntokens. These different-sized models do not increase the parameter size, as\nthey share parameters. We rigorously experiment with ImageNet256$\\times$256 ,\nUCF101, and Kinetics600 to showcase the efficacy of the proposed method for\nimage/video generation and frame prediction. Our experiments show that with\nalmost $3\\times$ less compute than baseline, our model obtains competitive\nperformance."

                "summary": "Efficient real-world deployments of large language models (LLMs) rely on\nKey-Value (KV) caching for processing and generating long outputs, reducing the\nneed for repetitive computation. For large contexts, Key-Value caches can take\nup tens of gigabytes of device memory, as they store vector representations for\neach token and layer. Recent work has shown that the cached vectors can be\ncompressed through quantization, pruning or merging, but these techniques often\ncompromise quality towards higher compression rates. In this work, we aim to\nimprove Key & Value compression by exploiting two observations: 1) the inherent\ndependencies between keys and values across different layers, and 2)\nhigh-compression mechanisms for internal network states. We propose AQUA-KV, an\nadaptive quantization for Key-Value caches that relies on compact adapters to\nexploit existing dependencies between Keys and Values, and aims to \"optimally\"\ncompress the information that cannot be predicted. AQUA-KV significantly\nimproves compression rates, while maintaining high accuracy on state-of-the-art\nLLM families. On Llama 3.2 LLMs, we achieve near-lossless inference at 2-2.5\nbits per value with under $1\\%$ relative error in perplexity and LongBench\nscores. AQUA-KV is one-shot, simple, and efficient: it can be calibrated on a\nsingle GPU within 1-6 hours, even for 70B models.",

For large contexts, Key-Value caches can take\nup tens of gigabytes of device memory, as they store vector representations for\neach token and layer. Recent work has shown that the cached vectors can be\ncompressed through quantization, pruning or merging, but these techniques often\ncompromise quality towards higher compression rates.

The doorway arrival phase and the release operation both run in\nconstant-time. Waiting threads use local spinning and only a single waiting\nelement is required per thread, regardless of the number of locks a thread\nmight hold at a given time. While our lock does not provide strict FIFO\nadmission, it bounds bypass and has strong anti-starvation properties. The lock\nis compact, space efficient, and has been intentionally designed to be readily\nusable in real-world general purpose computing environments such as the linux\nkernel, pthreads, or C++. We show the lock exhibits high throughput under\ncontention and low latency in the uncontended case. The performance of\nReciprocating Locks is competitive with and often better than the best\nstate-of-the-art scalable spin locks.",

The doorway arrival phase and the release operation both run in\nconstant-time. Waiting threads use local spinning and only a single waiting\nelement is required per thread, regardless of the number of locks a thread\nmight hold at a given time. While our lock does not provide strict FIFO\nadmission, it bounds bypass and has strong anti-starvation properties. The lock\nis compact, space efficient, and has been intentionally designed to be readily\nusable in real-world general purpose computing environments such as the linux\nkernel, pthreads, or C++. We show the lock exhibits high throughput under\ncontention and low latency in the uncontended case. The performance of\nReciprocating Locks is competitive with and often better than the best\nstate-of-the-art scalable spin locks."

Signal-level CC\nschemes require the regeneration and cancellation of interfering signals at the\nphysical layer of each receiver, which complicates practical implementations.\nTo address this, we propose a bit-level multicast scheduling scheme enabling\nlinear, SIC-free decoding of parallel streams by repeatedly transmitting data\nterms with linearly independent coefficients. Two reference strategies and a\nnovel sparse strategy are considered for constructing the coefficient matrix.\nThe reference cases include the random strategy, which lacks control over\nmatrix construction, and the equal-distant strategy, which balances users'\ninterference and data terms equally. In contrast, the sparse strategy minimizes\nthe number of multicast streams transmitted in parallel during each interval.\nThis approach simplifies both the decoding process and the beamforming design\nby decoupling the desired data terms for each user and reducing the number of\nSINR constraints, respectively. To further enhance the symmetric rate, a\nsuccessive projection algorithm is applied to exploit channel properties and\noptimize user ordering. With the coefficient matrix and optimized user ordering\nin place, multicast beamformers are devised to aggregate desired data from\nrelevant multicast streams. Numerical simulations validate the effectiveness of\nthe sparse strategy and user scheduling, demonstrating significant gains in\nsymmetric rate.",

                    "value": "Multi-antenna coded caching (CC) with multicast beamforming typically relies\non a complex successive interference cancellation (SIC) structure to decode a\nsuperposition of multiple streams received by each user. Signal-level CC\nschemes require the regeneration and cancellation of interfering signals at the\nphysical layer of each receiver, which complicates practical implementations.\nTo address this, we propose a bit-level multicast scheduling scheme enabling\nlinear, SIC-free decoding of parallel streams by repeatedly transmitting data\nterms with linearly independent coefficients. Two reference strategies and a\nnovel sparse strategy are considered for constructing the coefficient matrix.\nThe reference cases include the random strategy, which lacks control over\nmatrix construction, and the equal-distant strategy, which balances users'\ninterference and data terms equally. In contrast, the sparse strategy minimizes\nthe number of multicast streams transmitted in parallel during each interval.\nThis approach simplifies both the decoding process and the beamforming design\nby decoupling the desired data terms for each user and reducing the number of\nSINR constraints, respectively. To further enhance the symmetric rate, a\nsuccessive projection algorithm is applied to exploit channel properties and\noptimize user ordering. With the coefficient matrix and optimized user ordering\nin place, multicast beamformers are devised to aggregate desired data from\nrelevant multicast streams. Numerical simulations validate the effectiveness of\nthe sparse strategy and user scheduling, demonstrating significant gains in\nsymmetric rate."

The\nessence of these tasks is to select and save a subset of the most useful\ncandidates (views/indexes/plans) for reuse within given space/time budget\nconstraints. In this paper, we propose a unified view on these selection\nproblems. We make a detailed analysis of the root causes of their complexity\nand summarize techniques to address them. Our survey provides a modern\nclassification of selection algorithms known in the literature, including the\nlatest ones based on Machine Learning. We provide a ground for reuse of the\nselection techniques between different optimization scenarios and highlight\nchallenges and promising directions in the field. Based on our analysis we\nderive a method to exponentially accelerate some of the state-of-the-art\nselection algorithms."

We\nprefer to design a coded caching scheme with the subpacketization $F$ and\ntransmission load $R$ as small as possible since these are the key metrics for\nevaluating the implementation complexity and transmission efficiency of the\nscheme, respectively. However, most of the existing coded caching schemes have\nlarge subpacketizations which grow exponentially with the number of users $K$,\nand there are a few schemes with linear subpacketizations which have large\ntransmission loads. In this paper, we focus on studying the linear\nsubpacketization, i.e., $K=F$, coded caching scheme with low transmission load.\nSpecifically, we first introduce a new combinatorial structure called\nnon-half-sum disjoint packing (NHSDP) which can be used to generate a coded\ncaching scheme with $K=F$. Then a class of new schemes is obtained by\nconstructing NHSDP. Theoretical and numerical comparisons show that (i)\ncompared to the existing schemes with linear subpacketization (to the number of\nusers), the proposed scheme achieves a lower load; (ii) compared to some\nexisting schemes with polynomial subpacketization, the proposed scheme can also\nachieve a lower load in some cases; (iii) compared to some existing schemes\nwith exponential subpacketization, the proposed scheme has loads close to those\nof these schemes in some cases. Moreover, the new concept of NHSDP is closely\nrelated to the classical combinatorial structures such as cyclic difference\npacking (CDP), non-three-term arithmetic progressions (NTAP), and perfect hash\nfamily (PHF).

Unlike stateless computation\noffloading and static service offloading in edge computing, optimizing LLM\nserving at edge servers is challenging because LLMs continuously learn from\ncontext which raises accuracy, latency, and resource consumption dynamics.

In this\nframework, we analyze the performance convergence and design an optimization\nproblem considering the utilization of context windows in LLMs. Furthermore,\nthe T2DRL algorithm can learn in both the training phase and the testing phase\nto proactively manage cached models and service requests and adapt to context\nchanges and usage patterns during execution. To further enhance resource\nallocation efficiency, we propose a double Dutch auction (DDA) mechanism, which\ndynamically matches supply and demand while maximizing social welfare.

A two-plutonium sources mixture model\n(Palomares and fallout) is used to elucidate the percentage of the plutonium\ncoming from the accident. As a validation exercise of the Pu AMS measuring\ntechnique and in order to obtain the 238Pu/(239+240)Pu activity ratios, samples\nwere also studied by alpha-spectrometry (AS).

It achieves exceptional performance, ranking 6th overall\non Chatbot Arena, with particularly strong results (2nd to 4th place) in\nspecialized categories including Chinese, Math, Coding, and Hard Prompts.\nYi-Lightning leverages an enhanced Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture,\nfeaturing advanced expert segmentation and routing mechanisms coupled with\noptimized KV-caching techniques. Our development process encompasses\ncomprehensive pre-training, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and reinforcement\nlearning from human feedback (RLHF), where we devise deliberate strategies for\nmulti-stage training, synthetic data construction, and reward modeling.\nFurthermore, we implement RAISE (Responsible AI Safety Engine), a\nfour-component framework to address safety issues across pre-training,\npost-training, and serving phases. Empowered by our scalable super-computing\ninfrastructure, all these innovations substantially reduce training, deployment\nand inference costs while maintaining high-performance standards. With further\nevaluations on public academic benchmarks, Yi-Lightning demonstrates\ncompetitive performance against top-tier LLMs, while we observe a notable\ndisparity between traditional, static benchmark results and real-world, dynamic\nhuman preferences. This observation prompts a critical reassessment of\nconventional benchmarks' utility in guiding the development of more intelligent\nand powerful AI systems for practical applications.

However, this MACC network\nhas not yet been studied under multi-antenna settings in the coded caching\nliterature.

Two\nschemes resulting from the above constructions achieve optimal performance\nunder uncoded placement and one-shot delivery. The optimality is shown by\nmatching the performance of the multi-antenna MACC scheme to that of an optimal\nmulti-antenna scheme for a dedicated cache network having an identical number\nof users, and each user has a normalized cache size of $rM/N$.

Standard operator inference models\nperform well with accurate training data that are dense in time, but producing\nstable and accurate models when the state data are noisy and/or sparse in time\nremains a challenge. Another challenge is the lack of uncertainty estimation\nfor the predictions from the operator inference models. Our approach addresses\nthese challenges by incorporating Gaussian process surrogates into the operator\ninference framework to (1) probabilistically describe uncertainties in the\nstate predictions and (2) procure analytical time derivative estimates with\nquantified uncertainties. The formulation leads to a generalized least-squares\nregression and, ultimately, reduced-order models that are described\nprobabilistically with a closed-form expression for the posterior distribution\nof the operators. The resulting probabilistic surrogate model propagates\nuncertainties from the observed state data to reduced-order predictions. We\ndemonstrate the method is effective for constructing low-dimensional models of\ntwo nonlinear partial differential equations representing a compressible flow\nand a nonlinear diffusion-reaction process, as well as for estimating the\nparameters of a low-dimensional system of nonlinear ordinary differential\nequations representing compartmental models in epidemiology.",

In this\npaper, we investigate the family of acceleration methods that involve both\nstructured pruning and model training.

Experimental results on LLaMA-3.1-8B demonstrate that\nAdapt-Pruner outperforms conventional pruning methods, such as LLM-Pruner,\nFLAP, and SliceGPT, by an average of 1%-7% in accuracy on commonsense\nbenchmarks. Additionally, Adapt-Pruner restores the performance of\nMobileLLM-125M to 600M on the MMLU benchmark with 200$\\times$ fewer tokens via\npruning from its larger counterparts, and discovers a new 1B model that\nsurpasses LLaMA-3.2-1B in multiple benchmarks.",

Two agents collaborate\niteratively, enabling sequential reasoning and adaptive attention to graph\ninformation. Unlike prior works, both agents are prompted only with the scene\ngraph schema rather than the full graph data, which reduces the hallucination\nby limiting input tokens, and drives the Reasoner to generate reasoning trace\nabstractly.Following the trace, the Retriever programmatically query the scene\ngraph data based on the schema understanding, allowing dynamic and global\nattention on the graph that enhances alignment between reasoning and retrieval.\nThrough experiments in multiple simulation environments, we show that our\nframework surpasses existing LLM-based approaches in numerical Q\\&A and\nplanning tasks, and can benefit from task-level few-shot examples, even in the\nabsence of agent-level demonstrations.

We first propose 17 design considerations\nacross four major categories, derived from a comprehensive review of previous\nresearch. Next, we developed a system called AIroad, which leverages LLMs to\nsimulate drivers with varying social intents, expressed through explicit\nmultimodal social signals. AIroad helps autistic children bridge the gap in\nrecognizing the intentions behind behaviors and learning appropriate responses\nthrough various stimuli. A user study involving 14 participants demonstrated\nthat this technology effectively engages autistic children and leads to\nsignificant improvements in their comprehension of social affordances in\ntraffic scenarios. Additionally, parents reported high perceived usability of\nthe system. These findings highlight the potential of combining LLM technology\nwith immersive environments for the functional rehabilitation of autistic\nchildren in the future.",

While the existing\napproaches primarily rely on value functions and Monte Carlo Tree Search\n(MCTS), the potential of simpler methods like Best-First Search (BFS) remains\nunderexplored. This paper investigates whether BFS can achieve competitive\nperformance in large-scale theorem proving tasks. We present\n\\texttt{BFS-Prover}, a scalable expert iteration framework, featuring three key\ninnovations.

While the existing\napproaches primarily rely on value functions and Monte Carlo Tree Search\n(MCTS), the potential of simpler methods like Best-First Search (BFS) remains\nunderexplored. This paper investigates whether BFS can achieve competitive\nperformance in large-scale theorem proving tasks.

                "summary": "Point cloud registration is a prerequisite for many applications in computer\nvision and robotics. Most existing methods focus on pairwise registration of\ntwo point clouds with high overlap. Although there have been some methods for\nlow overlap cases, they struggle in degraded scenarios. This paper introduces a\nnovel framework dubbed L-PR, designed to register unordered low overlap\nmultiview point clouds leveraging LiDAR fiducial markers. We refer to them as\nLiDAR fiducial markers, but they are the same as the popular AprilTag and ArUco\nmarkers, thin sheets of paper that do not affect the 3D geometry of the\nenvironment. We first propose an improved adaptive threshold marker detection\nmethod to provide robust detection results when the viewpoints among point\nclouds change dramatically. Then, we formulate the unordered multiview point\ncloud registration problem as a maximum a-posteriori (MAP) problem and develop\na framework consisting of two levels of graphs to address it. The first-level\ngraph, constructed as a weighted graph, is designed to efficiently and\noptimally infer initial values of scan poses from the unordered set. The\nsecond-level graph is constructed as a factor graph. By globally optimizing the\nvariables on the graph, including scan poses, marker poses, and marker corner\npositions, we tackle the MAP problem. We conduct both qualitative and\nquantitative experiments to demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses\nprevious state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods and to showcase that L-PR can serve as\na low-cost and efficient tool for 3D asset collection and training data\ncollection. In particular, we collect a new dataset named Livox-3DMatch using\nL-PR and incorporate it into the training of the SOTA learning-based method,\nSGHR, which brings evident improvements for SGHR on various benchmarks.",

Knowledge Graph\n(KG)-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses these issues by\ngrounding LLM outputs in structured external knowledge from KGs. However,\ncurrent KG-based RAG frameworks still struggle to optimize the trade-off\nbetween retrieval effectiveness and efficiency in identifying a suitable amount\nof relevant graph information for the LLM to digest. We introduce SubgraphRAG,\nextending the KG-based RAG framework that retrieves subgraphs and leverages\nLLMs for reasoning and answer prediction. Our approach innovatively integrates\na lightweight multilayer perceptron with a parallel triple-scoring mechanism\nfor efficient and flexible subgraph retrieval while encoding directional\nstructural distances to enhance retrieval effectiveness. The size of retrieved\nsubgraphs can be flexibly adjusted to match the query's need and the downstream\nLLM's capabilities. This design strikes a balance between model complexity and\nreasoning power, enabling scalable and generalizable retrieval processes.\nNotably, based on our retrieved subgraphs, smaller LLMs like\nLlama3.1-8B-Instruct deliver competitive results with explainable reasoning,\nwhile larger models like GPT-4o achieve state-of-the-art accuracy compared with\nprevious baselines -- all without fine-tuning. Extensive evaluations on the\nWebQSP and CWQ benchmarks highlight SubgraphRAG's strengths in efficiency,\naccuracy, and reliability by reducing hallucinations and improving response\ngrounding.",

However,\ncurrent KG-based RAG frameworks still struggle to optimize the trade-off\nbetween retrieval effectiveness and efficiency in identifying a suitable amount\nof relevant graph information for the LLM to digest. We introduce SubgraphRAG,\nextending the KG-based RAG framework that retrieves subgraphs and leverages\nLLMs for reasoning and answer prediction. Our approach innovatively integrates\na lightweight multilayer perceptron with a parallel triple-scoring mechanism\nfor efficient and flexible subgraph retrieval while encoding directional\nstructural distances to enhance retrieval effectiveness. The size of retrieved\nsubgraphs can be flexibly adjusted to match the query's need and the downstream\nLLM's capabilities. This design strikes a balance between model complexity and\nreasoning power, enabling scalable and generalizable retrieval processes.\nNotably, based on our retrieved subgraphs, smaller LLMs like\nLlama3.1-8B-Instruct deliver competitive results with explainable reasoning,\nwhile larger models like GPT-4o achieve state-of-the-art accuracy compared with\nprevious baselines -- all without fine-tuning. Extensive evaluations on the\nWebQSP and CWQ benchmarks highlight SubgraphRAG's strengths in efficiency,\naccuracy, and reliability by reducing hallucinations and improving response\ngrounding."

In this paper, we introduce SymAgent, an\ninnovative neural-symbolic agent framework that achieves collaborative\naugmentation between KGs and LLMs. We conceptualize KGs as dynamic environments\nand transform complex reasoning tasks into a multi-step interactive process,\nenabling KGs to participate deeply in the reasoning process.

Its\nsimplicity lends CARROT computational efficiency, while our theoretical\nanalysis demonstrates minimax rate-optimality in its routing performance.\nAlongside CARROT, we also introduce the Smart Price-aware Routing (SPROUT)\ndataset to facilitate routing on a wide spectrum of queries with the latest\nstate-of-the-art LLMs. Using SPROUT and prior benchmarks such as Routerbench\nand open-LLM-leaderboard-v2 we empirically validate CARROT's performance\nagainst several alternative routers."

We investigate the LLM-generated code security\nacross different settings through extensive experiments using four major LLMs,\ntwo retrievers, and two poisoning scenarios. Our findings highlight the\nsignificant threat of knowledge base poisoning, where even a single poisoned\ncode example can compromise up to 48% of generated code. Our findings provide\ncrucial insights into vulnerability introduction in RACG systems and offer\npractical mitigation recommendations, thereby helping improve the security of\nLLM-generated code in future works."

Our results suggest that LLMs (except Llama) are rather\nsuccessful in identifying the underlying strategic environment and adopting the\nstrategies to the changing set of parameters of the game in the same way that\nhuman players do. All LLMs still fail to play dominant strategies in a\ntwo-player game. Our results contribute to the discussion on the accuracy of\nmodeling human economic agents by artificial intelligence."

Our\nresults demonstrate that fine-tuned smaller models achieve comparable\nperformance to larger models in task-specific contexts while offering\nsignificant resource efficiency. Furthermore, we investigate the effects of\nprompt engineering and fine-tuning on model outputs, providing insights into\nperformance variability and instruction sensitivity. By making the dataset,\nimplementation code, and models publicly available, we establish a robust\nfoundation for future research in Arabic legal NLP."

Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting partially addresses this by\nrevealing intermediate reasoning steps, but the knowledge flow and application\nremain implicit. We introduce IAO (Input-Action-Output) prompting, a structured\ntemplate-based method that explicitly models how LLMs access and apply their\nknowledge during complex reasoning tasks. IAO decomposes problems into\nsequential steps, each clearly identifying the input knowledge being used, the\naction being performed, and the resulting output. This structured decomposition\nenables us to trace knowledge flow, verify factual consistency, and identify\npotential knowledge gaps or misapplications. Through experiments across diverse\nreasoning tasks, we demonstrate that IAO not only improves zero-shot\nperformance but also provides transparency in how LLMs leverage their stored\nknowledge. Human evaluation confirms that this structured approach enhances our\nability to verify knowledge utilization and detect potential hallucinations or\nreasoning errors. Our findings provide insights into both knowledge\nrepresentation within LLMs and methods for more reliable knowledge application.",

                    "value": "While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive reasoning\ncapabilities, understanding and validating their knowledge utilization remains\nchallenging. Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting partially addresses this by\nrevealing intermediate reasoning steps, but the knowledge flow and application\nremain implicit. We introduce IAO (Input-Action-Output) prompting, a structured\ntemplate-based method that explicitly models how LLMs access and apply their\nknowledge during complex reasoning tasks. IAO decomposes problems into\nsequential steps, each clearly identifying the input knowledge being used, the\naction being performed, and the resulting output. This structured decomposition\nenables us to trace knowledge flow, verify factual consistency, and identify\npotential knowledge gaps or misapplications. Through experiments across diverse\nreasoning tasks, we demonstrate that IAO not only improves zero-shot\nperformance but also provides transparency in how LLMs leverage their stored\nknowledge. Human evaluation confirms that this structured approach enhances our\nability to verify knowledge utilization and detect potential hallucinations or\nreasoning errors. Our findings provide insights into both knowledge\nrepresentation within LLMs and methods for more reliable knowledge application."

Two agents collaborate\niteratively, enabling sequential reasoning and adaptive attention to graph\ninformation. Unlike prior works, both agents are prompted only with the scene\ngraph schema rather than the full graph data, which reduces the hallucination\nby limiting input tokens, and drives the Reasoner to generate reasoning trace\nabstractly.Following the trace, the Retriever programmatically query the scene\ngraph data based on the schema understanding, allowing dynamic and global\nattention on the graph that enhances alignment between reasoning and retrieval.\nThrough experiments in multiple simulation environments, we show that our\nframework surpasses existing LLM-based approaches in numerical Q\\&A and\nplanning tasks, and can benefit from task-level few-shot examples, even in the\nabsence of agent-level demonstrations.

We first propose 17 design considerations\nacross four major categories, derived from a comprehensive review of previous\nresearch. Next, we developed a system called AIroad, which leverages LLMs to\nsimulate drivers with varying social intents, expressed through explicit\nmultimodal social signals. AIroad helps autistic children bridge the gap in\nrecognizing the intentions behind behaviors and learning appropriate responses\nthrough various stimuli. A user study involving 14 participants demonstrated\nthat this technology effectively engages autistic children and leads to\nsignificant improvements in their comprehension of social affordances in\ntraffic scenarios. Additionally, parents reported high perceived usability of\nthe system. These findings highlight the potential of combining LLM technology\nwith immersive environments for the functional rehabilitation of autistic\nchildren in the future.",

However, its theoretical reduction in\nFLOPs has rarely translated into wall-clock speed-up over its dense attention\ncounterparts due to the lack of hardware-aware optimizations like\nFlashAttention. Meanwhile, it remains unclear whether sparse attention can\nmaintain the model's quality at a scale of today's large language models (LLMs)\nand how. This paper presents Sparsely-Sharded(S2) Attention, a Triton library\nthat provides kernel optimization for sparse attention customizable at both\nper-head and per-context-range levels. S2-Attention enables the exploration of\nnovel and high-performance sparse attention techniques, which we demonstrate\nthrough extensive ablations across a wide range of sparse attention designs at\nvarious model scales. From these insights, we present several basic guidelines\nto design sparse attention that can achieve not only practical efficiency\nimprovements, but also strong downstream performance. To achieve high\nparallelization and optimized memory IO, sparse attention should shard the\ncontext heterogeneously across attention heads, where each head attends to a\ndifferent subset of tokens while collectively covering the full context.\nMeanwhile, we find hybrid architectures combining sparse and dense attention\nparticularly beneficial in practice. S2-Attention achieves wall-clock speedup\nof 8.79X, 15.87X, 25.3X compared to the strong FlashAttention-2 baseline with\nstrong downstream performance on-par with full attention and perfect retrieval\nperformance at a 128k context length. At inference, for 7B models, our model,\nwith the help of our S2-Attention kernel, achieves 4.5x speed-up compared to\ndense counterparts.

Our results show up to 18x slowdown on FreshQA dataset and 46x\nslowdown on SQuAD dataset. The attack also shows high transferability across\nmodels. To protect applications, we discuss and implement defenses leveraging\nLLM-based and system design approaches. Finally, we discuss societal,\nfinancial, and energy impacts of OVERTHINK attack which could amplify the costs\nfor third-party applications operating reasoning models."

This rise in energy demand poses significant challenges to\nresource availability and raises sustainability concerns for large-scale IoT\ndeployments. Efficient energy utilization in communication networks,\nparticularly for power-constrained IoT devices, has thus become a critical area\nof research. In this paper, we deployed flying LoRa gateways (GWs) mounted on\nunmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to collect data from LoRa end devices (EDs) and\ntransmit it to a central server. Our primary objective is to maximize the\nglobal system energy efficiency (EE) of wireless LoRa networks by joint\noptimization of transmission power (TP), spreading factor (SF), bandwidth (W),\nand ED association. To solve this challenging problem, we model the problem as\na partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), where each flying LoRa\nGW acts as a learning agent using a cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement\nLearning (MARL) approach under centralized training and decentralized execution\n(CTDE). Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed method, based on the\nmulti-agent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO) algorithm, significantly\nimproves the global system EE and surpasses the conventional MARL schemes.",

However, smaller models\nsuch as Llama-3-8B and DeepSeekMath-Base still struggle with complex\nmathematical reasoning because they fail to effectively identify and correct\nreasoning errors. Recent reflection-based methods aim to address these issues\nby enabling self-reflection and self-correction, but they still face challenges\nin independently detecting errors in their reasoning steps. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose SuperCorrect, a novel two-stage framework that uses a\nlarge teacher model to supervise and correct both the reasoning and reflection\nprocesses of a smaller student model. In the first stage, we extract\nhierarchical high-level and detailed thought templates from the teacher model\nto guide the student model in eliciting more fine-grained reasoning thoughts.\nIn the second stage, we introduce cross-model collaborative direct preference\noptimization (DPO) to enhance the self-correction abilities of the student\nmodel by following the teacher's correction traces during training. This\ncross-model DPO approach teaches the student model to effectively locate and\nresolve erroneous thoughts with error-driven insights from the teacher model,\nbreaking the bottleneck of its thoughts and acquiring new skills and knowledge\nto tackle challenging problems. Extensive experiments consistently demonstrate\nour superiority over previous methods. Notably, our SuperCorrect-7B model\nsignificantly surpasses powerful DeepSeekMath-7B by 7.8%/5.3% and\nQwen2.5-Math-7B by 15.1%/6.3% on MATH/GSM8K benchmarks, achieving new SOTA\nperformance among all 7B models.

Traditional modeling approaches, such as rule-based Agent-Based Models\n(ABMs), struggle to capture the diversity and complexity of human behavior,\nparticularly the irrational factors emphasized in behavioral economics.\nRecently, large language model (LLM) agents have gained traction as simulation\ntools for modeling human behavior in social science and role-playing\napplications. Studies suggest that LLMs can account for cognitive biases,\nemotional fluctuations, and other non-rational influences, enabling more\nrealistic simulations of socio-economic dynamics. In this work, we introduce\nTwinMarket, a novel multi-agent framework that leverages LLMs to simulate\nsocio-economic systems. Specifically, we examine how individual behaviors,\nthrough interactions and feedback mechanisms, give rise to collective dynamics\nand emergent phenomena. Through experiments in a simulated stock market\nenvironment, we demonstrate how individual actions can trigger group behaviors,\nleading to emergent outcomes such as financial bubbles and recessions.

                    "value": "The study of social emergence has long been a central focus in social\nscience. Traditional modeling approaches, such as rule-based Agent-Based Models\n(ABMs), struggle to capture the diversity and complexity of human behavior,\nparticularly the irrational factors emphasized in behavioral economics.\nRecently, large language model (LLM) agents have gained traction as simulation\ntools for modeling human behavior in social science and role-playing\napplications. Studies suggest that LLMs can account for cognitive biases,\nemotional fluctuations, and other non-rational influences, enabling more\nrealistic simulations of socio-economic dynamics. In this work, we introduce\nTwinMarket, a novel multi-agent framework that leverages LLMs to simulate\nsocio-economic systems. Specifically, we examine how individual behaviors,\nthrough interactions and feedback mechanisms, give rise to collective dynamics\nand emergent phenomena. Through experiments in a simulated stock market\nenvironment, we demonstrate how individual actions can trigger group behaviors,\nleading to emergent outcomes such as financial bubbles and recessions. Our\napproach provides valuable insights into the complex interplay between\nindividual decision-making and collective socio-economic patterns."

Humanoid robots pose significant safety risks due to their\nphysical capabilities of interacting with complex environments. The physical\nstructures of humanoid robots further add complexity to the design of general\nsafety solutions. To facilitate the safe deployment of complex robot systems,\nSPARK can be used as a toolbox that comes with state-of-the-art safe control\nalgorithms in a modular and composable robot control framework. Users can\neasily configure safety criteria and sensitivity levels to optimize the balance\nbetween safety and performance. To accelerate humanoid safety research and\ndevelopment, SPARK provides a simulation benchmark that compares safety\napproaches in a variety of environments, tasks, and robot models. Furthermore,\nSPARK allows quick deployment of synthesized safe controllers on real robots.\nFor hardware deployment, SPARK supports Apple Vision Pro (AVP) or a Motion\nCapture System as external sensors, while also offering interfaces for seamless\nintegration with alternative hardware setups. This paper demonstrates SPARK's\ncapability with both simulation experiments and case studies with a Unitree G1\nhumanoid robot. Leveraging these advantages of SPARK, users and researchers can\nsignificantly improve the safety of their humanoid systems as well as\naccelerate relevant research.

                "summary": "With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), numerous\nReinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) algorithms have been\nintroduced to improve model safety and alignment with human preferences. These\nalgorithms can be divided into two main frameworks based on whether they\nrequire an explicit reward (or value) function for training: actor-critic-based\nProximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and alignment-based Direct Preference\nOptimization (DPO). The mismatch between DPO and PPO, such as DPO's use of a\nclassification loss driven by human-preferred data, has raised confusion about\nwhether DPO should be classified as a Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm.

                    "value": "With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), numerous\nReinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) algorithms have been\nintroduced to improve model safety and alignment with human preferences. These\nalgorithms can be divided into two main frameworks based on whether they\nrequire an explicit reward (or value) function for training: actor-critic-based\nProximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and alignment-based Direct Preference\nOptimization (DPO). The mismatch between DPO and PPO, such as DPO's use of a\nclassification loss driven by human-preferred data, has raised confusion about\nwhether DPO should be classified as a Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm.

Through\nextensive experiments, we identify empirical scaling laws that describe how\nperformance depends on dataset size and model configuration. Particularly, we\nshow that, while scaling these factors improves performance, there is a novel\ninteraction term between the dense and upcycled training dataset that limits\nthe efficiency of upcycling at large computational budgets. Based on these\nfindings, we provide guidance to scale upcycling, and establish conditions\nunder which upcycling outperforms from-scratch trainings within budget\nconstraints."

However, we\nobserve that existing benchmarks present several common barriers that make it\ndifficult to measure the significant challenges that models face in the real\nworld, including: 1) small data scale leads to a large performance variance; 2)\nreliance on model-based annotations results in restricted data quality; 3)\ninsufficient task difficulty, especially caused by the limited image\nresolution. To tackle these issues, we introduce MME-RealWorld. Specifically,\nwe collect more than $300$K images from public datasets and the Internet,\nfiltering $13,366$ high-quality images for annotation. This involves the\nefforts of professional $25$ annotators and $7$ experts in MLLMs, contributing\nto $29,429$ question-answer pairs that cover $43$ subtasks across $5$\nreal-world scenarios, extremely challenging even for humans. As far as we know,\nMME-RealWorld is the largest manually annotated benchmark to date, featuring\nthe highest resolution and a targeted focus on real-world applications. We\nfurther conduct a thorough evaluation involving $28$ prominent MLLMs, such as\nGPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet.

                    "value": "Comprehensive evaluation of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has\nrecently garnered widespread attention in the research community. However, we\nobserve that existing benchmarks present several common barriers that make it\ndifficult to measure the significant challenges that models face in the real\nworld, including: 1) small data scale leads to a large performance variance; 2)\nreliance on model-based annotations results in restricted data quality; 3)\ninsufficient task difficulty, especially caused by the limited image\nresolution. To tackle these issues, we introduce MME-RealWorld. Specifically,\nwe collect more than $300$K images from public datasets and the Internet,\nfiltering $13,366$ high-quality images for annotation. This involves the\nefforts of professional $25$ annotators and $7$ experts in MLLMs, contributing\nto $29,429$ question-answer pairs that cover $43$ subtasks across $5$\nreal-world scenarios, extremely challenging even for humans. As far as we know,\nMME-RealWorld is the largest manually annotated benchmark to date, featuring\nthe highest resolution and a targeted focus on real-world applications. We\nfurther conduct a thorough evaluation involving $28$ prominent MLLMs, such as\nGPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet. Our results show that even the\nmost advanced models struggle with our benchmarks, where none of them reach\n$60\\%$ accuracy.

For example, asking the model to\nexplain Newton's second law with the context \"I am a toddler\" yields a\ndifferent answer compared to the context \"I am a physics professor.\" Proper\nusage of the context enables the LLM to generate personalized responses,\nwhereas inappropriate contextual influence can lead to stereotypical and\npotentially harmful generations (e.g. associating \"female\" with \"housekeeper\").\nIn practice, striking the right balance when leveraging context is a nuanced\nand challenging problem that is often situation-dependent. One common approach\nto address this challenge is to fine-tune LLMs on contextually appropriate\nresponses. However, this approach is expensive, time-consuming, and not\ncontrollable for end-users in different situations. In this work, we propose\nContext Steering (CoS) - a simple training-free method that can be easily\napplied to autoregressive LLMs at inference time. By measuring the contextual\ninfluence in terms of token prediction likelihood and modulating it, our method\nenables practitioners to determine the appropriate level of contextual\ninfluence based on their specific use case and end-user base. We showcase a\nvariety of applications of CoS including amplifying the contextual influence to\nachieve better personalization and mitigating unwanted influence for reducing\nmodel bias. In addition, we show that we can combine CoS with Bayesian\nInference to quantify the extent of hate speech on the internet.
