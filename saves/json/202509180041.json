Although this scheme is simple to implement, it\ntends to overly focus on local information, potentially leading to the neglect\nor omission of crucial global information. To mitigate this issue, we propose\nJudge Q, a novel training method which incorporates a soft token list. This\nmethod only tunes the model's embedding layer at a low training cost. By\nconcatenating the soft token list at the end of the input sequence, we train\nthese tokens' attention map to the original input sequence to align with that\nof the actual decoded tokens. In this way, the queries corresponding to the\nsoft tokens can effectively capture global information and better evaluate the\nimportance of the keys and values within the KV cache, thus maintaining\ndecoding quality when KV cache is evicted. Under the same eviction budget, our\nmethod exhibits less performance degradation compared to existing eviction\napproaches. We validate our approach through experiments conducted on models\nsuch as Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, using benchmarks\nincluding LongBench, RULER, and Needle-in-a-Haystack.

Recently,\nfeature caching has been introduced to accelerate diffusion transformers by\ncaching the feature computation in previous timesteps and reusing it in the\nfollowing timesteps, which leverage the temporal similarity of diffusion models\nwhile ignoring the similarity in the spatial dimension. In this paper, we\nintroduce Cluster-Driven Feature Caching (ClusCa) as an orthogonal and\ncomplementary perspective for previous feature caching. Specifically, ClusCa\nperforms spatial clustering on tokens in each timestep, computes only one token\nin each cluster and propagates their information to all the other tokens, which\nis able to reduce the number of tokens by over 90%. Extensive experiments on\nDiT, FLUX and HunyuanVideo demonstrate its effectiveness in both text-to-image\nand text-to-video generation. Besides, it can be directly applied to any\ndiffusion transformer without requirements for training. For instance, ClusCa\nachieves 4.96x acceleration on FLUX with an ImageReward of 99.49%, surpassing\nthe original model by 0.51%.

Recently, neural network-based ILF\nschemes have achieved remarkable coding gains, emerging as a powerful candidate\nfor next-generation video coding standards. However, the use of deep neural\nnetworks (DNN) brings significant computational and time complexity or high\ndemands for dedicated hardware, making it challenging for general use. To\naddress this limitation, we study a practical ILF solution by adopting look-up\ntables (LUTs). After training a DNN with a restricted reference range for ILF,\nall possible inputs are traversed, and the output values of the DNN are cached\ninto LUTs. During the coding process, the filtering process is performed by\nsimply retrieving the filtered pixel through locating the input pixels and\ninterpolating between the cached values, instead of relying on heavy inference\ncomputations. In this paper, we propose a universal LUT-based ILF framework,\ntermed LUT-ILF++. First, we introduce the cooperation of multiple kinds of\nfiltering LUTs and propose a series of customized indexing mechanisms to enable\nbetter filtering reference perception with limited storage consumption.

Third, in order to make our solution\npractical for coding uses, we propose the LUT compaction scheme to enable the\nLUT pruning, achieving a lower storage cost of the entire solution.

Task graph\nmodeling provides a structured way to capture such dependencies and serves as\nthe foundation for many system-level design strategies. However, these\nstrategies typically rely on predefined task graphs, while many real-world\napplications lack explicit graphs and exhibit dynamic, data-dependent behavior,\nlimiting the effectiveness of static approaches.

In this paper, we propose Dynamic Token-Level KV Cache\nSelection (TokenSelect), a training-free method for efficient and accurate\nlong-context inference. TokenSelect builds upon the observation of\nnon-contiguous attention sparsity, using QK dot products to measure per-head KV\nCache criticality at token-level. By per-head soft voting mechanism,\nTokenSelect selectively involves a few critical KV cache tokens in attention\ncalculation without sacrificing accuracy. To further accelerate TokenSelect, we\ndesign the Selection Cache based on observations of consecutive Query\nsimilarity and implemented the efficient Paged Dot Product Kernel,\nsignificantly reducing the selection overhead. A comprehensive evaluation of\nTokenSelect demonstrates up to $23.84\\times$ speedup in attention computation\nand up to $2.28\\times$ acceleration in end-to-end latency, while providing\nsuperior performance compared to state-of-the-art long-context inference\nmethods.",

Oblivious\nMaps (OMAPs) mitigate this by fully hiding access patterns but suffer from high\noverhead due to randomized remapping and worst-case padding. We argue these\ncosts are not fundamental. Modern accelerators featuring High-Bandwidth Memory\n(HBM) offer a new opportunity: Vaswani et al. [OSDI'18] point out that\neavesdropping on HBM is difficult -- even for physical attackers -- as its\nmemory channels are sealed together with processor cores inside the same\nphysical package. Later, Hunt et al. [NSDI'20] show that, with proper\nisolation, HBM can be turned into an unobservable region where both data and\nmemory traces are hidden. This motivates a rethink of OMAP design with\nHBM-backed solutions to finally overcome their traditional performance limits.\nBuilding on these insights, we present BOLT, a Bandwidth Optimized,\nLightning-fast OMAP accelerator that, for the first time, achieves O(1) +\nO(log_2(log_2 (N))) bandwidth overhead. BOLT introduces three key innovations:\n(i) a new OMAP algorithm that leverages isolated HBM as an unobservable cache\nto accelerate oblivious access to large host memory; (ii) a self-hosted\narchitecture that offloads execution and memory control from the host to\nmitigate CPU-side leakage; and (iii) tailored algorithm-architecture co-designs\nthat maximize resource efficiency. We implement a prototype BOLT on a Xilinx\nU55C FPGA. Evaluations show that BOLT achieves up to 279x and 480x speedups in\ninitialization and query time, respectively, over state-of-the-art OMAPs,\nincluding an industry implementation from Facebook.",

This paper introduces \\texttt{BFS-Prover-V2}, a system\ndesigned to address this dual scaling problem. We present two primary\ninnovations. The first is a novel multi-turn off-policy RL framework for\ncontinually improving the performance of LLM step-prover at training time. This\nframework, inspired by the principles of AlphaZero, utilizes a multi-stage\nexpert iteration pipeline featuring adaptive tactic-level data filtering and\nperiodic retraining to surmount the performance plateaus that typically curtail\nlong-term RL in LLM-based agents. The second innovation is a planner-enhanced\nmulti-agent search architecture that scales reasoning capabilities at inference\ntime. This architecture employs a general reasoning model as a high-level\nplanner to iteratively decompose complex theorems into a sequence of simpler\nsubgoals. This hierarchical approach substantially reduces the search space,\nenabling a team of parallel prover agents to collaborate efficiently by\nleveraging a shared proof cache. We demonstrate that this dual approach to\nscaling yields state-of-the-art results on established formal mathematics\nbenchmarks. \\texttt{BFS-Prover-V2} achieves 95.08\\% and 41.4\\% on the MiniF2F\nand ProofNet test sets respectively. While demonstrated in the domain of formal\nmathematics, the RL and inference techniques presented in this work are of\nbroader interest and may be applied to other domains requiring long-horizon\nmulti-turn reasoning and complex search.",

This paper introduces \\texttt{BFS-Prover-V2}, a system\ndesigned to address this dual scaling problem. We present two primary\ninnovations. The first is a novel multi-turn off-policy RL framework for\ncontinually improving the performance of LLM step-prover at training time. This\nframework, inspired by the principles of AlphaZero, utilizes a multi-stage\nexpert iteration pipeline featuring adaptive tactic-level data filtering and\nperiodic retraining to surmount the performance plateaus that typically curtail\nlong-term RL in LLM-based agents. The second innovation is a planner-enhanced\nmulti-agent search architecture that scales reasoning capabilities at inference\ntime. This architecture employs a general reasoning model as a high-level\nplanner to iteratively decompose complex theorems into a sequence of simpler\nsubgoals. This hierarchical approach substantially reduces the search space,\nenabling a team of parallel prover agents to collaborate efficiently by\nleveraging a shared proof cache. We demonstrate that this dual approach to\nscaling yields state-of-the-art results on established formal mathematics\nbenchmarks. \\texttt{BFS-Prover-V2} achieves 95.08\\% and 41.4\\% on the MiniF2F\nand ProofNet test sets respectively. While demonstrated in the domain of formal\nmathematics, the RL and inference techniques presented in this work are of\nbroader interest and may be applied to other domains requiring long-horizon\nmulti-turn reasoning and complex search."

Inspired\nby the channel controllers which interface the CPU to disk drives in mainframe\nsystems, we propose memory channel controllers as a convenient, portable, and\nvirtualizable abstraction of Near-Data Processing for modern disaggregated\nmemory systems.\n  In addition to providing a clean abstraction that enables OS integration\nwhile requiring no changes to CPU architecture, memory channel controllers\nincorporate another key innovation: they exploit the cache coherence provided\nby emerging interconnects to provide a much richer programming model, with more\nfine-grained interaction, than has been possible with existing designs."

Recurrent models offer high\nefficiency, but compressing the full sequence into a fixed-size and holistic\nrepresentation suffers from memory degradation in long contexts and limits\nfine-grained retrieval. To address this, we propose RAT, an intermediate design\nthat bridges the efficiency of RNNs and capacity of attention. RAT partitions\nthe input into chunks, applies recurrence within each chunk for local\ndependencies, and softmax-based attention across chunks for long-range\ninteractions. This design mitigates memory degradation and enables direct\naccess to distant tokens, while retaining computational efficiency.\nEmpirically, with a chunk size of 16, the RAT block achieves a 7x improvement\nin training speed with 100K token sequences and 9x in generation at the 4K\nposition, while maintaining similar performance compared to standard attention.\nWe demonstrate this by training 1.3B parameter models from scratch and\nperforming large-scale evaluations, including short- and long-context\nbenchmarks, as well as supervised fine-tuning~(SFT). We further propose a\nhybrid architecture that interleaves RAT with local attention. By combining\nefficient long-range modeling with strong local interactions, this hybrid\ndesign not only improves inference speed and reduces cache memory usage, but\nalso consistently enhances performance and shows the overall best results.

One of the main challenges towards the successful\ndeployment of LLMs is memory management, since they typically involve billions\nof parameters. To this end, architectures based on Mixture-of-Experts have been\nproposed, which aim to reduce the size of the parameters that are activated\nwhen producing a token. This raises the equally critical issue of efficiently\nmanaging the limited cache of the system, in that frequently used experts\nshould be stored in the fast cache rather than in the slower secondary memory.\n  In this work, we introduce and study a new paging problem that models expert\nmanagement optimization. Our formulation captures both the layered architecture\nof LLMs and the requirement that experts are cached efficiently. We first\npresent lower bounds on the competitive ratio of both deterministic and\nrandomized algorithms, which show that under mild assumptions, LRU-like\npolicies have good theoretical competitive performance. We then propose a\nlayer-based extension of LRU that is tailored to the problem at hand.\n  Extensive simulations on both synthetic datasets and actual traces of MoE\nusage show that our algorithm outperforms policies for the classic paging\nproblem, such as the standard LRU.",

Finally, we develop and evaluate a few algorithm variants\ninspired by this approach, including dynamic programming variants, local search\nmethods, and an LP-based scheduler, demonstrating through comprehensive\nsimulations that they outperform standard baselines while maintaining\ncomputational efficiency."

Developing\ngeneralizable ML models for networking requires data collection from network\nenvironments with traffic that results from a diverse set of real-world web\napplications. However, using existing browser automation tools that are\ndiverse, repeatable, realistic, and efficient remains fragile and costly.\nNetGent addresses this challenge by allowing users to specify workflows as\nnatural-language rules that define state-dependent actions.

Developing\ngeneralizable ML models for networking requires data collection from network\nenvironments with traffic that results from a diverse set of real-world web\napplications. However, using existing browser automation tools that are\ndiverse, repeatable, realistic, and efficient remains fragile and costly.\nNetGent addresses this challenge by allowing users to specify workflows as\nnatural-language rules that define state-dependent actions.

FlashTTS introduces\nthree synergistic optimizations: (i) Speculative Beam Extension to mitigate\nsystem stragglers from irregular reasoning paths; (ii) Asymmetric Multi-Model\nMemory Allocation to dynamically balance memory between generation and\nverification; and (iii) Dynamic Prefix-Aware Scheduling to maximize KV-cache\nreuse. Built as a plug-and-play library for vLLM, FlashTTS enables edge LLMs on\na single consumer GPU (24 GB) to match the accuracy and latency of large cloud\nmodels. Our evaluation demonstrates that FlashTTS achieves an average 2.2x\nhigher goodput and reduces latency by 38%-68% compared to a vLLM baseline,\npaving the way for democratized, high-performance agentic AI on edge devices."

To address this, the\ntransformer-based federated split models are proposed, which offload most model\nparameters to the server (or distributed clients) while retaining only a small\nportion on the client to ensure data privacy.

The linear Boltzmann transport\nequation (LBTE) is recognized as a fast and accurate approach for scatter\nestimation. However, for multi-spectral CT, it is cumbersome to compute\nmultiple scattering components for different spectra separately when applying\nLBTE-based scatter correction. In this work, we propose a Matrixed-Spectrum\nDecomposition accelerated LBTE solver (MSD-LBTE) that can be used to compute\nX-ray scatter distributions from CT acquisitions at two or more different\nspectra simultaneously, in a unified framework with no sacrifice in accuracy\nand nearly no increase in computation in theory. First, a matrixed-spectrum\nsolver of LBTE is obtained by introducing an additional label dimension to\nexpand the phase space. Then, we propose a ``spectrum basis'' for LBTE and a\nprinciple of selection of basis using the QR decomposition, along with the\nabove solver to construct the MSD-LBTE. Based on MSD-LBTE, a unified scatter\ncorrection method can be established for multi-spectral CT. We validate the\neffectiveness and accuracy of our method by comparing it with the Monte Carlo\nmethod, including the computational time. We also evaluate the scatter\ncorrection performance using two different phantoms for fast-kV switching based\ndual-energy CT, and using an elliptical phantom in a numerical simulation for\nkV-modulation enabled CT scans, validating that our proposed method can\nsignificantly reduce the computational cost at multiple spectra and effectively\nreduce scatter artifact in reconstructed CT images.",

To address these issues,\nwe propose a training-free approach called Activation-aware Singular Value\nDecomposition (ASVD). Specifically, ASVD manages activation outliers by\ntransforming the weight matrix based on the activation distribution. This\ntransformation allows the outliers in the activation matrix to be absorbed into\nthe transformed weight matrix, thereby enhancing decomposition accuracy.\nAdditionally, we propose an efficient iterative calibration process to optimize\nlayer-specific decomposition by addressing the varying sensitivity of different\nLLM layers. In this way, ASVD can compress a network by 10%-30%. Based on the\nsuccess of the low-rank decomposition of projection matrices in the\nself-attention module, we further introduce ASVD to compress the KV cache. By\nreducing the channel dimension of KV activations, memory requirements for KV\ncache can be largely reduced.

To\nincrease the KV cache hit rate on DRAM, we identify lossy KV cache compression\nas a promising approach. We design a lossy compression system that decides the\ncompression algorithm, compression rate and device placement for each KV cache\nentry to maximise DRAM hits and minimise loading delay without significantly\ndegrading generation quality.

However, whether large language models (LLMs) can\naccurately predict nutritional values based solely on text descriptions of\nfoods consumed remains unknown. If effective, this approach could enable\nsimpler dietary monitoring without the need for photographs. METHODS: We used\n24-hour dietary recalls from adolescents aged 12-19 years in the National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). An open-source quantized LLM\nwas prompted using a 10-shot, chain-of-thought approach to estimate energy and\nfive macronutrients based solely on text strings listing foods and their\nquantities. We then applied parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) to evaluate\nwhether predictive accuracy improved. NHANES-calculated values served as the\nground truth for energy, proteins, carbohydrates, total sugar, dietary fiber\nand total fat. RESULTS: In a pooled dataset of 11,281 adolescents (49.9% male,\nmean age 15.4 years), the vanilla LLM yielded poor predictions. The mean\nabsolute error (MAE) was 652.08 for energy and the Lin's CCC <0.46 across\nendpoints. In contrast, the fine-tuned model performed substantially better,\nwith energy MAEs ranging from 171.34 to 190.90 across subsets, and Lin's CCC\nexceeding 0.89 for all outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: When prompted using a\nchain-of-thought approach and fine-tuned with PEFT, open-source LLMs exposed\nsolely to text input can accurately predict energy and macronutrient values\nfrom 24-hour dietary recalls.

Finally, we evaluate our\napproach across four tasks and five datasets, in both zero-shot and fully\nsupervised settings, demonstrating significant reductions in computational cost\n(up to 60%) and improvements in inference speed (up to 2.5x faster), all while\nclosely approximating the accuracy of the original foundation model.",

Our results reveal that all Pearson\ncorrelations between model predictions and ground-truth personality traits\nremain below 0.26, highlighting the limited alignment of current LLMs with\nvalidated psychological constructs. Chain-of-thought prompting offers minimal\ngains over zero-shot, suggesting that personality inference relies more on\nlatent semantic representation than explicit reasoning.

This study benchmarks Convergence Cross\nMapping (CCM) against Granger causality, PCMCI, and VarLiNGAM using both\nsynthetic datasets with ground truth causal links and 41 years of Arctic\nclimate data (1979--2021). Unlike stochastic models that rely on autoregressive\nresidual dependence, CCM leverages Takens' state-space reconstruction and\ndelay-embedding to reconstruct attractor manifolds from time series. Cross\nmapping between reconstructed manifolds exploits deterministic signatures of\ncausation, enabling the detection of weak and bidirectional causal links that\nlinear models fail to resolve. Results demonstrate that CCM achieves higher\nspecificity and fewer false positives on synthetic benchmarks, while\nmaintaining robustness under observational noise and limited sample lengths. On\nArctic data, CCM reveals significant causal interactions between sea ice extent\nand atmospheric variables like specific humidity, longwave radiation, and\nsurface temperature with a $p$-value of $0.009$, supporting ice-albedo\nfeedbacks and moisture-radiation couplings central to Arctic amplification. In\ncontrast, stochastic approaches miss these nonlinear dependencies or infer\nspurious causal relations.

                "summary": "Recent advances in reasoning with large language models (LLMs) have\ndemonstrated strong performance on complex mathematical tasks, including\ncombinatorial optimization. Techniques such as Chain-of-Thought and In-Context\nLearning have further enhanced this capability, making LLMs both powerful and\naccessible tools for a wide range of users, including non-experts. However,\napplying LLMs to matching problems, which require reasoning under preferential\nand structural constraints, remains underexplored. To address this gap, we\nintroduce a novel benchmark of 369 instances of the College Admission Problem,\na canonical example of a matching problem with preferences, to evaluate LLMs\nacross key dimensions: feasibility, stability, and optimality. We employ this\nbenchmark to assess the performance of several open-weight LLMs. Our results\nfirst reveal that while LLMs can satisfy certain constraints, they struggle to\nmeet all evaluation criteria consistently. They also show that reasoning LLMs,\nlike QwQ and GPT-oss, significantly outperform traditional models such as\nLlama, Qwen or Mistral, defined here as models used without any dedicated\nreasoning mechanisms. Moreover, we observed that LLMs reacted differently to\nthe various prompting strategies tested, which include Chain-of-Thought,\nIn-Context Learning and role-based prompting, with no prompt consistently\noffering the best performance. Finally, we report the performances from\niterative prompting with auto-generated feedback and show that they are not\nmonotonic; they can peak early and then significantly decline in later\nattempts. Overall, this work offers a new perspective on model reasoning\nperformance and the effectiveness of prompting strategies in combinatorial\noptimization problems with preferential constraints.",

                    "value": "Recent advances in reasoning with large language models (LLMs) have\ndemonstrated strong performance on complex mathematical tasks, including\ncombinatorial optimization. Techniques such as Chain-of-Thought and In-Context\nLearning have further enhanced this capability, making LLMs both powerful and\naccessible tools for a wide range of users, including non-experts. However,\napplying LLMs to matching problems, which require reasoning under preferential\nand structural constraints, remains underexplored. To address this gap, we\nintroduce a novel benchmark of 369 instances of the College Admission Problem,\na canonical example of a matching problem with preferences, to evaluate LLMs\nacross key dimensions: feasibility, stability, and optimality. We employ this\nbenchmark to assess the performance of several open-weight LLMs. Our results\nfirst reveal that while LLMs can satisfy certain constraints, they struggle to\nmeet all evaluation criteria consistently. They also show that reasoning LLMs,\nlike QwQ and GPT-oss, significantly outperform traditional models such as\nLlama, Qwen or Mistral, defined here as models used without any dedicated\nreasoning mechanisms. Moreover, we observed that LLMs reacted differently to\nthe various prompting strategies tested, which include Chain-of-Thought,\nIn-Context Learning and role-based prompting, with no prompt consistently\noffering the best performance. Finally, we report the performances from\niterative prompting with auto-generated feedback and show that they are not\nmonotonic; they can peak early and then significantly decline in later\nattempts. Overall, this work offers a new perspective on model reasoning\nperformance and the effectiveness of prompting strategies in combinatorial\noptimization problems with preferential constraints."

Adversarial classification, as any other\nclassification problem is built around minimization of the (average or correct\ndetection) probability of error in deciding on either of the classes in the\ncase of binary classification. Unlike the classical hypothesis testing problem,\nwhere the false alarm and mis-detection probabilities are handled separately\nresulting in an asymmetric behavior of the best error exponent, in this work,\nwe characterize the relationship between $\\varepsilon\\textrm{-}$differential\nprivacy, the best error exponent of one of the errors (when the other is fixed)\nand the best average error exponent. Accordingly, we re-derive Chernoff\ndifferential privacy in connection with $\\varepsilon\\textrm{-}$differential\nprivacy using the Radon-Nikodym derivative, and prove its relation with\nKullback-Leibler (KL) differential privacy. Subsequently, we present numerical\nevaluation results, which demonstrates that Chernoff information outperforms\nKullback-Leibler divergence as a function of the privacy parameter\n$\\varepsilon$ and the impact of the adversary's attack in Laplace mechanisms.\nLastly, we introduce a new upper bound on adversary's membership advantage in\nmembership inference attacks using Chernoff DP and numerically compare its\nperformance with existing alternatives based on $(\\varepsilon,\n\\delta)\\textrm{-}$differential privacy in the literature.",

                    "value": "This work inspects a privacy metric based on Chernoff information, namely\nChernoff differential privacy, due to its significance in characterization of\nthe optimal classifier's performance. Adversarial classification, as any other\nclassification problem is built around minimization of the (average or correct\ndetection) probability of error in deciding on either of the classes in the\ncase of binary classification. Unlike the classical hypothesis testing problem,\nwhere the false alarm and mis-detection probabilities are handled separately\nresulting in an asymmetric behavior of the best error exponent, in this work,\nwe characterize the relationship between $\\varepsilon\\textrm{-}$differential\nprivacy, the best error exponent of one of the errors (when the other is fixed)\nand the best average error exponent. Accordingly, we re-derive Chernoff\ndifferential privacy in connection with $\\varepsilon\\textrm{-}$differential\nprivacy using the Radon-Nikodym derivative, and prove its relation with\nKullback-Leibler (KL) differential privacy. Subsequently, we present numerical\nevaluation results, which demonstrates that Chernoff information outperforms\nKullback-Leibler divergence as a function of the privacy parameter\n$\\varepsilon$ and the impact of the adversary's attack in Laplace mechanisms.\nLastly, we introduce a new upper bound on adversary's membership advantage in\nmembership inference attacks using Chernoff DP and numerically compare its\nperformance with existing alternatives based on $(\\varepsilon,\n\\delta)\\textrm{-}$differential privacy in the literature."

Recent advances\nin diffusion models have made it possible to generate realistic, high-quality\ntabular data, but they may also memorize training records and leak sensitive\ninformation. Membership inference attacks (MIAs) exploit this vulnerability by\ndetermining whether a record was used in training. While MIAs have been studied\nin images and text, their use against tabular diffusion models remains\nunderexplored despite the unique risks of structured attributes and limited\nrecord diversity. In this paper, we introduce MIAEPT, Membership Inference\nAttack via Error Prediction for Tabular Data, a novel black-box attack\nspecifically designed to target tabular diffusion models. MIA-EPT constructs\nerrorbased feature vectors by masking and reconstructing attributes of target\nrecords, disclosing membership signals based on how well these attributes are\npredicted. MIA-EPT operates without access to the internal components of the\ngenerative model, relying only on its synthetic data output, and was shown to\ngeneralize across multiple state-of-the-art diffusion models. We validate\nMIA-EPT on three diffusion-based synthesizers, achieving AUC-ROC scores of up\nto 0.599 and TPR@10% FPR values of 22.0% in our internal tests. Under the MIDST\n2025 competition conditions, MIA-EPT achieved second place in the Black-box\nMulti-Table track (TPR@10% FPR = 20.0%). These results demonstrate that our\nmethod can uncover substantial membership leakage in synthetic tabular data,\nchallenging the assumption that synthetic data is inherently\nprivacy-preserving.

Traditional\nrule-based methods rely on manually-written rules, which can be time-consuming\nand often result in less readable code. To overcome this, learning-based\nmethods have been developed, leveraging parallel data to train models for\nautomated code translation. More recently, the advance of Large Language Models\n(LLMs) further boosts learning-based code translation. Although promising,\nLLM-translated program still suffers from diverse quality issues (e.g., syntax\nerrors and semantic errors). In particular, it can be challenging for LLMs to\nself-debug these errors when simply provided with the corresponding error\nmessages.\n  In this work, we propose a novel LLM-based multi-agent system TRANSAGENT,\nwhich enhances LLM-based code translation by fixing the syntax errors and\nsemantic errors with the synergy between four LLM-based agents, including\nInitial Code Translator, Syntax Error Fixer, Code Aligner, and Semantic Error\nFixer. The main insight of TRANSAGENT is to first localize the error code block\nin the target program based on the execution alignment between the target and\nsource program, which can narrow down the fixing space and thus lower down the\nfixing difficulties. To evaluate TRANSAGENT, we first construct a new benchmark\nfrom recent programming tasks to mitigate the potential data leakage issue. On\nour benchmark, TRANSAGENT outperforms the latest LLM-based code translation\ntechnique UniTrans in both translation effectiveness and efficiency;\nadditionally, our evaluation on different LLMs show the generalization of\nTRANSAGENT and our ablation study shows the contribution of each agent.",

Traditional\nrule-based methods rely on manually-written rules, which can be time-consuming\nand often result in less readable code. To overcome this, learning-based\nmethods have been developed, leveraging parallel data to train models for\nautomated code translation. More recently, the advance of Large Language Models\n(LLMs) further boosts learning-based code translation. Although promising,\nLLM-translated program still suffers from diverse quality issues (e.g., syntax\nerrors and semantic errors). In particular, it can be challenging for LLMs to\nself-debug these errors when simply provided with the corresponding error\nmessages.\n  In this work, we propose a novel LLM-based multi-agent system TRANSAGENT,\nwhich enhances LLM-based code translation by fixing the syntax errors and\nsemantic errors with the synergy between four LLM-based agents, including\nInitial Code Translator, Syntax Error Fixer, Code Aligner, and Semantic Error\nFixer. The main insight of TRANSAGENT is to first localize the error code block\nin the target program based on the execution alignment between the target and\nsource program, which can narrow down the fixing space and thus lower down the\nfixing difficulties. To evaluate TRANSAGENT, we first construct a new benchmark\nfrom recent programming tasks to mitigate the potential data leakage issue. On\nour benchmark, TRANSAGENT outperforms the latest LLM-based code translation\ntechnique UniTrans in both translation effectiveness and efficiency;\nadditionally, our evaluation on different LLMs show the generalization of\nTRANSAGENT and our ablation study shows the contribution of each agent."

Recent advancements, such as\nOpenAI's o1 and DeepSeek-R1, suggest that scaling up the length of CoT\nsequences during inference could further boost LLM reasoning performance.\nHowever, due to the autoregressive nature of LLM decoding, longer CoT outputs\nlead to a linear increase in inference latency, adversely affecting user\nexperience, particularly when the CoT exceeds 10,000 tokens. To address this\nlimitation, we analyze the semantic importance of tokens within CoT outputs and\nreveal that their contributions to reasoning vary. Building on this insight, we\npropose TokenSkip, a simple yet effective approach that enables LLMs to\nselectively skip less important tokens, allowing for controllable CoT\ncompression. Extensive experiments across various models and tasks demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of TokenSkip in reducing CoT token usage while preserving\nstrong reasoning performance. Notably, when applied to Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct,\nTokenSkip reduces reasoning tokens by 40% (from 313 to 181) on GSM8K, with less\nthan a 0.4% performance drop.

Our\nresults show that optimized network configurations significantly outperform\nconventional GHZ-based protocols while maintaining shallow circuit depths\ncompatible with noisy intermediate-scale quantum hardware. Sensitivity remains\nrobust under local dephasing noise. These findings highlight the importance of\nnetwork structure in quantum sensing and point toward scalable strategies for\nquantum-enhanced DM detection."

For the final rates\nestimation, we build a knowledge-intensive QA dataset for 30 languages with\nLLM-generated prompts and Wikipedia articles as references. We find that, while\nLLMs generate longer responses with more hallucinated tokens for\nhigher-resource languages, there is no correlation between length-normalized\nhallucination rates of languages and their digital representation.

We represent\ndynamic systems as spatiotemporal multiplex graphs and model their latent\ntrajectories using a GNN-parameterized vector field. Given the sparse context\nobservations at node and edge levels, the model infers a distribution over\nlatent initial states and control variables, enabling both interpolation and\nextrapolation of trajectories. We validate the method on three synthetic\ndynamical systems (coupled pendulum, Lorenz attractor, and Kuramoto\noscillators) and two real-world cardiac imaging datasets - ACDC (N=150) and UK\nBiobank (N=526) - demonstrating accurate reconstruction, extrapolation, and\ndisease classification capabilities. The model accurately reconstructs\ntrajectories and extrapolates future cardiac cycles from a single observed\ncycle. It achieves state-of-the-art results on the ACDC classification task (up\nto 99% accuracy), and detects atrial fibrillation in UK Biobank subjects with\ncompetitive performance (up to 67% accuracy).

                "summary": "Origin-Destination (OD) matrices are a core component of research on users'\nmobility and summarize how individuals move between geographical regions. These\nregions should be small enough to be representative of user mobility, without\nincurring substantial privacy risks. There are two added values of the\nNetMob2025 challenge dataset. Firstly, the data is extensive and contains a lot\nof socio-demographic information that can be used to create multiple OD\nmatrices, based on the segments of the population. Secondly, a participant is\nnot merely a record in the data, but a statistically weighted proxy for a\nsegment of the real population. This opens the door to a fundamental shift in\nthe anonymization paradigm. A population-based view of privacy is central to\nour contribution. By adjusting our anonymization framework to account for\nrepresentativeness, we are also protecting the inferred identity of the actual\npopulation, rather than survey participants alone. The challenge addressed in\nthis work is to produce and compare OD matrices that are k-anonymous for survey\nparticipants and for the whole population.

                    "value": "Origin-Destination (OD) matrices are a core component of research on users'\nmobility and summarize how individuals move between geographical regions. These\nregions should be small enough to be representative of user mobility, without\nincurring substantial privacy risks. There are two added values of the\nNetMob2025 challenge dataset. Firstly, the data is extensive and contains a lot\nof socio-demographic information that can be used to create multiple OD\nmatrices, based on the segments of the population. Secondly, a participant is\nnot merely a record in the data, but a statistically weighted proxy for a\nsegment of the real population. This opens the door to a fundamental shift in\nthe anonymization paradigm. A population-based view of privacy is central to\nour contribution. By adjusting our anonymization framework to account for\nrepresentativeness, we are also protecting the inferred identity of the actual\npopulation, rather than survey participants alone. The challenge addressed in\nthis work is to produce and compare OD matrices that are k-anonymous for survey\nparticipants and for the whole population.

We evaluate our technique using 350\ncybersecurity-specific prompts, demonstrating substantial improvements in\njailbreak Success Rates (SRs), increasing from 7\\% (no refinements) to 62\\%\nafter three refinement iterations, while maintaining a cost of 7.5\\textcent~per\nprompt. Comparative A/B testing across nine different LLM evaluators confirms\nthat outputs from additional refinement steps are consistently rated as more\nmalicious and technically superior. Moreover, manual code analysis reveals that\ngenerated outputs execute with minimal modification, although optimal\ndeployment typically requires target-specific fine-tuning.

However, whether large language models (LLMs) can\naccurately predict nutritional values based solely on text descriptions of\nfoods consumed remains unknown.

METHODS: We used\n24-hour dietary recalls from adolescents aged 12-19 years in the National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). An open-source quantized LLM\nwas prompted using a 10-shot, chain-of-thought approach to estimate energy and\nfive macronutrients based solely on text strings listing foods and their\nquantities. We then applied parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) to evaluate\nwhether predictive accuracy improved. NHANES-calculated values served as the\nground truth for energy, proteins, carbohydrates, total sugar, dietary fiber\nand total fat. RESULTS: In a pooled dataset of 11,281 adolescents (49.9% male,\nmean age 15.4 years), the vanilla LLM yielded poor predictions. The mean\nabsolute error (MAE) was 652.08 for energy and the Lin's CCC <0.46 across\nendpoints. In contrast, the fine-tuned model performed substantially better,\nwith energy MAEs ranging from 171.34 to 190.90 across subsets, and Lin's CCC\nexceeding 0.89 for all outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: When prompted using a\nchain-of-thought approach and fine-tuned with PEFT, open-source LLMs exposed\nsolely to text input can accurately predict energy and macronutrient values\nfrom 24-hour dietary recalls.

Forcing binary\nlabels upon such claims lowers the reliability of evaluation. In this work, we\nreframe the task to manage the subjectivity involved with factuality judgments\nof ambiguous claims. We introduce LLM-generated edits of summaries as a method\nof providing a nuanced evaluation of claims: how much does a summary need to be\nedited to be unambiguous? Whether a claim gets rewritten and how much it\nchanges can be used as an automatic evaluation metric, the Ambiguity Rewrite\nMetric (ARM), with a much richer feedback signal than a binary judgment of\nfaithfulness. We focus on the area of narrative summarization as it is\nparticularly rife with ambiguity and subjective interpretation. We show that\nARM produces a 21% absolute improvement in annotator agreement on claim\nfaithfulness, indicating that subjectivity is reduced.",

To this end, we\nintroduce a novel curriculum multi-task self-supervised learning (CMTSSL)\nframework designed for lightweight architectures for HSI analysis. CMTSSL\nintegrates masked image modeling with decoupled spatial and spectral jigsaw\npuzzle solving, guided by a curriculum learning strategy that progressively\nincreases data complexity during self-supervision.

This throughput orientation\nallows a dynamic allocation that opportunistically pools available resources\nover time, avoiding both the long queue and expensive GPU purchases.\nEffectively utilizing opportunistic resources brings numerous challenges\nnevertheless. Our solution, pervasive context management, exploits the common\ncomputational context in LLM applications and provides mechanisms and policies\nthat allow seamless context reuse on opportunistic resources. Our evaluation\nshows an LLM application with pervasive context management on opportunistic\nresources reduces its execution time by 98.1%."

However, the former struggles to generate reliable\nactions, while the latter relies heavily on expert experience to translate\nhigh-level tasks into specific action sequences. To address these challenges,\nwe introduce the Plan with Language, Act with Parameter (PLAP) planning\nframework that facilitates the grounding of LLM-based agents in long-horizon\nenvironments. The PLAP method comprises three key components: (1) a skill\nlibrary containing environment-specific parameterized skills, (2) a skill\nplanner powered by LLMs, and (3) a skill executor converting the parameterized\nskills into executable action sequences. We implement PLAP in MicroRTS, a\nlong-horizon real-time strategy game that provides an unfamiliar and\nchallenging environment for LLMs. The experimental results demonstrate the\neffectiveness of PLAP. In particular, GPT-4o-driven PLAP in a zero-shot setting\noutperforms 80% of baseline agents, and Qwen2-72B-driven PLAP, with carefully\ncrafted few-shot examples, surpasses the top-tier scripted agent, CoacAI.\nAdditionally, we design comprehensive evaluation metrics and test 6\nclosed-source and 2 open-source LLMs within the PLAP framework, ultimately\nreleasing an LLM leaderboard ranking long-horizon skill planning ability.

While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating\nhigh-level code from natural language, their effectiveness on low-level\nequipment languages remains limited. To address this, we propose Progressive\nKnowledge Enhancement (PKE), a novel multi-stage prompting framework that\nprogressively extracts and activates the latent knowledge within LLMs, guiding\nthem from simple to complex examples without extensive fine-tuning. Empirical\nevaluation on an industrial ALPG dataset shows that PKE significantly\noutperforms standard prompting and surpasses state-of-the-art methods in\ngenerating correct ALPG code, achieving 11.1\\% and 15.2\\% higher exact match\nscores compared to the second-best technique. Further analysis of individual\ncomponents confirms that progressive knowledge extraction based on difficulty\nenhances accuracy.

We present a\nnovel approach that achieves a 261x cost reduction for maritime intelligence by\nusing LLMs as one-time teachers rather than using them directly for inference.\nOur method transforms 3.2 billion Automatic Identification System (AIS) vessel\ntracking records into 21,543 synthetic question and answer pairs through\nmulti-model generation (GPT-4o and o3-mini), preventing overfitting and\nensuring accurate reasoning. The resulting fine-tuned Qwen2.5-7B model achieves\n75% accuracy on maritime tasks, while being substantially cheaper than using a\nlarger model for inference.

We present a\nnovel approach that achieves a 261x cost reduction for maritime intelligence by\nusing LLMs as one-time teachers rather than using them directly for inference.\nOur method transforms 3.2 billion Automatic Identification System (AIS) vessel\ntracking records into 21,543 synthetic question and answer pairs through\nmulti-model generation (GPT-4o and o3-mini), preventing overfitting and\nensuring accurate reasoning. The resulting fine-tuned Qwen2.5-7B model achieves\n75% accuracy on maritime tasks, while being substantially cheaper than using a\nlarger model for inference.

However, it remains unclear whether this approach effectively\ncaptures cultural nuances or produces distinct cultural representations for\nvarious downstream tasks. In this paper, we systematically investigate\nWVS-based training for cultural value adaptation and find that relying solely\non survey data can homogenize cultural norms and interfere with factual\nknowledge. To investigate these issues, we augment WVS with encyclopedic and\nscenario-based cultural narratives from Wikipedia and NormAd. While these\nnarratives may have variable effects on downstream tasks, they consistently\nimprove cultural distinctiveness than survey data alone. Our work highlights\nthe inherent complexity of aligning cultural values with the goal of guiding\ntask-specific behavior.

Here, we introduce a\nDistributionally Robust Free Energy model (DR-FREE) that instills this core\nproperty by design.

By combining a robust extension of the\nfree energy principle with a novel resolution engine, DR-FREE returns a policy\nthat is optimal-yet-robust against ambiguity. The policy has an explicit,\nsoft-max, structure that reveals the mechanistic role of ambiguity on optimal\ndecisions and requisite Bayesian belief updating. We evaluate DR-FREE on an\nexperimental testbed involving real rovers navigating an ambiguous environment\nfilled with obstacles. Across all the experiments, DR-FREE enables robots to\nsuccessfully navigate towards their goal even when, in contrast,\nstate-of-the-art free energy models fail. In short, DR-FREE can tackle\nscenarios that elude previous methods: this milestone may inspire both\ndeployment in multi-agent settings and, at a perhaps deeper level, the quest\nfor a biologically plausible explanation of how natural agents -- with little\nor no training -- survive in capricious environments.",

In this study, we propose a novel three-stage\ncompression pipeline for the YOLOv8 object detection model, integrating\nsparsity-aware training, structured channel pruning, and Channel-Wise Knowledge\nDistillation (CWD). First, sparsity-aware training introduces dynamic sparsity\nduring model optimization, effectively balancing parameter reduction and\ndetection accuracy. Second, we apply structured channel pruning by leveraging\nbatch normalization scaling factors to eliminate redundant channels,\nsignificantly reducing model size and computational complexity. Finally, to\nmitigate the accuracy drop caused by pruning, we employ CWD to transfer\nknowledge from the original model, using an adjustable temperature and loss\nweighting scheme tailored for small and medium object detection. Extensive\nexperiments on the VisDrone dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our\napproach across multiple YOLOv8 variants. For YOLOv8m, our method reduces model\nparameters from 25.85M to 6.85M (a 73.51% reduction), FLOPs from 49.6G to\n13.3G, and MACs from 101G to 34.5G, while reducing AP50 by only 2.7%. The\nresulting compressed model achieves 47.9 AP50 and boosts inference speed from\n26 FPS (YOLOv8m baseline) to 45 FPS, enabling real-time deployment on edge\ndevices. We further apply TensorRT as a lightweight optimization step. While\nthis introduces a minor drop in AP50 (from 47.9 to 47.6), it significantly\nimproves inference speed from 45 to 68 FPS, demonstrating the practicality of\nour approach for high-throughput, re-source-constrained scenarios.",

Previous work usually use LoRA to fine-tune existing\nLLMs, which are limited by the data and training gap between LLMs and embedding\nmodels. In this work, we introduce Conan-embedding-v2, a new 1.4B-parameter LLM\ntrained from scratch and fine-tuned as a text embedder. First, we add news data\nand multilingual pairs for LLM pretraining to bridge the data gap. Based on\nthis, we propose a cross-lingual retrieval dataset that enables the LLM to\nbetter integrate embeddings across different languages. Second, whereas LLMs\nuse a causal mask with token-level loss, embedding models use a bidirectional\nmask with sentence-level loss. This training gap makes full fine-tuning less\neffective than LoRA. We introduce a soft-masking mechanism to gradually\ntransition between these two types of masks, enabling the model to learn more\ncomprehensive representations. Based on this, we propose a dynamic hard\nnegative mining method that exposes the model to more difficult negative\nexamples throughout the training process. Being intuitive and effective, with\nonly approximately 1.4B parameters, Conan-embedding-v2 achieves SOTA\nperformance on both the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) and Chinese\nMTEB (May 19, 2025).",

                "summary": "Automatic open-domain dialogue evaluation has attracted increasing attention,\nyet remains challenging due to the complexity of assessing response\nappropriateness. Traditional evaluation metrics, typically trained with true\npositive and randomly selected negative responses, tend to assign higher scores\nto responses that share greater content similarity with contexts. However,\nadversarial negative responses, despite possessing high lexical overlap with\ncontexts, can be semantically incongruous. Consequently, existing metrics\nstruggle to effectively evaluate such responses, resulting in low correlations\nwith human judgments. While recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness\nof Large Language Models (LLMs) for open-domain dialogue evaluation, they still\nface challenges in handling adversarial negative examples.

However, data collection can be challenging for certain tasks due\nto the rarity of occurrences or high costs. These challenges are evident in our\nuse case, where we apply AI models to a novel approach for visually documenting\nthe musculoskeletal condition of dogs. Here, abnormalities are marked as\ncolored strokes on a body map of a dog.

LLMs have demonstrated impressive\ncapabilities across a wide range of tasks, including medical applications,\noffering promising potential for generating synthetic training data. In this\nwork, we investigate whether LLMs can effectively generate synthetic visual\ntraining data for canine musculoskeletal diagnoses. For this, we developed a\nmapping that segments visual documentations into over 200 labeled regions\nrepresenting muscles or joints. Using techniques like guided decoding,\nchain-of-thought reasoning, and few-shot prompting, we generated 1,000\nsynthetic visual documentations for patellar luxation (kneecap dislocation)\ndiagnosis, the diagnosis for which we have the most real-world data. Our\nanalysis shows that the generated documentations are sensitive to location and\nseverity of the diagnosis while remaining independent of the dog's sex.

In this work, we investigate\nthe possibility of effectively tackling the mode collapse challenge without the\nassumption of pre-defined trajectory vocabulary or pre-computed scene priors.\nSpecifically, we propose TransDiffuser, an encoder-decoder based generative\ntrajectory planning model, where the encoded scene information and motion\nstates serve as the multi-modal conditional input of the denoising decoder.\nDifferent from existing approaches, we exploit a simple yet effective\nmulti-modal representation decorrelation optimization mechanism during the\ndenoising process to enrich the latent representation space which better guides\nthe downstream generation. Without any predefined trajectory anchors or\npre-computed scene priors, TransDiffuser achieves the PDMS of 94.85 on the\nclosed-loop planning-oriented benchmark NAVSIM, surpassing previous\nstate-of-the-art methods. Qualitative evaluation further showcases\nTransDiffuser generates more diverse and plausible trajectories which explore\nmore drivable area.",

Without any predefined trajectory anchors or\npre-computed scene priors, TransDiffuser achieves the PDMS of 94.85 on the\nclosed-loop planning-oriented benchmark NAVSIM, surpassing previous\nstate-of-the-art methods. Qualitative evaluation further showcases\nTransDiffuser generates more diverse and plausible trajectories which explore\nmore drivable area."
