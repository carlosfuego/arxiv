Prior\nworks such as Grouped Query Attention (GQA) and Multi-Latent Attention (MLA)\nshrink the cache, speeding decode, but leave compute, which determines prefill\nand training speed, largely unchanged. We introduce Compressed Convolutional\nAttention (CCA), a novel attention method which down-projects queries, keys,\nand values and performs the entire attention operation inside the shared latent\nspace.

Using a simple water-droplet lift-off method, we obtained\nsubmillimeter- to millimeter-sized membranes that retained crystallinity, as\nconfirmed by high-resolution X-ray diffraction, and exhibited robust tetragonal\nsymmetry by Raman spectroscopy. Impedance spectroscopy confirmed a high\ndielectric constant of 1340, reflecting the robust dielectric response of the\nmembranes. Ferroelectric functionality was revealed by piezoresponse force\nmicroscopy (PFM) and further verified by polarization-electric field (P-E) loop\nmeasurements with Positive-Up-Negative-Down (PUND). The P-E loops exhibited a\nremnant polarization of 5 microC cm-2 and a coercive field of 63 kV cm-1. These\nresults were interpreted in relation to c- and a-domain configurations. These\nresults establish hybrid MBE as a generalizable route for producing\nstoichiometry-controlled ferroelectric membranes, enabling their integration\ninto next-generation flexible and multifunctional quantum oxide devices.",

Using a simple water-droplet lift-off method, we obtained\nsubmillimeter- to millimeter-sized membranes that retained crystallinity, as\nconfirmed by high-resolution X-ray diffraction, and exhibited robust tetragonal\nsymmetry by Raman spectroscopy. Impedance spectroscopy confirmed a high\ndielectric constant of 1340, reflecting the robust dielectric response of the\nmembranes. Ferroelectric functionality was revealed by piezoresponse force\nmicroscopy (PFM) and further verified by polarization-electric field (P-E) loop\nmeasurements with Positive-Up-Negative-Down (PUND). The P-E loops exhibited a\nremnant polarization of 5 microC cm-2 and a coercive field of 63 kV cm-1. These\nresults were interpreted in relation to c- and a-domain configurations. These\nresults establish hybrid MBE as a generalizable route for producing\nstoichiometry-controlled ferroelectric membranes, enabling their integration\ninto next-generation flexible and multifunctional quantum oxide devices."

We propose\nFollow-Your-Shape, a training-free and mask-free framework that supports\nprecise and controllable editing of object shapes while strictly preserving\nnon-target content. Motivated by the divergence between inversion and editing\ntrajectories, we compute a Trajectory Divergence Map (TDM) by comparing\ntoken-wise velocity differences between the inversion and denoising paths. The\nTDM enables precise localization of editable regions and guides a Scheduled KV\nInjection mechanism that ensures stable and faithful editing. To facilitate a\nrigorous evaluation, we introduce ReShapeBench, a new benchmark comprising 120\nnew images and enriched prompt pairs specifically curated for shape-aware\nediting.

The developed microscopic model is compared to the macroscopic models\nalready found in the literature. The microscopic model shows a comparable\nelectric field inversion similarly to macroscopic models. However, the behavior\nof the microscopic model is noticed to be different under heating and cooling\nload cycles. In hot cable, the maximum electric field stabilizes at different\namplitude and position inside the insulation thickness in both models.

Existing\nstrategies fall short: horizontal scaling provisions entire replicas of the\ncurrent configuration, often tens to hundreds of accelerators, leading to\ncoarse granularity, long provisioning delays, and costly overprovisioning.\nVertical scaling offers finer adjustments but typically requires instance\nrestarts, incurring downtime. These limitations make current approaches\nill-suited for the bursty, short-lived traffic patterns common in cloud\ndeployments.\n  We present ElasticMoE, an elastic scaling framework for MoE LLMs that\nachieves fine-grained, low-latency, and zero-downtime scaling. ElasticMoE\ndecouples inference execution from memory operations, enabling scaling steps to\nproceed concurrently with serving. An HBM Management Module (HMM) reuses\nweights and KV caches via zero-copy remapping, while high-bandwidth\npeer-to-peer transfers bring newly added accelerators online without\ninterrupting service. A virtual memory based expert redistribution mechanism\nmigrates MoE experts without costly buffer reallocations, reducing peak memory\nusage during expert parallelism reconfiguration.\n  Our evaluation on Ascend NPUs with three popular MoE LLMs shows that\nElasticMoE achieves up to 9x lower scale-up latency, up to 2x better throughput\nduring scaling, and significantly improves SLO attainment compared to\nbaselines.

These\nstudies seek to answer two fundamental questions: \"When to cache\" and \"How to\nuse cache\", typically relying on predefined empirical laws or dataset-level\npriors to determine caching timings and adopting handcrafted rules for\nmulti-step cache utilization. However, given the highly dynamic nature of the\ndiffusion process, they often exhibit limited generalizability and fail to cope\nwith diverse samples. In this paper, a strong sample-specific correlation is\nrevealed between the variation patterns of the shallow-layer feature\ndifferences in the diffusion model and those of deep-layer features. Moreover,\nwe have observed that the features from different model layers form similar\ntrajectories. Based on these observations, we present DiCache, a novel\ntraining-free adaptive caching strategy for accelerating diffusion models at\nruntime, answering both when and how to cache within a unified framework.\nSpecifically, DiCache is composed of two principal components: (1) Online Probe\nProfiling Scheme leverages a shallow-layer online probe to obtain an on-the-fly\nindicator for the caching error in real time, enabling the model to dynamically\ncustomize the caching schedule for each sample. (2) Dynamic Cache Trajectory\nAlignment adaptively approximates the deep-layer feature output from multi-step\nhistorical caches based on the shallow-layer feature trajectory, facilitating\nhigher visual quality. Extensive experiments validate DiCache's capability in\nachieving higher efficiency and improved fidelity over state-of-the-art\napproaches on various leading diffusion models including WAN 2.1, HunyuanVideo\nand Flux.",

In this paper, a strong sample-specific correlation is\nrevealed between the variation patterns of the shallow-layer feature\ndifferences in the diffusion model and those of deep-layer features. Moreover,\nwe have observed that the features from different model layers form similar\ntrajectories. Based on these observations, we present DiCache, a novel\ntraining-free adaptive caching strategy for accelerating diffusion models at\nruntime, answering both when and how to cache within a unified framework.\nSpecifically, DiCache is composed of two principal components: (1) Online Probe\nProfiling Scheme leverages a shallow-layer online probe to obtain an on-the-fly\nindicator for the caching error in real time, enabling the model to dynamically\ncustomize the caching schedule for each sample. (2) Dynamic Cache Trajectory\nAlignment adaptively approximates the deep-layer feature output from multi-step\nhistorical caches based on the shallow-layer feature trajectory, facilitating\nhigher visual quality. Extensive experiments validate DiCache's capability in\nachieving higher efficiency and improved fidelity over state-of-the-art\napproaches on various leading diffusion models including WAN 2.1, HunyuanVideo\nand Flux."

In this work, we\npropose autoregressive adversarial post-training (AAPT) to transform a\npre-trained latent video diffusion model into a real-time, interactive video\ngenerator. Our model autoregressively generates a latent frame at a time using\na single neural function evaluation (1NFE). The model can stream the result to\nthe user in real time and receive interactive responses as controls to generate\nthe next latent frame. Unlike existing approaches, our method explores\nadversarial training as an effective paradigm for autoregressive generation.\nThis not only allows us to design an architecture that is more efficient for\none-step generation while fully utilizing the KV cache, but also enables\ntraining the model in a student-forcing manner that proves to be effective in\nreducing error accumulation during long video generation. Our experiments\ndemonstrate that our 8B model achieves real-time, 24fps, streaming video\ngeneration at 736x416 resolution on a single H100, or 1280x720 on 8xH100 up to\na minute long (1440 frames).

This paper presents the first systematic investigation\nchallenging the fixed block size assumption in semi-AR decoding.

Extensive experiments across\ndiverse benchmarks show that AdaBlock-dLLM achieves up to 5.3% accuracy\nimprovement under the same throughput budget.

While the gains in throughput are indisputable\nand recent literature has indeed shown minimal degradation on particular\nbenchmarks, in general the consequences of compression in realistic scenarios\nsuch as multi-instruction prompting have been insufficiently studied.

The mainstream sequence\nparallelism (SP) method, Ring Attention, attempts to solve this by distributing\nthe query into multiple query chunks across accelerators and enable each Q\ntensor to access all KV tensors from other accelerators via the Ring AllGather\ncommunication primitive. However, it exhibits low communication efficiency,\nrestricting its practical applicability. This inefficiency stems from the\nmismatch between the Ring AllGather communication primitive it adopts and the\nAlltoAll topology of modern accelerators. A Ring AllGather primitive is\ncomposed of iterations of ring-styled data transfer, which can only utilize a\nvery limited fraction of an AlltoAll topology.\n  Inspired by the Hamiltonian decomposition of complete directed graphs, we\nidentify that modern accelerator topology can be decomposed into multiple\northogonal ring datapaths which can concurrently transfer data without\ninterference. Based on this, we further observe that the Ring AllGather\nprimitive can also be decomposed into the same number of concurrent ring-styled\ndata transfer at every iteration. Based on these insights, we propose TASP, a\ntopology-aware SP method for long-context LLMs that fully utilizes the\ncommunication capacity of modern accelerators via topology decomposition and\nprimitive decomposition. Experimental results on both single-node and\nmulti-node NVIDIA H100 systems and a single-node AMD MI300X system demonstrate\nthat TASP achieves higher communication efficiency than Ring Attention on these\nmodern accelerator topologies and achieves up to 3.58 speedup than Ring\nAttention and its variant Zigzag-Ring Attention.

In this paper, we propose LoLA, a\ntraining-free augmentation to linear attention that boosts associative recall.\nLoLA distributes past key-value pairs from context into three memory systems:\n(i) recent pairs in a local sliding window cache; (ii) difficult-to-memorize\npairs in a sparse, global cache; and (iii) generic pairs in the recurrent\nhidden state of linear attention.

                "summary": "Code generation is a latency-sensitive task that demands high timeliness.\nHowever, with the growing interest and inherent difficulty in repository-level\ncode generation, most existing code generation studies focus on improving the\ncorrectness of generated code while overlooking the inference efficiency, which\nis substantially affected by the overhead during LLM generation. Although there\nhas been work on accelerating LLM inference, these approaches are not tailored\nto the specific characteristics of code generation; instead, they treat code\nthe same as natural language sequences and ignore its unique syntax and\nsemantic characteristics, which are also crucial for improving efficiency.\nConsequently, these approaches exhibit limited effectiveness in code generation\ntasks, particularly for repository-level scenarios with considerable complexity\nand difficulty. To alleviate this issue, following draft-verification paradigm,\nwe propose FastCoder, a simple yet highly efficient inference acceleration\napproach specifically designed for code generation, without compromising the\nquality of the output. FastCoder constructs a multi-source datastore, providing\naccess to both general and project-specific knowledge, facilitating the\nretrieval of high-quality draft sequences.

                    "value": "Code generation is a latency-sensitive task that demands high timeliness.\nHowever, with the growing interest and inherent difficulty in repository-level\ncode generation, most existing code generation studies focus on improving the\ncorrectness of generated code while overlooking the inference efficiency, which\nis substantially affected by the overhead during LLM generation. Although there\nhas been work on accelerating LLM inference, these approaches are not tailored\nto the specific characteristics of code generation; instead, they treat code\nthe same as natural language sequences and ignore its unique syntax and\nsemantic characteristics, which are also crucial for improving efficiency.\nConsequently, these approaches exhibit limited effectiveness in code generation\ntasks, particularly for repository-level scenarios with considerable complexity\nand difficulty. To alleviate this issue, following draft-verification paradigm,\nwe propose FastCoder, a simple yet highly efficient inference acceleration\napproach specifically designed for code generation, without compromising the\nquality of the output. FastCoder constructs a multi-source datastore, providing\naccess to both general and project-specific knowledge, facilitating the\nretrieval of high-quality draft sequences. Moreover, FastCoder reduces the\nretrieval cost by controlling retrieval timing, and enhances efficiency through\nparallel retrieval and a context- and LLM preference-aware cache. Experimental\nresults show that FastCoder can reach up to 2.53x and 2.54x speedup compared to\nautoregressive decoding in repository-level and standalone code generation\ntasks, respectively, outperforming state-of-the-art inference acceleration\napproaches by up to 88%.

Nonetheless, processing\nlong videos remains challenging due to high computational demands and the\nredundancy present in the visual data. In this work, we propose METok, a\ntraining-free, Multi-stage Event-based Token compression framework designed to\naccelerate VLLMs' inference while preserving accuracy. METok progressively\neliminates redundant visual tokens across three critical stages: (1)\nevent-aware compression during vision encoding, (2) hierarchical token pruning\nin the prefilling stage based on semantic alignment and event importance, and\n(3) a decoding-stage KV Cache optimization that further reduces memory\nconsumption. Our experiments on diverse video benchmarks demonstrate that METok\nachieves an optimal trade-off between efficiency and accuracy by dynamically\nselecting informative visual tokens. For instance, equipping LongVA-7B with\nMETok realizes an 80.6% FLOPs reduction and 93.5% KV Cache memory savings, all\nwhile maintaining comparable or even superior accuracy.",

                    "value": "Recent advances in Video Large Language Models (VLLMs) have significantly\nenhanced their ability to understand video content. Nonetheless, processing\nlong videos remains challenging due to high computational demands and the\nredundancy present in the visual data. In this work, we propose METok, a\ntraining-free, Multi-stage Event-based Token compression framework designed to\naccelerate VLLMs' inference while preserving accuracy. METok progressively\neliminates redundant visual tokens across three critical stages: (1)\nevent-aware compression during vision encoding, (2) hierarchical token pruning\nin the prefilling stage based on semantic alignment and event importance, and\n(3) a decoding-stage KV Cache optimization that further reduces memory\nconsumption. Our experiments on diverse video benchmarks demonstrate that METok\nachieves an optimal trade-off between efficiency and accuracy by dynamically\nselecting informative visual tokens. For instance, equipping LongVA-7B with\nMETok realizes an 80.6% FLOPs reduction and 93.5% KV Cache memory savings, all\nwhile maintaining comparable or even superior accuracy."

However,\ndue to the thousands of visual tokens from the video frames, the key-value (KV)\ncache can significantly increase memory requirements, becoming a bottleneck for\ninference speed and memory usage. KV cache quantization is a widely used\napproach to address this problem. In this paper, we find that 2-bit KV\nquantization of VideoLLMs can hardly hurt the model performance, while the\nlimit of KV cache quantization in even lower bits has not been investigated. To\nbridge this gap, we introduce VidKV, a plug-and-play KV cache quantization\nmethod to compress the KV cache to lower than 2 bits. Specifically, (1) for\nkey, we propose a mixed-precision quantization strategy in the channel\ndimension, where we perform 2-bit quantization for anomalous channels and 1-bit\nquantization combined with FFT for normal channels; (2) for value, we implement\n1.58-bit quantization while selectively filtering semantically salient visual\ntokens for targeted preservation, for a better trade-off between precision and\nmodel performance. Importantly, our findings suggest that the value cache of\nVideoLLMs should be quantized in a per-channel fashion instead of the per-token\nfashion proposed by prior KV cache quantization works for LLMs. Empirically,\nextensive results with LLaVA-OV-7B and Qwen2.5-VL-7B on six benchmarks show\nthat VidKV effectively compresses the KV cache to 1.5-bit and 1.58-bit\nprecision with almost no performance drop compared to the FP16 counterparts.",

Second, the large number of visual tokens\nsubstantially slows down the drafter's self-attention during the decoding\nstage.

To train the drafter efficiently, we introduces multi-step\nself-feedback training strategy with dynamic data selection and sequential\nembedding supervision to simulate reasoning during training.

These\nalgorithms, however, employ public keys and signatures that are 3 to 9$\\times$\nlonger than those used in pre-quantum cryptography, resulting in significant\nperformance and energy efficiency overheads. A critical bottleneck identified\nin our analysis is the cache bandwidth. This limitation motivates the adoption\nof on-chip in-/near-cache computing, a computing paradigm that offers\nhigh-performance, exceptional energy efficiency, and flexibility to accelerate\npost-quantum cryptographic algorithms. Our analysis of existing works reveals\nchallenges in integrating in-/near-cache computing into modern computer systems\nand performance limitations due to external bandwidth limitation, highlighting\nthe need for innovative solutions that can seamlessly integrate into existing\nsystems without performance and energy efficiency issues. In this paper, we\nintroduce a near-cache-slice computing paradigm with support of customization\nand virtual address, named Crypto-Near-Cache (CNC), designed to accelerate\npost-quantum cryptographic algorithms and other applications.

These\nalgorithms, however, employ public keys and signatures that are 3 to 9$\\times$\nlonger than those used in pre-quantum cryptography, resulting in significant\nperformance and energy efficiency overheads. A critical bottleneck identified\nin our analysis is the cache bandwidth. This limitation motivates the adoption\nof on-chip in-/near-cache computing, a computing paradigm that offers\nhigh-performance, exceptional energy efficiency, and flexibility to accelerate\npost-quantum cryptographic algorithms. Our analysis of existing works reveals\nchallenges in integrating in-/near-cache computing into modern computer systems\nand performance limitations due to external bandwidth limitation, highlighting\nthe need for innovative solutions that can seamlessly integrate into existing\nsystems without performance and energy efficiency issues. In this paper, we\nintroduce a near-cache-slice computing paradigm with support of customization\nand virtual address, named Crypto-Near-Cache (CNC), designed to accelerate\npost-quantum cryptographic algorithms and other applications. By placing SRAM\narrays with bitline computing capability near cache slices, high internal\nbandwidth and short data movement are achieved with native support of virtual\naddressing. An ISA extension to facilitate CNC is also proposed, with detailed\ndiscussion on the implementation aspects of the core/cache datapath."

This makes KV cache compression a\ncritical step toward efficient long-context inference. Recent methods have\nexplored low-rank techniques to reduce the hidden size of the KV cache.\nHowever, they neglect the distinct roles and varying importance of Keys and\nValues, leading to significant performance drops under high compression. To\naddress this, we propose ReCalKV, a post-training low-rank KV cache compression\napproach with tailored strategies for Keys and Values. For Keys, we propose\nHead-wise Similarity aware Reordering (HSR), which clusters structurally\nsimilar heads into groups, enabling more accurate low-rank approximation via\ngrouped SVD. For Values, we propose Offline Value Calibration (OVC), which\nefficiently calibrates the value projection matrix using calibration data\nwithout training, ensuring an accurate representation of contextual\ninformation. Extensive experiments show that ReCalKV consistently outperforms\nexisting low-rank compression methods, achieving high compression ratios with\nminimal performance loss.

Causal attention AR models support KV caching for\nfaster inference, but often degrade in quality on long videos due to memory\nchallenges during long-video training. In addition, beyond static prompt-based\ngeneration, interactive capabilities, such as streaming prompt inputs, are\ncritical for dynamic content creation, enabling users to guide narratives in\nreal time. This interactive requirement significantly increases complexity,\nespecially in ensuring visual consistency and semantic coherence during prompt\ntransitions. To address these challenges, LongLive adopts a causal, frame-level\nAR design that integrates a KV-recache mechanism that refreshes cached states\nwith new prompts for smooth, adherent switches; streaming long tuning to enable\nlong video training and to align training and inference (train-long-test-long);\nand short window attention paired with a frame-level attention sink, shorten as\nframe sink, preserving long-range consistency while enabling faster generation.\nWith these key designs, LongLive fine-tunes a 1.3B-parameter short-clip model\nto minute-long generation in just 32 GPU-days. At inference, LongLive sustains\n20.7 FPS on a single NVIDIA H100, achieves strong performance on VBench in both\nshort and long videos.

This type of method suffers from\nspatial information loss, computational redundancy, and memory bloat, which\nimpede efficient navigation. Inspired by the implicit scene representation in\nhuman navigation, analogous to the left brain's semantic understanding and the\nright brain's spatial cognition, we propose JanusVLN, a novel VLN framework\nfeaturing a dual implicit neural memory that models spatial-geometric and\nvisual-semantic memory as separate, compact, and fixed-size neural\nrepresentations. This framework first extends the MLLM to incorporate 3D prior\nknowledge from the spatial-geometric encoder, thereby enhancing the spatial\nreasoning capabilities of models based solely on RGB input. Then, the\nhistorical key-value caches from the spatial-geometric and visual-semantic\nencoders are constructed into a dual implicit memory. By retaining only the KVs\nof tokens in the initial and sliding window, redundant computation is avoided,\nenabling efficient incremental updates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nJanusVLN outperforms over 20 recent methods to achieve SOTA performance. For\nexample, the success rate improves by 10.5-35.5 compared to methods using\nmultiple data types as input and by 3.6-10.8 compared to methods using more RGB\ntraining data.

                "summary": "Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) excel at visual generation yet remain hampered\nby slow sampling. Existing training-free accelerators - step reduction, feature\ncaching, and sparse attention - enhance inference speed but typically rely on a\nuniform heuristic or a manually designed adaptive strategy for all images,\nleaving quality on the table. Alternatively, dynamic neural networks offer\nper-image adaptive acceleration, but their high fine-tuning costs limit broader\napplicability.

In this paper, we present\nLoopServe, an adaptive dual-phase inference acceleration framework for large\nlanguage models in multi-turn dialogues. LoopServe introduces two main\ninnovations.

In this paper, we introduce MALT\n(Multi-Agent LLM Training), a novel post-training strategy that divides the\nreasoning process into generation, verification, and refinement steps using a\nsequential pipeline of heterogeneous agents. During data generation, each agent\nis repeatedly sampled to form a multi-agent search tree, where final outputs\nare graded against ground-truth data. We then apply value iteration to\npropagate reward signals back to each role-conditioned model, automatically\nproducing multi-agent post-training data without human or teacher-model\nsupervision. Our off-policy approach allows each agent to specialize by\nlearning from correct and incorrect trajectories, ultimately improving the\nend-to-end reasoning chain. On MATH, GSM8K, and CSQA, MALT surpasses the same\nbaseline LLM with a relative improvement of 15.66%, 7.42%, and 9.40%\nrespectively, making it an important advance towards multi-agent cooperative\ntraining.",

In this paper, we introduce MALT\n(Multi-Agent LLM Training), a novel post-training strategy that divides the\nreasoning process into generation, verification, and refinement steps using a\nsequential pipeline of heterogeneous agents. During data generation, each agent\nis repeatedly sampled to form a multi-agent search tree, where final outputs\nare graded against ground-truth data. We then apply value iteration to\npropagate reward signals back to each role-conditioned model, automatically\nproducing multi-agent post-training data without human or teacher-model\nsupervision. Our off-policy approach allows each agent to specialize by\nlearning from correct and incorrect trajectories, ultimately improving the\nend-to-end reasoning chain. On MATH, GSM8K, and CSQA, MALT surpasses the same\nbaseline LLM with a relative improvement of 15.66%, 7.42%, and 9.40%\nrespectively, making it an important advance towards multi-agent cooperative\ntraining."

These misleading responses\nprovide false signals to the attacker's internal optimization loop, causing the\nadversarial search to terminate prematurely and effectively jailbreaking the\njailbreak. By conducting extensive experiments across state-of-the-art LLMs,\njailbreaking frameworks, and safety benchmarks, our method consistently and\nsignificantly reduces attack success rates by up to 92\\%. When combined with\nother defense frameworks, it further reduces the success rate of the latest\nattack strategies to 0\\%.

Vision based strategies often struggle in the environments due to\ngaps, curved crop rows and require post-processing steps. Furthermore, labeling\ncrop rows in under the canopy environments accurately is very difficult due to\nocclusions. This study introduces RowDetr, an efficient end-to-end\ntransformer-based neural network for crop row detection in precision\nagriculture. RowDetr leverages a lightweight backbone and a hybrid encoder to\nmodel straight, curved, or occluded crop rows with high precision. Central to\nthe architecture is a novel polynomial representation that enables direct\nparameterization of crop rows, eliminating computationally expensive\npost-processing. Key innovations include a PolySampler module and multi-scale\ndeformable attention, which work together with PolyOptLoss, an energy-based\nloss function designed to optimize geometric alignment between predicted and\nthe annotated crop rows, while also enhancing robustness against labeling\nnoise. RowDetr was evaluated against other state-of-the-art end-to-end crop row\ndetection methods like AgroNav and RolColAttention on a diverse dataset of\n6,962 high-resolution images, used for training, validation, and testing across\nmultiple crop types with annotated crop rows. The system demonstrated superior\nperformance, achieved an F1 score up to 0.74 and a lane position deviation as\nlow as 0.405. Furthermore, RowDetr achieves a real-time inference latency of\n6.7ms, which was optimized to 3.5ms with INT8 quantization on an NVIDIA Jetson\nOrin AGX.

Improving\noversight quality can be expensive or infeasible, motivating methods that\nimprove learned behavior despite an imperfect training signal. We introduce\nInoculation Prompting (IP), a simple but counterintuitive technique that\nprevents learning of an undesired behavior by modifying training prompts to\nexplicitly request it. For example, to inoculate against reward hacking, we\nmodify the prompts used in supervised fine-tuning to request code that only\nworks on provided test cases but fails on other inputs. Across four settings we\nfind that IP reduces the learning of undesired behavior without substantially\nreducing the learning of desired capabilities. We also show that prompts which\nmore strongly elicit the undesired behavior prior to fine-tuning more\neffectively inoculate against the behavior when used during training; this\nserves as a heuristic to identify promising inoculation prompts. Overall, IP is\na simple yet effective way to control how models generalize from fine-tuning,\npreventing learning of undesired behaviors without substantially disrupting\ndesired capabilities.",

Improving\noversight quality can be expensive or infeasible, motivating methods that\nimprove learned behavior despite an imperfect training signal. We introduce\nInoculation Prompting (IP), a simple but counterintuitive technique that\nprevents learning of an undesired behavior by modifying training prompts to\nexplicitly request it. For example, to inoculate against reward hacking, we\nmodify the prompts used in supervised fine-tuning to request code that only\nworks on provided test cases but fails on other inputs. Across four settings we\nfind that IP reduces the learning of undesired behavior without substantially\nreducing the learning of desired capabilities. We also show that prompts which\nmore strongly elicit the undesired behavior prior to fine-tuning more\neffectively inoculate against the behavior when used during training; this\nserves as a heuristic to identify promising inoculation prompts. Overall, IP is\na simple yet effective way to control how models generalize from fine-tuning,\npreventing learning of undesired behaviors without substantially disrupting\ndesired capabilities."

In contrast, recent large language models require exposure to\nbillions of training tokens to achieve such generalization. What mechanisms\nunderlie such efficient developmental learning in humans? This study addresses\nthis question through simulation experiments in which robots learn to perform\nvarious actions corresponding to imperative sentences (e.g., \\textit{push red\ncube}) via trials of self-guided exploration. Our approach integrates the\nactive inference framework with reinforcement learning, enabling\ncuriosity-driven developmental learning. The simulations yielded several\nnontrivial findings: i) Curiosity-driven exploration combined with motor noise\nsubstantially outperforms learning without curiosity. ii) Simpler,\nprerequisite-like actions emerge earlier in development, while more complex\nactions involving these prerequisites develop later. iii) Rote pairing of\nsentences and actions occurs before the emergence of compositional\ngeneralization. iv) Generalization is drastically improved as the number of\ncompositional elements increases. These results shed light into possible\nmechanisms underlying efficient co-developmental learning in infants and\nprovide computational parallels to findings in developmental psychology.",

In contrast, recent large language models require exposure to\nbillions of training tokens to achieve such generalization. What mechanisms\nunderlie such efficient developmental learning in humans? This study addresses\nthis question through simulation experiments in which robots learn to perform\nvarious actions corresponding to imperative sentences (e.g., \\textit{push red\ncube}) via trials of self-guided exploration. Our approach integrates the\nactive inference framework with reinforcement learning, enabling\ncuriosity-driven developmental learning. The simulations yielded several\nnontrivial findings: i) Curiosity-driven exploration combined with motor noise\nsubstantially outperforms learning without curiosity. ii) Simpler,\nprerequisite-like actions emerge earlier in development, while more complex\nactions involving these prerequisites develop later. iii) Rote pairing of\nsentences and actions occurs before the emergence of compositional\ngeneralization. iv) Generalization is drastically improved as the number of\ncompositional elements increases. These results shed light into possible\nmechanisms underlying efficient co-developmental learning in infants and\nprovide computational parallels to findings in developmental psychology."

While these attacks have received considerable attention in\nhorizontal FL, they are less understood for vertical FL (VFL), where devices\nhold different features of the samples, and only the server holds the labels.\nIn this work, we propose a novel backdoor attack on VFL which (i) does not rely\non gradient information from the server and (ii) considers potential collusion\namong multiple adversaries for sample selection and trigger embedding. Our\nlabel inference model augments variational autoencoders with metric learning,\nwhich adversaries can train locally.

In response, prediction-based\n(PB) inference has emerged to accommodate statistical analysis using a large\nvolume of predictions together with a small amount of gold-standard data. The\ngoals of PB inference are two-fold: (i) to mitigate bias from errors in\npredictions and (ii) to improve efficiency relative to classical inference\nusing only the gold-standard data. While early PB inference methods focused on\nbias, their ability to enhance efficiency remains a focus of ongoing research.\nWe revisit a foundational PB inference method and show that a simple\nmodification can be applied to guarantee provable improvements in efficiency.\nIn doing so, we establish new connections between augmented inverse probability\nweighted estimators (AIPW) and several recently proposed PB inference methods\nwith a similar focus. The utility of our proposal, which leverages\nprediction-based outcomes to enhance efficiency, is demonstrated through\nextensive simulation studies and an application to real data from the UK\nBiobank. Further, we contextualize PB inference by drawing connections to\nhistorical literature from economics and statistics, highlighting how classic\nmethods directly inform this contemporary problem.",

                    "value": "From structural biology to epidemiology, predictions from machine learning\n(ML) models increasingly complement costly gold-standard data to enable faster,\nmore affordable, and scalable scientific inquiry. In response, prediction-based\n(PB) inference has emerged to accommodate statistical analysis using a large\nvolume of predictions together with a small amount of gold-standard data. The\ngoals of PB inference are two-fold: (i) to mitigate bias from errors in\npredictions and (ii) to improve efficiency relative to classical inference\nusing only the gold-standard data. While early PB inference methods focused on\nbias, their ability to enhance efficiency remains a focus of ongoing research.\nWe revisit a foundational PB inference method and show that a simple\nmodification can be applied to guarantee provable improvements in efficiency.\nIn doing so, we establish new connections between augmented inverse probability\nweighted estimators (AIPW) and several recently proposed PB inference methods\nwith a similar focus. The utility of our proposal, which leverages\nprediction-based outcomes to enhance efficiency, is demonstrated through\nextensive simulation studies and an application to real data from the UK\nBiobank. Further, we contextualize PB inference by drawing connections to\nhistorical literature from economics and statistics, highlighting how classic\nmethods directly inform this contemporary problem."

The results provide evidence in\nsupport of the protocol's capability of capturing one- and two-way\nintelligibility in human-LLM interaction; and for the utility of two-way\nintelligibility in the design of human-machine systems. Our code is available\nat https://github.com/karannb/interact."

We aim to\ninvestigate differences between H-shell (Red-Giant Branch; RGB) and He-burning\n(red clump and Asymptotic-Giant Branch; AGB) stars in the He-II ionisation zone\nand the sensitivity of seismic parameters to input physics in stellar models.\nWe used a grid of stellar models with masses $0.8-2.5M_\\odot$ and metallicities\n$-1.0-0.25$dex, including mass loss, overshooting, thermohaline mixing, and\nrotation-induced mixing. P-mode frequencies were inferred by suppressing\ng-modes in the core. The main factors affecting seismic observables are stellar\nmass and metallicity. The He-II glitch amplitude in the local large frequency\nseparation $\\Delta\\nu$ correlates with the He-II ionisation zone density,\nexplaining observed differences between RGB and clump/AGB stars. That amplitude\nexceeds 10% of $\\Delta\\nu$ in high-luminosity giants, making the asymptotic\nexpansion less accurate when $\\Delta\\nu \\le 0.5\\,\\mu$Hz. Mass loss on the RGB\nand rotation-induced mixing from the main sequence to the early-AGB produce\nphase differences in the He-II glitch modulation signature between RGB and\nclump/AGB stars.

Seismic observables\nhelp infer interior structures via comparisons with stellar models. We aim to\ninvestigate differences between H-shell (Red-Giant Branch; RGB) and He-burning\n(red clump and Asymptotic-Giant Branch; AGB) stars in the He-II ionisation zone\nand the sensitivity of seismic parameters to input physics in stellar models.\nWe used a grid of stellar models with masses $0.8-2.5M_\\odot$ and metallicities\n$-1.0-0.25$dex, including mass loss, overshooting, thermohaline mixing, and\nrotation-induced mixing. P-mode frequencies were inferred by suppressing\ng-modes in the core. The main factors affecting seismic observables are stellar\nmass and metallicity. The He-II glitch amplitude in the local large frequency\nseparation $\\Delta\\nu$ correlates with the He-II ionisation zone density,\nexplaining observed differences between RGB and clump/AGB stars. That amplitude\nexceeds 10% of $\\Delta\\nu$ in high-luminosity giants, making the asymptotic\nexpansion less accurate when $\\Delta\\nu \\le 0.5\\,\\mu$Hz. Mass loss on the RGB\nand rotation-induced mixing from the main sequence to the early-AGB produce\nphase differences in the He-II glitch modulation signature between RGB and\nclump/AGB stars. Efficient RGB mass loss (for $M \\le 1.5\\,M_\\odot$) and mixing\nprocesses (for $M \\ge 1.5\\,M_\\odot$) leave detectable signatures in p-mode\nfrequencies, enabling classification of red giants."

We\ncreated a dataset of 50 base questions spanning mathematics, science, and\nhistory, each rewritten into five tone variants: Very Polite, Polite, Neutral,\nRude, and Very Rude, yielding 250 unique prompts. Using ChatGPT 4o, we\nevaluated responses across these conditions and applied paired sample t-tests\nto assess statistical significance. Contrary to expectations, impolite prompts\nconsistently outperformed polite ones, with accuracy ranging from 80.8% for\nVery Polite prompts to 84.8% for Very Rude prompts. These findings differ from\nearlier studies that associated rudeness with poorer outcomes, suggesting that\nnewer LLMs may respond differently to tonal variation.

Evaluating web agents trajectories is an important\nproblem, since it helps us determine whether the agent successfully completed\nthe tasks. Rule-based methods are widely used for this purpose, but they are\nchallenging to extend to new tasks and may not always recognize successful\ntrajectories. We may achieve higher accuracy through human evaluation, but the\nprocess would be substantially slower and more expensive. Automatic evaluations\nwith LLMs may avoid the challenges of designing new rules and manually\nannotating trajectories, enabling faster and cost-effective evaluation.\nHowever, it is unclear how effective they are at evaluating web agents. To this\nend, we propose AgentRewardBench, the first benchmark to assess the\neffectiveness of LLM judges for evaluating web agents. AgentRewardBench\ncontains 1302 trajectories across 5 benchmarks and 4 LLMs. Each trajectory in\nAgentRewardBench is reviewed by an expert, who answers questions pertaining to\nthe success, side effects, and repetitiveness of the agent. Using our\nbenchmark, we evaluate 12 LLM judges and find that no single LLM excels across\nall benchmarks. We also find that the rule-based evaluation used by common\nbenchmarks tends to underreport the success rate of web agents, highlighting a\nkey weakness of rule-based evaluation and the need to develop more flexible\nautomatic evaluations.

However, variability in training\ndata can hinder a model's ability to generalize across domains. This paper\nstudies the problem of dataset alignment for Natural Language to SQL (NL2SQL or\ntext to SQL), examining how well SFT training data matches the structural\ncharacteristics of target queries and how this alignment impacts model\nperformance.

A growing number of\nalignment-based fine-tuning algorithms and benchmarks emerged recently, fueling\nthe efforts on effective alignments of pre-trained LLMs to ensure helpful,\nharmless, and honest answers from both open-source and closed-source LLMs. This\npaper tackles this problem by developing an alignment fusion approach, coined\nas $H^3$Fusion, with three unique characteristics. First, $H^3$Fusion ensembles\nmultiple individually aligned LLMs to create a final fine-tuned alignment model\nwith enhanced capabilities beyond those of individual models, delivering robust\nalignment through promoting helpful, harmless, honest fusion. Second,\n$H^3$Fusion leverages the mixture-of-experts (MoE) methodology in two steps. We\nfirst freeze the multi-head attention weights of each individual model while\ntuning the FFN layer during alignment fusion. Then we merge the aligned model\nweights with an expert router according to the type of input instruction and\ndynamically select a subset of experts that are best suited for producing the\noutput response. Finally, we boost the performance of the resulting\n$H^3$3Fusion model by introducing gating loss and regularization terms. The\nformer penalizes the selection errors of the expert-router, and the latter\nmediates the expert weights drifting during fine-tuning and dynamically adjusts\nthe fusion behavior of the resulting model by canalizing the activations on the\nexperts. Extensive evaluations on three benchmark datasets show that\n$H^3$3Fusion is more helpful, less harmful, and more honest from two aspects:\nit outperforms each individually aligned model by $11.37\\%$, and it provides\nstronger robustness compared to the state-of-the-art LLM ensemble approaches by\n$13.77\\%$.

Recent defenses against prompt injection, such as Instruction Hierarchy\nand SecAlign, have shown notable robustness against static attacks. However, to\nmore thoroughly evaluate the robustness of these defenses, it is arguably\nnecessary to employ strong attacks such as automated red-teaming. To this end,\nwe introduce RL-Hammer, a simple recipe for training attacker models that\nautomatically learn to perform strong prompt injections and jailbreaks via\nreinforcement learning. RL-Hammer requires no warm-up data and can be trained\nentirely from scratch. To achieve high ASRs against industrial-level models\nwith defenses, we propose a set of practical techniques that enable highly\neffective, universal attacks. Using this pipeline, RL-Hammer reaches a 98% ASR\nagainst GPT-4o and a $72\\%$ ASR against GPT-5 with the Instruction Hierarchy\ndefense. We further discuss the challenge of achieving high diversity in\nattacks, highlighting how attacker models tend to reward-hack diversity\nobjectives. Finally, we show that RL-Hammer can evade multiple prompt injection\ndetectors. We hope our work advances automatic red-teaming and motivates the\ndevelopment of stronger, more principled defenses.

As part of the standard\nreporting workflow, a junior radiologist typically prepares a preliminary\nreport, which is then reviewed and edited by a senior radiologist to produce\nthe final report. Identifying semantic differences between preliminary and\nfinal reports is essential for junior doctors, both as a training tool and to\nhelp uncover gaps in clinical knowledge. While AI in radiology is a rapidly\ngrowing field, the application of large language models (LLMs) remains\nchallenging due to the need for specialised domain knowledge.

                "summary": "Accurately predicting conversion rate (CVR) is essential in various\nrecommendation domains such as online advertising systems and e-commerce. These\nsystems utilize user interaction logs, which consist of exposures, clicks, and\nconversions. CVR prediction models are typically trained solely based on\nclicked samples, as conversions can only be determined following clicks.\nHowever, the sparsity of clicked instances necessitates the collection of a\nsubstantial amount of logs for effective model training. Recent works address\nthis issue by devising frameworks that leverage non-clicked samples. While\nthese frameworks aim to reduce biases caused by the discrepancy between clicked\nand non-clicked samples, they often rely on heuristics. Against this\nbackground, we propose a method to counterfactually generate conversion labels\nfor non-clicked samples by using causality as a guiding principle, attempting\nto answer the question, \"Would the user have converted if he or she had clicked\nthe recommended item?\" Our approach is named the Entire Space Counterfactual\nInference Multi-task Model (ESCIM). We initially train a structural causal\nmodel (SCM) of user sequential behaviors and conduct a hypothetical\nintervention (i.e., click) on non-clicked items to infer counterfactual CVRs.\nWe then introduce several approaches to transform predicted counterfactual CVRs\ninto binary counterfactual conversion labels for the non-clicked samples.\nFinally, the generated samples are incorporated into the training process.\nExtensive experiments on public datasets illustrate the superiority of the\nproposed algorithm. Online A/B testing further empirically validates the\neffectiveness of our proposed algorithm in real-world scenarios.

                    "value": "Accurately predicting conversion rate (CVR) is essential in various\nrecommendation domains such as online advertising systems and e-commerce. These\nsystems utilize user interaction logs, which consist of exposures, clicks, and\nconversions. CVR prediction models are typically trained solely based on\nclicked samples, as conversions can only be determined following clicks.\nHowever, the sparsity of clicked instances necessitates the collection of a\nsubstantial amount of logs for effective model training. Recent works address\nthis issue by devising frameworks that leverage non-clicked samples. While\nthese frameworks aim to reduce biases caused by the discrepancy between clicked\nand non-clicked samples, they often rely on heuristics. Against this\nbackground, we propose a method to counterfactually generate conversion labels\nfor non-clicked samples by using causality as a guiding principle, attempting\nto answer the question, \"Would the user have converted if he or she had clicked\nthe recommended item?\" Our approach is named the Entire Space Counterfactual\nInference Multi-task Model (ESCIM). We initially train a structural causal\nmodel (SCM) of user sequential behaviors and conduct a hypothetical\nintervention (i.e., click) on non-clicked items to infer counterfactual CVRs.\nWe then introduce several approaches to transform predicted counterfactual CVRs\ninto binary counterfactual conversion labels for the non-clicked samples.\nFinally, the generated samples are incorporated into the training process.\nExtensive experiments on public datasets illustrate the superiority of the\nproposed algorithm. Online A/B testing further empirically validates the\neffectiveness of our proposed algorithm in real-world scenarios. In addition,\nwe demonstrate the improved performance of the proposed method on latent\nconversion data, showcasing its robustness and superior generalization\ncapabilities."

Our theory shows that BVPO strictly reduces\ntrace-induced variance for any nontrivial mixture, provides a closed-form\nchoice of the mixing weight that minimizes mean-squared error relative to the\ntrue marginal gradient, and under standard smoothness and step-size conditions,\ntightens classical convergence bounds for stochastic gradient descent.\nEmpirically, BVPO improves alignment over the best baseline by up to 7.8 points\non AlpacaEval~2 and 6.8 points on Arena-Hard. Despite being trained only on\ngeneral conversational data, BVPO also boosts reasoning performance for base\nmodels by up to 4.0 points on the average of six math reasoning benchmarks.\nThese results identify variance from trace sampling as a key bottleneck and\ndemonstrate that directly optimizing the bias--variance trade-off yields more\nstable training and stronger overall performance."

                "summary": "Electrospray thrusters are emerging as a leading propulsion technology for\nCubeSats, offering high specific impulse ($I_{sp} > 1000$ s) and low power\nrequirements. However, the divergent ion plumes can impinge on spacecraft\nsurfaces, particularly body-mounted solar arrays, causing contamination and\nthrust efficiency losses. This study presents a validated particle-tracking\nsimulation to quantify the effects of thruster placement on thrust efficiency\nand surface contamination for 1U, 3U, and 6U CubeSats. The plume model employs\na cosine power distribution ($k=1.8$) with half-angle $46^\\circ$, validated\nagainst experimental data with errors below 7%. Results show that thrust\nefficiency ranges from 53.6% for rear-mounted thrusters on 3U body-mounted\nconfigurations to 100% for side-mounted configurations with deployable arrays.\nCubeSat size significantly affects impingement: 3U platforms experience 46.4%\ncontamination with rear-mounted thrusters compared to 16.6% for 1U.

However, the divergent ion plumes can impinge on spacecraft\nsurfaces, particularly body-mounted solar arrays, causing contamination and\nthrust efficiency losses. This study presents a validated particle-tracking\nsimulation to quantify the effects of thruster placement on thrust efficiency\nand surface contamination for 1U, 3U, and 6U CubeSats. The plume model employs\na cosine power distribution ($k=1.8$) with half-angle $46^\\circ$, validated\nagainst experimental data with errors below 7%. Results show that thrust\nefficiency ranges from 53.6% for rear-mounted thrusters on 3U body-mounted\nconfigurations to 100% for side-mounted configurations with deployable arrays.\nCubeSat size significantly affects impingement: 3U platforms experience 46.4%\ncontamination with rear-mounted thrusters compared to 16.6% for 1U. Deployable\nsolar arrays reduce contamination by 77% compared to body-mounted arrays, while\nside-mounted thrusters eliminate impingement entirely at the cost of only 1.6%\nefficiency loss.

Recent models relying on\nthis paradigm have massively scaled the sizes of their query and document\nrepresentations, presenting obstacles to deployment and scalability in\nreal-world pipelines. Furthermore, purely vision-centric approaches may be\nconstrained by the inherent modality gap still exhibited by modern\nvision-language models. In this work, we connect these challenges to the\nparadigm of hybrid retrieval, investigating whether a lightweight dense text\nretriever can enhance a stronger vision-centric model. Existing hybrid methods,\nwhich rely on coarse-grained fusion of ranks or scores, fail to exploit the\nrich interactions within each model's representation space. To address this, we\nintroduce Guided Query Refinement (GQR), a novel test-time optimization method\nthat refines a primary retriever's query embedding using guidance from a\ncomplementary retriever's scores. Through extensive experiments on visual\ndocument retrieval benchmarks, we demonstrate that GQR allows vision-centric\nmodels to match the performance of models with significantly larger\nrepresentations, while being up to 14x faster and requiring 54x less memory.\nOur findings show that GQR effectively pushes the Pareto frontier for\nperformance and efficiency in multimodal retrieval.

Such variation can introduce systematic biases and random errors,\nwhich propagate to downstream analyses and cause Type I (false positive), Type\nII (false negative), Type S (wrong sign), or Type M (exaggerated effect)\nerrors.

For instance, in creative writing, VS increases diversity\nby 1.6-2.1x over direct prompting. We further observe an emergent trend that\nmore capable models benefit more from VS.

However, the underutilization of\nthese guidelines, stemming from the difficulty of mapping unstructured patient\nnarratives to structured criteria, contributes to suboptimal patient outcomes\nand increased healthcare costs. To bridge this gap, we introduce a multi-agent\ncognitive architecture that automates the translation of free-text clinical\nscenarios into specific, guideline-adherent imaging recommendations. Our system\nleverages a novel, domain-adapted dense retrieval model, ColBERT, fine-tuned on\na synthetically generated dataset of 8,840 clinical scenario-recommendation\npairs to achieve highly accurate information retrieval from the ACR-AC\nknowledge base. This retriever identifies candidate guidelines with a 93.9%\ntop-10 recall, which are then processed by a sequence of LLM-based agents for\nselection and evidence-based synthesis. We evaluate our architecture using\nGPT-4.1 and MedGemma agents, demonstrating a state-of-the-art exact match\naccuracy of 81%, meaning that in 81% of test cases the predicted procedure set\nwas identical to the guideline's reference set, and an F1-score of 0.879. This\nrepresents a 67-percentage-point absolute improvement in accuracy over a strong\nstandalone GPT-4.1 baseline, underscoring the contribution that our\narchitecture makes to a frontier model.

With\nthe rise of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques, users can now\ncustomize powerful pre-trained models using minimal computational resources.\nHowever, the widespread sharing of fine-tuned DMs on open platforms raises\ngrowing ethical and legal concerns, as these models may inadvertently or\ndeliberately generate sensitive or unauthorized content. Despite increasing\nregulatory attention on generative AI, there are currently no practical tools\nfor systematically auditing these models before deployment.\n  In this paper, we address the problem of concept auditing: determining\nwhether a fine-tuned DM has learned to generate a specific target concept.\nExisting approaches typically rely on prompt-based input crafting and\noutput-based image classification but they suffer from critical limitations,\nincluding prompt uncertainty, concept drift, and poor scalability. To overcome\nthese challenges, we introduce Prompt-Agnostic Image-Free Auditing (PAIA), a\nnovel, model-centric concept auditing framework. By treating the DM as the\nobject of inspection, PAIA enables direct analysis of internal model behavior,\nbypassing the need for optimized prompts or generated images. We evaluate PAIA\non 320 controlled models trained with curated concept datasets and 771\nreal-world community models sourced from a public DM sharing platform.\nEvaluation results show that PAIA achieves over 90% detection accuracy while\nreducing auditing time by 18 - 40X compared to existing baselines.

Unlike prior methods that\nrely on multiple sampling passes or external verification sources, LSD operates\nintrinsically within the model's representational space. Using margin-based\ncontrastive learning, LSD aligns hidden activations with ground-truth\nembeddings derived from a factual encoder, revealing a distinct separation in\nsemantic trajectories: factual responses preserve stable alignment, while\nhallucinations exhibit pronounced semantic drift across depth. Evaluated on the\nTruthfulQA and synthetic factual-hallucination datasets, LSD achieves an\nF1-score of 0.92, AUROC of 0.96, and clustering accuracy of 0.89, outperforming\nSelfCheckGPT and Semantic Entropy baselines while requiring only a single\nforward pass. This efficiency yields a 5-20x speedup over sampling-based\nmethods without sacrificing precision or interpretability.

Yet, existing\nsafety benchmarks rarely test vulnerabilities in domains such as political\nmanipulation, propaganda and disinformation generation, or surveillance and\ninformation control. We introduce SocialHarmBench, a dataset of 585 prompts\nspanning 7 sociopolitical categories and 34 countries, designed to surface\nwhere LLMs most acutely fail in politically charged contexts. Our evaluations\nreveal several shortcomings: open-weight models exhibit high vulnerability to\nharmful compliance, with Mistral-7B reaching attack success rates as high as\n97% to 98% in domains such as historical revisionism, propaganda, and political\nmanipulation. Moreover, temporal and geographic analyses show that LLMs are\nmost fragile when confronted with 21st-century or pre-20th-century contexts,\nand when responding to prompts tied to regions such as Latin America, the USA,\nand the UK.

Yet, existing\nsafety benchmarks rarely test vulnerabilities in domains such as political\nmanipulation, propaganda and disinformation generation, or surveillance and\ninformation control. We introduce SocialHarmBench, a dataset of 585 prompts\nspanning 7 sociopolitical categories and 34 countries, designed to surface\nwhere LLMs most acutely fail in politically charged contexts. Our evaluations\nreveal several shortcomings: open-weight models exhibit high vulnerability to\nharmful compliance, with Mistral-7B reaching attack success rates as high as\n97% to 98% in domains such as historical revisionism, propaganda, and political\nmanipulation. Moreover, temporal and geographic analyses show that LLMs are\nmost fragile when confronted with 21st-century or pre-20th-century contexts,\nand when responding to prompts tied to regions such as Latin America, the USA,\nand the UK. These findings demonstrate that current safeguards fail to\ngeneralize to high-stakes sociopolitical settings, exposing systematic biases\nand raising concerns about the reliability of LLMs in preserving human rights\nand democratic values.

Recent defenses against prompt injection, such as Instruction Hierarchy\nand SecAlign, have shown notable robustness against static attacks. However, to\nmore thoroughly evaluate the robustness of these defenses, it is arguably\nnecessary to employ strong attacks such as automated red-teaming. To this end,\nwe introduce RL-Hammer, a simple recipe for training attacker models that\nautomatically learn to perform strong prompt injections and jailbreaks via\nreinforcement learning. RL-Hammer requires no warm-up data and can be trained\nentirely from scratch. To achieve high ASRs against industrial-level models\nwith defenses, we propose a set of practical techniques that enable highly\neffective, universal attacks. Using this pipeline, RL-Hammer reaches a 98% ASR\nagainst GPT-4o and a $72\\%$ ASR against GPT-5 with the Instruction Hierarchy\ndefense. We further discuss the challenge of achieving high diversity in\nattacks, highlighting how attacker models tend to reward-hack diversity\nobjectives. Finally, we show that RL-Hammer can evade multiple prompt injection\ndetectors. We hope our work advances automatic red-teaming and motivates the\ndevelopment of stronger, more principled defenses.

We argue that these tasks challenge the ability of\nvisual-to-textual conversion, where MLLMs convert visual information perceived\nfrom the input scene, to textual information for further reasoning and\ngenerating the answer. If the complexity of the visual input is beyond the\nperceptual capability of the MLLMs, without decomposing this conversion\nprocess, simply scaling inference-time reasoning cannot solve the task because\nit repeatedly encounters the same perceptual bottleneck. We propose an\napproach, autonomous imagination, to enable MLLMs to iteratively modify visual\ninputs (e.g. isolating objects, rearranging puzzle pieces) into intermediate\nvisual states, decomposing visual-to-textual conversion into closed-loop visual\nmodification steps. We show that, without any retraining, MLLMs can now solve\ntasks initially beyond their perceptual capability, highlighting that\nclosed-loop visual modification can be an effective way of decomposing the\nvisual reasoning task into solvable substeps.

A key challenge in this space is the continual need to migrate and\nmodernize codebases in response to evolving software ecosystems. Traditionally,\nsuch migrations have relied on rule-based systems and human intervention. With\nthe advent of powerful large language models (LLMs), AI-driven agentic\nframeworks offer a promising alternative-but their effectiveness has not been\nsystematically evaluated. In this paper, we introduce FreshBrew, a novel\nbenchmark for evaluating AI agents on project-level Java migrations, with a\nspecific focus on measuring an agent's ability to preserve program semantics\nand avoid reward hacking, which we argue requires projects with high test\ncoverage for a rigorous and reliable evaluation. We benchmark several\nstate-of-the-art LLMs, and compare their performance against established\nrule-based tools. Our evaluation of AI agents on this benchmark of 228\nrepositories shows that the top-performing model, Gemini 2.5 Flash, can\nsuccessfully migrate 52.3 percent of projects to JDK 17. Our empirical analysis\nreveals novel insights into the critical strengths and limitations of current\nagentic approaches, offering actionable insights into their real-world\napplicability. Our empirical study reveals failure modes of current AI agents\nin realistic Java modernization tasks, providing a foundation for evaluating\ntrustworthy code-migration systems. By releasing FreshBrew, we aim to\nfacilitate rigorous, reproducible evaluation and catalyze progress in AI-driven\ncodebase modernization.",

Existing hallucination benchmarks often operate at\nthe sequence level and are limited to English, lacking the fine-grained,\nmultilingual supervision needed for a comprehensive evaluation. In this work,\nwe introduce PsiloQA, a large-scale, multilingual dataset annotated with\nspan-level hallucinations across 14 languages. PsiloQA is constructed through\nan automated three-stage pipeline: generating question-answer pairs from\nWikipedia using GPT-4o, eliciting potentially hallucinated answers from diverse\nLLMs in a no-context setting, and automatically annotating hallucinated spans\nusing GPT-4o by comparing against golden answers and retrieved context. We\nevaluate a wide range of hallucination detection methods -- including\nuncertainty quantification, LLM-based tagging, and fine-tuned encoder models --\nand show that encoder-based models achieve the strongest performance across\nlanguages. Furthermore, PsiloQA demonstrates effective cross-lingual\ngeneralization and supports robust knowledge transfer to other benchmarks, all\nwhile being significantly more cost-efficient than human-annotated datasets.\nOur dataset and results advance the development of scalable, fine-grained\nhallucination detection in multilingual settings.",

As part of the standard\nreporting workflow, a junior radiologist typically prepares a preliminary\nreport, which is then reviewed and edited by a senior radiologist to produce\nthe final report. Identifying semantic differences between preliminary and\nfinal reports is essential for junior doctors, both as a training tool and to\nhelp uncover gaps in clinical knowledge. While AI in radiology is a rapidly\ngrowing field, the application of large language models (LLMs) remains\nchallenging due to the need for specialised domain knowledge. In this paper, we\nexplore the ability of LLMs to provide explainable and accurate comparisons of\nreports in the radiology domain. We begin by comparing the performance of\nseveral LLMs in comparing radiology reports. We then assess a more traditional\napproach based on Named-Entity-Recognition (NER). However, both approaches\nexhibit limitations in delivering accurate feedback on semantic similarity. To\naddress this, we propose Llama-EntScore, a semantic similarity scoring method\nusing a combination of Llama 3.1 and NER with tunable weights to emphasise or\nde-emphasise specific types of differences. Our approach generates a\nquantitative similarity score for tracking progress and also gives an\ninterpretation of the score that aims to offer valuable guidance in reviewing\nand refining their reporting. We find our method achieves 67% exact-match\naccuracy and 93% accuracy within +/- 1 when compared to radiologist-provided\nground truth scores - outperforming both LLMs and NER used independently.

Ensuring that GUI implementations\nfulfill NL requirements is essential for robust software engineering,\nespecially as LLM-driven programming agents become increasingly integrated into\ndevelopment workflows. Existing GUI testing approaches, whether traditional or\nLLM-driven, often fall short in handling the complexity of modern interfaces,\nand typically lack actionable feedback and effective integration with automated\ndevelopment agents. In this paper, we introduce GUISpector, a novel framework\nthat leverages a multi-modal (M)LLM-based agent for the automated verification\nof NL requirements in GUI prototypes. First, GUISpector adapts a MLLM agent to\ninterpret and operationalize NL requirements, enabling to autonomously plan and\nexecute verification trajectories across GUI applications. Second, GUISpector\nsystematically extracts detailed NL feedback from the agent's verification\nprocess, providing developers with actionable insights that can be used to\niteratively refine the GUI artifact or directly inform LLM-based code\ngeneration in a closed feedback loop. Third, we present an integrated tool that\nunifies these capabilities, offering practitioners an accessible interface for\nsupervising verification runs, inspecting agent rationales and managing the\nend-to-end requirements verification process. We evaluated GUISpector on a\ncomprehensive set of 150 requirements based on 900 acceptance criteria\nannotations across diverse GUI applications, demonstrating effective detection\nof requirement satisfaction and violations and highlighting its potential for\nseamless integration of actionable feedback into automated LLM-driven\ndevelopment workflows.

While this is a computationally efficient\nstrategy, the imposed structural constraint is rigid and can lead to a\nnoticeable model accuracy drop. In this work, we propose CoSpaDi (Compression\nvia Sparse Dictionary Learning), a novel training-free compression framework\nthat replaces low-rank decomposition with a more flexible structured sparse\nfactorization in which each weight matrix is represented with a dense\ndictionary and a column-sparse coefficient matrix. This formulation enables a\nunion-of-subspaces representation: different columns of the original weight\nmatrix are approximated in distinct subspaces spanned by adaptively selected\ndictionary atoms, offering greater expressiveness than a single invariant\nbasis. Crucially, CoSpaDi leverages a small calibration dataset to optimize the\nfactorization such that the output activations of compressed projection layers\nclosely match those of the original ones, thereby minimizing functional\nreconstruction error rather than mere weight approximation. This data-aware\nstrategy preserves better model fidelity without any fine-tuning under\nreasonable compression ratios. Moreover, the resulting structured sparsity\nallows efficient sparse-dense matrix multiplication and is compatible with\npost-training quantization for further memory and latency gains. We evaluate\nCoSpaDi across multiple Llama and Qwen models under per-layer and per-group\nsettings at 20-50\\% compression ratios, demonstrating consistent superiority\nover state-of-the-art data-aware low-rank methods both in accuracy and\nperplexity.

Despite this\npromise, the conditional independence assumption in dLLMs causes parallel\ndecoding to ignore token dependencies, inevitably degrading generation quality\nwhen these dependencies are strong. However, existing works largely overlook\nthese inherent challenges, and evaluations on standard benchmarks (e.g., math\nand coding) are not sufficient to capture the quality degradation caused by\nparallel decoding. To address this gap, we first provide an\ninformation-theoretic analysis of parallel decoding. We then conduct case\nstudies on analytically tractable synthetic list operations from both data\ndistribution and decoding strategy perspectives, offering quantitative insights\nthat highlight the fundamental limitations of parallel decoding. Building on\nthese insights, we propose ParallelBench, the first benchmark specifically\ndesigned for dLLMs, featuring realistic tasks that are trivial for humans and\nautoregressive LLMs yet exceptionally challenging for dLLMs under parallel\ndecoding. Using ParallelBench, we systematically analyze both dLLMs and\nautoregressive LLMs, revealing that: (i) dLLMs under parallel decoding can\nsuffer dramatic quality degradation in real-world scenarios, and (ii) current\nparallel decoding strategies struggle to adapt their degree of parallelism\nbased on task difficulty, thus failing to achieve meaningful speedup without\ncompromising quality. Our findings underscore the pressing need for innovative\ndecoding methods that can overcome the current speed-quality trade-off. We\nrelease our benchmark to help accelerate the development of truly efficient\ndLLMs.",

                    "value": "While most autoregressive LLMs are constrained to one-by-one decoding,\ndiffusion LLMs (dLLMs) have attracted growing interest for their potential to\ndramatically accelerate inference through parallel decoding. Despite this\npromise, the conditional independence assumption in dLLMs causes parallel\ndecoding to ignore token dependencies, inevitably degrading generation quality\nwhen these dependencies are strong. However, existing works largely overlook\nthese inherent challenges, and evaluations on standard benchmarks (e.g., math\nand coding) are not sufficient to capture the quality degradation caused by\nparallel decoding. To address this gap, we first provide an\ninformation-theoretic analysis of parallel decoding. We then conduct case\nstudies on analytically tractable synthetic list operations from both data\ndistribution and decoding strategy perspectives, offering quantitative insights\nthat highlight the fundamental limitations of parallel decoding. Building on\nthese insights, we propose ParallelBench, the first benchmark specifically\ndesigned for dLLMs, featuring realistic tasks that are trivial for humans and\nautoregressive LLMs yet exceptionally challenging for dLLMs under parallel\ndecoding. Using ParallelBench, we systematically analyze both dLLMs and\nautoregressive LLMs, revealing that: (i) dLLMs under parallel decoding can\nsuffer dramatic quality degradation in real-world scenarios, and (ii) current\nparallel decoding strategies struggle to adapt their degree of parallelism\nbased on task difficulty, thus failing to achieve meaningful speedup without\ncompromising quality. Our findings underscore the pressing need for innovative\ndecoding methods that can overcome the current speed-quality trade-off. We\nrelease our benchmark to help accelerate the development of truly efficient\ndLLMs."

However, the efficacy of RAG systems is fundamentally restricted by\nthe performance of their retrieval module, since irrelevant or semantically\nmisaligned documents directly compromise the accuracy of the final generated\nresponse. General-purpose dense retrievers can struggle with the nuanced\nlanguage of specialised domains, while the high accuracy of in-domain models is\noften achieved at prohibitive computational costs. In this work, we aim to\naddress this trade-off by developing and evaluating a two-stage retrieval\narchitecture that combines a lightweight ModernBERT bidirectional encoder for\nefficient initial candidate retrieval with a ColBERTv2 late-interaction model\nfor fine-grained re-ranking. We conduct comprehensive evaluations of our\nretriever module performance and RAG system performance in the biomedical\ncontext, fine-tuning the IR module using 10k question-passage pairs from\nPubMedQA. Our analysis of the retriever module confirmed the positive impact of\nthe ColBERT re-ranker, which improved Recall@3 by up to 4.2 percentage points\ncompared to its retrieve-only counterpart. When integrated into the biomedical\nRAG, our IR module leads to a state-of-the-art average accuracy of 0.4448 on\nthe five tasks of the MIRAGE question-answering benchmark, outperforming strong\nbaselines such as MedCPT (0.4436).

Recent research shows that large language\nmodels (LLMs) can solve various forms of analogies. However, can LLMs\ngeneralize analogy solving to new domains like people can? To investigate this,\nwe had children, adults, and LLMs solve a series of letter-string analogies\n(e.g., a b : a c :: j k : ?) in the Latin alphabet, in a near transfer domain\n(Greek alphabet), and a far transfer domain (list of symbols). Children and\nadults easily generalized their knowledge to unfamiliar domains, whereas LLMs\ndid not. This key difference between human and AI performance is evidence that\nthese LLMs still struggle with robust human-like analogical transfer.",

Recent research shows that large language\nmodels (LLMs) can solve various forms of analogies. However, can LLMs\ngeneralize analogy solving to new domains like people can? To investigate this,\nwe had children, adults, and LLMs solve a series of letter-string analogies\n(e.g., a b : a c :: j k : ?) in the Latin alphabet, in a near transfer domain\n(Greek alphabet), and a far transfer domain (list of symbols). Children and\nadults easily generalized their knowledge to unfamiliar domains, whereas LLMs\ndid not. This key difference between human and AI performance is evidence that\nthese LLMs still struggle with robust human-like analogical transfer."
