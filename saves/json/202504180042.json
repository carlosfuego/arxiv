Additionally, the Compute Time\nCalibration Function (CTCF) improves instance selection accuracy by adjusting\nfor discrepancies between theoretical and actual GPU performance. Experiments\non AWS GPU instances show that selecting lower-cost instances without KV cache\noffloading improves cost efficiency by up to 73.7% for online workloads, while\nKV cache offloading saves up to 20.19% for offline workloads.",

This paper proposes\nInferSave, a cost-efficient VM selection framework for cloud based LLM\ninference. InferSave optimizes KV cache offloading based on Service Level\nObjectives (SLOs) and workload charac teristics, estimating GPU memory needs,\nand recommending cost-effective VM instances. Additionally, the Compute Time\nCalibration Function (CTCF) improves instance selection accuracy by adjusting\nfor discrepancies between theoretical and actual GPU performance. Experiments\non AWS GPU instances show that selecting lower-cost instances without KV cache\noffloading improves cost efficiency by up to 73.7% for online workloads, while\nKV cache offloading saves up to 20.19% for offline workloads."

While\nvarious tools exist to automatically offload BLAS to GPUs, they are often\nimpractical due to the high costs associated with mandatory data transfers. The\nadvent of unified memory architectures in recent GPU designs, such as the\nNVIDIA Grace-Hopper, allows cache-coherent memory access across all types of\nmemory for both CPU and GPU, potentially eliminating the bottlenecks faced in\nconventional architectures. This breakthrough paves the way for innovative\napplication developments and porting strategies. Building on our preliminary\nwork demonstrating the potential of automatic *gemm offload, this paper extends\nthe framework to all level-3 BLAS operations and introduces SCILIB-Accel, a\nnovel tool for automatic BLAS offload. SCILIB-Accel leverages the memory\ncoherency in Grace-Hopper and introduces a Device First-Use data movement\npolicy inspired by the OpenMP First-Touch approach in multi-socket CPU\nprogramming, minimizing CPU-GPU data transfers for typical scientific computing\ncodes. Additionally, utilizing dynamic binary instrumentation, the tool\nintercepts BLAS symbols directly from a CPU binary, requiring no code\nmodifications or recompilation. SCILIB-Accel has been evaluated using multiple\nquantum physics codes on up to a few hundred GPU nodes, yielding promising\nspeedups.

On Intel\nprocessors, one of the main challenges for identifying contending addresses is\nthe sliced cache design, where the processor hashes the physical address to\ndetermine where in the cache a memory location is stored. While past works have\ndemonstrated that the hash function can be reversed, they also showed that it\ndepends on physical address bits that the adversary does not know.\n  In this work, we make three main contributions to the art of finding eviction\nsets. We first exploit microarchitectural races to compare memory access times\nand identify the cache slice to which an address maps. We then use the known\nhash function to both reduce the error rate in our slice identification method\nand to reduce the work by extrapolating slice mappings to untested memory\naddresses. Finally, we show how to propagate information on eviction sets\nacross different page offsets for the hitherto unexplored case of non-linear\nhash functions.\n  Our contributions allow for entire LLC eviction set generation in 0.7 seconds\non the Intel i7-9850H and 1.6 seconds on the i9-10900K, both using non-linear\nfunctions. This represents a significant improvement compared to\nstate-of-the-art techniques taking 9x and 10x longer, respectively.",

To raise awareness of this problem, we study an interaction between\ntwo state-of-the art defenses in this paper, timing obfuscations of remote\ncache lines (TORC) and delaying speculative changes to remote cache lines\n(DSRC). TORC mitigates cache-hit based attacks and DSRC mitigates speculative\ncoherence state change attacks.\n  We observe that DSRC enables coherence information to be retrieved into the\nprocessor core, where it is out of the reach of timing obfuscations to protect.\nThis creates an unforeseen consequence that redo operations can be triggered\nwithin the core to detect the presence or absence of remote cache lines, which\nconstitutes a security vulnerability. We demonstrate that a new covert channel\nattack is possible using this vulnerability. We propose two ways to mitigate\nthe attack, whose performance varies depending on an application's cache usage.\nOne way is to never send remote exclusive coherence state (E) information to\nthe core even if it is created. The other way is to never create a remote E\nstate, which is responsible for triggering redos.\n  We demonstrate the timing difference caused by this microarchitectural\ndefense assumption violation using GEM5 simulations.

While traditional content\nrecommendations are oblivious to network conditions, the paradigm of\nNetwork-Friendly Recommendations (NFR) has recently emerged, favoring content\nthat improves network performance (e.g. cached near the user), while still\nbeing appealing to the user.

We\nthen formulate a ``Diverse-NFR'' optimization problem (i.e., network-friendly\nrecommendations with - sufficient - content diversity), and through a series of\ntransformation steps, we manage to reduce it to a linear program that can be\nsolved fast and optimally. Our findings show that Diverse-NFR can achieve high\nnetwork gains (comparable to non-diverse NFR) while maintaining diversity\nconstraints.

                "summary": "Recent breakthroughs in large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled various\ngenerative tasks on a single model. Real-world services (e.g., OpenAI's ChatGPT\n[27]) powered by an LLM often concurrently support latency-critical requests\nfor interactive applications (e.g., question-answering systems, referred to as\nreal-time or RT requests) and throughput-oriented requests for back-of-house\nprocessing (e.g., documents batch processing [28], referred to best-effort or\nBE requests), with complex hybrid inference workloads to the underlying model.\nState-of-the-art (SOTA) LLM serving systems dedicate machines to each type of\nrequest, towards either low inference latency or high serving throughput,\nrespectively.

Furthermore, we introduce a method called Causal Cache,\nwhich maintains the integrity of latent space during block-wise inference.\nCompared to state-of-the-art video VAEs, WF-VAE demonstrates superior\nperformance in both PSNR and LPIPS metrics, achieving 2x higher throughput and\n4x lower memory consumption while maintaining competitive reconstruction\nquality. Our code and models are available at\nhttps://github.com/PKU-YuanGroup/WF-VAE."

Yet, the unique properties of these models complicate the usage of\ncomplementary efficiency optimizations such as prefix caching that skip\nredundant computations across requests. Most notably, their use of in-place\nstate updates for recurrent layers precludes rolling back cache entries for\npartial sequence overlaps, and instead mandates only exact-match cache hits;\nthe effect is a deluge of (large) cache entries per sequence, most of which\nyield minimal reuse opportunities. We present Marconi, the first system that\nsupports efficient prefix caching with Hybrid LLMs. Key to Marconi are its\nnovel admission and eviction policies that more judiciously assess potential\ncache entries based not only on recency, but also on (1) forecasts of their\nreuse likelihood across a taxonomy of different hit scenarios, and (2) the\ncompute savings that hits deliver relative to memory footprints. Across diverse\nworkloads and Hybrid models, Marconi achieves up to 34.4$\\times$ higher token\nhit rates (71.1% or 617 ms lower TTFT) compared to state-of-the-art prefix\ncaching systems.",

                    "value": "Hybrid models that combine the language modeling capabilities of Attention\nlayers with the efficiency of Recurrent layers (e.g., State Space Models) have\ngained traction in practically supporting long contexts in Large Language Model\nserving. Yet, the unique properties of these models complicate the usage of\ncomplementary efficiency optimizations such as prefix caching that skip\nredundant computations across requests. Most notably, their use of in-place\nstate updates for recurrent layers precludes rolling back cache entries for\npartial sequence overlaps, and instead mandates only exact-match cache hits;\nthe effect is a deluge of (large) cache entries per sequence, most of which\nyield minimal reuse opportunities. We present Marconi, the first system that\nsupports efficient prefix caching with Hybrid LLMs. Key to Marconi are its\nnovel admission and eviction policies that more judiciously assess potential\ncache entries based not only on recency, but also on (1) forecasts of their\nreuse likelihood across a taxonomy of different hit scenarios, and (2) the\ncompute savings that hits deliver relative to memory footprints. Across diverse\nworkloads and Hybrid models, Marconi achieves up to 34.4$\\times$ higher token\nhit rates (71.1% or 617 ms lower TTFT) compared to state-of-the-art prefix\ncaching systems."

Therefore, data\nthroughput specifications play a key role in modeling application performance\nand determining possible bottlenecks. However, while peak instruction\nthroughputs and bandwidths for local caches are often documented, the\nachievable throughput can also depend on the relation between memory access and\ncompute instructions. In this paper, we present an Arm version of the well\nestablished x86-membench throughput benchmark, which we have adapted to support\nall current SIMD extensions of the Armv8 instruction set architecture. We\ndescribe aspects of the Armv8 ISA that need to be considered in the portable\ndesign of this benchmark. We use the benchmark to analyze the memory subsystem\nat a fine spatial granularity and to unveil microarchitectural details of three\nprocessors: Fujitsu A64FX, Ampere Altra and Cavium ThunderX2. Based on the\nresulting performance information, we show that instruction fetch and decoder\nwidths become a potential bottleneck for cache-bandwidth-sensitive workloads\ndue to the load-store concept of the Arm ISA.",

                    "value": "Application performance of modern day processors is often limited by the\nmemory subsystem rather than actual compute capabilities. Therefore, data\nthroughput specifications play a key role in modeling application performance\nand determining possible bottlenecks. However, while peak instruction\nthroughputs and bandwidths for local caches are often documented, the\nachievable throughput can also depend on the relation between memory access and\ncompute instructions. In this paper, we present an Arm version of the well\nestablished x86-membench throughput benchmark, which we have adapted to support\nall current SIMD extensions of the Armv8 instruction set architecture. We\ndescribe aspects of the Armv8 ISA that need to be considered in the portable\ndesign of this benchmark. We use the benchmark to analyze the memory subsystem\nat a fine spatial granularity and to unveil microarchitectural details of three\nprocessors: Fujitsu A64FX, Ampere Altra and Cavium ThunderX2. Based on the\nresulting performance information, we show that instruction fetch and decoder\nwidths become a potential bottleneck for cache-bandwidth-sensitive workloads\ndue to the load-store concept of the Arm ISA."

By reformulating the selection process with tensorized data\nstructures and an optimized caching strategy, our approach effectively\neliminates computational bottlenecks inherent in traditional CPU-based and\nna\\\"ive GPU implementations. Experimental results on widely used numerical\nbenchmarks show that TensorNSGA-III achieves speedups of up to $3629\\times$\nover the CPU version of NSGA-III. Additionally, we validate its effectiveness\nin multiobjective robotic control tasks, where it discovers diverse and\nhigh-quality behavioral solutions. Furthermore, we investigate the critical\nrole of large population sizes in many-objective optimization and demonstrate\nthe scalability of TensorNSGA-III in such scenarios.

However, the large MoE model size still introduces\nsubstantial memory demands, which usually requires expert offloading on\nresource-constrained platforms and incurs significant overhead. Hybrid CPU-GPU\ninference has been proposed to leverage CPU computation to reduce expert\nloading overhead but faces major challenges: on one hand, the expert activation\npatterns of MoE models are highly unstable, rendering the fixed mapping\nstrategies in existing works inefficient; on the other hand, the hybrid CPU-GPU\nschedule for MoE is inherently complex due to the diverse expert sizes,\nstructures, uneven workload distribution, etc. To address these challenges, in\nthis paper, we propose HybriMoE, a hybrid CPU-GPU inference framework that\nimproves resource utilization through a novel CPU-GPU scheduling and cache\nmanagement system. HybriMoE introduces (i) a dynamic intra-layer scheduling\nstrategy to balance workloads across CPU and GPU, (ii) an impact-driven\ninter-layer prefetching algorithm, and (iii) a score-based caching algorithm to\nmitigate expert activation instability.

                "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly utilized for complex tasks\nrequiring longer context lengths, with some models supporting up to 128K or 1M\ntokens. This trend, however, presents significant challenges in inference speed\nand memory management. Quantization emerges as a promising approach to address\nthe widening gap between LLM size and memory capacity. However, traditional\nquantization schemes often yield suboptimal compression results for KV caches\ndue to two key factors: i) On-the-fly quantization and de-quantization, causing\nsignificant performance overhead; ii) Prevalence of outliers in KV values,\nchallenging low-bitwidth uniform quantization. To this end, we propose MILLION,\na novel quantization framework achieving low-bitwidth KV cache through product\nquantization. First, we conduct a thorough analysis of KV cache distribution,\nrevealing the limitations of existing quantization schemes. Second, we\nintroduce a non-uniform quantization algorithm based on product quantization,\nwhich efficiently compresses data while preserving accuracy. Third, we develop\na high-performance GPU inference framework with efficient attention kernel and\npipeline design for MILLION that leverages sparse computation and asynchronous\nquantization, significantly enhancing inference speed. Comprehensive evaluation\nresults demonstrate that MILLION can achieve 4 bits quantization with trivial\nperplexity and accuracy loss, and achieve 2.09x end-to-end performance gains at\n32K context length.

To address this challenge, we\npropose FastVAR, a post-training acceleration method for efficient resolution\nscaling with VARs. Our key finding is that the majority of latency arises from\nthe large-scale step where most tokens have already converged. Leveraging this\nobservation, we develop the cached token pruning strategy that only forwards\npivotal tokens for scale-specific modeling while using cached tokens from\nprevious scale steps to restore the pruned slots. This significantly reduces\nthe number of forwarded tokens and improves the efficiency at larger\nresolutions. Experiments show the proposed FastVAR can further speedup\nFlashAttention-accelerated VAR by 2.7$\\times$ with negligible performance drop\nof <1%. We further extend FastVAR to zero-shot generation of higher resolution\nimages. In particular, FastVAR can generate one 2K image with 15GB memory\nfootprints in 1.5s on a single NVIDIA 3090 GPU.

To speed up the prefill of the long\nLLM inputs, one can pre-compute the KV cache of a text and re-use the KV cache\nwhen the context is reused as the prefix of another LLM input. However, the\nreused text chunks are not always the input prefix, which makes precomputed KV\ncaches not directly usable since they ignore the text's cross-attention with\nthe preceding texts. Thus, the benefits of reusing KV caches remain largely\nunrealized.\n  This paper tackles just one challenge: when an LLM input contains multiple\ntext chunks, how to quickly combine their precomputed KV caches in order to\nachieve the same generation quality as the expensive full prefill (i.e.,\nwithout reusing KV cache)? This challenge naturally arises in\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG) where the input is supplemented with\nmultiple retrieved texts as the context. We present CacheBlend, a scheme that\nreuses the precomputed KV caches, regardless prefix or not, and selectively\nrecomputes the KV values of a small subset of tokens to partially update each\nreused KV cache. In the meantime, the small extra delay for recomputing some\ntokens can be pipelined with the retrieval of KV caches within the same job,\nallowing CacheBlend to store KV caches in slower devices with more storage\ncapacity while retrieving them without increasing the inference delay. By\ncomparing CacheBlend with the state-of-the-art KV cache reusing schemes on\nthree open-source LLMs of various sizes and four popular benchmark datasets of\ndifferent tasks, we show that CacheBlend reduces time-to-first-token (TTFT) by\n2.2-3.3x and increases the inference throughput by 2.8-5x from full KV\nrecompute without compromising generation quality.

                "summary": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for\nenhancing the performance of large language models (LLMs) by integrating\nexternal knowledge into the generation process. A key component of RAG\npipelines is the reranker, which selects the most relevant documents from a\npool of retrieved candidates and significantly improves the quality of the\ngenerated responses. While rerankers refine the selection of retrieved\ndocuments in RAG pipelines, they introduce computational challenges that hinder\nhigh throughput and low latency. To address this problem, we propose HyperRAG,\na system that optimizes the trade-off between quality and efficiency in RAG\npipelines by leveraging KV-cache reuse for efficient reranker inference. By\nreusing document-side KV-cache, HyperRAG achieves both high-quality generation\nand system-level efficiency.

                    "value": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for\nenhancing the performance of large language models (LLMs) by integrating\nexternal knowledge into the generation process. A key component of RAG\npipelines is the reranker, which selects the most relevant documents from a\npool of retrieved candidates and significantly improves the quality of the\ngenerated responses. While rerankers refine the selection of retrieved\ndocuments in RAG pipelines, they introduce computational challenges that hinder\nhigh throughput and low latency. To address this problem, we propose HyperRAG,\na system that optimizes the trade-off between quality and efficiency in RAG\npipelines by leveraging KV-cache reuse for efficient reranker inference. By\nreusing document-side KV-cache, HyperRAG achieves both high-quality generation\nand system-level efficiency.

Additionally, existing frameworks often fix the roles of P and D nodes,\nleading to computational imbalances. In this paper, we propose FlowKV, a novel\ndisaggregated inference framework, which reduces the average transmission\nlatency of KV cache by 96%, from 0.944s to 0.053s, almost eliminating the\ntransfer time relative to the total request latency by optimizing the KV cache\ntransfer. FlowKV introduces the Load-Aware Scheduler for balanced request\nscheduling and flexible PD node allocation. This design maximizes hardware\nresource utilization, achieving peak system throughput across various\nscenarios, including normal, computational imbalance, and extreme overload\nconditions. Experimental results demonstrate that FlowKV significantly\naccelerates inference by 15.2%-48.9% on LongBench dataset compared to the\nbaseline and supports applications with heterogeneous GPUs.",

By pre-executing the application code during occurrences of\nlong-latency operations and prefetching anticipated cache-missed data into the\ncache hierarchy, runahead effectively masks memory latency for subsequent cache\nmisses and achieves high prefetching accuracy; however, this technique has been\nlimited to superscalar out-of-order and superscalar in-order cores. For\nimplementation in scalar in-order cores, the challenges of\narea-/energy-constraint and severe cache contention remain.\n  Here, we build the first full-stack system featuring runahead, MERE, from SoC\nand a dedicated ISA to the OS and programming model. Through this deployment,\nwe show that enabling runahead in scalar in-order cores is possible, with\nminimal area and power overheads, while still achieving high performance. By\nre-constructing the sequential runahead employing a hardware/software co-design\napproach, the system can be implemented on a mature processor and SoC. Building\non this, an adaptive runahead mechanism is proposed to mitigate the severe\ncache contention in scalar in-order cores. Combining this, we provide a\ncomprehensive solution for embedded processors managing irregular workloads.\nOur evaluation demonstrates that the proposed MERE attains 93.5% of a 2-wide\nout-of-order core's performance while constraining area and power overheads\nbelow 5%, with the adaptive runahead mechanism delivering an additional 20.1%\nperformance gain through mitigating the severe cache contention issues.",

By pre-executing the application code during occurrences of\nlong-latency operations and prefetching anticipated cache-missed data into the\ncache hierarchy, runahead effectively masks memory latency for subsequent cache\nmisses and achieves high prefetching accuracy; however, this technique has been\nlimited to superscalar out-of-order and superscalar in-order cores. For\nimplementation in scalar in-order cores, the challenges of\narea-/energy-constraint and severe cache contention remain.\n  Here, we build the first full-stack system featuring runahead, MERE, from SoC\nand a dedicated ISA to the OS and programming model. Through this deployment,\nwe show that enabling runahead in scalar in-order cores is possible, with\nminimal area and power overheads, while still achieving high performance. By\nre-constructing the sequential runahead employing a hardware/software co-design\napproach, the system can be implemented on a mature processor and SoC. Building\non this, an adaptive runahead mechanism is proposed to mitigate the severe\ncache contention in scalar in-order cores. Combining this, we provide a\ncomprehensive solution for embedded processors managing irregular workloads.\nOur evaluation demonstrates that the proposed MERE attains 93.5% of a 2-wide\nout-of-order core's performance while constraining area and power overheads\nbelow 5%, with the adaptive runahead mechanism delivering an additional 20.1%\nperformance gain through mitigating the severe cache contention issues."

This\npaper focuses on cache management for applications where data objects can be\nstored in layered representations. In such representations, each additional\ndata layer enhances the \"quality\" of the object's version but comes with an\nincremental cost of memory space. This layered approach proves beneficial in\nvarious scenarios, including the delivery of zoomable maps, video coding,\nfuture Virtual Reality gaming, and layered neural network models where\nadditional data layers improve inference accuracy. In systems where users or\ndevices demand different versions of a data object, layered representations\noffer flexibility for caching policies to achieve improved hit rates.\n  In this paper, we explore the performance of various traditionally studied\ncaching policies, such as Belady, LRU, and LFU, both with and without layering.\nTo this end, we develop an asymptotically accurate analytical model for Layered\nLRU (LLRU). We study how the performance of LLRU is impacted by factors such as\nthe number of layers, the popularity of different objects and layers, and\noverheads associated with storing layered representations. For instance, we\nshow that, for LLRU, more layers are not always beneficial and indeed\nperformance depends in subtle ways on the popularity and size profiles of\nlayers.",

                    "value": "The effective management of large amounts of data processed or required by\ntoday's cloud or edge computing systems remains a fundamental challenge. This\npaper focuses on cache management for applications where data objects can be\nstored in layered representations. In such representations, each additional\ndata layer enhances the \"quality\" of the object's version but comes with an\nincremental cost of memory space. This layered approach proves beneficial in\nvarious scenarios, including the delivery of zoomable maps, video coding,\nfuture Virtual Reality gaming, and layered neural network models where\nadditional data layers improve inference accuracy. In systems where users or\ndevices demand different versions of a data object, layered representations\noffer flexibility for caching policies to achieve improved hit rates.\n  In this paper, we explore the performance of various traditionally studied\ncaching policies, such as Belady, LRU, and LFU, both with and without layering.\nTo this end, we develop an asymptotically accurate analytical model for Layered\nLRU (LLRU). We study how the performance of LLRU is impacted by factors such as\nthe number of layers, the popularity of different objects and layers, and\noverheads associated with storing layered representations. For instance, we\nshow that, for LLRU, more layers are not always beneficial and indeed\nperformance depends in subtle ways on the popularity and size profiles of\nlayers."

Evaluations on a real-world prototype show that EMO improves\naccuracy by up to 17.77% compared to FL, and reduces communication costs by up\nto 7.17x and decreases training time by up to 6.9x compared to SFL."

In contrast to 3D-Var,\nour theory exploits the non-locality of super-resolution (SR) to learn\nbackground covariances without explicitly imposing them for assimilating\ndistant observations. For linear SR, SR operators serve as background error\ncovariance matrices,whereas for nonlinear SR, error backpropagation through SR\nneural networks induces covariance structures in inference.

In this paper, we explore how far an LLM can improve its\nreasoning by self-synthesizing reasoning paths as training data without any\nadditional supervision. Existing self-synthesizing methods, such as STaR,\nsuffer from poor generalization to out-of-domain (OOD) reasoning tasks.

To address\nthis, we propose Reasoning Generalist via Self-Improvement (ReGenesis), a\nmethod to self-synthesize reasoning paths as post-training data by progressing\nfrom abstract to concrete. More specifically, ReGenesis self-synthesizes\nreasoning paths by converting general reasoning guidelines into task-specific\nones, generating reasoning structures, and subsequently transforming these\nstructures into reasoning paths, without the need for human-designed\ntask-specific examples used in existing methods. We show that ReGenesis\nachieves superior performance on all in-domain and OOD settings tested compared\nto existing methods. For six OOD tasks specifically, while previous methods\nexhibited an average performance decrease of approximately 4.6% after post\ntraining, ReGenesis delivers around 6.1% performance improvement.

The results presented here extend previous\nresults obtained in Wang and Boukai (2024) who study the single side effect\ncase to the case of two (or more) side effects. While the sequential procedure\nwe employ, simultaneously monitors several of the treatment's side effects, the\n$(\\alpha, \\beta)$-optimal test we propose does not require any information\nabout the inter-correlation between these potential side effects. However, in\nall of the subsequent analyses, including the derivations of the exact\nexpressions of the Average Sample Number (ASN), the Power function, and the\nproperties of the post-test (or post-detection) estimators, we accounted\nspecifically, for the correlation between the potential side effects. In the\nreal-life application (such as post-marketing surveillance), the number of\navailable observations is large enough to justify asymptotic analyses of the\nsequential procedure (testing and post-detection estimation) properties.\nAccordingly, we also derive the consistency and asymptotic normality of our\npost-test estimators; results which enable us to also provide (asymptotic,\npost-detection) confidence intervals for the probabilities of various\nside-effects. Moreover, to compare two specific side effects, their relative\nrisk plays an important role. We derive the distribution of the estimated\nrelative risk in the asymptotic framework to provide appropriate inference. To\nillustrate the theoretical results presented, we provide two detailed examples\nbased on the data of side effects on COVID-19 vaccine collected in Nigeria (see\nNigeria (see Ilori et al.

Simulations of PBH\nformation have been essential for inferring the initial conditions that lead to\nblack hole formation and for studying their properties and impact on our\nUniverse. The Misner-Sharp formalism is commonly used as a standard approach\nfor these simulations. Recently, type-II fluctuations, characterized by a\nnon-monotonic areal radius, have gained interest. In the standard Misner-Sharp\napproach for simulating PBH formation with these fluctuations, the evolution\nequations exhibit divergent terms ($0/0$), which complicate and prevent the\nsimulations. We formulate a new approach to overcome this issue in a simple\nmanner by using the trace of the extrinsic curvature as an auxiliary variable,\nallowing simulations of type-II fluctuations within the Misner-Sharp formalism.\nUsing a set of standard exponential-shaped curvature profiles, we apply our new\napproach and numerical code based on pseudospectral methods to study the time\nevolution of the gravitational collapse, threshold values of type A/B PBHs and\nPBH mass. Interestingly, we identify cases of type-II fluctuations that do not\nnecessarily result in PBH formation.",

Simulations of PBH\nformation have been essential for inferring the initial conditions that lead to\nblack hole formation and for studying their properties and impact on our\nUniverse. The Misner-Sharp formalism is commonly used as a standard approach\nfor these simulations. Recently, type-II fluctuations, characterized by a\nnon-monotonic areal radius, have gained interest. In the standard Misner-Sharp\napproach for simulating PBH formation with these fluctuations, the evolution\nequations exhibit divergent terms ($0/0$), which complicate and prevent the\nsimulations. We formulate a new approach to overcome this issue in a simple\nmanner by using the trace of the extrinsic curvature as an auxiliary variable,\nallowing simulations of type-II fluctuations within the Misner-Sharp formalism.\nUsing a set of standard exponential-shaped curvature profiles, we apply our new\napproach and numerical code based on pseudospectral methods to study the time\nevolution of the gravitational collapse, threshold values of type A/B PBHs and\nPBH mass. Interestingly, we identify cases of type-II fluctuations that do not\nnecessarily result in PBH formation."

We perform thermochemical equilibrium\ncalculations to infer conditions of quenching of C-H-O-N species. Our results\nindicate apparent CO$_2$-CH$_4$ equilibrium between ~900 and ~1100 K. The CO\nabundance should be quenched higher in the atmosphere where the equilibrium\nCO/CO$_2$ ratio is lower, potentially explaining a lack of CO.

We confirm that the atmosphere of\nTOI-270 d is strongly enriched in both C and O$_g$$_a$$_s$ relative to\nprotosolar H, whereas N is likely to be less enriched or even depleted. We\nattempt to reproduce these enrichments by modeling the atmosphere as nebular\ngas that extracted heavy elements from accreted solids. This type of model can\nexplain the C/H and O$_g$$_a$$_s$/H ratios, but despite supersolar C/N ratios\nprovided by solids, the NH$_3$ abundance will probably be too high unless there\nis a nitrogen sink in addition to N$_2$.

Our findings highlight\nembedding space attacks as an important threat model in open-source LLMs.\nTrigger Warning: the appendix contains LLM-generated text with violence and\nharassment."

Recent work on long Chain-of-Thought reasoning\nhas demonstrated great potential of LLMs on solving competitive problems, but\ntheir verification ability remains to be weak and not sufficiently\ninvestigated. In this paper, we propose Heimdall, the long CoT verification LLM\nthat can accurately judge the correctness of solutions. With pure reinforcement\nlearning, we boost the verification accuracy from 62.5% to 94.5% on competitive\nmath problems. By scaling with repeated sampling, the accuracy further\nincreases to 97.5%. Through human evaluation, Heimdall demonstrates impressive\ngeneralization capabilities, successfully detecting most issues in challenging\nmath proofs, the type of which is not included during training. Furthermore, we\npropose Pessimistic Verification to extend the functionality of Heimdall to\nscaling up the problem solving. It calls Heimdall to judge the solutions from a\nsolver model and based on the pessimistic principle, selects the most likely\ncorrect solution with the least uncertainty. Taking\nDeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B as the solver model, Pessimistic Verification\nimproves the solution accuracy on AIME2025 from 54.2% to 70.0% with 16x compute\nbudget and to 83.3% with more compute budget. With the stronger solver Gemini\n2.5 Pro, the score reaches 93.0%. Finally, we prototype an automatic knowledge\ndiscovery system, a ternary system where one poses questions, another provides\nsolutions, and the third verifies the solutions.

We specifically focus on the magneto-rotational properties of Galactic\nisolated neutron stars and provide new insights into the intrinsic radio\nluminosity law by combining pulsar population synthesis with a simulation-based\ninference (SBI) technique called truncated sequential neural posterior\nestimation (TSNPE). We employ TSNPE to train a neural density estimator on\nsimulated pulsar populations to approximate the posterior distribution of the\nunderlying parameters. This technique efficiently explores the parameter space\nby concentrating on regions that are most likely to match the observed data\nthus allowing a significant reduction in training dataset size. We demonstrate\nthe efficiency of TSNPE over standard neural posterior estimation (NPE),\nachieving robust inferences of magneto-rotational parameters consistent with\nprevious studies using only around 4% of the simulations required by NPE\napproaches. Moreover, for the first time, we incorporate data from the Thousand\nPulsar Array (TPA) program on MeerKAT, the largest unified sample of neutron\nstars with consistent fluxes measurement to date, to help constrain the stars'\nintrinsic radio luminosity. We find that adding flux information as an input to\nthe neural network largely improves the constraints on the pulsars' radio\nluminosity, as well as improving the estimates on other input parameters.",

In this work, we\npropose the Task Memory Engine (TME), a lightweight and structured memory\nmodule that tracks task execution using a hierarchical Task Memory Tree (TMT).\nEach node in the tree corresponds to a task step, storing relevant input,\noutput, status, and sub-task relationships. We introduce a prompt synthesis\nmethod that dynamically generates LLM prompts based on the active node path,\nsignificantly improving execution consistency and contextual grounding. Through\ncase studies and comparative experiments on multi-step agent tasks, we\ndemonstrate that TME leads to better task completion accuracy and more\ninterpretable behavior with minimal implementation overhead. A reference\nimplementation of the core TME components is available at\nhttps://github.com/biubiutomato/TME-Agent, including basic examples and\nstructured memory integration. While the current implementation uses a\ntree-based structure, TME is designed to be graph-aware, supporting reusable\nsubsteps, converging task paths, and shared dependencies.

In this work, we combine 3D human pose and\nshape estimation with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), a representation of the\nscene composed of a mixture of Gaussians. This allows training or fine-tuning a\nhuman model predictor on multi-view images alone, without 3D ground truth.\nPredicting such mixtures for a human from a single input image is challenging\ndue to self-occlusions and dependence on articulations, while also needing to\nretain enough flexibility to accommodate a variety of clothes and poses. Our\nkey observation is that the vertices of standardized human meshes (such as\nSMPL) can provide an adequate spatial density and approximate initial position\nfor the Gaussians. We can then train a transformer model to jointly predict\ncomparatively small adjustments to these positions, as well as the other 3DGS\nattributes and the SMPL parameters. We show empirically that this combination\n(using only multi-view supervision) can achieve near real-time inference of 3D\nhuman models from a single image without expensive diffusion models or 3D\npoints supervision, thus making it ideal for the sport industry at any level.\nMore importantly, rendering is an effective auxiliary objective to refine 3D\npose estimation by accounting for clothes and other geometric variations.

                "summary": "Text-to-Video generation, which utilizes the provided text prompt to generate\nhigh-quality videos, has drawn increasing attention and achieved great success\ndue to the development of diffusion models recently. Existing methods mainly\nrely on a pre-trained text encoder to capture the semantic information and\nperform cross attention with the encoded text prompt to guide the generation of\nvideo. However, when it comes to complex prompts that contain dynamic scenes\nand multiple camera-view transformations, these methods can not decompose the\noverall information into separate scenes, as well as fail to smoothly change\nscenes based on the corresponding camera-views. To solve these problems, we\npropose a novel method, i.e., Modular-Cam. Specifically, to better understand a\ngiven complex prompt, we utilize a large language model to analyze user\ninstructions and decouple them into multiple scenes together with transition\nactions. To generate a video containing dynamic scenes that match the given\ncamera-views, we incorporate the widely-used temporal transformer into the\ndiffusion model to ensure continuity within a single scene and propose\nCamOperator, a modular network based module that well controls the camera\nmovements. Moreover, we propose AdaControlNet, which utilizes ControlNet to\nensure consistency across scenes and adaptively adjusts the color tone of the\ngenerated video. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments prove our\nproposed Modular-Cam's strong capability of generating multi-scene videos\ntogether with its ability to achieve fine-grained control of camera movements.\nGenerated results are available at https://modular-cam.github.io.",

                    "value": "Text-to-Video generation, which utilizes the provided text prompt to generate\nhigh-quality videos, has drawn increasing attention and achieved great success\ndue to the development of diffusion models recently. Existing methods mainly\nrely on a pre-trained text encoder to capture the semantic information and\nperform cross attention with the encoded text prompt to guide the generation of\nvideo. However, when it comes to complex prompts that contain dynamic scenes\nand multiple camera-view transformations, these methods can not decompose the\noverall information into separate scenes, as well as fail to smoothly change\nscenes based on the corresponding camera-views. To solve these problems, we\npropose a novel method, i.e., Modular-Cam. Specifically, to better understand a\ngiven complex prompt, we utilize a large language model to analyze user\ninstructions and decouple them into multiple scenes together with transition\nactions. To generate a video containing dynamic scenes that match the given\ncamera-views, we incorporate the widely-used temporal transformer into the\ndiffusion model to ensure continuity within a single scene and propose\nCamOperator, a modular network based module that well controls the camera\nmovements. Moreover, we propose AdaControlNet, which utilizes ControlNet to\nensure consistency across scenes and adaptively adjusts the color tone of the\ngenerated video. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments prove our\nproposed Modular-Cam's strong capability of generating multi-scene videos\ntogether with its ability to achieve fine-grained control of camera movements.\nGenerated results are available at https://modular-cam.github.io."

The results demonstrate a significant increase in\nreconstruction accuracy, particularly in heterogeneous client datasets, a\ncommon scenario in FL. The efficacy of our model-based AIAs makes them better\ncandidates for empirically quantifying privacy leakage for federated regression\ntasks."

However, in creative or\nexploratory contexts, these \"mistakes\" may represent unexpected avenues for\ninnovation. We introduce Purposefully Induced Psychosis (PIP), a novel approach\nthat amplifies LLM hallucinations for imaginative tasks such as speculative\nfiction, interactive storytelling, and mixed-reality simulations. Drawing on\nHerman Melville's Moby-Dick, where Pip's \"madness\" reveals profound insight, we\nreframe hallucinations as a source of computational imagination rather than a\nflaw. Our method fine-tunes LLMs to encourage speculative, metaphorical, and\nsurreal outputs - hallucinations that are useful when factual accuracy is not\nthe chief objective. Inspired by the consensual illusions of theater and stage\nmagic, PIP situates these creative missteps in contexts where users willingly\nsuspend disbelief, thereby transforming \"errors\" into catalysts for new ways of\nthinking.

However, in creative or\nexploratory contexts, these \"mistakes\" may represent unexpected avenues for\ninnovation. We introduce Purposefully Induced Psychosis (PIP), a novel approach\nthat amplifies LLM hallucinations for imaginative tasks such as speculative\nfiction, interactive storytelling, and mixed-reality simulations. Drawing on\nHerman Melville's Moby-Dick, where Pip's \"madness\" reveals profound insight, we\nreframe hallucinations as a source of computational imagination rather than a\nflaw. Our method fine-tunes LLMs to encourage speculative, metaphorical, and\nsurreal outputs - hallucinations that are useful when factual accuracy is not\nthe chief objective. Inspired by the consensual illusions of theater and stage\nmagic, PIP situates these creative missteps in contexts where users willingly\nsuspend disbelief, thereby transforming \"errors\" into catalysts for new ways of\nthinking. We discuss potential applications, design principles for ensuring\nuser consent, preliminary observations, and implications for broader AI ethics\nand human-AI collaboration."

In this paper, we reassess the performance\nof QA models using LLM-as-a-judge across four reading comprehension QA\ndatasets. We examine different families of LLMs and various answer types to\nevaluate the effectiveness of LLM-as-a-judge in these tasks. Our results show\nthat LLM-as-a-judge is highly correlated with human judgments and can replace\ntraditional EM/F1 metrics. By using LLM-as-a-judge, the correlation with human\njudgments improves significantly, from 0.17 (EM) and 0.36 (F1-score) to 0.85.\nThese findings confirm that EM and F1 metrics underestimate the true\nperformance of the QA models. While LLM-as-a-judge is not perfect for more\ndifficult answer types (e.g., job), it still outperforms EM/F1, and we observe\nno bias issues, such as self-preference, when the same model is used for both\nthe QA and judgment tasks.",

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly\napplied to time series tasks, leveraging their strong language capabilities to\nenhance various applications. However, research on multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) for\ntime series understanding and reasoning remains limited, primarily due to the\nscarcity of high-quality datasets that align time series with textual\ninformation. This paper introduces ChatTS, a novel MLLM designed for time\nseries analysis. ChatTS treats time series as a modality, similar to how vision\nMLLMs process images, enabling it to perform both understanding and reasoning\nwith time series. To address the scarcity of training data, we propose an\nattribute-based method for generating synthetic time series with detailed\nattribute descriptions. We further introduce Time Series Evol-Instruct, a novel\napproach that generates diverse time series Q&As, enhancing the model's\nreasoning capabilities. To the best of our knowledge, ChatTS is the first\nTS-MLLM that takes multivariate time series as input for understanding and\nreasoning, which is fine-tuned exclusively on synthetic datasets. We evaluate\nits performance using benchmark datasets with real-world data, including six\nalignment tasks and four reasoning tasks. Our results show that ChatTS\nsignificantly outperforms existing vision-based MLLMs (e.g., GPT-4o) and\ntext/agent-based LLMs, achieving a 46.0% improvement in alignment tasks and a\n25.8% improvement in reasoning tasks.

While prompt engineering has proven effective, it typically relies on\nmanual adjustments, making it time-consuming and potentially suboptimal. This\npaper introduces GAAPO (Genetic Algorithm Applied to Prompt Optimization), a\nnovel hybrid optimization framework that leverages genetic algorithm principles\nto evolve prompts through successive generations. Unlike traditional genetic\napproaches that rely solely on mutation and crossover operations, GAAPO\nintegrates multiple specialized prompt generation strategies within its\nevolutionary framework. Through extensive experimentation on diverse datasets\nincluding ETHOS, MMLU-Pro, and GPQA, our analysis reveals several important\npoint for the future development of automatic prompt optimization methods:\nimportance of the tradeoff between the population size and the number of\ngenerations, effect of selection methods on stability results, capacity of\ndifferent LLMs and especially reasoning models to be able to automatically\ngenerate prompts from similar queries... Furthermore, we provide insights into\nthe relative effectiveness of different prompt generation strategies and their\nevolution across optimization phases. These findings contribute to both the\ntheoretical understanding of prompt optimization and practical applications in\nimproving LLM performance.",

While prompt engineering has proven effective, it typically relies on\nmanual adjustments, making it time-consuming and potentially suboptimal. This\npaper introduces GAAPO (Genetic Algorithm Applied to Prompt Optimization), a\nnovel hybrid optimization framework that leverages genetic algorithm principles\nto evolve prompts through successive generations. Unlike traditional genetic\napproaches that rely solely on mutation and crossover operations, GAAPO\nintegrates multiple specialized prompt generation strategies within its\nevolutionary framework. Through extensive experimentation on diverse datasets\nincluding ETHOS, MMLU-Pro, and GPQA, our analysis reveals several important\npoint for the future development of automatic prompt optimization methods:\nimportance of the tradeoff between the population size and the number of\ngenerations, effect of selection methods on stability results, capacity of\ndifferent LLMs and especially reasoning models to be able to automatically\ngenerate prompts from similar queries... Furthermore, we provide insights into\nthe relative effectiveness of different prompt generation strategies and their\nevolution across optimization phases. These findings contribute to both the\ntheoretical understanding of prompt optimization and practical applications in\nimproving LLM performance."

Engaging deeply with\nstories and spotting plot holes -- inconsistencies in a storyline that break\nthe internal logic or rules of a story's world -- requires nuanced reasoning\nskills, including tracking entities and events and their interplay, abstract\nthinking, pragmatic narrative understanding, commonsense and social reasoning,\nand theory of mind. As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly generate,\ninterpret, and modify text, rigorously assessing their narrative consistency\nand deeper language understanding becomes critical. However, existing\nbenchmarks focus mainly on surface-level comprehension. In this work, we\npropose plot hole detection in stories as a proxy to evaluate language\nunderstanding and reasoning in LLMs. We introduce FlawedFictionsMaker, a novel\nalgorithm to controllably and carefully synthesize plot holes in human-written\nstories. Using this algorithm, we construct a benchmark to evaluate LLMs' plot\nhole detection abilities in stories -- FlawedFictions -- , which is robust to\ncontamination, with human filtering ensuring high quality. We find that\nstate-of-the-art LLMs struggle in accurately solving FlawedFictions regardless\nof the reasoning effort allowed, with performance significantly degrading as\nstory length increases. Finally, we show that LLM-based story summarization and\nstory generation are prone to introducing plot holes, with more than 50% and\n100% increases in plot hole detection rates with respect to human-written\noriginals.",

To address this, we introduce Agent Security Bench (ASB), a\ncomprehensive framework designed to formalize, benchmark, and evaluate the\nattacks and defenses of LLM-based agents, including 10 scenarios (e.g.,\ne-commerce, autonomous driving, finance), 10 agents targeting the scenarios,\nover 400 tools, 27 different types of attack/defense methods, and 7 evaluation\nmetrics. Based on ASB, we benchmark 10 prompt injection attacks, a memory\npoisoning attack, a novel Plan-of-Thought backdoor attack, 4 mixed attacks, and\n11 corresponding defenses across 13 LLM backbones. Our benchmark results reveal\ncritical vulnerabilities in different stages of agent operation, including\nsystem prompt, user prompt handling, tool usage, and memory retrieval, with the\nhighest average attack success rate of 84.30\\%, but limited effectiveness shown\nin current defenses, unveiling important works to be done in terms of agent\nsecurity for the community.

In particular, each system\nconsists of multiple Internet of Things (IoT) devices that first locally encode\nthe sensing data into semantic features and then transmit them to an edge\nserver for subsequent data fusion and task inference. The inference accuracy is\ndetermined by efficient training of the feature encoder/decoder using labeled\ndata samples. Due to the difference in sensing data and communication channel\ndistributions, deploying the system in a new environment may induce high costs\nin annotating data labels and re-training the encoder/decoder models. To\nachieve cost-effective transferable system deployment, we propose an efficient\nDomain Adaptation method for Semantic Edge INference systems (DASEIN) that can\nmaintain high inference accuracy in a new environment without the need for\nlabeled samples. Specifically, DASEIN exploits the task-relevant data\ncorrelation between different deployment scenarios by leveraging the techniques\nof unsupervised domain adaptation and knowledge distillation. It devises an\nefficient two-step adaptation procedure that sequentially aligns the data\ndistributions and adapts to the channel variations. Numerical results show\nthat, under a substantial change in sensing data distributions, the proposed\nDASEIN outperforms the best-performing benchmark method by 7.09% and 21.33% in\ninference accuracy when the new environment has similar or 25 dB lower channel\nsignal to noise power ratios (SNRs), respectively.

                "summary": "Graph Transformers (GTs), which simultaneously integrate message-passing and\nself-attention mechanisms, have achieved promising empirical results in some\ngraph prediction tasks. Although these approaches show the potential of\nTransformers in capturing long-range graph topology information, issues\nconcerning the quadratic complexity and high computing energy consumption\nseverely limit the scalability of GTs on large-scale graphs. Recently, as\nbrain-inspired neural networks, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), facilitate the\ndevelopment of graph representation learning methods with lower computational\nand storage overhead through the unique event-driven spiking neurons. Inspired\nby these characteristics, we propose a linear-time Graph Transformer using\nSpiking Vector Quantization (GT-SVQ) for node classification. GT-SVQ\nreconstructs codebooks based on rate coding outputs from spiking neurons, and\ninjects the codebooks into self-attention blocks to aggregate global\ninformation in linear complexity. Besides, spiking vector quantization\neffectively alleviates codebook collapse and the reliance on complex machinery\n(distance measure, auxiliary loss, etc.) present in previous vector\nquantization-based graph learning methods. In experiments, we compare GT-SVQ\nwith other state-of-the-art baselines on node classification datasets ranging\nfrom small to large.

                    "value": "Graph Transformers (GTs), which simultaneously integrate message-passing and\nself-attention mechanisms, have achieved promising empirical results in some\ngraph prediction tasks. Although these approaches show the potential of\nTransformers in capturing long-range graph topology information, issues\nconcerning the quadratic complexity and high computing energy consumption\nseverely limit the scalability of GTs on large-scale graphs. Recently, as\nbrain-inspired neural networks, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), facilitate the\ndevelopment of graph representation learning methods with lower computational\nand storage overhead through the unique event-driven spiking neurons. Inspired\nby these characteristics, we propose a linear-time Graph Transformer using\nSpiking Vector Quantization (GT-SVQ) for node classification. GT-SVQ\nreconstructs codebooks based on rate coding outputs from spiking neurons, and\ninjects the codebooks into self-attention blocks to aggregate global\ninformation in linear complexity. Besides, spiking vector quantization\neffectively alleviates codebook collapse and the reliance on complex machinery\n(distance measure, auxiliary loss, etc.) present in previous vector\nquantization-based graph learning methods. In experiments, we compare GT-SVQ\nwith other state-of-the-art baselines on node classification datasets ranging\nfrom small to large. Experimental results show that GT-SVQ has achieved\ncompetitive performances on most datasets while maintaining up to 130x faster\ninference speed compared to other GTs."

Recent work on long Chain-of-Thought reasoning\nhas demonstrated great potential of LLMs on solving competitive problems, but\ntheir verification ability remains to be weak and not sufficiently\ninvestigated. In this paper, we propose Heimdall, the long CoT verification LLM\nthat can accurately judge the correctness of solutions. With pure reinforcement\nlearning, we boost the verification accuracy from 62.5% to 94.5% on competitive\nmath problems. By scaling with repeated sampling, the accuracy further\nincreases to 97.5%. Through human evaluation, Heimdall demonstrates impressive\ngeneralization capabilities, successfully detecting most issues in challenging\nmath proofs, the type of which is not included during training. Furthermore, we\npropose Pessimistic Verification to extend the functionality of Heimdall to\nscaling up the problem solving. It calls Heimdall to judge the solutions from a\nsolver model and based on the pessimistic principle, selects the most likely\ncorrect solution with the least uncertainty. Taking\nDeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B as the solver model, Pessimistic Verification\nimproves the solution accuracy on AIME2025 from 54.2% to 70.0% with 16x compute\nbudget and to 83.3% with more compute budget. With the stronger solver Gemini\n2.5 Pro, the score reaches 93.0%. Finally, we prototype an automatic knowledge\ndiscovery system, a ternary system where one poses questions, another provides\nsolutions, and the third verifies the solutions. Using the data synthesis work\nNuminaMath for the first two components, Heimdall effectively identifies\nproblematic records within the dataset and reveals that nearly half of the data\nis flawed, which interestingly aligns with the recent ablation studies from\nNuminaMath.",

Despite their usefulness, we\nuncover for the first time a novel coreset effect within these benchmarks.\nSpecifically, we find that LLM unlearning achieved with the original (full)\nforget set can be effectively maintained using a significantly smaller subset\n(functioning as a \"coreset\"), e.g., as little as 5% of the forget set, even\nwhen selected at random. This suggests that LLM unlearning in these benchmarks\ncan be performed surprisingly easily, even in an extremely low-data regime. We\ndemonstrate that this coreset effect remains strong, regardless of the LLM\nunlearning method used, such as NPO (Negative Preference Optimization) and RMU\n(Representation Misdirection Unlearning), the popular ones in these benchmarks.\nThe surprisingly strong coreset effect is also robust across various data\nselection methods, ranging from random selection to more sophisticated\nheuristic approaches. We explain the coreset effect in LLM unlearning through a\nkeyword-based perspective, showing that keywords extracted from the forget set\nalone contribute significantly to unlearning effectiveness and indicating that\ncurrent unlearning is driven by a compact set of high-impact tokens rather than\nthe entire dataset. We further justify the faithfulness of coreset-unlearned\nmodels along additional dimensions, such as mode connectivity and robustness to\njailbreaking attacks.

Despite their usefulness, we\nuncover for the first time a novel coreset effect within these benchmarks.\nSpecifically, we find that LLM unlearning achieved with the original (full)\nforget set can be effectively maintained using a significantly smaller subset\n(functioning as a \"coreset\"), e.g., as little as 5% of the forget set, even\nwhen selected at random. This suggests that LLM unlearning in these benchmarks\ncan be performed surprisingly easily, even in an extremely low-data regime. We\ndemonstrate that this coreset effect remains strong, regardless of the LLM\nunlearning method used, such as NPO (Negative Preference Optimization) and RMU\n(Representation Misdirection Unlearning), the popular ones in these benchmarks.\nThe surprisingly strong coreset effect is also robust across various data\nselection methods, ranging from random selection to more sophisticated\nheuristic approaches. We explain the coreset effect in LLM unlearning through a\nkeyword-based perspective, showing that keywords extracted from the forget set\nalone contribute significantly to unlearning effectiveness and indicating that\ncurrent unlearning is driven by a compact set of high-impact tokens rather than\nthe entire dataset. We further justify the faithfulness of coreset-unlearned\nmodels along additional dimensions, such as mode connectivity and robustness to\njailbreaking attacks.

                "summary": "The performance of deep learning models depends heavily on test samples at\nruntime, and shifts from the training data distribution can significantly\nreduce accuracy. Test-time adaptation (TTA) addresses this by adapting models\nduring inference without requiring labeled test data or access to the original\ntraining set. While research has explored TTA from various perspectives like\nalgorithmic complexity, data and class distribution shifts, model\narchitectures, and offline versus continuous learning, constraints specific to\nmobile and edge devices remain underexplored. We propose BoTTA, a benchmark\ndesigned to evaluate TTA methods under practical constraints on mobile and edge\ndevices. Our evaluation targets four key challenges caused by limited resources\nand usage conditions: (i) limited test samples, (ii) limited exposure to\ncategories, (iii) diverse distribution shifts, and (iv) overlapping shifts\nwithin a sample. We assess state-of-the-art TTA methods under these scenarios\nusing benchmark datasets and report system-level metrics on a real testbed.\nFurthermore, unlike prior work, we align with on-device requirements by\nadvocating periodic adaptation instead of continuous inference-time adaptation.\nExperiments reveal key insights: many recent TTA algorithms struggle with small\ndatasets, fail to generalize to unseen categories, and depend on the diversity\nand complexity of distribution shifts. BoTTA also reports device-specific\nresource use. For example, while SHOT improves accuracy by $2.25\\times$ with\n$512$ adaptation samples, it uses $1.08\\times$ peak memory on Raspberry Pi\nversus the base model.

Our results show that ChatTS\nsignificantly outperforms existing vision-based MLLMs (e.g., GPT-4o) and\ntext/agent-based LLMs, achieving a 46.0% improvement in alignment tasks and a\n25.8% improvement in reasoning tasks. We have open-sourced the source code,\nmodel checkpoint and datasets at https://github.com/NetManAIOps/ChatTS."

Engaging deeply with\nstories and spotting plot holes -- inconsistencies in a storyline that break\nthe internal logic or rules of a story's world -- requires nuanced reasoning\nskills, including tracking entities and events and their interplay, abstract\nthinking, pragmatic narrative understanding, commonsense and social reasoning,\nand theory of mind. As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly generate,\ninterpret, and modify text, rigorously assessing their narrative consistency\nand deeper language understanding becomes critical. However, existing\nbenchmarks focus mainly on surface-level comprehension. In this work, we\npropose plot hole detection in stories as a proxy to evaluate language\nunderstanding and reasoning in LLMs. We introduce FlawedFictionsMaker, a novel\nalgorithm to controllably and carefully synthesize plot holes in human-written\nstories. Using this algorithm, we construct a benchmark to evaluate LLMs' plot\nhole detection abilities in stories -- FlawedFictions -- , which is robust to\ncontamination, with human filtering ensuring high quality. We find that\nstate-of-the-art LLMs struggle in accurately solving FlawedFictions regardless\nof the reasoning effort allowed, with performance significantly degrading as\nstory length increases. Finally, we show that LLM-based story summarization and\nstory generation are prone to introducing plot holes, with more than 50% and\n100% increases in plot hole detection rates with respect to human-written\noriginals.",

Experiments on three datasets show up to 57 percent\nimprovement, with an average gain of 31 percent, demonstrating strong zero-shot\nperformance and further gains when ensembled with existing models."

Through targeted experiments\nacross key stages of the generative evaluation pipeline, we demonstrate how\nbest practices from MT evaluation can deepen the understanding of quality\ndifferences between models. Additionally, we identify essential components for\nrobust meta-evaluation of mLLMs, ensuring the evaluation methods themselves are\nrigorously assessed. We distill these insights into a checklist of actionable\nrecommendations for mLLM research and development."

However, linguistic variability in\nquestion phrasing often undermines the consistency of these systems.

Specifically,\nthis approach enriches linguistic diversity while preserving semantic meaning.\nWe further introduce an evaluation metric, Total Agreement Rate with\nSemantically Equivalent Input and Correct Answer (TAR-SC), which assesses a\nmodel's capability to generate consistent and correct responses to semantically\nequivalent linguistic variations. In addition, we also propose three other\ndiversity metrics - average number of QA items per image (ANQI), average number\nof questions per image with the same answer (ANQA), and average number of\nopen-ended questions per image with the same semantics (ANQS). Using the SEQA\nframework, we augmented the benchmarked MVQA public datasets of SLAKE, VQA-RAD,\nand PathVQA.

However, complex tasks with vast solution spaces and\nvague constraints often exceed the capacity of a single reasoning chain.\nInspired by Minimal Free Resolution (MFR) in commutative algebra and algebraic\ngeometry, we propose Syzygy of Thoughts (SoT)-a novel framework that extends\nCoT by introducing auxiliary, interrelated reasoning paths. SoT captures deeper\nlogical dependencies, enabling more robust and structured problem-solving. MFR\ndecomposes a module into a sequence of free modules with minimal rank,\nproviding a structured analytical approach to complex systems. This method\nintroduces the concepts of \"Module\", \"Betti numbers\",\"Freeness\", \"Mapping\",\n\"Exactness\" and \"Minimality\", enabling the systematic decomposition of the\noriginal complex problem into logically complete minimal subproblems while\npreserving key problem features and reducing reasoning length. We tested SoT\nacross diverse datasets (e.g., GSM8K, MATH) and models (e.g., GPT-4o-mini,\nQwen2.5), achieving inference accuracy that matches or surpasses mainstream\nCoTs standards.

                    "value": "Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting enhances the reasoning of large language\nmodels (LLMs) by decomposing problems into sequential steps, mimicking human\nlogic and reducing errors. However, complex tasks with vast solution spaces and\nvague constraints often exceed the capacity of a single reasoning chain.\nInspired by Minimal Free Resolution (MFR) in commutative algebra and algebraic\ngeometry, we propose Syzygy of Thoughts (SoT)-a novel framework that extends\nCoT by introducing auxiliary, interrelated reasoning paths. SoT captures deeper\nlogical dependencies, enabling more robust and structured problem-solving. MFR\ndecomposes a module into a sequence of free modules with minimal rank,\nproviding a structured analytical approach to complex systems. This method\nintroduces the concepts of \"Module\", \"Betti numbers\",\"Freeness\", \"Mapping\",\n\"Exactness\" and \"Minimality\", enabling the systematic decomposition of the\noriginal complex problem into logically complete minimal subproblems while\npreserving key problem features and reducing reasoning length. We tested SoT\nacross diverse datasets (e.g., GSM8K, MATH) and models (e.g., GPT-4o-mini,\nQwen2.5), achieving inference accuracy that matches or surpasses mainstream\nCoTs standards. Additionally, by aligning the sampling process with algebraic\nconstraints, our approach enhances the scalability of inference time in LLMs,\nensuring both transparent reasoning and high performance.

Therefore, understanding the\ninference workload characteristics on evolving CPU-GPU coupled architectures is\ncrucial for optimization. This paper presents an in-depth analysis of LLM\ninference behavior on loosely-coupled (PCIe A100/H100) and closely-coupled\n(GH200) systems. We analyze performance dynamics using fine-grained\noperator-to-kernel trace analysis, facilitated by our novel profiler SKIP and\nmetrics like Total Kernel Launch and Queuing Time (TKLQT). Results show that\nclosely-coupled (CC) GH200 significantly outperforms loosely-coupled (LC)\nsystems at large batch sizes, achieving 1.9x-2.7x faster prefill latency for\nLlama 3.2-1B. However, our analysis also reveals that GH200 remains CPU-bound\nup to 4x larger batch sizes than LC systems. In this extended CPU-bound region,\nwe identify the performance characteristics of the Grace CPU as a key factor\ncontributing to higher inference latency at low batch sizes on GH200. We\ndemonstrate that TKLQT accurately identifies this CPU/GPU-bound transition\npoint. Based on this analysis, we further show that kernel fusion offers\nsignificant potential to mitigate GH200's low-batch latency bottleneck by\nreducing kernel launch overhead. This detailed kernel-level characterization\nprovides critical insights for optimizing diverse CPU-GPU coupling strategies.\nThis work is an initial effort, and we plan to explore other major AI/DL\nworkloads that demand different degrees of CPU-GPU heterogeneous architectures.",

                    "value": "Large language model (LLM)-based inference workloads increasingly dominate\ndata center costs and resource utilization. Therefore, understanding the\ninference workload characteristics on evolving CPU-GPU coupled architectures is\ncrucial for optimization. This paper presents an in-depth analysis of LLM\ninference behavior on loosely-coupled (PCIe A100/H100) and closely-coupled\n(GH200) systems. We analyze performance dynamics using fine-grained\noperator-to-kernel trace analysis, facilitated by our novel profiler SKIP and\nmetrics like Total Kernel Launch and Queuing Time (TKLQT). Results show that\nclosely-coupled (CC) GH200 significantly outperforms loosely-coupled (LC)\nsystems at large batch sizes, achieving 1.9x-2.7x faster prefill latency for\nLlama 3.2-1B. However, our analysis also reveals that GH200 remains CPU-bound\nup to 4x larger batch sizes than LC systems. In this extended CPU-bound region,\nwe identify the performance characteristics of the Grace CPU as a key factor\ncontributing to higher inference latency at low batch sizes on GH200. We\ndemonstrate that TKLQT accurately identifies this CPU/GPU-bound transition\npoint. Based on this analysis, we further show that kernel fusion offers\nsignificant potential to mitigate GH200's low-batch latency bottleneck by\nreducing kernel launch overhead. This detailed kernel-level characterization\nprovides critical insights for optimizing diverse CPU-GPU coupling strategies.\nThis work is an initial effort, and we plan to explore other major AI/DL\nworkloads that demand different degrees of CPU-GPU heterogeneous architectures."

Despite the advanced capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs),\nthey continue to face challenges with CF during continual learning. The\nmajority of existing research focuses on analyzing forgetting patterns through\na singular training sequence, thereby overlooking the intricate effects that\ndiverse tasks have on model behavior. Our study explores CF across various\nsettings, discovering that model forgetting is influenced by both the specific\ntraining tasks and the models themselves. To this end, we interpret forgetting\nby examining the function vector (FV), a compact representation of functions in\nLLMs, offering a model-dependent indicator for the occurrence of CF. Through\ntheoretical and empirical analyses, we demonstrated that CF in LLMs primarily\nstems from biases in function activation rather than the overwriting of task\nprocessing functions. Leveraging these insights, we propose a novel function\nvector guided training methodology, incorporating a regularization technique to\nstabilize the FV and mitigate forgetting. Empirical tests on four benchmarks\nconfirm the effectiveness of our proposed training method, substantiating our\ntheoretical framework concerning CF and model function dynamics. We plan to\nmake our code publicly accessible in the near future.",
