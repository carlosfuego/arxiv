In the single-phase TPC, the proportional scintillation\nlight (S2) is generated in liquid xenon in close proximity to 10 {\\mu}m\ndiameter anode wires. The detector was characterized and the proportional\nscintillation process was studied using the 32.1 keV and 9.4 keV signals from\n83mKr decays. A charge gain factor g2 of up to (1.9 $\\pm$ 0.3) PE/electron was\nreached at an anode voltage 4.4 kV higher than the gate electrode 5 mm below\nit, corresponding to (29 $\\pm$ 6) photons emitted per ionization electron. The\nduration of S2 signals is dominated by electron diffusion and approaches the\nxenon de-excitation timescale for very short electron drift times. The electron\ndrift velocity and the longitudinal diffusion constant were measured at a drift\nfield of 470 V/cm. The results agree with the literature and demonstrate that a\nsingle-phase TPC can be operated successfully.",

To address these issues, we propose a\ntraining-free approach called Activation-aware Singular Value Decomposition\n(ASVD).

Additionally, we propose an efficient iterative calibration process\nto optimize layer-specific decomposition by addressing the varying sensitivity\nof different LLM layers. ASVD can compress a network by 10-20%, without\ncompromising the performance of LLMs. Based on the success of the low-rank\ndecomposition of projection matrices in the self-attention module, we further\nintroduce ASVD to compress the KV cache. By reducing the channel dimension of\nKV activations, memory requirements for KV cache can be largely reduced.

However, detailed experimental characterization of its\nintrinsic defects as well as its defect creation characteristics under electron\nirradiation are scarce. Here, we report on the creation and stability of a\nvariety of defect configurations under 60 kV electron irradiation in mono- and\nbilayer phosphorene including the first experimental reports of stable\nadatom-vacancy-complexes. Displacement cross section measurements in bilayer\nphosphorene yield a value of 7.7 +- 1.4 barn with an estimated lifetime of\nadatom-vacancy-complexes of 19.9 +- 0.7 s, while some are stable for up to 68 s\nunder continuous electron irradiation. Surprisingly, ab initio-based\nsimulations indicate that the complexes should readily recombine, even in\nstructures strained by up to 3 %. The presented results will help to improve\nthe understanding of the wide variety of defects in phosphorene, their\ncreation, and their stability, which may enable new pathways for defect\nengineered phosphorene devices.",

                    "value": "Phosphorene, a puckered two-dimensional allotrope of phosphorus, has sparked\nconsiderable interest in recent years due to its potential especially for\noptoelectronic applications with its layer-number-dependant direct band gap and\nstrongly bound excitons. However, detailed experimental characterization of its\nintrinsic defects as well as its defect creation characteristics under electron\nirradiation are scarce. Here, we report on the creation and stability of a\nvariety of defect configurations under 60 kV electron irradiation in mono- and\nbilayer phosphorene including the first experimental reports of stable\nadatom-vacancy-complexes. Displacement cross section measurements in bilayer\nphosphorene yield a value of 7.7 +- 1.4 barn with an estimated lifetime of\nadatom-vacancy-complexes of 19.9 +- 0.7 s, while some are stable for up to 68 s\nunder continuous electron irradiation. Surprisingly, ab initio-based\nsimulations indicate that the complexes should readily recombine, even in\nstructures strained by up to 3 %. The presented results will help to improve\nthe understanding of the wide variety of defects in phosphorene, their\ncreation, and their stability, which may enable new pathways for defect\nengineered phosphorene devices."

In\nthis work, we propose Domain-Aware Real-Time Dynamic Adaptation (DARDA) to\naddress such issues. Our key approach is to proactively learn latent\nrepresentations of some corruption types, each one associated with a\nsub-network state tailored to correctly classify inputs affected by that\ncorruption. After deployment, DARDA adapts the DNN to previously unseen\ncorruptions in an unsupervised fashion by (i) estimating the latent\nrepresentation of the ongoing corruption; (ii) selecting the sub-network whose\nassociated corruption is the closest in the latent space to the ongoing\ncorruption; and (iii) adapting DNN state, so that its representation matches\nthe ongoing corruption. This way, DARDA is more resource efficient and can\nswiftly adapt to new distributions caused by different corruptions without\nrequiring a large variety of input data. Through experiments with two popular\nmobile edge devices - Raspberry Pi and NVIDIA Jetson Nano - we show that DARDA\nreduces energy consumption and average cache memory footprint respectively by\n1.74x and 2.64x with respect to the state of the art, while increasing the\nperformance by 10.4%, 5.7% and 4.4% on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and TinyImagenet.",

The system architecture includes a WebSocket\nserver for persistent connections, an HTTP server for communication, a MySQL\ndatabase for storage, Redis for caching, and Nginx for load balancing. Each\nmodule operates independently, ensuring flexibility and scalability in the\nsystem's design. A key innovation of this system is its use of a 3D scene to\nmap multiple video inputs onto a virtual canvas, recorded by an in-engine\ncamera for transmission. This design minimizes redundant data, enabling an\nefficient and director-guided live streaming network.

The system architecture includes a WebSocket\nserver for persistent connections, an HTTP server for communication, a MySQL\ndatabase for storage, Redis for caching, and Nginx for load balancing. Each\nmodule operates independently, ensuring flexibility and scalability in the\nsystem's design. A key innovation of this system is its use of a 3D scene to\nmap multiple video inputs onto a virtual canvas, recorded by an in-engine\ncamera for transmission. This design minimizes redundant data, enabling an\nefficient and director-guided live streaming network. The thesis concludes by\ndiscussing challenges encountered during the project and provides solutions for\nfuture improvement."

                "summary": "A critical approach for efficiently deploying computationally demanding large\nlanguage models (LLMs) is Key-Value (KV) caching. The KV cache stores key-value\nstates of previously generated tokens, significantly reducing the need for\nrepetitive computations and thereby lowering latency in autoregressive\ngeneration. However, the size of the KV cache grows linearly with sequence\nlength, posing challenges for applications requiring long context input and\nextensive sequence generation. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective\napproach, called MiniCache, to compress the KV cache across layers from a novel\ndepth perspective, significantly reducing the memory footprint for LLM\ninference. Our approach is based on the observation that KV cache states\nexhibit high similarity between the adjacent layers in the middle-to-deep\nportion of LLMs. To facilitate merging, we propose disentangling the states\ninto the magnitude and direction components, interpolating the directions of\nthe state vectors while preserving their lengths unchanged. Furthermore, we\nintroduce a token retention strategy to keep highly distinct state pairs\nunmerged, thus preserving the information with minimal additional storage\noverhead. Our MiniCache is training-free and general, complementing existing KV\ncache compression strategies, such as quantization and sparsity. We conduct a\ncomprehensive evaluation of MiniCache utilizing various models including\nLLaMA-2, LLaMA-3, Phi-3, Mistral, and Mixtral across multiple benchmarks,\ndemonstrating its exceptional performance in achieving superior compression\nratios and high throughput. On the ShareGPT dataset, LLaMA-2-7B with 4-bit\nMiniCache achieves a remarkable compression ratio of up to 5.02x, enhances\ninference throughput by approximately 5x, and reduces the memory footprint by\n41% compared to the FP16 full cache baseline, all while maintaining\nnear-lossless performance.",

This paper introduces SELCC; a\nShared-Exclusive Latch Cache Coherence protocol that maintains cache coherence\nwithout imposing any computational burden on the remote memory side. SELCC\nbuilds on a one-sided shared-exclusive latch protocol by introducing lazy latch\nrelease and invalidation messages among the compute nodes so that it can\nguarantee both data access atomicity and cache coherence.

It utilizes a novel attention mask approach that\nmodels simultaneous translation during fine-tuning by masking attention for a\ndesired decision policy. Applying the proposed SimulMask on a Falcon LLM for\nthe IWSLT 2017 dataset, we have observed a significant translation quality\nimprovement compared to state-of-the-art prompting optimization strategies on\nfive language pairs while reducing the computational cost."

Visualizing pangenome\ngraphs is vital for understanding genome diversity. Yet, handling large graphs\ncan be challenging due to the high computational demands of the graph layout\nprocess.\n  In this work, we conduct a thorough performance characterization of a\nstate-of-the-art pangenome graph layout algorithm, revealing significant\ndata-level parallelism, which makes GPUs a promising option for compute\nacceleration.

                "summary": "A well-known dilemma in large vision-language models (e.g., GPT-4, LLaVA) is\nthat while increasing the number of vision tokens generally enhances visual\nunderstanding, it also significantly raises memory and computational costs,\nespecially in long-term, dense video frame streaming scenarios. Although\nlearnable approaches like Q-Former and Perceiver Resampler have been developed\nto reduce the vision token burden, they overlook the context causally modeled\nby LLMs (i.e., key-value cache), potentially leading to missed visual cues when\naddressing user queries. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to reduce\nvision compute by leveraging redundant vision tokens \"skipping layers\" rather\nthan decreasing the number of vision tokens. Our method, VideoLLM-MoD, is\ninspired by mixture-of-depths LLMs and addresses the challenge of numerous\nvision tokens in long-term or streaming video. Specifically, for each\ntransformer layer, we learn to skip the computation for a high proportion\n(e.g., 80\\%) of vision tokens, passing them directly to the next layer. This\napproach significantly enhances model efficiency, achieving approximately\n\\textasciitilde42\\% time and \\textasciitilde30\\% memory savings for the entire\ntraining. Moreover, our method reduces the computation in the context and avoid\ndecreasing the vision tokens, thus preserving or even improving performance\ncompared to the vanilla model. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of VideoLLM-MoD, showing its state-of-the-art results on\nmultiple benchmarks, including narration, forecasting, and summarization tasks\nin COIN, Ego4D, and Ego-Exo4D datasets.",

                    "value": "A well-known dilemma in large vision-language models (e.g., GPT-4, LLaVA) is\nthat while increasing the number of vision tokens generally enhances visual\nunderstanding, it also significantly raises memory and computational costs,\nespecially in long-term, dense video frame streaming scenarios. Although\nlearnable approaches like Q-Former and Perceiver Resampler have been developed\nto reduce the vision token burden, they overlook the context causally modeled\nby LLMs (i.e., key-value cache), potentially leading to missed visual cues when\naddressing user queries. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to reduce\nvision compute by leveraging redundant vision tokens \"skipping layers\" rather\nthan decreasing the number of vision tokens. Our method, VideoLLM-MoD, is\ninspired by mixture-of-depths LLMs and addresses the challenge of numerous\nvision tokens in long-term or streaming video. Specifically, for each\ntransformer layer, we learn to skip the computation for a high proportion\n(e.g., 80\\%) of vision tokens, passing them directly to the next layer. This\napproach significantly enhances model efficiency, achieving approximately\n\\textasciitilde42\\% time and \\textasciitilde30\\% memory savings for the entire\ntraining. Moreover, our method reduces the computation in the context and avoid\ndecreasing the vision tokens, thus preserving or even improving performance\ncompared to the vanilla model. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of VideoLLM-MoD, showing its state-of-the-art results on\nmultiple benchmarks, including narration, forecasting, and summarization tasks\nin COIN, Ego4D, and Ego-Exo4D datasets."

Alternative\nvideos are chosen by an online algorithm that is theoretically guaranteed to\nconsider both video utilities and available privacy budgets. (2) \\textit{Noisy\nvideo request generator}, which generates redundant video requests (in addition\nto original ones) utilizing correlated differential privacy to obfuscate\nrequest privacy. (3) \\textit{Online video utility predictor}, which leverages\nfederated learning to collaboratively evaluate video utility in an online\nfashion, aiding in video selection in (1) and noise generation in (2).

More specifically, we design\nPPVF with three core components: (1) \\textit{Online privacy budget scheduler},\nwhich employs a theoretically guaranteed online algorithm to select\nnon-requested videos as candidates with assigned privacy budgets. Alternative\nvideos are chosen by an online algorithm that is theoretically guaranteed to\nconsider both video utilities and available privacy budgets. (2) \\textit{Noisy\nvideo request generator}, which generates redundant video requests (in addition\nto original ones) utilizing correlated differential privacy to obfuscate\nrequest privacy. (3) \\textit{Online video utility predictor}, which leverages\nfederated learning to collaboratively evaluate video utility in an online\nfashion, aiding in video selection in (1) and noise generation in (2). Finally,\nwe conduct extensive experiments using real-world video request traces from\nTencent Video. The results demonstrate that PPVF effectively safeguards user\nrequest privacy while upholding high video caching performance."

                "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have become more prevalent in long-context\napplications such as interactive chatbots, document analysis, and agent\nworkflows, but it is challenging to serve long-context requests with low\nlatency and high throughput. Speculative decoding (SD) is a widely used\ntechnique to reduce latency without sacrificing performance but the\nconventional wisdom suggests that its efficacy is limited to small batch sizes.\nIn MagicDec, we show that surprisingly SD can achieve speedup even for a high\nthroughput inference regime for moderate to long sequences. More interestingly,\nan intelligent drafting strategy can achieve better speedup with increasing\nbatch size based on our rigorous analysis. MagicDec first identifies the\nbottleneck shifts with increasing batch size and sequence length, and uses\nthese insights to deploy speculative decoding more effectively for high\nthroughput inference. Then, it leverages draft models with sparse KV cache to\naddress the KV bottleneck that scales with both sequence length and batch size.\nThis finding underscores the broad applicability of speculative decoding in\nlong-context serving, as it can enhance throughput and reduce latency without\ncompromising accuracy. For moderate to long sequences, we demonstrate up to 2x\nspeedup for LLaMA-2-7B-32K and 1.84x speedup for LLaMA-3.1-8B when serving\nbatch sizes ranging from 32 to 256 on 8 NVIDIA A100 GPUs.

                    "value": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have become more prevalent in long-context\napplications such as interactive chatbots, document analysis, and agent\nworkflows, but it is challenging to serve long-context requests with low\nlatency and high throughput. Speculative decoding (SD) is a widely used\ntechnique to reduce latency without sacrificing performance but the\nconventional wisdom suggests that its efficacy is limited to small batch sizes.\nIn MagicDec, we show that surprisingly SD can achieve speedup even for a high\nthroughput inference regime for moderate to long sequences. More interestingly,\nan intelligent drafting strategy can achieve better speedup with increasing\nbatch size based on our rigorous analysis. MagicDec first identifies the\nbottleneck shifts with increasing batch size and sequence length, and uses\nthese insights to deploy speculative decoding more effectively for high\nthroughput inference. Then, it leverages draft models with sparse KV cache to\naddress the KV bottleneck that scales with both sequence length and batch size.\nThis finding underscores the broad applicability of speculative decoding in\nlong-context serving, as it can enhance throughput and reduce latency without\ncompromising accuracy. For moderate to long sequences, we demonstrate up to 2x\nspeedup for LLaMA-2-7B-32K and 1.84x speedup for LLaMA-3.1-8B when serving\nbatch sizes ranging from 32 to 256 on 8 NVIDIA A100 GPUs.

                "summary": "Datacenter applications often rely on remote procedure calls (RPCs) for fast,\nefficient, and secure communication. However, RPCs are slow, inefficient, and\nhard to use as they require expensive serialization and compression to\ncommunicate over a packetized serial network link. Compute Express Link 3.0\n(CXL) offers an alternative solution, allowing applications to share data using\na cache-coherent, shared-memory interface across clusters of machines.\n  RPCool is a new framework that exploits CXL's shared memory capabilities.\nRPCool avoids serialization by passing pointers to data structures in shared\nmemory. While avoiding serialization is useful, directly sharing pointer-rich\ndata eliminates the isolation that copying data over traditional networks\nprovides, leaving the receiver vulnerable to invalid pointers and concurrent\nupdates to shared data by the sender. RPCool restores this safety with careful\nand efficient management of memory permissions. Another significant challenge\nwith CXL shared memory capabilities is that they are unlikely to scale to an\nentire datacenter. RPCool addresses this by falling back to RDMA-based\ncommunication.\n  Overall, RPCool reduces the round-trip latency by 1.93$\\times$ and\n7.2$\\times$ compared to state-of-the-art RDMA and CXL-based RPC mechanisms,\nrespectively.

                    "value": "Datacenter applications often rely on remote procedure calls (RPCs) for fast,\nefficient, and secure communication. However, RPCs are slow, inefficient, and\nhard to use as they require expensive serialization and compression to\ncommunicate over a packetized serial network link. Compute Express Link 3.0\n(CXL) offers an alternative solution, allowing applications to share data using\na cache-coherent, shared-memory interface across clusters of machines.\n  RPCool is a new framework that exploits CXL's shared memory capabilities.\nRPCool avoids serialization by passing pointers to data structures in shared\nmemory. While avoiding serialization is useful, directly sharing pointer-rich\ndata eliminates the isolation that copying data over traditional networks\nprovides, leaving the receiver vulnerable to invalid pointers and concurrent\nupdates to shared data by the sender. RPCool restores this safety with careful\nand efficient management of memory permissions. Another significant challenge\nwith CXL shared memory capabilities is that they are unlikely to scale to an\nentire datacenter. RPCool addresses this by falling back to RDMA-based\ncommunication.\n  Overall, RPCool reduces the round-trip latency by 1.93$\\times$ and\n7.2$\\times$ compared to state-of-the-art RDMA and CXL-based RPC mechanisms,\nrespectively. Moreover, RPCool performs either comparably or better than other\nRPC mechanisms across a range of workloads."

Much of this work has centered around the\nfamily of set-sharing domains, because of the high precision they offer.\nHowever, this comes at a price: their scalability to a wide set of realistic\nprograms remains challenging and this hinders their wider adoption. In this\nwork, rather than defining new sharing abstract domains, we focus instead on\ndeveloping techniques which can be incorporated in the analyzers to address\naspects that are known to affect the efficiency of these domains, such as the\nnumber of variables, without affecting precision. These techniques are inspired\nin others used in the context of compiler optimizations, such as expression\nreassociation and variable trimming. We present several such techniques and\nprovide an extensive experimental evaluation of over 1100 program modules taken\nfrom both production code and classical benchmarks. This includes the\nSpectector cache analyzer, the s(CASP) system, the libraries of the Ciao\nsystem, the LPdoc documenter, the PLAI analyzer itself, etc. The experimental\nresults are quite encouraging: we have obtained significant speed-ups, and,\nmore importantly, the number of modules that require a timeout was cut in half.\nAs a result, many more programs can be analyzed precisely in reasonable times.",

Much of this work has centered around the\nfamily of set-sharing domains, because of the high precision they offer.\nHowever, this comes at a price: their scalability to a wide set of realistic\nprograms remains challenging and this hinders their wider adoption. In this\nwork, rather than defining new sharing abstract domains, we focus instead on\ndeveloping techniques which can be incorporated in the analyzers to address\naspects that are known to affect the efficiency of these domains, such as the\nnumber of variables, without affecting precision. These techniques are inspired\nin others used in the context of compiler optimizations, such as expression\nreassociation and variable trimming. We present several such techniques and\nprovide an extensive experimental evaluation of over 1100 program modules taken\nfrom both production code and classical benchmarks. This includes the\nSpectector cache analyzer, the s(CASP) system, the libraries of the Ciao\nsystem, the LPdoc documenter, the PLAI analyzer itself, etc. The experimental\nresults are quite encouraging: we have obtained significant speed-ups, and,\nmore importantly, the number of modules that require a timeout was cut in half.\nAs a result, many more programs can be analyzed precisely in reasonable times."

Besides, We find that many writes are duplicate, and the duplication\ncan be inter-dup and intra-dup. While inter-dup means different memory blocks\nare identical, and intra-dup means all the 4B elements in a line are the same.\nIn this work, we propose a cache-assisted GPU memory deduplication architecture\nnamed CMD to reduce the off-chip accesses via utilizing the data duplication in\nGPU applications. CMD includes three key design contributions which aim to\nreduce the three kinds of accesses: (1) A novel GPU memory deduplication\narchitecture that removes the inter-dup and inter-dup lines. As for the\ninter-dup detection, we reduce the extra read requests caused by the\ntraditional read-verify hash process. Besides, we design several techniques to\nmanage duplicate blocks. (2) We propose a cache-assisted read scheme to reduce\nthe reads to duplicate data. When an L2 cache miss wants to read the duplicate\nblock, if the reference block has been fetched to L2 and it is clean, we can\ncopy it to the L2 missed block without accessing off-chip DRAM. As for the\nreads to intra-dup data, CMD uses the on-chip metadata cache to get the data.\n(3) When a cache line is evicted, the clean sectors in the line are invalidated\nwhile the dirty sectors are written back. However, most read-only victims are\nre-referenced from DRAM more than twice. Therefore, we add a full-associate\nFIFO to accommodate the read-only (it is also clean) victims to reduce the\nre-reference counts. Experiments show that CMD can decrease the off-chip\naccesses by 31.01%, reduce the energy by 32.78% and improve performance by\n37.79%.

Lastly, we devise linear multicast beamforming\nstrategies tailored for the flexible scheduling schemes in MIMO-CC systems and\npresent an iterative solution for the efficient design of beamformers.\nExtensive numerical simulations are used to verify the results of the paper."

A novel\nPoisson approximate likelihood (PAL) filter was introduced by Whitehouse et al.\n(2023). PAL employs a Poisson approximation to conditional densities, offering\na fast approximation to the likelihood function for a certain subset of\npartially observed Markov process models. A central piece of evidence for PAL\nis the comparison in Table 1 of Whitehouse et al. (2023), which claims a large\nimprovement for PAL over a standard particle filter algorithm. This evidence,\nbased on a model and data from a previous scientific study by Stocks et al.\n(2020), might suggest that researchers confronted with similar models should\nuse PAL rather than particle filter methods. Taken at face value, this evidence\nalso reduces the credibility of Stocks et al. (2020) by indicating a\nshortcoming with the numerical methods that they used. However, we show that\nthe comparison of log-likelihood values made by Whitehouse et al. (2023) is\nflawed because their PAL calculations were carried out using a dataset scaled\ndifferently from the previous study. If PAL and the particle filter are applied\nto the same data, the advantage claimed for PAL disappears. On simulations\nwhere the model is correctly specified, the particle filter outperforms PAL.",

                    "value": "Filtering algorithms are fundamental for inference on partially observed\nstochastic dynamic systems, since they provide access to the likelihood\nfunction and hence enable likelihood-based or Bayesian inference. A novel\nPoisson approximate likelihood (PAL) filter was introduced by Whitehouse et al.\n(2023). PAL employs a Poisson approximation to conditional densities, offering\na fast approximation to the likelihood function for a certain subset of\npartially observed Markov process models. A central piece of evidence for PAL\nis the comparison in Table 1 of Whitehouse et al. (2023), which claims a large\nimprovement for PAL over a standard particle filter algorithm. This evidence,\nbased on a model and data from a previous scientific study by Stocks et al.\n(2020), might suggest that researchers confronted with similar models should\nuse PAL rather than particle filter methods. Taken at face value, this evidence\nalso reduces the credibility of Stocks et al. (2020) by indicating a\nshortcoming with the numerical methods that they used. However, we show that\nthe comparison of log-likelihood values made by Whitehouse et al. (2023) is\nflawed because their PAL calculations were carried out using a dataset scaled\ndifferently from the previous study. If PAL and the particle filter are applied\nto the same data, the advantage claimed for PAL disappears. On simulations\nwhere the model is correctly specified, the particle filter outperforms PAL."

While these improve performance, they often reach a\nsaturation point. Refinement offers an alternative by using LLM-generated\nfeedback to improve solution quality. However, refinement introduces 3 key\nchallenges: (1) Excessive refinement: Uniformly refining all instances can\nover-correct and reduce the overall performance. (2) Inability to localize and\naddress errors: LLMs have a limited ability to self-correct and struggle to\nidentify and correct their own mistakes. (3) Insufficient refinement: Deciding\nhow many iterations of refinement are needed is non-trivial, and stopping too\nsoon could leave errors unaddressed. To tackle these issues, we propose\nMAgICoRe, which avoids excessive refinement by categorizing problem difficulty\nas easy or hard, solving easy problems with coarse-grained aggregation and hard\nones with fine-grained and iterative multi-agent refinement. To improve error\nlocalization, we incorporate external step-wise reward model (RM) scores.\nMoreover, to ensure effective refinement, we employ a multi-agent loop with\nthree agents: Solver, Reviewer (which generates targeted feedback based on\nstep-wise RM scores), and the Refiner (which incorporates feedback). To ensure\nsufficient refinement, we re-evaluate updated solutions, iteratively initiating\nfurther rounds of refinement. We evaluate MAgICoRe on Llama-3-8B and GPT-3.5\nand show its effectiveness across 5 math datasets. Even one iteration of\nMAgICoRe beats Self-Consistency by 3.4%, Best-of-k by 3.2%, and Self-Refine by\n4.0% while using less than half the samples.

The core innovation of the\nQwen2.5 series lies in integrating the philosophy of self-improvement\nthroughout the entire pipeline, from pre-training and post-training to\ninference: (1) During the pre-training phase, Qwen2-Math-Instruct is utilized\nto generate large-scale, high-quality mathematical data. (2) In the\npost-training phase, we develop a reward model (RM) by conducting massive\nsampling from Qwen2-Math-Instruct. This RM is then applied to the iterative\nevolution of data in supervised fine-tuning (SFT). With a stronger SFT model,\nit's possible to iteratively train and update the RM, which in turn guides the\nnext round of SFT data iteration.

The core innovation of the\nQwen2.5 series lies in integrating the philosophy of self-improvement\nthroughout the entire pipeline, from pre-training and post-training to\ninference: (1) During the pre-training phase, Qwen2-Math-Instruct is utilized\nto generate large-scale, high-quality mathematical data. (2) In the\npost-training phase, we develop a reward model (RM) by conducting massive\nsampling from Qwen2-Math-Instruct. This RM is then applied to the iterative\nevolution of data in supervised fine-tuning (SFT). With a stronger SFT model,\nit's possible to iteratively train and update the RM, which in turn guides the\nnext round of SFT data iteration.

                "summary": "Past ontology requirements engineering (ORE) has primarily relied on manual\nmethods, such as interviews and collaborative forums, to gather user\nrequirements from domain experts, especially in large projects. Current\nOntoChat offers a framework for ORE that utilises large language models (LLMs)\nto streamline the process through four key functions: user story creation,\ncompetency question (CQ) extraction, CQ filtration and analysis, and ontology\ntesting support. In OntoChat, users are expected to prompt the chatbot to\ngenerate user stories. However, preliminary evaluations revealed that they\nstruggle to do this effectively.

In OntoChat, users are expected to prompt the chatbot to\ngenerate user stories. However, preliminary evaluations revealed that they\nstruggle to do this effectively.

To account for the different constraining powers of these methods, we\nassign distinct weights to the SC and CZ contributions. The optimal weights,\nwhich minimize the distribution error, depend on the relative constraining\nstrength of the SC and CZ data. Specifically, for a spectroscopic redshift\nsample that represents 1% of the photo-$z$ sample, the optimal combination\nreduces the total error by 20% (40%) compared to using CZ (SC) alone, and it\nkeeps the bias in mean redshift [$\\Delta \\bar{z} / (1 + z) $] at the level of\n0.3%. Furthermore, when CZ data is only available in the low-$z$ range and the\nhigh-$z$ range relies solely on SC data, SC+CZ enables consistent estimation of\nthe true-$z$ distribution across the entire redshift range. Our findings\ndemonstrate that SC+CZ is an effective tool for constraining the true-$z$\ndistribution, paving the way for clustering-based methods to be applied at\n$z\\gtrsim 1$.",

Specifically, for a spectroscopic redshift\nsample that represents 1% of the photo-$z$ sample, the optimal combination\nreduces the total error by 20% (40%) compared to using CZ (SC) alone, and it\nkeeps the bias in mean redshift [$\\Delta \\bar{z} / (1 + z) $] at the level of\n0.3%. Furthermore, when CZ data is only available in the low-$z$ range and the\nhigh-$z$ range relies solely on SC data, SC+CZ enables consistent estimation of\nthe true-$z$ distribution across the entire redshift range. Our findings\ndemonstrate that SC+CZ is an effective tool for constraining the true-$z$\ndistribution, paving the way for clustering-based methods to be applied at\n$z\\gtrsim 1$."

                "summary": "Transformer-based, pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated\noutstanding performance across diverse domains, particularly in the emerging\n{\\em pretrain-then-finetune} paradigm. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), a\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning method, is commonly used to adapt a base LLM to\nmultiple downstream tasks. Further, LLM platforms enable developers to\nfine-tune multiple models and develop various domain-specific applications\nsimultaneously. However, existing model parallelism schemes suffer from high\ncommunication overhead and inefficient GPU utilization when training multiple\nLoRA tasks across GPUs and machines.\n  In this paper, we present mLoRA, a parallelism-efficient fine-tuning system\ndesigned for training multiple LoRA across GPUs and machines. mLoRA introduces\na novel LoRA-aware pipeline parallelism scheme that efficiently pipelines\nindependent LoRA adapters and their distinct fine-tuning stages across GPUs and\nmachines, along with a new LoRA-efficient operator to enhance GPU utilization\nduring pipelined LoRA training. Our extensive evaluation shows that mLoRA can\nsignificantly reduce average fine-tuning task completion time, e.g., by 30\\%,\ncompared to state-of-the-art methods like FSDP.

Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), a\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning method, is commonly used to adapt a base LLM to\nmultiple downstream tasks. Further, LLM platforms enable developers to\nfine-tune multiple models and develop various domain-specific applications\nsimultaneously. However, existing model parallelism schemes suffer from high\ncommunication overhead and inefficient GPU utilization when training multiple\nLoRA tasks across GPUs and machines.\n  In this paper, we present mLoRA, a parallelism-efficient fine-tuning system\ndesigned for training multiple LoRA across GPUs and machines. mLoRA introduces\na novel LoRA-aware pipeline parallelism scheme that efficiently pipelines\nindependent LoRA adapters and their distinct fine-tuning stages across GPUs and\nmachines, along with a new LoRA-efficient operator to enhance GPU utilization\nduring pipelined LoRA training. Our extensive evaluation shows that mLoRA can\nsignificantly reduce average fine-tuning task completion time, e.g., by 30\\%,\ncompared to state-of-the-art methods like FSDP. More importantly, mLoRA enables\nsimultaneous fine-tuning of larger models, e.g., two Llama-2-13B models on four\nNVIDIA RTX A6000 48GB GPUs, which is not feasible for FSDP due to high memory\nrequirements.

We then use the dataset to evaluate\nseveral LLMs under different evaluation methods, including exact, alias, and\nfuzzy matching. Our results show that the performance improves significantly\nunder the alias and fuzzy matching methods. Further, we explore the impact of\nabstaining and in-context examples, finding that both strategies enhance\nprecision.

By learning low-resolution face\nrepresentations and mimicking the adapted high-resolution knowledge, a\nlight-weight student model can be constructed with high efficiency and\npromising accuracy in recognizing low-resolution faces. Experimental results\nshow that the student model performs impressively in recognizing low-resolution\nfaces with only 0.21M parameters and 0.057MB memory.

To improve\nperception precision, large image encoders, high-resolution images, and\nlong-term temporal inputs have been adopted in recent 3D perception models,\nbringing remarkable performance gains. However, these techniques are often\nincompatible in training and inference scenarios due to computational resource\nconstraints.

However,\nconflict between tasks often arises when optimizing multiple tasks jointly\nwithin an end-to-end 3D perception model. To alleviate these issues, we present\nan end-to-end framework named HENet for multi-task 3D perception in this paper.\nSpecifically, we propose a hybrid image encoding network, using a large image\nencoder for short-term frames and a small image encoder for long-term temporal\nframes. Then, we introduce a temporal feature integration module based on the\nattention mechanism to fuse the features of different frames extracted by the\ntwo aforementioned hybrid image encoders. Finally, according to the\ncharacteristics of each perception task, we utilize BEV features of different\ngrid sizes, independent BEV encoders, and task decoders for different tasks.\nExperimental results show that HENet achieves state-of-the-art end-to-end\nmulti-task 3D perception results on the nuScenes benchmark, including 3D object\ndetection and BEV semantic segmentation.

Most\nresearch on detecting hallucination focuses on the questions with short and\nconcrete correct answers that are easy to check the faithfulness. Hallucination\ndetections for text generation with open-ended answers are more challenging.\nSome researchers use external knowledge to detect hallucinations in generated\ntexts, but external resources for specific scenarios are hard to access. Recent\nstudies on detecting hallucinations in long text without external resources\nconduct consistency comparison among multiple sampled outputs. To handle long\ntexts, researchers split long texts into multiple facts and individually\ncompare the consistency of each pairs of facts. However, these methods (1)\nhardly achieve alignment among multiple facts; (2) overlook dependencies\nbetween multiple contextual facts. In this paper, we propose a graph-based\ncontext-aware (GCA) hallucination detection for text generations, which aligns\nknowledge facts and considers the dependencies between contextual knowledge\ntriples in consistency comparison. Particularly, to align multiple facts, we\nconduct a triple-oriented response segmentation to extract multiple knowledge\ntriples. To model dependencies among contextual knowledge triple (facts), we\nconstruct contextual triple into a graph and enhance triples' interactions via\nmessage passing and aggregating via RGCN. To avoid the omission of knowledge\ntriples in long text, we conduct a LLM-based reverse verification via\nreconstructing the knowledge triples.

                "summary": "In this paper, we study format biases in reinforcement learning from human\nfeedback (RLHF). We observe that many widely-used preference models, including\nhuman evaluators, GPT-4, and top-ranking models on the RewardBench benchmark,\nexhibit strong biases towards specific format patterns, such as lists, links,\nbold text, and emojis. Furthermore, large language models (LLMs) can exploit\nthese biases to achieve higher rankings on popular benchmarks like AlpacaEval\nand LMSYS Chatbot Arena. One notable example of this is verbosity bias, where\ncurrent preference models favor longer responses that appear more\ncomprehensive, even when their quality is equal to or lower than shorter,\ncompeting responses. However, format biases beyond verbosity remain largely\nunderexplored in the literature. In this work, we extend the study of biases in\npreference learning beyond the commonly recognized length bias, offering a\ncomprehensive analysis of a wider range of format biases. Additionally, we show\nthat with a small amount of biased data (less than 1%), we can inject\nsignificant bias into the reward model. Moreover, these format biases can also\nbe easily exploited by downstream alignment algorithms, such as best-of-n\nsampling and online iterative DPO, as it is usually easier to manipulate the\nformat than to improve the quality of responses. Our findings emphasize the\nneed to disentangle format and content both for designing alignment algorithms\nand evaluating models.",

Metric-based and GPT-4-based\nevaluations demonstrate that the proposed AKL outperforms the baselines across\nvarious tasks and improves the diversity and quality of generated responses."

Existing research\neither neglects the intricate interplay between emotion and intent, leading to\nsuboptimal controllability of empathy, or resorts to large language models\n(LLMs), which incur significant computational overhead. In this paper, we\nintroduce ReflectDiffu, a lightweight and comprehensive framework for\nempathetic response generation.

To address these\nconcerns, recent research has focused on developing zero-knowledge machine\nlearning (zkML) techniques that enable the verification of various aspects of\nML models without revealing sensitive information. Recent advances in zkML have\nsubstantially improved efficiency; however, these efforts have primarily\noptimized the process of proving ML computations correct, often overlooking the\nsubstantial overhead associated with verifying the necessary commitments to the\nmodel and data. To address this gap, this paper introduces two new\nCommit-and-Prove SNARK (CP-SNARK) constructions (Apollo and Artemis) that\neffectively address the emerging challenge of commitment verification in zkML\npipelines. Apollo operates on KZG commitments and requires white-box use of the\nunderlying proof system, whereas Artemis is compatible with any homomorphic\npolynomial commitment and only makes black-box use of the proof system. As a\nresult, Artemis is compatible with state-of-the-art proof systems without\ntrusted setup. We present the first implementation of these CP-SNARKs, evaluate\ntheir performance on a diverse set of ML models, and show substantial\nimprovements over existing methods, achieving significant reductions in prover\ncosts and maintaining efficiency even for large-scale models. For example, for\nthe VGG model, we reduce the overhead associated with commitment checks from\n11.5x to 1.2x. Our results suggest that these contributions can move zkML\ntowards practical deployment, particularly in scenarios involving large and\ncomplex ML models.",

To address these challenges and\nenhance robotic scene understanding, we introduce SpotLight: A comprehensive\nframework for robotic interaction with functional elements, specifically light\nswitches.

LLM Unlearning, a post-hoc approach to remove\nthis information from trained LLMs, offers a promising solution to mitigate\nthese risks. However, previous practices face three key challenges: 1. Utility:\nsuccessful unlearning often causes catastrophic collapse on unrelated tasks. 2.\nEfficiency: many methods either involve adding similarly sized models, which\nslows down unlearning or inference, or require retain data that are difficult\nto obtain. 3. Robustness: even effective methods may still leak data via\nextraction techniques. To address these challenges, we propose MEOW, a simple\nyet effective gradient descent-based unlearning method. Specifically, we use an\noffline LLM to generate a set of inverted facts. Then, we design a new metric,\nMEMO, to quantify memorization in LLMs. Finally, based on the signals provided\nby MEMO, we select the most appropriate set of inverted facts and finetune the\nmodel based on them. We evaluate MEOW on the commonly used unlearn benchmark,\nToFU, with Llama2-7B-Chat and Phi-1.5B, and test it on both NLU and NLG tasks.\nResults demonstrate significant improvement of MEOW in forget quality without\nsubstantial loss in model utility. Meanwhile, MEOW does not exhibit significant\ndegradation in NLU or NLG capabilities, and there is even a slight improvement\nin NLU performance.",

Knowledge\ndistillation offers a solution, but the slide-level gradients cannot be\nbackpropagated for student model updates due to high-resolution pathological\nimages and slide-level labels. This study presents an Efficient Fine-tuning on\nCompressed Models (EFCM) framework with two stages: unsupervised feature\ndistillation and fine-tuning. In the distillation stage, Feature Projection\nDistillation (FPD) is proposed with a TransScan module for adaptive receptive\nfield adjustment to enhance the knowledge absorption capability of the student\nmodel. In the slide-level fine-tuning stage, three strategies (Reuse CLAM,\nRetrain CLAM, and End2end Train CLAM (ETC)) are compared. Experiments are\nconducted on 11 downstream datasets related to three large medical models:\nRETFound for retina, MRM for chest X-ray, and BROW for histopathology. The\nexperimental results demonstrate that the EFCM framework significantly improves\naccuracy and efficiency in handling slide-level pathological image problems,\neffectively addressing the challenges of deploying large medical models.\nSpecifically, it achieves a 4.33% increase in ACC and a 5.2% increase in AUC\ncompared to the large model BROW on the TCGA-NSCLC and TCGA-BRCA datasets. The\nanalysis of model inference efficiency highlights the high efficiency of the\ndistillation fine-tuning method.",

We then use the dataset to evaluate\nseveral LLMs under different evaluation methods, including exact, alias, and\nfuzzy matching. Our results show that the performance improves significantly\nunder the alias and fuzzy matching methods. Further, we explore the impact of\nabstaining and in-context examples, finding that both strategies enhance\nprecision. Finally, we demonstrate that additional pre-training on legal\ndocuments, as seen with SaulLM, further improves factual precision from 63% to\n81%.",

However, existing works usually overlook the\nexploration of LLMs' ability to detect characters' known knowledge errors (KKE)\nand unknown knowledge errors (UKE) while playing roles, which would lead to\nlow-quality automatic construction of character trainable corpus. In this\npaper, we propose a probing dataset to evaluate LLMs' ability to detect errors\nin KKE and UKE. The results indicate that even the latest LLMs struggle to\neffectively detect these two types of errors, especially when it comes to\nfamiliar knowledge. We experimented with various reasoning strategies and\npropose an agent-based reasoning method, Self-Recollection and Self-Doubt\n(S2RD), to further explore the potential for improving error detection\ncapabilities. Experiments show that our method effectively improves the LLMs'\nability to detect error character knowledge, but it remains an issue that\nrequires ongoing attention.",

                    "value": "Large language model (LLM) role-playing has gained widespread attention,\nwhere the authentic character knowledge is crucial for constructing realistic\nLLM role-playing agents. However, existing works usually overlook the\nexploration of LLMs' ability to detect characters' known knowledge errors (KKE)\nand unknown knowledge errors (UKE) while playing roles, which would lead to\nlow-quality automatic construction of character trainable corpus. In this\npaper, we propose a probing dataset to evaluate LLMs' ability to detect errors\nin KKE and UKE. The results indicate that even the latest LLMs struggle to\neffectively detect these two types of errors, especially when it comes to\nfamiliar knowledge. We experimented with various reasoning strategies and\npropose an agent-based reasoning method, Self-Recollection and Self-Doubt\n(S2RD), to further explore the potential for improving error detection\ncapabilities. Experiments show that our method effectively improves the LLMs'\nability to detect error character knowledge, but it remains an issue that\nrequires ongoing attention."

Most\nresearch on detecting hallucination focuses on the questions with short and\nconcrete correct answers that are easy to check the faithfulness. Hallucination\ndetections for text generation with open-ended answers are more challenging.\nSome researchers use external knowledge to detect hallucinations in generated\ntexts, but external resources for specific scenarios are hard to access. Recent\nstudies on detecting hallucinations in long text without external resources\nconduct consistency comparison among multiple sampled outputs. To handle long\ntexts, researchers split long texts into multiple facts and individually\ncompare the consistency of each pairs of facts. However, these methods (1)\nhardly achieve alignment among multiple facts; (2) overlook dependencies\nbetween multiple contextual facts. In this paper, we propose a graph-based\ncontext-aware (GCA) hallucination detection for text generations, which aligns\nknowledge facts and considers the dependencies between contextual knowledge\ntriples in consistency comparison. Particularly, to align multiple facts, we\nconduct a triple-oriented response segmentation to extract multiple knowledge\ntriples. To model dependencies among contextual knowledge triple (facts), we\nconstruct contextual triple into a graph and enhance triples' interactions via\nmessage passing and aggregating via RGCN. To avoid the omission of knowledge\ntriples in long text, we conduct a LLM-based reverse verification via\nreconstructing the knowledge triples.

Although deep neural networks (DNNs) represent the\nstate-of-the-art approach for SELD, their significant computational complexity\nand model sizes present challenges for deployment on resource-constrained edge\ndevices, especially under real-time conditions. Despite the growing need for\nreal-time SELD, research in this area remains limited. In this paper, we\ninvestigate the unique challenges of deploying SELD systems for real-world,\nreal-time applications by performing extensive experiments on a commercially\navailable Raspberry Pi 3 edge device. Our findings reveal two critical, often\noverlooked considerations: the high computational cost of feature extraction\nand the performance degradation associated with low-latency, real-time\ninference.

                    "value": "Sound event localization and detection (SELD) is critical for various\nreal-world applications, including smart monitoring and Internet of Things\n(IoT) systems. Although deep neural networks (DNNs) represent the\nstate-of-the-art approach for SELD, their significant computational complexity\nand model sizes present challenges for deployment on resource-constrained edge\ndevices, especially under real-time conditions. Despite the growing need for\nreal-time SELD, research in this area remains limited. In this paper, we\ninvestigate the unique challenges of deploying SELD systems for real-world,\nreal-time applications by performing extensive experiments on a commercially\navailable Raspberry Pi 3 edge device. Our findings reveal two critical, often\noverlooked considerations: the high computational cost of feature extraction\nand the performance degradation associated with low-latency, real-time\ninference. This paper provides valuable insights and considerations for future\nwork toward developing more efficient and robust real-time SELD systems"

Existing approaches, including principlism (reliance on abstract\nethical principles), formalism (rigid application of rules), and technical\nsolutionism (overemphasis on technological fixes), offer little practical\nguidance for addressing ethical challenges of AI in scientific research\npractices. To bridge the gap between abstract principles and day-to-day\nresearch practices, a user-centered, realism-inspired approach is proposed\nhere. It outlines five specific goals for ethical AI use: 1) understanding\nmodel training and output, including bias mitigation strategies; 2) respecting\nprivacy, confidentiality, and copyright; 3) avoiding plagiarism and policy\nviolations; 4) applying AI beneficially compared to alternatives; and 5) using\nAI transparently and reproducibly.

In our research, we tested 36 distinct\npersonas from 12 sociodemographic categories (e.g., age, gender, beauty) across\nfour different LLMs. We find that LLMs' cultural norm interpretation varies\nbased on the persona used and the norm interpretation also varies within a\nsociodemographic category (e.g., a fat person and a thin person as in physical\nappearance group) where an LLM with the more socially desirable persona (e.g.,\na thin person) interprets social norms more accurately than with the less\nsocially desirable persona (e.g., a fat person).

This paper presents\nPLATO, an innovative system that addresses this challenge by leveraging\nspecialized large language model agents to process natural language inputs,\nunderstand the environment, predict tool affordances, and generate executable\nactions for robotic systems. Unlike traditional systems that depend on\nhard-coded environmental information, PLATO employs a modular architecture of\nspecialized agents to operate without any initial knowledge of the environment.\nThese agents identify objects and their locations within the scene, generate a\ncomprehensive high-level plan, translate this plan into a series of low-level\nactions, and verify the completion of each step. The system is particularly\ntested on challenging tool-use tasks, which involve handling diverse objects\nand require long-horizon planning. PLATO's design allows it to adapt to dynamic\nand unstructured settings, significantly enhancing its flexibility and\nrobustness. By evaluating the system across various complex scenarios, we\ndemonstrate its capability to tackle a diverse range of tasks and offer a novel\nsolution to integrate LLMs with robotic platforms, advancing the\nstate-of-the-art in autonomous robotic task execution.

In the first experiment, we\nasked 68 participants to rate short stories generated by the models and humans\nalong dimensions such as grammaticality, relevance, creativity, and\nattractiveness. BART Large outperformed human writers in most aspects, except\ncreativity, with an overall score of 2.11 compared to 1.85 for human-written\ntexts -- a 14% improvement. In the second experiment, the qualitative analysis\nrevealed that, while GPT-4o exhibited near-perfect internal and external\ncoherence, it tended to produce more predictable narratives, with only 3% of\nits stories seen as novel. In contrast, 15% of BART's stories were considered\nnovel, indicating a higher degree of creativity despite its smaller model size.\nThis study provides both quantitative and qualitative insights into how model\nsize and fine-tuning influence the balance between creativity, fluency, and\ncoherence in creative writing tasks.",

The proposed framework employs a novel internal+external\nretrieval mechanism to extract relevant medical entities and relations from the\nreport of interest and an external knowledge source. A three-stage inference\nprocess is introduced, decomposing the task into error detection, localization,\nand correction subtasks, which enhances the explainability and performance of\nthe system. The effectiveness of the approach is evaluated using a benchmark\ndataset created by corrupting real-world radiology reports with realistic\nerrors, guided by domain experts. Experimental results demonstrate the benefits\nof the proposed methods, with the combination of internal and external\nretrieval significantly improving the accuracy of error detection,\nlocalization, and correction across various state-of-the-art LLMs. The findings\ncontribute to the development of more robust and reliable error correction\nsystems for clinical documentation.",
