We apply PINT to the ERA5\nWeatherBench dataset, focusing on long-term forecasting of 2m-temperature data.\nPINT incorporates the Simple Harmonic Oscillator Equation as a physics-informed\nprior, embedding its periodic dynamics into RNN, LSTM, and GRU architectures.\nThis equation's analytical solutions (sine and cosine functions) facilitate\nrigorous evaluation of the benefits of incorporating physics-informed\nconstraints. By benchmarking against a linear regression baseline derived from\nits exact solutions, we quantify the impact of embedding physical principles in\ndata-driven models. Unlike traditional time series models that rely on future\nobservations, PINT is designed for practical forecasting. Using only the first\n90 days of observed data, it iteratively predicts the next two years,\naddressing challenges posed by limited real-time updates. Experiments on the\nWeatherBench dataset demonstrate PINT's ability to generalize, capture periodic\ntrends, and align with physical principles.

This paper presents a\nmicroarchitectural analysis of the modern NVIDIA Blackwell architecture by\nstudying GPU performance\n  features with thought through microbenchmarks. We unveil key subsystems,\nincluding the memory hierarchy, SM execution\n  pipelines, and the SM sub-core units, including the 5th generation tensor\ncores supporting FP4 and FP6 precisions.\n  To understand the different key features of the NVIDIA GPU, we study latency,\nthroughput, cache behavior, and scheduling\n  details, revealing subtle tuning metrics in the design of Blackwell. To\ndevelop a comprehensive analysis, we compare the\n  Blackwell architecture with the previous Hopper architecture by using the\nGeForce RTX 5080 and H100 PCIe, respectively. We\n  evaluate and compare results, presenting both generational improvements and\nperformance regressions. Additionally, we\n  investigate the role of power efficiency and energy consumption under varied\nworkloads. Our findings provide actionable insights\n  for application developers, compiler writers, and performance engineers to\noptimize workloads on Blackwell-based platforms,\n  and contribute new data to the growing research on GPU architectures.",

                    "value": "The rapid development in scientific research provides a need for more compute\npower, which is partly being solved by GPUs. This paper presents a\nmicroarchitectural analysis of the modern NVIDIA Blackwell architecture by\nstudying GPU performance\n  features with thought through microbenchmarks. We unveil key subsystems,\nincluding the memory hierarchy, SM execution\n  pipelines, and the SM sub-core units, including the 5th generation tensor\ncores supporting FP4 and FP6 precisions.\n  To understand the different key features of the NVIDIA GPU, we study latency,\nthroughput, cache behavior, and scheduling\n  details, revealing subtle tuning metrics in the design of Blackwell. To\ndevelop a comprehensive analysis, we compare the\n  Blackwell architecture with the previous Hopper architecture by using the\nGeForce RTX 5080 and H100 PCIe, respectively. We\n  evaluate and compare results, presenting both generational improvements and\nperformance regressions. Additionally, we\n  investigate the role of power efficiency and energy consumption under varied\nworkloads. Our findings provide actionable insights\n  for application developers, compiler writers, and performance engineers to\noptimize workloads on Blackwell-based platforms,\n  and contribute new data to the growing research on GPU architectures."

Caching techniques, which leverage data reuse to reduce\ncomputation, offer opportunities to optimize the performance of LLM inference\nengines. On the one hand, the low-level key-value (KV) cache working at the\ntoken level is widely adopted, albeit it incurs significant overhead as request\nvolume grows. On the other hand, instruction-level caching, which stores full\ninstruction-response pairs, is expected to play an increasingly crucial role.\nHowever, the high variability in the content and length of instructions make it\nrare for identical instructions to recur within a short time window, presenting\nchallenges for effective caching instruction-response pairs. To address this\nchallenge, we propose InstCache, a predictive caching mechanism for LLM serving\nsystems. Leveraging the capability of LLMs, we can effectively reorder the\nrepresentation space of instruction texts and develop a sufficient level of\nspatial locality.

Lizard addresses these limitations by introducing a subquadratic\nattention mechanism that closely approximates softmax attention while\npreserving the output quality. Unlike previous linearization methods, which are\noften limited by fixed model structures and therefore exclude gating\nmechanisms, Lizard incorporates a gating module inspired by recent\nstate-of-the-art linear models. This enables adaptive memory control, supports\nconstant-memory inference, offers strong length generalization, and allows more\nflexible model design. Lizard combines gated linear attention for global\ncontext compression with sliding window attention enhanced by meta memory,\nforming a hybrid mechanism that captures both long-range dependencies and\nfine-grained local interactions. Moreover, we introduce a hardware-aware\nalgorithm that accelerates the training speed of our models. Extensive\nexperiments show that Lizard achieves near-lossless recovery of the teacher\nmodel's performance across standard language modeling tasks, while\nsignificantly outperforming previous linearization methods. On the 5-shot MMLU\nbenchmark, Lizard improves over prior models by 18 points and shows significant\nimprovements on associative recall tasks.",

Concretely, 6G will need to consider both the\nperformance and sustainability targets for the various use cases it will serve.\nMoreover, like previous generations, 6G will have various candidate\ntechnological enablers, making the design space of the system even more\ncomplex. Furthermore, given the subjective nature of the sustainability\nindicators, in particular social sustainability, there is a significant gap in\nliterature on how technical enablers and 6G System design can be linked to\nthem. Hence, in this article a novel method for 6G end-to-end (E2E) system\ndesign based on Knowledge graphs (KG) has been introduced. It considers as its\ninput: the use case KPIs, use case sustainability requirements expressed as Key\nValues (KV) and KV Indicators (KVIs), the ability of the technological enablers\nto satisfy these KPIs and KVIs, the 6G system design principles defined in\nHexa-X-II project, the maturity of a technological enabler and the dependencies\nbetween the various enablers. As part of the KG method, a novel approach for\ndetermining the key values a technological enabler addresses, has also been\nintroduced. The effectiveness of the KG method was demonstrated by its\napplication in designing the 6G E2E system for the cooperating mobile robot use\ncase defined in the Hexa-X-II project, where 82 enablers were selected.

The task consisted of five tracks designed to automatically evaluate\nthe AI tutor's performance across key dimensions of mistake identification,\nprecise location of the mistake, providing guidance, and feedback\nactionability, grounded in learning science principles that define good and\neffective tutor responses, as well as the track focusing on detection of the\ntutor identity. The task attracted over 50 international teams across all\ntracks. The submitted models were evaluated against gold-standard human\nannotations, and the results, while promising, show that there is still\nsignificant room for improvement in this domain: the best results for the four\npedagogical ability assessment tracks range between macro F1 scores of 58.34\n(for providing guidance) and 71.81 (for mistake identification) on three-class\nproblems, with the best F1 score in the tutor identification track reaching\n96.98 on a 9-class task. In this paper, we overview the main findings of the\nshared task, discuss the approaches taken by the teams, and analyze their\nperformance. All resources associated with this task are made publicly\navailable to support future research in this critical domain.",

The task consisted of five tracks designed to automatically evaluate\nthe AI tutor's performance across key dimensions of mistake identification,\nprecise location of the mistake, providing guidance, and feedback\nactionability, grounded in learning science principles that define good and\neffective tutor responses, as well as the track focusing on detection of the\ntutor identity. The task attracted over 50 international teams across all\ntracks. The submitted models were evaluated against gold-standard human\nannotations, and the results, while promising, show that there is still\nsignificant room for improvement in this domain: the best results for the four\npedagogical ability assessment tracks range between macro F1 scores of 58.34\n(for providing guidance) and 71.81 (for mistake identification) on three-class\nproblems, with the best F1 score in the tutor identification track reaching\n96.98 on a 9-class task. In this paper, we overview the main findings of the\nshared task, discuss the approaches taken by the teams, and analyze their\nperformance. All resources associated with this task are made publicly\navailable to support future research in this critical domain."

This decomposed merging approach outperforms existing token\nreduction methods across six video QA benchmarks. Notably, STTM achieves a\n2$\\times$ speed-up with only a 0.5% accuracy drop under a 50% token budget, and\na 3$\\times$ speed-up with just a 2% drop under a 30% budget.

It introduces three key\ninnovations: 1) a preemptive compression strategy selector to preserve critical\ncontext for future conversation turns and selects a customized strategy for the\nconversation; 2) a token-wise heterogeneous attention similarity estimator to\nmitigate the attention similarity computation and storage overhead during model\ngeneration; 3) a bubble-free restoration scheduler to reduce potential bubbles\nbrought by the imbalance of recomputing and loading stream due to compressed KV\ncaches. Empirical evaluations on real-world tasks demonstrate that Krul\nachieves a 1.5x-2.68x reduction in time-to-first-token (TTFT) and a 1.33x-2.35x\nreduction in KV cache storage compared to state-of-the-art methods without\ncompromising generation quality.",

It introduces three key\ninnovations: 1) a preemptive compression strategy selector to preserve critical\ncontext for future conversation turns and selects a customized strategy for the\nconversation; 2) a token-wise heterogeneous attention similarity estimator to\nmitigate the attention similarity computation and storage overhead during model\ngeneration; 3) a bubble-free restoration scheduler to reduce potential bubbles\nbrought by the imbalance of recomputing and loading stream due to compressed KV\ncaches. Empirical evaluations on real-world tasks demonstrate that Krul\nachieves a 1.5x-2.68x reduction in time-to-first-token (TTFT) and a 1.33x-2.35x\nreduction in KV cache storage compared to state-of-the-art methods without\ncompromising generation quality."

                "summary": "Fusion-based quantum computing with dual-rail qubits is a leading candidate\nfor scalable quantum computing using linear optics. This paradigm requires\nsingle photons which are entangled into small resource states before being fed\ninto a fusion network. The most common sources for single optical photons and\nfor small entangled states are probabilistic and heralded. The realization of a\nsingle reliable deterministic source requires many redundant probabilistic\nsources and a complex optical network for rerouting and retiming probabilistic\noutputs. In this work, we show how optomechanics enables reliable production of\nresources for photonic quantum computing without the redundancy of the\nall-optical approach. This is achieved by using acoustic modes as caches of\nquantum resources, ranging from single-particle states to small entangled\nstates, with on-demand read-out. The advantages of acoustic modes as optical\nquantum memories, compared to other technologies, include their intrinsically\nlong lifetimes and that they are solid state, highly tailorable, and\ninsensitive to electromagnetic noise.

                    "value": "Fusion-based quantum computing with dual-rail qubits is a leading candidate\nfor scalable quantum computing using linear optics. This paradigm requires\nsingle photons which are entangled into small resource states before being fed\ninto a fusion network. The most common sources for single optical photons and\nfor small entangled states are probabilistic and heralded. The realization of a\nsingle reliable deterministic source requires many redundant probabilistic\nsources and a complex optical network for rerouting and retiming probabilistic\noutputs. In this work, we show how optomechanics enables reliable production of\nresources for photonic quantum computing without the redundancy of the\nall-optical approach. This is achieved by using acoustic modes as caches of\nquantum resources, ranging from single-particle states to small entangled\nstates, with on-demand read-out. The advantages of acoustic modes as optical\nquantum memories, compared to other technologies, include their intrinsically\nlong lifetimes and that they are solid state, highly tailorable, and\ninsensitive to electromagnetic noise. We show how the resource states can be\nprepared directly in the acoustic modes using optical controls. This is still\nprobabilistic and heralded, as in the all-optical approach, but the acoustic\nmodes act as a quantum memory which is integrated into the production of the\nstates.

Our\nessential design enables random order by inserting a \"position instruction\ntoken\" before each image token to be predicted, representing the spatial\nlocation of the next image token. Trained on randomly permuted token sequences\n-- a more challenging task than fixed-order generation, RandAR achieves\ncomparable performance to its conventional raster-order counterpart.

In this work,\nrather than following prevalent approaches such as linear attention (or SSMs)\nand local attention, we introduce an intermediate design called \\rat between\nrecurrence and attention mechanisms.

By adjusting the size of the chunk, \\rat enables\nflexible trade-offs, combining the strengths of RNN and attention. Empirically,\nwith a chunk size of 16, the \\rat layer achieves a \\(7\\times\\) improvement in\ntraining speed with 100K token sequences and \\(9\\times\\) in generation at 4K\nsequence length, while maintaining similar or sometimes even better accuracy\ncompared to standard attention.

A hybrid data structure combining Gaussian hierarchies with\nSequential Point Trees enables efficient, view-dependent LoD selection, while a\nlightweight caching and view scheduling system exploits temporal coherence to\nsupport real-time streaming and rendering.

In this\nwork, we investigate how MLLMs process visual inputs by analyzing their\nattention mechanisms. We reveal a surprising sparsity phenomenon: only a small\nsubset (approximately less than 5%) of attention heads in LLMs actively\ncontribute to visual understanding, termed visual heads. To identify these\nheads efficiently, we design a training-free framework that quantifies\nhead-level visual relevance through targeted response analysis. Building on\nthis discovery, we introduce SparseMM, a KV-Cache optimization strategy that\nallocates asymmetric computation budgets to heads in LLMs based on their visual\nscores, leveraging the sparity of visual heads for accelerating the inference\nof MLLMs. Compared with prior KV-Cache acceleration methods that ignore the\nparticularity of visual, SparseMM prioritizes stress and retaining visual\nsemantics during decoding. Extensive evaluations across mainstream multimodal\nbenchmarks demonstrate that SparseMM achieves superior accuracy-efficiency\ntrade-offs.

These results offer valuable\ninsights into optimizing plasma parameters for different applications,\npotentially resulting in better treatment outcomes across a range of\ntherapeutic domains."

Fine-tuning LLMs with\nparameter-efficient adapters, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), enables these\nmodels to efficiently adapt to downstream tasks without extensive retraining.\nDeploying fine-tuned LLMs on multi-tenant edge devices offers substantial\nbenefits, such as reduced latency, enhanced privacy, and personalized\nresponses. However, serving LLMs efficiently on resource-constrained edge\ndevices presents critical challenges, including the complexity of adapter\nselection for different tasks and memory overhead from frequent adapter\nswapping. Moreover, given the multiple requests in multi-tenant settings,\nprocessing requests sequentially results in underutilization of computational\nresources and increased latency. This paper introduces EdgeLoRA, an efficient\nsystem for serving LLMs on edge devices in multi-tenant environments. EdgeLoRA\nincorporates three key innovations: (1) an adaptive adapter selection mechanism\nto streamline the adapter configuration process; (2) heterogeneous memory\nmanagement, leveraging intelligent adapter caching and pooling to mitigate\nmemory operation overhead; and (3) batch LoRA inference, enabling efficient\nbatch processing to significantly reduce computational latency. Comprehensive\nevaluations using the Llama3.1-8B model demonstrate that EdgeLoRA significantly\noutperforms the status quo (i.e., llama.cpp) in terms of both latency and\nthroughput. The results demonstrate that EdgeLoRA can achieve up to a 4 times\nboost in throughput. Even more impressively, it can serve several orders of\nmagnitude more adapters simultaneously.

Yet, the size of\nthe KV cache grows proportionally with the input length, burdening both memory\nbandwidth and capacity as decoding progresses. To address this challenge, we\npresent RocketKV, a training-free KV cache compression strategy containing two\nconsecutive stages.

Specifically, our model obtains\ncontextual relationships between data features and the target indicator,\ncategorizing their correlations as positive, negative, mixed, or irrelevant.\nThese features are then fed into the linear estimator with tailored weight\nconstraints for each category. To capture nonlinear patterns, the model also\nidentifies meaningful feature interactions and integrates them, along with\nnonlinear transformations. Experiments across three countries at different\nstages of development demonstrate that our model outperforms baselines in\nestimating socio-economic indicators, even for low-income countries with\nlimited data availability.",

AutoSteer incorporates three core\ncomponents: (1) a novel Safety Awareness Score (SAS) that automatically\nidentifies the most safety-relevant distinctions among the model's internal\nlayers; (2) an adaptive safety prober trained to estimate the likelihood of\ntoxic outputs from intermediate representations; and (3) a lightweight Refusal\nHead that selectively intervenes to modulate generation when safety risks are\ndetected. Experiments on LLaVA-OV and Chameleon across diverse safety-critical\nbenchmarks demonstrate that AutoSteer significantly reduces the Attack Success\nRate (ASR) for textual, visual, and cross-modal threats, while maintaining\ngeneral abilities. These findings position AutoSteer as a practical,\ninterpretable, and effective framework for safer deployment of multimodal AI\nsystems.",

                "summary": "We present VITA, a Vision-To-Action flow matching policy that evolves latent\nvisual representations into latent actions for visuomotor control. Traditional\nflow matching and diffusion policies sample from standard source distributions\n(e.g., Gaussian noise) and require additional conditioning mechanisms like\ncross-attention to condition action generation on visual information, creating\ntime and space overheads. VITA proposes a novel paradigm that treats latent\nimages as the flow source, learning an inherent mapping from vision to action\nwhile eliminating separate conditioning modules and preserving generative\nmodeling capabilities. Learning flows between fundamentally different\nmodalities like vision and action is challenging due to sparse action data\nlacking semantic structures and dimensional mismatches between high-dimensional\nvisual representations and raw actions. We address this by creating a\nstructured action latent space via an autoencoder as the flow matching target,\nup-sampling raw actions to match visual representation shapes. Crucially, we\nsupervise flow matching with both encoder targets and final action outputs\nthrough flow latent decoding, which backpropagates action reconstruction loss\nthrough sequential flow matching ODE solving steps for effective end-to-end\nlearning.

                    "value": "We present VITA, a Vision-To-Action flow matching policy that evolves latent\nvisual representations into latent actions for visuomotor control. Traditional\nflow matching and diffusion policies sample from standard source distributions\n(e.g., Gaussian noise) and require additional conditioning mechanisms like\ncross-attention to condition action generation on visual information, creating\ntime and space overheads. VITA proposes a novel paradigm that treats latent\nimages as the flow source, learning an inherent mapping from vision to action\nwhile eliminating separate conditioning modules and preserving generative\nmodeling capabilities. Learning flows between fundamentally different\nmodalities like vision and action is challenging due to sparse action data\nlacking semantic structures and dimensional mismatches between high-dimensional\nvisual representations and raw actions. We address this by creating a\nstructured action latent space via an autoencoder as the flow matching target,\nup-sampling raw actions to match visual representation shapes. Crucially, we\nsupervise flow matching with both encoder targets and final action outputs\nthrough flow latent decoding, which backpropagates action reconstruction loss\nthrough sequential flow matching ODE solving steps for effective end-to-end\nlearning.

Recently,\ncompositional visual reasoning approaches, which leverage the reasoning\nabilities of large language models (LLMs) with integrated tools to solve\nproblems, have shown promise as more effective strategies than end-to-end VR\nmethods. However, these approaches face limitations, as frozen LLMs lack tool\nawareness in VR, leading to performance bottlenecks. While leveraging LLMs for\nreasoning is widely used in other domains, they are not directly applicable to\nVR due to limited training data, imperfect tools that introduce errors and\nreduce data collection efficiency in VR, and challenging in fine-tuning on\nnoisy workflows. To address these challenges, we propose DWIM: i)\nDiscrepancy-aware training Workflow generation, which assesses tool usage and\nextracts more viable workflows for training; and ii) Instruct-Masking\nfine-tuning, which guides the model to only clone effective actions, enabling\nthe generation of more practical solutions. Our experiments demonstrate that\nDWIM achieves state-of-the-art performance across various VR tasks, exhibiting\nstrong generalization on multiple widely-used datasets.",

Existing approaches for continual visual concept learning are\nconstrained by two fundamental challenges: catastrophic forgetting and\nparameter expansion. In this paper, we propose Redundancy-Removal Mixture of\nExperts (R^2MoE), a parameter-efficient framework for lifelong visual concept\nlearning that effectively learns new concepts while incurring minimal parameter\noverhead. Our framework includes three key innovative contributions: First, we\npropose a mixture-of-experts framework with a routing distillation mechanism\nthat enables experts to acquire concept-specific knowledge while preserving the\ngating network's routing capability, thereby effectively mitigating\ncatastrophic forgetting. Second, we propose a strategy for eliminating\nredundant layer-wise experts that reduces the number of expert parameters by\nfully utilizing previously learned experts. Third, we employ a hierarchical\nlocal attention-guided inference approach to mitigate interference between\ngenerated visual concepts. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our\nmethod generates images with superior conceptual fidelity compared to the\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) method, achieving an impressive 87.8\\% reduction in\nforgetting rates and 63.3\\% fewer parameters on the CustomConcept 101 dataset.\nOur code is available at {https://github.com/learninginvision/R2MoE}",

We further introduce J1-EVAL, a fine-grained evaluation framework,\ndesigned to assess both task performance and procedural compliance across\nvarying levels of legal proficiency. Extensive experiments on 17 LLM agents\nreveal that, while many models demonstrate solid legal knowledge, they struggle\nwith procedural execution in dynamic settings.

To achieve comprehensive checking logic, AutoChecker incrementally\nupdates the checker's logic by focusing on solving one selected case each time.\nTo obtain precise API knowledge, during each iteration, it leverages\nfine-grained logic-guided API-context retrieval, where it first decomposes the\nchecking logic into a series of sub-operations and then retrieves\nchecker-related API-contexts for each sub-operation. For evaluation, we apply\nAutoChecker, five baselines, and three ablation methods using multiple LLMs to\ngenerate checkers for 20 randomly selected PMD rules. Experimental results show\nthat AutoChecker significantly outperforms others across all effectiveness\nmetrics, with an average test pass rate of 82.28%.

Among various CIR approaches, training-free zero-shot\nmethods based on pre-trained models are cost-effective but still face notable\nlimitations. For example, sequential VLM-LLM pipelines process each modality\nindependently, which often results in information loss and limits cross-modal\ninteraction. In contrast, methods based on multimodal large language models\n(MLLMs) often focus exclusively on applying changes indicated by the text,\nwithout fully utilizing the contextual visual information from the reference\nimage. To address these issues, we propose multi-faceted Chain-of-Thought with\nre-ranking (MCoT-RE), a training-free zero-shot CIR framework. MCoT-RE utilizes\nmulti-faceted Chain-of-Thought to guide the MLLM to balance explicit\nmodifications and contextual visual cues, generating two distinct captions: one\nfocused on modification and the other integrating comprehensive visual-textual\ncontext. The first caption is used to filter candidate images. Subsequently, we\ncombine these two captions and the reference image to perform multi-grained\nre-ranking. This two-stage approach facilitates precise retrieval by aligning\nwith the textual modification instructions while preserving the visual context\nof the reference image. Through extensive experiments, MCoT-RE achieves\nstate-of-the-art results among training-free methods, yielding improvements of\nup to 6.24% in Recall@10 on FashionIQ and 8.58% in Recall@1 on CIRR.",

                "summary": "Generative adversarial attacks train a perturbation generator on a white-box\nsurrogate model and subsequently apply the crafted perturbations to unseen\nblack-box victim models. In contrast to iterative attacks, these methods\ndeliver superior inference-time efficiency, scalability, and transferability;\nhowever, up until now, existing studies have not fully exploited the\nrepresentational capacity of generative models to preserve and harness semantic\ninformation. Specifically, the intermediate activations of the generator encode\nrich semantic features--object boundaries and coarse shapes--that remain\nunder-exploited, thereby limiting the alignment of perturbations with\nobject-salient regions which are critical for adversarial transferability.

In contrast to iterative attacks, these methods\ndeliver superior inference-time efficiency, scalability, and transferability;\nhowever, up until now, existing studies have not fully exploited the\nrepresentational capacity of generative models to preserve and harness semantic\ninformation. Specifically, the intermediate activations of the generator encode\nrich semantic features--object boundaries and coarse shapes--that remain\nunder-exploited, thereby limiting the alignment of perturbations with\nobject-salient regions which are critical for adversarial transferability.

This survey introduces\nContext Engineering, a formal discipline that transcends simple prompt design\nto encompass the systematic optimization of information payloads for LLMs. We\npresent a comprehensive taxonomy decomposing Context Engineering into its\nfoundational components and the sophisticated implementations that integrate\nthem into intelligent systems. We first examine the foundational components:\ncontext retrieval and generation, context processing and context management. We\nthen explore how these components are architecturally integrated to create\nsophisticated system implementations: retrieval-augmented generation (RAG),\nmemory systems and tool-integrated reasoning, and multi-agent systems. Through\nthis systematic analysis of over 1300 research papers, our survey not only\nestablishes a technical roadmap for the field but also reveals a critical\nresearch gap: a fundamental asymmetry exists between model capabilities. While\ncurrent models, augmented by advanced context engineering, demonstrate\nremarkable proficiency in understanding complex contexts, they exhibit\npronounced limitations in generating equally sophisticated, long-form outputs.\nAddressing this gap is a defining priority for future research. Ultimately,\nthis survey provides a unified framework for both researchers and engineers\nadvancing context-aware AI.",

                    "value": "The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) is fundamentally determined\nby the contextual information provided during inference. This survey introduces\nContext Engineering, a formal discipline that transcends simple prompt design\nto encompass the systematic optimization of information payloads for LLMs. We\npresent a comprehensive taxonomy decomposing Context Engineering into its\nfoundational components and the sophisticated implementations that integrate\nthem into intelligent systems. We first examine the foundational components:\ncontext retrieval and generation, context processing and context management. We\nthen explore how these components are architecturally integrated to create\nsophisticated system implementations: retrieval-augmented generation (RAG),\nmemory systems and tool-integrated reasoning, and multi-agent systems. Through\nthis systematic analysis of over 1300 research papers, our survey not only\nestablishes a technical roadmap for the field but also reveals a critical\nresearch gap: a fundamental asymmetry exists between model capabilities. While\ncurrent models, augmented by advanced context engineering, demonstrate\nremarkable proficiency in understanding complex contexts, they exhibit\npronounced limitations in generating equally sophisticated, long-form outputs.\nAddressing this gap is a defining priority for future research. Ultimately,\nthis survey provides a unified framework for both researchers and engineers\nadvancing context-aware AI."

To address these limitations, this paper\nintroduces Hierarchical Clustering for Sparsely activated Mixture of Experts\n(HC-SMoE), a task-agnostic expert merging framework for parameter reduction\nwithout retraining. HC-SMoE introduces a novel hierarchical clustering approach\nbased on expert outputs to ensure merging robustness independent of routing\ndecisions. The proposed output-based clustering method enables effective\ncapture of functional relationships between experts for large-scale\narchitectures. We provide theoretical analysis and comprehensive evaluations\nacross multiple zero-shot language tasks to demonstrate HC-SMoE's effectiveness\nin state-of-the-art models including Qwen and Mixtral. The experimental results\nvalidate HC-SMoE's superior performance and practical applicability for\nreal-world deployments."

AutoSteer incorporates three core\ncomponents: (1) a novel Safety Awareness Score (SAS) that automatically\nidentifies the most safety-relevant distinctions among the model's internal\nlayers; (2) an adaptive safety prober trained to estimate the likelihood of\ntoxic outputs from intermediate representations; and (3) a lightweight Refusal\nHead that selectively intervenes to modulate generation when safety risks are\ndetected. Experiments on LLaVA-OV and Chameleon across diverse safety-critical\nbenchmarks demonstrate that AutoSteer significantly reduces the Attack Success\nRate (ASR) for textual, visual, and cross-modal threats, while maintaining\ngeneral abilities. These findings position AutoSteer as a practical,\ninterpretable, and effective framework for safer deployment of multimodal AI\nsystems.",

We administered the test to 24 humans and to an\nequal number of LLMs, and we automatically evaluated their answers using OCSAI\ntool for three criteria: Originality, Elaboration, and Flexibility. The results\nshow that LLMs not only outperformed humans in all the assessed criteria, but\ndid better in six out of the eight test tasks. We then computed the uniqueness\nof the individual answers, which showed some minor differences between humans\nand LLMs. Finally, we performed a short manual analysis of the dataset, which\nrevealed that humans are more inclined towards E(extending)-creativity, while\nLLMs favor F(ixed)-creativity.",

While large language models (LLMs) show significant\npotential for multi-interest analysis due to their extensive knowledge and\npowerful reasoning capabilities, two key challenges remain.

This paper\npresents the design, implementation, and evaluation of the autonomous museum\nguide robot Alter-Ego equipped with advanced navigation and interactive\ncapabilities. The robot leverages state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs)\nto provide real-time, context aware question-and-answer (Q&A) interactions,\nallowing visitors to engage in conversations about exhibits. It also employs\nrobust simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) techniques, enabling\nseamless navigation through museum spaces and route adaptation based on user\nrequests. The system was tested in a real museum environment with 34\nparticipants, combining qualitative analysis of visitor-robot conversations and\nquantitative analysis of pre and post interaction surveys. Results showed that\nthe robot was generally well-received and contributed to an engaging museum\nexperience, despite some limitations in comprehension and responsiveness. This\nstudy sheds light on HRI in cultural spaces, highlighting not only the\npotential of AI-driven robotics to support accessibility and knowledge\nacquisition, but also the current limitations and challenges of deploying such\ntechnologies in complex, real-world environments.",

This paper\npresents the design, implementation, and evaluation of the autonomous museum\nguide robot Alter-Ego equipped with advanced navigation and interactive\ncapabilities. The robot leverages state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs)\nto provide real-time, context aware question-and-answer (Q&A) interactions,\nallowing visitors to engage in conversations about exhibits. It also employs\nrobust simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) techniques, enabling\nseamless navigation through museum spaces and route adaptation based on user\nrequests. The system was tested in a real museum environment with 34\nparticipants, combining qualitative analysis of visitor-robot conversations and\nquantitative analysis of pre and post interaction surveys. Results showed that\nthe robot was generally well-received and contributed to an engaging museum\nexperience, despite some limitations in comprehension and responsiveness. This\nstudy sheds light on HRI in cultural spaces, highlighting not only the\npotential of AI-driven robotics to support accessibility and knowledge\nacquisition, but also the current limitations and challenges of deploying such\ntechnologies in complex, real-world environments."

While existing research primarily focuses on\neither patient-robot or physician-robot interaction, the role of an intelligent\nvirtual sonographer (IVS) bridging physician-robot-patient communication\nremains underexplored. This work introduces a conversational virtual agent in\nExtended Reality (XR) that facilitates real-time interaction between\nphysicians, a robotic ultrasound system(RUS), and patients. The IVS agent\ncommunicates with physicians in a professional manner while offering empathetic\nexplanations and reassurance to patients. Furthermore, it actively controls the\nRUS by executing physician commands and transparently relays these actions to\nthe patient. By integrating LLM-powered dialogue with speech-to-text,\ntext-to-speech, and robotic control, our system enhances the efficiency,\nclarity, and accessibility of robotic ultrasound acquisition. This work\nconstitutes a first step toward understanding how IVS can bridge communication\ngaps in physician-robot-patient interaction, providing more control and\ntherefore trust into physician-robot interaction while improving patient\nexperience and acceptance of robotic ultrasound.",

We present LLM2Fx, a framework leveraging Large Language Models\n(LLMs) to predict Fx parameters directly from textual descriptions without\nrequiring task-specific training or fine-tuning. Our approach address the\ntext-to-effect parameter prediction (Text2Fx) task by mapping natural language\ndescriptions to the corresponding Fx parameters for equalization and\nreverberation.

We present LLM2Fx, a framework leveraging Large Language Models\n(LLMs) to predict Fx parameters directly from textual descriptions without\nrequiring task-specific training or fine-tuning. Our approach address the\ntext-to-effect parameter prediction (Text2Fx) task by mapping natural language\ndescriptions to the corresponding Fx parameters for equalization and\nreverberation.

Recent post-training quantization (PTQ)\nmethods have attempted to mitigate this issue by focusing on the iterative\nnature of diffusion models. However, these approaches often overlook outliers,\nleading to degraded performance at low bit-widths. In this paper, we propose a\nDMQ which combines Learned Equivalent Scaling (LES) and channel-wise\nPower-of-Two Scaling (PTS) to effectively address these challenges. Learned\nEquivalent Scaling optimizes channel-wise scaling factors to redistribute\nquantization difficulty between weights and activations, reducing overall\nquantization error. Recognizing that early denoising steps, despite having\nsmall quantization errors, crucially impact the final output due to error\naccumulation, we incorporate an adaptive timestep weighting scheme to\nprioritize these critical steps during learning. Furthermore, identifying that\nlayers such as skip connections exhibit high inter-channel variance, we\nintroduce channel-wise Power-of-Two Scaling for activations. To ensure robust\nselection of PTS factors even with small calibration set, we introduce a voting\nalgorithm that enhances reliability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our\nmethod significantly outperforms existing works, especially at low bit-widths\nsuch as W4A6 (4-bit weight, 6-bit activation) and W4A8, maintaining high image\ngeneration quality and model stability.

This leads\nto unbounded memory growth, increased computational costs, and degraded\nreasoning performance on out-of-distribution input lengths. We introduce MEM1,\nan end-to-end reinforcement learning framework that enables agents to operate\nwith constant memory across long multi-turn tasks. At each turn, MEM1 updates a\ncompact shared internal state that jointly supports memory consolidation and\nreasoning. This state integrates prior memory with new observations from the\nenvironment while strategically discarding irrelevant or redundant information.\nTo support training in more realistic and compositional settings, we propose a\nsimple yet effective and scalable approach to constructing multi-turn\nenvironments by composing existing datasets into arbitrarily complex task\nsequences. Experiments across three domains, including internal retrieval QA,\nopen-domain web QA, and multi-turn web shopping, show that MEM1-7B improves\nperformance by 3.5x while reducing memory usage by 3.7x compared to\nQwen2.5-14B-Instruct on a 16-objective multi-hop QA task, and generalizes\nbeyond the training horizon.

We empirically evaluate the power of\n3 open SotA LLMs in zero-shot setting (Gemma-7B, Mixtral 8x7B, and\nLLaMA-2-13B). We acquired the top 10 most popular books of a month, according\nto Project Gutenberg, divided each one into equal chunks of 400 words, and\nprompted each LLM to predict the author. We then randomly sampled 162 chunks\nper book for human evaluation, based on the error margin of 7% and a confidence\nlevel of 95%. The average results show that Mixtral 8x7B has the highest\nprediction accuracy, the lowest SHI, and a Pearson's correlation (r) of 0.724,\n0.263, and -0.9996, respectively, followed by LLaMA-2-13B and Gemma-7B.\nHowever, Mixtral 8x7B suffers from high hallucinations for 3 books, rising as\nhigh as a SHI of 0.87 (in the range 0-1, where 1 is the worst). The strong\nnegative correlation of accuracy and SHI, given by r, demonstrates the fidelity\nof the new hallucination metric, which may generalize to other tasks. We also\nshow that prediction accuracies correlate positively with the frequencies of\nWikipedia instances of the book titles instead of the downloads and we perform\nerror analyses of predictions.

The average results show that Mixtral 8x7B has the highest\nprediction accuracy, the lowest SHI, and a Pearson's correlation (r) of 0.724,\n0.263, and -0.9996, respectively, followed by LLaMA-2-13B and Gemma-7B.\nHowever, Mixtral 8x7B suffers from high hallucinations for 3 books, rising as\nhigh as a SHI of 0.87 (in the range 0-1, where 1 is the worst). The strong\nnegative correlation of accuracy and SHI, given by r, demonstrates the fidelity\nof the new hallucination metric, which may generalize to other tasks. We also\nshow that prediction accuracies correlate positively with the frequencies of\nWikipedia instances of the book titles instead of the downloads and we perform\nerror analyses of predictions. We publicly release the annotated chunks of data\nand our codes to aid the reproducibility and evaluation of other models."

Defined by oxygen dependence at 36 weeks\npostmenstrual age, it causes lifelong respiratory complications. However,\npreventive interventions carry severe risks, including neurodevelopmental\nimpairment, ventilator-induced lung injury, and systemic complications.\nTherefore, early BPD prognosis and prediction of BPD outcome is crucial to\navoid unnecessary toxicity in low risk infants. Admission radiographs of\nextremely preterm infants are routinely acquired within 24h of life and could\nserve as a non-invasive prognostic tool. In this work, we developed and\ninvestigated a deep learning approach using chest X-rays from 163 extremely\nlow-birth-weight infants ($\\leq$32 weeks gestation, 401-999g) obtained within\n24 hours of birth. We fine-tuned a ResNet-50 pretrained specifically on adult\nchest radiographs, employing progressive layer freezing with discriminative\nlearning rates to prevent overfitting and evaluated a CutMix augmentation and\nlinear probing. For moderate/severe BPD outcome prediction, our best performing\nmodel with progressive freezing, linear probing and CutMix achieved an AUROC of\n0.78 $\\pm$ 0.10, balanced accuracy of 0.69 $\\pm$ 0.10, and an F1-score of 0.67\n$\\pm$ 0.11. In-domain pre-training significantly outperformed ImageNet\ninitialization (p = 0.031) which confirms domain-specific pretraining to be\nimportant for BPD outcome prediction. Routine IRDS grades showed limited\nprognostic value (AUROC 0.57 $\\pm$ 0.11), confirming the need of learned\nmarkers. Our approach demonstrates that domain-specific pretraining enables\naccurate BPD prediction from routine day-1 radiographs.

Among various CIR approaches, training-free zero-shot\nmethods based on pre-trained models are cost-effective but still face notable\nlimitations. For example, sequential VLM-LLM pipelines process each modality\nindependently, which often results in information loss and limits cross-modal\ninteraction. In contrast, methods based on multimodal large language models\n(MLLMs) often focus exclusively on applying changes indicated by the text,\nwithout fully utilizing the contextual visual information from the reference\nimage. To address these issues, we propose multi-faceted Chain-of-Thought with\nre-ranking (MCoT-RE), a training-free zero-shot CIR framework. MCoT-RE utilizes\nmulti-faceted Chain-of-Thought to guide the MLLM to balance explicit\nmodifications and contextual visual cues, generating two distinct captions: one\nfocused on modification and the other integrating comprehensive visual-textual\ncontext. The first caption is used to filter candidate images. Subsequently, we\ncombine these two captions and the reference image to perform multi-grained\nre-ranking. This two-stage approach facilitates precise retrieval by aligning\nwith the textual modification instructions while preserving the visual context\nof the reference image. Through extensive experiments, MCoT-RE achieves\nstate-of-the-art results among training-free methods, yielding improvements of\nup to 6.24% in Recall@10 on FashionIQ and 8.58% in Recall@1 on CIRR.",

                "summary": "Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) with numerical feedback, such\nas scalar rewards, have significantly enhanced the complex reasoning\ncapabilities of large language models (LLMs). Despite this success, we identify\nthree key challenges encountered by RL with solely numerical feedback:\nperformance plateaus, limited effectiveness of spontaneous self-reflection, and\npersistent failures. We then demonstrate that RL-finetuned models, even after\nexhibiting performance plateaus, can generate correct refinements on\npersistently failed problems by leveraging natural language feedback in the\nform of critiques. Building on this insight, we propose Critique-GRPO, an\nonline RL framework that integrates both natural language and numerical\nfeedback for effective policy optimization. Critique-GRPO enables LLMs to learn\nfrom initial responses and critique-guided self-refinements simultaneously\nwhile maintaining exploration. Additionally, we employ a shaping function to\namplify learning from correct, especially unfamiliar, refinements and penalize\nincorrect ones. Extensive experiments with Qwen2.5-7B-Base,\nQwen2.5-Math-7B-Base, and Qwen3-8B demonstrate that Critique-GRPO consistently\noutperforms supervised learning and RL-based fine-tuning methods across eight\nchallenging mathematical, STEM, and general reasoning tasks, improving average\npass@1 scores by approximately 4.4% and 3.8% on Qwen2.5-7B-Base and Qwen3-8B,\nrespectively. Notably, Critique-GRPO enables effective self-improvement through\nself-critiquing and weak-to-strong generalization, achieving consistent gains\nover GRPO, such as 16.7% and 10.0% pass@1 improvements on AIME 2024,\nrespectively.",

The robot is equipped with Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) sensors and\na direct push drill mechanism for deploying the sensor to measure volumetric\nwater content in the soil. Additionally, we implement and evaluate multiple\nadaptive sampling strategies based on a Gaussian Process based modeling to\nbuild a spatial mapping of moisture distribution in the soil. We present\nresults from large scale computational simulations and proof-of-concept\ndeployment on the field. The adaptive sampling approach outperforms a greedy\nbenchmark approach and results in up to 30\\% reduction in travel distance and\n5\\% reduction in variance in the reconstructed moisture maps.

However, since different apps may implement the same\nfunctionality in different ways, direct mapping may result in incomplete or\nbuggy test cases, thus significantly impacting the effectiveness of testing\ntarget functionality and the practical applicability of migration approaches.\n  In this paper, we propose a new migration paradigm (i.e., the\nabstraction-concretization paradigm) that first abstracts the test logic for\nthe target functionality and then utilizes this logic to generate the concrete\nGUI test case. Furthermore, we introduce MACdroid, the first approach that\nmigrates GUI test cases based on this paradigm. Specifically, we propose an\nabstraction technique that utilizes source test cases from source apps\ntargeting the same functionality to extract a general test logic for that\nfunctionality. Then, we propose a concretization technique that utilizes the\ngeneral test logic to guide an LLM in generating the corresponding GUI test\ncase (including events and assertions) for the target app. We evaluate MACdroid\non two widely-used datasets (including 31 apps, 34 functionalities, and 123\ntest cases). On the FrUITeR dataset, the test cases generated by MACdroid\nsuccessfully test 64% of the target functionalities, improving the baselines by\n191%.

Recent\nadvancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced ZCDSR\nby facilitating cross-domain knowledge transfer through rich, pretrained\nrepresentations. Despite this progress, domain semantic bias -- arising from\ndifferences in vocabulary and content focus between domains -- remains a\npersistent challenge, leading to misaligned item embeddings and reduced\ngeneralization across domains. To address this, we propose a novel semantic\nbias-aware framework that enhances LLM-based ZCDSR by improving cross-domain\nalignment at both the item and sequential levels. At the item level, we\nintroduce a generalization loss that aligns the embeddings of items across\ndomains (inter-domain compactness), while preserving the unique characteristics\nof each item within its own domain (intra-domain diversity). This ensures that\nitem embeddings can be transferred effectively between domains without\ncollapsing into overly generic or uniform representations. At the sequential\nlevel, we develop a method to transfer user behavioral patterns by clustering\nsource domain user sequences and applying attention-based aggregation during\ntarget domain inference. We dynamically adapt user embeddings to unseen\ndomains, enabling effective zero-shot recommendations without requiring\ntarget-domain interactions...",

                    "value": "Zero-shot cross-domain sequential recommendation (ZCDSR) enables predictions\nin unseen domains without additional training or fine-tuning, addressing the\nlimitations of traditional models in sparse data environments. Recent\nadvancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced ZCDSR\nby facilitating cross-domain knowledge transfer through rich, pretrained\nrepresentations. Despite this progress, domain semantic bias -- arising from\ndifferences in vocabulary and content focus between domains -- remains a\npersistent challenge, leading to misaligned item embeddings and reduced\ngeneralization across domains. To address this, we propose a novel semantic\nbias-aware framework that enhances LLM-based ZCDSR by improving cross-domain\nalignment at both the item and sequential levels. At the item level, we\nintroduce a generalization loss that aligns the embeddings of items across\ndomains (inter-domain compactness), while preserving the unique characteristics\nof each item within its own domain (intra-domain diversity). This ensures that\nitem embeddings can be transferred effectively between domains without\ncollapsing into overly generic or uniform representations. At the sequential\nlevel, we develop a method to transfer user behavioral patterns by clustering\nsource domain user sequences and applying attention-based aggregation during\ntarget domain inference. We dynamically adapt user embeddings to unseen\ndomains, enabling effective zero-shot recommendations without requiring\ntarget-domain interactions..."
