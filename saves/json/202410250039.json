The taxonomy for Edge AI facilitates the classification and\nconfiguration of Edge AI systems while examining its potential influence across\nmany fields through compassing infrastructure, cloud computing, fog computing,\nservices, use cases, ML and deep learning, and resource management. This study\nhighlights the significance of Edge AI in processing real-time data at the edge\nof the network. Additionally, it emphasizes the research challenges encountered\nby Edge AI systems, including constraints on resources, vulnerabilities to\nsecurity threats, and problems with scalability. Finally, this study highlights\nthe potential future research directions that aim to address the current\nlimitations of Edge AI by providing innovative solutions."

Yet, it is widely criticized that KV-Cache can become a\nbottleneck of the LLM inference system, especially when confronted with\nultra-large models and long-context queries. A natural remedy is to discard the\nKV-Cache for less important tokens, with StreamingLLM as an example, but the\nused static eviction strategies cannot flexibly adapt to varying contexts.\nRemedies like H2O leverage accumulative attention scores to perform dynamic\neviction but suffer from the attention bias issue in capturing contextual\ninformation. This paper bridges this gap by devising a parameterized KV-Cache\neviction mechanism, dubbed as Attention-Gate, which accepts the whole context\nas input and yields eviction flags for each token to realize in-context\neviction. The subsequent self-attention module proceeds according to the flags\nand only the KV states for the remaining tokens need to be cached. The\nAttention-Gates can vary among different heads and layers and be trivially\nplugged into pre-trained LLMs, tuned by cost-effective continual pre-training\nor supervised fine-tuning objectives to acquire what to discard. The\ncomputational and memory overhead introduced by Attention-Gates is minimal. Our\nmethod is validated across multiple tasks, demonstrating both efficiency and\nadaptability. After a highly efficient continual pre-training, it achieves\nhigher average accuracy and evicts more tokens compared to traditional\ntraining-free methods. In supervised fine-tuning, it not only evicts many\ntokens but also outperforms LoRA-finetuned LLMs on some datasets, such as RTE,\nwhere it improves accuracy by 13.9% while evicting 62.8% of tokens, showing\nthat effective eviction of redundant tokens can even enhance performance.",

However, the large memory overhead of the key-value (KV) cache poses\nsignificant challenges in long-context scenarios.

Other methods design new architectures with less KV\noverhead but require significant training overhead. To address the above two\ndrawbacks, we further explore the redundancy in the channel dimension and apply\nan architecture-level design with minor training costs. Therefore, we introduce\nCSKV, a training-efficient Channel Shrinking technique for KV cache\ncompression: (1) We first analyze the singular value distribution of the KV\ncache, revealing significant redundancy and compression potential along the\nchannel dimension. Based on this observation, we propose using low-rank\ndecomposition for key and value layers and storing the low-dimension features.\n(2) To preserve model performance, we introduce a bi-branch KV cache, including\na window-based full-precision KV cache and a low-precision compressed KV cache.\n(3) To reduce the training costs, we minimize the layer-wise reconstruction\nloss for the compressed KV cache instead of retraining the entire LLMs.\nExtensive experiments show that CSKV can reduce the memory overhead of the KV\ncache by 80% while maintaining the model's long-context capability.

Furthermore, online A/B testing\non a prominent search engine across 160+ countries shows significant\nimprovements in user engagement and revenue."

It is responsible for reading massive amounts of training\ndata, processing batches of samples using complex transformations, and loading\nthem onto training nodes at low latency and high throughput. Performant input\ndata systems are becoming increasingly critical, driven by skyrocketing data\nvolumes and training throughput demands. Unfortunately, current input data\nsystems cannot fully leverage key performance optimizations, resulting in\nhugely inefficient infrastructures that require significant resources - or\nworse - underutilize expensive accelerators.\n  To address these demands, we present cedar, an optimized and unified\nprogramming framework for ML input data pipelines. cedar allows users to define\ninput data pipelines using composable operators that support arbitrary ML\nframeworks and libraries. cedar introduces an extensible optimizer that\nsystematically applies a complex combination of optimizations (e.g.,\noffloading, caching, prefetching, fusion, and reordering). It orchestrates\nprocessing across a customizable set of local and distributed compute resources\nin order to improve processing performance and efficiency, all without user\ninput. Across eight pipelines, cedar improves performance by up to 1.87x to\n10.65x compared to state-of-the-art input data systems.",

It is responsible for reading massive amounts of training\ndata, processing batches of samples using complex transformations, and loading\nthem onto training nodes at low latency and high throughput. Performant input\ndata systems are becoming increasingly critical, driven by skyrocketing data\nvolumes and training throughput demands. Unfortunately, current input data\nsystems cannot fully leverage key performance optimizations, resulting in\nhugely inefficient infrastructures that require significant resources - or\nworse - underutilize expensive accelerators.\n  To address these demands, we present cedar, an optimized and unified\nprogramming framework for ML input data pipelines. cedar allows users to define\ninput data pipelines using composable operators that support arbitrary ML\nframeworks and libraries. cedar introduces an extensible optimizer that\nsystematically applies a complex combination of optimizations (e.g.,\noffloading, caching, prefetching, fusion, and reordering). It orchestrates\nprocessing across a customizable set of local and distributed compute resources\nin order to improve processing performance and efficiency, all without user\ninput. Across eight pipelines, cedar improves performance by up to 1.87x to\n10.65x compared to state-of-the-art input data systems."

However, prevalent quantization methods, such as 8-bit\nweight-activation or 4-bit weight-only quantization, achieve limited\nperformance improvements due to poor support for low-precision (e.g., 4-bit)\nactivation. This work, for the first time, realizes practical W4A4KV4 serving\nfor LLMs, fully utilizing the INT4 tensor cores on modern GPUs and reducing the\nmemory bottleneck caused by the KV cache.

Furthermore, attention sink is observed to emerge during the LM\npre-training, motivating us to investigate how optimization, data distribution,\nloss function, and model architecture in LM pre-training influence its\nemergence. We highlight that attention sink emerges after effective\noptimization on sufficient training data. The sink position is highly\ncorrelated with the loss function and data distribution. Most importantly, we\nfind that attention sink acts more like key biases, storing extra attention\nscores, which could be non-informative and not contribute to the value\ncomputation. We also observe that this phenomenon (at least partially) stems\nfrom tokens' inner dependence on attention scores as a result of softmax\nnormalization. After relaxing such dependence by replacing softmax attention\nwith other attention operations, such as sigmoid attention without\nnormalization, attention sinks do not emerge in LMs up to 1B parameters.

In this paper, we\nintroduce token-wise feature caching, allowing us to adaptively select the most\nsuitable tokens for caching, and further enable us to apply different caching\nratios to neural layers in different types and depths. Extensive experiments on\nPixArt-$\\alpha$, OpenSora, and DiT demonstrate our effectiveness in both image\nand video generation with no requirements for training. For instance,\n2.36$\\times$ and 1.93$\\times$ acceleration are achieved on OpenSora and\nPixArt-$\\alpha$ with almost no drop in generation quality."

We identify the cause of these issues as the bias and high variance\npresent in the gradient estimates of the existing residual-based objective\nfunction. To address this, we introduce a new objective function that maintains\nthe same global optimum as before but allows for unbiased and low-variance\ngradient estimates, enabling faster and more accurate training of neural\nnetworks.

However, most studies focus on addressing only one of these\nbottlenecks and do not adequately support dynamic adjustment of sparsity\nconcerning distinct layers or tasks. In this paper, we present ZipVL, an\nefficient inference framework designed for LVLMs that resolves both computation\nand memory bottlenecks through a dynamic ratio allocation strategy of important\ntokens. This ratio is adaptively determined based on the layer-specific\ndistribution of attention scores, rather than fixed hyper-parameters, thereby\nimproving efficiency for less complex tasks while maintaining high performance\nfor more challenging ones. Then we select important tokens based on their\nnormalized attention scores and perform attention mechanism solely on those\nimportant tokens to accelerate the prefill phase. To mitigate the memory\nbottleneck in the decoding phase, we employ mixed-precision quantization to the\nKV cache, where high-bit quantization is used for caches of important tokens,\nwhile low-bit quantization is applied to those of less importance. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that ZipVL can accelerate the prefill phase by\n2.6$\\times$ and reduce GPU memory usage by 50.0%, with a minimal accuracy\nreduction of only 0.2% on Video-MME benchmark over LongVA-7B model, effectively\nenhancing the generation efficiency of LVLMs.",

To achieve this, our method introduces the\nfollowing technical designs. 1) We directly compress the activations (i.e. keys\nand values at every layer), rather than leveraging soft prompts to relay\ninformation (which constitute a major bottleneck to encapsulate the complex\ninformation within long contexts). 2) We tailor the compression workflow, where\neach fine-grained input unit is progressively compressed, enabling high-quality\ncompression and efficient computation during both training and inference. 3) We\ntrain the model through compression-based auto-regression, making full use of\nplain texts and instructional data to optimize the model's compression\nperformance. 4) During training, we randomly sample a compression ratio at each\nstep, teaching the model to support a wide range of compression configurations.\nExtensive evaluations are conducted on various long-context tasks whose lengths\n(e.g., 128K) may far exceed the maximum training length (20K), such as document\nunderstanding, few-shot learning, and Needle-in-a-Haystack. Whilst existing\nmethods struggle to handle these challenging tasks, Activation Beacon maintains\na comparable performance to the uncompressed baseline across various scenarios,\nachieving a 2x acceleration in inference time and an 8x reduction of memory\ncosts for KV cache.

Probabilistic voxel mapping requires storing past point clouds and\nre-iterating on them to update the uncertainty every iteration, which consumes\nlarge memory space and CPU cycles. To solve this problem, we propose a\ntwo-folded strategy. First, we introduce a compact point-free representation\nfor probabilistic voxels and derive a cumulative update of the planar\nuncertainty without caching original point clouds. Our voxel structure only\nkeeps track of a predetermined set of statistics for points that lie inside it.\nThis method reduces the runtime complexity from $O(MN)$ to $O(N)$ and the space\ncomplexity from $O(N)$ to $O(1)$ where $M$ is the number of iterations and $N$\nis the number of points. Second, to further minimize memory usage and enhance\nmapping accuracy, we provide a strategy to dynamically merge voxels associated\nwith the same physical planes by taking advantage of the geometric features in\nthe real world. Rather than scanning for these coalescible voxels constantly at\nevery iteration, our merging strategy accumulates voxels in a\nlocality-sensitive hash and triggers merging lazily. On-demand merging not only\nreduces memory footprint with minimal computational overhead but also improves\nlocalization accuracy thanks to cross-voxel denoising.

                    "value": "This work presents a compact, cumulative and coalescible probabilistic voxel\nmapping method to enhance performance, accuracy and memory efficiency in LiDAR\nodometry. Probabilistic voxel mapping requires storing past point clouds and\nre-iterating on them to update the uncertainty every iteration, which consumes\nlarge memory space and CPU cycles. To solve this problem, we propose a\ntwo-folded strategy. First, we introduce a compact point-free representation\nfor probabilistic voxels and derive a cumulative update of the planar\nuncertainty without caching original point clouds. Our voxel structure only\nkeeps track of a predetermined set of statistics for points that lie inside it.\nThis method reduces the runtime complexity from $O(MN)$ to $O(N)$ and the space\ncomplexity from $O(N)$ to $O(1)$ where $M$ is the number of iterations and $N$\nis the number of points. Second, to further minimize memory usage and enhance\nmapping accuracy, we provide a strategy to dynamically merge voxels associated\nwith the same physical planes by taking advantage of the geometric features in\nthe real world. Rather than scanning for these coalescible voxels constantly at\nevery iteration, our merging strategy accumulates voxels in a\nlocality-sensitive hash and triggers merging lazily. On-demand merging not only\nreduces memory footprint with minimal computational overhead but also improves\nlocalization accuracy thanks to cross-voxel denoising. Experiments exhibit 20%\nhigher accuracy, 20% faster performance and 70% lower memory consumption than\nthe state-of-the-art."

Tackling this challenge, as\ndefined, relies on a bi-level optimization algorithm: a novel model is trained\nin each iteration within a nested loop, with gradients propagated through an\nunrolled computation graph. However, this approach incurs high memory and time\ncomplexity, posing difficulties in scaling up to large datasets such as\nImageNet. Addressing these concerns, this paper introduces Teddy, a\nTaylor-approximated dataset distillation framework designed to handle\nlarge-scale dataset and enhance efficiency. On the one hand, backed up by\ntheoretical analysis, we propose a memory-efficient approximation derived from\nTaylor expansion, which transforms the original form dependent on multi-step\ngradients to a first-order one.

Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed\nTeddy attains state-of-the-art efficiency and performance on the Tiny-ImageNet\nand original-sized ImageNet-1K dataset, notably surpassing prior methods by up\nto 12.8%, while reducing 46.6% runtime.

However, existing Edge Computing (EC)\nsimulators, as well as general-purpose vehicular network simulators, are not\ntailored for VEC and lack dedicated support for modeling the distinct access\npattern, entity mobility trajectory and other unique characteristics of VEC\nnetworks. To fill this gap, this paper proposes VEC-Sim, a versatile simulation\nplatform for in-depth evaluation and analysis of various service caching and\ncomputation offloading policies in VEC networks. VEC-Sim incorporates realistic\nmechanisms to replicate real-world access patterns, including service feature\nvector, vehicle mobility modeling, evolving service popularity, new service\nupload and user preference shifts, etc. Moreover, its modular architecture and\nextensive Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) allow seamless integration\nof customized scheduling policies and user-defined metrics. A comprehensive\nevaluation of VEC-Sim's capabilities is undertaken in comparison to real-world\nground truths.

                    "value": "Computer simulation platforms offer an alternative solution by emulating\ncomplex systems in a controlled manner. However, existing Edge Computing (EC)\nsimulators, as well as general-purpose vehicular network simulators, are not\ntailored for VEC and lack dedicated support for modeling the distinct access\npattern, entity mobility trajectory and other unique characteristics of VEC\nnetworks. To fill this gap, this paper proposes VEC-Sim, a versatile simulation\nplatform for in-depth evaluation and analysis of various service caching and\ncomputation offloading policies in VEC networks. VEC-Sim incorporates realistic\nmechanisms to replicate real-world access patterns, including service feature\nvector, vehicle mobility modeling, evolving service popularity, new service\nupload and user preference shifts, etc. Moreover, its modular architecture and\nextensive Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) allow seamless integration\nof customized scheduling policies and user-defined metrics. A comprehensive\nevaluation of VEC-Sim's capabilities is undertaken in comparison to real-world\nground truths. Results prove it to be accurate in reproducing classical\nscheduling algorithms and extremely effective in conducting case studies."

To fully utilize the DPU memory bandwidth, we further\nstudied the embedding table partitioning problem to achieve good\nworkload-balance and efficient data caching.

By distributing\nstates across nodes and enabling efficient data retrieval through a\nKademlia-inspired routing protocol, we reduce storage costs for validators.\nCryptographic proofs (such as Merkle proofs) are used to allow nodes to verify\ndata stored by other nodes without having to trust those nodes directly. While\nthe protocol trades off data storage for increased network bandwidth, we show\nhow gossiping and caching can minimize the increased bandwidth needs.\n  To validate our state sharing protocol, we conduct an extensive quantitative\nanalysis of Ethereum's data storage and data access patterns.

                "summary": "Because it is difficult to precisely specify complex objectives,\nreinforcement learning policies are often optimized using flawed proxy rewards\nthat seem to capture the true objective. However, optimizing proxy rewards\nfrequently leads to reward hacking: the optimized reward function ceases to be\na good proxy, and the resulting policy performs poorly with respect to the\nunspecified true reward. Principled solutions to reward hacking have been\nimpeded by the lack of a good definition for the problem. To address this, we\nintroduce a definition of reward hacking based on the correlation between proxy\nand true rewards for states and actions seen by a \"base policy\" that breaks\ndown under optimization. We show that this definition captures reward hacking\nbehavior across several realistic settings, including in reinforcement learning\nfrom human feedback (RLHF).

                    "value": "Because it is difficult to precisely specify complex objectives,\nreinforcement learning policies are often optimized using flawed proxy rewards\nthat seem to capture the true objective. However, optimizing proxy rewards\nfrequently leads to reward hacking: the optimized reward function ceases to be\na good proxy, and the resulting policy performs poorly with respect to the\nunspecified true reward. Principled solutions to reward hacking have been\nimpeded by the lack of a good definition for the problem. To address this, we\nintroduce a definition of reward hacking based on the correlation between proxy\nand true rewards for states and actions seen by a \"base policy\" that breaks\ndown under optimization. We show that this definition captures reward hacking\nbehavior across several realistic settings, including in reinforcement learning\nfrom human feedback (RLHF). We then show theoretically that regularization to\nthe base policy can effectively prevent reward hacking.

We design LongRAG as a plug-and-play paradigm,\nfacilitating adaptation to various domains and LLMs. Extensive experiments on\nthree multi-hop datasets demonstrate that LongRAG significantly outperforms\nlong-context LLMs (up by 6.94%), advanced RAG (up by 6.16%), and Vanilla RAG\n(up by 17.25%). Furthermore, we conduct quantitative ablation studies and\nmulti-dimensional analyses, highlighting the effectiveness of the system's\ncomponents and fine-tuning strategies. Data and code are available at\nhttps://github.com/QingFei1/LongRAG."

We also\ndiscuss the challenges and future opportunities in employing LLMs for feature\nselection, offering insights for further research and development in this\nemerging field."

However, patient data privacy\noften restricts the availability of old data when updating the model,\nnecessitating an exemplar-free continual learning (CL) setup. Prior CL studies\noverlooked two vital problems in the surgical domain: 1) large domain shifts\nfrom diverse surgical operations collected from multiple sources, and 2) severe\ndata imbalance arising from the uneven presence of surgical instruments or\nactivities. This paper proposes addressing these problems with a multimodal\nlarge language model (LLM) and an adaptive weight assignment methodology. We\nfirst develop a new multi-teacher CL framework that leverages a multimodal LLM\nas the additional teacher. The strong generalization ability of the LLM can\nbridge the knowledge gap when domain shifts and data imbalances occur. We then\nput forth a novel data processing method that transforms complex LLM embeddings\ninto logits compatible with our CL framework. We further design an adaptive\nweight assignment approach that balances the generalization ability of the LLM\nand the domain expertise of the old CL model. Finally, to comprehensively test\nthe effectiveness of our proposed method, we have also constructed two new\nsurgical VQA datasets that are largely different from existing ones and could\nbe valuable resources for future research. Extensive experimental results on\nthe tested datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method to other advanced\nCL schemes.",

We show that\nthe CAE-ESN model infers the invariant stability properties and the geometry of\nthe tangent space in the low-dimensional manifold (i.e. the latent space)\nthrough Lyapunov exponents and covariant Lyapunov vectors. This work opens up\nnew opportunities for inferring the stability of high-dimensional chaotic\nsystems in latent spaces."

We\nobserve the embedding table contributes to the major storage bottleneck for\ntiny BERT models. Hence, at the network level, we propose an MCU-aware\ntwo-stage neural architecture search algorithm based on clustered low-rank\napproximation for embedding compression. To reduce the inference memory\nrequirements, we further propose a novel fine-grained MCU-friendly scheduling\nstrategy. Through careful computation tiling and re-ordering as well as kernel\ndesign, we drastically increase the input sequence lengths supported on MCUs\nwithout any latency or accuracy penalty. MCUBERT reduces the parameter size of\nBERT-tiny and BERT-mini by 5.7$\\times$ and 3.0$\\times$ and the execution memory\nby 3.5$\\times$ and 4.3$\\times$, respectively.

We\nobserve the embedding table contributes to the major storage bottleneck for\ntiny BERT models. Hence, at the network level, we propose an MCU-aware\ntwo-stage neural architecture search algorithm based on clustered low-rank\napproximation for embedding compression. To reduce the inference memory\nrequirements, we further propose a novel fine-grained MCU-friendly scheduling\nstrategy. Through careful computation tiling and re-ordering as well as kernel\ndesign, we drastically increase the input sequence lengths supported on MCUs\nwithout any latency or accuracy penalty. MCUBERT reduces the parameter size of\nBERT-tiny and BERT-mini by 5.7$\\times$ and 3.0$\\times$ and the execution memory\nby 3.5$\\times$ and 4.3$\\times$, respectively. MCUBERT also achieves 1.5$\\times$\nlatency reduction.

However, current soft-prompt-based methods often sacrifice multi-task\nmodularity, requiring the training process to be fully or partially repeated\nfor each newly added task. While recent work on task vectors applied arithmetic\noperations on full model weights to achieve the desired multi-task performance,\na similar approach for soft-prompts is still missing. To this end, we introduce\nTask Prompt Vectors, created by element-wise difference between weights of\ntuned soft-prompts and their random initialization. Experimental results on 12\nNLU datasets show that task prompt vectors can be used in low-resource settings\nto effectively initialize prompt tuning on similar tasks. In addition, we show\nthat task prompt vectors are independent of the random initialization of prompt\ntuning on 2 different language model architectures. This allows prompt\narithmetics with the pre-trained vectors from different tasks. In this way, we\nprovide a competitive alternative to state-of-the-art baselines by arithmetic\naddition of task prompt vectors from multiple tasks.",

                "summary": "Dropout often threatens the validity of causal inference in longitudinal\nstudies. While existing studies have focused on the problem of missing outcomes\ncaused by treatment, we study an important but overlooked source of dropout,\nselective eligibility. For example, patients may become ineligible for\nsubsequent treatments due to severe side effects or complete recovery.\nSelective eligibility differs from the problem of ``truncation by death''\nbecause dropout occurs after observing the outcome but before receiving the\nsubsequent treatment. This difference makes the standard approach to dropout\ninapplicable. We propose a general methodological framework for longitudinal\ncausal inference with selective eligibility. By focusing on subgroups of units\nwho would become eligible for treatment given a specific treatment history, we\ndefine the time-specific eligible treatment effect (ETE) and expected number of\noutcome events (EOE) under a treatment sequence of interest.

                    "value": "Dropout often threatens the validity of causal inference in longitudinal\nstudies. While existing studies have focused on the problem of missing outcomes\ncaused by treatment, we study an important but overlooked source of dropout,\nselective eligibility. For example, patients may become ineligible for\nsubsequent treatments due to severe side effects or complete recovery.\nSelective eligibility differs from the problem of ``truncation by death''\nbecause dropout occurs after observing the outcome but before receiving the\nsubsequent treatment. This difference makes the standard approach to dropout\ninapplicable. We propose a general methodological framework for longitudinal\ncausal inference with selective eligibility. By focusing on subgroups of units\nwho would become eligible for treatment given a specific treatment history, we\ndefine the time-specific eligible treatment effect (ETE) and expected number of\noutcome events (EOE) under a treatment sequence of interest.

With its\nhigh mass, young age, and location in the Galaxy's most extreme star forming\nenvironment, the Arches is an extraordinary laboratory to study massive stars\nand clusters. Our objective is to improve our knowledge of the properties of\nmassive stars and the Arches cluster through high angular resolution radio\ncontinuum studies. We observed the Arches cluster with the Karl G. Jansky Very\nLarge Array in the C- and X-bands throughout 2016, 2018, and 2022. We used the\nA-configuration to achieve the highest possible angular resolution and\ncross-matched the detected point sources with stars detected in the infrared,\nusing proper motion catalogues to ensure cluster membership. We report the most\nextensive radio point source catalogue of the cluster to date, with a total of\n25 radio detections. We also created the deepest radio images of the cluster so\nfar. Most of our stellar radio sources (12/18) show a positive spectral index,\nindicating that the dominant emission process is free-free thermal radiation,\nwhich probably originates from stellar winds. We found that radio variability\nis more frequent than what was inferred from previous observations, affecting\nup to 60% of the sources associated with bright stellar counterparts. We\npropose four of our detections (F6, F18, F19 and F26) as primary candidates for\ncolliding-wind binaries based on their consistent flat-to-negative spectral\nindex. We classify F7, F9, F12, F14, and F55 as secondary colliding wind binary\ncandidates based on their high flux and/or spectral index variability, and\nX-ray counterparts.

It proposes three techniques for point cloud\nacceleration. First, Pointer adopts ReRAM-based architecture to significantly\naccelerate the MLP in feature computation. Second, to reduce DRAM access,\nPointer proposes inter-layer coordination.

We also determine that the MOND\nhypothesis's acceleration parameter $a_0$ is $(1.26 \\pm 0.13) \\times 10^{-10}$\nm s$^{-2}$ for simple interpolating function. The average of bayes factor for\nall tracers between the two hypotheses is $\\log \\textrm{BF}\\sim 0.1$, meaning\nno strong evidence in favour of either the dark matter or MOND hypotheses."

Naija is a\nNigerian-Pidgin spoken by approx. 120M speakers in Nigeria and it is a mixed\nlanguage (e.g., English, Portuguese, Yoruba, Hausa and Igbo). Although it has\nmainly been a spoken language until recently, there are now various platforms\npublishing exclusively in Naija such as Naija Wikipedia. However, it is hard to\ndistinguish by non-native from a larger pidgin languages spoken across West\nAfrica known as West African Pidgin English (WAPE) -- which is more simplied\nand understandable by wider audience in Ghana, Nigeria, and Cameroon. BBC news\nplatform publishes exclusively in WAPE to cater for several countries in West\nAfrica. In our paper, we show through statistical analyses and Machine\nTranslation experiments that these two creole varieties do not represent each\nother (i.e., there are linguistic differences in word order and vocabulary) and\nGenerative AI operates only based on WAPE. In other words, Naija is\nunder-represented in Generative AI, and it is hard to teach LLMs with few\nexamples.",

Naija is a\nNigerian-Pidgin spoken by approx. 120M speakers in Nigeria and it is a mixed\nlanguage (e.g., English, Portuguese, Yoruba, Hausa and Igbo). Although it has\nmainly been a spoken language until recently, there are now various platforms\npublishing exclusively in Naija such as Naija Wikipedia. However, it is hard to\ndistinguish by non-native from a larger pidgin languages spoken across West\nAfrica known as West African Pidgin English (WAPE) -- which is more simplied\nand understandable by wider audience in Ghana, Nigeria, and Cameroon. BBC news\nplatform publishes exclusively in WAPE to cater for several countries in West\nAfrica. In our paper, we show through statistical analyses and Machine\nTranslation experiments that these two creole varieties do not represent each\nother (i.e., there are linguistic differences in word order and vocabulary) and\nGenerative AI operates only based on WAPE. In other words, Naija is\nunder-represented in Generative AI, and it is hard to teach LLMs with few\nexamples."

We then systematically compare these\ncatalogs with an existing catalog which utilized a traditional workflow.\nResults indicate that the Pickblue-based catalog documents more events and/or\nprovides better-constrained locations than the other catalogs. The different\nperformances of the three phase pickers suggest that detailed assessment of\ncatalogs built using automatic workflows is necessary to prevent\nmisinterpretations, especially when applied to regions without training\nsamples. The Pickblue-based catalog reveals seismicity gaps in three\nextensional segments of BTF which likely represent aseismic slip zones affected\nby seawater infiltration. Furthermore, most earthquakes are shallower than the\n600-degree isotherm predicted by a half-space conductive cooling model, except\nfor the Blanco Ridge segment which has hosted 80% of the Mw > 6.0 earthquakes\nalong BTF since 1976. These Blanco Ridge deep earthquake clusters can be\nexplained by hydrothermal cooling or the serpentinization of mantle peridotite\ndue to seawater infiltration along conduits created by the deeper ruptures of\nlarge earthquakes.

However, patient data privacy\noften restricts the availability of old data when updating the model,\nnecessitating an exemplar-free continual learning (CL) setup. Prior CL studies\noverlooked two vital problems in the surgical domain: 1) large domain shifts\nfrom diverse surgical operations collected from multiple sources, and 2) severe\ndata imbalance arising from the uneven presence of surgical instruments or\nactivities. This paper proposes addressing these problems with a multimodal\nlarge language model (LLM) and an adaptive weight assignment methodology. We\nfirst develop a new multi-teacher CL framework that leverages a multimodal LLM\nas the additional teacher. The strong generalization ability of the LLM can\nbridge the knowledge gap when domain shifts and data imbalances occur. We then\nput forth a novel data processing method that transforms complex LLM embeddings\ninto logits compatible with our CL framework. We further design an adaptive\nweight assignment approach that balances the generalization ability of the LLM\nand the domain expertise of the old CL model. Finally, to comprehensively test\nthe effectiveness of our proposed method, we have also constructed two new\nsurgical VQA datasets that are largely different from existing ones and could\nbe valuable resources for future research. Extensive experimental results on\nthe tested datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method to other advanced\nCL schemes.",

Our method first\nfine-tunes the LLM on instruction-following, question-answering, and\nsearch-related data. Then, it prompts the same LLM to generate diverse\ndomain-relevant questions from unlabeled corpora, with an additional filtering\nstrategy to retain high-quality synthetic examples. By leveraging these\nsynthetic examples, the LLM can improve their performance on domain-specific\nRAG tasks.

Inspired by dual-process cognitive\ntheory, we propose a unified framework in this paper, termed Fast and Slow\nGenerating (FS-GEN).

Using TRAIT, we reveal two notable insights into\npersonalities of LLMs: 1) LLMs exhibit distinct and consistent personality,\nwhich is highly influenced by their training data (e.g., data used for\nalignment tuning), and 2) current prompting techniques have limited\neffectiveness in eliciting certain traits, such as high psychopathy or low\nconscientiousness, suggesting the need for further research in this direction."

Additionally, by leveraging QLoRA and\nLoRA for pretraining and fine-tuning, we introduce GeoCode-GPT-7B, the first\nLLM focused on geospatial code generation, fine-tuned from Code Llama-7B.\nFurthermore, we establish a comprehensive geospatial code evaluation framework,\nincorporating option matching, expert validation, and prompt engineering\nscoring for LLMs, and systematically evaluate GeoCode-GPT-7B using the\nGeoCode-Eval dataset. Experimental results show that GeoCode-GPT outperforms\nother models in multiple-choice accuracy by 9.1% to 32.1%, in code\nsummarization ability by 1.7% to 25.4%, and in code generation capability by\n1.2% to 25.1%. This paper provides a solution and empirical validation for\nenhancing LLMs' performance in geospatial code generation, extends the\nboundaries of domain-specific model applications, and offers valuable insights\ninto unlocking their potential in geospatial code generation.",

However,\nbuilding VL models requires substantial hardware resources, where efficiency is\nrestricted by two key factors: the extended input sequence of the language\nmodel with vision features demands more computational operations, and a large\nnumber of additional learnable parameters increase memory complexity. These\nchallenges significantly restrict the broader applicability of such models. To\nbridge this gap, we propose ADEM-VL, an efficient vision-language method that\ntunes VL models based on pretrained large language models (LLMs) by adopting a\nparameter-free cross-attention mechanism for similarity measurements in\nmultimodal fusion. This approach only requires embedding vision features into\nthe language space, significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters\nand accelerating both training and inference speeds. To enhance representation\nlearning in fusion module, we introduce an efficient multiscale feature\ngeneration scheme that requires only a single forward pass through the vision\nencoder. Moreover, we propose an adaptive fusion scheme that dynamically\ndiscards less relevant visual information for each text token based on its\nattention score. This ensures that the fusion process prioritizes the most\npertinent visual features.

While randomly initialized weights perfectly agree\nwith RMT predictions, deviations emerge after training, allowing us to locate\nlearned structures within the models. We identify layer-type specific behaviors\nthat are consistent across all blocks and architectures considered. By\npinpointing regions that deviate from RMT predictions, we highlight areas of\nfeature learning and confirm this through comparisons with the activation\ncovariance matrices of the corresponding layers. Our method provides a\ndiagnostic tool for identifying relevant regions in transformer weights using\nonly the trained matrices. Additionally, we address the ongoing debate\nregarding the significance of small singular values in the context of\nfine-tuning and alignment in LLMs. Our findings reveal that, after fine-tuning,\nsmall singular values play a crucial role in the models' capabilities,\nsuggesting that removing them in an already aligned transformer can be\ndetrimental, as it may compromise model alignment.",

To address this,\nwe propose the first double identity protection scheme based on traceable\nadversarial watermarking, termed DIP-Watermark. DIP-Watermark employs a\none-time watermark embedding to deceive unauthorized FR models and allows\nauthorizers to perform identity verification by extracting the watermark.\nSpecifically, we propose an information-guided adversarial attack against FR\nmodels. The encoder embeds an identity-specific watermark into the deep feature\nspace of the carrier, guiding recognizable features of the image to deviate\nfrom the source identity. We further adopt a collaborative meta-optimization\nstrategy compatible with sub-tasks, which regularizes the joint optimization\ndirection of the encoder and decoder. This strategy enhances the representation\nof universal carrier features, mitigating multi-objective optimization\nconflicts in watermarking. Experiments confirm that DIP-Watermark achieves\nsignificant attack success rates and traceability accuracy on state-of-the-art\nFR models, exhibiting remarkable robustness that outperforms the existing\nprivacy protection methods using adversarial attacks and deep watermarking, or\nsimple combinations of the two.

We then propose a\nsupervised approach that leverages labeled datasets to estimate the uncertainty\nin LLMs' responses. Based on the formulation, we illustrate the difference\nbetween the uncertainty estimation for LLMs and that for standard ML models and\nexplain why the hidden neurons of the LLMs may contain uncertainty information.\nOur designed approach demonstrates the benefits of utilizing hidden activations\nto enhance uncertainty estimation across various tasks and shows robust\ntransferability in out-of-distribution settings. We distinguish the uncertainty\nestimation task from the uncertainty calibration task and show that better\nuncertainty estimation leads to better calibration performance. Furthermore,\nour method is easy to implement and adaptable to different levels of model\naccessibility including black box, grey box, and white box.",

                    "value": "In this paper, we study the problem of uncertainty estimation and calibration\nfor LLMs. We begin by formulating the uncertainty estimation problem, a\nrelevant yet underexplored area in existing literature. We then propose a\nsupervised approach that leverages labeled datasets to estimate the uncertainty\nin LLMs' responses. Based on the formulation, we illustrate the difference\nbetween the uncertainty estimation for LLMs and that for standard ML models and\nexplain why the hidden neurons of the LLMs may contain uncertainty information.\nOur designed approach demonstrates the benefits of utilizing hidden activations\nto enhance uncertainty estimation across various tasks and shows robust\ntransferability in out-of-distribution settings. We distinguish the uncertainty\nestimation task from the uncertainty calibration task and show that better\nuncertainty estimation leads to better calibration performance. Furthermore,\nour method is easy to implement and adaptable to different levels of model\naccessibility including black box, grey box, and white box."

They are significantly better at detecting\nvulnerabilities only requiring intra-procedural analysis, such as OS Command\nInjection and NULL Pointer Dereference.

Interestingly, we observe that LLMs show\npromising abilities at performing parts of the analysis correctly, such as\nidentifying vulnerability-related specifications and leveraging natural\nlanguage information to understand code behavior (e.g., to check if code is\nsanitized).

Interestingly, we observe that LLMs show\npromising abilities at performing parts of the analysis correctly, such as\nidentifying vulnerability-related specifications and leveraging natural\nlanguage information to understand code behavior (e.g., to check if code is\nsanitized). We expect our insights to guide future work on LLM-augmented\nvulnerability detection systems."

We find that small models like GPT-2 can be\neffective for initialization and distillation, highlighting their potential in\nenabling scalable and efficient deployment of privacy-preserving language."

However, during the\ndevelopment and deployment of FedGL models, they are susceptible to illegal\ncopying and model theft. Backdoor-based watermarking is a well-known method for\nmitigating these attacks, as it offers ownership verification to the model\nowner. We take the first step to protect the ownership of FedGL models via\nbackdoor-based watermarking.

To address all the challenges, we propose FedGMark,\nthe first certified robust backdoor-based watermarking for FedGL. FedGMark\nleverages the unique graph structure and client information in FedGL to learn\ncustomized and diverse watermarks. It also designs a novel GL architecture that\nfacilitates defending against both the empirical and theoretically worst-case\nwatermark removal attacks.

To address this gap,\nwe introduce the Long Text Fairness Test (LTF-TEST), a framework that evaluates\nbiases in LLMs through essay-style prompts. LTF-TEST covers 14 topics and 10\ndemographic axes, including gender and race, resulting in 11,948 samples. By\nassessing both model responses and the reasoning behind them, LTF-TEST uncovers\nsubtle biases that are difficult to detect in simple responses. In our\nevaluation of five recent LLMs, including GPT-4o and LLaMa3, we identify two\nkey patterns of bias. First, these models frequently favor certain demographic\ngroups in their responses. Second, they show excessive sensitivity toward\ntraditionally disadvantaged groups, often providing overly protective responses\nwhile neglecting others. To mitigate these biases, we propose FT-REGARD, a\nfinetuning approach that pairs biased prompts with neutral responses. FT-REGARD\nreduces gender bias by 34.6% and improves performance by 1.4 percentage points\non the BBQ benchmark, offering a promising approach to addressing biases in\nlong-text generation tasks.",
