Both models\nare trained on large-scale multilingual and multimodal datasets sourced via\nresponsible web crawling, licensed corpora, and high-quality synthetic data,\nthen further refined with supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning on\na new asynchronous platform. The resulting models support several additional\nlanguages while understanding images and executing tool calls. In public\nbenchmarks and human evaluations, both the server model and the on-device model\nmatch or surpass comparably sized open baselines.\n  A new Swift-centric Foundation Models framework exposes guided generation,\nconstrained tool calling, and LoRA adapter fine-tuning, allowing developers to\nintegrate these capabilities with a few lines of code. The latest advancements\nin Apple Intelligence models are grounded in our Responsible AI approach with\nsafeguards like content filtering and locale-specific evaluation, as well as\nour commitment to protecting our users' privacy with innovations like Private\nCloud Compute.",

This heterogeneity introduces challenges, as these accelerators and\nDMA-capable devices act as independent bus masters, directly accessing memory.\nConsequently, ensuring both security and timing predictability in such\nenvironments becomes critical. To address these concerns, the Input-Output\nMemory Management Unit (IOMMU) plays a key role in mediating and regulating\nmemory access, preventing unauthorized transactions while enforcing isolation\nand access control policies. While prior work has explored IOMMU-related\nside-channel vulnerabilities from a security standpoint, its role in\nperformance interference remains largely unexplored. Moreover, many of the same\narchitectural properties that enable side-channel leakage, such as shared TLBs,\ncaching effects, and translation overheads, can also introduce timing\nunpredictability. In this work, we analyze the contention effects within IOMMU\nstructures using the Xilinx UltraScale+ ZCU104 platform, demonstrating how\ntheir shared nature introduce unpredictable delays. Our findings reveal that\nIOMMU-induced interference primarily affects small memory transactions, where\ntranslation overheads significantly impact execution time. Additionally, we\nhypothesize that contention effects arising from IOTLBs exhibit similar\nbehavior across architectures due to shared caching principles, such as\nprefetching and hierarchical TLB structures.

                "summary": "The scarcity of manipulation data has motivated the use of pretrained large\nmodels from other modalities in robotics. In this work, we build upon\nautoregressive video generation models to propose a Physical Autoregressive\nModel (PAR), where physical tokens combine frames and actions to represent the\njoint evolution of the robot and its environment. PAR leverages the world\nknowledge embedded in video pretraining to understand physical dynamics without\nrequiring action pretraining, enabling accurate video prediction and consistent\naction trajectories. It also adopts a DiT-based de-tokenizer to model frames\nand actions as continuous tokens, mitigating quantization errors and\nfacilitating mutual enhancement. Furthermore, we incorporate a causal mask with\ninverse kinematics, parallel training, and the KV-cache mechanism to further\nimprove performance and efficiency. Experiments on the ManiSkill benchmark show\nthat PAR achieves a 100\\% success rate on the PushCube task, matches the\nperformance of action-pretrained baselines on other tasks, and accurately\npredicts future videos with tightly aligned action trajectories.

                    "value": "The scarcity of manipulation data has motivated the use of pretrained large\nmodels from other modalities in robotics. In this work, we build upon\nautoregressive video generation models to propose a Physical Autoregressive\nModel (PAR), where physical tokens combine frames and actions to represent the\njoint evolution of the robot and its environment. PAR leverages the world\nknowledge embedded in video pretraining to understand physical dynamics without\nrequiring action pretraining, enabling accurate video prediction and consistent\naction trajectories. It also adopts a DiT-based de-tokenizer to model frames\nand actions as continuous tokens, mitigating quantization errors and\nfacilitating mutual enhancement. Furthermore, we incorporate a causal mask with\ninverse kinematics, parallel training, and the KV-cache mechanism to further\nimprove performance and efficiency. Experiments on the ManiSkill benchmark show\nthat PAR achieves a 100\\% success rate on the PushCube task, matches the\nperformance of action-pretrained baselines on other tasks, and accurately\npredicts future videos with tightly aligned action trajectories. These findings\nunderscore a promising direction for robotic manipulation by transferring world\nknowledge from autoregressive video pretraining.

Krul dynamically selects compression strategies\nbased on attention similarity across layer pairs and uses a\nrecomputation-loading pipeline to restore the KV cache.

We crucially identify the MTJ routing struggle in\nconventional two-transistor one-resistor (2T1R) SOT-MRAMs as the primary\nbitcell area scaling challenge and propose to use BEOL read selectors (BEOL\nRSs) that enable (10 -- 40) % bitcell area reduction and eventually match\nsub-N3 SRAM.

To\nmitigate these issues, we introduce a novel context compression pipeline,\ncalled Intermediate Layer Retrieval (ILRe), which determines one intermediate\ndecoder layer offline, encodes context by streaming chunked prefill only up to\nthat layer, and recalls tokens by the attention scores between the input query\nand full key cache in that specified layer. In particular, we propose a\nmulti-pooling kernels allocating strategy in the token recalling process to\nmaintain the completeness of semantics. Our approach not only reduces the\nprefilling complexity from $O(L^2)$ to $O(L)$, but also achieves performance\ncomparable to or better than the full context in the long context scenarios.\nWithout additional post training or operator development, ILRe can process a\nsingle $1M$ tokens request in less than half a minute (speedup $\\approx\n180\\times$) and scores RULER-$1M$ benchmark of $\\approx 79.8$ with model\nLlama-3.1-UltraLong-8B-1M-Instruct on a Huawei Ascend 910B NPU.",

Our evaluation includes comparative analysis of end-to-end\nmodel latency and specific attention latency in each model.

PRISM scales down to tiny\ncontexts without increasing costs or sacrificing quality, and generalizes to\nnew tasks with minimal effort by generating schemas from task descriptions."

These\nstudies seek to answer two fundamental questions: \"When to cache\" and \"How to\nuse cache\", typically relying on predefined empirical laws or dataset-level\npriors to determine the timing of caching and utilizing handcrafted rules for\nleveraging multi-step caches. However, given the highly dynamic nature of the\ndiffusion process, they often exhibit limited generalizability and fail on\noutlier samples. In this paper, a strong correlation is revealed between the\nvariation patterns of the shallow-layer feature differences in the diffusion\nmodel and those of final model outputs. Moreover, we have observed that the\nfeatures from different model layers form similar trajectories. Based on these\nobservations, we present DiCache, a novel training-free adaptive caching\nstrategy for accelerating diffusion models at runtime, answering both when and\nhow to cache within a unified framework. Specifically, DiCache is composed of\ntwo principal components: (1) Online Probe Profiling Scheme leverages a\nshallow-layer online probe to obtain a stable prior for the caching error in\nreal time, enabling the model to autonomously determine caching schedules. (2)\nDynamic Cache Trajectory Alignment combines multi-step caches based on\nshallow-layer probe feature trajectory to better approximate the current\nfeature, facilitating higher visual quality. Extensive experiments validate\nDiCache's capability in achieving higher efficiency and improved visual\nfidelity over state-of-the-art methods on various leading diffusion models\nincluding WAN 2.1, HunyuanVideo for video generation, and Flux for image\ngeneration.",

In this paper, a strong correlation is revealed between the\nvariation patterns of the shallow-layer feature differences in the diffusion\nmodel and those of final model outputs. Moreover, we have observed that the\nfeatures from different model layers form similar trajectories. Based on these\nobservations, we present DiCache, a novel training-free adaptive caching\nstrategy for accelerating diffusion models at runtime, answering both when and\nhow to cache within a unified framework. Specifically, DiCache is composed of\ntwo principal components: (1) Online Probe Profiling Scheme leverages a\nshallow-layer online probe to obtain a stable prior for the caching error in\nreal time, enabling the model to autonomously determine caching schedules. (2)\nDynamic Cache Trajectory Alignment combines multi-step caches based on\nshallow-layer probe feature trajectory to better approximate the current\nfeature, facilitating higher visual quality. Extensive experiments validate\nDiCache's capability in achieving higher efficiency and improved visual\nfidelity over state-of-the-art methods on various leading diffusion models\nincluding WAN 2.1, HunyuanVideo for video generation, and Flux for image\ngeneration."

It features a multi-SLO-aware scheduler that\nleverages budget estimation and request prioritization to ensure proactive SLO\ncompliance for both new and ongoing requests. The system supports prefill- and\ndecode-stage multi-SLO scheduling for P/D-disaggregated architectures and KV\ncache transfers. It also enables cost-effective scaling decisions,\nprefill-decode instance linking during scaling, and rapid P/D role transitions.\nTo accelerate scaling and reduce cold-start latency, a device-to-device (D2D)\nweight transfer mechanism is proposed that lowers weight loading overhead by up\nto \\textbf{19.39$\\times$}. These optimizations allow the system to achieve up\nto \\textbf{4.44$\\times$} higher SLO attainment, \\textbf{65.82\\%} lower request\nlatency, and cost parity with state-of-the-art baselines.

Meeting these requires real-time scheduling,\nrapid and cost-effective scaling, and support for both collocated and\ndisaggregated Prefill/Decode (P/D) architectures.\n  We present \\textbf{HyperFlexis}, a unified LLM serving system that integrates\nalgorithmic and system-level innovations to jointly optimize scheduling and\nscaling under multiple SLOs. It features a multi-SLO-aware scheduler that\nleverages budget estimation and request prioritization to ensure proactive SLO\ncompliance for both new and ongoing requests. The system supports prefill- and\ndecode-stage multi-SLO scheduling for P/D-disaggregated architectures and KV\ncache transfers. It also enables cost-effective scaling decisions,\nprefill-decode instance linking during scaling, and rapid P/D role transitions.\nTo accelerate scaling and reduce cold-start latency, a device-to-device (D2D)\nweight transfer mechanism is proposed that lowers weight loading overhead by up\nto \\textbf{19.39$\\times$}. These optimizations allow the system to achieve up\nto \\textbf{4.44$\\times$} higher SLO attainment, \\textbf{65.82\\%} lower request\nlatency, and cost parity with state-of-the-art baselines. The code will be\nreleased soon."

                "summary": "Implicit collaborative filtering recommenders are usually trained to learn\nuser positive preferences. Negative sampling, which selects informative\nnegative items to form negative training data, plays a crucial role in this\nprocess. Since items are often clustered in the latent space, existing negative\nsampling strategies normally oversample negative items from the dense regions.\nThis leads to homogeneous negative data and limited model expressiveness. In\nthis paper, we propose Diverse Negative Sampling (DivNS), a novel approach that\nexplicitly accounts for diversity in negative training data during the negative\nsampling process. DivNS first finds hard negative items with large preference\nscores and constructs user-specific caches that store unused but highly\ninformative negative samples. Then, its diversity-augmented sampler selects a\ndiverse subset of negative items from the cache while ensuring dissimilarity\nfrom the user's hard negatives. Finally, a synthetic negatives generator\ncombines the selected diverse negatives with hard negatives to form more\neffective training data.

                    "value": "Implicit collaborative filtering recommenders are usually trained to learn\nuser positive preferences. Negative sampling, which selects informative\nnegative items to form negative training data, plays a crucial role in this\nprocess. Since items are often clustered in the latent space, existing negative\nsampling strategies normally oversample negative items from the dense regions.\nThis leads to homogeneous negative data and limited model expressiveness. In\nthis paper, we propose Diverse Negative Sampling (DivNS), a novel approach that\nexplicitly accounts for diversity in negative training data during the negative\nsampling process. DivNS first finds hard negative items with large preference\nscores and constructs user-specific caches that store unused but highly\ninformative negative samples. Then, its diversity-augmented sampler selects a\ndiverse subset of negative items from the cache while ensuring dissimilarity\nfrom the user's hard negatives. Finally, a synthetic negatives generator\ncombines the selected diverse negatives with hard negatives to form more\neffective training data. The resulting synthetic negatives are both informative\nand diverse, enabling recommenders to learn a broader item space and improve\ntheir generalisability. Extensive experiments on four public datasets\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of DivNS in improving recommendation quality\nwhile maintaining computational efficiency."

Caching, a widely adopted optimization method in\nDiT models, leverages the redundancy in the diffusion process to skip\ncomputations in different granularities (e.g., step, cfg, block). Nevertheless,\nexisting caching methods are limited to single-granularity strategies,\nstruggling to balance generation quality and inference speed in a flexible\nmanner. In this work, we propose MixCache, a training-free caching-based\nframework for efficient video DiT inference. It first distinguishes the\ninterference and boundary between different caching strategies, and then\nintroduces a context-aware cache triggering strategy to determine when caching\nshould be enabled, along with an adaptive hybrid cache decision strategy for\ndynamically selecting the optimal caching granularity. Extensive experiments on\ndiverse models demonstrate that, MixCache can significantly accelerate video\ngeneration (e.g., 1.94$\\times$ speedup on Wan 14B, 1.97$\\times$ speedup on\nHunyuanVideo) while delivering both superior generation quality and inference\nefficiency compared to baseline methods.",

Caching, a widely adopted optimization method in\nDiT models, leverages the redundancy in the diffusion process to skip\ncomputations in different granularities (e.g., step, cfg, block). Nevertheless,\nexisting caching methods are limited to single-granularity strategies,\nstruggling to balance generation quality and inference speed in a flexible\nmanner. In this work, we propose MixCache, a training-free caching-based\nframework for efficient video DiT inference. It first distinguishes the\ninterference and boundary between different caching strategies, and then\nintroduces a context-aware cache triggering strategy to determine when caching\nshould be enabled, along with an adaptive hybrid cache decision strategy for\ndynamically selecting the optimal caching granularity. Extensive experiments on\ndiverse models demonstrate that, MixCache can significantly accelerate video\ngeneration (e.g., 1.94$\\times$ speedup on Wan 14B, 1.97$\\times$ speedup on\nHunyuanVideo) while delivering both superior generation quality and inference\nefficiency compared to baseline methods."

These\npuzzles, often derived from Linguistics Olympiad (LO) contests, provide a\nminimal contamination environment to assess LLMs' linguistic reasoning\nabilities across low-resource languages. This work analyses LLMs' performance\non 629 problems across 41 low-resource languages by labelling each with\nlinguistically informed features to unveil weaknesses. Our analyses show that\nLLMs struggle with puzzles involving higher morphological complexity and\nperform better on puzzles involving linguistic features that are also found in\nEnglish. We also show that splitting words into morphemes as a pre-processing\nstep improves solvability, indicating a need for more informed and\nlanguage-specific tokenisers. These findings thus offer insights into some\nchallenges in linguistic reasoning and modelling of low-resource languages.",

These\npuzzles, often derived from Linguistics Olympiad (LO) contests, provide a\nminimal contamination environment to assess LLMs' linguistic reasoning\nabilities across low-resource languages. This work analyses LLMs' performance\non 629 problems across 41 low-resource languages by labelling each with\nlinguistically informed features to unveil weaknesses. Our analyses show that\nLLMs struggle with puzzles involving higher morphological complexity and\nperform better on puzzles involving linguistic features that are also found in\nEnglish. We also show that splitting words into morphemes as a pre-processing\nstep improves solvability, indicating a need for more informed and\nlanguage-specific tokenisers. These findings thus offer insights into some\nchallenges in linguistic reasoning and modelling of low-resource languages."

                "summary": "Visual generation includes both image and video generation, training\nprobabilistic models to create coherent, diverse, and semantically faithful\ncontent from scratch. While early research focused on unconditional sampling,\npractitioners now demand controllable generation that allows precise\nspecification of layout, pose, motion, or style. While ControlNet grants\nprecise spatial-temporal control, its auxiliary branch markedly increases\nlatency and introduces redundant computation in both uncontrolled regions and\ndenoising steps, especially for video. To address this problem, we introduce\nEVCtrl, a lightweight, plug-and-play control adapter that slashes overhead\nwithout retraining the model. Specifically, we propose a spatio-temporal dual\ncaching strategy for sparse control information. For spatial redundancy, we\nfirst profile how each layer of DiT-ControlNet responds to fine-grained\ncontrol, then partition the network into global and local functional zones. A\nlocality-aware cache focuses computation on the local zones that truly need the\ncontrol signal, skipping the bulk of redundant computation in global regions.\nFor temporal redundancy, we selectively omit unnecessary denoising steps to\nimprove efficiency. Extensive experiments on CogVideo-Controlnet,\nWan2.1-Controlnet, and Flux demonstrate that our method is effective in image\nand video control generation without the need for training. For example, it\nachieves 2.16 and 2.05 times speedups on CogVideo-Controlnet and\nWan2.1-Controlnet, respectively, with almost no degradation in generation\nquality.Codes are available in the supplementary materials.",

                    "value": "Visual generation includes both image and video generation, training\nprobabilistic models to create coherent, diverse, and semantically faithful\ncontent from scratch. While early research focused on unconditional sampling,\npractitioners now demand controllable generation that allows precise\nspecification of layout, pose, motion, or style. While ControlNet grants\nprecise spatial-temporal control, its auxiliary branch markedly increases\nlatency and introduces redundant computation in both uncontrolled regions and\ndenoising steps, especially for video. To address this problem, we introduce\nEVCtrl, a lightweight, plug-and-play control adapter that slashes overhead\nwithout retraining the model. Specifically, we propose a spatio-temporal dual\ncaching strategy for sparse control information. For spatial redundancy, we\nfirst profile how each layer of DiT-ControlNet responds to fine-grained\ncontrol, then partition the network into global and local functional zones. A\nlocality-aware cache focuses computation on the local zones that truly need the\ncontrol signal, skipping the bulk of redundant computation in global regions.\nFor temporal redundancy, we selectively omit unnecessary denoising steps to\nimprove efficiency. Extensive experiments on CogVideo-Controlnet,\nWan2.1-Controlnet, and Flux demonstrate that our method is effective in image\nand video control generation without the need for training. For example, it\nachieves 2.16 and 2.05 times speedups on CogVideo-Controlnet and\nWan2.1-Controlnet, respectively, with almost no degradation in generation\nquality.Codes are available in the supplementary materials."

It\nemploys LLMs to decompose complex narrative queries into temporally ordered\nsub-tasks with contextual cues, enabling coherent scene transitions and\nemotional tone consistency. AudioStory has two appealing features: (1)\nDecoupled bridging mechanism: AudioStory disentangles LLM-diffuser\ncollaboration into two specialized components, i.e., a bridging query for\nintra-event semantic alignment and a residual query for cross-event coherence\npreservation. (2) End-to-end training: By unifying instruction comprehension\nand audio generation within a single end-to-end framework, AudioStory\neliminates the need for modular training pipelines while enhancing synergy\nbetween components. Furthermore, we establish a benchmark AudioStory-10K,\nencompassing diverse domains such as animated soundscapes and natural sound\nnarratives. Extensive experiments show the superiority of AudioStory on both\nsingle-audio generation and narrative audio generation, surpassing prior TTA\nbaselines in both instruction-following ability and audio fidelity.

Our analysis is based on the Arecibo Millennium Survey and new data from\nthe Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) toward radio\nsources 3C 75, 3C 207, and 3C 409. Toward 3C 409, we make a 4$\\sigma$ Zeeman\ndetection and infer $B_{LOS}$ = 9.1 +/- 1.9$\\mu$G, in agreement with Arecibo\nresults. We quantify the dispersion of HI filaments at the locations and\nvelocities of Zeeman components using GALFA-HI narrow-channel emission maps.\nFocusing on a subsample of 42 spectrally distinct components, we find a weak\nbut statistically significant positive correlation (Spearman r = 0.3, $p =\n0.01$) between $|B_{LOS}|$ and the circular variance of HI filament orientation\nangles. To examine its origin, we characterize the environments probed by HI\nabsorption using dust emission, 3D dust maps, OH absorption, and CO emission.\nWe find evidence that existing HI absorption Zeeman measurements trace magnetic\nfields that are coherent on parsec scales, probe primarily local gas\n($100$-$500$ pc, often at distances consistent with the Local Bubble wall), and\nexhibit systematic differences in the magnitude of $B_{LOS}$. We attribute the\ncorrelation between Zeeman measurements and filamentary HI morphology to\nlarge-scale variations in magnetic field strength and/or inclination angle\nacross different Galactic environments, which could arise due to the Local\nBubble geometry or enhanced total field strength in denser regions.",

Our analysis is based on the Arecibo Millennium Survey and new data from\nthe Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) toward radio\nsources 3C 75, 3C 207, and 3C 409. Toward 3C 409, we make a 4$\\sigma$ Zeeman\ndetection and infer $B_{LOS}$ = 9.1 +/- 1.9$\\mu$G, in agreement with Arecibo\nresults. We quantify the dispersion of HI filaments at the locations and\nvelocities of Zeeman components using GALFA-HI narrow-channel emission maps.\nFocusing on a subsample of 42 spectrally distinct components, we find a weak\nbut statistically significant positive correlation (Spearman r = 0.3, $p =\n0.01$) between $|B_{LOS}|$ and the circular variance of HI filament orientation\nangles. To examine its origin, we characterize the environments probed by HI\nabsorption using dust emission, 3D dust maps, OH absorption, and CO emission.\nWe find evidence that existing HI absorption Zeeman measurements trace magnetic\nfields that are coherent on parsec scales, probe primarily local gas\n($100$-$500$ pc, often at distances consistent with the Local Bubble wall), and\nexhibit systematic differences in the magnitude of $B_{LOS}$. We attribute the\ncorrelation between Zeeman measurements and filamentary HI morphology to\nlarge-scale variations in magnetic field strength and/or inclination angle\nacross different Galactic environments, which could arise due to the Local\nBubble geometry or enhanced total field strength in denser regions."

In the layered\ndichalcogenide 1T-TaS$_2$, domain-wall-rich polaronic textures evolve toward a\nuniform ground state through reconfiguration events that exhibit a crossover\nfrom thermally activated to temperature-independent behavior-indicative of\nquantum tunneling. Here, we employ quantum simulation of a two-dimensional\ntransverse-field Ising model (TFIM) with longitudinal bias to uncover the\nmicroscopic processes underlying this relaxation. Using a Schrieffer-Wolff\ntransformation, we map the TFIM to a hardcore boson model, revealing that\nsingle-polaron tunneling events, rather than collective multi-particle\ntransitions, dominate domain wall motion. A scaling analysis of reconfiguration\nrates across varying transverse fields $h_x$ shows collapse when temperature is\nrescaled as $T \\to h_x^n T$ with $n \\approx 1.2$, confirming the dominance of\nfirst- and second-order single-particle processes. This enables us to\nreconstruct a microscopic relaxation pathway consisting of cyclical polaron\nleakage followed by cascades of tunneling events. Our results establish quantum\nsimulation as a powerful tool for inferring real-space mechanisms in strongly\ncorrelated systems and demonstrate a concrete strategy for bridging effective\nspin models with the non-equilibrium dynamics of quantum materials.",

The GSM8K\nbenchmark is widely used to assess the mathematical reasoning of models on\ngrade-school-level questions. While the performance of LLMs on GSM8K has\nsignificantly improved in recent years, it remains unclear whether their\nmathematical reasoning capabilities have genuinely advanced, raising questions\nabout the reliability of the reported metrics. To address these concerns, we\nconduct a large-scale study on several SOTA open and closed models. To overcome\nthe limitations of existing evaluations, we introduce GSM-Symbolic, an improved\nbenchmark created from symbolic templates that allow for the generation of a\ndiverse set of questions. GSM-Symbolic enables more controllable evaluations,\nproviding key insights and more reliable metrics for measuring the reasoning\ncapabilities of models.Our findings reveal that LLMs exhibit noticeable\nvariance when responding to different instantiations of the same question.\nSpecifically, the performance of all models declines when only the numerical\nvalues in the question are altered in the GSM-Symbolic benchmark. Furthermore,\nwe investigate the fragility of mathematical reasoning in these models and show\nthat their performance significantly deteriorates as the number of clauses in a\nquestion increases. We hypothesize that this decline is because current LLMs\ncannot perform genuine logical reasoning; they replicate reasoning steps from\ntheir training data. Adding a single clause that seems relevant to the question\ncauses significant performance drops (up to 65%) across all state-of-the-art\nmodels, even though the clause doesn't contribute to the reasoning chain needed\nfor the final answer.

However, their inference remains slower than that of\nautoregressive models, primarily due to the cost of bidirectional attention and\nthe large number of refinement steps required for high quality outputs. In this\nwork, we highlight and leverage an overlooked property of DLMs early answer\nconvergence: in many cases, the correct answer can be internally identified by\nhalf steps before the final decoding step, both under semi-autoregressive and\nrandom remasking schedules. For example, on GSM8K and MMLU, up to 97% and 99%\nof instances, respectively, can be decoded correctly using only half of the\nrefinement steps. Building on this observation, we introduce Prophet, a\ntraining-free fast decoding paradigm that enables early commit decoding.\nSpecifically, Prophet dynamically decides whether to continue refinement or to\ngo \"all-in\" (i.e., decode all remaining tokens in one step), using the\nconfidence gap between the top-2 prediction candidates as the criterion. It\nintegrates seamlessly into existing DLM implementations, incurs negligible\noverhead, and requires no additional training. Empirical evaluations of\nLLaDA-8B and Dream-7B across multiple tasks show that Prophet reduces the\nnumber of decoding steps by up to 3.4x while preserving high generation\nquality. These results recast DLM decoding as a problem of when to stop\nsampling, and demonstrate that early decode convergence provides a simple yet\npowerful mechanism for accelerating DLM inference, complementary to existing\nspeedup techniques.

The conversation transcripts are then consumed by another AI\nsystem that extracts information and converts it into structured data for\ndownstream usage in automated and manual enforcement mechanisms. Using Google's\nGemini family of LLMs, we implemented this framework on Google Pay (GPay)\nIndia. By augmenting our existing features with this new intelligence, we have\nobserved a 21% uplift in the volume of scam enforcements.

The conversation transcripts are then consumed by another AI\nsystem that extracts information and converts it into structured data for\ndownstream usage in automated and manual enforcement mechanisms. Using Google's\nGemini family of LLMs, we implemented this framework on Google Pay (GPay)\nIndia. By augmenting our existing features with this new intelligence, we have\nobserved a 21% uplift in the volume of scam enforcements. The architecture and\nits robust evaluation framework are highly generalizable, offering a blueprint\nfor building similar AI-driven systems to collect and manage scam intelligence\nin other sensitive domains."

Through extensive\nexperiments involving two state-of-the-art LLM-based methods, three datasets,\nfour generator models, and 15 judge models, complemented by a user study (n =\n90), we demonstrate that judge models with an independent, non-fine-tuned\nrelationship to the generator model provide the most reliable label flipping\nevaluations. Relationships between the generator and judge models, which are\nclosely aligned with the user study for CDA, result in better model performance\nand robustness. Nevertheless, we find that the gap between the most effective\njudge models and the results obtained from the user study remains considerably\nlarge.

This research\nexplores the sentiment of large language models (LLMs) and humans toward\nartificial general intelligence (AGI) using a Likert-scale survey. Seven LLMs,\nincluding GPT-4 and Bard, were analyzed and compared with sentiment data from\nthree independent human sample populations. Temporal variations in sentiment\nwere also evaluated over three consecutive days. The results show a diversity\nin sentiment scores among LLMs, ranging from 3.32 to 4.12 out of 5. GPT-4\nrecorded the most positive sentiment toward AGI, while Bard leaned toward a\nneutral sentiment. In contrast, the human samples showed a lower average\nsentiment of 2.97. The analysis outlines potential conflicts of interest and\nbiases in the sentiment formation of LLMs, and indicates that LLMs could subtly\ninfluence societal perceptions. To address the need for regulatory oversight\nand culturally grounded assessments of AI systems, we introduce the Societal AI\nAlignment and Sentiment Benchmark (SAAS-AI), which leverages multidimensional\nprompts and empirically validated societal value frameworks to evaluate\nlanguage model outputs across temporal, model, and multilingual axes. This\nbenchmark is designed to guide policymakers and AI agencies, including within\nframeworks such as the EU AI Act, by providing robust, actionable insights into\nAI alignment with human values, public sentiment, and ethical norms at both\nnational and international levels.

These agents collaborate across heterogeneous edge infrastructures,\nforming multi-LLM agentic AI systems that leverage collective intelligence and\nspecialized capabilities to tackle complex, multi-step tasks. However, the\ncollaborative nature of multi-LLM systems introduces critical security\nvulnerabilities, including insecure inter-LLM communications, expanded attack\nsurfaces, and cross-domain data leakage that traditional perimeter-based\nsecurity cannot adequately address. To this end, this survey introduces\nzero-trust security of multi-LLM in EGI, a paradigmatic shift following the\n``never trust, always verify'' principle. We begin by systematically analyzing\nthe security risks in multi-LLM systems within EGI contexts. Subsequently, we\npresent the vision of a zero-trust multi-LLM framework in EGI. We then survey\nkey technical progress to facilitate zero-trust multi-LLM systems in EGI.\nParticularly, we categorize zero-trust security mechanisms into model- and\nsystem-level approaches. The former and latter include strong identification,\ncontext-aware access control, etc., and proactive maintenance, blockchain-based\nmanagement, etc., respectively. Finally, we identify critical research\ndirections.

                    "value": "Agentification serves as a critical enabler of Edge General Intelligence\n(EGI), transforming massive edge devices into cognitive agents through\nintegrating Large Language Models (LLMs) and perception, reasoning, and acting\nmodules. These agents collaborate across heterogeneous edge infrastructures,\nforming multi-LLM agentic AI systems that leverage collective intelligence and\nspecialized capabilities to tackle complex, multi-step tasks. However, the\ncollaborative nature of multi-LLM systems introduces critical security\nvulnerabilities, including insecure inter-LLM communications, expanded attack\nsurfaces, and cross-domain data leakage that traditional perimeter-based\nsecurity cannot adequately address. To this end, this survey introduces\nzero-trust security of multi-LLM in EGI, a paradigmatic shift following the\n``never trust, always verify'' principle. We begin by systematically analyzing\nthe security risks in multi-LLM systems within EGI contexts. Subsequently, we\npresent the vision of a zero-trust multi-LLM framework in EGI. We then survey\nkey technical progress to facilitate zero-trust multi-LLM systems in EGI.\nParticularly, we categorize zero-trust security mechanisms into model- and\nsystem-level approaches. The former and latter include strong identification,\ncontext-aware access control, etc., and proactive maintenance, blockchain-based\nmanagement, etc., respectively. Finally, we identify critical research\ndirections. This survey serves as the first systematic treatment of zero-trust\napplied to multi-LLM systems, providing both theoretical foundations and\npractical strategies."

Our two proposed variants, namely local calibration via regression\ntrees and CDF-based calibration, enable finite-sample local coverage guarantees\nfor any scoring function, including HPD, symmetric, and quantile-based regions.\nExperiments on widely used SBI benchmarks demonstrate that our approach\nimproves the quality of uncertainty quantification for neural posterior\nestimators using both normalizing flows and score-diffusion modeling."

                "summary": "In-context generation is a key component of large language models' (LLMs)\nopen-task generalization capability. By leveraging a few examples as context,\nLLMs can perform both in-domain and out-of-domain tasks. Recent advancements in\nauto-regressive vision-language models (VLMs) built upon LLMs have showcased\nimpressive performance in text-to-image generation. However, the potential of\nin-context learning for general image generation tasks remains largely\nunexplored. To address this, we introduce X-Prompt, a purely auto-regressive\nlarge-vision language model designed to deliver competitive performance across\na wide range of both seen and unseen image generation tasks, all within a\nunified in-context learning framework. X-Prompt incorporates a specialized\ndesign that efficiently compresses valuable features from in-context examples,\nsupporting longer in-context token sequences and improving its ability to\ngeneralize to unseen tasks.

                    "value": "In-context generation is a key component of large language models' (LLMs)\nopen-task generalization capability. By leveraging a few examples as context,\nLLMs can perform both in-domain and out-of-domain tasks. Recent advancements in\nauto-regressive vision-language models (VLMs) built upon LLMs have showcased\nimpressive performance in text-to-image generation. However, the potential of\nin-context learning for general image generation tasks remains largely\nunexplored. To address this, we introduce X-Prompt, a purely auto-regressive\nlarge-vision language model designed to deliver competitive performance across\na wide range of both seen and unseen image generation tasks, all within a\nunified in-context learning framework. X-Prompt incorporates a specialized\ndesign that efficiently compresses valuable features from in-context examples,\nsupporting longer in-context token sequences and improving its ability to\ngeneralize to unseen tasks. A unified training task for both text and image\nprediction enables X-Prompt to handle general image generation with enhanced\ntask awareness from in-context examples. Extensive experiments validate the\nmodel's performance across diverse seen image generation tasks and its capacity\nto generalize to previously unseen tasks."

As robots become integrated\ninto daily life, particularly in homes, the ability to anticipate and respond\nto environmental hazards is crucial for ensuring user safety, trust, and\neffective human-robot interaction. Our approach models object-level risk and\ncontext through a semantic graph-based propagation algorithm. Each object is\nrepresented as a node with an associated risk score, and risk propagates\nasymmetrically from high-risk to low-risk objects based on spatial proximity\nand accident relationship. This enables the robot to infer potential hazards\neven when they are not explicitly visible or labeled. Designed for\ninterpretability and lightweight onboard deployment, our method is validated on\na dataset with human-annotated risk regions, achieving a binary risk detection\naccuracy of 75%. The system demonstrates strong alignment with human\nperception, particularly in scenes involving sharp or unstable objects. These\nresults underline the potential of context-aware risk reasoning to enhance\nrobotic scene understanding and proactive safety behaviors in shared\nhuman-robot spaces.

Quantitatively, a 1.2 m long ballasted rail track\nsynthesis equivalent to a 3-hour DEM simulation, was completed under 20\nseconds. The generated voxel grids can also be post-processed to extract grain\ngeometries for DEM-compatibility as well, enabling physically coherent,\nreal-time, scalable granular media synthesis for industrial applications."

Previous work on the Gillian\nplatform, the only CSE platform that is parametric on the memory model, meaning\nthat it can be instantiated to different memory models, suggests that the\nability to use custom memory models allows for more flexibility in supporting\nanalysis of a wide range of programming languages, for implementing custom\nautomation, and for improving performance. However, the literature lacks a\nsatisfactory formal foundation for memory-model-parametric CSE platforms.\n  In this paper, inspired by Gillian, we provide a new formal foundation for\nmemory-model-parametric CSE platforms.

Although such models are routinely fine-tuned for\ndownstream NLP tasks, recent work shows they remain vulnerable to backdoor\nattacks that survive vanilla fine-tuning. These attacks are difficult to defend\nbecause end users typically lack knowledge of the attack triggers. Such attacks\nconsist of stealthy malicious triggers introduced through subtle syntactic or\nstylistic manipulations, which can bypass traditional detection and remain in\nthe model, making post-hoc purification essential. In this study, we explore\nwhether attention-head pruning can mitigate these threats without any knowledge\nof the trigger or access to a clean reference model. To this end, we design and\nimplement six pruning-based strategies: (i) gradient-based pruning, (ii)\nlayer-wise variance pruning, (iii) gradient-based pruning with structured L1/L2\nsparsification, (iv) randomized ensemble pruning, (v)\nreinforcement-learning-guided pruning, and (vi) Bayesian uncertainty pruning.\nEach method iteratively removes the least informative heads while monitoring\nvalidation accuracy to avoid over-pruning. Experimental evaluation shows that\ngradient-based pruning performs best while defending the syntactic triggers,\nwhereas reinforcement learning and Bayesian pruning better withstand stylistic\nattacks.",

Conventional approaches typically employ\nsurrogate models-such as decision trees or neural networks-to estimate feature\nimportance. However, their effectiveness is inherently constrained, as these\nmodels may struggle under suboptimal training conditions, including feature\ncollinearity, high-dimensional sparsity, and insufficient data. In this paper,\nwe propose SELF, an SurrogatE-Light Feature selection method for deep\nrecommender systems. SELF integrates semantic reasoning from Large Language\nModels (LLMs) with task-specific learning from surrogate models. Specifically,\nLLMs first produce a semantically informed ranking of feature importance, which\nis subsequently refined by a surrogate model, effectively integrating general\nworld knowledge with task-specific learning. Comprehensive experiments on three\npublic datasets from real-world recommender platforms validate the\neffectiveness of SELF.",

                    "value": "Feature selection is crucial in recommender systems for improving model\nefficiency and predictive performance. Conventional approaches typically employ\nsurrogate models-such as decision trees or neural networks-to estimate feature\nimportance. However, their effectiveness is inherently constrained, as these\nmodels may struggle under suboptimal training conditions, including feature\ncollinearity, high-dimensional sparsity, and insufficient data. In this paper,\nwe propose SELF, an SurrogatE-Light Feature selection method for deep\nrecommender systems. SELF integrates semantic reasoning from Large Language\nModels (LLMs) with task-specific learning from surrogate models. Specifically,\nLLMs first produce a semantically informed ranking of feature importance, which\nis subsequently refined by a surrogate model, effectively integrating general\nworld knowledge with task-specific learning. Comprehensive experiments on three\npublic datasets from real-world recommender platforms validate the\neffectiveness of SELF."

The GSM8K\nbenchmark is widely used to assess the mathematical reasoning of models on\ngrade-school-level questions. While the performance of LLMs on GSM8K has\nsignificantly improved in recent years, it remains unclear whether their\nmathematical reasoning capabilities have genuinely advanced, raising questions\nabout the reliability of the reported metrics. To address these concerns, we\nconduct a large-scale study on several SOTA open and closed models. To overcome\nthe limitations of existing evaluations, we introduce GSM-Symbolic, an improved\nbenchmark created from symbolic templates that allow for the generation of a\ndiverse set of questions. GSM-Symbolic enables more controllable evaluations,\nproviding key insights and more reliable metrics for measuring the reasoning\ncapabilities of models.Our findings reveal that LLMs exhibit noticeable\nvariance when responding to different instantiations of the same question.\nSpecifically, the performance of all models declines when only the numerical\nvalues in the question are altered in the GSM-Symbolic benchmark. Furthermore,\nwe investigate the fragility of mathematical reasoning in these models and show\nthat their performance significantly deteriorates as the number of clauses in a\nquestion increases. We hypothesize that this decline is because current LLMs\ncannot perform genuine logical reasoning; they replicate reasoning steps from\ntheir training data. Adding a single clause that seems relevant to the question\ncauses significant performance drops (up to 65%) across all state-of-the-art\nmodels, even though the clause doesn't contribute to the reasoning chain needed\nfor the final answer. Overall, our work offers a more nuanced understanding of\nLLMs' capabilities and limitations in mathematical reasoning.",

We test it on 61 LLMs of different sizes, model families, and training\nstrategies. We find that LLMs can usually solve both steps in isolation, yet\ntheir accuracy drops by ~30% on average when the two are combined.

In contrast, non-expert human annotators can solve the compositional\nquestions and the individual steps in AgentCoMa with similarly high accuracy.\nFurthermore, we conduct a series of interpretability studies to better\nunderstand the performance gap, examining neuron patterns, attention maps and\nmembership inference. Our work underscores a substantial degree of model\nbrittleness in the context of mixed-type compositional reasoning and offers a\ntest bed for future improvement.",

This coarse-to-fine training strategy leads to substantial\nimprovements on downstream reasoning tasks, e.g., MMMU and MathVista. To\noptimize efficiency, we propose a Visual Resolution Router (ViR) that\ndynamically adjusts the resolution of visual tokens without compromising\nperformance.

Through\ncomprehensive quantitative analysis, these findings suggest that stereotype\nformation in AI systems may arise as an emergent property of multi-agent\ninteractions, rather than merely from training data biases. Our work\nunderscores the need for future research to explore the underlying mechanisms\nof this phenomenon and develop strategies to mitigate its ethical impacts."

While the combination of test-time scaling\nwith dedicated outcome or process reward models has opened up new avenues to\nenhance LLMs performance in complex reasoning tasks, this space is\nunder-explored in deductive logical reasoning. We present a set of Outcome\nReward Models (ORMs) for deductive reasoning. To train the ORMs we mainly\ngenerate data using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) with single and multiple samples.\nAdditionally, we propose a novel tactic to further expand the type of errors\ncovered in the training dataset of the ORM. In particular, we propose an echo\ngeneration technique that leverages LLMs' tendency to reflect incorrect\nassumptions made in prompts to extract additional training data, covering\npreviously unexplored error types. While a standard CoT chain may contain\nerrors likely to be made by the reasoner, the echo strategy deliberately steers\nthe model toward incorrect reasoning. We show that ORMs trained on CoT and\necho-augmented data demonstrate improved performance on the FOLIO, JustLogic,\nand ProverQA datasets across four different LLMs.",

                    "value": "Logical reasoning is a critical benchmark for evaluating the capabilities of\nlarge language models (LLMs), as it reflects their ability to derive valid\nconclusions from given premises. While the combination of test-time scaling\nwith dedicated outcome or process reward models has opened up new avenues to\nenhance LLMs performance in complex reasoning tasks, this space is\nunder-explored in deductive logical reasoning. We present a set of Outcome\nReward Models (ORMs) for deductive reasoning. To train the ORMs we mainly\ngenerate data using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) with single and multiple samples.\nAdditionally, we propose a novel tactic to further expand the type of errors\ncovered in the training dataset of the ORM. In particular, we propose an echo\ngeneration technique that leverages LLMs' tendency to reflect incorrect\nassumptions made in prompts to extract additional training data, covering\npreviously unexplored error types. While a standard CoT chain may contain\nerrors likely to be made by the reasoner, the echo strategy deliberately steers\nthe model toward incorrect reasoning. We show that ORMs trained on CoT and\necho-augmented data demonstrate improved performance on the FOLIO, JustLogic,\nand ProverQA datasets across four different LLMs."

This research\nexplores the sentiment of large language models (LLMs) and humans toward\nartificial general intelligence (AGI) using a Likert-scale survey. Seven LLMs,\nincluding GPT-4 and Bard, were analyzed and compared with sentiment data from\nthree independent human sample populations. Temporal variations in sentiment\nwere also evaluated over three consecutive days. The results show a diversity\nin sentiment scores among LLMs, ranging from 3.32 to 4.12 out of 5. GPT-4\nrecorded the most positive sentiment toward AGI, while Bard leaned toward a\nneutral sentiment. In contrast, the human samples showed a lower average\nsentiment of 2.97. The analysis outlines potential conflicts of interest and\nbiases in the sentiment formation of LLMs, and indicates that LLMs could subtly\ninfluence societal perceptions.

For LLMs, we consider variations of\nprompts that include subcategory definitions and/or shots. We found that both\nLLama-3 8B and 70B, even with carefully curated shots, are largely outperformed\nby SLMs. While the multilabel classifier performs best on annotated data,\nsupplementing training with unflagged excerpts as negative examples boosts the\nspecific classifiers' AUC by up to 25%, making them most effective models for\nmitigating harmful language in medical curricula.",

During training and testing, we utilize\nmeta-knowledge from LLMs to refine inputs with different strategies. We also\ndiscover a new phenomenon, train-test co-design. It requires us to apply query\nstrategies during training and testing as a whole. Only applying strategies on\ntraining or testing would seriously degrade the performance gained. We are also\nsurprised to find that seemingly low data quality datasets can perform better.\nWe can get the best performance even by adding irrelevant information to the\nqueries, with randomly selected 1k examples from a minimally filtered dataset.\nThese findings contradict the widely held inductive bias, \"garbage in, garbage\nout\". Curating datasets with seemingly high-quality data can even potentially\nlimit the performance ceiling. In addition, models trained on more data with\nsimilar quality (15k VS 1k) perform worse, the intuition of simply scaling the\nsize should also be carefully inspected. The good news is that our findings are\ncompatible with the Less is More phenomenon. 1K examples are enough to invoke\nhigh-level reasoning ability.

We propose MCMeshGAN, the first multimodal conditional mesh-to-mesh\ngenerative adversarial network for 3D aneurysm growth prediction. MCMeshGAN\nintroduces a dual-branch architecture combining a novel local KNN-based\nconvolutional network (KCN) to preserve fine-grained geometric details and a\nglobal graph convolutional network (GCN) to capture long-range structural\ncontext, overcoming the over-smoothing limitations of deep GCNs. A dedicated\ncondition branch encodes clinical attributes (age, sex) and the target time\ninterval to generate anatomically plausible, temporally controlled predictions,\nenabling retrospective and prospective modeling. We curated TAAMesh, a new\nlongitudinal thoracic aortic aneurysm mesh dataset consisting of 590 multimodal\nrecords (CT scans, 3D meshes, and clinical data) from 208 patients. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that MCMeshGAN consistently outperforms\nstate-of-the-art baselines in both geometric accuracy and clinically important\ndiameter estimation.

Our attack\nmethodology, AIOpsDoom, is fully automated--combining reconnaissance, fuzzing,\nand LLM-driven adversarial input generation--and operates without any prior\nknowledge of the target system.\n  To counter this threat, we propose AIOpsShield, a defense mechanism that\nsanitizes telemetry data by exploiting its structured nature and the minimal\nrole of user-generated content.

To\naddress this, we introduce a suite of five Hindi LLM evaluation datasets:\nIFEval-Hi, MT-Bench-Hi, GSM8K-Hi, ChatRAG-Hi, and BFCL-Hi. These were created\nusing a methodology that combines from-scratch human annotation with a\ntranslate-and-verify process. We leverage this suite to conduct an extensive\nbenchmarking of open-source LLMs supporting Hindi, providing a detailed\ncomparative analysis of their current capabilities. Our curation process also\nserves as a replicable methodology for developing benchmarks in other\nlow-resource languages."

We quantify the uncertainties on these calibrated\nevents using the orbital similarity criterion $D_D$. We also examine the\nvelocity components imbalance and identify discriminants that can indicate the\naccuracy of an event. We identify two groups in the CNEOS database. CNEOS data\nproduces ephemeris determinations with $D_D$<0.1 for fireballs reported either\n(i) after late 2017 or (ii) with impact energies above 0.45 kt with 74-78% of\nevents having $D_D$=0.03$\\pm$0.02, while ~11% show $D_D$<0.008. Our statistical\ntest confirms these two parameters as the only reliable discriminants that,\nwhen combined, explain the two accuracy groups. Daylight, z-velocity component,\nlow altitude, long duration, and latitude might also indicate errors, although\nthe limited dataset may obscure correlations. No clear discriminants are\nidentified for more restrictive $D_D$ cut-offs. We provide estimates of orbital\nuncertainties for calibrated events. The hyperbolic fireball subset in the\nCNEOS database appears as an outlier in the velocity imbalance test. Our\nresults confirm that the fidelity of CNEOS fireball data improved significantly\nfrom 2018, likely due to the deployment of next-generation space sensors, and\nshow a growing number of high-velocity events. Hyperbolic candidates should be\ninterpreted with caution, as their velocities and inclinations likely reflect\nmeasurement errors.

We address\nthe gap between retrieval relevance and generative utility by employing LLMs to\nannotate document utility. To effectively utilize multiple positive samples per\nquery, we introduce a novel loss that maximizes their summed marginal\nlikelihood. Using the Qwen-2.5-32B model, we annotate utility on the MS MARCO\ndataset and conduct retrieval experiments on MS MARCO and BEIR, as well as RAG\nexperiments on MS MARCO QA, NQ, and HotpotQA. Our results show that\nLLM-generated annotations enhance out-of-domain retrieval performance and\nimprove RAG outcomes compared to models trained solely on human annotations or\ndownstream QA metrics. Furthermore, combining LLM annotations with just 20% of\nhuman labels achieves performance comparable to using full human annotations.\nOur study offers a comprehensive approach to utilizing LLM annotations for\ninitializing QA systems on new corpora.",

This paper presents the experimental results from three 5G\npositioning testbeds running open-source OpenAirInterface (OAI) gNB and Core\nNetwork (CN), using Uplink Time Difference of Arrival (UL-TDoA) with the newly\nintegrated Location Management Function (LMF). The testbeds are deployed across\nboth indoor factories and outdoor scenarios with O-RAN Radio Units (RUs),\nfollowing a 3GPP-compliant system model. The experiments highlight the impact\nof synchronization impairments, multipath propagation, and deployment geometry\non positioning accuracy.

However, they are usually inefficient or ineffective for large\nmodels, not workable for black-box models, or unable to continuously adjust\nLLMs' sensitivity to the knowledge provided in the context. To mitigate these\nproblems, we propose CSKS (Continuously Steering Knowledge Sensitivity), a\nsimple framework that can steer LLMs' sensitivity to contextual knowledge\ncontinuously at a lightweight cost. Specifically, we tune two small LMs (i.e.\nproxy models) and use the difference in their output distributions to shift the\noriginal distribution of an LLM without modifying the LLM weights. In the\nevaluation process, we not only design synthetic data and fine-grained metrics\nto measure models' sensitivity to contextual knowledge but also use a real\nconflict dataset to validate CSKS's practical efficacy. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that our framework achieves continuous and precise control over\nLLMs' sensitivity to contextual knowledge, enabling both increased sensitivity\nand reduced sensitivity, thereby allowing LLMs to prioritize either contextual\nor parametric knowledge as needed flexibly.

While early surveys focus on monolithic vision-language\nmodels or general multimodal reasoning, a dedicated synthesis of the rapidly\nexpanding compositional visual reasoning literature is still missing. We fill\nthis gap with a comprehensive survey spanning 2023 to 2025 that systematically\nreviews 260+ papers from top venues (CVPR, ICCV, NeurIPS, ICML, ACL, etc.). We\nfirst formalize core definitions and describe why compositional approaches\noffer advantages in cognitive alignment, semantic fidelity, robustness,\ninterpretability, and data efficiency. Next, we trace a five-stage paradigm\nshift: from prompt-enhanced language-centric pipelines, through tool-enhanced\nLLMs and tool-enhanced VLMs, to recently minted chain-of-thought reasoning and\nunified agentic VLMs, highlighting their architectural designs, strengths, and\nlimitations. We then catalog 60+ benchmarks and corresponding metrics that\nprobe compositional visual reasoning along dimensions such as grounding\naccuracy, chain-of-thought faithfulness, and high-resolution perception.\nDrawing on these analyses, we distill key insights, identify open challenges\n(e.g., limitations of LLM-based reasoning, hallucination, a bias toward\ndeductive reasoning, scalable supervision, tool integration, and benchmark\nlimitations), and outline future directions, including world-model integration,\nhuman-AI collaborative reasoning, and richer evaluation protocols. By offering\na unified taxonomy, historical roadmap, and critical outlook, this survey aims\nto serve as a foundational reference and inspire the next generation of\ncompositional visual reasoning research.",

                    "value": "Compositional visual reasoning has emerged as a key research frontier in\nmultimodal AI, aiming to endow machines with the human-like ability to\ndecompose visual scenes, ground intermediate concepts, and perform multi-step\nlogical inference. While early surveys focus on monolithic vision-language\nmodels or general multimodal reasoning, a dedicated synthesis of the rapidly\nexpanding compositional visual reasoning literature is still missing. We fill\nthis gap with a comprehensive survey spanning 2023 to 2025 that systematically\nreviews 260+ papers from top venues (CVPR, ICCV, NeurIPS, ICML, ACL, etc.). We\nfirst formalize core definitions and describe why compositional approaches\noffer advantages in cognitive alignment, semantic fidelity, robustness,\ninterpretability, and data efficiency. Next, we trace a five-stage paradigm\nshift: from prompt-enhanced language-centric pipelines, through tool-enhanced\nLLMs and tool-enhanced VLMs, to recently minted chain-of-thought reasoning and\nunified agentic VLMs, highlighting their architectural designs, strengths, and\nlimitations. We then catalog 60+ benchmarks and corresponding metrics that\nprobe compositional visual reasoning along dimensions such as grounding\naccuracy, chain-of-thought faithfulness, and high-resolution perception.\nDrawing on these analyses, we distill key insights, identify open challenges\n(e.g., limitations of LLM-based reasoning, hallucination, a bias toward\ndeductive reasoning, scalable supervision, tool integration, and benchmark\nlimitations), and outline future directions, including world-model integration,\nhuman-AI collaborative reasoning, and richer evaluation protocols. By offering\na unified taxonomy, historical roadmap, and critical outlook, this survey aims\nto serve as a foundational reference and inspire the next generation of\ncompositional visual reasoning research."

This study investigates the\nfeasibility of leveraging large language models (LLMs) to assist in translating\nPL/SQL code into Java for the modernised \"VTF3\" system. By leveraging a dataset\ncomprising 10 PL/SQL-to-Java code pairs and 15 Java classes, which collectively\nestablished a domain model for the translated files, multiple LLMs were\nevaluated. Furthermore, we propose a customized prompting strategy that\nintegrates chain-of-guidance reasoning with $n$-shot prompting. Our findings\nindicate that this methodology effectively guides LLMs in generating\nsyntactically accurate translations while also achieving functional\ncorrectness. However, the findings are limited by the small sample size of\navailable code files and the restricted access to test cases used for\nvalidating the correctness of the generated code. Nevertheless, these findings\nlay the groundwork for scalable, automated solutions in modernising large\nlegacy systems.",

This study investigates the\nfeasibility of leveraging large language models (LLMs) to assist in translating\nPL/SQL code into Java for the modernised \"VTF3\" system. By leveraging a dataset\ncomprising 10 PL/SQL-to-Java code pairs and 15 Java classes, which collectively\nestablished a domain model for the translated files, multiple LLMs were\nevaluated. Furthermore, we propose a customized prompting strategy that\nintegrates chain-of-guidance reasoning with $n$-shot prompting. Our findings\nindicate that this methodology effectively guides LLMs in generating\nsyntactically accurate translations while also achieving functional\ncorrectness. However, the findings are limited by the small sample size of\navailable code files and the restricted access to test cases used for\nvalidating the correctness of the generated code. Nevertheless, these findings\nlay the groundwork for scalable, automated solutions in modernising large\nlegacy systems."

The\napproach converts qualitative feedback into structured data, enabling\ncomprehensive evaluation of key game design elements, monetization models, and\nplatform-specific trends. The findings reveal distinct patterns in player\npreferences across PC and VR games, highlighting factors that contribute to\nhigher player satisfaction. By integrating Google Cloud for largescale data\nstorage and processing, this study establishes a scalable framework for game\nreview analysis. The study's insights offer actionable guidance for game\ndevelopers, helping optimize game mechanics, pricing strategies, and player\nengagement."

To address this issue, we introduce Semantic Energy, a novel\nuncertainty estimation framework that leverages the inherent confidence of LLMs\nby operating directly on logits of penultimate layer. By combining semantic\nclustering with a Boltzmann-inspired energy distribution, our method better\ncaptures uncertainty in cases where semantic entropy fails. Experiments across\nmultiple benchmarks show that Semantic Energy significantly improves\nhallucination detection and uncertainty estimation, offering more reliable\nsignals for downstream applications such as hallucination detection.",
