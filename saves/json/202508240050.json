Existing static\ncaching strategies mitigate this issue only in the initial navigation phase by\npreloading entry points and multi-hop neighbors, but they fail in the second\nphase where query-dependent nodes must be dynamically accessed to achieve high\nrecall. We propose GoVector, an I/O-efficient caching strategy tailored for\ndisk-based graph indices. GoVector combines (1) a static cache that stores\nentry points and frequently accessed neighbors, and (2) a dynamic cache that\nadaptively captures nodes with high spatial locality during the second search\nphase. To further align storage layout with similarity-driven search patterns,\nGoVector reorders nodes on disk so that similar vectors are colocated on the\nsame or adjacent pages, thereby improving locality and reducing I/O overhead.\nExtensive experiments on multiple public datasets show that GoVector achieves\nsubstantial performance improvements.

In this paper, we develop a novel model placement\nframework, called parameter-sharing model caching (TrimCaching). TrimCaching\nexploits the key observation that a wide range of AI models, such as\nconvolutional neural networks or large language models, can share a significant\nproportion of parameter blocks containing reusable knowledge, thereby improving\nstorage efficiency. To this end, we formulate a parameter-sharing model\nplacement problem to maximize the cache hit ratio in multi-edge wireless\nnetworks by balancing the fundamental tradeoff between storage efficiency and\nservice latency. We show that the formulated problem is a submodular\nmaximization problem with submodular constraints, for which no polynomial-time\napproximation algorithm exists. To tackle this challenge, we study an important\nspecial case, where a small fixed number of parameter blocks are shared across\nmodels, which often holds in practice. In such a case, a polynomial-time\nalgorithm with a $\\left(1-\\epsilon\\right)/2$-approximation guarantee is\ndeveloped.

Garbage\ncollection (GC) holds significant promise for space amplification reduction,\nyet existing GC strategies often fall short in optimization performance,\nlacking thorough consideration of workload characteristics. Additionally,\ncurrent KV-separated LSM-trees also ignore the adverse effect of the space\namplification in the index LSM-tree. In this paper, we systematically analyze\nthe sources of space amplification of KV-separated LSM-trees and introduce\nScavenger, which achieves a better trade-off between performance and space\namplification. Scavenger initially proposes an I/O-efficient garbage collection\nscheme to reduce I/O overhead and incorporates a space-aware compaction\nstrategy based on compensated size to minimize the space amplification of index\nLSM-trees. Extensive experiments show that Scavenger significantly improves\nwrite performance and achieves lower space amplification than other\nKV-separated LSM-trees (including BlobDB, Titan, and TerarkDB)."

To stabilize generations across resolution transitions, we leverage\nnoise-timestep rescheduling to adapt the noise level across varying\nresolutions. Our method significantly reduces computation while preserving\nimage quality by achieving up to 7.0$\\times$ speed-up on FLUX and 3.0$\\times$\non Stable Diffusion 3 with minimal degradation.

While ControlNet grants\nprecise spatial-temporal control, its auxiliary branch markedly increases\nlatency and introduces redundant computation in both uncontrolled regions and\ndenoising steps, especially for video. To address this problem, we introduce\nEVCtrl, a lightweight, plug-and-play control adapter that slashes overhead\nwithout retraining the model. Specifically, we propose a spatio-temporal dual\ncaching strategy for sparse control information. For spatial redundancy, we\nfirst profile how each layer of DiT-ControlNet responds to fine-grained\ncontrol, then partition the network into global and local functional zones. A\nlocality-aware cache focuses computation on the local zones that truly need the\ncontrol signal, skipping the bulk of redundant computation in global regions.\nFor temporal redundancy, we selectively omit unnecessary denoising steps to\nimprove efficiency. Extensive experiments on CogVideo-Controlnet,\nWan2.1-Controlnet, and Flux demonstrate that our method is effective in image\nand video control generation without the need for training. For example, it\nachieves 2.16 and 2.05 times speedups on CogVideo-Controlnet and\nWan2.1-Controlnet, respectively, with almost no degradation in generation\nquality.Codes are available in the supplementary materials.",

Our results demonstrate that we can achieve performance comparable\nto the original SPM-only system while requiring only 1.27% of the storage size.\nThe runahead execution mechanism achieves an average 3.04x speedup (up to\n6.91x), with cache reconfiguration technique providing an additional 6.02%\nimprovement, significantly enhancing CGRA performance for irregular memory\naccess patterns."

Existing defenses, such as per-user isolation, eliminate\nleakage but degrade performance by up to 38.9% in time-to-first-token (TTFT),\nmaking them impractical for high-throughput deployment. To address this gap, we\nintroduce SafeKV (Secure and Flexible KV Cache Sharing), a privacy-aware\nKV-cache management framework that selectively shares non-sensitive entries\nwhile confining sensitive content to private caches. SafeKV comprises three\ncomponents: (i) a hybrid, multi-tier detection pipeline that integrates\nrule-based pattern matching, a general-purpose privacy detector, and\ncontext-aware validation; (ii) a unified radix-tree index that manages public\nand private entries across heterogeneous memory tiers (HBM, DRAM, SSD); and\n(iii) entropy-based access monitoring to detect and mitigate residual\ninformation leakage. Our evaluation shows that SafeKV mitigates 94% - 97% of\ntiming-based side-channel attacks. Compared to per-user isolation method,\nSafeKV improves TTFT by up to 40.58% and throughput by up to 2.66X across\ndiverse LLMs and workloads. SafeKV reduces cache-induced TTFT overhead from\n50.41% to 11.74% on Qwen3-235B.

SafeKV comprises three\ncomponents: (i) a hybrid, multi-tier detection pipeline that integrates\nrule-based pattern matching, a general-purpose privacy detector, and\ncontext-aware validation; (ii) a unified radix-tree index that manages public\nand private entries across heterogeneous memory tiers (HBM, DRAM, SSD); and\n(iii) entropy-based access monitoring to detect and mitigate residual\ninformation leakage. Our evaluation shows that SafeKV mitigates 94% - 97% of\ntiming-based side-channel attacks. Compared to per-user isolation method,\nSafeKV improves TTFT by up to 40.58% and throughput by up to 2.66X across\ndiverse LLMs and workloads. SafeKV reduces cache-induced TTFT overhead from\n50.41% to 11.74% on Qwen3-235B. By combining fine-grained privacy control with\nhigh cache reuse efficiency, SafeKV reclaims the performance advantages of\nglobal sharing while providing robust runtime privacy guarantees for LLM\ninference."

To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Adaptive Cache\nEnhancement (ACE) framework, which constructs a robust cache by selectively\nstoring high-confidence or low-entropy image embeddings per class, guided by\ndynamic, class-specific thresholds initialized from zero-shot statistics and\niteratively refined using an exponential moving average and\nexploration-augmented updates.

These limitations seriously reduce the efficacy of learning from\nexpert demonstrations, resulting in failures in object localization, grasp\nplanning, and long-horizon task execution. To address these challenges, we\npropose Causal Diffusion Policy (CDP), a novel transformer-based diffusion\nmodel that enhances action prediction by conditioning on historical action\nsequences, thereby enabling more coherent and context-aware visuomotor policy\nlearning. To further mitigate the computational cost associated with\nautoregressive inference, a caching mechanism is also introduced to store\nattention key-value pairs from previous timesteps, substantially reducing\nredundant computations during execution. Extensive experiments in both\nsimulated and real-world environments, spanning diverse 2D and 3D manipulation\ntasks, demonstrate that CDP uniquely leverages historical action sequences to\nachieve significantly higher accuracy than existing methods. Moreover, even\nwhen faced with degraded input observation quality, CDP maintains remarkable\nprecision by reasoning through temporal continuity, which highlights its\npractical robustness for robotic control under realistic, imperfect conditions.",

                "summary": "Long-context inference for Large Language Models (LLMs) is heavily limited by\nhigh computational demands. While several existing methods optimize attention\ncomputation, they still process the full set of hidden states at each layer,\nlimiting overall efficiency. In this work, we propose SlimInfer, an innovative\nframework that aims to accelerate inference by directly pruning less critical\nprompt tokens during the forward pass. Our key insight is an information\ndiffusion phenomenon: As information from critical tokens propagates through\nlayers, it becomes distributed across the entire sequence.

While exact algorithms based on MILP, CP, SAT, or dynamic\nprogramming guarantee optimality, they often suffer from poor anytime behavior\n-- meaning they struggle to find high-quality decision trees quickly when the\nsearch is stopped before completion -- due to unbalanced search space\nexploration. To address this, several anytime extensions of exact methods have\nbeen proposed, such as LDS-DL8.5, Top-k-DL8.5, and Blossom, but they have not\nbeen systematically compared, making it difficult to assess their relative\neffectiveness. In this paper, we propose CA-DL8.5, a generic, complete, and\nanytime beam search algorithm that extends the DL8.5 framework and unifies some\nexisting anytime strategies. In particular, CA-DL8.5 generalizes previous\napproaches LDS-DL8.5 and Top-k-DL8.5, by allowing the integration of various\nheuristics and relaxation mechanisms through a modular design. The algorithm\nreuses DL8.5's efficient branch-and-bound pruning and trie-based caching,\ncombined with a restart-based beam search that gradually relaxes pruning\ncriteria to improve solution quality over time. Our contributions are twofold:\n(1) We introduce this new generic framework for exact and anytime decision tree\nlearning, enabling the incorporation of diverse heuristics and search\nstrategies; (2) We conduct a rigorous empirical comparison of several\ninstantiations of CA-DL8.5 -- based on Purity, Gain, Discrepancy, and Top-k\nheuristics -- using an anytime evaluation metric called the primal gap\nintegral.

This disconnect limits reuse, optimization, and runtime\ncontrol.\n  In this paper, we describe our vision and an initial design for SPEAR, a\nlanguage and runtime that fills this prompt management gap by making prompts\nstructured, adaptive, and first-class components of the execution model. SPEAR\nenables (1) runtime prompt refinement -- modifying prompts dynamically in\nresponse to execution-time signals such as confidence, latency, or missing\ncontext; and (2) structured prompt management -- organizing prompt fragments\ninto versioned views with support for introspection and logging.\n  SPEAR defines a prompt algebra that governs how prompts are constructed and\nadapted within a pipeline. It supports multiple refinement modes (manual,\nassisted, and automatic), giving developers a balance between control and\nautomation. By treating prompt logic as structured data, SPEAR enables\noptimizations such as operator fusion, prefix caching, and view reuse.\nPreliminary experiments quantify the behavior of different refinement modes\ncompared to static prompts and agentic retries, as well as the impact of\nprompt-level optimizations such as operator fusion.",

This disconnect limits reuse, optimization, and runtime\ncontrol.\n  In this paper, we describe our vision and an initial design for SPEAR, a\nlanguage and runtime that fills this prompt management gap by making prompts\nstructured, adaptive, and first-class components of the execution model. SPEAR\nenables (1) runtime prompt refinement -- modifying prompts dynamically in\nresponse to execution-time signals such as confidence, latency, or missing\ncontext; and (2) structured prompt management -- organizing prompt fragments\ninto versioned views with support for introspection and logging.\n  SPEAR defines a prompt algebra that governs how prompts are constructed and\nadapted within a pipeline. It supports multiple refinement modes (manual,\nassisted, and automatic), giving developers a balance between control and\nautomation. By treating prompt logic as structured data, SPEAR enables\noptimizations such as operator fusion, prefix caching, and view reuse.\nPreliminary experiments quantify the behavior of different refinement modes\ncompared to static prompts and agentic retries, as well as the impact of\nprompt-level optimizations such as operator fusion."

Evaluations of SOTA models on AURA reveal a critical\nreasoning gap: although models achieve high accuracy (up to 92% on some tasks),\ntheir Factual Consistency and Core Inference scores fall below 45%. This\ndiscrepancy highlights that models often arrive at correct answers through\nflawed logic, underscoring the need for our benchmark and paving the way for\nmore robust multimodal evaluation."

As such, NiceWebRL enables AI researchers to compare\ntheir algorithms to human performance, cognitive scientists to test ML\nalgorithms as theories for human cognition, and multi-agent researchers to\ndevelop algorithms for human-AI collaboration. We showcase NiceWebRL with 3\ncase studies that demonstrate its potential to help develop Human-like AI,\nHuman-compatible AI, and Human-assistive AI. In the first case study\n(Human-like AI), NiceWebRL enables the development of a novel RL model of\ncognition. Here, NiceWebRL facilitates testing this model against human\nparticipants in both a grid world and Craftax, a 2D Minecraft domain. In our\nsecond case study (Human-compatible AI), NiceWebRL enables the development of a\nnovel multi-agent RL algorithm that can generalize to human partners in the\nOvercooked domain. Finally, in our third case study (Human-assistive AI), we\nshow how NiceWebRL can allow researchers to study how an LLM can assist humans\non complex tasks in XLand-Minigrid, an environment with millions of\nhierarchical tasks.

As such, NiceWebRL enables AI researchers to compare\ntheir algorithms to human performance, cognitive scientists to test ML\nalgorithms as theories for human cognition, and multi-agent researchers to\ndevelop algorithms for human-AI collaboration. We showcase NiceWebRL with 3\ncase studies that demonstrate its potential to help develop Human-like AI,\nHuman-compatible AI, and Human-assistive AI. In the first case study\n(Human-like AI), NiceWebRL enables the development of a novel RL model of\ncognition. Here, NiceWebRL facilitates testing this model against human\nparticipants in both a grid world and Craftax, a 2D Minecraft domain. In our\nsecond case study (Human-compatible AI), NiceWebRL enables the development of a\nnovel multi-agent RL algorithm that can generalize to human partners in the\nOvercooked domain. Finally, in our third case study (Human-assistive AI), we\nshow how NiceWebRL can allow researchers to study how an LLM can assist humans\non complex tasks in XLand-Minigrid, an environment with millions of\nhierarchical tasks. The library is available at\nhttps://github.com/KempnerInstitute/nicewebrl."

Our approach\ncombines traditional natural language processing and machine learning\ntechniques implemented in the Annif toolkit with innovative LLM-based methods\nfor translation and synthetic data generation, and merging predictions from\nmonolingual models. The system ranked first in the all-subjects category and\nsecond in the tib-core-subjects category in the quantitative evaluation, and\nfourth in qualitative evaluations. These findings demonstrate the potential of\ncombining traditional XMTC algorithms with modern LLM techniques to improve the\naccuracy and efficiency of subject indexing in multilingual contexts.",

The task\nrequired creating subject predictions for bibliographic records from the\nbilingual TIBKAT database using the GND subject vocabulary. Our approach\ncombines traditional natural language processing and machine learning\ntechniques implemented in the Annif toolkit with innovative LLM-based methods\nfor translation and synthetic data generation, and merging predictions from\nmonolingual models. The system ranked first in the all-subjects category and\nsecond in the tib-core-subjects category in the quantitative evaluation, and\nfourth in qualitative evaluations. These findings demonstrate the potential of\ncombining traditional XMTC algorithms with modern LLM techniques to improve the\naccuracy and efficiency of subject indexing in multilingual contexts."

To solve this main challenge, in\nthis paper, we introduce DeepThink3D to enhance the tool usage of LLMs in\ncomplex 3D situated reasoning tasks. Our work proposes a combinatorial and\niterative evolutionary approach on the SQA3D benchmark to generate more complex\nquestions. Building on this foundation, we fine-tune the large language model\nto make it more proficient in using 3D tools.

The selection of\npredictors is crucial, strongly impacting both model accuracy and how well the\npredictions reflect ecological patterns. To ensure meaningful insights, input\nvariables must be carefully chosen to match the study objectives and the\necological requirements of the target species. However, existing SDMs,\nincluding both traditional and deep learning-based approaches, often lack key\ncapabilities for variable selection: (i) flexibility to choose relevant\npredictors at inference without retraining; (ii) robustness to handle missing\npredictor values without compromising accuracy; and (iii) explainability to\ninterpret and accurately quantify each predictor's contribution. To overcome\nthese limitations, we introduce MaskSDM, a novel deep learning-based SDM that\nenables flexible predictor selection by employing a masked training strategy.\nThis approach allows the model to make predictions with arbitrary subsets of\ninput variables while remaining robust to missing data. It also provides a\nclearer understanding of how adding or removing a given predictor affects model\nperformance and predictions. Additionally, MaskSDM leverages Shapley values for\nprecise predictor contribution assessments, improving upon traditional\napproximations. We evaluate MaskSDM on the global sPlotOpen dataset, modeling\nthe distributions of 12,738 plant species. Our results show that MaskSDM\noutperforms imputation-based methods and approximates models trained on\nspecific subsets of variables.

We curate and manually annotate a novel\nHebrew-language corpus of 10,410 sentences drawn from Knesset speeches\n(1993-2023), Facebook posts (2018-2021), and leading news outlets, of which\n1,812 instances (17.4\\%) exhibit PDD and 642 carry additional annotations for\nintensity, incivility, target type, and affective framing. We introduce a\ntwo-stage classification pipeline combining finetuned encoder models and\ndecoder LLMs. Our best model (DictaLM 2.0) attains an F$_1$ of 0.74 for binary\nPDD detection and a macro-F$_1$ of 0.67 for classification of delegitimization\ncharacteristics. Applying this classifier to longitudinal and cross-platform\ndata, we see a marked rise in PDD over three decades, higher prevalence on\nsocial media versus parliamentary debate, greater use by male than female\npoliticians, and stronger tendencies among right-leaning actors - with\npronounced spikes during election campaigns and major political events. Our\nfindings demonstrate the feasibility and value of automated PDD analysis for\nunderstanding democratic discourse.",

We curate and manually annotate a novel\nHebrew-language corpus of 10,410 sentences drawn from Knesset speeches\n(1993-2023), Facebook posts (2018-2021), and leading news outlets, of which\n1,812 instances (17.4\\%) exhibit PDD and 642 carry additional annotations for\nintensity, incivility, target type, and affective framing. We introduce a\ntwo-stage classification pipeline combining finetuned encoder models and\ndecoder LLMs. Our best model (DictaLM 2.0) attains an F$_1$ of 0.74 for binary\nPDD detection and a macro-F$_1$ of 0.67 for classification of delegitimization\ncharacteristics. Applying this classifier to longitudinal and cross-platform\ndata, we see a marked rise in PDD over three decades, higher prevalence on\nsocial media versus parliamentary debate, greater use by male than female\npoliticians, and stronger tendencies among right-leaning actors - with\npronounced spikes during election campaigns and major political events. Our\nfindings demonstrate the feasibility and value of automated PDD analysis for\nunderstanding democratic discourse."

Each mode allows for textual explanations of predictions.\nTo assess the performance of our system, we introduce an open-source benchmark,\nPubMed Retraction, comprising over 11K real-world biomedical articles,\nincluding metadata and retraction labels. We show that, across all modes,\nPub-Guard-LLM consistently surpasses the performance of various baselines and\nprovides more reliable explanations, namely explanations which are deemed more\nrelevant and coherent than those generated by the baselines when evaluated by\nmultiple assessment methods.

In this paper, we consider the general problem of\nobtaining distribution-free valid prediction regions for an outcome given\ncoarsened training data. Leveraging modern semiparametric theory, we achieve\nour goal by deriving the efficient influence function of the quantile of the\noutcome we aim to predict, under a given semiparametric model for the coarsened\ndata, carefully combined with a novel conformal risk control procedure. Our\nprincipled use of semiparametric theory has the key advantage of facilitating\nflexible machine learning methods such as random forests to learn the\nunderlying nuisance functions of the semiparametric model. A straightforward\napplication of the proposed general framework produces prediction intervals\nwith stronger coverage properties under covariate shift, as well as the\nconstruction of multiply robust prediction sets in monotone missingness\nscenarios. We further illustrate the performance of our methods through various\nsimulation studies.",

Leveraging modern semiparametric theory, we achieve\nour goal by deriving the efficient influence function of the quantile of the\noutcome we aim to predict, under a given semiparametric model for the coarsened\ndata, carefully combined with a novel conformal risk control procedure. Our\nprincipled use of semiparametric theory has the key advantage of facilitating\nflexible machine learning methods such as random forests to learn the\nunderlying nuisance functions of the semiparametric model. A straightforward\napplication of the proposed general framework produces prediction intervals\nwith stronger coverage properties under covariate shift, as well as the\nconstruction of multiply robust prediction sets in monotone missingness\nscenarios. We further illustrate the performance of our methods through various\nsimulation studies."

Social media platforms amplify the\nimpact of sexism by conveying discriminatory content not only through text but\nalso across multiple modalities, highlighting the critical need for a\nmultimodal approach to the analysis of sexism online. With the rise of social\nmedia platforms where users share short videos, sexism is increasingly\nspreading through video content. Automatically detecting sexism in videos is a\nchallenging task, as it requires analyzing the combination of verbal, audio,\nand visual elements to identify sexist content. In this study, (1) we introduce\nMuSeD, a new Multimodal Spanish dataset for Sexism Detection consisting of\n$\\approx$ 11 hours of videos extracted from TikTok and BitChute; (2) we propose\nan innovative annotation framework for analyzing the contributions of textual,\nvocal, and visual modalities to the classification of content as either sexist\nor non-sexist; and (3) we evaluate a range of large language models (LLMs) and\nmultimodal LLMs on the task of sexism detection. We find that visual\ninformation plays a key role in labeling sexist content for both humans and\nmodels. Models effectively detect explicit sexism; however, they struggle with\nimplicit cases, such as stereotypes, instances where annotators also show low\nagreement.

To solve\nthis, a bespoke dataset containing annotated photos of car surfaces under\nvarious lighting circumstances, angles, and textures was created. To improve\nrobustness, the YOLOv8m model and its customized variants, YOLOv8m-t4 and\nYOLOv8m-t42, were trained employing real-time data augmentation approaches.\nExperimental results show that the technique has excellent detection accuracy\nand low inference latency, making it suited for real-time applications such as\nautomated insurance evaluations and automobile inspections. Evaluation\nparameters such as mean Average Precision (mAP), precision, recall, and\nF1-score verified the model's efficacy. With a precision of 0.86, recall of\n0.84, and F1-score of 0.85, the YOLOv8m-t42 model outperformed the YOLOv8m-t4\nmodel (precision: 0.81, recall: 0.79, F1-score: 0.80) in identifying\nmicroscopic surface defects. With a little reduced mAP@0.5:0.95 of 0.20, the\nmAP@0.5 for YOLOv8m-t42 stabilized at 0.60. Furthermore, YOLOv8m-t42's PR curve\narea was 0.88, suggesting more consistent performance than YOLOv8m-t4 (0.82).\nYOLOv8m-t42 has greater accuracy and is more appropriate for practical dent\ndetection applications, even though its convergence is slower.",

Then, a Global\nTemporal Motion Fusion (GTMF) module is developed to further aggregate the\nglobal propagation feature with the local fusion feature.

While the\ndesign of kirigami metamaterials has been widely studied, the simulation of the\ndeployment and shape transformation process is less explored. In this work, we\ndevelop PyKirigami, an efficient Python-based open-source computational tool\nfor the deployment simulation of kirigami metamaterials. In particular, our\ntool is capable of simulating both two- and three-dimensional deployments of a\nlarge variety of kirigami metamaterials with different geometric, topological,\nand physical properties. Altogether, our work paves a new way for the modelling\nand design of shape-morphing mechanical metamaterials."

Our key observations are that outer momentum can be locally\napproximated by an error feedback combined with aggressive sparsity and that\nsparse aggregation can actually improve model performance.

Finally, in our third case study (Human-assistive AI), we\nshow how NiceWebRL can allow researchers to study how an LLM can assist humans\non complex tasks in XLand-Minigrid, an environment with millions of\nhierarchical tasks. The library is available at\nhttps://github.com/KempnerInstitute/nicewebrl."

To\novercome these limitations, we first propose a novel multi-bit weight\nrepresentation technique, termed row-column hybrid grouping, which generalizes\nconventional column grouping by introducing redundancy across both rows and\ncolumns. This structural redundancy enhances fault tolerance and can be\neffectively combined with existing fault-mitigation solutions. Second, we\ndesign a compiler pipeline that reformulates the fault-aware weight\ndecomposition problem as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) task, enabling\nfast and scalable compilation through off-the-shelf solvers. Further\nacceleration is achieved through theoretical insights that identify fault\npatterns amenable to trivial solutions, significantly reducing computation.\nExperimental results on convolutional networks and small language models\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving up to 8%p improvement\nin accuracy, 150x faster compilation, and 2x energy efficiency gain compared to\nexisting baselines.",

This study\ninvestigates the efficacy of the Real-Time Detection Transformer (RT-DETR), a\nstate-of-the-art, end-to-end object detection model, for the automated\ndetection and counting of beach litter. A rigorous comparative analysis is\nconducted between two model variants, RT-DETR-Large (RT-DETR-L) and\nRT-DETR-Extra-Large (RT-DETR-X), trained on a publicly available dataset of\ncoastal debris. The evaluation reveals that the RT-DETR-X model achieves\nmarginally superior accuracy, with a mean Average Precision at 50\\% IoU\n(mAP@50) of 0.816 and a mAP@50-95 of 0.612, compared to the RT-DETR-L model's\n0.810 and 0.606, respectively. However, this minor performance gain is realized\nat a significant computational cost; the RT-DETR-L model demonstrates a\nsubstantially faster inference time of 20.1 ms versus 34.5 ms for the\nRT-DETR-X. The findings suggest that the RT-DETR-L model offers a more\npractical and efficient solution for real-time, in-field deployment due to its\nsuperior balance of processing speed and detection accuracy.

Inspired by the ancient Greek\nagora, Agoran distributes authority across three autonomous AI branches: a\nLegislative branch that answers compliance queries using retrieval-augmented\nLarge Language Models (LLMs); an Executive branch that maintains real-time\nsituational awareness through a watcher-updated vector database; and a Judicial\nbranch that evaluates each agent message with a rule-based Trust Score, while\narbitrating LLMs detect malicious behavior and apply real-time incentives to\nrestore trust. Stakeholder-side Negotiation Agents and the SRB-side Mediator\nAgent negotiate feasible, Pareto-optimal offers produced by a multi-objective\noptimizer, reaching a consensus intent in a single round, which is then\ndeployed to Open and AI RAN controllers. Deployed on a private 5G testbed and\nevaluated with realistic traces of vehicle mobility, Agoran achieved\nsignificant gains: (i) a 37% increase in throughput of eMBB slices, (ii) a 73%\nreduction in latency of URLLC slices, and concurrently (iii) an end-to-end 8.3%\nsaving in PRB usage compared to a static baseline. An 1B-parameter Llama model,\nfine-tuned for five minutes on 100 GPT-4 dialogues, recovers approximately 80%\nof GPT-4.1's decision quality, while operating within 6 GiB of memory and\nconverging in only 1.3 seconds.

                "summary": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), particularly Interaction Networks (INs), have\nshown exceptional performance for jet tagging at the CERN High-Luminosity Large\nHadron Collider (HL-LHC). However, their computational complexity and irregular\nmemory access patterns pose significant challenges for deployment on FPGAs in\nhardware trigger systems, where strict latency and resource constraints apply.\nIn this work, we propose JEDI-linear, a novel GNN architecture with linear\ncomputational complexity that eliminates explicit pairwise interactions by\nleveraging shared transformations and global aggregation. To further enhance\nhardware efficiency, we introduce fine-grained quantization-aware training with\nper-parameter bitwidth optimization and employ multiplier-free\nmultiply-accumulate operations via distributed arithmetic. Evaluation results\nshow that our FPGA-based JEDI-linear achieves 3.7 to 11.5 times lower latency,\nup to 150 times lower initiation interval, and up to 6.2 times lower LUT usage\ncompared to state-of-the-art designs while also delivering higher model\naccuracy and eliminating the need for DSP blocks entirely. In contrast,\nstate-of-the-art solutions consume over 8,700 DSPs.

However, their computational complexity and irregular\nmemory access patterns pose significant challenges for deployment on FPGAs in\nhardware trigger systems, where strict latency and resource constraints apply.\nIn this work, we propose JEDI-linear, a novel GNN architecture with linear\ncomputational complexity that eliminates explicit pairwise interactions by\nleveraging shared transformations and global aggregation. To further enhance\nhardware efficiency, we introduce fine-grained quantization-aware training with\nper-parameter bitwidth optimization and employ multiplier-free\nmultiply-accumulate operations via distributed arithmetic. Evaluation results\nshow that our FPGA-based JEDI-linear achieves 3.7 to 11.5 times lower latency,\nup to 150 times lower initiation interval, and up to 6.2 times lower LUT usage\ncompared to state-of-the-art designs while also delivering higher model\naccuracy and eliminating the need for DSP blocks entirely. In contrast,\nstate-of-the-art solutions consume over 8,700 DSPs. This is the first\ninteraction-based GNN to achieve less than 60~ns latency and currently meets\nthe requirements for use in the HL-LHC CMS Level-1 trigger system.

Social media platforms amplify the\nimpact of sexism by conveying discriminatory content not only through text but\nalso across multiple modalities, highlighting the critical need for a\nmultimodal approach to the analysis of sexism online. With the rise of social\nmedia platforms where users share short videos, sexism is increasingly\nspreading through video content. Automatically detecting sexism in videos is a\nchallenging task, as it requires analyzing the combination of verbal, audio,\nand visual elements to identify sexist content. In this study, (1) we introduce\nMuSeD, a new Multimodal Spanish dataset for Sexism Detection consisting of\n$\\approx$ 11 hours of videos extracted from TikTok and BitChute; (2) we propose\nan innovative annotation framework for analyzing the contributions of textual,\nvocal, and visual modalities to the classification of content as either sexist\nor non-sexist; and (3) we evaluate a range of large language models (LLMs) and\nmultimodal LLMs on the task of sexism detection. We find that visual\ninformation plays a key role in labeling sexist content for both humans and\nmodels. Models effectively detect explicit sexism; however, they struggle with\nimplicit cases, such as stereotypes, instances where annotators also show low\nagreement. This highlights the inherent difficulty of the task, as identifying\nimplicit sexism depends on the social and cultural context.",

In particular, since models may store unsafe knowledge\ninternally, machine unlearning has emerged as a representative paradigm to\nensure model safety. Existing approaches employ various training techniques,\nsuch as gradient ascent and negative preference optimization, in attempts to\neliminate the influence of undesired data on target models. However, these\nmethods merely suppress the activation of undesired data through parametric\ntraining without completely eradicating its informational traces within the\nmodel. This fundamental limitation makes it difficult to achieve effective\ncontinuous unlearning, rendering these methods vulnerable to relearning\nattacks. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Metamorphosis\nRepresentation Projection (MRP) approach that pioneers the application of\nirreversible projection properties to machine unlearning. By implementing\nprojective transformations in the hidden state space of specific network\nlayers, our method effectively eliminates harmful information while preserving\nuseful knowledge. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach enables\neffective continuous unlearning and successfully defends against relearning\nattacks, achieving state-of-the-art performance in unlearning effectiveness\nwhile preserving natural performance.

Extensive experiments\nconducted on representative audio classification models--including AST, PANNs,\nSSAST, and AudioMAE--consistently demonstrate substantial performance\nimprovements, thereby validating the generalizability and effectiveness of the\nproposed approach in enhancing label reliability.The code is publicly available\nat: https://github.com/colaudiolab/AudioSet-R."

This design enables to provide a\nquantitative basis for understanding retrieval-centric LLM behavior in finance.\nWe evaluate a suite of state-of-the-art models and further demonstrated how\ntargeted fine-tuning can significantly improve agentic retrieval performance.\nOur benchmark provides a foundation for studying retrieval-centric LLM behavior\nin complex, domain-specific tasks for finance. We will release the dataset\npublicly upon acceptance of the paper and plan to expand and share dataset for\nthe full S&P 500 and beyond."

Our extensive experiments reveal significant vulnerabilities in\ncurrent models, including a gap between trustworthiness and general\ncapabilities, as well as the amplification of potential risks in base LLMs by\nboth multimodal training and inference. Moreover, our controlled analysis\nuncovers key limitations in existing mitigation strategies that, while some\nmethods yield improvements in specific aspects, few effectively address overall\ntrustworthiness, and many introduce unexpected trade-offs that compromise model\nutility.

                "summary": "Well-designed prompts are crucial for enhancing Large language models' (LLMs)\nreasoning capabilities while aligning their outputs with task requirements\nacross diverse domains. However, manually designed prompts require expertise\nand iterative experimentation. While existing prompt optimization methods aim\nto automate this process, they rely heavily on external references such as\nground truth or by humans, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios\nwhere such data is unavailable or costly to obtain. To address this, we propose\nSelf-Supervised Prompt Optimization (SPO), a cost-efficient framework that\ndiscovers effective prompts for both closed and open-ended tasks without\nrequiring external reference. Motivated by the observations that prompt quality\nmanifests directly in LLM outputs and LLMs can effectively assess adherence to\ntask requirements, we derive evaluation and optimization signals purely from\noutput comparisons. Specifically, SPO selects superior prompts through pairwise\noutput comparisons evaluated by an LLM evaluator, followed by an LLM optimizer\nthat aligns outputs with task requirements. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat SPO outperforms state-of-the-art prompt optimization methods, achieving\ncomparable or superior results with significantly lower costs (e.g., 1.1% to\n5.6% of existing methods) and fewer samples (e.g., three samples).

                    "value": "Well-designed prompts are crucial for enhancing Large language models' (LLMs)\nreasoning capabilities while aligning their outputs with task requirements\nacross diverse domains. However, manually designed prompts require expertise\nand iterative experimentation. While existing prompt optimization methods aim\nto automate this process, they rely heavily on external references such as\nground truth or by humans, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios\nwhere such data is unavailable or costly to obtain. To address this, we propose\nSelf-Supervised Prompt Optimization (SPO), a cost-efficient framework that\ndiscovers effective prompts for both closed and open-ended tasks without\nrequiring external reference. Motivated by the observations that prompt quality\nmanifests directly in LLM outputs and LLMs can effectively assess adherence to\ntask requirements, we derive evaluation and optimization signals purely from\noutput comparisons. Specifically, SPO selects superior prompts through pairwise\noutput comparisons evaluated by an LLM evaluator, followed by an LLM optimizer\nthat aligns outputs with task requirements. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat SPO outperforms state-of-the-art prompt optimization methods, achieving\ncomparable or superior results with significantly lower costs (e.g., 1.1% to\n5.6% of existing methods) and fewer samples (e.g., three samples). The code is\navailable at https://github.com/FoundationAgents/SPO."

In the literature,\nthis task is formulated either as metric clustering over pre-trained text\nembeddings or as graph clustering based on pairwise similarities derived from\nan oracle, e.g., a large machine learning model. Recent advances in large\nlanguage models (LLMs) have significantly improved this field by providing\nhigh-quality contextualized embeddings and accurate semantic similarity\nestimates. However, leveraging LLMs at scale introduces substantial\ncomputational and financial costs due to the large number of required API\nqueries or inference calls. To address this issue, we propose Cequel, a\ncost-effective framework that achieves accurate text clustering under a limited\nbudget of LLM queries. At its core, Cequel constructs must-link and cannot-link\nconstraints by selectively querying LLMs on informative text pairs or triplets,\nidentified via our proposed algorithms, EdgeLLM and TriangleLLM. These\nconstraints are then utilized in a weighted constrained clustering algorithm to\nform high-quality clusters. Specifically, EdgeLLM and TriangleLLM employ\ncarefully designed greedy selection strategies and prompting techniques to\nidentify and extract informative constraints efficiently. Experiments on\nmultiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that Cequel consistently outperforms\nexisting methods in unsupervised text clustering under the same query budget.",
