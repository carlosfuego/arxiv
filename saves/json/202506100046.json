We explore an alternative: training a smaller KV cache offline on\neach corpus. At inference time, we load this trained KV cache, which we call a\nCartridge, and decode a response. Critically, the cost of training a Cartridge\ncan be amortized across all the queries referencing the same corpus. However,\nwe find that the naive approach of training the Cartridge with next-token\nprediction on the corpus is not competitive with ICL. Instead, we propose\nself-study, a training recipe in which we generate synthetic conversations\nabout the corpus and train the Cartridge with a context-distillation objective.\nWe find that Cartridges trained with self-study replicate the functionality of\nICL, while being significantly cheaper to serve. On challenging long-context\nbenchmarks, Cartridges trained with self-study match ICL performance while\nusing 38.6x less memory and enabling 26.4x higher throughput. Self-study also\nextends the model's effective context length (e.g. from 128k to 484k tokens on\nMTOB) and surprisingly, leads to Cartridges that can be composed at inference\ntime without retraining.",

To evaluate its applicability in a realistic detector environment, two\nR12699-406-M2 units were deployed in a small-scale dual-phase xenon time\nprojection chamber. The segmented $2\\times2$ anode structure enabled lateral\nposition reconstruction using a single photomultiplier tube, highlighting the\npotential of the sensor for effective event localization in future detectors."

Recently, In-context\nConditioning emerged as a powerful paradigm for unified conditional video\ngeneration, which enables diverse controls by concatenating varying context\nconditioning signals with noisy video latents into a long unified token\nsequence and jointly processing them via full-attention, e.g., FullDiT. Despite\ntheir effectiveness, these methods face quadratic computation overhead as task\ncomplexity increases, hindering practical deployment. In this paper, we study\nthe efficiency bottleneck neglected in original in-context conditioning video\ngeneration framework. We begin with systematic analysis to identify two key\nsources of the computation inefficiencies: the inherent redundancy within\ncontext condition tokens and the computational redundancy in context-latent\ninteractions throughout the diffusion process. Based on these insights, we\npropose FullDiT2, an efficient in-context conditioning framework for general\ncontrollability in both video generation and editing tasks, which innovates\nfrom two key perspectives. Firstly, to address the token redundancy, FullDiT2\nleverages a dynamic token selection mechanism to adaptively identify important\ncontext tokens, reducing the sequence length for unified full-attention.\nAdditionally, a selective context caching mechanism is devised to minimize\nredundant interactions between condition tokens and video latents. Extensive\nexperiments on six diverse conditional video editing and generation tasks\ndemonstrate that FullDiT2 achieves significant computation reduction and 2-3\ntimes speedup in averaged time cost per diffusion step, with minimal\ndegradation or even higher performance in video generation quality.

To\nreduce the cost of auto-regressive decoding, Key-Value (KV) cache is used to\nstore intermediate activations, which significantly lowers the computational\noverhead for token generation.

To address\nthis issue, we propose Adaptive holistic attention KV (AhaKV), it addresses the\nbias of the accumulated attention score by adaptively tuning the scale of\nsoftmax according the expectation of information entropy of attention scores.\nTo make use of the holistic attention information in self-attention mechanism,\nAhaKV utilize the information of value vectors, which is overlooked in previous\nworks, to refine the adaptive score. We show theoretically that our method is\nwell suited for bias reduction. We deployed AhaKV on different models with a\nfixed cache budget. Experiments show that AhaKV successfully mitigates bias and\nretains crucial tokens across global context and achieve state-of-the-art\nresults against other related work on several benchmark tasks."

A common observation is that DiT latent noise vectors change slowly\nacross inference steps, which suggests that the DiT compute may be redundant\nacross steps. In this paper, we aim to speed up inference by reducing this\nredundancy, without additional training. We first study how activations change\nbetween steps in two state-of-the-art open-source DiTs. We find that just 5-25%\nof the values in attention and MLP explain 70-90% of the change in activations\nacross steps. This finding motivates our approach, Chipmunk, which uses dynamic\nsparsity at inference time to recompute only the fastest-changing intermediate\nactivations, while caching the rest. Dynamic sparsity introduces two systems\nchallenges: (1) sparse attention and MLP operations tend to underutilize GPU\ntensor cores; and (2) computing dynamic sparsity patterns at runtime and\ncaching activations both introduce overhead. To address these challenges,\nChipmunk first uses a voxel-based reordering of input tokens to introduce\ncolumn-wise sparsity. We implement column-sparse kernels utilizing efficient\nsparse gathers from global to shared GPU memory, achieving a 9.3x speedup at\n93% sparsity compared to highly-optimized dense baselines. Second, Chipmunk\noverlaps the computation of sparsity patterns and cache updates with other\nparts of the computation (e.g., second layer of the MLP) to hide the extra\nlatency.

Furthermore, we show that\nChipmunk can be stacked on top of full step caching, achieving a 3.72x speedup\non HunyuanVideo, a 2.67x speedup on WAN2.1, and a 2.25x speedup on FLUX.1-dev\nwith minimal quality impact.",

It also outperforms baselines on Infinite-Bench and MM-NIAH,\ndemonstrating flexibility across diverse tasks and domains. Additionally,\nREFORM reduces inference time by 30% and peak memory usage by 5%, achieving\nboth efficiency and superior performance."

While\npromising, they commonly rely on two optimistic assumptions: 1) full access to\nthe parameters of a PTM, and 2) sufficient memory capacity to cache all\nintermediate activations for gradient computation. However, in most real-world\napplications, PTMs serve as black-box APIs or proprietary software without full\nparameter accessibility. Besides, it is hard to meet a large memory requirement\nfor modern PTMs. This work proposes black-box visual prompting (BlackVIP),\nwhich efficiently adapts the PTMs without knowledge of their architectures or\nparameters. BlackVIP has two components: 1) Coordinator and 2) simultaneous\nperturbation stochastic approximation with gradient correction (SPSA-GC). The\nCoordinator designs input-dependent visual prompts, which allow the target PTM\nto adapt in the wild. SPSA-GC efficiently estimates the gradient of PTM to\nupdate Coordinator. Besides, we introduce a variant, BlackVIP-SE, which\nsignificantly reduces the runtime and computational cost of BlackVIP. Extensive\nexperiments on 19 datasets demonstrate that BlackVIPs enable robust adaptation\nto diverse domains and tasks with minimal memory requirements.

In addition, an Image Error\nProxy-Guided Objective (IEPO) is applied to balance image quality against cache\nutilization through an efficient proxy to approximate the image error.\nExtensive experiments across $8$ models, $4$ samplers, and resolutions from\n$256\\times256$ to $2K$ demonstrate superior performance and speedup of our\nframework. For instance, it achieves over $40\\%$ latency reduction (i.e.,\n$2.07\\times$ theoretical speedup) and improved performance on PixArt-$\\alpha$.\nRemarkably, our image-free approach reduces training time by $25\\%$ compared\nwith the previous method. Our code is available at\nhttps://github.com/ModelTC/HarmoniCa."

Existing methods\nfor WSN anomaly detection often face challenges such as the limited extraction\nof spatiotemporal correlation features, the absence of sample labels, few\nanomaly samples, and an imbalanced sample distribution. To address these\nissues, a spatiotemporal correlation detection model (MTAD-RD) considering both\nmodel architecture and a two-stage training strategy perspective is proposed.\nIn terms of model structure design, the proposed MTAD-RD backbone network\nincludes a retentive network (RetNet) enhanced by a cross-retention (CR)\nmodule, a multigranular feature fusion module, and a graph attention network\nmodule to extract internode correlation information. This proposed model can\nintegrate the intermodal correlation features and spatial features of WSN\nneighbor nodes while extracting global information from time series data.\nMoreover, its serialized inference characteristic can remarkably reduce\ninference overhead. For model training, a two-stage training approach was\ndesigned. First, a contrastive learning proxy task was designed for time series\ndata with graph structure information in WSNs, enabling the backbone network to\nlearn transferable features from unlabeled data using unsupervised contrastive\nlearning methods, thereby addressing the issue of missing sample labels in the\ndataset. Then, a caching-based sample sampler was designed to divide samples\ninto few-shot and contrastive learning data. A specific joint loss function was\ndeveloped to jointly train the dual-graph discriminator network to address the\nproblem of sample imbalance effectively.

To reduce the computational\ncost of offline calibration, we utilize the intra-layer KV precision pair\npruning and inter-layer clustering to reduce the search space. Experimental\nresults show that we can achieve nearly lossless 3.25-bit mixed precision KV\ncache quantization for LLMs like Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and 4.0-bit for\nsensitive models like Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct on mathematical reasoning tasks. The\nmaximum inference throughput can be improved by 21.25\\% compared with KIVI-KV8\nquantization over various context lengths. Our code and searched configurations\nare available at https://github.com/cmd2001/KVTuner."

However, natural language exhibits inherent semantic\nhierarchies and nuanced geometric structure, which current LLMs do not capture\ncompletely owing to their reliance on Euclidean operations. Recent studies have\nalso shown that not respecting the geometry of token embeddings leads to\ntraining instabilities and degradation of generative capabilities. These\nfindings suggest that shifting to non-Euclidean geometries can better align\nlanguage models with the underlying geometry of text. We thus propose to\noperate fully in Hyperbolic space, known for its expansive, scale-free, and\nlow-distortion properties. We thus introduce HELM, a family of HypErbolic Large\nLanguage Models, offering a geometric rethinking of the Transformer-based LLM\nthat addresses the representational inflexibility, missing set of necessary\noperations, and poor scalability of existing hyperbolic LMs. We additionally\nintroduce a Mixture-of-Curvature Experts model, HELM-MICE, where each expert\noperates in a distinct curvature space to encode more fine-grained geometric\nstructure from text, as well as a dense model, HELM-D. For HELM-MICE, we\nfurther develop hyperbolic Multi-Head Latent Attention (HMLA) for efficient,\nreduced-KV-cache training and inference. For both models, we develop essential\nhyperbolic equivalents of rotary positional encodings and RMS normalization. We\nare the first to train fully hyperbolic LLMs at billion-parameter scale, and\nevaluate them on well-known benchmarks such as MMLU and ARC, spanning STEM\nproblem-solving, general knowledge, and commonsense reasoning. Our results show\nconsistent gains from our HELM architectures -- up to 4% -- over popular\nEuclidean architectures used in LLaMA and DeepSeek, highlighting the efficacy\nand enhanced reasoning afforded by hyperbolic geometry in large-scale LM\npretraining.",

Our method enables\nserving LLaMA-7B with a context length of up to 1 million on a single A100-80GB\nGPU and up to 10 million on an 8-GPU system. We develop custom CUDA kernels for\nKVQuant, showing that we can achieve up to ~1.7x speedups, compared to baseline\nfp16 matrix-vector multiplications, for the LLaMA-7B model."

Prefetching has been shown to be an\neffective solution, especially with contiguous data structures that follow the\ntraditional principles of spatial and temporal locality. However, on linked\ndata structures$-$made up of many nodes linked together with pointers$-$typical\nprefetchers struggle, failing to predict accesses as elements are arbitrarily\nscattered throughout memory and access patters are arbitrarily complex and\nhence difficult to predict. To remedy these issues, we introduce\n$\\textit{Linkey}$, a novel prefetcher that utilizes hints from the\nprogrammer/compiler to cache layout information and accurately prefetch linked\ndata structures. $\\textit{Linkey}$ obtains substantial performance improvements\nover a striding baseline.

At a high level,\neigenspectrum analysis of DNNs involves measuring the heavytailness of the\nempirical spectral densities (ESD) of weight matrices. It provides insight into\nhow well a model is trained and can guide decisions on assigning better\nlayer-wise training hyperparameters. In this paper, we address a challenge\nassociated with such eigenspectrum methods: the impact of the aspect ratio of\nweight matrices on estimated heavytailness metrics. We demonstrate that\nmatrices of varying sizes (and aspect ratios) introduce a non-negligible bias\nin estimating heavytailness metrics, leading to inaccurate model diagnosis and\nlayer-wise hyperparameter assignment. To overcome this challenge, we propose\nFARMS (Fixed-Aspect-Ratio Matrix Subsampling), a method that normalizes the\nweight matrices by subsampling submatrices with a fixed aspect ratio. Instead\nof measuring the heavytailness of the original ESD, we measure the average ESD\nof these subsampled submatrices. We show that measuring the heavytailness of\nthese submatrices with the fixed aspect ratio can effectively mitigate the\naspect ratio bias. We validate our approach across various optimization\ntechniques and application domains that involve eigenspectrum analysis of\nweights, including image classification in computer vision (CV) models,\nscientific machine learning (SciML) model training, and large language model\n(LLM) pruning. Our results show that despite its simplicity, FARMS uniformly\nimproves the accuracy of eigenspectrum analysis while enabling more effective\nlayer-wise hyperparameter assignment in these application domains. In one of\nthe LLM pruning experiments, FARMS reduces the perplexity of the LLaMA-7B model\nby 17.3% when compared with the state-of-the-art method.",

This paper introduces MEDAL, an automated multi-agent\nframework for generating, evaluating, and curating more representative and\ndiverse open-domain dialogue evaluation benchmarks. Our approach leverages\nseveral state-of-the-art LLMs to generate user-chatbot multilingual dialogues,\nconditioned on varied seed contexts. A strong LLM (GPT-4.1) is then used for a\nmultidimensional analysis of the performance of the chatbots, uncovering\nnoticeable cross-lingual performance differences. Guided by this large-scale\nevaluation, we curate a new meta-evaluation multilingual benchmark and\nhuman-annotate samples with nuanced quality judgments. This benchmark is then\nused to assess the ability of several reasoning and non-reasoning LLMs to act\nas evaluators of open-domain dialogues. We find that current LLMs struggle to\ndetect nuanced issues, particularly those involving empathy and reasoning.",

This paper introduces MEDAL, an automated multi-agent\nframework for generating, evaluating, and curating more representative and\ndiverse open-domain dialogue evaluation benchmarks. Our approach leverages\nseveral state-of-the-art LLMs to generate user-chatbot multilingual dialogues,\nconditioned on varied seed contexts. A strong LLM (GPT-4.1) is then used for a\nmultidimensional analysis of the performance of the chatbots, uncovering\nnoticeable cross-lingual performance differences. Guided by this large-scale\nevaluation, we curate a new meta-evaluation multilingual benchmark and\nhuman-annotate samples with nuanced quality judgments. This benchmark is then\nused to assess the ability of several reasoning and non-reasoning LLMs to act\nas evaluators of open-domain dialogues. We find that current LLMs struggle to\ndetect nuanced issues, particularly those involving empathy and reasoning."

Despite their potential, current LLM agents often adopt a\none-size-fits-all approach, lacking the flexibility to respond to users'\nvarying needs and preferences.

In contrast to conventional reasoning benchmarks\nconsisting of tasks with clear instructions, puzzlehunts require models to\ndiscover the underlying problem structure from multimodal evidence and\niterative reasoning, mirroring real-world domains such as scientific discovery,\nexploratory data analysis, or investigative problem-solving. Despite recent\nprogress in foundation models, their performance on such open-ended settings\nremains largely untested. In this paper, we introduce PuzzleWorld, a\nlarge-scale benchmark of 667 puzzlehunt-style problems designed to assess\nstep-by-step, open-ended, and creative multimodal reasoning. Each puzzle is\nannotated with the final solution, detailed reasoning traces, and cognitive\nskill labels, enabling holistic benchmarking and fine-grained diagnostic\nanalysis. Most state-of-the-art models achieve only 1-2% final answer accuracy,\nwith the best model solving only 14% of puzzles and reaching 40% stepwise\naccuracy. To demonstrate the value of our reasoning annotations, we show that\nfine-tuning a small model on reasoning traces improves stepwise reasoning from\n4% to 11%, while training on final answers alone degrades performance to near\nzero. Our error analysis reveals that current models exhibit myopic reasoning,\nare bottlenecked by the limitations of language-based inference, and lack\nsketching capabilities crucial for visual and spatial reasoning.

Key contributions include\nthe creation of neurology-specific datasets (case reports, QA sets,\ntextbook-derived data), tools for multi-word expression extraction, and\ngraph-based analyses of medical terminology. The project also produced scripts\nand Docker containers for local hosting. Performance metrics and graph\ncommunity results are reported, with future possible work open for multimodal\nmodels using open-source architectures like phi-4."

Our holistic analysis, spanning models from 0.6B to\n32B parameters, reveals a new Kinetics Scaling Law that better guides resource\nallocation by incorporating both computation and memory access costs. Kinetics\nScaling Law suggests that test-time compute is more effective when used on\nmodels above a threshold than smaller ones. A key reason is that in TTS,\nattention, rather than parameter count, emerges as the dominant cost factor.\nMotivated by this, we propose a new scaling paradigm centered on sparse\nattention, which lowers per-token cost and enables longer generations and more\nparallel samples within the same resource budget. Empirically, we show that\nsparse attention models consistently outperform dense counterparts, achieving\nover 60 points gains in low-cost regimes and over 5 points gains in high-cost\nregimes for problem-solving accuracy on AIME, encompassing evaluations on\nstate-of-the-art MoEs. These results suggest that sparse attention is essential\nand increasingly important with more computing invested, for realizing the full\npotential of test-time scaling where, unlike training, accuracy has yet to\nsaturate as a function of computation, and continues to improve through\nincreased generation.

We introduce an online\nmistake detection framework that handles both procedural and execution errors\n(e.g., motor slips or tool misuse). Upon detecting an error, we use a large\nlanguage model (LLM) to generate explanatory feedback.

This approach significantly expands LLM capabilities by leveraging\nvast, up-to-date external knowledge. However, this reliance on external\nknowledge makes RAG systems vulnerable to corpus poisoning attacks that\nmanipulate generated outputs via poisoned document injection. Existing\npoisoning attack strategies typically treat the retrieval and generation stages\nas disjointed, limiting their effectiveness. We propose Joint-GCG, the first\nframework to unify gradient-based attacks across both retriever and generator\nmodels through three innovations: (1) Cross-Vocabulary Projection for aligning\nembedding spaces, (2) Gradient Tokenization Alignment for synchronizing\ntoken-level gradient signals, and (3) Adaptive Weighted Fusion for dynamically\nbalancing attacking objectives. Evaluations demonstrate that Joint-GCG achieves\nat most 25% and an average of 5% higher attack success rate than previous\nmethods across multiple retrievers and generators. While optimized under a\nwhite-box assumption, the generated poisons show unprecedented transferability\nto unseen models. Joint-GCG's innovative unification of gradient-based attacks\nacross retrieval and generation stages fundamentally reshapes our understanding\nof vulnerabilities within RAG systems.

Existing\npoisoning attack strategies typically treat the retrieval and generation stages\nas disjointed, limiting their effectiveness. We propose Joint-GCG, the first\nframework to unify gradient-based attacks across both retriever and generator\nmodels through three innovations: (1) Cross-Vocabulary Projection for aligning\nembedding spaces, (2) Gradient Tokenization Alignment for synchronizing\ntoken-level gradient signals, and (3) Adaptive Weighted Fusion for dynamically\nbalancing attacking objectives. Evaluations demonstrate that Joint-GCG achieves\nat most 25% and an average of 5% higher attack success rate than previous\nmethods across multiple retrievers and generators. While optimized under a\nwhite-box assumption, the generated poisons show unprecedented transferability\nto unseen models. Joint-GCG's innovative unification of gradient-based attacks\nacross retrieval and generation stages fundamentally reshapes our understanding\nof vulnerabilities within RAG systems.

                "summary": "Growing concerns over data privacy and security highlight the importance of\nmachine unlearning--removing specific data influences from trained models\nwithout full retraining. Techniques like Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs)\nare widely used to externally assess successful unlearning. However, existing\nmethods face two key limitations: (1) maximizing MIA effectiveness (e.g., via\nonline attacks) requires prohibitive computational resources, often exceeding\nretraining costs; (2) MIAs, designed for binary inclusion tests, struggle to\ncapture granular changes in approximate unlearning. To address these\nchallenges, we propose the Interpolated Approximate Measurement (IAM), a\nframework natively designed for unlearning inference. IAM quantifies\nsample-level unlearning completeness by interpolating the model's\ngeneralization-fitting behavior gap on queried samples.

                    "value": "Growing concerns over data privacy and security highlight the importance of\nmachine unlearning--removing specific data influences from trained models\nwithout full retraining. Techniques like Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs)\nare widely used to externally assess successful unlearning. However, existing\nmethods face two key limitations: (1) maximizing MIA effectiveness (e.g., via\nonline attacks) requires prohibitive computational resources, often exceeding\nretraining costs; (2) MIAs, designed for binary inclusion tests, struggle to\ncapture granular changes in approximate unlearning. To address these\nchallenges, we propose the Interpolated Approximate Measurement (IAM), a\nframework natively designed for unlearning inference. IAM quantifies\nsample-level unlearning completeness by interpolating the model's\ngeneralization-fitting behavior gap on queried samples.

But these MLLMs are good at analyzing short videos,\nwhile suffering from difficulties in understanding videos with a longer\ncontext. To address this difficulty, several agent paradigms have recently been\nproposed, using MLLMs as agents for retrieving extra contextual knowledge in a\nlong video. However, most existing agents ignore the key fact that a long video\nis composed with multiple shots, i.e., to answer the user question from a long\nvideo, it is critical to deeply understand its relevant shots like human.\nWithout such insight, these agents often mistakenly find redundant even noisy\ntemporal context, restricting their capacity for long video understanding. To\nfill this gap, we propose VideoChat-A1, a novel long video agent paradigm.\nDifferent from the previous works, our VideoChat-A1 can deeply think with long\nvideos, via a distinct chain-of-shot reasoning paradigm. More specifically, it\ncan progressively select the relevant shots of user question, and look into\nthese shots in a coarse-to-fine partition. By multi-modal reasoning along the\nshot chain, VideoChat-A1 can effectively mimic step-by-step human thinking\nprocess, allowing to interactively discover preferable temporal context for\nthoughtful understanding in long videos. Extensive experiments show that, our\nVideoChat-A1 achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the mainstream long\nvideo QA benchmarks, e.g., it achieves 77.0 on VideoMME and 70.1 on EgoSchema,\noutperforming its strong baselines (e.g., Intern2.5VL-8B and\nInternVideo2.5-8B), by up to 10.8\\% and 6.2\\%.

As the core component of LLMs, accelerating\nTransformer through parallelization has gradually become a hot research topic.\nMask layers introduce sparsity into Transformer to reduce calculations.\nHowever, previous works rarely focus on the performance optimization of sparse\nTransformer. Moreover, rule-based mechanisms ignore the fusion opportunities of\nmixed-type operators and fail to adapt to various sequence lengths. To address\nthe above problems, we propose STOF, a framework that incorporates\noptimizations for Sparse Transformer via flexible masking and operator fusion\non GPU. We firstly unify the storage format and kernel implementation for the\nmulti-head attention. Then, we map fusion schemes to compilation templates and\ndetermine the optimal parameter setting through a two-stage search engine. The\nexperimental results show that compared to the state-of-the-art work, STOF\nachieves maximum speedups of 1.7x in MHA computation and 1.5x in end-to-end\ninference.",

As the core component of LLMs, accelerating\nTransformer through parallelization has gradually become a hot research topic.\nMask layers introduce sparsity into Transformer to reduce calculations.\nHowever, previous works rarely focus on the performance optimization of sparse\nTransformer. Moreover, rule-based mechanisms ignore the fusion opportunities of\nmixed-type operators and fail to adapt to various sequence lengths. To address\nthe above problems, we propose STOF, a framework that incorporates\noptimizations for Sparse Transformer via flexible masking and operator fusion\non GPU. We firstly unify the storage format and kernel implementation for the\nmulti-head attention. Then, we map fusion schemes to compilation templates and\ndetermine the optimal parameter setting through a two-stage search engine. The\nexperimental results show that compared to the state-of-the-art work, STOF\nachieves maximum speedups of 1.7x in MHA computation and 1.5x in end-to-end\ninference."

To solve this\nissue, we propose ProofAug, a procedure that equips LLMs with automation\nmethods at various granularities through fine-grained structure analysis of\nmodel-generated proof proposals.

Existing agent search methods suffer from three major\nlimitations: (1) an emphasis on optimizing agentic workflows while\nunder-utilizing proven human-designed components such as memory, planning, and\ntool use; (2) high evaluation costs, as each newly generated agent must be\nfully evaluated on benchmarks; and (3) inefficient search in large search\nspace. In this work, we introduce a comprehensive framework to address these\nchallenges. First, We propose a hierarchical search space that jointly models\nagentic workflow and composable functional components, enabling richer agentic\nsystem designs. Building on this structured design space, we introduce a\npredictive value model that estimates agent performance given agentic system\nand task description, allowing for efficient, low-cost evaluation during the\nsearch process. Finally, we present a hierarchical Monte Carlo Tree Search\n(MCTS) strategy informed by uncertainty to guide the search. Experiments on\nseven benchmarks, covering embodied, math, web, tool, and game, show that our\nmethod achieves an average performance gain of 8.34\\% over state-of-the-art\nbaselines and exhibits faster search progress with steeper improvement\ntrajectories.

There is insufficient empirical analysis of the\nquestions answered in ERRs.

The study analyzes\n72 ERRs sentence-by-sentence, classifying their 4940 sentences into 169 unique\nquestion archetypes. We did not predefine the questions but derived them solely\nfrom the statements in the ERRs. This approach provides an unbiased view of the\ncontent of the observed ERRs. Subsequently, we used public corporate reports to\nclassify the questions' potential for automation. Answers were labeled\n\"text-extractable\" if the answers to the question were accessible in corporate\nreports. 78.7% of the questions in ERRs can be automated. Those automatable\nquestion consist of 48.2% text-extractable (suited to processing by large\nlanguage models, LLMs) and 30.5% database-extractable questions. Only 21.3% of\nquestions require human judgment to answer. We empirically validate using\nLlama-3-70B and GPT-4-turbo-2024-04-09 that recent advances in language\ngeneration and information extraction enable the automation of approximately\n80% of the statements in ERRs. Surprisingly, the models complement each other's\nstrengths and weaknesses well. The research confirms that the current writing\nprocess of ERRs can likely benefit from additional automation, improving\nquality and efficiency. The research thus allows us to quantify the potential\nimpacts of introducing large language models in the ERR writing process. The\nfull question list, including the archetypes and their frequency, will be made\navailable online after peer review.",

As an empirical proof of concept, we use LLMs to generate\ndocuments relevant to a topic which are more retrievable than existing ones.

Discrete stellar kinematics probe\nthe mass distribution of a stellar system, and chemical tracers such as stellar\nmetallicity can further separate multiple stellar populations that can have\ndistinct kinematic properties. We took advantage of the information provided by\ndiscrete stellar kinematics and the metallicity in the Galactic centre using\ndiscrete chemo-dynamical modelling. We fitted axisymmetric Jeans models to\ndiscrete data of 4,600 stars. We fitted the stars as either one population plus\na background component or as two populations plus a background that represents\nthe bar. We tested the robustness of the inferred gravitational potential\nagainst a varying mass of the supermassive black hole, including dark matter,\nor a radially varying mass-to-light ratio. We obtained robust results on the\nfit with a single population and a background component. We obtained a\nsupermassive black hole mass of (4.35$\\pm 0.24) \\times 10^6$ M$_\\odot$, and we\nfind that a dark matter component and radial variation in the mass-to-light\nratio are negligible. We derived the enclosed mass profile of the inner ~60 pc\nand found a lower mass than reported in the literature in the region of ~5-30\npc. In our two-population fit, we found a high-[M/H] population that\ncontributes more than 90% to the total stellar density. The properties of the\nhigh-[M/H] population are consistent with in situ formation after gas inflow\nfrom the Galactic disc via the bar.

                "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly transforming the landscape of\ndigital content creation. However, the prevalent black-box Application\nProgramming Interface (API) access to many LLMs introduces significant\nchallenges in accountability, governance, and security. LLM fingerprinting,\nwhich aims to identify the source model by analyzing statistical and stylistic\nfeatures of generated text, offers a potential solution. Current progress in\nthis area is hindered by a lack of dedicated datasets and the need for\nefficient, practical methods that are robust against adversarial manipulations.\nTo address these challenges, we introduce FD-Dataset, a comprehensive bilingual\nfingerprinting benchmark comprising 90,000 text samples from 20 famous\nproprietary and open-source LLMs. Furthermore, we present FDLLM, a novel\nfingerprinting method that leverages parameter-efficient Low-Rank Adaptation\n(LoRA) to fine-tune a foundation model. This approach enables LoRA to extract\ndeep, persistent features that characterize each source LLM. Through our\nanalysis, we find that LoRA adaptation promotes the aggregation of outputs from\nthe same LLM in representation space while enhancing the separation between\ndifferent LLMs. This mechanism explains why LoRA proves particularly effective\nfor LLM fingerprinting. Extensive empirical evaluations on FD-Dataset\ndemonstrate FDLLM's superiority, achieving a Macro F1 score 22.1% higher than\nthe strongest baseline. FDLLM also exhibits strong generalization to newly\nreleased models, achieving an average accuracy of 95% on unseen models.\nNotably, FDLLM remains consistently robust under various adversarial attacks,\nincluding polishing, translation, and synonym substitution. Experimental\nresults show that FDLLM reduces the average attack success rate from 49.2%\n(LM-D) to 23.9%.",

                    "value": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly transforming the landscape of\ndigital content creation. However, the prevalent black-box Application\nProgramming Interface (API) access to many LLMs introduces significant\nchallenges in accountability, governance, and security. LLM fingerprinting,\nwhich aims to identify the source model by analyzing statistical and stylistic\nfeatures of generated text, offers a potential solution. Current progress in\nthis area is hindered by a lack of dedicated datasets and the need for\nefficient, practical methods that are robust against adversarial manipulations.\nTo address these challenges, we introduce FD-Dataset, a comprehensive bilingual\nfingerprinting benchmark comprising 90,000 text samples from 20 famous\nproprietary and open-source LLMs. Furthermore, we present FDLLM, a novel\nfingerprinting method that leverages parameter-efficient Low-Rank Adaptation\n(LoRA) to fine-tune a foundation model. This approach enables LoRA to extract\ndeep, persistent features that characterize each source LLM. Through our\nanalysis, we find that LoRA adaptation promotes the aggregation of outputs from\nthe same LLM in representation space while enhancing the separation between\ndifferent LLMs. This mechanism explains why LoRA proves particularly effective\nfor LLM fingerprinting. Extensive empirical evaluations on FD-Dataset\ndemonstrate FDLLM's superiority, achieving a Macro F1 score 22.1% higher than\nthe strongest baseline. FDLLM also exhibits strong generalization to newly\nreleased models, achieving an average accuracy of 95% on unseen models.\nNotably, FDLLM remains consistently robust under various adversarial attacks,\nincluding polishing, translation, and synonym substitution. Experimental\nresults show that FDLLM reduces the average attack success rate from 49.2%\n(LM-D) to 23.9%."

Lastly, we show that JSAEs achieve a\ngreater degree of computational sparsity on pre-trained LLMs than on the\nequivalent randomized LLM.

We find that JSAEs extract a relatively large degree\nof computational sparsity while preserving downstream LLM performance\napproximately as well as traditional SAEs. We also show that Jacobians are a\nreasonable proxy for computational sparsity because MLPs are approximately\nlinear when rewritten in the JSAE basis. Lastly, we show that JSAEs achieve a\ngreater degree of computational sparsity on pre-trained LLMs than on the\nequivalent randomized LLM. This shows that the sparsity of the computational\ngraph appears to be a property that LLMs learn through training, and suggests\nthat JSAEs might be more suitable for understanding learned transformer\ncomputations than standard SAEs."

At a high level,\neigenspectrum analysis of DNNs involves measuring the heavytailness of the\nempirical spectral densities (ESD) of weight matrices. It provides insight into\nhow well a model is trained and can guide decisions on assigning better\nlayer-wise training hyperparameters. In this paper, we address a challenge\nassociated with such eigenspectrum methods: the impact of the aspect ratio of\nweight matrices on estimated heavytailness metrics. We demonstrate that\nmatrices of varying sizes (and aspect ratios) introduce a non-negligible bias\nin estimating heavytailness metrics, leading to inaccurate model diagnosis and\nlayer-wise hyperparameter assignment. To overcome this challenge, we propose\nFARMS (Fixed-Aspect-Ratio Matrix Subsampling), a method that normalizes the\nweight matrices by subsampling submatrices with a fixed aspect ratio. Instead\nof measuring the heavytailness of the original ESD, we measure the average ESD\nof these subsampled submatrices. We show that measuring the heavytailness of\nthese submatrices with the fixed aspect ratio can effectively mitigate the\naspect ratio bias. We validate our approach across various optimization\ntechniques and application domains that involve eigenspectrum analysis of\nweights, including image classification in computer vision (CV) models,\nscientific machine learning (SciML) model training, and large language model\n(LLM) pruning. Our results show that despite its simplicity, FARMS uniformly\nimproves the accuracy of eigenspectrum analysis while enabling more effective\nlayer-wise hyperparameter assignment in these application domains. In one of\nthe LLM pruning experiments, FARMS reduces the perplexity of the LLaMA-7B model\nby 17.3% when compared with the state-of-the-art method.",

We demonstrate that\nmatrices of varying sizes (and aspect ratios) introduce a non-negligible bias\nin estimating heavytailness metrics, leading to inaccurate model diagnosis and\nlayer-wise hyperparameter assignment. To overcome this challenge, we propose\nFARMS (Fixed-Aspect-Ratio Matrix Subsampling), a method that normalizes the\nweight matrices by subsampling submatrices with a fixed aspect ratio. Instead\nof measuring the heavytailness of the original ESD, we measure the average ESD\nof these subsampled submatrices. We show that measuring the heavytailness of\nthese submatrices with the fixed aspect ratio can effectively mitigate the\naspect ratio bias. We validate our approach across various optimization\ntechniques and application domains that involve eigenspectrum analysis of\nweights, including image classification in computer vision (CV) models,\nscientific machine learning (SciML) model training, and large language model\n(LLM) pruning. Our results show that despite its simplicity, FARMS uniformly\nimproves the accuracy of eigenspectrum analysis while enabling more effective\nlayer-wise hyperparameter assignment in these application domains. In one of\nthe LLM pruning experiments, FARMS reduces the perplexity of the LLaMA-7B model\nby 17.3% when compared with the state-of-the-art method."

Realizing this vision\nrequires addressing fundamental challenges: ensuring physical consistency, and\ndeveloping robust verification methods. We call for collaborative efforts\nbetween physics and AI communities to help advance scientific discovery in\nphysics."

We introduce an online\nmistake detection framework that handles both procedural and execution errors\n(e.g., motor slips or tool misuse). Upon detecting an error, we use a large\nlanguage model (LLM) to generate explanatory feedback.

This approach significantly expands LLM capabilities by leveraging\nvast, up-to-date external knowledge. However, this reliance on external\nknowledge makes RAG systems vulnerable to corpus poisoning attacks that\nmanipulate generated outputs via poisoned document injection. Existing\npoisoning attack strategies typically treat the retrieval and generation stages\nas disjointed, limiting their effectiveness. We propose Joint-GCG, the first\nframework to unify gradient-based attacks across both retriever and generator\nmodels through three innovations: (1) Cross-Vocabulary Projection for aligning\nembedding spaces, (2) Gradient Tokenization Alignment for synchronizing\ntoken-level gradient signals, and (3) Adaptive Weighted Fusion for dynamically\nbalancing attacking objectives. Evaluations demonstrate that Joint-GCG achieves\nat most 25% and an average of 5% higher attack success rate than previous\nmethods across multiple retrievers and generators. While optimized under a\nwhite-box assumption, the generated poisons show unprecedented transferability\nto unseen models. Joint-GCG's innovative unification of gradient-based attacks\nacross retrieval and generation stages fundamentally reshapes our understanding\nof vulnerabilities within RAG systems.

                    "value": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enhance Large Language Models\n(LLMs) by retrieving relevant documents from external corpora before generating\nresponses. This approach significantly expands LLM capabilities by leveraging\nvast, up-to-date external knowledge. However, this reliance on external\nknowledge makes RAG systems vulnerable to corpus poisoning attacks that\nmanipulate generated outputs via poisoned document injection. Existing\npoisoning attack strategies typically treat the retrieval and generation stages\nas disjointed, limiting their effectiveness. We propose Joint-GCG, the first\nframework to unify gradient-based attacks across both retriever and generator\nmodels through three innovations: (1) Cross-Vocabulary Projection for aligning\nembedding spaces, (2) Gradient Tokenization Alignment for synchronizing\ntoken-level gradient signals, and (3) Adaptive Weighted Fusion for dynamically\nbalancing attacking objectives. Evaluations demonstrate that Joint-GCG achieves\nat most 25% and an average of 5% higher attack success rate than previous\nmethods across multiple retrievers and generators. While optimized under a\nwhite-box assumption, the generated poisons show unprecedented transferability\nto unseen models. Joint-GCG's innovative unification of gradient-based attacks\nacross retrieval and generation stages fundamentally reshapes our understanding\nof vulnerabilities within RAG systems.

However, they typically rely on aggregated labels-often\nvia majority voting-which can obscure the human disagreement inherent in\nsubjective annotations. This study examines whether LLMs can capture multiple\nperspectives and reflect annotator disagreement in subjective tasks such as\nhate speech and offensive language detection. We use in-context learning (ICL)\nin zero-shot and few-shot settings, evaluating four open-source LLMs across\nthree label modeling strategies: aggregated hard labels, and disaggregated hard\nand soft labels. In few-shot prompting, we assess demonstration selection\nmethods based on textual similarity (BM25, PLM-based), annotation disagreement\n(entropy), a combined ranking, and example ordering strategies (random vs.\ncurriculum-based). Results show that multi-perspective generation is viable in\nzero-shot settings, while few-shot setups often fail to capture the full\nspectrum of human judgments. Prompt design and demonstration selection notably\naffect performance, though example ordering has limited impact.

However, they typically rely on aggregated labels-often\nvia majority voting-which can obscure the human disagreement inherent in\nsubjective annotations. This study examines whether LLMs can capture multiple\nperspectives and reflect annotator disagreement in subjective tasks such as\nhate speech and offensive language detection. We use in-context learning (ICL)\nin zero-shot and few-shot settings, evaluating four open-source LLMs across\nthree label modeling strategies: aggregated hard labels, and disaggregated hard\nand soft labels. In few-shot prompting, we assess demonstration selection\nmethods based on textual similarity (BM25, PLM-based), annotation disagreement\n(entropy), a combined ranking, and example ordering strategies (random vs.\ncurriculum-based). Results show that multi-perspective generation is viable in\nzero-shot settings, while few-shot setups often fail to capture the full\nspectrum of human judgments. Prompt design and demonstration selection notably\naffect performance, though example ordering has limited impact. These findings\nhighlight the challenges of modeling subjectivity with LLMs and the importance\nof building more perspective-aware, socially intelligent models."

Here we define the Cooperative Mission Replanning Problem as a\nnovel variant of multiple TSP with adaptations to overcome these issues, and\ndevelop a new encoder/decoder-based model using Graph Attention Networks and\nAttention Models to solve it effectively and efficiently. Using a simple\nexample of cooperative drones, we show our replanner consistently (90% of the\ntime) maintains performance within 10% of the state-of-the-art LKH3 heuristic\nsolver, whilst running 85-370 times faster on a Raspberry Pi.

To ground LLMs in high-quality medical knowledge, LLMs have\nbeen equipped with external knowledge via RAG, where unstructured medical\nknowledge is split into small text chunks that can be selectively retrieved and\nintegrated into the LLMs context.

Systematic approaches to organize medical knowledge to\nbest surface it to LLMs are generally lacking. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce MIRIAD, a large-scale, curated corpus of 5,821,948 medical QA pairs,\neach rephrased from and grounded in a passage from peer-reviewed medical\nliterature using a semi-automated pipeline combining LLM generation, filtering,\ngrounding, and human annotation.

To solve this\nissue, we propose ProofAug, a procedure that equips LLMs with automation\nmethods at various granularities through fine-grained structure analysis of\nmodel-generated proof proposals.

In this work, we introduce a comprehensive framework to address these\nchallenges. First, We propose a hierarchical search space that jointly models\nagentic workflow and composable functional components, enabling richer agentic\nsystem designs. Building on this structured design space, we introduce a\npredictive value model that estimates agent performance given agentic system\nand task description, allowing for efficient, low-cost evaluation during the\nsearch process. Finally, we present a hierarchical Monte Carlo Tree Search\n(MCTS) strategy informed by uncertainty to guide the search.

There is insufficient empirical analysis of the\nquestions answered in ERRs. In particular, it is not understood how frequently\ncertain information appears, what information is considered essential, and what\ninformation requires human judgment to distill into an ERR. The study analyzes\n72 ERRs sentence-by-sentence, classifying their 4940 sentences into 169 unique\nquestion archetypes. We did not predefine the questions but derived them solely\nfrom the statements in the ERRs. This approach provides an unbiased view of the\ncontent of the observed ERRs. Subsequently, we used public corporate reports to\nclassify the questions' potential for automation. Answers were labeled\n\"text-extractable\" if the answers to the question were accessible in corporate\nreports. 78.7% of the questions in ERRs can be automated. Those automatable\nquestion consist of 48.2% text-extractable (suited to processing by large\nlanguage models, LLMs) and 30.5% database-extractable questions. Only 21.3% of\nquestions require human judgment to answer. We empirically validate using\nLlama-3-70B and GPT-4-turbo-2024-04-09 that recent advances in language\ngeneration and information extraction enable the automation of approximately\n80% of the statements in ERRs. Surprisingly, the models complement each other's\nstrengths and weaknesses well. The research confirms that the current writing\nprocess of ERRs can likely benefit from additional automation, improving\nquality and efficiency. The research thus allows us to quantify the potential\nimpacts of introducing large language models in the ERR writing process. The\nfull question list, including the archetypes and their frequency, will be made\navailable online after peer review.",

However, their capacity for metacognition - particularly\nin predicting memory performance - remains unexplored. Here, we introduce a\ncross-agent prediction model to assess whether ChatGPT-based LLMs align with\nhuman judgments of learning (JOL), a metacognitive measure where individuals\npredict their own future memory performance. We tested humans and LLMs on pairs\nof sentences, one of which was a garden-path sentence - a sentence that\ninitially misleads the reader toward an incorrect interpretation before\nrequiring reanalysis. By manipulating contextual fit (fitting vs. unfitting\nsentences), we probed how intrinsic cues (i.e., relatedness) affect both LLM\nand human JOL. Our results revealed that while human JOL reliably predicted\nactual memory performance, none of the tested LLMs (GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4-turbo,\nand GPT-4o) demonstrated comparable predictive accuracy.

However, their capacity for metacognition - particularly\nin predicting memory performance - remains unexplored. Here, we introduce a\ncross-agent prediction model to assess whether ChatGPT-based LLMs align with\nhuman judgments of learning (JOL), a metacognitive measure where individuals\npredict their own future memory performance. We tested humans and LLMs on pairs\nof sentences, one of which was a garden-path sentence - a sentence that\ninitially misleads the reader toward an incorrect interpretation before\nrequiring reanalysis. By manipulating contextual fit (fitting vs. unfitting\nsentences), we probed how intrinsic cues (i.e., relatedness) affect both LLM\nand human JOL. Our results revealed that while human JOL reliably predicted\nactual memory performance, none of the tested LLMs (GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4-turbo,\nand GPT-4o) demonstrated comparable predictive accuracy.

Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promise in automating\ncounter-response generation to mitigate misinformation, but a critical\nchallenge lies in their tendency to hallucinate non-factual information.\nExisting models mainly rely on LLM self-feedback to reduce hallucination, but\nthis approach is computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose\nMisMitiFact, Misinformation Mitigation grounded in Facts, an efficient\nframework for generating fact-grounded counter-responses at scale. MisMitiFact\ngenerates simple critique feedback to refine LLM outputs, ensuring responses\nare grounded in evidence. We develop lightweight, fine-grained critique models\ntrained on data sourced from readily available fact-checking sites to identify\nand correct errors in key elements such as numerals, entities, and topics in\nLLM generations. Experiments show that MisMitiFact generates counter-responses\nof comparable quality to LLMs' self-feedback while using significantly smaller\ncritique models.

MHR\nis inspired by EAM to perform frontier exploration decision-making, avoiding\nthe circuitous trajectories in long-range scenarios to improve path efficiency.\nExperimental results demonstrate that the EAM module achieves 64.5\\% scene\nmapping accuracy on MP3D dataset, while the navigation task attains SPLs of\n28.4\\% and 26.3\\% on HM3D and MP3D benchmarks respectively - representing\nabsolute improvements of 21.4\\% and 46.0\\% over baseline methods."

In this paper, we introduce a novel\nbackpropagation-free PTQ algorithm that optimizes quantized weights by\nconsidering inter-layer dependencies. The key innovation is the development of\nattention-aware Hessian matrices that capture inter-layer interactions within\nthe attention module.
