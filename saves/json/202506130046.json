This work proposes\nNestQuant, a novel PTQ scheme for weights and activations that is based on\nself-similar nested lattices. Recent works have mathematically shown such\nquantizers to be information-theoretically optimal for low-precision matrix\nmultiplication.

It addresses the longstanding issue of exposure bias, where\nmodels trained on ground-truth context must generate sequences conditioned on\ntheir own imperfect outputs during inference. Unlike prior methods that denoise\nfuture frames based on ground-truth context frames, Self Forcing conditions\neach frame's generation on previously self-generated outputs by performing\nautoregressive rollout with key-value (KV) caching during training. This\nstrategy enables supervision through a holistic loss at the video level that\ndirectly evaluates the quality of the entire generated sequence, rather than\nrelying solely on traditional frame-wise objectives. To ensure training\nefficiency, we employ a few-step diffusion model along with a stochastic\ngradient truncation strategy, effectively balancing computational cost and\nperformance. We further introduce a rolling KV cache mechanism that enables\nefficient autoregressive video extrapolation. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat our approach achieves real-time streaming video generation with sub-second\nlatency on a single GPU, while matching or even surpassing the generation\nquality of significantly slower and non-causal diffusion models.

                    "value": "We introduce Self Forcing, a novel training paradigm for autoregressive video\ndiffusion models. It addresses the longstanding issue of exposure bias, where\nmodels trained on ground-truth context must generate sequences conditioned on\ntheir own imperfect outputs during inference. Unlike prior methods that denoise\nfuture frames based on ground-truth context frames, Self Forcing conditions\neach frame's generation on previously self-generated outputs by performing\nautoregressive rollout with key-value (KV) caching during training. This\nstrategy enables supervision through a holistic loss at the video level that\ndirectly evaluates the quality of the entire generated sequence, rather than\nrelying solely on traditional frame-wise objectives. To ensure training\nefficiency, we employ a few-step diffusion model along with a stochastic\ngradient truncation strategy, effectively balancing computational cost and\nperformance. We further introduce a rolling KV cache mechanism that enables\nefficient autoregressive video extrapolation. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat our approach achieves real-time streaming video generation with sub-second\nlatency on a single GPU, while matching or even surpassing the generation\nquality of significantly slower and non-causal diffusion models.

Second, we design a\nlightweight router-only fine-tuning process to train MoQAE with a comprehensive\nloss to learn the trade-off between model accuracy and memory usage. Finally,\nwe introduce a routing freezing (RF) and a routing sharing (RS) mechanism to\nfurther reduce the inference overhead. Extensive experiments on multiple\nbenchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art KV\ncache quantization approaches in both efficiency and effectiveness."

Experiments on a wide\nrange of long context tasks show that MiniKV effectively achieves 86% KV cache\ncompression ratio while recovering over 98.5% of accuracy, outperforming\nstate-of-the-art methods while achieving excellent measured system performance\nimprovements."

We reveal that conventional\ninference scaling techniques, despite their success in reasoning tasks, perform\npoorly in safety contexts, even falling short of basic approaches like\nBest-of-N Sampling. We attribute this inefficiency to a newly identified\nchallenge, the exploration--efficiency dilemma, arising from the high\ncomputational overhead associated with frequent process reward model (PRM)\nevaluations. To overcome this dilemma, we propose SAFFRON, a novel inference\nscaling paradigm tailored explicitly for safety assurance. Central to our\napproach is the introduction of a multifurcation reward model (MRM) that\nsignificantly reduces the required number of reward model evaluations. To\noperationalize this paradigm, we further propose: (i) a partial supervision\ntraining objective for MRM, (ii) a conservative exploration constraint to\nprevent out-of-distribution explorations, and (iii) a Trie-based key--value\ncaching strategy that facilitates cache sharing across sequences during tree\nsearch. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method.\nAdditionally, we publicly release our trained multifurcation reward model\n(Saffron-1) and the accompanying token-level safety reward dataset (Safety4M)\nto accelerate future research in LLM safety.

To\naddress this challenge, we propose Lumina, a hardware-algorithm co-designed\nsystem, which integrates two principal optimizations: a novel algorithm, S^2,\nand a radiance caching mechanism, RC, to improve the efficiency of neural\nrendering. S2 algorithm exploits temporal coherence in rendering to reduce the\ncomputational overhead, while RC leverages the color integration process of\n3DGS to decrease the frequency of intensive rasterization computations. Coupled\nwith these techniques, we propose an accelerator architecture, LuminCore, to\nfurther accelerate cache lookup and address the fundamental inefficiencies in\nRasterization.

                    "value": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has vastly advanced the pace of neural\nrendering, but it remains computationally demanding on today's mobile SoCs. To\naddress this challenge, we propose Lumina, a hardware-algorithm co-designed\nsystem, which integrates two principal optimizations: a novel algorithm, S^2,\nand a radiance caching mechanism, RC, to improve the efficiency of neural\nrendering. S2 algorithm exploits temporal coherence in rendering to reduce the\ncomputational overhead, while RC leverages the color integration process of\n3DGS to decrease the frequency of intensive rasterization computations. Coupled\nwith these techniques, we propose an accelerator architecture, LuminCore, to\nfurther accelerate cache lookup and address the fundamental inefficiencies in\nRasterization. We show that Lumina achieves 4.5x speedup and 5.3x energy\nreduction against a mobile Volta GPU, with a marginal quality loss (< 0.2 dB\npeak signal-to-noise ratio reduction) across synthetic and real-world datasets."

Hence, we explore inference-time\nhyper-scaling: by compressing the KV cache, we can generate more tokens within\nthe same compute budget and further improve the accuracy of scaled inference.\nThe success of this approach, however, hinges on the ability of compression\nmethods to preserve accuracy even at high compression ratios.

Instead of prematurely discarding cached\ntokens, DMS delays token eviction, implicitly merging representations and\npreserving critical information. We demonstrate the effectiveness of\ninference-time hyper-scaling with DMS on multiple families of LLMs, showing\nthat it boosts accuracy for comparable inference runtime and memory load.

We show that vectors with compression\nratios up to x1500 exist, which highlights two orders of magnitude gap between\nexisting and practically attainable solutions. Furthermore, we empirically show\nthat the compression limits are determined not by the length of the input but\nby the amount of uncertainty to be reduced, namely, the cross-entropy loss on\nthis sequence without any conditioning.

Using ICCD\nimaging, distinct ionization channels are recorded in the rising part of the\npulsed voltage being detached from the driven electrode; during the voltage\ndecrease, a glow-like discharge is formed remaining anchored on the driven\nelectrode. The rising part of the AC voltage is characterized by erratic,\nelongated ionization channels in a filamentary form, the voltage drop featuring\na glow-like behavior.

Recently, In-context\nConditioning emerged as a powerful paradigm for unified conditional video\ngeneration, which enables diverse controls by concatenating varying context\nconditioning signals with noisy video latents into a long unified token\nsequence and jointly processing them via full-attention, e.g., FullDiT. Despite\ntheir effectiveness, these methods face quadratic computation overhead as task\ncomplexity increases, hindering practical deployment. In this paper, we study\nthe efficiency bottleneck neglected in original in-context conditioning video\ngeneration framework. We begin with systematic analysis to identify two key\nsources of the computation inefficiencies: the inherent redundancy within\ncontext condition tokens and the computational redundancy in context-latent\ninteractions throughout the diffusion process. Based on these insights, we\npropose FullDiT2, an efficient in-context conditioning framework for general\ncontrollability in both video generation and editing tasks, which innovates\nfrom two key perspectives. Firstly, to address the token redundancy, FullDiT2\nleverages a dynamic token selection mechanism to adaptively identify important\ncontext tokens, reducing the sequence length for unified full-attention.\nAdditionally, a selective context caching mechanism is devised to minimize\nredundant interactions between condition tokens and video latents. Extensive\nexperiments on six diverse conditional video editing and generation tasks\ndemonstrate that FullDiT2 achieves significant computation reduction and 2-3\ntimes speedup in averaged time cost per diffusion step, with minimal\ndegradation or even higher performance in video generation quality.

Recently, In-context\nConditioning emerged as a powerful paradigm for unified conditional video\ngeneration, which enables diverse controls by concatenating varying context\nconditioning signals with noisy video latents into a long unified token\nsequence and jointly processing them via full-attention, e.g., FullDiT. Despite\ntheir effectiveness, these methods face quadratic computation overhead as task\ncomplexity increases, hindering practical deployment. In this paper, we study\nthe efficiency bottleneck neglected in original in-context conditioning video\ngeneration framework. We begin with systematic analysis to identify two key\nsources of the computation inefficiencies: the inherent redundancy within\ncontext condition tokens and the computational redundancy in context-latent\ninteractions throughout the diffusion process. Based on these insights, we\npropose FullDiT2, an efficient in-context conditioning framework for general\ncontrollability in both video generation and editing tasks, which innovates\nfrom two key perspectives. Firstly, to address the token redundancy, FullDiT2\nleverages a dynamic token selection mechanism to adaptively identify important\ncontext tokens, reducing the sequence length for unified full-attention.\nAdditionally, a selective context caching mechanism is devised to minimize\nredundant interactions between condition tokens and video latents. Extensive\nexperiments on six diverse conditional video editing and generation tasks\ndemonstrate that FullDiT2 achieves significant computation reduction and 2-3\ntimes speedup in averaged time cost per diffusion step, with minimal\ndegradation or even higher performance in video generation quality.

While significant progress has been made in generating 3D objects\nfrom text or images, creating long-range, 3D-consistent, explorable 3D scenes\nremains a complex and challenging problem. In this work, we present Voyager, a\nnovel video diffusion framework that generates world-consistent 3D point-cloud\nsequences from a single image with user-defined camera path.

                "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for long-content\ngeneration (e.g., long Chain-of-Thought reasoning) where decoding efficiency\nbecomes a critical bottleneck: Autoregressive decoding is inherently limited by\nits sequential token generation process, where each token must be generated\nbefore the next can be processed. This sequential dependency restricts the\nability to fully leverage modern hardware's parallel processing capabilities.\nExisting methods like speculative decoding and layer skipping offer potential\nspeedups but have notable drawbacks: speculative decoding relies on an\nauxiliary \"drafter\" model, which can be challenging to acquire and increases\nmemory overhead, while layer skipping may introduce discrepancies in the\noutputs due to the missing key-value cache at skipped layers. In this work, we\npropose AdaDecode, which accelerates LLM decoding without requiring auxiliary\nmodels or changes to the original model parameters, while ensuring output\nconsistency. AdaDecode leverages the insight that many tokens can accurately be\ngenerated at intermediate layers, as further layers often do not significantly\nalter predictions once the model reaches a certain confidence. By adaptively\ngenerating tokens at intermediate layers when confidence is high, AdaDecode\nenables the next token's computation to begin immediately. The remaining layer\ncomputations for early-predicted tokens are deferred and executed in parallel\nwith subsequent tokens when needed, maximizing hardware utilization and\nreducing decoding latency. A final verification step ensures that early\npredictions match the results of standard autoregressive decoding, preserving\noutput parity. Experiments across diverse generation tasks shows that AdaDecode\nconsistently achieves superior decoding throughput with up to 1.73x speedup,\nwhile guaranteeing output parity with standard autoregressive decoding.",

                    "value": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for long-content\ngeneration (e.g., long Chain-of-Thought reasoning) where decoding efficiency\nbecomes a critical bottleneck: Autoregressive decoding is inherently limited by\nits sequential token generation process, where each token must be generated\nbefore the next can be processed. This sequential dependency restricts the\nability to fully leverage modern hardware's parallel processing capabilities.\nExisting methods like speculative decoding and layer skipping offer potential\nspeedups but have notable drawbacks: speculative decoding relies on an\nauxiliary \"drafter\" model, which can be challenging to acquire and increases\nmemory overhead, while layer skipping may introduce discrepancies in the\noutputs due to the missing key-value cache at skipped layers. In this work, we\npropose AdaDecode, which accelerates LLM decoding without requiring auxiliary\nmodels or changes to the original model parameters, while ensuring output\nconsistency. AdaDecode leverages the insight that many tokens can accurately be\ngenerated at intermediate layers, as further layers often do not significantly\nalter predictions once the model reaches a certain confidence. By adaptively\ngenerating tokens at intermediate layers when confidence is high, AdaDecode\nenables the next token's computation to begin immediately. The remaining layer\ncomputations for early-predicted tokens are deferred and executed in parallel\nwith subsequent tokens when needed, maximizing hardware utilization and\nreducing decoding latency. A final verification step ensures that early\npredictions match the results of standard autoregressive decoding, preserving\noutput parity. Experiments across diverse generation tasks shows that AdaDecode\nconsistently achieves superior decoding throughput with up to 1.73x speedup,\nwhile guaranteeing output parity with standard autoregressive decoding."

This observation suggests that information of\nthe segments between these separator tokens can be effectively condensed into\nthe separator tokens themselves without significant information loss. Guided by\nthis insight, we introduce SepLLM, a plug-and-play framework that accelerates\ninference by compressing these segments and eliminating redundant tokens.\nAdditionally, we implement efficient kernels for training acceleration.\nExperimental results across training-free, training-from-scratch, and\npost-training settings demonstrate SepLLM's effectiveness. Notably, using the\nLlama-3-8B backbone, SepLLM achieves over 50% reduction in KV cache on the\nGSM8K-CoT benchmark while maintaining comparable performance. Furthermore, in\nstreaming settings, SepLLM effectively processes sequences of up to 4 million\ntokens or more while maintaining consistent language modeling capabilities.",

Guided by\nthis insight, we introduce SepLLM, a plug-and-play framework that accelerates\ninference by compressing these segments and eliminating redundant tokens.\nAdditionally, we implement efficient kernels for training acceleration.\nExperimental results across training-free, training-from-scratch, and\npost-training settings demonstrate SepLLM's effectiveness. Notably, using the\nLlama-3-8B backbone, SepLLM achieves over 50% reduction in KV cache on the\nGSM8K-CoT benchmark while maintaining comparable performance. Furthermore, in\nstreaming settings, SepLLM effectively processes sequences of up to 4 million\ntokens or more while maintaining consistent language modeling capabilities."

These two memory systems have complementary but\nindividually limited properties: KV-memory offers precise retrieval but is\nconstrained by quadratic complexity in sequence length, while FW-memory\nsupports arbitrarily long sequences and enables more expressive computation but\nsacrifices precise recall. We propose and compare three methods to blend these\ntwo systems into a single memory system to leverage the strengths of both.

These two memory systems have complementary but\nindividually limited properties: KV-memory offers precise retrieval but is\nconstrained by quadratic complexity in sequence length, while FW-memory\nsupports arbitrarily long sequences and enables more expressive computation but\nsacrifices precise recall. We propose and compare three methods to blend these\ntwo systems into a single memory system to leverage the strengths of both.

                "summary": "Edge Intelligence (EI) serves as a critical enabler for privacy-preserving\nsystems by providing AI-empowered computation and distributed caching services\nat the edge, thereby minimizing latency and enhancing data privacy. The\nintegration of blockchain technology further augments EI frameworks by ensuring\ntransactional transparency, auditability, and system-wide reliability through a\ndecentralized network model. However, the operational architecture of such\nsystems introduces inherent vulnerabilities, particularly due to the extensive\ndata interactions between edge gateways (EGs) and the distributed nature of\ninformation storage during service provisioning. To address these challenges,\nwe propose an autonomous computing model along with its interaction topologies\ntailored for privacy-critical and time-sensitive health applications. The\nsystem supports continuous monitoring, real-time alert notifications, disease\ndetection, and robust data processing and aggregation.

                    "value": "Edge Intelligence (EI) serves as a critical enabler for privacy-preserving\nsystems by providing AI-empowered computation and distributed caching services\nat the edge, thereby minimizing latency and enhancing data privacy. The\nintegration of blockchain technology further augments EI frameworks by ensuring\ntransactional transparency, auditability, and system-wide reliability through a\ndecentralized network model. However, the operational architecture of such\nsystems introduces inherent vulnerabilities, particularly due to the extensive\ndata interactions between edge gateways (EGs) and the distributed nature of\ninformation storage during service provisioning. To address these challenges,\nwe propose an autonomous computing model along with its interaction topologies\ntailored for privacy-critical and time-sensitive health applications. The\nsystem supports continuous monitoring, real-time alert notifications, disease\ndetection, and robust data processing and aggregation.

However, current methods have three unsolved\nissues: overlooking layer-wise sensitivity to KV cache quantization, high\noverhead of online fine-grained decision-making, and low flexibility to\ndifferent LLMs and constraints. Therefore, we theoretically analyze the\ninherent correlation of layer-wise transformer attention patterns to KV cache\nquantization errors and study why key cache is generally more important than\nvalue cache for quantization error reduction.

To reduce the computational\ncost of offline calibration, we utilize the intra-layer KV precision pair\npruning and inter-layer clustering to reduce the search space. Experimental\nresults show that we can achieve nearly lossless 3.25-bit mixed precision KV\ncache quantization for LLMs like Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and 4.0-bit for\nsensitive models like Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct on mathematical reasoning tasks.

However,\nexisting methods primarily approach multimodal reasoning in a straightforward,\ntext-centric manner, where both reasoning and answer derivation are conducted\npurely through text, with the only difference being the presence of multimodal\ninput. As a result, these methods often encounter fundamental limitations in\nspatial reasoning tasks that demand precise geometric understanding and\ncontinuous spatial tracking-capabilities that humans achieve through mental\nvisualization and manipulation. To address the limitations, we propose drawing\nto reason in space, a novel paradigm that enables LVLMs to reason through\nelementary drawing operations in the visual space. By equipping models with\nbasic drawing operations, including annotating bounding boxes and drawing\nauxiliary lines, we empower them to express and analyze spatial relationships\nthrough direct visual manipulation, meanwhile avoiding the performance ceiling\nimposed by specialized perception tools in previous tool-integrated reasoning\napproaches. To cultivate this capability, we develop a three-stage training\nframework: cold-start training with synthetic data to establish basic drawing\nabilities, reflective rejection sampling to enhance self-reflection behaviors,\nand reinforcement learning to directly optimize for target rewards. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that our model, named VILASR, consistently outperforms\nexisting methods across diverse spatial reasoning benchmarks, involving maze\nnavigation, static spatial reasoning, video-based reasoning, and\nmulti-view-based reasoning tasks, with an average improvement of 18.4%.",

By equipping models with\nbasic drawing operations, including annotating bounding boxes and drawing\nauxiliary lines, we empower them to express and analyze spatial relationships\nthrough direct visual manipulation, meanwhile avoiding the performance ceiling\nimposed by specialized perception tools in previous tool-integrated reasoning\napproaches. To cultivate this capability, we develop a three-stage training\nframework: cold-start training with synthetic data to establish basic drawing\nabilities, reflective rejection sampling to enhance self-reflection behaviors,\nand reinforcement learning to directly optimize for target rewards. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that our model, named VILASR, consistently outperforms\nexisting methods across diverse spatial reasoning benchmarks, involving maze\nnavigation, static spatial reasoning, video-based reasoning, and\nmulti-view-based reasoning tasks, with an average improvement of 18.4%."

Leading this evolution are proprietary LLMs like GPT-4 and\nGPT-o1, which have captured widespread attention in the AI community due to\ntheir remarkable performance and versatility. Simultaneously, open-source LLMs,\nsuch as LLaMA, have made great contributions to the ever-increasing popularity\nof LLMs due to the ease to customize and deploy the models across diverse\napplications. Although open-source LLMs present unprecedented opportunities for\ninnovation and research, the commercialization of LLMs has raised concerns\nabout transparency, reproducibility, and safety. Many open-source LLMs fail to\nmeet fundamental transparency requirements by withholding essential components\nlike training code and data, which may hinder further innovations on LLMs. To\nmitigate this issue, we introduce Moxin 7B, a fully open-source LLM developed,\nadhering to principles of open science, open source, open data, and open\naccess. We release the pre-training code and configurations, training and\nfine-tuning datasets, and intermediate and final checkpoints, aiming to make\ncontinuous commitments to fully open-source LLMs. After pre-training the base\nmodel, we finetune the Moxin Base model with SOTA post-training framework and\ninstruction data to obtain Moxin Instruct model.

We derive the necessary formulations to enable GFD\nto operate across mismatched token spaces of different models by calculating\nlikelihood at the byte level, thereby enabling seamless fusion and synchronous\nprogression during the decoding process. GFD is plug-and-play by design, making\nit readily compatible with various auto-regressive models without the need for\nany re-training. GFD proves effective for general ASR and OCR tasks through\nintermediate and frequent interactions with LLMs, surpassing cascaded methods\nin English and Mandarin benchmarks. In addition, GFD transfers in-context\nlearning abilities of LLMs and allows for adaptive ASR in instruction-aware and\nlong-context settings, yielding significant WER reductions of up to 17.7\\%."

                "summary": "As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, their capacity to\nfunction effectively across a diverse range of languages has shown marked\nimprovement. Preliminary studies observe that the hidden activations of LLMs\noften resemble English, even when responding to non-English prompts. This has\nled to the widespread assumption that LLMs may \"think\" in English. However,\nmore recent results showing strong multilingual performance, even surpassing\nEnglish performance on specific tasks in other languages, challenge this view.\nIn this work, we find that LLMs progressively develop a core language-agnostic\nparameter space-a remarkably small subset of parameters whose deactivation\nresults in significant performance degradation across all languages. This\ncompact yet critical set of parameters underlies the model's ability to\ngeneralize beyond individual languages, supporting the emergence of abstract\nthought that is not tied to any specific linguistic system. Specifically, we\nidentify language-related neurons-those are consistently activated during the\nprocessing of particular languages, and categorize them as either shared\n(active across multiple languages) or exclusive (specific to one). As LLMs\nundergo continued development over time, we observe a marked increase in both\nthe proportion and functional importance of shared neurons, while exclusive\nneurons progressively diminish in influence. These shared neurons constitute\nthe backbone of the core language-agnostic parameter space, supporting the\nemergence of abstract thought. Motivated by these insights, we propose\nneuron-specific training strategies tailored to LLMs' language-agnostic levels\nat different development stages. Experiments across diverse LLM families\nsupport our approach.",

                    "value": "As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, their capacity to\nfunction effectively across a diverse range of languages has shown marked\nimprovement. Preliminary studies observe that the hidden activations of LLMs\noften resemble English, even when responding to non-English prompts. This has\nled to the widespread assumption that LLMs may \"think\" in English. However,\nmore recent results showing strong multilingual performance, even surpassing\nEnglish performance on specific tasks in other languages, challenge this view.\nIn this work, we find that LLMs progressively develop a core language-agnostic\nparameter space-a remarkably small subset of parameters whose deactivation\nresults in significant performance degradation across all languages. This\ncompact yet critical set of parameters underlies the model's ability to\ngeneralize beyond individual languages, supporting the emergence of abstract\nthought that is not tied to any specific linguistic system. Specifically, we\nidentify language-related neurons-those are consistently activated during the\nprocessing of particular languages, and categorize them as either shared\n(active across multiple languages) or exclusive (specific to one). As LLMs\nundergo continued development over time, we observe a marked increase in both\nthe proportion and functional importance of shared neurons, while exclusive\nneurons progressively diminish in influence. These shared neurons constitute\nthe backbone of the core language-agnostic parameter space, supporting the\nemergence of abstract thought. Motivated by these insights, we propose\nneuron-specific training strategies tailored to LLMs' language-agnostic levels\nat different development stages. Experiments across diverse LLM families\nsupport our approach."

Early approaches typically rely on strong 3D\nknowledge, including architectural 3D inductive biases (e.g., embedding\nexplicit 3D representations, such as NeRF or 3DGS, into network design) and\nground-truth camera poses for both input and target views.

Besides, TableEval features cross-lingual scenarios with\ntables in Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, and English. To minimize the\nrisk of data leakage, we collect all data from recent real-world documents.\nConsidering that existing TableQA metrics fail to capture semantic accuracy, we\nfurther propose SEAT, a new evaluation framework that assesses the alignment\nbetween model responses and reference answers at the sub-question level.\nExperimental results have shown that SEAT achieves high agreement with human\njudgment. Extensive experiments on TableEval reveal critical gaps in the\nability of state-of-the-art LLMs to handle these complex, real-world TableQA\ntasks, offering insights for future improvements. We make our dataset available\nhere: https://github.com/wenge-research/TableEval."

To answer No!, we\nintroduce FreeZeV2, the second generation of FreeZe: a training-free method\nthat achieves strong generalization to unseen objects by leveraging geometric\nand vision foundation models pre-trained on unrelated data. FreeZeV2 improves\nboth accuracy and efficiency over FreeZe through three key contributions: (i) a\nsparse feature extraction strategy that reduces inference-time computation\nwithout sacrificing accuracy; (ii) a feature-aware scoring mechanism that\nimproves both pose selection during RANSAC-based 3D registration and the final\nranking of pose candidates; and (iii) a modular design that supports ensembles\nof instance segmentation models, increasing robustness to segmentation masks\nerrors. We evaluate FreeZeV2 on the seven core datasets of the BOP Benchmark,\nwhere it establishes a new state-of-the-art in 6D pose estimation of unseen\nobjects. When using the same segmentation masks, FreeZeV2 achieves a remarkable\n8x speedup over FreeZe while also improving accuracy by 5%.

First, we\nidentify a total of 4,893 indigenous-related articles from our initial dataset\nof 2.2 million newspaper articles, using a combination of keyword-based\nfiltering and LLM, achieving 77% accuracy and an F1-score of 81.9\\%. From\nmanually inspecting 3 prominent Bangla newspapers, we identify 15 genres that\nwe use as our topics for semi-supervised topic modeling using CorEx. Results\nshow indigenous news articles have higher representation of culture and\nentertainment (19%, 10% higher than general news articles), and a\ndisproportionate focus on conflict and protest (9%, 7% higher than general\nnews). On the other hand, sentiment analysis reveals that 57% of articles on\nindigenous topics carry a negative tone, compared to 27% for non-indigenous\nrelated news. Drawing from communication studies, we further analyze framing,\npriming, and agenda-setting (frequency of themes) to support the case for\ndiscrimination in representation of indigenous news coverage. For the\nqualitative part of our analysis, we facilitated FGD, where participants\nfurther validated these findings. Participants unanimously expressed their\nfeeling of being under-represented, and that critical issues affecting their\ncommunities (such as education, healthcare, and land rights) are systematically\nmarginalized in news media coverage. By highlighting 8 cases of discrimination\nand media misrepresentation that were frequently mentioned by participants in\nthe FGD, this study emphasizes the urgent need for more equitable media\npractices that accurately reflect the experiences and struggles of marginalized\ncommunities.",

This\nprocess leads to a more deterministic planning approach, reducing dependence on\nLLM-generated planning, which can sometimes be inconsistent and overly general.\nThe combination of feature engineering-driven planning and selective LLM\nutilization results in a robust decision support system, capable of providing\nhighly interpretable and actionable insights. Experiments using multiple LLMs\ndemonstrate the efficacy of our approach, achieving significantly higher\naccuracy compared to various baselines across several domains."

Of particular interest is the discovery of objects that\nare not only innovative but also conform to the physical specifications of the\nreal world in science and engineering.

We propose several novel LLM-based multitask evolutionary operators\nto guide the search toward the discovery of high-performing practical objects.\nExperimental results in conceptual design optimization validate the\neffectiveness of LLM2TEA, revealing from 97\\% to 174\\% improvement in the\ndiversity of innovative objects compared to the present text-to-3D generative\nmodel baseline. In addition, more than 73\\% of the generated designs have\nbetter physical performance than the top 1\\% percentile of the designs\ngenerated in the baseline. Moreover, LLM2TEA generates designs that are not\nonly aesthetically creative but also functional in real-world applications.\nSeveral of these designs have been successfully 3D-printed, emphasizing the\nproposed approach's capacity to transform AI-generated outputs into tangible\nphysical objects.

We propose several novel LLM-based multitask evolutionary operators\nto guide the search toward the discovery of high-performing practical objects.\nExperimental results in conceptual design optimization validate the\neffectiveness of LLM2TEA, revealing from 97\\% to 174\\% improvement in the\ndiversity of innovative objects compared to the present text-to-3D generative\nmodel baseline. In addition, more than 73\\% of the generated designs have\nbetter physical performance than the top 1\\% percentile of the designs\ngenerated in the baseline. Moreover, LLM2TEA generates designs that are not\nonly aesthetically creative but also functional in real-world applications.\nSeveral of these designs have been successfully 3D-printed, emphasizing the\nproposed approach's capacity to transform AI-generated outputs into tangible\nphysical objects. The designs produced by LLM2TEA meets practical requirements\nwhile showcasing creative and innovative features, underscoring its potential\napplications in complex design optimization and discovery."

We formally prove that the resulting sequences are\nguaranteed to satisfy the given LTLf constraints, and we empirically\ndemonstrate that TRIDENT also improves output quality. We validate our approach\non two distinct tasks: temporally constrained image-stream classification and\ncontrolled text generation. In both settings, TRIDENT achieves perfect\nconstraint satisfaction, while comparison with the state of the art shows\nimproved efficiency and high standard quality metrics."

Our method combines Gaussian\nProcesses with State Space Models and employs parallel scan inference\nalgorithms, enabling efficient scaling to large datasets while identifying\nconcurrent communication patterns that evolve over time. This time-varying\napproach captures how brain region interactions shift dynamically during\ncognitive processes. Validated on synthetic and multi-region neural recordings\ndatasets, our approach discovers both the directionality and temporal dynamics\nof neural communication. This work advances our understanding of distributed\nneural computation and provides a scalable tool for analyzing dynamic brain\nnetworks."

Current methods\nfor increasing diversity often only operate at the token-level, paraphrasing\nthe same response. This is problematic because it leads to poor exploration on\nreasoning problems and to unengaging, repetitive conversational agents. To\naddress this we propose Intent Factored Generation (IFG), factorising the\nsampling process into two stages. First, we sample a semantically dense intent,\ne.g., a summary or keywords.

Current methods\nfor increasing diversity often only operate at the token-level, paraphrasing\nthe same response. This is problematic because it leads to poor exploration on\nreasoning problems and to unengaging, repetitive conversational agents. To\naddress this we propose Intent Factored Generation (IFG), factorising the\nsampling process into two stages. First, we sample a semantically dense intent,\ne.g., a summary or keywords.

Traditional methods\nrely on equilibrium search to generate extensive game data for training, which\ndemands substantial computational resources.

However, applying LLMs to\nDiplomacy remains challenging due to the exponential growth of possible action\ncombinations and the intricate strategic interactions among players. To address\nthis challenge, we propose DipLLM, a fine-tuned LLM-based agent that learns\nequilibrium policies for Diplomacy. DipLLM employs an autoregressive\nfactorization framework to simplify the complex task of multi-unit action\nassignment into a sequence of unit-level decisions. By defining an equilibrium\npolicy within this framework as the learning objective, we fine-tune the model\nusing only 1.5% of the data required by the state-of-the-art Cicero model,\nsurpassing its performance.

                "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in\ntool learning. In real-world scenarios, user queries are often ambiguous and\nincomplete, requiring effective clarification. However, existing interactive\nclarification approaches face two critical limitations: reliance on manually\nconstructed datasets, which inherently constrains training data scale and\ndiversity, and lack of error correction mechanisms during multi-turn\nclarification, leading to error accumulation that compromises both accuracy and\nefficiency. We present AskToAct, which addresses these challenges by exploiting\nthe structural mapping between queries and their tool invocation solutions. Our\nkey insight is that tool parameters naturally represent explicit user intents.\nBy systematically removing key parameters from queries while retaining them as\nground truth, we enable automated construction of high-quality training data.\nWe further enhance model robustness through error-correction pairs and\nselective masking, enabling dynamic error detection during clarification\ninteractions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that AskToAct significantly\noutperforms existing approaches, achieving above 57% accuracy in recovering\ncritical unspecified intents and enhancing clarification efficiency by an\naverage of 10.46% while maintaining high accuracy in tool invocation.

                    "value": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in\ntool learning. In real-world scenarios, user queries are often ambiguous and\nincomplete, requiring effective clarification. However, existing interactive\nclarification approaches face two critical limitations: reliance on manually\nconstructed datasets, which inherently constrains training data scale and\ndiversity, and lack of error correction mechanisms during multi-turn\nclarification, leading to error accumulation that compromises both accuracy and\nefficiency. We present AskToAct, which addresses these challenges by exploiting\nthe structural mapping between queries and their tool invocation solutions. Our\nkey insight is that tool parameters naturally represent explicit user intents.\nBy systematically removing key parameters from queries while retaining them as\nground truth, we enable automated construction of high-quality training data.\nWe further enhance model robustness through error-correction pairs and\nselective masking, enabling dynamic error detection during clarification\ninteractions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that AskToAct significantly\noutperforms existing approaches, achieving above 57% accuracy in recovering\ncritical unspecified intents and enhancing clarification efficiency by an\naverage of 10.46% while maintaining high accuracy in tool invocation.

In this paper, we introduce QRHEAD (Query-Focused\nRetrieval Head), an improved set of attention heads that enhance retrieval from\nlong context. We identify QRHEAD by aggregating attention scores with respect\nto the input query, using a handful of examples from real-world tasks (e.g.,\nlong-context QA). We further introduce QR- RETRIEVER, an efficient and\neffective retriever that uses the accumulated attention mass of QRHEAD as\nretrieval scores. We use QR- RETRIEVER for long-context reasoning by selecting\nthe most relevant parts with the highest retrieval scores. On multi-hop\nreasoning tasks LongMemEval and CLIPPER, this yields over 10% performance gains\nover full context and outperforms strong dense retrievers. We also evaluate\nQRRETRIEVER as a re-ranker on the BEIR benchmark and find that it achieves\nstrong zero-shot performance, outperforming other LLM-based re-rankers such as\nRankGPT. Further analysis shows that both the querycontext attention scoring\nand task selection are crucial for identifying QRHEAD with strong downstream\nutility. Overall, our work contributes a general-purpose retriever and offers\ninterpretability insights into the long-context capabilities of LMs.",

To address this, we introduce LLM-BT, a back-translation framework\npowered by large language models (LLMs) designed to automate terminology\nverification and standardization through cross-lingual semantic alignment. Our\nkey contributions include: (1) term-level consistency validation: by performing\nEnglish -> intermediate language -> English back-translation, LLM-BT achieves\nhigh term consistency across different models (such as GPT-4, DeepSeek, and\nGrok). Case studies demonstrate over 90 percent of terms are preserved either\nexactly or semantically; (2) multi-path verification workflow: we develop a\nnovel pipeline described as Retrieve -> Generate -> Verify -> Optimize, which\nsupports both serial paths (e.g., English -> Simplified Chinese -> Traditional\nChinese -> English) and parallel paths (e.g., English -> Chinese / Portuguese\n-> English). BLEU scores and term-level accuracy indicate strong cross-lingual\nrobustness, with BLEU scores exceeding 0.45 and Portuguese term accuracy\nreaching 100 percent; (3) back-translation as semantic embedding: we\nreinterpret back-translation as a form of dynamic semantic embedding that\nuncovers latent trajectories of meaning. In contrast to static embeddings,\nLLM-BT offers transparent, path-based embeddings shaped by the evolution of the\nmodels.

We evaluate factuality, relevance and\nsurface-level quality of LLM-generated long-form answers, finding that (1) for\nmany languages, even the best models make critical surface-level errors (e.g.,\nanswering in the wrong language, repetition), especially for low-resource\nlanguages; and (2) answers to culturally specific questions contain more\nfactual errors than answers to culturally agnostic questions -- questions that\nhave consistent meaning and answer across many cultures. We release CaLMQA to\nfacilitate future research in cultural and multilingual long-form QA."

We revisit the central aspects of conformal\nprediction from a Bayesian perspective and thereby illuminate the shortcomings\nof frequentist guarantees. We propose a practical alternative based on Bayesian\nquadrature that provides interpretable guarantees and offers a richer\nrepresentation of the likely range of losses to be observed at test time."

First, we\nidentify a total of 4,893 indigenous-related articles from our initial dataset\nof 2.2 million newspaper articles, using a combination of keyword-based\nfiltering and LLM, achieving 77% accuracy and an F1-score of 81.9\\%. From\nmanually inspecting 3 prominent Bangla newspapers, we identify 15 genres that\nwe use as our topics for semi-supervised topic modeling using CorEx. Results\nshow indigenous news articles have higher representation of culture and\nentertainment (19%, 10% higher than general news articles), and a\ndisproportionate focus on conflict and protest (9%, 7% higher than general\nnews). On the other hand, sentiment analysis reveals that 57% of articles on\nindigenous topics carry a negative tone, compared to 27% for non-indigenous\nrelated news. Drawing from communication studies, we further analyze framing,\npriming, and agenda-setting (frequency of themes) to support the case for\ndiscrimination in representation of indigenous news coverage. For the\nqualitative part of our analysis, we facilitated FGD, where participants\nfurther validated these findings.

                    "value": "In this paper, we examine the intersections of indigeneity and media\nrepresentation in shaping perceptions of indigenous communities in Bangladesh.\nUsing a mixed-methods approach, we combine quantitative analysis of media data\nwith qualitative insights from focus group discussions (FGD). First, we\nidentify a total of 4,893 indigenous-related articles from our initial dataset\nof 2.2 million newspaper articles, using a combination of keyword-based\nfiltering and LLM, achieving 77% accuracy and an F1-score of 81.9\\%. From\nmanually inspecting 3 prominent Bangla newspapers, we identify 15 genres that\nwe use as our topics for semi-supervised topic modeling using CorEx. Results\nshow indigenous news articles have higher representation of culture and\nentertainment (19%, 10% higher than general news articles), and a\ndisproportionate focus on conflict and protest (9%, 7% higher than general\nnews). On the other hand, sentiment analysis reveals that 57% of articles on\nindigenous topics carry a negative tone, compared to 27% for non-indigenous\nrelated news. Drawing from communication studies, we further analyze framing,\npriming, and agenda-setting (frequency of themes) to support the case for\ndiscrimination in representation of indigenous news coverage. For the\nqualitative part of our analysis, we facilitated FGD, where participants\nfurther validated these findings. Participants unanimously expressed their\nfeeling of being under-represented, and that critical issues affecting their\ncommunities (such as education, healthcare, and land rights) are systematically\nmarginalized in news media coverage. By highlighting 8 cases of discrimination\nand media misrepresentation that were frequently mentioned by participants in\nthe FGD, this study emphasizes the urgent need for more equitable media\npractices that accurately reflect the experiences and struggles of marginalized\ncommunities."

As a brain-inspired paradigm, spiking neural networks (SNNs) are\ninherently well-suited for modeling the sparse, event-driven patterns of neural\ndegeneration in AD, offering a promising foundation for interpretable and\nlow-power medical diagnostics.

To\naddress this we propose Intent Factored Generation (IFG), factorising the\nsampling process into two stages. First, we sample a semantically dense intent,\ne.g., a summary or keywords. Second, we sample the final response conditioning\non both the original prompt and the intent from the first stage.

We demonstrate\nour method's effectiveness across a diverse set of tasks. We show this method\nimproves both pass@k and Reinforcement Learning from Verifier Feedback on maths\nand code tasks. For instruction-tuning, we combine IFG with Direct Preference\nOptimisation to increase conversational diversity without sacrificing reward.\nFinally, we achieve higher diversity while maintaining the quality of\ngenerations on a general language modelling task, using a new dataset of reader\ncomments and news articles that we collect and open-source. In summary, we\npresent a simple method of increasing the sample diversity of LLMs while\nmaintaining performance.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation mitigates these\nissues by grounding LLMs with external knowledge; however, most existing RAG\npipelines rely on unstructured text, limiting interpretability and structured\nreasoning. Knowledge graphs, which represent facts as relational triples, offer\na more structured and compact alternative. Recent studies have explored\nintegrating knowledge graphs with LLMs for knowledge graph question answering\n(KGQA), with a significant proportion adopting the retrieve-then-reasoning\nparadigm. In this framework, graph-based retrievers have demonstrated strong\nempirical performance, yet they still face challenges in generalization\nability. In this work, we propose RAPL, a novel framework for efficient and\neffective graph retrieval in KGQA. RAPL addresses these limitations through\nthree aspects: (1) a two-stage labeling strategy that combines heuristic\nsignals with parametric models to provide causally grounded supervision; (2) a\nmodel-agnostic graph transformation approach to capture both intra- and\ninter-triple interactions, thereby enhancing representational capacity; and (3)\na path-based reasoning strategy that facilitates learning from the injected\nrational knowledge, and supports downstream reasoner through structured inputs.\nEmpirically, RAPL outperforms state-of-the-art methods by $2.66\\%-20.34\\%$, and\nsignificantly reduces the performance gap between smaller and more powerful\nLLM-based reasoners, as well as the gap under cross-dataset settings,\nhighlighting its superior retrieval capability and generalizability.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation mitigates these\nissues by grounding LLMs with external knowledge; however, most existing RAG\npipelines rely on unstructured text, limiting interpretability and structured\nreasoning. Knowledge graphs, which represent facts as relational triples, offer\na more structured and compact alternative. Recent studies have explored\nintegrating knowledge graphs with LLMs for knowledge graph question answering\n(KGQA), with a significant proportion adopting the retrieve-then-reasoning\nparadigm. In this framework, graph-based retrievers have demonstrated strong\nempirical performance, yet they still face challenges in generalization\nability. In this work, we propose RAPL, a novel framework for efficient and\neffective graph retrieval in KGQA. RAPL addresses these limitations through\nthree aspects: (1) a two-stage labeling strategy that combines heuristic\nsignals with parametric models to provide causally grounded supervision; (2) a\nmodel-agnostic graph transformation approach to capture both intra- and\ninter-triple interactions, thereby enhancing representational capacity; and (3)\na path-based reasoning strategy that facilitates learning from the injected\nrational knowledge, and supports downstream reasoner through structured inputs.\nEmpirically, RAPL outperforms state-of-the-art methods by $2.66\\%-20.34\\%$, and\nsignificantly reduces the performance gap between smaller and more powerful\nLLM-based reasoners, as well as the gap under cross-dataset settings,\nhighlighting its superior retrieval capability and generalizability.

However, the absence of task-specific knowledge in prompts often\nleads LLMs to provide unspecific search directions, obstructing the derivation\nof well-performing heuristics. Moreover, evaluating the derived heuristics\nremains resource-intensive, especially for those semantically equivalent ones,\noften requiring omissible resource expenditure. To enable LLMs to provide\nspecific search directions, we propose the Hercules algorithm, which leverages\nour designed Core Abstraction Prompting (CAP) method to abstract the core\ncomponents from elite heuristics and incorporate them as prior knowledge in\nprompts. We theoretically prove the effectiveness of CAP in reducing\nunspecificity and provide empirical results in this work. To reduce computing\nresources required for evaluating the derived heuristics, we propose few-shot\nPerformance Prediction Prompting (PPP), a first-of-its-kind method for the\nHeuristic Generation (HG) task. PPP leverages LLMs to predict the fitness\nvalues of newly derived heuristics by analyzing their semantic similarity to\npreviously evaluated ones. We further develop two tailored mechanisms for PPP\nto enhance predictive accuracy and determine unreliable predictions,\nrespectively. The use of PPP makes Hercules more resource-efficient and we name\nthis variant Hercules-P. Extensive experiments across four HG tasks, five COPs,\nand eight LLMs demonstrate that Hercules outperforms the state-of-the-art\nLLM-based HG algorithms, while Hercules-P excels at minimizing required\ncomputing resources. In addition, we illustrate the effectiveness of CAP, PPP,\nand the other proposed mechanisms by conducting relevant ablation studies.",

To enable LLMs to provide\nspecific search directions, we propose the Hercules algorithm, which leverages\nour designed Core Abstraction Prompting (CAP) method to abstract the core\ncomponents from elite heuristics and incorporate them as prior knowledge in\nprompts. We theoretically prove the effectiveness of CAP in reducing\nunspecificity and provide empirical results in this work. To reduce computing\nresources required for evaluating the derived heuristics, we propose few-shot\nPerformance Prediction Prompting (PPP), a first-of-its-kind method for the\nHeuristic Generation (HG) task. PPP leverages LLMs to predict the fitness\nvalues of newly derived heuristics by analyzing their semantic similarity to\npreviously evaluated ones. We further develop two tailored mechanisms for PPP\nto enhance predictive accuracy and determine unreliable predictions,\nrespectively. The use of PPP makes Hercules more resource-efficient and we name\nthis variant Hercules-P. Extensive experiments across four HG tasks, five COPs,\nand eight LLMs demonstrate that Hercules outperforms the state-of-the-art\nLLM-based HG algorithms, while Hercules-P excels at minimizing required\ncomputing resources. In addition, we illustrate the effectiveness of CAP, PPP,\nand the other proposed mechanisms by conducting relevant ablation studies."

Existing feed-forward 3D scene understanding methods (e.g., LSM)\nare limited to extracting language-based semantics from scenes, failing to\nachieve holistic scene comprehension. Additionally, they suffer from\nlow-quality geometry reconstruction and noisy artifacts. In contrast, per-scene\noptimization methods rely on dense input views, which reduces practicality and\nincreases complexity during deployment. In this paper, we propose\nSemanticSplat, a feed-forward semantic-aware 3D reconstruction method, which\nunifies 3D Gaussians with latent semantic attributes for joint\ngeometry-appearance-semantics modeling. To predict the semantic anisotropic\nGaussians, SemanticSplat fuses diverse feature fields (e.g., LSeg, SAM) with a\ncost volume representation that stores cross-view feature similarities,\nenhancing coherent and accurate scene comprehension. Leveraging a two-stage\ndistillation framework, SemanticSplat reconstructs a holistic multi-modal\nsemantic feature field from sparse-view images. Experiments demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our method for 3D scene understanding tasks like promptable\nand open-vocabulary segmentation.

In this paper, we propose\nSemanticSplat, a feed-forward semantic-aware 3D reconstruction method, which\nunifies 3D Gaussians with latent semantic attributes for joint\ngeometry-appearance-semantics modeling. To predict the semantic anisotropic\nGaussians, SemanticSplat fuses diverse feature fields (e.g., LSeg, SAM) with a\ncost volume representation that stores cross-view feature similarities,\nenhancing coherent and accurate scene comprehension. Leveraging a two-stage\ndistillation framework, SemanticSplat reconstructs a holistic multi-modal\nsemantic feature field from sparse-view images. Experiments demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our method for 3D scene understanding tasks like promptable\nand open-vocabulary segmentation. Video results are available at\nhttps://semanticsplat.github.io."

At\ncompile time, the NeuroForge engine performs constraint-driven design space\nexploration, generating RTL mappings that are Pareto-optimal with respect to\nuser-defined latency and resource budgets. Unlike existing FPGA compilers,\nwhich rely on static scheduling and manual tuning, NeuroForge leverages\nanalytical performance models and multi-objective genetic algorithms to\nefficiently search large configuration spaces and propose highly optimized\nhardware implementations. At runtime, the NeuroMorph module enables dynamic\nreconfiguration of network width and depth without requiring redeployment. This\nis made possible by a novel training strategy, DistillCycle, which jointly\ntrains the full model and its subnetworks using hierarchical knowledge\ndistillation. As a result, each execution path maintains accuracy even under\naggressive resource and power constraints. We demonstrate Forge-Morph on the\nZynq-7100 using custom and benchmark models including MobileNetV2, ResNet-50,\nSqueezeNet, and YOLOv5. The system achieves up to 50x latency reduction and 32%\nlower power consumption at runtime, while matching or exceeding the efficiency\nof state-of-the-art compilers.
