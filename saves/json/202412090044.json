The majority of computation stems from the\noverwhelming volume of vision tokens processed by the transformer decoder. In\nthis paper, we propose to build efficient MLLMs by leveraging the\nMixture-of-Depths (MoD) mechanism, where each transformer decoder layer selects\nessential vision tokens to process while skipping redundant ones. However,\nintegrating MoD into MLLMs is non-trivial. To address the challenges of\ntraining and inference stability as well as limited training data, we adapt the\nMoD module with two novel designs: tanh-gated weight normalization (TanhNorm)\nand symmetric token reweighting (STRing). Moreover, we observe that vision\ntokens exhibit higher redundancy in deeper layer and thus design a progressive\nratio decay (PRD) strategy, which gradually reduces the token retention ratio\nlayer by layer, employing a shifted cosine schedule. This crucial design fully\nunleashes the potential of MoD, significantly boosting the efficiency and\nperformance of our models. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we\nconduct extensive experiments with two baseline models across 14 benchmarks.\nOur model, p-MoD, matches or even surpasses the performance of the baseline\nmodels, with only 55.6% TFLOPs and 53.8% KV cache storage during inference, and\n77.7% GPU hours during training.",

To address this, two critical steps are often required: a\npretrained LLM typically undergoes a separate stage for context length\nextension by training on long-context data, followed by architectural\nmodifications to reduce the overhead of KV cache during serving. This paper\nargues that integrating length extension with a GPU-friendly KV cache reduction\narchitecture not only reduces training overhead during length extension, but\nalso achieves better long-context performance. This leads to our proposed\nLongGen, which finetunes a pretrained LLM into an efficient architecture during\nlength extension. LongGen builds on three key insights: (1) Sparse attention\npatterns, such as window attention (attending to recent tokens), attention sink\n(initial ones), and blockwise sparse attention (strided token blocks) are\nwell-suited for building efficient long-context models, primarily due to their\nGPU-friendly memory access patterns, enabling efficiency gains not just\ntheoretically but in practice as well. (2) It is essential for the model to\nhave direct access to all tokens. A hybrid architecture with 1/3 full attention\nlayers and 2/3 efficient ones achieves a balanced trade-off between efficiency\nand long-context performance. (3) Lightweight training on 5B long-context data\nis sufficient to extend the hybrid model's context length from 4K to 128K.\n  We evaluate LongGen on both Llama-2 7B and Llama-2 70B, demonstrating its\neffectiveness across different scales. During training with 128K-long contexts,\nLongGen achieves 1.55x training speedup and reduces wall-clock time by 36%,\ncompared to a full-attention baseline. During inference, LongGen reduces KV\ncache memory by 62%, achieving 1.67x prefilling speedup and 1.41x decoding\nspeedup.",

However, long context poses\nsignificant challenges for inference efficiency, including high memory costs of\nkey-value (KV) cache and increased latency due to extensive memory accesses.\nRecent works have proposed compressing KV cache to approximate computation, but\nthese methods either evict tokens permanently, never recalling them for later\ninference, or recall previous tokens at the granularity of pages divided by\ntextual positions. Both approaches degrade the model accuracy and output\nquality.

However, long context poses\nsignificant challenges for inference efficiency, including high memory costs of\nkey-value (KV) cache and increased latency due to extensive memory accesses.\nRecent works have proposed compressing KV cache to approximate computation, but\nthese methods either evict tokens permanently, never recalling them for later\ninference, or recall previous tokens at the granularity of pages divided by\ntextual positions. Both approaches degrade the model accuracy and output\nquality.

However, this approach is\ncomputationally expensive. To address this problem, we propose Transformer with\nresidual value (ResFormer) which approximates cross-layer attention through\nadding a residual connection from the values of the the first layer to all\nsubsequent layers. Based on this method, one variant is the Transformer with\nsingle layer value (SVFormer), where all layers share the same value embedding\nfrom first layer. Comprehensive empirical evidence demonstrates ResFormer\nachieves equivalent validation loss with 10.4% fewer model parameters and 13.6%\nless training data compared to Transformer, while maintaining similar memory\nusage and computational cost. Besides, SVFormer reduces KV cache size by nearly\nhalf with only a small performance penalty and can be integrated with other\nKV-efficient methods, yielding further reductions in KV cache, with performance\ninfluenced by sequence length and cumulative learning rate.

                "summary": "The Wasatch Front in Utah, USA, is currently a non-attainment area for ozone\naccording to the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) National Ambient Air\nQuality Standards (NAAQS). Nitrogen oxides ($\\mathrm{NO_x = NO_2 + NO}$) and\nvolatile organic compounds (VOCs), in the presence of sunlight, lead to ozone\nformation in the troposphere. When the rate of oxidant production, defined as\nthe sum of $\\mathrm{O_3}$ and $\\mathrm{NO_2}$, is faster than the rate of\n$\\mathrm{NO_x}$ production, a region is said to be $\\mathrm{NO_x}$limited, and\nozone formation will be limited by the concentration of $\\mathrm{NO_x}$ species\nin the region. The inverse of this situation makes the region VOC-limited.\nKnowing whether a region is $\\mathrm{NO_x}$-limited or VOC-limited can aid in\ngenerating effective mitigation strategies. Understanding the background or\nregional contributions to ozone in a region, whether from the transport of\nprecursors or of ozone, provides information about the lower limit for ozone\nconcentrations that a region can achieve through regulation of local\nprecursors. In this paper, measured oxidant and $\\mathrm{NO_x}$ concentrations\nare analyzed from 14 counties in the state of Utah to calculate the regional\nand local contributions to ozone for each region. This analysis is used to\ndetermine the nature of the atmosphere in each county by identifying whether\nthe region is VOC or $\\mathrm{NO_x}$-limited. Furthermore, this analysis is\nperformed for each county for the years 2012 and 2022 to assess changes in the\noxidative nature and quantify regional and local contributions to ozone over a\n10-year period. All studied counties--except for Washington County--in Utah\nwere found to be VOC-limited in 2012. This shifted in 2022, with most counties\nbeing either in a transitional state or $\\mathrm{NO_x}$-limited. Local\ncontributions to ozone increased in two major counties, Cache and Salt Lake\nCounties, but decreased in Carbon, Davis, Duchesne, Uinta, Utah, Washington,\nand Weber Counties. Generally, the regional contributions to oxidant\nconcentrations decreased across the state. A summertime spike in both regional\nand local contributions to oxidants was observed.

                    "value": "The Wasatch Front in Utah, USA, is currently a non-attainment area for ozone\naccording to the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) National Ambient Air\nQuality Standards (NAAQS). Nitrogen oxides ($\\mathrm{NO_x = NO_2 + NO}$) and\nvolatile organic compounds (VOCs), in the presence of sunlight, lead to ozone\nformation in the troposphere. When the rate of oxidant production, defined as\nthe sum of $\\mathrm{O_3}$ and $\\mathrm{NO_2}$, is faster than the rate of\n$\\mathrm{NO_x}$ production, a region is said to be $\\mathrm{NO_x}$limited, and\nozone formation will be limited by the concentration of $\\mathrm{NO_x}$ species\nin the region. The inverse of this situation makes the region VOC-limited.\nKnowing whether a region is $\\mathrm{NO_x}$-limited or VOC-limited can aid in\ngenerating effective mitigation strategies. Understanding the background or\nregional contributions to ozone in a region, whether from the transport of\nprecursors or of ozone, provides information about the lower limit for ozone\nconcentrations that a region can achieve through regulation of local\nprecursors. In this paper, measured oxidant and $\\mathrm{NO_x}$ concentrations\nare analyzed from 14 counties in the state of Utah to calculate the regional\nand local contributions to ozone for each region. This analysis is used to\ndetermine the nature of the atmosphere in each county by identifying whether\nthe region is VOC or $\\mathrm{NO_x}$-limited. Furthermore, this analysis is\nperformed for each county for the years 2012 and 2022 to assess changes in the\noxidative nature and quantify regional and local contributions to ozone over a\n10-year period. All studied counties--except for Washington County--in Utah\nwere found to be VOC-limited in 2012. This shifted in 2022, with most counties\nbeing either in a transitional state or $\\mathrm{NO_x}$-limited. Local\ncontributions to ozone increased in two major counties, Cache and Salt Lake\nCounties, but decreased in Carbon, Davis, Duchesne, Uinta, Utah, Washington,\nand Weber Counties. Generally, the regional contributions to oxidant\nconcentrations decreased across the state. A summertime spike in both regional\nand local contributions to oxidants was observed. Smoke from wildfires was\nfound to increase regional contributions to oxidants and shift the local regime\nto be more $\\mathrm{NO_x}$-limited."

                "summary": "In the era of the sixth generation (6G) and industrial Internet of Things\n(IIoT), an industrial cyber-physical system (ICPS) drives the proliferation of\nsensor devices and computing-intensive tasks. To address the limited resources\nof IIoT sensor devices, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted mobile edge\ncomputing (MEC) has emerged as a promising solution, providing flexible and\ncost-effective services in close proximity of IIoT sensor devices (ISDs).\nHowever, leveraging aerial MEC to meet the delay-sensitive and\ncomputation-intensive requirements of the ISDs could face several challenges,\nincluding the limited communication, computation and caching (3C) resources,\nstringent offloading requirements for 3C services, and constrained on-board\nenergy of UAVs. To address these issues, we first present a collaborative\naerial MEC-assisted ICPS architecture by incorporating the computing\ncapabilities of the macro base station (MBS) and UAVs. We then formulate a\nservice delay minimization optimization problem (SDMOP).

To address the limited resources\nof IIoT sensor devices, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted mobile edge\ncomputing (MEC) has emerged as a promising solution, providing flexible and\ncost-effective services in close proximity of IIoT sensor devices (ISDs).\nHowever, leveraging aerial MEC to meet the delay-sensitive and\ncomputation-intensive requirements of the ISDs could face several challenges,\nincluding the limited communication, computation and caching (3C) resources,\nstringent offloading requirements for 3C services, and constrained on-board\nenergy of UAVs. To address these issues, we first present a collaborative\naerial MEC-assisted ICPS architecture by incorporating the computing\ncapabilities of the macro base station (MBS) and UAVs. We then formulate a\nservice delay minimization optimization problem (SDMOP).

Recent works on LLM inference use speculative decoding to\nachieve extreme speedups. However, most of these works implicitly design their\nalgorithms for high-end datacenter hardware. In this work, we ask the opposite\nquestion: how fast can we run LLMs on consumer machines? Consumer GPUs can no\nlonger fit the largest available models (50B+ parameters) and must offload them\nto RAM or SSD. When running with offloaded parameters, the inference engine can\nprocess batches of hundreds or thousands of tokens at the same time as just one\ntoken, making it a natural fit for speculative decoding. We propose SpecExec\n(Speculative Execution), a simple parallel decoding method that can generate up\nto 20 tokens per target model iteration for popular LLM families. It utilizes\nthe high spikiness of the token probabilities distribution in modern LLMs and a\nhigh degree of alignment between model output probabilities. SpecExec takes the\nmost probable tokens continuation from the draft model to build a \"cache\" tree\nfor the target model, which then gets validated in a single pass. Using\nSpecExec, we demonstrate inference of 50B+ parameter LLMs on consumer GPUs with\nRAM offloading at 4-6 tokens per second with 4-bit quantization or 2-3 tokens\nper second with 16-bit weights.",

The existing solutions\nuse the LRU-based cache to reuse the KV context of common prefix. The KV\ncontext that is about to be reused may prematurely be evicted with the implicit\ncache management. Even if not evicted, the lifetime of the shared KV context is\nextended since requests sharing the same context are not scheduled together,\nresulting in larger memory usage. These streaming oriented systems schedule the\nrequests in the first-come-first-serve or similar order. As a result, the\nrequests with larger ratio of decoding steps may be scheduled too late to be\nable to mix with the prefill chunks to increase the hardware utilization.\nBesides, the token and request number based batching can limit the size of\ntoken-batch, which keeps the GPU from saturating for the iterations dominated\nby decoding tokens. We propose BatchLLM to address the above problems. BatchLLM\nexplicitly identifies the common prefixes globally. The requests sharing the\nsame prefix will be scheduled together to reuse the KV context the best, which\nalso shrinks the lifetime of common KV memory.

It is responsible for reading massive amounts of training\ndata, processing batches of samples using complex transformations, and loading\nthem onto training nodes at low latency and high throughput. Performant input\ndata systems are becoming increasingly critical, driven by skyrocketing data\nvolumes and training throughput demands. Unfortunately, current input data\nsystems cannot fully leverage key performance optimizations, resulting in\nhugely inefficient infrastructures that require significant resources - or\nworse - underutilize expensive accelerators.\n  To address these demands, we present cedar, an optimized and unified\nprogramming framework for ML input data pipelines. cedar allows users to define\ninput data pipelines using composable operators that support arbitrary ML\nframeworks and libraries. cedar introduces an extensible optimizer that\nsystematically applies a complex combination of optimizations (e.g.,\noffloading, caching, prefetching, fusion, and reordering). It orchestrates\nprocessing across a customizable set of local and distributed compute resources\nin order to improve processing performance and efficiency, all without user\ninput. Across eight pipelines, cedar improves performance by up to 1.87x to\n10.65x compared to state-of-the-art input data systems.",

It is responsible for reading massive amounts of training\ndata, processing batches of samples using complex transformations, and loading\nthem onto training nodes at low latency and high throughput. Performant input\ndata systems are becoming increasingly critical, driven by skyrocketing data\nvolumes and training throughput demands. Unfortunately, current input data\nsystems cannot fully leverage key performance optimizations, resulting in\nhugely inefficient infrastructures that require significant resources - or\nworse - underutilize expensive accelerators.\n  To address these demands, we present cedar, an optimized and unified\nprogramming framework for ML input data pipelines. cedar allows users to define\ninput data pipelines using composable operators that support arbitrary ML\nframeworks and libraries. cedar introduces an extensible optimizer that\nsystematically applies a complex combination of optimizations (e.g.,\noffloading, caching, prefetching, fusion, and reordering). It orchestrates\nprocessing across a customizable set of local and distributed compute resources\nin order to improve processing performance and efficiency, all without user\ninput. Across eight pipelines, cedar improves performance by up to 1.87x to\n10.65x compared to state-of-the-art input data systems."

However, as the resolution and duration\nof generated videos increase, the encoding cost of Video VAEs becomes a\nlimiting bottleneck in training LVDMs. Moreover, the block-wise inference\nmethod adopted by most LVDMs can lead to discontinuities of latent space when\nprocessing long-duration videos. The key to addressing the computational\nbottleneck lies in decomposing videos into distinct components and efficiently\nencoding the critical information. Wavelet transform can decompose videos into\nmultiple frequency-domain components and improve the efficiency significantly,\nwe thus propose Wavelet Flow VAE (WF-VAE), an autoencoder that leverages\nmulti-level wavelet transform to facilitate low-frequency energy flow into\nlatent representation. Furthermore, we introduce a method called Causal Cache,\nwhich maintains the integrity of latent space during block-wise inference.\nCompared to state-of-the-art video VAEs, WF-VAE demonstrates superior\nperformance in both PSNR and LPIPS metrics, achieving 2x higher throughput and\n4x lower memory consumption while maintaining competitive reconstruction\nquality.

                "summary": "Inference for Large Language Models (LLMs) is computationally demanding. To\nreduce the cost of auto-regressive decoding, Key-Value (KV) caching is used to\nstore intermediate activations, enabling GPUs to perform only the incremental\ncomputation required for each new token. This approach significantly lowers the\ncomputational overhead for token generation. However, the memory required for\nKV caching grows rapidly, often exceeding the capacity of GPU memory. A\ncost-effective alternative is to offload KV cache to CPU memory, which\nalleviates GPU memory pressure but shifts the bottleneck to the limited\nbandwidth of the PCIe connection between the CPU and GPU. Existing methods\nattempt to address these issues by overlapping GPU computation with I/O or\nemploying CPU-GPU heterogeneous execution, but they are hindered by excessive\ndata movement and dependence on CPU capabilities. In this paper, we introduce\nan efficient CPU-GPU I/O-aware LLM inference method that avoids transferring\nthe entire KV cache from CPU to GPU by recomputing partial KV cache from\nactivations while concurrently transferring the remaining KV cache via PCIe\nbus. This approach overlaps GPU recomputation with data transfer to minimize\nidle GPU time and maximize inference performance. Our method is fully automated\nby integrating a profiler module that utilizes input characteristics and system\nhardware information, a scheduler module to optimize the distribution of\ncomputation and communication workloads, and a runtime module to efficiently\nexecute the derived execution plan.

                    "value": "Inference for Large Language Models (LLMs) is computationally demanding. To\nreduce the cost of auto-regressive decoding, Key-Value (KV) caching is used to\nstore intermediate activations, enabling GPUs to perform only the incremental\ncomputation required for each new token. This approach significantly lowers the\ncomputational overhead for token generation. However, the memory required for\nKV caching grows rapidly, often exceeding the capacity of GPU memory. A\ncost-effective alternative is to offload KV cache to CPU memory, which\nalleviates GPU memory pressure but shifts the bottleneck to the limited\nbandwidth of the PCIe connection between the CPU and GPU. Existing methods\nattempt to address these issues by overlapping GPU computation with I/O or\nemploying CPU-GPU heterogeneous execution, but they are hindered by excessive\ndata movement and dependence on CPU capabilities. In this paper, we introduce\nan efficient CPU-GPU I/O-aware LLM inference method that avoids transferring\nthe entire KV cache from CPU to GPU by recomputing partial KV cache from\nactivations while concurrently transferring the remaining KV cache via PCIe\nbus. This approach overlaps GPU recomputation with data transfer to minimize\nidle GPU time and maximize inference performance. Our method is fully automated\nby integrating a profiler module that utilizes input characteristics and system\nhardware information, a scheduler module to optimize the distribution of\ncomputation and communication workloads, and a runtime module to efficiently\nexecute the derived execution plan. Experimental results show that our method\nachieves up to 35.8% lower latency and 46.2% higher throughput during decoding\ncompared to state-of-the-art approaches."

We\npresent Deegen, a meta-compiler that allows users to generate a\nhigh-performance JIT-capable VM for their own language at an engineering cost\nsimilar to writing a simple interpreter. Deegen takes in the execution\nsemantics of the bytecodes implemented as C++ functions, and automatically\ngenerates a two-tier VM execution engine with a state-of-the-art interpreter, a\nstate-of-the-art baseline JIT, and the tier-switching logic that connects them\ninto a self-adaptive system.\n  We are the first to demonstrate the automatic generation of a JIT compiler,\nand the automatic generation of an interpreter that outperforms the state of\nthe art. Our performance comes from a long list of optimizations supported by\nDeegen, including bytecode specialization and quickening, register pinning, tag\nregister optimization, call inline caching, generic inline caching, JIT\npolymorphic IC, JIT IC inline slab, type-check removal and strength reduction,\ntype-based slow-path extraction and outlining, JIT hot-cold code splitting, and\nJIT OSR-entry. These optimizations are either employed automatically, or guided\nby the language implementer through intuitive APIs. As a result, the\ndisassembly of the Deegen-generated interpreter, baseline JIT, and the\ngenerated JIT code rivals the assembly code hand-written by experts in\nstate-of-the-art VMs.\n  We implement LuaJIT Remake (LJR), a standard-compliant Lua 5.1 VM, using\nDeegen. Across 44 benchmarks, LJR's interpreter is on average 179% faster than\nthe official PUC Lua interpreter, and 31% faster than LuaJIT's interpreter.\nLJR's baseline JIT has negligible startup delay, and its execution performance\nis on average 360% faster than PUC Lua and only 33% slower (but faster on 13/44\nbenchmarks) than LuaJIT's optimizing JIT.",

We further develop\nthe HRSAM++ within FLA by adding an anchor map, providing multi-scale data\naugmentation for the extrapolation and a larger receptive field at slight\ncomputational cost. Experiments show that, under standard training, HRSAMs\nsurpass the previous SOTA with only 38% of the latency.

In this work, we introduce AttriBoT, a series of novel techniques\nfor efficiently computing an approximation of the LOO error for context\nattribution. Specifically, AttriBoT uses cached activations to avoid redundant\noperations, performs hierarchical attribution to reduce computation, and\nemulates the behavior of large target models with smaller proxy models. Taken\ntogether, AttriBoT can provide a >300x speedup while remaining more faithful to\na target model's LOO error than prior context attribution methods. This stark\nincrease in performance makes computing context attributions for a given\nresponse 30x faster than generating the response itself, empowering real-world\napplications that require computing attributions at scale. We release a\nuser-friendly and efficient implementation of AttriBoT to enable efficient LLM\ninterpretability as well as encourage future development of efficient context\nattribution methods.",

Although there are various\ntechniques to calculate the reuse profile from dynamic memory traces, it is\nboth time and space-consuming due to the requirement to collect dynamic memory\ntraces at runtime. In contrast, static analysis reuse profile estimation is a\npromisingly faster approach since it is calculated at compile time without\nrunning the program or collecting memory traces. This work presents a static\nanalysis technique to estimate the reuse profile of loop-based programs. For an\ninput program, we generate a basic block-level control flow graph and the\nexecution count by analyzing the LLVM IR of the program. We present the memory\naccesses of the application kernel in a compact bracketed format and use a\nrecursive algorithm to predict the reuse distance histogram. We deploy a\nseparate predictor that unrolls the loop(s) for smaller bounds and generates a\ntemporary reuse distance profile for those small cases. Using these smaller\nprofiles, the reuse profile is extrapolated for the actual loop bound(s). We\nuse this reuse profile to predict the cache hit rate. Results show that our\nmodel can predict cache hit rates with an average accuracy of 95% relative to\nthe dynamic reuse profile methods.",

However,\nprevious works focus on extracting features either from the time domain or the\nfrequency domain, which inadequately captures the trends and periodic\ncharacteristics. To address this issue, we propose a wavelet learning framework\nto model complex temporal dependencies of the time series data. The wavelet\ndomain integrates both time and frequency information, allowing for the\nanalysis of local characteristics of signals at different scales. Additionally,\nthe Softmax self-attention mechanism used by Transformers has quadratic\ncomplexity, which leads to excessive computational costs when capturing\nlong-term dependencies. Therefore, we propose a novel attention mechanism:\nRotary Route Attention (RoRA). Unlike Softmax attention, RoRA utilizes rotary\nposition embeddings to inject relative positional information to sequence\ntokens and introduces a small number of routing tokens $r$ to aggregate\ninformation from the $KV$ matrices and redistribute it to the $Q$ matrix,\noffering linear complexity. We further propose WaveRoRA, which leverages RoRA\nto capture inter-series dependencies in the wavelet domain. We conduct\nextensive experiments on eight real-world datasets.

We design an\nalgorithm working in an architecture-friendly manner (AFM), which is a\nprocedure of suppressing performance-degradation factors such as the numbers of\ninstructions, branch mispredictions, and cache misses in CPUs of a modern\ncomputer system. For the AFM operation, we leverage unique universal\ncharacteristics (UCs) of a data-object and a cluster's mean set, which are\nskewed distributions on data relationships such as Zipf's law and a\nfeature-value concentration phenomenon. The UCs indicate that the most part of\nthe number of multiplications for similarity calculations is executed regarding\nterms with high document frequencies (df) and the most part of a similarity\nbetween an object- and a mean-feature vector is obtained by the multiplications\nregarding a few high mean-feature values. Our proposed algorithm applies an\ninverted-index data structure to a mean set, extracts the specific region with\nhigh-df terms and high mean-feature values in the mean-inverted index by newly\nintroduced two structural parameters, and exploits the index divided into three\nparts for efficient pruning. The algorithm determines the two structural\nparameters by minimizing the approximate number of multiplications related to\nthat of instructions, reduces the branch mispredictions by sharing the index\nstructure including the two parameters with all the objects, and suppressing\nthe cache misses by keeping in the caches the frequently used data in the\nforegoing specific region, resulting in working in the AFM. We experimentally\ndemonstrate that our algorithm efficiently achieves superior speed performance\nin large-scale documents compared with algorithms using the state-of-the-art\ntechniques.",

The UCs indicate that the most part of\nthe number of multiplications for similarity calculations is executed regarding\nterms with high document frequencies (df) and the most part of a similarity\nbetween an object- and a mean-feature vector is obtained by the multiplications\nregarding a few high mean-feature values. Our proposed algorithm applies an\ninverted-index data structure to a mean set, extracts the specific region with\nhigh-df terms and high mean-feature values in the mean-inverted index by newly\nintroduced two structural parameters, and exploits the index divided into three\nparts for efficient pruning. The algorithm determines the two structural\nparameters by minimizing the approximate number of multiplications related to\nthat of instructions, reduces the branch mispredictions by sharing the index\nstructure including the two parameters with all the objects, and suppressing\nthe cache misses by keeping in the caches the frequently used data in the\nforegoing specific region, resulting in working in the AFM. We experimentally\ndemonstrate that our algorithm efficiently achieves superior speed performance\nin large-scale documents compared with algorithms using the state-of-the-art\ntechniques."

The encouraging results, however, come with the\ncost of slow inference, since each denoising step requires inference on a\ntransformer model with a large scale of parameters. In this study, we make an\ninteresting and somehow surprising observation: the computation of a large\nproportion of layers in the diffusion transformer, through introducing a\ncaching mechanism, can be readily removed even without updating the model\nparameters. In the case of U-ViT-H/2, for example, we may remove up to 93.68%\nof the computation in the cache steps (46.84% for all steps), with less than\n0.01 drop in FID. To achieve this, we introduce a novel scheme, named\nLearning-to-Cache (L2C), that learns to conduct caching in a dynamic manner for\ndiffusion transformers. Specifically, by leveraging the identical structure of\nlayers in transformers and the sequential nature of diffusion, we explore\nredundant computations between timesteps by treating each layer as the\nfundamental unit for caching. To address the challenge of the exponential\nsearch space in deep models for identifying layers to cache and remove, we\npropose a novel differentiable optimization objective. An input-invariant yet\ntimestep-variant router is then optimized, which can finally produce a static\ncomputation graph. Experimental results show that L2C largely outperforms\nsamplers such as DDIM and DPM-Solver, alongside prior cache-based methods at\nthe same inference speed.

Our results show that the proposed four-plane latent space\nretains a rich representation needed for high-fidelity reconstructions despite\nthe heavy compression, while simultaneously enabling LDMs to operate with\nsignificant improvements in speed and memory."

We propose a novel feature-fusion architecture and\nan innovative training recipe that effectively integrates Florence-2's visual\nfeatures into pretrained LLMs, such as Phi 3.5 and LLama 3. In particular, we\npropose \"depth-breath fusion (DBFusion)\" to fuse the visual features extracted\nfrom different depths and under multiple prompts. Our model training is\ncomposed of end-to-end pretraining of the whole model followed by finetuning of\nthe projection layer and the LLM, on a carefully designed recipe of diverse\nopen-source datasets that include high-quality image captions and\ninstruction-tuning pairs. Our quantitative analysis and visualization of\nFlorence-VL's visual features show its advantages over popular vision encoders\non vision-language alignment, where the enriched depth and breath play\nimportant roles. Florence-VL achieves significant improvements over existing\nstate-of-the-art MLLMs across various multi-modal and vision-centric benchmarks\ncovering general VQA, perception, hallucination, OCR, Chart,\nknowledge-intensive understanding, etc. To facilitate future research, our\nmodels and the complete training recipe are open-sourced.\nhttps://github.com/JiuhaiChen/Florence-VL",

While useful, performing adversarial guidance using text alone can be\ninsufficient to capture complex visual concepts or avoid specific visual\nelements like copyrighted characters. In this paper, for the first time we\nexplore an alternate modality in this direction by performing adversarial\nguidance directly using visual features from a reference image or other images\nin a batch. We introduce negative token merging (NegToMe), a simple but\neffective training-free approach which performs adversarial guidance through\nimages by selectively pushing apart matching visual features between reference\nand generated images during the reverse diffusion process. By simply adjusting\nthe used reference, NegToMe enables a diverse range of applications. Notably,\nwhen using other images in same batch as reference, we find that NegToMe\nsignificantly enhances output diversity (e.g., racial, gender, visual) by\nguiding features of each image away from others. Similarly, when used w.r.t.\ncopyrighted reference images, NegToMe reduces visual similarity to copyrighted\ncontent by 34.57%. NegToMe is simple to implement using just few-lines of code,\nuses only marginally higher (<4%) inference time and is compatible with\ndifferent diffusion architectures, including those like Flux, which don't\nnatively support the use of a negative prompt.

Traditional object detection algorithms are\ninherently closed-set, limiting their capability to handle NOD. We present a\nnovel approach to transform existing closed-set detectors into open-set\ndetectors. This transformation is achieved by leveraging the complementary\nstrengths of pre-trained foundational models, specifically CLIP and SAM,\nthrough our cooperative mechanism. Furthermore, by integrating this mechanism\nwith state-of-the-art open-set detectors such as GDINO, we establish new\nbenchmarks in object detection performance. Our method achieves 17.42 mAP in\nnovel object detection and 42.08 mAP for known objects on the challenging LVIS\ndataset. Adapting our approach to the COCO OVD split, we surpass the current\nstate-of-the-art by a margin of 7.2 $ \\text{AP}_{50} $ for novel classes.

Recently, more LLMs have incorporated a larger proportion of\nmultilingual text to represent low-resource languages. In Arabic NLP, several\nArabic-centric LLMs have shown remarkable results on multiple benchmarks in the\npast two years. However, most Arabic LLMs have more than 7 billion parameters,\nwhich increases their hardware requirements and inference latency, when\ncompared to smaller LLMs. This paper introduces Arabic Stable LM 1.6B in a base\nand chat version as a small but powerful Arabic-centric LLM. Our Arabic Stable\nLM 1.6B chat model achieves impressive results on several benchmarks beating\nmultiple models with up to 8x the parameters. In addition, we show the benefit\nof mixing in synthetic instruction tuning data by augmenting our fine-tuning\ndata with a large synthetic dialogue dataset.",

In this paper, to address the issue, we propose DreamLCM which\nincorporates the Latent Consistency Model (LCM).

Powered\nby the improved guidance, the proposed method can provide accurate and detailed\ngradients to optimize the target 3D models. In addition, we propose two\nstrategies to enhance the generation quality further. Firstly, we propose a\nguidance calibration strategy, utilizing Euler Solver to calibrate the guidance\ndistribution to accelerate 3D models to converge. Secondly, we propose a dual\ntimestep strategy, increasing the consistency of guidance and optimizing 3D\nmodels from geometry to appearance in DreamLCM.

Despite their\nmerits, a comprehensive comparison and synergistic application of them to a\ndiverse model zoo is yet to be adequately addressed. In light of this research\ngap, this paper introduces Model-GLUE, a holistic LLM scaling guideline. First,\nour work starts with a benchmarking of existing LLM scaling techniques,\nespecially selective merging, and variants of mixture. Utilizing the insights\nfrom the benchmark results, we formulate an optimal strategy for the selection\nand aggregation of a heterogeneous model zoo characterizing different\narchitectures and initialization.Our methodology involves the clustering of\nmergeable models and optimal merging strategy selection, and the integration of\nclusters through a model mixture. Finally, evidenced by our experiments on a\ndiverse Llama-2-based model zoo, Model-GLUE shows an average performance\nenhancement of 5.61%, achieved without additional training.

Despite their\nmerits, a comprehensive comparison and synergistic application of them to a\ndiverse model zoo is yet to be adequately addressed. In light of this research\ngap, this paper introduces Model-GLUE, a holistic LLM scaling guideline. First,\nour work starts with a benchmarking of existing LLM scaling techniques,\nespecially selective merging, and variants of mixture. Utilizing the insights\nfrom the benchmark results, we formulate an optimal strategy for the selection\nand aggregation of a heterogeneous model zoo characterizing different\narchitectures and initialization.Our methodology involves the clustering of\nmergeable models and optimal merging strategy selection, and the integration of\nclusters through a model mixture. Finally, evidenced by our experiments on a\ndiverse Llama-2-based model zoo, Model-GLUE shows an average performance\nenhancement of 5.61%, achieved without additional training.

Notably,\nthe circuit generalizes even to prompt variants where the original algorithm\nshould fail; we discover a mechanism that explains this which we term S2\nHacking. Our findings indicate that circuits within LLMs may be more flexible\nand general than previously recognized, underscoring the importance of studying\ncircuit generalization to better understand the broader capabilities of these\nmodels."

However, two critical mismatches: low-latency Events\n\\textit{vs.}~high-latency RGB frames; temporally sparse labels in training\n\\textit{vs.}~continuous flow in inference, significantly hinder the\nhigh-frequency fusion-based object detection. To address these challenges, we\npropose the \\textbf{F}requency-\\textbf{A}daptive Low-Latency \\textbf{O}bject\n\\textbf{D}etector (FAOD). FAOD aligns low-frequency RGB frames with\nhigh-frequency Events through an Align Module, which reinforces cross-modal\nstyle and spatial proximity to address the Event-RGB Mismatch. We further\npropose a training strategy, Time Shift, which enforces the module to align the\nprediction from temporally shifted Event-RGB pairs and their original\nrepresentation, that is, consistent with Event-aligned annotations. This\nstrategy enables the network to use high-frequency Event data as the primary\nreference while treating low-frequency RGB images as supplementary information,\nretaining the low-latency nature of the Event stream toward high-frequency\ndetection. Furthermore, we observe that these corrected Event-RGB pairs\ndemonstrate better generalization from low training frequency to higher\ninference frequencies compared to using Event data alone. Extensive experiments\non the PKU-DAVIS-SOD and DSEC-Detection datasets demonstrate that our FAOD\nachieves SOTA performance. Specifically, in the PKU-DAVIS-SOD Dataset, FAOD\nachieves 9.8 points improvement in terms of the mAP in fully paired Event-RGB\ndata with only a quarter of the parameters compared to SODFormer, and even\nmaintains robust performance (only a 3 points drop in mAP) under 80$\\times$\nEvent-RGB frequency mismatch.",

We show that low-resource and unsophisticated attackers, i.e.\n$\\textit{stochastic monkeys}$, can significantly improve their chances of\nbypassing alignment with just 25 random augmentations per prompt.

We introduce the\nMATH-Prolog corpus, which is derived from the counting and probability\ncategories of the MATH corpus. For efficient data augmentation, we apply K-fold\ncross-validated self-training. This method incrementally generates new Prolog\nsolutions for each fold, incorporating those verified as correct into the\ntraining set throughout the model training process. Our experimental results\ndemonstrate that 5-fold crossvalidated self-training effectively identifies\nnew, accurate Prolog solutions, achieving an accuracy of 84.6% on the\ncross-validated set, and 84.8% on the test set during fine-tuning the\nMeta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct model. This approach successfully uncovers new\nsolutions with fully computable inference steps for previously unseen problems.\nAdditionally, incorporating the background mathematical predicates into the\nprompt enhances solution coverage.",

Additionally, we introduce a novel\nmodule aimed at alleviating the computational burden associated with exhaustive\nexploration of all possible compositions during the inference stage. While\nprevious methods exclusively learn compositions jointly or independently, we\nintroduce an advanced hybrid procedure that leverages both learning mechanisms\nto generate final predictions. Our proposed model, achieves state-of-the-art in\nOW-CZSL in three datasets, while surpassing Large Vision Language Models (LLVM)\nin two datasets."

We demonstrate\nthe efficiency of TSNPE over standard neural posterior estimation (NPE),\nachieving robust inferences of magneto-rotational parameters consistent with\nprevious studies using only around 4% of the simulations required by NPE\napproaches.

While\ntraditional methods for training on long contexts often use filtered long\ndocuments, these approaches lead to domain imbalances, limiting model\nperformance. To address this, techniques like random document concatenation\n(Standard) and similarity-based methods (KNN, ICLM) have been developed.\nHowever, they either sacrifice semantic coherence or diversity. To balance both\naspects, we introduce Quest, a query-centric data synthesis method aggregating\nsemantically relevant yet diverse documents. Quest uses a generative model to\npredict potential queries for each document, grouping documents with similar\nqueries and keywords. Extensive experiments demonstrate Quest's superior\nperformance on long-context tasks, achieving remarkable results with context\nlengths of up to 1M tokens and confirming its scalability across various model\nsizes.",

While\ntraditional methods for training on long contexts often use filtered long\ndocuments, these approaches lead to domain imbalances, limiting model\nperformance. To address this, techniques like random document concatenation\n(Standard) and similarity-based methods (KNN, ICLM) have been developed.\nHowever, they either sacrifice semantic coherence or diversity. To balance both\naspects, we introduce Quest, a query-centric data synthesis method aggregating\nsemantically relevant yet diverse documents. Quest uses a generative model to\npredict potential queries for each document, grouping documents with similar\nqueries and keywords. Extensive experiments demonstrate Quest's superior\nperformance on long-context tasks, achieving remarkable results with context\nlengths of up to 1M tokens and confirming its scalability across various model\nsizes."

                "summary": "We present Florence-VL, a new family of multimodal large language models\n(MLLMs) with enriched visual representations produced by Florence-2, a\ngenerative vision foundation model. Unlike the widely used CLIP-style vision\ntransformer trained by contrastive learning, Florence-2 can capture different\nlevels and aspects of visual features, which are more versatile to be adapted\nto diverse downstream tasks. We propose a novel feature-fusion architecture and\nan innovative training recipe that effectively integrates Florence-2's visual\nfeatures into pretrained LLMs, such as Phi 3.5 and LLama 3. In particular, we\npropose \"depth-breath fusion (DBFusion)\" to fuse the visual features extracted\nfrom different depths and under multiple prompts. Our model training is\ncomposed of end-to-end pretraining of the whole model followed by finetuning of\nthe projection layer and the LLM, on a carefully designed recipe of diverse\nopen-source datasets that include high-quality image captions and\ninstruction-tuning pairs. Our quantitative analysis and visualization of\nFlorence-VL's visual features show its advantages over popular vision encoders\non vision-language alignment, where the enriched depth and breath play\nimportant roles. Florence-VL achieves significant improvements over existing\nstate-of-the-art MLLMs across various multi-modal and vision-centric benchmarks\ncovering general VQA, perception, hallucination, OCR, Chart,\nknowledge-intensive understanding, etc. To facilitate future research, our\nmodels and the complete training recipe are open-sourced.\nhttps://github.com/JiuhaiChen/Florence-VL",

                    "value": "We present Florence-VL, a new family of multimodal large language models\n(MLLMs) with enriched visual representations produced by Florence-2, a\ngenerative vision foundation model. Unlike the widely used CLIP-style vision\ntransformer trained by contrastive learning, Florence-2 can capture different\nlevels and aspects of visual features, which are more versatile to be adapted\nto diverse downstream tasks. We propose a novel feature-fusion architecture and\nan innovative training recipe that effectively integrates Florence-2's visual\nfeatures into pretrained LLMs, such as Phi 3.5 and LLama 3. In particular, we\npropose \"depth-breath fusion (DBFusion)\" to fuse the visual features extracted\nfrom different depths and under multiple prompts. Our model training is\ncomposed of end-to-end pretraining of the whole model followed by finetuning of\nthe projection layer and the LLM, on a carefully designed recipe of diverse\nopen-source datasets that include high-quality image captions and\ninstruction-tuning pairs. Our quantitative analysis and visualization of\nFlorence-VL's visual features show its advantages over popular vision encoders\non vision-language alignment, where the enriched depth and breath play\nimportant roles. Florence-VL achieves significant improvements over existing\nstate-of-the-art MLLMs across various multi-modal and vision-centric benchmarks\ncovering general VQA, perception, hallucination, OCR, Chart,\nknowledge-intensive understanding, etc. To facilitate future research, our\nmodels and the complete training recipe are open-sourced.\nhttps://github.com/JiuhaiChen/Florence-VL"

Based on the observations, we further conduct fine-tuning exploration\nwith short-context summary data. In our study: (1) GPT-4o underperformed, due\nto excessive subjective commentary. (2) Currently, long-context summarization\nmainly relies on memory ability, small LLMs with stable longer context lengths\nare the most cost-effective. Using long data concatenated from short-context\nsummaries makes a significant improvement. (3) Prompt templates may cause a\nlarge performance gap but can be mitigated through fine-tuning. (4) Fine-tuned\nChat or Instruction versions may harm the Base model and further fine-tuning\ncannot bridge performance gap. (5) while models with RoPE base scaling exhibit\nstrong extrapolation potential, their performance may vary significantly when\ncombined with other interpolation methods and need careful selection. (6)\nCNNSum provides more reliable and insightful evaluation results than other\nbenchmarks. We release CNNSum to advance research in this field."

Unlike previous multimodal\nlarge language model (MLLM), Liquid achieves this integration using a single\nlarge language model (LLM), eliminating the need for external pretrained visual\nembeddings such as CLIP. For the first time, Liquid uncovers a scaling law that\nperformance drop unavoidably brought by the unified training of visual and\nlanguage tasks diminishes as the model size increases. Furthermore, the unified\ntoken space enables visual generation and comprehension tasks to mutually\nenhance each other, effectively removing the typical interference seen in\nearlier models. We show that existing LLMs can serve as strong foundations for\nLiquid, saving 100x in training costs while outperforming Chameleon in\nmultimodal capabilities and maintaining language performance comparable to\nmainstream LLMs like LLAMA2. Liquid also outperforms models like SD v2.1 and\nSD-XL (FID of 5.47 on MJHQ-30K), excelling in both vision-language and\ntext-only tasks. This work demonstrates that LLMs such as LLAMA3.2 and GEMMA2\nare powerful multimodal generators, offering a scalable solution for enhancing\nboth vision-language understanding and generation.

Distributed deployment has emerged as a potential\nsolution, but it necessitates the exchange of intermediate information between\nmodel segments, with feature representations serving as crucial information\ncarriers. To optimize information exchange, feature coding methods are applied\nto reduce transmission and storage overhead. Despite its importance, feature\ncoding for large models remains an under-explored area. In this paper, we draw\nattention to large model feature coding and make three contributions to this\nfield. First, we introduce a comprehensive dataset encompassing diverse\nfeatures generated by three representative types of large models.

                    "value": "Large models have achieved remarkable performance across various tasks, yet\nthey incur significant computational costs and privacy concerns during both\ntraining and inference. Distributed deployment has emerged as a potential\nsolution, but it necessitates the exchange of intermediate information between\nmodel segments, with feature representations serving as crucial information\ncarriers. To optimize information exchange, feature coding methods are applied\nto reduce transmission and storage overhead. Despite its importance, feature\ncoding for large models remains an under-explored area. In this paper, we draw\nattention to large model feature coding and make three contributions to this\nfield. First, we introduce a comprehensive dataset encompassing diverse\nfeatures generated by three representative types of large models. Second, we\nestablish unified test conditions, enabling standardized evaluation pipelines\nand fair comparisons across future feature coding studies. Third, we introduce\ntwo baseline methods derived from widely used image coding techniques and\nbenchmark their performance on the proposed dataset.

It is well known that one of the key challenges in\ninterpreting natural language questions with respect to SPARQL lies in bridging\nthe lexical gap, that is mapping the words in the query to the correct\nvocabulary elements. We argue in this paper that lexicalization, that is\nexplicit knowledge about the potential interpretations of a word with respect\nto the given vocabulary, significantly eases the task and increases the\nperformance of QA systems. Towards this goal, we present a compositional QA\nsystem that can leverage explicit lexical knowledge in a compositional manner\nto infer the meaning of a question in terms of a SPARQL query. We show that\nsuch a system, given lexical knowledge, has a performance well beyond current\nQA systems, achieving up to a $35.8\\%$ increase in the micro $F_1$ score\ncompared to the best QA system on QALD-9. This shows the importance and\npotential of including explicit lexical knowledge. In contrast, we show that\nLLMs have limited abilities to exploit lexical knowledge, with only marginal\nimprovements compared to a version without lexical knowledge. This shows that\nLLMs have no ability to compositionally interpret a question on the basis of\nthe meaning of its parts, a key feature of compositional approaches. Taken\ntogether, our work shows new avenues for QALD research, emphasizing the\nimportance of lexicalization and compositionality.",

In this study, we introduce SocialMind, the first\nLLM-based proactive AR social assistive system that provides users with in-situ\nsocial assistance. SocialMind employs human-like perception leveraging\nmulti-modal sensors to extract both verbal and nonverbal cues, social factors,\nand implicit personas, incorporating these social cues into LLM reasoning for\nsocial suggestion generation. Additionally, SocialMind employs a multi-tier\ncollaborative generation strategy and proactive update mechanism to display\nsocial suggestions on Augmented Reality (AR) glasses, ensuring that suggestions\nare timely provided to users without disrupting the natural flow of\nconversation. Evaluations on three public datasets and a user study with 20\nparticipants show that SocialMind achieves 38.3% higher engagement compared to\nbaselines, and 95% of participants are willing to use SocialMind in their live\nsocial interactions.",

To further demystify the operational principles, this work examines\nthree key aspects: decoding, projection, and activation, aiming to elucidate\nthe changes that occur within models when employing Chainof-Thought. Our\nfindings reveal that LLMs effectively imitate exemplar formats while\nintegrating them with their understanding of the question, exhibiting\nfluctuations in token logits during generation but ultimately producing a more\nconcentrated logits distribution, and activating a broader set of neurons in\nthe final layers, indicating more extensive knowledge retrieval compared to\nstandard prompts.

However, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly\nunderstood. To further demystify the operational principles, this work examines\nthree key aspects: decoding, projection, and activation, aiming to elucidate\nthe changes that occur within models when employing Chainof-Thought. Our\nfindings reveal that LLMs effectively imitate exemplar formats while\nintegrating them with their understanding of the question, exhibiting\nfluctuations in token logits during generation but ultimately producing a more\nconcentrated logits distribution, and activating a broader set of neurons in\nthe final layers, indicating more extensive knowledge retrieval compared to\nstandard prompts. Our code and data will be publicly avialable when the paper\nis accepted."

The methodology\nfor estimating global horizontal irradiance (GHI) across Thailand relies on\ncloud index extracted from Himawari-8 satellite imagery, Ineichen clear-sky\nmodel with locally-tuned Linke turbidity, and machine learning models. The\nmethods take clear-sky irradiance, cloud index, re-analyzed GHI and temperature\ndata from the MERRA-2 database, and date-time as inputs for GHI estimation\nmodels, including LightGBM, LSTM, Informer, and Transformer. These are\nbenchmarked with the estimate from a commercial service X by evaluation of\n15-minute ground GHI data from 53 ground stations over 1.5 years during\n2022-2023. The results show that the four models exhibit comparable overall MAE\nperformance to the service X. The best model is LightGBM with an overall MAE of\n78.58 W/sqm and RMSE of 118.97 W/sqm, while the service X achieves the lowest\nMAE, RMSE, and MBE in cloudy condition. Obtaining re-analyzed MERRA-2 data for\nthe whole Thailand region is not economically feasible for deployment. When\nremoving these features, the Informer model has a winning performance in MAE of\n78.67 W/sqm. The obtained performance aligns with existing literature by taking\nthe climate zone and time granularity of data into consideration. As the map\nshows an estimate of GHI over 93,000 grids with a frequent update, the paper\nalso describes a computational framework for displaying the entire map. It\ntests the runtime performance of deep learning models in the GHI estimation\nprocess.",

MegaCOIN~provides three annotated features for 220,000\nreal images: foreground color, background color, and description of an object's\nphysical environment, constituting 660k human annotations. In addition,\nMegaCOIN can be applied to benchmark domain generalization (DG) algorithms. We\nexplore benchmarking DG methods in the linear probing setup for VLM and show\nsome new insights. Last but not least, we show that VLMs, including GPT-4o,\nhave subpar color recognition capabilities, and fine-tuning with MegaCOIN can\nresult in improved performance on visual evaluation tasks. In certain cases,\nMegaCOIN fine-tuned small-scale opensource models such as LLaVA and Bunny can\noutperform closed-source GPT-4o.

MegaCOIN~provides three annotated features for 220,000\nreal images: foreground color, background color, and description of an object's\nphysical environment, constituting 660k human annotations. In addition,\nMegaCOIN can be applied to benchmark domain generalization (DG) algorithms. We\nexplore benchmarking DG methods in the linear probing setup for VLM and show\nsome new insights. Last but not least, we show that VLMs, including GPT-4o,\nhave subpar color recognition capabilities, and fine-tuning with MegaCOIN can\nresult in improved performance on visual evaluation tasks. In certain cases,\nMegaCOIN fine-tuned small-scale opensource models such as LLaVA and Bunny can\noutperform closed-source GPT-4o. We hope the utilities of MegaCOIN can shed\nlight on the directions VLMs can improve and provide a more complex platform\nfor domain generalization algorithms."

To address this, two critical steps are often required: a\npretrained LLM typically undergoes a separate stage for context length\nextension by training on long-context data, followed by architectural\nmodifications to reduce the overhead of KV cache during serving. This paper\nargues that integrating length extension with a GPU-friendly KV cache reduction\narchitecture not only reduces training overhead during length extension, but\nalso achieves better long-context performance. This leads to our proposed\nLongGen, which finetunes a pretrained LLM into an efficient architecture during\nlength extension. LongGen builds on three key insights: (1) Sparse attention\npatterns, such as window attention (attending to recent tokens), attention sink\n(initial ones), and blockwise sparse attention (strided token blocks) are\nwell-suited for building efficient long-context models, primarily due to their\nGPU-friendly memory access patterns, enabling efficiency gains not just\ntheoretically but in practice as well. (2) It is essential for the model to\nhave direct access to all tokens. A hybrid architecture with 1/3 full attention\nlayers and 2/3 efficient ones achieves a balanced trade-off between efficiency\nand long-context performance. (3) Lightweight training on 5B long-context data\nis sufficient to extend the hybrid model's context length from 4K to 128K.\n  We evaluate LongGen on both Llama-2 7B and Llama-2 70B, demonstrating its\neffectiveness across different scales. During training with 128K-long contexts,\nLongGen achieves 1.55x training speedup and reduces wall-clock time by 36%,\ncompared to a full-attention baseline. During inference, LongGen reduces KV\ncache memory by 62%, achieving 1.67x prefilling speedup and 1.41x decoding\nspeedup.",

In this paper, we propose evaluations for instrumental self-reasoning\nability in agentic tasks in a wide range of scenarios, including\nself-modification, knowledge seeking, and opaque self-reasoning. We evaluate\nagents built using state-of-the-art LLMs, including commercial and open source\nsystems. We find that instrumental self-reasoning ability emerges only in the\nmost capable frontier models and that it is highly context-dependent. No model\npasses the the most difficult versions of our evaluations, hence our evaluation\ncan be used to measure increases in instrumental self-reasoning ability in\nfuture models.

By\nutilizing readiness factors, including mobile money deployment, GDP per capita,\ninternet penetration, and digital infrastructure, the preparedness of African\ncountries for e-commerce adoption is quantified, highlighting significant\ndisparities. Through case studies in urban and rural areas, including Lagos,\nKano, Nairobi, and the Rift Valley, the study shows e-commerce's significant\neffects on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), employment, and market\nefficiency. Urban centers demonstrated significant gains in productivity and\nprofitability, whereas rural regions experienced slower growth due to limited\ninternet access and infrastructural barriers. Despite these challenges,\nlocalized solutions such as mobile money systems and agricultural e-commerce\nplatforms are bridging gaps. This study highlights the significant potential of\ne-commerce in Africa while emphasizing the need for targeted investments and\nstrategies to address existing regional disparities.",

                    "value": "E-commerce is rapidly transforming economies across Africa, offering immense\nopportunities for economic growth, market expansion, and digital inclusion.\nThis study investigates the effects of e-commerce on select African regions. By\nutilizing readiness factors, including mobile money deployment, GDP per capita,\ninternet penetration, and digital infrastructure, the preparedness of African\ncountries for e-commerce adoption is quantified, highlighting significant\ndisparities. Through case studies in urban and rural areas, including Lagos,\nKano, Nairobi, and the Rift Valley, the study shows e-commerce's significant\neffects on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), employment, and market\nefficiency. Urban centers demonstrated significant gains in productivity and\nprofitability, whereas rural regions experienced slower growth due to limited\ninternet access and infrastructural barriers. Despite these challenges,\nlocalized solutions such as mobile money systems and agricultural e-commerce\nplatforms are bridging gaps. This study highlights the significant potential of\ne-commerce in Africa while emphasizing the need for targeted investments and\nstrategies to address existing regional disparities."

Our development process encompasses\ncomprehensive pre-training, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and reinforcement\nlearning from human feedback (RLHF), where we devise deliberate strategies for\nmulti-stage training, synthetic data construction, and reward modeling.\nFurthermore, we implement RAISE (Responsible AI Safety Engine), a\nfour-component framework to address safety issues across pre-training,\npost-training, and serving phases. Empowered by our scalable super-computing\ninfrastructure, all these innovations substantially reduce training, deployment\nand inference costs while maintaining high-performance standards. With further\nevaluations on public academic benchmarks, Yi-Lightning demonstrates\ncompetitive performance against top-tier LLMs, while we observe a notable\ndisparity between traditional, static benchmark results and real-world, dynamic\nhuman preferences.

The other is the intrinsic\npositional bias introduced by the decoder-only architecture. To deal with this\nissue, we propose a novel framework to fully harness the capabilities of LLMs.\nThrough the carefully designed usage guidance, we effectively enhance the text\nrepresentation capability for prompt encoding and eliminate its inherent\npositional bias.
