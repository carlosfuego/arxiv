Caching all Key and Value (KV)\nstates across all attention heads consumes substantial memory. Existing KV\ncache pruning methods either damage the long-context capabilities of LLMs or\noffer only limited efficiency improvements. In this paper, we identify that\nonly a fraction of attention heads, a.k.a, Retrieval Heads, are critical for\nprocessing long contexts and require full attention across all tokens. In\ncontrast, all other heads, which primarily focus on recent tokens and attention\nsinks--referred to as Streaming Heads--do not require full attention. Based on\nthis insight, we introduce DuoAttention, a framework that only applies a full\nKV cache to retrieval heads while using a light-weight, constant-length KV\ncache for streaming heads, which reduces both LLM's decoding and pre-filling\nmemory and latency without compromising its long-context abilities.\nDuoAttention uses a lightweight, optimization-based algorithm with synthetic\ndata to identify retrieval heads accurately. Our method significantly reduces\nlong-context inference memory by up to 2.55x for MHA and 1.67x for GQA models\nwhile speeding up decoding by up to 2.18x and 1.50x and accelerating\npre-filling by up to 1.73x and 1.63x for MHA and GQA models, respectively, with\nminimal accuracy loss compared to full attention.

                "summary": "We introduce a new paradigm for AutoRegressive (AR) image generation, termed\nSet AutoRegressive Modeling (SAR). SAR generalizes the conventional AR to the\nnext-set setting, i.e., splitting the sequence into arbitrary sets containing\nmultiple tokens, rather than outputting each token in a fixed raster order. To\naccommodate SAR, we develop a straightforward architecture termed Fully Masked\nTransformer. We reveal that existing AR variants correspond to specific design\nchoices of sequence order and output intervals within the SAR framework, with\nAR and Masked AR (MAR) as two extreme instances. Notably, SAR facilitates a\nseamless transition from AR to MAR, where intermediate states allow for\ntraining a causal model that benefits from both few-step inference and KV cache\nacceleration, thus leveraging the advantages of both AR and MAR. On the\nImageNet benchmark, we carefully explore the properties of SAR by analyzing the\nimpact of sequence order and output intervals on performance, as well as the\ngeneralization ability regarding inference order and steps.

                    "value": "We introduce a new paradigm for AutoRegressive (AR) image generation, termed\nSet AutoRegressive Modeling (SAR). SAR generalizes the conventional AR to the\nnext-set setting, i.e., splitting the sequence into arbitrary sets containing\nmultiple tokens, rather than outputting each token in a fixed raster order. To\naccommodate SAR, we develop a straightforward architecture termed Fully Masked\nTransformer. We reveal that existing AR variants correspond to specific design\nchoices of sequence order and output intervals within the SAR framework, with\nAR and Masked AR (MAR) as two extreme instances. Notably, SAR facilitates a\nseamless transition from AR to MAR, where intermediate states allow for\ntraining a causal model that benefits from both few-step inference and KV cache\nacceleration, thus leveraging the advantages of both AR and MAR. On the\nImageNet benchmark, we carefully explore the properties of SAR by analyzing the\nimpact of sequence order and output intervals on performance, as well as the\ngeneralization ability regarding inference order and steps. We further validate\nthe potential of SAR by training a 900M text-to-image model capable of\nsynthesizing photo-realistic images with any resolution. We hope our work may\ninspire more exploration and application of AR-based modeling across diverse\nmodalities."

To increase capacity, high bit-density cells, such as Triple-Level\nCell (TLC), are utilized within 3D SSDs.

In SLC/TLC hybrid 3D SSDs, a portion of the TLC space is designated\nas an SLC cache to achieve high SSD performance by writing host data at the SLC\nspeed. Given the limited size of the SLC cache, block reclamation is necessary\nto free up the SLC cache during idle periods. However, our preliminary studies\nindicate that the SLC cache can lead to a performance cliff if filled rapidly\nand cause significant write amplification when data migration occurs during\nidle times.\n  In this work, we propose leveraging a reprogram operation to address these\nchallenges. Specifically, when the SLC cache is full or during idle periods, a\nreprogram operation is performed to switch used SLC pages to TLC pages in place\n(termed In-place Switch, IPS). Subsequently, other free TLC space is allocated\nas the new SLC cache. IPS can continuously provide sufficient SLC cache within\nSSDs, significantly improving write performance and reducing write\namplification.

Nonetheless, the existing cache model overlooks\nthree crucial aspects. 1) Pre-trained VLMs are mainly optimized for image-text\nsimilarity, neglecting the importance of image-image similarity, leading to a\ngap between pre-training and adaptation. 2) The current cache model is based on\nthe Nadaraya-Watson (N-W) estimator, which disregards the intricate\nrelationships among training samples while constructing weight function. 3)\nUnder the condition of limited samples, the logits generated by cache model are\nof high uncertainty, directly using these logits without accounting for the\nconfidence could be problematic. This work presents three calibration modules\naimed at addressing the above challenges. Similarity Calibration refines the\nimage-image similarity by using unlabeled images. We add a learnable projection\nlayer with residual connection on top of the pre-trained image encoder of CLIP\nand optimize the parameters by minimizing self-supervised contrastive loss.\nWeight Calibration introduces a precision matrix into the weight function to\nadequately model the relation between training samples, transforming the\nexisting cache model to a Gaussian Process (GP) regressor, which could be more\naccurate than N-W estimator. Confidence Calibration leverages the predictive\nvariances computed by GP Regression to dynamically re-scale the logits of cache\nmodel, ensuring that the cache model's outputs are appropriately adjusted based\non their confidence levels. Besides, to reduce the high complexity of GPs, we\nfurther propose a group-based learning strategy. Integrating the above designs,\nwe propose both training-free and training-required variants.

However, most studies focus on addressing only one of these\nbottlenecks and do not adequately support dynamic adjustment of sparsity\nconcerning distinct layers or tasks. In this paper, we present ZipVL, an\nefficient inference framework designed for LVLMs that resolves both computation\nand memory bottlenecks through a dynamic ratio allocation strategy of important\ntokens. This ratio is adaptively determined based on the layer-specific\ndistribution of attention scores, rather than fixed hyper-parameters, thereby\nimproving efficiency for less complex tasks while maintaining high performance\nfor more challenging ones. Then we select important tokens based on their\nnormalized attention scores and perform attention mechanism solely on those\nimportant tokens to accelerate the prefill phase. To mitigate the memory\nbottleneck in the decoding phase, we employ mixed-precision quantization to the\nKV cache, where high-bit quantization is used for caches of important tokens,\nwhile low-bit quantization is applied to those of less importance. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that ZipVL can accelerate the prefill phase by\n2.6$\\times$ and reduce GPU memory usage by 50.0%, with a minimal accuracy\nreduction of only 0.2% on Video-MME benchmark over LongVA-7B model, effectively\nenhancing the generation efficiency of LVLMs.",

To achieve this, our method introduces the\nfollowing technical designs. 1) We directly compress the activations (i.e. keys\nand values at every layer), rather than leveraging soft prompts to relay\ninformation (which constitute a major bottleneck to encapsulate the complex\ninformation within long contexts). 2) We tailor the compression workflow, where\neach fine-grained input unit is progressively compressed, enabling high-quality\ncompression and efficient computation during both training and inference. 3) We\ntrain the model through compression-based auto-regression, making full use of\nplain texts and instructional data to optimize the model's compression\nperformance. 4) During training, we randomly sample a compression ratio at each\nstep, teaching the model to support a wide range of compression configurations.\nExtensive evaluations are conducted on various long-context tasks whose lengths\n(e.g., 128K) may far exceed the maximum training length (20K), such as document\nunderstanding, few-shot learning, and Needle-in-a-Haystack. Whilst existing\nmethods struggle to handle these challenging tasks, Activation Beacon maintains\na comparable performance to the uncompressed baseline across various scenarios,\nachieving a 2x acceleration in inference time and an 8x reduction of memory\ncosts for KV cache.

Probabilistic voxel mapping requires storing past point clouds and\nre-iterating on them to update the uncertainty every iteration, which consumes\nlarge memory space and CPU cycles. To solve this problem, we propose a\ntwo-folded strategy. First, we introduce a compact point-free representation\nfor probabilistic voxels and derive a cumulative update of the planar\nuncertainty without caching original point clouds. Our voxel structure only\nkeeps track of a predetermined set of statistics for points that lie inside it.\nThis method reduces the runtime complexity from $O(MN)$ to $O(N)$ and the space\ncomplexity from $O(N)$ to $O(1)$ where $M$ is the number of iterations and $N$\nis the number of points. Second, to further minimize memory usage and enhance\nmapping accuracy, we provide a strategy to dynamically merge voxels associated\nwith the same physical planes by taking advantage of the geometric features in\nthe real world. Rather than scanning for these coalescible voxels constantly at\nevery iteration, our merging strategy accumulates voxels in a\nlocality-sensitive hash and triggers merging lazily.

                    "value": "This work presents a compact, cumulative and coalescible probabilistic voxel\nmapping method to enhance performance, accuracy and memory efficiency in LiDAR\nodometry. Probabilistic voxel mapping requires storing past point clouds and\nre-iterating on them to update the uncertainty every iteration, which consumes\nlarge memory space and CPU cycles. To solve this problem, we propose a\ntwo-folded strategy. First, we introduce a compact point-free representation\nfor probabilistic voxels and derive a cumulative update of the planar\nuncertainty without caching original point clouds. Our voxel structure only\nkeeps track of a predetermined set of statistics for points that lie inside it.\nThis method reduces the runtime complexity from $O(MN)$ to $O(N)$ and the space\ncomplexity from $O(N)$ to $O(1)$ where $M$ is the number of iterations and $N$\nis the number of points. Second, to further minimize memory usage and enhance\nmapping accuracy, we provide a strategy to dynamically merge voxels associated\nwith the same physical planes by taking advantage of the geometric features in\nthe real world. Rather than scanning for these coalescible voxels constantly at\nevery iteration, our merging strategy accumulates voxels in a\nlocality-sensitive hash and triggers merging lazily. On-demand merging not only\nreduces memory footprint with minimal computational overhead but also improves\nlocalization accuracy thanks to cross-voxel denoising. Experiments exhibit 20%\nhigher accuracy, 20% faster performance and 70% lower memory consumption than\nthe state-of-the-art."

Tackling this challenge, as\ndefined, relies on a bi-level optimization algorithm: a novel model is trained\nin each iteration within a nested loop, with gradients propagated through an\nunrolled computation graph. However, this approach incurs high memory and time\ncomplexity, posing difficulties in scaling up to large datasets such as\nImageNet. Addressing these concerns, this paper introduces Teddy, a\nTaylor-approximated dataset distillation framework designed to handle\nlarge-scale dataset and enhance efficiency.

Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed\nTeddy attains state-of-the-art efficiency and performance on the Tiny-ImageNet\nand original-sized ImageNet-1K dataset, notably surpassing prior methods by up\nto 12.8%, while reducing 46.6% runtime.

However, existing Edge Computing (EC)\nsimulators, as well as general-purpose vehicular network simulators, are not\ntailored for VEC and lack dedicated support for modeling the distinct access\npattern, entity mobility trajectory and other unique characteristics of VEC\nnetworks. To fill this gap, this paper proposes VEC-Sim, a versatile simulation\nplatform for in-depth evaluation and analysis of various service caching and\ncomputation offloading policies in VEC networks.

                    "value": "Computer simulation platforms offer an alternative solution by emulating\ncomplex systems in a controlled manner. However, existing Edge Computing (EC)\nsimulators, as well as general-purpose vehicular network simulators, are not\ntailored for VEC and lack dedicated support for modeling the distinct access\npattern, entity mobility trajectory and other unique characteristics of VEC\nnetworks. To fill this gap, this paper proposes VEC-Sim, a versatile simulation\nplatform for in-depth evaluation and analysis of various service caching and\ncomputation offloading policies in VEC networks.

By distributing\nstates across nodes and enabling efficient data retrieval through a\nKademlia-inspired routing protocol, we reduce storage costs for validators.\nCryptographic proofs (such as Merkle proofs) are used to allow nodes to verify\ndata stored by other nodes without having to trust those nodes directly. While\nthe protocol trades off data storage for increased network bandwidth, we show\nhow gossiping and caching can minimize the increased bandwidth needs.\n  To validate our state sharing protocol, we conduct an extensive quantitative\nanalysis of Ethereum's data storage and data access patterns.

Considering the first scenario, an agent observes useful data that\nis correlated with private data, and wants to disclose the useful information\nto a user.

Hence,\na privacy mechanism is designed to generate disclosed data which maximizes the\nrevealed information about the useful data while satisfying a privacy\nconstraint. In the second scenario, the agent has additionally access to the\nprivate data. We discuss how the Functional Representation Lemma, the Strong\nFunctional Representation Lemma, and their extended versions are useful for\ndesigning low-complexity privacy mechanisms that achieve optimal\nprivacy-utility trade-offs under certain constraints. Furthermore, another\nprivacy design problem is presented where part of the private attribute is more\nprivate than the remaining part.

Hence,\na privacy mechanism is designed to generate disclosed data which maximizes the\nrevealed information about the useful data while satisfying a privacy\nconstraint. In the second scenario, the agent has additionally access to the\nprivate data. We discuss how the Functional Representation Lemma, the Strong\nFunctional Representation Lemma, and their extended versions are useful for\ndesigning low-complexity privacy mechanisms that achieve optimal\nprivacy-utility trade-offs under certain constraints. Furthermore, another\nprivacy design problem is presented where part of the private attribute is more\nprivate than the remaining part. Finally, we provide applications including\nsemantic communications, caching and delivery, and compression designs, where\nthe approach can be applied."

Our approach is useful for any quantum circuit simulations, including\nQSU and/or EVC."

Our method\noutperforms a variety of meta-RL baselines in adapting to unseen houses in an\nembodied multi-object navigation task. In addition, we find that ReLIC is\ncapable of few-shot imitation learning despite never being trained with expert\ndemonstrations. We also provide a comprehensive analysis of ReLIC, highlighting\nthat the combination of large-scale RL training, the proposed partial updates\nscheme, and the Sink-KV are essential for effective in-context learning.

In addition, we find that ReLIC is\ncapable of few-shot imitation learning despite never being trained with expert\ndemonstrations. We also provide a comprehensive analysis of ReLIC, highlighting\nthat the combination of large-scale RL training, the proposed partial updates\nscheme, and the Sink-KV are essential for effective in-context learning. The\ncode for ReLIC and all our experiments is at https://github.com/aielawady/relic"

However, scaling the\ngeneration inference of LLMs to such long contexts incurs significant\nadditional computation load, and demands a substantial GPU memory footprint to\nmaintain the key-value (KV) cache of transformer-based LLMs. Existing KV cache\ncompression methods, such as quantization, face memory bottlenecks as context\nlength increases, while static-sized caches, such as eviction, suffer from\ninefficient policies. These limitations restrict deployment on consumer-grade\ndevices like a single Nvidia 4090 GPU. To overcome this, we propose Locret, a\nframework for long-context LLM inference that introduces retaining heads to\nevaluate the causal importance of KV cache units, allowing for more accurate\neviction within a fixed cache size. Locret is fine-tuned on top of the frozen\nbackbone LLM using a minimal amount of data from standard long-context SFT\ndatasets. During inference, we evict low-importance cache units along with a\nchunked prefill pattern, significantly reducing peak GPU memory usage. We\nconduct an extensive empirical study to evaluate Locret, where the experimental\nresults show that Locret outperforms the recent competitive approaches,\nincluding InfLLM, Quantization, SirLLM, and MInference, in terms of memory\nefficiency and the quality of generated contents -- Locret achieves over a 20x\nand 8x KV cache compression ratio compared to the full KV cache for\nPhi-3-mini-128K and Llama-3.1-8B-instruct. Additionally, Locret can be combined\nwith other methods, such as quantization and token merging. To our knowledge,\nLocret is the first framework capable of deploying Llama-3.1-8B or similar\nmodels on a single Nvidia 4090 GPU, enabling 128K long-context inference\nwithout compromising generation quality, and requiring little additional system\noptimizations.",

                "summary": "Training and serving long-context large language models (LLMs) incurs\nsubstantial overhead. To address this, two critical steps are often required: a\npretrained LLM typically undergoes a separate stage for context length\nextension by training on long-context data, followed by architectural\nmodifications to reduce the overhead of KV cache during serving. This paper\nargues that integrating length extension with a GPU-friendly KV cache reduction\narchitecture not only reduces training overhead during length extension, but\nalso achieves better long-context performance. This leads to our proposed\nLongGen, which finetunes a pretrained LLM into an efficient architecture during\nlength extension. LongGen builds on three key insights: (1) Sparse attention\npatterns, such as window attention (attending to recent tokens), attention sink\n(initial ones), and blockwise sparse attention (strided token blocks) are\nwell-suited for building efficient long-context models, primarily due to their\nGPU-friendly memory access patterns, enabling efficiency gains not just\ntheoretically but in practice as well. (2) It is essential for the model to\nhave direct access to all tokens. A hybrid architecture with 1/3 full attention\nlayers and 2/3 efficient ones achieves a balanced trade-off between efficiency\nand long-context performance. (3) Lightweight training on 5B long-context data\nis sufficient to extend the hybrid model's context length from 4K to 128K.\n  We evaluate LongGen on both Llama-2 7B and Llama-2 70B, demonstrating its\neffectiveness across different scales. During training with 128K-long contexts,\nLongGen achieves 1.55x training speedup and reduces wall-clock time by 36%,\ncompared to a full-attention baseline. During inference, LongGen reduces KV\ncache memory by 62%, achieving 1.67x prefilling speedup and 1.41x decoding\nspeedup.",

The autoregressive decoding process further\ncompounds the error of each step, resulting in critical deviation in model\ngeneration and deterioration of performance. To tackle this challenge, we\npropose GEAR, an efficient KV cache compression framework that achieves\nnear-lossless high-ratio compression.

It then\nemploys a low rank matrix to approximate the quantization error, and a sparse\nmatrix to remedy individual errors from outlier entries. By adeptly integrating\nthree techniques, GEAR is able to fully exploit their synergistic potentials.\nOur experiments demonstrate that compared to alternatives, GEAR achieves\nnear-lossless 4-bit KV cache compression with up to 2.38x throughput\nimprovement, while reducing peak-memory size up to 2.29x.

This strategy aims to\nminimize unnecessary handovers (HOs) experienced by users by leveraging caching\ncapabilities at user equipment (UE).

Unlike\nfew-shot learning methods in natural images that can leverage the labels of\neach image, existing few-shot WSI classification methods only utilize a small\nnumber of fine-grained labels or weakly supervised slide labels for training in\norder to avoid expensive fine-grained annotation. They lack sufficient mining\nof available WSIs, severely limiting WSI classification performance. To address\nthe above issues, we propose a novel and efficient dual-tier few-shot learning\nparadigm for WSI classification, named FAST. FAST consists of a dual-level\nannotation strategy and a dual-branch classification framework. Firstly, to\navoid expensive fine-grained annotation, we collect a very small number of WSIs\nat the slide level, and annotate an extremely small number of patches. Then, to\nfully mining the available WSIs, we use all the patches and available patch\nlabels to build a cache branch, which utilizes the labeled patches to learn the\nlabels of unlabeled patches and through knowledge retrieval for patch\nclassification. In addition to the cache branch, we also construct a prior\nbranch that includes learnable prompt vectors, using the text encoder of\nvisual-language models for patch classification. Finally, we integrate the\nresults from both branches to achieve WSI classification. Extensive experiments\non binary and multi-class datasets demonstrate that our proposed method\nsignificantly surpasses existing few-shot classification methods and approaches\nthe accuracy of fully supervised methods with only 0.22$\\%$ annotation costs.\nAll codes and models will be publicly available on\nhttps://github.com/fukexue/FAST.",

The segments were converted\nto stereolithographic (STL) files and smoothed in Fusion360. A slit to\naccommodate a radiochromic film (RCF) was added at the location of the glioma\ntumor. UPDOG was 3D printed on a polyjet printer using VeroUltraWhite ($\\rho$ =\n1.19-1.20 g/cm\\textsuperscript{3}) for the bone and Agilus30 ($\\rho$ =\n1.14-1.15 g/cm\\textsuperscript{3}) for the soft tissue. CT scans of UPDOG were\nacquired on a clinical CT scanner. An LD-V1 RCF was inserted into UPDOG and\nirradiated with a kV x-ray source from two angles. The delivered dose to the\nRCF was compared to Monte Carlo (MC) simulations performed in TOPAS.\n  Results: The bone and soft tissue segments in UPDOG were mimicked the patient\nanatomy well with tube voltage-dependent CT numbers. The contrast in HU was of\n49, 47 and 50 HU for the 80, 100, and 120 kVp scans, respectively, sufficient\nfor anatomy visualization. The irradiations delivered a maximum dose to RCF of\n284 mGy which was compared to the results of MC simulations using a depth dose\ncurve and central-axis (CAX) beam profiles. The mean difference in CAX profiles\nand PDD between RCF and MC results was 15.9\\% and 2.3\\%, respectively.\n  Conclusions: We have demonstrated that UPDOG is a useful QA tool for kV\ncanine radiotherapy. UPDOG successfully anatomically mimicked the dog anatomy,\nwith a reduced but sufficient bone contrast. We showed that dose delivered to a\ncanine glioma with kV x-rays can be successfully measured with an RCF\npositioned at the tumor location.",

                "summary": "As large language models (LLMs) evolve to handle increasingly longer\ncontexts, serving inference requests for context lengths in the range of\nmillions of tokens presents unique challenges. While existing techniques are\neffective for training, they fail to address the unique challenges of\ninference, such as varying prefill and decode phases and their associated\nlatency constraints - like Time to First Token (TTFT) and Time Between Tokens\n(TBT). Furthermore, there are no long context inference solutions that allow\nbatching requests to increase the hardware utilization today.\n  In this paper, we propose three key innovations for efficient interactive\nlong context LLM inference, without resorting to any approximation: adaptive\nchunking to reduce prefill overheads in mixed batching, Sequence Pipeline\nParallelism (SPP) to lower TTFT, and KV Cache Parallelism (KVP) to minimize\nTBT.

                    "value": "As large language models (LLMs) evolve to handle increasingly longer\ncontexts, serving inference requests for context lengths in the range of\nmillions of tokens presents unique challenges. While existing techniques are\neffective for training, they fail to address the unique challenges of\ninference, such as varying prefill and decode phases and their associated\nlatency constraints - like Time to First Token (TTFT) and Time Between Tokens\n(TBT). Furthermore, there are no long context inference solutions that allow\nbatching requests to increase the hardware utilization today.\n  In this paper, we propose three key innovations for efficient interactive\nlong context LLM inference, without resorting to any approximation: adaptive\nchunking to reduce prefill overheads in mixed batching, Sequence Pipeline\nParallelism (SPP) to lower TTFT, and KV Cache Parallelism (KVP) to minimize\nTBT. These contributions are combined into a 3D parallelism strategy, enabling\nMnemosyne to scale interactive inference to context lengths at least up to 10\nmillion tokens with high throughput enabled with batching.

In this paper, through trace-based experiments, we found\nthat the existing method for long sequences results in a high\nTime-To-First-Token (TTFT) due to sequential chunk processing, long\nTime-Between-Tokens (TBT) from batching long-sequence prefills and decodes, and\nlow throughput due to constrained key-value cache (KVC) for long sequences. To\naddress these issues, we propose two Sequence-Parallelism (SP) architectures\nfor both tensor parallelism (TP) and non-TP. However, SP introduces two\nchallenges: 1) network communication and computation become performance\nbottlenecks; 2) the latter two issues above are mitigated but not resolved, and\nSP's resultant KV value distribution across GPUs still requires communication\nfor decode, increasing TBT. Hence, we propose a Communication-efficient Sparse\nAttention (CSA) and communication-computation-communication three-phase\npipelining. We also propose SP-based decode that processes decode separately\nfrom prefill, distributes KV values of a request across different GPUs, and\nnovelly moves Query (Q) values instead of KV values to reduce communication\noverhead. These methods constitute a communication-efficient\nSequence-Parallelism based LLM Serving System (SPS2). Our trace-driven\nevaluation demonstrates that SPS2 improves the average TTFT, TBT, and response\ntime by up to 7.5x, 1.92x, and 9.8x and improves the prefill and decode\nthroughput by 8.2x and 5.2x while maintaining the accuracy compared to\nSarathi-Serve. We distributed our source code.",

Here, we\ninvestigate how aligning vision model representations to human perceptual\njudgments impacts their usability across diverse computer vision tasks. We\nfinetune state-of-the-art models on human similarity judgments for image\ntriplets and evaluate them across standard vision benchmarks. We find that\naligning models to perceptual judgments yields representations that improve\nupon the original backbones across many downstream tasks, including counting,\nsegmentation, depth estimation, instance retrieval, and retrieval-augmented\ngeneration. In addition, we find that performance is widely preserved on other\ntasks, including specialized out-of-distribution domains such as in medical\nimaging and 3D environment frames. Our results suggest that injecting an\ninductive bias about human perceptual knowledge into vision models can\ncontribute to better representations.",

Caching all Key and Value (KV)\nstates across all attention heads consumes substantial memory. Existing KV\ncache pruning methods either damage the long-context capabilities of LLMs or\noffer only limited efficiency improvements. In this paper, we identify that\nonly a fraction of attention heads, a.k.a, Retrieval Heads, are critical for\nprocessing long contexts and require full attention across all tokens. In\ncontrast, all other heads, which primarily focus on recent tokens and attention\nsinks--referred to as Streaming Heads--do not require full attention. Based on\nthis insight, we introduce DuoAttention, a framework that only applies a full\nKV cache to retrieval heads while using a light-weight, constant-length KV\ncache for streaming heads, which reduces both LLM's decoding and pre-filling\nmemory and latency without compromising its long-context abilities.\nDuoAttention uses a lightweight, optimization-based algorithm with synthetic\ndata to identify retrieval heads accurately. Our method significantly reduces\nlong-context inference memory by up to 2.55x for MHA and 1.67x for GQA models\nwhile speeding up decoding by up to 2.18x and 1.50x and accelerating\npre-filling by up to 1.73x and 1.63x for MHA and GQA models, respectively, with\nminimal accuracy loss compared to full attention. Notably, combined with\nquantization, DuoAttention enables Llama-3-8B decoding with 3.3 million context\nlength on a single A100 GPU.

                "summary": "Large language models are instruction-finetuned to enhance their ability to\nfollow user instructions and process the input context. However, even\nstate-of-the-art models often struggle to follow the instruction, especially\nwhen the input context is not aligned with the model's parametric knowledge.\nThis manifests as various failures, such as hallucinations where the responses\nare outdated, biased or contain unverified facts. In this work, we try to\nunderstand the underlying reason for this poor context reliance, especially\nafter instruction tuning. We observe an intriguing phenomenon: during\ninstruction tuning, the context reliance initially increases as expected, but\nthen gradually decreases as instruction finetuning progresses. We call this\nphenomenon context-parametric inversion and observe it across multiple general\npurpose instruction tuning datasets like TULU, Alpaca and Ultrachat, as well as\nmodel families such as Llama, Mistral and Pythia. In a simple theoretical\nsetup, we isolate why context-parametric inversion occurs along the gradient\ndescent trajectory of instruction finetuning.

                    "value": "Large language models are instruction-finetuned to enhance their ability to\nfollow user instructions and process the input context. However, even\nstate-of-the-art models often struggle to follow the instruction, especially\nwhen the input context is not aligned with the model's parametric knowledge.\nThis manifests as various failures, such as hallucinations where the responses\nare outdated, biased or contain unverified facts. In this work, we try to\nunderstand the underlying reason for this poor context reliance, especially\nafter instruction tuning. We observe an intriguing phenomenon: during\ninstruction tuning, the context reliance initially increases as expected, but\nthen gradually decreases as instruction finetuning progresses. We call this\nphenomenon context-parametric inversion and observe it across multiple general\npurpose instruction tuning datasets like TULU, Alpaca and Ultrachat, as well as\nmodel families such as Llama, Mistral and Pythia. In a simple theoretical\nsetup, we isolate why context-parametric inversion occurs along the gradient\ndescent trajectory of instruction finetuning. We tie this phenomena to examples\nin the instruction finetuning data mixture where the input context provides\ninformation that is already present in the model's parametric knowledge. Our\nanalysis suggests natural mitigation strategies that provide some limited\ngains, while also validating our theoretical insights. We hope that our work\nserves as a starting point in addressing this failure mode in a staple part of\nLLM training."

However,\nconstructing these workflows requires significant human effort, limiting\nscalability and generalizability. Recent research has sought to automate the\ngeneration and optimization of these workflows, but existing methods still rely\non initial manual setup and fall short of achieving fully automated and\neffective workflow generation. To address this challenge, we reformulate\nworkflow optimization as a search problem over code-represented workflows,\nwhere LLM-invoking nodes are connected by edges. We introduce AFlow, an\nautomated framework that efficiently explores this space using Monte Carlo Tree\nSearch, iteratively refining workflows through code modification,\ntree-structured experience, and execution feedback. Empirical evaluations\nacross six benchmark datasets demonstrate AFlow's efficacy, yielding a 5.7%\naverage improvement over state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, AFlow enables\nsmaller models to outperform GPT-4o on specific tasks at 4.55% of its inference\ncost in dollars. The code will be available at\nhttps://github.com/geekan/MetaGPT.",

                "summary": "The conventional paradigm of using large language models (LLMs) for\nevaluating natural language generation (NLG) systems typically relies on two\nkey inputs: (1) a clear definition of the NLG task to be evaluated and (2) a\nlist of pre-defined evaluation criteria. This process treats LLMs as ''passive\ncritics,'' strictly following human-defined criteria for evaluation. However,\nas new NLG tasks emerge, the criteria for assessing text quality can vary\ngreatly. Consequently, these rigid evaluation methods struggle to adapt to\ndiverse NLG tasks without extensive prompt engineering customized for each\nspecific task. To address this limitation, we introduce Active-Critic, a novel\nLLM-based NLG evaluation protocol that enables LLMs to function as ''active\ncritics.'' Specifically, our protocol comprises two key stages. In the first\nstage, the LLM is instructed to infer the target NLG task and establish\nrelevant evaluation criteria from the data. Building on this self-inferred\ninformation, the second stage dynamically optimizes the prompt to guide the LLM\ntoward more human-aligned scoring decisions, while also generating detailed\nexplanations to justify its evaluations. Experiments across four NLG evaluation\ntasks show that our approach achieves stronger alignment with human judgments\nthan state-of-the-art evaluation methods. Our comprehensive analysis further\nhighlights the effectiveness and explainability of Active-Critic with only a\nsmall amount of labeled data. We will share our code and data on GitHub.",

                    "value": "The conventional paradigm of using large language models (LLMs) for\nevaluating natural language generation (NLG) systems typically relies on two\nkey inputs: (1) a clear definition of the NLG task to be evaluated and (2) a\nlist of pre-defined evaluation criteria. This process treats LLMs as ''passive\ncritics,'' strictly following human-defined criteria for evaluation. However,\nas new NLG tasks emerge, the criteria for assessing text quality can vary\ngreatly. Consequently, these rigid evaluation methods struggle to adapt to\ndiverse NLG tasks without extensive prompt engineering customized for each\nspecific task. To address this limitation, we introduce Active-Critic, a novel\nLLM-based NLG evaluation protocol that enables LLMs to function as ''active\ncritics.'' Specifically, our protocol comprises two key stages. In the first\nstage, the LLM is instructed to infer the target NLG task and establish\nrelevant evaluation criteria from the data. Building on this self-inferred\ninformation, the second stage dynamically optimizes the prompt to guide the LLM\ntoward more human-aligned scoring decisions, while also generating detailed\nexplanations to justify its evaluations. Experiments across four NLG evaluation\ntasks show that our approach achieves stronger alignment with human judgments\nthan state-of-the-art evaluation methods. Our comprehensive analysis further\nhighlights the effectiveness and explainability of Active-Critic with only a\nsmall amount of labeled data. We will share our code and data on GitHub."

We introduce ActorAttack, a novel multi-turn attack\nmethod inspired by actor-network theory, which models a network of semantically\nlinked actors as attack clues to generate diverse and effective attack paths\ntoward harmful targets. ActorAttack addresses two main challenges in multi-turn\nattacks: (1) concealing harmful intents by creating an innocuous conversation\ntopic about the actor, and (2) uncovering diverse attack paths towards the same\nharmful target by leveraging LLMs' knowledge to specify the correlated actors\nas various attack clues. In this way, ActorAttack outperforms existing\nsingle-turn and multi-turn attack methods across advanced aligned LLMs, even\nfor GPT-o1. We will publish a dataset called SafeMTData, which includes\nmulti-turn adversarial prompts and safety alignment data, generated by\nActorAttack.

We envision experimenters switching off the couplings between two\nparts of the system and preparing them in independent equilibrium states. One\nside of the chain settles into a symmetry-breaking ground state. When the\ncouplings are switched back on, time evolution ensues. We argue that in\nintegrable systems the front separating the ordered region recedes at the\nmaximal velocity of quasiparticle excitations over the ground state. We infer\nthat, generically, the order parameters should vary on a subdiffusive scale of\norder $t^{1/3}$, where $t$ is time, and their fluctuations should exhibit the\nsame scaling. Thus, the interfacial region exhibits full range correlations,\nindicating that it cannot be decomposed into nearly uncorrelated subsystems.\nUsing the transverse-field Ising chain as a case study, we demonstrate that all\norder parameters follow the same universal scaling functions. Through an\nanalysis of the skew information, we uncover that the breakdown of cluster\ndecomposition has a quantum contribution: each subsystem within the interfacial\nregion, with extent comparable to the region, exists in a macroscopic quantum\nstate.",

                    "value": "We consider translationally invariant quantum spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ chains with\nlocal interactions and a discrete symmetry that is spontaneously broken at zero\ntemperature. We envision experimenters switching off the couplings between two\nparts of the system and preparing them in independent equilibrium states. One\nside of the chain settles into a symmetry-breaking ground state. When the\ncouplings are switched back on, time evolution ensues. We argue that in\nintegrable systems the front separating the ordered region recedes at the\nmaximal velocity of quasiparticle excitations over the ground state. We infer\nthat, generically, the order parameters should vary on a subdiffusive scale of\norder $t^{1/3}$, where $t$ is time, and their fluctuations should exhibit the\nsame scaling. Thus, the interfacial region exhibits full range correlations,\nindicating that it cannot be decomposed into nearly uncorrelated subsystems.\nUsing the transverse-field Ising chain as a case study, we demonstrate that all\norder parameters follow the same universal scaling functions. Through an\nanalysis of the skew information, we uncover that the breakdown of cluster\ndecomposition has a quantum contribution: each subsystem within the interfacial\nregion, with extent comparable to the region, exists in a macroscopic quantum\nstate."

Instead\nof estimating a high-dimensional model at each time and inferring changes\nlater, we directly learn the differential parameter, i.e., the time derivative\nof the parameter. The main idea is treating the time score function of an\nexponential family model as a linear model of the differential parameter for\ndirect estimation. We use time score matching to estimate parameter\nderivatives. We prove the consistency of a regularized score matching objective\nand demonstrate the finite-sample normality of a debiased estimator in\nhigh-dimensional settings. Our methodology effectively infers differential\nstructures in high-dimensional graphical models, verified on simulated and\nreal-world datasets.",

Instead\nof estimating a high-dimensional model at each time and inferring changes\nlater, we directly learn the differential parameter, i.e., the time derivative\nof the parameter. The main idea is treating the time score function of an\nexponential family model as a linear model of the differential parameter for\ndirect estimation. We use time score matching to estimate parameter\nderivatives. We prove the consistency of a regularized score matching objective\nand demonstrate the finite-sample normality of a debiased estimator in\nhigh-dimensional settings. Our methodology effectively infers differential\nstructures in high-dimensional graphical models, verified on simulated and\nreal-world datasets."

(2) Linear DiT: we replace all vanilla attention in\nDiT with linear attention, which is more efficient at high resolutions without\nsacrificing quality. (3) Decoder-only text encoder: we replaced T5 with modern\ndecoder-only small LLM as the text encoder and designed complex human\ninstruction with in-context learning to enhance the image-text alignment. (4)\nEfficient training and sampling: we propose Flow-DPM-Solver to reduce sampling\nsteps, with efficient caption labeling and selection to accelerate convergence.\nAs a result, Sana-0.6B is very competitive with modern giant diffusion model\n(e.g. Flux-12B), being 20 times smaller and 100+ times faster in measured\nthroughput.

In this\nstudy, we explore the diffusion of test smells in LLM generated unit test\nsuites and compare them to those found in human written ones. We analyze a\nbenchmark of 20,500 LLM-generated test suites produced by four models (GPT-3.5,\nGPT-4, Mistral 7B, and Mixtral 8x7B) across five prompt engineering techniques,\nalongside a dataset of 780,144 human written test suites from 34,637 projects.\nLeveraging TsDetect, a state of the art tool capable of detecting 21 different\ntypes of test smells, we identify and analyze the prevalence and co-occurrence\nof various test smells in both human written and LLM-generated test suites. Our\nfindings reveal new insights into the strengths and limitations of LLMs in test\ngeneration. First, regarding prevalence, we observe that LLMs frequently\ngenerate tests with common test smells, such as Magic Number Test and Assertion\nRoulette. Second, in terms of co occurrence, certain smells, like Long Test and\nUseless Test, tend to co occur in LLM-generated suites, influenced by specific\nprompt techniques. Third, we find that project complexity and LLM specific\nfactors, including model size and context length, significantly affect the\nprevalence of test smells. Finally, the patterns of test smells in\nLLM-generated tests often mirror those in human-written tests, suggesting\npotential data leakage from training datasets.

In this paper, we\nintroduce VisRAG, which tackles this issue by establishing a vision-language\nmodel (VLM)-based RAG pipeline. In this pipeline, instead of first parsing the\ndocument to obtain text, the document is directly embedded using a VLM as an\nimage and then retrieved to enhance the generation of a VLM. Compared to\ntraditional text-based RAG, VisRAG maximizes the retention and utilization of\nthe data information in the original documents, eliminating the information\nloss introduced during the parsing process. We collect both open-source and\nsynthetic data to train the retriever in VisRAG and explore a variety of\ngeneration methods. Experiments demonstrate that VisRAG outperforms traditional\nRAG in both the retrieval and generation stages, achieving a 25--39\\%\nend-to-end performance gain over traditional text-based RAG pipeline. Further\nanalysis reveals that VisRAG is effective in utilizing training data and\ndemonstrates strong generalization capability, positioning it as a promising\nsolution for RAG on multi-modality documents.

In this pipeline, instead of first parsing the\ndocument to obtain text, the document is directly embedded using a VLM as an\nimage and then retrieved to enhance the generation of a VLM. Compared to\ntraditional text-based RAG, VisRAG maximizes the retention and utilization of\nthe data information in the original documents, eliminating the information\nloss introduced during the parsing process. We collect both open-source and\nsynthetic data to train the retriever in VisRAG and explore a variety of\ngeneration methods. Experiments demonstrate that VisRAG outperforms traditional\nRAG in both the retrieval and generation stages, achieving a 25--39\\%\nend-to-end performance gain over traditional text-based RAG pipeline. Further\nanalysis reveals that VisRAG is effective in utilizing training data and\ndemonstrates strong generalization capability, positioning it as a promising\nsolution for RAG on multi-modality documents.

We\nconduct extensive experiments on natural language understanding (NLU) and\nnatural language generation (NLG) tasks using prominent LLMs such as LLaMA,\nMistral, and Gemma. The results demonstrate that BA-LoRA outperforms LoRA and\nits state-of-the-art variants. Moreover, our method effectively mitigates the\nadverse effects of pre-training bias, leading to more reliable and robust model\noutputs.

To\ntackle this problem, we propose a novel multi-agent collaborative data\nselection mechanism. In this framework, each data selection method serves as an\nindependent agent, and an agent console is designed to dynamically integrate\nthe information from all agents throughout the LLM training process. We conduct\nextensive empirical studies to evaluate our multi-agent framework. The\nexperimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves data\nefficiency, accelerates convergence in LLM training, and achieves an average\nperformance gain up to 10.5% across multiple language model benchmarks compared\nto the state-of-the-art methods.",

This approach mimics real-world\nconditions, where decisions must be made without the benefit of hindsight,\nunlike retrospective analyses often found in previous studies. For transformer\nmodels, we experiment with hierarchical transformers and the summarization of\njudgment facts to optimize input for these models. Our experiments with LLMs\nreveal that GPT-3.5 Turbo excels in realistic scenarios, demonstrating robust\nperformance in judgment prediction. Furthermore, incorporating additional legal\ninformation, such as statutes and precedents, significantly improves the\noutcome of the prediction task. The LLMs also provide explanations for their\npredictions. To evaluate the quality of these predictions and explanations, we\nintroduce two human evaluation metrics: Clarity and Linking.

The emergence of foundation\nmodels as the \"brain\" of EAI agents for high-level task planning has shown\npromising results.

For instance, a\nhousekeeping robot lacking sufficient risk awareness might place a metal\ncontainer in a microwave, potentially causing a fire. To address these critical\nsafety concerns, comprehensive pre-deployment risk assessments are imperative.\nThis study introduces EAIRiskBench, a novel framework for automated physical\nrisk assessment in EAI scenarios. EAIRiskBench employs a multi-agent\ncooperative system that leverages various foundation models to generate safety\nguidelines, create risk-prone scenarios, make task planning, and evaluate\nsafety systematically. Utilizing this framework, we construct EAIRiskDataset,\ncomprising diverse test cases across various domains, encompassing both textual\nand visual scenarios. Our comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art\nfoundation models reveals alarming results: all models exhibit high task risk\nrates (TRR), with an average of 95.75% across all evaluated models. To address\nthese challenges, we further propose two prompting-based risk mitigation\nstrategies. While these strategies demonstrate some efficacy in reducing TRR,\nthe improvements are limited, still indicating substantial safety concerns.\nThis study provides the first large-scale assessment of physical risk awareness\nin EAI agents.

To\naccommodate SAR, we develop a straightforward architecture termed Fully Masked\nTransformer. We reveal that existing AR variants correspond to specific design\nchoices of sequence order and output intervals within the SAR framework, with\nAR and Masked AR (MAR) as two extreme instances. Notably, SAR facilitates a\nseamless transition from AR to MAR, where intermediate states allow for\ntraining a causal model that benefits from both few-step inference and KV cache\nacceleration, thus leveraging the advantages of both AR and MAR. On the\nImageNet benchmark, we carefully explore the properties of SAR by analyzing the\nimpact of sequence order and output intervals on performance, as well as the\ngeneralization ability regarding inference order and steps. We further validate\nthe potential of SAR by training a 900M text-to-image model capable of\nsynthesizing photo-realistic images with any resolution.

Does this contradict their\nclaim of generalists? To answer the question, we take a closer look at\nMixture-of-Experts (MoE) LLMs. Our study shows that the expert routers in MoE\nLLMs can serve as an off-the-shelf embedding model with promising performance\non a diverse class of embedding-focused tasks, without requiring any\nfinetuning. Moreover, our extensive analysis shows that the MoE routing weights\n(RW) is complementary to the hidden state (HS) of LLMs, a widely-used\nembedding. Compared to HS, we find that RW is more robust to the choice of\nprompts and focuses on high-level semantics. Motivated by the analysis, we\npropose MoEE combining RW and HS, which achieves better performance than using\neither separately. Our exploration of their combination and prompting strategy\nshed several novel insights, e.g., a weighted sum of RW and HS similarities\noutperforms the similarity on their concatenation. Our experiments are\nconducted on 6 embedding tasks with 20 datasets from the Massive Text Embedding\nBenchmark (MTEB).

Does this contradict their\nclaim of generalists? To answer the question, we take a closer look at\nMixture-of-Experts (MoE) LLMs. Our study shows that the expert routers in MoE\nLLMs can serve as an off-the-shelf embedding model with promising performance\non a diverse class of embedding-focused tasks, without requiring any\nfinetuning. Moreover, our extensive analysis shows that the MoE routing weights\n(RW) is complementary to the hidden state (HS) of LLMs, a widely-used\nembedding. Compared to HS, we find that RW is more robust to the choice of\nprompts and focuses on high-level semantics. Motivated by the analysis, we\npropose MoEE combining RW and HS, which achieves better performance than using\neither separately. Our exploration of their combination and prompting strategy\nshed several novel insights, e.g., a weighted sum of RW and HS similarities\noutperforms the similarity on their concatenation. Our experiments are\nconducted on 6 embedding tasks with 20 datasets from the Massive Text Embedding\nBenchmark (MTEB). The results demonstrate the significant improvement brought\nby MoEE to LLM-based embedding without further finetuning."

In this work, we try to\nunderstand the underlying reason for this poor context reliance, especially\nafter instruction tuning. We observe an intriguing phenomenon: during\ninstruction tuning, the context reliance initially increases as expected, but\nthen gradually decreases as instruction finetuning progresses. We call this\nphenomenon context-parametric inversion and observe it across multiple general\npurpose instruction tuning datasets like TULU, Alpaca and Ultrachat, as well as\nmodel families such as Llama, Mistral and Pythia. In a simple theoretical\nsetup, we isolate why context-parametric inversion occurs along the gradient\ndescent trajectory of instruction finetuning. We tie this phenomena to examples\nin the instruction finetuning data mixture where the input context provides\ninformation that is already present in the model's parametric knowledge. Our\nanalysis suggests natural mitigation strategies that provide some limited\ngains, while also validating our theoretical insights.

However, LLMs\noften encounter difficulties in certain aspects of mathematical reasoning,\nleading to flawed reasoning and erroneous results. To mitigate these issues, we\nintroduce a novel mechanism, the Chain of Self-Correction (CoSC), specifically\ndesigned to embed self-correction as an inherent ability in LLMs, enabling them\nto validate and rectify their own results. The CoSC mechanism operates through\na sequence of self-correction stages. In each stage, the LLMs generate a\nprogram to address a given problem, execute this program using program-based\ntools to obtain an output, subsequently verify this output. Based on the\nverification, the LLMs either proceed to the next correction stage or finalize\nthe answer. This iterative self-correction process allows the LLMs to refine\ntheir reasoning steps and improve the accuracy of their mathematical reasoning.\nTo enable the CoSC mechanism at a low cost, we employ a two-phase finetuning\napproach. In the first phase, the LLMs are trained with a relatively small\nvolume of seeding data generated from GPT-4, establishing an initial CoSC\ncapability. In the second phase, the CoSC capability is further enhanced by\ntraining with a larger volume of self-generated data using the trained model in\nthe first phase, without relying on the paid GPT-4. Our comprehensive\nexperiments demonstrate that CoSC significantly improves performance on\ntraditional mathematical datasets among existing open-source LLMs. Notably, our\nCoSC-Code-34B model achieved a 53.5% score on MATH, the most challenging\nmathematical reasoning dataset in the public domain, surpassing the performance\nof well-established models such as ChatGPT, GPT-4, and even multi-modal LLMs\nlike GPT-4V, Gemini-1.0 Pro, and Gemini-1.0 Ultra.",

In the first phase, the LLMs are trained with a relatively small\nvolume of seeding data generated from GPT-4, establishing an initial CoSC\ncapability. In the second phase, the CoSC capability is further enhanced by\ntraining with a larger volume of self-generated data using the trained model in\nthe first phase, without relying on the paid GPT-4. Our comprehensive\nexperiments demonstrate that CoSC significantly improves performance on\ntraditional mathematical datasets among existing open-source LLMs. Notably, our\nCoSC-Code-34B model achieved a 53.5% score on MATH, the most challenging\nmathematical reasoning dataset in the public domain, surpassing the performance\nof well-established models such as ChatGPT, GPT-4, and even multi-modal LLMs\nlike GPT-4V, Gemini-1.0 Pro, and Gemini-1.0 Ultra."

ActorAttack addresses two main challenges in multi-turn\nattacks: (1) concealing harmful intents by creating an innocuous conversation\ntopic about the actor, and (2) uncovering diverse attack paths towards the same\nharmful target by leveraging LLMs' knowledge to specify the correlated actors\nas various attack clues. In this way, ActorAttack outperforms existing\nsingle-turn and multi-turn attack methods across advanced aligned LLMs, even\nfor GPT-o1. We will publish a dataset called SafeMTData, which includes\nmulti-turn adversarial prompts and safety alignment data, generated by\nActorAttack.

While traditional metrics like Matrix Entropy offer valuable\ninsights, they are computationally intensive for large-scale models due to\ntheir \\( O(n^3) \\) time complexity with Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). To\nmitigate this issue, we introduce the Matrix Nuclear-Norm, which not only\nserves as a metric to quantify the data compression proficiency of LLM but also\nprovides a convex approximation of matrix rank to capture both predictive\ndiscriminability and diversity. By employing the \\( L_{1,2}\\text{-norm} \\) to\nfurther approximate the nuclear norm, we can effectively assess the model's\ninformation compression capabilities. This approach reduces the time complexity\nto \\( O(n^2) \\) and eliminates the need for SVD computation. Consequently, the\nMatrix Nuclear-Norm achieves speeds 8 to 24 times faster than Matrix Entropy\nfor the CEREBRAS-GPT model as sizes increase from 111M to 6.7B. This\nperformance gap becomes more pronounced with larger models, as validated in\ntests with other models like Pythia. Additionally, evaluations on benchmarks\nand model responses confirm that our proposed Matrix Nuclear-Norm is a\nreliable, scalable, and efficient tool for assessing LLMs' performance,\nstriking a balance between accuracy and computational efficiency.

While traditional metrics like Matrix Entropy offer valuable\ninsights, they are computationally intensive for large-scale models due to\ntheir \\( O(n^3) \\) time complexity with Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). To\nmitigate this issue, we introduce the Matrix Nuclear-Norm, which not only\nserves as a metric to quantify the data compression proficiency of LLM but also\nprovides a convex approximation of matrix rank to capture both predictive\ndiscriminability and diversity. By employing the \\( L_{1,2}\\text{-norm} \\) to\nfurther approximate the nuclear norm, we can effectively assess the model's\ninformation compression capabilities. This approach reduces the time complexity\nto \\( O(n^2) \\) and eliminates the need for SVD computation. Consequently, the\nMatrix Nuclear-Norm achieves speeds 8 to 24 times faster than Matrix Entropy\nfor the CEREBRAS-GPT model as sizes increase from 111M to 6.7B. This\nperformance gap becomes more pronounced with larger models, as validated in\ntests with other models like Pythia. Additionally, evaluations on benchmarks\nand model responses confirm that our proposed Matrix Nuclear-Norm is a\nreliable, scalable, and efficient tool for assessing LLMs' performance,\nstriking a balance between accuracy and computational efficiency. The code is\navailable at https://github.com/MLGroupJLU/MatrixNuclearNorm."

Sana can synthesize high-resolution,\nhigh-quality images with strong text-image alignment at a remarkably fast\nspeed, deployable on laptop GPU. Core designs include: (1) Deep compression\nautoencoder: unlike traditional AEs, which compress images only 8$\\times$, we\ntrained an AE that can compress images 32$\\times$, effectively reducing the\nnumber of latent tokens. (2) Linear DiT: we replace all vanilla attention in\nDiT with linear attention, which is more efficient at high resolutions without\nsacrificing quality. (3) Decoder-only text encoder: we replaced T5 with modern\ndecoder-only small LLM as the text encoder and designed complex human\ninstruction with in-context learning to enhance the image-text alignment. (4)\nEfficient training and sampling: we propose Flow-DPM-Solver to reduce sampling\nsteps, with efficient caption labeling and selection to accelerate convergence.\nAs a result, Sana-0.6B is very competitive with modern giant diffusion model\n(e.g. Flux-12B), being 20 times smaller and 100+ times faster in measured\nthroughput. Moreover, Sana-0.6B can be deployed on a 16GB laptop GPU, taking\nless than 1 second to generate a 1024$\\times$1024 resolution image. Sana\nenables content creation at low cost.

However, current RAG systems are solely based on text, rendering it\nimpossible to utilize vision information like layout and images that play\ncrucial roles in real-world multi-modality documents. In this paper, we\nintroduce VisRAG, which tackles this issue by establishing a vision-language\nmodel (VLM)-based RAG pipeline. In this pipeline, instead of first parsing the\ndocument to obtain text, the document is directly embedded using a VLM as an\nimage and then retrieved to enhance the generation of a VLM. Compared to\ntraditional text-based RAG, VisRAG maximizes the retention and utilization of\nthe data information in the original documents, eliminating the information\nloss introduced during the parsing process. We collect both open-source and\nsynthetic data to train the retriever in VisRAG and explore a variety of\ngeneration methods.

                    "value": "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is an effective technique that enables\nlarge language models (LLMs) to utilize external knowledge sources for\ngeneration. However, current RAG systems are solely based on text, rendering it\nimpossible to utilize vision information like layout and images that play\ncrucial roles in real-world multi-modality documents. In this paper, we\nintroduce VisRAG, which tackles this issue by establishing a vision-language\nmodel (VLM)-based RAG pipeline. In this pipeline, instead of first parsing the\ndocument to obtain text, the document is directly embedded using a VLM as an\nimage and then retrieved to enhance the generation of a VLM.

In this realistic scenario, we simulate how judgments are\npredicted at the point when a case is presented for a decision in court, using\nonly the information available at that time, such as the facts of the case,\nstatutes, precedents, and arguments. This approach mimics real-world\nconditions, where decisions must be made without the benefit of hindsight,\nunlike retrospective analyses often found in previous studies. For transformer\nmodels, we experiment with hierarchical transformers and the summarization of\njudgment facts to optimize input for these models. Our experiments with LLMs\nreveal that GPT-3.5 Turbo excels in realistic scenarios, demonstrating robust\nperformance in judgment prediction. Furthermore, incorporating additional legal\ninformation, such as statutes and precedents, significantly improves the\noutcome of the prediction task. The LLMs also provide explanations for their\npredictions. To evaluate the quality of these predictions and explanations, we\nintroduce two human evaluation metrics: Clarity and Linking. Our findings from\nboth automatic and human evaluations indicate that, despite advancements in\nLLMs, they are yet to achieve expert-level performance in judgment prediction\nand explanation tasks.",

                    "value": "This study investigates judgment prediction in a realistic scenario within\nthe context of Indian judgments, utilizing a range of transformer-based models,\nincluding InLegalBERT, BERT, and XLNet, alongside LLMs such as Llama-2 and\nGPT-3.5 Turbo. In this realistic scenario, we simulate how judgments are\npredicted at the point when a case is presented for a decision in court, using\nonly the information available at that time, such as the facts of the case,\nstatutes, precedents, and arguments. This approach mimics real-world\nconditions, where decisions must be made without the benefit of hindsight,\nunlike retrospective analyses often found in previous studies. For transformer\nmodels, we experiment with hierarchical transformers and the summarization of\njudgment facts to optimize input for these models. Our experiments with LLMs\nreveal that GPT-3.5 Turbo excels in realistic scenarios, demonstrating robust\nperformance in judgment prediction. Furthermore, incorporating additional legal\ninformation, such as statutes and precedents, significantly improves the\noutcome of the prediction task. The LLMs also provide explanations for their\npredictions. To evaluate the quality of these predictions and explanations, we\nintroduce two human evaluation metrics: Clarity and Linking. Our findings from\nboth automatic and human evaluations indicate that, despite advancements in\nLLMs, they are yet to achieve expert-level performance in judgment prediction\nand explanation tasks."

While this approach was demonstrated to work well\nwhen optimized and evaluated for each individual benchmark, in practice it is\ncrucial for the next generation of real-world AI systems to handle a broad\nrange of multimodal problems. Therefore we pose the VQA problem from a unified\nperspective and evaluate a single system on a varied suite of VQA tasks\nincluding counting, spatial reasoning, OCR-based reasoning, visual pointing,\nexternal knowledge, and more. In this setting, we demonstrate that naively\napplying the LLM+tools approach using the combined set of all tools leads to\npoor results. This motivates us to introduce HAMMR: HierArchical MultiModal\nReact. We start from a multimodal ReAct-based system and make it hierarchical\nby enabling our HAMMR agents to call upon other specialized agents. This\nenhances the compositionality of the LLM+tools approach, which we show to be\ncritical for obtaining high accuracy on generic VQA.

                    "value": "Combining Large Language Models (LLMs) with external specialized tools\n(LLMs+tools) is a recent paradigm to solve multimodal tasks such as Visual\nQuestion Answering (VQA). While this approach was demonstrated to work well\nwhen optimized and evaluated for each individual benchmark, in practice it is\ncrucial for the next generation of real-world AI systems to handle a broad\nrange of multimodal problems. Therefore we pose the VQA problem from a unified\nperspective and evaluate a single system on a varied suite of VQA tasks\nincluding counting, spatial reasoning, OCR-based reasoning, visual pointing,\nexternal knowledge, and more. In this setting, we demonstrate that naively\napplying the LLM+tools approach using the combined set of all tools leads to\npoor results. This motivates us to introduce HAMMR: HierArchical MultiModal\nReact. We start from a multimodal ReAct-based system and make it hierarchical\nby enabling our HAMMR agents to call upon other specialized agents. This\nenhances the compositionality of the LLM+tools approach, which we show to be\ncritical for obtaining high accuracy on generic VQA. Concretely, on our generic\nVQA suite, HAMMR outperforms the naive LLM+tools approach by 19.5%.\nAdditionally, HAMMR achieves state-of-the-art results on this task,\noutperforming the generic standalone PaLI-X VQA model by 5.0%."

                "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) pose significant risks due to the potential for\ngenerating harmful content or users attempting to evade guardrails. Existing\nstudies have developed LLM-based guard models designed to moderate the input\nand output of threat LLMs, ensuring adherence to safety policies by blocking\ncontent that violates these protocols upon deployment. However, limited\nattention has been given to the reliability and calibration of such guard\nmodels. In this work, we empirically conduct comprehensive investigations of\nconfidence calibration for 9 existing LLM-based guard models on 12 benchmarks\nin both user input and model output classification. Our findings reveal that\ncurrent LLM-based guard models tend to 1) produce overconfident predictions, 2)\nexhibit significant miscalibration when subjected to jailbreak attacks, and 3)\ndemonstrate limited robustness to the outputs generated by different types of\nresponse models.

                    "value": "Large language models (LLMs) pose significant risks due to the potential for\ngenerating harmful content or users attempting to evade guardrails. Existing\nstudies have developed LLM-based guard models designed to moderate the input\nand output of threat LLMs, ensuring adherence to safety policies by blocking\ncontent that violates these protocols upon deployment. However, limited\nattention has been given to the reliability and calibration of such guard\nmodels. In this work, we empirically conduct comprehensive investigations of\nconfidence calibration for 9 existing LLM-based guard models on 12 benchmarks\nin both user input and model output classification. Our findings reveal that\ncurrent LLM-based guard models tend to 1) produce overconfident predictions, 2)\nexhibit significant miscalibration when subjected to jailbreak attacks, and 3)\ndemonstrate limited robustness to the outputs generated by different types of\nresponse models. Additionally, we assess the effectiveness of post-hoc\ncalibration methods to mitigate miscalibration. We demonstrate the efficacy of\ntemperature scaling and, for the first time, highlight the benefits of\ncontextual calibration for confidence calibration of guard models, particularly\nin the absence of validation sets.

(3) Data: we utilize formatted existing\ndatasets, exam datasets and newly annotated datasets by legal experts to\ncomprehensively evaluate the various capabilities of LLMs. LexEval not only\nfocuses on the ability of LLMs to apply fundamental legal knowledge but also\ndedicates efforts to examining the ethical issues involved in their\napplication. We evaluated 38 open-source and commercial LLMs and obtained some\ninteresting findings. The experiments and findings offer valuable insights into\nthe challenges and potential solutions for developing Chinese legal systems and\nLLM evaluation pipelines.

Extensive research has highlighted the\nquality of instruction data is essential for the success of this alignment.\nHowever, creating high-quality data manually is labor-intensive and\ntime-consuming, which leads researchers to explore using LLMs to synthesize\ndata. Recent studies have focused on using a stronger LLM to iteratively\nenhance existing instruction data, showing promising results.

With tree search and\nevaluation models, it can efficiently guide each instruction to evolve into a\nhigh-quality form, aiding in instruction fine-tuning. Experimental results show\nthat IDEA-MCTS significantly enhances the seed instruction data, raising the\naverage evaluation scores of quality, diversity, and complexity from 2.19 to\n3.81.

These\nfindings deepen our understanding of the creative capabilities of LLMs and\nprovide ways to enhance LLMs' creative abilities for cross-domain innovative\napplications."

These queries require two information\nextraction steps: a latent one for resolving the first hop (\"the performer of\nImagine\") into the bridge entity (John Lennon), and another for resolving the\nsecond hop (\"the spouse of John Lennon\") into the target entity (Yoko Ono).\nUnderstanding how the latent step is computed internally is key to\nunderstanding the overall computation. By carefully analyzing the internal\ncomputations of transformer-based LLMs, we discover that the bridge entity is\nresolved in the early layers of the model. Then, only after this resolution,\nthe two-hop query is solved in the later layers. Because the second hop\ncommences in later layers, there could be cases where these layers no longer\nencode the necessary knowledge for correctly predicting the answer. Motivated\nby this, we propose a novel \"back-patching\" analysis method whereby a hidden\nrepresentation from a later layer is patched back to an earlier layer. We find\nthat in up to 66% of previously incorrect cases there exists a back-patch that\nresults in the correct generation of the answer, showing that the later layers\nindeed sometimes lack the needed functionality.
