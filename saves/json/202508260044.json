Existing cache-enhanced TTA methods rely on a low-entropy\ncriterion to select samples for prototype construction, assuming intra-class\ncompactness. However, low-entropy samples may be unreliable under distribution\nshifts, and the resulting prototypes may not ensure compact intra-class\ndistributions. This study identifies a positive correlation between\ncache-enhanced performance and intra-class compactness. Based on this\nobservation, we propose a Multi-Cache enhanced Prototype-based Test-Time\nAdaptation (MCP) featuring three caches: an entropy cache for initializing\nprototype representations with low-entropy samples, an align cache for\nintegrating visual and textual information to achieve compact intra-class\ndistributions, and a negative cache for prediction calibration using\nhigh-entropy samples. We further developed MCP++, a framework incorporating\ncross-modal prototype alignment and residual learning, introducing prototype\nresidual fine-tuning. Comparative and ablation experiments across 15 downstream\ntasks demonstrate that the proposed method and framework achieve\nstate-of-the-art generalization performance.

Existing static\ncaching strategies mitigate this issue only in the initial navigation phase by\npreloading entry points and multi-hop neighbors, but they fail in the second\nphase where query-dependent nodes must be dynamically accessed to achieve high\nrecall. We propose GoVector, an I/O-efficient caching strategy tailored for\ndisk-based graph indices. GoVector combines (1) a static cache that stores\nentry points and frequently accessed neighbors, and (2) a dynamic cache that\nadaptively captures nodes with high spatial locality during the second search\nphase. To further align storage layout with similarity-driven search patterns,\nGoVector reorders nodes on disk so that similar vectors are colocated on the\nsame or adjacent pages, thereby improving locality and reducing I/O overhead.\nExtensive experiments on multiple public datasets show that GoVector achieves\nsubstantial performance improvements. At 90% recall, it reduces I/O operations\nby 46% on average, increases query throughput by 1.73x, and lowers query\nlatency by 42% compared to state-of-the-art disk-based graph indexing systems.",

                "summary": "Symbolic regression encompasses a family of search algorithms that aim to\ndiscover the best fitting function for a set of data without requiring an a\npriori specification of the model structure. The most successful and commonly\nused technique for symbolic regression is Genetic Programming (GP), an\nevolutionary search method that evolves a population of mathematical\nexpressions through the mechanism of natural selection.

However, scaling these discoveries to industrial\nproduction remains a major bottleneck due to the synthesis gap -- the need to\ndevelop entirely new manufacturing processes. This challenge requires detailed\nengineering blueprints: PFDs for equipment layouts and material/energy flows,\nand PIDs for process plant operations. Current AI systems cannot yet reliably\ngenerate these critical engineering schematics, creating a fundamental obstacle\nto manufacturing scale-up of novel discoveries. We present a closed-loop,\nphysics-aware framework for automated generation of industrially viable PFDs\nand PIDs. The framework integrates three key components: (1) domain-specialized\nsmall language models (SLMs) trained for auto-generation of PFDs and PIDs, (2)\na hierarchical knowledge graph containing process flow and instrumentation\ndescriptions for 1,020+ chemicals for Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n(GRAG), and (3) an open-source chemical process simulator for modeling,\nsimulation, optimization, and analysis of novel chemical processes. The SLMs\nare trained through a multi-stage pipeline on synthetic datasets, with process\nsimulator-in-the-loop validation ensuring feasibility. To enhance computational\nefficiency, the framework implements structural pruning (width and depth)\nguided by importance heuristics to reduce language model size while preserving\naccuracy, followed by advanced inference optimizations including\nFlashAttention, Lookahead Decoding, PagedAttention with KV-cache quantization,\nand Test-Time Inference Scaling.

                    "value": "Recent advances in generative AI have accelerated the discovery of novel\nchemicals and materials. However, scaling these discoveries to industrial\nproduction remains a major bottleneck due to the synthesis gap -- the need to\ndevelop entirely new manufacturing processes. This challenge requires detailed\nengineering blueprints: PFDs for equipment layouts and material/energy flows,\nand PIDs for process plant operations. Current AI systems cannot yet reliably\ngenerate these critical engineering schematics, creating a fundamental obstacle\nto manufacturing scale-up of novel discoveries. We present a closed-loop,\nphysics-aware framework for automated generation of industrially viable PFDs\nand PIDs. The framework integrates three key components: (1) domain-specialized\nsmall language models (SLMs) trained for auto-generation of PFDs and PIDs, (2)\na hierarchical knowledge graph containing process flow and instrumentation\ndescriptions for 1,020+ chemicals for Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n(GRAG), and (3) an open-source chemical process simulator for modeling,\nsimulation, optimization, and analysis of novel chemical processes. The SLMs\nare trained through a multi-stage pipeline on synthetic datasets, with process\nsimulator-in-the-loop validation ensuring feasibility. To enhance computational\nefficiency, the framework implements structural pruning (width and depth)\nguided by importance heuristics to reduce language model size while preserving\naccuracy, followed by advanced inference optimizations including\nFlashAttention, Lookahead Decoding, PagedAttention with KV-cache quantization,\nand Test-Time Inference Scaling. Experimental results demonstrate that our\nframework generates simulator-validated process descriptions with high\nfidelity."

With a 25 MB cache, Cold-RL raises hit ratio from 0.1436 to 0.3538,\na 146 percent improvement over the best classical baseline; at 100 MB, from\n0.7530 to 0.8675, a 15 percent gain; and at 400 MB it matches classical methods\n(about 0.918). Inference adds less than 2 percent CPU overhead and keeps 95th\npercentile eviction latency within budget. To our knowledge, this is the first\nreinforcement learning eviction policy integrated into NGINX with strict SLOs."

To address this challenge, we propose a dynamic,\nquality-latency aware routing framework that orchestrates inference between a\nlightweight model on the mobile device and a powerful model on the edge server.\nOur framework employs two distinct cost models: for single-turn queries, it\nfuses a BERT-predicted semantic score with communication and computation\noverheads; for multi-turn dialogues, it further quantifies context-aware costs\narising from model switching and KV-cache management. While maintaining full\ninference quality, extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework cuts\naverage response latency by 5-15% and reduces large model invocations by 10-20%\nagainst competitive baselines on MMLU, GSM8K, and MT-Bench-101 benchmarks.",

As such, new algorithms are emerging that trade\nincreased computation for reduced memory operations. To that end, we present\nXQuant, which takes advantage of this trend, enabling an order-of-magnitude\nreduction in memory consumption through low-bit quantization with substantial\naccuracy benefits relative to state-of-the-art KV cache quantization methods.\nWe accomplish this by quantizing and caching the layer input activations X,\ninstead of using standard KV caching, and then rematerializing the Keys and\nValues on-the-fly during inference. This results in an immediate 2$\\times$\nmemory savings compared to KV caching. By applying XQuant, we achieve up to\n$\\sim 7.7\\times$ memory savings with $<0.1$ perplexity degradation compared to\nthe FP16 baseline. Furthermore, our approach leverages the fact that X values\nare similar across layers. Building on this observation, we introduce\nXQuant-CL, which exploits the cross-layer similarity in the X embeddings for\nextreme compression. Across different models, XQuant-CL attains up to\n10$\\times$ memory savings relative to the FP16 baseline with only 0.01\nperplexity degradation, and 12.5$\\times$ memory savings with only $0.1$\nperplexity degradation. XQuant exploits the rapidly increasing compute\ncapabilities of hardware platforms to eliminate the memory bottleneck, while\nsurpassing state-of-the-art KV cache quantization methods and achieving\nnear-FP16 accuracy across a wide range of models.",

To that end, we present\nXQuant, which takes advantage of this trend, enabling an order-of-magnitude\nreduction in memory consumption through low-bit quantization with substantial\naccuracy benefits relative to state-of-the-art KV cache quantization methods.\nWe accomplish this by quantizing and caching the layer input activations X,\ninstead of using standard KV caching, and then rematerializing the Keys and\nValues on-the-fly during inference. This results in an immediate 2$\\times$\nmemory savings compared to KV caching. By applying XQuant, we achieve up to\n$\\sim 7.7\\times$ memory savings with $<0.1$ perplexity degradation compared to\nthe FP16 baseline. Furthermore, our approach leverages the fact that X values\nare similar across layers. Building on this observation, we introduce\nXQuant-CL, which exploits the cross-layer similarity in the X embeddings for\nextreme compression. Across different models, XQuant-CL attains up to\n10$\\times$ memory savings relative to the FP16 baseline with only 0.01\nperplexity degradation, and 12.5$\\times$ memory savings with only $0.1$\nperplexity degradation. XQuant exploits the rapidly increasing compute\ncapabilities of hardware platforms to eliminate the memory bottleneck, while\nsurpassing state-of-the-art KV cache quantization methods and achieving\nnear-FP16 accuracy across a wide range of models."

                "summary": "Vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit remarkable zero-shot capabilities but\nstruggle with distribution shifts in downstream tasks when labeled data is\nunavailable, which has motivated the development of Test-Time Adaptation (TTA)\nto improve VLMs' performance during inference without annotations. Among\nvarious TTA approaches, cache-based methods show promise by preserving\nhistorical knowledge from low-entropy samples in a dynamic cache and fostering\nefficient adaptation. However, these methods face two critical reliability\nchallenges: (1) entropy often becomes unreliable under distribution shifts,\ncausing error accumulation in the cache and degradation in adaptation\nperformance; (2) the final predictions may be unreliable due to inflexible\ndecision boundaries that fail to accommodate large downstream shifts. To\naddress these challenges, we propose a Reliable Test-time Adaptation (ReTA)\nmethod that integrates two complementary strategies to enhance reliability from\ntwo perspectives. First, to mitigate the unreliability of entropy as a sample\nselection criterion for cache construction, we introduce Consistency-aware\nEntropy Reweighting (CER), which incorporates consistency constraints to weight\nentropy during cache updating. While conventional approaches rely solely on low\nentropy for cache prioritization and risk introducing noise, our method\nleverages predictive consistency to maintain a high-quality cache and\nfacilitate more robust adaptation.

                    "value": "Vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit remarkable zero-shot capabilities but\nstruggle with distribution shifts in downstream tasks when labeled data is\nunavailable, which has motivated the development of Test-Time Adaptation (TTA)\nto improve VLMs' performance during inference without annotations. Among\nvarious TTA approaches, cache-based methods show promise by preserving\nhistorical knowledge from low-entropy samples in a dynamic cache and fostering\nefficient adaptation. However, these methods face two critical reliability\nchallenges: (1) entropy often becomes unreliable under distribution shifts,\ncausing error accumulation in the cache and degradation in adaptation\nperformance; (2) the final predictions may be unreliable due to inflexible\ndecision boundaries that fail to accommodate large downstream shifts. To\naddress these challenges, we propose a Reliable Test-time Adaptation (ReTA)\nmethod that integrates two complementary strategies to enhance reliability from\ntwo perspectives. First, to mitigate the unreliability of entropy as a sample\nselection criterion for cache construction, we introduce Consistency-aware\nEntropy Reweighting (CER), which incorporates consistency constraints to weight\nentropy during cache updating. While conventional approaches rely solely on low\nentropy for cache prioritization and risk introducing noise, our method\nleverages predictive consistency to maintain a high-quality cache and\nfacilitate more robust adaptation.

                "summary": "An emerging paradigm in vision-and-language navigation (VLN) is the use of\nhistory-aware multi-modal transformer models. Given a language instruction,\nthese models process observation and navigation history to predict the most\nappropriate action for an agent. While they have significantly improved\nperformance, the scale of these models can be a bottleneck in practical\nsettings with limited computational resources. In this work, we propose a novel\ninput-adaptive navigation method to enhance VLN model efficiency. We first show\nthat existing input-adaptive mechanisms fail to reduce computations without\nsubstantial performance degradation. To address this, we introduce three\nadaptive algorithms, each deployed at a different level: (1) To improve spatial\nefficiency, we selectively process panoramic views at each observation of an\nagent. (2) To improve intra-model efficiency, we propose importance-based\nadaptive thresholding for the early-exit methods. (3) To improve temporal\nefficiency, we implement a caching mechanism that prevents reprocessing of\nviews previously seen by the agent. In evaluations on seven VLN benchmarks, we\ndemonstrate over a 2$\\times$ reduction in computation across three\noff-the-shelf agents in both standard and continuous environments.

                    "value": "An emerging paradigm in vision-and-language navigation (VLN) is the use of\nhistory-aware multi-modal transformer models. Given a language instruction,\nthese models process observation and navigation history to predict the most\nappropriate action for an agent. While they have significantly improved\nperformance, the scale of these models can be a bottleneck in practical\nsettings with limited computational resources. In this work, we propose a novel\ninput-adaptive navigation method to enhance VLN model efficiency. We first show\nthat existing input-adaptive mechanisms fail to reduce computations without\nsubstantial performance degradation. To address this, we introduce three\nadaptive algorithms, each deployed at a different level: (1) To improve spatial\nefficiency, we selectively process panoramic views at each observation of an\nagent. (2) To improve intra-model efficiency, we propose importance-based\nadaptive thresholding for the early-exit methods. (3) To improve temporal\nefficiency, we implement a caching mechanism that prevents reprocessing of\nviews previously seen by the agent. In evaluations on seven VLN benchmarks, we\ndemonstrate over a 2$\\times$ reduction in computation across three\noff-the-shelf agents in both standard and continuous environments.

The\nTDM enables precise localization of editable regions and guides a Scheduled KV\nInjection mechanism that ensures stable and faithful editing.

Motivated by the divergence between inversion and editing\ntrajectories, we compute a Trajectory Divergence Map (TDM) by comparing\ntoken-wise velocity differences between the inversion and denoising paths. The\nTDM enables precise localization of editable regions and guides a Scheduled KV\nInjection mechanism that ensures stable and faithful editing. To facilitate a\nrigorous evaluation, we introduce ReShapeBench, a new benchmark comprising 120\nnew images and enriched prompt pairs specifically curated for shape-aware\nediting. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior editability\nand visual fidelity, particularly in tasks requiring large-scale shape\nreplacement."

To address these challenges, we\npropose Causal Diffusion Policy (CDP), a novel transformer-based diffusion\nmodel that enhances action prediction by conditioning on historical action\nsequences, thereby enabling more coherent and context-aware visuomotor policy\nlearning. To further mitigate the computational cost associated with\nautoregressive inference, a caching mechanism is also introduced to store\nattention key-value pairs from previous timesteps, substantially reducing\nredundant computations during execution. Extensive experiments in both\nsimulated and real-world environments, spanning diverse 2D and 3D manipulation\ntasks, demonstrate that CDP uniquely leverages historical action sequences to\nachieve significantly higher accuracy than existing methods. Moreover, even\nwhen faced with degraded input observation quality, CDP maintains remarkable\nprecision by reasoning through temporal continuity, which highlights its\npractical robustness for robotic control under realistic, imperfect conditions.",

Rather than caching keys and\nvalues separately, MLA stores their compressed latent representations, reducing\nmemory overhead while maintaining the performance. While MLA improves memory\nefficiency without compromising language model accuracy, its major limitation\nlies in its integration during the pre-training phase, requiring models to be\ntrained from scratch. This raises a key question: can we use MLA's benefits\nfully or partially in models that have already been pre-trained with different\nattention mechanisms? In this paper, we propose X-EcoMLA to deploy post\ntraining distillation to enable the upcycling of Transformer-based attention\ninto an efficient hybrid MLA variant through lightweight post-training\nadaptation, bypassing the need for extensive pre-training. We demonstrate that\nleveraging the dark knowledge of a well-trained model can enhance training\naccuracy and enable extreme KV cache compression in MLA without compromising\nmodel performance.

A\ncompetitor-discovery AI agent, given an indication, retrieves all drugs\ncomprising the competitive landscape of that indication and extracts canonical\nattributes for these drugs. The competitor definition is investor-specific, and\ndata is paywalled/licensed, fragmented across registries, ontology-mismatched\nby indication, alias-heavy for drug names, multimodal, and rapidly changing.\nAlthough considered the best tool for this problem, the current LLM-based AI\nsystems aren't capable of reliably retrieving all competing drug names, and\nthere is no accepted public benchmark for this task. To address the lack of\nevaluation, we use LLM-based agents to transform five years of multi-modal,\nunstructured diligence memos from a private biotech VC fund into a structured\nevaluation corpus mapping indications to competitor drugs with normalized\nattributes.

                    "value": "In this paper, we describe and benchmark a competitor-discovery component\nused within an agentic AI system for fast drug asset due diligence. A\ncompetitor-discovery AI agent, given an indication, retrieves all drugs\ncomprising the competitive landscape of that indication and extracts canonical\nattributes for these drugs. The competitor definition is investor-specific, and\ndata is paywalled/licensed, fragmented across registries, ontology-mismatched\nby indication, alias-heavy for drug names, multimodal, and rapidly changing.\nAlthough considered the best tool for this problem, the current LLM-based AI\nsystems aren't capable of reliably retrieving all competing drug names, and\nthere is no accepted public benchmark for this task. To address the lack of\nevaluation, we use LLM-based agents to transform five years of multi-modal,\nunstructured diligence memos from a private biotech VC fund into a structured\nevaluation corpus mapping indications to competitor drugs with normalized\nattributes. We also introduce a competitor validating LLM-as-a-judge agent that\nfilters out false positives from the list of predicted competitors to maximize\nprecision and suppress hallucinations. On this benchmark, our\ncompetitor-discovery agent achieves 83% recall, exceeding OpenAI Deep Research\n(65%) and Perplexity Labs (60%).

Using an out-of-distribution (OOD) variant of the 24-point card game\nand new spectrum-based diagnostics, we revisit how these two stages reshape\nmodel representation and OOD performance. Our key findings are- (1) RL-FT can\nrestore much of the OOD performance loss from SFT (e.g., Llama-11B 8.97% to\n15.38%, Qwen-7B 17.09% to 19.66%). But when SFT induces severe overfitting and\na clear distribution shift, RL-FT cannot fully recover OOD performance. (2)\nDirection shifts of singular vectors matter more than singular value\nmagnitudes. These shifts concentrate on directions linked to the largest and\nsmallest singular values, leaving the bulk spectrum intact. (3) Low-rank and\nshallow recovery is effective: restoring singular vector directions for the top\n20% of values or first 25% of layers recovers 70-80% of OOD performance. (4)\nStronger SFT checkpoints enable better recovery by RL, while overfitted ones\nresist restoration. These results reconcile prior reports of RL superior OOD\nperformance: RL primarily counteracts SFT-induced directional drift rather than\nfinding new solutions. Our spectrum-aware analysis highlights inexpensive\nrecovery knobs low-rank UV merging and shallow-layer resets that practitioners\ncan use before costly RL fine-tuning.",

Using an out-of-distribution (OOD) variant of the 24-point card game\nand new spectrum-based diagnostics, we revisit how these two stages reshape\nmodel representation and OOD performance. Our key findings are- (1) RL-FT can\nrestore much of the OOD performance loss from SFT (e.g., Llama-11B 8.97% to\n15.38%, Qwen-7B 17.09% to 19.66%). But when SFT induces severe overfitting and\na clear distribution shift, RL-FT cannot fully recover OOD performance. (2)\nDirection shifts of singular vectors matter more than singular value\nmagnitudes. These shifts concentrate on directions linked to the largest and\nsmallest singular values, leaving the bulk spectrum intact. (3) Low-rank and\nshallow recovery is effective: restoring singular vector directions for the top\n20% of values or first 25% of layers recovers 70-80% of OOD performance. (4)\nStronger SFT checkpoints enable better recovery by RL, while overfitted ones\nresist restoration. These results reconcile prior reports of RL superior OOD\nperformance: RL primarily counteracts SFT-induced directional drift rather than\nfinding new solutions. Our spectrum-aware analysis highlights inexpensive\nrecovery knobs low-rank UV merging and shallow-layer resets that practitioners\ncan use before costly RL fine-tuning."

Existing\nReinforcement Learning (RL) methods train large reasoning models on a\nsingle-turn paradigm with verifiable rewards. However, we observe that models\ntrained with existing RL paradigms often lose their ability to solve problems\nacross multiple turns and struggle to revise answers based on contextual\nfeedback, leading to repetitive responses. We ask: can LRMs learn to reflect\ntheir answers in a multi-turn context? In this work, we find that training\nmodels with multi-turn RL using only unary feedback (e.g., \"Let's try again\")\nafter wrong answers can improve both single-turn performance and multi-turn\nreasoning. We introduce Unary Feedback as Observation (UFO) for reinforcement\nlearning, which uses minimal yet common unary user feedback during iterative\nproblem solving. It can be easily applied to existing single-turn RL training\nsetups. Experimental results show that RL training with UFO keeps single-turn\nperformance and improves multi-turn reasoning accuracy by up to 14%, enabling\nlanguage models to better react to feedback in multi-turn problem solving. To\nfurther minimize the number of turns needed for a correct answer while\nencouraging diverse reasoning when mistakes occur, we design reward structures\nthat guide models to produce careful and deliberate answers in each turn.

This\nleaves many unanswered questions about the roles of different factors in the\nsynthetic data pipeline, such as the impact of filtering low-quality problems.\nTo address this gap, we introduce FLAMES, a Framework for LLM Assessment of\nMath rEasoning Data Synthesis, and perform a systematic study of 10 existing\ndata synthesis strategies and multiple other factors impacting the performance\nof synthetic math reasoning data. Our FLAMES experiments provide several\nvaluable insights about the optimal balance of difficulty and diversity of\nsynthetic data. First, data agents designed to increase problem complexity lead\nto best improvements on most math metrics. Second, with a fixed data generation\nbudget, keeping higher problem coverage is more important than keeping only\nproblems with reliable solutions. Third, GSM8K- and MATH-based synthetic data\ncan lead to improvements on competition-level benchmarks, showcasing\neasy-to-hard generalization. Leveraging insights from our FLAMES experiments,\nwe design two novel data synthesis strategies for improving out-of-domain\ngeneralization and robustness. Further, we develop the FLAMES dataset, an\neffective blend of our novel and existing data synthesis strategies,\noutperforming public datasets on OlympiadBench (+15.7), CollegeMath (+4.5),\nGSMPlus (+6.5), and MATH (+3.1). Fine-tuning Qwen2.5-Math-7B on the FLAMES\ndataset achieves 81.4% on MATH, surpassing larger Llama3 405B, GPT-4o and\nClaude 3.5 Sonnet.",

This\nleaves many unanswered questions about the roles of different factors in the\nsynthetic data pipeline, such as the impact of filtering low-quality problems.\nTo address this gap, we introduce FLAMES, a Framework for LLM Assessment of\nMath rEasoning Data Synthesis, and perform a systematic study of 10 existing\ndata synthesis strategies and multiple other factors impacting the performance\nof synthetic math reasoning data. Our FLAMES experiments provide several\nvaluable insights about the optimal balance of difficulty and diversity of\nsynthetic data. First, data agents designed to increase problem complexity lead\nto best improvements on most math metrics. Second, with a fixed data generation\nbudget, keeping higher problem coverage is more important than keeping only\nproblems with reliable solutions. Third, GSM8K- and MATH-based synthetic data\ncan lead to improvements on competition-level benchmarks, showcasing\neasy-to-hard generalization. Leveraging insights from our FLAMES experiments,\nwe design two novel data synthesis strategies for improving out-of-domain\ngeneralization and robustness. Further, we develop the FLAMES dataset, an\neffective blend of our novel and existing data synthesis strategies,\noutperforming public datasets on OlympiadBench (+15.7), CollegeMath (+4.5),\nGSMPlus (+6.5), and MATH (+3.1). Fine-tuning Qwen2.5-Math-7B on the FLAMES\ndataset achieves 81.4% on MATH, surpassing larger Llama3 405B, GPT-4o and\nClaude 3.5 Sonnet."

We further\ninvestigate various fine-tuning configurations and tasks to clarify the\ntrade-offs between data scale and training efficiency, verify that the model\nretains its general capabilities without significant catastrophic forgetting\nafter training, and explore the distillation benefits to other LRLs on SLMs\n(Khasi, Assamese, and Ukrainian).

Our results show that the\nattack has a high success rate, demonstrating that even a single adversarial\nagent within the system can have a significant impact on the security. This\nattack remains effective even when agents use a simple prompting-based defense\nstrategy. However, we additionally propose a more effective defense based on\nmessage monitoring.

We show the effectiveness of our method across two\npopular zero-shot incremental protocols, Class-IL and MTIL, comprising a total\nof 14 datasets. The codebase is available at\nhttps://github.com/aimagelab/mammoth."

Their resonant configurations suggest that they migrated inwards\nfrom more distant formation locations, and we attribute their low densities to\nthe incorporation and retention of significant amounts of water during their\nformation. We confirm that the ultra-short-period exoplanets 55 Cnc e and\nWASP-47 e have densities inconsistent with pure-rock compositions.

Despite\npromising accuracy, existing deep learning methods often suffer from high\ncomputational complexity and slow inference speeds, which limit their\ndeployment in resource-constrained industrial environments.

However,\nthese methods often suffer from increased computational overhead and lack\neffective cross-scale feature interaction, limiting their ability to fully\nleverage multiscale representations. To address these challenges, we propose\nGMBINet, a lightweight framework that enhances multiscale feature extraction\nand interaction through novel Group Multiscale Bidirectional Interactive (GMBI)\nmodules. The GMBI adopts a group-wise strategy for multiscale feature\nextraction, ensuring scale-agnostic computational complexity.

Retrieval usually emphasizes\nrelevance, which indicates \"topic-relatedness\" of a document to a query, while\nin RAG, the value of a document (or utility) depends on how it contributes to\nanswer generation.

In this paper, we analyze X\n(formerly Twitter) discussions on climate change throughout 2019, using an\nunsupervised method centered on chambers--second-order information sources--to\nuncover ideological patterns at scale. Beyond direct connections, chambers\ncapture shared sources of influence, revealing polarization dynamics\nefficiently and effectively. Analyzing retweet patterns, we identify echo\nchambers of climate believers and skeptics, revealing strong chamber overlap\nwithin ideological groups and minimal overlap between them, resulting in a\nrobust bimodal structure that characterizes polarization. Our method enables us\nto infer the stance of high-impact users based on their audience's chamber\nalignment, allowing for the classification of over half the retweeting\npopulation with minimal cross-group interaction, in what we term augmented echo\nchamber classification. We benchmark our approach against manual labeling and a\nstate-of-the-art latent ideology model, finding comparable performance but with\nnearly four times greater coverage. Moreover, we find that echo chamber\nstructures remain stable over time, even as their members change significantly,\nsuggesting that these structures are a persistent and emergent property of the\nsystem. Notably, polarization decreases and climate skepticism rises during the\n#FridaysForFuture strikes in September 2019. This chamber-based analysis offers\nvaluable insights into the persistence and fluidity of ideological polarization\non social media.",

However, their\neffectiveness in specialized, low-resource domains-such as Arabic legal\ncontexts-remains limited. This paper introduces MizanQA (pronounced Mizan,\nmeaning \"scale\" in Arabic, a universal symbol of justice), a benchmark designed\nto evaluate LLMs on Moroccan legal question answering (QA) tasks, characterised\nby rich linguistic and legal complexity. The dataset draws on Modern Standard\nArabic, Islamic Maliki jurisprudence, Moroccan customary law, and French legal\ninfluences. Comprising over 1,700 multiple-choice questions, including\nmulti-answer formats, MizanQA captures the nuances of authentic legal\nreasoning. Benchmarking experiments with multilingual and Arabic-focused LLMs\nreveal substantial performance gaps, highlighting the need for tailored\nevaluation metrics and culturally grounded, domain-specific LLM development."

However, limited by the safety alignment mechanisms of LLMs,\nthe synthesis of harmful data still faces challenges in generation reliability\nand content diversity.

This study investigates whether integrating\naggression detection as an auxiliary task within a unified training framework\ncan enhance the generalisation and performance of large language models (LLMs)\nin cyberbullying detection. Experiments are conducted on five aggression\ndatasets and one cyberbullying dataset using instruction-tuned LLMs. We\nevaluated multiple strategies: zero-shot, few-shot, independent LoRA\nfine-tuning, and multi-task learning (MTL). Given the inconsistent results of\nMTL, we propose an enriched prompt pipeline approach in which aggression\npredictions are embedded into cyberbullying detection prompts to provide\ncontextual augmentation. Preliminary results show that the enriched prompt\npipeline consistently outperforms standard LoRA fine-tuning, indicating that\naggression-informed context significantly boosts cyberbullying detection. This\nstudy highlights the potential of auxiliary tasks, such as aggression\ndetection, to improve the generalisation of LLMs for safety-critical\napplications on social networks.",

                    "value": "Detecting cyberbullying on social media remains a critical challenge due to\nits subtle and varied expressions. This study investigates whether integrating\naggression detection as an auxiliary task within a unified training framework\ncan enhance the generalisation and performance of large language models (LLMs)\nin cyberbullying detection. Experiments are conducted on five aggression\ndatasets and one cyberbullying dataset using instruction-tuned LLMs. We\nevaluated multiple strategies: zero-shot, few-shot, independent LoRA\nfine-tuning, and multi-task learning (MTL). Given the inconsistent results of\nMTL, we propose an enriched prompt pipeline approach in which aggression\npredictions are embedded into cyberbullying detection prompts to provide\ncontextual augmentation. Preliminary results show that the enriched prompt\npipeline consistently outperforms standard LoRA fine-tuning, indicating that\naggression-informed context significantly boosts cyberbullying detection. This\nstudy highlights the potential of auxiliary tasks, such as aggression\ndetection, to improve the generalisation of LLMs for safety-critical\napplications on social networks."

This study represents a significant step toward addressing the\nbiological reasoning blind spot in current LLMs, demonstrating that targeted\nreinforcement learning on carefully curated data can unlock generalizable\nperformance in specialized models, thereby accelerating AI-driven biological\ndiscovery."

To address the lack of\nevaluation, we use LLM-based agents to transform five years of multi-modal,\nunstructured diligence memos from a private biotech VC fund into a structured\nevaluation corpus mapping indications to competitor drugs with normalized\nattributes. We also introduce a competitor validating LLM-as-a-judge agent that\nfilters out false positives from the list of predicted competitors to maximize\nprecision and suppress hallucinations. On this benchmark, our\ncompetitor-discovery agent achieves 83% recall, exceeding OpenAI Deep Research\n(65%) and Perplexity Labs (60%).

Using an out-of-distribution (OOD) variant of the 24-point card game\nand new spectrum-based diagnostics, we revisit how these two stages reshape\nmodel representation and OOD performance. Our key findings are- (1) RL-FT can\nrestore much of the OOD performance loss from SFT (e.g., Llama-11B 8.97% to\n15.38%, Qwen-7B 17.09% to 19.66%). But when SFT induces severe overfitting and\na clear distribution shift, RL-FT cannot fully recover OOD performance. (2)\nDirection shifts of singular vectors matter more than singular value\nmagnitudes. These shifts concentrate on directions linked to the largest and\nsmallest singular values, leaving the bulk spectrum intact. (3) Low-rank and\nshallow recovery is effective: restoring singular vector directions for the top\n20% of values or first 25% of layers recovers 70-80% of OOD performance. (4)\nStronger SFT checkpoints enable better recovery by RL, while overfitted ones\nresist restoration. These results reconcile prior reports of RL superior OOD\nperformance: RL primarily counteracts SFT-induced directional drift rather than\nfinding new solutions.

In energy context\nthis includes key decarbonisation enablement contexts, such as low-carbon\ntechnologies, distributed renewable energy generation, and demand-side response\n[1,2]. However, they tend to be costly, time-consuming, and can be affected by\nrespondent fatigue and ethical constraints. Large language models (LLMs) have\ndemonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating human-like textual\nresponses, prompting growing interest in their application to survey research.\nThis study investigates the use of LLMs to simulate consumer choices in\nenergy-related SP surveys and explores their integration into data analysis\nworkflows. A series of test scenarios were designed to systematically assess\nthe simulation performance of several LLMs (LLaMA 3.1, Mistral, GPT-3.5 and\nDeepSeek-R1) at both individual and aggregated levels, considering contexts\nfactors such as prompt design, in-context learning (ICL), chain-of-thought\n(CoT) reasoning, LLM types, integration with traditional choice models, and\npotential biases. Cloud-based LLMs do not consistently outperform smaller local\nmodels. In this study, the reasoning model DeepSeek-R1 achieves the highest\naverage accuracy (77%) and outperforms non-reasoning LLMs in accuracy, factor\nidentification, and choice distribution alignment. Across models, systematic\nbiases are observed against the gas boiler and no-retrofit options, with a\npreference for more energy-efficient alternatives. The findings suggest that\nprevious SP choices are the most effective input factor, while longer prompts\nwith additional factors and varied formats can cause LLMs to lose focus,\nreducing accuracy.",

Existing\nReinforcement Learning (RL) methods train large reasoning models on a\nsingle-turn paradigm with verifiable rewards. However, we observe that models\ntrained with existing RL paradigms often lose their ability to solve problems\nacross multiple turns and struggle to revise answers based on contextual\nfeedback, leading to repetitive responses. We ask: can LRMs learn to reflect\ntheir answers in a multi-turn context? In this work, we find that training\nmodels with multi-turn RL using only unary feedback (e.g., \"Let's try again\")\nafter wrong answers can improve both single-turn performance and multi-turn\nreasoning. We introduce Unary Feedback as Observation (UFO) for reinforcement\nlearning, which uses minimal yet common unary user feedback during iterative\nproblem solving. It can be easily applied to existing single-turn RL training\nsetups. Experimental results show that RL training with UFO keeps single-turn\nperformance and improves multi-turn reasoning accuracy by up to 14%, enabling\nlanguage models to better react to feedback in multi-turn problem solving. To\nfurther minimize the number of turns needed for a correct answer while\nencouraging diverse reasoning when mistakes occur, we design reward structures\nthat guide models to produce careful and deliberate answers in each turn.

Using common\nquantization method directly on node embeddings may overlooks their graph based\nstructure, causing error accumulation during message passing and degrading the\nquality of quantized embeddings.To address this, we propose Graph based\nNode-Aware Dynamic Quantization training for collaborative filtering (GNAQ), a\nnovel quantization approach that leverages graph structural information to\nenhance the balance between efficiency and accuracy of GNNs for Top-K\nrecommendation. GNAQ introduces a node-aware dynamic quantization strategy that\nadapts quantization scales to individual node embeddings by incorporating graph\ninteraction relationships. Specifically, it initializes quantization intervals\nbased on node-wise feature distributions and dynamically refines them through\nmessage passing in GNN layers. This approach mitigates information loss caused\nby fixed quantization scales and captures hierarchical semantic features in\nuser-item interaction graphs. Additionally, GNAQ employs graph relation-aware\ngradient estimation to replace traditional straight-through estimators,\nensuring more accurate gradient propagation during training. Extensive\nexperiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that GNAQ outperforms\nstate-of-the-art quantization methods, including BiGeaR and N2UQ, by achieving\naverage improvement in 27.8\\% Recall@10 and 17.6\\% NDCG@10 under 2-bit\nquantization. In particular, GNAQ is capable of maintaining the performance of\nfull-precision models while reducing their model sizes by 8 to 12 times; in\naddition, the training time is twice as fast compared to quantization baseline\nmethods.",

We develop a comprehensive set of expressive Blender Python APIs\ncapable of synthesizing intricate geometries. Leveraging these APIs, we\nconstruct a large-scale paired object-code dataset, where the code for each\nobject is decomposed into distinct semantic parts.

Our approach not only achieves superior\nperformance in shape-to-code reconstruction tasks but also facilitates\nintuitive geometric and topological editing through convenient code\nmodifications. Furthermore, our code-based representation enhances the\nreasoning capabilities of LLMs in 3D shape understanding tasks.

In this\npaper, we introduce AIRL-S, the first natural unification of RL-based and\nsearch-based TTS.

Specifically, we leverage adversarial inverse reinforcement\nlearning (AIRL) combined with group relative policy optimization (GRPO) to\nlearn a dense, dynamic PRM directly from correct reasoning traces, entirely\neliminating the need for labeled intermediate process data. At inference, the\nresulting PRM simultaneously serves as the critic for RL rollouts and as a\nheuristic to effectively guide search procedures, facilitating robust reasoning\nchain extension, mitigating reward hacking, and enhancing cross-task\ngeneralization. Experimental results across eight benchmarks, including\nmathematics, scientific reasoning, and code generation, demonstrate that our\nunified approach improves performance by 9 % on average over the base model,\nmatching GPT-4o. Furthermore, when integrated into multiple search algorithms,\nour PRM consistently outperforms all baseline PRMs trained with labeled data.\nThese results underscore that, indeed, your reward function for RL is your best\nPRM for search, providing a robust and cost-effective solution to complex\nreasoning tasks in LLMs.",

These sustained, large\npower fluctuations, unlike conventional load ramping, act as persistent forcing\ninputs capable of interacting with and amplifying local and inter-area\noscillation modes. Using the WECC 179-bus system as a test case, we examine the\namplitude and variability of oscillatory responses under different factors,\nranging from system strength, penetration level, fluctuation frequency range,\nindividual datacenter size, to geographical deployment. Simulation results show\nthat, notably, narrower fluctuation bands, larger single-site capacities, or\ndispersed siting can intensify oscillations across multiple modes. Our models\nand numerical studies provide a quantitative basis for integrating AI-dominant\nelectricity demands into grid oscillation studies, and further support the\ndevelopment of new planning and operational measures to power the continuous AI\nload growth.",

Our approach\nproves viable, with the best performing model, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, yielding\n55.6\\% of games without any errors.

Showing compliance requires\ntracing requirements to legal provisions. Requirements traceability is a key\ntask where engineers must analyze technical requirements against target\nartifacts, often within limited time. Manually analyzing complex systems with\nhundreds of requirements is infeasible. The legal dimension adds challenges\nthat increase effort. In this paper, we investigate two automated solutions\nbased on language models, including large ones (LLMs). The first solution,\nKashif, is a classifier that leverages sentence transformers and semantic\nsimilarity. The second solution, RICE_LRT, prompts a recent generative LLM\nbased on RICE, a prompt engineering framework. On a benchmark dataset, we\nempirically evaluate Kashif and compare it against five different baseline\nclassifiers from the literature. Kashif can identify trace links with a recall\nof 67%, precision of 50%, and F2 score of 63%, outperforming the best baseline\nby a substantial margin of 41 percentage points (pp) in F2. However, on unseen,\nmore complex requirements documents traced to the European General Data\nProtection Regulation (GDPR), Kashif performs poorly, yielding an average\nrecall of 15%, an average precision of 10%, and an average F2 score of 13.5%.\nOn the same documents, however, our RICE solution yields an average recall of\n84%, an average precision of 30%, and an average F2 score of 61%. RICE achieved\na remarkable improvement of 47.5 pp over Kashif in terms of F2 score. Our\nresults suggest that requirements traceability in the legal context cannot be\nsimply addressed by building classifiers, as such solutions do not generalize\nand fail to perform well on complex regulations and requirements. Resorting to\ngenerative LLMs, with careful prompt engineering, is thus a more promising\nalternative.",

However, the lack of QA datasets in\nspecific domains and languages hinders the development of robust AI models able\nto generalize across various domains and languages. To this end, we introduce\nRoMedQA, the first Romanian QA benchmark for the medical domain, alongside a\ncomprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). We\nconstruct a high-quality and large-scale dataset comprising 102,646 QA pairs\nrelated to cancer patients. The questions regard medical case summaries of\n1,011 patients, requiring either keyword extraction or reasoning to be answered\ncorrectly. RoMedQA is the result of a time-consuming manual annotation process\ncarried out by seven physicians specialized in oncology or radiotherapy, who\nspent a total of about 2,100 work hours to generate the QA pairs. We experiment\nwith four LLMs from distinct families of models on RoMedQA. Each model is\nemployed in two scenarios, namely one based on zero-shot prompting and one\nbased on supervised fine-tuning. Our results show that fine-tuned models\nsignificantly outperform their zero-shot counterparts, clearly indicating that\npretrained models fail to generalize on RoMedQA. Our findings demonstrate the\nimportance of both domain-specific and language-specific fine-tuning for\nreliable clinical QA in Romanian. We publicly release our dataset and code at\nhttps://github.com/ana-rogoz/RoMedQA.",

However, the lack of QA datasets in\nspecific domains and languages hinders the development of robust AI models able\nto generalize across various domains and languages. To this end, we introduce\nRoMedQA, the first Romanian QA benchmark for the medical domain, alongside a\ncomprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). We\nconstruct a high-quality and large-scale dataset comprising 102,646 QA pairs\nrelated to cancer patients. The questions regard medical case summaries of\n1,011 patients, requiring either keyword extraction or reasoning to be answered\ncorrectly. RoMedQA is the result of a time-consuming manual annotation process\ncarried out by seven physicians specialized in oncology or radiotherapy, who\nspent a total of about 2,100 work hours to generate the QA pairs. We experiment\nwith four LLMs from distinct families of models on RoMedQA. Each model is\nemployed in two scenarios, namely one based on zero-shot prompting and one\nbased on supervised fine-tuning. Our results show that fine-tuned models\nsignificantly outperform their zero-shot counterparts, clearly indicating that\npretrained models fail to generalize on RoMedQA. Our findings demonstrate the\nimportance of both domain-specific and language-specific fine-tuning for\nreliable clinical QA in Romanian. We publicly release our dataset and code at\nhttps://github.com/ana-rogoz/RoMedQA."

To support efficient modeling across different\nsystem scales, we introduce the Mamba-Attention Integrated Transformer (MAIT),\na hybrid neural architecture that combines the long-range dependency modeling\ncapability of attention mechanisms with the efficient temporal dynamic\nrepresentation of Mamba. Furthermore, a Trajectory-Group Relative Policy\nOptimization (T-GRPO) method is proposed to achieve unified policy gradient\noptimization in both discrete and continuous trajectory spaces for MAIT\ntraining.

To reduce this cost and\nleverage the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in relevance judgments,\nwe aim to explore whether LLM-generated annotations can effectively replace\nhuman annotations in training retrieval models. Retrieval usually emphasizes\nrelevance, which indicates \"topic-relatedness\" of a document to a query, while\nin RAG, the value of a document (or utility) depends on how it contributes to\nanswer generation. Recognizing this mismatch, some researchers use LLM\nperformance on downstream tasks with documents as labels, but this approach\nrequires manual answers for specific tasks, leading to high costs and limited\ngeneralization. In another line of work, prompting LLMs to select useful\ndocuments as RAG references eliminates the need for human annotation and is not\ntask-specific. If we leverage LLMs' utility judgments to annotate retrieval\ndata, we may retain cross-task generalization without human annotation in\nlarge-scale corpora. Therefore, we investigate utility-focused annotation via\nLLMs for large-scale retriever training data across both in-domain and\nout-of-domain settings on the retrieval and RAG tasks. To reduce the impact of\nlow-quality positives labeled by LLMs, we design a novel loss function, i.e.,\nDisj-InfoNCE. Our experiments reveal that: (1) Retrievers trained on\nutility-focused annotations significantly outperform those trained on human\nannotations in the out-of-domain setting on both tasks, demonstrating superior\ngeneralization capabilities. (2) LLM annotation does not replace human\nannotation in the in-domain setting. However, incorporating just 20%\nhuman-annotated data enables retrievers trained with utility-focused\nannotations to match the performance of models trained entirely with human\nannotations.",

The dataset draws on Modern Standard\nArabic, Islamic Maliki jurisprudence, Moroccan customary law, and French legal\ninfluences. Comprising over 1,700 multiple-choice questions, including\nmulti-answer formats, MizanQA captures the nuances of authentic legal\nreasoning.

However, their\neffectiveness in specialized, low-resource domains-such as Arabic legal\ncontexts-remains limited. This paper introduces MizanQA (pronounced Mizan,\nmeaning \"scale\" in Arabic, a universal symbol of justice), a benchmark designed\nto evaluate LLMs on Moroccan legal question answering (QA) tasks, characterised\nby rich linguistic and legal complexity. The dataset draws on Modern Standard\nArabic, Islamic Maliki jurisprudence, Moroccan customary law, and French legal\ninfluences. Comprising over 1,700 multiple-choice questions, including\nmulti-answer formats, MizanQA captures the nuances of authentic legal\nreasoning. Benchmarking experiments with multilingual and Arabic-focused LLMs\nreveal substantial performance gaps, highlighting the need for tailored\nevaluation metrics and culturally grounded, domain-specific LLM development."

                "summary": "Unit tests play a vital role in uncovering potential faults in software.\nWhile tools like EvoSuite focus on maximizing code coverage, recent advances in\nlarge language models (LLMs) have shifted attention toward LLM-based test\ngeneration. However, code coverage metrics -- such as line and branch coverage\n-- remain overly emphasized in reported research, despite being weak indicators\nof a test suite's fault-detection capability. In contrast, mutation score\noffers a more reliable and stringent measure, as demonstrated in our findings\nwhere some test suites achieve 100% coverage but only 4% mutation score.\nAlthough a few studies consider mutation score, the effectiveness of LLMs in\nkilling mutants remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose MUTGEN, a\nmutation-guided, LLM-based test generation approach that incorporates mutation\nfeedback directly into the prompt.

                    "value": "Unit tests play a vital role in uncovering potential faults in software.\nWhile tools like EvoSuite focus on maximizing code coverage, recent advances in\nlarge language models (LLMs) have shifted attention toward LLM-based test\ngeneration. However, code coverage metrics -- such as line and branch coverage\n-- remain overly emphasized in reported research, despite being weak indicators\nof a test suite's fault-detection capability. In contrast, mutation score\noffers a more reliable and stringent measure, as demonstrated in our findings\nwhere some test suites achieve 100% coverage but only 4% mutation score.\nAlthough a few studies consider mutation score, the effectiveness of LLMs in\nkilling mutants remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose MUTGEN, a\nmutation-guided, LLM-based test generation approach that incorporates mutation\nfeedback directly into the prompt. Evaluated on 204 subjects from two\nbenchmarks, MUTGEN significantly outperforms both EvoSuite and vanilla\nprompt-based strategies in terms of mutation score.

This paper presents a\ncomprehensive survey on federated tuning for LLMs. We propose a taxonomy\ncategorizing existing studies along two axes: model access-based and parameter\nefficiency-based optimization. We classify FedLLM approaches into white-box,\ngray-box, and black-box techniques, highlighting representative methods within\neach category. We review emerging research treating LLMs as black-box inference\nAPIs and discuss promising directions and open challenges for future research.",

This challenge is amplified when targeting newer or\nless-documented GPU architectures where traditional development aids are\nscarce. This paper introduces an LLM-powered \"GPU Kernel Scientist,\" an\nautomated methodology for iteratively refining accelerator kernels.\n  Our methodology employs LLMs in a multi-stage, evolutionary process: (a)\nstrategically selecting promising prior code versions as a basis for new\niterations; (b) generating hypotheses for optimization experiments, based on\nexisting code and assimilated knowledge from general GPU literature; and (c)\nautonomously implementing these experiments through code modification and\nsubsequent submission to an external evaluation system, using only observed\ntiming data as performance feedback. We detail how this approach navigates the\nchallenges of the AMD MI300 target architecture and leverages LLMs to\ncompensate for limited domain-specific human expertise.\n  In addition to our results, we present the architectural design, operational\nworkflow, and qualitative insights, highlighting the potential of LLM-driven\nagents to democratise and accelerate GPU kernel optimization, especially in\nresource-constrained or rapidly updating hardware environment.",

                    "value": "Optimizing GPU kernels for high performance is a complex task, often\ndemanding deep architectural knowledge, extensive profiling, and iterative\nexperimentation. This challenge is amplified when targeting newer or\nless-documented GPU architectures where traditional development aids are\nscarce. This paper introduces an LLM-powered \"GPU Kernel Scientist,\" an\nautomated methodology for iteratively refining accelerator kernels.\n  Our methodology employs LLMs in a multi-stage, evolutionary process: (a)\nstrategically selecting promising prior code versions as a basis for new\niterations; (b) generating hypotheses for optimization experiments, based on\nexisting code and assimilated knowledge from general GPU literature; and (c)\nautonomously implementing these experiments through code modification and\nsubsequent submission to an external evaluation system, using only observed\ntiming data as performance feedback. We detail how this approach navigates the\nchallenges of the AMD MI300 target architecture and leverages LLMs to\ncompensate for limited domain-specific human expertise.\n  In addition to our results, we present the architectural design, operational\nworkflow, and qualitative insights, highlighting the potential of LLM-driven\nagents to democratise and accelerate GPU kernel optimization, especially in\nresource-constrained or rapidly updating hardware environment."

We argue that the ability of current LLMs\nto prove statements largely depends on whether they have encountered the\nrelevant proof process during training. This reliance limits their deeper\nunderstanding of mathematical theorems and related concepts.

Common evaluation methods, such\nas usability testing and inspection, are effective but resource-intensive and\nrequire expert involvement. This makes them less accessible for smaller\norganizations. Recent advances in multimodal LLMs offer promising opportunities\nto automate usability evaluation processes partly by analyzing textual, visual,\nand structural aspects of software interfaces.

Common evaluation methods, such\nas usability testing and inspection, are effective but resource-intensive and\nrequire expert involvement. This makes them less accessible for smaller\norganizations. Recent advances in multimodal LLMs offer promising opportunities\nto automate usability evaluation processes partly by analyzing textual, visual,\nand structural aspects of software interfaces.
