                "summary": "Can Large language models (LLMs) learn to reason without any weight update and only through in-context learning (ICL)? ICL is strikingly sample-efficient, often learning from only a handful of demonstrations, but complex reasoning tasks typically demand many training examples to learn from. However, naively scaling ICL by adding more demonstrations breaks down at this scale: attention costs grow quadratically, performance saturates or degrades with longer contexts, and the approach remains a shallow form of learning. Due to these limitations, practitioners predominantly rely on in-weight learning (IWL) to induce reasoning. In this work, we show that by using Prefix Tuning, LLMs can learn to reason without overloading the context window and without any weight updates. We introduce $\\textbf{ReasonCACHE}$, an instantiation of this mechanism that distills demonstrations into a fixed key-value cache. Empirically, across challenging reasoning benchmarks, including GPQA-Diamond, ReasonCACHE outperforms standard ICL and matches or surpasses IWL approaches. Further, it achieves this all while being more efficient across three key axes: data, inference cost, and trainable parameters. We also theoretically prove that ReasonCACHE can be strictly more expressive than low-rank weight update since the latter ties expressivity to input rank, whereas ReasonCACHE bypasses this constraint by directly injecting key-values into the attention mechanism. Together, our findings identify ReasonCACHE as a middle path between in-context and in-weight learning, providing a scalable algorithm for learning reasoning skills beyond the context window without modifying parameters.

                "summary": "Video generation is pivotal to digital media creation, and recent advances in autoregressive video generation have markedly enhanced the efficiency of real-time video synthesis. However, existing approaches generally rely on heuristic KV Cache policies, which ignore differences in token importance in long-term video generation. This leads to the loss of critical spatiotemporal information and the accumulation of redundant, invalid cache, thereby degrading video generation quality and efficiency. To address this limitation, we first observe that token contributions to video generation are highly time-heterogeneous and accordingly propose a novel Past- and Future-Informed KV Cache Policy (PaFu-KV). Specifically, PaFu-KV introduces a lightweight Salience Estimation Head distilled from a bidirectional teacher to estimate salience scores, allowing the KV cache to retain informative tokens while discarding less relevant ones. This policy yields a better quality-efficiency trade-off by shrinking KV cache capacity and reducing memory footprint at inference time. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that our method preserves high-fidelity video generation quality while enables accelerated inference, thereby enabling more efficient long-horizon video generation.

                    "value": "Video generation is pivotal to digital media creation, and recent advances in autoregressive video generation have markedly enhanced the efficiency of real-time video synthesis. However, existing approaches generally rely on heuristic KV Cache policies, which ignore differences in token importance in long-term video generation. This leads to the loss of critical spatiotemporal information and the accumulation of redundant, invalid cache, thereby degrading video generation quality and efficiency. To address this limitation, we first observe that token contributions to video generation are highly time-heterogeneous and accordingly propose a novel Past- and Future-Informed KV Cache Policy (PaFu-KV). Specifically, PaFu-KV introduces a lightweight Salience Estimation Head distilled from a bidirectional teacher to estimate salience scores, allowing the KV cache to retain informative tokens while discarding less relevant ones. This policy yields a better quality-efficiency trade-off by shrinking KV cache capacity and reducing memory footprint at inference time. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that our method preserves high-fidelity video generation quality while enables accelerated inference, thereby enabling more efficient long-horizon video generation. Our code will be released upon paper acceptance."

We present Stream, a compilable hierarchical pruning algorithm that estimates per-head sparse attention masks in near-linear time $O(T \\log T)$ and linear space $O(T)$, enabling one-pass interpretability at scale. Stream performs a binary-search-style refinement to retain only the top-$k$ key blocks per query while preserving the model's next-token behavior.

Our method offers a practical drop-in tool for analyzing attention patterns and tracing information flow without terabytes of caches.

In this work, we study redundancy in autoregressive video diffusion and identify three persistent sources: near-duplicate cached keys across frames, slowly evolving (largely semantic) queries/keys that make many attention computations redundant, and cross-attention over long prompts where only a small subset of tokens matters per frame. Building on these observations, we propose a unified, training-free attention framework for autoregressive diffusion: TempCache compresses the KV cache via temporal correspondence to bound cache growth; AnnCA accelerates cross-attention by selecting frame-relevant prompt tokens using fast approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) matching; and AnnSA sparsifies self-attention by restricting each query to semantically matched keys, also using a lightweight ANN. Together, these modules reduce attention, compute, and memory and are compatible with existing autoregressive diffusion backbones and world models.

We unify and extend recent work by introducing a framework for approximate LLM inference that leverages small draft models to more accurately predict token and KV pair importance. We provide novel theoretical and empirical analyses justifying lookahead-based importance estimation techniques. Within this framework, we present: (i) SpecKV, the first method to use lookahead with a small draft model to enable precise KV cache dropping; (ii) SpecPC, which leverages draft model attention activations to identify and discard less important prompt tokens; and (iii) SpecKV-PC, a cascaded compression strategy combining both techniques.

Within this framework, we present: (i) SpecKV, the first method to use lookahead with a small draft model to enable precise KV cache dropping; (ii) SpecPC, which leverages draft model attention activations to identify and discard less important prompt tokens; and (iii) SpecKV-PC, a cascaded compression strategy combining both techniques. Extensive experiments on long-context benchmarks demonstrate that our methods consistently achieve higher accuracy than existing baselines while retaining the same efficiency gains in memory usage, latency, and throughput."

To overcome this, we introduce the Collaborative Memory Transformer (CoMeT), a novel architecture that enables LLMs to handle arbitrarily long sequences with constant memory usage and linear time complexity. Designed as an efficient, plug-in module, CoMeT can be integrated into pre-trained models with only minimal fine-tuning. It operates on sequential data chunks, using a dual-memory system to manage context: a temporary memory on a FIFO queue for recent events, and a global memory with a gated update rule for long-range dependencies. These memories then act as a dynamic soft prompt for the next chunk. To enable efficient fine-tuning on extremely long contexts, we introduce a novel layer-level pipeline parallelism strategy. The effectiveness of our approach is remarkable: a model equipped with CoMeT and fine-tuned on 32k contexts can accurately retrieve a passkey from any position within a 1M token sequence. On the SCROLLS benchmark, CoMeT surpasses other efficient methods and achieves performance comparable to a full-attention baseline on summarization tasks.

The stacked OneTrans blocks share parameters across similar sequential tokens while assigning token-specific parameters to non-sequential tokens. Through causal attention and cross-request KV caching, OneTrans enables precomputation and caching of intermediate representations, significantly reducing computational costs during both training and inference.

Conventional next-token prediction methods define the process as learning the conditional probability distribution of successive tokens. Recently, next-scale prediction methods redefine the process to learn the distribution over multi-scale representations, significantly reducing generation latency. However, these methods condition each scale on all previous scales and require each token to consider all preceding tokens, exhibiting scale and spatial redundancy. To better model the distribution by mitigating redundancy, we propose Markovian Visual AutoRegressive modeling (MVAR), a novel autoregressive framework that introduces scale and spatial Markov assumptions to reduce the complexity of conditional probability modeling. Specifically, we introduce a scale-Markov trajectory that only takes as input the features of adjacent preceding scale for next-scale prediction, enabling the adoption of a parallel training strategy that significantly reduces GPU memory consumption. Furthermore, we propose spatial-Markov attention, which restricts the attention of each token to a localized neighborhood of size k at corresponding positions on adjacent scales, rather than attending to every token across these scales, for the pursuit of reduced modeling complexity. Building on these improvements, we reduce the computational complexity of attention calculation from O(N^2) to O(Nk), enabling training with just eight NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPUs and eliminating the need for KV cache during inference.

In this work, we revisit where and how to distill in autoregressive LLMs. We disentangle selective KD along the position, class, and sample axes and systematically compare importance signals and selection policies. Then, guided by this analysis, we identify underexplored opportunities and introduce student-entropy-guided position selection (SE-KD). Across a suite of benchmarks, SE-KD often improves accuracy, downstream task adherence, and memory efficiency over dense distillation. Extending this approach across the class and sample axes (SE-KD 3X) yields complementary efficiency gains that make offline teacher caching feasible.

Despite sharing base model weights, each agent independently builds and stores its own KV cache for the same long, tool-augmented trajectories, incurring substantial memory and compute overhead. Existing KV cache sharing methods largely overlook this multi-LoRA setting. We observe that, across agents, cache differences are dominated by adapter outputs, while activations from the shared pretrained backbone remain highly similar. Based on this observation, we propose LRAgent, a KV cache sharing framework for multi-LoRA agents that decomposes the cache into a shared base component from the pretrained weights and an adapter-dependent component from LoRA weights. LRAgent reduces memory overhead by sharing the base component and storing the adapter component in its inherent low-rank form, and further reduces compute overhead, enabled by shared-$A$ multi-LoRA architectures, by also sharing the low-rank cache and avoiding redundant computations for contexts already processed by other agents. To efficiently reconstruct adapter contributions at runtime, we introduce Flash-LoRA-Attention, a kernel that reorders attention computation to avoid materializing the low-rank cache to full dimension. LRAgent achieves throughput and time-to-first-token latency close to fully shared caching, while preserving accuracy near the non-shared caching baseline across agentic question-answering benchmarks.",

To our knowledge, no prior work quantifies these cost savings or compares caching strategies for multi-turn agentic tasks. We present a comprehensive evaluation of prompt caching across three major LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google) and compare three caching strategies, including full context caching, system prompt only caching, and caching that excludes dynamic tool results. We evaluate on DeepResearch Bench, a multi-turn agentic benchmark where agents autonomously execute real-world web search tool calls to answer complex research questions, measuring both API cost and time to first token (TTFT) across over 500 agent sessions with 10,000-token system prompts. Our results demonstrate that prompt caching reduces API costs by 41-80% and improves time to first token by 13-31% across providers. We find that strategic prompt cache block control, such as placing dynamic content at the end of the system prompt, avoiding dynamic traditional function calling, and excluding dynamic tool results, provides more consistent benefits than naive full-context caching, which can paradoxically increase latency. An ablation study across prompt sizes (500-50,000 tokens) and tool call counts (3-50) demonstrates universal linear cost and TTFT benefits, after the provider caching token minimum, and reveal provider-specific strategy discrepancies across variants.

Test-Time Scaling (TTS) offers a promising solution by allocating more compute during inference to enhance the reasoning capability of edge LLMs. However, current TTS methods introduce heavy hardware performance overhead on resource-constrained devices, making them impractical for real applications. To address this challenge, we present FastTTS, a serving system that enables fast and efficient TTS for memory-constrained LLM reasoning. After analyzing common patterns across various TTS methods and identifying their performance bottlenecks, we introduce three novel techniques: i) Speculative Beam Extension, which mitigates system stragglers caused by irregular reasoning paths, ii) Asymmetric Multi-Model Memory Allocation, which dynamically balances memory usage between token generation and reasoning-step verification, and iii) Dynamic Prefix-Aware Scheduling, which optimizes reasoning execution to maximize KV-cache reuse across search paths.

To bridge this compute divide, we introduce Distill3R, a framework designed to distill the geometric reasoning of 3D foundation models into compact students fully trainable on a single workstation. Our methodology centers on two primary innovations: (1) an offline caching pipeline that decouples heavy teacher inference from the training loop through compressed supervision signals, and (2) a confidence-aware distillation loss that leverages teacher uncertainty to enable training on commodity hardware. We propose a 72M-parameter student model which achieves a 9x reduction in parameters and a 5x inference speedup compared to its 650M-parameter teacher. The student is fully trainable in under 3 days on a single workstation, whereas its teacher requires massive GPU clusters for up to a week. We demonstrate that the student preserves the structural consistency and qualitative geometric understanding required for functional 3D awareness. By providing a reproducible, single-workstation training recipe, Distill3R serves as an exploratory entry point for democratized 3D vision research and efficient edge deployment. This work is not intended to compete with state-of-the-art foundation models, but to provide an accessible research baseline for laboratories without access to large-scale compute to train and specialize models on their own domain-specific data at minimal cost.",

However, they suffer from high computational overhead under industrial latency and throughput requirements. In particular, cross-encoder ranking systems often create long context prefill-heavy workloads, as the model has to be presented with the user, query and item information. To this end, we propose MixLM, a novel LLM-based ranking framework, which significantly improves the system throughput via reducing the input context length, while preserving the semantic strength of cross-encoder rankers. In contrast to a standard ranking system where the context is presented to the model as pure text, we propose to use mix-interaction, a mixture of text and embedding tokens to represent the input. Specifically, MixLM encodes all items in the catalog into a few embedding tokens and stores in a nearline cache. The encoded item descriptions are used during online inference, effectively reducing the item length from a few thousand text tokens to a few embedding tokens. We share insights from deploying our MixLM framework to a real-world search application at LinkedIn, including a detailed discussion of our training pipelines, as well as a thorough analysis of our online serving infrastructure optimization. With the same latency budget and on-par relevance metrics, MixLM increased throughput by 10.0x comparing with strong baselines, 75.9x over full-text LLM rerankers.

Improving inference efficiency is therefore essential for practical robotic applications. Existing acceleration methods often rely on heuristic or static strategies--such as rule-based token caching or pruning--that are decoupled from task objectives and fail to adapt to dynamic scene changes. In this work, we reformulate inference acceleration as a learnable policy optimization problem and propose a novel framework that integrates a dynamic, task-aware decision-making process directly into the VLA model. At its core are two lightweight, cooperative modules: a Cached Token Selector, which determines which tokens should be reused, and a Cache Ratio Predictor, which controls how many tokens to reuse. Training these modules is non-trivial due to their discrete decisions. We address this by adopting a differentiable relaxation that allows gradient-based end-to-end optimization. Extensive experiments on the LIBERO and SIMPLER benchmarks, as well as real-robot evaluations, show that our method achieves a 1.76x wall-clock inference speedup while simultaneously improving the average success rate by 1.9 percentage points (from 75.0% to 76.9%) on LIBERO and by 5.0 percentage points on real-world tasks, significantly outperforming existing baselines. This work highlights the potential of learning task-aware computational allocation policies, paving the way for VLA models that are both powerful and efficient.",

In this work, we reformulate inference acceleration as a learnable policy optimization problem and propose a novel framework that integrates a dynamic, task-aware decision-making process directly into the VLA model. At its core are two lightweight, cooperative modules: a Cached Token Selector, which determines which tokens should be reused, and a Cache Ratio Predictor, which controls how many tokens to reuse. Training these modules is non-trivial due to their discrete decisions. We address this by adopting a differentiable relaxation that allows gradient-based end-to-end optimization. Extensive experiments on the LIBERO and SIMPLER benchmarks, as well as real-robot evaluations, show that our method achieves a 1.76x wall-clock inference speedup while simultaneously improving the average success rate by 1.9 percentage points (from 75.0% to 76.9%) on LIBERO and by 5.0 percentage points on real-world tasks, significantly outperforming existing baselines. This work highlights the potential of learning task-aware computational allocation policies, paving the way for VLA models that are both powerful and efficient."

While recent works have explored this problem either assuming clairvoyance -- exact knowledge of response lengths -- or relying on machine-learned predictions, obtaining robust performance guarantees without any prior knowledge of job sizes remains a theoretically fundamental and practically important open problem.\n  In this work, we propose the Geometric Slicing Algorithm (GSA), the non-clairvoyant policy to achieve the first constant competitive ratio for this problem in the offline batch setting. GSA manages uncertainty through a geometric phase structure that periodically restarts jobs to bound memory exposure, combined with a staggered pipeline mechanism that enables high concurrency by smoothing aggregate memory consumption. We prove that GSA achieves a competitive ratio of at most 61.92 for general instances, improving to 32 in the large-memory regime. Our algorithmic framework also yields a clairvoyant counterpart, the Geometric Batching Algorithm (GBA), which achieves an approximation ratio of 10.67 for general instances and 6.75 in the large-memory regime -- significantly improving upon the best previously known bound of over 9000.

To further enhance efficiency in regimes where the fractional order $α$ is close to 2 and trajectories become excessively long, we introduce a truncated path strategy with a prescribed maximum step count. Building on this, we propose a buffered supervision mechanism that caches training pairs and progressively refines their Monte Carlo targets during training, removing the need to precompute a highly accurate training set and yielding the buffered fractional neural walk-on-spheres method (BFNWoS).

In this work, we introduce the Large Lookup Layer (L$^3$), which unlocks a new axis of sparsity by generalizing embedding tables to model decoder layers. L$^3$ layers use static token-based routing to aggregate a set of learned embeddings per token in a context-dependent way, allowing the model to efficiently balance memory and compute by caching information in embeddings. L$^3$ has two main components: (1) a systems-friendly architecture that allows for fast training and CPU-offloaded inference with no overhead, and (2) an information-theoretic embedding allocation algorithm that effectively balances speed and quality. We empirically test L$^3$ by training transformers with up to 2.6B active parameters and find that L$^3$ strongly outperforms both dense models and iso-sparse MoEs in both language modeling and downstream tasks.",

Log parsing, which extracts structured events from massive unstructured log data, is a critical first step for downstream tasks like anomaly detection and failure diagnosis.

However, existing LLM-based log parsers all focus on the constant part of logs, ignoring the potential contribution of the variable part to log parsing. This constant-centric strategy brings four key problems. First, inefficient log grouping and sampling with only constant information.

Third, a relatively large number of consumed constant tokens in prompts leads to high LLM invocation costs.

To address the need for faster density estimation for 3D human motion prediction, we introduce a novel flow-based method for human motion prediction called CacheFlow. Unlike previous conditional generative models that suffer from poor time efficiency, CacheFlow takes advantage of an unconditional flow-based generative model that transforms a Gaussian mixture into the density of future motions. The results of the computation of the flow-based generative model can be precomputed and cached. Then, for conditional prediction, we seek a mapping from historical trajectories to samples in the Gaussian mixture. This mapping can be done by a much more lightweight model, thus saving significant computation overhead compared to a typical conditional flow model. In such a two-stage fashion and by caching results from the slow flow model computation, we build our CacheFlow without loss of prediction accuracy and model expressiveness. This inference process is completed in approximately one millisecond, making it 4 times faster than previous VAE methods and 30 times faster than previous diffusion-based methods on standard benchmarks such as Human3.6M and AMASS datasets. Furthermore, our method demonstrates improved density estimation accuracy and comparable prediction accuracy to a SOTA method on Human3.6M.

Model-based mechanisms compute prospective action values using an internal model of the environment, supporting flexible but computationally costly planning; model-free mechanisms cache value estimates and build heuristics that enable fast, efficient habitual responding; and memory-based mechanisms allow rapid adaptation from individual experience. In this work, we aim to elucidate the computational principles underlying this biological efficiency and translate them into a sampling algorithm for scalable Bayesian inference through effective exploration of the posterior distribution. More specifically, our proposed algorithm comprises three components: a model-based module that uses the target distribution for guided but computationally slow sampling; a model-free module that uses previous samples to learn patterns in the parameter space, enabling fast, reflexive sampling without directly evaluating the expensive target distribution; and an episodic-control module that supports rapid sampling by recalling specific past events (i.e., samples). We show that this approach advances Bayesian methods and facilitates their application to large-scale statistical machine learning problems. In particular, we apply our proposed framework to Bayesian deep learning, with an emphasis on proper and principled uncertainty quantification.",

Model-based mechanisms compute prospective action values using an internal model of the environment, supporting flexible but computationally costly planning; model-free mechanisms cache value estimates and build heuristics that enable fast, efficient habitual responding; and memory-based mechanisms allow rapid adaptation from individual experience. In this work, we aim to elucidate the computational principles underlying this biological efficiency and translate them into a sampling algorithm for scalable Bayesian inference through effective exploration of the posterior distribution. More specifically, our proposed algorithm comprises three components: a model-based module that uses the target distribution for guided but computationally slow sampling; a model-free module that uses previous samples to learn patterns in the parameter space, enabling fast, reflexive sampling without directly evaluating the expensive target distribution; and an episodic-control module that supports rapid sampling by recalling specific past events (i.e., samples). We show that this approach advances Bayesian methods and facilitates their application to large-scale statistical machine learning problems. In particular, we apply our proposed framework to Bayesian deep learning, with an emphasis on proper and principled uncertainty quantification."

These failures stem from the ragged tensor problem: sequences in the same batch accept different numbers of draft tokens, desynchronizing position IDs, attention masks, and KV-cache state. We present the first authentic batch speculative decoding framework. We (1) formalize the synchronization invariants that valid batch speculative decoding must satisfy, (2) present EQSPEC, the first algorithm that guarantees output equivalence, and analyze its cost structure to show that alignment overhead grows superlinearly and consumes up to 40\\% of computation, and (3) introduce EXSPEC, which reduces this overhead through cross-batch scheduling that dynamically groups same-length sequences. On SpecBench across Vicuna-7B/68M, Qwen3-8B/0.6B, and GLM-4-9B/0.6B pairs, our methods achieve up to 3x throughput improvement at batch size 8 while maintaining algorithmic correctness. Our methods achieve 95\\% decoding-equivalence, with residual divergence attributable to floating-point non-determinism in GPU inference, not the synchronization failures that cause near-zero equivalence of prior methods.

To address the optimization instability of causal diffusion, we introduce a soft-tailed masking schema to preserve local context and a context-aware reweighting mechanism derived from signal-to-noise principles. This design enables dynamic parallel decoding, where the model leverages KV-caching to adaptively generate variable-length token sequences based on confidence. Empirically, CARD outperforms existing discrete diffusion baselines while reducing training latency by 3 $\\times$ compared to block diffusion methods.

By shaping the initial noise and its geometric alignment, background generation naturally avoids designated foreground regions, allowing readable content to remain intact without auxiliary mechanisms. To address the long-standing issue of stylistic drift across pages, we decouple style control from text conditioning and introduce cached style directions as persistent vectors in latent space. Once selected, these directions constrain diffusion trajectories to a shared stylistic subspace, ensuring consistent appearance across pages and editing iterations. This formulation eliminates the need for repeated prompt-based style specification and provides a more stable foundation for multi-page generation. Our framework admits a geometric and physical interpretation, where diffusion paths evolve on a latent manifold shaped by preferred directions, and foreground regions are rarely traversed as a consequence of trajectory initialization rather than explicit exclusion. The proposed method is training-free, compatible with existing diffusion backbones, and produces visually coherent, foreground-preserving results across complex documents.

A common mitigation is to compress cached keys and values by projecting per-head matrixes to a lower rank, storing only the projections in the HBM. However, existing post-training approaches typically fit these projections using SVD-style proxy objectives, which may poorly reflect end-to-end reconstruction after softmax, value mixing, and subsequent decoder-layer transformations.\n  For these reasons, we introduce StiefAttention, a post-training KV-cache compression method that learns \\emph{orthonormal} projection bases by directly minimizing \\emph{decoder-layer output reconstruction error}. StiefAttention additionally precomputes, for each layer, an error-rank profile over candidate ranks, enabling flexible layer-wise rank allocation under a user-specified error budget. Noteworthy, on Llama3-8B under the same conditions, StiefAttention outperforms EigenAttention by $11.9$ points on C4 perplexity and $5.4\\%$ on 0-shot MMLU accuracy at iso-compression, yielding lower relative error and higher cosine similarity with respect to the original decoder-layer outputs.",

To address these limitations, we propose RecNet, a self-evolving preference propagation framework that proactively propagates real-time preference updates across related users and items. RecNet consists of two complementary phases. In the forward phase, the centralized preference routing mechanism leverages router agents to integrate preference updates and dynamically propagate them to the most relevant agents. To ensure accurate and personalized integration of propagated preferences, we further introduce a personalized preference reception mechanism, which combines a message buffer for temporary caching and an optimizable, rule-based filter memory to guide selective preference assimilation based on past experience and interests. In the backward phase, the feedback-driven propagation optimization mechanism simulates a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, using LLMs for credit assignment, gradient analysis, and module-level optimization, enabling continuous self-evolution of propagation strategies. Extensive experiments on various scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of RecNet in modeling preference propagation for recommender systems.",

However, we prove that, with the current formulation of Lorentz linear layers, the hyperbolic norms of the outputs scale logarithmically with the number of gradient descent steps, nullifying the key advantage of hyperbolic geometry. We propose a new Lorentz linear layer grounded in the well-known ``distance-to-hyperplane\" formulation.

Prior training-free KV cache offloading alleviates this by keeping redundant context on the CPU and fetching only a sparse subset for attention, but it often degrades long-generation quality due to training-inference mismatch on sparse patterns. Meanwhile, trainable sparse attention is incompatible with efficient offloading, as unconstrained KV accesses may force large CPU-to-GPU transfers and erase throughput gains. To this end, we propose NOSA, a trainable sparse attention mechanism natively designed for KV cache offloading. NOSA explicitly constrains the volume of CPU-GPU KV transfers, thereby achieving low communication overhead and high decoding throughput. We further build NOSI, a KV cache offloading inference system that fully unlocks NOSA's efficiency. Empirical results on 1,3,8B LLMs demonstrate that NOSA outperforms KV cache offloading baselines on general, long-input, and long-generation tasks, while boosting decoding throughput by up to 5.04x, 1.92x, and 1.83x over FullAttn, InfLLMv2, and ShadowKV, respectively.

In this work, we present Ira, a framework to accelerate backup replay by transmitting compact \\emph{hints} alongside transaction batches. Our key insight is that the primary, having already executed transactions, possesses knowledge of future access patterns which is exactly the information needed for optimal replay.\n  We use Ethereum for our case study and present a concrete protocol, Ira-L, within our framework to improve cache management of Ethereum block execution. The primaries implementing Ira-L provide hints that consist of the working set of keys used in an Ethereum block and one byte of metadata per key indicating the table to read from, and backups use these hints for efficient block replay.\n  We evaluated Ira-L against the state-of-the-art Ethereum client reth over two weeks of Ethereum mainnet activity ($100,800$ blocks containing over $24$ million transactions). Our hints are compact, adding a median of $47$ KB compressed per block ($\\sim5\\%$ of block payload). We observe that the sequential hint generation and block execution imposes a $28.6\\%$ wall-time overhead on the primary, though the direct cost from hints is $10.9\\%$ of execution time; all of which can be pipelined and parallelized in production deployments. On the backup side, we observe that Ira-L achieves a median per-block speedup of $25\\times$ over baseline reth. With $16$ prefetch threads, aggregate replay time drops from $6.5$ hours to $16$ minutes ($23.6\\times$ wall-time speedup).",

                    "value": "In primary-backup replication, consensus latency is bounded by the time for backup nodes to replay (re-execute) transactions proposed by the primary. In this work, we present Ira, a framework to accelerate backup replay by transmitting compact \\emph{hints} alongside transaction batches. Our key insight is that the primary, having already executed transactions, possesses knowledge of future access patterns which is exactly the information needed for optimal replay.\n  We use Ethereum for our case study and present a concrete protocol, Ira-L, within our framework to improve cache management of Ethereum block execution. The primaries implementing Ira-L provide hints that consist of the working set of keys used in an Ethereum block and one byte of metadata per key indicating the table to read from, and backups use these hints for efficient block replay.\n  We evaluated Ira-L against the state-of-the-art Ethereum client reth over two weeks of Ethereum mainnet activity ($100,800$ blocks containing over $24$ million transactions). Our hints are compact, adding a median of $47$ KB compressed per block ($\\sim5\\%$ of block payload). We observe that the sequential hint generation and block execution imposes a $28.6\\%$ wall-time overhead on the primary, though the direct cost from hints is $10.9\\%$ of execution time; all of which can be pipelined and parallelized in production deployments. On the backup side, we observe that Ira-L achieves a median per-block speedup of $25\\times$ over baseline reth. With $16$ prefetch threads, aggregate replay time drops from $6.5$ hours to $16$ minutes ($23.6\\times$ wall-time speedup)."

Our system introduces a runtime scheduler that estimates token difficulty, performs adaptive chunking, and selects per-chunk LoRA rank and scaling using a rank-ladder mechanism. To preserve output consistency, we further introduce a boundary-safe composition module and integrate policy-driven KV-cache strategies. Experiments on benchmark datasets such as Wikitext-103 and SQuAD demonstrate that ChunkWise LoRA achieves up to 34\\% lower latency and 38% memory reduction compared to baseline LoRA, while maintaining or improving task performance metrics like BLEU, EM, and perplexity. The proposed framework remains fully compatible with existing transformer architectures and inference frameworks, providing a practical solution for real-world deployment of parameter-efficient LLMs.",

We introduce DeepFedNAS, a novel, two-phase framework underpinned by a multi-objective fitness function that synthesizes mathematical network design with architectural heuristics. Enabled by a re-engineered supernet, DeepFedNAS introduces Federated Pareto Optimal Supernet Training, which leverages a pre-computed Pareto-optimal cache of high-fitness architectures as an intelligent curriculum to optimize shared supernet weights. Subsequently, its Predictor-Free Search Method eliminates the need for costly accuracy surrogates by utilizing this fitness function as a direct, zero-cost proxy for accuracy, enabling on-demand subnet discovery in mere seconds. DeepFedNAS achieves state-of-the-art accuracy (e.g., up to 1.21% absolute improvement on CIFAR-100), superior parameter and communication efficiency, and a substantial ~61x speedup in total post-training search pipeline time. By reducing the pipeline from over 20 hours to approximately 20 minutes (including initial cache generation) and enabling 20-second individual subnet searches, DeepFedNAS makes hardware-aware FL deployments instantaneous and practical.

To better investigate underlying mechanism behind this issue, we analyze repetition generation through the lens of information flow. Our work reveals three key findings: (1) context tokens aggregate semantic information as anchors and guide the final predictions; (2) as information propagates across layers, the entropy of context tokens converges in deeper layers, reflecting the model's growing prediction certainty; (3) Repetition is typically linked to disruptions in the information flow of context tokens and to the inability of their entropy to converge in deeper layers. Based on these insights, we present \\textbf{CoTA}, a plug-and-play method for mitigating repetition. CoTA enhances the attention of context tokens to preserve intrinsic information flow patterns, while introducing a penalty term to the confidence score during decoding to avoid outputs driven by uncertain context tokens. With extensive experiments, CoTA demonstrates significant effectiveness in alleviating repetition and achieves consistent performance improvements on general tasks.

While existing KV cache compression methods focus on retaining high-importance KV pairs to minimize storage, they often overlook the modality-specific semantic redundancy patterns that emerge distinctively in multi-modal KV caches. In this work, we first analyze how, beyond simple importance, the KV cache in LVLMs exhibits varying levels of redundancy across attention heads. We show that relying solely on importance can only cover a subset of the full KV cache information distribution, leading to potential loss of semantic coverage. To address this, we propose MixKV, a novel method that mixes importance with diversity for optimized KV cache compression in LVLMs. MixKV adapts to head-wise semantic redundancy, selectively balancing diversity and importance when compressing KV pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MixKV consistently enhances existing methods across multiple LVLMs. Under extreme compression (budget=64), MixKV improves baseline methods by an average of 5.1% across five multi-modal understanding benchmarks and achieves remarkable gains of 8.0% and 9.0% for SnapKV and AdaKV on GUI grounding tasks, all while maintaining comparable inference efficiency.

Traditional methods typically assume that the worst-case execution time (WCET) of each task in the cause-effect chain is known.

This framework extracts scheduling information and structural characteristics of cause-effect chains, constructing fine-grained and scalable inter-core memory access contexts at the basic block level for time-sensitive shared cache analysis. This results in more accurate WCET (TSC-WCET) estimates, which are then used to derive the end-to-end latency.

                "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) can be fine-tuned on domain-specific data to enhance their performance in specialized fields. However, such data often contains numerous low-quality samples, necessitating effective data processing (DP). In practice, DP strategies are typically developed through iterative manual analysis and trial-and-error adjustment. These processes inevitably incur high labor costs and may lead to privacy issues in high-privacy domains like healthcare due to direct human access to sensitive data. Thus, achieving automated data processing without exposing the raw data has become a critical challenge. To address this challenge, we propose LLM-AutoDP, a novel framework that leverages LLMs as agents to automatically generate and optimize data processing strategies. Our method generates multiple candidate strategies and iteratively refines them using feedback signals and comparative evaluations. This iterative in-context learning mechanism enables the agent to converge toward high-quality processing pipelines without requiring direct human intervention or access to the underlying data. To further accelerate strategy search, we introduce three key techniques: Distribution Preserving Sampling, which reduces data volume while maintaining distributional integrity; Processing Target Selection, which uses a binary classifier to identify low-quality samples for focused processing; Cache-and-Reuse Mechanism}, which minimizes redundant computations by reusing prior processing results. Results show that models trained on data processed by our framework achieve over 80% win rates against models trained on unprocessed data. Compared to AutoML baselines based on LLM agents, LLM-AutoDP achieves approximately a 65% win rate. Moreover, our acceleration techniques reduce the total searching time by up to 10 times, demonstrating both effectiveness and efficiency.",

                    "value": "Large Language Models (LLMs) can be fine-tuned on domain-specific data to enhance their performance in specialized fields. However, such data often contains numerous low-quality samples, necessitating effective data processing (DP). In practice, DP strategies are typically developed through iterative manual analysis and trial-and-error adjustment. These processes inevitably incur high labor costs and may lead to privacy issues in high-privacy domains like healthcare due to direct human access to sensitive data.

The contributions of this paper are two-fold. First, we propose a Reward-free Alignment framework for Conflicted Objectives (RACO) that directly leverages pairwise preference data and resolves gradient conflicts via a novel clipped variant of conflict-averse gradient descent. We provide convergence guarantees to Pareto-critical points that respect user-specified objective weights, and further show that clipping can strictly improve convergence rate in the two-objective setting. Second, we improve our method using some heuristics and conduct experiments to demonstrate the compatibility of the proposed framework for LLM alignment.

Existing reasoning datasets often lack disciplinary breadth, reasoning depth, and diversity, as well as guiding principles for question synthesis. We propose DESIGNER: a DESIGN-logic-guidEd Reasoning data synthesis pipeline that leverages naturally available, extensive raw documents to generate multidisciplinary questions. The central insight is the notion of Design Logic, a form of reusable meta-knowledge that encapsulates the structured process human experts use to transform knowledge into complex exam questions, enabling LLMs to generate new questions with the same complex reasoning patterns from entirely different source texts with explicit control over difficulty, diversity, and question types. We use LLMs to reverse-engineer and abstract over 120,000 Design Logics from existing questions across various disciplines. By designing a two-stage retrieve-and-generate mechanism to match these Design Logics with raw corpus, we synthesized two large-scale reasoning datasets that span 75 disciplines: DLR-Book (3.04 million questions from the book corpus) and DLR-Web (1.66 million questions from the web corpus). Data analysis indicates that the questions synthesized by our method exhibit greater difficulty and diversity compared to those in the baseline datasets. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on Qwen3 and Llama3 with our data substantially improves multidisciplinary reasoning and outperforms baseline datasets. Notably, by applying SFT on the base versions of these models using only our data, we even surpass their official final models that have undergone the full post-training.",

Textual feedback is a natural mode of human interaction and is already abundant in many real-world settings, where users, annotators, and automated judges routinely critique LLM outputs. Towards leveraging text feedback at scale, we formalize a multi-turn RL setup, RL from Text Feedback (RLTF), where text feedback is available during training but not at inference. Therefore, models must learn to internalize the feedback in order to improve their test-time single-turn performance. To do this, we propose two methods: Self Distillation (RLTF-SD), which trains the single-turn policy to match its own feedback-conditioned second-turn generations; and Feedback Modeling (RLTF-FM), which predicts the feedback as an auxiliary objective. We provide theoretical analysis on both methods, and empirically evaluate on reasoning puzzles, competition math, and creative writing tasks.

Nevertheless, at the limits of model capability, CoT often proves insufficient, and its strictly sequential nature constrains test-time scalability. A potential alternative is divide-and-conquer (DAC) reasoning, which decomposes a complex problem into subproblems to facilitate more effective exploration of the solution. Although promising, our analysis reveals a fundamental misalignment between general-purpose post-training and DAC-style inference, which limits the model's capacity to fully leverage this potential. To bridge this gap and fully unlock LLMs' reasoning capabilities on the most challenging tasks, we propose an end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) framework to enhance their DAC-style reasoning capacity. At each step, the policy decomposes a problem into a group of subproblems, solves them sequentially, and addresses the original one conditioned on the subproblem solutions, with both decomposition and solution integrated into RL training. Under comparable training, our DAC-style framework endows the model with a higher performance ceiling and stronger test-time scalability, surpassing CoT by 8.6% in Pass@1 and 6.3% in Pass@32 on competition-level benchmarks.",

Nevertheless, at the limits of model capability, CoT often proves insufficient, and its strictly sequential nature constrains test-time scalability. A potential alternative is divide-and-conquer (DAC) reasoning, which decomposes a complex problem into subproblems to facilitate more effective exploration of the solution. Although promising, our analysis reveals a fundamental misalignment between general-purpose post-training and DAC-style inference, which limits the model's capacity to fully leverage this potential. To bridge this gap and fully unlock LLMs' reasoning capabilities on the most challenging tasks, we propose an end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) framework to enhance their DAC-style reasoning capacity. At each step, the policy decomposes a problem into a group of subproblems, solves them sequentially, and addresses the original one conditioned on the subproblem solutions, with both decomposition and solution integrated into RL training. Under comparable training, our DAC-style framework endows the model with a higher performance ceiling and stronger test-time scalability, surpassing CoT by 8.6% in Pass@1 and 6.3% in Pass@32 on competition-level benchmarks."

Extensive prior research suggests that this failure is an inherent, fundamental limit of autoregressive causal LLMs, indicating that these models tend to memorize factual-level knowledge rather than capture higher-level rules. In this paper, we challenge this view by showing that this seemingly fundamental limit can be mitigated by slightly tweaking the training data with a simple regularization data recipe called the Identity Bridge of the form \"$A \\to A$\" (e.g., The name of Alice is Alice). Theoretically, we prove that under this recipe, even a one-layer transformer can break the reversal curse by analyzing the implicit bias of gradient descent. Empirically, we show that a 1B pretrained language model finetuned with the proposed data recipe achieves a 40% success rate on reversal tasks, in stark contrast to a near-zero success rate when trained solely on forward-knowledge data. Our work provides a novel theoretical foundation for the reversal curse and offers a principled, low-cost path to encouraging LLMs to learn higher-level rules from data.",

This makes it difficult to determine their fundamental stellar parameters, such as radius or luminosity, and infer their evolutionary states. Aims. We aim to improve the distance estimates of Yellow Hypergiants (YHGs) and Yellow Supergiants (YSGs) by identifying possible cluster and association memberships. Using these distances, we derived updated luminosities and revised their positions in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. Methods. We compiled from the literature a sample of 35 luminous yellow massive stars (YHGs and the most luminous YSGs). We used Gaia DR3 astrometry to identify possible membership in clusters and OB associations. We derived distances by combining the parallaxes of nearby co-moving stars. We independently validated these distances by comparing the stellar radial velocities to the Galactic H I kinematic map. We combined angular diameters and effective temperature values from the literature with the new distances to estimate luminosities. Results. We improved the distance estimates for 28 of the 35 stars through association with co-moving stellar groups. For an additional six stars, we provided distance estimates based on the H I kinematic map. For one star, the distance remains unclear. Most YSGs are members of young stellar populations, while the environments of the YHGs are more diverse, and for some of them, their origin populations remain unclear. We derived updated luminosities for a subset of 20 stars. Most YHGs have luminosities above log L/L = 5.4, while YSGs occupy a wider range of luminosities and the most luminous YSGs have luminosities similar to YHGs.",

We compiled from the literature a sample of 35 luminous yellow massive stars (YHGs and the most luminous YSGs). We used Gaia DR3 astrometry to identify possible membership in clusters and OB associations. We derived distances by combining the parallaxes of nearby co-moving stars. We independently validated these distances by comparing the stellar radial velocities to the Galactic H I kinematic map. We combined angular diameters and effective temperature values from the literature with the new distances to estimate luminosities. Results. We improved the distance estimates for 28 of the 35 stars through association with co-moving stellar groups. For an additional six stars, we provided distance estimates based on the H I kinematic map. For one star, the distance remains unclear. Most YSGs are members of young stellar populations, while the environments of the YHGs are more diverse, and for some of them, their origin populations remain unclear. We derived updated luminosities for a subset of 20 stars. Most YHGs have luminosities above log L/L = 5.4, while YSGs occupy a wider range of luminosities and the most luminous YSGs have luminosities similar to YHGs."

Fine-grained MoE, featuring hundreds of well-trained experts per layer and multi-expert activation per token, offers an unexplored alternative through its rich routing space. We empirically characterize fine-grained MoE routing and uncover an informative pattern: router scores exhibit a certain head of high-confidence experts followed by an uncertain tail of low-confidence candidates. While single-run greedy accuracy remains stable when fewer experts are activated, multi-sample pass@n degrades significantly-suggesting that the certain head governs core reasoning capability while the uncertain tail correlates with reasoning diversity. Motivated by these findings, we propose Expert-Sample, a training-free method that preserves high-confidence selections while injecting controlled stochasticity into the uncertain tail, enabling diverse generation without destabilizing outputs. Evaluated on multiple fine-grained MoE models across math, knowledge reasoning, and code tasks, Expert-Sample consistently improves pass@n and verification-based accuracy.

We present NeuEdge, a framework that combines adaptive SNN models with hardware-aware optimization for edge deployment. NeuEdge uses a temporal coding scheme that blends rate and spike-timing patterns to reduce spike activity while preserving accuracy, and a hardware-aware training procedure that co-optimizes network structure and on-chip placement to improve utilization on neuromorphic processors. An adaptive threshold mechanism adjusts neuron excitability from input statistics, reducing energy consumption without degrading performance. Across standard vision and audio benchmarks, NeuEdge achieves 91-96% accuracy with up to 2.3 ms inference latency on edge hardware and an estimated 847 GOp/s/W energy efficiency. A case study on an autonomous-drone workload shows up to 312x energy savings relative to conventional deep neural networks while maintaining real-time operation.",

For LLM reasoning tasks, it is essential to estimate the uncertainty not only for the final answer, but also for the intermediate steps of the reasoning, as this can enable more fine-grained and targeted interventions. In this study, we explore what UQ metrics better reflect the LLM's ``intermediate uncertainty''during reasoning. Our study reveals that an LLMs' incorrect reasoning steps tend to contain tokens which are highly sensitive to the perturbations on the preceding token embeddings. In this way, incorrect (uncertain) intermediate steps can be readily identified using this sensitivity score as guidance in practice. In our experiments, we show such perturbation-based metric achieves stronger uncertainty quantification performance compared with baseline methods such as token (generation) probability and token entropy. Besides, different from approaches that rely on multiple sampling, the perturbation-based metrics offer better simplicity and efficiency.",

In this paper, we introduce SafeGround, an uncertainty-aware framework for GUI grounding models that enables risk-aware predictions through calibrations before testing. SafeGround leverages a distribution-aware uncertainty quantification method to capture the spatial dispersion of stochastic samples from outputs of any given model. Then, through the calibration process, SafeGround derives a test-time decision threshold with statistically guaranteed false discovery rate (FDR) control. We apply SafeGround on multiple GUI grounding models for the challenging ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark. Experimental results show that our uncertainty measure consistently outperforms existing baselines in distinguishing correct from incorrect predictions, while the calibrated threshold reliably enables rigorous risk control and potentials of substantial system-level accuracy improvements. Across multiple GUI grounding models, SafeGround improves system-level accuracy by up to 5.38\\% percentage points over Gemini-only inference.",

RE-GoT first decomposes tasks into text-attributed graphs, enabling comprehensive analysis and reward function generation, and then iteratively refines rewards using visual feedback from VLMs without human intervention. Extensive experiments on 10 RoboGen and 4 ManiSkill2 tasks demonstrate that RE-GoT consistently outperforms existing LLM-based baselines. On RoboGen, our method improves average task success rates by 32.25%, with notable gains on complex multi-step tasks. On ManiSkill2, RE-GoT achieves an average success rate of 93.73% across four diverse manipulation tasks, significantly surpassing prior LLM-based approaches and even exceeding expert-designed rewards.

First, we use a fine-tuned LLM to generate plausible misconceptions, and then retrieve the most promising candidates among these using embedding similarity with the input dialogue. These candidates are then assessed and re-ranked by another fine-tuned LLM to improve misconception relevance. Empirically, we evaluate our system on real dialogues from an educational tutoring platform. We consider multiple base LLM models including LLaMA, Qwen and Claude on zero-shot and fine-tuned settings. We find that our approach improves predictive performance over baseline models and that fine-tuning improves both generated misconception quality and can outperform larger closed-source models. Finally, we conduct ablation studies to both validate the importance of our generation and reranking steps on misconception generation quality.",

By injecting controlled synthetic uniformly random noise into otherwise clean datasets, we analyze training dynamics across model sizes ranging from 480M to 5.2B parameters. We show that noisy data indeed induces training loss divergence, and that the probability of divergence depends strongly on the noise type, amount of noise, and model scale.

Fully-connected feedforward layers (FFLs) introduce computation and parameter count bottlenecks within neural network architectures. To address this challenge, in this work, we propose a new class of dense layers that generalize standard fully-connected feedforward layers, \\textbf{E}fficient, \\textbf{U}nified and \\textbf{Gen}eral dense layers (EUGens). EUGens leverage random features to approximate standard FFLs and go beyond them by incorporating a direct dependence on the input norms in their computations. The proposed layers unify existing efficient FFL extensions and improve efficiency by reducing inference complexity from quadratic to linear time. They also lead to \\textbf{the first} unbiased algorithms approximating FFLs with arbitrary polynomial activation functions. Furthermore, EuGens reduce the parameter count and computational overhead while preserving the expressive power and adaptability of FFLs. We also present a layer-wise knowledge transfer technique that bypasses backpropagation, enabling efficient adaptation of EUGens to pre-trained models. Empirically, we observe that integrating EUGens into Transformers and MLPs yields substantial improvements in inference speed (up to \\textbf{27}\\%) and memory efficiency (up to \\textbf{30}\\%) across a range of tasks, including image classification, language model pre-training, and 3D scene reconstruction. Overall, our results highlight the potential of EUGens for the scalable deployment of large-scale neural networks in real-world scenarios.",

Fully-connected feedforward layers (FFLs) introduce computation and parameter count bottlenecks within neural network architectures. To address this challenge, in this work, we propose a new class of dense layers that generalize standard fully-connected feedforward layers, \\textbf{E}fficient, \\textbf{U}nified and \\textbf{Gen}eral dense layers (EUGens). EUGens leverage random features to approximate standard FFLs and go beyond them by incorporating a direct dependence on the input norms in their computations. The proposed layers unify existing efficient FFL extensions and improve efficiency by reducing inference complexity from quadratic to linear time. They also lead to \\textbf{the first} unbiased algorithms approximating FFLs with arbitrary polynomial activation functions. Furthermore, EuGens reduce the parameter count and computational overhead while preserving the expressive power and adaptability of FFLs. We also present a layer-wise knowledge transfer technique that bypasses backpropagation, enabling efficient adaptation of EUGens to pre-trained models. Empirically, we observe that integrating EUGens into Transformers and MLPs yields substantial improvements in inference speed (up to \\textbf{27}\\%) and memory efficiency (up to \\textbf{30}\\%) across a range of tasks, including image classification, language model pre-training, and 3D scene reconstruction. Overall, our results highlight the potential of EUGens for the scalable deployment of large-scale neural networks in real-world scenarios."

This paper introduces Long Input Fine-Tuning (LIFT), a novel framework for long-context modeling that can enhance the long-context performance of arbitrary short-context LLMs by dynamically adapting their parameters to the given long input. Importantly, rather than endlessly extending the context window size to accommodate increasingly longer inputs in context, LIFT stores and absorbs the long input in parameters. By fine-tuning the long input into model parameters, LIFT allows short-context LLMs to answer questions even when the required information is not provided in the context during inference, avoiding the quadratic complexity w.r.t. input length of a normal long context model. Furthermore, LIFT does not simply perform continued pretraining on new, long contexts, but leverages carefully designed LLM-generated synthetic tasks to enhance the comprehension of long contexts, moving beyond mere memorization. To accommodate the additional cost of fine-tuning, we design a highly optimized pipeline that reduces the Time to First Token (TTFT) to less than 10 seconds for 8k context. We further provide a comprehensive analysis of LIFT's strengths and limitations in long-context understanding, discuss its feasibility for large-scale real-world deployment, and highlight valuable directions for future research.",

By sparsifying input activations through sample-dependent masks, MEMOIR confines each edit to a distinct subset of the memory parameters, minimizing interference among edits. At inference, it identifies relevant edits by comparing the sparse activation patterns of new queries to those stored during editing. This enables generalization to rephrased queries by activating only the relevant knowledge while suppressing unnecessary memory activation for unrelated prompts. Experiments on question answering, hallucination correction, and out-of-distribution generalization benchmarks for LLaMA-3 and Mistral backbones demonstrate that MEMOIR achieves state-of-the-art performance across reliability, generalization, and locality metrics, scaling to thousands of sequential edits with minimal forgetting.",

Commercial malware detection software can be costly, and tools that attribute malware to the specific software vulnerabilities it exploits are largely lacking. Understanding the connection between malware and the vulnerabilities it targets is crucial for analyzing past threats and proactively defending against current ones. In this study, we propose an approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) to detect binary malware, specifically within JAR files, and uses LLM capabilities combined with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to identify Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) that malware may exploit. We developed a proof-of-concept tool, MalCVE, that integrates binary code decompilation, deobfuscation, LLM-based code summarization, semantic similarity search, and LLM-based CVE classification. We evaluated MalCVE using a benchmark dataset of 3,839 JAR executables. MalCVE achieved a mean malware-detection accuracy of 97%, at a fraction of the cost of commercial solutions. In particular, the results demonstrate that LLM-based code summarization enables highly accurate and explainable malware identification. MalCVE is also the first tool to associate CVEs with binary malware, achieving a recall@10 of 65%, which is comparable to studies that perform similar analyses on source code.",

ICL is strikingly sample-efficient, often learning from only a handful of demonstrations, but complex reasoning tasks typically demand many training examples to learn from. However, naively scaling ICL by adding more demonstrations breaks down at this scale: attention costs grow quadratically, performance saturates or degrades with longer contexts, and the approach remains a shallow form of learning. Due to these limitations, practitioners predominantly rely on in-weight learning (IWL) to induce reasoning. In this work, we show that by using Prefix Tuning, LLMs can learn to reason without overloading the context window and without any weight updates. We introduce $\\textbf{ReasonCACHE}$, an instantiation of this mechanism that distills demonstrations into a fixed key-value cache. Empirically, across challenging reasoning benchmarks, including GPQA-Diamond, ReasonCACHE outperforms standard ICL and matches or surpasses IWL approaches. Further, it achieves this all while being more efficient across three key axes: data, inference cost, and trainable parameters. We also theoretically prove that ReasonCACHE can be strictly more expressive than low-rank weight update since the latter ties expressivity to input rank, whereas ReasonCACHE bypasses this constraint by directly injecting key-values into the attention mechanism. Together, our findings identify ReasonCACHE as a middle path between in-context and in-weight learning, providing a scalable algorithm for learning reasoning skills beyond the context window without modifying parameters.

In this work, we apply the field-level inference algorithm BORG to the Quaia catalogues to reconstruct the initial conditions and present-day matter distribution of the Universe. We employ a physics-based forward model of large-scale structure using Lagrangian perturbation theory, incorporating light-cone effects, redshift-space distortions, quasar bias, and survey selection effects. This approach enables a detailed and physically motivated inference of the three-dimensional density field and initial conditions over the entire cosmic volume considered. We analyse both the G < 20.0 (Quaia Clean) and G < 20.5 (Quaia Deep) samples, where G denotes the Gaia broad optical-band magnitude, imposing conservative sky cuts to ensure robustness against foreground contamination. The resulting reconstructions span a comoving volume of (10h^{-1} Gpc)^3 with a maximum spatial resolution of 39.1 h^{-1}Mpc, making this the largest field-level reconstruction of the observable Universe in terms of comoving volume to date. We validate our reconstructions through a range of internal and external consistency checks, including the cross-correlation of the inferred density fields with Planck CMB lensing, where we detect a signal at ~4σsignificance. Beyond delivering high-fidelity data products, including posterior maps of initial conditions, present-day dark matter, and velocity fields, this work establishes a framework for exploiting quasar surveys in field-level cosmology.",

The achievement of HunyuanImage 3.0 relies on several key components, including meticulous data curation, advanced architecture design, a native Chain-of-Thoughts schema, progressive model pre-training, aggressive model post-training, and an efficient infrastructure that enables large-scale training and inference. With these advancements, we successfully trained a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model comprising over 80 billion parameters in total, with 13 billion parameters activated per token during inference, making it the largest and most powerful open-source image generative model to date. We conducted extensive experiments and the results of automatic and human evaluation of text-image alignment and visual quality demonstrate that HunyuanImage 3.0 rivals previous state-of-the-art models. By releasing the code and weights of HunyuanImage 3.0, we aim to enable the community to explore new ideas with a state-of-the-art foundation model, fostering a dynamic and vibrant multimodal ecosystem.

In this work, we present a unified view that frames these interventions as dynamic weight updates induced by a control signal, placing them within a single conceptual framework. Building on this view, we propose a unified preference-utility analysis that separates control effects into preference, defined as the tendency toward a target concept, and utility, defined as coherent and task-valid generation, and measures both on a shared log-odds scale using polarity-paired contrastive examples. Across methods, we observe a consistent trade-off between preference and utility: stronger control increases preference while predictably reducing utility. We further explain this behavior through an activation manifold perspective, in which control shifts representations along target-concept directions to enhance preference, while utility declines primarily when interventions push representations off the model's valid-generation manifold. Finally, we introduce a new steering approach SPLIT guided by this analysis that improves preference while better preserving utility.

ATLAS reduces the number of required items by up to 90% while maintaining measurement precision. For instance, it matches whole-bank ability estimates using only 41 items (0.157 MAE) on HellaSwag (5,600 items). We further reconstruct accuracy from ATLAS's ability estimates and find that reconstructed accuracies closely match raw accuracies across all five benchmarks, indicating that ability $θ$ preserves the global performance structure. At the same time, $θ$ provides finer discrimination within accuracy-equivalent models: among more than 3,000 evaluated models, 23-31% shift by more than 10 rank positions, and models with identical accuracies receive meaningfully different ability estimates.

This design is misaligned with generative recommendation objectives: semantic embeddings are weakly coupled with collaborative prediction, and generic quantization is inefficient at reducing sequential uncertainty for autoregressive modeling. To address these, we propose ReSID, a recommendation-native, principled SID framework that rethinks representation learning and quantization from the perspective of information preservation and sequential predictability, without relying on LLMs. ReSID consists of two components: (i) Field-Aware Masked Auto-Encoding (FAMAE), which learns predictive-sufficient item representations from structured features, and (ii) Globally Aligned Orthogonal Quantization (GAOQ), which produces compact and predictable SID sequences by jointly reducing semantic ambiguity and prefix-conditional uncertainty. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments across ten datasets show the effectiveness of ReSID. ReSID consistently outperforms strong sequential and SID-based generative baselines by an average of over 10%, while reducing tokenization cost by up to 122x.

Exactly solving this problem is computationally infeasible due to its combinatorial nature and the size of the search space, and existing approaches rely on approximations or heuristics. We demonstrate that the mask selection problem can be made drastically more tractable at LLM scale. To that end, we decouple the rows by enforcing equal sparsity levels per row.

Based on this hypothesis, we propose language vectors -- a training-free language steering approach that leverages activation differences between source and target languages to guide model behavior. We steer the model generations by adding the vector to the intermediate model activations during inference. This is done to make the model's internal representations shift towards the target language space without any parameter updates. We evaluate our method across three datasets and test on a total of 19 languages on three different models. Our results show consistent improvements on multilingual in-context learning over baselines across all tasks and languages tested. Beyond performance gains, hierarchical clustering of steering vectors reveals meaningful linguistic structure aligned with language families. These vectors also successfully transfer across tasks, demonstrating that these representations are task-agnostic.",

The main obstacle is that classical neighborhood smoothers select data-driven neighborhoods and average edges using the same adjacency matrix, inducing complex dependencies that invalidate standard concentration and normal approximation arguments.\n  We introduce a leave-one-out modification of neighborhood smoothing for undirected simple graphs. When estimating a single entry P_ij, the neighborhood of node i is constructed from an adjacency matrix in which the jth row and column are set to zero, thereby decoupling neighborhood selection from the edges being averaged. We show that this construction restores conditional independence of the centered summands, enabling the use of classical probabilistic tools for inference.\n  Under piecewise Lipschitz graphon assumptions and logarithmic degree growth, we derive variance-adaptive concentration inequalities based on Bousquet's inequality and establish Berry-Esseen bounds with explicit rates for the normalized estimation error. These results yield both finite-sample and asymptotic confidence intervals for individual edge probabilities. The same leave-one-out structure also supports an honest cross-validation scheme for tuning parameter selection, for which we prove an oracle inequality. The proposed estimator retains the optimal row-wise mean-squared error rates of classical neighborhood smoothing while providing valid entrywise uncertainty quantification.",

In particular, our method incorporates two key innovations: (1) a Multi-level Consistent Knowledge Distillation strategy, which transfers hierarchical representations from large teacher models to lightweight students through coordinated alignment across four levels, including encoder-level feature alignment, query-level feature matching, prior-level spatial guidance, and anchor-level high-confidence knowledge transfer and (2) a Teacher-Guided Initialization policy, employing optimized parameter warm-up to accelerate model convergence. Validated on the Occ-Scannet benchmark, DiScene achieves 23.2 FPS without depth priors while outperforming our baseline method, OPUS, by 36.1% and even better than the depth-enhanced version, OPUS†. With depth integration, DiScene† attains new SOTA performance, surpassing EmbodiedOcc by 3.7% with 1.62$\\times$ faster inference speed.

Existing interpretability approaches targeting reasoning either identify components (e.g., neurons) correlated with special textual patterns, or rely on human-annotated contrastive pairs to derive control vectors. Consequently, current methods struggle to precisely localize complex reasoning mechanisms or capture sequential influence from model internal workings to the reasoning outputs. In this paper, built on outcome-oriented and sequential-influence-aware principles, we focus on identifying components that have sequential contribution to reasoning behavior where outcomes are cumulated by long-range effects. We propose Integrated Policy Gradient (IPG), a novel framework that attributes reasoning behaviors to model's inner components by propagating compound outcome-based signals such as post reasoning accuracy backward through model inference trajectories. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our approach achieves more precise localization and enables reliable modulation of reasoning behaviors (e.g., reasoning capability, reasoning strength) across diverse reasoning models.",

This paper introduces Sequential Tool Attack Chaining (STAC), a novel multi-turn attack framework that exploits agent tool use. STAC chains together tool calls that each appear harmless in isolation but, when combined, collectively enable harmful operations that only become apparent at the final execution step. We apply our framework to automatically generate and systematically evaluate 483 STAC cases, featuring 1,352 sets of user-agent-environment interactions and spanning diverse domains, tasks, agent types, and 10 failure modes. Our evaluations show that state-of-the-art LLM agents, including GPT-4.1, are highly vulnerable to STAC, with attack success rates (ASR) exceeding 90% in most cases. The core design of STAC's automated framework is a closed-loop pipeline that synthesizes executable multi-step tool chains, validates them through in-environment execution, and reverse-engineers stealthy multi-turn prompts that reliably induce agents to execute the verified malicious sequence. We further perform defense analysis against STAC and find that existing prompt-based defenses provide limited protection. To address this gap, we propose a new reasoning-driven defense prompt that achieves far stronger protection, cutting ASR by up to 28.8%. These results highlight a crucial gap: defending tool-enabled agents requires reasoning over entire action sequences and their cumulative effects, rather than evaluating isolated prompts or responses.",

While drift-diffusion (DD) modelling is a reliable method, its mathematical complexity makes directly extracting physical parameters from experimental data infeasible. This work uses DD modelling to generate a large synthetic dataset of impedance spectra for a standard TiO2/MAPI/spiro configuration. This dataset trains machine learning (ML) models to predict recombination and ionic parameters from impedance measurements.

While drift-diffusion (DD) modelling is a reliable method, its mathematical complexity makes directly extracting physical parameters from experimental data infeasible. This work uses DD modelling to generate a large synthetic dataset of impedance spectra for a standard TiO2/MAPI/spiro configuration. This dataset trains machine learning (ML) models to predict recombination and ionic parameters from impedance measurements.

In recent years, large language model (LLM)-based specification generation approaches have emerged, offering a new direction for improving the universality of automated specification synthesis. However, when dealing with complex control flow, LLMs often struggle to precisely generate complete specifications that cover substructures. Moreover, the distinctive verification pipelines adopted by existing approaches may incorrectly discard logically correct specifications, while verification tools alone cannot reliably identify correct specifications. To address these issues, we propose SLD-Spec, an LLM-based specification generation method that combines program slicing and logical deletion. Specifically, SLD-Spec augments the conventional specification generation framework with two key stages: (1) a program slicing stage that decomposes the target function into several smaller code slices, enabling LLMs to focus on more localized semantic structures and thereby improving specification relevance and completeness; and (2) a logical deletion stage that leverages LLMs to perform logical reasoning and filtering over candidate specifications so as to retain logically correct ones. Experimental results show that SLD-Spec consistently outperforms existing methods on datasets containing programs of varying complexity, verifying more programs and generating specifications that are more relevant and more complete. Further ablation studies indicate that program slicing mainly improves specification relevance and completeness, whereas logical deletion plays a key role in increasing verification success rates.",

The design introduces no temporal buffers or auxiliary exits and preserves state-free inference, while increasing deployment footprint by only a few tens of kilobytes. Across vision and audio backbones, SNAP-UQ reduces flash and latency relative to early-exit and deep-ensemble baselines (typically $\\sim$40--60% smaller and $\\sim$25--35% faster), with several competing methods at similar accuracy often exceeding MCU memory limits. On corrupted streams, it improves accuracy-drop event detection by multiple AUPRC points and maintains strong failure detection (AUROC $\\approx 0.9$) in a single forward pass. By grounding uncertainty in layer-to-layer dynamics rather than solely in output confidence, SNAP-UQ offers a novel, resource-efficient basis for robust TinyML monitoring.",

Towards cognitive simulation in LLM role-play, previous efforts mainly suffer from two deficiencies: data with high-quality reasoning traces, and reliable reward signals aligned with human preferences. In this paper, we propose HER, a unified framework for cognitive-level persona simulation.

To bridge these gaps, we curate reasoning-augmented role-playing data via reverse engineering and construct human-aligned principles and reward models. Leveraging these resources, we train HER models based on Qwen3-32B via supervised and reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach. Notably, our models significantly outperform the Qwen3-32B baseline, achieving a 30.26 improvement on the CoSER benchmark and a 14.97 gain on the Minimax Role-Play Bench.

Training such classifiers poses a surprising challenge: they can take shortcuts by detecting linguistic traces in the cross-attention maps, rather than learning true spatial patterns. We solve this by augmenting our training data with samples generated using prompts with incorrect relation words, which encourages the classifier to avoid linguistic shortcuts and learn spatial patterns from the attention maps.

However, their sophisticated capabilities also introduce severe safety concerns, particularly the generation of harmful content through jailbreak attacks. Current safety testing for LLMs often relies on static datasets and lacks systematic criteria to evaluate the quality and adequacy of these tests. While coverage criteria have been effective for smaller neural networks, they are not directly applicable to LLMs due to scalability issues and differing objectives. To address these challenges, this paper introduces RACA, a novel set of coverage criteria specifically designed for LLM safety testing. RACA leverages representation engineering to focus on safety-critical concepts within LLMs, thereby reducing dimensionality and filtering out irrelevant information. The framework operates in three stages: first, it identifies safety-critical representations using a small, expert-curated calibration set of jailbreak prompts. Second, it calculates conceptual activation scores for a given test suite based on these representations. Finally, it computes coverage results using six sub-criteria that assess both individual and compositional safety concepts. We conduct comprehensive experiments to validate RACA's effectiveness, applicability, and generalization, where the results demonstrate that RACA successfully identifies high-quality jailbreak prompts and is superior to traditional neuron-level criteria. We also showcase its practical application in real-world scenarios, such as test set prioritization and attack prompt sampling. Furthermore, our findings confirm RACA's generalization to various scenarios and its robustness across various configurations. Overall, RACA provides a new framework for evaluating the safety of LLMs, contributing a valuable technique to the field of testing for AI.",

This approach requires the confounder interactions and their functional relationships with disease risk to be specified in advance, rather than being learned from the data. Therefore, this paper proposes the SPAR-Forest-ERF algorithm, which is the first fusion of random forests for capturing non-linear and interacting confounder-response effects with Bayesian spatial autocorrelation models that can estimate interpretable exposure response functions (ERF) with full uncertainty quantification. Methodologically, we extend existing methods set in a prediction context by propagating uncertainty between both the ML and statistical models, developing a new stopping criteria designed to ensure the stability of the primary inferential target, and incorporating a range of different ERFs for maximum model flexibility.

Network Traffic Matrix (TM), which characterizes flow volumes between nodes, is a fundamental signal for proactive traffic engineering. However, accurate TM forecasting remains challenging due to the stochastic, non-linear, and bursty nature of network dynamics. Existing discriminative models often suffer from over-smoothing and provide limited uncertainty awareness, leading to poor fidelity under extreme bursts. To address these limitations, we propose LEAD, a Large Language Model (LLM)-Enhanced Adapter-based conditional Diffusion model. First, LEAD adopts a \"Traffic-to-Image\" paradigm to transform traffic matrices into RGB images, enabling global dependency modeling via vision backbones. Then, we design a \"Frozen LLM with Trainable Adapter\" model, which efficiently captures temporal semantics with limited computational cost. Moreover, we propose a Dual-Conditioning Strategy to precisely guide a diffusion model to generate complex, dynamic network traffic matrices. Experiments on the Abilene and GEANT datasets demonstrate that LEAD outperforms all baselines. On the Abilene dataset, LEAD attains a remarkable 45.2% reduction in RMSE against the best baseline, with the error margin rising only marginally from 0.1098 at one-step to 0.1134 at 20-step predictions. Meanwhile, on the GEANT dataset, LEAD achieves a 0.0258 RMSE at 20-step prediction horizon which is 27.3% lower than the best baseline.",

To address this, we present TriSense, a triple-modality large language model designed for holistic video temporal understanding through the integration of visual, audio, and speech modalities. Central to TriSense is a Query-Based Connector that adaptively reweights modality contributions based on the input query, enabling robust performance under modality dropout and allowing flexible combinations of available inputs. To support TriSense's multimodal capabilities, we introduce TriSense-2M, a high-quality dataset of over 2 million curated samples generated via an automated pipeline powered by fine-tuned LLMs. TriSense-2M includes long-form videos and diverse modality combinations, facilitating broad generalization. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of TriSense and its potential to advance multimodal video analysis. Code and dataset will be publicly released.",

In this paper, we study nonparametric inference with an IV under a separable binary treatment choice model, which posits that the odds of the probability of taking the treatment, conditional on the instrument and the treatment-free potential outcome, factor into separable components for each variable. While nonparametric identification of smooth functionals of the treatment-free potential outcome among the treated, such as the average treatment effect on the treated, has been established under this model, corresponding nonparametric efficient estimation has proven elusive due to variationally dependent nuisance parameters defined in terms of counterfactual quantities. To address this challenge, we introduce a new variationally independent parameterization based on nuisance functions defined directly from the observed data. This parameterization, coupled with a novel fixed-point argument, enables the use of modern machine learning methods for nuisance function estimation. We characterize the semiparametric efficiency bound for any smooth functional of the treatment-free potential outcome among the treated and construct a corresponding semiparametric efficient estimator without imposing any unnecessary restriction on nuisance functions. Furthermore, we describe a straightforward generative model justifying our identifying assumptions and characterize empirically falsifiable implications of the framework to evaluate our assumptions in practical settings.

To drive the research towards better coding agents, we require challenging benchmarks that can rigorously evaluate the ability of such agents to perform various software engineering tasks. However, popular coding benchmarks such as HumanEval and SWE-Bench focus on narrowly scoped tasks such as competition programming and patch generation. In reality, software engineers have to handle a broader set of tasks for real-world software development. To address this gap, we propose OmniCode, a novel software engineering benchmark that contains a broader and more diverse set of task categories beyond code or patch generation. Overall, OmniCode contains 1794 tasks spanning three programming languages (Python, Java, and C++) and four key categories: bug fixing, test generation, code review fixing, and style fixing. In contrast to prior software engineering benchmarks, the tasks in OmniCode are (1) manually validated to eliminate ill-defined problems, and (2) synthetically crafted or recently curated to avoid data leakage issues, presenting a new framework for synthetically generating diverse software tasks from limited real-world data. We evaluate OmniCode with popular agent frameworks such as SWE-Agent and show that while they may perform well on bug fixing for Python, they fall short on tasks such as Test Generation and in languages such as C++ and Java. For instance, SWE-Agent achieves a maximum of 20.9% with DeepSeek-V3.1 on Java Test Generation tasks. OmniCode aims to serve as a robust benchmark and spur the development of agents that can perform well across different aspects of software development.

Recently proposed efficient ensemble approaches reach the performance of the traditional deep ensembles with significantly lower costs. However, the training resources required by these approaches are still at least the same as training a single dense model. In this work, we draw a unique connection between sparse neural network training and deep ensembles, yielding a novel efficient ensemble learning framework called FreeTickets. Instead of training multiple dense networks and averaging them, we directly train sparse subnetworks from scratch and extract diverse yet accurate subnetworks during this efficient, sparse-to-sparse training. Our framework, FreeTickets, is defined as the ensemble of these relatively cheap sparse subnetworks. Despite being an ensemble method, FreeTickets has even fewer parameters and training FLOPs than a single dense model. This seemingly counter-intuitive outcome is due to the ultra training/inference efficiency of dynamic sparse training. FreeTickets surpasses the dense baseline in all the following criteria: prediction accuracy, uncertainty estimation, out-of-distribution (OoD) robustness, as well as efficiency for both training and inference. Impressively, FreeTickets outperforms the naive deep ensemble with ResNet50 on ImageNet using around only 1/5 of the training FLOPs required by the latter.

In this article, we propose a semiparametric framework for causal inference with derived outcomes obtained after intra-subject processing. This framework applies to settings with a modular structure, where intra-subject analyses are conducted independently across subjects and are followed by inter-subject analyses based on parameters from the intra-subject stage. We develop multiply robust estimators of causal parameters under rate conditions on both intra-subject and inter-subject models, which allows the use of flexible machine learning. We specialize the framework to a mediation setting and focus on the natural direct effect. For high dimensional inference, we employ a step-down procedure that controls the exceedance rate of the false discovery proportion. Simulation studies demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed approach.

Moreover, our theory-motivated automatic environment adaptation improves training for both the reward and policy models by leveraging critic feedback from each, enabling learning from experience.

Textual feedback is a natural mode of human interaction and is already abundant in many real-world settings, where users, annotators, and automated judges routinely critique LLM outputs. Towards leveraging text feedback at scale, we formalize a multi-turn RL setup, RL from Text Feedback (RLTF), where text feedback is available during training but not at inference. Therefore, models must learn to internalize the feedback in order to improve their test-time single-turn performance. To do this, we propose two methods: Self Distillation (RLTF-SD), which trains the single-turn policy to match its own feedback-conditioned second-turn generations; and Feedback Modeling (RLTF-FM), which predicts the feedback as an auxiliary objective. We provide theoretical analysis on both methods, and empirically evaluate on reasoning puzzles, competition math, and creative writing tasks. Our results show that both methods consistently outperform strong baselines across benchmarks, highlighting the potential of RL with an additional source of rich supervision at scale.",

Addressing this, we propose Rank-Surprisal Ratio (RSR), a simple metric that captures both alignment and informativeness to assess the suitability of a reasoning trajectory. RSR is motivated by the observation that effective trajectories typically balance learning signal strength and behavioral alignment by combining low absolute probability with relatively high-ranked tokens under the student model. Concretely, RSR is defined as the ratio of a trajectory's average token-wise rank to its average negative log-likelihood, and is straightforward to compute and interpret. Across five student models and reasoning trajectories from 11 diverse teachers, RSR strongly correlates with post-training reasoning performance (average Spearman 0.86), consistently outperforming existing metrics. We further demonstrate its practical utility in both trajectory selection and teacher selection.",

Each trajectory is annotated with a critical failure step and a category from a grounded-theory derived, cross-domain failure taxonomy. To mitigate the human cost of failure attribution, we present AGENTRX, an automated domain-agnostic diagnostic framework that pinpoints the critical failure step in a failed agent trajectory. It synthesizes constraints, evaluates them step-by-step, and produces an auditable validation log of constraint violations with associated evidence; an LLM-based judge uses this log to localize the critical step and category.

Extensive prior research suggests that this failure is an inherent, fundamental limit of autoregressive causal LLMs, indicating that these models tend to memorize factual-level knowledge rather than capture higher-level rules. In this paper, we challenge this view by showing that this seemingly fundamental limit can be mitigated by slightly tweaking the training data with a simple regularization data recipe called the Identity Bridge of the form \"$A \\to A$\" (e.g., The name of Alice is Alice). Theoretically, we prove that under this recipe, even a one-layer transformer can break the reversal curse by analyzing the implicit bias of gradient descent. Empirically, we show that a 1B pretrained language model finetuned with the proposed data recipe achieves a 40% success rate on reversal tasks, in stark contrast to a near-zero success rate when trained solely on forward-knowledge data. Our work provides a novel theoretical foundation for the reversal curse and offers a principled, low-cost path to encouraging LLMs to learn higher-level rules from data.",

In this work, we propose an enhanced hierarchical 3D scene graph that integrates open-vocabulary features across multiple abstraction levels and supports object-relational reasoning. Our approach leverages a Vision Language Model (VLM) to infer semantic relationships. Notably, we introduce a task reasoning module that combines Large Language Models (LLM) and a VLM to interpret the scene graph's semantic and relational information, enabling agents to reason about tasks and interact with their environment more intelligently.

We empirically characterize fine-grained MoE routing and uncover an informative pattern: router scores exhibit a certain head of high-confidence experts followed by an uncertain tail of low-confidence candidates. While single-run greedy accuracy remains stable when fewer experts are activated, multi-sample pass@n degrades significantly-suggesting that the certain head governs core reasoning capability while the uncertain tail correlates with reasoning diversity.

We present NeuEdge, a framework that combines adaptive SNN models with hardware-aware optimization for edge deployment. NeuEdge uses a temporal coding scheme that blends rate and spike-timing patterns to reduce spike activity while preserving accuracy, and a hardware-aware training procedure that co-optimizes network structure and on-chip placement to improve utilization on neuromorphic processors. An adaptive threshold mechanism adjusts neuron excitability from input statistics, reducing energy consumption without degrading performance. Across standard vision and audio benchmarks, NeuEdge achieves 91-96% accuracy with up to 2.3 ms inference latency on edge hardware and an estimated 847 GOp/s/W energy efficiency. A case study on an autonomous-drone workload shows up to 312x energy savings relative to conventional deep neural networks while maintaining real-time operation.",

                "summary": "Designing effective reward functions remains a major challenge in reinforcement learning (RL), often requiring considerable human expertise and iterative refinement. Recent advances leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated reward design, but these approaches are limited by hallucinations, reliance on human feedback, and challenges with handling complex, multi-step tasks. In this work, we introduce Reward Evolution with Graph-of-Thoughts (RE-GoT), a novel bi-level framework that enhances LLMs with structured graph-based reasoning and integrates Visual Language Models (VLMs) for automated rollout evaluation. RE-GoT first decomposes tasks into text-attributed graphs, enabling comprehensive analysis and reward function generation, and then iteratively refines rewards using visual feedback from VLMs without human intervention. Extensive experiments on 10 RoboGen and 4 ManiSkill2 tasks demonstrate that RE-GoT consistently outperforms existing LLM-based baselines. On RoboGen, our method improves average task success rates by 32.25%, with notable gains on complex multi-step tasks. On ManiSkill2, RE-GoT achieves an average success rate of 93.73% across four diverse manipulation tasks, significantly surpassing prior LLM-based approaches and even exceeding expert-designed rewards. Our results indicate that combining LLMs and VLMs with graph-of-thoughts reasoning provides a scalable and effective solution for autonomous reward evolution in RL.",

Motivated by how the human brain monitors errors at discrete decision points and resamples alternatives, we introduce Iterative Correction Sampling of Thoughts (Thought-ICS), a self-correction framework. Thought-ICS iteratively prompts the model to generate reasoning one discrete and complete thought at a time--where each thought represents a deliberate decision by the model--creating natural boundaries for precise error localization. Upon verification, the model localizes the first erroneous step, and the system backtracks to generate alternative reasoning from the last correct point. When asked to correct reasoning verified as incorrect by an oracle, Thought-ICS achieves 20-40% self-correction lift.

These findings raise important questions about the design of more reliable LLM-as-a-judge evaluation settings.

In this paper, we introduce Catalyst, a post-hoc framework that exploits these under-explored signals. Catalyst computes an input-dependent scaling factor ($γ$) on-the-fly from these raw statistics (e.g., mean, standard deviation, and maximum activation). This $γ$ is then fused with the existing baseline score, multiplicatively modulating it -- an ``elastic scaling'' -- to push the ID and OOD distributions further apart. We demonstrate Catalyst is a generalizable framework: it seamlessly integrates with logit-based methods (e.g., Energy, ReAct, SCALE) and also provides a significant boost to distance-based detectors like KNN. As a result, Catalyst achieves substantial and consistent performance gains, reducing the average False Positive Rate by 32.87 on CIFAR-10 (ResNet-18), 27.94% on CIFAR-100 (ResNet-18), and 22.25% on ImageNet (ResNet-50).

EUGens leverage random features to approximate standard FFLs and go beyond them by incorporating a direct dependence on the input norms in their computations. The proposed layers unify existing efficient FFL extensions and improve efficiency by reducing inference complexity from quadratic to linear time. They also lead to \\textbf{the first} unbiased algorithms approximating FFLs with arbitrary polynomial activation functions. Furthermore, EuGens reduce the parameter count and computational overhead while preserving the expressive power and adaptability of FFLs. We also present a layer-wise knowledge transfer technique that bypasses backpropagation, enabling efficient adaptation of EUGens to pre-trained models. Empirically, we observe that integrating EUGens into Transformers and MLPs yields substantial improvements in inference speed (up to \\textbf{27}\\%) and memory efficiency (up to \\textbf{30}\\%) across a range of tasks, including image classification, language model pre-training, and 3D scene reconstruction. Overall, our results highlight the potential of EUGens for the scalable deployment of large-scale neural networks in real-world scenarios.",

The proposed layers unify existing efficient FFL extensions and improve efficiency by reducing inference complexity from quadratic to linear time. They also lead to \\textbf{the first} unbiased algorithms approximating FFLs with arbitrary polynomial activation functions. Furthermore, EuGens reduce the parameter count and computational overhead while preserving the expressive power and adaptability of FFLs. We also present a layer-wise knowledge transfer technique that bypasses backpropagation, enabling efficient adaptation of EUGens to pre-trained models. Empirically, we observe that integrating EUGens into Transformers and MLPs yields substantial improvements in inference speed (up to \\textbf{27}\\%) and memory efficiency (up to \\textbf{30}\\%) across a range of tasks, including image classification, language model pre-training, and 3D scene reconstruction. Overall, our results highlight the potential of EUGens for the scalable deployment of large-scale neural networks in real-world scenarios."

This paper introduces Long Input Fine-Tuning (LIFT), a novel framework for long-context modeling that can enhance the long-context performance of arbitrary short-context LLMs by dynamically adapting their parameters to the given long input. Importantly, rather than endlessly extending the context window size to accommodate increasingly longer inputs in context, LIFT stores and absorbs the long input in parameters. By fine-tuning the long input into model parameters, LIFT allows short-context LLMs to answer questions even when the required information is not provided in the context during inference, avoiding the quadratic complexity w.r.t. input length of a normal long context model. Furthermore, LIFT does not simply perform continued pretraining on new, long contexts, but leverages carefully designed LLM-generated synthetic tasks to enhance the comprehension of long contexts, moving beyond mere memorization. To accommodate the additional cost of fine-tuning, we design a highly optimized pipeline that reduces the Time to First Token (TTFT) to less than 10 seconds for 8k context.

We implement the Spectral-normalized Neural Gaussian Process (SNGP), a set of lightweight modifications that apply spectral normalization and replace the final dense layer with a Gaussian process layer to improve single-model uncertainty estimation and OOD detection. We evaluate SNGP vs. deterministic and MonteCarlo dropout on six datasets across three biomedical classification tasks: white blood cells, amyloid plaques, and colorectal histopathology. SNGP has comparable in-distribution performance while significantly improving uncertainty estimation and OOD detection. Thus, SNGP or related models offer a useful framework for uncertainty-aware classification in digital pathology, supporting safe deployment and building trust with pathologists.",

In this study, we propose an approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) to detect binary malware, specifically within JAR files, and uses LLM capabilities combined with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to identify Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) that malware may exploit. We developed a proof-of-concept tool, MalCVE, that integrates binary code decompilation, deobfuscation, LLM-based code summarization, semantic similarity search, and LLM-based CVE classification. We evaluated MalCVE using a benchmark dataset of 3,839 JAR executables. MalCVE achieved a mean malware-detection accuracy of 97%, at a fraction of the cost of commercial solutions. In particular, the results demonstrate that LLM-based code summarization enables highly accurate and explainable malware identification. MalCVE is also the first tool to associate CVEs with binary malware, achieving a recall@10 of 65%, which is comparable to studies that perform similar analyses on source code.",

ICL is strikingly sample-efficient, often learning from only a handful of demonstrations, but complex reasoning tasks typically demand many training examples to learn from. However, naively scaling ICL by adding more demonstrations breaks down at this scale: attention costs grow quadratically, performance saturates or degrades with longer contexts, and the approach remains a shallow form of learning. Due to these limitations, practitioners predominantly rely on in-weight learning (IWL) to induce reasoning. In this work, we show that by using Prefix Tuning, LLMs can learn to reason without overloading the context window and without any weight updates. We introduce $\\textbf{ReasonCACHE}$, an instantiation of this mechanism that distills demonstrations into a fixed key-value cache. Empirically, across challenging reasoning benchmarks, including GPQA-Diamond, ReasonCACHE outperforms standard ICL and matches or surpasses IWL approaches. Further, it achieves this all while being more efficient across three key axes: data, inference cost, and trainable parameters. We also theoretically prove that ReasonCACHE can be strictly more expressive than low-rank weight update since the latter ties expressivity to input rank, whereas ReasonCACHE bypasses this constraint by directly injecting key-values into the attention mechanism. Together, our findings identify ReasonCACHE as a middle path between in-context and in-weight learning, providing a scalable algorithm for learning reasoning skills beyond the context window without modifying parameters.

We also theoretically prove that ReasonCACHE can be strictly more expressive than low-rank weight update since the latter ties expressivity to input rank, whereas ReasonCACHE bypasses this constraint by directly injecting key-values into the attention mechanism. Together, our findings identify ReasonCACHE as a middle path between in-context and in-weight learning, providing a scalable algorithm for learning reasoning skills beyond the context window without modifying parameters.

In this work, we present a unified view that frames these interventions as dynamic weight updates induced by a control signal, placing them within a single conceptual framework. Building on this view, we propose a unified preference-utility analysis that separates control effects into preference, defined as the tendency toward a target concept, and utility, defined as coherent and task-valid generation, and measures both on a shared log-odds scale using polarity-paired contrastive examples. Across methods, we observe a consistent trade-off between preference and utility: stronger control increases preference while predictably reducing utility. We further explain this behavior through an activation manifold perspective, in which control shifts representations along target-concept directions to enhance preference, while utility declines primarily when interventions push representations off the model's valid-generation manifold. Finally, we introduce a new steering approach SPLIT guided by this analysis that improves preference while better preserving utility.

This design is misaligned with generative recommendation objectives: semantic embeddings are weakly coupled with collaborative prediction, and generic quantization is inefficient at reducing sequential uncertainty for autoregressive modeling. To address these, we propose ReSID, a recommendation-native, principled SID framework that rethinks representation learning and quantization from the perspective of information preservation and sequential predictability, without relying on LLMs. ReSID consists of two components: (i) Field-Aware Masked Auto-Encoding (FAMAE), which learns predictive-sufficient item representations from structured features, and (ii) Globally Aligned Orthogonal Quantization (GAOQ), which produces compact and predictable SID sequences by jointly reducing semantic ambiguity and prefix-conditional uncertainty. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments across ten datasets show the effectiveness of ReSID. ReSID consistently outperforms strong sequential and SID-based generative baselines by an average of over 10%, while reducing tokenization cost by up to 122x.

Based on this hypothesis, we propose language vectors -- a training-free language steering approach that leverages activation differences between source and target languages to guide model behavior. We steer the model generations by adding the vector to the intermediate model activations during inference. This is done to make the model's internal representations shift towards the target language space without any parameter updates. We evaluate our method across three datasets and test on a total of 19 languages on three different models. Our results show consistent improvements on multilingual in-context learning over baselines across all tasks and languages tested. Beyond performance gains, hierarchical clustering of steering vectors reveals meaningful linguistic structure aligned with language families.

Consequently, current methods struggle to precisely localize complex reasoning mechanisms or capture sequential influence from model internal workings to the reasoning outputs. In this paper, built on outcome-oriented and sequential-influence-aware principles, we focus on identifying components that have sequential contribution to reasoning behavior where outcomes are cumulated by long-range effects. We propose Integrated Policy Gradient (IPG), a novel framework that attributes reasoning behaviors to model's inner components by propagating compound outcome-based signals such as post reasoning accuracy backward through model inference trajectories. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our approach achieves more precise localization and enables reliable modulation of reasoning behaviors (e.g., reasoning capability, reasoning strength) across diverse reasoning models.",

This paper introduces Sequential Tool Attack Chaining (STAC), a novel multi-turn attack framework that exploits agent tool use. STAC chains together tool calls that each appear harmless in isolation but, when combined, collectively enable harmful operations that only become apparent at the final execution step. We apply our framework to automatically generate and systematically evaluate 483 STAC cases, featuring 1,352 sets of user-agent-environment interactions and spanning diverse domains, tasks, agent types, and 10 failure modes. Our evaluations show that state-of-the-art LLM agents, including GPT-4.1, are highly vulnerable to STAC, with attack success rates (ASR) exceeding 90% in most cases. The core design of STAC's automated framework is a closed-loop pipeline that synthesizes executable multi-step tool chains, validates them through in-environment execution, and reverse-engineers stealthy multi-turn prompts that reliably induce agents to execute the verified malicious sequence. We further perform defense analysis against STAC and find that existing prompt-based defenses provide limited protection. To address this gap, we propose a new reasoning-driven defense prompt that achieves far stronger protection, cutting ASR by up to 28.8%. These results highlight a crucial gap: defending tool-enabled agents requires reasoning over entire action sequences and their cumulative effects, rather than evaluating isolated prompts or responses.",

With a small set of Estonian native speaker annotations as a reference point, we find systematic ranking instabilities: surface-level metrics (lexical diversity, surface and semantic similarity) maintain cross-language stability, but pragmatic judgments (coherence, instruction-following) exhibit rank inversions and near-zero correlations. Because generation is controlled, these inconsistencies reflect how judge scoring behaves differently across languages rather than true model differences.\n  This controlled design provides a diagnostic probe: evaluation methods that fail to maintain stability under identical generation conditions signal transfer failure before deployment.

In recent years, large language model (LLM)-based specification generation approaches have emerged, offering a new direction for improving the universality of automated specification synthesis. However, when dealing with complex control flow, LLMs often struggle to precisely generate complete specifications that cover substructures. Moreover, the distinctive verification pipelines adopted by existing approaches may incorrectly discard logically correct specifications, while verification tools alone cannot reliably identify correct specifications. To address these issues, we propose SLD-Spec, an LLM-based specification generation method that combines program slicing and logical deletion. Specifically, SLD-Spec augments the conventional specification generation framework with two key stages: (1) a program slicing stage that decomposes the target function into several smaller code slices, enabling LLMs to focus on more localized semantic structures and thereby improving specification relevance and completeness; and (2) a logical deletion stage that leverages LLMs to perform logical reasoning and filtering over candidate specifications so as to retain logically correct ones. Experimental results show that SLD-Spec consistently outperforms existing methods on datasets containing programs of varying complexity, verifying more programs and generating specifications that are more relevant and more complete. Further ablation studies indicate that program slicing mainly improves specification relevance and completeness, whereas logical deletion plays a key role in increasing verification success rates.",

Using four flagship models (GPT-4o, Claude 3, DeepSeek, and LLaMA 3), we generate and automatically classify over 100,000 responses. Results show that all models reproduce entrenched stereotypes despite safety alignment: Arabs are overwhelmingly linked to terrorism and religion (>=95%), Africans to socioeconomic \"backwardness\" (up to <=77%), and Western groups are consistently framed as modern or progressive. Biases grow sharply in lower-resource languages, revealing that alignment trained primarily in English does not generalize globally. Our findings highlight a persistent divide in multilingual fairness: current alignment methods reduce explicit toxicity but fail to prevent biased outputs in open-ended contexts.

However, their sophisticated capabilities also introduce severe safety concerns, particularly the generation of harmful content through jailbreak attacks. Current safety testing for LLMs often relies on static datasets and lacks systematic criteria to evaluate the quality and adequacy of these tests. While coverage criteria have been effective for smaller neural networks, they are not directly applicable to LLMs due to scalability issues and differing objectives. To address these challenges, this paper introduces RACA, a novel set of coverage criteria specifically designed for LLM safety testing. RACA leverages representation engineering to focus on safety-critical concepts within LLMs, thereby reducing dimensionality and filtering out irrelevant information. The framework operates in three stages: first, it identifies safety-critical representations using a small, expert-curated calibration set of jailbreak prompts. Second, it calculates conceptual activation scores for a given test suite based on these representations. Finally, it computes coverage results using six sub-criteria that assess both individual and compositional safety concepts. We conduct comprehensive experiments to validate RACA's effectiveness, applicability, and generalization, where the results demonstrate that RACA successfully identifies high-quality jailbreak prompts and is superior to traditional neuron-level criteria. We also showcase its practical application in real-world scenarios, such as test set prioritization and attack prompt sampling. Furthermore, our findings confirm RACA's generalization to various scenarios and its robustness across various configurations. Overall, RACA provides a new framework for evaluating the safety of LLMs, contributing a valuable technique to the field of testing for AI.",

Network Traffic Matrix (TM), which characterizes flow volumes between nodes, is a fundamental signal for proactive traffic engineering. However, accurate TM forecasting remains challenging due to the stochastic, non-linear, and bursty nature of network dynamics. Existing discriminative models often suffer from over-smoothing and provide limited uncertainty awareness, leading to poor fidelity under extreme bursts. To address these limitations, we propose LEAD, a Large Language Model (LLM)-Enhanced Adapter-based conditional Diffusion model. First, LEAD adopts a \"Traffic-to-Image\" paradigm to transform traffic matrices into RGB images, enabling global dependency modeling via vision backbones. Then, we design a \"Frozen LLM with Trainable Adapter\" model, which efficiently captures temporal semantics with limited computational cost. Moreover, we propose a Dual-Conditioning Strategy to precisely guide a diffusion model to generate complex, dynamic network traffic matrices. Experiments on the Abilene and GEANT datasets demonstrate that LEAD outperforms all baselines. On the Abilene dataset, LEAD attains a remarkable 45.2% reduction in RMSE against the best baseline, with the error margin rising only marginally from 0.1098 at one-step to 0.1134 at 20-step predictions.

Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of TriSense and its potential to advance multimodal video analysis. Code and dataset will be publicly released.",

We evaluate OmniCode with popular agent frameworks such as SWE-Agent and show that while they may perform well on bug fixing for Python, they fall short on tasks such as Test Generation and in languages such as C++ and Java. For instance, SWE-Agent achieves a maximum of 20.9% with DeepSeek-V3.1 on Java Test Generation tasks.

However, most research in this field relies on simulations or limited on-device testing, which makes the real-world reliability of proposed schemes difficult to assess. We systematically reviewed 31 acoustic communication studies for commodity devices and found that none provided accessible source code. After contacting authors and re-implementing three promising schemes, we assembled a testbed of eight representative acoustic communication systems. Using over 11000 smartphone transmissions in both realistic indoor environments and an anechoic chamber, we provide a systematic and repeatable methodology for evaluating the reliability and generalizability of these schemes under real-world conditions. Our results show that many existing schemes face challenges in practical usage, largely due to severe multipath propagation indoors and varying audio characteristics across device models. To support future research and foster more robust evaluations, we release our re-implementations alongside the first comprehensive dataset of real-world acoustic transmissions. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of rigorous on-device testing and underscore the need for robust design strategies to bridge the gap between simulation results and reliable IoT deployments.",

A closer examination reveals a defining Sparsity-Event Duality (SED) property of IMTS, i.e., long stretches with sparse or no observations are punctuated by short, dense bursts where most semantic events (observations) occur. However, existing Graph- and Transformer-based forecasters ignore SED: pre-alignment to uniform grids with heavy padding violates sparsity by inflating sequences and forcing computation at non-informative steps, while relational recasting weakens event semantics by disrupting local temporal continuity.

We find that Spiking Neural Networks meet this requirement, as they communicate via sparse binary spikes and update in an event-driven manner, aligning naturally with the SED nature of IMTS. Therefore, we present SEDformer, an SED-enhanced Spiking Transformer for telemetry IMTS forecasting that couples: (1) a SED-based Spike Encoder converts raw observations into event synchronous spikes using an Event-Aligned LIF neuron, (2) an Event-Preserving Temporal Downsampling module compresses long gaps while retaining salient firings and (3) a stack of SED-based Spike Transformer blocks enable intra-series dependency modeling with a membrane-based linear attention driven by EA-LIF spiking features.

To mitigate this bias, we propose a balanced permutation strategy that evenly distributes each score option across positions. We show that aggregating scores across balanced permutations not only reveals latent position bias, but also improves correlation between the LLM-as-a-Judge and human.

                "summary": "In large language models (LLMs), each block operates on the residual stream to map input token sequences to output token distributions. However, most of the interpretability literature focuses on internal latent representations, leaving token-space dynamics underexplored. The high dimensionality and categoricity of token distributions hinder their analysis, as standard statistical descriptors are not suitable. We show that the entropy of logit-lens predictions overcomes these issues. In doing so, it provides a per-layer scalar, permutation-invariant metric. We introduce Entropy-Lens to distill the token-space dynamics of the residual stream into a low-dimensional signal. We call this signal the entropy profile. We apply our method to a variety of model sizes and families, showing that (i) entropy profiles uncover token prediction dynamics driven by expansion and pruning strategies; (ii) these dynamics are family-specific and invariant under depth rescaling; (iii) they are characteristic of task type and output format; (iv) these strategies have unequal impact on downstream performance, with the expansion strategy usually being more critical. Ultimately, our findings further enhance our understanding of the residual stream, enabling a granular assessment of how information is processed across model depth.",

Specifically, it comprises three key components, aligning the entire model training pipeline to the LLM's pre-training/post-training: (1) E-commerce Semantic Tokenizer: we provide a tokenizer solution that captures both real-world semantics and business-specific item relations across different scenarios; (2) Transformer-based Architecture: we largely utilize Transformer as our model backbone, e.g., employing Query-Former for long sequence compression, Cross-Attention for multi-behavior sequence fusion, and Sparse MoE for scalable auto-regressive generation; (3) Reinforcement Learning Pipeline: we further connect retrieval and ranking models via RL, enabling the ranking model to serve as a reward signal for end-to-end policy retrieval model optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OneMall achieves consistent improvements across all e-commerce scenarios: +13.01\\% GMV in product-card, +15.32\\% Orders in Short-Video, and +2.78\\% Orders in Live-Streaming. OneMall has been deployed, serving over 400 million daily active users at Kuaishou.",

Distributing rollout execution offers opportunities to leverage more cost-efficient inference resources, but introduces challenges in wide-area coordination and policy dissemination. We present ECHO-2, a distributed RL framework for post-training with remote inference workers and non-negligible dissemination latency. ECHO-2 combines centralized learning with distributed rollouts and treats bounded policy staleness as a user-controlled parameter, enabling rollout generation, dissemination, and training to overlap. We introduce an overlap-based capacity model that relates training time, dissemination latency, and rollout throughput, yielding a practical provisioning rule for sustaining learner utilization. To mitigate dissemination bottlenecks and lower cost, ECHO-2 employs peer-assisted pipelined broadcast and cost-aware activation of heterogeneous workers. Experiments on GRPO post-training of 4B and 8B models under real wide-area bandwidth regimes show that ECHO-2 significantly improves cost efficiency while preserving RL reward comparable to strong baselines.",

Using accuracy and macro F1, together with majority-class and chance baselines, we analyse overall performance and examine variation by linguistic domains and language-related factors. Our results show that metalinguistic knowledge in current LLMs is limited: GPT-4o performs best but achieves only moderate accuracy (0.367), while open-source models lag behind.

Performance varies across linguistic domains, with lexical features showing the highest accuracy and phonological features among the lowest, partially reflecting differences in online visibility. At the language level, accuracy shows a strong association with digital language status: languages with higher digital presence and resource availability are evaluated more accurately, while low-resource languages show substantially lower performance. Analyses of predictive factors confirm that resource-related indicators (Wikipedia size, corpus availability) are more informative predictors of accuracy than geographical, genealogical, or sociolinguistic factors. Together, these results suggest that LLMs' metalinguistic knowledge is fragmented and shaped by data availability rather than generalizable grammatical competence across the world's languages.
