However, caching all DNN models at edge servers with limited\ncapacity is difficult, and the impact of model loading time on QoE remains\nunderexplored. Hence, we introduce dynamic DNNs in edge scenarios,\ndisassembling a complete DNN model into interrelated submodels for more\nfine-grained and flexible model caching and request routing solutions. This\nraises the pressing issue of jointly deciding request routing and submodel\ncaching for dynamic DNNs to balance model inference precision and loading\nlatency for QoE optimization. In this paper, we study the joint dynamic model\ncaching and request routing problem in MEC networks, aiming to maximize user\nrequest inference precision under constraints of server resources, latency, and\nmodel loading time. To tackle this problem, we propose CoCaR, an offline\nalgorithm based on linear programming and random rounding that leverages\ndynamic DNNs to optimize caching and routing schemes, achieving near-optimal\nperformance. Furthermore, we develop an online variant of CoCaR, named\nCoCaR-OL, enabling effective adaptation to dynamic and unpredictable online\nrequest patterns. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed CoCaR\nimproves the average inference precision of user requests by 46\\% compared to\nstate-of-the-art baselines. In addition, in online scenarios, CoCaR-OL achieves\nan improvement of no less than 32.3\\% in user QoE over competitive baselines.",

                "summary": "Agentic LLM applications interleave LLM generation requests with tool calls.\nThese tool calls break the continuity of the workflow by creating pauses\nbetween LLM requests, bringing many challenges for the serving system,\nespecially under multi-turn scenarios. Each pause potentially causes KV cache\neviction and extra waiting time before entering the continuous batch for the\nfollowing LLM request. Since these pauses happen for each call, this problem\nbecomes increasingly severe as turn number grow for agentic programs. Previous\nworks either fail to incorporate information from the tool call, evicting KV\ncache that leads to repetitive prefill or loading, or ignore the continuity of\na multi-turn program, creating waiting time between turns that increases\nper-request latency.\n  We present Continuum, a serving system to optimize job completion time for\nmulti-turn agent workloads by combining tool-aware KV cache timeout with\nprogram-level scheduling. By predicting tool call durations in agentic\nworkflows, Continuum selectively pins the KV cache in GPU memory with a\ntime-to-live value based on total turn number. When combined with program-level\nfirst-come-first-serve, Continuum prevents scheduling bubbles, preserves\nmulti-turn continuity, and optimizes for throughput for complex agentic\nworkflows.

                    "value": "Agentic LLM applications interleave LLM generation requests with tool calls.\nThese tool calls break the continuity of the workflow by creating pauses\nbetween LLM requests, bringing many challenges for the serving system,\nespecially under multi-turn scenarios. Each pause potentially causes KV cache\neviction and extra waiting time before entering the continuous batch for the\nfollowing LLM request. Since these pauses happen for each call, this problem\nbecomes increasingly severe as turn number grow for agentic programs. Previous\nworks either fail to incorporate information from the tool call, evicting KV\ncache that leads to repetitive prefill or loading, or ignore the continuity of\na multi-turn program, creating waiting time between turns that increases\nper-request latency.\n  We present Continuum, a serving system to optimize job completion time for\nmulti-turn agent workloads by combining tool-aware KV cache timeout with\nprogram-level scheduling. By predicting tool call durations in agentic\nworkflows, Continuum selectively pins the KV cache in GPU memory with a\ntime-to-live value based on total turn number. When combined with program-level\nfirst-come-first-serve, Continuum prevents scheduling bubbles, preserves\nmulti-turn continuity, and optimizes for throughput for complex agentic\nworkflows.

To quantify the behavioral effects of such\ninterventions in a freely moving mouse, we developed a dual-channel magnetic\nchamber, specifically designed for rate-sensitive magnetothermal-genetic\nstimulation, and adaptable for other uses of alternating magnetic fields.\nThrough an optimized coil design, the system allows independent control of two\nspatially orthogonal uniform magnetic fields delivered at different frequencies\nwithin a 10 cm x 10 cm x 6 cm chamber. The two channels have nominal\nfrequencies of 50 and 550 kHz with peak magnetic field strengths of 88 and 12.5\nmT, achieved with resonant coil drives having peak voltages of 1.6 and 1.8 kV\nand currents of 1.0 and 0.26 kA, respectively. Additionally, a liquid cooling\nsystem enables magnetic field generation for second-level duration, and an\nobservation port and camera allow video capture of the animal's behavior within\nthe chamber. The system generates high-amplitude magnetic fields across two\nwidely separated frequency channels with negligible interference (< 1%).\nRelatively uniform magnetic field distribution (+/-10% across 94% of the\nchamber volume) is maintained throughout the chamber, and temperature increase\nof the inner side of the coil enclosure during the operation is limited to <\n0.35 {\\deg}C/s to ensure in vivo safety. Using cobalt-doped and undoped iron\noxide nanoparticles, we demonstrate channel-specific heating rates of 3.5\n{\\deg}C/s and 1.5 {\\deg}C/s, respectively, validating frequency-selectivity.\nBoth channels can run continuously for four seconds stably.",

                    "value": "Several novel methods, including magnetogenetics and magnetoelectric\nstimulation, use high frequency alternating magnetic fields to precisely\nmanipulate neural activity. To quantify the behavioral effects of such\ninterventions in a freely moving mouse, we developed a dual-channel magnetic\nchamber, specifically designed for rate-sensitive magnetothermal-genetic\nstimulation, and adaptable for other uses of alternating magnetic fields.\nThrough an optimized coil design, the system allows independent control of two\nspatially orthogonal uniform magnetic fields delivered at different frequencies\nwithin a 10 cm x 10 cm x 6 cm chamber. The two channels have nominal\nfrequencies of 50 and 550 kHz with peak magnetic field strengths of 88 and 12.5\nmT, achieved with resonant coil drives having peak voltages of 1.6 and 1.8 kV\nand currents of 1.0 and 0.26 kA, respectively. Additionally, a liquid cooling\nsystem enables magnetic field generation for second-level duration, and an\nobservation port and camera allow video capture of the animal's behavior within\nthe chamber. The system generates high-amplitude magnetic fields across two\nwidely separated frequency channels with negligible interference (< 1%).\nRelatively uniform magnetic field distribution (+/-10% across 94% of the\nchamber volume) is maintained throughout the chamber, and temperature increase\nof the inner side of the coil enclosure during the operation is limited to <\n0.35 {\\deg}C/s to ensure in vivo safety. Using cobalt-doped and undoped iron\noxide nanoparticles, we demonstrate channel-specific heating rates of 3.5\n{\\deg}C/s and 1.5 {\\deg}C/s, respectively, validating frequency-selectivity.\nBoth channels can run continuously for four seconds stably."

We identify\nthat the core challenge lies in the offset variance of KV-caches across agents.\nTo address this, we propose KVCOMM, a training-free framework that enables\nefficient prefilling in multi-agent inference by reusing KV-caches and aligning\ncache offsets of overlapping contexts under diverse prefix contexts. KVCOMM\nestimates and adjusts KV-caches for shared content by referencing a pool of\ncached examples-termed anchors-that store observed cache deviations under\nvarying prefixes.

Experimental results show that AttnCache achieves an average of\n1.2x end-to-end and 2x attention speedup on CPU, and 1.6x end-to-end and 3x\nattention speedup on GPU, with negligible accuracy degradation."

While existing caching techniques can\naccelerate inference, they often create a challenging trade-off between speed\nand fidelity, suffering from quality degradation and high computational\noverhead. To address these limitations, we introduce H2-Cache, a novel\nhierarchical caching mechanism designed for modern generative diffusion model\narchitectures. Our method is founded on the key insight that the denoising\nprocess can be functionally separated into a structure-defining stage and a\ndetail-refining stage. H2-cache leverages this by employing a dual-threshold\nsystem, using independent thresholds to selectively cache each stage. To ensure\nthe efficiency of our dual-check approach, we introduce pooled feature\nsummarization (PFS), a lightweight technique for robust and fast similarity\nestimation. Extensive experiments on the Flux architecture demonstrate that\nH2-cache achieves significant acceleration (up to 5.08x) while maintaining\nimage quality nearly identical to the baseline, quantitatively and\nqualitatively outperforming existing caching methods. Our work presents a\nrobust and practical solution that effectively resolves the speed-quality\ndilemma, significantly lowering the barrier for the real-world application of\nhigh-fidelity diffusion models.

We show that APD provides markedly higher\nthroughput with minimal quality degradations on downstream benchmarks."

To address this issue, we formulate cache scheduling as a\ndirected graph with error-weighted edges and introduce a Lexicographic Minimax\nPath Optimization strategy that explicitly bounds the worst-case path error.\nThis approach substantially improves the consistency of global content and\nstyle across generated frames. Extensive experiments on multiple text-to-video\nbenchmarks demonstrate that LeMiCa delivers dual improvements in both inference\nspeed and generation quality. Notably, our method achieves a 2.9x speedup on\nthe Latte model and reaches an LPIPS score of 0.05 on Open-Sora, outperforming\nprior caching techniques. Importantly, these gains come with minimal perceptual\nquality degradation, making LeMiCa a robust and generalizable paradigm for\naccelerating diffusion-based video generation.

Importantly, these gains come with minimal perceptual\nquality degradation, making LeMiCa a robust and generalizable paradigm for\naccelerating diffusion-based video generation. We believe this approach can\nserve as a strong foundation for future research on efficient and reliable\nvideo synthesis. Our code is available at :https://github.com/UnicomAI/LeMiCa"

The (011)\norientation of \\b{eta}-Ga2O3 enabled low background doping and thick drift\nlayers which are promising to support kV-class vertical \\b{eta}-Ga2O3 power\nswitches. The Schottky barrier engineering was performed with a composite Pt\ncap/PtOx/Pt (1.5 nm) anode contact to take advantage of the enhanced reverse\nblocking capabilities enabled by PtOx while allowing low turn-on voltage by the\ninterfacing thin Pt layer. We also performed a systematic study using a\nco-processed Pt/(011) \\b{eta}-Ga2O3 Schottky barrier diodes (SBDs) on the same\nwafer. The bare SBDs revealed a breakdown voltage of ~1.5 kV, while the\nfield-plate Pt/(011) \\b{eta}-Ga2O3 SBDs achieved an increased breakdown voltage\nof 2.75 kV owing to the edge field management. Further enhancement of the\nbreakdown voltage was achieved by tunneling leakage management using composite\nPt cap/PtOx/Pt (1.5 nm) Schottky contacts that ultimately enabled breakdown\nvoltage of 3.7 kV for the field-plate diodes. Remarkably, the Pt cap/PtOx/Pt\n(1.5 nm) Schottky contacts maintained similar turn-on voltage as the Pt/(011)\n\\b{eta}-Ga2O3 SBDs. The combination of efficient tunneling leakage management\nby composite Pt cap/PtOx/Pt (1.5 nm) contacts with similar turn-on voltage,\nedge field reduction by high-\\k{appa} dielectric ZrO2 field plate, as well as\nthe advantageous material properties offered by (011) \\b{eta}-Ga2O3 demonstrate\na promising strategy for developing ultra-low leakage and multi-kV class\nvertical (011) \\b{eta}-Ga2O3 power devices.",

                    "value": "We report over 3 kV breakdown voltage and ultra-low leakage (011)\n\\b{eta}-Ga2O3 power devices utilizing Schottky barrier engineering and\nhigh-permittivity (\\k{appa}) dielectric (ZrO2) field plate. The (011)\norientation of \\b{eta}-Ga2O3 enabled low background doping and thick drift\nlayers which are promising to support kV-class vertical \\b{eta}-Ga2O3 power\nswitches. The Schottky barrier engineering was performed with a composite Pt\ncap/PtOx/Pt (1.5 nm) anode contact to take advantage of the enhanced reverse\nblocking capabilities enabled by PtOx while allowing low turn-on voltage by the\ninterfacing thin Pt layer. We also performed a systematic study using a\nco-processed Pt/(011) \\b{eta}-Ga2O3 Schottky barrier diodes (SBDs) on the same\nwafer. The bare SBDs revealed a breakdown voltage of ~1.5 kV, while the\nfield-plate Pt/(011) \\b{eta}-Ga2O3 SBDs achieved an increased breakdown voltage\nof 2.75 kV owing to the edge field management. Further enhancement of the\nbreakdown voltage was achieved by tunneling leakage management using composite\nPt cap/PtOx/Pt (1.5 nm) Schottky contacts that ultimately enabled breakdown\nvoltage of 3.7 kV for the field-plate diodes. Remarkably, the Pt cap/PtOx/Pt\n(1.5 nm) Schottky contacts maintained similar turn-on voltage as the Pt/(011)\n\\b{eta}-Ga2O3 SBDs. The combination of efficient tunneling leakage management\nby composite Pt cap/PtOx/Pt (1.5 nm) contacts with similar turn-on voltage,\nedge field reduction by high-\\k{appa} dielectric ZrO2 field plate, as well as\nthe advantageous material properties offered by (011) \\b{eta}-Ga2O3 demonstrate\na promising strategy for developing ultra-low leakage and multi-kV class\nvertical (011) \\b{eta}-Ga2O3 power devices."

This is accomplished in four steps:\nfirst, we identify the target object(s) in the VQA prompt; second, we compute\nan object relevance map using the key-value (KV) cache; third, we propose and\nrank relevant image regions based on the map; and finally, we perform the\nfine-grained VQA task using the top-ranked region. As a result of this informed\nsearch strategy, FOCUS achieves strong performance across four fine-grained VQA\ndatasets and three types of MLLMs. It outperforms three popular visual cropping\nmethods in both accuracy and efficiency, and matches the best-performing\nbaseline, ZoomEye, while requiring 3 - 6.5 x less compute.",

Previous research has\ndemonstrated that KV cache exhibits low-rank characteristics within the hidden\ndimension, suggesting the potential for effective compression. However, due to\nthe widely adopted Rotary Position Embedding mechanism in modern LLMs, naive\nlow-rank compression suffers severe accuracy degradation or creates a new speed\nbottleneck, as the low-rank cache must first be reconstructed in order to apply\nRoPE. In this paper, we introduce two key insights: first, the application of\nRoPE to the key vectors increases their variance, which in turn results in a\nhigher rank; second, after the key vectors are transformed into the latent\nspace, they largely maintain their representation across most layers. Based on\nthese insights, we propose the Sparse Attention in Latent Space framework. SALS\nprojects the KV cache into a compact latent space via low-rank projection, and\nperforms sparse token selection using RoPE-free query-key interactions in this\nspace. By reconstructing only a small subset of important tokens, it avoids the\noverhead of full KV cache reconstruction. We comprehensively evaluate SALS on\nvarious tasks using two large-scale models: LLaMA2-7b-chat and Mistral-7b, and\nadditionally verify its scalability on the RULER-128k benchmark with\nLLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct. Experimental results demonstrate that SALS achieves SOTA\nperformance by maintaining competitive accuracy. Under different settings, SALS\nachieves 6.4-fold KV cache compression and 5.7-fold speed-up in the attention\noperator compared to FlashAttention2 on the 4K sequence.

In addition,\nwe construct pitch-shifted pairs by translating and cropping the VQT frames and\ntrain our model with a novel class-based transposition-equivariant objective,\neliminating the need for annotated data. Thanks to this architecture and\ntraining objective, our model achieves remarkable performances while being very\nlightweight ($130$k parameters). Evaluations on music and speech datasets\n(MIR-1K, MDB-stem-synth, and PTDB) demonstrate that PESTO not only outperforms\nself-supervised baselines but also competes with supervised methods, exhibiting\nsuperior cross-dataset generalization. Finally, we enhance PESTO's practical\nutility by developing a streamable VQT implementation using cached\nconvolutions. Combined with our model's low latency (less than 10 ms) and\nminimal parameter count, this makes PESTO particularly suitable for real-time\napplications.",

By splitting each file into $F$ equal\npackets (i.e., the subpacketization level $F$) and letting each user cache a\nset of packets, the transmission load can be significantly reduced via coded\nmulticasting. It has been shown that a higher subpacketization level could\npotentially lead to a lower transmission load, as more packets can be combined\nfor efficient transmission. On the other hand, a larger $F$ indicates a higher\ncoding complexity and is problematic from a practical perspective when $F$ is\nextremely large. Despite many works attempting to design coded caching schemes\nwith low subpacketization levels, a fundamental problem remains open: What is\nthe minimum transmission load given any fixed subpacketization level? In this\npaper, we consider the classical cache-aided networks with identically uncoded\nplacement and one-shot delivery strategy, and investigate the fundamental\ntrade-off between the transmission load and the subpacketization level. We\npropose a \\emph{general} lower bound on the transmission load for any fixed\nsubpacketization by reformulating the centralized coded caching schemes via the\ncombinatorial structure of the corresponding placement delivery array. The\nlower bound also recovers existing optimality results for the bipartite graph\nscheme (including the well-known Maddah-Ali and Niesen (MN) scheme and the\nconjugate MN scheme) as well as the grouping bipartite graph scheme.\nFurthermore, by carefully exploiting the combinatorial structure and computing\nthe union size of sorted sets, we establish a new optimality result, i.e., the\npartition scheme can achieve the optimal rate-subpacketization trade-off.",

The\nlower bound also recovers existing optimality results for the bipartite graph\nscheme (including the well-known Maddah-Ali and Niesen (MN) scheme and the\nconjugate MN scheme) as well as the grouping bipartite graph scheme.\nFurthermore, by carefully exploiting the combinatorial structure and computing\nthe union size of sorted sets, we establish a new optimality result, i.e., the\npartition scheme can achieve the optimal rate-subpacketization trade-off."

Traditional\ngeneral-purpose accelerators struggle to effectively exploit fine-grain\nparallelism due to limitations in implementing convoluted data-dependency\npatterns (like SIMD) and overheads due to synchronization and data transfers\n(like GPGPUs). In contrast, custom FPGA and ASIC designs offer improved\nperformance and energy efficiency at a high cost in hardware design and\nprogramming complexity and often lack the flexibility to process different\nworkloads. We propose Squire, a general-purpose accelerator designed to exploit\nfine-grain parallelism effectively on dependency-bound kernels. Each Squire\naccelerator has a set of general-purpose low-power in-order cores that can\nrapidly communicate among themselves and directly access data from the L2\ncache. Our proposal integrates one Squire accelerator per core in a typical\nmulticore system, allowing the acceleration of dependency-bound kernels within\nparallel tasks with minimal software changes. As a case study, we evaluate\nSquire's effectiveness by accelerating five kernels that implement complex\ndependency patterns. We use three of these kernels to build an end-to-end\nread-mapping tool that will be used to evaluate Squire. Squire obtains speedups\nup to 7.64$\\times$ in dynamic programming kernels. Overall, Squire provides an\nacceleration for an end-to-end application of 3.66$\\times$. In addition, Squire\nreduces energy consumption by up to 56% with a minimal area overhead of 10.5%\ncompared to a Neoverse-N1 baseline.",

                "summary": "Transformer models have driven breakthroughs across various language tasks by\ntheir strong capability to learn rich contextual representations. Scaling them\nto improve representation, however, often demands substantial memory and\ncompute costs, such as the Key-Value (KV) cache used during auto-regressive\ndecoding. Skip connections offer a promising way to improve representation\nwithout bloating resource usage, yet most prior works either improve\nexpressivity while leaving KV costs unchanged, or reduce memory at the cost of\nweaker representation. In this work, we propose SkipV1Former, a Transformer\nvariant that uses skip connections from the first layer's Value heads to\nstrengthen model representation and reduce KV cache. Specifically, from the\nsecond block onward, each layer reuses half of its Value heads from the very\nfirst layer, while computing the other half as usual-cutting Value projections\nand V cache by nearly 50 \\%. Theoretically, we show that routing uncompressed\nfirst-layer Values into deeper layers restores information lost to compression\nand accelerates the model's implicit mesa-optimization-a key pattern of\nTransformer in auto-regressive tasks. Empirically, across different model\nscales, SkipV1Former delivers consistent reductions of approximately 25 \\% in\nKV cache while improving perplexity relative to standard Multi-Head Attention\n(MHA) Transformers and some advanced variants. Moreover, we propose a recipe\nfor uptraining existing MHA Transformer checkpoints to SkipV1Former with only\n10-15\\% additional compute. Finally, SkipV1Former can seamlessly combine\nadvanced methods like Group-Query Attention and Multi-Latent Attention to\nachieve further KV cache savings and performance improvement. When combined\nwith YOCO, it cuts KV cache size by nearly 50 \\% while still improving\nperformance.",

We trained Solly using self-play with a\nmodel-free, actor-critic, deep reinforcement learning algorithm. Solly played\nat an elite human level as measured by win rate (won over 50% of hands) and\nequity (money won) in heads-up and multi-player Liar's Poker. Solly also\noutperformed large language models (LLMs), including those with reasoning\nabilities, on the same metrics. Solly developed novel bidding strategies,\nrandomized play effectively, and was not easily exploitable by world-class\nhuman players."

Despite TLS encryption\nprotecting content, these metadata patterns leak sufficient information to\nenable topic classification. We demonstrate the attack across 28 popular LLMs\nfrom major providers, achieving near-perfect classification (often >98% AUPRC)\nand high precision even at extreme class imbalance (10,000:1 noise-to-target\nratio). For many models, we achieve 100% precision in identifying sensitive\ntopics like \"money laundering\" while recovering 5-20% of target conversations.\nThis industry-wide vulnerability poses significant risks for users under\nnetwork surveillance by ISPs, governments, or local adversaries. We evaluate\nthree mitigation strategies - random padding, token batching, and packet\ninjection - finding that while each reduces attack effectiveness, none provides\ncomplete protection.

The framework automates model-aware preprocessing, manages\narchitectural heterogeneity internally, and integrates evaluation modules for\nperformance, calibration, and fairness. Designed for extensibility and\nreproducibility, TabTune enables consistent benchmarking of adaptation\nstrategies of tabular foundation models."

Although distilled Small Language Models (SLMs) significantly\nenhance efficiency, their performance suffers as they fail to follow LLMs'\nreasoning paths. Luckily, we reveal that only a small fraction of tokens\ngenuinely diverge reasoning paths between LLMs and SLMs. Most generated tokens\nare either identical or exhibit neutral differences, such as minor variations\nin abbreviations or expressions. Leveraging this insight, we introduce **Roads\nto Rome (R2R)**, a neural token routing method that selectively utilizes LLMs\nonly for these critical, path-divergent tokens, while leaving the majority of\ntoken generation to the SLM. We also develop an automatic data generation\npipeline that identifies divergent tokens and generates token-level routing\nlabels to train the lightweight router. We apply R2R to combine R1-1.5B and\nR1-32B models from the DeepSeek family, and evaluate on challenging math,\ncoding, and QA benchmarks. With an average activated parameter size of 5.6B,\nR2R surpasses the average accuracy of R1-7B by 1.6x, outperforming even the\nR1-14B model. Compared to R1-32B, it delivers a 2.8x wall-clock speedup with\ncomparable performance, advancing the Pareto frontier of test-time scaling\nefficiency.

                    "value": "Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve impressive reasoning capabilities at the\ncost of substantial inference overhead, posing substantial deployment\nchallenges. Although distilled Small Language Models (SLMs) significantly\nenhance efficiency, their performance suffers as they fail to follow LLMs'\nreasoning paths. Luckily, we reveal that only a small fraction of tokens\ngenuinely diverge reasoning paths between LLMs and SLMs. Most generated tokens\nare either identical or exhibit neutral differences, such as minor variations\nin abbreviations or expressions. Leveraging this insight, we introduce **Roads\nto Rome (R2R)**, a neural token routing method that selectively utilizes LLMs\nonly for these critical, path-divergent tokens, while leaving the majority of\ntoken generation to the SLM. We also develop an automatic data generation\npipeline that identifies divergent tokens and generates token-level routing\nlabels to train the lightweight router. We apply R2R to combine R1-1.5B and\nR1-32B models from the DeepSeek family, and evaluate on challenging math,\ncoding, and QA benchmarks. With an average activated parameter size of 5.6B,\nR2R surpasses the average accuracy of R1-7B by 1.6x, outperforming even the\nR1-14B model. Compared to R1-32B, it delivers a 2.8x wall-clock speedup with\ncomparable performance, advancing the Pareto frontier of test-time scaling\nefficiency.

In this perspective paper, we introduce a structured,\nmulti-phased framework, \"SME-TEAM\" for the secure and responsible use of these\ntechnologies in SMEs. Based on a conceptual structure of four key pillars,\ni.e., Data, Algorithms, Human Oversight, and Model Architecture, SME-TEAM\nbridges theoretical ethical principles with operational practice, enhancing AI\ncapabilities across a wide range of applications in SMEs. Ultimately, this\npaper provides a structured roadmap for the adoption of these emerging\ntechnologies, positioning trust and ethics as a driving force for resilience,\ncompetitiveness, and sustainable innovation within the area of business\nanalytics and SMEs."

This is particularly the case when fine-tuning\npre-trained models, which can have large weight and activation outlier values\nthat make lower-precision optimization difficult. To address this, we present\nHALO, a novel quantization-aware training approach for Transformers that\nenables accurate and efficient low-precision training by combining 1) strategic\nplacement of Hadamard rotations in both forward and backward passes, which\nmitigate outliers, 2) high-performance kernel support, and 3) FSDP integration\nfor low-precision communication. Our approach ensures that all large matrix\nmultiplications during the forward and backward passes are executed in lower\nprecision. Applied to LLAMA-family models, HALO achieves\nnear-full-precision-equivalent results during fine-tuning on various tasks,\nwhile delivering up to 1.41x end-to-end speedup for full fine-tuning on RTX\n4090 GPUs. HALO efficiently supports both standard and parameterefficient\nfine-tuning (PEFT). Our results demonstrate the first practical approach to\nfully quantized LLM fine-tuning that maintains accuracy in 8-bit precision,\nwhile delivering performance benefits.

To address this, we present\nHALO, a novel quantization-aware training approach for Transformers that\nenables accurate and efficient low-precision training by combining 1) strategic\nplacement of Hadamard rotations in both forward and backward passes, which\nmitigate outliers, 2) high-performance kernel support, and 3) FSDP integration\nfor low-precision communication. Our approach ensures that all large matrix\nmultiplications during the forward and backward passes are executed in lower\nprecision. Applied to LLAMA-family models, HALO achieves\nnear-full-precision-equivalent results during fine-tuning on various tasks,\nwhile delivering up to 1.41x end-to-end speedup for full fine-tuning on RTX\n4090 GPUs. HALO efficiently supports both standard and parameterefficient\nfine-tuning (PEFT). Our results demonstrate the first practical approach to\nfully quantized LLM fine-tuning that maintains accuracy in 8-bit precision,\nwhile delivering performance benefits.

However, the literature at the intersection of\nthese verticals, i.e., Agentic Embodied AI, remains scarce. This paper\nintroduces an MCP server for analyzing ROS and ROS 2 bags, allowing for\nanalyzing, visualizing and processing robot data with natural language through\nLLMs and VLMs. We describe specific tooling built with robotics domain\nknowledge, with our initial release focused on mobile robotics and supporting\nnatively the analysis of trajectories, laser scan data, transforms, or time\nseries data. This is in addition to providing an interface to standard ROS 2\nCLI tools (\"ros2 bag list\" or \"ros2 bag info\"), as well as the ability to\nfilter bags with a subset of topics or trimmed in time. Coupled with the MCP\nserver, we provide a lightweight UI that allows the benchmarking of the tooling\nwith different LLMs, both proprietary (Anthropic, OpenAI) and open-source\n(through Groq). Our experimental results include the analysis of tool calling\ncapabilities of eight different state-of-the-art LLM/VLM models, both\nproprietary and open-source, large and small. Our experiments indicate that\nthere is a large divide in tool calling capabilities, with Kimi K2 and Claude\nSonnet 4 demonstrating clearly superior performance. We also conclude that\nthere are multiple factors affecting the success rates, from the tool\ndescription schema to the number of arguments, as well as the number of tools\navailable to the models.

Here, we study data curation strategies\nwhere an imperfect oracle selects the training examples according to their\ndifficulty and correctness. Our results provide exact scaling law curves for\ntest error under both label-agnostic and label-aware curation rules, revealing\nwhen and why keeping only a subset of data can improve generalization. In\ncontrast to classical scaling laws, we show that under certain conditions,\nsmall curated datasets can outperform full datasets, and we provide analytical\nconditions for this by deriving precise phase transition curves tied to data\nsize and quality. We validate these theoretical claims with empirical results\non ImageNet, confirming our predictions about when curation improves accuracy\nand can even mitigate model collapse.

In this\npaper, we search for neutrinos from this failed supernova using data from\nSuper-Kamiokande (SK). Based on the estimated time of black hole formation\ninferred from optical and infrared observations, we define a search window for\nneutrino events in the SK data. Using this window, we develop a dedicated\nanalysis method for failed supernovae and apply it to M31-2014-DS1, by\nconducting a cluster search using the timing and energy information of\ncandidate events. No significant neutrino excess is observed within the search\nregion. Consequently, we place an upper limit on the electron antineutrino\nluminosity from M31-2014-DS1 and discuss its implications for various failed SN\nmodels and their neutrino emission characteristics. Despite the 18 MeV\nthreshold adopted to suppress backgrounds, the search remains sufficiently\nsensitive to constrain the Shen-TM1 EOS, yielding a 90% confidence level upper\nlimit of 1.76 \\times 10^{53} erg on the electron antineutrino luminosity,\nslightly above the expected value of 1.35 \\times 10^{53} erg.",

However, the research community's progress\nremains constrained by the absence of large-scale, high-quality, and openly\naccessible datasets built specifically for medical image editing with strict\nanatomical and clinical constraints. We introduce Med-Banana-50K, a\ncomprehensive 50K-image dataset for instruction-based medical image editing\nspanning three modalities (chest X-ray, brain MRI, fundus photography) and 23\ndisease types. Our dataset is constructed by leveraging Gemini-2.5-Flash-Image\nto generate bidirectional edits (lesion addition and removal) from real medical\nimages. What distinguishes Med-Banana-50K from general-domain editing datasets\nis our systematic approach to medical quality control: we employ LLM-as-Judge\nwith a medically grounded rubric (instruction compliance, structural\nplausibility, realism, and fidelity preservation) and history-aware iterative\nrefinement up to five rounds. Beyond single-turn editing, Med-Banana-50K\nincludes 37K failed attempts with full conversation logs for preference\nlearning and alignment research. By providing this large-scale, medically\nvalidated, and fully documented resource, Med-Banana-50K establishes a\nfoundation for training and evaluating the next generation of medical image\nediting models.Our dataset and code are publicly available at\n[https://github.com/richardChenzhihui/med-banana-50k].",

However, the research community's progress\nremains constrained by the absence of large-scale, high-quality, and openly\naccessible datasets built specifically for medical image editing with strict\nanatomical and clinical constraints. We introduce Med-Banana-50K, a\ncomprehensive 50K-image dataset for instruction-based medical image editing\nspanning three modalities (chest X-ray, brain MRI, fundus photography) and 23\ndisease types. Our dataset is constructed by leveraging Gemini-2.5-Flash-Image\nto generate bidirectional edits (lesion addition and removal) from real medical\nimages. What distinguishes Med-Banana-50K from general-domain editing datasets\nis our systematic approach to medical quality control: we employ LLM-as-Judge\nwith a medically grounded rubric (instruction compliance, structural\nplausibility, realism, and fidelity preservation) and history-aware iterative\nrefinement up to five rounds. Beyond single-turn editing, Med-Banana-50K\nincludes 37K failed attempts with full conversation logs for preference\nlearning and alignment research. By providing this large-scale, medically\nvalidated, and fully documented resource, Med-Banana-50K establishes a\nfoundation for training and evaluating the next generation of medical image\nediting models.Our dataset and code are publicly available at\n[https://github.com/richardChenzhihui/med-banana-50k]."

In this work, we propose Agent Distillation, a framework for\ntransferring not only reasoning capability but full task-solving behavior from\nLLM-based agents into sLMs with retrieval and code tools. We improve agent\ndistillation along two complementary axes: (1) we introduce a prompting method\ncalled first-thought prefix to enhance the quality of teacher-generated\ntrajectories; and (2) we propose a self-consistent action generation for\nimproving test-time robustness of small agents. We evaluate our method on eight\nreasoning tasks across factual and mathematical domains, covering both\nin-domain and out-of-domain generalization. Our results show that sLMs as small\nas 0.5B, 1.5B, 3B parameters can achieve performance competitive with next-tier\nlarger 1.5B, 3B, 7B models fine-tuned using CoT distillation, demonstrating the\npotential of agent distillation for building practical, tool-using small\nagents.

Existing approaches often\nrely on monolithic graph retrieval, incurring unnecessary latency for simple\nqueries and fragmented reasoning for complex multi-hop questions. To address\nthese challenges, this paper propose SPLIT-RAG, a multi-agent RAG framework\nthat addresses these limitations with question-driven semantic graph\npartitioning and collaborative subgraph retrieval. The innovative framework\nfirst create Semantic Partitioning of Linked Information, then use the\nType-Specialized knowledge base to achieve Multi-Agent RAG. The attribute-aware\ngraph segmentation manages to divide knowledge graphs into semantically\ncoherent subgraphs, ensuring subgraphs align with different query types, while\nlightweight LLM agents are assigned to partitioned subgraphs, and only relevant\npartitions are activated during retrieval, thus reduce search space while\nenhancing efficiency. Finally, a hierarchical merging module resolves\ninconsistencies across subgraph-derived answers through logical verifications.\nExtensive experimental validation demonstrates considerable improvements\ncompared to existing approaches.",

                    "value": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems empower large language models\n(LLMs) with external knowledge, yet struggle with efficiency-accuracy\ntrade-offs when scaling to large knowledge graphs. Existing approaches often\nrely on monolithic graph retrieval, incurring unnecessary latency for simple\nqueries and fragmented reasoning for complex multi-hop questions. To address\nthese challenges, this paper propose SPLIT-RAG, a multi-agent RAG framework\nthat addresses these limitations with question-driven semantic graph\npartitioning and collaborative subgraph retrieval. The innovative framework\nfirst create Semantic Partitioning of Linked Information, then use the\nType-Specialized knowledge base to achieve Multi-Agent RAG. The attribute-aware\ngraph segmentation manages to divide knowledge graphs into semantically\ncoherent subgraphs, ensuring subgraphs align with different query types, while\nlightweight LLM agents are assigned to partitioned subgraphs, and only relevant\npartitions are activated during retrieval, thus reduce search space while\nenhancing efficiency. Finally, a hierarchical merging module resolves\ninconsistencies across subgraph-derived answers through logical verifications.\nExtensive experimental validation demonstrates considerable improvements\ncompared to existing approaches."

The system\nlearns from its optimization history to avoid past mistakes and to accelerate\nconvergence. The inherent explainability makes this a powerful tool for analog\ndesign space exploration and a new paradigm in analog EDA, where AI agents\nserve as transparent design assistants."

                "summary": "Modern LLMs can now produce highly readable abstractive summaries, to the\npoint that traditional automated metrics for evaluating summary quality, such\nas ROUGE, have saturated. However, LLMs still sometimes introduce inaccuracies\ninto summaries, i.e., information inconsistent with or unsupported by the\ncorresponding source. Measuring the occurrence of these often subtle factual\ninconsistencies automatically has proved challenging. This in turn has\nmotivated development of metrics intended to measure the factual consistency of\ngenerated summaries against sources. But are these approaches measuring what\nthey purport to? Or are they mostly exploiting artifacts? In this work, we\nstress test a range of automatic factuality metrics, including specialized\nmodels and LLM-based prompting methods, to probe what they actually capture.\nUsing a shallow classifier to separate ``easy'' examples for factual evaluation\nwhere surface features suffice from ``hard'' cases requiring deeper reasoning,\nwe find that all metrics show substantial performance drops on the latter.\nFurthermore, some metrics are more sensitive to benign, fact-preserving edits\nthan to factual corrections. Building on this observation, we demonstrate that\nmost automatic factuality metrics can be gamed, i.e., their scores can be\nartificially inflated by appending innocuous, content-free sentences to\nsummaries.

                    "value": "Modern LLMs can now produce highly readable abstractive summaries, to the\npoint that traditional automated metrics for evaluating summary quality, such\nas ROUGE, have saturated. However, LLMs still sometimes introduce inaccuracies\ninto summaries, i.e., information inconsistent with or unsupported by the\ncorresponding source. Measuring the occurrence of these often subtle factual\ninconsistencies automatically has proved challenging. This in turn has\nmotivated development of metrics intended to measure the factual consistency of\ngenerated summaries against sources. But are these approaches measuring what\nthey purport to? Or are they mostly exploiting artifacts? In this work, we\nstress test a range of automatic factuality metrics, including specialized\nmodels and LLM-based prompting methods, to probe what they actually capture.\nUsing a shallow classifier to separate ``easy'' examples for factual evaluation\nwhere surface features suffice from ``hard'' cases requiring deeper reasoning,\nwe find that all metrics show substantial performance drops on the latter.\nFurthermore, some metrics are more sensitive to benign, fact-preserving edits\nthan to factual corrections. Building on this observation, we demonstrate that\nmost automatic factuality metrics can be gamed, i.e., their scores can be\nartificially inflated by appending innocuous, content-free sentences to\nsummaries.

SecRepoBench has 318 code\ncompletion tasks in 27 C/C++ repositories, covering 15 CWEs.

Among key advances made are that the\n$^{239}$Pu file was reevaluated by a joint international effort and that\nupdated $^{16,18}$O, $^{19}$F, $^{28-30}$Si, $^{50-54}$Cr, $^{55}$Mn,\n$^{54,56,57}$Fe, $^{63,65}$Cu, $^{139}$La, $^{233,235,238}$U, and\n$^{240,241}$Pu neutron nuclear data from the IAEA coordinated INDEN\ncollaboration were adopted. Over 60 neutron dosimetry cross sections were\nadopted from the IAEA's IRDFF-II library. In addition, the new library includes\nsignificant changes for $^3$He, $^6$Li,$^9$Be, $^{51}$V, $^{88}$Sr, $^{103}$Rh,\n$^{140,142}$Ce, Dy, $^{181}$Ta, Pt, $^{206-208}$Pb, and $^{234,236}$U neutron\ndata, and new nuclear data for the photonuclear, charged-particle and atomic\nsublibraries. Numerous thermal neutron scattering kernels were reevaluated or\nprovided for the very first time. On the covariance side, work was undertaken\nto introduce better uncertainty quantification standards and testing for\nnuclear data covariances. The significant effort to reevaluate important\nnuclides has reduced bias in the simulations of many integral experiments with\nparticular progress noted for fluorine, copper, and stainless steel containing\nbenchmarks. Data issues hindered the successful deployment of the previous\nENDF/B-VIII.0 for commercial nuclear power applications in high burnup\nsituations. These issues were addressed by improving the $^{238}$U and\n$^{239,240,241}$Pu evaluated data in the resonance region. The new library\nperformance as a function of burnup is similar to the reference ENDF/B-VII.1\nlibrary.

To address this, we present\nHALO, a novel quantization-aware training approach for Transformers that\nenables accurate and efficient low-precision training by combining 1) strategic\nplacement of Hadamard rotations in both forward and backward passes, which\nmitigate outliers, 2) high-performance kernel support, and 3) FSDP integration\nfor low-precision communication. Our approach ensures that all large matrix\nmultiplications during the forward and backward passes are executed in lower\nprecision. Applied to LLAMA-family models, HALO achieves\nnear-full-precision-equivalent results during fine-tuning on various tasks,\nwhile delivering up to 1.41x end-to-end speedup for full fine-tuning on RTX\n4090 GPUs. HALO efficiently supports both standard and parameterefficient\nfine-tuning (PEFT).

We also propose\nGAAP, a perturbation algorithm based on genetic algorithms, which enhances the\ndiversity of sampled inputs. In addition, we introduce a new evaluation metric,\nTemperature Sensitivity of Uncertainty (TSU), which directly assesses\nuncertainty without relying on correctness as a proxy. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that Inv-Entropy outperforms existing semantic UQ methods. The code\nto reproduce the results can be found at\nhttps://github.com/UMDataScienceLab/Uncertainty-Quantification-for-LLMs."

By leveraging unlabeled data with the statistical learning\ncapabilities of data-driven models, LSR dynamically optimizes the label space\nrepresentation at test time. Our experiments across seven benchmarks\ndemonstrate that LSR improves macro-F1 scores by an average of 7.0% (up to\n14.2%) with Llama-3.1-70B and 3.3% (up to 11.1%) with Claude-3.5-Sonnet\ncompared to standard zero-shot classification baselines. To reduce the\ncomputational overhead of LSR, which requires an additional LLM call at each\niteration, we propose distilling the model into a probabilistic classifier,\nallowing for efficient inference."

Unlike\ntraditional intent recognition systems that depend on large, annotated corpora\nand often struggle with fine-grained, multi-label discrimination, our approach\neliminates the need for costly data collection while enhancing the accuracy of\nmulti-label intention understanding. Specifically, the overall pipeline, named\nDMTC, consists of three steps: 1) using prompt engineering to guide large\nlanguage models (LLMs) to generate diverse synthetic queries in different\ntransport scenarios; 2) encoding each textual query with a Sentence-T5 model to\nobtain compact semantic embeddings; 3) training a lightweight classifier using\na novel online focal-contrastive (OFC) loss that emphasizes hard samples and\nmaximizes inter-class separability. The applicability of the proposed pipeline\nis demonstrated in an agentic AI application in the maritime transportation\ncontext. Extensive experiments show that DMTC achieves a Hamming loss of 5.35%\nand an AUC of 95.92%, outperforming state-of-the-art multi-label classifiers\nand recent end-to-end SOTA LLM-based baselines. Further analysis reveals that\nSentence-T5 embeddings improve subset accuracy by at least 3.29% over\nalternative encoders, and integrating the OFC loss yields an additional 0.98%\ngain compared to standard contrastive objectives. In conclusion, our system\nseamlessly routes user queries to task-specific modules (e.g., ETA information,\ntraffic risk evaluation, and other typical scenarios in the transportation\ndomain), laying the groundwork for fully autonomous, intention-aware agents\nwithout costly manual labelling.",

Our method leverages multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to train\nan outer-loop control policy for each MAV. Unlike state-of-the-art controllers\nthat utilize a centralized scheme, our policy does not require global states,\ninter-MAV communications, nor neighboring MAV information. Instead, agents\ncommunicate implicitly through load pose observations alone, which enables high\nscalability and flexibility. It also significantly reduces computing costs\nduring inference time, enabling onboard deployment of the policy. In addition,\nwe introduce a new action space design for the MAVs using linear acceleration\nand body rates. This choice, combined with a robust low-level controller,\nenables reliable sim-to-real transfer despite significant uncertainties caused\nby cable tension during dynamic 3D motion. We validate our method in various\nreal-world experiments, including full-pose control under load model\nuncertainties, showing setpoint tracking performance comparable to the\nstate-of-the-art centralized method. We also demonstrate cooperation amongst\nagents with heterogeneous control policies, and robustness to the complete\nin-flight loss of one MAV.

This study compares the performance\nof four open-source LLMs, Mistral-7b-instruct, LLaMa2-7b-chat,\nFalcon-7b-instruct and Orca-mini-v3-7b, and OpenAI's trending GPT-3.5 over QA\ntasks within the computer science literature leveraging RAG support. Evaluation\nmetrics employed in the study include accuracy and precision for binary\nquestions and ranking by a human expert, ranking by Google's AI model Gemini,\nalongside cosine similarity for long-answer questions. GPT-3.5, when paired\nwith RAG, effectively answers binary and long-answer questions, reaffirming its\nstatus as an advanced LLM. Regarding open-source LLMs, Mistral AI's\nMistral-7b-instruct paired with RAG surpasses the rest in answering both binary\nand long-answer questions. However, among the open-source LLMs, Orca-mini-v3-7b\nreports the shortest average latency in generating responses, whereas\nLLaMa2-7b-chat by Meta reports the highest average latency. This research\nunderscores the fact that open-source LLMs, too, can go hand in hand with\nproprietary models like GPT-3.5 with better infrastructure.",

                    "value": "Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is emerging as a powerful technique to\nenhance the capabilities of Generative AI models by reducing hallucination.\nThus, the increasing prominence of RAG alongside Large Language Models (LLMs)\nhas sparked interest in comparing the performance of different LLMs in\nquestion-answering (QA) in diverse domains. This study compares the performance\nof four open-source LLMs, Mistral-7b-instruct, LLaMa2-7b-chat,\nFalcon-7b-instruct and Orca-mini-v3-7b, and OpenAI's trending GPT-3.5 over QA\ntasks within the computer science literature leveraging RAG support. Evaluation\nmetrics employed in the study include accuracy and precision for binary\nquestions and ranking by a human expert, ranking by Google's AI model Gemini,\nalongside cosine similarity for long-answer questions. GPT-3.5, when paired\nwith RAG, effectively answers binary and long-answer questions, reaffirming its\nstatus as an advanced LLM. Regarding open-source LLMs, Mistral AI's\nMistral-7b-instruct paired with RAG surpasses the rest in answering both binary\nand long-answer questions. However, among the open-source LLMs, Orca-mini-v3-7b\nreports the shortest average latency in generating responses, whereas\nLLaMa2-7b-chat by Meta reports the highest average latency. This research\nunderscores the fact that open-source LLMs, too, can go hand in hand with\nproprietary models like GPT-3.5 with better infrastructure."
