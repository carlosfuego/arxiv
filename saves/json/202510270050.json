Traditional\ngeneral-purpose accelerators struggle to effectively exploit fine-grain\nparallelism due to limitations in implementing convoluted data-dependency\npatterns (like SIMD) and overheads due to synchronization and data transfers\n(like GPGPUs). In contrast, custom FPGA and ASIC designs offer improved\nperformance and energy efficiency at a high cost in hardware design and\nprogramming complexity and often lack the flexibility to process different\nworkloads. We propose Squire, a general-purpose accelerator designed to exploit\nfine-grain parallelism effectively on dependency-bound kernels. Each Squire\naccelerator has a set of general-purpose low-power in-order cores that can\nrapidly communicate among themselves and directly access data from the L2\ncache. Our proposal integrates one Squire accelerator per core in a typical\nmulticore system, allowing the acceleration of dependency-bound kernels within\nparallel tasks with minimal software changes. As a case study, we evaluate\nSquire's effectiveness by accelerating five kernels that implement complex\ndependency patterns. We use three of these kernels to build an end-to-end\nread-mapping tool that will be used to evaluate Squire. Squire obtains speedups\nup to 7.64$\\times$ in dynamic programming kernels. Overall, Squire provides an\nacceleration for an end-to-end application of 3.66$\\times$. In addition, Squire\nreduces energy consumption by up to 56% with a minimal area overhead of 10.5%\ncompared to a Neoverse-N1 baseline.",

Skip connections offer a promising way to improve representation\nwithout bloating resource usage, yet most prior works either improve\nexpressivity while leaving KV costs unchanged, or reduce memory at the cost of\nweaker representation.

Here, we use inelastic x-ray scattering to\nshow that the CDW in KV$_3$Sb$_5$ forms via phonons that soften to zero energy\nat the CDW ordering vector ($L$-point) around $T_{\\rm CDW}=78$~K. These soft\nphonons exhibit a remarkable in-plane anisotropy, extending over a much larger\nmomentum range along $L$-$A$ relative to $L$-$H$, which leads to diffuse\nscattering common among $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$. Using first-principles calculations, we\nfind that the momentum-dependent electron-phonon coupling (EPC) is peaked at\n$L$ and exhibits the same in-plane anisotropy as the phonon softening.\nConversely, the electronic susceptibility is not peaked at $L$ and shows the\nopposite in-plane anisotropy. Our findings favor momentum-dependent EPC as the\ndriving mechanism of the CDW in KV$_3$Sb$_5$, with a CDW formation process\nsimilar to that of transition metal dichalcogenides.",

                    "value": "A range of of unusual emergent behaviors have been reported in the\ncharge-density wave (CDW) state of the $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A=~$K, Rb, Cs) kagome\nmetals, including a CDW formation process without soft phonons, which points to\nan unconventional CDW mechanism. Here, we use inelastic x-ray scattering to\nshow that the CDW in KV$_3$Sb$_5$ forms via phonons that soften to zero energy\nat the CDW ordering vector ($L$-point) around $T_{\\rm CDW}=78$~K. These soft\nphonons exhibit a remarkable in-plane anisotropy, extending over a much larger\nmomentum range along $L$-$A$ relative to $L$-$H$, which leads to diffuse\nscattering common among $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$. Using first-principles calculations, we\nfind that the momentum-dependent electron-phonon coupling (EPC) is peaked at\n$L$ and exhibits the same in-plane anisotropy as the phonon softening.\nConversely, the electronic susceptibility is not peaked at $L$ and shows the\nopposite in-plane anisotropy. Our findings favor momentum-dependent EPC as the\ndriving mechanism of the CDW in KV$_3$Sb$_5$, with a CDW formation process\nsimilar to that of transition metal dichalcogenides."

FUSE-based distributed file systems flip those trade-offs:\nthey run in user space for fast deployment and strong fault isolation, yet the\nFUSE interface disables the kernel's write-back page cache whenever strong\nconsistency is required. Practitioners must therefore choose between (i) weak\nconsistency with fast write-back caching or (ii) strong consistency with slow\nwrite-through I/O, a limitation that has kept FUSE distributed file systems out\nof write-intensive cloud workloads.\n  To this end, we present DFUSE, the first distributed FUSE file system that\ndelivers write-back kernel caching and strong consistency. DFUSE achieves this\nby offloading userspace consistency control to the kernel driver, allowing\ncoordinated access to the kernel's page cache across nodes. This design\neliminates blind local cache updates and ensures cluster-wide strong\nconsistency without compromising performance. In our evaluation, DFUSE achieves\nup to 68.0% higher throughput and 40.4% lower latency than the existing\nwrite-through design of FUSE-based distributed file systems.",

Practitioners must therefore choose between (i) weak\nconsistency with fast write-back caching or (ii) strong consistency with slow\nwrite-through I/O, a limitation that has kept FUSE distributed file systems out\nof write-intensive cloud workloads.\n  To this end, we present DFUSE, the first distributed FUSE file system that\ndelivers write-back kernel caching and strong consistency. DFUSE achieves this\nby offloading userspace consistency control to the kernel driver, allowing\ncoordinated access to the kernel's page cache across nodes. This design\neliminates blind local cache updates and ensures cluster-wide strong\nconsistency without compromising performance. In our evaluation, DFUSE achieves\nup to 68.0% higher throughput and 40.4% lower latency than the existing\nwrite-through design of FUSE-based distributed file systems."

Our main\ntakeaways are that model quantization methods and speculative decoding can\nimprove service system efficiency with small compromise to RLLM accuracy, while\nprefix caching, KV cache quantization may even degrade accuracy or serving\nperformance for small RLLM. Lastly, we conduct evaluation under real world\nworkload modeled by Gamma distribution to verify our findings.

Embodied agents\nequipped with large language models (LLMs) and online constructed navigation\nmaps can perform ObjNav in a zero-shot manner. However, existing agents heavily\nrely on giant LLMs on the cloud, e.g., GPT-4, while directly switching to small\nLLMs, e.g., LLaMA3.2-11b, suffer from significant success rate drops due to\nlimited model capacity for understanding complex navigation maps, which\nprevents deploying ObjNav on local devices. At the same time, the long prompt\nintroduced by the navigation map description will cause high planning latency\non local devices. In this paper, we propose EfficientNav to enable on-device\nefficient LLM-based zero-shot ObjNav. To help the smaller LLMs better\nunderstand the environment, we propose semantics-aware memory retrieval to\nprune redundant information in navigation maps. To reduce planning latency, we\npropose discrete memory caching and attention-based memory clustering to\nefficiently save and re-use the KV cache. Extensive experimental results\ndemonstrate that EfficientNav achieves 11.1% improvement in success rate on\nHM3D benchmark over GPT-4-based baselines, and demonstrates 6.7x real-time\nlatency reduction and 4.7x end-to-end latency reduction over GPT-4 planner.

Causality prevents access\nto future frames that offline methods exploit, while accumulation causes tokens\nto grow unbounded, creating efficiency bottlenecks. However, existing\napproaches only regulate post-LLM kv-cache, leaving costly pre-LLM prefill\nunchanged. We introduce StreamingTOM, a training-free, plug-and-play two-stage\nframework that addresses both pre-LLM and post-LLM bottlenecks with predictable\nlatency. Causal Temporal Reduction imposes a fixed per-frame budget and selects\ntokens based on adjacent-frame changes and token saliency, drastically reducing\nper-frame prefill cost by processing only a compact subset of visual tokens per\nframe instead of all visual tokens. Online Quantized Memory stores tokens in\n4-bit format, retrieves relevant groups on demand, and dequantizes them,\nkeeping the active kv-cache bounded regardless of stream length. Experiments\ndemonstrate our method achieves $15.7\\times$ kv-cache compression, $1.2\\times$\nlower peak memory and $2\\times$ faster TTFT compared to prior SOTA.\nStreamingTOM maintains state-of-the-art accuracy among training-free methods\nwith an average of $63.8\\%$ on offline benchmarks and $55.8\\%/3.7$ on RVS.\nThese results highlight the practical benefits of our two-stage approach for\nefficient streaming video understanding with bounded growth.",

                    "value": "Unlike offline processing, streaming video vision-language models face two\nfundamental constraints: causality and accumulation. Causality prevents access\nto future frames that offline methods exploit, while accumulation causes tokens\nto grow unbounded, creating efficiency bottlenecks. However, existing\napproaches only regulate post-LLM kv-cache, leaving costly pre-LLM prefill\nunchanged. We introduce StreamingTOM, a training-free, plug-and-play two-stage\nframework that addresses both pre-LLM and post-LLM bottlenecks with predictable\nlatency. Causal Temporal Reduction imposes a fixed per-frame budget and selects\ntokens based on adjacent-frame changes and token saliency, drastically reducing\nper-frame prefill cost by processing only a compact subset of visual tokens per\nframe instead of all visual tokens. Online Quantized Memory stores tokens in\n4-bit format, retrieves relevant groups on demand, and dequantizes them,\nkeeping the active kv-cache bounded regardless of stream length. Experiments\ndemonstrate our method achieves $15.7\\times$ kv-cache compression, $1.2\\times$\nlower peak memory and $2\\times$ faster TTFT compared to prior SOTA.\nStreamingTOM maintains state-of-the-art accuracy among training-free methods\nwith an average of $63.8\\%$ on offline benchmarks and $55.8\\%/3.7$ on RVS.\nThese results highlight the practical benefits of our two-stage approach for\nefficient streaming video understanding with bounded growth."

To enable efficient deployment, we design an online anchor token\nselection kernel compatible with FlashAttention.

However, existing research predominantly focuses on reasoning\nperformance, often neglecting the efficiency of agentic systems. In this work,\nwe present a comprehensive empirical study that identifies efficiency\nbottlenecks in web-interactive agentic systems. We decompose end-to-end latency\ninto two primary components: LLM API latency and web environment latency. We\nconduct a comprehensive empirical study across 15 models and 5 providers to\ndemonstrate high variability in API-based agentic systems. We observe that web\nenvironment latency can contribute as much as 53.7% to the overall latency in a\nweb-based agentic system. To improve latency, we propose SpecCache, a caching\nframework augmented with speculative execution that can reduce web environment\noverhead. Extensive evaluations on two standard benchmarks show that our\napproach improves the cache hit rate by up to 58x compared to a random caching\nstrategy, while reducing web environment overhead by up to 3.2x, without\ndegrading agentic system performance.",

Quantization is\nfundamental to enable LLMs on resource-constrained edge devices, and llama.cpp\nutilizes block floating point (BFP) quantization to drastically reduce the bit\nwidth of weights and input tensors, the memory footprint, and the computational\npower required to run LLMs. LLMs are typically quantized with mixed BFP\nquantization across the model layers to reduce the loss of model accuracy due\nto quantization.

However, the extended reasoning sequences introduce\nsignificant GPU memory overhead due to increased key-value (KV) cache. Existing\nKV cache compression methods mitigate memory bottlenecks but struggle in long\nreasoning tasks. In this paper, we analyze attention patterns in reasoning\ntasks and reveal a Token Importance Recurrence phenomenon: a large proportion\nof tokens regain high attention after multiple decoding steps, which is failed\nto capture by existing works and may lead to unpredictable eviction on such\nperiodically critical tokens. To address this, we propose LazyEviction, an\nobservation window-based lagged eviction framework retaining latent recurring\ntokens by prioritized eviction based on tokens' recurrence patterns.

To schedule\ntasks with dynamic, multidimensional resource requirements in heterogeneous\ncluster, Dodoor uses a novel load score to measure servers' loads for each\nscheduled task. This score captures the anti-affinity between servers and tasks\nin contrast to the commonly used heuristic of counting pending tasks to balance\nload.

This paper considers offloading most\nof such data structures from the costly host DRAM to secondary memory whose\nlatency is in the microsecond range, an order of magnitude longer than those of\ncurrently available DIMM-mounted or CXL memory devices. While emerging\nmicrosecond-latency memory is likely to cost much less than DRAM, it can\nsignificantly slow down SSD-based KV stores if naively employed.

Long video generation presents\nchallenges in both efficiency and quality. Diffusion and Diffusion-Forcing\nmodels can produce high-quality videos but suffer from low efficiency due to\nbidirectional attention. Causal attention AR models support KV caching for\nfaster inference, but often degrade in quality on long videos due to memory\nchallenges during long-video training. In addition, beyond static prompt-based\ngeneration, interactive capabilities, such as streaming prompt inputs, are\ncritical for dynamic content creation, enabling users to guide narratives in\nreal time. This interactive requirement significantly increases complexity,\nespecially in ensuring visual consistency and semantic coherence during prompt\ntransitions. To address these challenges, LongLive adopts a causal, frame-level\nAR design that integrates a KV-recache mechanism that refreshes cached states\nwith new prompts for smooth, adherent switches; streaming long tuning to enable\nlong video training and to align training and inference (train-long-test-long);\nand short window attention paired with a frame-level attention sink, shorten as\nframe sink, preserving long-range consistency while enabling faster generation.\nWith these key designs, LongLive fine-tunes a 1.3B-parameter short-clip model\nto minute-long generation in just 32 GPU-days. At inference, LongLive sustains\n20.7 FPS on a single NVIDIA H100, achieves strong performance on VBench in both\nshort and long videos. LongLive supports up to 240-second videos on a single\nH100 GPU. LongLive further supports INT8-quantized inference with only marginal\nquality loss.",

To enable efficient inference, we design a\nstreaming KV-cache memory mechanism that constructs a hierarchical memory\nstructure for selective recall of relevant tokens, enabling efficient semantic\nretrieval while reducing the overhead of storing all tokens in the traditional\nKV-cache.

To suppress external\nmagnetic noise the apparatus is enclosed within a cylindrical four-layer\nmu-metal shield with a shielding factor exceeding $10^6$ in one radial\ndirection and $10^5$ in the other.

Using atomic magnetometers to monitor the magnetic field\ninside the shield, we measure noise below 40 fT/$\\sqrt{{\\rm Hz}}$ at 1 Hz and\nabove, rising to 500 fT/$\\sqrt{{\\rm Hz}}$ at 0.1 Hz.

Each magnetometer measures the magnetic field correlated with the\ndirection of the applied electric field with a precision of 0.11 fT in 104\nhours of data.

Our\nsimulation-based calibration framework, implemented with a suite of machine\nlearning algorithms and scored by a heuristic reliability metric, allows us to\niteratively build posterior distributions of the progenitors of SS\\,433-like\nsystems.

This study develops a deep learning-based ensemble framework for\nmulti-step precipitation prediction through joint modeling of a comprehensive\nset of atmospheric variables. The model is trained on ERA5 reanalysis data at\n0.25$^{\\circ}$ spatial resolution, with precipitation labels from NASA's\nIntegrated Multi-satellite Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement\n(GPM) constellation (IMERG), incorporating 57 input variables, including\nupper-air and surface predictors. The architecture employs a patch-based Swin\nTransformer backbone with periodic convolutions to handle longitudinal\ncontinuity and integrates time and noise embeddings through conditional layer\nnormalization. A dual-branch decoder predicts total precipitation and other\nvariables, with targeted freezing of encoder-decoder pathways for specialized\ntraining. Training minimizes a hybrid loss combining the Continuous Ranked\nProbability Score (CRPS) and weighted log1p mean squared error (log1pMSE),\nbalancing probabilistic accuracy and magnitude fidelity. During inference, the\nmodel ingests real-time Global Forecast System (GFS) initial conditions to\ngenerate 15-day forecasts autoregressively. Evaluation against GEFS using IMERG\ndata demonstrates higher Critical Success Index (CSI) scores at precipitation\nthresholds of 0.1 mm, 1 mm, 10 mm, and 20 mm, highlighting improved performance\nfor moderate to heavy rainfall.",

In such\nuses, users may need to share private information (e.g., health records,\ncontact details). To evaluate LLMs' ability to identify and redact such private\ninformation, prior work developed benchmarks (e.g., ConfAIde, PrivacyLens) with\nreal-life scenarios. Using these benchmarks, researchers have found that LLMs\nsometimes fail to keep secrets private when responding to complex tasks (e.g.,\nleaking employee salaries in meeting summaries). However, these evaluations\nrely on LLMs (proxy LLMs) to gauge compliance with privacy norms, overlooking\nreal users' perceptions. Moreover, prior work primarily focused on the\nprivacy-preservation quality of responses, without investigating nuanced\ndifferences in helpfulness. To understand how users perceive the\nprivacy-preservation quality and helpfulness of LLM responses to\nprivacy-sensitive scenarios, we conducted a user study with 94 participants\nusing 90 scenarios from PrivacyLens. We found that, when evaluating identical\nresponses to the same scenario, users showed low agreement with each other on\nthe privacy-preservation quality and helpfulness of the LLM response. Further,\nwe found high agreement among five proxy LLMs, while each individual LLM had\nlow correlation with users' evaluations. These results indicate that the\nprivacy and helpfulness of LLM responses are often specific to individuals, and\nproxy LLMs are poor estimates of how real users would perceive these responses\nin privacy-sensitive scenarios. Our results suggest the need to conduct\nuser-centered studies on measuring LLMs' ability to help users while preserving\nprivacy.

Reasoning\nlarge language models (LLMs) promise cross-task adaptability with trans- parent\nreasoning traces, yet their potential has not been fully realized for tabular\ndata. This paper presents TabR1, the first reasoning LLM for tabular prediction\nwith multi-step reasoning. At its core is Permutation Relative Policy\nOptimization (PRPO), a simple yet efficient reinforcement learning method that\nencodes column-permutation invariance as a structural prior. By construct- ing\nmultiple label-preserving permutations per sample and estimating advantages\nboth within and across permutations, PRPO transforms sparse rewards into dense\nlearning signals and improves generalization. With limited supervision, PRPO\nactivates the reasoning ability of LLMs for tabular prediction, enhancing\nfew-shot and zero-shot performance as well as interpretability. Comprehensive\nexperiments demonstrate that TabR1 achieves performance comparable to strong\nbaselines under full-supervision fine-tuning. In the zero-shot setting, TabR1\napproaches the performance of strong baselines under the 32-shot setting.\nMoreover, TabR1 (8B) substantially outperforms much larger LLMs across various\ntasks, achieving up to 53.17% improvement over DeepSeek-R1 (685B).",

At its core is Permutation Relative Policy\nOptimization (PRPO), a simple yet efficient reinforcement learning method that\nencodes column-permutation invariance as a structural prior. By construct- ing\nmultiple label-preserving permutations per sample and estimating advantages\nboth within and across permutations, PRPO transforms sparse rewards into dense\nlearning signals and improves generalization. With limited supervision, PRPO\nactivates the reasoning ability of LLMs for tabular prediction, enhancing\nfew-shot and zero-shot performance as well as interpretability. Comprehensive\nexperiments demonstrate that TabR1 achieves performance comparable to strong\nbaselines under full-supervision fine-tuning. In the zero-shot setting, TabR1\napproaches the performance of strong baselines under the 32-shot setting.\nMoreover, TabR1 (8B) substantially outperforms much larger LLMs across various\ntasks, achieving up to 53.17% improvement over DeepSeek-R1 (685B)."

Moreover, existing policies often\nimplement complex access control specifications and thus can be difficult to\nprecisely analyze in determining their behavior works exactly as intended.\nRecently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great success in automated\ncode synthesis and summarization. Given this success, they could potentially be\nused for automatically generating access control policies or aid in\nunderstanding existing policies. In this paper, we explore the effectiveness of\nLLMs for access control policy synthesis and summarization. Specifically, we\nfirst investigate diverse LLMs for access control policy synthesis, finding\nthat: although LLMs can effectively generate syntactically correct policies,\nthey have permissiveness issues, generating policies equivalent to the given\nspecification 45.8% of the time for non-reasoning LLMs, and 93.7% of the time\nfor reasoning LLMs. We then investigate how LLMs can be used to analyze\npolicies by introducing a novel semantic-based request summarization approach\nwhich leverages LLMs to generate a precise characterization of the requests\nallowed by a policy. Our results show that while there are significant hurdles\nin leveraging LLMs for automated policy generation, LLMs show promising results\nwhen combined with symbolic approaches in analyzing existing policies.",

Given this success, they could potentially be\nused for automatically generating access control policies or aid in\nunderstanding existing policies. In this paper, we explore the effectiveness of\nLLMs for access control policy synthesis and summarization. Specifically, we\nfirst investigate diverse LLMs for access control policy synthesis, finding\nthat: although LLMs can effectively generate syntactically correct policies,\nthey have permissiveness issues, generating policies equivalent to the given\nspecification 45.8% of the time for non-reasoning LLMs, and 93.7% of the time\nfor reasoning LLMs. We then investigate how LLMs can be used to analyze\npolicies by introducing a novel semantic-based request summarization approach\nwhich leverages LLMs to generate a precise characterization of the requests\nallowed by a policy. Our results show that while there are significant hurdles\nin leveraging LLMs for automated policy generation, LLMs show promising results\nwhen combined with symbolic approaches in analyzing existing policies."

By capturing nuanced insights\nfrom both modalities, this approach generates more comprehensive and\ncontextually rich item representations. Extensive experiments conducted on two\nwidely used benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing\nprompting baselines in downstream recommendation accuracy. Furthermore, we\nidentify a U-shaped relationship between text-image dissimilarity and\nrecommendation performance, suggesting the benefit of applying multimodal\nprompting selectively. To support efficient real-time inference, we also\nintroduce X-Reflect-keyword, a lightweight variant that summarizes image\ncontent using keywords and replaces the base model with a smaller backbone,\nachieving nearly 50% reduction in input length while maintaining competitive\nperformance.

To validate our findings in a\nreal-world setting, we deploy a self-reflection enhanced marketing content\nlocalisation system at Lounge by Zalando, where it shows market-dependent\neffectiveness, reinforcing the importance of domain specific evaluation when\ndeploying these techniques. Our results provide actionable guidance for\nselecting optimal inference strategies given specific domains and resource\nconstraints. We open source our self-reflection implementation for\nreproducibility at\nhttps://github.com/aws-samples/sample-genai-reflection-for-bedrock."

In this paper, we explore the inner mechanisms of safety alignment\nthrough the lens of mechanistic interpretability, focusing on identifying and\nanalyzing safety neurons within LLMs that are responsible for safety behaviors.\nWe propose inference-time activation contrasting to locate these neurons and\ndynamic activation patching to evaluate their causal effects on model safety.\nExperiments on multiple prevalent LLMs demonstrate that we can consistently\nidentify about $5\\%$ safety neurons, and by only patching their activations we\ncan restore over $90\\%$ of the safety performance across various red-teaming\nbenchmarks without influencing general ability. The finding of safety neurons\nalso helps explain the ''alignment tax'' phenomenon by revealing that the key\nneurons for model safety and helpfulness significantly overlap, yet they\nrequire different activation patterns for the same neurons. Furthermore, we\ndemonstrate an application of our findings in safeguarding LLMs by detecting\nunsafe outputs before generation.

In this paper, we explore the inner mechanisms of safety alignment\nthrough the lens of mechanistic interpretability, focusing on identifying and\nanalyzing safety neurons within LLMs that are responsible for safety behaviors.\nWe propose inference-time activation contrasting to locate these neurons and\ndynamic activation patching to evaluate their causal effects on model safety.\nExperiments on multiple prevalent LLMs demonstrate that we can consistently\nidentify about $5\\%$ safety neurons, and by only patching their activations we\ncan restore over $90\\%$ of the safety performance across various red-teaming\nbenchmarks without influencing general ability. The finding of safety neurons\nalso helps explain the ''alignment tax'' phenomenon by revealing that the key\nneurons for model safety and helpfulness significantly overlap, yet they\nrequire different activation patterns for the same neurons. Furthermore, we\ndemonstrate an application of our findings in safeguarding LLMs by detecting\nunsafe outputs before generation.

Understanding the age of these metal-rich RR Lyrae stars\nis crucial for constraining their formation pathways and assessing what\nGalactic populations they are tracing. In this work, we leverage the\nunprecedented astrometric precision of Gaia DR3 to infer the age distribution\nof metal-rich RR Lyrae stars through a kinematic comparison with O-rich Mira\nvariables. Mira variables, with their well-established period-age relation,\nserve as a natural clock, allowing us to transfer age information to RR Lyrae\nstars via their phase-space properties. By applying this approach across\ndifferent metallicity bins, we find that the most metal-rich RR Lyrae stars\n($[\\rm Fe/H] > -0.5$) exhibit kinematics consistent with long-period\n($\\rm{period}\\approx 150\\,\\rm{days}$), young Mira variable population; its age\ncorresponds to $\\sim 6-7$ Gyr (adopting the period-age relation in Zhang &\nSanders 2023) that is significantly younger than typically assumed for RR Lyrae\nstars. In contrast, those with $-1 < [\\rm Fe/H] < -0.5$ show properties more\naligned with older ($\\approx 9-11$ Gyr) populations. Interestingly we also find\nevidence of a possible double age populations for the most metal-rich RR Lyrae,\none younger with ages between 4 and 6 Gyr, and another one older ranging from 8\nto 9 Gyr. These results provide strong evidence that metal-rich RR Lyrae stars\nin the Galactic field do not exclusively trace ancient populations.

We present a unified framework for\ncertifiable inference in LLMs, showing that majority voting provides a\nstatistical certificate of self-consistency: under mild assumptions, the\naggregated answer coincides with the mode of the model's terminal distribution\nwith high probability. We derive finite-sample and anytime-valid concentration\nbounds that quantify this confidence, and introduce the Martingale Majority\nCertificate (MMC), a sequential stopping rule that adaptively determines when\nsufficient samples have been drawn. We further prove that label-free\npost-training methods such as TTRL implicitly sharpen the answer distribution\nby exponentially tilting it toward its mode, thereby reducing the number of\nsamples required for certification. Building on this insight, we propose new\npost-training objectives that explicitly optimise this trade-off between\nsharpness and bias. Together, these results explain and connect two central\ntest-time scaling strategies, self-consistency and TTRL, within a single\nstatistical framework for label-free, certifiable reliability in reasoning\nLLMs.",

We present a unified framework for\ncertifiable inference in LLMs, showing that majority voting provides a\nstatistical certificate of self-consistency: under mild assumptions, the\naggregated answer coincides with the mode of the model's terminal distribution\nwith high probability. We derive finite-sample and anytime-valid concentration\nbounds that quantify this confidence, and introduce the Martingale Majority\nCertificate (MMC), a sequential stopping rule that adaptively determines when\nsufficient samples have been drawn. We further prove that label-free\npost-training methods such as TTRL implicitly sharpen the answer distribution\nby exponentially tilting it toward its mode, thereby reducing the number of\nsamples required for certification. Building on this insight, we propose new\npost-training objectives that explicitly optimise this trade-off between\nsharpness and bias. Together, these results explain and connect two central\ntest-time scaling strategies, self-consistency and TTRL, within a single\nstatistical framework for label-free, certifiable reliability in reasoning\nLLMs."

However, current research has largely overlooked the generation of\nontologies extending from established upper-level frameworks like the Basic\nFormal Ontology (BFO), risking the creation of non-integrable ontology silos.\nThis study explores the extent to which LLMs, particularly GPT-4, can support\nontologists trained in BFO. Through iterative development of a specialized GPT\nmodel named \"My Ontologist,\" we aimed to generate BFO-conformant ontologies.\nInitial versions faced challenges in maintaining definition conventions and\nleveraging foundational texts effectively. My Ontologist 3.0 showed promise by\nadhering to structured rules and modular ontology suites, yet the release of\nGPT-4o disrupted this progress by altering the model's behavior.

However, current research has largely overlooked the generation of\nontologies extending from established upper-level frameworks like the Basic\nFormal Ontology (BFO), risking the creation of non-integrable ontology silos.\nThis study explores the extent to which LLMs, particularly GPT-4, can support\nontologists trained in BFO. Through iterative development of a specialized GPT\nmodel named \"My Ontologist,\" we aimed to generate BFO-conformant ontologies.\nInitial versions faced challenges in maintaining definition conventions and\nleveraging foundational texts effectively. My Ontologist 3.0 showed promise by\nadhering to structured rules and modular ontology suites, yet the release of\nGPT-4o disrupted this progress by altering the model's behavior. Our findings\nunderscore the importance of aligning LLM-generated ontologies with top-level\nstandards and highlight the complexities of integrating evolving AI\ncapabilities in ontology engineering."

The density-functional theory calculations are\ncarried out for interpretation of experimental infra-red spectra. The\nperformance of various basis sets and exchange-correlation functionals is\ncompared, including both agreement of scaled calculated band positions with\nexperimental values and computational time. The inter-molecular interactions in\nthe crystal phase are inferred from the experimental IR spectra and\ndensity-functional theory calculations for dimers in head-to-head and\nhead-to-tail configurations. The experimental temperature dependence of the C=O\nstretching band suggests that the head-to-tail configuration in a crystal phase\nis more likely. A significant slowing down of the flip-flop relaxation process\nis observed at the transition between the smectic C and hexagonal smectic X\nphases."

In such\nuses, users may need to share private information (e.g., health records,\ncontact details). To evaluate LLMs' ability to identify and redact such private\ninformation, prior work developed benchmarks (e.g., ConfAIde, PrivacyLens) with\nreal-life scenarios. Using these benchmarks, researchers have found that LLMs\nsometimes fail to keep secrets private when responding to complex tasks (e.g.,\nleaking employee salaries in meeting summaries). However, these evaluations\nrely on LLMs (proxy LLMs) to gauge compliance with privacy norms, overlooking\nreal users' perceptions. Moreover, prior work primarily focused on the\nprivacy-preservation quality of responses, without investigating nuanced\ndifferences in helpfulness. To understand how users perceive the\nprivacy-preservation quality and helpfulness of LLM responses to\nprivacy-sensitive scenarios, we conducted a user study with 94 participants\nusing 90 scenarios from PrivacyLens. We found that, when evaluating identical\nresponses to the same scenario, users showed low agreement with each other on\nthe privacy-preservation quality and helpfulness of the LLM response. Further,\nwe found high agreement among five proxy LLMs, while each individual LLM had\nlow correlation with users' evaluations. These results indicate that the\nprivacy and helpfulness of LLM responses are often specific to individuals, and\nproxy LLMs are poor estimates of how real users would perceive these responses\nin privacy-sensitive scenarios. Our results suggest the need to conduct\nuser-centered studies on measuring LLMs' ability to help users while preserving\nprivacy. Additionally, future research could investigate ways to improve the\nalignment between proxy LLMs and users for better estimation of users'\nperceived privacy and utility.",

However, reward\nhacking issues with PRMs limit their successful application in reinforcement\nfine-tuning. In this paper, we identify the main cause of PRM-induced reward\nhacking: the canonical summation-form credit assignment in reinforcement\nlearning (RL), which defines the value as cumulative gamma-decayed future\nrewards, easily induces LLMs to hack steps with high rewards. To address this,\nwe propose PURE: Process sUpervised Reinforcement lEarning. The key innovation\nof PURE is a min-form credit assignment that formulates the value function as\nthe minimum of future rewards. This method significantly alleviates reward\nhacking by limiting the value function range and distributing advantages more\nreasonably. Through extensive experiments on 3 base models, we show that\nPRM-based approaches enabling min-form credit assignment achieve comparable\nreasoning performance to verifiable reward-based methods within only 30% steps.\nIn contrast, the canonical sum-form credit assignment collapses training even\nat the beginning! Additionally, when we supplement PRM-based fine-tuning with\njust 10% verifiable rewards, we further alleviate reward hacking and produce\nthe best fine-tuned model based on Qwen2.5-Math-7B in our experiments,\nachieving 82.5% accuracy on AMC23 and 53.3% average accuracy across 5\nbenchmarks. Moreover, we summarize the observed reward hacking cases and\nanalyze the causes of training collapse. We release our code and model weights\nat https://github.com/CJReinforce/PURE.",

However, reward\nhacking issues with PRMs limit their successful application in reinforcement\nfine-tuning. In this paper, we identify the main cause of PRM-induced reward\nhacking: the canonical summation-form credit assignment in reinforcement\nlearning (RL), which defines the value as cumulative gamma-decayed future\nrewards, easily induces LLMs to hack steps with high rewards.

The system replaces\nad-hoc, manual operations with event-driven orchestration on a local server,\nemploying reusable device abstractions and a centralized interlock with\npriority-based arbitration for shared piping. It implements deterministic\nroutines for delivery, reverse osmosis integration, evaporator feed, and\npermeate management. The system is sensor rich: inline measurements of flow,\ntemperature, and sugar concentration (degrees Brix) drive routing decisions and\ntrigger systematic post-transfer rinses (cleaning-in-place), ensuring\nconsistent hygiene and complete, immediate traceability up to the evaporator\ninlet. During the 2025 production season, the system queued 431 operations\nwithout incident; executed 908 \\enquote{topstock} and \\enquote{downstock}\nbalancing cycles; increased usable permeate reserves from 22,712 to\napproximately 41,640 L through dynamic storage assignment; eliminated\nmid-season contamination incidents previously observed under manual practice;\nand reduced administrative effort for billing and reporting from more than 30\nhours to roughly 1 hour through automatic documentation. These results\ndemonstrate a practical path to modular, plant-scale automation beyond\ntraditional architectures, and lay the groundwork for packaging reusable\nelements for similar plants or adjacent industries.

We present the first formal analysis of model extraction attacks\nthrough the lens of competitive analysis, establishing a foundational framework\nto evaluate their efficiency. Focusing on models based on additive decision\ntrees (e.g., decision trees, gradient boosting, and random forests), we\nintroduce novel reconstruction algorithms that achieve provably perfect\nfidelity while demonstrating strong anytime performance. Our framework provides\ntheoretical bounds on the query complexity for extracting tree-based model,\noffering new insights into the security vulnerabilities of their deployment."

Beyond its technical innovations,\nthe framework provides tangible environmental benefits. By enabling precise and\nautomated waste segregation, it supports higher recycling efficiency, reduces\ncontamination in recyclable streams, and minimizes the ecological and\noperational costs of waste processing.

Our method combines a protein\nlanguage model as a sequence encoder (ESM-3B) and a decoder-only language model\n(LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct) through a lightweight nonlinear modality projector. A\nkey innovation is our Hybrid Sequence-level Contrastive Alignment Learning\n(H-SCALE), which improves cross-modal learning by matching mean- and std-pooled\nprotein embeddings with text representations via contrastive loss. After the\nalignment phase, we apply instruction-based fine-tuning using LoRA on the\ndecoder to teach the model how to generate accurate protein function\ndescriptions conditioned on the protein sequence. We train Prot2Text-V2 on\nabout 250K curated entries from SwissProt and evaluate it under low-homology\nconditions, where test sequences have low similarity with training samples.\nProt2Text-V2 consistently outperforms traditional and LLM-based baselines\nacross various metrics.",

This study extends a unified\nbenchmark to evaluate GPT-5 and GPT-4o under zero-, one-, and five-shot\nprompting across five core biomedical NLP tasks: named entity recognition,\nrelation extraction, multi-label document classification, summarization, and\nsimplification, and nine expanded biomedical QA datasets covering factual\nknowledge, clinical reasoning, and multimodal visual understanding. Using\nstandardized prompts, fixed decoding parameters, and consistent inference\npipelines, we assessed model performance, latency, and token-normalized cost\nunder official pricing. GPT-5 consistently outperformed GPT-4o, with the\nlargest gains on reasoning-intensive datasets such as MedXpertQA and\nDiagnosisArena and stable improvements in multimodal QA. In core tasks, GPT-5\nachieved better chemical NER and ChemProt scores but remained below\ndomain-tuned baselines for disease NER and summarization. Despite producing\nlonger outputs, GPT-5 showed comparable latency and 30 to 50 percent lower\neffective cost per correct prediction. Fine-grained analyses revealed\nimprovements in diagnosis, treatment, and reasoning subtypes, whereas\nboundary-sensitive extraction and evidence-dense summarization remain\nchallenging. Overall, GPT-5 approaches deployment-ready performance for\nbiomedical QA while offering a favorable balance of accuracy, interpretability,\nand economic efficiency. The results support a tiered prompting strategy:\ndirect prompting for large-scale or cost-sensitive applications, and\nchain-of-thought scaffolds for analytically complex or high-stakes scenarios,\nhighlighting the continued need for hybrid solutions where precision and\nfactual fidelity are critical.",

This study extends a unified\nbenchmark to evaluate GPT-5 and GPT-4o under zero-, one-, and five-shot\nprompting across five core biomedical NLP tasks: named entity recognition,\nrelation extraction, multi-label document classification, summarization, and\nsimplification, and nine expanded biomedical QA datasets covering factual\nknowledge, clinical reasoning, and multimodal visual understanding. Using\nstandardized prompts, fixed decoding parameters, and consistent inference\npipelines, we assessed model performance, latency, and token-normalized cost\nunder official pricing. GPT-5 consistently outperformed GPT-4o, with the\nlargest gains on reasoning-intensive datasets such as MedXpertQA and\nDiagnosisArena and stable improvements in multimodal QA. In core tasks, GPT-5\nachieved better chemical NER and ChemProt scores but remained below\ndomain-tuned baselines for disease NER and summarization. Despite producing\nlonger outputs, GPT-5 showed comparable latency and 30 to 50 percent lower\neffective cost per correct prediction. Fine-grained analyses revealed\nimprovements in diagnosis, treatment, and reasoning subtypes, whereas\nboundary-sensitive extraction and evidence-dense summarization remain\nchallenging. Overall, GPT-5 approaches deployment-ready performance for\nbiomedical QA while offering a favorable balance of accuracy, interpretability,\nand economic efficiency. The results support a tiered prompting strategy:\ndirect prompting for large-scale or cost-sensitive applications, and\nchain-of-thought scaffolds for analytically complex or high-stakes scenarios,\nhighlighting the continued need for hybrid solutions where precision and\nfactual fidelity are critical."

The Answer Consensus\nRefinement (ACR) module further resolves inconsistencies between semantic- and\nvisual-based predictions by fusing evidence and constraining the answer space.\nExtensive experiments on long video understanding benchmarks show that SeViCES\nconsistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and\nrobustness, demonstrating the importance of consensus-driven evidence selection\nfor Video-LLMs.",

This approach, however, provides a coarse signal for model\nimprovement and overlooks the quality of the underlying reasoning process. We\nargue that a more granular evaluation of reasoning offers a more effective path\nto building robust models. We decompose reasoning quality into two dimensions:\nrelevance and coherence. Relevance measures if a step is grounded in the\nproblem; coherence measures if it follows logically from prior steps.

We present a unified framework for\ncertifiable inference in LLMs, showing that majority voting provides a\nstatistical certificate of self-consistency: under mild assumptions, the\naggregated answer coincides with the mode of the model's terminal distribution\nwith high probability. We derive finite-sample and anytime-valid concentration\nbounds that quantify this confidence, and introduce the Martingale Majority\nCertificate (MMC), a sequential stopping rule that adaptively determines when\nsufficient samples have been drawn.

We present a unified framework for\ncertifiable inference in LLMs, showing that majority voting provides a\nstatistical certificate of self-consistency: under mild assumptions, the\naggregated answer coincides with the mode of the model's terminal distribution\nwith high probability. We derive finite-sample and anytime-valid concentration\nbounds that quantify this confidence, and introduce the Martingale Majority\nCertificate (MMC), a sequential stopping rule that adaptively determines when\nsufficient samples have been drawn.

To address these challenges, we introduce LeVo, a\nlanguage model based framework consisting of LeLM and Music Codec. LeLM is\ncapable of parallel modeling of two types of tokens: mixed tokens, which\nrepresent the combined audio of vocals and accompaniment to achieve better\nvocal-instrument harmony, and dual-track tokens, which separately encode vocals\nand accompaniment for high-quality song generation. It employs two decoder-only\ntransformers and a modular extension training strategy to prevent interference\nbetween different token types. To further enhance musicality and instruction\nfollowing ability, we introduce a multi-preference alignment method based on\nDirect Preference Optimization (DPO). This method handles diverse human\npreferences through a semi-automatic data construction process and\npost-training.

Unlike traditional models that rely on static KD with fixed weights,\nour method dynamically adjusts the distillation weight using fuzzy logic,\nenabling the student model to focus on high-confidence regions while reducing\nattention to ambiguous areas. This dynamic adjustment improves the model\nability to handle varying uncertainty levels across different regions of LC\nimages. We employ the Vision Transformer (ViT-B32) as the instructor model,\nwhich effectively transfers knowledge to the student model, MobileNet,\nenhancing the student generalization capabilities. The training process is\nfurther optimized using a dynamic wait adjustment mechanism that adapts the\ntraining procedure for improved convergence and performance. To enhance image\nquality, we introduce pixel-level image fusion improvement techniques such as\nGamma correction and Histogram Equalization. The processed images (Pix1 and\nPix2) are fused using a wavelet-based fusion method to improve image resolution\nand feature preservation. This fusion method uses the wavedec2 function to\nstandardize images to a 224x224 resolution, decompose them into multi-scale\nfrequency components, and recursively average coefficients at each level for\nbetter feature representation. To address computational efficiency, Genetic\nAlgorithm (GA) is used to select the most suitable pre-trained student model\nfrom a pool of 12 candidates, balancing model performance with computational\ncost. The model is evaluated on two datasets, including LC25000\nhistopathological images (99.16% accuracy) and IQOTH/NCCD CT-scan images\n(99.54% accuracy), demonstrating robustness across different imaging domains.",

                    "value": "This paper presents the FuzzyDistillViT-MobileNet model, a novel approach for\nlung cancer (LC) classification, leveraging dynamic fuzzy logic-driven\nknowledge distillation (KD) to address uncertainty and complexity in disease\ndiagnosis. Unlike traditional models that rely on static KD with fixed weights,\nour method dynamically adjusts the distillation weight using fuzzy logic,\nenabling the student model to focus on high-confidence regions while reducing\nattention to ambiguous areas. This dynamic adjustment improves the model\nability to handle varying uncertainty levels across different regions of LC\nimages. We employ the Vision Transformer (ViT-B32) as the instructor model,\nwhich effectively transfers knowledge to the student model, MobileNet,\nenhancing the student generalization capabilities. The training process is\nfurther optimized using a dynamic wait adjustment mechanism that adapts the\ntraining procedure for improved convergence and performance. To enhance image\nquality, we introduce pixel-level image fusion improvement techniques such as\nGamma correction and Histogram Equalization. The processed images (Pix1 and\nPix2) are fused using a wavelet-based fusion method to improve image resolution\nand feature preservation. This fusion method uses the wavedec2 function to\nstandardize images to a 224x224 resolution, decompose them into multi-scale\nfrequency components, and recursively average coefficients at each level for\nbetter feature representation. To address computational efficiency, Genetic\nAlgorithm (GA) is used to select the most suitable pre-trained student model\nfrom a pool of 12 candidates, balancing model performance with computational\ncost. The model is evaluated on two datasets, including LC25000\nhistopathological images (99.16% accuracy) and IQOTH/NCCD CT-scan images\n(99.54% accuracy), demonstrating robustness across different imaging domains."

However, current approaches remain limited to synthesizing motion from\nshort or general text prompts, primarily due to dataset constraints.

In this paper, we introduce SnapMoGen, a new text-motion dataset\nfeaturing high-quality motion capture data paired with accurate, expressive\ntextual annotations. The dataset comprises 20K motion clips totaling 44 hours,\naccompanied by 122K detailed textual descriptions averaging 48 words per\ndescription (vs. 12 words of HumanML3D). Importantly, these motion clips\npreserve original temporal continuity as they were in long sequences,\nfacilitating research in long-term motion generation and blending. We also\nimprove upon previous generative masked modeling approaches. Our model,\nMoMask++, transforms motion into multi-scale token sequences that better\nexploit the token capacity, and learns to generate all tokens using a single\ngenerative masked transformer. MoMask++ achieves state-of-the-art performance\non both HumanML3D and SnapMoGen benchmarks. Additionally, we demonstrate the\nability to process casual user prompts by employing an LLM to reformat inputs\nto align with the expressivity and narration style of SnapMoGen.
