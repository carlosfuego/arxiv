In addition, we apply orthogonal transformations to\nattention heads without changing the model to increase similarity between\nattention heads before pruning training, in order to further improve\nperformance of the model. Our method can be compatible with rotary position\nembedding (RoPE), which means the model after training can be fully adapted to\nthe mainstream standard GQA framework. Experiments demonstrate that our\nstrategy can compress up to 87.5% of key-value heads of the LLaMA2-7B model\nwithout too much performance degradation, just achieved through supervised\nfine-tuning."

AOP\nenhances software modularity by encapsulating cross-cutting concerns, such as\nlogging, caching, and parallelizing, into separate, reusable aspects.\nLeveraging Julia's powerful metaprogramming and abstract syntax tree (AST)\nmanipulation capabilities, we introduce AspectJulia, an AOP framework designed\nto operate within Julia's runtime environment as a package. AspectJulia enables\ndevelopers to define and apply aspects seamlessly, leading to more modular,\nmaintainable, and adaptable code. We detail the implementation of AspectJulia\nand present diverse use cases, ranging from HPC and scientific computing to\nbusiness applications, demonstrating its effectiveness in managing\ncross-cutting concerns. This integration simplifies application development and\nimproves the adaptability of existing Julia modules and packages, paving the\nway for more efficient and maintainable software systems.",

AOP\nenhances software modularity by encapsulating cross-cutting concerns, such as\nlogging, caching, and parallelizing, into separate, reusable aspects.\nLeveraging Julia's powerful metaprogramming and abstract syntax tree (AST)\nmanipulation capabilities, we introduce AspectJulia, an AOP framework designed\nto operate within Julia's runtime environment as a package. AspectJulia enables\ndevelopers to define and apply aspects seamlessly, leading to more modular,\nmaintainable, and adaptable code. We detail the implementation of AspectJulia\nand present diverse use cases, ranging from HPC and scientific computing to\nbusiness applications, demonstrating its effectiveness in managing\ncross-cutting concerns. This integration simplifies application development and\nimproves the adaptability of existing Julia modules and packages, paving the\nway for more efficient and maintainable software systems."

However, the standard approaches generate sequences\nof discrete tokens immediately before responding, and so they can incur\nsignificant latency costs and be challenging to optimize. In this work, we\ndemonstrate that a frozen LLM can be augmented with an offline coprocessor that\noperates on the model's key-value (kv) cache. This coprocessor augments the\ncache with a set of latent embeddings designed to improve the fidelity of\nsubsequent decoding. We train this coprocessor using the language modeling loss\nfrom the decoder on standard pretraining data, while keeping the decoder itself\nfrozen. This approach enables the model to learn, in an end-to-end\ndifferentiable fashion, how to distill additional computation into its\nkv-cache. Because the decoder remains unchanged, the coprocessor can operate\noffline and asynchronously, and the language model can function normally if the\ncoprocessor is unavailable or if a given cache is deemed not to require extra\ncomputation. We show experimentally that when a cache is augmented, the decoder\nachieves lower perplexity on numerous subsequent tokens. Furthermore, even\nwithout any task-specific training, our experiments demonstrate that cache\naugmentation consistently reduces perplexity and improves performance across a\nrange of reasoning-intensive tasks.",

The key problem is that data plane\nperformance is slow, and scaled instances remain stopped while parameters are\nloading. We first show that data plane can be made fast with no/O(1) caching by\nloading parameters through the compute network between GPUs because: (1) its\nspeed is comparable host cache and is underutilized; (2) scaling multiple\ninstances requires no or O(1) caching with network-optimized multicast. Second,\nautoscaling can be made live by breaking the scaling abstraction from a\ncoarse-grained instance-level to a fine-grained layer-level. This allows us to\noffload the layer computation from the overloaded serving instances to the\nscaled instance with cooperative execution, thus handles cases even when the\ncompute network is not sufficiently fast. Our system BLITZSCALE reduces the\nserving tail latencies by up to 86% without caching, and we achieve comparable\nperformance (or even better) to an optimal setup where all the parameters are\ncached at all the host for autoscaling.",

Additionally,\ndefect classification heavily relies on contextual information within images,\nand existing methods fall short of effectively extracting this information. To\naddress these challenges, we propose a general FSDMC framework called MVREC,\nwhich offers two primary advantages: (1) MVREC extracts general features for\ndefect instances by incorporating the pre-trained AlphaCLIP model. (2) It\nutilizes a region-context framework to enhance defect features by leveraging\nmask region input and multi-view context augmentation. Furthermore, Few-shot\nZip-Adapter(-F) classifiers within the model are introduced to cache the visual\nfeatures of the support set and perform few-shot classification. We also\nintroduce MVTec-FS, a new FSDMC benchmark based on MVTec AD, which includes\n1228 defect images with instance-level mask annotations and 46 defect types.\nExtensive experiments conducted on MVTec-FS and four additional datasets\ndemonstrate its effectiveness in general defect classification and its ability\nto incorporate contextual information to improve classification performance.\nCode: https://github.com/ShuaiLYU/MVREC",

We close this gap by performing a comprehensive\ncomplexity-theoretic analysis of the problem through the lens of the\nparameterized complexity paradigm, which is designed to provide more precise\nstatements regarding algorithmic tractability than classical complexity.

                    "value": "The fundamental caching problem in networks asks to find an allocation of\ncontents to a network of caches with the aim of maximizing the cache hit rate.\nDespite the problem's importance to a variety of research areas -- including\nnot only content delivery, but also edge intelligence and inference -- and the\nextensive body of work on empirical aspects of caching, very little is known\nabout the exact boundaries of tractability for the problem beyond its general\nNP-hardness. We close this gap by performing a comprehensive\ncomplexity-theoretic analysis of the problem through the lens of the\nparameterized complexity paradigm, which is designed to provide more precise\nstatements regarding algorithmic tractability than classical complexity. Our\nresults include algorithmic lower and upper bounds which together establish the\nconditions under which the caching problem becomes tractable."

Our development process encompasses\ncomprehensive pre-training, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and reinforcement\nlearning from human feedback (RLHF), where we devise deliberate strategies for\nmulti-stage training, synthetic data construction, and reward modeling.\nFurthermore, we implement RAISE (Responsible AI Safety Engine), a\nfour-component framework to address safety issues across pre-training,\npost-training, and serving phases. Empowered by our scalable super-computing\ninfrastructure, all these innovations substantially reduce training, deployment\nand inference costs while maintaining high-performance standards. With further\nevaluations on public academic benchmarks, Yi-Lightning demonstrates\ncompetitive performance against top-tier LLMs, while we observe a notable\ndisparity between traditional, static benchmark results and real-world, dynamic\nhuman preferences.

A key feature of\nLLMs is their ability to engage in multi-turn interactions with humans or\nexternal tools, enabling a wide range of tasks. Each new request in a\nmulti-turn interaction depends on the intermediate state, specifically the\nkey-value (K,V) caches, from previous requests in the ongoing interaction.\nExisting serving engines either recompute the K,V caches or offload them to\nmain memory. Profiling reveals that recomputation can result in over 99% of\nprocessed tokens being redundant. On the other hand, offloading K,V caches from\nGPU memory makes inference serving stateful, leading to load imbalances across\nthe cluster. To address these challenges, we developed SYMPHONY. SYMPHONY\nleverages the observation that multi-turn work loads provide additional hints\nthat allow K,V caches to be migrated off the critical serving path. By\nutilizing these hints, SYMPHONY dynamically migrates K,V caches to enable\nfinegrained scheduling of inference requests. Our experiments demonstrate that\nSYMPHONY can handle over 8x the number of requests compared to state-of-the-art\nbaselines, with a similar latency profile.",

FDIP can alleviate L1I cache misses, but when it encounters a BTB\nmiss, the BPU may not identify the current instruction as a branch to FDIP.\nThis can prevent FDIP from prefetching or cause it to speculate down the wrong\npath, further polluting the L1I cache. We observe that the vast majority, 75%,\nof BTB-missing, unidentified branches are actually present in instruction cache\nlines that FDIP has previously fetched but, these missing branches have not yet\nbeen decoded and inserted into the BTB. This is because the instruction line is\ndecoded from an entry point (which is the target of the previous taken branch)\ntill an exit point (the taken branch). Branch instructions present in the\nignored portion of the cache line we call them \"Shadow Branches\". Here we\npresent Skeia, a novel shadow branch decoding technique that identifies and\ndecodes unused bytes in cache lines fetched by FDIP, inserting them into a\nShadow Branch Buffer (SBB). The SBB is accessed in parallel with the BTB,\nallowing FDIP to speculate despite a BTB miss. With a minimal storage state of\n12.25KB, Skeia delivers a geomean speedup of ~5.7% over an 8K-entry BTB (78KB)\nand ~2% versus adding an equal amount of state to the BTB across 16 front-end\nbound applications. Since many branches stored in the SBB are unique compared\nto those in a similarly sized BTB, we consistently observe greater performance\ngains with Skeia across all examined sizes until saturation.",

Here we\npresent Skeia, a novel shadow branch decoding technique that identifies and\ndecodes unused bytes in cache lines fetched by FDIP, inserting them into a\nShadow Branch Buffer (SBB). The SBB is accessed in parallel with the BTB,\nallowing FDIP to speculate despite a BTB miss. With a minimal storage state of\n12.25KB, Skeia delivers a geomean speedup of ~5.7% over an 8K-entry BTB (78KB)\nand ~2% versus adding an equal amount of state to the BTB across 16 front-end\nbound applications. Since many branches stored in the SBB are unique compared\nto those in a similarly sized BTB, we consistently observe greater performance\ngains with Skeia across all examined sizes until saturation."

In addition,\nVivar leverages latent reuse and caching strategies to accelerate 2D and AR\ncontent generation. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our system\nachieves 11$\\times$ latency reduction without compromising quality.

This mechanism\nintegrates global understanding with query-specific local details, thus\nimproving answer decoding. Experiments on a variety of long-context\ninformation-seeking datasets demonstrate ACRE's effectiveness, achieving\nimprovements in both performance and efficiency."

Both the above strategies have limitations - the former cannot be\napplied to handle KV Caching necessary for speed-ups in modern framework and\nthe latter does not capture the variation in layer importance across tasks or\nmore generally, across input sequences. To address both limitations, we propose\nFiRST, an algorithm that reduces inference latency by using layer-specific\nrouters to select a subset of transformer layers adaptively for each input\nsequence - the prompt (during the prefill stage) decides which layers will be\nskipped during decoding. FiRST preserves compatibility with KV caching enabling\nfaster inference while being quality-aware. FiRST is model-agnostic and can be\neasily enabled on any pre-trained LLM. Our approach reveals that input\nadaptivity is critical - indeed, different task-specific middle layers play a\ncrucial role in evolving hidden representations depending on tasks. Extensive\nexperiments show that FiRST significantly reduces latency while outperforming\nother layer selection strategies in quality metics. It retains competitive\nperformance to base model (without layer skipping) and in some cases, even\nimproves upon it. FiRST is thus a promising and efficient solution for LLM\ndeployment in low-resource environments.",

Both the above strategies have limitations - the former cannot be\napplied to handle KV Caching necessary for speed-ups in modern framework and\nthe latter does not capture the variation in layer importance across tasks or\nmore generally, across input sequences. To address both limitations, we propose\nFiRST, an algorithm that reduces inference latency by using layer-specific\nrouters to select a subset of transformer layers adaptively for each input\nsequence - the prompt (during the prefill stage) decides which layers will be\nskipped during decoding. FiRST preserves compatibility with KV caching enabling\nfaster inference while being quality-aware. FiRST is model-agnostic and can be\neasily enabled on any pre-trained LLM. Our approach reveals that input\nadaptivity is critical - indeed, different task-specific middle layers play a\ncrucial role in evolving hidden representations depending on tasks. Extensive\nexperiments show that FiRST significantly reduces latency while outperforming\nother layer selection strategies in quality metics. It retains competitive\nperformance to base model (without layer skipping) and in some cases, even\nimproves upon it. FiRST is thus a promising and efficient solution for LLM\ndeployment in low-resource environments."

As LLM inference scales towards\nmultiple GPUs and even multiple compute nodes, various coordination patterns,\nsuch as prefill-decode disaggregation and context migration, arise in serving\nsystems. Most inference services today expose a coarse-grained request-level\nAPI with a pre-configured coordination strategy, limiting the ability to\ncustomize and dynamically reconfigure the coordination. In this paper, we\npropose LLM microserving, a multi-level architecture for structuring and\nprogramming LLM inference services. We introduces simple yet effective\nmicroserving APIs to support fine-grained sub-request level actions. A\nprogrammable router transforms user requests into sub-request calls, enabling\nthe dynamic reconfiguration of serving patterns. To support diverse execution\npatterns, we develop a unified KV cache interface that handles various KV\ncompute, transfer, and reuse scenarios. Our evaluation shows that LLM\nmicroserving can be reconfigured to support multiple disaggregation\norchestration strategies in a few lines of Python code while maintaining\nstate-of-the-art performance for LLM inference tasks. Additionally, it allows\nus to explore new strategy variants that reduce up to 47% of job completion\ntime compared to the existing strategies.",

Unfortunately, existing\nmethods for fusing multi-exposure images in dynamic scenes are designed for\nlow-resolution images, which makes them inefficient for generating high-quality\nUHD images on a resource-constrained device. To alleviate the limitations of\nextremely long-sequence inputs, inspired by the Large Language Model (LLM) for\nprocessing infinitely long texts, we propose a novel learning paradigm to\nachieve UHD multi-exposure dynamic scene image fusion on a single\nconsumer-grade GPU, named Infinite Pixel Learning (IPL). The design of our\napproach comes from three key components: The first step is to slice the input\nsequences to relieve the pressure generated by the model processing the data\nstream; Second, we develop an attention cache technique, which is similar to KV\ncache for infinite data stream processing; Finally, we design a method for\nattention cache compression to alleviate the storage burden of the cache on the\ndevice. In addition, we provide a new UHD benchmark to evaluate the\neffectiveness of our method. Extensive experimental results show that our\nmethod maintains high-quality visual performance while fusing UHD dynamic\nmulti-exposure images in real-time (>40fps) on a single consumer-grade GPU.",

                    "value": "With the continuous improvement of device imaging resolution, the popularity\nof Ultra-High-Definition (UHD) images is increasing. Unfortunately, existing\nmethods for fusing multi-exposure images in dynamic scenes are designed for\nlow-resolution images, which makes them inefficient for generating high-quality\nUHD images on a resource-constrained device. To alleviate the limitations of\nextremely long-sequence inputs, inspired by the Large Language Model (LLM) for\nprocessing infinitely long texts, we propose a novel learning paradigm to\nachieve UHD multi-exposure dynamic scene image fusion on a single\nconsumer-grade GPU, named Infinite Pixel Learning (IPL). The design of our\napproach comes from three key components: The first step is to slice the input\nsequences to relieve the pressure generated by the model processing the data\nstream; Second, we develop an attention cache technique, which is similar to KV\ncache for infinite data stream processing; Finally, we design a method for\nattention cache compression to alleviate the storage burden of the cache on the\ndevice. In addition, we provide a new UHD benchmark to evaluate the\neffectiveness of our method. Extensive experimental results show that our\nmethod maintains high-quality visual performance while fusing UHD dynamic\nmulti-exposure images in real-time (>40fps) on a single consumer-grade GPU."

                    "value": "Streaming coarse-grained reconfgurable array (CGRA) is a promising\narchitecture for data/computing-intensive applications because of its\nfexibility, high throughput and efcient memory system. However,when\naccelerating sparse CNNs, the irregular input data demands inside sparse CNNs\nwould cause excessive caching operations (COPs) and multi-cycle internal\ndependencies (MCIDs) between operations, declining the throughput of the\nstreaming CGRA. We propose a mapping method for sparse CNNs onto streaming\nCGRA, SparseMap, which incorporates an efcient I/O data management along with\noperation scheduling and binding, to reduce the COPs and MCIDs, thereby\nensuring the optimal throughput of streaming CGRA.The experimental results show\nSparseMap reduces 92.5% COPs and 46.0 % MCIDs while achieves the same or even\nsmaller initiation interval (II) compared to previous works."

To address these challenges, optimizations for long-context\ninference have been developed, centered around the KV cache. However, existing\nbenchmarks often evaluate in single-request, neglecting the full lifecycle of\nthe KV cache in real-world use. This oversight is particularly critical, as KV\ncache reuse has become widely adopted in LLMs inference frameworks, such as\nvLLM and SGLang, as well as by LLM providers, including OpenAI, Microsoft,\nGoogle, and Anthropic. To address this gap, we introduce\nSCBench(SharedContextBench), a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating\nlong-context methods from a KV cachecentric perspective: 1) KV cache\ngeneration, 2) KV cache compression, 3) KV cache retrieval, 4) KV cache\nloading. Specifically, SCBench uses test examples with shared context, ranging\n12 tasks with two shared context modes, covering four categories of\nlong-context capabilities: string retrieval, semantic retrieval, global\ninformation, and multi-task. With it, we provide an extensive KV cache-centric\nanalysis of eight categories long-context solutions, including Gated Linear\nRNNs, Mamba-Attention hybrids, and efficient methods such as sparse attention,\nKV cache dropping, quantization, retrieval, loading, and prompt compression.\nThe evaluation is conducted on 8 long-context LLMs. Our findings show that\nsub-O(n) memory methods suffer in multi-turn scenarios, while sparse encoding\nwith O(n) memory and sub-O(n^2) pre-filling computation perform robustly.\nDynamic sparsity yields more expressive KV caches than static patterns, and\nlayer-level sparsity in hybrid architectures reduces memory usage with strong\nperformance.

                "summary": "As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, the demand for higher\nquality and faster processing of long contexts across various applications is\ngrowing. KV cache is widely adopted as it stores previously generated key and\nvalue tokens, effectively reducing redundant computations during inference.\nHowever, as memory overhead becomes a significant concern, efficient\ncompression of KV cache has gained increasing attention. Most existing methods\nperform compression from two perspectives: identifying important tokens and\ndesigning compression strategies. However, these approaches often produce\nbiased distributions of important tokens due to the influence of accumulated\nattention scores or positional encoding. Furthermore, they overlook the\nsparsity and redundancy across different heads, which leads to difficulties in\npreserving the most effective information at the head level.

                    "value": "As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, the demand for higher\nquality and faster processing of long contexts across various applications is\ngrowing. KV cache is widely adopted as it stores previously generated key and\nvalue tokens, effectively reducing redundant computations during inference.\nHowever, as memory overhead becomes a significant concern, efficient\ncompression of KV cache has gained increasing attention. Most existing methods\nperform compression from two perspectives: identifying important tokens and\ndesigning compression strategies. However, these approaches often produce\nbiased distributions of important tokens due to the influence of accumulated\nattention scores or positional encoding. Furthermore, they overlook the\nsparsity and redundancy across different heads, which leads to difficulties in\npreserving the most effective information at the head level.

                "summary": "Long video understanding poses a significant challenge for current\nMulti-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Notably, the MLLMs are constrained\nby their limited context lengths and the substantial costs while processing\nlong videos. Although several existing methods attempt to reduce visual tokens,\ntheir strategies encounter severe bottleneck, restricting MLLMs' ability to\nperceive fine-grained visual details. In this work, we propose Video-XL, a\nnovel approach that leverages MLLMs' inherent key-value (KV) sparsification\ncapacity to condense the visual input. Specifically, we introduce a new special\ntoken, the Visual Summarization Token (VST), for each interval of the video,\nwhich summarizes the visual information within the interval as its associated\nKV. The VST module is trained by instruction fine-tuning, where two optimizing\nstrategies are offered. 1.Curriculum learning, where VST learns to make small\n(easy) and large compression (hard) progressively. 2. Composite data curation,\nwhich integrates single-image, multi-image, and synthetic data to overcome the\nscarcity of long-video instruction data. The compression quality is further\nimproved by dynamic compression, which customizes compression granularity based\non the information density of different video intervals. Video-XL's\neffectiveness is verified from three aspects. First, it achieves a superior\nlong-video understanding capability, outperforming state-of-the-art models of\ncomparable sizes across multiple popular benchmarks. Second, it effectively\npreserves video information, with minimal compression loss even at 16x\ncompression ratio. Third, it realizes outstanding cost-effectiveness, enabling\nhigh-quality processing of thousands of frames on a single A100 GPU.",

In this paper, we introduce MEDEC\n(https://github.com/abachaa/MEDEC), the first publicly available benchmark for\nmedical error detection and correction in clinical notes, covering five types\nof errors (Diagnosis, Management, Treatment, Pharmacotherapy, and Causal\nOrganism).

We also conducted a comparative study where two medical doctors\nperformed the same task on the MEDEC test set. The results showed that MEDEC is\na sufficiently challenging benchmark to assess the ability of models to\nvalidate existing or generated notes and to correct medical errors. We also\nfound that although recent LLMs have a good performance in error detection and\ncorrection, they are still outperformed by medical doctors in these tasks.

While ICRL\ncapabilities have been demonstrated in transformers through task-specific\ntraining, the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) out-of-the-box remains\nlargely unexplored. Recent findings highlight that LLMs often face challenges\nwhen dealing with numerical contexts, and limited attention has been paid to\nevaluating their performance through preference feedback generated by the\nenvironment. This paper is the first to investigate LLMs as in-context\ndecision-makers under the problem of Dueling Bandits (DB), a stateless\npreference-based reinforcement learning setting that extends the classic\nMulti-Armed Bandit (MAB) model by querying for preference feedback. We compare\nGPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4, GPT-4 Turbo, Llama 3.1, and o1-Preview against nine\nwell-established DB algorithms. Our results reveal that our top-performing LLM,\nGPT-4 Turbo, has the zero-shot relative decision-making ability to achieve\nsurprisingly low weak regret across all the DB environment instances by quickly\nincluding the best arm in duels. However, an optimality gap exists between LLMs\nand classic DB algorithms in terms of strong regret. LLMs struggle to converge\nand consistently exploit even when explicitly prompted to do so, and are\nsensitive to prompt variations. To bridge this gap, we propose an agentic flow\nframework: LLM with Enhanced Algorithmic Dueling (LEAD), which integrates\noff-the-shelf DB algorithms with LLM agents through fine-grained adaptive\ninterplay. We show that LEAD has theoretical guarantees inherited from classic\nDB algorithms on both weak and strong regret. We validate its efficacy and\nrobustness even with noisy and adversarial prompts.

After Supervised Fine-tuning and Reinforcement Learning from\nHuman Feedback and AI Feedback, the chat model Baichuan4-Finance is able to\ntackle various financial certification questions and real-world scenario\napplications. We evaluate Baichuan4-Finance on many widely used general\ndatasets and two holistic financial benchmarks. The evaluation results show\nthat Baichuan4-Finance-Base surpasses almost all competitive baselines on\nfinancial tasks by significant margins without sacrificing performance on\ngeneral LLM benchmarks.

Furthermore,\nchallenges in supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from\nhuman feedback (RLHF) led to failures in generating precise,\nhuman-intent-aligned code. To tackle these challenges and improve the code\ngeneration performance for automated programming systems, we propose\nFeedback-driven Adaptive Long/short-term memory reinforced Coding Optimization\n(i.e., FALCON).

At the local level, short-term memory allows for the\nincorporation of immediate feedback from compilers and AI systems.\nAdditionally, we introduce meta-reinforcement learning with feedback rewards to\nsolve the global-local bi-level optimization problem and enhance the model's\nadaptability across diverse code generation tasks. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that our technique achieves state-of-the-art performance, leading\nother reinforcement learning methods by more than 4.5 percentage points on the\nMBPP benchmark and 6.1 percentage points on the Humaneval benchmark.

This paper provides an analysis of\nexisting available research surrounding two AI and biorisk threat models: 1)\naccess to information and planning via large language models (LLMs), and 2) the\nuse of AI-enabled biological tools (BTs) in synthesizing novel biological\nartifacts. We find that existing studies around AI-related biorisk are nascent,\noften speculative in nature, or limited in terms of their methodological\nmaturity and transparency. The available literature suggests that current LLMs\nand BTs do not pose an immediate risk, and more work is needed to develop\nrigorous approaches to understanding how future models could increase biorisks.\nWe end with recommendations about how empirical work can be expanded to more\nprecisely target biorisk and ensure rigor and validity of findings.",

This paper provides an analysis of\nexisting available research surrounding two AI and biorisk threat models: 1)\naccess to information and planning via large language models (LLMs), and 2) the\nuse of AI-enabled biological tools (BTs) in synthesizing novel biological\nartifacts. We find that existing studies around AI-related biorisk are nascent,\noften speculative in nature, or limited in terms of their methodological\nmaturity and transparency. The available literature suggests that current LLMs\nand BTs do not pose an immediate risk, and more work is needed to develop\nrigorous approaches to understanding how future models could increase biorisks.\nWe end with recommendations about how empirical work can be expanded to more\nprecisely target biorisk and ensure rigor and validity of findings."

We\nintroduce the concept of BiasJailbreak, highlighting the inherent risks posed\nby these safety-induced biases. BiasJailbreak generates biased keywords\nautomatically by asking the target LLM itself, and utilizes the keywords to\ngenerate harmful output. Additionally, we propose an efficient defense method\nBiasDefense, which prevents jailbreak attempts by injecting defense prompts\nprior to generation. BiasDefense stands as an appealing alternative to Guard\nModels, such as Llama-Guard, that require additional inference cost after text\ngeneration. Our findings emphasize that ethical biases in LLMs can actually\nlead to generating unsafe output, and suggest a method to make the LLMs more\nsecure and unbiased. To enable further research and improvements, we\nopen-source our code and artifacts of BiasJailbreak, providing the community\nwith tools to better understand and mitigate safety-induced biases in LLMs.",

Understanding the (in)dependence structure allows us to\nsubstantially improve the estimation as it allows for an effective\nfactorization of the probability distribution. In order to estimate the\nprobability distribution of a M dimensional binary vector, we leverage a\nBahadur representation that connects the sparsity of its coefficients with\nindependence across the components. We propose to use regularized and\nadversarial regularized estimators to obtain an adaptive estimator with respect\nto the dependence structure which allows for rates of convergence to depend on\nthis intrinsic (lower) dimension. These estimators are needed to handle several\nchallenges within this setting, including estimating nuisance parameters,\nestimating covariates, and nonseparable moment conditions. Our main results\nconsider the presence of (low dimensional) covariates for which we propose a\nlocally penalized estimator. We provide pointwise rates of convergence\naddressing several issues in the theoretical analyses as we strive for making a\ncomputationally tractable formulation. We apply our results in the estimation\nof causal effects with multiple binary treatments and show how our estimators\ncan improve the finite sample performance when compared with non-adaptive\nestimators that try to estimate all the probabilities directly.

However, the\nintegral character of these observables together with our position inside the\nGalaxy makes the inference of the coherent Galactic magnetic field (GMF)\ncomplicated and ambiguous. We combine several phenomenological components of\nthe GMF -- the spiral arms, the toroidal halo, the X-shaped field and the field\nof the Local Bubble -- to construct a new model of the regular GMF outside the\nthin disk. To have control over the relative contributions of the RM and\npolarization data to the fit we pay special attention to the estimation of\nerrors in data bins. To this end we develop a systematic method which is\nuniformly applicable to different data sets. This method takes into account\nindividual measurement errors, the variance in the bin as well as fluctuations\nin the data at angular scales larger than the bin size. This leads to decrease\nof the errors and, as a result, to better sensitivity of the data to the model\ncontent. We cross checked the stability of our method with the new LOFAR data.\nWe found that the four components listed above are sufficient to fit both the\nRM and polarization data over the whole sky with only a small fraction masked\nout. Moreover, we have achieved several important improvements compared to\nprevious approaches. Due to account of our location inside of the Local Bubble\nour model does not require introduction of striated fields. For the first time\nwe showed that the Fan Region can be modeled as a Galactic-scale feature. The\npitch angle of the magnetic field in our fit converged to the value around 20\ndegrees. Interestingly, with value is very close to the direction of the arms\ninferred recently from Gaia data on upper main sequence stars.",

However, the\nintegral character of these observables together with our position inside the\nGalaxy makes the inference of the coherent Galactic magnetic field (GMF)\ncomplicated and ambiguous. We combine several phenomenological components of\nthe GMF -- the spiral arms, the toroidal halo, the X-shaped field and the field\nof the Local Bubble -- to construct a new model of the regular GMF outside the\nthin disk. To have control over the relative contributions of the RM and\npolarization data to the fit we pay special attention to the estimation of\nerrors in data bins. To this end we develop a systematic method which is\nuniformly applicable to different data sets. This method takes into account\nindividual measurement errors, the variance in the bin as well as fluctuations\nin the data at angular scales larger than the bin size. This leads to decrease\nof the errors and, as a result, to better sensitivity of the data to the model\ncontent. We cross checked the stability of our method with the new LOFAR data.\nWe found that the four components listed above are sufficient to fit both the\nRM and polarization data over the whole sky with only a small fraction masked\nout. Moreover, we have achieved several important improvements compared to\nprevious approaches. Due to account of our location inside of the Local Bubble\nour model does not require introduction of striated fields. For the first time\nwe showed that the Fan Region can be modeled as a Galactic-scale feature. The\npitch angle of the magnetic field in our fit converged to the value around 20\ndegrees. Interestingly, with value is very close to the direction of the arms\ninferred recently from Gaia data on upper main sequence stars."

Through extensive experiments on two mathematical\nreasoning benchmarks, namely GSM8k and MATH, we reveal the extraordinary\ncapabilities of our model. Remarkably, WizardMath-Mistral 7B surpasses top-tier\nopen-source LLMs by a substantial margin with higher data efficiency.\nFurthermore, WizardMath 70B even outperforms GPT-3.5-Turbo, Claude 2, Gemini\nPro and GPT-4-early-version. Additionally, our preliminary exploration\nhighlights the pivotal role of instruction evolution and process supervision in\nachieving exceptional math performance.

However, most existing open-source models are only\npre-trained on large-scale internet data and without math-related optimization.\nIn this paper, we present WizardMath, which enhances the mathematical CoT\nreasoning abilities of LLMs without using external python tools, by applying\nour proposed Reinforcement Learning from Evol-Instruct Feedback (RLEIF) method\nto the domain of math. Through extensive experiments on two mathematical\nreasoning benchmarks, namely GSM8k and MATH, we reveal the extraordinary\ncapabilities of our model. Remarkably, WizardMath-Mistral 7B surpasses top-tier\nopen-source LLMs by a substantial margin with higher data efficiency.\nFurthermore, WizardMath 70B even outperforms GPT-3.5-Turbo, Claude 2, Gemini\nPro and GPT-4-early-version. Additionally, our preliminary exploration\nhighlights the pivotal role of instruction evolution and process supervision in\nachieving exceptional math performance.

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly\napplied to time series tasks, leveraging their strong language capabilities to\nenhance various applications. However, research on multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) for\ntime series understanding and reasoning remains limited, primarily due to the\nscarcity of high-quality datasets that align time series with textual\ninformation. This paper introduces ChatTS, a novel MLLM designed for time\nseries analysis. ChatTS treats time series as a modality, similar to how vision\nMLLMs process images, enabling it to perform both understanding and reasoning\nwith time series. To address the scarcity of training data, we propose an\nattribute-based method for generating synthetic time series with detailed\nattribute descriptions. We further introduce Time Series Evol-Instruct, a novel\napproach that generates diverse time series Q&As, enhancing the model's\nreasoning capabilities. To the best of our knowledge, ChatTS is the first\nTS-MLLM that takes multivariate time series as input for understanding and\nreasoning, which is fine-tuned exclusively on synthetic datasets. We evaluate\nits performance using benchmark datasets with real-world data, including six\nalignment tasks and four reasoning tasks. Our results show that ChatTS\nsignificantly outperforms existing vision-based MLLMs (e.g., GPT-4o) and\ntext/agent-based LLMs, achieving a 46.0% improvement in alignment tasks and a\n25.8% improvement in reasoning tasks.",

However, by default, they tend to generate \"average\" language\nwithout reflecting the ways in which people differ. Here, we propose a\nlightweight modification to the standard language model transformer\narchitecture - \"PsychAdapter\" - that uses empirically derived trait-language\npatterns to generate natural language for specified personality, demographic,\nand mental health characteristics (with or without prompting). We applied\nPsychAdapters to modify OpenAI's GPT-2, Google's Gemma, and Meta's Llama 3 and\nfound generated text to reflect the desired traits. For example, expert raters\nevaluated PsychAdapter's generated text output and found it matched intended\ntrait levels with 87.3% average accuracy for Big Five personalities, and 96.7%\nfor depression and life satisfaction. PsychAdapter is a novel method to\nintroduce psychological behavior patterns into language models at the\nfoundation level, independent of prompting, by influencing every transformer\nlayer. This approach can create chatbots with specific personality profiles,\nclinical training tools that mirror language associated with psychological\nconditionals, and machine translations that match an authors reading or\neducation level without taking up LLM context windows. PsychAdapter also allows\nfor the exploration psychological constructs through natural language\nexpression, extending the natural language processing toolkit to study human\npsychology.",

Unlike copilot systems, which primarily rely on users\nto provide essential state information (e.g., task descriptions) and assist\nusers by answering questions or auto-completing contents, autopilot systems\nmust complete tasks from start to finish independently, which requires the\nsystem to acquire the state information from the environments actively.

Existing learning-based\nNLOS methods usually train independent models for different light transport\nconditions, which is computationally inefficient and impairs the practicality\nof the models. In this work, we propose NLOS-LTM, a novel passive NLOS imaging\nmethod that effectively handles multiple light transport conditions with a\nsingle network. We achieve this by inferring a latent light transport\nrepresentation from the projection image and using this representation to\nmodulate the network that reconstructs the hidden image from the projection\nimage. We train a light transport encoder together with a vector quantizer to\nobtain the light transport representation. To further regulate this\nrepresentation, we jointly learn both the reconstruction network and the\nreprojection network during training. A set of light transport modulation\nblocks is used to modulate the two jointly trained networks in a multi-scale\nway.

This task provides precise control over\ndetails that text alone cannot capture and is fundamental for various\nreal-world applications, garnering significant interest from academia and\nindustry. Existing works follow the pseudo-word paradigm, which involves\nrepresenting given subjects as pseudo-words and combining them with given texts\nto collectively guide the generation. However, the inherent conflict and\nentanglement between the pseudo-words and texts result in a dual-optimum\nparadox, where subject similarity and text controllability cannot be optimal\nsimultaneously. We propose a novel real-words paradigm termed RealCustom++ that\ninstead represents subjects as non-conflict real words, thereby disentangling\nsubject similarity from text controllability and allowing both to be optimized\nsimultaneously. Specifically, RealCustom++ introduces a novel \"train-inference\"\ndecoupled framework: (1) During training, RealCustom++ learns the alignment\nbetween vision conditions and all real words in the text, ensuring high\nsubject-similarity generation in open domains. This is achieved by the\ncross-layer cross-scale projector to robustly and finely extract subject\nfeatures, and a curriculum training recipe that adapts the generated subject to\ndiverse poses and sizes. (2) During inference, leveraging the learned general\nalignment, an adaptive mask guidance is proposed to only customize the\ngeneration of the specific target real word, keeping other subject-irrelevant\nregions uncontaminated to ensure high text-controllability in real-time.",

Existing works follow the pseudo-word paradigm, which involves\nrepresenting given subjects as pseudo-words and combining them with given texts\nto collectively guide the generation. However, the inherent conflict and\nentanglement between the pseudo-words and texts result in a dual-optimum\nparadox, where subject similarity and text controllability cannot be optimal\nsimultaneously. We propose a novel real-words paradigm termed RealCustom++ that\ninstead represents subjects as non-conflict real words, thereby disentangling\nsubject similarity from text controllability and allowing both to be optimized\nsimultaneously. Specifically, RealCustom++ introduces a novel \"train-inference\"\ndecoupled framework: (1) During training, RealCustom++ learns the alignment\nbetween vision conditions and all real words in the text, ensuring high\nsubject-similarity generation in open domains. This is achieved by the\ncross-layer cross-scale projector to robustly and finely extract subject\nfeatures, and a curriculum training recipe that adapts the generated subject to\ndiverse poses and sizes. (2) During inference, leveraging the learned general\nalignment, an adaptive mask guidance is proposed to only customize the\ngeneration of the specific target real word, keeping other subject-irrelevant\nregions uncontaminated to ensure high text-controllability in real-time."

However, their ability to comprehend\nand analyze hybrid text, containing textual and tabular data, remains\nunexplored. The hybrid text often appears in the form of hybrid long documents\n(HLDs), which far exceed the token limit of LLMs. Consequently, we apply an\nAutomated Information Extraction framework (AIE) to enable LLMs to process the\nHLDs and carry out experiments to analyse four important aspects of information\nextraction from HLDs. Given the findings: 1) The effective way to select and\nsummarize the useful part of a HLD. 2) An easy table serialization way is\nenough for LLMs to understand tables. 3) The naive AIE has adaptability in many\ncomplex scenarios. 4) The useful prompt engineering to enhance LLMs on HLDs.

However, their ability to comprehend\nand analyze hybrid text, containing textual and tabular data, remains\nunexplored. The hybrid text often appears in the form of hybrid long documents\n(HLDs), which far exceed the token limit of LLMs. Consequently, we apply an\nAutomated Information Extraction framework (AIE) to enable LLMs to process the\nHLDs and carry out experiments to analyse four important aspects of information\nextraction from HLDs. Given the findings: 1) The effective way to select and\nsummarize the useful part of a HLD. 2) An easy table serialization way is\nenough for LLMs to understand tables. 3) The naive AIE has adaptability in many\ncomplex scenarios. 4) The useful prompt engineering to enhance LLMs on HLDs.

Our methods achieve SOTA results on $\\mathbf{7}$\nout of $\\mathbf{9}$ diverse reasoning benchmarks. We also show that model\nfaithfulness positively correlates with overall performance and further\ndemonstrate that $\\textbf{FLARE}$ allows pinpointing the decisive factors\nsufficient for and leading to the correct answer with optimal reasoning during\nthe multi-hop search."

Our approach employs advanced neural network\narchitectures with equivariant filters, overcoming the limitations of current\nmodels that require iterative inference or retraining for new image modalities.\nUniMo enables one-time training on a single modality while maintaining high\nstability and adaptability for inference across multiple unseen image\nmodalities. We developed a joint learning framework that integrates multimodal\nknowledge from both shape and images that faithfully improve motion correction\naccuracy despite image appearance variations. UniMo features a geometric\ndeformation augmenter that enhances the robustness of global motion correction\nby addressing any local deformations whether they are caused by object\ndeformations or geometric distortions, and also generates augmented data to\nimprove the training process. Our experimental results, conducted on various\ndatasets with four different image modalities, demonstrate that UniMo surpasses\nexisting motion correction methods in terms of accuracy. By offering a\ncomprehensive solution to motion correction, UniMo marks a significant\nadvancement in medical imaging, especially in challenging applications with\nwide ranges of motion, such as fetal imaging.

                    "value": "In this paper, we introduce a Universal Motion Correction (UniMo) framework,\nleveraging deep neural networks to tackle the challenges of motion correction\nacross diverse imaging modalities. Our approach employs advanced neural network\narchitectures with equivariant filters, overcoming the limitations of current\nmodels that require iterative inference or retraining for new image modalities.\nUniMo enables one-time training on a single modality while maintaining high\nstability and adaptability for inference across multiple unseen image\nmodalities. We developed a joint learning framework that integrates multimodal\nknowledge from both shape and images that faithfully improve motion correction\naccuracy despite image appearance variations. UniMo features a geometric\ndeformation augmenter that enhances the robustness of global motion correction\nby addressing any local deformations whether they are caused by object\ndeformations or geometric distortions, and also generates augmented data to\nimprove the training process. Our experimental results, conducted on various\ndatasets with four different image modalities, demonstrate that UniMo surpasses\nexisting motion correction methods in terms of accuracy. By offering a\ncomprehensive solution to motion correction, UniMo marks a significant\nadvancement in medical imaging, especially in challenging applications with\nwide ranges of motion, such as fetal imaging.

In this paper, we introduce MEDEC\n(https://github.com/abachaa/MEDEC), the first publicly available benchmark for\nmedical error detection and correction in clinical notes, covering five types\nof errors (Diagnosis, Management, Treatment, Pharmacotherapy, and Causal\nOrganism). MEDEC consists of 3,848 clinical texts, including 488 clinical notes\nfrom three US hospital systems that were not previously seen by any LLM. The\ndataset has been used for the MEDIQA-CORR shared task to evaluate seventeen\nparticipating systems [Ben Abacha et al., 2024]. In this paper, we describe the\ndata creation methods and we evaluate recent LLMs (e.g., o1-preview, GPT-4,\nClaude 3.5 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.0 Flash) for the tasks of detecting and\ncorrecting medical errors requiring both medical knowledge and reasoning\ncapabilities. We also conducted a comparative study where two medical doctors\nperformed the same task on the MEDEC test set. The results showed that MEDEC is\na sufficiently challenging benchmark to assess the ability of models to\nvalidate existing or generated notes and to correct medical errors. We also\nfound that although recent LLMs have a good performance in error detection and\ncorrection, they are still outperformed by medical doctors in these tasks.

Next, we create a ground-truth dataset consisting of 133 human\nand 137 bot addresses. Third, we employ both unsupervised and supervised\nmachine learning algorithms to detect bots deployed on Ethereum. The\nhighest-performing clustering algorithm is a Gaussian Mixture Model with an\naverage cluster purity of 82.6%, while the highest-performing model for binary\nclassification is a Random Forest with an accuracy of 83%.

First,\nwe systematize existing scientific literature and collect anecdotal evidence to\nestablish a taxonomy for financial bots, comprising 7 categories and 24\nsubcategories. Next, we create a ground-truth dataset consisting of 133 human\nand 137 bot addresses. Third, we employ both unsupervised and supervised\nmachine learning algorithms to detect bots deployed on Ethereum. The\nhighest-performing clustering algorithm is a Gaussian Mixture Model with an\naverage cluster purity of 82.6%, while the highest-performing model for binary\nclassification is a Random Forest with an accuracy of 83%. Our machine\nlearning-based detection mechanism contributes to understanding the Ethereum\necosystem dynamics by providing additional insights into the current bot\nlandscape."

Furthermore,\nchallenges in supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from\nhuman feedback (RLHF) led to failures in generating precise,\nhuman-intent-aligned code. To tackle these challenges and improve the code\ngeneration performance for automated programming systems, we propose\nFeedback-driven Adaptive Long/short-term memory reinforced Coding Optimization\n(i.e., FALCON). FALCON is structured into two hierarchical levels. From the\nglobal level, long-term memory improves code quality by retaining and applying\nlearned knowledge. At the local level, short-term memory allows for the\nincorporation of immediate feedback from compilers and AI systems.\nAdditionally, we introduce meta-reinforcement learning with feedback rewards to\nsolve the global-local bi-level optimization problem and enhance the model's\nadaptability across diverse code generation tasks. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that our technique achieves state-of-the-art performance, leading\nother reinforcement learning methods by more than 4.5 percentage points on the\nMBPP benchmark and 6.1 percentage points on the Humaneval benchmark.

In this paper, we delve into the ethical biases in LLMs and\nexamine how those biases could be exploited for jailbreaks. Notably, these\nbiases result in a jailbreaking success rate in GPT-4o models that differs by\n20\\% between non-binary and cisgender keywords and by 16\\% between white and\nblack keywords, even when the other parts of the prompts are identical. We\nintroduce the concept of BiasJailbreak, highlighting the inherent risks posed\nby these safety-induced biases. BiasJailbreak generates biased keywords\nautomatically by asking the target LLM itself, and utilizes the keywords to\ngenerate harmful output. Additionally, we propose an efficient defense method\nBiasDefense, which prevents jailbreak attempts by injecting defense prompts\nprior to generation. BiasDefense stands as an appealing alternative to Guard\nModels, such as Llama-Guard, that require additional inference cost after text\ngeneration. Our findings emphasize that ethical biases in LLMs can actually\nlead to generating unsafe output, and suggest a method to make the LLMs more\nsecure and unbiased.

Human-AI teaming is an important paradigm for studying various aspects\nwhen humans and AI agents work together.

To address the above problems, we propose a new benchmark called\nMLVU (Multi-task Long Video Understanding Benchmark) for the comprehensive and\nin-depth evaluation of LVU. MLVU presents the following critical values:\n\\textit{1)} The substantial and flexible extension of video lengths, which\nenables the benchmark to evaluate LVU performance across a wide range of\ndurations. \\textit{2)} The inclusion of various video genres, e.g., movies,\nsurveillance footage, egocentric videos, cartoons, game videos, etc., which\nreflects the models' LVU performances in different scenarios. \\textit{3)} The\ndevelopment of diversified evaluation tasks, which enables a comprehensive\nexamination of MLLMs' key abilities in long-video understanding. The empirical\nstudy with 23 latest MLLMs reveals significant room for improvement in today's\ntechnique, as all existing methods struggle with most of the evaluation tasks\nand exhibit severe performance degradation when handling longer videos.\nAdditionally, it suggests that factors such as context length,\nimage-understanding ability, and the choice of LLM backbone can play critical\nroles in future advancements.

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly\napplied to time series tasks, leveraging their strong language capabilities to\nenhance various applications.

This paper introduces ChatTS, a novel MLLM designed for time\nseries analysis. ChatTS treats time series as a modality, similar to how vision\nMLLMs process images, enabling it to perform both understanding and reasoning\nwith time series. To address the scarcity of training data, we propose an\nattribute-based method for generating synthetic time series with detailed\nattribute descriptions. We further introduce Time Series Evol-Instruct, a novel\napproach that generates diverse time series Q&As, enhancing the model's\nreasoning capabilities. To the best of our knowledge, ChatTS is the first\nTS-MLLM that takes multivariate time series as input for understanding and\nreasoning, which is fine-tuned exclusively on synthetic datasets. We evaluate\nits performance using benchmark datasets with real-world data, including six\nalignment tasks and four reasoning tasks.

We applied\nPsychAdapters to modify OpenAI's GPT-2, Google's Gemma, and Meta's Llama 3 and\nfound generated text to reflect the desired traits. For example, expert raters\nevaluated PsychAdapter's generated text output and found it matched intended\ntrait levels with 87.3% average accuracy for Big Five personalities, and 96.7%\nfor depression and life satisfaction. PsychAdapter is a novel method to\nintroduce psychological behavior patterns into language models at the\nfoundation level, independent of prompting, by influencing every transformer\nlayer. This approach can create chatbots with specific personality profiles,\nclinical training tools that mirror language associated with psychological\nconditionals, and machine translations that match an authors reading or\neducation level without taking up LLM context windows. PsychAdapter also allows\nfor the exploration psychological constructs through natural language\nexpression, extending the natural language processing toolkit to study human\npsychology.",

Deep learning models can\noften misidentify OOD samples as in-distribution (ID) samples. This\nvulnerability worsens in the presence of spurious correlation in the training\nset.

In the era of ubiquitous\nconnectivity, leveraging communication networks to distribute intelligence is a\ntransformative concept, envisioning AI-powered services accessible at the\nnetwork edge. However, pushing large models from the cloud to\nresource-constrained environments faces critical challenges. Model inference on\nlow-end devices leads to excessive latency and performance bottlenecks, while\nraw data transmission over limited bandwidth networks causes high communication\noverhead. This article presents AI Flow, a framework that streamlines the\ninference process by jointly leveraging the heterogeneous resources available\nacross devices, edge nodes, and cloud servers, making intelligence flow across\nnetworks.

In the era of ubiquitous\nconnectivity, leveraging communication networks to distribute intelligence is a\ntransformative concept, envisioning AI-powered services accessible at the\nnetwork edge. However, pushing large models from the cloud to\nresource-constrained environments faces critical challenges. Model inference on\nlow-end devices leads to excessive latency and performance bottlenecks, while\nraw data transmission over limited bandwidth networks causes high communication\noverhead.

Our end-to-end\nsystem harnesses the power of LLMs to generate symbolic music in the form of\nMIDI files. Specifically, we utilize a pretrained LLM encoder to process\ncaptions, which then condition an autoregressive transformer decoder to produce\nMIDI sequences that accurately reflect the provided descriptions. This\nintuitive and user-friendly method significantly streamlines the music creation\nprocess by allowing users to generate music pieces using text prompts. We\nconduct comprehensive empirical evaluations, incorporating both automated and\nhuman studies, that show our model generates MIDI files of high quality that\nare indeed controllable by text captions that may include music theory terms\nsuch as chords, keys, and tempo.

This\npaper proposes RetrievalAttention, a training-free approach to both accelerate\nattention computation and reduce GPU memory consumption. By leveraging the\ndynamic sparsity of attention mechanism, RetrievalAttention proposes to build\napproximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) indexes for KV vectors in CPU memory\nand retrieve the most relevant ones through vector search during generation.\nUnfortunately, we observe that the off-the-shelf ANNS indexes are often\nineffective for such retrieval tasks due to the out-of-distribution (OOD)\nbetween query vectors and key vectors in the attention mechanism.\nRetrievalAttention addresses the OOD challenge by designing an attention-aware\nvector search algorithm that can adapt to the distribution of query vectors.\nOur evaluation demonstrates that RetrievalAttention achieves near full\nattention accuracy while only requiring access to 1--3% of the data.

Overall, we have developed and publicly share\nPyTomography, a highly optimized and user-friendly software for medical image\nreconstruction, with a class hierarchy that fosters the development of novel\nimaging applications."

In this work, we propose to leverage a multilingual Large Language\nModel (LLM) to perform ST and ASR in languages for which the model has never\nseen paired audio-text data. We achieve this by using a pre-trained\nmultilingual speech encoder, a multilingual LLM, and a lightweight adaptation\nmodule that maps the audio representations to the token embedding space of the\nLLM.

In this work, we propose to leverage a multilingual Large Language\nModel (LLM) to perform ST and ASR in languages for which the model has never\nseen paired audio-text data. We achieve this by using a pre-trained\nmultilingual speech encoder, a multilingual LLM, and a lightweight adaptation\nmodule that maps the audio representations to the token embedding space of the\nLLM.

This collaborative approach\nresults in improved responses to user prompts compared to relying on a single\nLLM. In this paper, we consider such an MoA architecture in a distributed\nsetting, where LLMs operate on individual edge devices, each uniquely\nassociated with a user and equipped with its own distributed computing power.\nThese devices exchange information using decentralized gossip algorithms,\nallowing different device nodes to talk without the supervision of a\ncentralized server. In the considered setup, different users have their own LLM\nmodels to address user prompts. Additionally, the devices gossip either their\nown user-specific prompts or augmented prompts to generate more refined answers\nto certain queries. User prompts are temporarily stored in the device queues\nwhen their corresponding LLMs are busy. Given the memory limitations of edge\ndevices, it is crucial to ensure that the average queue sizes in the system\nremain bounded. In this paper, we address this by theoretically calculating the\nqueuing stability conditions for the device queues under reasonable\nassumptions, which we validate experimentally as well. Further, we demonstrate\nthrough experiments, leveraging open-source LLMs for the implementation of\ndistributed MoA, that certain MoA configurations produce higher-quality\nresponses compared to others, as evaluated on AlpacaEval 2.0 benchmark.

Language agents are promising for\nautomating intellectual tasks in science because they can interact with tools\nvia natural language or code. Yet their flexibility creates conceptual and\npractical challenges for software implementations, since agents may comprise\nnon-standard components such as internal reasoning, planning, tool usage, as\nwell as the inherent stochasticity of temperature-sampled language models.\nHere, we introduce Aviary, an extensible gymnasium for language agents.

Yet their flexibility creates conceptual and\npractical challenges for software implementations, since agents may comprise\nnon-standard components such as internal reasoning, planning, tool usage, as\nwell as the inherent stochasticity of temperature-sampled language models.\nHere, we introduce Aviary, an extensible gymnasium for language agents.

In this paper, we introduce DRT-o1, an\nattempt to bring the success of long CoT to neural machine translation (MT).\nSpecifically, in view of the literature books that might involve similes and\nmetaphors, translating these texts to a target language is very difficult in\npractice due to cultural differences. In such cases, literal translation often\nfails to convey the intended meaning effectively. Even for professional human\ntranslators, considerable thought must be given to preserving semantics\nthroughout the translation process. To simulate LLMs' long thought ability in\nMT, we first mine sentences containing similes or metaphors from existing\nliterature books, and then develop a multi-agent framework to translate these\nsentences via long thought. In the multi-agent framework, a translator is used\nto iteratively translate the source sentence under the suggestions provided by\nan advisor. To ensure the effectiveness of the long thoughts, an evaluator is\nalso employed to quantify the translation in each round. In this way, we\ncollect tens of thousands of long-thought MT data, which is used to train our\nDRT-o1. Using Qwen2.5 and LLama-3.1 as the backbones, DRT-o1 models can learn\nthe thought process during machine translation, and outperform vanilla LLMs as\nwell as existing O1-like LLMs, showing their effectiveness The project is\navailable at https://github.com/krystalan/DRT-o1",

To address this, we propose CLAP-Ranked Preference\nOptimization (CRPO), a novel framework that iteratively generates and optimizes\npreference data to enhance TTA alignment. We demonstrate that the audio\npreference dataset generated using CRPO outperforms existing alternatives. With\nthis framework, TangoFlux achieves state-of-the-art performance across both\nobjective and subjective benchmarks.

To address these challenges, we propose Knowledge graph Assisted\nReasoning Path Aggregation (KARPA), a novel framework that harnesses the global\nplanning abilities of LLMs for efficient and accurate KG reasoning. KARPA\noperates in three steps: pre-planning relation paths using the LLM's global\nplanning capabilities, matching semantically relevant paths via an embedding\nmodel, and reasoning over these paths to generate answers. Unlike existing KGQA\nmethods, KARPA avoids stepwise traversal, requires no additional training, and\nis adaptable to various LLM architectures. Extensive experimental results show\nthat KARPA achieves state-of-the-art performance in KGQA tasks, delivering both\nhigh efficiency and accuracy. Our code will be available on Github.",

However, their substantial sizes\npose considerable challenges, particularly in computational demands and\ninference speed, due to their quadratic complexity. In this work, we have\nidentified a key pattern: certain seemingly meaningless special tokens (i.e.,\nseparators) contribute disproportionately to attention scores compared to\nsemantically meaningful tokens. This observation suggests that information of\nthe segments between these separator tokens can be effectively condensed into\nthe separator tokens themselves without significant information loss. Guided by\nthis insight, we introduce SepLLM, a plug-and-play framework that accelerates\ninference by compressing these segments and eliminating redundant tokens.\nAdditionally, we implement efficient kernels for training acceleration.\nExperimental results across training-free, training-from-scratch, and\npost-training settings demonstrate SepLLM's effectiveness. Notably, using the\nLlama-3-8B backbone, SepLLM achieves over 50% reduction in KV cache on the\nGSM8K-CoT benchmark while maintaining comparable performance.

The large bandwidth, array\nantennas, and non-stationarity caused by high mobility has made 5G-R channel\ncharacterization more complex. Therefore, it is essential to develop an\naccurate channel model for 5G-R. However, researches on channel\ncharacterization and time-variant models specific to 5G-R frequency bands and\nscenarios is scarce. There are virtually no cluster-based time-variant channel\nmodels that capture statistical properties of 5G-R channel. In this paper, we\npropose a cluster-based time-variant channel model for 5G-R within an enhanced\n3GPP framework, which incorporates time evolution features. Extensive channel\nmeasurements are conducted on 5G-R private network test line in China. We then\nextract and analyze typical channel fading characteristics and multipath\ncluster characteristics. Furthermore, birth-death process of the clusters is\nmodeled by using a four-state Markov chain. Finally, a generalized clustered\ndelay line (CDL) model is established in accordance with 3GPP standard and\nvalidated by comparing the results of measurements and simulations. This work\nenhances the understanding of 5G-R channels and presents a flexible\ncluster-based time-variant channel model. The results can be used in the\ndesign, deployment, and optimization of 5G-R networks.",
