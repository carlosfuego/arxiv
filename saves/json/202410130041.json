Yet, the security of such\narchitectures has not been thoroughly explored. The adoption of PiM solutions\nprovides a new way to directly access main memory, which malicious user\napplications can exploit. We show that this new way to access main memory opens\nopportunities for high-throughput timing attacks that are hard-to-mitigate\nwithout significant performance overhead.\n  We introduce IMPACT, a set of high-throughput main memory-based timing\nattacks that leverage characteristics of PiM architectures to establish covert\nand side channels. IMPACT enables high-throughput communication and private\ninformation leakage by exploiting the shared DRAM row buffer. To achieve high\nthroughput, IMPACT (i) eliminates cache bypassing steps required by\nprocessor-centric main memory and cache-based timing attacks and (ii) leverages\nthe intrinsic parallelism of PiM operations. We showcase two applications of\nIMPACT. First, we build two covert-channel attacks that run on the host CPU and\nleverage different PiM approaches to gain direct and fast access to main memory\nand establish high-throughput communication covert channels. Second, we\nshowcase a side-channel attack that leaks private information of concurrently\nrunning victim applications that are accelerated with PiM. Our results\ndemonstrate that (i) our covert channels achieve 12.87 Mb/s and 14.16 Mb/s\ncommunication throughput, respectively, which is up to 4.91x and 5.41x faster\nthan the state-of-the-art main memory-based covert channels, and (ii) our\nside-channel attack allows the attacker to leak secrets with a low error rate.\nTo avoid such covert and side channels in emerging PiM systems, we propose and\nevaluate three defenses.",

To solve this problem, we propose a\ntwo-folded strategy.

Our voxel structure only\nkeeps track of a predetermined set of statistics for points that lie inside it.\nThis method reduces the runtime complexity from $O(MN)$ to $O(N)$ and the space\ncomplexity from $O(N)$ to $O(1)$ where $M$ is the number of iterations and $N$\nis the number of points. Second, to further minimize memory usage and enhance\nmapping accuracy, we provide a strategy to dynamically merge voxels associated\nwith the same physical planes by taking advantage of the geometric features in\nthe real world. Rather than scanning for these coalescible voxels constantly at\nevery iteration, our merging strategy accumulates voxels in a\nlocality-sensitive hash and triggers merging lazily. On-demand merging not only\nreduces memory footprint with minimal computational overhead but also improves\nlocalization accuracy thanks to cross-voxel denoising.

                "summary": "Optimizing the Key-Value (KV) cache of the Large Language Model (LLM) has\nbeen considered critical to saving the cost of inference. Most of the existing\nKV-cache compression algorithms attempted to sparsify the sequence of tokens by\ntaking advantage of the different importance of tokens.

This paper identifies that the sharp rise in TTFT as\ncontext length increases is predominantly driven by queuing delays, which are\ncaused by the growing demands for GPU Key-Value (KV) cache allocation clashing\nwith the limited availability of KV cache blocks. To address this issue, we\npropose LayerKV, a simple yet effective plug-in method that effectively reduces\nTTFT without requiring additional hardware or compromising output performance,\nwhile seamlessly integrating with existing parallelism strategies and\nscheduling techniques. Specifically, LayerKV introduces layer-wise KV block\nallocation, management, and offloading for fine-grained control over system\nmemory, coupled with an SLO-aware scheduler to optimize overall Service Level\nObjectives (SLOs). Comprehensive evaluations on representative models, ranging\nfrom 7B to 70B parameters, across various GPU configurations, demonstrate that\nLayerKV improves TTFT latency up to 69x and reduces SLO violation rates by\n28.7%, significantly enhancing the user experience.",

                    "value": "The expanding context windows in large language models (LLMs) have greatly\nenhanced their capabilities in various applications, but they also introduce\nsignificant challenges in maintaining low latency, particularly in Time to\nFirst Token (TTFT). This paper identifies that the sharp rise in TTFT as\ncontext length increases is predominantly driven by queuing delays, which are\ncaused by the growing demands for GPU Key-Value (KV) cache allocation clashing\nwith the limited availability of KV cache blocks. To address this issue, we\npropose LayerKV, a simple yet effective plug-in method that effectively reduces\nTTFT without requiring additional hardware or compromising output performance,\nwhile seamlessly integrating with existing parallelism strategies and\nscheduling techniques. Specifically, LayerKV introduces layer-wise KV block\nallocation, management, and offloading for fine-grained control over system\nmemory, coupled with an SLO-aware scheduler to optimize overall Service Level\nObjectives (SLOs). Comprehensive evaluations on representative models, ranging\nfrom 7B to 70B parameters, across various GPU configurations, demonstrate that\nLayerKV improves TTFT latency up to 69x and reduces SLO violation rates by\n28.7%, significantly enhancing the user experience."

Increasing costs may lead to fewer independently\noperated nodes in the network, which poses risks to decentralization (and hence\nnetwork security), but also pushes decentralized app developers towards\ncentrally hosted API services.\n  This paper introduces a new protocol that allows validator nodes to\nparticipate in a blockchain network without the need to store the full state of\nthe network on each node. The key idea is to use the blockchain network as both\na replicated state machine and as a distributed storage system. By distributing\nstates across nodes and enabling efficient data retrieval through a\nKademlia-inspired routing protocol, we reduce storage costs for validators.\nCryptographic proofs (such as Merkle proofs) are used to allow nodes to verify\ndata stored by other nodes without having to trust those nodes directly. While\nthe protocol trades off data storage for increased network bandwidth, we show\nhow gossiping and caching can minimize the increased bandwidth needs.\n  To validate our state sharing protocol, we conduct an extensive quantitative\nanalysis of Ethereum's data storage and data access patterns. Our findings\nindicate that while our protocol significantly lowers storage needs, it comes\nwith an increased bandwidth usage ranging from 1.5 MB to 5 MB per block,\ntranslating to an additional monthly bandwidth of 319 GB to 1,065 GB. Despite\nthis, the size remains small enough such that it can be passed to all nodes and\nvalidated within Ethereum's 12-second block validation window.

However, scaling the\ngeneration inference of LLMs to such long contexts incurs significant\nadditional computation load, and demands a substantial GPU memory footprint to\nmaintain the key-value (KV) cache of transformer-based LLMs. Existing KV cache\ncompression methods, such as quantization, face memory bottlenecks as context\nlength increases, while static-sized caches, such as eviction, suffer from\ninefficient policies. These limitations restrict deployment on consumer-grade\ndevices like a single Nvidia 4090 GPU. To overcome this, we propose Locret, a\nframework for long-context LLM inference that introduces retaining heads to\nevaluate the causal importance of KV cache units, allowing for more accurate\neviction within a fixed cache size. Locret is fine-tuned on top of the frozen\nbackbone LLM using a minimal amount of data from standard long-context SFT\ndatasets. During inference, we evict low-importance cache units along with a\nchunked prefill pattern, significantly reducing peak GPU memory usage. We\nconduct an extensive empirical study to evaluate Locret, where the experimental\nresults show that Locret outperforms the recent competitive approaches,\nincluding InfLLM, Quantization, SirLLM, and MInference, in terms of memory\nefficiency and the quality of generated contents -- Locret achieves over a 20x\nand 8x KV cache compression ratio compared to the full KV cache for\nPhi-3-mini-128K and Llama-3.1-8B-instruct. Additionally, Locret can be combined\nwith other methods, such as quantization and token merging. To our knowledge,\nLocret is the first framework capable of deploying Llama-3.1-8B or similar\nmodels on a single Nvidia 4090 GPU, enabling 128K long-context inference\nwithout compromising generation quality, and requiring little additional system\noptimizations.",

                "summary": "Training and serving long-context large language models (LLMs) incurs\nsubstantial overhead. To address this, two critical steps are often required: a\npretrained LLM typically undergoes a separate stage for context length\nextension by training on long-context data, followed by architectural\nmodifications to reduce the overhead of KV cache during serving. This paper\nargues that integrating length extension with a GPU-friendly KV cache reduction\narchitecture not only reduces training overhead during length extension, but\nalso achieves better long-context performance. This leads to our proposed\nLongGen, which finetunes a pretrained LLM into an efficient architecture during\nlength extension. LongGen builds on three key insights: (1) Sparse attention\npatterns, such as window attention (attending to recent tokens), attention sink\n(initial ones), and blockwise sparse attention (strided token blocks) are\nwell-suited for building efficient long-context models, primarily due to their\nGPU-friendly memory access patterns, enabling efficiency gains not just\ntheoretically but in practice as well. (2) It is essential for the model to\nhave direct access to all tokens. A hybrid architecture with 1/3 full attention\nlayers and 2/3 efficient ones achieves a balanced trade-off between efficiency\nand long-context performance. (3) Lightweight training on 5B long-context data\nis sufficient to extend the hybrid model's context length from 4K to 128K.\n  We evaluate LongGen on both Llama-2 7B and Llama-2 70B, demonstrating its\neffectiveness across different scales. During training with 128K-long contexts,\nLongGen achieves 1.55x training speedup and reduces wall-clock time by 36%,\ncompared to a full-attention baseline. During inference, LongGen reduces KV\ncache memory by 62%, achieving 1.67x prefilling speedup and 1.41x decoding\nspeedup.",

Unlike\nfew-shot learning methods in natural images that can leverage the labels of\neach image, existing few-shot WSI classification methods only utilize a small\nnumber of fine-grained labels or weakly supervised slide labels for training in\norder to avoid expensive fine-grained annotation. They lack sufficient mining\nof available WSIs, severely limiting WSI classification performance. To address\nthe above issues, we propose a novel and efficient dual-tier few-shot learning\nparadigm for WSI classification, named FAST. FAST consists of a dual-level\nannotation strategy and a dual-branch classification framework. Firstly, to\navoid expensive fine-grained annotation, we collect a very small number of WSIs\nat the slide level, and annotate an extremely small number of patches. Then, to\nfully mining the available WSIs, we use all the patches and available patch\nlabels to build a cache branch, which utilizes the labeled patches to learn the\nlabels of unlabeled patches and through knowledge retrieval for patch\nclassification. In addition to the cache branch, we also construct a prior\nbranch that includes learnable prompt vectors, using the text encoder of\nvisual-language models for patch classification. Finally, we integrate the\nresults from both branches to achieve WSI classification. Extensive experiments\non binary and multi-class datasets demonstrate that our proposed method\nsignificantly surpasses existing few-shot classification methods and approaches\nthe accuracy of fully supervised methods with only 0.22$\\%$ annotation costs.\nAll codes and models will be publicly available on\nhttps://github.com/fukexue/FAST.",

UPDOG was 3D printed on a polyjet printer using VeroUltraWhite ($\\rho$ =\n1.19-1.20 g/cm\\textsuperscript{3}) for the bone and Agilus30 ($\\rho$ =\n1.14-1.15 g/cm\\textsuperscript{3}) for the soft tissue. CT scans of UPDOG were\nacquired on a clinical CT scanner. An LD-V1 RCF was inserted into UPDOG and\nirradiated with a kV x-ray source from two angles. The delivered dose to the\nRCF was compared to Monte Carlo (MC) simulations performed in TOPAS.\n  Results: The bone and soft tissue segments in UPDOG were mimicked the patient\nanatomy well with tube voltage-dependent CT numbers. The contrast in HU was of\n49, 47 and 50 HU for the 80, 100, and 120 kVp scans, respectively, sufficient\nfor anatomy visualization. The irradiations delivered a maximum dose to RCF of\n284 mGy which was compared to the results of MC simulations using a depth dose\ncurve and central-axis (CAX) beam profiles. The mean difference in CAX profiles\nand PDD between RCF and MC results was 15.9\\% and 2.3\\%, respectively.\n  Conclusions: We have demonstrated that UPDOG is a useful QA tool for kV\ncanine radiotherapy. UPDOG successfully anatomically mimicked the dog anatomy,\nwith a reduced but sufficient bone contrast. We showed that dose delivered to a\ncanine glioma with kV x-rays can be successfully measured with an RCF\npositioned at the tumor location.",

The\nheterojunction diodes are fabricated via bilayer NiOx sputtering followed by\nself-aligned mesa-etching for field-termination on both large (1-mm2) and small\narea (100-{\\mu}m diameter) devices. The HJD exhibits a ~135 A/cm2 forward\ncurrent density at 5 V with a rectifying ratio of ~1010. The minimum\ndifferential specific on-resistance is measured to be 17.26 m{\\Omega} cm2. The\nbreakdown voltage on 100-{\\mu}m diameter pads was measured to be greater than 3\nkV with a noise floor-level reverse leakage current density (10-8~10-6 A/cm2)\nuntil 3 kV, accomplishing a parallel-plane junction electric field to be at\nleast 3.34 MV/cm at 3 kV with a power figure of merit (PFOM) >0.52 GW/cm2.\nTemperature-dependent forward current density-voltage (J-V) measurements are\nperformed from room temperature (25 C) to 200 C which showed a temperature\ncoefficient of resistance ({\\alpha}) equaling 1.56, higher than that of\n\\b{eta}-Ga2O3 Schottky barrier diodes (SBDs), indicating potential conductivity\ndegradation within NiOx at elevated temperatures."

The paper\ndescribes the use of models based on real time records and including solar\nslews, to investigate the most extreme wind variations likely to be encountered\nin future, enabling strategies to be devised to mitigate them. Wind lulls are\nsurprisingly frequent, occasionally lasting a week or more, and are always\nlikely to be beyond the capabilities of stored or imported electrical energy to\nmitigate them. The models indicate that there will be a continuing need for gas\npowered generation to mitigate wind lulls. Currently, Combined Cycle Gas\nTurbines (CCGTs) provide most of the dispatchable generation. However, CCGTs\nare not sufficiently fast acting to cope with the wind and solar slews\nanticipated in future. The paper suggests that a range of already proven\nfast-acting sources of dispatchable generation, including Open Cycle Gas\nTurbines (OCGTs), Internal Combustion Gas-Fired Reciprocating engines (ICGRs)\nand stored electrical energy systems, should be capable of coping with the\nlargest wind and solar slews likely to be encountered up to the year 2035.\nExamples are given of the recent introduction of these fast-acting sources of\ngeneration which, it is suggested, will progressively replace CCGTs as the wind\nand solar fleets increase in size. Moreover, we see the pattern of recent\ninvestments, summarised in the paper, as a good indication of likely future\ninvestments, with OCGT investments mainly serving the 440 kV grid, and ICGRs\nand stored electrical energy more local networks.",

SEAL standardizes existing benchmarks, integrates an\nagent system for testing API retrieval and planning, and addresses the\ninstability of real-time APIs by introducing a GPT-4-powered API simulator with\ncaching for deterministic evaluations. Our testbed provides a comprehensive\nevaluation pipeline that covers API retrieval, API calls, and final responses,\noffering a reliable framework for structured performance comparison in diverse\nreal-world scenarios. SEAL is publicly available, with ongoing updates for new\nbenchmarks."

In this paper, through trace-based experiments, we found\nthat the existing method for long sequences results in a high\nTime-To-First-Token (TTFT) due to sequential chunk processing, long\nTime-Between-Tokens (TBT) from batching long-sequence prefills and decodes, and\nlow throughput due to constrained key-value cache (KVC) for long sequences. To\naddress these issues, we propose two Sequence-Parallelism (SP) architectures\nfor both tensor parallelism (TP) and non-TP. However, SP introduces two\nchallenges: 1) network communication and computation become performance\nbottlenecks; 2) the latter two issues above are mitigated but not resolved, and\nSP's resultant KV value distribution across GPUs still requires communication\nfor decode, increasing TBT. Hence, we propose a Communication-efficient Sparse\nAttention (CSA) and communication-computation-communication three-phase\npipelining. We also propose SP-based decode that processes decode separately\nfrom prefill, distributes KV values of a request across different GPUs, and\nnovelly moves Query (Q) values instead of KV values to reduce communication\noverhead. These methods constitute a communication-efficient\nSequence-Parallelism based LLM Serving System (SPS2). Our trace-driven\nevaluation demonstrates that SPS2 improves the average TTFT, TBT, and response\ntime by up to 7.5x, 1.92x, and 9.8x and improves the prefill and decode\nthroughput by 8.2x and 5.2x while maintaining the accuracy compared to\nSarathi-Serve.

As the infrastructure for DL applications,\nJavaScript DL frameworks play a crucial role in the development and deployment.\nIt is essential to ensure the quality of JavaScript DL frameworks. However, the\nbottleneck of limited computational resources in the JavaScript environment\nbrings new challenges to framework testing. Specifically, JavaScript DL\nframeworks are equipped with various optimization mechanisms (e.g., cache\nreuse, inference acceleration) to overcome the bottleneck of limited\ncomputational resources. These optimization mechanisms are overlooked by\nexisting methods, resulting in many bugs in JavaScript DL frameworks being\nmissed. To address the above challenges, we propose a mutation-based JavaScript\nDL framework testing method named DLJSFuzzer. DLJSFuzzer designs 13 tensor\nmutation rules targeting the cache reuse mechanism to generate test input\ntensors. Besides, DLJSFuzzer designs eight model mutation rules targeting the\ninference acceleration mechanism to generate test input models. To evaluate the\neffectiveness of DLJSFuzzer, we conduct experiments on the most widely-used\nJavaScript DL framework, TensorFlow.js. The experimental results show that\nDLJSFuzzer outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both effectiveness and\nefficiency. DLJSFuzzer successfully detects 21 unique crashes and 126 unique\nNaN & Inconsistency bugs.

To address the above two\ndrawbacks, we further explore the redundancy in the channel dimension and apply\nan architecture-level design with minor training costs. Therefore, we introduce\nCSKV, a training-efficient Channel Shrinking technique for KV cache\ncompression: (1) We first analyze the singular value distribution of the KV\ncache, revealing significant redundancy and compression potential along the\nchannel dimension. Based on this observation, we propose using low-rank\ndecomposition for key and value layers and storing the low-dimension features.\n(2) To preserve model performance, we introduce a bi-branch KV cache, including\na window-based full-precision KV cache and a low-precision compressed KV cache.\n(3) To reduce the training costs, we minimize the layer-wise reconstruction\nloss for the compressed KV cache instead of retraining the entire LLMs.\nExtensive experiments show that CSKV can reduce the memory overhead of the KV\ncache by 80% while maintaining the model's long-context capability.

                "summary": "Modern recommender systems are built upon computation-intensive\ninfrastructure, and it is challenging to perform real-time computation for each\nrequest, especially in peak periods, due to the limited computational\nresources. Recommending by user-wise result caches is widely used when the\nsystem cannot afford a real-time recommendation. However, it is challenging to\nallocate real-time and cached recommendations to maximize the users' overall\nengagement. This paper shows two key challenges to cache allocation, i.e., the\nvalue-strategy dependency and the streaming allocation. Then, we propose a\nreinforcement prediction-allocation framework (RPAF) to address these issues.\nRPAF is a reinforcement-learning-based two-stage framework containing\nprediction and allocation stages. The prediction stage estimates the values of\nthe cache choices considering the value-strategy dependency, and the allocation\nstage determines the cache choices for each individual request while satisfying\nthe global budget constraint. We show that the challenge of training RPAF\nincludes globality and the strictness of budget constraints, and a relaxed\nlocal allocator (RLA) is proposed to address this issue. Moreover, a PoolRank\nalgorithm is used in the allocation stage to deal with the streaming allocation\nproblem. Experiments show that RPAF significantly improves users' engagement\nunder computational budget constraints.",

                    "value": "Modern recommender systems are built upon computation-intensive\ninfrastructure, and it is challenging to perform real-time computation for each\nrequest, especially in peak periods, due to the limited computational\nresources. Recommending by user-wise result caches is widely used when the\nsystem cannot afford a real-time recommendation. However, it is challenging to\nallocate real-time and cached recommendations to maximize the users' overall\nengagement. This paper shows two key challenges to cache allocation, i.e., the\nvalue-strategy dependency and the streaming allocation. Then, we propose a\nreinforcement prediction-allocation framework (RPAF) to address these issues.\nRPAF is a reinforcement-learning-based two-stage framework containing\nprediction and allocation stages. The prediction stage estimates the values of\nthe cache choices considering the value-strategy dependency, and the allocation\nstage determines the cache choices for each individual request while satisfying\nthe global budget constraint. We show that the challenge of training RPAF\nincludes globality and the strictness of budget constraints, and a relaxed\nlocal allocator (RLA) is proposed to address this issue. Moreover, a PoolRank\nalgorithm is used in the allocation stage to deal with the streaming allocation\nproblem. Experiments show that RPAF significantly improves users' engagement\nunder computational budget constraints."

Among them, growing\nattention has been focused on monolithic Multimodal Large Language Models\n(MLLMs) that integrate visual encoding and language decoding into a single LLM.\nDespite the structural simplicity and deployment-friendliness, training a\nmonolithic MLLM with promising performance still remains challenging. In\nparticular, the popular approaches adopt continuous pre-training to extend a\npre-trained LLM to a monolithic MLLM, which suffers from catastrophic\nforgetting and leads to performance degeneration. In this paper, we aim to\novercome this limitation from the perspective of delta tuning. Specifically,\nour core idea is to embed visual parameters into a pre-trained LLM, thereby\nincrementally learning visual knowledge from massive data via delta tuning,\ni.e., freezing the LLM when optimizing the visual parameters. Based on this\nprinciple, we present Mono-InternVL, a novel monolithic MLLM that seamlessly\nintegrates a set of visual experts via a multimodal mixture-of-experts\nstructure. Moreover, we propose an innovative pre-training strategy to maximize\nthe visual capability of Mono-InternVL, namely Endogenous Visual Pre-training\n(EViP). In particular, EViP is designed as a progressive learning process for\nvisual experts, which aims to fully exploit the visual knowledge from noisy\ndata to high-quality data. To validate our approach, we conduct extensive\nexperiments on 16 benchmarks. Experimental results not only validate the\nsuperior performance of Mono-InternVL compared to the state-of-the-art MLLM on\n6 multimodal benchmarks, e.g., +113 points over InternVL-1.5 on OCRBench, but\nalso confirm its better deployment efficiency, with first token latency reduced\nby up to 67%.",

The scene graph encodes the relationships between objects,\ngroups and rooms with a LLM-friendly structure, for which we design a\nhierarchical chain-of-thought prompt to help LLM reason the goal location\naccording to scene context by traversing the nodes and edges. Moreover, benefit\nfrom the scene graph representation, we further design a re-perception\nmechanism to empower the object navigation framework with the ability to\ncorrect perception error. We conduct extensive experiments on MP3D, HM3D and\nRoboTHOR environments, where SG-Nav surpasses previous state-of-the-art\nzero-shot methods by more than 10% SR on all benchmarks, while the decision\nprocess is explainable.

PRMs provide feedback at each step of a\nmulti-step reasoning trace, potentially improving credit assignment over\noutcome reward models (ORMs) that only provide feedback at the final step.\nHowever, collecting dense, per-step human labels is not scalable, and training\nPRMs from automatically-labeled data has thus far led to limited gains. To\nimprove a base policy by running search against a PRM or using it as dense\nrewards for reinforcement learning (RL), we ask: \"How should we design process\nrewards?\". Our key insight is that, to be effective, the process reward for a\nstep should measure progress: a change in the likelihood of producing a correct\nresponse in the future, before and after taking the step, corresponding to the\nnotion of step-level advantages in RL. Crucially, this progress should be\nmeasured under a prover policy distinct from the base policy. We theoretically\ncharacterize the set of good provers and our results show that optimizing\nprocess rewards from such provers improves exploration during test-time search\nand online RL. In fact, our characterization shows that weak prover policies\ncan substantially improve a stronger base policy, which we also observe\nempirically.

However, most current research on MT-LLMs still faces\nsignificant challenges in maintaining translation consistency and accuracy when\nprocessing entire documents. In this paper, we introduce DelTA, a\nDocument-levEL Translation Agent designed to overcome these limitations. DelTA\nfeatures a multi-level memory structure that stores information across various\ngranularities and spans, including Proper Noun Records, Bilingual Summary,\nLong-Term Memory, and Short-Term Memory, which are continuously retrieved and\nupdated by auxiliary LLM-based components. Experimental results indicate that\nDelTA significantly outperforms strong baselines in terms of translation\nconsistency and quality across four open/closed-source LLMs and two\nrepresentative document translation datasets, achieving an increase in\nconsistency scores by up to 4.58 percentage points and in COMET scores by up to\n3.16 points on average. DelTA employs a sentence-by-sentence translation\nstrategy, ensuring no sentence omissions and offering a memory-efficient\nsolution compared to the mainstream method. Furthermore, DelTA improves pronoun\ntranslation accuracy, and the summary component of the agent also shows promise\nas a tool for query-based summarization tasks.

However, PINN-based\nreconstruction tends to preserve larger-scale variations, while smaller-scale\nvariations become less pronounced due to the vanishing gradient problem.

In this paper,\nwe design Mars, an interactive environment devised for situated inductive\nreasoning. It introduces counter-commonsense game mechanisms by modifying\nterrain, survival setting and task dependency while adhering to certain\nprinciples. In Mars, agents need to actively interact with their surroundings,\nderive useful rules and perform decision-making tasks in specific contexts. We\nconduct experiments on various RL-based and LLM-based methods, finding that\nthey all struggle on this challenging situated inductive reasoning benchmark.\nFurthermore, we explore \\textit{Induction from Reflection}, where we instruct\nagents to perform inductive reasoning from history trajectory. The superior\nperformance underscores the importance of inductive reasoning in Mars. Through\nMars, we aim to galvanize advancements in situated inductive reasoning and set\nthe stage for developing the next generation of AI systems that can reason in\nan adaptive and context-sensitive way.",

                    "value": "Large Language Models (LLMs) trained on massive corpora have shown remarkable\nsuccess in knowledge-intensive tasks. Yet, most of them rely on pre-stored\nknowledge. Inducing new general knowledge from a specific environment and\nperforming reasoning with the acquired knowledge -- \\textit{situated inductive\nreasoning}, is crucial and challenging for machine intelligence. In this paper,\nwe design Mars, an interactive environment devised for situated inductive\nreasoning. It introduces counter-commonsense game mechanisms by modifying\nterrain, survival setting and task dependency while adhering to certain\nprinciples. In Mars, agents need to actively interact with their surroundings,\nderive useful rules and perform decision-making tasks in specific contexts. We\nconduct experiments on various RL-based and LLM-based methods, finding that\nthey all struggle on this challenging situated inductive reasoning benchmark.\nFurthermore, we explore \\textit{Induction from Reflection}, where we instruct\nagents to perform inductive reasoning from history trajectory. The superior\nperformance underscores the importance of inductive reasoning in Mars. Through\nMars, we aim to galvanize advancements in situated inductive reasoning and set\nthe stage for developing the next generation of AI systems that can reason in\nan adaptive and context-sensitive way."

Our high\nsignal to noise data, which has negligible red noise, reveals significant\nabsorption by H$_2$O ($4.2\\sigma$) and CO$_2$ ($8.9\\sigma$). From independent\ndata reduction and atmospheric retrieval approaches, we infer that WASP-15b's\natmospheric metallicity is super-solar ($\\gtrsim 15\\times$ solar) and its C/O\nis consistent with solar, that together imply planetesimal accretion. Our GCM\nsimulations for WASP-15b suggest that the C/O we measure at the limb is likely\nrepresentative of the entire photosphere due to the mostly uniform spatial\ndistribution of H$_2$O, CO$_2$ and CO. We additionally see evidence for\nabsorption by SO$_2$ and absorption at 4.9$\\mu$m, for which the current leading\ncandidate is OCS, albeit with several caveats. If confirmed, this would be the\nfirst detection of OCS in an exoplanet atmosphere and point towards complex\nphotochemistry of sulphur-bearing species in the upper atmosphere. These are\nthe first observations from the BOWIE-ALIGN survey which is using JWST's\nNIRSpec/G395H instrument to compare the atmospheric compositions of\naligned/low-obliquity and misaligned/high-obliquity hot Jupiters around F stars\nabove the Kraft break. The goal of our survey is to determine whether the\natmospheric composition differs across two populations of planets that have\nlikely undergone different migration histories (disc versus disc-free) as\nevidenced by their obliquities (aligned versus misaligned).",

This gap has also obscured\nthe evaluation of KGs' potential to mitigate the problem of hallucination in\nLLMs. To fill the gap, we introduce OKGQA, a new benchmark specifically\ndesigned to assess LLMs enhanced with KGs under open-ended, real-world question\nanswering scenarios.

We experiment with augmenting 1,000\nposts from the Measuring Hate Speech corpus, an English dataset annotated with\ntarget identity information, adding around 30,000 synthetic examples using both\nsimple data augmentation methods and different types of generative models,\ncomparing autoregressive and sequence-to-sequence approaches. We find\ntraditional DA methods to often be preferable to generative models, but the\ncombination of the two tends to lead to the best results. Indeed, for some hate\ncategories such as origin, religion, and disability, hate speech classification\nusing augmented data for training improves by more than 10% F1 over the no\naugmentation baseline.

This structure results in powerful tools that can process complex\ninformation from diverse sources but raises critical security concerns.\nMalicious information from any source may be processed by the LLM and can\ncompromise the query processing, resulting in nearly arbitrary misbehavior. To\ntackle this problem, we present a system-level defense based on the principles\nof information flow control that we call an f-secure LLM system. An f-secure\nLLM system disaggregates the components of an LLM system into a context-aware\npipeline with dynamically generated structured executable plans, and a security\nmonitor filters out untrusted input into the planning process. This structure\nprevents compromise while maximizing flexibility. We provide formal models for\nboth existing LLM systems and our f-secure LLM system, allowing analysis of\ncritical security guarantees. We further evaluate case studies and benchmarks\nshowing that f-secure LLM systems provide robust security while preserving\nfunctionality and efficiency.

                    "value": "Large Language Model-based systems (LLM systems) are information and query\nprocessing systems that use LLMs to plan operations from natural-language\nprompts and feed the output of each successive step into the LLM to plan the\nnext. This structure results in powerful tools that can process complex\ninformation from diverse sources but raises critical security concerns.\nMalicious information from any source may be processed by the LLM and can\ncompromise the query processing, resulting in nearly arbitrary misbehavior. To\ntackle this problem, we present a system-level defense based on the principles\nof information flow control that we call an f-secure LLM system. An f-secure\nLLM system disaggregates the components of an LLM system into a context-aware\npipeline with dynamically generated structured executable plans, and a security\nmonitor filters out untrusted input into the planning process. This structure\nprevents compromise while maximizing flexibility. We provide formal models for\nboth existing LLM systems and our f-secure LLM system, allowing analysis of\ncritical security guarantees. We further evaluate case studies and benchmarks\nshowing that f-secure LLM systems provide robust security while preserving\nfunctionality and efficiency.

However, these similarities\nare ultimately dependent on the corpora used to train these LLMs, and may not\nreflect subjective similarity of individuals or how their biases and\nconstraints impact similarity metrics. This lack of cognitively-aware\npersonalization of similarity metrics can be particularly problematic in\neducational and recommendation settings where there is a limited number of\nindividual judgements of category or preference, and biases can be particularly\nrelevant. To address this, we rely on an integration of an Instance-Based\nLearning (IBL) cognitive model with LLM embeddings to develop the\nInstance-Based Individualized Similarity (IBIS) metric. This similarity metric\nis beneficial in that it takes into account individual biases and constraints\nin a manner that is grounded in the cognitive mechanisms of decision making. To\nevaluate the IBIS metric, we also introduce a dataset of human categorizations\nof emails as being either dangerous (phishing) or safe (ham). This dataset is\nused to demonstrate the benefits of leveraging a cognitive model to measure the\nsubjective similarity of human participants in an educational setting.",

However, these similarities\nare ultimately dependent on the corpora used to train these LLMs, and may not\nreflect subjective similarity of individuals or how their biases and\nconstraints impact similarity metrics. This lack of cognitively-aware\npersonalization of similarity metrics can be particularly problematic in\neducational and recommendation settings where there is a limited number of\nindividual judgements of category or preference, and biases can be particularly\nrelevant. To address this, we rely on an integration of an Instance-Based\nLearning (IBL) cognitive model with LLM embeddings to develop the\nInstance-Based Individualized Similarity (IBIS) metric. This similarity metric\nis beneficial in that it takes into account individual biases and constraints\nin a manner that is grounded in the cognitive mechanisms of decision making. To\nevaluate the IBIS metric, we also introduce a dataset of human categorizations\nof emails as being either dangerous (phishing) or safe (ham). This dataset is\nused to demonstrate the benefits of leveraging a cognitive model to measure the\nsubjective similarity of human participants in an educational setting."

We introduce three novel tasks, Multi-label Atypicality\nClassification, Atypicality Statement Retrieval, and Aypical Object\nRecognition, to benchmark VLMs' understanding of atypicality in persuasive\nimages. We evaluate how well VLMs use atypicality to infer an ad's message and\ntest their reasoning abilities by employing semantically challenging negatives.\nFinally, we pioneer atypicality-aware verbalization by extracting comprehensive\nimage descriptions sensitive to atypical elements. Our findings reveal that:\n(1) VLMs lack advanced reasoning capabilities compared to LLMs; (2) simple,\neffective strategies can extract atypicality-aware information, leading to\ncomprehensive image verbalization; (3) atypicality aids persuasive\nadvertisement understanding.

To address this, we introduce the Information Bottleneck\nProtector (IBProtector), a defense mechanism grounded in the information\nbottleneck principle, and we modify the objective to avoid trivial solutions.\nThe IBProtector selectively compresses and perturbs prompts, facilitated by a\nlightweight and trainable extractor, preserving only essential information for\nthe target LLMs to respond with the expected answer. Moreover, we further\nconsider a situation where the gradient is not visible to be compatible with\nany LLM. Our empirical evaluations show that IBProtector outperforms current\ndefense methods in mitigating jailbreak attempts, without overly affecting\nresponse quality or inference speed. Its effectiveness and adaptability across\nvarious attack methods and target LLMs underscore the potential of IBProtector\nas a novel, transferable defense that bolsters the security of LLMs without\nrequiring modifications to the underlying models.",

Specifically, we introduce the Activation\nAddition (ActAdd) technique, which contrasts the intermediate activations on\nprompt pairs (such as \"Love\" versus \"Hate\") to compute a steering vector\n(Subramani et al. 2022). By tactically adding in e.g. the \"Love\" - \"Hate\"\nsteering vector during the forward pass, we achieve SOTA on\nnegative-to-positive sentiment shift and detoxification using models including\nLLaMA-3 and OPT. ActAdd yields inference-time control over high-level output\nproperties (like topic and sentiment) while preserving performance on\noff-target tasks.

To facilitate a rigorous evaluation of LLMs in practical\ncoding contexts, Carlos et al. introduced the SWE-bench dataset, which\ncomprises 2,294 real-world GitHub issues and their corresponding pull requests,\ncollected from 12 widely used Python repositories. Several impressive LLM-based\ntoolkits recently are developed and evaluated on this dataset. However, a\nsystematic evaluation of the quality of SWE-bench remains missing. In this\npaper, we addressed this gap by presenting an empirical analysis of the\nSWE-bench dataset. We conducted a manual screening of instances where SWEAgent\n+ GPT-4 successfully resolved issues by comparing the model-generated patches\nwith the actual pull requests. SWE-Agent+GPT-4 was at the top of SWE-bench\nleaderboard during the time of our study. Our analysis reveals some critical\nissues with the SWE-bench dataset: 1) 32.67% of the successful patches involve\ncheating as the solutions were directly provided in the issue report or the\ncomments. We refer to as solution leakage problem. 2) 31.08% of the passed\npatches are suspicious patches due to weak test cases, i.e., the tests were not\nadequate to verify the correctness of a patch. When we filtered out these\nproblematic issues, the resolution rate of SWE-Agent+GPT-4 dropped from 12.47%\nto 3.97%. We also observed that the same data quality issues also exist in the\ntwo variants of SWE-bench, i.e., SWE-bench Lite and SWE-Bench Verified.

In\nthis paper, we introduce a novel method that enhances variational inference in\ndiscrete latent variable models by leveraging Error Correcting Codes (ECCs) to\nintroduce redundancy in the latent representations. This redundancy is then\nexploited by the variational posterior to yield more accurate estimates,\nthereby narrowing the variational gap. Inspired by ECCs commonly used in\ndigital communications and data storage, we demonstrate proof-of-concept using\na Discrete Variational Autoencoder (DVAE) with binary latent variables and\nblock repetition codes. We further extend this idea to a hierarchical structure\nbased on polar codes, where certain latent bits are more robustly protected.\nOur method improves generation quality, data reconstruction, and uncertainty\ncalibration compared to the uncoded DVAE, even when trained with tighter bounds\nsuch as the Importance Weighted Autoencoder (IWAE) objective. In particular, we\ndemonstrate superior performance on MNIST, FMNIST, CIFAR10, and Tiny ImageNet\ndatasets. The general approach of integrating ECCs into variational inference\nis compatible with existing techniques to boost variational inference, such as\nimportance sampling or Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. We also outline the key\nproperties ECCs must have to effectively enhance discrete variational\ninference.",

                    "value": "Despite significant advancements in deep probabilistic models, learning\nlow-dimensional discrete latent representations remains a challenging task. In\nthis paper, we introduce a novel method that enhances variational inference in\ndiscrete latent variable models by leveraging Error Correcting Codes (ECCs) to\nintroduce redundancy in the latent representations. This redundancy is then\nexploited by the variational posterior to yield more accurate estimates,\nthereby narrowing the variational gap. Inspired by ECCs commonly used in\ndigital communications and data storage, we demonstrate proof-of-concept using\na Discrete Variational Autoencoder (DVAE) with binary latent variables and\nblock repetition codes. We further extend this idea to a hierarchical structure\nbased on polar codes, where certain latent bits are more robustly protected.\nOur method improves generation quality, data reconstruction, and uncertainty\ncalibration compared to the uncoded DVAE, even when trained with tighter bounds\nsuch as the Importance Weighted Autoencoder (IWAE) objective. In particular, we\ndemonstrate superior performance on MNIST, FMNIST, CIFAR10, and Tiny ImageNet\ndatasets. The general approach of integrating ECCs into variational inference\nis compatible with existing techniques to boost variational inference, such as\nimportance sampling or Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. We also outline the key\nproperties ECCs must have to effectively enhance discrete variational\ninference."

Among them, growing\nattention has been focused on monolithic Multimodal Large Language Models\n(MLLMs) that integrate visual encoding and language decoding into a single LLM.\nDespite the structural simplicity and deployment-friendliness, training a\nmonolithic MLLM with promising performance still remains challenging. In\nparticular, the popular approaches adopt continuous pre-training to extend a\npre-trained LLM to a monolithic MLLM, which suffers from catastrophic\nforgetting and leads to performance degeneration. In this paper, we aim to\novercome this limitation from the perspective of delta tuning. Specifically,\nour core idea is to embed visual parameters into a pre-trained LLM, thereby\nincrementally learning visual knowledge from massive data via delta tuning,\ni.e., freezing the LLM when optimizing the visual parameters. Based on this\nprinciple, we present Mono-InternVL, a novel monolithic MLLM that seamlessly\nintegrates a set of visual experts via a multimodal mixture-of-experts\nstructure. Moreover, we propose an innovative pre-training strategy to maximize\nthe visual capability of Mono-InternVL, namely Endogenous Visual Pre-training\n(EViP). In particular, EViP is designed as a progressive learning process for\nvisual experts, which aims to fully exploit the visual knowledge from noisy\ndata to high-quality data. To validate our approach, we conduct extensive\nexperiments on 16 benchmarks. Experimental results not only validate the\nsuperior performance of Mono-InternVL compared to the state-of-the-art MLLM on\n6 multimodal benchmarks, e.g., +113 points over InternVL-1.5 on OCRBench, but\nalso confirm its better deployment efficiency, with first token latency reduced\nby up to 67%.",

The scene graph encodes the relationships between objects,\ngroups and rooms with a LLM-friendly structure, for which we design a\nhierarchical chain-of-thought prompt to help LLM reason the goal location\naccording to scene context by traversing the nodes and edges. Moreover, benefit\nfrom the scene graph representation, we further design a re-perception\nmechanism to empower the object navigation framework with the ability to\ncorrect perception error. We conduct extensive experiments on MP3D, HM3D and\nRoboTHOR environments, where SG-Nav surpasses previous state-of-the-art\nzero-shot methods by more than 10% SR on all benchmarks, while the decision\nprocess is explainable. To the best of our knowledge, SG-Nav is the first\nzero-shot method that achieves even higher performance than supervised object\nnavigation methods on the challenging MP3D benchmark.",

The scene graph encodes the relationships between objects,\ngroups and rooms with a LLM-friendly structure, for which we design a\nhierarchical chain-of-thought prompt to help LLM reason the goal location\naccording to scene context by traversing the nodes and edges. Moreover, benefit\nfrom the scene graph representation, we further design a re-perception\nmechanism to empower the object navigation framework with the ability to\ncorrect perception error. We conduct extensive experiments on MP3D, HM3D and\nRoboTHOR environments, where SG-Nav surpasses previous state-of-the-art\nzero-shot methods by more than 10% SR on all benchmarks, while the decision\nprocess is explainable. To the best of our knowledge, SG-Nav is the first\nzero-shot method that achieves even higher performance than supervised object\nnavigation methods on the challenging MP3D benchmark."

Experimental results indicate that\nDelTA significantly outperforms strong baselines in terms of translation\nconsistency and quality across four open/closed-source LLMs and two\nrepresentative document translation datasets, achieving an increase in\nconsistency scores by up to 4.58 percentage points and in COMET scores by up to\n3.16 points on average. DelTA employs a sentence-by-sentence translation\nstrategy, ensuring no sentence omissions and offering a memory-efficient\nsolution compared to the mainstream method. Furthermore, DelTA improves pronoun\ntranslation accuracy, and the summary component of the agent also shows promise\nas a tool for query-based summarization tasks.

By addressing\nfundamental challenges in LLM-based MAS, Optima shows the potential towards\nscalable, efficient, and effective MAS\n(https://chenweize1998.github.io/optima-project-page)."

                "summary": "We present \"Paramanu\", a family of novel language models (LM) for Indian\nlanguages, consisting of auto-regressive monolingual, bilingual, and\nmultilingual models pretrained from scratch. Currently, it covers 10 languages\n(Assamese, Bangla, Hindi, Konkani, Maithili, Marathi, Odia, Sanskrit, Tamil,\nTelugu) across 5 scripts (Bangla, Devanagari, Odia, Tamil, Telugu). The models\nare pretrained on a single GPU with context size of 1024 and vary in size from\n13.29 million (M) to 367.5 M parameters. We proposed a RoPE embedding scaling\nmethod that enables us to pretrain language models from scratch at larger\nsequence length context size than typical GPU memory permits. We also\nintroduced a novel efficient Indic tokenizer, \"mBharat\", using a combination of\nBPE and Unigram, achieving the least fertility score and the ability to\ntokenize unseen languages in both the same script & Roman script. We also\nproposed and performed language-specific tokenization for multilingual models &\ndomain-specific tokenization for monolingual models. To address the \"curse of\nmultilinguality\" in our mParamanu model, we pretrained on comparable corpora\nbased on typological grouping within the same script. Our findings show a\nlanguage transfer phenomenon from low-resource to high-resource languages\nwithin languages of the same script & typology.

                    "value": "We present \"Paramanu\", a family of novel language models (LM) for Indian\nlanguages, consisting of auto-regressive monolingual, bilingual, and\nmultilingual models pretrained from scratch. Currently, it covers 10 languages\n(Assamese, Bangla, Hindi, Konkani, Maithili, Marathi, Odia, Sanskrit, Tamil,\nTelugu) across 5 scripts (Bangla, Devanagari, Odia, Tamil, Telugu). The models\nare pretrained on a single GPU with context size of 1024 and vary in size from\n13.29 million (M) to 367.5 M parameters. We proposed a RoPE embedding scaling\nmethod that enables us to pretrain language models from scratch at larger\nsequence length context size than typical GPU memory permits. We also\nintroduced a novel efficient Indic tokenizer, \"mBharat\", using a combination of\nBPE and Unigram, achieving the least fertility score and the ability to\ntokenize unseen languages in both the same script & Roman script. We also\nproposed and performed language-specific tokenization for multilingual models &\ndomain-specific tokenization for monolingual models. To address the \"curse of\nmultilinguality\" in our mParamanu model, we pretrained on comparable corpora\nbased on typological grouping within the same script. Our findings show a\nlanguage transfer phenomenon from low-resource to high-resource languages\nwithin languages of the same script & typology.

                "summary": "Recent advancements in test time compute, particularly through the use of\nverifier models, have significantly enhanced the reasoning capabilities of\nLarge Language Models (LLMs). This generator-verifier approach closely\nresembles the actor-critic framework in reinforcement learning (RL). However,\ncurrent verifier models in LLMs often rely on supervised fine-tuning without\ntemporal difference learning such as Q-learning. This paper introduces\nVerifierQ, a novel approach that integrates Offline Q-learning into LLM\nverifier models. We address three key challenges in applying Q-learning to\nLLMs: (1) handling utterance-level Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), (2)\nmanaging large action spaces, and (3) mitigating overestimation bias. VerifierQ\nintroduces a modified Bellman update for bounded Q-values, incorporates\nImplicit Q-learning (IQL) for efficient action space management, and integrates\na novel Conservative Q-learning (CQL) formulation for balanced Q-value\nestimation. Our method enables parallel Q-value computation and improving\ntraining efficiency. While recent work has explored RL techniques like MCTS for\ngenerators, VerifierQ is among the first to investigate the verifier (critic)\naspect in LLMs through Q-learning. This integration of RL principles into\nverifier models complements existing advancements in generator techniques,\npotentially enabling more robust and adaptive reasoning in LLMs. Experimental\nresults on mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate VerifierQ's superior\nperformance compared to traditional supervised fine-tuning approaches, with\nimprovements in efficiency, accuracy and robustness. By enhancing the synergy\nbetween generation and evaluation capabilities, VerifierQ contributes to the\nongoing evolution of AI systems in addressing complex cognitive tasks across\nvarious domains.",

However,\ncurrent verifier models in LLMs often rely on supervised fine-tuning without\ntemporal difference learning such as Q-learning. This paper introduces\nVerifierQ, a novel approach that integrates Offline Q-learning into LLM\nverifier models. We address three key challenges in applying Q-learning to\nLLMs: (1) handling utterance-level Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), (2)\nmanaging large action spaces, and (3) mitigating overestimation bias. VerifierQ\nintroduces a modified Bellman update for bounded Q-values, incorporates\nImplicit Q-learning (IQL) for efficient action space management, and integrates\na novel Conservative Q-learning (CQL) formulation for balanced Q-value\nestimation. Our method enables parallel Q-value computation and improving\ntraining efficiency. While recent work has explored RL techniques like MCTS for\ngenerators, VerifierQ is among the first to investigate the verifier (critic)\naspect in LLMs through Q-learning. This integration of RL principles into\nverifier models complements existing advancements in generator techniques,\npotentially enabling more robust and adaptive reasoning in LLMs. Experimental\nresults on mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate VerifierQ's superior\nperformance compared to traditional supervised fine-tuning approaches, with\nimprovements in efficiency, accuracy and robustness. By enhancing the synergy\nbetween generation and evaluation capabilities, VerifierQ contributes to the\nongoing evolution of AI systems in addressing complex cognitive tasks across\nvarious domains."

It is, therefore, imperative to explore\nnovel technologies to improve user protection across both technical and human\ndimensions. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer significant promise for text\nprocessing in various domains, but their use for defense against phishing\nattacks still remains scarcely explored. In this paper, we present APOLLO, a\ntool based on OpenAI's GPT-4o to detect phishing emails and generate\nexplanation messages to users about why a specific email is dangerous, thus\nimproving their decision-making capabilities. We have evaluated the performance\nof APOLLO in classifying phishing emails; the results show that the LLM models\nhave exemplary capabilities in classifying phishing emails (97 percent accuracy\nin the case of GPT-4o) and that this performance can be further improved by\nintegrating data from third-party services, resulting in a near-perfect\nclassification rate (99 percent accuracy). To assess the perception of the\nexplanations generated by this tool, we also conducted a study with 20\nparticipants, comparing four different explanations presented as phishing\nwarnings. We compared the LLM-generated explanations to four baselines: a\nmanually crafted warning, and warnings from Chrome, Firefox, and Edge browsers.\nThe results show that not only the LLM-generated explanations were perceived as\nhigh quality, but also that they can be more understandable, interesting, and\ntrustworthy than the baselines. These findings suggest that using LLMs as a\ndefense against phishing is a very promising approach, with APOLLO representing\na proof of concept in this research direction.",

We measured overall and Out of\nDistribution (OOD) performance for DER and DEN, with and without synthetic data\naugmentation. We evaluated performance on 3 different disease corpora using 4\ndifferent data augmentation strategies, assessed using BioBERT for DER and\nSapBERT and KrissBERT for DEN.\n  Results: Our synthetic data yielded a substantial improvement for DEN, in all\n3 training corpora the top 1 accuracy of both SapBERT and KrissBERT improved by\n3-9 points in overall performance and by 20-55 points in OOD data. A small\nimprovement (1-2 points) was also seen for DER in overall performance, but only\none dataset showed OOD improvement.\n  Conclusion: LLM generation of normalized disease mentions can improve DEN\nrelative to normalization approaches that do not utilize LLMs to augment data\nwith synthetic mentions.

Moreover, we further\nconsider a situation where the gradient is not visible to be compatible with\nany LLM. Our empirical evaluations show that IBProtector outperforms current\ndefense methods in mitigating jailbreak attempts, without overly affecting\nresponse quality or inference speed.

Despite these capabilities, deploying LLMs is\nhindered by their computational demands. Distilling LLM mathematical reasoning\ninto Smaller Language Models (SLMs) has emerged as a solution to this\nchallenge, although these smaller models often suffer from errors in\ncalculation and semantic understanding. Prior work has proposed\nProgram-of-Thought Distillation (PoTD) to avoid calculation error. To further\naddress semantic understanding errors, we propose Key-Point-Driven Mathematical\nReasoning Distillation (KPDD). KPDD enhances the reasoning performance of SLMs\nby breaking down the problem-solving process into three stages: Core Question\nExtraction, Problem-Solving Information Extraction, and Step-by-Step Solution.\nThis method is further divided into KPDD-CoT, which generates Chain-of-Thought\nrationales, and KPDD-PoT, which creates Program-of-Thought rationales. The\nexperiment results show that KPDD-CoT significantly improves reasoning\nabilities, while KPDD-PoT achieves state-of-the-art performance in mathematical\nreasoning tasks. Our approach effectively mitigates misunderstanding errors,\nadvancing the deployment of efficient and capable SLMs.",

                    "value": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional proficiency in\nmathematical reasoning tasks due to their extensive parameter counts and\ntraining on vast datasets. Despite these capabilities, deploying LLMs is\nhindered by their computational demands. Distilling LLM mathematical reasoning\ninto Smaller Language Models (SLMs) has emerged as a solution to this\nchallenge, although these smaller models often suffer from errors in\ncalculation and semantic understanding. Prior work has proposed\nProgram-of-Thought Distillation (PoTD) to avoid calculation error. To further\naddress semantic understanding errors, we propose Key-Point-Driven Mathematical\nReasoning Distillation (KPDD). KPDD enhances the reasoning performance of SLMs\nby breaking down the problem-solving process into three stages: Core Question\nExtraction, Problem-Solving Information Extraction, and Step-by-Step Solution.\nThis method is further divided into KPDD-CoT, which generates Chain-of-Thought\nrationales, and KPDD-PoT, which creates Program-of-Thought rationales. The\nexperiment results show that KPDD-CoT significantly improves reasoning\nabilities, while KPDD-PoT achieves state-of-the-art performance in mathematical\nreasoning tasks. Our approach effectively mitigates misunderstanding errors,\nadvancing the deployment of efficient and capable SLMs."

While machine learning models can identify such structures, their\ndeployment is hindered by the need for labeled, diverse surgical datasets with\nanatomical annotations. Labeling multiple classes (i.e., organs) in a surgical\nscene is time-intensive, requiring medical experts. Although synthetically\ngenerated images can enhance segmentation performance, maintaining both organ\nstructure and texture during generation is challenging. We introduce a\nmulti-stage approach using diffusion models to generate multi-class surgical\ndatasets with annotations. Our framework improves anatomy awareness by training\norgan specific models with an inpainting objective guided by binary\nsegmentation masks. The organs are generated with an inference pipeline using\npre-trained ControlNet to maintain the organ structure. The synthetic\nmulti-class datasets are constructed through an image composition step,\nensuring structural and textural consistency. This versatile approach allows\nthe generation of multi-class datasets from real binary datasets and simulated\nsurgical masks.

Directly estimating the performance of LLM\nservices at each invocation can be laborious, especially requiring abundant\nlabeled data or internal information within the LLM. This paper introduces a\nnovel method to estimate the performance of LLM services across different tasks\nand contexts, which can be \"plug-and-play\" utilizing only a few unlabeled\nsamples like ICL. Our findings suggest that the negative log-likelihood and\nperplexity derived from LLM service invocation can function as effective and\nsignificant features. Based on these features, we utilize four distinct\nmeta-models to estimate the performance of LLM services. Our proposed method is\ncompared against unlabeled estimation baselines across multiple LLM services\nand tasks. And it is experimentally applied to two scenarios, demonstrating its\neffectiveness in the selection and further optimization of LLM services.",

However, the vast potential and remarkable\ncapabilities of LLMs also raise new security and privacy concerns if they are\nexploited for nefarious purposes due to their open-endedness. For example, LLMs\nmay be used to plagiarize or imitate writing, thereby infringing the copyright\nof the original content, or to create indiscriminate fake information based on\na certain source text. In some cases, LLMs can even analyze text from the\nInternet to infer personal privacy. Unfortunately, previous text protection\nresearch could not foresee the emergence of powerful LLMs, rendering it no\nlonger effective in this new context. To bridge this gap, we introduce Silent\nGuardian (SG), a text protection mechanism against LLMs, which allows LLMs to\nrefuse to generate response when receiving protected text, preventing the\nmalicious use of text from the source. Specifically, we first propose the\nconcept of Truncation Protection Examples (TPE). By carefully modifying the\ntext to be protected, TPE can induce LLMs to first sample the end token, thus\ndirectly terminating the interaction. In addition, to efficiently construct TPE\nin the discrete space of text data, we propose a novel optimization algorithm\ncalled Super Tailored Protection (STP), which is not only highly efficient but\nalso maintains the semantic consistency of the text during the optimization\nprocess. The comprehensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that SG can\neffectively protect the target text under various configurations and achieve\nalmost 100% protection success rate in some cases.

In that spirit, we are the first to conduct an extensive study of the\nperformance of multilingual models instruction-tuned on different language\ncompositions on parallel instruction-tuning benchmarks across a selection of\nthe most spoken Indo-European languages. We systematically examine the effects\nof language and instruction dataset size on a mid-sized and a large,\nmultilingual LLMs by instruction-tuning them on parallel instruction-tuning\ndatasets. Our results demonstrate that instruction-tuning on parallel instead\nof monolingual corpora benefits cross-lingual instruction following\ncapabilities by up to 9.9%. Furthermore, we show that the Superficial Alignment\nHypothesis does not hold in general, as the investigated multilingual 7B\nparameter model presents a counter-example requiring large-scale\ninstruction-tuning datasets. Finally, we conduct a human annotation study to\nunderstand the alignment between human-based and GPT-4-based evaluation within\nmultilingual chat scenarios."
