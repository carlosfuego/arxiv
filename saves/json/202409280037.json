A complete end-to-end reference implementation in\n12nm FinFET technology demonstrates the physical feasibility and power\nperformance area (PPA) benefits of our approach.

To our knowledge,\nMnemosyne is the first to be able to achieve support for 10 million long\ncontext inference efficiently, while satisfying production-grade SLOs on TBT\n(30ms) on contexts up to and including 10 million."

The paper\ndescribes the use of models based on real time records and including solar\nslews, to investigate the most extreme wind variations likely to be encountered\nin future, enabling strategies to be devised to mitigate them. Wind lulls are\nsurprisingly frequent, occasionally lasting a week or more, and are always\nlikely to be beyond the capabilities of stored or imported electrical energy to\nmitigate them. The models indicate that there will be a continuing need for gas\npowered generation to mitigate wind lulls. Currently, Combined Cycle Gas\nTurbines (CCGTs) provide most of the dispatchable generation. However, CCGTs\nare not sufficiently fast acting to cope with the wind and solar slews\nanticipated in future. The paper suggests that a range of already proven\nfast-acting sources of dispatchable generation, including Open Cycle Gas\nTurbines (OCGTs), Internal Combustion Gas-Fired Reciprocating engines (ICGRs)\nand stored electrical energy systems, should be capable of coping with the\nlargest wind and solar slews likely to be encountered up to the year 2035.\nExamples are given of the recent introduction of these fast-acting sources of\ngeneration which, it is suggested, will progressively replace CCGTs as the wind\nand solar fleets increase in size. Moreover, we see the pattern of recent\ninvestments, summarised in the paper, as a good indication of likely future\ninvestments, with OCGT investments mainly serving the 440 kV grid, and ICGRs\nand stored electrical energy more local networks.",

One emerging\napplication of LLMs, navigating through websites and interacting with UI\nelements across various web pages, remains somewhat underexplored. We introduce\nSteward, a novel LLM-powered web automation tool designed to serve as a\ncost-effective, scalable, end-to-end solution for automating web interactions.\nTraditional browser automation frameworks like Selenium, Puppeteer, and\nPlaywright are not scalable for extensive web interaction tasks, such as\nstudying recommendation algorithms on platforms like YouTube and Twitter. These\nframeworks require manual coding of interactions, limiting their utility in\nlarge-scale or dynamic contexts.

One emerging\napplication of LLMs, navigating through websites and interacting with UI\nelements across various web pages, remains somewhat underexplored. We introduce\nSteward, a novel LLM-powered web automation tool designed to serve as a\ncost-effective, scalable, end-to-end solution for automating web interactions.\nTraditional browser automation frameworks like Selenium, Puppeteer, and\nPlaywright are not scalable for extensive web interaction tasks, such as\nstudying recommendation algorithms on platforms like YouTube and Twitter. These\nframeworks require manual coding of interactions, limiting their utility in\nlarge-scale or dynamic contexts.

In this paper, through trace-based experiments, we found\nthat the existing method for long sequences results in a high\nTime-To-First-Token (TTFT) due to sequential chunk processing, long\nTime-Between-Tokens (TBT) from batching long-sequence prefills and decodes, and\nlow throughput due to constrained key-value cache (KVC) for long sequences. To\naddress these issues, we propose two Sequence-Parallelism (SP) architectures\nfor both tensor parallelism (TP) and non-TP. However, SP introduces two\nchallenges: 1) network communication and computation become performance\nbottlenecks; 2) the latter two issues above are mitigated but not resolved, and\nSP's resultant KV value distribution across GPUs still requires communication\nfor decode, increasing TBT. Hence, we propose a Communication-efficient Sparse\nAttention (CSA) and communication-computation-communication three-phase\npipelining. We also propose SP-based decode that processes decode separately\nfrom prefill, distributes KV values of a request across different GPUs, and\nnovelly moves Query (Q) values instead of KV values to reduce communication\noverhead. These methods constitute a communication-efficient\nSequence-Parallelism based LLM Serving System (SPS2). Our trace-driven\nevaluation demonstrates that SPS2 improves the average TTFT, TBT, and response\ntime by up to 7.5x, 1.92x, and 9.8x and improves the prefill and decode\nthroughput by 8.2x and 5.2x while maintaining the accuracy compared to\nSarathi-Serve.

As the infrastructure for DL applications,\nJavaScript DL frameworks play a crucial role in the development and deployment.\nIt is essential to ensure the quality of JavaScript DL frameworks. However, the\nbottleneck of limited computational resources in the JavaScript environment\nbrings new challenges to framework testing. Specifically, JavaScript DL\nframeworks are equipped with various optimization mechanisms (e.g., cache\nreuse, inference acceleration) to overcome the bottleneck of limited\ncomputational resources. These optimization mechanisms are overlooked by\nexisting methods, resulting in many bugs in JavaScript DL frameworks being\nmissed. To address the above challenges, we propose a mutation-based JavaScript\nDL framework testing method named DLJSFuzzer. DLJSFuzzer designs 13 tensor\nmutation rules targeting the cache reuse mechanism to generate test input\ntensors. Besides, DLJSFuzzer designs eight model mutation rules targeting the\ninference acceleration mechanism to generate test input models. To evaluate the\neffectiveness of DLJSFuzzer, we conduct experiments on the most widely-used\nJavaScript DL framework, TensorFlow.js. The experimental results show that\nDLJSFuzzer outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both effectiveness and\nefficiency. DLJSFuzzer successfully detects 21 unique crashes and 126 unique\nNaN & Inconsistency bugs. All detected crashes have been reported to the\nopen-source community, with 12 of them already confirmed by developers.\nAdditionally, DLJSFuzzer has improved by over 47% in model generation\nefficiency and over 91% in bug detection efficiency compared to all baselines.",

We achieve this by using ferroelectric nanocrystals doped with rare\nearth ions producing upconversion (UC). When such a nanocrystal experiences a\nvariation of surrounding electric potential, its surface charge density\nchanges, inducing electric polarization modifications that vary, via converse\npiezoelectric effect, the crystal field around the ions. The latter variation\nis finally converted into UC spectral changes, enabling optical detection of\nelectric potential. To develop such a sensor, we synthesized erbium and\nytterbium-doped barium titanate crystals of size $\\approx160$~nm. We observed\ndistinct changes in the UC spectrum when individual nanocrystals were subjected\nto an external field via a conductive AFM tip, with a response time of\n100~$\\mu$s.

                    "value": "Understanding the dynamics of electrical signals within neuronal assemblies\nis crucial to unraveling complex brain function. Despite recent advances in\nemploying optically active nanostructures in transmembrane potential sensing,\nthere remains room for improvement in terms of response time and sensitivity.\nHere, we report the development of such a nanosensor capable of detecting\nelectric fields with a submillisecond response time at the single particle\nlevel. We achieve this by using ferroelectric nanocrystals doped with rare\nearth ions producing upconversion (UC). When such a nanocrystal experiences a\nvariation of surrounding electric potential, its surface charge density\nchanges, inducing electric polarization modifications that vary, via converse\npiezoelectric effect, the crystal field around the ions. The latter variation\nis finally converted into UC spectral changes, enabling optical detection of\nelectric potential. To develop such a sensor, we synthesized erbium and\nytterbium-doped barium titanate crystals of size $\\approx160$~nm. We observed\ndistinct changes in the UC spectrum when individual nanocrystals were subjected\nto an external field via a conductive AFM tip, with a response time of\n100~$\\mu$s. Furthermore, our sensor exhibits a remarkable sensitivity of\n4.8~kV/cm/$\\sqrt{\\rm Hz}$, enabling time-resolved detection of fast changing\nelectric field of amplitude comparable to that generated during a neuron action\npotential."

Recommending by user-wise result caches is widely used when the\nsystem cannot afford a real-time recommendation. However, it is challenging to\nallocate real-time and cached recommendations to maximize the users' overall\nengagement. This paper shows two key challenges to cache allocation, i.e., the\nvalue-strategy dependency and the streaming allocation. Then, we propose a\nreinforcement prediction-allocation framework (RPAF) to address these issues.\nRPAF is a reinforcement-learning-based two-stage framework containing\nprediction and allocation stages. The prediction stage estimates the values of\nthe cache choices considering the value-strategy dependency, and the allocation\nstage determines the cache choices for each individual request while satisfying\nthe global budget constraint. We show that the challenge of training RPAF\nincludes globality and the strictness of budget constraints, and a relaxed\nlocal allocator (RLA) is proposed to address this issue.

In the single-phase TPC, the proportional scintillation\nlight (S2) is generated in liquid xenon in close proximity to 10 {\\mu}m\ndiameter anode wires. The detector was characterized and the proportional\nscintillation process was studied using the 32.1 keV and 9.4 keV signals from\n83mKr decays. A charge gain factor g2 of up to (1.9 $\\pm$ 0.3) PE/electron was\nreached at an anode voltage 4.4 kV higher than the gate electrode 5 mm below\nit, corresponding to (29 $\\pm$ 6) photons emitted per ionization electron. The\nduration of S2 signals is dominated by electron diffusion and approaches the\nxenon de-excitation timescale for very short electron drift times. The electron\ndrift velocity and the longitudinal diffusion constant were measured at a drift\nfield of 470 V/cm. The results agree with the literature and demonstrate that a\nsingle-phase TPC can be operated successfully.",

To address these issues, we propose a\ntraining-free approach called Activation-aware Singular Value Decomposition\n(ASVD).

However, detailed experimental characterization of its\nintrinsic defects as well as its defect creation characteristics under electron\nirradiation are scarce. Here, we report on the creation and stability of a\nvariety of defect configurations under 60 kV electron irradiation in mono- and\nbilayer phosphorene including the first experimental reports of stable\nadatom-vacancy-complexes. Displacement cross section measurements in bilayer\nphosphorene yield a value of 7.7 +- 1.4 barn with an estimated lifetime of\nadatom-vacancy-complexes of 19.9 +- 0.7 s, while some are stable for up to 68 s\nunder continuous electron irradiation. Surprisingly, ab initio-based\nsimulations indicate that the complexes should readily recombine, even in\nstructures strained by up to 3 %. The presented results will help to improve\nthe understanding of the wide variety of defects in phosphorene, their\ncreation, and their stability, which may enable new pathways for defect\nengineered phosphorene devices.",

However, detailed experimental characterization of its\nintrinsic defects as well as its defect creation characteristics under electron\nirradiation are scarce. Here, we report on the creation and stability of a\nvariety of defect configurations under 60 kV electron irradiation in mono- and\nbilayer phosphorene including the first experimental reports of stable\nadatom-vacancy-complexes. Displacement cross section measurements in bilayer\nphosphorene yield a value of 7.7 +- 1.4 barn with an estimated lifetime of\nadatom-vacancy-complexes of 19.9 +- 0.7 s, while some are stable for up to 68 s\nunder continuous electron irradiation. Surprisingly, ab initio-based\nsimulations indicate that the complexes should readily recombine, even in\nstructures strained by up to 3 %. The presented results will help to improve\nthe understanding of the wide variety of defects in phosphorene, their\ncreation, and their stability, which may enable new pathways for defect\nengineered phosphorene devices."

In a vanilla language-free training stage, target audio is\nencoded using the pre-trained CLAP audio encoder to form a condition embedding\nfor the TSE model, while during inference, user language queries are encoded by\nCLAP text encoder. This straightforward approach faces challenges due to the\nmodality gap between training and inference queries and information leakage\nfrom direct exposure to target audio during training. To address this, we\npropose a retrieval-augmented strategy. Specifically, we create an embedding\ncache using audio captions generated by a large language model (LLM). During\ntraining, target audio embeddings retrieve text embeddings from this cache to\nuse as condition embeddings, ensuring consistent modalities between training\nand inference and eliminating information leakage.

In a vanilla language-free training stage, target audio is\nencoded using the pre-trained CLAP audio encoder to form a condition embedding\nfor the TSE model, while during inference, user language queries are encoded by\nCLAP text encoder. This straightforward approach faces challenges due to the\nmodality gap between training and inference queries and information leakage\nfrom direct exposure to target audio during training. To address this, we\npropose a retrieval-augmented strategy. Specifically, we create an embedding\ncache using audio captions generated by a large language model (LLM). During\ntraining, target audio embeddings retrieve text embeddings from this cache to\nuse as condition embeddings, ensuring consistent modalities between training\nand inference and eliminating information leakage. Extensive experiment results\nshow that our retrieval-augmented approach achieves consistent and notable\nperformance improvements over existing state-of-the-art with better\ngeneralizability."

In this paper we question this wisdom in the light of\nmodern hardware and workloads, particularly in cloud servers.

We quantitatively demonstrate these advantages using three use-cases:\nfine-grained RPC-style invocation of functions on an accelerator, offloading of\noperators in a streaming dataflow engine, and a network interface targeting for\nserverless functions.

Despite these findings, our\nresults surpass previous THz plasma-driven electron generation by an order of\nmagnitude in both electron energy and bunch charge and a path to increasing\nthese by an additional order of magnitude by modification of the THz optics is\nproposed."

Using these representations for more\ngeneral inverse rendering -- reconstructing geometry, materials, and lighting\nfrom observed images -- is challenging because recursively path-tracing such\nvolumetric representations is expensive. Recent works alleviate this issue\nthrough the use of radiance caches: data structures that store the\nsteady-state, infinite-bounce radiance arriving at any point from any\ndirection. However, these solutions rely on approximations that introduce bias\ninto the renderings and, more importantly, into the gradients used for\noptimization. We present a method that avoids these approximations while\nremaining computationally efficient. In particular, we leverage two techniques\nto reduce variance for unbiased estimators of the rendering equation: (1) an\nocclusion-aware importance sampler for incoming illumination and (2) a fast\ncache architecture that can be used as a control variate for the radiance from\na high-quality, but more expensive, volumetric cache.

                "summary": "A critical approach for efficiently deploying computationally demanding large\nlanguage models (LLMs) is Key-Value (KV) caching. The KV cache stores key-value\nstates of previously generated tokens, significantly reducing the need for\nrepetitive computations and thereby lowering latency in autoregressive\ngeneration. However, the size of the KV cache grows linearly with sequence\nlength, posing challenges for applications requiring long context input and\nextensive sequence generation. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective\napproach, called MiniCache, to compress the KV cache across layers from a novel\ndepth perspective, significantly reducing the memory footprint for LLM\ninference. Our approach is based on the observation that KV cache states\nexhibit high similarity between the adjacent layers in the middle-to-deep\nportion of LLMs. To facilitate merging, we propose disentangling the states\ninto the magnitude and direction components, interpolating the directions of\nthe state vectors while preserving their lengths unchanged. Furthermore, we\nintroduce a token retention strategy to keep highly distinct state pairs\nunmerged, thus preserving the information with minimal additional storage\noverhead. Our MiniCache is training-free and general, complementing existing KV\ncache compression strategies, such as quantization and sparsity. We conduct a\ncomprehensive evaluation of MiniCache utilizing various models including\nLLaMA-2, LLaMA-3, Phi-3, Mistral, and Mixtral across multiple benchmarks,\ndemonstrating its exceptional performance in achieving superior compression\nratios and high throughput. On the ShareGPT dataset, LLaMA-2-7B with 4-bit\nMiniCache achieves a remarkable compression ratio of up to 5.02x, enhances\ninference throughput by approximately 5x, and reduces the memory footprint by\n41% compared to the FP16 full cache baseline, all while maintaining\nnear-lossless performance.",

An attacker could exploit these KV pairs to\nreconstruct the entire user conversation, leading to significant\nvulnerabilities. Existing solutions, such as Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)\nand Trusted Execution Environments (TEE), are either too computation-intensive\nor resource-limited. To address these issues, we designed KV-Shield, which\noperates in two phases. In the initialization phase, it permutes the weight\nmatrices so that all KV pairs are correspondingly permuted. During the runtime\nphase, the attention vector is inversely permuted to ensure the correctness of\nthe layer output. All permutation-related operations are executed within the\nTEE, ensuring that insecure GPUs cannot access the original KV pairs, thus\npreventing conversation reconstruction. Finally, we theoretically analyze the\ncorrectness of KV-Shield, along with its advantages and overhead.",

This paper introduces SELCC; a\nShared-Exclusive Latch Cache Coherence protocol that maintains cache coherence\nwithout imposing any computational burden on the remote memory side. SELCC\nbuilds on a one-sided shared-exclusive latch protocol by introducing lazy latch\nrelease and invalidation messages among the compute nodes so that it can\nguarantee both data access atomicity and cache coherence. SELCC minimizes\ncommunication round-trips by embedding the current cache copy holder IDs into\nRDMA latch words and prioritizes local concurrency control over global\nconcurrency control. We instantiate the SELCC protocol onto compute-sided\ncache, forming an abstraction layer over disaggregated memory.

To demonstrate the usability of SELCC, we\nimplement a B-tree and three transaction concurrency control algorithms over\nSELCC's APIs.

The\nchanges in the orbital period of the close binary were analyzed based on 262\nnew times of light maximum together with those compiled from the literature.

Therefore, the cyclic variation was plausibly\nexplained as the light-travel time effect via the presence of a tertiary\ncomponent, which is supported by the periodic changes of the O-C curve and the\nrather symmetric and stable light curves obtained by TESS. The mass of the\ntertiary companion is determined to be M_3sini' = 0.060(7) M_sun. If the third\nbody is coplanar with the central binary (i.e., i' = 62.5{\\deg}), the mass of\nthe tertiary component is computed as M_3 ~ 0.068 M\\sun, and thus it would be\nbelow the stable hydrogen-burning limit and is a brown dwarf.

However, long-context LLM inference is challenging since the\ninference speed decreases significantly as the sequence length grows. This\nslowdown is primarily caused by loading a large KV cache during self-attention.\nPrevious works have shown that a small portion of critical tokens will dominate\nthe attention outcomes. However, we observe the criticality of a token highly\ndepends on the query. To this end, we propose Quest, a query-aware KV cache\nselection algorithm. Quest keeps track of the minimal and maximal Key values in\nKV cache pages and estimates the criticality of a given page using Query\nvectors. By only loading the Top-K critical KV cache pages for attention, Quest\nsignificantly speeds up self-attention without sacrificing accuracy. We show\nthat Quest can achieve up to 2.23x self-attention speedup, which reduces\ninference latency by 7.03x while performing well on tasks with long\ndependencies with negligible accuracy loss.

In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive\nevaluation of existing semantic occupancy prediction models from a reliability\nperspective for the first time. Despite the gradual alignment of camera-based\nmodels with LiDAR in term of accuracy, a significant reliability gap persists.\nTo addresses this concern, we propose ReliOcc, a method designed to enhance the\nreliability of camera-based occupancy networks. ReliOcc provides a\nplug-and-play scheme for existing models, which integrates hybrid uncertainty\nfrom individual voxels with sampling-based noise and relative voxels through\nmix-up learning. Besides, an uncertainty-aware calibration strategy is devised\nto further enhance model reliability in offline mode. Extensive experiments\nunder various settings demonstrate that ReliOcc significantly enhances model\nreliability while maintaining the accuracy of both geometric and semantic\npredictions.

In this article, we attempt to build a nonparametric\ninference framework for stochastic SIR models with time dependent infection\nrate. The framework includes three main steps: likelihood approximation,\nparameter estimation and confidence interval construction.

In this article, we attempt to build a nonparametric\ninference framework for stochastic SIR models with time dependent infection\nrate. The framework includes three main steps: likelihood approximation,\nparameter estimation and confidence interval construction.

The AMMORE dataset enables various potential analyses and provides an\nimportant resource for researching student math acquisition in understudied,\nreal-world, educational contexts. In experiment 1 we use a variety of\nLLM-driven approaches, including zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought\nprompting, to grade the 1% of student answers that a rule-based classifier\nfails to grade accurately. We find that the best-performing approach --\nchain-of-thought prompting -- accurately scored 92% of these edge cases,\neffectively boosting the overall accuracy of the grading from 98.7% to 99.9%.\nIn experiment 2, we aim to better understand the consequential validity of the\nimproved grading accuracy, by passing grades generated by the best-performing\nLLM-based approach to a Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) model, which estimated\nstudent mastery of specific lessons. We find that relatively modest\nimprovements in model accuracy at the individual question level can lead to\nsignificant changes in the estimation of student mastery. Where the rules-based\nclassifier currently used to grade student, answers misclassified the mastery\nstatus of 6.9% of students across their completed lessons, using the LLM\nchain-of-thought approach this misclassification rate was reduced to 2.6% of\nstudents. Taken together, these findings suggest that LLMs could be a valuable\ntool for grading open-response questions in K-12 mathematics education,\npotentially enabling encouraging wider adoption of open-ended questions in\nformative assessment.",

These regions emerge during\ntraining and become more defined as training progresses or model size\nincreases. The regions appear to be much larger than previously studied\npolytopes. Our analysis suggests that these stable regions align with semantic\ndistinctions, where similar prompts cluster within regions, and activations\nfrom the same region lead to similar next token predictions. This work provides\na promising research direction for understanding the complexity of neural\nnetworks, shedding light on training dynamics, and advancing interpretability."

However, current learnable prompt tokens are primarily used\nfor the single phase of adapting to tasks (i.e., adapting prompt), easily\nleading to overfitting risks. In this work, we propose a novel Cascade Prompt\nLearning CasPL framework to enable prompt learning to serve both generic and\nspecific expertise (i.e., boosting and adapting prompt) simultaneously.\nSpecifically, CasPL is a new learning paradigm comprising two distinct phases\nof learnable prompts: the first boosting prompt is crafted to extract\ndomain-general knowledge from a senior larger CLIP teacher model by aligning\ntheir predicted logits using extensive unlabeled domain images. The second\nadapting prompt is then cascaded with the frozen first set to fine-tune the\ndownstream tasks, following the approaches employed in prior research. In this\nmanner, CasPL can effectively capture both domain-general and task-specific\nrepresentations into explicitly different gradual groups of prompts, thus\npotentially alleviating overfitting issues in the target domain. It's worth\nnoting that CasPL serves as a plug-and-play module that can seamlessly\nintegrate into any existing prompt learning approach. CasPL achieves a\nsignificantly better balance between performance and inference speed, which is\nespecially beneficial for deploying smaller VLM models in resource-constrained\nenvironments. Compared to the previous state-of-the-art method PromptSRC, CasPL\nshows an average improvement of 1.85% for base classes, 3.44% for novel\nclasses, and 2.72% for the harmonic mean over 11 image classification datasets.\nCode is publicly available at: https://github.com/megvii-research/CasPL.",

In this paper, we present DoSSR, a\nDomain Shift diffusion-based SR model that capitalizes on the generative powers\nof pretrained diffusion models while significantly enhancing efficiency by\ninitiating the diffusion process with low-resolution (LR) images. At the core\nof our approach is a domain shift equation that integrates seamlessly with\nexisting diffusion models. This integration not only improves the use of\ndiffusion prior but also boosts inference efficiency. Moreover, we advance our\nmethod by transitioning the discrete shift process to a continuous formulation,\ntermed as DoS-SDEs. This advancement leads to the fast and customized solvers\nthat further enhance sampling efficiency. Empirical results demonstrate that\nour proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on synthetic and\nreal-world datasets, while notably requiring only 5 sampling steps.

Moreover, we advance our\nmethod by transitioning the discrete shift process to a continuous formulation,\ntermed as DoS-SDEs. This advancement leads to the fast and customized solvers\nthat further enhance sampling efficiency. Empirical results demonstrate that\nour proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on synthetic and\nreal-world datasets, while notably requiring only 5 sampling steps. Compared to\nprevious diffusion prior based methods, our approach achieves a remarkable\nspeedup of 5-7 times, demonstrating its superior efficiency. Code:\nhttps://github.com/QinpengCui/DoSSR."

This has led to lawsuits against tech companies\naccused of using protected content without permission. Membership Inference\nAttacks (MIAs) aim to detect whether specific documents were used in a given\nLLM pretraining, but their effectiveness is undermined by biases such as\ntime-shifts and n-gram overlaps.\n  This paper addresses the evaluation of MIAs on LLMs with partially inferable\ntraining sets, under the ex-post hypothesis, which acknowledges inherent\ndistributional biases between members and non-members datasets. We propose and\nvalidate algorithms to create ``non-biased'' and ``non-classifiable'' datasets\nfor fairer MIA assessment. Experiments using the Gutenberg dataset on OpenLamma\nand Pythia show that neutralizing known biases alone is insufficient. Our\nmethods produce non-biased ex-post datasets with AUC-ROC scores comparable to\nthose previously obtained on genuinely random datasets, validating our\napproach. Globally, MIAs yield results close to random, with only one being\neffective on both random and our datasets, but its performance decreases when\nbias is removed.",

This has led to lawsuits against tech companies\naccused of using protected content without permission. Membership Inference\nAttacks (MIAs) aim to detect whether specific documents were used in a given\nLLM pretraining, but their effectiveness is undermined by biases such as\ntime-shifts and n-gram overlaps.\n  This paper addresses the evaluation of MIAs on LLMs with partially inferable\ntraining sets, under the ex-post hypothesis, which acknowledges inherent\ndistributional biases between members and non-members datasets. We propose and\nvalidate algorithms to create ``non-biased'' and ``non-classifiable'' datasets\nfor fairer MIA assessment. Experiments using the Gutenberg dataset on OpenLamma\nand Pythia show that neutralizing known biases alone is insufficient. Our\nmethods produce non-biased ex-post datasets with AUC-ROC scores comparable to\nthose previously obtained on genuinely random datasets, validating our\napproach. Globally, MIAs yield results close to random, with only one being\neffective on both random and our datasets, but its performance decreases when\nbias is removed."

This\npool synergizes static textual content with structured graph guidance,\nfostering a reflective trial-and-error approach for navigating and identifying\nrelevant segments. Our evaluation across multiple-choice questions (MCQ) and\nmulti-document question answering (Multi-doc QA) benchmarks showcases QRMeM\nenhanced performance compared to existing approaches."

Domain-adapted\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) provide a promising solution by facilitating data\nfusion between extensive EO data and semantic EO data. By improving integration\nand interpretation of diverse datasets, LLMs address the challenges of\nprocessing specialized information in agriculture and disaster response\napplications.

This paper presents a framework for semantic communication in EO\nsatellite networks, aimed at improving data transmission efficiency and overall\nsystem performance through cognitive processing techniques. The proposed system\nemploys Discrete-Task-Oriented Source-Channel Coding (DT-JSCC) and Semantic\nData Augmentation (SA) to focus on relevant information while minimizing\ncommunication overhead. By integrating cognitive semantic processing and\ninter-satellite links, the framework enhances the analysis and transmission of\nmultispectral satellite imagery, improving object detection, pattern\nrecognition, and real-time decision-making. The introduction of Cognitive\nSemantic Augmentation (CSA) allows satellites to process and transmit semantic\ninformation, boosting adaptability to changing environments and application\nneeds.

                "summary": "Inference-time techniques are emerging as highly effective tools to increase\nlarge language model (LLM) capabilities. However, there is still limited\nunderstanding of the best practices for developing systems that combine\ninference-time techniques with one or more LLMs, with challenges including: (1)\neffectively allocating inference compute budget, (2) understanding the\ninteractions between different combinations of inference-time techniques and\ntheir impact on downstream performance, and 3) efficiently searching over the\nlarge space of model choices, inference-time techniques, and their\ncompositions. To address these challenges, we introduce Archon, an automated\nframework for designing inference-time architectures. Archon defines an\nextensible design space, encompassing methods such as generation ensembling,\nmulti-sampling, ranking, fusion, critiquing, verification, and unit testing. It\nthen transforms the problem of selecting and combining LLMs and inference-time\ntechniques into a hyperparameter optimization objective. To optimize this\nobjective, we introduce automated Inference-Time Architecture Search (ITAS)\nalgorithms. Given target benchmark(s), an inference compute budget, and\navailable LLMs, ITAS outputs optimized architectures. We evaluate Archon\narchitectures across a wide range of instruction-following and reasoning\nbenchmarks, including MT-Bench, Arena-Hard-Auto, AlpacaEval 2.0, MixEval,\nMixEval Hard, MATH, and CodeContests. We show that automatically designed\ninference-time architectures by Archon outperform strong models such as GPT-4o\nand Claude 3.5 Sonnet on these benchmarks, achieving an average increase of\n15.1 and 11.2 percentage points with all-source models and open-source models,\nrespectively. We make our code and datasets available publicly on Github:\nhttps://github.com/ScalingIntelligence/Archon.",

                    "value": "Inference-time techniques are emerging as highly effective tools to increase\nlarge language model (LLM) capabilities. However, there is still limited\nunderstanding of the best practices for developing systems that combine\ninference-time techniques with one or more LLMs, with challenges including: (1)\neffectively allocating inference compute budget, (2) understanding the\ninteractions between different combinations of inference-time techniques and\ntheir impact on downstream performance, and 3) efficiently searching over the\nlarge space of model choices, inference-time techniques, and their\ncompositions. To address these challenges, we introduce Archon, an automated\nframework for designing inference-time architectures. Archon defines an\nextensible design space, encompassing methods such as generation ensembling,\nmulti-sampling, ranking, fusion, critiquing, verification, and unit testing. It\nthen transforms the problem of selecting and combining LLMs and inference-time\ntechniques into a hyperparameter optimization objective. To optimize this\nobjective, we introduce automated Inference-Time Architecture Search (ITAS)\nalgorithms. Given target benchmark(s), an inference compute budget, and\navailable LLMs, ITAS outputs optimized architectures. We evaluate Archon\narchitectures across a wide range of instruction-following and reasoning\nbenchmarks, including MT-Bench, Arena-Hard-Auto, AlpacaEval 2.0, MixEval,\nMixEval Hard, MATH, and CodeContests. We show that automatically designed\ninference-time architectures by Archon outperform strong models such as GPT-4o\nand Claude 3.5 Sonnet on these benchmarks, achieving an average increase of\n15.1 and 11.2 percentage points with all-source models and open-source models,\nrespectively. We make our code and datasets available publicly on Github:\nhttps://github.com/ScalingIntelligence/Archon."

For normal value encoding, it provides 7 exponent values with 3-bit\nmantissa, 8 exponent values with 2-bit mantissa, and 16 exponent values with\n1-bit mantissa. For denormal value encoding, it extends the dynamic range by 7\nextra powers of 2, from 31 to 38 binades (notice that FP16 covers 40 binades).\nMeanwhile, HiF8 encodes all the special values except that positive zero and\nnegative zero are represented by only one bit-pattern. Thanks to the better\nbalance between precision and dynamic range, HiF8 can be simultaneously used in\nboth forward and backward passes of AI training. In this paper, we will\ndescribe the definition and rounding methods of HiF8, as well as the tentative\ntraining and inference solutions. To demonstrate the efficacy of HiF8, massive\nsimulation results on various neural networks, including traditional neural\nnetworks and large language models (LLMs), will also be presented.",

In addition, we\nconducted a case study on three LLMs (ChatGPT, MagiCoder, and DeepSeek Coder)\nand Java Runtime Environment 8 to demonstrate the framework's effectiveness.\nOur findings reveal substantial variability in LLM performance across tasks,\nwith ChatGPT adhering better to instructions, while sharing similar\neffectiveness in code example generation with its counterparts (i.e., MagiCoder\nand DeekSeek Coder). We also identify key factors associated with code quality,\nsuch as API popularity and model confidence, and build classifiers that achieve\nhigh accuracy in detecting incorrect API recommendations and erroneous code\nexamples.

The AMMORE dataset enables various potential analyses and provides an\nimportant resource for researching student math acquisition in understudied,\nreal-world, educational contexts. In experiment 1 we use a variety of\nLLM-driven approaches, including zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought\nprompting, to grade the 1% of student answers that a rule-based classifier\nfails to grade accurately. We find that the best-performing approach --\nchain-of-thought prompting -- accurately scored 92% of these edge cases,\neffectively boosting the overall accuracy of the grading from 98.7% to 99.9%.\nIn experiment 2, we aim to better understand the consequential validity of the\nimproved grading accuracy, by passing grades generated by the best-performing\nLLM-based approach to a Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) model, which estimated\nstudent mastery of specific lessons. We find that relatively modest\nimprovements in model accuracy at the individual question level can lead to\nsignificant changes in the estimation of student mastery. Where the rules-based\nclassifier currently used to grade student, answers misclassified the mastery\nstatus of 6.9% of students across their completed lessons, using the LLM\nchain-of-thought approach this misclassification rate was reduced to 2.6% of\nstudents. Taken together, these findings suggest that LLMs could be a valuable\ntool for grading open-response questions in K-12 mathematics education,\npotentially enabling encouraging wider adoption of open-ended questions in\nformative assessment.",

Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising\nability to generate text in response to input prompts. We use ChatGPT 3.5 to\nautomatically structure and expand medication statements in discharge summaries\nand thus make them easier to interpret for people and machines. Methods:\nNamed-entity Recognition (NER) and Text Expansion (EX) are used in a zero- and\nfew-shot setting with different prompt strategies. 100 medication statements\nwere manually annotated and curated. NER performance was measured by using\nstrict and partial matching. For the task EX, two experts interpreted the\nresults by assessing semantic equivalence between original and expanded\nstatements. The model performance was measured by precision, recall, and F1\nscore. Results: For NER, the best-performing prompt reached an average F1 score\nof 0.94 in the test set. For EX, the few-shot prompt showed superior\nperformance among other prompts, with an average F1 score of 0.87. Conclusion:\nOur study demonstrates good performance for NER and EX tasks in free-text\nmedication statements using ChatGPT. Compared to a zero-shot baseline, a\nfew-shot approach prevented the system from hallucinating, which would be\nunacceptable when processing safety-relevant medication data.",

However, prompt\nengineering and resource efficiency remain significant bottlenecks in\ndeveloping optimal and robust RAG solutions for real-world QA applications.\nRecent studies have shown success in using fine tuning to address these\nproblems; in particular, Retrieval Augmented Fine Tuning (RAFT) applied to\nsmaller 7B models has demonstrated superior performance compared to RAG setups\nwith much larger models such as GPT-3.5. The combination of RAFT with\nparameter-efficient fine tuning (PEFT) techniques, such as Low-Rank Adaptation\n(LoRA), promises an even more efficient solution, yet remains an unexplored\narea. In this work, we combine RAFT with LoRA to reduce fine tuning and storage\nrequirements and gain faster inference times while maintaining comparable RAG\nperformance. This results in a more compute-efficient RAFT, or CRAFT, which is\nparticularly useful for knowledge-intensive QA tasks in resource-constrained\nenvironments where internet access may be restricted and hardware resources\nlimited.",

However, prompt\nengineering and resource efficiency remain significant bottlenecks in\ndeveloping optimal and robust RAG solutions for real-world QA applications.\nRecent studies have shown success in using fine tuning to address these\nproblems; in particular, Retrieval Augmented Fine Tuning (RAFT) applied to\nsmaller 7B models has demonstrated superior performance compared to RAG setups\nwith much larger models such as GPT-3.5. The combination of RAFT with\nparameter-efficient fine tuning (PEFT) techniques, such as Low-Rank Adaptation\n(LoRA), promises an even more efficient solution, yet remains an unexplored\narea. In this work, we combine RAFT with LoRA to reduce fine tuning and storage\nrequirements and gain faster inference times while maintaining comparable RAG\nperformance. This results in a more compute-efficient RAFT, or CRAFT, which is\nparticularly useful for knowledge-intensive QA tasks in resource-constrained\nenvironments where internet access may be restricted and hardware resources\nlimited."

We\nexperiment with the SeCoKD across three LLMs and six benchmarks focusing mainly\non reasoning tasks. Results show that our method outperforms the base model and\nSupervised Fine-tuning ( SFT ), especially in zero-shot and one-shot settings\nby 30% and 10%, respectively. Moreover, SeCoKD brings little negative artifacts\nwhen evaluated on new tasks, which is more robust than Supervised Fine-tuning.",

In this\nwork, we investigate if we can reduce the shot number while still maintaining a\ncompetitive performance. We present SeCoKD, a self-Knowledge Distillation ( KD\n) training framework that aligns the student model with a heavily prompted\nvariation, thereby increasing the utilization of a single demonstration. We\nexperiment with the SeCoKD across three LLMs and six benchmarks focusing mainly\non reasoning tasks. Results show that our method outperforms the base model and\nSupervised Fine-tuning ( SFT ), especially in zero-shot and one-shot settings\nby 30% and 10%, respectively. Moreover, SeCoKD brings little negative artifacts\nwhen evaluated on new tasks, which is more robust than Supervised Fine-tuning."

The excessive private information on mobile\nscreens necessitates small, on-device models to power these assistants.\nHowever, there is a lack of a comprehensive and large-scale mobile screen\ndataset with high diversity to train and enhance these models. To efficiently\nconstruct such a dataset, we utilize an LLM-enhanced automatic app traversal\ntool to minimize human intervention. We then employ two SoC clusters to provide\nhigh-fidelity mobile environments, including more than 200 Android instances to\nparallelize app interactions. By utilizing the system to collect mobile screens\nover 81,600 device-hours, we introduce MobileViews, the largest mobile screen\ndataset, which includes over 600K screenshot-view hierarchy pairs from more\nthan 20K modern Android apps. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MobileViews\nby training SOTA multimodal LLMs that power mobile screen assistants on it and\nthe Rico dataset, which was introduced seven years ago. Evaluation results on\nmobile screen tasks show that the scale and quality of mobile screens in\nMobileViews demonstrate significant advantages over Rico in augmenting mobile\nscreen assistants.",

The excessive private information on mobile\nscreens necessitates small, on-device models to power these assistants.\nHowever, there is a lack of a comprehensive and large-scale mobile screen\ndataset with high diversity to train and enhance these models. To efficiently\nconstruct such a dataset, we utilize an LLM-enhanced automatic app traversal\ntool to minimize human intervention. We then employ two SoC clusters to provide\nhigh-fidelity mobile environments, including more than 200 Android instances to\nparallelize app interactions. By utilizing the system to collect mobile screens\nover 81,600 device-hours, we introduce MobileViews, the largest mobile screen\ndataset, which includes over 600K screenshot-view hierarchy pairs from more\nthan 20K modern Android apps. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MobileViews\nby training SOTA multimodal LLMs that power mobile screen assistants on it and\nthe Rico dataset, which was introduced seven years ago. Evaluation results on\nmobile screen tasks show that the scale and quality of mobile screens in\nMobileViews demonstrate significant advantages over Rico in augmenting mobile\nscreen assistants."

                "summary": "Software testing is a crucial phase in the software life cycle, helping\nidentify potential risks and reduce maintenance costs. With the advancement of\nLarge Language Models (LLMs), researchers have proposed an increasing number of\nLLM-based software testing techniques, particularly in the area of test case\ngeneration. Despite the growing interest, limited efforts have been made to\nthoroughly evaluate the actual capabilities of LLMs in this task.\n  In this paper, we introduce TestBench, a benchmark for class-level LLM-based\ntest case generation. We construct a dataset of 108 Java programs from 9\nreal-world, large-scale projects on GitHub, each representing a different\nthematic domain. We then design three distinct types of prompts based on\ncontext descriptions, including self-contained context, full context, and\nsimple context. Besides, we propose a fine-grained evaluation framework that\nconsiders five aspects of test cases: syntactic correctness, compilation\ncorrectness, test correctness, code coverage rate, and defect detection rate.\nFurthermore, we propose a heuristic algorithm to repair erroneous test cases\ngenerated by LLMs. We evaluate CodeLlama-13b, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4 on the\nTestBench, and our experimental results indicate that larger models demonstrate\na greater ability to effectively utilize contextual information, thus\ngenerating higher-quality test cases. Smaller models may struggle with the\nnoise introduced by the extensive information contained within the full\ncontext. However, when using the simplified version, namely the simple context,\nwhich is derived from the full context via abstract syntax tree analysis, the\nperformance of these models improves significantly. Our analysis highlights the\ncurrent progress and pinpoints future directions to further enhance the\neffectiveness of models by handling contextual information for test case\ngeneration.",

                    "value": "Software testing is a crucial phase in the software life cycle, helping\nidentify potential risks and reduce maintenance costs. With the advancement of\nLarge Language Models (LLMs), researchers have proposed an increasing number of\nLLM-based software testing techniques, particularly in the area of test case\ngeneration. Despite the growing interest, limited efforts have been made to\nthoroughly evaluate the actual capabilities of LLMs in this task.\n  In this paper, we introduce TestBench, a benchmark for class-level LLM-based\ntest case generation. We construct a dataset of 108 Java programs from 9\nreal-world, large-scale projects on GitHub, each representing a different\nthematic domain. We then design three distinct types of prompts based on\ncontext descriptions, including self-contained context, full context, and\nsimple context. Besides, we propose a fine-grained evaluation framework that\nconsiders five aspects of test cases: syntactic correctness, compilation\ncorrectness, test correctness, code coverage rate, and defect detection rate.\nFurthermore, we propose a heuristic algorithm to repair erroneous test cases\ngenerated by LLMs. We evaluate CodeLlama-13b, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4 on the\nTestBench, and our experimental results indicate that larger models demonstrate\na greater ability to effectively utilize contextual information, thus\ngenerating higher-quality test cases. Smaller models may struggle with the\nnoise introduced by the extensive information contained within the full\ncontext. However, when using the simplified version, namely the simple context,\nwhich is derived from the full context via abstract syntax tree analysis, the\nperformance of these models improves significantly. Our analysis highlights the\ncurrent progress and pinpoints future directions to further enhance the\neffectiveness of models by handling contextual information for test case\ngeneration."

                "summary": "Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction is a crucial task in online\nrecommendation platforms as it involves estimating the probability of user\nengagement with advertisements or items by clicking on them. Given the\navailability of various services like online shopping, ride-sharing, food\ndelivery, and professional services on commercial platforms, recommendation\nsystems in these platforms are required to make CTR predictions across multiple\ndomains rather than just a single domain. However, multi-domain click-through\nrate (MDCTR) prediction remains a challenging task in online recommendation due\nto the complex mutual influence between domains. Traditional MDCTR models\ntypically encode domains as discrete identifiers, ignoring rich semantic\ninformation underlying. Consequently, they can hardly generalize to new\ndomains. Besides, existing models can be easily dominated by some specific\ndomains, which results in significant performance drops in the other domains\n(i.e. the \"seesaw phenomenon\"). In this paper, we propose a novel solution\nUni-CTR to address the above challenges. Uni-CTR leverages a backbone Large\nLanguage Model (LLM) to learn layer-wise semantic representations that capture\ncommonalities between domains. Uni-CTR also uses several domain-specific\nnetworks to capture the characteristics of each domain. Note that we design a\nmasked loss strategy so that these domain-specific networks are decoupled from\nbackbone LLM. This allows domain-specific networks to remain unchanged when\nincorporating new or removing domains, thereby enhancing the flexibility and\nscalability of the system significantly. Experimental results on three public\ndatasets show that Uni-CTR outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) MDCTR models\nsignificantly. Furthermore, Uni-CTR demonstrates remarkable effectiveness in\nzero-shot prediction. We have applied Uni-CTR in industrial scenarios,\nconfirming its efficiency.",

Given the\navailability of various services like online shopping, ride-sharing, food\ndelivery, and professional services on commercial platforms, recommendation\nsystems in these platforms are required to make CTR predictions across multiple\ndomains rather than just a single domain. However, multi-domain click-through\nrate (MDCTR) prediction remains a challenging task in online recommendation due\nto the complex mutual influence between domains. Traditional MDCTR models\ntypically encode domains as discrete identifiers, ignoring rich semantic\ninformation underlying. Consequently, they can hardly generalize to new\ndomains. Besides, existing models can be easily dominated by some specific\ndomains, which results in significant performance drops in the other domains\n(i.e. the \"seesaw phenomenon\"). In this paper, we propose a novel solution\nUni-CTR to address the above challenges. Uni-CTR leverages a backbone Large\nLanguage Model (LLM) to learn layer-wise semantic representations that capture\ncommonalities between domains. Uni-CTR also uses several domain-specific\nnetworks to capture the characteristics of each domain. Note that we design a\nmasked loss strategy so that these domain-specific networks are decoupled from\nbackbone LLM. This allows domain-specific networks to remain unchanged when\nincorporating new or removing domains, thereby enhancing the flexibility and\nscalability of the system significantly. Experimental results on three public\ndatasets show that Uni-CTR outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) MDCTR models\nsignificantly. Furthermore, Uni-CTR demonstrates remarkable effectiveness in\nzero-shot prediction. We have applied Uni-CTR in industrial scenarios,\nconfirming its efficiency."

We assessed MaskLLM\nusing 2:4 sparsity on various LLMs, including LLaMA-2, Nemotron-4, and GPT-3,\nwith sizes ranging from 843M to 15B parameters, and our empirical results show\nsubstantial improvements over state-of-the-art methods. For instance, leading\napproaches achieve a perplexity (PPL) of 10 or greater on Wikitext compared to\nthe dense model's 5.12 PPL, but MaskLLM achieves a significantly lower 6.72 PPL\nsolely by learning the masks with frozen weights. Furthermore, MaskLLM's\nlearnable nature allows customized masks for lossless application of 2:4\nsparsity to downstream tasks or domains.

We assessed MaskLLM\nusing 2:4 sparsity on various LLMs, including LLaMA-2, Nemotron-4, and GPT-3,\nwith sizes ranging from 843M to 15B parameters, and our empirical results show\nsubstantial improvements over state-of-the-art methods. For instance, leading\napproaches achieve a perplexity (PPL) of 10 or greater on Wikitext compared to\nthe dense model's 5.12 PPL, but MaskLLM achieves a significantly lower 6.72 PPL\nsolely by learning the masks with frozen weights. Furthermore, MaskLLM's\nlearnable nature allows customized masks for lossless application of 2:4\nsparsity to downstream tasks or domains.

To mitigate such risks, red teaming has\nbeen employed as a proactive security measure to probe language models for\nharmful outputs via jailbreak attacks. However, current jailbreak attack\napproaches are single-turn with explicit malicious queries that do not fully\ncapture the complexity of real-world interactions. In reality, users can engage\nin multi-turn interactions with LLM-based chat assistants, allowing them to\nconceal their true intentions in a more covert manner. To bridge this gap, we,\nfirst, propose a new jailbreak approach, RED QUEEN ATTACK. This method\nconstructs a multi-turn scenario, concealing the malicious intent under the\nguise of preventing harm. We craft 40 scenarios that vary in turns and select\n14 harmful categories to generate 56k multi-turn attack data points. We conduct\ncomprehensive experiments on the RED QUEEN ATTACK with four representative LLM\nfamilies of different sizes. Our experiments reveal that all LLMs are\nvulnerable to RED QUEEN ATTACK, reaching 87.62% attack success rate on GPT-4o\nand 75.4% on Llama3-70B. Further analysis reveals that larger models are more\nsusceptible to the RED QUEEN ATTACK, with multi-turn structures and concealment\nstrategies contributing to its success. To prioritize safety, we introduce a\nstraightforward mitigation strategy called RED QUEEN GUARD, which aligns LLMs\nto effectively counter adversarial attacks. This approach reduces the attack\nsuccess rate to below 1% while maintaining the model's performance across\nstandard benchmarks.

We show that FedAPM converges to a stationary point of\neven non-convex objectives while achieving the desired linear speedup property.\nWe corroborate our analysis with numerical experiments over diversified client\nunavailability dynamics on real-world data sets."

Moreover, we developed an algorithm that enables Autonomous\nVehicles (AVs) to respond dynamically to real-time traffic signal data,\nsimulating realistic V2X communication scenarios. Such high-fidelity simulation\nenvironments can generate multimodal data, including trajectory, semantic\ncamera, depth camera, and bird's eye view data for various traffic scenarios.\nThe generated scenarios and data provide invaluable insights into AVs'\ninteractions with traffic infrastructure and other road users. This work aims\nto bridge the gap between theoretical research and practical deployment of\nCAVs, facilitating the development of smarter and safer transportation systems."
