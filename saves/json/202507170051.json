Fast Ahead-of-Formation Optimization\n(FAFO) is the first blockchain transaction scheduler to address this problem by\nreordering transactions before block formation for maximum concurrency. FAFO\nuses CPU-optimized cache-friendly Bloom filters to efficiently detect conflicts\nand schedule parallel transaction execution at high throughput and low\noverhead.\n  We integrate the Rust EVM client (REVM) into FAFO and achieve over 1.1\nmillion native ETH transfers per second and over half a million ERC20 transfers\nper second on a single node (Table 1), with 91% lower cost compared to\nstate-of-the-art sharded execution. Unlike many other existing high throughput\nblockchain execution clients, FAFO uses QMDB to Merkleize world state after\nevery block, enabling light clients and stateless validation for ZK-based\nvApps. FAFO scales with minimal synchronization overhead, scaling linearly with\nadditional CPU resources until it fully exploits the maximum parallelism of the\nunderlying transaction flow.

                    "value": "Current blockchain execution throughput is limited by data contention,\nreducing execution layer parallelism. Fast Ahead-of-Formation Optimization\n(FAFO) is the first blockchain transaction scheduler to address this problem by\nreordering transactions before block formation for maximum concurrency. FAFO\nuses CPU-optimized cache-friendly Bloom filters to efficiently detect conflicts\nand schedule parallel transaction execution at high throughput and low\noverhead.\n  We integrate the Rust EVM client (REVM) into FAFO and achieve over 1.1\nmillion native ETH transfers per second and over half a million ERC20 transfers\nper second on a single node (Table 1), with 91% lower cost compared to\nstate-of-the-art sharded execution. Unlike many other existing high throughput\nblockchain execution clients, FAFO uses QMDB to Merkleize world state after\nevery block, enabling light clients and stateless validation for ZK-based\nvApps. FAFO scales with minimal synchronization overhead, scaling linearly with\nadditional CPU resources until it fully exploits the maximum parallelism of the\nunderlying transaction flow.

It is also more robust to adversarial attacks, and\nif the backbone has multilingual capabilities, it presents decent\ngeneralization to languages not seen during supervised training, with LLaMA3-1B\nreaching a mean macro-averaged F1 score of 81.46% in cross-validation with nine\nlanguages."

                "summary": "The Diffusion models, widely used for image generation, face significant\nchallenges related to their broad applicability due to prolonged inference\ntimes and high memory demands. Efficient Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is\ncrucial to address these issues. However, unlike traditional models, diffusion\nmodels critically rely on the time-step for the multi-round denoising.\nTypically, each time-step is encoded into a hypersensitive temporal feature by\nseveral modules. Despite this, existing PTQ methods do not optimize these\nmodules individually. Instead, they employ unsuitable reconstruction objectives\nand complex calibration methods, leading to significant disturbances in the\ntemporal feature and denoising trajectory, as well as reduced compression\nefficiency. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel quantization\nframework that includes three strategies: 1) TIB-based Maintenance: Based on\nour innovative Temporal Information Block (TIB) definition, Temporal\nInformation-aware Reconstruction (TIAR) and Finite Set Calibration (FSC) are\ndeveloped to efficiently align original temporal features. 2) Cache-based\nMaintenance: Instead of indirect and complex optimization for the related\nmodules, pre-computing and caching quantized counterparts of temporal features\nare developed to minimize errors. 3) Disturbance-aware Selection: Employ\ntemporal feature errors to guide a fine-grained selection between the two\nmaintenance strategies for further disturbance reduction. This framework\npreserves most of the temporal information and ensures high-quality end-to-end\ngeneration. Extensive testing on various datasets, diffusion models and\nhardware confirms our superior performance and acceleration.",

                    "value": "The Diffusion models, widely used for image generation, face significant\nchallenges related to their broad applicability due to prolonged inference\ntimes and high memory demands. Efficient Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is\ncrucial to address these issues. However, unlike traditional models, diffusion\nmodels critically rely on the time-step for the multi-round denoising.\nTypically, each time-step is encoded into a hypersensitive temporal feature by\nseveral modules. Despite this, existing PTQ methods do not optimize these\nmodules individually. Instead, they employ unsuitable reconstruction objectives\nand complex calibration methods, leading to significant disturbances in the\ntemporal feature and denoising trajectory, as well as reduced compression\nefficiency. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel quantization\nframework that includes three strategies: 1) TIB-based Maintenance: Based on\nour innovative Temporal Information Block (TIB) definition, Temporal\nInformation-aware Reconstruction (TIAR) and Finite Set Calibration (FSC) are\ndeveloped to efficiently align original temporal features. 2) Cache-based\nMaintenance: Instead of indirect and complex optimization for the related\nmodules, pre-computing and caching quantized counterparts of temporal features\nare developed to minimize errors. 3) Disturbance-aware Selection: Employ\ntemporal feature errors to guide a fine-grained selection between the two\nmaintenance strategies for further disturbance reduction. This framework\npreserves most of the temporal information and ensures high-quality end-to-end\ngeneration. Extensive testing on various datasets, diffusion models and\nhardware confirms our superior performance and acceleration."

On a single A100 node (8 GPUs), it\nsupports RL training on hour-long videos (e.g., 3,600 frames / around 256k\ntokens)."

To\naddress this, existing approaches compress KV caches across adjacent layers\nwith highly similar attention patterns. However, these methods often apply a\nfixed compression scheme across all conversations, selecting the same layer\npairs for compression without considering conversation-specific attention\ndynamics. This static strategy overlooks variability in attention pattern\nsimilarity across different conversations, which can lead to noticeable\naccuracy degradation.\n  We present Krul, a multi-turn LLM inference system that enables accurate and\nefficient KV cache restoration. Krul dynamically selects compression strategies\nbased on attention similarity across layer pairs and uses a\nrecomputation-loading pipeline to restore the KV cache. It introduces three key\ninnovations: 1) a preemptive compression strategy selector to preserve critical\ncontext for future conversation turns and selects a customized strategy for the\nconversation; 2) a token-wise heterogeneous attention similarity estimator to\nmitigate the attention similarity computation and storage overhead during model\ngeneration; 3) a bubble-free restoration scheduler to reduce potential bubbles\nbrought by the imbalance of recomputing and loading stream due to compressed KV\ncaches. Empirical evaluations on real-world tasks demonstrate that Krul\nachieves a 1.5x-2.68x reduction in time-to-first-token (TTFT) and a 1.33x-2.35x\nreduction in KV cache storage compared to state-of-the-art methods without\ncompromising generation quality.",

A common acceleration strategy involves reusing model outputs via\ncaching mechanisms at fixed intervals. However, we find that such\nfixed-frequency reuse significantly degrades quality in complex scenes, while\nmanually tuning reuse thresholds is inefficient and lacks robustness. To\naddress this, we propose Prompt-Complexity-Aware (PCA) caching, a method that\nautomatically adjusts reuse thresholds based on scene complexity estimated\ndirectly from the input prompt.

We also revisit the assumptions behind TeaCache and identify a\nkey limitation: it suffers from poor input-output relationship modeling due to\nan oversimplified prior. To overcome this, we decouple the noisy input, enhance\nthe contribution of meaningful textual information, and improve the model's\npredictive accuracy through multivariate polynomial feature expansion. To\nfurther reduce computational cost, we replace the static CFGCache with\nDynCFGCache, a dynamic mechanism that selectively reuses classifier-free\nguidance (CFG) outputs based on estimated output variations.

Two core bottlenecks dominate: accessing Feed-Forward Network (FFN)\nweights and reading long KV caches. While Tensor Parallelism (TP) helps\nmitigate the cost of FFN weight reads, it does not scale well for attention.\nWhen TP width exceeds the number of KV heads, it leads to inefficient KV\nduplication, limits parallelism, and constrains batch size. Simultaneously,\nDRAM reads for long KV histories scale linearly with batch size, further\ncapping efficiency.\n  We introduce Helix Parallelism, a hybrid execution strategy that applies KV\nparallelism during attention to shard KV caches across GPUs, then reuses the\nsame GPUs for TP in dense LLMs or TPxExpert Parallel (EP) in MoEs during FFN\ncomputation. To preserve exact attention behavior, Helix includes a lightweight\ncommunication step. To minimize the exposed communication cost, we introduce\nHelix HOP-B. Helix HOP-B effectively minimizes communication overhead through\nbatchwise overlap, preserving low TTL while improving GPU efficiency. Compared\nto conventional parallelism approaches, Helix reduces TTL by up to 1.5x at\nfixed batch sizes and supports up to 32x larger batches under the same latency\nbudget for DeepSeek-R1, pushing forward the throughput-latency Pareto on\nBlackwell and making real-time inference with ultra-long-sequence practical.",

                    "value": "As LLMs scale to multi-million-token KV histories, real-time autoregressive\ndecoding under tight Token-to-Token Latency (TTL) constraints faces growing\npressure. Two core bottlenecks dominate: accessing Feed-Forward Network (FFN)\nweights and reading long KV caches. While Tensor Parallelism (TP) helps\nmitigate the cost of FFN weight reads, it does not scale well for attention.\nWhen TP width exceeds the number of KV heads, it leads to inefficient KV\nduplication, limits parallelism, and constrains batch size. Simultaneously,\nDRAM reads for long KV histories scale linearly with batch size, further\ncapping efficiency.\n  We introduce Helix Parallelism, a hybrid execution strategy that applies KV\nparallelism during attention to shard KV caches across GPUs, then reuses the\nsame GPUs for TP in dense LLMs or TPxExpert Parallel (EP) in MoEs during FFN\ncomputation. To preserve exact attention behavior, Helix includes a lightweight\ncommunication step. To minimize the exposed communication cost, we introduce\nHelix HOP-B. Helix HOP-B effectively minimizes communication overhead through\nbatchwise overlap, preserving low TTL while improving GPU efficiency. Compared\nto conventional parallelism approaches, Helix reduces TTL by up to 1.5x at\nfixed batch sizes and supports up to 32x larger batches under the same latency\nbudget for DeepSeek-R1, pushing forward the throughput-latency Pareto on\nBlackwell and making real-time inference with ultra-long-sequence practical."

In this work,\nrather than following prevalent approaches such as linear attention (or SSMs)\nand local attention, we introduce an intermediate design called \\rat between\nrecurrence and attention mechanisms. It partitions the input into chunks,\napplies a simple linear recurrence within each chunk to capture local\ndependencies, and then performs softmax attention across chunks to model\nlong-range interactions. By adjusting the size of the chunk, \\rat enables\nflexible trade-offs, combining the strengths of RNN and attention. Empirically,\nwith a chunk size of 16, the \\rat layer achieves a \\(7\\times\\) improvement in\ntraining speed with 100K token sequences and \\(9\\times\\) in generation at 4K\nsequence length, while maintaining similar or sometimes even better accuracy\ncompared to standard attention. We demonstrate this by training 1.3B parameter\nmodels from scratch and performing large-scale evaluations, including short-\nand long-context benchmarks, as well as supervised fine-tuning~(SFT). We\nfurther propose a hybrid architecture that interleaves \\rat with local\nattention. By combining efficient long-range modeling with strong local\ninteractions, this hybrid design not only improves inference speed and reduces\ncache memory usage compared to attention, but also consistently enhances\nperformance, for example, achieving an average 1 point gain in commonsense\nreasoning tasks, up to 4 points on code tasks, and a 1 point Rouge-L increase\nin a summarization SFT task.

In this work,\nrather than following prevalent approaches such as linear attention (or SSMs)\nand local attention, we introduce an intermediate design called \\rat between\nrecurrence and attention mechanisms. It partitions the input into chunks,\napplies a simple linear recurrence within each chunk to capture local\ndependencies, and then performs softmax attention across chunks to model\nlong-range interactions. By adjusting the size of the chunk, \\rat enables\nflexible trade-offs, combining the strengths of RNN and attention. Empirically,\nwith a chunk size of 16, the \\rat layer achieves a \\(7\\times\\) improvement in\ntraining speed with 100K token sequences and \\(9\\times\\) in generation at 4K\nsequence length, while maintaining similar or sometimes even better accuracy\ncompared to standard attention. We demonstrate this by training 1.3B parameter\nmodels from scratch and performing large-scale evaluations, including short-\nand long-context benchmarks, as well as supervised fine-tuning~(SFT). We\nfurther propose a hybrid architecture that interleaves \\rat with local\nattention. By combining efficient long-range modeling with strong local\ninteractions, this hybrid design not only improves inference speed and reduces\ncache memory usage compared to attention, but also consistently enhances\nperformance, for example, achieving an average 1 point gain in commonsense\nreasoning tasks, up to 4 points on code tasks, and a 1 point Rouge-L increase\nin a summarization SFT task.

Hunyuan-TurboS features an\nadaptive long-short chain-of-thought (CoT) mechanism, dynamically switching\nbetween rapid responses for simple queries and deep \"thinking\" modes for\ncomplex problems, optimizing computational resources. Architecturally, this 56B\nactivated (560B total) parameter model employs 128 layers (Mamba2, Attention,\nFFN) with an innovative AMF/MF block pattern. Faster Mamba2 ensures linear\ncomplexity, Grouped-Query Attention minimizes KV cache, and FFNs use an MoE\nstructure. Pre-trained on 16T high-quality tokens, it supports a 256K context\nlength and is the first industry-deployed large-scale Mamba model. Our\ncomprehensive post-training strategy enhances capabilities via Supervised\nFine-Tuning (3M instructions), a novel Adaptive Long-short CoT Fusion method,\nMulti-round Deliberation Learning for iterative improvement, and a two-stage\nLarge-scale Reinforcement Learning process targeting STEM and general\ninstruction-following. Evaluations show strong performance: overall top 7 rank\non LMSYS Chatbot Arena with a score of 1356, outperforming leading models like\nGemini-2.0-Flash-001 (1352) and o4-mini-2025-04-16 (1345). TurboS also achieves\nan average of 77.9% across 23 automated benchmarks. Hunyuan-TurboS balances\nhigh performance and efficiency, offering substantial capabilities at lower\ninference costs than many reasoning models, establishing a new paradigm for\nefficient large-scale pre-trained models.",

Our\nevaluations show that HybridTier outperforms prior systems by up to $91\\%$\n($19\\%$ geomean), incurring $2.0-7.8\\times$ less memory overhead and\n$1.7-3.5\\times$ less cache misses."

We show that the use of ML cause leakage of past\nqueries in a database, enable a poisoning attack that causes exponential memory\nblowup in an index structure and crashes it in seconds, and enable index users\nto snoop on each others' key distributions by timing queries over their own\nkeys. We find that adversarial ML is an universal threat against learned\ncomponents in database systems, point to open research gaps in our\nunderstanding of learned-systems security, and conclude by discussing\nmitigations, while noting that data leakage is inherent in systems whose\nlearned component is shared between multiple parties."

As\nthe size of graph data continues to scale up, SpGEMMs are often conducted in an\nout-of-core fashion due to limited GPU memory space in resource-constrained\nsystems. Albeit recent efforts that aim to alleviate the memory constraints of\nout-of-core SpGEMM through either GPU feature caching, hybrid CPU-GPU memory\nlayout, or performing the computation in sparse format, current systems suffer\nfrom both high I/O latency and GPU under-utilization issues.\n  In this paper, we first identify the problems of existing systems, where\nsparse format data alignment and memory allocation are the main performance\nbottlenecks, and propose AIRES, a novel algorithm-system co-design solution to\naccelerate out-of-core SpGEMM computation for GCNs.

Numerical experiments show that our method outperforms traditional\nmodel-based approaches and it is comparable to the performance of Bregman\nPlug-and-Play methods, while mitigating their typical drawbacks - namely,\nsensitivity to initialization and careful tuning of hyperparameters.

Notably,\nthe reason behind this phenomenon remains unknown. In this paper, we find that\nthese transformations show substantial improvement in eliminating outliers for\ncommon tokens and achieve similar quantization error. The primary reason for\nthe accuracy difference lies in the fact that randomized Hadamard transforms\ncan slightly reduce the quantization error for tokens with massive activations\nwhile randomized orthogonal transforms increase the quantization error. Due to\nthe extreme rarity of these tokens and their critical impact on model accuracy,\nwe consider this a long-tail optimization problem, and therefore construct a\nsimple yet effective method: a weighted loss function. Additionally, we propose\nan optimization strategy for the rotation matrix that involves alternating\noptimization of quantization parameters while employing orthogonal Procrustes\ntransforms to refine the rotation matrix. This makes the distribution of the\nrotated activation values more conducive to quantization, especially for tokens\nwith massive activations. Our method enhances the Rotated LLMs by achieving\ndual free, Outlier-Free and Massive Activation-Free, dubbed as DFRot. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of DFRot.

While popular methods like integer programming yield logistics\nplans that satisfy user-defined logical constraints, they are slow and assume\nan idealized mathematical model of the environment that does not account for\nuncertainty. On the other hand, large language models (LLMs) can handle\nuncertainty and promise to accelerate replanning while lowering the barrier to\nentry by translating free-form utterances into executable plans, yet they\nremain prone to misinterpretations and hallucinations that jeopardize safety\nand cost. We introduce a neurosymbolic framework that pairs the accessibility\nof natural-language dialogue with verifiable guarantees on goal interpretation.\nIt converts user requests into structured planning specifications, quantifies\nits own uncertainty at the field and token level, and invokes an interactive\nclarification loop whenever confidence falls below an adaptive threshold. A\nlightweight model, fine-tuned on just 100 uncertainty-filtered examples,\nsurpasses the zero-shot performance of GPT-4.1 while cutting inference latency\nby nearly 50%.

While popular methods like integer programming yield logistics\nplans that satisfy user-defined logical constraints, they are slow and assume\nan idealized mathematical model of the environment that does not account for\nuncertainty. On the other hand, large language models (LLMs) can handle\nuncertainty and promise to accelerate replanning while lowering the barrier to\nentry by translating free-form utterances into executable plans, yet they\nremain prone to misinterpretations and hallucinations that jeopardize safety\nand cost. We introduce a neurosymbolic framework that pairs the accessibility\nof natural-language dialogue with verifiable guarantees on goal interpretation.\nIt converts user requests into structured planning specifications, quantifies\nits own uncertainty at the field and token level, and invokes an interactive\nclarification loop whenever confidence falls below an adaptive threshold. A\nlightweight model, fine-tuned on just 100 uncertainty-filtered examples,\nsurpasses the zero-shot performance of GPT-4.1 while cutting inference latency\nby nearly 50%. These preliminary results highlight a practical path toward\ncertifiable, real-time, and user-aligned decision-making for complex logistics."

In particular, given a population of cells sampled from\nsuch a process, we are interested in the problem of ordering the cells\naccording to their progression in the process. This is known as trajectory\ninference. If the process is differentiation, this amounts to reconstructing\nthe corresponding differentiation tree. One way of doing this in practice is to\nestimate the shortest-path distance between nodes based on cell similarities\nobserved in sequencing data. Recent sequencing techniques make it possible to\nmeasure two types of data: gene expression levels, and RNA velocity, a vector\nthat predicts changes in gene expression. The data then consist of a discrete\nvector field on a (subset of a) Euclidean space of dimension equal to the\nnumber of genes under consideration.

                    "value": "In this paper, we consider a tree inference problem motivated by the critical\nproblem in single-cell genomics of reconstructing dynamic cellular processes\nfrom sequencing data. In particular, given a population of cells sampled from\nsuch a process, we are interested in the problem of ordering the cells\naccording to their progression in the process. This is known as trajectory\ninference. If the process is differentiation, this amounts to reconstructing\nthe corresponding differentiation tree. One way of doing this in practice is to\nestimate the shortest-path distance between nodes based on cell similarities\nobserved in sequencing data. Recent sequencing techniques make it possible to\nmeasure two types of data: gene expression levels, and RNA velocity, a vector\nthat predicts changes in gene expression. The data then consist of a discrete\nvector field on a (subset of a) Euclidean space of dimension equal to the\nnumber of genes under consideration. By integrating this velocity field, we\ntrace the evolution of gene expression levels in each single cell from some\ninitial stage to its current stage. Eventually, we assume that we have a\nfaithful embedding of the differentiation tree in a Euclidean space, but which\nwe only observe through the curves representing the paths from the root to the\nnodes. Using varifold distances between such curves, we define a similarity\nmeasure between nodes which we prove approximates the shortest-path distance in\na tree that is isomorphic to the target tree."

We propose an intermediate Intention Capture layer between user\nqueries and Workflow Generation, implementing the Opus Workflow Intention\nFramework, which consists of extracting Workflow Signals from user queries,\ninterpreting them into structured Workflow Intention objects, and generating\nWorkflows based on these Intentions.

Our findings indicate that even a small\nhigh-mass, spin-precessing subpopulation -- comprising as little as 5\\% of the\npopulation generating the events observed by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration\nso far -- can result in an unreliable measurement of the Hubble-Lema\\^itre\nconstant in the upcoming observing runs of these detectors, with even more\npronounced effects expected in future facilities on the ground."

Despite the overall\nsuperiority of the Decoder architecture, the gradually increasing Key-Value\n(KV) cache during inference has emerged as a primary efficiency bottleneck,\nboth in aspects of memory consumption and data transfer bandwidth limitations.\nTo address these challenges, we propose a paradigm called KV-Latent. By\ndown-sampling the Key-Value vector dimensions into a latent space, we can\nsignificantly reduce the KV Cache footprint and improve inference speed, only\nwith a small amount of extra training, less than 1\\% of pre-training takes.\nBesides, we enhanced the stability of Rotary Positional Embedding applied on\nlower-dimensional vectors by modifying its frequency sampling mechanism,\navoiding noise introduced by higher frequencies while retaining position\nattenuation.

Despite the overall\nsuperiority of the Decoder architecture, the gradually increasing Key-Value\n(KV) cache during inference has emerged as a primary efficiency bottleneck,\nboth in aspects of memory consumption and data transfer bandwidth limitations.\nTo address these challenges, we propose a paradigm called KV-Latent. By\ndown-sampling the Key-Value vector dimensions into a latent space, we can\nsignificantly reduce the KV Cache footprint and improve inference speed, only\nwith a small amount of extra training, less than 1\\% of pre-training takes.\nBesides, we enhanced the stability of Rotary Positional Embedding applied on\nlower-dimensional vectors by modifying its frequency sampling mechanism,\navoiding noise introduced by higher frequencies while retaining position\nattenuation.

Critique-GRPO enables LLMs to learn from initial responses and\ncritique-guided self-refinements simultaneously while maintaining exploration.\nAdditionally, we employ a shaping function to amplify learning from correct,\nespecially unfamiliar, refinements and penalize incorrect ones. Extensive\nexperiments with Qwen2.5-7B-Base, Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Base, and Qwen3-8B\ndemonstrate that Critique-GRPO consistently outperforms supervised learning and\nRL-based fine-tuning methods across eight challenging mathematical, STEM, and\ngeneral reasoning tasks, improving average pass@1 scores by approximately 4.4%\nand 3.8% on Qwen2.5-7B-Base and Qwen3-8B, respectively. Notably, Critique-GRPO\nenables effective self-improvement through self-critiquing and weak-to-strong\ngeneralization, achieving consistent gains over GRPO, such as 16.7% and 10.0%\npass@1 improvements on AIME 2024, respectively."

Recent KG reasoning methods that integrate both global and\nlocal information have achieved promising results.

To address\nthis, we propose DuetGraph, a coarse-to-fine KG reasoning mechanism with\ndual-pathway global-local fusion. DuetGraph tackles over-smoothing by\nsegregating -- rather than stacking -- the processing of local (via message\npassing) and global (via attention) information into two distinct pathways,\npreventing mutual interference and preserving representational discrimination.\nIn addition, DuetGraph introduces a coarse-to-fine optimization, which\npartitions entities into high- and low-score subsets. This strategy narrows the\ncandidate space and sharpens the score gap between the two subsets, which\nalleviates over-smoothing and enhances inference quality. Extensive experiments\non various datasets demonstrate that DuetGraph achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA)\nperformance, with up to an 8.7% improvement in reasoning quality and a\n1.8$\\times$ acceleration in training efficiency.",

The simulations achieve a quasi-steady\nstate on a Myr timescale, at which point a quasi-Keplerian, cool\n($T\\sim10^3-10^4~\\rm K$) gas disk extending several parsecs is established.\nThis disk is continuously supplied by the stellar winds and itself feeds the\ncentral SMBH. At the end of the simulations at 2 Myr, an accretion rate of\n$\\sim2\\times10^{-5}\\rm~M_\\odot~yr^{-1}$ is found but could vary by a factor of\nfew depending on whether the subdominant gravity of the NSC or a moderate\nglobal inflow is included.

However, existing unified\nmodels exhibit limitations in image synthesis quality, autoregressive error\naccumulation, and image editing capability. In this work, we propose Nexus-Gen,\na novel architecture that unifies image understanding, generation, and editing\ntasks in a shared image embedding space. This shared space serves as a bridge\nfor the autoregressive and diffusion models, which seamlessly integrates their\ncomplementary strengths in cross-modal modeling. To mitigate the severe error\naccumulation during autoregressive embedding prediction, we propose a novel\nprefilled autoregression strategy that aligns training-inference dynamics by\nprefilling input sequences with learnable embeddings. After multi-stage and\nmulti-task training on our constructed large-scale dataset with 26.3 million\nsamples, Nexus-Gen achieves state-of-the-art performance on the evaluation\nbenchmarks spanning image understanding, generation and editing tasks.

                    "value": "Unified multimodal generative models aim to integrate image understanding and\ngeneration abilities, offering significant advantages in harnessing multimodal\ncorpora, particularly interleaved text-image data. However, existing unified\nmodels exhibit limitations in image synthesis quality, autoregressive error\naccumulation, and image editing capability. In this work, we propose Nexus-Gen,\na novel architecture that unifies image understanding, generation, and editing\ntasks in a shared image embedding space. This shared space serves as a bridge\nfor the autoregressive and diffusion models, which seamlessly integrates their\ncomplementary strengths in cross-modal modeling. To mitigate the severe error\naccumulation during autoregressive embedding prediction, we propose a novel\nprefilled autoregression strategy that aligns training-inference dynamics by\nprefilling input sequences with learnable embeddings. After multi-stage and\nmulti-task training on our constructed large-scale dataset with 26.3 million\nsamples, Nexus-Gen achieves state-of-the-art performance on the evaluation\nbenchmarks spanning image understanding, generation and editing tasks.

While some\nartificial intelligence models have been developed, they often operate as black\nboxes, lacking the interpretability needed for clinical trust. Moreover, these\nmodels typically evaluate nodes in isolation, overlooking the patient-level\ncontext. To address these limitations, we introduce LRMR, an LLM-Driven\nRelational Multi-node Ranking framework. This approach reframes the diagnostic\ntask from a direct classification problem into a structured reasoning and\nranking process. The LRMR framework operates in two stages. First, a multimodal\nlarge language model (LLM) analyzes a composite montage image of all LNs from a\npatient, generating a structured report that details ten distinct radiological\nfeatures. Second, a text-based LLM performs pairwise comparisons of these\nreports between different patients, establishing a relative risk ranking based\non the severity and number of adverse features. We evaluated our method on a\nretrospective cohort of 117 rectal cancer patients. LRMR achieved an area under\nthe curve (AUC) of 0.7917 and an F1-score of 0.7200, outperforming a range of\ndeep learning baselines, including ResNet50 (AUC 0.7708). Ablation studies\nconfirmed the value of our two main contributions: removing the relational\nranking stage or the structured prompting stage led to a significant\nperformance drop, with AUCs falling to 0.6875 and 0.6458, respectively. Our\nwork demonstrates that decoupling visual perception from cognitive reasoning\nthrough a two-stage LLM framework offers a powerful, interpretable, and\neffective new paradigm for assessing lymph node metastasis in rectal cancer.",

Embodied intelligence\nfocuses on agents capable of perceiving, reasoning, and acting within the\nphysical world. Achieving robust embodied intelligence requires not only\nadvanced perception and control, but also the ability to ground abstract\ncognition in real-world interactions. Two foundational technologies, physical\nsimulators and world models, have emerged as critical enablers in this quest.\nPhysical simulators provide controlled, high-fidelity environments for training\nand evaluating robotic agents, allowing safe and efficient development of\ncomplex behaviors. In contrast, world models empower robots with internal\nrepresentations of their surroundings, enabling predictive planning and\nadaptive decision-making beyond direct sensory input. This survey\nsystematically reviews recent advances in learning embodied AI through the\nintegration of physical simulators and world models. We analyze their\ncomplementary roles in enhancing autonomy, adaptability, and generalization in\nintelligent robots, and discuss the interplay between external simulation and\ninternal modeling in bridging the gap between simulated training and real-world\ndeployment.

Notably,\nthe reason behind this phenomenon remains unknown. In this paper, we find that\nthese transformations show substantial improvement in eliminating outliers for\ncommon tokens and achieve similar quantization error. The primary reason for\nthe accuracy difference lies in the fact that randomized Hadamard transforms\ncan slightly reduce the quantization error for tokens with massive activations\nwhile randomized orthogonal transforms increase the quantization error.

Our method enhances the Rotated LLMs by achieving\ndual free, Outlier-Free and Massive Activation-Free, dubbed as DFRot. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of DFRot.

Building on this\napproach, we further distinguish two critical types of quantized layers: those\nresponsible for retaining essential temporal information and those particularly\nsensitive to bit-width reduction. By selectively finetuning these layers under\nboth local and global supervision, we mitigate performance degradation while\nenhancing quantization efficiency. Our method demonstrates its efficacy across\nthree high-resolution image generation tasks, obtaining state-of-the-art\nperformance across multiple bit-width settings."

These findings underscore the need for a\ncoordinated European policy strategy that goes beyond national planning to\nsupport cross-border infrastructure investment, scale up flexible technologies\nsuch as long-duration storage, and promote a geographically balanced deployment\nof renewables to mitigate systemic risks associated with Dunkelflaute events."

However, traditional approaches typically treat\nthis task as a static classification problem, relying on handcrafted features\nor isolated deep learning models. These methods often lack the robustness\nneeded to handle incomplete, heterogeneous, or noisy intelligence, and they\nprovide limited transparency in decision-making-factors that reduce their\neffectiveness in real-world threat environments. To address these limitations,\nwe propose LRCTI, a Large Language Model (LLM)-based framework designed for\nmulti-step CTI credibility verification. The framework first employs a text\nsummarization module to distill complex intelligence reports into concise and\nactionable threat claims. It then uses an adaptive multi-step evidence\nretrieval mechanism that iteratively identifies and refines supporting\ninformation from a CTI-specific corpus, guided by LLM feedback. Finally, a\nprompt-based Natural Language Inference (NLI) module is applied to evaluate the\ncredibility of each claim while generating interpretable justifications for the\nclassification outcome. Experiments conducted on two benchmark datasets,\nCTI-200 and PolitiFact show that LRCTI improves F1-Macro and F1-Micro scores by\nover 5%, reaching 90.9% and 93.6%, respectively, compared to state-of-the-art\nbaselines. These results demonstrate that LRCTI effectively addresses the core\nlimitations of prior methods, offering a scalable, accurate, and explainable\nsolution for automated CTI credibility verification",

It then uses an adaptive multi-step evidence\nretrieval mechanism that iteratively identifies and refines supporting\ninformation from a CTI-specific corpus, guided by LLM feedback. Finally, a\nprompt-based Natural Language Inference (NLI) module is applied to evaluate the\ncredibility of each claim while generating interpretable justifications for the\nclassification outcome. Experiments conducted on two benchmark datasets,\nCTI-200 and PolitiFact show that LRCTI improves F1-Macro and F1-Micro scores by\nover 5%, reaching 90.9% and 93.6%, respectively, compared to state-of-the-art\nbaselines. These results demonstrate that LRCTI effectively addresses the core\nlimitations of prior methods, offering a scalable, accurate, and explainable\nsolution for automated CTI credibility verification"

While deep\nlearning-based approaches have made notable strides in EEG emotion recognition,\nparticularly in feature extraction and pattern recognition, significant\nchallenges persist in achieving end-to-end emotion computation, including\nreal-time processing, individual adaptation, and seamless user interaction.\nThis paper presents the EEG Emotion Copilot, a system optimizing a lightweight\nlarge language model (LLM) with 0.5B parameters operating in a local setting,\nwhich first recognizes emotional states directly from EEG signals, subsequently\ngenerates personalized diagnostic and treatment suggestions, and finally\nsupports the automation of assisted electronic medical records. Specifically,\nwe demonstrate the critical techniques in the novel data structure of prompt,\nmodel pruning and fine-tuning training, and deployment strategies aiming at\nimproving real-time performance and computational efficiency. Extensive\nexperiments show that our optimized lightweight LLM-based copilot achieves an\nenhanced intuitive interface for participant interaction, superior accuracy of\nemotion recognition and assisted electronic medical records generation, in\ncomparison to such models with similar scale parameters or large-scale\nparameters such as 1.5B, 1.8B, 3B and 7B.

ContextCache employs a two-stage retrieval\narchitecture that first executes vector-based retrieval on the current query to\nidentify potential matches and then integrates current and historical dialogue\nrepresentations through self-attention mechanisms for precise contextual\nmatching. Evaluation of real-world conversations shows that ContextCache\nimproves precision and recall compared to existing methods. Additionally,\ncached responses exhibit approximately 10 times lower latency than direct LLM\ninvocation, enabling significant computational cost reductions for LLM\nconversational applications.",

Despite this success, we identify\nthree key challenges encountered by RL with solely numerical feedback:\nperformance plateaus, limited effectiveness of self-reflection, and persistent\nfailures. We then demonstrate that RL-finetuned models, even after exhibiting\nperformance plateaus, can generate correct refinements on persistently failed\nproblems by leveraging natural language feedback in the form of critiques.\nBuilding on this insight, we propose Critique-GRPO, an online RL framework that\nintegrates both natural language and numerical feedback for effective policy\noptimization. Critique-GRPO enables LLMs to learn from initial responses and\ncritique-guided self-refinements simultaneously while maintaining exploration.\nAdditionally, we employ a shaping function to amplify learning from correct,\nespecially unfamiliar, refinements and penalize incorrect ones.

Stylometry has been\nused extensively to characterise the style and attribute authorship of texts.\nBy applying it to LLM-generated texts, we identify their emergent writing\npatterns. The paper involves creating a benchmark dataset based on Wikipedia,\nwith (a) human-written term summaries, (b) texts generated purely by LLMs\n(GPT-3.5/4, LLaMa 2/3, Orca, and Falcon), (c) processed through multiple text\nsummarisation methods (T5, BART, Gensim, and Sumy), and (d) rephrasing methods\n(Dipper, T5). The 10-sentence long texts were classified by tree-based models\n(decision trees and LightGBM) using human-designed (StyloMetrix) and\nn-gram-based (our own pipeline) stylometric features that encode lexical,\ngrammatical, syntactic, and punctuation patterns. The cross-validated results\nreached a performance of up to .87 Matthews correlation coefficient in the\nmulticlass scenario with 7 classes, and accuracy between .79 and 1. in binary\nclassification, with the particular example of Wikipedia and GPT-4 reaching up\nto .98 accuracy on a balanced dataset. Shapley Additive Explanations pinpointed\nfeatures characteristic of the encyclopaedic text type, individual overused\nwords, as well as a greater grammatical standardisation of LLMs with respect to\nhuman-written texts. These results show -- crucially, in the context of the\nincreasingly sophisticated LLMs -- that it is possible to distinguish machine-\nfrom human-generated texts at least for a well-defined text type.",

The 10-sentence long texts were classified by tree-based models\n(decision trees and LightGBM) using human-designed (StyloMetrix) and\nn-gram-based (our own pipeline) stylometric features that encode lexical,\ngrammatical, syntactic, and punctuation patterns. The cross-validated results\nreached a performance of up to .87 Matthews correlation coefficient in the\nmulticlass scenario with 7 classes, and accuracy between .79 and 1. in binary\nclassification, with the particular example of Wikipedia and GPT-4 reaching up\nto .98 accuracy on a balanced dataset. Shapley Additive Explanations pinpointed\nfeatures characteristic of the encyclopaedic text type, individual overused\nwords, as well as a greater grammatical standardisation of LLMs with respect to\nhuman-written texts. These results show -- crucially, in the context of the\nincreasingly sophisticated LLMs -- that it is possible to distinguish machine-\nfrom human-generated texts at least for a well-defined text type."

The applicability of automated SysML diagram generation is\nillustrated with different case studies. The computational models of complex\ndynamical systems from SysML diagrams are then obtained via code generation and\ncomputational model generation steps. In the code generation step, NLP\nstrategies are used for summarization, while LLMs are used for validation only.\nThe proposed approach is not limited to a specific system, domain, or\ncomputational software.

To this end, we present DIJA, the first\nsystematic study and jailbreak attack framework that exploits unique safety\nweaknesses of dLLMs. Specifically, our proposed DIJA constructs adversarial\ninterleaved mask-text prompts that exploit the text generation mechanisms of\ndLLMs, i.e., bidirectional modeling and parallel decoding. Bidirectional\nmodeling drives the model to produce contextually consistent outputs for masked\nspans, even when harmful, while parallel decoding limits model dynamic\nfiltering and rejection sampling of unsafe content. This causes standard\nalignment mechanisms to fail, enabling harmful completions in alignment-tuned\ndLLMs, even when harmful behaviors or unsafe instructions are directly exposed\nin the prompt. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that DIJA\nsignificantly outperforms existing jailbreak methods, exposing a previously\noverlooked threat surface in dLLM architectures. Notably, our method achieves\nup to 100% keyword-based ASR on Dream-Instruct, surpassing the strongest prior\nbaseline, ReNeLLM, by up to 78.5% in evaluator-based ASR on JailbreakBench and\nby 37.7 points in StrongREJECT score, while requiring no rewriting or hiding of\nharmful content in the jailbreak prompt.

This alignment ensures that queries are more\nrelevant, reducing computational costs while improving retrieval effectiveness.\nEmpirical evaluations show that AQE outperforms baseline models for query\nexpansion in both in-domain and out-of-domain settings, demonstrating\nsignificant improvements in retrieval effectiveness."

Existing compensation-based weight calibration methods\noften rely on a second-order Taylor expansion to model quantization error,\nunder the assumption that the first-order term is negligible in well-trained\nfull-precision models. However, we reveal that the progressive compensation\nprocess introduces accumulated first-order deviations between latent weights\nand their full-precision counterparts, making this assumption fundamentally\nflawed. To address this, we propose FOEM, a novel PTQ method that explicitly\nincorporates first-order gradient terms to improve quantization error\ncompensation. FOEM approximates gradients by directly computing the difference\nbetween latent and full-precision weights, avoiding the high cost and limited\ngeneralization of backpropagation-based gradient computation. This approach\nintroduces minimal additional computational overhead. Moreover, FOEM leverages\nprecomputed Cholesky factors to efficiently recover the inverse of Hessian\nsubmatrices in real time. Extensive experiments across a wide range of models\nand benchmarks demonstrate that FOEM consistently outperforms the classical\nGPTQ method. In 3-bit weight-only quantization, FOEM reduces the perplexity of\nLlama3-8B by 89.6%, and improves the 5-shot MMLU accuracy of Llama3-70B from\n51.7% to 74.9%, approaching the full-precision performance of 78.6%.\nFurthermore, FOEM can be seamlessly integrated with advanced techniques such as\nGPTAQ and SpinQuant, yielding additional improvements under the challenging\nW4A4KV4 setting, and further narrowing the accuracy gap with full-precision\nbaselines beyond what current state-of-the-art methods achieve.
