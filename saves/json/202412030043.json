This paper proposes a new coded caching problem,\nreferred to as Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS)-assisted\nmultiple-antenna coded caching, which is composed of a server with multiple\nantennas and some single-antenna cache-aided users. Different from the existing\nmulti-antenna coded caching problems, we introduce a passive RIS (with limited\nnumber of units) into the systems to further increase the multicast gain (i.e.,\ndegrees of freedom (DoF)) in the transmission, which is done by using\nRIS-assisted interference nulling.

Furthermore, we introduce a method called Causal Cache,\nwhich maintains the integrity of latent space during block-wise inference.\nCompared to state-of-the-art video VAEs, WF-VAE demonstrates superior\nperformance in both PSNR and LPIPS metrics, achieving 2x higher throughput and\n4x lower memory consumption while maintaining competitive reconstruction\nquality. Our code and models are available at\nhttps://github.com/PKU-YuanGroup/WF-VAE."

To extend the generation length and facilitate real-world\napplications, a majority of video diffusion models (VDMs) generate videos in an\nautoregressive manner, i.e., generating subsequent clips conditioned on the\nlast frame(s) of the previous clip. However, existing autoregressive VDMs are\nhighly inefficient and redundant: The model must re-compute all the conditional\nframes that are overlapped between adjacent clips. This issue is exacerbated\nwhen the conditional frames are extended autoregressively to provide the model\nwith long-term context. In such cases, the computational demands increase\nsignificantly (i.e., with a quadratic complexity w.r.t. the autoregression\nstep). In this paper, we propose Ca2-VDM, an efficient autoregressive VDM with\nCausal generation and Cache sharing. For causal generation, it introduces\nunidirectional feature computation, which ensures that the cache of conditional\nframes can be precomputed in previous autoregression steps and reused in every\nsubsequent step, eliminating redundant computations. For cache sharing, it\nshares the cache across all denoising steps to avoid the huge cache storage\ncost.

We\npresent Deegen, a meta-compiler that allows users to generate a\nhigh-performance JIT-capable VM for their own language at an engineering cost\nsimilar to writing a simple interpreter. Deegen takes in the execution\nsemantics of the bytecodes implemented as C++ functions, and automatically\ngenerates a two-tier VM execution engine with a state-of-the-art interpreter, a\nstate-of-the-art baseline JIT, and the tier-switching logic that connects them\ninto a self-adaptive system.\n  We are the first to demonstrate the automatic generation of a JIT compiler,\nand the automatic generation of an interpreter that outperforms the state of\nthe art. Our performance comes from a long list of optimizations supported by\nDeegen, including bytecode specialization and quickening, register pinning, tag\nregister optimization, call inline caching, generic inline caching, JIT\npolymorphic IC, JIT IC inline slab, type-check removal and strength reduction,\ntype-based slow-path extraction and outlining, JIT hot-cold code splitting, and\nJIT OSR-entry. These optimizations are either employed automatically, or guided\nby the language implementer through intuitive APIs. As a result, the\ndisassembly of the Deegen-generated interpreter, baseline JIT, and the\ngenerated JIT code rivals the assembly code hand-written by experts in\nstate-of-the-art VMs.\n  We implement LuaJIT Remake (LJR), a standard-compliant Lua 5.1 VM, using\nDeegen. Across 44 benchmarks, LJR's interpreter is on average 179% faster than\nthe official PUC Lua interpreter, and 31% faster than LuaJIT's interpreter.\nLJR's baseline JIT has negligible startup delay, and its execution performance\nis on average 360% faster than PUC Lua and only 33% slower (but faster on 13/44\nbenchmarks) than LuaJIT's optimizing JIT.",

However, for many of\nthese applications, much of the context in the prompt is fixed across different\nuser inputs, thereby providing the opportunity to perform offline optimizations\nto process user inputs quickly, as they are received. In this work, we propose\nSqueezed Attention as a mechanism to accelerate LLM applications where a large\nportion of the input prompt is fixed. We first leverage K-means clustering\noffline to group the keys for the fixed context based on semantic similarity\nand represent each cluster with a single centroid value. During inference, we\ncompare query tokens from the user input with the centroids to predict which of\nthe keys from the fixed context are semantically relevant and need to be loaded\nduring inference. We then compute exact attention using only these important\nkeys from the fixed context, thereby reducing bandwidth and computational\ncosts. We also extend our method to use a hierarchical centroid lookup to\nidentify important keys, which can reduce the complexity of attention from\nlinear to logarithmic with respect to the context length. We implement\noptimized Triton kernels for centroid comparison and sparse FlashAttention with\nimportant keys, achieving more than 4x speedups during both the prefill and\ngeneration phases for long-context inference. Furthermore, we have extensively\nevaluated our method on various long-context benchmarks including LongBench,\nwhere it achieves a 3x reduction in KV cache budget without accuracy loss and\nup to an 8x reduction with <0.5 point accuracy gap for various models.",

This requires\ndownsampling to meet GPU constraints, sacrificing the fine-grained details\nneeded for high-precision interactive segmentation. To address SAM's\nlimitations, we focus on visual length extrapolation and propose a lightweight\nmodel named HRSAM. The extrapolation enables HRSAM trained on low resolutions\nto generalize to high resolutions. We begin by finding the link between the\nextrapolation and attention scores, which leads us to base HRSAM on Swin\nattention. We then introduce the Flexible Local Attention (FLA) framework,\nusing CUDA-optimized Efficient Memory Attention to accelerate HRSAM. Within\nFLA, we implement Flash Swin attention, achieving over a 35% speedup compared\nto traditional Swin attention, and propose a KV-only padding mechanism to\nenhance extrapolation. We also develop the Cycle-scan module that uses State\nSpace models to efficiently expand HRSAM's receptive field. We further develop\nthe HRSAM++ within FLA by adding an anchor map, providing multi-scale data\naugmentation for the extrapolation and a larger receptive field at slight\ncomputational cost. Experiments show that, under standard training, HRSAMs\nsurpass the previous SOTA with only 38% of the latency. With SAM-distillation,\nthe extrapolation enables HRSAMs to outperform the teacher model at lower\nlatency. Further finetuning achieves performance significantly exceeding the\nprevious SOTA.",

However,\nprevious works focus on extracting features either from the time domain or the\nfrequency domain, which inadequately captures the trends and periodic\ncharacteristics. To address this issue, we propose a wavelet learning framework\nto model complex temporal dependencies of the time series data. The wavelet\ndomain integrates both time and frequency information, allowing for the\nanalysis of local characteristics of signals at different scales. Additionally,\nthe Softmax self-attention mechanism used by Transformers has quadratic\ncomplexity, which leads to excessive computational costs when capturing\nlong-term dependencies. Therefore, we propose a novel attention mechanism:\nRotary Route Attention (RoRA). Unlike Softmax attention, RoRA utilizes rotary\nposition embeddings to inject relative positional information to sequence\ntokens and introduces a small number of routing tokens $r$ to aggregate\ninformation from the $KV$ matrices and redistribute it to the $Q$ matrix,\noffering linear complexity. We further propose WaveRoRA, which leverages RoRA\nto capture inter-series dependencies in the wavelet domain. We conduct\nextensive experiments on eight real-world datasets. The results indicate that\nWaveRoRA outperforms existing state-of-the-art models while maintaining lower\ncomputational costs. Our code is available at\nhttps://github.com/Leopold2333/WaveRoRA.",

However,\nprevious works focus on extracting features either from the time domain or the\nfrequency domain, which inadequately captures the trends and periodic\ncharacteristics. To address this issue, we propose a wavelet learning framework\nto model complex temporal dependencies of the time series data. The wavelet\ndomain integrates both time and frequency information, allowing for the\nanalysis of local characteristics of signals at different scales.

For\nthis purpose, a DNBI was installed and operated in the RFX-mod experiment,\nwhich was designed to confine plasma mainly through the Reversed Field Pinch\nconfiguration. The DNBI, designed and built by the Budker Institute of Plasma\nPhysics, was based on a source of positive hydrogen ions, accelerated to 50 keV\nand for an equivalent neutral beam current of about 5 A at the source. The beam\ncould be modulated and the maximum overall duration was 50 ms. With the upgrade\nof RFX-mod to the present RFX-mod2 machine, the DNBI is being renovated to\nsolve several plant faults and improve the overall reliability of the system.\nThe 50 kV power supply is being improved, as well as the power supplies in the\nhigh voltage deck and its insulation transformer. The control system,\noriginally based on CAMAC technology, was redesigned to be fully replaced. This\ncontribution reviews the technical criticalities emerged in the DNBI check-up\nand the new solutions adopted to make the DNBI operative and more reliable.",

For\nthis purpose, a DNBI was installed and operated in the RFX-mod experiment,\nwhich was designed to confine plasma mainly through the Reversed Field Pinch\nconfiguration. The DNBI, designed and built by the Budker Institute of Plasma\nPhysics, was based on a source of positive hydrogen ions, accelerated to 50 keV\nand for an equivalent neutral beam current of about 5 A at the source. The beam\ncould be modulated and the maximum overall duration was 50 ms. With the upgrade\nof RFX-mod to the present RFX-mod2 machine, the DNBI is being renovated to\nsolve several plant faults and improve the overall reliability of the system.\nThe 50 kV power supply is being improved, as well as the power supplies in the\nhigh voltage deck and its insulation transformer. The control system,\noriginally based on CAMAC technology, was redesigned to be fully replaced. This\ncontribution reviews the technical criticalities emerged in the DNBI check-up\nand the new solutions adopted to make the DNBI operative and more reliable."

For the AFM operation, we leverage unique universal\ncharacteristics (UCs) of a data-object and a cluster's mean set, which are\nskewed distributions on data relationships such as Zipf's law and a\nfeature-value concentration phenomenon. The UCs indicate that the most part of\nthe number of multiplications for similarity calculations is executed regarding\nterms with high document frequencies (df) and the most part of a similarity\nbetween an object- and a mean-feature vector is obtained by the multiplications\nregarding a few high mean-feature values. Our proposed algorithm applies an\ninverted-index data structure to a mean set, extracts the specific region with\nhigh-df terms and high mean-feature values in the mean-inverted index by newly\nintroduced two structural parameters, and exploits the index divided into three\nparts for efficient pruning. The algorithm determines the two structural\nparameters by minimizing the approximate number of multiplications related to\nthat of instructions, reduces the branch mispredictions by sharing the index\nstructure including the two parameters with all the objects, and suppressing\nthe cache misses by keeping in the caches the frequently used data in the\nforegoing specific region, resulting in working in the AFM.

Through extensive microbenchmark and\nsystem-level comparisons, we demonstrate that XDP-Rocks achieves 3x to 4x\nperformance improvements over RocksDB across various workloads. XDP-Rocks is\nalready deployed in production, delivering significant operator cost savings\nconsistent with these performance gains."

It reduces the percentage error from 198% and 19.7% to 3.8% in\npredicting the latency of GPT3 model for training and inference on H100,\ncompared to state-of-the-art prior works, where both GPT3 and H100 were not\nused to train the framework."

                "summary": "Flow diffusion models (FDMs) have recently shown potential in generation\ntasks due to the high generation quality. However, the current ordinary\ndifferential equation (ODE) solver for FDMs, e.g., the Euler solver, still\nsuffers from slow generation since ODE solvers need many number function\nevaluations (NFE) to keep high-quality generation. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel training-free flow-solver to reduce NFE while maintaining high-quality\ngeneration. The key insight for the flow-solver is to leverage the previous\nsteps to reduce the NFE, where a cache is created to reuse these results from\nthe previous steps. Specifically, the Taylor expansion is first used to\napproximate the ODE. To calculate the high-order derivatives of Taylor\nexpansion, the flow-solver proposes to use the previous steps and a polynomial\ninterpolation to approximate it, where the number of orders we could\napproximate equals the number of previous steps we cached. We also prove that\nthe flow-solver has a more minor approximation error and faster generation\nspeed. Experimental results on the CIFAR-10, CelebA-HQ, LSUN-Bedroom,\nLSUN-Church, ImageNet, and real text-to-image generation prove the efficiency\nof the flow-solver.

Current methods\ntypically require extensive training samples from meta-learning to build memory\nand perform intensive fine-tuning of GNN parameters, leading to high memory\nconsumption and potential loss of previously learned knowledge. To tackle these\nchallenges, we introduce Mecoin, an efficient method for building and\nmaintaining memory. Mecoin employs Structured Memory Units to cache prototypes\nof learned categories, as well as Memory Construction Modules to update these\nprototypes for new categories through interactions between the nodes and the\ncached prototypes. Additionally, we have designed a Memory Representation\nAdaptation Module to store probabilities associated with each class prototype,\nreducing the need for parameter fine-tuning and lowering the forgetting rate.\nWhen a sample matches its corresponding class prototype, the relevant\nprobabilities are retrieved from the MRaM. Knowledge is then distilled back\ninto the GNN through a Graph Knowledge Distillation Module, preserving the\nmodel's memory. We analyze the effectiveness of Mecoin in terms of\ngeneralization error and explore the impact of different distillation\nstrategies on model performance through experiments and VC-dimension analysis.\nCompared to other related works, Mecoin shows superior performance in accuracy\nand forgetting rate.

Current MoE models\nare mainly built with expert parallelism on distributed devices. However, it\nusually depends on homogeneous devices to deploy and suffers from heavy\ncommunication overhead and computation redundancy. In this paper, we explore\ndeveloping a \\texttt{H}eterogeneous-aware \\texttt{EX}pert \\texttt{A}llocation\nframework, \\textbf{\\texttt{HEXA-MoE}}, with significantly enhanced computing\nefficiency. It contains two components: ($1$) \\textit{Expert-Specific\nOperators}. We replace the typical general matrix multiplication or grouped\nmatrix multiplication interfaces with our operators, which allows the computing\nto be performed in an in-place manner with \\textbf{ZERO} redundancy.

Current MoE models\nare mainly built with expert parallelism on distributed devices. However, it\nusually depends on homogeneous devices to deploy and suffers from heavy\ncommunication overhead and computation redundancy. In this paper, we explore\ndeveloping a \\texttt{H}eterogeneous-aware \\texttt{EX}pert \\texttt{A}llocation\nframework, \\textbf{\\texttt{HEXA-MoE}}, with significantly enhanced computing\nefficiency. It contains two components: ($1$) \\textit{Expert-Specific\nOperators}. We replace the typical general matrix multiplication or grouped\nmatrix multiplication interfaces with our operators, which allows the computing\nto be performed in an in-place manner with \\textbf{ZERO} redundancy.

In this context, low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite\nconstellations offer remarkable potential for efficient cache content broadcast\nin remote regions, thereby extending the reach of digital services. In this\npaper, we introduce a novel approach to optimize wireless edge content\nplacement using NTN. Despite wide coverage, the varying NTN transmission\ncapabilities must be carefully aligned with each content placement to maximize\nbroadcast efficiency. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to optimize\nwireless edge content placement using NTN, positioning NTN as a complement to\nTN for achieving optimal content broadcasting. Specifically, we dynamically\nselect content for placement via NTN links. This selection is based on\npopularity and suitability for delivery through NTN, while considering the\norbital motion of LEO satellites. Our system-level case studies, based on a\npractical LEO constellation, demonstrate the significant improvement in\nplacement speed compared to existing methods, which neglect network mobility.\nWe also demonstrate that NTN links significantly outperform standalone wireless\nTN solutions, particularly in the early stages of content delivery. This\nadvantage is amplified when there is a higher correlation of content popularity\nacross geographical regions.",

                    "value": "Non-terrestrial networks (NTN) have emerged as a transformative solution to\nbridge the digital divide and deliver essential services to remote and\nunderserved areas. In this context, low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite\nconstellations offer remarkable potential for efficient cache content broadcast\nin remote regions, thereby extending the reach of digital services. In this\npaper, we introduce a novel approach to optimize wireless edge content\nplacement using NTN. Despite wide coverage, the varying NTN transmission\ncapabilities must be carefully aligned with each content placement to maximize\nbroadcast efficiency. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to optimize\nwireless edge content placement using NTN, positioning NTN as a complement to\nTN for achieving optimal content broadcasting. Specifically, we dynamically\nselect content for placement via NTN links. This selection is based on\npopularity and suitability for delivery through NTN, while considering the\norbital motion of LEO satellites. Our system-level case studies, based on a\npractical LEO constellation, demonstrate the significant improvement in\nplacement speed compared to existing methods, which neglect network mobility.\nWe also demonstrate that NTN links significantly outperform standalone wireless\nTN solutions, particularly in the early stages of content delivery. This\nadvantage is amplified when there is a higher correlation of content popularity\nacross geographical regions."

Drawing on previous\nsuccessful experiences, researchers have recently explored extending the\nsuccess to the video understanding realms. Apart from training from scratch, an\nefficient way is to utilize the pre-trained image-LLMs, leading to two\nmainstream approaches, i.e. zero-shot inference and further fine-tuning with\nvideo data. In this work, our study of these approaches harvests an effective\ndata augmentation method. We first make a deeper inspection of the zero-shot\ninference way and identify two limitations, i.e. limited generalization and\nlack of temporal understanding capabilities. Thus, we further investigate the\nfine-tuning approach and find a low learning efficiency when simply using all\nthe video data samples, which can be attributed to a lack of instruction\ndiversity. Aiming at this issue, we develop a method called T2Vid to synthesize\nvideo-like samples to enrich the instruction diversity in the training corpus.\nIntegrating these data enables a simple and efficient training scheme, which\nachieves performance comparable to or even superior to using full video\ndatasets by training with just 15% the sample size. Meanwhile, we find that the\nproposed scheme can boost the performance of long video understanding without\ntraining with long video samples. We hope our study will spark more thinking\nabout using MLLMs for video understanding and curation of high-quality data.\nThe code is released at https://github.com/xjtupanda/T2Vid.",

Humans can reason\nnot only from a problem to a solution but also in reverse, i.e., start from the\nsolution and reason towards the problem.

To enable Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform reverse thinking,\nwe introduce Reverse-Enhanced Thinking (RevThink), a framework composed of data\naugmentation and learning objectives. In RevThink, we augment the dataset by\ncollecting structured forward-backward reasoning from a teacher model,\nconsisting of: (1) the original question, (2) forward reasoning, (3) backward\nquestion, and (4) backward reasoning. We then employ three objectives to train\na smaller student model in a multi-task learning fashion: (a) generate forward\nreasoning from a question, (b) generate a backward question from a question,\nand (c) generate backward reasoning from the backward question. Experiments\nacross 12 datasets covering commonsense, math, and logical reasoning show an\naverage 13.53% improvement over the student model's zero-shot performance and a\n6.84% improvement over the strongest knowledge distillation baselines.\nMoreover, our method demonstrates sample efficiency -- using only 10% of the\ncorrect forward reasoning from the training data, it outperforms a standard\nfine-tuning method trained on 10x more forward reasoning.

This heterogeneity is found to\nbe prevalent across different model families, scales, and types. Motivated by\nthis observation, we propose CherryQ, a novel quantization method that unifies\nthe optimization of mixed-precision parameters. CherryQ identifies and\npreserves the critical cherry parameters in high precision while aggressively\nquantizing the remaining parameters to low precision. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of CherryQ. CherryQ outperforms existing\nquantization approaches in terms of perplexity and downstream task performance.\nNotably, our 3-bit quantized Vicuna-1.5 exhibits competitive performance\ncompared to their 16-bit counterparts.",

                "summary": "Text-to-SQL systems (also known as NL-to-SQL systems) have become an\nincreasingly popular solution for bridging the gap between user capabilities\nand SQL-based data access. These systems translate user requests in natural\nlanguage to valid SQL statements for a specific database. Recent Text-to-SQL\nsystems have benefited from the rapid improvement of transformer-based language\nmodels. However, while Text-to-SQL systems that incorporate such models\ncontinuously reach new high scores on -- often synthetic -- benchmark datasets,\na systematic exploration of their robustness towards different data models in a\nreal-world, realistic scenario is notably missing. This paper provides the\nfirst in-depth evaluation of the data model robustness of Text-to-SQL systems\nin practice based on a multi-year international project focused on Text-to-SQL\ninterfaces. Our evaluation is based on a real-world deployment of FootballDB, a\nsystem that was deployed over a 9 month period in the context of the FIFA World\nCup 2022, during which about 6K natural language questions were asked and\nexecuted. All of our data is based on real user questions that were asked live\nto the system. We manually labeled and translated a subset of these questions\nfor three different data models. For each data model, we explore the\nperformance of representative Text-to-SQL systems and language models.

                    "value": "Text-to-SQL systems (also known as NL-to-SQL systems) have become an\nincreasingly popular solution for bridging the gap between user capabilities\nand SQL-based data access. These systems translate user requests in natural\nlanguage to valid SQL statements for a specific database. Recent Text-to-SQL\nsystems have benefited from the rapid improvement of transformer-based language\nmodels. However, while Text-to-SQL systems that incorporate such models\ncontinuously reach new high scores on -- often synthetic -- benchmark datasets,\na systematic exploration of their robustness towards different data models in a\nreal-world, realistic scenario is notably missing. This paper provides the\nfirst in-depth evaluation of the data model robustness of Text-to-SQL systems\nin practice based on a multi-year international project focused on Text-to-SQL\ninterfaces. Our evaluation is based on a real-world deployment of FootballDB, a\nsystem that was deployed over a 9 month period in the context of the FIFA World\nCup 2022, during which about 6K natural language questions were asked and\nexecuted. All of our data is based on real user questions that were asked live\nto the system. We manually labeled and translated a subset of these questions\nfor three different data models. For each data model, we explore the\nperformance of representative Text-to-SQL systems and language models. We\nfurther quantify the impact of training data size, pre-, and post-processing\nsteps as well as language model inference time.

These findings offer crucial guidance for the use\nof synthetic data in evaluating text analysis systems, highlighting both its\npotential and limitations."

Yet their robustness to distribution shifts\non unseen data remains a critical concern for safe deployment. Evaluating such\nrobustness requires a controlled experimental setup that allows for systematic\ninsights into the model's behavior. However, we demonstrate that current setups\nfail to offer sufficiently thorough evaluations, limiting their ability to\naccurately assess model robustness. To address this gap, our work introduces a\nnovel framework, called SURE-VQA, centered around three key requirements to\novercome the current pitfalls and systematically analyze the robustness of\nVLMs: 1) Since robustness on synthetic shifts does not necessarily translate to\nreal-world shifts, robustness should be measured on real-world shifts that are\ninherent to the VQA data; 2) Traditional token-matching metrics often fail to\ncapture underlying semantics, necessitating the use of large language models\n(LLMs) for more accurate semantic evaluation; 3) Model performance often lacks\ninterpretability due to missing sanity baselines, thus meaningful baselines\nshould be reported that allow assessing the multimodal impact on the VLM. To\ndemonstrate the relevance of this framework, we conduct a study on the\nrobustness of various fine-tuning methods across three medical datasets with\nfour different types of distribution shifts. Our study reveals several\nimportant findings: 1) Sanity baselines that do not utilize image data can\nperform surprisingly well; 2) We confirm LoRA as the best-performing PEFT\nmethod; 3) No PEFT method consistently outperforms others in terms of\nrobustness to shifts.

In recent years several\nlarge-scale and high-quality pre-training datasets have been released to\naccelerate the research of LLMs, including ChineseWebText1.0, C4, Pile,\nWanJuan, MAPCC and others. However, as LLMs continue to evolve, focus has\nincreasingly shifted to domain-specific capabilities and safety concerns,\nmaking those previous coarse-grained texts insufficient for meeting training\nrequirements. Furthermore, fine-grained information, such as quality, domain\nand toxicity, is becoming increasingly important in building powerful and\nreliable LLMs for various scenarios. To address these challenges, in this paper\nwe propose a new tool-chain called MDFG-tool for constructing large-scale and\nhigh-quality Chinese datasets with multi-dimensional and fine-grained\ninformation. First, we employ manually crafted rules to discard explicit noisy\ntexts from raw contents. Second, the quality evaluation model, domain\nclassifier, and toxicity evaluation model are well-designed to assess the\nremaining cleaned data respectively. Finally, we integrate these three types of\nfine-grained information for each text. With this approach, we release the\nlargest, high-quality and fine-grained Chinese text ChineseWebText2.0, which\nconsists of 3.8TB and each text is associated with a quality score, domain\nlabels, a toxicity label and a toxicity score, facilitating the LLM researchers\nto select data based on various types of fine-grained information.

To facilitate such growth and provide convenience for developers when\ncreating and updating software, reusing open-source software (i.e., thirdparty\nlibrary reuses) has become one of the most effective and efficient methods.\nUnfortunately, the practice of reusing third-party libraries (TPLs) can also\nintroduce vulnerabilities (known as 1-day vulnerabilities) because of the low\nmaintenance of TPLs, resulting in many vulnerable versions remaining in use. If\nthe software incorporating these TPLs fails to detect the introduced\nvulnerabilities and leads to delayed updates, it will exacerbate the security\nrisks. However, the complicated code dependencies and flexibility of TPL reuses\nmake the detection of 1-day vulnerability a challenging task. To support\ndevelopers in securely reusing TPLs during software development, we design and\nimplement VULTURE, an effective and efficient detection tool, aiming at\nidentifying 1-day vulnerabilities that arise from the reuse of vulnerable TPLs.\nIt first executes a database creation method, TPLFILTER, which leverages the\nLarge Language Model (LLM) to automatically build a unique database for the\ntargeted platform. Instead of relying on code-level similarity comparison,\nVULTURE employs hashing-based comparison to explore the dependencies among the\ncollected TPLs and identify the similarities between the TPLs and the target\nprojects. Recognizing that developers have the flexibility to reuse TPLs\nexactly or in a custom manner, VULTURE separately conducts version-based\ncomparison and chunk-based analysis to capture fine-grained semantic features\nat the function levels.

Although these advancements offer\nsignificant benefits across various applications, they also increase the risk\nof malicious use, particularly in cyberattacks involving personal information.\nIn this work, we investigate the risks associated with misuse of LLM agents in\ncyberattacks involving personal data. Specifically, we aim to understand: 1)\nhow potent LLM agents can be when directed to conduct cyberattacks, 2) how\ncyberattacks are enhanced by web-based tools, and 3) how affordable and easy it\nbecomes to launch cyberattacks using LLM agents. We examine three attack\nscenarios: the collection of Personally Identifiable Information (PII), the\ngeneration of impersonation posts, and the creation of spear-phishing emails.\nOur experiments reveal the effectiveness of LLM agents in these attacks: LLM\nagents achieved a precision of up to 95.9% in collecting PII, up to 93.9% of\nimpersonation posts created by LLM agents were evaluated as authentic, and the\nclick rate for links in spear phishing emails created by LLM agents reached up\nto 46.67%. Additionally, our findings underscore the limitations of existing\nsafeguards in contemporary commercial LLMs, emphasizing the urgent need for\nmore robust security measures to prevent the misuse of LLM agents."

Among\nsuch tasks, this paper focuses on speech-to-text translation (ST). By examining\nthe published papers on the topic, we propose a unified view of the\narchitectural solutions and training strategies presented so far, highlighting\nsimilarities and differences among them. Based on this examination, we not only\norganize the lessons learned but also show how diverse settings and evaluation\napproaches hinder the identification of the best-performing solution for each\narchitectural building block and training choice.

This\nparadigm has extended to other modalities, including speech, where researchers\nare actively exploring the combination of Speech Foundation Models (SFMs) and\nLLMs into single, unified models capable of addressing multimodal tasks. Among\nsuch tasks, this paper focuses on speech-to-text translation (ST). By examining\nthe published papers on the topic, we propose a unified view of the\narchitectural solutions and training strategies presented so far, highlighting\nsimilarities and differences among them. Based on this examination, we not only\norganize the lessons learned but also show how diverse settings and evaluation\napproaches hinder the identification of the best-performing solution for each\narchitectural building block and training choice. Lastly, we outline\nrecommendations for future works on the topic aimed at better understanding the\nstrengths and weaknesses of the SFM+LLM solutions for ST."

This article assesses which\nChatGPT inputs (full text without tables, figures and references; title and\nabstract; title only) produce better quality score estimates, and the extent to\nwhich scores are affected by ChatGPT models and system prompts. The results\nshow that the optimal input is the article title and abstract, with average\nChatGPT scores based on these (30 iterations on a dataset of 51 papers)\ncorrelating at 0.67 with human scores, the highest ever reported. ChatGPT 4o is\nslightly better than 3.5-turbo (0.66), and 4o-mini (0.66). The results suggest\nthat article full texts might confuse LLM research quality evaluations, even\nthough complex system instructions for the task are more effective than simple\nones. Thus, whilst abstracts contain insufficient information for a thorough\nassessment of rigour, they may contain strong pointers about originality and\nsignificance. Finally, linear regression can be used to convert the model\nscores into the human scale scores, which is 31% more accurate than guessing.",

This article assesses which\nChatGPT inputs (full text without tables, figures and references; title and\nabstract; title only) produce better quality score estimates, and the extent to\nwhich scores are affected by ChatGPT models and system prompts. The results\nshow that the optimal input is the article title and abstract, with average\nChatGPT scores based on these (30 iterations on a dataset of 51 papers)\ncorrelating at 0.67 with human scores, the highest ever reported. ChatGPT 4o is\nslightly better than 3.5-turbo (0.66), and 4o-mini (0.66). The results suggest\nthat article full texts might confuse LLM research quality evaluations, even\nthough complex system instructions for the task are more effective than simple\nones. Thus, whilst abstracts contain insufficient information for a thorough\nassessment of rigour, they may contain strong pointers about originality and\nsignificance. Finally, linear regression can be used to convert the model\nscores into the human scale scores, which is 31% more accurate than guessing."

The cache-based attack faces the challenge of\nconstructing candidate inputs in a large search space to hit and steal cached\nuser queries. To address these challenges, we propose two primary components.\nThe input constructor employs machine learning techniques and LLM-based\napproaches for vocabulary correlation learning while implementing optimized\nsearch mechanisms for generalized input construction. The time analyzer\nimplements statistical time fitting with outlier elimination to identify cache\nhit patterns, continuously providing feedback to refine the constructor's\nsearch strategy. We conduct experiments across two cache mechanisms and the\nresults demonstrate that our approach consistently attains high attack success\nrates in various applications.

To address these challenges, we propose two primary components.\nThe input constructor employs machine learning techniques and LLM-based\napproaches for vocabulary correlation learning while implementing optimized\nsearch mechanisms for generalized input construction. The time analyzer\nimplements statistical time fitting with outlier elimination to identify cache\nhit patterns, continuously providing feedback to refine the constructor's\nsearch strategy. We conduct experiments across two cache mechanisms and the\nresults demonstrate that our approach consistently attains high attack success\nrates in various applications. Our work highlights the security vulnerabilities\nassociated with performance optimizations, underscoring the necessity of\nprioritizing privacy and security alongside enhancements in LLM inference."

We introduce a novel task aimed at generating human motion\nvideos solely from reference images and natural language. This approach offers\ngreater flexibility and ease of use, as text is more accessible than the\ndesired guidance videos. However, training an end-to-end model for this task\nrequires millions of high-quality text and human motion video pairs, which are\nchallenging to obtain. To address this, we propose a new framework called\nFleximo, which leverages large-scale pre-trained text-to-3D motion models. This\napproach is not straightforward, as the text-generated skeletons may not\nconsistently match the scale of the reference image and may lack detailed\ninformation. To overcome these challenges, we introduce an anchor point based\nrescale method and design a skeleton adapter to fill in missing details and\nbridge the gap between text-to-motion and motion-to-video generation.

A large\nlanguage model (LLM) is employed to decompose natural language into discrete\nmotion sequences, enabling the generation of motion videos of any desired\nlength.

Prior studies observe that LLMs' performance declines\nwhen intervening on surface structure, arguing their success relies on surface\nstructure recognition. However, surface structure sensitivity does not prevent\ndeep structure comprehension. Rigorously evaluating LLMs' capability requires\nanalyzing both, yet deep structure is often overlooked. To this end, we assess\nLLMs' comprehension ability using causal mediation analysis, aiming to fully\ndiscover the capability of using both deep and surface structures.\nSpecifically, we formulate the comprehension of deep structure as direct causal\neffect (DCE) and that of surface structure as indirect causal effect (ICE),\nrespectively.

                "summary": "The success of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in the image domain\nhas garnered wide attention from the research community. Drawing on previous\nsuccessful experiences, researchers have recently explored extending the\nsuccess to the video understanding realms. Apart from training from scratch, an\nefficient way is to utilize the pre-trained image-LLMs, leading to two\nmainstream approaches, i.e. zero-shot inference and further fine-tuning with\nvideo data. In this work, our study of these approaches harvests an effective\ndata augmentation method. We first make a deeper inspection of the zero-shot\ninference way and identify two limitations, i.e. limited generalization and\nlack of temporal understanding capabilities. Thus, we further investigate the\nfine-tuning approach and find a low learning efficiency when simply using all\nthe video data samples, which can be attributed to a lack of instruction\ndiversity. Aiming at this issue, we develop a method called T2Vid to synthesize\nvideo-like samples to enrich the instruction diversity in the training corpus.\nIntegrating these data enables a simple and efficient training scheme, which\nachieves performance comparable to or even superior to using full video\ndatasets by training with just 15% the sample size. Meanwhile, we find that the\nproposed scheme can boost the performance of long video understanding without\ntraining with long video samples. We hope our study will spark more thinking\nabout using MLLMs for video understanding and curation of high-quality data.\nThe code is released at https://github.com/xjtupanda/T2Vid.",

                    "value": "The success of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in the image domain\nhas garnered wide attention from the research community. Drawing on previous\nsuccessful experiences, researchers have recently explored extending the\nsuccess to the video understanding realms. Apart from training from scratch, an\nefficient way is to utilize the pre-trained image-LLMs, leading to two\nmainstream approaches, i.e. zero-shot inference and further fine-tuning with\nvideo data. In this work, our study of these approaches harvests an effective\ndata augmentation method. We first make a deeper inspection of the zero-shot\ninference way and identify two limitations, i.e. limited generalization and\nlack of temporal understanding capabilities. Thus, we further investigate the\nfine-tuning approach and find a low learning efficiency when simply using all\nthe video data samples, which can be attributed to a lack of instruction\ndiversity. Aiming at this issue, we develop a method called T2Vid to synthesize\nvideo-like samples to enrich the instruction diversity in the training corpus.\nIntegrating these data enables a simple and efficient training scheme, which\nachieves performance comparable to or even superior to using full video\ndatasets by training with just 15% the sample size. Meanwhile, we find that the\nproposed scheme can boost the performance of long video understanding without\ntraining with long video samples. We hope our study will spark more thinking\nabout using MLLMs for video understanding and curation of high-quality data.\nThe code is released at https://github.com/xjtupanda/T2Vid."

Unlike traditional neural network models, foundation LMs obtain a\ngreat ability for transfer learning by acquiring rich commonsense knowledge\nthrough pre-training on extensive unsupervised datasets with a vast number of\nparameters. However, they still can not emulate human-like continuous learning\ndue to catastrophic forgetting. Consequently, various continual learning\n(CL)-based methodologies have been developed to refine LMs, enabling them to\nadapt to new tasks without forgetting previous knowledge. However, a systematic\ntaxonomy of existing approaches and a comparison of their performance are still\nlacking, which is the gap that our survey aims to fill. We delve into a\ncomprehensive review, summarization, and classification of the existing\nliterature on CL-based approaches applied to foundation language models, such\nas pre-trained language models (PLMs), large language models (LLMs) and\nvision-language models (VLMs). We divide these studies into offline CL and\nonline CL, which consist of traditional methods, parameter-efficient-based\nmethods, instruction tuning-based methods and continual pre-training methods.\nOffline CL encompasses domain-incremental learning, task-incremental learning,\nand class-incremental learning, while online CL is subdivided into hard task\nboundary and blurry task boundary settings. Additionally, we outline the\ntypical datasets and metrics employed in CL research and provide a detailed\nanalysis of the challenges and future work for LMs-based continual learning.",

Unlike traditional neural network models, foundation LMs obtain a\ngreat ability for transfer learning by acquiring rich commonsense knowledge\nthrough pre-training on extensive unsupervised datasets with a vast number of\nparameters. However, they still can not emulate human-like continuous learning\ndue to catastrophic forgetting. Consequently, various continual learning\n(CL)-based methodologies have been developed to refine LMs, enabling them to\nadapt to new tasks without forgetting previous knowledge. However, a systematic\ntaxonomy of existing approaches and a comparison of their performance are still\nlacking, which is the gap that our survey aims to fill. We delve into a\ncomprehensive review, summarization, and classification of the existing\nliterature on CL-based approaches applied to foundation language models, such\nas pre-trained language models (PLMs), large language models (LLMs) and\nvision-language models (VLMs). We divide these studies into offline CL and\nonline CL, which consist of traditional methods, parameter-efficient-based\nmethods, instruction tuning-based methods and continual pre-training methods.\nOffline CL encompasses domain-incremental learning, task-incremental learning,\nand class-incremental learning, while online CL is subdivided into hard task\nboundary and blurry task boundary settings. Additionally, we outline the\ntypical datasets and metrics employed in CL research and provide a detailed\nanalysis of the challenges and future work for LMs-based continual learning."

The surprising emergent\ncapabilities of MLLM, such as writing stories based on images and OCR-free math\nreasoning, are rare in traditional multimodal methods, suggesting a potential\npath to artificial general intelligence. To this end, both academia and\nindustry have endeavored to develop MLLMs that can compete with or even better\nthan GPT-4V, pushing the limit of research at a surprising speed. In this\npaper, we aim to trace and summarize the recent progress of MLLMs. First of\nall, we present the basic formulation of MLLM and delineate its related\nconcepts, including architecture, training strategy and data, as well as\nevaluation. Then, we introduce research topics about how MLLMs can be extended\nto support more granularity, modalities, languages, and scenarios. We continue\nwith multimodal hallucination and extended techniques, including Multimodal ICL\n(M-ICL), Multimodal CoT (M-CoT), and LLM-Aided Visual Reasoning (LAVR). To\nconclude the paper, we discuss existing challenges and point out promising\nresearch directions. In light of the fact that the era of MLLM has only just\nbegun, we will keep updating this survey and hope it can inspire more research.\nAn associated GitHub link collecting the latest papers is available at\nhttps://github.com/BradyFU/Awesome-Multimodal-Large-Language-Models.",

                    "value": "Recently, Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) represented by GPT-4V has\nbeen a new rising research hotspot, which uses powerful Large Language Models\n(LLMs) as a brain to perform multimodal tasks. The surprising emergent\ncapabilities of MLLM, such as writing stories based on images and OCR-free math\nreasoning, are rare in traditional multimodal methods, suggesting a potential\npath to artificial general intelligence. To this end, both academia and\nindustry have endeavored to develop MLLMs that can compete with or even better\nthan GPT-4V, pushing the limit of research at a surprising speed. In this\npaper, we aim to trace and summarize the recent progress of MLLMs. First of\nall, we present the basic formulation of MLLM and delineate its related\nconcepts, including architecture, training strategy and data, as well as\nevaluation. Then, we introduce research topics about how MLLMs can be extended\nto support more granularity, modalities, languages, and scenarios. We continue\nwith multimodal hallucination and extended techniques, including Multimodal ICL\n(M-ICL), Multimodal CoT (M-CoT), and LLM-Aided Visual Reasoning (LAVR). To\nconclude the paper, we discuss existing challenges and point out promising\nresearch directions. In light of the fact that the era of MLLM has only just\nbegun, we will keep updating this survey and hope it can inspire more research.\nAn associated GitHub link collecting the latest papers is available at\nhttps://github.com/BradyFU/Awesome-Multimodal-Large-Language-Models."

As HVAC energy demands are expected to rise, optimising\nsystem efficiency is crucial for reducing future energy use and mitigating\nclimate change. Existing control strategies lack generalisation and require\nextensive training and data, limiting their rapid deployment across diverse\nbuildings. This paper introduces HVAC-DPT, a Decision-Pretrained Transformer\nusing in-context Reinforcement Learning (RL) for multi-zone HVAC control.\nHVAC-DPT frames HVAC control as a sequential prediction task, training a causal\ntransformer on interaction histories generated by diverse RL agents. This\napproach enables HVAC-DPT to refine its policy in-context, without modifying\nnetwork parameters, allowing for deployment across different buildings without\nthe need for additional training or data collection.

                    "value": "Building operations consume approximately 40% of global energy, with Heating,\nVentilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems responsible for up to 50% of\nthis consumption. As HVAC energy demands are expected to rise, optimising\nsystem efficiency is crucial for reducing future energy use and mitigating\nclimate change. Existing control strategies lack generalisation and require\nextensive training and data, limiting their rapid deployment across diverse\nbuildings. This paper introduces HVAC-DPT, a Decision-Pretrained Transformer\nusing in-context Reinforcement Learning (RL) for multi-zone HVAC control.\nHVAC-DPT frames HVAC control as a sequential prediction task, training a causal\ntransformer on interaction histories generated by diverse RL agents. This\napproach enables HVAC-DPT to refine its policy in-context, without modifying\nnetwork parameters, allowing for deployment across different buildings without\nthe need for additional training or data collection. HVAC-DPT reduces energy\nconsumption in unseen buildings by 45% compared to the baseline controller,\noffering a scalable and effective approach to mitigating the increasing\nenvironmental impact of HVAC systems."

Evaluating such\nrobustness requires a controlled experimental setup that allows for systematic\ninsights into the model's behavior. However, we demonstrate that current setups\nfail to offer sufficiently thorough evaluations, limiting their ability to\naccurately assess model robustness. To address this gap, our work introduces a\nnovel framework, called SURE-VQA, centered around three key requirements to\novercome the current pitfalls and systematically analyze the robustness of\nVLMs: 1) Since robustness on synthetic shifts does not necessarily translate to\nreal-world shifts, robustness should be measured on real-world shifts that are\ninherent to the VQA data; 2) Traditional token-matching metrics often fail to\ncapture underlying semantics, necessitating the use of large language models\n(LLMs) for more accurate semantic evaluation; 3) Model performance often lacks\ninterpretability due to missing sanity baselines, thus meaningful baselines\nshould be reported that allow assessing the multimodal impact on the VLM. To\ndemonstrate the relevance of this framework, we conduct a study on the\nrobustness of various fine-tuning methods across three medical datasets with\nfour different types of distribution shifts.

In recent years several\nlarge-scale and high-quality pre-training datasets have been released to\naccelerate the research of LLMs, including ChineseWebText1.0, C4, Pile,\nWanJuan, MAPCC and others. However, as LLMs continue to evolve, focus has\nincreasingly shifted to domain-specific capabilities and safety concerns,\nmaking those previous coarse-grained texts insufficient for meeting training\nrequirements. Furthermore, fine-grained information, such as quality, domain\nand toxicity, is becoming increasingly important in building powerful and\nreliable LLMs for various scenarios. To address these challenges, in this paper\nwe propose a new tool-chain called MDFG-tool for constructing large-scale and\nhigh-quality Chinese datasets with multi-dimensional and fine-grained\ninformation. First, we employ manually crafted rules to discard explicit noisy\ntexts from raw contents. Second, the quality evaluation model, domain\nclassifier, and toxicity evaluation model are well-designed to assess the\nremaining cleaned data respectively. Finally, we integrate these three types of\nfine-grained information for each text. With this approach, we release the\nlargest, high-quality and fine-grained Chinese text ChineseWebText2.0, which\nconsists of 3.8TB and each text is associated with a quality score, domain\nlabels, a toxicity label and a toxicity score, facilitating the LLM researchers\nto select data based on various types of fine-grained information.

This\ntechnology is essential for applications such as virtual assistants,\ntranscription services, and communication tools.

While traditional AVSR models trained on large-scale\ndatasets with numerous parameters can achieve remarkable accuracy, often\nsurpassing human performance, they also come with high training costs and\ndeployment challenges. To address these issues, we introduce an efficient AVSR\nmodel that reduces the number of parameters through the integration of a Dual\nConformer Interaction Module (DCIM). In addition, we propose a pre-training\nmethod that further optimizes model performance by selectively updating\nparameters, leading to significant improvements in efficiency.

To facilitate such growth and provide convenience for developers when\ncreating and updating software, reusing open-source software (i.e., thirdparty\nlibrary reuses) has become one of the most effective and efficient methods.\nUnfortunately, the practice of reusing third-party libraries (TPLs) can also\nintroduce vulnerabilities (known as 1-day vulnerabilities) because of the low\nmaintenance of TPLs, resulting in many vulnerable versions remaining in use. If\nthe software incorporating these TPLs fails to detect the introduced\nvulnerabilities and leads to delayed updates, it will exacerbate the security\nrisks. However, the complicated code dependencies and flexibility of TPL reuses\nmake the detection of 1-day vulnerability a challenging task. To support\ndevelopers in securely reusing TPLs during software development, we design and\nimplement VULTURE, an effective and efficient detection tool, aiming at\nidentifying 1-day vulnerabilities that arise from the reuse of vulnerable TPLs.\nIt first executes a database creation method, TPLFILTER, which leverages the\nLarge Language Model (LLM) to automatically build a unique database for the\ntargeted platform. Instead of relying on code-level similarity comparison,\nVULTURE employs hashing-based comparison to explore the dependencies among the\ncollected TPLs and identify the similarities between the TPLs and the target\nprojects.

Concretely, we combine\nacrostica and sensorimotor norms with the established red-green watermark to\nachieve a 98% detection rate. After a paraphrasing attack the performance\nremains high with 95% detection rate. The red-green feature alone as baseline\nachieves a detection rate of 49%. The evaluation of all feature combinations\nreveals that the ensemble of all three consistently has the highest detection\nrate across several LLMs and watermark strength settings. Due to the\nflexibility of combining features in the ensemble, various requirements and\ntrade-offs can be addressed. Additionally, for all ensemble configurations the\nsame detection function can be used without adaptations.

Concretely, we combine\nacrostica and sensorimotor norms with the established red-green watermark to\nachieve a 98% detection rate. After a paraphrasing attack the performance\nremains high with 95% detection rate. The red-green feature alone as baseline\nachieves a detection rate of 49%. The evaluation of all feature combinations\nreveals that the ensemble of all three consistently has the highest detection\nrate across several LLMs and watermark strength settings. Due to the\nflexibility of combining features in the ensemble, various requirements and\ntrade-offs can be addressed. Additionally, for all ensemble configurations the\nsame detection function can be used without adaptations. This method is\nparticularly of interest to facilitate accountability and prevent societal\nharm."

                "summary": "Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting elicits large language models (LLMs) to\nproduce a series of intermediate reasoning steps before arriving at the final\nanswer. However, when transitioning to vision-language models (VLMs), their\ntext-only rationales struggle to express the fine-grained associations with the\noriginal image. In this paper, we propose an image-incorporated multimodal\nChain-of-Thought, named \\textbf{Interleaved-modal Chain-of-Thought (ICoT)},\nwhich generates sequential reasoning steps consisting of paired visual and\ntextual rationales to infer the final answer. Intuitively, the novel ICoT\nrequires VLMs to enable the generation of fine-grained interleaved-modal\ncontent, which is hard for current VLMs to fulfill. Considering that the\nrequired visual information is usually part of the input image, we propose\n\\textbf{Attention-driven Selection (ADS)} to realize ICoT over existing VLMs.\nADS intelligently inserts regions of the input image to generate the\ninterleaved-modal reasoning steps with ignorable additional latency.

                    "value": "Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting elicits large language models (LLMs) to\nproduce a series of intermediate reasoning steps before arriving at the final\nanswer. However, when transitioning to vision-language models (VLMs), their\ntext-only rationales struggle to express the fine-grained associations with the\noriginal image. In this paper, we propose an image-incorporated multimodal\nChain-of-Thought, named \\textbf{Interleaved-modal Chain-of-Thought (ICoT)},\nwhich generates sequential reasoning steps consisting of paired visual and\ntextual rationales to infer the final answer. Intuitively, the novel ICoT\nrequires VLMs to enable the generation of fine-grained interleaved-modal\ncontent, which is hard for current VLMs to fulfill. Considering that the\nrequired visual information is usually part of the input image, we propose\n\\textbf{Attention-driven Selection (ADS)} to realize ICoT over existing VLMs.\nADS intelligently inserts regions of the input image to generate the\ninterleaved-modal reasoning steps with ignorable additional latency. ADS relies\nsolely on the attention map of VLMs without the need for parameterization, and\ntherefore it is a plug-and-play strategy that can be generalized to a spectrum\nof VLMs. We apply ADS to realize ICoT on two popular VLMs of different\narchitectures.

In this paper, we\nexplore an alternative approach that leverages standard search engine APIs to\ndynamically integrate the latest online information (without maintaining any\nindex for any fixed corpus), thereby improving the quality of generated\ncontent. We design a collaborative LLM-based paradigm, where we include: (i) a\nparser-LLM that determines if the Internet augmented generation is demanded and\nextracts the search keywords if so with a single inference; (ii) a mixed\nranking strategy that re-ranks the retrieved HTML files to eliminate bias\nintroduced from the search engine API; and (iii) an extractor-LLM that can\naccurately and efficiently extract relevant information from the fresh content\nin each HTML file. We conduct extensive empirical studies to evaluate the\nperformance of this Internet search augmented generation paradigm.

Recognizing the importance of both\ndata quality and quantity, our approach combines highly curated manually\nverified data, unverified yet valuable data, and synthetic data.

For instruction-fine tuning,\nwe amalgamate existing Indic datasets, translate/transliterate English datasets\ninto Indian languages, and utilize LLaMa2 and Mixtral models to create\nconversations grounded in articles from Indian Wikipedia and Wikihow.\nAdditionally, we address toxicity alignment by generating toxic prompts for\nmultiple scenarios and then generate non-toxic responses by feeding these toxic\nprompts to an aligned LLaMa2 model. We hope that the datasets, tools, and\nresources released as a part of this work will not only propel the research and\ndevelopment of Indic LLMs but also establish an open-source blueprint for\nextending such efforts to other languages.

We introduce a novel task aimed at generating human motion\nvideos solely from reference images and natural language. This approach offers\ngreater flexibility and ease of use, as text is more accessible than the\ndesired guidance videos. However, training an end-to-end model for this task\nrequires millions of high-quality text and human motion video pairs, which are\nchallenging to obtain. To address this, we propose a new framework called\nFleximo, which leverages large-scale pre-trained text-to-3D motion models. This\napproach is not straightforward, as the text-generated skeletons may not\nconsistently match the scale of the reference image and may lack detailed\ninformation. To overcome these challenges, we introduce an anchor point based\nrescale method and design a skeleton adapter to fill in missing details and\nbridge the gap between text-to-motion and motion-to-video generation. We also\npropose a video refinement process to further enhance video quality. A large\nlanguage model (LLM) is employed to decompose natural language into discrete\nmotion sequences, enabling the generation of motion videos of any desired\nlength. To assess the performance of Fleximo, we introduce a new benchmark\ncalled MotionBench, which includes 400 videos across 20 identities and 20\nmotions. We also propose a new metric, MotionScore, to evaluate the accuracy of\nmotion following. Both qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that\nour method outperforms existing text-conditioned image-to-video generation\nmethods.

We design a three-stage training strategy for modeling\nboth the speech input and output, enabling Freeze-Omni to obtain\nspeech-to-speech conversation ability using text-speech paired data (such as\nASR and TTS data) and only 60,000 multi-round text Q&A data on 8 GPUs.\nMoreover, we can effectively ensure that the intelligence of the Freeze-Omni in\nthe speech modality is at the same level compared with that in the text\nmodality of its backbone LLM, while achieving low latency end-to-end spoken\nresponse. In addition, we also designed a method to achieve duplex dialogue\nability through multi-task training, giving Freeze-Omni a more natural style of\ndialogue ability between users and agents.

In summary, Freeze-Omni holds great\npotential to conduct speech-to-speech dialogue based on a multimodal LLM under\nthe condition of a frozen LLM, avoiding the catastrophic forgetting problem\ncaused by limited data and training resources."

                "summary": "With the increasing application scope of spiking neural networks (SNN), the\ncomplexity of SNN models has surged, leading to an exponential growth in demand\nfor AI computility. As the new generation computing architecture of the neural\nnetworks, the efficiency and power consumption of distributed storage and\nparallel computing in the many-core near-memory computing system have attracted\nmuch attention. Among them, the mapping problem from logical cores to physical\ncores is one of the research hotspots. In order to improve the computing\nparallelism and system throughput of the many-core near-memory computing\nsystem, and to reduce power consumption, we propose a SNN training many-core\ndeployment optimization method based on Off-policy Deterministic Actor-Critic.\nWe utilize deep reinforcement learning as a nonlinear optimizer, treating the\nmany-core topology as network graph features and using graph convolution to\ninput the many-core structure into the policy network. We update the parameters\nof the policy network through near-end policy optimization to achieve\ndeployment optimization of SNN models in the many-core near-memory computing\narchitecture to reduce chip power consumption. To handle large-dimensional\naction spaces, we use continuous values matching the number of cores as the\noutput of the policy network and then discretize them again to obtain new\ndeployment schemes. Furthermore, to further balance inter-core computation\nlatency and improve system throughput, we propose a model partitioning method\nwith a balanced storage and computation strategy. Our method overcomes the\nproblems such as uneven computation and storage loads between cores, and the\nformation of local communication hotspots, significantly reducing model\ntraining time, communication costs, and average flow load between cores in the\nmany-core near-memory computing architecture.",

                    "value": "With the increasing application scope of spiking neural networks (SNN), the\ncomplexity of SNN models has surged, leading to an exponential growth in demand\nfor AI computility. As the new generation computing architecture of the neural\nnetworks, the efficiency and power consumption of distributed storage and\nparallel computing in the many-core near-memory computing system have attracted\nmuch attention. Among them, the mapping problem from logical cores to physical\ncores is one of the research hotspots. In order to improve the computing\nparallelism and system throughput of the many-core near-memory computing\nsystem, and to reduce power consumption, we propose a SNN training many-core\ndeployment optimization method based on Off-policy Deterministic Actor-Critic.\nWe utilize deep reinforcement learning as a nonlinear optimizer, treating the\nmany-core topology as network graph features and using graph convolution to\ninput the many-core structure into the policy network. We update the parameters\nof the policy network through near-end policy optimization to achieve\ndeployment optimization of SNN models in the many-core near-memory computing\narchitecture to reduce chip power consumption. To handle large-dimensional\naction spaces, we use continuous values matching the number of cores as the\noutput of the policy network and then discretize them again to obtain new\ndeployment schemes. Furthermore, to further balance inter-core computation\nlatency and improve system throughput, we propose a model partitioning method\nwith a balanced storage and computation strategy. Our method overcomes the\nproblems such as uneven computation and storage loads between cores, and the\nformation of local communication hotspots, significantly reducing model\ntraining time, communication costs, and average flow load between cores in the\nmany-core near-memory computing architecture."

We introduce secure multi-party\ndecoding (SMD), which leverages confidential computing to confine user prompts\nto a trusted execution environment (TEE), namely a confidential virtual machine\n(CVM), while allowing service providers to generate tokens efficiently.

As such, we propose a novel approach that equips\nLLMs with over 10 tools, providing them access to the internal knowledge base\nand API calls used in production. We evaluate our model on a dataset of real\nusers and show that it generates relevant, novel, and diverse recommendations\ncompared to vanilla LLMs. Furthermore, we conduct ablation studies to\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of using the full range of tools in our toolbox.\nWe share our designs and lessons learned from deploying the system for internal\nalpha release.

In contrast, SSL-pretrained models like DINO excel at\nextracting rich visual features due to their specialized training paradigm.\nYet, these SSL models require an additional supervised linear probing step,\nwhich relies on fully labeled data which is often expensive and difficult to\nobtain at scale.

Our approach unfolds in three key steps: (1) We generate robust textual\nfeature embeddings that more accurately represent object classes by leveraging\nclass-specific descriptions from LLMs, enabling more effective zero-shot\nclassification compared to CLIP's default name-specific prompts. (2) These\ntextual embeddings are then used to produce pseudo-labels to train an alignment\nmodule that integrates the complementary strengths of LLM description-based\ntextual embeddings and DINO's visual features. (3) Finally, we prompt-tune\nCLIP's vision encoder through DINO-assisted supervision using the trained\nalignment module. This three-step process allows us to harness the best of\nvisual and textual foundation models, resulting in a powerful and efficient\napproach that surpasses state-of-the-art label-free classification methods.\nNotably, our framework, NoLA (No Labels Attached), achieves an average absolute\ngain of 3.6% over the state-of-the-art LaFter across 11 diverse image\nclassification datasets.",

VeCoGen takes a formal specification in ANSI/ISO C\nSpecification Language (ACSL), a natural language specification, and a set of\ntest cases to attempt to generate a program. This program-generation process\nconsists of two steps. First, VeCoGen generates an initial set of candidate\nprograms. Secondly, the tool iteratively improves on previously generated\ncandidates. If a candidate program meets the formal specification, then we are\nsure the program is correct. We evaluate VeCoGen on 15 problems presented in\nCodeforces competitions. On these problems, VeCoGen solves 13 problems. This\nwork shows the potential of combining LLMs with formal verification to automate\nprogram generation.",

VeCoGen takes a formal specification in ANSI/ISO C\nSpecification Language (ACSL), a natural language specification, and a set of\ntest cases to attempt to generate a program. This program-generation process\nconsists of two steps. First, VeCoGen generates an initial set of candidate\nprograms. Secondly, the tool iteratively improves on previously generated\ncandidates. If a candidate program meets the formal specification, then we are\nsure the program is correct. We evaluate VeCoGen on 15 problems presented in\nCodeforces competitions. On these problems, VeCoGen solves 13 problems. This\nwork shows the potential of combining LLMs with formal verification to automate\nprogram generation."
