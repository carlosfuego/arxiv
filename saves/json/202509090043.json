                "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have excelled in various applications, yet\nserving them at scale is challenging due to their substantial resource demands\nand high latency. Our real-world studies reveal that over 70% of user requests\nto LLMs have semantically similar counterparts, suggesting the potential for\nknowledge transfer among requests. However, naively caching and reusing past\nresponses leads to a big quality drop. In this paper, we introduce IC-Cache, a\ncaching system that enables live LLM capability augmentation to improve serving\nefficiency: by leveraging historical request-response pairs from larger models\nas in-context examples, IC-Cache empowers small LLMs to imitate and even exceed\nthe compositional abilities (e.g., reasoning) of their larger counterparts,\nenabling selective offloading of requests to reduce cost and latency. Achieving\nthis live augmentation at scale introduces intricate trade-offs between\nresponse quality, latency, and system throughput. For a new request, IC-Cache\nefficiently selects similar, high-utility examples to prepend them to the new\nrequest's input.

                    "value": "Large language models (LLMs) have excelled in various applications, yet\nserving them at scale is challenging due to their substantial resource demands\nand high latency. Our real-world studies reveal that over 70% of user requests\nto LLMs have semantically similar counterparts, suggesting the potential for\nknowledge transfer among requests. However, naively caching and reusing past\nresponses leads to a big quality drop. In this paper, we introduce IC-Cache, a\ncaching system that enables live LLM capability augmentation to improve serving\nefficiency: by leveraging historical request-response pairs from larger models\nas in-context examples, IC-Cache empowers small LLMs to imitate and even exceed\nthe compositional abilities (e.g., reasoning) of their larger counterparts,\nenabling selective offloading of requests to reduce cost and latency. Achieving\nthis live augmentation at scale introduces intricate trade-offs between\nresponse quality, latency, and system throughput. For a new request, IC-Cache\nefficiently selects similar, high-utility examples to prepend them to the new\nrequest's input. At scale, it adaptively routes requests across LLMs of varying\ncapabilities, accounting for response quality and serving loads. IC-Cache\nemploys a cost-aware cache replay mechanism that refines example quality\noffline to maximize online cache utility and efficiency.

It features a KVCache-centric disaggregated architecture that\nseparates the prefill and decoding clusters. It also leverages the\nunderutilized CPU, DRAM, and SSD resources of the GPU cluster to implement a\ndisaggregated cache of KVCache. The core of Mooncake is its KVCache-centric\nscheduler, which balances maximizing overall effective throughput while meeting\nlatency-related Service Level Objectives (SLOs). Unlike traditional studies\nthat assume all requests will be processed, Mooncake faces challenges due to\nhighly overloaded scenarios. To mitigate these, we developed a prediction-based\nearly rejection policy. Experiments show that Mooncake excels in long-context\nscenarios. Compared to the baseline method, Mooncake can achieve up to a 525%\nincrease in throughput in certain simulated scenarios while adhering to SLOs.\nUnder real workloads, Mooncake's innovative architecture enables Kimi to handle\n75% more requests.",

Recurrent models offer high\nefficiency, but compressing the full sequence into a fixed-size and holistic\nrepresentation suffers from memory degradation in long contexts and limits\nfine-grained retrieval. To address this, we propose RAT, an intermediate design\nthat bridges the efficiency of RNNs and capacity of attention. RAT partitions\nthe input into chunks, applies recurrence within each chunk for local\ndependencies, and softmax-based attention across chunks for long-range\ninteractions. This design mitigates memory degradation and enables direct\naccess to distant tokens, while retaining computational efficiency.\nEmpirically, with a chunk size of 16, the RAT block achieves a 7x improvement\nin training speed with 100K token sequences and 9x in generation at the 4K\nposition, while maintaining similar performance compared to standard attention.\nWe demonstrate this by training 1.3B parameter models from scratch and\nperforming large-scale evaluations, including short- and long-context\nbenchmarks, as well as supervised fine-tuning~(SFT). We further propose a\nhybrid architecture that interleaves RAT with local attention. By combining\nefficient long-range modeling with strong local interactions, this hybrid\ndesign not only improves inference speed and reduces cache memory usage, but\nalso consistently enhances performance and shows the overall best results.

One of the main challenges towards the successful\ndeployment of LLMs is memory management, since they typically involve billions\nof parameters.

This raises the equally critical issue of efficiently\nmanaging the limited cache of the system, in that frequently used experts\nshould be stored in the fast cache rather than in the slower secondary memory.\n  In this work, we introduce and study a new paging problem that models expert\nmanagement optimization. Our formulation captures both the layered architecture\nof LLMs and the requirement that experts are cached efficiently. We first\npresent lower bounds on the competitive ratio of both deterministic and\nrandomized algorithms, which show that under mild assumptions, LRU-like\npolicies have good theoretical competitive performance. We then propose a\nlayer-based extension of LRU that is tailored to the problem at hand.\n  Extensive simulations on both synthetic datasets and actual traces of MoE\nusage show that our algorithm outperforms policies for the classic paging\nproblem, such as the standard LRU.",

                "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in\nleveraging extensive external knowledge to enhance responses in multi-turn and\nagentic applications, such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). However,\nprocessing long-context inputs introduces significant system latency and\ndemands substantial memory for the key-value cache, resulting in reduced\nthroughput and a fundamental trade-off between knowledge enrichment and system\nefficiency. While minimizing latency for long-context inputs is a primary\nobjective for LLMs, we contend that RAG require specialized consideration. In\nRAG, much of the LLM context consists of concatenated passages from retrieval,\nwith only a small subset directly relevant to the query. These passages often\nexhibit low semantic similarity due to diversity or deduplication during\nre-ranking, leading to block-diagonal attention patterns that differ from those\nin standard LLM generation tasks. Based on this observation, we argue that most\ncomputations over the RAG context during decoding are unnecessary and can be\neliminated with minimal impact on performance. To this end, we propose REFRAG,\nan efficient decoding framework that compresses, senses, and expands to improve\nlatency in RAG applications. By exploiting the sparsity structure, we\ndemonstrate a 30.85 the time-to-first-token acceleration (3.75 improvement to\nprevious work) without loss in perplexity. In addition, our optimization\nframework for large context enables REFRAG to extend the context size of LLMs\nby 16. We provide rigorous validation of REFRAG across diverse long-context\ntasks, including RAG, multi-turn conversations, and long document\nsummarization, spanning a wide range of datasets. Experimental results confirm\nthat REFRAG delivers substantial speedup with no loss in accuracy compared to\nLLaMA models and other state-of-the-art baselines across various context sizes.",

However,\nprocessing long-context inputs introduces significant system latency and\ndemands substantial memory for the key-value cache, resulting in reduced\nthroughput and a fundamental trade-off between knowledge enrichment and system\nefficiency. While minimizing latency for long-context inputs is a primary\nobjective for LLMs, we contend that RAG require specialized consideration. In\nRAG, much of the LLM context consists of concatenated passages from retrieval,\nwith only a small subset directly relevant to the query. These passages often\nexhibit low semantic similarity due to diversity or deduplication during\nre-ranking, leading to block-diagonal attention patterns that differ from those\nin standard LLM generation tasks. Based on this observation, we argue that most\ncomputations over the RAG context during decoding are unnecessary and can be\neliminated with minimal impact on performance. To this end, we propose REFRAG,\nan efficient decoding framework that compresses, senses, and expands to improve\nlatency in RAG applications. By exploiting the sparsity structure, we\ndemonstrate a 30.85 the time-to-first-token acceleration (3.75 improvement to\nprevious work) without loss in perplexity. In addition, our optimization\nframework for large context enables REFRAG to extend the context size of LLMs\nby 16. We provide rigorous validation of REFRAG across diverse long-context\ntasks, including RAG, multi-turn conversations, and long document\nsummarization, spanning a wide range of datasets. Experimental results confirm\nthat REFRAG delivers substantial speedup with no loss in accuracy compared to\nLLaMA models and other state-of-the-art baselines across various context sizes."

State-of-the-art KV cache compression\ntechniques, such as quantization and pruning, apply uniform treatment to both\nkeys and values, and discard unimportant tokens entirely, overlooking the\nfine-grained distinctions in the significance of individual KV cache\ncomponents. To address such limitations, we introduce \\textit{DiffKV}, a novel\nframework for efficient KV cache compression that exploits three levels of\ndifferentiation in the KV cache: (1) the differing impact of keys and values on\nattention computation, (2) the varying importance of tokens, and (3) the\ndiverse dynamic sparsity patterns across attention heads. These levels of\ndifferentiation introduce irregular memory usage patterns across different\nrequests and attention heads, posing significant scalability challenges for\nmemory management. To address these challenges, DiffKV proposes an on-GPU\nmemory manager that compacts fragmented free memory list into contiguous\nregions in parallel, effectively translating sparsity in the KV cache into\nperformance gains. We evaluate DiffKV on several mainstream LLMs, including the\nemerging thinking models that generate extended chains of thought. DiffKV is\nable to compress the KV cache by $2.7\\times$ to $5.7\\times$ with near-lossless\naccuracy on complex workloads requiring sophisticated reasoning and\nlong-generation capabilities, and enhances throughput by $1.9\\times$ to\n$5.4\\times$.

These levels of\ndifferentiation introduce irregular memory usage patterns across different\nrequests and attention heads, posing significant scalability challenges for\nmemory management. To address these challenges, DiffKV proposes an on-GPU\nmemory manager that compacts fragmented free memory list into contiguous\nregions in parallel, effectively translating sparsity in the KV cache into\nperformance gains. We evaluate DiffKV on several mainstream LLMs, including the\nemerging thinking models that generate extended chains of thought. DiffKV is\nable to compress the KV cache by $2.7\\times$ to $5.7\\times$ with near-lossless\naccuracy on complex workloads requiring sophisticated reasoning and\nlong-generation capabilities, and enhances throughput by $1.9\\times$ to\n$5.4\\times$. Source codes of DiffKV are available at\nhttps://github.com/zyqCSL/DiffKV."

Containment is determined through the\ngeneralized winding number (GWN), a mathematical construction that is\nindifferent to the arrangement of surfaces in the shape. Applying contemporary\ntechniques for the 3D GWN to trimmed NURBS surfaces requires some form of\ngeometric discretization, introducing computational inefficiency to the\nalgorithm and even risking containment misclassifications near the surface. In\ncontrast, our proposed method uses a novel reformulation of the relevant\nsurface integral based on Stokes' theorem, which operates on the boundary and\ntrimming curves as provided through rapidly converging adaptive quadrature.\nBatches of queries are further accelerated by memoizing (i.e.\\ caching and\nreusing) quadrature node positions and tangents as they are evaluated. We\ndemonstrate that our GWN method is robust to complex trimming geometry in a CAD\nmodel, and is accurate up to arbitrary precision at arbitrary distances from\nthe surface. The derived containment query is therefore robust to model\nnon-watertightness while respecting all curved features of the input shape.",

In this paper, we propose a\nnovel pruning method for PD disaggregation inference, enabling more precise and\nefficient block and KV Cache pruning. Our approach constructs pruning and\ndistillation sets to perform iterative block removal independently for the\nprefill and decode stages, obtaining better pruning solutions. Moreover, we\nintroduce a token-aware cache pruning mechanism that retains all KV Cache in\nthe prefill stage but selectively reuses entries for the first and last token\nsequences in selected layers during decode, reducing communication costs with\nminimal overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach\nconsistently achieves strong performance in both PD disaggregation and PD\nunified settings without disaggregation.

Both models\nare trained on large-scale multilingual and multimodal datasets sourced via\nresponsible web crawling, licensed corpora, and high-quality synthetic data,\nthen further refined with supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning on\na new asynchronous platform. The resulting models support several additional\nlanguages while understanding images and executing tool calls. In public\nbenchmarks and human evaluations, both the server model and the on-device model\nmatch or surpass comparably sized open baselines.\n  A new Swift-centric Foundation Models framework exposes guided generation,\nconstrained tool calling, and LoRA adapter fine-tuning, allowing developers to\nintegrate these capabilities with a few lines of code.

Recent methods typically edit rendered multi-view images and then\nreconstruct 3D models, but they face challenges in precisely preserving\nunedited regions and overall coherence. Inspired by structured 3D generative\nmodels, we propose VoxHammer, a novel training-free approach that performs\nprecise and coherent editing in 3D latent space. Given a 3D model, VoxHammer\nfirst predicts its inversion trajectory and obtains its inverted latents and\nkey-value tokens at each timestep. Subsequently, in the denoising and editing\nphase, we replace the denoising features of preserved regions with the\ncorresponding inverted latents and cached key-value tokens. By retaining these\ncontextual features, this approach ensures consistent reconstruction of\npreserved areas and coherent integration of edited parts. To evaluate the\nconsistency of preserved regions, we constructed Edit3D-Bench, a\nhuman-annotated dataset comprising hundreds of samples, each with carefully\nlabeled 3D editing regions. Experiments demonstrate that VoxHammer\nsignificantly outperforms existing methods in terms of both 3D consistency of\npreserved regions and overall quality. Our method holds promise for\nsynthesizing high-quality edited paired data, thereby laying the data\nfoundation for in-context 3D generation.

Given a 3D model, VoxHammer\nfirst predicts its inversion trajectory and obtains its inverted latents and\nkey-value tokens at each timestep. Subsequently, in the denoising and editing\nphase, we replace the denoising features of preserved regions with the\ncorresponding inverted latents and cached key-value tokens. By retaining these\ncontextual features, this approach ensures consistent reconstruction of\npreserved areas and coherent integration of edited parts. To evaluate the\nconsistency of preserved regions, we constructed Edit3D-Bench, a\nhuman-annotated dataset comprising hundreds of samples, each with carefully\nlabeled 3D editing regions. Experiments demonstrate that VoxHammer\nsignificantly outperforms existing methods in terms of both 3D consistency of\npreserved regions and overall quality. Our method holds promise for\nsynthesizing high-quality edited paired data, thereby laying the data\nfoundation for in-context 3D generation.

PAR leverages the world\nknowledge embedded in video pretraining to understand physical dynamics without\nrequiring action pretraining, enabling accurate video prediction and consistent\naction trajectories. It also adopts a DiT-based de-tokenizer to model frames\nand actions as continuous tokens, mitigating quantization errors and\nfacilitating mutual enhancement. Furthermore, we incorporate a causal mask with\ninverse kinematics, parallel training, and the KV-cache mechanism to further\nimprove performance and efficiency. Experiments on the ManiSkill benchmark show\nthat PAR achieves a 100\\% success rate on the PushCube task, matches the\nperformance of action-pretrained baselines on other tasks, and accurately\npredicts future videos with tightly aligned action trajectories.

To\naddress this, existing approaches compress KV caches across adjacent layers\nwith highly similar attention patterns. However, these methods often apply a\nfixed compression scheme across all conversations, selecting the same layer\npairs for compression without considering conversation-specific attention\ndynamics. This static strategy overlooks variability in attention pattern\nsimilarity across different conversations, which can lead to noticeable\naccuracy degradation.\n  We present Krul, a multi-turn LLM inference system that enables accurate and\nefficient KV cache restoration. Krul dynamically selects compression strategies\nbased on attention similarity across layer pairs and uses a\nrecomputation-loading pipeline to restore the KV cache. It introduces three key\ninnovations: 1) a preemptive compression strategy selector to preserve critical\ncontext for future conversation turns and selects a customized strategy for the\nconversation; 2) a token-wise heterogeneous attention similarity estimator to\nmitigate the attention similarity computation and storage overhead during model\ngeneration; 3) a bubble-free restoration scheduler to reduce potential bubbles\nbrought by the imbalance of recomputing and loading stream due to compressed KV\ncaches. Empirical evaluations on real-world tasks demonstrate that Krul\nachieves a 1.5x-2.68x reduction in time-to-first-token (TTFT) and a 1.33x-2.35x\nreduction in KV cache storage compared to state-of-the-art methods without\ncompromising generation quality.",

However, existing\nsolutions are limited, e.g., long-context models require large compute budgets,\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) needs training data, and\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG) entails complex task-specific designs.\nThough in-context approaches overcome many of these issues, methods with\nshort-context LLMs are inefficient, trading context for processing more tokens.\nWe introduce PRISM, a highly token-efficient in-context method based on\nstructured schemas that outperforms baselines on diverse tasks with 4x shorter\ncontexts. This approach produces concise outputs and efficiently leverages\nkey-value (KV) caches to reduce costs by up to 54%. PRISM scales down to tiny\ncontexts without increasing costs or sacrificing quality, and generalizes to\nnew tasks with minimal effort by generating schemas from task descriptions.",

However, existing\nsolutions are limited, e.g., long-context models require large compute budgets,\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) needs training data, and\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG) entails complex task-specific designs.\nThough in-context approaches overcome many of these issues, methods with\nshort-context LLMs are inefficient, trading context for processing more tokens.\nWe introduce PRISM, a highly token-efficient in-context method based on\nstructured schemas that outperforms baselines on diverse tasks with 4x shorter\ncontexts. This approach produces concise outputs and efficiently leverages\nkey-value (KV) caches to reduce costs by up to 54%. PRISM scales down to tiny\ncontexts without increasing costs or sacrificing quality, and generalizes to\nnew tasks with minimal effort by generating schemas from task descriptions."

                "summary": "Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of acceleration techniques\nfor diffusion models, especially caching-based acceleration methods. These\nstudies seek to answer two fundamental questions: \"When to cache\" and \"How to\nuse cache\", typically relying on predefined empirical laws or dataset-level\npriors to determine the timing of caching and utilizing handcrafted rules for\nleveraging multi-step caches. However, given the highly dynamic nature of the\ndiffusion process, they often exhibit limited generalizability and fail on\noutlier samples. In this paper, a strong correlation is revealed between the\nvariation patterns of the shallow-layer feature differences in the diffusion\nmodel and those of final model outputs. Moreover, we have observed that the\nfeatures from different model layers form similar trajectories. Based on these\nobservations, we present DiCache, a novel training-free adaptive caching\nstrategy for accelerating diffusion models at runtime, answering both when and\nhow to cache within a unified framework. Specifically, DiCache is composed of\ntwo principal components: (1) Online Probe Profiling Scheme leverages a\nshallow-layer online probe to obtain a stable prior for the caching error in\nreal time, enabling the model to autonomously determine caching schedules. (2)\nDynamic Cache Trajectory Alignment combines multi-step caches based on\nshallow-layer probe feature trajectory to better approximate the current\nfeature, facilitating higher visual quality. Extensive experiments validate\nDiCache's capability in achieving higher efficiency and improved visual\nfidelity over state-of-the-art methods on various leading diffusion models\nincluding WAN 2.1, HunyuanVideo for video generation, and Flux for image\ngeneration.",

                    "value": "Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of acceleration techniques\nfor diffusion models, especially caching-based acceleration methods. These\nstudies seek to answer two fundamental questions: \"When to cache\" and \"How to\nuse cache\", typically relying on predefined empirical laws or dataset-level\npriors to determine the timing of caching and utilizing handcrafted rules for\nleveraging multi-step caches. However, given the highly dynamic nature of the\ndiffusion process, they often exhibit limited generalizability and fail on\noutlier samples. In this paper, a strong correlation is revealed between the\nvariation patterns of the shallow-layer feature differences in the diffusion\nmodel and those of final model outputs. Moreover, we have observed that the\nfeatures from different model layers form similar trajectories. Based on these\nobservations, we present DiCache, a novel training-free adaptive caching\nstrategy for accelerating diffusion models at runtime, answering both when and\nhow to cache within a unified framework. Specifically, DiCache is composed of\ntwo principal components: (1) Online Probe Profiling Scheme leverages a\nshallow-layer online probe to obtain a stable prior for the caching error in\nreal time, enabling the model to autonomously determine caching schedules. (2)\nDynamic Cache Trajectory Alignment combines multi-step caches based on\nshallow-layer probe feature trajectory to better approximate the current\nfeature, facilitating higher visual quality. Extensive experiments validate\nDiCache's capability in achieving higher efficiency and improved visual\nfidelity over state-of-the-art methods on various leading diffusion models\nincluding WAN 2.1, HunyuanVideo for video generation, and Flux for image\ngeneration."

We\nsuggest that SCI can lead to faster CARTRIDGE convergence than previously\ndemonstrated in the literature. Our findings lay the groundwork for broader\nempirical study of CARTRIDGE training optimization which may be crucial for\nfurther scaling."

First, SpecExtend\nintegrates efficient attention mechanisms such as FlashAttention and Hybrid\nTree Attention into both the draft and target models.

These models demonstrate the\nfeasibility of large-scale LLM development on non-NVIDIA platforms.\nSpikingBrain achieves performance comparable to open-source Transformer\nbaselines while using only about 150B tokens for continual pre-training. Our\nmodels significantly improve long-sequence training efficiency and deliver\ninference with (partially) constant memory and event-driven spiking behavior.\nFor example, SpikingBrain-7B attains over 100x speedup in Time to First Token\nfor 4M-token sequences. Training remains stable for weeks on hundreds of MetaX\nC550 GPUs, with the 7B model reaching a Model FLOPs Utilization of 23.4\npercent. The proposed spiking scheme achieves 69.15 percent sparsity, enabling\nlow-power operation.

These models demonstrate the\nfeasibility of large-scale LLM development on non-NVIDIA platforms.\nSpikingBrain achieves performance comparable to open-source Transformer\nbaselines while using only about 150B tokens for continual pre-training. Our\nmodels significantly improve long-sequence training efficiency and deliver\ninference with (partially) constant memory and event-driven spiking behavior.\nFor example, SpikingBrain-7B attains over 100x speedup in Time to First Token\nfor 4M-token sequences. Training remains stable for weeks on hundreds of MetaX\nC550 GPUs, with the 7B model reaching a Model FLOPs Utilization of 23.4\npercent. The proposed spiking scheme achieves 69.15 percent sparsity, enabling\nlow-power operation. Overall, this work demonstrates the potential of\nbrain-inspired mechanisms to drive the next generation of efficient and\nscalable large model design."

                "summary": "Deep learning (DL) is rapidly advancing neuroimaging by achieving\nstate-of-the-art performance with reduced computation times. Yet the numerical\nstability of DL models -- particularly during training -- remains\nunderexplored. While inference with DL is relatively stable, training\nintroduces additional variability primarily through iterative stochastic\noptimization. We investigate this training-time variability using FastSurfer, a\nCNN-based whole-brain segmentation pipeline. Controlled perturbations are\nintroduced via floating point perturbations and random seeds.

Yet the numerical\nstability of DL models -- particularly during training -- remains\nunderexplored. While inference with DL is relatively stable, training\nintroduces additional variability primarily through iterative stochastic\noptimization. We investigate this training-time variability using FastSurfer, a\nCNN-based whole-brain segmentation pipeline.

We study symbolic graphics programming, where\nthe goal is to generate an SGP from a natural-language description. This task\nalso serves as a lens into how LLMs understand the visual world by prompting\nthem to generate images rendered from SGPs. Among various SGPs, our paper\nsticks to scalable vector graphics (SVGs). We begin by examining the extent to\nwhich LLMs can generate SGPs. To this end, we introduce SGP-GenBench, a\ncomprehensive benchmark covering object fidelity, scene fidelity, and\ncompositionality (attribute binding, spatial relations, numeracy). On\nSGP-GenBench, we discover that frontier proprietary models substantially\noutperform open-source models, and performance correlates well with general\ncoding capabilities. Motivated by this gap, we aim to improve LLMs' ability to\ngenerate SGPs. We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rewards\napproach, where a format-validity gate ensures renderable SVG, and a\ncross-modal reward aligns text and the rendered image via strong vision\nencoders (e.g., SigLIP for text-image and DINO for image-image). Applied to\nQwen-2.5-7B, our method substantially improves SVG generation quality and\nsemantics, achieving performance on par with frontier systems. We further\nanalyze training dynamics, showing that RL induces (i) finer decomposition of\nobjects into controllable primitives and (ii) contextual details that improve\nscene coherence. Our results demonstrate that symbolic graphics programming\noffers a precise and interpretable lens on cross-modal grounding.",

To successfully handle these tasks, LLMs\nrequire longer training times and larger model sizes. This makes LLMs ideal\ncandidates for pruning methods that reduce computational demands while\nmaintaining performance. Previous methods require a retraining phase after\npruning to maintain the original model's performance. However, state-of-the-art\npruning methods, such as Wanda, prune the model without retraining, making the\npruning process faster and more efficient. Building upon Wanda's work, this\nstudy provides a theoretical explanation of why the method is effective and\nleverages these insights to enhance the pruning process. Specifically, a\ntheoretical analysis of the pruning problem reveals a common scenario in\nMachine Learning where Wanda is the optimal pruning method. Furthermore, this\nanalysis is extended to cases where Wanda is no longer optimal, leading to the\ndevelopment of a new method, STADE, based on the standard deviation of the\ninput. From a theoretical standpoint, STADE demonstrates better generality\nacross different scenarios. Finally, extensive experiments on Llama and Open\nPre-trained Transformers (OPT) models validate these theoretical findings,\nshowing that depending on the training conditions, Wanda's optimal performance\nvaries as predicted by the theoretical framework.

As a result, misinformation detectors need to be able to perform\nout-of-distribution generalization, an attribute they currently lack. Our\nbenchmark uses distant labelling to enable simulating covariate shifts in\nmisinformation content. We identify time, event, topic, publisher, political\nbias, misinformation type as important axes for generalization, and we evaluate\na common class of baseline models on each. Using article metadata, we show how\nthis model fails desiderata, which is not necessarily obvious from\nclassification metrics. Finally, we analyze properties of the data to ensure\nlimited presence of modelling shortcuts. We make the dataset and accompanying\ncode publicly available: https://github.com/ioverho/misinfo-general",

As a result, misinformation detectors need to be able to perform\nout-of-distribution generalization, an attribute they currently lack. Our\nbenchmark uses distant labelling to enable simulating covariate shifts in\nmisinformation content. We identify time, event, topic, publisher, political\nbias, misinformation type as important axes for generalization, and we evaluate\na common class of baseline models on each. Using article metadata, we show how\nthis model fails desiderata, which is not necessarily obvious from\nclassification metrics. Finally, we analyze properties of the data to ensure\nlimited presence of modelling shortcuts. We make the dataset and accompanying\ncode publicly available: https://github.com/ioverho/misinfo-general"

Extensive experiments on multi-modal datasets spanning stocks,\nfutures, and cryptocurrencies demonstrate that MM-DREX significantly\noutperforms 15 baselines (including state-of-the-art financial LLMs and deep\nreinforcement learning models) across key metrics: total return, Sharpe ratio,\nand maximum drawdown, validating its robustness and generalization.\nAdditionally, an interpretability module traces routing logic and expert\nbehavior in real time, providing an audit trail for strategy transparency.",

Realizing\nthis vision requires \\emph{Agent Ranking} -- selecting agents not only by\ndeclared capabilities but by proven, recent performance. Unlike Web~1.0's\nPageRank, a global, transparent network of agent interactions does not exist;\nusage signals are fragmented and private, making ranking infeasible without\ncoordination.\n  We propose \\textbf{DOVIS}, a five-layer operational protocol\n(\\emph{Discovery, Orchestration, Verification, Incentives, Semantics}) that\nenables the collection of minimal, privacy-preserving aggregates of usage and\nperformance across the ecosystem.

To mitigate spurious correlations - such as those from\nnon-residential nightlight sources that misrepresent poverty conditions - we\nincorporate a backdoor adjustment mechanism that leverages morphological traits\nduring training of the economic module. By fusing these complementary features\ninto a unified representation, our framework captures the complex nature of\npoverty, which often diverges from economic development trends.

To address the above issues, we propose\nSparkUI-Parser, a novel end-to-end framework where higher localization\nprecision and fine-grained parsing capability of the entire interface are\nsimultaneously achieved. Specifically, instead of using probability-based\ndiscrete modeling, we perform continuous modeling of coordinates based on a\npre-trained Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) with an additional token\nrouter and coordinate decoder.

To further enhance robustness, a rejection mechanism based on\na modified Hungarian matching algorithm is introduced, which empowers the model\nto identify and reject non-existent elements, thereby reducing false positives.\nMoreover, we present ScreenParse, a rigorously constructed benchmark to\nsystematically assess structural perception capabilities of GUI models across\ndiverse scenarios.

Existing studies primarily suffer from two\nlimitations: (1) A heavy reliance on scarce, high-quality long-form response\ndata for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or for pairwise preference reward in\nreinforcement learning (RL). (2) Focus on coarse-grained quality optimization\ndimensions, such as relevance, coherence, and helpfulness, overlooking the\nfine-grained specifics inherent to diverse long-form generation scenarios. To\naddress this issue, we propose a framework using Adaptive Constraint-Enhanced\nreward for long-form generation Reinforcement Learning (ACE-RL). ACE-RL first\nautomatically deconstructs each instruction into a set of fine-grained,\nadaptive constraint criteria by identifying its underlying intents and demands.\nSubsequently, we design a reward mechanism that quantifies the quality of\nlong-form responses based on their satisfaction over corresponding constraints,\nconverting subjective quality evaluation into constraint verification. Finally,\nwe utilize reinforcement learning to guide models toward superior long-form\ngeneration capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that our ACE-RL\nframework significantly outperforms existing SFT and RL baselines by 20.70% and\n7.32% on WritingBench, and our top-performing model even surpasses proprietary\nsystems like GPT-4o by 7.10%, providing a more effective training paradigm for\nLLMs to generate high-quality content across diverse long-form generation\nscenarios.",

HyperAgent features four specialized agents-Planner, Navigator,\nCode Editor, and Executor-capable of handling the entire lifecycle of SE tasks,\nfrom initial planning to final verification. HyperAgent sets new benchmarks in\ndiverse SE tasks, including GitHub issue resolution on the renowned SWE-Bench\nbenchmark, outperforming robust baselines.

Despite recent\nadvancements that have enabled the creation of autonomous software agents\nutilizing LLMs for end-to-end development tasks, these systems are typically\ndesigned for specific SE functions. We introduce HyperAgent, an innovative\ngeneralist multi-agent system designed to tackle a wide range of SE tasks\nacross different programming languages by mimicking the workflows of human\ndevelopers. HyperAgent features four specialized agents-Planner, Navigator,\nCode Editor, and Executor-capable of handling the entire lifecycle of SE tasks,\nfrom initial planning to final verification. HyperAgent sets new benchmarks in\ndiverse SE tasks, including GitHub issue resolution on the renowned SWE-Bench\nbenchmark, outperforming robust baselines. Furthermore, HyperAgent demonstrates\nexceptional performance in repository-level code generation (RepoExec) and\nfault localization and program repair (Defects4J), often surpassing\nstate-of-the-art baselines."

We address this challenge by leveraging Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) to translate code changes from well-resourced languages\ninto equivalent changes in underrepresented or emerging languages, generating\nsynthetic training data where labelled examples are scarce. We assume that\nalthough LLMs have learned the syntax and semantics of new languages from\navailable unlabelled code, they have yet to fully grasp which code changes are\nconsidered significant or review-worthy within these emerging ecosystems. To\novercome this, we use LLMs to generate synthetic change examples and train\nsupervised classifiers on them. We systematically compare the performance of\nthese classifiers against models trained on real labelled data. Our experiments\nacross multiple GitHub repositories and language pairs demonstrate that\nLLM-generated synthetic data can effectively bootstrap review recommendation\nsystems, narrowing the performance gap even in low-resource settings. This\napproach provides a scalable pathway to extend automated code review\ncapabilities to rapidly evolving technology stacks, even in the absence of\nannotated data.",

We address this challenge by leveraging Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) to translate code changes from well-resourced languages\ninto equivalent changes in underrepresented or emerging languages, generating\nsynthetic training data where labelled examples are scarce. We assume that\nalthough LLMs have learned the syntax and semantics of new languages from\navailable unlabelled code, they have yet to fully grasp which code changes are\nconsidered significant or review-worthy within these emerging ecosystems. To\novercome this, we use LLMs to generate synthetic change examples and train\nsupervised classifiers on them. We systematically compare the performance of\nthese classifiers against models trained on real labelled data. Our experiments\nacross multiple GitHub repositories and language pairs demonstrate that\nLLM-generated synthetic data can effectively bootstrap review recommendation\nsystems, narrowing the performance gap even in low-resource settings. This\napproach provides a scalable pathway to extend automated code review\ncapabilities to rapidly evolving technology stacks, even in the absence of\nannotated data."

World models have found broad\napplications across various domains, including embodied AI, autonomous driving,\nentertainment, etc. A more realistic simulation with accurate physics will\neffectively narrow the sim-to-real gap and allow us to gather rich information\nabout the real world conveniently. While traditional manual modeling has\nenabled the creation of virtual 3D scenes, modern approaches have leveraged\nadvanced machine learning algorithms for 3D world generation, with most recent\nadvances focusing on generative methods that can create virtual worlds based on\nuser instructions. This work explores such a research direction by proposing\nLatticeWorld, a simple yet effective 3D world generation framework that\nstreamlines the industrial production pipeline of 3D environments. LatticeWorld\nleverages lightweight LLMs (LLaMA-2-7B) alongside the industry-grade rendering\nengine (e.g., Unreal Engine 5) to generate a dynamic environment. Our proposed\nframework accepts textual descriptions and visual instructions as multimodal\ninputs and creates large-scale 3D interactive worlds with dynamic agents,\nfeaturing competitive multi-agent interaction, high-fidelity physics\nsimulation, and real-time rendering. We conduct comprehensive experiments to\nevaluate LatticeWorld, showing that it achieves superior accuracy in scene\nlayout generation and visual fidelity. Moreover, LatticeWorld achieves over a\n$90\\times$ increase in industrial production efficiency while maintaining high\ncreative quality compared with traditional manual production methods.

We perform a human evaluation to examine the\nhelpfulness of such agents and find that some large audio-language models have\nthe emergent ability to perform overhearing agent tasks using implicit audio\ncues. Finally, we release Python libraries and our project code to support\nfurther research into the overhearing agents paradigm at\nhttps://github.com/zhudotexe/overhearing_agents."

This critical\nproblem is often tackled using sampling-based planners (SBPs) that explore the\nrobot's high-dimensional state space by constructing a search tree via action\npropagations. Although SBPs can offer global guarantees on completeness and\nsolution quality, their performance is often hindered by slow exploration due\nto uninformed action sampling. Learning-based approaches can yield\nsignificantly faster runtimes, yet they fail to generalize to\nout-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios and lack critical guarantees, e.g., safety,\nthus limiting their deployment on physical robots. We present Diffusion Tree\n(DiTree): a provably-generalizable framework leveraging diffusion policies\n(DPs) as informed samplers to efficiently guide state-space search within SBPs.\nDiTree combines DP's ability to model complex distributions of expert\ntrajectories, conditioned on local observations, with the completeness of SBPs\nto yield provably-safe solutions within a few action propagation iterations for\ncomplex dynamical systems. We demonstrate DiTree's power with an implementation\ncombining the popular RRT planner with a DP action sampler trained on a single\nenvironment.

Traditional methods relying on fixed structures and unimodal\ndata struggle to adapt to market regime shifts, while large language model\n(LLM)-driven solutions - despite their multi-modal comprehension - suffer from\nstatic strategies and homogeneous expert designs, lacking dynamic adjustment\nand fine-grained decision mechanisms. To address these limitations, we propose\nMM-DREX: a Multimodal-driven, Dynamically-Routed EXpert framework based on\nlarge language models. MM-DREX explicitly decouples market state perception\nfrom strategy execution to enable adaptive sequential decision-making in\nnon-stationary environments. Specifically, it (1) introduces a vision-language\nmodel (VLM)-powered dynamic router that jointly analyzes candlestick chart\npatterns and long-term temporal features to allocate real-time expert weights;\n(2) designs four heterogeneous trading experts (trend, reversal, breakout,\npositioning) generating specialized fine-grained sub-strategies; and (3)\nproposes an SFT-RL hybrid training paradigm to synergistically optimize the\nrouter's market classification capability and experts' risk-adjusted\ndecision-making. Extensive experiments on multi-modal datasets spanning stocks,\nfutures, and cryptocurrencies demonstrate that MM-DREX significantly\noutperforms 15 baselines (including state-of-the-art financial LLMs and deep\nreinforcement learning models) across key metrics: total return, Sharpe ratio,\nand maximum drawdown, validating its robustness and generalization.\nAdditionally, an interpretability module traces routing logic and expert\nbehavior in real time, providing an audit trail for strategy transparency.",

To address these limitations, we propose\nMM-DREX: a Multimodal-driven, Dynamically-Routed EXpert framework based on\nlarge language models. MM-DREX explicitly decouples market state perception\nfrom strategy execution to enable adaptive sequential decision-making in\nnon-stationary environments. Specifically, it (1) introduces a vision-language\nmodel (VLM)-powered dynamic router that jointly analyzes candlestick chart\npatterns and long-term temporal features to allocate real-time expert weights;\n(2) designs four heterogeneous trading experts (trend, reversal, breakout,\npositioning) generating specialized fine-grained sub-strategies; and (3)\nproposes an SFT-RL hybrid training paradigm to synergistically optimize the\nrouter's market classification capability and experts' risk-adjusted\ndecision-making. Extensive experiments on multi-modal datasets spanning stocks,\nfutures, and cryptocurrencies demonstrate that MM-DREX significantly\noutperforms 15 baselines (including state-of-the-art financial LLMs and deep\nreinforcement learning models) across key metrics: total return, Sharpe ratio,\nand maximum drawdown, validating its robustness and generalization.\nAdditionally, an interpretability module traces routing logic and expert\nbehavior in real time, providing an audit trail for strategy transparency."

The International\nClassification of Diseases - 10th revision (ICD-10) is an international\nstandard for classifying diseases for statistical and insurance purposes.\nAutomatically assigning the correct ICD-10 code to terms in discharge summaries\nwill simplify the work of healthcare professionals and ensure consistent coding\nin hospitals. Our paper proposes an approach for linking clinical terms to\nICD-10 codes in different languages using Large Language Models (LLMs). The\napproach consists of a multistage pipeline that uses clinical dictionaries to\nmatch unambiguous terms in the text and then applies in-context learning with\nGPT-4.1 to predict the ICD-10 code for the terms that do not match the\ndictionary. Our system shows promising results in predicting ICD-10 codes on\ndifferent benchmark datasets in Spanish - 0.89 F1 for categories and 0.78 F1 on\nsubcategories on CodiEsp, and Greek - 0.85 F1 on ElCardioCC."

Building on these insights, we propose a fronthaul\ncompression strategy tailored to cell-free architectures. The design targets\nhigh compression with controlled performance loss, supports RB-level rate\nadaptation, and enables low-latency inference suitable for centralized\ncooperative transmission in next-generation networks."

In particular, we consider two cases when the IRSs'\nreflective beamforming optimization can be implemented dynamically in real time\nand quasi-stationarily over the whole operation period, respectively. For both\ncases, the joint IRS deployment and transmit/reflective beamforming designs are\nformulated as mixed-integer non-convex optimization problems, which are solved\nvia the successive convex approximation (SCA)-based relax-and-bound method.\nSpecifically, we first relax the binary IRS deployment indicators into\ncontinuous variables, then find converged solutions via SCA, and finally round\nrelaxed indicators back to binary values.
