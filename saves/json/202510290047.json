Instead of treating each\nquery independently, Proximity reuses previously retrieved documents when\nsimilar queries appear, substantially reducing the reliance on expensive vector\ndatabase lookups. To efficiently scale, Proximity employs a locality-sensitive\nhashing (LSH) scheme that enables fast cache lookups while preserving retrieval\naccuracy. We evaluate Proximity using the MMLU and MedRAG question-answering\nbenchmarks.

We experiment with different\nsimilarity tolerances and cache capacities, and show that the time spent within\nthe Proximity cache remains low and constant (4.8 microseconds) even as the\ncache grows substantially in size.

Our model processes\nindividual frames of a Variable-$Q$ Transform (VQT) and predicts pitch\ndistributions. The neural network is designed to be equivariant to\ntranslations, notably thanks to a Toeplitz fully-connected layer.

To address this,\nrecent research has focused on off-chip memory controllers that facilitate\naccess to diverse memory media, each with unique density and latency\ncharacteristics. While these solutions improve memory system performance, they\nalso exacerbate the already significant memory latency. As a result,\nmulti-level prefetching techniques are essential to mitigate these extended\nlatencies.\n  This paper investigates the advantages of prefetching across both sides of\nthe memory system: the off-chip memory and the on-chip cache hierarchy. Our\nprimary objective is to assess the impact of a multi-level prefetching engine\non overall system performance. Additionally, we analyze the individual\ncontribution of each prefetching level to system efficiency. To achieve this,\nthe study evaluates two key prefetching approaches: HMC (Hybrid Memory\nController) and HMC+L1, both of which employ prefetching mechanisms commonly\nused by processor vendors. The HMC approach integrates a prefetcher within the\noff-chip hybrid memory controller, while the HMC+L1 approach combines this with\nadditional L1 on-chip prefetchers.\n  Experimental results on an out-of-order execution processor show that on-chip\ncache prefetchers are crucial for maximizing the benefits of off-chip\nprefetching, which in turn further enhances performance. Specifically, the\noff-chip HMC prefetcher achieves coverage and accuracy rates exceeding 60% and\nup to 80%, while the combined HMC+L1 approach boosts off-chip prefetcher\ncoverage to as much as 92%. Consequently, overall performance increases from 9%\nwith the HMC approach to 12% when L1 prefetching is also employed.",

However, their inherent\n\\textit{multi-step iterations} and \\textit{complex backbone networks} lead to\nprohibitive computational overhead and generation latency, forming a major\nbottleneck for real-time applications. Although existing acceleration\ntechniques have made progress, they still face challenges such as limited\napplicability, high training costs, or quality degradation.\n  Against this backdrop, \\textbf{Diffusion Caching} offers a promising\ntraining-free, architecture-agnostic, and efficient inference paradigm. Its\ncore mechanism identifies and reuses intrinsic computational redundancies in\nthe diffusion process. By enabling feature-level cross-step reuse and\ninter-layer scheduling, it reduces computation without modifying model\nparameters. This paper systematically reviews the theoretical foundations and\nevolution of Diffusion Caching and proposes a unified framework for its\nclassification and analysis.\n  Through comparative analysis of representative methods, we show that\nDiffusion Caching evolves from \\textit{static reuse} to \\textit{dynamic\nprediction}. This trend enhances caching flexibility across diverse tasks and\nenables integration with other acceleration techniques such as sampling\noptimization and model distillation, paving the way for a unified, efficient\ninference framework for future multimodal and interactive applications. We\nargue that this paradigm will become a key enabler of real-time and efficient\ngenerative AI, injecting new vitality into both theory and practice of\n\\textit{Efficient Generative Intelligence}.",

However, their inherent\n\\textit{multi-step iterations} and \\textit{complex backbone networks} lead to\nprohibitive computational overhead and generation latency, forming a major\nbottleneck for real-time applications. Although existing acceleration\ntechniques have made progress, they still face challenges such as limited\napplicability, high training costs, or quality degradation.\n  Against this backdrop, \\textbf{Diffusion Caching} offers a promising\ntraining-free, architecture-agnostic, and efficient inference paradigm. Its\ncore mechanism identifies and reuses intrinsic computational redundancies in\nthe diffusion process. By enabling feature-level cross-step reuse and\ninter-layer scheduling, it reduces computation without modifying model\nparameters. This paper systematically reviews the theoretical foundations and\nevolution of Diffusion Caching and proposes a unified framework for its\nclassification and analysis.\n  Through comparative analysis of representative methods, we show that\nDiffusion Caching evolves from \\textit{static reuse} to \\textit{dynamic\nprediction}. This trend enhances caching flexibility across diverse tasks and\nenables integration with other acceleration techniques such as sampling\noptimization and model distillation, paving the way for a unified, efficient\ninference framework for future multimodal and interactive applications. We\nargue that this paradigm will become a key enabler of real-time and efficient\ngenerative AI, injecting new vitality into both theory and practice of\n\\textit{Efficient Generative Intelligence}."

Skip connections offer a promising way to improve representation\nwithout bloating resource usage, yet most prior works either improve\nexpressivity while leaving KV costs unchanged, or reduce memory at the cost of\nweaker representation. In this work, we propose SkipV1Former, a Transformer\nvariant that uses skip connections from the first layer's Value heads to\nstrengthen model representation and reduce KV cache.

We envision a future where\nInternet communication will be dominated by \"prompts\" sent to generative AI\nmodels. For this, we will need proxies that provide similar functions to HTTP\nproxies (e.g., caching, routing, compression) while dealing with unique\nchallenges and opportunities of prompt-based communication. As a first step\ntoward supporting prompt-based communication, we present LLMBridge, an LLM\nproxy designed for cost-conscious users, such as those in developing regions\nand education (e.g., students, instructors). LLMBridge supports three key\noptimizations: model selection (routing prompts to the most suitable model),\ncontext management (intelligently reducing the amount of context), and semantic\ncaching (serving prompts using local models and vector databases). These\noptimizations introduce trade-offs between cost and quality, which applications\nnavigate through a high-level, bidirectional interface. As case studies, we\ndeploy LLMBridge in two cost-sensitive settings: a WhatsApp-based Q&A service\nand a university classroom environment. The WhatsApp service has been live for\nover twelve months, serving 100+ users and handling more than 14.7K requests.\nIn parallel, we exposed LLMBridge to students across three computer science\ncourses over a semester, where it supported diverse LLM-powered applications -\nsuch as reasoning agents and chatbots - and handled an average of 500 requests\nper day. We report on deployment experiences across both settings and use the\ncollected workloads to benchmark the effectiveness of various cost-optimization\nstrategies, analyzing their trade-offs in cost, latency, and response quality.",

However, the serving performance and behavior of RLLM remains\nunexplored, which may undermine the deployment and utilization of RLLM in\nreal-world scenario. To close this gap, in this paper, we conduct a\ncomprehensive study of RLLM service.

Our findings\nunderscore the necessity of robust evaluation methods and improved acceleration\nstrategies to advance research on DLMs."

We evaluate StreamingThinker on the Qwen3 model family across\nmath reasoning, logical reasoning, and context-based QA reasoning tasks.\nExperimental results show that the StreamingThinker preserves performance\ncomparable to batch thinking, while yielding an 80\\% reduction in token waiting\nbefore the onset of reasoning and a more than 60\\% reduction in time-level\nlatency for producing the final answer, demonstrating the effectiveness of the\nstreaming paradigm for LLM reasoning.

Nevertheless,\nminimizing the accuracy degradation caused by ultra-low-bit KV cache\nquantization remains a significant challenge. While scalar quantization is\nconstrained by 1-bit bound, vector quantization exploits intra-vector\ncorrelations and enables sub-bit regimes, making it more suitable for\nultra-low-bit quantization. To further mitigate quantization-induced\ndegradation, we reveal that the degradation is highly uneven across tokens in\nattention quality. To investigate this unevenness, we introduce anchor score to\nmeasure each token's sensitivity to quantization. Our analysis and experiments\nshow that preserving a small subset (1\\%) of tokens with the highest Anchor\nScore significantly mitigates accuracy loss under aggressive quantization.\n  We propose AnTKV, a dual-stage framework that leverages anchor token-aware\nvector quantization to compress the KV cache. It combines offline token-aware\ncentroids learning and online anchor token selection to balance compression and\naccuracy. To enable efficient deployment, we design an online anchor token\nselection kernel compatible with FlashAttention. It allows LLaMA3-8B to scale\nto 840K tokens on a single 80GB A100, while delivering up to $3.5\\times$ higher\ndecoding throughput over the FP16 baseline. Experiments demonstrate that AnTKV\nmatches or surpasses prior methods at 4-bit, and significantly reduce\nperplexity under ultra-low-bit quantization, achieving 6.32 at 1-bit on\nMistral-7B, compared to 7.25 for CQ and 15.36 for KVQuant.",

Current context compression methods predominantly rely on\nautoencoding tasks to train context-agnostic compression tokens to compress\ncontextual semantics. While autoencoding tasks enable compression tokens to\nacquire compression capabilities, compression via autoencoding tasks creates a\nfundamental mismatch: the models are optimized for reconstruction that diverge\nfrom actual downstream tasks, thereby weakening the features more beneficial\nfor real-world usage. We propose Semantic-Anchor Compression (SAC), a novel\nmethod that shifts from autoencoding task based compression to an architecture\nthat is equipped with this compression capability \\textit{a priori}. Instead of\ntraining models to compress contexts through autoencoding tasks, SAC directly\nselects so-called anchor tokens from the original context and aggregates\ncontextual information into their key-value (KV) representations. By deriving\nrepresentations directly from the contextual tokens, SAC eliminates the need\nfor autoencoding training. To ensure compression performance while directly\nleveraging anchor tokens, SAC incorporates two key designs: (1) anchor\nembeddings that enable the compressor to identify critical tokens, and (2)\nbidirectional attention modification that allows anchor tokens to capture\ninformation from the entire context. Experimental results demonstrate that SAC\nconsistently outperforms existing context compression methods across various\ncompression ratios.

                "summary": "Recently, large vision-language models (LVLMs) have rapidly gained popularity\nfor their strong generation and reasoning capabilities given diverse multimodal\ninputs. However, these models incur significant computational and memory\noverhead during inference, which greatly hinders the efficient deployment in\npractical scenarios. The extensive key-value (KV) cache, necessitated by the\nlengthy input and output sequences, notably contributes to the high inference\ncost. Based on this, recent works have investigated ways to reduce the KV cache\nsize for higher efficiency. Although effective, they generally overlook the\ndistinct importance distributions of KV vectors across layers and maintain the\nsame cache size for each layer during the next token prediction. This results\nin the significant contextual information loss for certain layers, leading to\nnotable performance decline. To address this, we present PrefixKV, where\n\"Prefix\" means the top-ranked KV based on importance rather than position in\nthe original sequence. It reframes the challenge of determining KV cache sizes\nfor all layers into the task of searching for the optimal global prefix\nconfiguration. With an adaptive layer-wise KV retention recipe based on binary\nsearch, the maximum contextual information can thus be preserved in each layer,\nfacilitating the generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method\nachieves the state-of-the-art performance compared with others. It exhibits\nsuperior inference efficiency and generation quality trade-offs, showing\npromising potential for practical applications. Code is available at\nhttps://github.com/THU-MIG/PrefixKV.",

                    "value": "Recently, large vision-language models (LVLMs) have rapidly gained popularity\nfor their strong generation and reasoning capabilities given diverse multimodal\ninputs. However, these models incur significant computational and memory\noverhead during inference, which greatly hinders the efficient deployment in\npractical scenarios. The extensive key-value (KV) cache, necessitated by the\nlengthy input and output sequences, notably contributes to the high inference\ncost. Based on this, recent works have investigated ways to reduce the KV cache\nsize for higher efficiency. Although effective, they generally overlook the\ndistinct importance distributions of KV vectors across layers and maintain the\nsame cache size for each layer during the next token prediction. This results\nin the significant contextual information loss for certain layers, leading to\nnotable performance decline. To address this, we present PrefixKV, where\n\"Prefix\" means the top-ranked KV based on importance rather than position in\nthe original sequence. It reframes the challenge of determining KV cache sizes\nfor all layers into the task of searching for the optimal global prefix\nconfiguration. With an adaptive layer-wise KV retention recipe based on binary\nsearch, the maximum contextual information can thus be preserved in each layer,\nfacilitating the generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method\nachieves the state-of-the-art performance compared with others. It exhibits\nsuperior inference efficiency and generation quality trade-offs, showing\npromising potential for practical applications. Code is available at\nhttps://github.com/THU-MIG/PrefixKV."

In contrast to the\nstate-of-the-art matrix multiply based MTTKRP kernels used by Tensor Toolbox,\nTensorLy, etc., that explicitly form Khatri-Rao matrices, we develop a\nmatrix-free element-wise parallelization approach whose memory cost grows with\nthe rank R like the sum of the tensor shape O(R(n+m+k)), compared to\nmatrix-based methods whose memory cost grows like the product of the tensor\nshape O(R(mnk)). For the largest problem we study, a rank 2000 MTTKRP, the\nsmaller growth rate yields a matrix-free memory cost of just 2% of the\nmatrix-based methods, a 50x improvement.

In contrast to the\nstate-of-the-art matrix multiply based MTTKRP kernels used by Tensor Toolbox,\nTensorLy, etc., that explicitly form Khatri-Rao matrices, we develop a\nmatrix-free element-wise parallelization approach whose memory cost grows with\nthe rank R like the sum of the tensor shape O(R(n+m+k)), compared to\nmatrix-based methods whose memory cost grows like the product of the tensor\nshape O(R(mnk)).

We propose a new formulation of\nLLM unlearning as a constrained optimization problem: forgetting is enforced\nvia a novel logit-margin flattening loss that explicitly drives the output\ndistribution toward uniformity on a designated forget set, while retention is\npreserved through a hard constraint on a separate retain set. Compared to\nentropy-based objectives, our loss is softmax-free, numerically stable, and\nmaintains non-vanishing gradients, enabling more efficient and robust\noptimization. We solve the constrained problem using a scalable primal-dual\nalgorithm that exposes the trade-off between forgetting and retention through\nthe dynamics of the dual variable, all without any extra computational\noverhead. Evaluations on the TOFU and MUSE benchmarks across diverse LLM\narchitectures demonstrate that our approach consistently matches or exceeds\nstate-of-the-art baselines, effectively removing targeted information while\npreserving downstream utility.",

                    "value": "Large Language Models (LLMs) deployed in real-world settings increasingly\nface the need to unlearn sensitive, outdated, or proprietary information.\nExisting unlearning methods typically formulate forgetting and retention as a\nregularized trade-off, combining both objectives into a single scalarized loss.\nThis often leads to unstable optimization and degraded performance on retained\ndata, especially under aggressive forgetting. We propose a new formulation of\nLLM unlearning as a constrained optimization problem: forgetting is enforced\nvia a novel logit-margin flattening loss that explicitly drives the output\ndistribution toward uniformity on a designated forget set, while retention is\npreserved through a hard constraint on a separate retain set. Compared to\nentropy-based objectives, our loss is softmax-free, numerically stable, and\nmaintains non-vanishing gradients, enabling more efficient and robust\noptimization. We solve the constrained problem using a scalable primal-dual\nalgorithm that exposes the trade-off between forgetting and retention through\nthe dynamics of the dual variable, all without any extra computational\noverhead. Evaluations on the TOFU and MUSE benchmarks across diverse LLM\narchitectures demonstrate that our approach consistently matches or exceeds\nstate-of-the-art baselines, effectively removing targeted information while\npreserving downstream utility."

To\novercome this challenge, we propose ESCA, a framework that contextualizes\nembodied agents by grounding their perception in spatial-temporal scene graphs.\nAt its core is SGCLIP, a novel, open-domain, promptable foundation model for\ngenerating scene graphs that is based on CLIP.

ESCA with SGCLIP improves perception for embodied agents based on\nboth open-source and commercial MLLMs, achieving state of-the-art performance\nacross two embodied environments.

To address these issues, we evaluate three realignment\ndefenses: SafeInstruct, SafeLoRA, SafeMERGE. We show that, across all settings,\nthe proposed defenses can effectively restore safety without compromising\ntelecom task performance, leading to Safe teleCOMMunication (SafeCOMM) models.\nOur work serves as both a diagnostic study and practical guide for safety\nrealignment in telecom-tuned LLMs, underscoring the need for safety-aware\ninstruction and fine-tuning in the telecom domain.",

In this work, we focus on estimating plant root parameters in the\nRichards equation, which is essential for understanding the soil-plant system\nin agricultural studies. Since conventional methods are computationally\nintensive and often yield unstable estimates, we develop a new Gaussian process\ncollocation method for efficient Bayesian inference. Unlike existing Gaussian\nprocess-based approaches, our method constructs an approximate posterior\ndistribution using samples drawn from a Gaussian process model fitted to the\nobserved data, which does not require any structural assumption about the\nunderlying PDE. Further, we propose to use an importance sampling procedure to\ncorrect for the discrepancy between the approximate and true posterior\ndistributions. As an alternative, we also devise a prior-guided Bayesian\noptimization algorithm leveraging the approximate posterior. Simulation studies\ndemonstrate that our method yields robust estimates under various settings.\nFinally, we apply our method on a real agricultural data set and estimate the\nplant root parameters with uncertainty quantification.",

In this work, we focus on estimating plant root parameters in the\nRichards equation, which is essential for understanding the soil-plant system\nin agricultural studies. Since conventional methods are computationally\nintensive and often yield unstable estimates, we develop a new Gaussian process\ncollocation method for efficient Bayesian inference. Unlike existing Gaussian\nprocess-based approaches, our method constructs an approximate posterior\ndistribution using samples drawn from a Gaussian process model fitted to the\nobserved data, which does not require any structural assumption about the\nunderlying PDE. Further, we propose to use an importance sampling procedure to\ncorrect for the discrepancy between the approximate and true posterior\ndistributions. As an alternative, we also devise a prior-guided Bayesian\noptimization algorithm leveraging the approximate posterior. Simulation studies\ndemonstrate that our method yields robust estimates under various settings.\nFinally, we apply our method on a real agricultural data set and estimate the\nplant root parameters with uncertainty quantification."

In this work, we introduce NaviWM, a\nsocially-aware robot Navigation World Model that augments LLM reasoning with a\nstructured world model and a logic-driven chain-of-thought process. NaviWM\nconsists of two main components: (1) a spatial-temporal world model that\ncaptures the positions, velocities, and activities of agents in the\nenvironment, and (2) a deductive reasoning module that guides LLMs through a\nmulti-step, logic-based inference process. This integration enables the robot\nto generate navigation decisions that are both socially compliant and\nphysically safe, under well-defined constraints such as personal space,\ncollision avoidance, and timing. Unlike previous methods based on prompting or\nfine-tuning, NaviWM encodes social norms as first-order logic, enabling\ninterpretable and verifiable reasoning. Experiments show that NaviWM improves\nsuccess rates and reduces social violations, particularly in crowded\nenvironments. These results demonstrate the benefit of combining formal\nreasoning with LLMs for robust social navigation.

In this paper, we first have three\nhematology-oncology physicians evaluate cancer-related questions drawn from\nreal patients. While LLM responses are generally accurate, the models\nfrequently fail to recognize or address false presuppositions in the questions,\nposing risks to safe medical decision-making. To study this limitation\nsystematically, we introduce Cancer-Myth, an expert-verified adversarial\ndataset of 585 cancer-related questions with false presuppositions. On this\nbenchmark, no frontier LLM -- including GPT-5, Gemini-2.5-Pro, and\nClaude-4-Sonnet -- corrects these false presuppositions more than $43\\%$ of the\ntime. To study mitigation strategies, we further construct a 150-question\nCancer-Myth-NFP set, in which physicians confirm the absence of false\npresuppositions. We find typical mitigation strategies, such as adding\nprecautionary prompts with GEPA optimization, can raise accuracy on Cancer-Myth\nto $80\\%$, but at the cost of misidentifying presuppositions in $41\\%$ of\nCancer-Myth-NFP questions and causing a $10\\%$ relative performance drop on\nother medical benchmarks. These findings highlight a critical gap in the\nreliability of LLMs, show that prompting alone is not a reliable remedy for\nfalse presuppositions, and underscore the need for more robust safeguards in\nmedical AI systems.",

By allowing TSSR to \"see\" all\nmesh tokens concurrently, we unlock a new level of efficiency and control. We\nleverage this parallel generation capability through three key innovations: 1)\nDecoupled Training and Hybrid Inference, which distinctly separates the\nDDM-based generation into a topology sculpting stage and a subsequent shape\nrefinement stage. This strategic decoupling enables TSSR to effectively capture\nboth intricate local topology and overarching global shape. 2) An Improved\nHourglass Architecture, featuring bidirectional attention enriched by\nface-vertex-sequence level Rotational Positional Embeddings (RoPE), thereby\ncapturing richer contextual information across the mesh structure. 3) A novel\nConnection Loss, which acts as a topological constraint to further enhance the\nrealism and fidelity of the generated meshes. Extensive experiments on complex\ndatasets demonstrate that TSSR generates high-quality 3D artist-style meshes,\ncapable of achieving up to 10,000 faces at a remarkable spatial resolution of\n$1024^3$.

In this paper, we investigate the problem of collaborative inference\nin wireless edge networks, where energy-constrained edge devices aim to\ncomplete inference tasks within given deadlines. These tasks are carried out\nusing neural networks, and the edge device seeks to optimize inference\nperformance under energy and delay constraints. The inference process can be\nsplit between the edge device and an edge server, thereby achieving\ncollaborative inference over wireless networks. We formulate an inference\nutility optimization problem subject to energy and delay constraints, and\npropose a novel solution called Bayes-Split-Edge, which leverages Bayesian\noptimization for collaborative split inference over wireless edge networks. Our\nsolution jointly optimizes the transmission power and the neural network split\npoint. The Bayes-Split-Edge framework incorporates a novel hybrid acquisition\nfunction that balances inference task utility, sample efficiency, and\nconstraint violation penalties. We evaluate our approach using the VGG19 model\non the ImageNet-Mini dataset, and Resnet101 on Tiny-ImageNet, and real-world\nmMobile wireless channel datasets. Numerical results demonstrate that\nBayes-Split-Edge achieves up to 2.4x reduction in evaluation cost compared to\nstandard Bayesian optimization and achieves near-linear convergence. It also\noutperforms several baselines, including CMA-ES, DIRECT, exhaustive search, and\nProximal Policy Optimization (PPO), while matching exhaustive search\nperformance under tight constraints.

For many items, however,\nrating criteria may admit multiple valid interpretations, so a human or LLM\nrater may deem multiple ratings \"reasonable\" or \"correct.\" We call this\ncondition rating indeterminacy. Problematically, many rating tasks that contain\nrating indeterminacy rely on forced-choice elicitation, whereby raters are\ninstructed to select only one rating for each item. In this paper, we introduce\na framework for validating LLM-as-a-judge systems under rating indeterminacy.\nWe draw theoretical connections between different measures of judge system\nperformance under different human--judge agreement metrics, and different\nrating elicitation and aggregation schemes. We demonstrate that differences in\nhow humans and LLMs resolve rating indeterminacy when responding to\nforced-choice rating instructions can heavily bias LLM-as-a-judge validation.\nThrough extensive experiments involving 11 real-world rating tasks and 9\ncommercial LLMs, we show that standard validation approaches that rely upon\nforced-choice ratings select judge systems that are highly suboptimal,\nperforming as much as 31% worse than judge systems selected by our approach\nthat uses multi-label \"response set\" ratings to account for rating\nindeterminacy.

NPE-PFN provides a new direction\nfor SBI, where training-free, general-purpose inference models offer efficient,\neasy-to-use, and flexible solutions for a wide range of stochastic inverse\nproblems."

Our training strategy begins with\nSupervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to learn the reasoning format, followed by Group\nRelative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to strengthen this reasoning capability.\nThrough this approach, Video-Thinker enables MLLMs to autonomously navigate\ngrounding and captioning tasks for video reasoning, eliminating the need for\nconstructing and calling external tools. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nVideo-Thinker achieves significant performance gains on both in-domain tasks\nand challenging out-of-domain video reasoning benchmarks, including\nVideo-Holmes, CG-Bench-Reasoning, and VRBench.

In this work, we propose the Detect Any Sound Model (DASM), a\nquery-based framework for open-vocabulary SED guided by multi-modal queries.\nDASM formulates SED as a frame-level retrieval task, where audio features are\nmatched against query vectors derived from text or audio prompts. To support\nthis formulation, DASM introduces a dual-stream decoder that explicitly\ndecouples event recognition and temporal localization: a cross-modality event\ndecoder performs query-feature fusion and determines the presence of sound\nevents at the clip-level, while a context network models temporal dependencies\nfor frame-level localization. Additionally, an inference-time attention masking\nstrategy is proposed to leverage semantic relations between base and novel\nclasses, substantially enhancing generalization to novel classes. Experiments\non the AudioSet Strong dataset demonstrate that DASM effectively balances\nlocalization accuracy with generalization to novel classes, outperforming\nCLAP-based methods in open-vocabulary setting (+ 7.8 PSDS) and the baseline in\nthe closed-set setting (+ 6.9 PSDS). Furthermore, in cross-dataset zero-shot\nevaluation on DESED, DASM achieves a PSDS1 score of 42.2, even exceeding the\nsupervised CRNN baseline.

                "summary": "Expensive optimization problems (EOPs) present significant challenges for\ntraditional evolutionary optimization due to their limited evaluation calls.\nAlthough surrogate-assisted search (SAS) has become a popular paradigm for\naddressing EOPs, it still suffers from the cold-start issue. In response to\nthis challenge, knowledge transfer has been gaining popularity for its ability\nto leverage search experience from potentially related instances, ultimately\nfacilitating head-start optimization for more efficient decision-making.\nHowever, the curse of negative transfer persists when applying knowledge\ntransfer to EOPs, primarily due to the inherent limitations of existing methods\nin assessing knowledge transferability. On the one hand, a priori\ntransferability assessment criteria are intrinsically inaccurate due to their\nimprecise understandings. On the other hand, a posteriori methods often\nnecessitate sufficient observations to make correct inferences, rendering them\ninefficient when applied to EOPs. Considering the above, this paper introduces\na Bayesian competitive knowledge transfer (BCKT) method developed to improve\nmulti-task SAS (MSAS) when addressing multiple EOPs simultaneously.\nSpecifically, the transferability of knowledge is estimated from a Bayesian\nperspective that accommodates both prior beliefs and empirical evidence,\nenabling accurate competition between inner-task and inter-task solutions,\nultimately leading to the adaptive use of promising solutions while effectively\nsuppressing inferior ones. The effectiveness of our method in boosting various\nSAS algorithms for both multi-task and many-task problems is empirically\nvalidated, complemented by comparative studies that demonstrate its superiority\nover peer algorithms and its applicability to real-world scenarios.

                    "value": "Expensive optimization problems (EOPs) present significant challenges for\ntraditional evolutionary optimization due to their limited evaluation calls.\nAlthough surrogate-assisted search (SAS) has become a popular paradigm for\naddressing EOPs, it still suffers from the cold-start issue. In response to\nthis challenge, knowledge transfer has been gaining popularity for its ability\nto leverage search experience from potentially related instances, ultimately\nfacilitating head-start optimization for more efficient decision-making.\nHowever, the curse of negative transfer persists when applying knowledge\ntransfer to EOPs, primarily due to the inherent limitations of existing methods\nin assessing knowledge transferability. On the one hand, a priori\ntransferability assessment criteria are intrinsically inaccurate due to their\nimprecise understandings. On the other hand, a posteriori methods often\nnecessitate sufficient observations to make correct inferences, rendering them\ninefficient when applied to EOPs. Considering the above, this paper introduces\na Bayesian competitive knowledge transfer (BCKT) method developed to improve\nmulti-task SAS (MSAS) when addressing multiple EOPs simultaneously.\nSpecifically, the transferability of knowledge is estimated from a Bayesian\nperspective that accommodates both prior beliefs and empirical evidence,\nenabling accurate competition between inner-task and inter-task solutions,\nultimately leading to the adaptive use of promising solutions while effectively\nsuppressing inferior ones. The effectiveness of our method in boosting various\nSAS algorithms for both multi-task and many-task problems is empirically\nvalidated, complemented by comparative studies that demonstrate its superiority\nover peer algorithms and its applicability to real-world scenarios. The source\ncode of our method is available at https://github.com/XmingHsueh/MSAS-BCKT."

Serving hundreds or thousands of these adapters on a single GPU allows\nrequest aggregation, increasing throughput, but may also cause request\nstarvation if GPU memory limits are exceeded. To address this issue, this study\nfocuses on determining the joint configuration of concurrent and parallel\nadapters that maximizes GPU throughput without inducing starvation, given\nheterogeneous adapter and traffic properties. We propose a data-driven ML\napproach leveraging interpretable models to tackle this caching problem and\nintroduce the first Digital Twin capable of reproducing an LLM-adapter serving\nsystem, enabling efficient training data generation.

                    "value": "With the rapid adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs), LLM-adapters have\nbecome increasingly common, providing lightweight specialization of large-scale\nmodels. Serving hundreds or thousands of these adapters on a single GPU allows\nrequest aggregation, increasing throughput, but may also cause request\nstarvation if GPU memory limits are exceeded. To address this issue, this study\nfocuses on determining the joint configuration of concurrent and parallel\nadapters that maximizes GPU throughput without inducing starvation, given\nheterogeneous adapter and traffic properties. We propose a data-driven ML\napproach leveraging interpretable models to tackle this caching problem and\nintroduce the first Digital Twin capable of reproducing an LLM-adapter serving\nsystem, enabling efficient training data generation.

The parameters are inferred\nusing the Mixture Model for Open clusters (MiMO), a novel Bayesian framework\nfor modeling clusters in the color-magnitude diagram. By explicitly accounting\nfor field-star contamination as a model component, MiMO removes the\nconventional need for stringent membership preselection, allowing for a more\ncomplete inclusion of member stars and thereby enhancing both precision and\nrobustness. Our results broadly agree with existing catalogs but offer improved\nprecision. For each cluster, we provide the best-fit age, metallicity,\ndistance, extinction, and MF slope, along with their full likelihood chains and\nphotometric membership probabilities for individual stars.

The parameters are inferred\nusing the Mixture Model for Open clusters (MiMO), a novel Bayesian framework\nfor modeling clusters in the color-magnitude diagram. By explicitly accounting\nfor field-star contamination as a model component, MiMO removes the\nconventional need for stringent membership preselection, allowing for a more\ncomplete inclusion of member stars and thereby enhancing both precision and\nrobustness. Our results broadly agree with existing catalogs but offer improved\nprecision. For each cluster, we provide the best-fit age, metallicity,\ndistance, extinction, and MF slope, along with their full likelihood chains and\nphotometric membership probabilities for individual stars. We further identify\nan ``MF Prime'' subsample of 163 clusters with high-quality data, for which the\nMF estimates are considered most reliable.

This paper introduces a\nbenchmark for evaluating how well large language models (LLMs) can anticipate\nchanges in job demand, especially in occupations affected by AI. Existing\nresearch has shown that LLMs can extract sentiment, summarize economic reports,\nand emulate forecaster behavior, but little work has assessed their use for\nforward-looking labor prediction. Our benchmark combines two complementary\ndatasets: a high-frequency index of sector-level job postings in the United\nStates, and a global dataset of projected occupational changes due to AI\nadoption. We format these data into forecasting tasks with clear temporal\nsplits, minimizing the risk of information leakage. We then evaluate LLMs using\nmultiple prompting strategies, comparing task-scaffolded, persona-driven, and\nhybrid approaches across model families. We assess both quantitative accuracy\nand qualitative consistency over time. Results show that structured task\nprompts consistently improve forecast stability, while persona prompts offer\nadvantages on short-term trends. However, performance varies significantly\nacross sectors and horizons, highlighting the need for domain-aware prompting\nand rigorous evaluation protocols. By releasing our benchmark, we aim to\nsupport future research on labor forecasting, prompt design, and LLM-based\neconomic reasoning.

These shared mechanisms pose a central challenge to\nidentifying causal effects in precision medicine. We propose a novel\ncovariate-dependent nonparametric Bayesian multi-treatment cure survival model\nthat jointly accounts for common structures among treatments and cure\nfractions. Through latent link functions, our model leverages sharing among\ntreatments through a flexible modeling approach, enabling individualized\nsurvival inference. We adopt a Bayesian route for inference and implement an\nefficient MCMC algorithm for approximating the posterior. Simulation studies\ndemonstrate the method's robustness and superiority in various specification\nscenarios.

These shared mechanisms pose a central challenge to\nidentifying causal effects in precision medicine. We propose a novel\ncovariate-dependent nonparametric Bayesian multi-treatment cure survival model\nthat jointly accounts for common structures among treatments and cure\nfractions. Through latent link functions, our model leverages sharing among\ntreatments through a flexible modeling approach, enabling individualized\nsurvival inference. We adopt a Bayesian route for inference and implement an\nefficient MCMC algorithm for approximating the posterior. Simulation studies\ndemonstrate the method's robustness and superiority in various specification\nscenarios.

Recent\nadvancements in diffusion-based 3D generative techniques offer the potential to\naddress these limitations by leveraging learned generative priors to\nhallucinate invisible parts of objects, thereby generating plausible 3D\nstructures. However, the stochastic nature of the inference process limits the\naccuracy and reliability of generation results, preventing existing\nreconstruction frameworks from integrating such 3D generative priors. In this\nwork, we comprehensively analyze the reasons why diffusion-based 3D generative\nmethods fail to achieve high consistency, including (a) the insufficiency in\nconstructing and leveraging cross-view connections when extracting multi-view\nimage features as conditions, and (b) the poor controllability of iterative\ndenoising during local detail generation, which easily leads to plausible but\ninconsistent fine geometric and texture details with inputs. Accordingly, we\npropose ReconViaGen to innovatively integrate reconstruction priors into the\ngenerative framework and devise several strategies that effectively address\nthese issues. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our ReconViaGen can\nreconstruct complete and accurate 3D models consistent with input views in both\nglobal structure and local details.Project page:\nhttps://jiahao620.github.io/reconviagen.",

Recent\nadvancements in diffusion-based 3D generative techniques offer the potential to\naddress these limitations by leveraging learned generative priors to\nhallucinate invisible parts of objects, thereby generating plausible 3D\nstructures. However, the stochastic nature of the inference process limits the\naccuracy and reliability of generation results, preventing existing\nreconstruction frameworks from integrating such 3D generative priors. In this\nwork, we comprehensively analyze the reasons why diffusion-based 3D generative\nmethods fail to achieve high consistency, including (a) the insufficiency in\nconstructing and leveraging cross-view connections when extracting multi-view\nimage features as conditions, and (b) the poor controllability of iterative\ndenoising during local detail generation, which easily leads to plausible but\ninconsistent fine geometric and texture details with inputs. Accordingly, we\npropose ReconViaGen to innovatively integrate reconstruction priors into the\ngenerative framework and devise several strategies that effectively address\nthese issues. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our ReconViaGen can\nreconstruct complete and accurate 3D models consistent with input views in both\nglobal structure and local details.Project page:\nhttps://jiahao620.github.io/reconviagen."

To address these issues, we evaluate three realignment\ndefenses: SafeInstruct, SafeLoRA, SafeMERGE. We show that, across all settings,\nthe proposed defenses can effectively restore safety without compromising\ntelecom task performance, leading to Safe teleCOMMunication (SafeCOMM) models.\nOur work serves as both a diagnostic study and practical guide for safety\nrealignment in telecom-tuned LLMs, underscoring the need for safety-aware\ninstruction and fine-tuning in the telecom domain.",

This\nway, our framework enables, for the first time, a probabilistic perspective on\nthe interplay between the statistical properties of the node data and\nperturbations in the graph topology. We conduct extensive experiments to\nvalidate our theoretical findings and demonstrate their benefits over existing\nbaselines, in terms of both representation stability and adversarial attacks on\ndownstream tasks. Our results demonstrate the practical significance of the\nproposed formulation and highlight the importance of incorporating data\ndistribution into stability analysis."

In this work, we introduce NaviWM, a\nsocially-aware robot Navigation World Model that augments LLM reasoning with a\nstructured world model and a logic-driven chain-of-thought process.

This integration enables the robot\nto generate navigation decisions that are both socially compliant and\nphysically safe, under well-defined constraints such as personal space,\ncollision avoidance, and timing. Unlike previous methods based on prompting or\nfine-tuning, NaviWM encodes social norms as first-order logic, enabling\ninterpretable and verifiable reasoning.

To validate such\njudge systems, evaluators assess human--judge agreement by first collecting\nmultiple human ratings for each item in a validation corpus, then aggregating\nthe ratings into a single, per-item gold label rating. For many items, however,\nrating criteria may admit multiple valid interpretations, so a human or LLM\nrater may deem multiple ratings \"reasonable\" or \"correct.\" We call this\ncondition rating indeterminacy. Problematically, many rating tasks that contain\nrating indeterminacy rely on forced-choice elicitation, whereby raters are\ninstructed to select only one rating for each item. In this paper, we introduce\na framework for validating LLM-as-a-judge systems under rating indeterminacy.\nWe draw theoretical connections between different measures of judge system\nperformance under different human--judge agreement metrics, and different\nrating elicitation and aggregation schemes. We demonstrate that differences in\nhow humans and LLMs resolve rating indeterminacy when responding to\nforced-choice rating instructions can heavily bias LLM-as-a-judge validation.\nThrough extensive experiments involving 11 real-world rating tasks and 9\ncommercial LLMs, we show that standard validation approaches that rely upon\nforced-choice ratings select judge systems that are highly suboptimal,\nperforming as much as 31% worse than judge systems selected by our approach\nthat uses multi-label \"response set\" ratings to account for rating\nindeterminacy. We conclude with concrete recommendations for more principled\napproaches to LLM-as-a-judge validation.",

While\nmultimodal large language models (MLLMs) show promise, existing benchmarks\nlargely overlook these tutoring skills. We introduce MMTutorBench, the first\nbenchmark for AI math tutoring, consisting of 685 problems built around\npedagogically significant key-steps. Each problem is paired with\nproblem-specific rubrics that enable fine-grained evaluation across six\ndimensions, and structured into three tasks-Insight Discovery, Operation\nFormulation, and Operation Execution. We evaluate 12 leading MLLMs and find\nclear performance gaps between proprietary and open-source systems, substantial\nroom compared to human tutors, and consistent trends across input variants: OCR\npipelines degrade tutoring quality, few-shot prompting yields limited gains,\nand our rubric-based LLM-as-a-Judge proves highly reliable. These results\nhighlight both the difficulty and diagnostic value of MMTutorBench for\nadvancing AI tutoring.",

                    "value": "Effective math tutoring requires not only solving problems but also\ndiagnosing students' difficulties and guiding them step by step. While\nmultimodal large language models (MLLMs) show promise, existing benchmarks\nlargely overlook these tutoring skills. We introduce MMTutorBench, the first\nbenchmark for AI math tutoring, consisting of 685 problems built around\npedagogically significant key-steps. Each problem is paired with\nproblem-specific rubrics that enable fine-grained evaluation across six\ndimensions, and structured into three tasks-Insight Discovery, Operation\nFormulation, and Operation Execution. We evaluate 12 leading MLLMs and find\nclear performance gaps between proprietary and open-source systems, substantial\nroom compared to human tutors, and consistent trends across input variants: OCR\npipelines degrade tutoring quality, few-shot prompting yields limited gains,\nand our rubric-based LLM-as-a-Judge proves highly reliable. These results\nhighlight both the difficulty and diagnostic value of MMTutorBench for\nadvancing AI tutoring."

These\nchallenges limit the effectiveness of conventional supervised fine-tuning (SFT)\nand Chain-of-Thought (CoT) strategies that work well in general domains. To\naddress these challenges, we propose Med-R1, a reinforcement learning\n(RL)-enhanced vision-language model designed to improve generalization and\nreliability in medical reasoning. Built on the DeepSeek strategy, Med-R1 adopts\nGroup Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to encourage reward-guided learning\nbeyond static annotations. We comprehensively evaluate Med-R1 across eight\ndistinct medical imaging modalities. Med-R1 achieves a 29.94% improvement in\naverage accuracy over its base model Qwen2-VL-2B, and even outperforms\nQwen2-VL-72B-a model with 36x more parameters. To assess cross-task\ngeneralization, we further evaluate Med-R1 on five question types. Med-R1\noutperforms Qwen2-VL-2B by 32.06% in question-type generalization, also\nsurpassing Qwen2-VL-72B. We further explore the thinking process in Med-R1, a\ncrucial component for the success of Deepseek-R1.

Models trained with TARS exhibit\nadaptive behaviors by spending more compute on ambiguous queries, leading to\nbetter safety-refusal trade-offs. They also internally learn to better\ndistinguish between safe and unsafe prompts and attain greater robustness to\nboth white-box (e.g., GCG) and black-box attacks (e.g., PAIR). Overall, our\nwork provides an effective, open recipe for training LLMs against jailbreaks\nand harmful requests by reasoning per prompt."

This paper introduces a\nbenchmark for evaluating how well large language models (LLMs) can anticipate\nchanges in job demand, especially in occupations affected by AI. Existing\nresearch has shown that LLMs can extract sentiment, summarize economic reports,\nand emulate forecaster behavior, but little work has assessed their use for\nforward-looking labor prediction. Our benchmark combines two complementary\ndatasets: a high-frequency index of sector-level job postings in the United\nStates, and a global dataset of projected occupational changes due to AI\nadoption. We format these data into forecasting tasks with clear temporal\nsplits, minimizing the risk of information leakage. We then evaluate LLMs using\nmultiple prompting strategies, comparing task-scaffolded, persona-driven, and\nhybrid approaches across model families. We assess both quantitative accuracy\nand qualitative consistency over time. Results show that structured task\nprompts consistently improve forecast stability, while persona prompts offer\nadvantages on short-term trends. However, performance varies significantly\nacross sectors and horizons, highlighting the need for domain-aware prompting\nand rigorous evaluation protocols. By releasing our benchmark, we aim to\nsupport future research on labor forecasting, prompt design, and LLM-based\neconomic reasoning.

However, the concept of trustworthy AI remains broad and\nmulti-faceted. This thesis advances knowledge in the safety, fairness,\ntransparency, and accountability of AI systems. In safety, we extend classical\ndeterministic shielding techniques to become resilient against delayed\nobservations, enabling practical deployment in real-world conditions. We also\nimplement both deterministic and probabilistic safety shields into simulated\nautonomous vehicles to prevent collisions with road users, validating the use\nof these techniques in realistic driving simulators. We introduce fairness\nshields, a novel post-processing approach to enforce group fairness in\nsequential decision-making settings over finite and periodic time horizons. By\noptimizing intervention costs while strictly ensuring fairness constraints,\nthis method efficiently balances fairness with minimal interference. For\ntransparency and accountability, we propose a formal framework for assessing\nintentional behaviour in probabilistic decision-making agents, introducing\nquantitative metrics of agency and intention quotient. We use these metrics to\npropose a retrospective analysis of intention, useful for determining\nresponsibility when autonomous systems cause unintended harm. Finally, we unify\nthese contributions through the ``reactive decision-making'' framework,\nproviding a general formalization that consolidates previous approaches.\nCollectively, the advancements presented contribute practically to the\nrealization of safer, fairer, and more accountable AI systems, laying the\nfoundations for future research in trustworthy AI.",

                    "value": "Ensuring responsible use of artificial intelligence (AI) has become\nimperative as autonomous systems increasingly influence critical societal\ndomains. However, the concept of trustworthy AI remains broad and\nmulti-faceted. This thesis advances knowledge in the safety, fairness,\ntransparency, and accountability of AI systems. In safety, we extend classical\ndeterministic shielding techniques to become resilient against delayed\nobservations, enabling practical deployment in real-world conditions. We also\nimplement both deterministic and probabilistic safety shields into simulated\nautonomous vehicles to prevent collisions with road users, validating the use\nof these techniques in realistic driving simulators. We introduce fairness\nshields, a novel post-processing approach to enforce group fairness in\nsequential decision-making settings over finite and periodic time horizons. By\noptimizing intervention costs while strictly ensuring fairness constraints,\nthis method efficiently balances fairness with minimal interference. For\ntransparency and accountability, we propose a formal framework for assessing\nintentional behaviour in probabilistic decision-making agents, introducing\nquantitative metrics of agency and intention quotient. We use these metrics to\npropose a retrospective analysis of intention, useful for determining\nresponsibility when autonomous systems cause unintended harm. Finally, we unify\nthese contributions through the ``reactive decision-making'' framework,\nproviding a general formalization that consolidates previous approaches.\nCollectively, the advancements presented contribute practically to the\nrealization of safer, fairer, and more accountable AI systems, laying the\nfoundations for future research in trustworthy AI."

We frame this as\na combinatorial optimization problem and investigate the upper limits of LLMs'\ncapacity to solve it when maximally leveraged. Specifically, we explore four\nfoundational questions: (1) how to best harness an LLM's internal heuristics to\nformulate the fine-grained hypothesis it itself would judge as the most\npromising among all the possible hypotheses it might generate, based on its own\ninternal scoring-thus defining a latent reward landscape over the hypothesis\nspace; (2) whether such LLM-judged better hypotheses exhibit stronger alignment\nwith ground-truth hypotheses; (3) whether shaping the reward landscape using an\nensemble of diverse LLMs of similar capacity yields better outcomes than\ndefining it with repeated instances of the strongest LLM among them; and (4)\nwhether an ensemble of identical LLMs provides a more reliable reward landscape\nthan a single LLM. To address these questions, we propose a hierarchical search\nmethod that incrementally proposes and integrates details into the hypothesis,\nprogressing from general concepts to specific experimental configurations.

                "summary": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is widely used to mitigate\nhallucinations of Large Language Models (LLMs) by leveraging external\nknowledge. While effective for simple queries, traditional RAG systems struggle\nwith large-scale, unstructured corpora where information is fragmented. Recent\nadvances incorporate knowledge graphs to capture relational structures,\nenabling more comprehensive retrieval for complex, multi-hop reasoning tasks.\nHowever, existing graph-based RAG (GraphRAG) methods rely on unstable and\ncostly relation extraction for graph construction, often producing noisy graphs\nwith incorrect or inconsistent relations that degrade retrieval quality. In\nthis paper, we revisit the pipeline of existing GraphRAG systems and propose\nLinearRAG (Linear Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation), an efficient\nframework that enables reliable graph construction and precise passage\nretrieval. Specifically, LinearRAG constructs a relation-free hierarchical\ngraph, termed Tri-Graph, using only lightweight entity extraction and semantic\nlinking, avoiding unstable relation modeling. This new paradigm of graph\nconstruction scales linearly with corpus size and incurs no extra token\nconsumption, providing an economical and reliable indexing of the original\npassages. For retrieval, LinearRAG adopts a two-stage strategy: (i) relevant\nentity activation via local semantic bridging, followed by (ii) passage\nretrieval through global importance aggregation. Extensive experiments on four\ndatasets demonstrate that LinearRAG significantly outperforms baseline models.\nOur code and datasets are available at https://github.com/DEEP-PolyU/LinearRAG.",

                    "value": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is widely used to mitigate\nhallucinations of Large Language Models (LLMs) by leveraging external\nknowledge. While effective for simple queries, traditional RAG systems struggle\nwith large-scale, unstructured corpora where information is fragmented. Recent\nadvances incorporate knowledge graphs to capture relational structures,\nenabling more comprehensive retrieval for complex, multi-hop reasoning tasks.\nHowever, existing graph-based RAG (GraphRAG) methods rely on unstable and\ncostly relation extraction for graph construction, often producing noisy graphs\nwith incorrect or inconsistent relations that degrade retrieval quality. In\nthis paper, we revisit the pipeline of existing GraphRAG systems and propose\nLinearRAG (Linear Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation), an efficient\nframework that enables reliable graph construction and precise passage\nretrieval. Specifically, LinearRAG constructs a relation-free hierarchical\ngraph, termed Tri-Graph, using only lightweight entity extraction and semantic\nlinking, avoiding unstable relation modeling. This new paradigm of graph\nconstruction scales linearly with corpus size and incurs no extra token\nconsumption, providing an economical and reliable indexing of the original\npassages. For retrieval, LinearRAG adopts a two-stage strategy: (i) relevant\nentity activation via local semantic bridging, followed by (ii) passage\nretrieval through global importance aggregation. Extensive experiments on four\ndatasets demonstrate that LinearRAG significantly outperforms baseline models.\nOur code and datasets are available at https://github.com/DEEP-PolyU/LinearRAG."

                "summary": "The widespread use of cameras in our society has created an overwhelming\namount of video data, far exceeding the capacity for human monitoring. This\npresents a critical challenge for public safety and security, as the timely\ndetection of anomalous or criminal events is crucial for effective response and\nprevention. The ability for an embodied agent to recognize unexpected events is\nfundamentally tied to its capacity for spatial reasoning. This paper\ninvestigates the spatial reasoning of vision-language models (VLMs) by framing\nanomalous action recognition as a zero-shot, language-grounded task, addressing\nthe embodied perception challenge of interpreting dynamic 3D scenes from sparse\n2D video. Specifically, we investigate whether small, pre-trained vision--LLMs\ncan act as spatially-grounded, zero-shot anomaly detectors by converting video\ninto text descriptions and scoring labels via textual entailment. We evaluate\nfour open models on UCF-Crime and RWF-2000 under prompting and\nprivacy-preserving conditions. Few-shot exemplars can improve accuracy for some\nmodels, but may increase false positives, and privacy filters -- especially\nfull-body GAN transforms -- introduce inconsistencies that degrade accuracy.\nThese results chart where current vision--LLMs succeed (simple, spatially\nsalient events) and where they falter (noisy spatial cues, identity\nobfuscation). Looking forward, we outline concrete paths to strengthen spatial\ngrounding without task-specific training: structure-aware prompts, lightweight\nspatial memory across clips, scene-graph or 3D-pose priors during description,\nand privacy methods that preserve action-relevant geometry. This positions\nzero-shot, language-grounded pipelines as adaptable building blocks for\nembodied, real-world video understanding.
