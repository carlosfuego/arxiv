Yet, learning effective long-context policies from\ndemonstrations remains challenging. As context length increases, training\nbecomes increasingly expensive due to rising memory demands, and policy\nperformance often degrades as a result of spurious correlations. Recent methods\ntypically sidestep these issues by truncating context length, discarding\nhistorical information that may be critical for subsequent decisions. In this\npaper, we propose an alternative approach that explicitly regularizes the\nretention of past information. We first revisit the copycat problem in\nimitation learning and identify an opposite challenge in recent diffusion\npolicies: rather than over-relying on prior actions, they often fail to capture\nessential dependencies between past and future actions. To address this, we\nintroduce Past-Token Prediction (PTP), an auxiliary task in which the policy\nlearns to predict past action tokens alongside future ones. This regularization\nsignificantly improves temporal modeling in the policy head, with minimal\nreliance on visual representations. Building on this observation, we further\nintroduce a multistage training strategy: pre-train the visual encoder with\nshort contexts, and fine-tune the policy head using cached long-context\nembeddings. This strategy preserves the benefits of PTP while greatly reducing\nmemory and computational overhead. Finally, we extend PTP into a\nself-verification mechanism at test time, enabling the policy to score and\nselect candidates consistent with past actions during inference.

In this work, we leverage the theoretical advantages of Hadamard\nmatrices over random rotation matrices to push the boundaries of quantization\nin LLMs. We demonstrate that Hadamard matrices are more effective in reducing\noutliers, which are a significant obstacle in achieving low-bit quantization.\nOur method based on a gradual binary search enables 3-bit quantization for\nweights, activations, and key-value (KV) caches, resulting in a 40% increase in\naccuracy on common benchmarks compared to SoTA methods. We extend the use of\nrotation matrices to support non-power-of-2 embedding dimensions, similar to\nthe Qwen architecture, by employing the Paley algorithm. We theoretically\ndemonstrates the superiority of Hadamard matrices in reducing outliers.We\nachieved 3-bit quantization for weights, activations, and KV cache,\nsignificantly enhancing model performance.

In this work, we leverage the theoretical advantages of Hadamard\nmatrices over random rotation matrices to push the boundaries of quantization\nin LLMs. We demonstrate that Hadamard matrices are more effective in reducing\noutliers, which are a significant obstacle in achieving low-bit quantization.\nOur method based on a gradual binary search enables 3-bit quantization for\nweights, activations, and key-value (KV) caches, resulting in a 40% increase in\naccuracy on common benchmarks compared to SoTA methods. We extend the use of\nrotation matrices to support non-power-of-2 embedding dimensions, similar to\nthe Qwen architecture, by employing the Paley algorithm. We theoretically\ndemonstrates the superiority of Hadamard matrices in reducing outliers.We\nachieved 3-bit quantization for weights, activations, and KV cache,\nsignificantly enhancing model performance. Our experimental results on multiple\nmodels family like Mistral, LLaMA, and Qwen demonstrate the effectiveness of\nour approach, outperforming existing methods and enabling practical 3-bit\nquantization."

This design enables efficient inference across both\ndiscrete text environments (e.g., TextWorld, ALFWorld) and continuous control\ndomains (e.g., MuJoCo), achieving a 3.8--4.7$\\times$ reduction in LLM queries\nand 4.0--12.0$\\times$ lower median latencies (85--93\\,ms on a consumer GPU)\nwhile retaining 96--98\\% of uncached performance. Our theoretical analysis\nprovides KL divergence bounds on approximation quality, validated empirically.\nThe framework extends to offline RL, where our CQL-Prior variant improves\nperformance by 14--29\\% and reduces training time by 38--40\\%. Extensive\nevaluations across a diverse suite of eight tasks demonstrate the\ngeneralizability and practical viability of LLM-guided RL in\nresource-constrained settings."

                "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) are widely applied in chatbots, code generators,\nand search engines. Workloads such as chain-of-thought, complex reasoning, and\nagent services significantly increase the inference cost by invoking the model\nrepeatedly. Optimization methods such as parallelism, compression, and caching\nhave been adopted to reduce costs, but the diverse service requirements make it\nhard to select the right method. Recently, specialized LLM inference engines\nhave emerged as a key component for integrating the optimization methods into\nservice-oriented infrastructures. However, a systematic study on inference\nengines is still lacking. This paper provides a comprehensive evaluation of 25\nopen-source and commercial inference engines. We examine each inference engine\nin terms of ease-of-use, ease-of-deployment, general-purpose support,\nscalability, and suitability for throughput- and latency-aware computation.\nFurthermore, we explore the design goals of each inference engine by\ninvestigating the optimization techniques it supports. In addition, we assess\nthe ecosystem maturity of open source inference engines and handle the\nperformance and cost policy of commercial solutions. We outline future research\ndirections that include support for complex LLM-based services, support of\nvarious hardware, and enhanced security, offering practical guidance to\nresearchers and developers in selecting and designing optimized LLM inference\nengines. We also provide a public repository to continually track developments\nin this fast-evolving field:\nhttps://github.com/sihyeong/Awesome-LLM-Inference-Engine",

                    "value": "Large language models (LLMs) are widely applied in chatbots, code generators,\nand search engines. Workloads such as chain-of-thought, complex reasoning, and\nagent services significantly increase the inference cost by invoking the model\nrepeatedly. Optimization methods such as parallelism, compression, and caching\nhave been adopted to reduce costs, but the diverse service requirements make it\nhard to select the right method. Recently, specialized LLM inference engines\nhave emerged as a key component for integrating the optimization methods into\nservice-oriented infrastructures. However, a systematic study on inference\nengines is still lacking. This paper provides a comprehensive evaluation of 25\nopen-source and commercial inference engines. We examine each inference engine\nin terms of ease-of-use, ease-of-deployment, general-purpose support,\nscalability, and suitability for throughput- and latency-aware computation.\nFurthermore, we explore the design goals of each inference engine by\ninvestigating the optimization techniques it supports. In addition, we assess\nthe ecosystem maturity of open source inference engines and handle the\nperformance and cost policy of commercial solutions. We outline future research\ndirections that include support for complex LLM-based services, support of\nvarious hardware, and enhanced security, offering practical guidance to\nresearchers and developers in selecting and designing optimized LLM inference\nengines. We also provide a public repository to continually track developments\nin this fast-evolving field:\nhttps://github.com/sihyeong/Awesome-LLM-Inference-Engine"

Through a series of controlled experiments, we measure the\nvalidator's throughput and resource efficiency as RAM availability ranges\nbetween 128 GB to 1,536 GB (1.5 TB). We discover that the validator performance\ndegrades significantly below 256 GB, with transaction processing falling behind\nreal-time block production. Additionally, we study the program cache behavior,\nidentifying inefficiencies in program eviction and load latency. Our results\nprovide practical guidance for hardware provisioning and suggest improvements\nto the Solana execution and caching strategy, reducing latency due to the\nprogram cache by 90%."

As\nthis iterative process steadily increases memory and compute demands,\nlayer-based partitioning in resource-constrained edge environments often\nresults in memory overload or high inference latency. To address this and\nreduce inference latency, we propose a resource-aware Transformer architecture\npartitioning algorithm, where the partitioning decision is updated at regular\nintervals during token generation.

Our approach partitions the\ndecoder at the attention head level, co-locating each attention head with its\nkey-value cache and allowing dynamic migrations whenever resources become\ntight. By allocating different attention heads to different devices, we exploit\nparallel execution of attention heads and thus achieve substantial reductions\nin inference delays.

We address this by balancing the number of tokens monitored against the\namount of information leaked.

                "summary": "Coded caching scheme originally proposed by Maddah-Ali and Niesen (MN)\nconsidered a broadcast network consisting of a single server connected to a set\nof users each having a cache memory. Motivated by practical scenarios,\nKaramchandani \\textit{et al.} in [16] proposed a coded caching scheme for a\ntwo-layer hierarchical network consisting of a single server connected to\nmultiple mirror sites and each mirror site connected to a distinct set of\nusers, in which both mirror sites and users having cache memories. Low\nsubpacketization level coded caching schemes are desirable for practical\nimplementations. Placement delivery array (PDA) was proposed as a tool to\ndesign coded caching schemes with reduced subpacketization level by Yan\n\\textit{et al.} in [4]. Schemes with reduced subpacketization levels are\nstudied extensively in the literature for single-layer networks. Kong\n\\textit{et al.} in [17] proposed a structure called hierarchical placement\ndelivery arrays (HPDA), which characterizes a hierarchical coded caching system\nand also proposed a class of HPDAs that gives low subpacketization level\nschemes by using two PDAs. Low subpacketization level hierarchical schemes\nusing combinatorial $t$-designs is proposed in [20]. Apart from that there is\nno other existing work that discusses the subpacketization problem in a\nhierarchical network. This paper proposes a class of HPDA construction that\ngives low subpacketization level hierarchical coded caching schemes, by first\nconstructing a new class of PDAs. Compared with the existing schemes, in cases\nwhere the system parameters and subpacketization level are the same, the\nproposed hierarchical scheme has a better coding delay. Further, the new class\nof PDAs constructed either subsumes several known PDA constructions or achieves\nbetter transmission load for the same system parameters.",

                    "value": "Coded caching scheme originally proposed by Maddah-Ali and Niesen (MN)\nconsidered a broadcast network consisting of a single server connected to a set\nof users each having a cache memory. Motivated by practical scenarios,\nKaramchandani \\textit{et al.} in [16] proposed a coded caching scheme for a\ntwo-layer hierarchical network consisting of a single server connected to\nmultiple mirror sites and each mirror site connected to a distinct set of\nusers, in which both mirror sites and users having cache memories. Low\nsubpacketization level coded caching schemes are desirable for practical\nimplementations. Placement delivery array (PDA) was proposed as a tool to\ndesign coded caching schemes with reduced subpacketization level by Yan\n\\textit{et al.} in [4]. Schemes with reduced subpacketization levels are\nstudied extensively in the literature for single-layer networks. Kong\n\\textit{et al.} in [17] proposed a structure called hierarchical placement\ndelivery arrays (HPDA), which characterizes a hierarchical coded caching system\nand also proposed a class of HPDAs that gives low subpacketization level\nschemes by using two PDAs. Low subpacketization level hierarchical schemes\nusing combinatorial $t$-designs is proposed in [20]. Apart from that there is\nno other existing work that discusses the subpacketization problem in a\nhierarchical network. This paper proposes a class of HPDA construction that\ngives low subpacketization level hierarchical coded caching schemes, by first\nconstructing a new class of PDAs. Compared with the existing schemes, in cases\nwhere the system parameters and subpacketization level are the same, the\nproposed hierarchical scheme has a better coding delay.

Such storage inefficiency delivers poor serving performance under high\nrequest rates.\n  In this paper, we identify that the advantage of the disaggregated system\nlies in the disaggregated computation, i.e., partitioning the computational\nresource to enable the asynchronous computation of two phases. Thus, we propose\na novel LLM serving system, semi-PD, characterized by disaggregated computation\nand unified storage. In semi-PD, we introduce a computation resource controller\nto achieve disaggregated computation at the streaming multi-processor (SM)\nlevel, and a unified memory manager to manage the asynchronous memory access\nfrom both phases. semi-PD has a low-overhead resource adjustment mechanism\nbetween the two phases, and a service-level objective (SLO) aware dynamic\npartitioning algorithm to optimize the SLO attainment.

To\nthis end, we draw insights from classical signal processing and control theory,\nto develop a quantitative measure of \\textit{memory utilization}: the internal\nmechanisms through which a model stores past information to produce future\noutputs. This metric, which we call \\textbf{\\textit{effective state-size}}\n(ESS), is tailored to the fundamental class of systems with\n\\textit{input-invariant} and \\textit{input-varying linear operators},\nencompassing a variety of computational units such as variants of attention,\nconvolutions, and recurrences. Unlike prior work on memory utilization, which\neither relies on raw operator visualizations (e.g. attention maps), or simply\nthe total \\textit{memory capacity} (i.e. cache size) of a model, our metrics\nprovide highly interpretable and actionable measurements. In particular, we\nshow how ESS can be leveraged to improve initialization strategies, inform\nnovel regularizers and advance the performance-efficiency frontier through\nmodel distillation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the effect of context\ndelimiters (such as end-of-speech tokens) on ESS highlights cross-architectural\ndifferences in how large language models utilize their available memory to\nrecall information. Overall, we find that ESS provides valuable insights into\nthe dynamics that dictate memory utilization, enabling the design of more\nefficient and effective sequence models.",

                    "value": "The need to develop a general framework for architecture analysis is becoming\nincreasingly important, given the expanding design space of sequence models. To\nthis end, we draw insights from classical signal processing and control theory,\nto develop a quantitative measure of \\textit{memory utilization}: the internal\nmechanisms through which a model stores past information to produce future\noutputs. This metric, which we call \\textbf{\\textit{effective state-size}}\n(ESS), is tailored to the fundamental class of systems with\n\\textit{input-invariant} and \\textit{input-varying linear operators},\nencompassing a variety of computational units such as variants of attention,\nconvolutions, and recurrences. Unlike prior work on memory utilization, which\neither relies on raw operator visualizations (e.g. attention maps), or simply\nthe total \\textit{memory capacity} (i.e. cache size) of a model, our metrics\nprovide highly interpretable and actionable measurements. In particular, we\nshow how ESS can be leveraged to improve initialization strategies, inform\nnovel regularizers and advance the performance-efficiency frontier through\nmodel distillation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the effect of context\ndelimiters (such as end-of-speech tokens) on ESS highlights cross-architectural\ndifferences in how large language models utilize their available memory to\nrecall information. Overall, we find that ESS provides valuable insights into\nthe dynamics that dictate memory utilization, enabling the design of more\nefficient and effective sequence models."

                "summary": "With the widespread deployment of long-context large language models (LLMs),\nthere has been a growing demand for efficient support of high-throughput\ninference. However, as the key-value (KV) cache expands with the sequence\nlength, the increasing memory footprint and the need to access it for each\ntoken generation both result in low throughput when serving long-context LLMs.\nWhile various dynamic sparse attention methods have been proposed to speed up\ninference while maintaining generation quality, they either fail to\nsufficiently reduce GPU memory consumption or introduce significant decoding\nlatency by offloading the KV cache to the CPU. We present ShadowKV, a\nhigh-throughput long-context LLM inference system that stores the low-rank key\ncache and offloads the value cache to reduce the memory footprint for larger\nbatch sizes and longer sequences. To minimize decoding latency, ShadowKV\nemploys an accurate KV selection strategy that reconstructs minimal sparse KV\npairs on-the-fly. By evaluating ShadowKV on a broad range of benchmarks,\nincluding RULER, LongBench, and Needle In A Haystack, and models like\nLlama-3.1-8B, Llama-3-8B-1M, GLM-4-9B-1M, Yi-9B-200K, Phi-3-Mini-128K, and\nQwen2-7B-128K, we demonstrate that it can support up to 6$\\times$ larger batch\nsizes and boost throughput by up to 3.04$\\times$ on an A100 GPU without\nsacrificing accuracy, even surpassing the performance achievable with infinite\nbatch size under the assumption of infinite GPU memory.

                    "value": "With the widespread deployment of long-context large language models (LLMs),\nthere has been a growing demand for efficient support of high-throughput\ninference. However, as the key-value (KV) cache expands with the sequence\nlength, the increasing memory footprint and the need to access it for each\ntoken generation both result in low throughput when serving long-context LLMs.\nWhile various dynamic sparse attention methods have been proposed to speed up\ninference while maintaining generation quality, they either fail to\nsufficiently reduce GPU memory consumption or introduce significant decoding\nlatency by offloading the KV cache to the CPU. We present ShadowKV, a\nhigh-throughput long-context LLM inference system that stores the low-rank key\ncache and offloads the value cache to reduce the memory footprint for larger\nbatch sizes and longer sequences. To minimize decoding latency, ShadowKV\nemploys an accurate KV selection strategy that reconstructs minimal sparse KV\npairs on-the-fly. By evaluating ShadowKV on a broad range of benchmarks,\nincluding RULER, LongBench, and Needle In A Haystack, and models like\nLlama-3.1-8B, Llama-3-8B-1M, GLM-4-9B-1M, Yi-9B-200K, Phi-3-Mini-128K, and\nQwen2-7B-128K, we demonstrate that it can support up to 6$\\times$ larger batch\nsizes and boost throughput by up to 3.04$\\times$ on an A100 GPU without\nsacrificing accuracy, even surpassing the performance achievable with infinite\nbatch size under the assumption of infinite GPU memory.

To tackle this challenge, we propose 3D-Fixup, a\nnew framework for editing 2D images guided by learned 3D priors. The framework\nsupports difficult editing situations such as object translation and 3D\nrotation. To achieve this, we leverage a training-based approach that harnesses\nthe generative power of diffusion models. As video data naturally encodes\nreal-world physical dynamics, we turn to video data for generating training\ndata pairs, i.e., a source and a target frame. Rather than relying solely on a\nsingle trained model to infer transformations between source and target frames,\nwe incorporate 3D guidance from an Image-to-3D model, which bridges this\nchallenging task by explicitly projecting 2D information into 3D space. We\ndesign a data generation pipeline to ensure high-quality 3D guidance throughout\ntraining. Results show that by integrating these 3D priors, 3D-Fixup\neffectively supports complex, identity coherent 3D-aware edits, achieving\nhigh-quality results and advancing the application of diffusion models in\nrealistic image manipulation.

While future space-based missions will capture a wealth of data on the\nfirst photon ring--including the full angle-dependent diameter, angular\nbrightness profile, and astrometric offset from the $n=0$ ring--our analysis is\nrestricted to using only two angle-dependent diameters to compute its shape\nasymmetry and infer spin. Focusing on low inclinations and moderate-to-high\nspins, we test the method across various emission models, baselines, and noise\nsources, including a mock space-based observation. Although the size of the\n$n=1$ ring depends on the emission model, its interferometric shape remains a\nrobust spin probe at low inclinations. We find that the inferred asymmetry of\nthe $n=1$ image may be biased by the critical curve morphology, and it can be\nheavily skewed by the presence of noise, whether astrophysical or instrumental.\nIn low-noise limits at low viewing inclination, significant contributions from\nthe $n=0$ image at short baselines may lead to a downward bias in asymmetry\nestimates. While our method can estimate high spins in noise-free time-averaged\nimages, increasing the noise and astrophysical variability degrades the\nresulting constraints, providing only lower bounds on the spin when applied to\nsynthetic observed data.

This\nambiguity can lead to issues such as hallucinations and knowledge forgetting,\nwhich significantly impact the reliability of LLMs in high-stakes domains. In\nthis paper, we propose a new inference paradigm that decomposes the complex\ninference process into two distinct and clear actions: (1) memory recall: which\nretrieves relevant knowledge, and (2) reasoning: which performs logical steps\nbased on the recalled knowledge. To facilitate this decomposition, we introduce\ntwo special tokens memory and reason, guiding the model to distinguish between\nsteps that require knowledge retrieval and those that involve reasoning. Our\nexperiment results show that this decomposition not only improves model\nperformance but also enhances the interpretability of the inference process,\nenabling users to identify sources of error and refine model responses\neffectively.

We apply $P$ diverse and\nlearnable transformations to the input, execute forward passes of the model in\nparallel, and dynamically aggregate the $P$ outputs.

For example, ParScale can use up to 22$\\times$\nless memory increase and 6$\\times$ less latency increase compared to parameter\nscaling that achieves the same performance improvement.

Starting from two empirical principles -- that LLMs\nrepresent more things than the model dimensions (widths) they have (i.e.,\nrepresentations are superposed), and that words or concepts in language occur\nwith varying frequencies -- we constructed a toy model to study the loss\nscaling with model size. We found that when superposition is weak, meaning only\nthe most frequent features are represented without interference, the scaling of\nloss with model size depends on the underlying feature frequency; if feature\nfrequencies follow a power law, so does the loss. In contrast, under strong\nsuperposition, where all features are represented but overlap with each other,\nthe loss becomes inversely proportional to the model dimension across a wide\nrange of feature frequency distributions. This robust scaling behavior is\nexplained geometrically: when many more vectors are packed into a lower\ndimensional space, the interference (squared overlaps) between vectors scales\ninversely with that dimension. We then analyzed four families of open-sourced\nLLMs and found that they exhibit strong superposition and quantitatively match\nthe predictions of our toy model. The Chinchilla scaling law turned out to also\nagree with our results. We conclude that representation superposition is an\nimportant mechanism underlying the observed neural scaling laws.

However, existing methods overlook the trade-off between\nreasoning effectiveness and computational efficiency, often encouraging\nunnecessarily long reasoning chains and wasting tokens. To address this, we\npropose Learning to Think (L2T), an information-theoretic reinforcement\nfine-tuning framework for LLMs to make the models achieve optimal reasoning\nwith fewer tokens. Specifically, L2T treats each query-response interaction as\na hierarchical session of multiple episodes and proposes a universal dense\nprocess reward, i.e., quantifies the episode-wise information gain in\nparameters, requiring no extra annotations or task-specific evaluators. We\npropose a method to quickly estimate this reward based on PAC-Bayes bounds and\nthe Fisher information matrix. Theoretical analyses show that it significantly\nreduces computational complexity with high estimation accuracy. By immediately\nrewarding each episode's contribution and penalizing excessive updates, L2T\noptimizes the model via reinforcement learning to maximize the use of each\nepisode and achieve effective updates. Empirical results on various reasoning\nbenchmarks and base models demonstrate the advantage of L2T across different\ntasks, boosting both reasoning effectiveness and efficiency.",

                    "value": "Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex tasks thanks to advances in\nreasoning abilities. However, existing methods overlook the trade-off between\nreasoning effectiveness and computational efficiency, often encouraging\nunnecessarily long reasoning chains and wasting tokens. To address this, we\npropose Learning to Think (L2T), an information-theoretic reinforcement\nfine-tuning framework for LLMs to make the models achieve optimal reasoning\nwith fewer tokens. Specifically, L2T treats each query-response interaction as\na hierarchical session of multiple episodes and proposes a universal dense\nprocess reward, i.e., quantifies the episode-wise information gain in\nparameters, requiring no extra annotations or task-specific evaluators. We\npropose a method to quickly estimate this reward based on PAC-Bayes bounds and\nthe Fisher information matrix. Theoretical analyses show that it significantly\nreduces computational complexity with high estimation accuracy. By immediately\nrewarding each episode's contribution and penalizing excessive updates, L2T\noptimizes the model via reinforcement learning to maximize the use of each\nepisode and achieve effective updates. Empirical results on various reasoning\nbenchmarks and base models demonstrate the advantage of L2T across different\ntasks, boosting both reasoning effectiveness and efficiency."

To address this issue,\nthis paper introduces a new benchmark, PubHealthBench, with over 8000 questions\nfor evaluating LLMs' Multiple Choice Question Answering (MCQA) and free form\nresponses to public health queries. To create PubHealthBench we extract free\ntext from 687 current UK government guidance documents and implement an\nautomated pipeline for generating MCQA samples. Assessing 24 LLMs on\nPubHealthBench we find the latest private LLMs (GPT-4.5, GPT-4.1 and o1) have a\nhigh degree of knowledge, achieving >90% accuracy in the MCQA setup, and\noutperform humans with cursory search engine use. However, in the free form\nsetup we see lower performance with no model scoring >75%. Importantly we find\nin both setups LLMs have higher accuracy on guidance intended for the general\npublic. Therefore, there are promising signs that state of the art (SOTA) LLMs\nare an increasingly accurate source of public health information, but\nadditional safeguards or tools may still be needed when providing free form\nresponses on public health topics.",

To create PubHealthBench we extract free\ntext from 687 current UK government guidance documents and implement an\nautomated pipeline for generating MCQA samples. Assessing 24 LLMs on\nPubHealthBench we find the latest private LLMs (GPT-4.5, GPT-4.1 and o1) have a\nhigh degree of knowledge, achieving >90% accuracy in the MCQA setup, and\noutperform humans with cursory search engine use. However, in the free form\nsetup we see lower performance with no model scoring >75%. Importantly we find\nin both setups LLMs have higher accuracy on guidance intended for the general\npublic. Therefore, there are promising signs that state of the art (SOTA) LLMs\nare an increasingly accurate source of public health information, but\nadditional safeguards or tools may still be needed when providing free form\nresponses on public health topics."

The automated generation of counterfactual\nexamples remains a challenging task even for large language models (LLMs),\ndespite their impressive performance on many tasks. In this paper, we first\nintroduce ZeroCF, a faithful approach for leveraging important words derived\nfrom feature attribution methods to generate counterfactual examples in a\nzero-shot setting. Second, we present a new framework, FitCF, which further\nverifies aforementioned counterfactuals by label flip verification and then\ninserts them as demonstrations for few-shot prompting, outperforming two\nstate-of-the-art baselines. Through ablation studies, we identify the\nimportance of each of FitCF's core components in improving the quality of\ncounterfactuals, as assessed through flip rate, perplexity, and similarity\nmeasures. Furthermore, we show the effectiveness of LIME and Integrated\nGradients as backbone attribution methods for FitCF and find that the number of\ndemonstrations has the largest effect on performance. Finally, we reveal a\nstrong correlation between the faithfulness of feature attribution scores and\nthe quality of generated counterfactuals.",

The automated generation of counterfactual\nexamples remains a challenging task even for large language models (LLMs),\ndespite their impressive performance on many tasks. In this paper, we first\nintroduce ZeroCF, a faithful approach for leveraging important words derived\nfrom feature attribution methods to generate counterfactual examples in a\nzero-shot setting. Second, we present a new framework, FitCF, which further\nverifies aforementioned counterfactuals by label flip verification and then\ninserts them as demonstrations for few-shot prompting, outperforming two\nstate-of-the-art baselines. Through ablation studies, we identify the\nimportance of each of FitCF's core components in improving the quality of\ncounterfactuals, as assessed through flip rate, perplexity, and similarity\nmeasures. Furthermore, we show the effectiveness of LIME and Integrated\nGradients as backbone attribution methods for FitCF and find that the number of\ndemonstrations has the largest effect on performance. Finally, we reveal a\nstrong correlation between the faithfulness of feature attribution scores and\nthe quality of generated counterfactuals."

However, in cross-functional industry teams, this work\nis often stalled by a persistent knowledge handoff challenge: the difficulty of\ntransferring high-level, early-stage technical design rationales from technical\nexperts to non-technical or user-facing roles for ethical evaluation and harm\nidentification. Through literature review and a co-design study with 8\npractitioners, we unpack how this challenge manifests -- technical design\nchoices are rarely handed off in ways that support meaningful engagement by\nnon-technical roles; collaborative workflows lack shared, visual structures to\nsupport mutual understanding; and non-technical practitioners are left without\nscaffolds for systematic harm evaluation. Existing tools like JIRA or Google\nDocs, while useful for product tracking, are ill-suited for supporting joint\nharm identification across roles, often requiring significant extra effort to\nalign understanding. To address this, we developed AI LEGO, a web-based\nprototype that supports cross-functional AI practitioners in effectively\nfacilitating knowledge handoff and identifying harmful design choices in the\nearly design stages. Technical roles use interactive blocks to draft\ndevelopment plans, while non-technical roles engage with those blocks through\nstage-specific checklists and LLM-driven persona simulations to surface\npotential harms. In a study with 18 cross-functional practitioners, AI LEGO\nincreased the volume and likelihood of harms identified compared to baseline\nworksheets. Participants found that its modular structure and persona prompts\nmade harm identification more accessible, fostering clearer and more\ncollaborative RAI practices in early design.",

Existing tools like JIRA or Google\nDocs, while useful for product tracking, are ill-suited for supporting joint\nharm identification across roles, often requiring significant extra effort to\nalign understanding. To address this, we developed AI LEGO, a web-based\nprototype that supports cross-functional AI practitioners in effectively\nfacilitating knowledge handoff and identifying harmful design choices in the\nearly design stages. Technical roles use interactive blocks to draft\ndevelopment plans, while non-technical roles engage with those blocks through\nstage-specific checklists and LLM-driven persona simulations to surface\npotential harms. In a study with 18 cross-functional practitioners, AI LEGO\nincreased the volume and likelihood of harms identified compared to baseline\nworksheets. Participants found that its modular structure and persona prompts\nmade harm identification more accessible, fostering clearer and more\ncollaborative RAI practices in early design."

Integrating clinical evidence into real-time practice is\nchallenging due to the enormous workload, complex professional processes, and\ntime constraints. This highlights the need for tools that automate evidence\nsynthesis to support more efficient and accurate decision making in clinical\nsettings. This study introduces Quicker, an evidence-based clinical decision\nsupport system powered by large language models (LLMs), designed to automate\nevidence synthesis and generate clinical recommendations modeled after standard\nclinical guideline development processes. Quicker implements a fully automated\nchain that covers all phases, from questions to clinical recommendations, and\nfurther enables customized decision-making through integrated tools and\ninteractive user interfaces. To evaluate Quicker's capabilities, we developed\nthe Q2CRBench-3 benchmark dataset, based on clinical guideline development\nrecords for three different diseases. Experimental results highlighted\nQuicker's strong performance, with fine-grained question decomposition tailored\nto user preferences, retrieval sensitivities comparable to human experts, and\nliterature screening performance approaching comprehensive inclusion of\nrelevant studies. In addition, Quicker-assisted evidence assessment effectively\nsupported human reviewers, while Quicker's recommendations were more\ncomprehensive and logically coherent than those of clinicians. In system-level\ntesting, collaboration between a single reviewer and Quicker reduced the time\nrequired for recommendation development to 20-40 minutes. In general, our\nfindings affirm the potential of Quicker to help physicians make quicker and\nmore reliable evidence-based clinical decisions.",

                "summary": "Transformer models rely on self-attention to capture token dependencies but\nface challenges in effectively integrating positional information while\nallowing multi-head attention (MHA) flexibility. Prior methods often model\nsemantic and positional differences disparately or apply uniform positional\nadjustments across heads, potentially limiting representational capacity.

Although significant research has explored the use\nof LLMs for various recommendation tasks, little effort has been dedicated to\nverifying whether they have memorized public recommendation dataset as part of\ntheir training data.

Furthermore, memorization\ncan amplify biases, for example, some popular items may be recommended more\nfrequently than others.\n  In this work, we investigate whether LLMs have memorized public\nrecommendation datasets. Specifically, we examine two model families (GPT and\nLlama) across multiple sizes, focusing on one of the most widely used dataset\nin recommender systems: MovieLens-1M. First, we define dataset memorization as\nthe extent to which item attributes, user profiles, and user-item interactions\ncan be retrieved by prompting the LLMs. Second, we analyze the impact of\nmemorization on recommendation performance. Lastly, we examine whether\nmemorization varies across model families and model sizes.

                "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant improvements in\nreasoning capabilities through supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement\nlearning. However, when training reasoning models, these approaches are\nprimarily applicable to specific domains such as mathematics and programming,\nwhich imposes fundamental constraints on the breadth and scalability of\ntraining data. In contrast, continual pretraining (CPT) offers the advantage of\nnot requiring task-specific signals. Nevertheless, how to effectively\nsynthesize training data for reasoning and how such data affect a wide range of\ndomains remain largely unexplored. This study provides a detailed evaluation of\nReasoning CPT, a form of CPT that uses synthetic data to reconstruct the hidden\nthought processes underlying texts, based on the premise that texts are the\nresult of the author's thinking process. Specifically, we apply Reasoning CPT\nto Gemma2-9B using synthetic data with hidden thoughts derived from STEM and\nLaw corpora, and compare it to standard CPT on the MMLU benchmark. Our analysis\nreveals that Reasoning CPT consistently improves performance across all\nevaluated domains. Notably, reasoning skills acquired in one domain transfer\neffectively to others; the performance gap with conventional methods widens as\nproblem difficulty increases, with gains of up to 8 points on the most\nchallenging problems.

                    "value": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant improvements in\nreasoning capabilities through supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement\nlearning. However, when training reasoning models, these approaches are\nprimarily applicable to specific domains such as mathematics and programming,\nwhich imposes fundamental constraints on the breadth and scalability of\ntraining data. In contrast, continual pretraining (CPT) offers the advantage of\nnot requiring task-specific signals. Nevertheless, how to effectively\nsynthesize training data for reasoning and how such data affect a wide range of\ndomains remain largely unexplored. This study provides a detailed evaluation of\nReasoning CPT, a form of CPT that uses synthetic data to reconstruct the hidden\nthought processes underlying texts, based on the premise that texts are the\nresult of the author's thinking process. Specifically, we apply Reasoning CPT\nto Gemma2-9B using synthetic data with hidden thoughts derived from STEM and\nLaw corpora, and compare it to standard CPT on the MMLU benchmark. Our analysis\nreveals that Reasoning CPT consistently improves performance across all\nevaluated domains. Notably, reasoning skills acquired in one domain transfer\neffectively to others; the performance gap with conventional methods widens as\nproblem difficulty increases, with gains of up to 8 points on the most\nchallenging problems. Furthermore, models trained with hidden thoughts learn to\nadjust the depth of their reasoning according to problem difficulty."

In this study, we\npropose a comprehensive framework that transforms PIML to convex optimization\nto overcome all these limitations, referred to as Convex-PIML. The linear\ncombination of B-splines is utilized to approximate the data, promoting the\nconvexity of the loss function. By replacing the non-convex components of the\nloss function with convex approximations, the problem is further converted into\na sequence of successively refined approximated convex optimization problems.\nThis conversion allows the use of well-established convex optimization\nalgorithms, obtaining solutions effectively and efficiently. Furthermore, an\nadaptive knot optimization method based on error estimate is introduced to\nmitigate the spectral bias issue of PIML, further improving the performance.\nThe proposed theoretically guaranteed framework is tested in scenarios with\ndistinct types of physical prior.

In this study, we\npropose a comprehensive framework that transforms PIML to convex optimization\nto overcome all these limitations, referred to as Convex-PIML. The linear\ncombination of B-splines is utilized to approximate the data, promoting the\nconvexity of the loss function. By replacing the non-convex components of the\nloss function with convex approximations, the problem is further converted into\na sequence of successively refined approximated convex optimization problems.\nThis conversion allows the use of well-established convex optimization\nalgorithms, obtaining solutions effectively and efficiently. Furthermore, an\nadaptive knot optimization method based on error estimate is introduced to\nmitigate the spectral bias issue of PIML, further improving the performance.\nThe proposed theoretically guaranteed framework is tested in scenarios with\ndistinct types of physical prior. The results indicate that optimization\nproblems are effectively solved in these scenarios, highlighting the potential\nof the framework for broad applications."

Our novel dataset construction pipeline results in\nquestions that require complex reasoning, as evidenced by the significant gap\nbetween human and LLM performance. Consequently, XRAG serves as a valuable\nbenchmark for studying LLM reasoning abilities, even before considering the\nadditional cross-lingual complexity. Experimental results on five LLMs uncover\ntwo previously unreported challenges in cross-lingual RAG: 1) in the\nmonolingual retrieval setting, all evaluated models struggle with response\nlanguage correctness; 2) in the multilingual retrieval setting, the main\nchallenge lies in reasoning over retrieved information across languages rather\nthan generation of non-English text.",

Such management is enabled by RICs, which facilitate\nnear-real-time and non-real-time network control through xApps and rApps.\nHowever, they face limitations, including latency overhead in data exchange\nbetween the RAN and RIC, restricting real-time monitoring, and the inability to\naccess user plain data due to privacy and security constraints, hindering use\ncases like beamforming and spectrum classification. In this paper, we leverage\nthe dApps concept to enable real-time RF spectrum classification with LibIQ, a\nnovel library for RF signals that facilitates efficient spectrum monitoring and\nsignal classification by providing functionalities to read I/Q samples as\ntime-series, create datasets and visualize time-series data through plots and\nspectrograms. Thanks to LibIQ, I/Q samples can be efficiently processed to\ndetect external RF signals, which are subsequently classified using a CNN\ninside the library. To achieve accurate spectrum analysis, we created an\nextensive dataset of time-series-based I/Q samples, representing distinct\nsignal types captured using a custom dApp running on a 5G deployment over the\nColosseum network emulator and an OTA testbed. We evaluate our model by\ndeploying LibIQ in heterogeneous scenarios with varying center frequencies,\ntime windows, and external RF signals. In real-time analysis, the model\nclassifies the processed I/Q samples, achieving an average accuracy of\napproximately 97.8\\% in identifying signal types across all scenarios.

Motivated by these insights, we developed PyramidKV, a\nnovel and effective KV cache compression method. This approach dynamically\nadjusts the KV cache size across different layers, allocating more cache in\nlower layers and less in higher ones, diverging from traditional methods that\nmaintain a uniform KV cache size. Our experimental evaluations, utilizing the\nLongBench benchmark, show that PyramidKV matches the performance of models with\na full KV cache while retaining only 12% of the KV cache, thus significantly\nreducing memory usage. In scenarios emphasizing memory efficiency, where only\n0.7% of the KV cache is maintained, PyramidKV surpasses other KV cache\ncompression techniques, achieving up to a 20.5 absolute accuracy improvement on\nTREC dataset. In the Needle-in-a-Haystack experiment, PyramidKV outperforms\ncompeting methods in maintaining long-context comprehension in LLMs; notably,\nretaining just 128 KV cache entries enables the LLAMA-3-70B model to achieve\n100.0 Acc. performance.",

This study explored\nthe potential of large language models (LLMs) to automate OSCE evaluations\nusing the Master Interview Rating Scale (MIRS). We compared the performance of\nfour state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, Llama 3.1, and Gemini 1.5 Pro)\nin evaluating OSCE transcripts across all 28 items of the MIRS under the\nconditions of zero-shot, chain-of-thought (CoT), few-shot, and multi-step\nprompting. The models were benchmarked against a dataset of 10 OSCE cases with\n174 expert consensus scores available. Model performance was measured using\nthree accuracy metrics (exact, off-by-one, thresholded). Averaging across all\nMIRS items and OSCE cases, LLMs performed with low exact accuracy (0.27 to\n0.44), and moderate to high off-by-one accuracy (0.67 to 0.87) and thresholded\naccuracy (0.75 to 0.88). A zero temperature parameter ensured high intra-rater\nreliability ({\\alpha} = 0.98 for GPT-4o). CoT, few-shot, and multi-step\ntechniques proved valuable when tailored to specific assessment items. The\nperformance was consistent across MIRS items, independent of encounter phases\nand communication domains. We demonstrated the feasibility of AI-assisted OSCE\nevaluation and provided benchmarking of multiple LLMs across multiple prompt\ntechniques. Our work provides a baseline performance assessment for LLMs that\nlays a foundation for future research into automated assessment of clinical\ncommunication skills.",

This study serves as a functional prequel to a large-scale field\nstudy in which we examine how students and employees at a German university\nperceive and use their institution's customized LLMaaS compared to ChatGPT. The\ngoals of this prequel are to stimulate discussions on psychological effects of\nLLMaaS customizations and refine our research approach through feedback. Our\nforthcoming findings will deepen the understanding of trust dynamics in LLMs,\nproviding practical guidance for organizations considering LLMaaS deployment."

To address this challenge, we introduce SceneGenAgent, an\nLLM-based agent for generating industrial scenes through C# code. SceneGenAgent\nensures precise layout planning through a structured and calculable format,\nlayout verification, and iterative refinement to meet the quantitative\nrequirements of industrial scenarios. Experiment results demonstrate that LLMs\npowered by SceneGenAgent exceed their original performance, reaching up to\n81.0% success rate in real-world industrial scene generation tasks and\neffectively meeting most scene generation requirements.

Through a single training run using a fixed setup and a\nuser-specified hyperparameter reflecting quantity-quality preference, ControlGS\ncan automatically find desirable quantity-quality trade-off points across\ndiverse scenes, from compact objects to large outdoor scenes. It also\noutperforms baselines by achieving higher rendering quality with fewer\nGaussians, and supports a broad adjustment range with stepless control over the\ntrade-off."

Additionally, we examined the\nalignment between 10 automated evaluation metrics and human judgments. Our\nfindings indicate that while LLMs can generate PLSs that appear\nindistinguishable from human-written ones in subjective evaluations,\nhuman-written PLSs lead to significantly better comprehension. Furthermore,\nautomated evaluation metrics fail to reflect human judgment, calling into\nquestion their suitability for evaluating PLSs. This is the first study to\nsystematically evaluate LLM-generated PLSs based on both reader preferences and\ncomprehension outcomes.

We assessed PLS quality through\nsubjective Likert-scale ratings focusing on simplicity, informativeness,\ncoherence, and faithfulness; and objective multiple-choice comprehension and\nrecall measures of reader understanding. Additionally, we examined the\nalignment between 10 automated evaluation metrics and human judgments. Our\nfindings indicate that while LLMs can generate PLSs that appear\nindistinguishable from human-written ones in subjective evaluations,\nhuman-written PLSs lead to significantly better comprehension. Furthermore,\nautomated evaluation metrics fail to reflect human judgment, calling into\nquestion their suitability for evaluating PLSs. This is the first study to\nsystematically evaluate LLM-generated PLSs based on both reader preferences and\ncomprehension outcomes. Our findings highlight the need for evaluation\nframeworks that move beyond surface-level quality and for generation methods\nthat explicitly optimize for layperson comprehension."

Today's reliance on\na single dominant platform limits portability, creates vendor lock-in, and\nraises barriers for new AI hardware. In this work, we make the case for\ncombining just-in-time (JIT) compilation with kernel parameter autotuning to\nenable portable LLM inference with state-of-the-art performance without code\nchanges. Focusing on flash attention -- a widespread performance critical LLM\nkernel -- we demonstrate that this approach explores up to 15x more kernel\nparameter configurations, produces significantly more diverse code across\nmultiple dimensions, and even outperforms vendor-optimized implementations by\nup to 230%, all while reducing kernel code size by 70x and eliminating manual\ncode optimizations. Our results highlight autotuning as a promising path to\nunlocking model portability across GPU vendors.",

Today's reliance on\na single dominant platform limits portability, creates vendor lock-in, and\nraises barriers for new AI hardware. In this work, we make the case for\ncombining just-in-time (JIT) compilation with kernel parameter autotuning to\nenable portable LLM inference with state-of-the-art performance without code\nchanges. Focusing on flash attention -- a widespread performance critical LLM\nkernel -- we demonstrate that this approach explores up to 15x more kernel\nparameter configurations, produces significantly more diverse code across\nmultiple dimensions, and even outperforms vendor-optimized implementations by\nup to 230%, all while reducing kernel code size by 70x and eliminating manual\ncode optimizations. Our results highlight autotuning as a promising path to\nunlocking model portability across GPU vendors."

The automated generation of counterfactual\nexamples remains a challenging task even for large language models (LLMs),\ndespite their impressive performance on many tasks. In this paper, we first\nintroduce ZeroCF, a faithful approach for leveraging important words derived\nfrom feature attribution methods to generate counterfactual examples in a\nzero-shot setting.

Through ablation studies, we identify the\nimportance of each of FitCF's core components in improving the quality of\ncounterfactuals, as assessed through flip rate, perplexity, and similarity\nmeasures. Furthermore, we show the effectiveness of LIME and Integrated\nGradients as backbone attribution methods for FitCF and find that the number of\ndemonstrations has the largest effect on performance. Finally, we reveal a\nstrong correlation between the faithfulness of feature attribution scores and\nthe quality of generated counterfactuals.",

Second, when used as\nsimulators of a hypothetical population, LLMs correlate with real humans only\nmodestly in the extent to which they agree on the same set of statements. In\nboth cases, smaller, open-weight models are surprisingly more competitive than\nlarger, proprietary frontier models.

                "summary": "Due to their ability to anchor into tall urban landforms, such as lampposts\nor street lights, robotic aerial base stations (RABSs) can create a\nhyper-flexible wireless multi-hop heterogeneous network to meet the forthcoming\ngreen, densified, and dynamic network deployment to support, inter alia, high\ndata rates. In this work, we propose a network infrastructure that can\nconcurrently support the wireless backhaul link capacity and access link\ntraffic demand in the millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequency band. The RABSs\ngrasping locations, resource blocks (RBs) assignment, and route flow control\nare simultaneously optimized to maximize the served traffic demands. Robotic\nbase stations capitalize on the fact that traffic distribution varies\nconsiderably across both time and space within a given geographical area.\nHence, they are able to relocate to suitable locations, i.e., 'follow' the\ntraffic demand as it unfolds to increase the overall network efficiency. To\ntackle the curse of dimensionality of the proposed mixed-integer linear\nproblem, we propose a greedy algorithm to obtain a competitive solution with\nlow computational complexity. Compared to baseline models, which are\nheterogeneous networks with randomly deployed fixed small cells and\npre-allocated RBs for wireless access and backhaul links, a wide set of\nnumerical investigations reveals that robotic base stations could improve the\nserved traffic demand. Specifically, the proposed mode serves at most 65\\% more\ntraffic demand compared to an equal number of deployed fixed small cells.",

                    "value": "Due to their ability to anchor into tall urban landforms, such as lampposts\nor street lights, robotic aerial base stations (RABSs) can create a\nhyper-flexible wireless multi-hop heterogeneous network to meet the forthcoming\ngreen, densified, and dynamic network deployment to support, inter alia, high\ndata rates. In this work, we propose a network infrastructure that can\nconcurrently support the wireless backhaul link capacity and access link\ntraffic demand in the millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequency band. The RABSs\ngrasping locations, resource blocks (RBs) assignment, and route flow control\nare simultaneously optimized to maximize the served traffic demands. Robotic\nbase stations capitalize on the fact that traffic distribution varies\nconsiderably across both time and space within a given geographical area.\nHence, they are able to relocate to suitable locations, i.e., 'follow' the\ntraffic demand as it unfolds to increase the overall network efficiency. To\ntackle the curse of dimensionality of the proposed mixed-integer linear\nproblem, we propose a greedy algorithm to obtain a competitive solution with\nlow computational complexity. Compared to baseline models, which are\nheterogeneous networks with randomly deployed fixed small cells and\npre-allocated RBs for wireless access and backhaul links, a wide set of\nnumerical investigations reveals that robotic base stations could improve the\nserved traffic demand. Specifically, the proposed mode serves at most 65\\% more\ntraffic demand compared to an equal number of deployed fixed small cells."

This work represents the first demonstration\nof step-level autonomy, marking a critical milestone toward autonomous surgical\nsystems for clinical studies. By advancing generalizable autonomy in surgical\nrobotics, our approach brings the field closer to real-world deployment."

Firstly, there are no formal safety guarantees for a\nbehavior cloning policy trained using supervised learning.

To solve these key issues, we show how we can\ninstead combine robot foundation models with geometric inductive biases using\nATACOM, a safety layer placed after the foundation policy that ensures safe\nstate transitions by enforcing action constraints. With this approach, we can\nensure formal safety guarantees for generalist policies without providing\nextensive demonstrations of safe behavior, and without requiring any specific\nfine-tuning for safety.

Although significant research has explored the use\nof LLMs for various recommendation tasks, little effort has been dedicated to\nverifying whether they have memorized public recommendation dataset as part of\ntheir training data. This is undesirable because memorization reduces the\ngeneralizability of research findings, as benchmarking on memorized datasets\ndoes not guarantee generalization to unseen datasets. Furthermore, memorization\ncan amplify biases, for example, some popular items may be recommended more\nfrequently than others.\n  In this work, we investigate whether LLMs have memorized public\nrecommendation datasets. Specifically, we examine two model families (GPT and\nLlama) across multiple sizes, focusing on one of the most widely used dataset\nin recommender systems: MovieLens-1M. First, we define dataset memorization as\nthe extent to which item attributes, user profiles, and user-item interactions\ncan be retrieved by prompting the LLMs. Second, we analyze the impact of\nmemorization on recommendation performance. Lastly, we examine whether\nmemorization varies across model families and model sizes. Our results reveal\nthat all models exhibit some degree of memorization of MovieLens-1M, and that\nrecommendation performance is related to the extent of memorization.

This approach\nenhances the efficiency of inference serving by reducing LLM inference latency\nand costs while preserving generation quality. However, existing speculative\nmethods face critical challenges, including inefficient resource utilization\nand limited draft acceptance, which constrain their scalability and overall\neffectiveness. To overcome these obstacles, we present CoSine, a novel\nspeculative inference system that decouples sequential speculative decoding\nfrom parallel verification, enabling efficient collaboration among multiple\nnodes. Specifically, CoSine routes inference requests to specialized drafters\nbased on their expertise and incorporates a confidence-based token fusion\nmechanism to synthesize outputs from cooperating drafters, ensuring\nhigh-quality draft generation. Additionally, CoSine dynamically orchestrates\nthe execution of speculative decoding and verification in a pipelined manner,\nemploying batch scheduling to selectively group requests and adaptive\nspeculation control to minimize idle periods. By optimizing parallel workflows\nthrough heterogeneous node collaboration, CoSine balances draft generation and\nverification throughput in real-time, thereby maximizing resource utilization.\nExperimental results demonstrate that CoSine achieves superior performance\ncompared to state-of-the-art speculative approaches.

In this paper, we propose VQ-Logits, a novel approach\nthat leverages Vector Quantization (VQ) to drastically reduce the parameter\ncount and computational load of the LLM output layer.

The LLM predicts logits over this compact codebook,\nwhich are then efficiently \"scattered\" to the full vocabulary space using the\nlearned or preassigned mapping. We demonstrate through extensive experiments on\nstandard language modeling benchmarks (e.g., WikiText-103, C4) that VQ-Logits\ncan achieve up to 99% parameter reduction in the output layer and 6x speedup in\nlogit computation, with only a marginal 4% increase in perplexity compared to\nfull softmax baselines.

Prompts are used for two main\npurposes: 1) to provide LLMs with essential information like environments,\ncosts, heuristics, etc.; 2) to communicate human feedback on intermediate\nplanning results to LLMs. This approach takes human feedback on board and\nrenders the entire planning process transparent (akin to a `white box') to\nhumans. Moreover, it facilitates code-free path planning, thereby fostering the\naccessibility and inclusiveness of artificial intelligence techniques to\ncommunities less proficient in coding. Comparative analysis against A* and RL\ndemonstrates that LLM A* exhibits greater efficiency in terms of search space\nand achieves paths comparable to A* while outperforming RL.

While data-driven approaches have shown promise, most existing\nmodels require large amounts of labeled data and struggle to generalize across\ndeployment scenarios and wireless configurations. To address these limitations,\nwe propose a foundation-model-based solution tailored for wireless\nlocalization. We first analyze how different self-supervised learning (SSL)\ntasks acquire general-purpose and task-specific semantic features based on\ninformation bottleneck (IB) theory. Building on this foundation, we design a\npretraining methodology for the proposed Large Wireless Localization Model\n(LWLM). Specifically, we propose an SSL framework that jointly optimizes three\ncomplementary objectives: (i) spatial-frequency masked channel modeling\n(SF-MCM), (ii) domain-transformation invariance (DTI), and (iii)\nposition-invariant contrastive learning (PICL). These objectives jointly\ncapture the underlying semantics of wireless channel from multiple\nperspectives. We further design lightweight decoders for key downstream tasks,\nincluding time-of-arrival (ToA) estimation, angle-of-arrival (AoA) estimation,\nsingle base station (BS) localization, and multiple BS localization.\nComprehensive experimental results confirm that LWLM consistently surpasses\nboth model-based and supervised learning baselines across all localization\ntasks. In particular, LWLM achieves 26.0%--87.5% improvement over transformer\nmodels without pretraining, and exhibits strong generalization under\nlabel-limited fine-tuning and unseen BS configurations, confirming its\npotential as a foundation model for wireless localization.",

We first analyze how different self-supervised learning (SSL)\ntasks acquire general-purpose and task-specific semantic features based on\ninformation bottleneck (IB) theory. Building on this foundation, we design a\npretraining methodology for the proposed Large Wireless Localization Model\n(LWLM). Specifically, we propose an SSL framework that jointly optimizes three\ncomplementary objectives: (i) spatial-frequency masked channel modeling\n(SF-MCM), (ii) domain-transformation invariance (DTI), and (iii)\nposition-invariant contrastive learning (PICL). These objectives jointly\ncapture the underlying semantics of wireless channel from multiple\nperspectives. We further design lightweight decoders for key downstream tasks,\nincluding time-of-arrival (ToA) estimation, angle-of-arrival (AoA) estimation,\nsingle base station (BS) localization, and multiple BS localization.\nComprehensive experimental results confirm that LWLM consistently surpasses\nboth model-based and supervised learning baselines across all localization\ntasks. In particular, LWLM achieves 26.0%--87.5% improvement over transformer\nmodels without pretraining, and exhibits strong generalization under\nlabel-limited fine-tuning and unseen BS configurations, confirming its\npotential as a foundation model for wireless localization."

However, the application of RAG across different MOOCs is limited by\nunstructured learning material. Furthermore, current RAG systems do not\nactively guide learners toward their learning needs. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a Graph RAG pipeline that leverages Educational\nKnowledge Graphs (EduKGs) and Personal Knowledge Graphs (PKGs) to guide\nlearners to understand knowledge concepts in the MOOC platform CourseMapper.\nSpecifically, we implement (1) a PKG-based Question Generation method to\nrecommend personalized questions for learners in context, and (2) an\nEduKG-based Question Answering method that leverages the relationships between\nknowledge concepts in the EduKG to answer learner selected questions. To\nevaluate both methods, we conducted a study with 3 expert instructors on 3\ndifferent MOOCs in the MOOC platform CourseMapper.

We describe an optimal\noutage minimization framework and present solvable heuristics.

Based on the selected demonstrations, we construct context prompts\nand consider DeepSeek-V2 as the LLM for SVA-ICL. Results: We evaluate the\neffectiveness of SVA-ICL using a large-scale dataset comprising 12,071 C/C++\nvulnerabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that SVA-ICL outperforms\nstate-of-the-art SVA baselines in terms of Accuracy, F1-score, and MCC\nmeasures.

                "summary": "Natural language interaction with sensing systems is crucial for addressing\nusers' personal concerns and providing health-related insights into their daily\nlives. When a user asks a question, the system automatically analyzes the full\nhistory of sensor data, extracts relevant information, and generates an\nappropriate response. However, existing systems are limited to short-duration\n(e.g., one minute) or low-frequency (e.g., daily step count) sensor data. In\naddition, they struggle with quantitative questions that require precise\nnumerical answers. In this work, we introduce SensorChat, the first end-to-end\nQA system designed for daily life monitoring using long-duration,\nhigh-frequency time series data. Given raw sensor signals spanning multiple\ndays and a user-defined natural language question, SensorChat generates\nsemantically meaningful responses that directly address user concerns.\nSensorChat effectively handles both quantitative questions that require\nnumerical precision and qualitative questions that require high-level reasoning\nto infer subjective insights. To achieve this, SensorChat uses an innovative\nthree-stage pipeline including question decomposition, sensor data query, and\nanswer assembly. The first and third stages leverage Large Language Models\n(LLMs) to interpret human queries and generate responses. The intermediate\nquerying stage extracts relevant information from the complete sensor data\nhistory. Real-world implementation demonstrate SensorChat's capability for\nreal-time interactions on a cloud server while also being able to run entirely\non edge platforms after quantization. Comprehensive QA evaluations show that\nSensorChat achieves up to 93% higher answer accuracy than state-of-the-art\nsystems on quantitative questions. Additionally, a user study with eight\nvolunteers highlights SensorChat's effectiveness in answering qualitative and\nopen-ended questions.",
