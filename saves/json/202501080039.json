PivotKV\nemploys the obtained keyframes as pivots and conducts KV-Cache compression for\nthe non-pivot tokens with low attention scores, which are derived from the\nlearned prior knowledge of LLMs. Experiments on benchmarks VideoMME, MLVU, and\nLVBench, show that ReTaKe can support 4x longer video sequences with minimal\nperformance loss (<1%) and outperform all similar-size VideoLLMs with 3%-5%,\neven surpassing or on par with much larger ones.

However, its iterative denoising\nintroduces high computational costs and slows generation speed, limiting\nbroader adoption. The community has made numerous efforts to reduce this\ncomputational burden, with methods like feature caching attracting attention\ndue to their effectiveness and simplicity. Nonetheless, simply reusing features\ncomputed at previous timesteps causes the features across adjacent timesteps to\nbecome similar, reducing the dynamics of features over time and ultimately\ncompromising the quality of generated images. In this paper, we introduce a\ndynamics-aware token pruning (DaTo) approach that addresses the limitations of\nfeature caching. DaTo selectively prunes tokens with lower dynamics, allowing\nonly high-dynamic tokens to participate in self-attention layers, thereby\nextending feature dynamics across timesteps. DaTo combines feature caching with\ntoken pruning in a training-free manner, achieving both temporal and token-wise\ninformation reuse. Applied to Stable Diffusion on the ImageNet, our approach\ndelivered a 9$\\times$ speedup while reducing FID by 0.33, indicating enhanced\nimage quality.

GPUs are known for their strong\narithmetic computing capabilities and are highly suited for BLAS operations.\nHowever, porting code to GPUs often requires significant effort, especially for\nlarge, complex codes or legacy codes, even for BLAS-heavy applications. While\nvarious tools exist to automatically offload BLAS to GPUs, they are often\nimpractical due to the high costs associated with mandatory data transfers. The\nadvent of unified memory architectures in recent GPU designs, such as the\nNVIDIA Grace-Hopper, allows cache-coherent memory access across all types of\nmemory for both CPU and GPU, potentially eliminating the bottlenecks faced in\nconventional architectures. This breakthrough paves the way for innovative\napplication developments and porting strategies. Building on our preliminary\nwork demonstrating the potential of automatic *gemm offload, this paper extends\nthe framework to all level-3 BLAS operations and introduces SCILIB-Accel, a\nnovel tool for automatic BLAS offload. SCILIB-Accel leverages the memory\ncoherency in Grace-Hopper and introduces a Device First-Use data movement\npolicy inspired by the OpenMP First-Touch approach in multi-socket CPU\nprogramming, minimizing CPU-GPU data transfers for typical scientific computing\ncodes. Additionally, utilizing dynamic binary instrumentation, the tool\nintercepts BLAS symbols directly from a CPU binary, requiring no code\nmodifications or recompilation. SCILIB-Accel has been evaluated using multiple\nquantum physics codes on up to a few hundred GPU nodes, yielding promising\nspeedups. Notably, for the LSMS method in the MuST suite, a 3x speedup was\nachieved on Grace-Hopper compared to Grace-Grace.",

While traditional FGIR\ndeals with classifying different species, UFGIR goes beyond by classifying\nsub-categories within a species such as cultivars of a plant. In recent times\nthe usage of Vision Transformer-based backbones has allowed methods to obtain\noutstanding recognition performances in this task but this comes at a\nsignificant cost in terms of computation specially since this task\nsignificantly benefits from incorporating higher resolution images.

However, dropping tokens leads to loss of essential information for\nfine-grained categories, specially as the token keep rate is reduced.\nTherefore, to counteract the loss of information brought by the usage of token\nreduction we propose a novel Cross-Layer Aggregation Classification Head and a\nCross-Layer Cache mechanism to recover and access information from previous\nlayers in later locations. Extensive experiments covering more than 2000 runs\nacross diverse settings including 5 datasets, 9 backbones, 7 token reduction\nmethods, 5 keep rates, and 2 image sizes demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nproposed plug-and-play modules and allow us to push the boundaries of accuracy\nvs cost for UFGIR by reducing the kept tokens to extremely low ratios of up to\n10\\% while maintaining a competitive accuracy to state-of-the-art models.

This observation suggests that information of\nthe segments between these separator tokens can be effectively condensed into\nthe separator tokens themselves without significant information loss. Guided by\nthis insight, we introduce SepLLM, a plug-and-play framework that accelerates\ninference by compressing these segments and eliminating redundant tokens.\nAdditionally, we implement efficient kernels for training acceleration.\nExperimental results across training-free, training-from-scratch, and\npost-training settings demonstrate SepLLM's effectiveness. Notably, using the\nLlama-3-8B backbone, SepLLM achieves over 50% reduction in KV cache on the\nGSM8K-CoT benchmark while maintaining comparable performance.

In this work, we propose LoL-PIM which is a multi-node PIM\narchitecture that accelerates long context LLM through hardware-software\nco-design. In particular, we propose how pipeline parallelism can be exploited\nacross a multi-PIM module while a direct PIM access (DPA) controller (or DMA\nfor PIM) is proposed that enables dynamic PIM memory management and results in\nefficient PIM utilization across a diverse range of context length. We\ndeveloped an MLIR-based compiler for LoL-PIM extending a commercial PIM-based\ncompiler where the software modifications were implemented and evaluated, while\nthe hardware changes were modeled in the simulator. Our evaluations demonstrate\nthat LoL-PIM significantly improves throughput and reduces latency for\nlong-context LLM inference, outperforming both multi-GPU and GPU-PIM systems\n(up to 8.54x and 16.0x speedup, respectively), thereby enabling more efficient\ndeployment of LLMs in real-world applications.",

In this work, we propose LoL-PIM which is a multi-node PIM\narchitecture that accelerates long context LLM through hardware-software\nco-design. In particular, we propose how pipeline parallelism can be exploited\nacross a multi-PIM module while a direct PIM access (DPA) controller (or DMA\nfor PIM) is proposed that enables dynamic PIM memory management and results in\nefficient PIM utilization across a diverse range of context length. We\ndeveloped an MLIR-based compiler for LoL-PIM extending a commercial PIM-based\ncompiler where the software modifications were implemented and evaluated, while\nthe hardware changes were modeled in the simulator. Our evaluations demonstrate\nthat LoL-PIM significantly improves throughput and reduces latency for\nlong-context LLM inference, outperforming both multi-GPU and GPU-PIM systems\n(up to 8.54x and 16.0x speedup, respectively), thereby enabling more efficient\ndeployment of LLMs in real-world applications."

As VR applications and systems\nprogress, the need to meet strict latency and Quality of Experience (QoE)\nrequirements is increasingly evident. In the context of VR, traditional cloud\narchitectures (e.g., remote AWS S3 for content delivery) often struggle to meet\nthese demands, especially for users of the same application in different\nlocations.

In this work, we\ndemonstrate that a frozen LLM can be augmented with an offline coprocessor that\noperates on the model's key-value (kv) cache. This coprocessor augments the\ncache with a set of latent embeddings designed to improve the fidelity of\nsubsequent decoding. We train this coprocessor using the language modeling loss\nfrom the decoder on standard pretraining data, while keeping the decoder itself\nfrozen. This approach enables the model to learn, in an end-to-end\ndifferentiable fashion, how to distill additional computation into its\nkv-cache. Because the decoder remains unchanged, the coprocessor can operate\noffline and asynchronously, and the language model can function normally if the\ncoprocessor is unavailable or if a given cache is deemed not to require extra\ncomputation. We show experimentally that when a cache is augmented, the decoder\nachieves lower perplexity on numerous subsequent tokens.

However,\nmost existing research treats satellites merely as transparent forwarding nodes\nand overlooks their potential caching capabilities to enhance IFC data rates.\nIn this article, we explore an IFC-oriented SAGIN where satellites and ground\nstations (GSs) work together to transmit content to airborne passengers,\nthereby facilitating airborne communication. By categorizing files into cached\n(instantly accessible via satellites) and non-cached files (available only\nthrough GSs), this article pioneers the integration of multiple inter-satellite\nlinks (ISLs) into the IFC framework, thus innovating the content delivery\nprocess for both types of files. To minimize the average delay of content\ndelivery, we formulate the corresponding optimization problems: 1) For cached\nfiles, we propose an exact penalty-based method to determine the satellite\nassociation scheme. 2) For non-cached files, we present an efficient algorithm\nbased on alternating optimization to jointly optimize satellite association and\nGS bandwidth allocation. Our proposed framework is low in complexity, paving\nthe way for high-speed Internet connectivity for aviation passengers.

The Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB)\naccelerates address translation by caching frequently accessed mappings, but\nTLB misses lead to costly page walks. Hardware and software techniques address\nthis challenge. Hardware approaches enhance TLB reach through system-level\nsupport, while software optimizations include TLB prefetching, replacement\npolicies, superpages, and page size adjustments. Prefetching Page Table Entries\n(PTEs) for future accesses reduces bottlenecks but may incur overhead from\nincorrect predictions.

Our development process encompasses\ncomprehensive pre-training, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and reinforcement\nlearning from human feedback (RLHF), where we devise deliberate strategies for\nmulti-stage training, synthetic data construction, and reward modeling.\nFurthermore, we implement RAISE (Responsible AI Safety Engine), a\nfour-component framework to address safety issues across pre-training,\npost-training, and serving phases. Empowered by our scalable super-computing\ninfrastructure, all these innovations substantially reduce training, deployment\nand inference costs while maintaining high-performance standards. With further\nevaluations on public academic benchmarks, Yi-Lightning demonstrates\ncompetitive performance against top-tier LLMs, while we observe a notable\ndisparity between traditional, static benchmark results and real-world, dynamic\nhuman preferences.

FDIP is\ndriven by the Branch Prediction Unit (BPU), relying on the BPU's accuracy and\nbranch target tracking structures to speculatively fetch instructions into the\nInstruction Cache (L1I). As data center applications become more complex, their\ncode footprints also grow, resulting in an increase in Branch Target Buffer\n(BTB) misses. FDIP can alleviate L1I cache misses, but when it encounters a BTB\nmiss, the BPU may not identify the current instruction as a branch to FDIP.\nThis can prevent FDIP from prefetching or cause it to speculate down the wrong\npath, further polluting the L1I cache. We observe that the vast majority, 75%,\nof BTB-missing, unidentified branches are actually present in instruction cache\nlines that FDIP has previously fetched but, these missing branches have not yet\nbeen decoded and inserted into the BTB. This is because the instruction line is\ndecoded from an entry point (which is the target of the previous taken branch)\ntill an exit point (the taken branch). Branch instructions present in the\nignored portion of the cache line we call them \"Shadow Branches\". Here we\npresent Skeia, a novel shadow branch decoding technique that identifies and\ndecodes unused bytes in cache lines fetched by FDIP, inserting them into a\nShadow Branch Buffer (SBB). The SBB is accessed in parallel with the BTB,\nallowing FDIP to speculate despite a BTB miss. With a minimal storage state of\n12.25KB, Skeia delivers a geomean speedup of ~5.7% over an 8K-entry BTB (78KB)\nand ~2% versus adding an equal amount of state to the BTB across 16 front-end\nbound applications. Since many branches stored in the SBB are unique compared\nto those in a similarly sized BTB, we consistently observe greater performance\ngains with Skeia across all examined sizes until saturation.",

In this paper,\nwe carefully characterize C3 in ML on GPUs, which are most widely deployed for\nML training and inference. We observe that while C3 leads to performance\nuplifts, the uplifts are far lower than ideal speedups (serial computation and\ncommunication versus maximum of computation or communication; all times from\nisolated executions). C3 on average achieves only 21% of ideal speedup, this is\ndue to known challenges of compute and memory interference between concurrent\nGPU kernels (that is, sharing of GPU's compute units, caches and HBM).\n  To attain better performance for C3, first, we evaluate dual strategies of\nschedule prioritization and careful resource partitioning of compute units on\nGPUs to push performance attained with C3 (on average 42% of ideal speedup). We\nalso provide heuristics that can guide a runtime while employing these\nstrategies. To further enhance C3 performance, we propose to mitigate C3\ninterference by offloading communication tasks to the GPU's DMA engines. To\nthis end, we build Concurrent Communication CoLlectives (ConCCL)\nproof-of-concepts that harness DMA engines for communication. We show how\nConCCL considerably closes the gap between realized and ideal speedup for C3\n(on average 72% of ideal speedup is realized, up to 1.67x speedup). Overall,\nour work makes a strong case for GPU DMA engine advancements to better support\nC3 on GPUs.",

We observe that while C3 leads to performance\nuplifts, the uplifts are far lower than ideal speedups (serial computation and\ncommunication versus maximum of computation or communication; all times from\nisolated executions). C3 on average achieves only 21% of ideal speedup, this is\ndue to known challenges of compute and memory interference between concurrent\nGPU kernels (that is, sharing of GPU's compute units, caches and HBM).\n  To attain better performance for C3, first, we evaluate dual strategies of\nschedule prioritization and careful resource partitioning of compute units on\nGPUs to push performance attained with C3 (on average 42% of ideal speedup). We\nalso provide heuristics that can guide a runtime while employing these\nstrategies. To further enhance C3 performance, we propose to mitigate C3\ninterference by offloading communication tasks to the GPU's DMA engines. To\nthis end, we build Concurrent Communication CoLlectives (ConCCL)\nproof-of-concepts that harness DMA engines for communication. We show how\nConCCL considerably closes the gap between realized and ideal speedup for C3\n(on average 72% of ideal speedup is realized, up to 1.67x speedup). Overall,\nour work makes a strong case for GPU DMA engine advancements to better support\nC3 on GPUs."

However, most studies focus on addressing only one of these\nbottlenecks and do not adequately support dynamic adjustment of sparsity\nconcerning distinct layers or tasks. In this paper, we present ZipVL, an\nefficient inference framework designed for LVLMs through a dynamic ratio\nallocation strategy of important tokens. This ratio is adaptively determined\nbased on the layer-specific distribution of attention scores, rather than fixed\nhyper-parameters, thereby improving efficiency for less complex tasks while\nmaintaining high performance for more challenging ones. Then we select\nimportant tokens based on their normalized attention scores and perform sparse\nattention mechanism solely on those important tokens, reducing the latency in\nthe prefill phase. Tokens deemed less important will be discarded to reduce KV\ncache size, alleviating the memory bottleneck in the decoding phase. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that ZipVL can accelerate the prefill phase by\n2.3$\\times$ and improve decoding throughput by 2.8$\\times$, with a minimal\naccuracy reduction of only 0.5\\% on VQAv2 benchmark over LLaVA-Next-13B model,\neffectively enhancing the generation efficiency of LVLMs.",

To address these issues, we develop Vivar, a\nnovel AR system that integrates multi-modal sensor data and presents 3D\nvolumetric content for visualization. In particular, we introduce a cross-modal\nembedding approach that maps sensor data into a pre-trained visual embedding\nspace through barycentric interpolation.

In addition,\nVivar leverages latent reuse and caching strategies to accelerate 2D and AR\ncontent generation. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our system\nachieves 11$\\times$ latency reduction without compromising quality.

Our architecture combines this efficient scaling with\nnoise-conditioned self-attention mechanism, enabling more effective denoising\nacross different noise levels. MoDE achieves state-of-the-art performance on\n134 tasks in four established imitation learning benchmarks (CALVIN and\nLIBERO). Notably, by pretraining MoDE on diverse robotics data, we achieve 4.01\non CALVIN ABC and 0.95 on LIBERO-90. It surpasses both CNN-based and\nTransformer Diffusion Policies by an average of 57% across 4 benchmarks, while\nusing 90% fewer FLOPs and fewer active parameters compared to default Diffusion\nTransformer architectures. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive ablations on\nMoDE's components, providing insights for designing efficient and scalable\nTransformer architectures for Diffusion Policies. Code and demonstrations are\navailable at https://mbreuss.github.io/MoDE_Diffusion_Policy/."

As LLM inference scales towards\nmultiple GPUs and even multiple compute nodes, various coordination patterns,\nsuch as prefill-decode disaggregation and context migration, arise in serving\nsystems. Most inference services today expose a coarse-grained request-level\nAPI with a pre-configured coordination strategy, limiting the ability to\ncustomize and dynamically reconfigure the coordination. In this paper, we\npropose LLM microserving, a multi-level architecture for structuring and\nprogramming LLM inference services. We introduces simple yet effective\nmicroserving APIs to support fine-grained sub-request level actions. A\nprogrammable router transforms user requests into sub-request calls, enabling\nthe dynamic reconfiguration of serving patterns. To support diverse execution\npatterns, we develop a unified KV cache interface that handles various KV\ncompute, transfer, and reuse scenarios. Our evaluation shows that LLM\nmicroserving can be reconfigured to support multiple disaggregation\norchestration strategies in a few lines of Python code while maintaining\nstate-of-the-art performance for LLM inference tasks. Additionally, it allows\nus to explore new strategy variants that reduce up to 47% of job completion\ntime compared to the existing strategies.",

The dynamic arrival and departure of connection requests in\noptical networks result in particular central links experiencing more traffic\nand congestion than non-central links. The occurrence of congested links leads\nto service blocking despite the availability of resources within the network,\nrestricting the efficient utilization of network resources. The available\nalgorithms in the literature that aim to balance load among network links offer\na trade-off between blocking performance and algorithmic complexity, thus\nincreasing service provisioning time. This work proposes a dynamic\nrouting-based congestion-aware routing, modulation, core, and spectrum\nassignment (RMCSA) algorithm for space division multiplexing elastic optical\nnetworks (SDM-EONs). The algorithm finds alternative candidate paths based on\nreal-time link occupancy metrics to minimize blocking due to link congestion\nunder dynamic traffic scenarios. As a result, the algorithm reduces the\nformation of congestion hotspots in the network owing to link-betweenness\ncentrality. We have performed extensive simulations using two realistic network\ntopologies to compare the performance of the proposed algorithm with relevant\nRMCSA algorithms available in the literature. The simulation results verify the\nsuperior performance of our proposed algorithm compared to the benchmark Yen's\nK-shortest paths and K-Disjoint shortest paths RMCSA algorithms in connection\nblocking ratio and spectrum utilization efficiency. To expedite the\nroute-finding process, we present a novel caching strategy that allows the\nproposed algorithm to demonstrate a much-reduced service delay time compared to\nthe recently developed adaptive link weight-based load-balancing RMCSA\nalgorithm.",

To expedite the\nroute-finding process, we present a novel caching strategy that allows the\nproposed algorithm to demonstrate a much-reduced service delay time compared to\nthe recently developed adaptive link weight-based load-balancing RMCSA\nalgorithm."

This has become of paramount importance in the post-pandemic era.\nChallenges arise when exponential content volume growth and scalability across\ndifferent geographic locations are required. This paper investigates\ndata-driven evaluations of CDN algorithms in dynamic server selection for\nlatency reduction, bandwidth throttling for efficient resource management,\nreal-time Round Trip Time analysis for adaptive routing, and programmatic\nnetwork delay simulation to emulate various conditions. Key performance\nmetrics, such as round-trip time (RTT) and CPU usage, are carefully analyzed to\nevaluate scalability and algorithmic efficiency through two experimental\nsetups: a constrained edge-like local system and a scalable FABRIC testbed. The\nstatistical validation of RTT trends, alongside CPU utilization, is presented\nin the results. The optimization process reveals significant trade-offs between\nscalability and resource consumption, providing actionable insights for\neffectively deploying and enhancing CDN algorithms in edge and distributed\ncomputing environments.",

This has become of paramount importance in the post-pandemic era.\nChallenges arise when exponential content volume growth and scalability across\ndifferent geographic locations are required. This paper investigates\ndata-driven evaluations of CDN algorithms in dynamic server selection for\nlatency reduction, bandwidth throttling for efficient resource management,\nreal-time Round Trip Time analysis for adaptive routing, and programmatic\nnetwork delay simulation to emulate various conditions. Key performance\nmetrics, such as round-trip time (RTT) and CPU usage, are carefully analyzed to\nevaluate scalability and algorithmic efficiency through two experimental\nsetups: a constrained edge-like local system and a scalable FABRIC testbed. The\nstatistical validation of RTT trends, alongside CPU utilization, is presented\nin the results. The optimization process reveals significant trade-offs between\nscalability and resource consumption, providing actionable insights for\neffectively deploying and enhancing CDN algorithms in edge and distributed\ncomputing environments."

However, inherent conflicts exist among the desired\ncapabilities. The Decision and Reaction require a contrary Perception scale and\ngrain, and the autoregressive decoding blocks the real-time Perception and\nDecision during the Reaction. To unify the conflicted capabilities within a\nharmonious system, we present Dispider, a system that disentangles Perception,\nDecision, and Reaction. Dispider features a lightweight proactive streaming\nvideo processing module that tracks the video stream and identifies optimal\nmoments for interaction. Once the interaction is triggered, an asynchronous\ninteraction module provides detailed responses, while the processing module\ncontinues to monitor the video in the meantime. Our disentangled and\nasynchronous design ensures timely, contextually accurate, and computationally\nefficient responses, making Dispider ideal for active real-time interaction for\nlong-duration video streams. Experiments show that Dispider not only maintains\nstrong performance in conventional video QA tasks, but also significantly\nsurpasses previous online models in streaming scenario responses, thereby\nvalidating the effectiveness of our architecture.

Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained\npopularity for code generation, including the automated creation of test cases.\nHowever, these LLMs are often trained on vast amounts of publicly available\ncode, which may include test cases that do not adhere to best practices and may\neven contain test smells (anti-patterns). To address this issue, we propose a\nnovel technique called Reinforcement Learning from Static Quality Metrics\n(RLSQM). To begin, we analyze the anti-patterns generated by the LLM and show\nthat LLMs can generate undesirable test smells. Thus, we train specific reward\nmodels for each static quality metric, then utilize Proximal Policy\nOptimization (PPO) to train models for optimizing a single quality metric at a\ntime. Furthermore, we amalgamate these rewards into a unified reward model\naimed at capturing different best practices and quality aspects of tests. By\ncomparing RL-trained models with those trained using supervised learning, we\nprovide insights into how reliably utilize RL to improve test generation\nquality and into the effects of various training strategies. Our experimental\nresults demonstrate that the RL-optimized model consistently generated\nhigh-quality test cases compared to the base LLM, improving the model by up to\n21%, and successfully generates nearly 100% syntactically correct code.

In this work, we conduct an experimental\nstudy to explore applicability of LLMs for configuring, annotating,\ntranslating, explaining, and generating scientific workflows. We use 5\ndifferent workflow specific experiments and evaluate several open- and\nclosed-source language models using state-of-the-art workflow systems. Our\nstudies reveal that LLMs often struggle with workflow related tasks due to\ntheir lack of knowledge of scientific workflows. We further observe that the\nperformance of LLMs varies across experiments and workflow systems.

In this work, we conduct an experimental\nstudy to explore applicability of LLMs for configuring, annotating,\ntranslating, explaining, and generating scientific workflows. We use 5\ndifferent workflow specific experiments and evaluate several open- and\nclosed-source language models using state-of-the-art workflow systems. Our\nstudies reveal that LLMs often struggle with workflow related tasks due to\ntheir lack of knowledge of scientific workflows. We further observe that the\nperformance of LLMs varies across experiments and workflow systems.

It is anticipated that ZSM networks will be able to\nsupport LLMs as a service, as they provide ultra reliable low-latency\ncommunications and closed loop massive connectivity. However, LLMs are\nvulnerable to data and model privacy issues that affect the trustworthiness of\nLLMs to be deployed for user-based services. In this paper, we explore the\nsecurity vulnerabilities associated with fine-tuning LLMs in ZSM networks, in\nparticular the membership inference attack. We define the characteristics of an\nattack network that can perform a membership inference attack if the attacker\nhas access to the fine-tuned model for the downstream task. We show that the\nmembership inference attacks are effective for any downstream task, which can\nlead to a personal data breach when using LLM as a service. The experimental\nresults show that the attack success rate of maximum 92% can be achieved on\nnamed entity recognition task.

In\nthis study, we focus on auditing black-box LLMs without access to their\nparameters, only to the provided service. We treat this type of auditing as a\nblack-box optimization problem where the goal is to automatically uncover\ninput-output pairs of the target LLMs that exhibit illegal, immoral, or unsafe\nbehaviors. For instance, we may seek a non-toxic input that the target LLM\nresponds to with a toxic output or an input that induces the hallucinative\nresponse from the target LLM containing politically sensitive individuals. This\nblack-box optimization is challenging due to the scarcity of feasible points,\nthe discrete nature of the prompt space, and the large search space. To address\nthese challenges, we propose Curiosity-Driven Auditing for Large Language\nModels (CALM), which uses intrinsically motivated reinforcement learning to\nfinetune an LLM as the auditor agent to uncover potential harmful and biased\ninput-output pairs of the target LLM. CALM successfully identifies derogatory\ncompletions involving celebrities and uncovers inputs that elicit specific\nnames under the black-box setting. This work offers a promising direction for\nauditing black-box LLMs. Our code is available at\nhttps://github.com/x-zheng16/CALM.git.",

This\nblack-box optimization is challenging due to the scarcity of feasible points,\nthe discrete nature of the prompt space, and the large search space. To address\nthese challenges, we propose Curiosity-Driven Auditing for Large Language\nModels (CALM), which uses intrinsically motivated reinforcement learning to\nfinetune an LLM as the auditor agent to uncover potential harmful and biased\ninput-output pairs of the target LLM. CALM successfully identifies derogatory\ncompletions involving celebrities and uncovers inputs that elicit specific\nnames under the black-box setting. This work offers a promising direction for\nauditing black-box LLMs. Our code is available at\nhttps://github.com/x-zheng16/CALM.git."

When presented with a query, RAG\nselects the most semantically similar texts from its knowledge bases and uses\nthem as context for the LLMs to generate more accurate responses. RAG also\ncreates a new attack surface, especially since RAG databases are frequently\nsourced from public domains.

In this paper, we unveil a more\nrealistic and threatening scenario: opinion manipulation for controversial\ntopics against RAG.

Modern tooling and simulation platforms,\nsuch as NVIDIA Isaac Sim, have been enabling such advances.

We benchmark\nend-to-end policies with the state-of-the-art Nav2, navigation stack in Robot\nOperating System (ROS). We also cover the sim-to-real transfer process by\ndemonstrating zero-shot transferability of policies trained in the Isaac\nsimulator to real-world robots.

Finally, the benchmarks demonstrate comparable performance to Nav2,\nopening the door to quick deployment of state-of-the-art end-to-end local\nplanners for custom robot platforms, but importantly furthering the\npossibilities by expanding the state and action spaces or task definitions for\nmore complex missions. Overall, with this article we introduce the most\nimportant steps, and aspects to consider, in deploying RL policies for local\npath planning and obstacle avoidance with Isaac Sim training, Gazebo testing,\nand ROS 2 for real-time inference in real robots.

                "summary": "Recently, given the docstring for the target problem and the target function\nsignature, large language models (LLMs) have been used not only to generate\nsource code, but also to generate test cases, consisting of test inputs and\nassertions (e.g., in the form of checking an actual output against the expected\noutput). However, as shown by our empirical study on assertions generated by\nfour LLMs for the HumanEval benchmark, over 62% of the generated assertions are\nincorrect (i.e., failed on the ground-truth problem solution). To detect\nincorrect assertions (given the docstring and the target function signature\nalong with a sample of example inputs and outputs), in this paper, we propose a\nnew approach named DeCon to effectively detect incorrect assertions via\nLLM-generated postconditions for the target problem (a postcondition is a\npredicate that must always be true just after the execution of the ground-truth\nproblem solution). Our approach requires a small set of I/O examples (i.e., a\nsample of example inputs and outputs) for the target problem (e.g., the I/O\nexamples included in the docstring for a target problem in HumanEval). We use\nthe given I/O examples to filter out those LLM-generated postconditions that\nare violated by at least one given I/O example. We then use the remaining\npostconditions to detect incorrect assertions as those assertions that violate\nat least one remaining postcondition. Experimental results show that DeCon can\ndetect averagely more than 64% (63% and 65.5% detected by GPT-3.5 and GPT-4,\nrespectively) incorrect assertions generated by four state-of-the-art LLMs, and\nDeCon can also improve the effectiveness of these LLMs in code generation by 4%\nin terms of Pass@1. In addition, although DeCon might filter out correct\nassertions, the fault-finding ability of the remaining correct assertions\ndecreases only slightly.",

Existing benchmarks like MMLU, C-Eval,\nand HumanEval assess general LLM performance but lack focus on specific expert\ndomains such as cybersecurity. Previous attempts to create cybersecurity\ndatasets have faced limitations, including insufficient data volume and a\nreliance on multiple-choice questions (MCQs).

These images encompassing common ultrasound imaging artifacts are\nannotated by professional ultrasound experts and classified into three quality\nlevels: high, medium, and low.

                "summary": "The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into recommender systems has\nled to substantial performance improvements. However, this often comes at the\ncost of diminished recommendation diversity, which can negatively impact user\nsatisfaction. To address this issue, controllable recommendation has emerged as\na promising approach, allowing users to specify their preferences and receive\nrecommendations that meet their diverse needs. Despite its potential, existing\ncontrollable recommender systems frequently rely on simplistic mechanisms, such\nas a single prompt, to regulate diversity-an approach that falls short of\ncapturing the full complexity of user preferences. In response to these\nlimitations, we propose DLCRec, a novel framework designed to enable\nfine-grained control over diversity in LLM-based recommendations. Unlike\ntraditional methods, DLCRec adopts a fine-grained task decomposition strategy,\nbreaking down the recommendation process into three sequential sub-tasks: genre\nprediction, genre filling, and item prediction. These sub-tasks are trained\nindependently and inferred sequentially according to user-defined control\nnumbers, ensuring more precise control over diversity. Furthermore, the\nscarcity and uneven distribution of diversity-related user behavior data pose\nsignificant challenges for fine-tuning. To overcome these obstacles, we\nintroduce two data augmentation techniques that enhance the model's robustness\nto noisy and out-of-distribution data. These techniques expose the model to a\nbroader range of patterns, improving its adaptability in generating\nrecommendations with varying levels of diversity. Our extensive empirical\nevaluation demonstrates that DLCRec not only provides precise control over\ndiversity but also outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple\nrecommendation scenarios.",

To address these issues, we propose an Emotion\nContext Learning method (E-ICL) on fine-grained emotion recognition.

Training a video Diffusion\nTransformer (DiT) directly to control 4D content requires expensive multi-view\nvideos. Inspired by Monocular Dynamic novel View Synthesis (MDVS) that\noptimizes a 4D representation and renders videos according to different 4D\nelements, such as camera pose and object motion editing, we bring pseudo 4D\nGaussian fields to video generation. Specifically, we propose a novel framework\nthat constructs a pseudo 4D Gaussian field with dense 3D point tracking and\nrenders the Gaussian field for all video frames. Then we finetune a pretrained\nDiT to generate videos following the guidance of the rendered video, dubbed as\nGS-DiT. To boost the training of the GS-DiT, we also propose an efficient Dense\n3D Point Tracking (D3D-PT) method for the pseudo 4D Gaussian field\nconstruction. Our D3D-PT outperforms SpatialTracker, the state-of-the-art\nsparse 3D point tracking method, in accuracy and accelerates the inference\nspeed by two orders of magnitude. During the inference stage, GS-DiT can\ngenerate videos with the same dynamic content while adhering to different\ncamera parameters, addressing a significant limitation of current video\ngeneration models. GS-DiT demonstrates strong generalization capabilities and\nextends the 4D controllability of Gaussian splatting to video generation beyond\njust camera poses. It supports advanced cinematic effects through the\nmanipulation of the Gaussian field and camera intrinsics, making it a powerful\ntool for creative video production.

While most\nmethods for paired right-censored outcomes allow determining an overall\ntreatment effect over the course of follow-up, they generally lack in providing\ndetailed insights into how the effect changes over time. To address this gap,\nwe propose novel tests for paired right-censored outcomes using randomization\ninference. We further extend our tests to matched observational studies by\ndeveloping corresponding sensitivity analysis methods to take into account\ndepartures from randomization. Simulations demonstrate the robustness of our\napproach against various non-proportional hazards alternatives, including a\ncrossing survival curves scenario. We demonstrate the application of our\nmethods using a matched observational study from the Korean Longitudinal Study\nof Aging (KLoSA) data, focusing on the effect of social engagement on survival.",

While most\nmethods for paired right-censored outcomes allow determining an overall\ntreatment effect over the course of follow-up, they generally lack in providing\ndetailed insights into how the effect changes over time. To address this gap,\nwe propose novel tests for paired right-censored outcomes using randomization\ninference. We further extend our tests to matched observational studies by\ndeveloping corresponding sensitivity analysis methods to take into account\ndepartures from randomization. Simulations demonstrate the robustness of our\napproach against various non-proportional hazards alternatives, including a\ncrossing survival curves scenario. We demonstrate the application of our\nmethods using a matched observational study from the Korean Longitudinal Study\nof Aging (KLoSA) data, focusing on the effect of social engagement on survival."

Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained\npopularity for code generation, including the automated creation of test cases.\nHowever, these LLMs are often trained on vast amounts of publicly available\ncode, which may include test cases that do not adhere to best practices and may\neven contain test smells (anti-patterns). To address this issue, we propose a\nnovel technique called Reinforcement Learning from Static Quality Metrics\n(RLSQM). To begin, we analyze the anti-patterns generated by the LLM and show\nthat LLMs can generate undesirable test smells. Thus, we train specific reward\nmodels for each static quality metric, then utilize Proximal Policy\nOptimization (PPO) to train models for optimizing a single quality metric at a\ntime. Furthermore, we amalgamate these rewards into a unified reward model\naimed at capturing different best practices and quality aspects of tests. By\ncomparing RL-trained models with those trained using supervised learning, we\nprovide insights into how reliably utilize RL to improve test generation\nquality and into the effects of various training strategies. Our experimental\nresults demonstrate that the RL-optimized model consistently generated\nhigh-quality test cases compared to the base LLM, improving the model by up to\n21%, and successfully generates nearly 100% syntactically correct code. RLSQM\nalso outperformed GPT-4 on four out of seven metrics.

To address\nthis issue, we propose Reinforcement Learning from Static Quality Metrics\n(RLSQM), wherein we utilize Reinforcement Learning to generate high-quality\nunit tests based on static analysis-based quality metrics.

Then, we implemented lightweight static\nanalysis-based reward model and trained LLMs using this reward model to\noptimize for five code quality metrics. Our experimental results demonstrate\nthat the RL-optimized Codex model consistently generated higher-quality test\ncases than the base LLM, improving quality metrics by up to 23%, and generated\nnearly 100% syntactically-correct code. RLSQM also outperformed GPT-4 on all\ncode quality metrics, in spite of training a substantially cheaper Codex model.\nWe provide insights into how reliably utilize RL to improve test generation\nquality and show that RLSQM is a significant step towards enhancing the overall\nefficiency and reliability of automated software testing.

However, the performance of such MNMT\nmodels still lags behind that of large language models (LLMs), limiting their\npracticality. In this work, we address this limitation by introducing\nregistering to achieve the new state-of-the-art of decoder-only MNMT models.\nSpecifically, we insert a set of artificial tokens specifying the target\nlanguage, called registers, into the input sequence between the source and\ntarget tokens. By modifying the attention mask, the target token generation\nonly pays attention to the activation of registers, representing the source\ntokens in the target language space. Experiments on EC-40, a large-scale\nbenchmark, show that our method outperforms related methods driven by\noptimizing multilingual representations. We further scale up and collect 9.3\nbillion sentence pairs across 24 languages from public datasets to pre-train\ntwo models, namely MITRE (multilingual translation with registers). One of\nthem, MITRE-913M, outperforms NLLB-3.3B, achieves comparable performance with\ncommercial LLMs, and shows strong adaptability in fine-tuning. Finally, we\nopen-source our models to facilitate further research and development in MNMT:\nhttps://github.com/zhiqu22/mitre.",

However, the performance of such MNMT\nmodels still lags behind that of large language models (LLMs), limiting their\npracticality. In this work, we address this limitation by introducing\nregistering to achieve the new state-of-the-art of decoder-only MNMT models.\nSpecifically, we insert a set of artificial tokens specifying the target\nlanguage, called registers, into the input sequence between the source and\ntarget tokens. By modifying the attention mask, the target token generation\nonly pays attention to the activation of registers, representing the source\ntokens in the target language space. Experiments on EC-40, a large-scale\nbenchmark, show that our method outperforms related methods driven by\noptimizing multilingual representations. We further scale up and collect 9.3\nbillion sentence pairs across 24 languages from public datasets to pre-train\ntwo models, namely MITRE (multilingual translation with registers). One of\nthem, MITRE-913M, outperforms NLLB-3.3B, achieves comparable performance with\ncommercial LLMs, and shows strong adaptability in fine-tuning. Finally, we\nopen-source our models to facilitate further research and development in MNMT:\nhttps://github.com/zhiqu22/mitre."

To overcome these limitations, we present DRCap, a\ndata-efficient and flexible zero-shot audio captioning system that requires\ntext-only data for training and can quickly adapt to new domains without\nadditional fine-tuning. DRCap integrates a contrastive language-audio\npre-training (CLAP) model and a large-language model (LLM) as its backbone.\nDuring training, the model predicts the ground-truth caption with a fixed text\nencoder from CLAP, whereas, during inference, the text encoder is replaced with\nthe audio encoder to generate captions for audio clips in a zero-shot manner.\nTo mitigate the modality gap of the CLAP model, we use both the projection\nstrategy from the encoder side and the retrieval-augmented generation strategy\nfrom the decoder side. Specifically, audio embeddings are first projected onto\na text embedding support to absorb extensive semantic information within the\njoint multi-modal space of CLAP. At the same time, similar captions retrieved\nfrom a datastore are fed as prompts to instruct the LLM, incorporating external\nknowledge to take full advantage of its strong generative capability.\nConditioned on both the projected CLAP embedding and the retrieved similar\ncaptions, the model is able to produce a more accurate and semantically rich\ntextual description. By tailoring the text embedding support and the caption\ndatastore to the target domain, DRCap acquires a robust ability to adapt to new\ndomains in a training-free manner. Experimental results demonstrate that DRCap\noutperforms all other zero-shot models in in-domain scenarios and achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance in cross-domain scenarios.",

Modern tooling and simulation platforms,\nsuch as NVIDIA Isaac Sim, have been enabling such advances.

We benchmark\nend-to-end policies with the state-of-the-art Nav2, navigation stack in Robot\nOperating System (ROS).

                "summary": "Recently, given the docstring for the target problem and the target function\nsignature, large language models (LLMs) have been used not only to generate\nsource code, but also to generate test cases, consisting of test inputs and\nassertions (e.g., in the form of checking an actual output against the expected\noutput). However, as shown by our empirical study on assertions generated by\nfour LLMs for the HumanEval benchmark, over 62% of the generated assertions are\nincorrect (i.e., failed on the ground-truth problem solution). To detect\nincorrect assertions (given the docstring and the target function signature\nalong with a sample of example inputs and outputs), in this paper, we propose a\nnew approach named DeCon to effectively detect incorrect assertions via\nLLM-generated postconditions for the target problem (a postcondition is a\npredicate that must always be true just after the execution of the ground-truth\nproblem solution). Our approach requires a small set of I/O examples (i.e., a\nsample of example inputs and outputs) for the target problem (e.g., the I/O\nexamples included in the docstring for a target problem in HumanEval). We use\nthe given I/O examples to filter out those LLM-generated postconditions that\nare violated by at least one given I/O example. We then use the remaining\npostconditions to detect incorrect assertions as those assertions that violate\nat least one remaining postcondition. Experimental results show that DeCon can\ndetect averagely more than 64% (63% and 65.5% detected by GPT-3.5 and GPT-4,\nrespectively) incorrect assertions generated by four state-of-the-art LLMs, and\nDeCon can also improve the effectiveness of these LLMs in code generation by 4%\nin terms of Pass@1. In addition, although DeCon might filter out correct\nassertions, the fault-finding ability of the remaining correct assertions\ndecreases only slightly.",

Previous studies\nhave attempted to mitigate it by retrieving factual knowledge from large-scale\nknowledge graphs (KGs) to assist LLMs in logical reasoning and prediction of\nanswers. However, this kind of approach often introduces noise and irrelevant\ndata, especially in situations with extensive context from multiple knowledge\naspects. In this way, LLM attention can be potentially mislead from question\nand relevant information. In our study, we introduce an Adaptive Multi-Aspect\nRetrieval-augmented over KGs (Amar) framework. This method retrieves knowledge\nincluding entities, relations, and subgraphs, and converts each piece of\nretrieved text into prompt embeddings. The Amar framework comprises two key\nsub-components: 1) a self-alignment module that aligns commonalities among\nentities, relations, and subgraphs to enhance retrieved text, thereby reducing\nnoise interference; 2) a relevance gating module that employs a soft gate to\nlearn the relevance score between question and multi-aspect retrieved data, to\ndetermine which information should be used to enhance LLMs' output, or even\nfiltered altogether. Our method has achieved state-of-the-art performance on\ntwo common datasets, WebQSP and CWQ, showing a 1.9\\% improvement in accuracy\nover its best competitor and a 6.6\\% improvement in logical form generation\nover a method that directly uses retrieved text as context prompts.

However, its performance significantly deteriorates for emotion\ndetection tasks, especially fine-grained emotion recognition. The underlying\nreasons for this remain unclear. In this paper, we identify the reasons behind\nICL's poor performance from the perspective of prototype theory and propose a\nmethod to address this issue. Specifically, we conduct extensive pilot\nexperiments and find that ICL conforms to the prototype theory on fine-grained\nemotion recognition. Based on this theory, we uncover the following\ndeficiencies in ICL: (1) It relies on prototypes (example-label pairs) that are\nsemantically similar but emotionally inaccurate to predict emotions. (2) It is\nprone to interference from irrelevant categories, affecting the accuracy and\nrobustness of the predictions. To address these issues, we propose an Emotion\nContext Learning method (E-ICL) on fine-grained emotion recognition. E-ICL\nrelies on more emotionally accurate prototypes to predict categories by\nreferring to emotionally similar examples with dynamic labels. Simultaneously,\nE-ICL employs an exclusionary emotion prediction strategy to avoid interference\nfrom irrelevant categories, thereby increasing its accuracy and robustness.\nNote that the entire process is accomplished with the assistance of a\nplug-and-play emotion auxiliary model, without additional training. Experiments\non the fine-grained emotion datasets EDOS, Empathetic-Dialogues,\nEmpatheticIntent, and GoEmotions show that E-ICL achieves superior emotion\nprediction performance. Furthermore, even when the emotion auxiliary model used\nis lower than 10% of the LLMs, E-ICL can still boost the performance of LLMs by\nover 4% on multiple datasets.",

In\nthis paper, we explore the working mechanism of LLMs in information processing\nfrom the perspective of Information Bottleneck Theory. We propose a\nnon-training construction strategy to define a task space and identify the\nfollowing key findings: (1) LLMs compress input information into specific task\nspaces (e.g., sentiment space, topic space) to facilitate task understanding;\n(2) they then extract and utilize relevant information from the task space at\ncritical moments to generate accurate predictions. Based on these insights, we\nintroduce two novel approaches: an Information Compression-based Context\nLearning (IC-ICL) and a Task-Space-guided Fine-Tuning (TS-FT). IC-ICL enhances\nreasoning performance and inference efficiency by compressing retrieved example\ninformation into the task space. TS-FT employs a space-guided loss to fine-tune\nLLMs, encouraging the learning of more effective compression and selection\nmechanisms. Experiments across multiple datasets validate the effectiveness of\ntask space construction. Additionally, IC-ICL not only improves performance but\nalso accelerates inference speed by over 40\\%, while TS-FT achieves superior\nresults with a minimal strategy adjustment.",

Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized the analyzing and\ngeneration of human-like text. These models rely on pre-trained data and lack\nreal-time updates unless integrated with live data tools. RAG enhances LLMs by\nintegrating online resources and databases to generate contextually appropriate\nresponses. However, traditional RAG still encounters challenges like\ninformation dilution and hallucinations when handling vast amounts of data. Our\napproach addresses these challenges by converting corpora into a\ndomain-specific dataset and RAG architecture is constructed to generate\nresponses from the target document. We introduce QuIM-RAG (Question-to-question\nInverted Index Matching), a novel approach for the retrieval mechanism in our\nsystem. This strategy generates potential questions from document chunks and\nmatches these with user queries to identify the most relevant text chunks for\ngenerating accurate answers. We have implemented our RAG system on top of the\nopen-source Meta-LLaMA3-8B-instruct model by Meta Inc. that is available on\nHugging Face. We constructed a custom corpus of 500+ pages from a high-traffic\nwebsite accessed thousands of times daily for answering complex questions,\nalong with manually prepared ground truth QA for evaluation. We compared our\napproach with traditional RAG models using BERT-Score and RAGAS,\nstate-of-the-art metrics for evaluating LLM applications.

The TARS method for\nknowledge removal (Davies et al 2024) provides strong evidence for the\nhypothesis that that linear layer weights which act directly on the residual\nstream may have high correlation with different concepts encoded in the\nresidual stream. Building upon this, we attempt to decode neuron weights\ndirectly into token probabilities through the final projection layer of the\nmodel (the LM-head). Firstly, we show that with Llama 3.1 8B we can utilise the\nLM-head to decode specialised feature neurons that respond strongly to certain\nconcepts, with examples such as \"dog\" and \"California\".

This extends to the fine-tuned assistant Llama 3.1\n8B instruct model, where we find that over 75% of neurons in the up-projection\nlayers have the same top associated token compared to the pretrained model.\nFinally, we demonstrate that clamping the \"dog\" neuron leads the instruct model\nto always discuss dogs when asked about its favourite animal.

Misidentified blob origins present an\nadditional challenge, as they lead to the inclusion of non-permissively\nlicensed code, raising serious compliance concerns.\n  By addressing these issues, the training of new models can avoid perpetuating\nbuggy code patterns or license violations. We expect our results to inspire\nprocess improvements for automated data curation, with the potential to enhance\nthe reliability of outputs generated by AI tools."

The usage of\nLeetDecoding does not require any knowledge of GPU programming and the\nunderlying complexity analysis, intentionally making LeetDecoding accessible to\nLLM practitioners. The source code of LeetDecoding is provided at\n\\href{https://github.com/Computational-Machine-Intelligence/LeetDecoding}{this\nGitHub repository}, and users can simply install LeetDecoding by the command\n\\texttt{pip install leet-decoding}."

This\nlimits the achievable compression rate with minimal loss. To this end. we\nintroduce a training-free method, $\\textbf{ReTaKe}$, containing two novel\nmodules DPSelect and PivotKV, to jointly model and reduce both temporal visual\nredundancy and knowledge redundancy for long video understanding. Specifically,\nDPSelect identifies keyframes with local maximum peak distance based on their\nvisual features, which are closely aligned with human video perception. PivotKV\nemploys the obtained keyframes as pivots and conducts KV-Cache compression for\nthe non-pivot tokens with low attention scores, which are derived from the\nlearned prior knowledge of LLMs. Experiments on benchmarks VideoMME, MLVU, and\nLVBench, show that ReTaKe can support 4x longer video sequences with minimal\nperformance loss (<1%) and outperform all similar-size VideoLLMs with 3%-5%,\neven surpassing or on par with much larger ones.

Large Language Models (LLMs) offer potential for\nautomating this process, yet comprehensive assessments comparing their\nperformance to human annotators across multiple dimensions are lacking. This\nstudy evaluates the reliability, consistency, and quality of seven\nstate-of-the-art LLMs, including variants of OpenAI's GPT-4, Gemini, Llama, and\nMixtral, relative to human annotators in analyzing sentiment, political\nleaning, emotional intensity, and sarcasm detection. A total of 33 human\nannotators and eight LLM variants assessed 100 curated textual items,\ngenerating 3,300 human and 19,200 LLM annotations, with LLMs evaluated across\nthree time points to examine temporal consistency. Inter-rater reliability was\nmeasured using Krippendorff's alpha, and intra-class correlation coefficients\nassessed consistency over time. The results reveal that both humans and LLMs\nexhibit high reliability in sentiment analysis and political leaning\nassessments, with LLMs demonstrating higher internal consistency than humans.\nIn emotional intensity, LLMs displayed higher agreement compared to humans,\nthough humans rated emotional intensity significantly higher. Both groups\nstruggled with sarcasm detection, evidenced by low agreement. LLMs showed\nexcellent temporal consistency across all dimensions, indicating stable\nperformance over time. This research concludes that LLMs, especially GPT-4, can\neffectively replicate human analysis in sentiment and political leaning,\nalthough human expertise remains essential for emotional intensity\ninterpretation.

This study attempts to\nunpack this complexity by combining exploratory search strategies with the\ntheories of exploratory learning to form a new theoretical model of exploratory\nlearning from the perspective of students' learning. Our work adapts Kolb's\nlearning model by incorporating high-frequency exploration and feedback loops,\naiming to promote deep cognitive and higher-order cognitive skill development\nin students. Additionally, this paper discusses and suggests how advanced LLMs\nintegrated into information retrieval and information theory can support\nstudents in their exploratory searches, contributing theoretically to promoting\nstudent-computer interaction and supporting their learning journeys in the new\nera with LLMs."
