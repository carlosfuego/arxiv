However, the growing size of Mamba models continues to pose\ntraining and deployment challenges and raises environmental concerns due to\nconsiderable energy consumption. In this work, we introduce Bi-Mamba, a\nscalable and powerful 1-bit Mamba architecture designed for more efficient\nlarge language models with multiple sizes across 780M, 1.3B, and 2.7B. Bi-Mamba\nmodels are trained from scratch on data volume as regular LLM pertaining using\nan autoregressive distillation loss. Extensive experimental results on language\nmodeling demonstrate that Bi-Mamba achieves performance comparable to its\nfull-precision counterparts (e.g., FP16 or BF16) and much better accuracy than\npost-training-binarization (PTB) Mamba baselines, while significantly reducing\nmemory footprint and energy consumption compared to the original Mamba model.\nOur study pioneers a new linear computational complexity LLM framework under\nlow-bit representation and facilitates the future design of specialized\nhardware tailored for efficient 1-bit Mamba-based LLMs.",

We\npresent Deegen, a meta-compiler that allows users to generate a\nhigh-performance JIT-capable VM for their own language at an engineering cost\nsimilar to writing a simple interpreter. Deegen takes in the execution\nsemantics of the bytecodes implemented as C++ functions, and automatically\ngenerates a two-tier VM execution engine with a state-of-the-art interpreter, a\nstate-of-the-art baseline JIT, and the tier-switching logic that connects them\ninto a self-adaptive system.\n  We are the first to demonstrate the automatic generation of a JIT compiler,\nand the automatic generation of an interpreter that outperforms the state of\nthe art. Our performance comes from a long list of optimizations supported by\nDeegen, including bytecode specialization and quickening, register pinning, tag\nregister optimization, call inline caching, generic inline caching, JIT\npolymorphic IC, JIT IC inline slab, type-check removal and strength reduction,\ntype-based slow-path extraction and outlining, JIT hot-cold code splitting, and\nJIT OSR-entry. These optimizations are either employed automatically, or guided\nby the language implementer through intuitive APIs. As a result, the\ndisassembly of the Deegen-generated interpreter, baseline JIT, and the\ngenerated JIT code rivals the assembly code hand-written by experts in\nstate-of-the-art VMs.\n  We implement LuaJIT Remake (LJR), a standard-compliant Lua 5.1 VM, using\nDeegen. Across 44 benchmarks, LJR's interpreter is on average 179% faster than\nthe official PUC Lua interpreter, and 31% faster than LuaJIT's interpreter.\nLJR's baseline JIT has negligible startup delay, and its execution performance\nis on average 360% faster than PUC Lua and only 33% slower (but faster on 13/44\nbenchmarks) than LuaJIT's optimizing JIT.",

High-performance parallel CPU implementations are\ncreated, leveraging the concept of fusion at multiple levels in order to reduce\nmemory traffic overhead, as well as the BLIS framework which provides\nhigh-performance GEMM kernels, hierarchical parallelism, and cache blocking. We\nfind that operation fusion and improved use of available bandwidth via\nparallelization of bandwidth-bound (level-2 BLAS) operations are essential for\nobtaining high performance, while a concise C++ implementation provides a clear\nand close connection to the formal derivation process without sacrificing\nperformance."

However, this approach is\ncomputationally expensive. To address this problem, we propose Transformer with\nresidual value (ResFormer) which approximates cross-layer attention through\nadding a residual connection from the values of the the first layer to all\nsubsequent layers. Based on this method, one variant is the Transformer with\nsingle layer value (SVFormer), where all layers share the same value embedding\nfrom first layer, reducing the $KV$ cache by nearly 50\\%. Comprehensive\nempirical evidence demonstrates that ResFormer mitigates attention\nconcentration problem in deeper layers and enhances representation across most\nlayers, outperforming the vanilla Transformer, DenseFormer, and NeuTRENO in\ntraining error as well as downstream tasks. Further visualization results\nsuggest that Resformer alleviates attention sinks through avoiding value-state\ndrains. SVFormer trains significantly faster than the vanilla Transformer and\nperforms better than other methods like GQA and CLA, with performance\ninfluenced by sequence length and cumulative learning rate.",

ESF has been developed to\naccurately reflect the unique features of the latest CXL protocol from the\nground up. It uses a specialized interconnect layer to facilitate connections\nwithin a wide range of system topologies and also includes key components to\ncarry out specific functions required by these features. By utilizing ESF, we\nthoroughly investigate various aspects of CXL systems, including system\ntopology, device-handled coherence, and the effects of PCIe characteristics,\nleading to important findings that can guide the creation of high-performance\nCXL systems. The ESF source codes are fully open-source and can be accessed at\nhttps://anonymous.4open.science/r/ESF-1CE3."

However, the current ordinary\ndifferential equation (ODE) solver for FDMs, e.g., the Euler solver, still\nsuffers from slow generation since ODE solvers need many number function\nevaluations (NFE) to keep high-quality generation. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel training-free flow-solver to reduce NFE while maintaining high-quality\ngeneration. The key insight for the flow-solver is to leverage the previous\nsteps to reduce the NFE, where a cache is created to reuse these results from\nthe previous steps. Specifically, the Taylor expansion is first used to\napproximate the ODE. To calculate the high-order derivatives of Taylor\nexpansion, the flow-solver proposes to use the previous steps and a polynomial\ninterpolation to approximate it, where the number of orders we could\napproximate equals the number of previous steps we cached. We also prove that\nthe flow-solver has a more minor approximation error and faster generation\nspeed. Experimental results on the CIFAR-10, CelebA-HQ, LSUN-Bedroom,\nLSUN-Church, ImageNet, and real text-to-image generation prove the efficiency\nof the flow-solver. Specifically, the flow-solver improves the FID-30K from\n13.79 to 6.75, from 46.64 to 19.49 with $\\text{NFE}=10$ on CIFAR-10 and\nLSUN-Church, respectively.",

Current methods\ntypically require extensive training samples from meta-learning to build memory\nand perform intensive fine-tuning of GNN parameters, leading to high memory\nconsumption and potential loss of previously learned knowledge. To tackle these\nchallenges, we introduce Mecoin, an efficient method for building and\nmaintaining memory. Mecoin employs Structured Memory Units to cache prototypes\nof learned categories, as well as Memory Construction Modules to update these\nprototypes for new categories through interactions between the nodes and the\ncached prototypes. Additionally, we have designed a Memory Representation\nAdaptation Module to store probabilities associated with each class prototype,\nreducing the need for parameter fine-tuning and lowering the forgetting rate.\nWhen a sample matches its corresponding class prototype, the relevant\nprobabilities are retrieved from the MRaM. Knowledge is then distilled back\ninto the GNN through a Graph Knowledge Distillation Module, preserving the\nmodel's memory. We analyze the effectiveness of Mecoin in terms of\ngeneralization error and explore the impact of different distillation\nstrategies on model performance through experiments and VC-dimension analysis.\nCompared to other related works, Mecoin shows superior performance in accuracy\nand forgetting rate.

To address the limited resources\nof IIoT sensor devices, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted mobile edge\ncomputing (MEC) has emerged as a promising solution, providing flexible and\ncost-effective services in close proximity of IIoT sensor devices (ISDs).\nHowever, leveraging aerial MEC to meet the delay-sensitive and\ncomputation-intensive requirements of the ISDs could face several challenges,\nincluding the limited communication, computation and caching (3C) resources,\nstringent offloading requirements for 3C services, and constrained on-board\nenergy of UAVs. To address these issues, we first present a collaborative\naerial MEC-assisted ICPS architecture by incorporating the computing\ncapabilities of the macro base station (MBS) and UAVs.

In this context, low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite\nconstellations offer remarkable potential for efficient cache content broadcast\nin remote regions, thereby extending the reach of digital services. In this\npaper, we introduce a novel approach to optimize wireless edge content\nplacement using NTN. Despite wide coverage, the varying NTN transmission\ncapabilities must be carefully aligned with each content placement to maximize\nbroadcast efficiency. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to optimize\nwireless edge content placement using NTN, positioning NTN as a complement to\nTN for achieving optimal content broadcasting. Specifically, we dynamically\nselect content for placement via NTN links. This selection is based on\npopularity and suitability for delivery through NTN, while considering the\norbital motion of LEO satellites. Our system-level case studies, based on a\npractical LEO constellation, demonstrate the significant improvement in\nplacement speed compared to existing methods, which neglect network mobility.\nWe also demonstrate that NTN links significantly outperform standalone wireless\nTN solutions, particularly in the early stages of content delivery. This\nadvantage is amplified when there is a higher correlation of content popularity\nacross geographical regions.",

To further accelerate TokenSelect, we\ndesigned the Selection Cache based on observations of consecutive Query\nsimilarity and implemented efficient dot product kernel, significantly reducing\nthe overhead of token selection.

While traditional content\nrecommendations are oblivious to network conditions, the paradigm of\nNetwork-Friendly Recommendations (NFR) has recently emerged, favoring content\nthat improves network performance (e.g. cached near the user), while still\nbeing appealing to the user. However, NFR algorithms sometimes achieve their\ngoal by shrinking the pool of content recommended to users. The undesirable\nside-effect is reduced content diversity, a phenomenon known as\n``content/filter bubble''. This reduced diversity is problematic for both\nusers, who are prevented from exploring a broader range of content, and content\ncreators (e.g. YouTubers) whose content may be recommended less frequently,\nleading to perceived unfairness. In this paper, we first investigate - using\nreal data and state-of-the-art NFR schemes - the extent of this phenomenon. We\nthen formulate a ``Diverse-NFR'' optimization problem (i.e., network-friendly\nrecommendations with - sufficient - content diversity), and through a series of\ntransformation steps, we manage to reduce it to a linear program that can be\nsolved fast and optimally. Our findings show that Diverse-NFR can achieve high\nnetwork gains (comparable to non-diverse NFR) while maintaining diversity\nconstraints.

Self-attention requires the key-value (KV)\ncache of all previous sequences to be retrieved from memory at every decoding\nstep to retrieve context information, leading to two primary bottlenecks during\nbatch inference. First, there is a significant delay in obtaining the first\ntoken, as the information of the entire prompt must first be processed to\nprefill the KV cache. Second, computation of subsequent tokens is bottlenecked\nby the high memory I/O demand of fetching the entire KV cache, which grows\nlinearly with sequence length, incurring quadratic memory reads overall. We\ndesign the Block Transformer to strategically mitigate these costs, by\nincorporating coarsity and locality into an integrated global-to-local\narchitecture. At the lower layers, we aggregate tokens into fixed size blocks\nto apply attention across the entire sequence at coarse-grained detail, to\ncapture the global context while minimizing KV cache overhead. At upper layers,\nwe apply attention within each block to decode individual tokens, to model\nfine-grained details with a lightweight local KV cache. We pretrain vanilla and\nBlock Transformers from scratch and demonstrate that Block Transformers reach\n10--20x inference throughput compared to vanilla transformers with equivalent\nperplexity and zero-shot task performance.

With increasing traffic, backhaul links and core networks are under\nsignificant traffic, leading to the investigation of caching solutions at edge\nrouters. Many existing studies utilize Markov Decision Processes (MDP) to\ntackle caching problems, often assuming decision points at fixed intervals;\nhowever, real-world environments are characterized by random request arrivals.\nAdditionally, critical file attributes such as lifetime, size, and priority\nsignificantly impact the effectiveness of caching policies, yet existing\nresearch fails to integrate all these attributes in policy design.

With increasing traffic, backhaul links and core networks are under\nsignificant traffic, leading to the investigation of caching solutions at edge\nrouters. Many existing studies utilize Markov Decision Processes (MDP) to\ntackle caching problems, often assuming decision points at fixed intervals;\nhowever, real-world environments are characterized by random request arrivals.\nAdditionally, critical file attributes such as lifetime, size, and priority\nsignificantly impact the effectiveness of caching policies, yet existing\nresearch fails to integrate all these attributes in policy design.

A key challenge in accelerating VLMs is storing and\naccessing the large Key-Value (KV) cache that encodes long visual contexts,\nsuch as images or videos. While existing KV cache compression methods are\neffective for Large Language Models (LLMs), directly migrating them to VLMs\nyields suboptimal accuracy and speedup. To bridge the gap, we propose VL-Cache,\na novel KV cache compression recipe tailored for accelerating VLM inference. In\nthis paper, we first investigate the unique sparsity pattern of VLM attention\nby distinguishing visual and text tokens in prefill and decoding phases. Based\non these observations, we introduce a layer-adaptive sparsity-aware cache\nbudget allocation method that effectively distributes the limited cache budget\nacross different layers, further reducing KV cache size without compromising\naccuracy. Additionally, we develop a modality-aware token scoring policy to\nbetter evaluate the token importance. Empirical results on multiple benchmark\ndatasets demonstrate that retaining only 10% of KV cache achieves accuracy\ncomparable to that with full cache. In a speed benchmark, our method\naccelerates end-to-end latency of generating 100 tokens by up to 2.33x and\nspeeds up decoding by up to 7.08x, while reducing the memory footprint of KV\ncache in GPU by 90%.",

While existing KV cache compression methods are\neffective for Large Language Models (LLMs), directly migrating them to VLMs\nyields suboptimal accuracy and speedup. To bridge the gap, we propose VL-Cache,\na novel KV cache compression recipe tailored for accelerating VLM inference. In\nthis paper, we first investigate the unique sparsity pattern of VLM attention\nby distinguishing visual and text tokens in prefill and decoding phases. Based\non these observations, we introduce a layer-adaptive sparsity-aware cache\nbudget allocation method that effectively distributes the limited cache budget\nacross different layers, further reducing KV cache size without compromising\naccuracy. Additionally, we develop a modality-aware token scoring policy to\nbetter evaluate the token importance. Empirical results on multiple benchmark\ndatasets demonstrate that retaining only 10% of KV cache achieves accuracy\ncomparable to that with full cache. In a speed benchmark, our method\naccelerates end-to-end latency of generating 100 tokens by up to 2.33x and\nspeeds up decoding by up to 7.08x, while reducing the memory footprint of KV\ncache in GPU by 90%."

NVIDIA Ampere GPUs can execute a\nfine-grained 2:4 sparse matrix multiplication twice as fast as its dense\nequivalent. In the light of this property, we comprehensively investigate the\nfeasibility of accelerating feed-forward networks (FFNs) of transformers in\npre-training. First, we define a ``flip rate'' to monitor the stability of a\n2:4 training process. Utilizing this metric, we propose three techniques to\npreserve accuracy: to modify the sparse-refined straight-through estimator by\napplying the masked decay term on gradients, to determine a feasible decay\nfactor in warm-up stage, and to enhance the model's quality by a dense\nfine-tuning procedure near the end of pre-training. Besides, we devise two\ntechniques to practically accelerate training: to calculate transposable 2:4\nmasks by convolution, and to accelerate gated activation functions by reducing\nGPU L2 cache miss. Experiments show that our 2:4 sparse training algorithm\nachieves similar convergence to dense training algorithms on several\ntransformer pre-training tasks, while actual acceleration can be observed on\ndifferent shapes of transformer block apparently.

To overcome\nthis issue, we introduce \\textit{adaptive negative proxies}, which are\ndynamically generated during testing by exploring actual OOD images, to align\nmore closely with the underlying OOD label space and enhance the efficacy of\nnegative proxy guidance. Specifically, our approach utilizes a feature memory\nbank to selectively cache discriminative features from test images,\nrepresenting the targeted OOD distribution. This facilitates the creation of\nproxies that can better align with specific OOD datasets. While task-adaptive\nproxies average features to reflect the unique characteristics of each dataset,\nthe sample-adaptive proxies weight features based on their similarity to\nindividual test samples, exploring detailed sample-level nuances. The final\nscore for identifying OOD samples integrates static negative labels with our\nproposed adaptive proxies, effectively combining textual and visual knowledge\nfor enhanced performance. Our method is training-free and annotation-free, and\nit maintains fast testing speed. Extensive experiments across various\nbenchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, abbreviated as\nAdaNeg.

In this work, we introduce Bi-Mamba, a\nscalable and powerful 1-bit Mamba architecture designed for more efficient\nlarge language models with multiple sizes across 780M, 1.3B, and 2.7B. Bi-Mamba\nmodels are trained from scratch on data volume as regular LLM pertaining using\nan autoregressive distillation loss.

We\nanalyse the public measurements of the projected and redshift-space ELGs\ncorrelation functions at $z=1.0$ and $z=1.3$ from DESI One Percent data\nrelease, which we fit over a broad range of scales $r \\in [0.1, 30]/h^{-1}$Mpc\nto within the statistical uncertainties of the data. We also validate the\ninference pipeline using two mock DESI ELG catalogues built from hydrodynamical\n(TNG300) and semi-analytical galaxy formation models (\\texttt{L-Galaxies}).\nSHAMe-SF is able to reproduce the clustering of DESI-ELGs and the mock DESI\nsamples within statistical uncertainties.

To\nfurther accelerate the process, we design a performance predictor that uses\nin-context surrogate models to skip unpromising agent designs. Extensive\nexperiments across six benchmarks, covering the diverse scenarios of web,\nembodied, tool use and game applications, show that AgentSquare substantially\noutperforms hand-crafted agents, achieving an average performance gain of 17.2%\nagainst best-known human designs.

Yet the substantial memory footprint of LLMs\nsignificantly hinders their deployment. In this paper, we improve the\naccessibility of LLMs through BitMoD, an algorithm-hardware co-design solution\nthat enables efficient LLM acceleration at low weight precision. On the\nalgorithm side, BitMoD introduces fine-grained data type adaptation that uses a\ndifferent numerical data type to quantize a group of (e.g., 128) weights.\nThrough the careful design of these new data types, BitMoD is able to quantize\nLLM weights to very low precision (e.g., 4 bits and 3 bits) while maintaining\nhigh accuracy. On the hardware side, BitMoD employs a bit-serial processing\nelement to easily support multiple numerical precisions and data types; our\nhardware design includes two key innovations: First, it employs a unified\nrepresentation to process different weight data types, thus reducing the\nhardware cost. Second, it adopts a bit-serial dequantization unit to rescale\nthe per-group partial sum with minimal hardware overhead. Our evaluation on six\nrepresentative LLMs demonstrates that BitMoD significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art LLM quantization and acceleration methods. For discriminative\ntasks, BitMoD can quantize LLM weights to 4-bit with $<\\!0.5\\%$ accuracy loss\non average. For generative tasks, BitMoD is able to quantize LLM weights to\n3-bit while achieving better perplexity than prior LLM quantization scheme.\nCombining the superior model performance with an efficient accelerator design,\nBitMoD achieves an average of $1.69\\times$ and $1.48\\times$ speedups compared\nto prior LLM accelerators ANT and OliVe, respectively.",

To address\nthis challenge, we propose a skill library framework based on knowledge graphs,\nwhich endows robots with high-level skill awareness and spatial semantic\nunderstanding. The framework hierarchically organizes operational knowledge by\nconstructing a \"task graph\" and a \"scene graph\" to represent task and scene\nsemantic information, respectively. We introduce a \"state graph\" to facilitate\ninteraction between high-level task planning and low-level scene information.\nFurthermore, we propose a hierarchical transfer framework for operational\nskills. At the task level, the framework integrates contextual learning and\nchain-of-thought prompting within a four-stage prompt paradigm, leveraging\nlarge language models' (LLMs) reasoning and generalization capabilities to\nachieve task-level subtask sequence transfer. At the motion level, an adaptive\ntrajectory transfer method is developed using the A* algorithm and the skill\nlibrary, enabling motion-level adaptive trajectory transfer. At the physical\nlevel, we introduce an adaptive contour extraction and posture perception\nmethod based on tactile perception. This method dynamically obtains\nhigh-precision contour and posture information from visual-tactile texture data\nand adjusts transferred skills, such as contact positions and postures, to\nensure effectiveness in new environments. Experimental results validate the\neffectiveness of the proposed methods. Project\nwebsite:https://github.com/MingchaoQi/skill_transfer",

The investigation begins with {\\sc Olivaw}, an\nAlphaGo Zero-like agent that discovers Othello knowledge from scratch but is\nunable to communicate it. This realization leads to the development of the\nExplanatory Learning (EL) framework, a formalization of the problem faced by a\nscientist when trying to explain a new phenomenon to their peers. The effective\nEL prescriptions allow us to crack Zendo, a board game simulating the\nscientific endeavor. This success comes with a fundamental insight: an\nartificial scientist must develop its own interpretation of the language used\nto explain its findings. This perspective then leads us to see modern\nmultimodal models as interpreters, and to devise a new way to build\ninterpretable and cost-effective CLIP-like models: by coupling two unimodal\nmodels using little multimodal data and no further training. Finally, we\ndiscuss what ChatGPT and its siblings are still missing to become artificial\nscientists, and introduce Odeen, a benchmark about interpreting explanations\nthat sees LLMs going no further than random chance while being instead fully\nsolved by humans.",

                    "value": "Rooted in the explosion of deep learning over the past decade, this thesis\nspans from AlphaGo to ChatGPT to empirically examine the fundamental concepts\nneeded to realize the vision of an artificial scientist: a machine with the\ncapacity to autonomously generate original research and contribute to the\nexpansion of human knowledge. The investigation begins with {\\sc Olivaw}, an\nAlphaGo Zero-like agent that discovers Othello knowledge from scratch but is\nunable to communicate it. This realization leads to the development of the\nExplanatory Learning (EL) framework, a formalization of the problem faced by a\nscientist when trying to explain a new phenomenon to their peers. The effective\nEL prescriptions allow us to crack Zendo, a board game simulating the\nscientific endeavor. This success comes with a fundamental insight: an\nartificial scientist must develop its own interpretation of the language used\nto explain its findings. This perspective then leads us to see modern\nmultimodal models as interpreters, and to devise a new way to build\ninterpretable and cost-effective CLIP-like models: by coupling two unimodal\nmodels using little multimodal data and no further training. Finally, we\ndiscuss what ChatGPT and its siblings are still missing to become artificial\nscientists, and introduce Odeen, a benchmark about interpreting explanations\nthat sees LLMs going no further than random chance while being instead fully\nsolved by humans."

The trained decoders are tested on a\nmix of manually and web-curated datasets, as well as standard image\nclassification benchmarks, and achieve fine-grained prompt-free prediction\nscores of up to 87.5%, a strong result considering the model must work for any\nconceivable image and without any contextual clues."

As a result, several LLM-based ABMs have been proposed in the\npast year. While they hold promise, each simulator is specifically designed to\nstudy a particular scenario, making it time-consuming and resource-intensive to\nexplore other phenomena using the same ABM. Additionally, these models simulate\nonly a limited number of agents, whereas real-world social media platforms\ninvolve millions of users. To this end, we propose OASIS, a generalizable and\nscalable social media simulator. OASIS is designed based on real-world social\nmedia platforms, incorporating dynamically updated environments (\\emph{i.e.},\ndynamic social networks and post information), diverse action spaces\n(\\emph{i.e.}, following, commenting), and recommendation systems (\\emph{i.e.},\ninterest-based and hot-score-based). Additionally, OASIS supports large-scale\nuser simulations, capable of modeling up to one million users. With these\nfeatures, OASIS can be easily extended to different social media platforms to\nstudy large-scale group phenomena and behaviors. We replicate various social\nphenomena, including information spreading, group polarization, and herd\neffects across X and Reddit platforms. Moreover, we provide observations of\nsocial phenomena at different agent group scales. We observe that the larger\nagent group scale leads to more enhanced group dynamics and more diverse and\nhelpful agents' opinions. These findings demonstrate OASIS's potential as a\npowerful tool for studying complex systems in digital environments.",

Moreover, we provide observations of\nsocial phenomena at different agent group scales. We observe that the larger\nagent group scale leads to more enhanced group dynamics and more diverse and\nhelpful agents' opinions. These findings demonstrate OASIS's potential as a\npowerful tool for studying complex systems in digital environments."

                "summary": "Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) unifies wireless communication\nand sensing by sharing spectrum and hardware, which often incurs trade-offs\nbetween two functions due to limited resources. However, this paper shifts\nfocus to exploring the synergy between communication and sensing, using WiFi\nsensing as an exemplary scenario where communication signals are repurposed to\nprobe the environment without dedicated sensing waveforms, followed by data\nuploading to the edge server for inference. While increased device\nparticipation enhances multi-view sensing data, it also imposes significant\ncommunication overhead between devices and the edge server. To address this\nchallenge, we aim to maximize the sensing task performance, measured by mutual\ninformation, under the channel capacity constraint. The information-theoretic\noptimization problem is solved by the proposed ADE-MI, a novel framework that\nemploys a two-stage optimization two-stage optimization approach: (1) adaptive\ndistributed encoding (ADE) at the device, which ensures transmitted bits are\nmost relevant to sensing tasks, and (2) multi-view Inference (MI) at the edge\nserver, which orchestrates multi-view data from distributed devices. Our\nexperimental results highlight the synergy between communication and sensing,\nshowing that more frequent communication from WiFi access points to edge\ndevices improves sensing inference accuracy. The proposed ADE-MI achieves 92\\%\nrecognition accuracy with over $10^4$-fold reduction in latency compared to\nschemes with raw data communication, achieving both high sensing inference\naccuracy and low communication latency simultaneously.",

                    "value": "Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) unifies wireless communication\nand sensing by sharing spectrum and hardware, which often incurs trade-offs\nbetween two functions due to limited resources. However, this paper shifts\nfocus to exploring the synergy between communication and sensing, using WiFi\nsensing as an exemplary scenario where communication signals are repurposed to\nprobe the environment without dedicated sensing waveforms, followed by data\nuploading to the edge server for inference. While increased device\nparticipation enhances multi-view sensing data, it also imposes significant\ncommunication overhead between devices and the edge server. To address this\nchallenge, we aim to maximize the sensing task performance, measured by mutual\ninformation, under the channel capacity constraint. The information-theoretic\noptimization problem is solved by the proposed ADE-MI, a novel framework that\nemploys a two-stage optimization two-stage optimization approach: (1) adaptive\ndistributed encoding (ADE) at the device, which ensures transmitted bits are\nmost relevant to sensing tasks, and (2) multi-view Inference (MI) at the edge\nserver, which orchestrates multi-view data from distributed devices. Our\nexperimental results highlight the synergy between communication and sensing,\nshowing that more frequent communication from WiFi access points to edge\ndevices improves sensing inference accuracy. The proposed ADE-MI achieves 92\\%\nrecognition accuracy with over $10^4$-fold reduction in latency compared to\nschemes with raw data communication, achieving both high sensing inference\naccuracy and low communication latency simultaneously."

Both the perception and transition models are able to forget part of\nthe data points, while integrating the information they provide within the\nprior, which ensure fast variational inference. Finally, decision making is\nperformed with a variant of Q-learning which is able to learn Q-values from\nbeliefs over states. Empirically, we have demonstrated the model's ability to\nlearn the structure of several mazes: the model discovered the number of states\nand the transition probabilities between these states.

First, to address the high\ndimensionality of visual data, we incorporate a spatial-temporal variational\nautoencoder that encodes data into a continuous latent space. Second, for\ngenerative modeling, we develop a joint diffusion transformer that\nprogressively produces vision outputs. Third, for unified multi-task training,\nin-context learning is implemented. Input-target pairs serve as task context,\nwhich guides the diffusion transformer to align outputs with specific tasks\nwithin the latent space. During inference, a task-specific context set and test\ndata as queries allow LaVin-DiT to generalize across tasks without fine-tuning.\nTrained on extensive vision datasets, the model is scaled from 0.1B to 3.4B\nparameters, demonstrating substantial scalability and state-of-the-art\nperformance across diverse vision tasks.

Besides, we show that our approach has\nsome practical advantages. We also analyze our model and provide results to\nsupport the assumption."

To address this limitation,\nwe propose a comprehensive measurement model that accounts for both foot\nslippage and variable leg length by analyzing the relative motion between foot\ncontact points and the robot's body center. We show that leg length is an\nobservable quantity, meaning that its value can be explicitly inferred by\ndesigning an auxiliary filter. To this end, we introduce a dual estimation\nframework that iteratively employs a parameter filter to estimate the leg\nlength parameters and a state filter to estimate the robot's state. To prevent\nerror accumulation in this iterative framework, we construct a partial\nmeasurement model for the parameter filter using the leg static equation. This\napproach ensures that leg length estimation relies solely on joint torques and\nfoot contact forces, avoiding the influence of state estimation errors on the\nparameter estimation. Unlike leg length which can be directly estimated, foot\nslippage cannot be measured directly with the current sensor configuration.\nHowever, since foot slippage occurs at a low frequency, it can be treated as\noutliers in the measurement data. To mitigate the impact of these outliers, we\npropose the beta Kalman filter (beta KF), which redefines the estimation loss\nin canonical Kalman filtering using beta divergence. This divergence can assign\nlow weights to outliers in an adaptive manner, thereby enhancing the robustness\nof the estimation algorithm. These techniques together form the dual\nbeta-Kalman filter (Dual beta KF), a novel algorithm for robust state\nestimation in legged robots.

In this paper, we propose a VLM-based framework that generates\ncontent-aware text logo layouts by integrating multi-modal inputs with user\nconstraints, supporting a more flexible and stable layout design in real-world\napplications. We introduce two model techniques to reduce the computation for\nprocessing multiple glyph images simultaneously, while does not face\nperformance degradation. To support instruction-tuning of out model, we\nconstruct two extensive text logo datasets, which are 5x more larger than the\nexisting public dataset. Except for the geometric annotations (e.g. text masks\nand character recognition), we also compliment with comprehensive layout\ndescriptions in natural language format, for more effective training to have\nreasoning ability when dealing with complex layouts and custom user\nconstraints. Experimental studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed\nmodel and datasets, when comparing with previous methods in various benchmarks\nto evaluate geometric aesthetics and human preferences. The code and datasets\nwill be publicly available.",

In this paper, we propose a VLM-based framework that generates\ncontent-aware text logo layouts by integrating multi-modal inputs with user\nconstraints, supporting a more flexible and stable layout design in real-world\napplications. We introduce two model techniques to reduce the computation for\nprocessing multiple glyph images simultaneously, while does not face\nperformance degradation. To support instruction-tuning of out model, we\nconstruct two extensive text logo datasets, which are 5x more larger than the\nexisting public dataset. Except for the geometric annotations (e.g. text masks\nand character recognition), we also compliment with comprehensive layout\ndescriptions in natural language format, for more effective training to have\nreasoning ability when dealing with complex layouts and custom user\nconstraints. Experimental studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed\nmodel and datasets, when comparing with previous methods in various benchmarks\nto evaluate geometric aesthetics and human preferences. The code and datasets\nwill be publicly available."

                "summary": "Several techniques have been proposed to automate code review. Early support\nconsisted in recommending the most suited reviewer for a given change or in\nprioritizing the review tasks. With the advent of deep learning in software\nengineering, the level of automation has been pushed to new heights, with\napproaches able to provide feedback on source code in natural language as a\nhuman reviewer would do. Also, recent work documented open source projects\nadopting Large Language Models (LLMs) as co-reviewers. Although the research in\nthis field is very active, little is known about the actual impact of including\nautomatically generated code reviews in the code review process. While there\nare many aspects worth investigating, in this work we focus on three of them:\n(i) review quality, i.e., the reviewer's ability to identify issues in the\ncode; (ii) review cost, i.e., the time spent reviewing the code; and (iii)\nreviewer's confidence, i.e., how confident is the reviewer about the provided\nfeedback. We run a controlled experiment with 29 experts who reviewed different\nprograms with/without the support of an automatically generated code review.\nDuring the experiment we monitored the reviewers' activities, for over 50 hours\nof recorded code reviews. We show that reviewers consider valid most of the\nissues automatically identified by the LLM and that the availability of an\nautomated review as a starting point strongly influences their behavior:\nReviewers tend to focus on the code locations indicated by the LLM rather than\nsearching for additional issues in other parts of the code. The reviewers who\nstarted from an automated review identified a higher number of low-severity\nissues while, however, not identifying more high-severity issues as compared to\na completely manual process. Finally, the automated support did not result in\nsaved time and did not increase the reviewers' confidence.",

With the advent of deep learning in software\nengineering, the level of automation has been pushed to new heights, with\napproaches able to provide feedback on source code in natural language as a\nhuman reviewer would do. Also, recent work documented open source projects\nadopting Large Language Models (LLMs) as co-reviewers. Although the research in\nthis field is very active, little is known about the actual impact of including\nautomatically generated code reviews in the code review process. While there\nare many aspects worth investigating, in this work we focus on three of them:\n(i) review quality, i.e., the reviewer's ability to identify issues in the\ncode; (ii) review cost, i.e., the time spent reviewing the code; and (iii)\nreviewer's confidence, i.e., how confident is the reviewer about the provided\nfeedback. We run a controlled experiment with 29 experts who reviewed different\nprograms with/without the support of an automatically generated code review.\nDuring the experiment we monitored the reviewers' activities, for over 50 hours\nof recorded code reviews. We show that reviewers consider valid most of the\nissues automatically identified by the LLM and that the availability of an\nautomated review as a starting point strongly influences their behavior:\nReviewers tend to focus on the code locations indicated by the LLM rather than\nsearching for additional issues in other parts of the code. The reviewers who\nstarted from an automated review identified a higher number of low-severity\nissues while, however, not identifying more high-severity issues as compared to\na completely manual process. Finally, the automated support did not result in\nsaved time and did not increase the reviewers' confidence."

While Artificial\nIntelligence (AI), particularly deep learning, has become a key component in\ndefending against phishing attacks, these approaches face critical limitations.\nThe scarcity of publicly available, diverse, and updated data, largely due to\nprivacy concerns, constrains their effectiveness.

To address\nthis gap, we propose the Phishing Evolution Network (PEN), a framework\nleveraging large language models (LLMs) and adversarial training mechanisms to\ncontinuously generate high quality and realistic diverse phishing samples, and\nanalyze features of LLM-provided phishing to understand evolving phishing\npatterns.

Additionally, the use of\nPEN significantly boosts model robustness, reducing detectors' sensitivity to\nperturbations by up to 60%, thereby decreasing attack success rates under\nadversarial conditions.

Inspired by the great success of pre-trained language models (LLMs)\nin natural language processing, this paper proposes a zero-shot load\nforecasting approach using an advanced LLM framework denoted as the Chronos\nmodel. By utilizing its extensive pre-trained knowledge, the Chronos model\nenables accurate load forecasting in data-scarce scenarios without the need for\nextensive data-specific training. Simulation results across five real-world\ndatasets demonstrate that the Chronos model significantly outperforms nine\npopular baseline models for both deterministic and probabilistic load\nforecasting with various forecast horizons (e.g., 1 to 48 hours), even though\nthe Chronos model is neither tailored nor fine-tuned to these specific load\ndatasets. Notably, Chronos reduces root mean squared error (RMSE), continuous\nranked probability score (CRPS), and quantile score (QS) by approximately\n7.34%-84.30%, 19.63%-60.06%, and 22.83%-54.49%, respectively, compared to\nbaseline models. These results highlight the superiority and flexibility of the\nChronos model, positioning it as an effective solution in data-scarce\nscenarios.",

The flare frequency for HR 1099 is one flare per rotation\nperiod. Time-resolved spectroscopy reveals peak flare temperatures of 39.44,\n35.96, and 32.48 MK, emission measures of $7 \\times 10^{53}$ to $8 \\times\n10^{54}$ cm$^{-3}$, global abundances of 0.250, 0.299, and 0.362 $Z_\\odot$, and\npeak X-ray luminosities of $ 10^{31.21-32.29}$ erg s$^{-1}$. The quiescent\nstate is modeled with a three-temperature plasma maintained at 3.02, 6.96, and\n12.53 MK. Elemental abundances during quiescent and flaring states exhibit the\ninverse-FIP effect. We have conducted a comparative analysis of coronal\nabundances with previous studies and found evidence supporting the i-FIP\neffect. The derived flare semi-loop lengths of 6 to 8.9 $\\times 10^{10}$ cm\nwere found to be comparable to the other flares detected on HR 1099; however,\nthey are significantly larger than typical solar flare loops.

Object-goal navigation is crucial to\nenable effective inspections in various settings, often requiring the robot to\nidentify the target object within a large search space. Current object\ninspection methods fall short of human efficiency because they typically cannot\nbootstrap prior and common sense knowledge as humans do. In this paper, we\nintroduce a framework that enables robots to use semantic knowledge from prior\nspatial configurations of the environment and semantic common sense knowledge.\nWe propose SEEK (Semantic Reasoning for Object Inspection Tasks) that combines\nsemantic prior knowledge with the robot's observations to search for and\nnavigate toward target objects more efficiently. SEEK maintains two\nrepresentations: a Dynamic Scene Graph (DSG) and a Relational Semantic Network\n(RSN). The RSN is a compact and practical model that estimates the probability\nof finding the target object across spatial elements in the DSG. We propose a\nnovel probabilistic planning framework to search for the object using\nrelational semantic knowledge. Our simulation analyses demonstrate that SEEK\noutperforms the classical planning and Large Language Models (LLMs)-based\nmethods that are examined in this study in terms of efficiency for object-goal\ninspection tasks.

Task planning under these\nconstraints is essential for enabling autonomous robot operation in domains\nthat require adherence to domain-specific knowledge. Current methods for\ngenerating robot goals and plans rely on common sense knowledge encoded in\nlarge language models. However, these models lack grounding of robot plans to\ndomain-specific knowledge and are not easily transferable between multiple\nsites or customers with different compliance needs. In this work, we present\nSayComply, which enables grounding robotic task planning with operational\ncompliance using retrieval-based language models. We design a hierarchical\ndatabase of operational, environment, and robot embodiment manuals and\nprocedures to enable efficient retrieval of the relevant context under the\nlimited context length of the LLMs. We then design a task planner using a\ntree-based retrieval augmented generation (RAG) technique to generate robot\ntasks that follow user instructions while simultaneously complying with the\ndomain knowledge in the database. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach\nthrough simulations and hardware experiments in real-world scenarios that\nrequire precise context retrieval across various types of context,\noutperforming the standard RAG method. Our approach bridges the gap in\ndeploying robots that consistently adhere to operational protocols, offering a\nscalable and edge-deployable solution for ensuring compliance across varied and\ncomplex real-world environments.

While large language models (LLMs) excel on\ngenerative tasks, their performance on extractive tasks remains debated.\nMethods: We investigated Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Relation Extraction\n(RE) using 1,588 clinical notes from four sources (UT Physicians, MTSamples,\nMIMIC-III, and i2b2). We developed an annotated corpus covering 4 clinical\nentities and 16 modifiers, and compared instruction-tuned LLaMA-2 and LLaMA-3\nagainst BiomedBERT in terms of performance, generalizability, computational\nresources, and throughput to BiomedBERT. Results: LLaMA models outperformed\nBiomedBERT across datasets. With sufficient training data, LLaMA showed modest\nimprovements (1% on NER, 1.5-3.7% on RE); improvements were larger with limited\ntraining data. On unseen i2b2 data, LLaMA-3-70B outperformed BiomedBERT by 7%\n(F1) on NER and 4% on RE. However, LLaMA models required more computing\nresources and ran up to 28 times slower. We implemented \"Kiwi,\" a clinical IE\npackage featuring both models, available at https://kiwi.clinicalnlp.org/.\nConclusion: This study is among the first to develop and evaluate a\ncomprehensive clinical IE system using open-source LLMs. Results indicate that\nLLaMA models outperform BiomedBERT for clinical NER and RE but with higher\ncomputational costs and lower throughputs. These findings highlight that\nchoosing between LLMs and traditional deep learning methods for clinical IE\napplications should remain task-specific, taking into account both performance\nmetrics and practical considerations such as available computing resources and\nthe intended use case scenarios.",

This perspective paper aims to\ndiscuss the inner workings of building LLM-powered medical AI applications and\nintroduces a comprehensive framework for their development. We review existing\nliterature and outline the unique challenges of applying LLMs in specialized\nmedical contexts. Additionally, we introduce a three-step framework to organize\nmedical LLM research activities: 1) Modeling: breaking down complex medical\nworkflows into manageable steps for developing medical-specific models; 2)\nOptimization: optimizing the model performance with crafted prompts and\nintegrating external knowledge and tools, and 3) System engineering:\ndecomposing complex tasks into subtasks and leveraging human expertise for\nbuilding medical AI applications. Furthermore, we offer a detailed use case\nplaybook that describes various LLM-powered medical AI applications, such as\noptimizing clinical trial design, enhancing clinical decision support, and\nadvancing medical imaging analysis. Finally, we discuss various challenges and\nconsiderations for building medical AI applications with LLMs, such as handling\nhallucination issues, data ownership and compliance, privacy, intellectual\nproperty considerations, compute cost, sustainability issues, and responsible\nAI requirements.",

This perspective paper aims to\ndiscuss the inner workings of building LLM-powered medical AI applications and\nintroduces a comprehensive framework for their development. We review existing\nliterature and outline the unique challenges of applying LLMs in specialized\nmedical contexts. Additionally, we introduce a three-step framework to organize\nmedical LLM research activities: 1) Modeling: breaking down complex medical\nworkflows into manageable steps for developing medical-specific models; 2)\nOptimization: optimizing the model performance with crafted prompts and\nintegrating external knowledge and tools, and 3) System engineering:\ndecomposing complex tasks into subtasks and leveraging human expertise for\nbuilding medical AI applications. Furthermore, we offer a detailed use case\nplaybook that describes various LLM-powered medical AI applications, such as\noptimizing clinical trial design, enhancing clinical decision support, and\nadvancing medical imaging analysis. Finally, we discuss various challenges and\nconsiderations for building medical AI applications with LLMs, such as handling\nhallucination issues, data ownership and compliance, privacy, intellectual\nproperty considerations, compute cost, sustainability issues, and responsible\nAI requirements."

On the\nalgorithm side, BitMoD introduces fine-grained data type adaptation that uses a\ndifferent numerical data type to quantize a group of (e.g., 128) weights.\nThrough the careful design of these new data types, BitMoD is able to quantize\nLLM weights to very low precision (e.g., 4 bits and 3 bits) while maintaining\nhigh accuracy. On the hardware side, BitMoD employs a bit-serial processing\nelement to easily support multiple numerical precisions and data types; our\nhardware design includes two key innovations: First, it employs a unified\nrepresentation to process different weight data types, thus reducing the\nhardware cost. Second, it adopts a bit-serial dequantization unit to rescale\nthe per-group partial sum with minimal hardware overhead. Our evaluation on six\nrepresentative LLMs demonstrates that BitMoD significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art LLM quantization and acceleration methods. For discriminative\ntasks, BitMoD can quantize LLM weights to 4-bit with $<\\!0.5\\%$ accuracy loss\non average. For generative tasks, BitMoD is able to quantize LLM weights to\n3-bit while achieving better perplexity than prior LLM quantization scheme.\nCombining the superior model performance with an efficient accelerator design,\nBitMoD achieves an average of $1.69\\times$ and $1.48\\times$ speedups compared\nto prior LLM accelerators ANT and OliVe, respectively.",

Traditional CLIP models, despite their ability for open\nvocabulary classification, require an exhaustive prompt of potential class\nlabels, restricting their application to images of known content or context. To\naddress this, we propose an \"object decoder\" model that is trained on a\nlarge-scale 92M-target dataset of templated object noun sets and LLM-generated\ncaptions to always output the object noun in question. This effectively inverts\nthe CLIP text encoder and allows textual object labels from essentially the\nentire English language to be generated directly from image-derived embedding\nvectors, without requiring any a priori knowledge of the potential content of\nan image, and without any label biases. The trained decoders are tested on a\nmix of manually and web-curated datasets, as well as standard image\nclassification benchmarks, and achieve fine-grained prompt-free prediction\nscores of up to 87.5%, a strong result considering the model must work for any\nconceivable image and without any contextual clues.",

As a result, several LLM-based ABMs have been proposed in the\npast year. While they hold promise, each simulator is specifically designed to\nstudy a particular scenario, making it time-consuming and resource-intensive to\nexplore other phenomena using the same ABM. Additionally, these models simulate\nonly a limited number of agents, whereas real-world social media platforms\ninvolve millions of users. To this end, we propose OASIS, a generalizable and\nscalable social media simulator. OASIS is designed based on real-world social\nmedia platforms, incorporating dynamically updated environments (\\emph{i.e.},\ndynamic social networks and post information), diverse action spaces\n(\\emph{i.e.}, following, commenting), and recommendation systems (\\emph{i.e.},\ninterest-based and hot-score-based). Additionally, OASIS supports large-scale\nuser simulations, capable of modeling up to one million users. With these\nfeatures, OASIS can be easily extended to different social media platforms to\nstudy large-scale group phenomena and behaviors. We replicate various social\nphenomena, including information spreading, group polarization, and herd\neffects across X and Reddit platforms. Moreover, we provide observations of\nsocial phenomena at different agent group scales. We observe that the larger\nagent group scale leads to more enhanced group dynamics and more diverse and\nhelpful agents' opinions.

These libraries expose complex\nAPIs whose correct usage has to follow constraints among multiple\ninterdependent parameters. Developers using these APIs are expected to learn\nabout the constraints through the provided documentations and any discrepancy\nmay lead to unexpected behaviors. However, maintaining correct and consistent\nmulti-parameter constraints in API documentations remains a significant\nchallenge for API compatibility and reliability. To address this challenge, we\npropose an MPDetector for detecting inconsistencies between code and\ndocumentation, specifically focusing on multi-parameter constraints. MPDetector\nidentifies these constraints at the code level by exploring execution paths\nthrough symbolic execution and further extracts corresponding constraints from\ndocumentation using large language models (LLMs). We propose a customized fuzzy\nconstraint logic to reconcile the unpredictability of LLM outputs and detect\nlogical inconsistencies between the code and documentation constraints. We\ncollected and constructed two datasets from four popular data science libraries\nand evaluated MPDetector on them. The results demonstrate that MPDetector can\neffectively detect inconsistency issues with the precision of 92.8%. We further\nreported 14 detected inconsistency issues to the library developers, who have\nconfirmed 11 issues at the time of writing.",

                    "value": "Modern AI- and Data-intensive software systems rely heavily on data science\nand machine learning libraries that provide essential algorithmic\nimplementations and computational frameworks. These libraries expose complex\nAPIs whose correct usage has to follow constraints among multiple\ninterdependent parameters. Developers using these APIs are expected to learn\nabout the constraints through the provided documentations and any discrepancy\nmay lead to unexpected behaviors. However, maintaining correct and consistent\nmulti-parameter constraints in API documentations remains a significant\nchallenge for API compatibility and reliability. To address this challenge, we\npropose an MPDetector for detecting inconsistencies between code and\ndocumentation, specifically focusing on multi-parameter constraints. MPDetector\nidentifies these constraints at the code level by exploring execution paths\nthrough symbolic execution and further extracts corresponding constraints from\ndocumentation using large language models (LLMs). We propose a customized fuzzy\nconstraint logic to reconcile the unpredictability of LLM outputs and detect\nlogical inconsistencies between the code and documentation constraints. We\ncollected and constructed two datasets from four popular data science libraries\nand evaluated MPDetector on them. The results demonstrate that MPDetector can\neffectively detect inconsistency issues with the precision of 92.8%. We further\nreported 14 detected inconsistency issues to the library developers, who have\nconfirmed 11 issues at the time of writing."

In\nresponse, we propose a new defense strategy tailored to counter LLM-driven\ncyberattacks. We introduce Mantis, a defensive framework that exploits LLMs'\nsusceptibility to adversarial inputs to undermine malicious operations. Upon\ndetecting an automated cyberattack, Mantis plants carefully crafted inputs into\nsystem responses, leading the attacker's LLM to disrupt their own operations\n(passive defense) or even compromise the attacker's machine (active defense).\nBy deploying purposefully vulnerable decoy services to attract the attacker and\nusing dynamic prompt injections for the attacker's LLM, Mantis can autonomously\nhack back the attacker. In our experiments, Mantis consistently achieved over\n95% effectiveness against automated LLM-driven attacks. To foster further\nresearch and collaboration, Mantis is available as an open-source tool:\nhttps://github.com/pasquini-dario/project_mantis",

The second phase, designed for where the\nLLM fails to generate correct specifications, applies four mutation operators\nto the model-generated specifications and selects verifiable specifications\nfrom the mutated ones through a novel heuristic selection strategy. We evaluate\nSpecGen on two datasets, including the SV-COMP Java category benchmark and a\nmanually constructed dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that SpecGen\nsucceeds in generating verifiable specifications for 279 out of 385 programs,\noutperforming the existing purely LLM-based approaches and conventional\nspecification generation tools like Houdini and Daikon.

We design a hierarchical\ndatabase of operational, environment, and robot embodiment manuals and\nprocedures to enable efficient retrieval of the relevant context under the\nlimited context length of the LLMs. We then design a task planner using a\ntree-based retrieval augmented generation (RAG) technique to generate robot\ntasks that follow user instructions while simultaneously complying with the\ndomain knowledge in the database.

While large language models (LLMs) excel on\ngenerative tasks, their performance on extractive tasks remains debated.\nMethods: We investigated Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Relation Extraction\n(RE) using 1,588 clinical notes from four sources (UT Physicians, MTSamples,\nMIMIC-III, and i2b2). We developed an annotated corpus covering 4 clinical\nentities and 16 modifiers, and compared instruction-tuned LLaMA-2 and LLaMA-3\nagainst BiomedBERT in terms of performance, generalizability, computational\nresources, and throughput to BiomedBERT. Results: LLaMA models outperformed\nBiomedBERT across datasets. With sufficient training data, LLaMA showed modest\nimprovements (1% on NER, 1.5-3.7% on RE); improvements were larger with limited\ntraining data. On unseen i2b2 data, LLaMA-3-70B outperformed BiomedBERT by 7%\n(F1) on NER and 4% on RE. However, LLaMA models required more computing\nresources and ran up to 28 times slower. We implemented \"Kiwi,\" a clinical IE\npackage featuring both models, available at https://kiwi.clinicalnlp.org/.\nConclusion: This study is among the first to develop and evaluate a\ncomprehensive clinical IE system using open-source LLMs. Results indicate that\nLLaMA models outperform BiomedBERT for clinical NER and RE but with higher\ncomputational costs and lower throughputs. These findings highlight that\nchoosing between LLMs and traditional deep learning methods for clinical IE\napplications should remain task-specific, taking into account both performance\nmetrics and practical considerations such as available computing resources and\nthe intended use case scenarios.",

To verify\nthe effectiveness of SciInstruct, we fine-tuned different language models with\nSciInstruct, i.e., ChatGLM3 (6B and 32B), Llama3-8B-Instruct, and Mistral-7B:\nMetaMath, enhancing their scientific and mathematical reasoning capabilities,\nwithout sacrificing the language understanding capabilities of the base model.\nWe release all codes and SciInstruct at https://github.com/THUDM/SciGLM."

Traditional\nsyntax-based log parsers are efficient and effective, but they often experience\ndecreased accuracy when processing logs that deviate from the predefined rules.\nRecently, large language models (LLM) based log parsers have shown superior\nparsing accuracy. However, existing LLM-based parsers face three main\nchallenges: 1)time-consuming and labor-intensive manual labeling for\nfine-tuning or in-context learning, 2)increased parsing costs due to the vast\nvolume of log data and limited context size of LLMs, and 3)privacy risks from\nusing commercial models like ChatGPT with sensitive log information. To\novercome these limitations, this paper introduces LibreLog, an unsupervised log\nparsing approach that leverages open-source LLMs (i.e., Llama3-8B) to enhance\nprivacy and reduce operational costs while achieving state-of-the-art parsing\naccuracy. LibreLog first groups logs with similar static text but varying\ndynamic variables using a fixed-depth grouping tree. It then parses logs within\nthese groups using three components: i)similarity scoring-based retrieval\naugmented generation: selects diverse logs within each group based on Jaccard\nsimilarity, helping the LLM distinguish between static text and dynamic\nvariables; ii)self-reflection: iteratively query LLMs to refine log templates\nto improve parsing accuracy; and iii) log template memory: stores parsed\ntemplates to reduce LLM queries for improved parsing efficiency. Our evaluation\non LogHub-2.0 shows that LibreLog achieves 25% higher parsing accuracy and\nprocesses logs 2.7 times faster compared to state-of-the-art LLM-based parsers.\nIn short, LibreLog addresses privacy and cost concerns of using commercial LLMs\nwhile achieving state-of-the-arts parsing efficiency and accuracy.",

This extensive\ncomparison (1) benchmarks recent open-source LLMs as metrics and (2) explores\nthe stability and variability of different prompting strategies. We discover\nthat, on the one hand, there are scenarios for which prompts are stable. For\ninstance, some LLMs show idiosyncratic preferences and favor to grade generated\ntexts with textual labels while others prefer to return numeric scores. On the\nother hand, the stability of prompts and model rankings can be susceptible to\nseemingly innocuous changes. For example, changing the requested output format\nfrom \"0 to 100\" to \"-1 to +1\" can strongly affect the rankings in our\nevaluation.
