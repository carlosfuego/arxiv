In this work, we have\nidentified a key pattern: certain seemingly meaningless special tokens (i.e.,\nseparators) contribute disproportionately to attention scores compared to\nsemantically meaningful tokens. This observation suggests that information of\nthe segments between these separator tokens can be effectively condensed into\nthe separator tokens themselves without significant information loss. Guided by\nthis insight, we introduce SepLLM, a plug-and-play framework that accelerates\ninference by compressing these segments and eliminating redundant tokens.\nAdditionally, we implement efficient kernels for training acceleration.\nExperimental results across training-free, training-from-scratch, and\npost-training settings demonstrate SepLLM's effectiveness. Notably, using the\nLlama-3-8B backbone, SepLLM achieves over 50% reduction in KV cache on the\nGSM8K-CoT benchmark while maintaining comparable performance. Furthermore, in\nstreaming settings, SepLLM effectively processes sequences of up to 4 million\ntokens or more while maintaining consistent language modeling capabilities.",

The\nessence of these tasks is to select and save a subset of the most useful\ncandidates (views/indexes/plans) for reuse within given space/time budget\nconstraints. In this paper, based on the View Selection Problem, we propose a\nunified view on these problems. We identify the root causes of the complexity\nof these selection problems and provide a detailed analysis of techniques to\ncope with them. Our survey provides a modern classification of selection\nalgorithms known in the literature, including the latest ones based on Machine\nLearning. We provide a ground for the reuse of the selection techniques between\ndifferent optimization scenarios and highlight challenges and promising\ndirections in the field."

Unfortunately, existing\nmethods for fusing multi-exposure images in dynamic scenes are designed for\nlow-resolution images, which makes them inefficient for generating high-quality\nUHD images on a resource-constrained device. To alleviate the limitations of\nextremely long-sequence inputs, inspired by the Large Language Model (LLM) for\nprocessing infinitely long texts, we propose a novel learning paradigm to\nachieve UHD multi-exposure dynamic scene image fusion on a single\nconsumer-grade GPU, named Infinite Pixel Learning (IPL). The design of our\napproach comes from three key components: The first step is to slice the input\nsequences to relieve the pressure generated by the model processing the data\nstream; Second, we develop an attention cache technique, which is similar to KV\ncache for infinite data stream processing; Finally, we design a method for\nattention cache compression to alleviate the storage burden of the cache on the\ndevice. In addition, we provide a new UHD benchmark to evaluate the\neffectiveness of our method. Extensive experimental results show that our\nmethod maintains high-quality visual performance while fusing UHD dynamic\nmulti-exposure images in real-time (>40fps) on a single consumer-grade GPU.",

                "summary": "The implementation of 5G and the future deployment of 6G necessitate the\nutilization of optical networks that possess substantial capacity and exhibit\nminimal latency. The dynamic arrival and departure of connection requests in\noptical networks result in particular central links experiencing more traffic\nand congestion than non-central links. The occurrence of congested links leads\nto service blocking despite the availability of resources within the network,\nrestricting the efficient utilization of network resources. The available\nalgorithms in the literature that aim to balance load among network links offer\na trade-off between blocking performance and algorithmic complexity, thus\nincreasing service provisioning time. This work proposes a dynamic\nrouting-based congestion-aware routing, modulation, core, and spectrum\nassignment (RMCSA) algorithm for space division multiplexing elastic optical\nnetworks (SDM-EONs). The algorithm finds alternative candidate paths based on\nreal-time link occupancy metrics to minimize blocking due to link congestion\nunder dynamic traffic scenarios. As a result, the algorithm reduces the\nformation of congestion hotspots in the network owing to link-betweenness\ncentrality. We have performed extensive simulations using two realistic network\ntopologies to compare the performance of the proposed algorithm with relevant\nRMCSA algorithms available in the literature. The simulation results verify the\nsuperior performance of our proposed algorithm compared to the benchmark Yen's\nK-shortest paths and K-Disjoint shortest paths RMCSA algorithms in connection\nblocking ratio and spectrum utilization efficiency. To expedite the\nroute-finding process, we present a novel caching strategy that allows the\nproposed algorithm to demonstrate a much-reduced service delay time compared to\nthe recently developed adaptive link weight-based load-balancing RMCSA\nalgorithm.",

Also improved is the IEPE front-end and\npower supply, as well as the firmware of the acquisition system, which can now\nachieve a sample rate of up to 36 kHz while sampling all eight channels. This\npaper documents the hardware and software of OASIS-UROS and provides all\nmaterials required to reproduce the open acquisition system. Lastly, the system\nwas validated against commercial hardware and software in an experimental modal\nanalysis context. This showed that the system performs close to the commercial\none in some aspects with respect to the utilized test case.

This showed that the system performs close to the commercial\none in some aspects with respect to the utilized test case. While OASIS-UROS\ncannot match the full performance of the commercial system, the developed\nsystem can be a viable alternative for students, people in academia, or smaller\ncompanies that have a constrained budget or require complete insight as well as\nadaptability of the hardware and software."

Current MoE models\nare mainly built with expert parallelism on distributed devices. However, it\nusually depends on homogeneous devices to deploy and suffers from heavy\ncommunication overhead and computation redundancy. In this paper, we explore\ndeveloping a \\texttt{H}eterogeneous-aware \\texttt{EX}pert \\texttt{A}llocation\nframework, \\textbf{\\texttt{HEXA-MoE}}, with significantly enhanced computing\nefficiency. It contains two components: ($1$) \\textit{Expert-Specific\nOperators}. We replace the typical general matrix multiplication or grouped\nmatrix multiplication interfaces with our operators, which allows the computing\nto be performed in an in-place manner with \\textbf{ZERO} redundancy.

                "summary": "Despite the efficiency of prompt learning in transferring vision-language\nmodels (VLMs) to downstream tasks, existing methods mainly learn the prompts in\na coarse-grained manner where the learned prompt vectors are shared across all\ncategories. Consequently, the tailored prompts often fail to discern\nclass-specific visual concepts, thereby hindering the transferred performance\nfor classes that share similar or complex visual attributes. Recent advances\nmitigate this challenge by leveraging external knowledge from Large Language\nModels (LLMs) to furnish class descriptions, yet incurring notable inference\ncosts. In this paper, we introduce TextRefiner, a plug-and-play method to\nrefine the text prompts of existing methods by leveraging the internal\nknowledge of VLMs. Particularly, TextRefiner builds a novel local cache module\nto encapsulate fine-grained visual concepts derivedfrom local tokens within the\nimage branch. By aggregating and aligning the cached visual descriptions with\nthe original output of the text branch, TextRefiner can efficiently refine and\nenrich the learned prompts from existing methods without relying on any\nexternal expertise. For example, it improves the performance of CoOp from 71.66\n% to 76.94 % on 11 benchmarks, surpassing CoCoOp which introduces instance-wise\nfeatures for text prompts. Equipped with TextRefiner, PromptKD achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance and is efficient in inference. Our code is relesed\nat https://github.com/xjjxmu/TextRefiner",

Consequently, the tailored prompts often fail to discern\nclass-specific visual concepts, thereby hindering the transferred performance\nfor classes that share similar or complex visual attributes. Recent advances\nmitigate this challenge by leveraging external knowledge from Large Language\nModels (LLMs) to furnish class descriptions, yet incurring notable inference\ncosts. In this paper, we introduce TextRefiner, a plug-and-play method to\nrefine the text prompts of existing methods by leveraging the internal\nknowledge of VLMs. Particularly, TextRefiner builds a novel local cache module\nto encapsulate fine-grained visual concepts derivedfrom local tokens within the\nimage branch. By aggregating and aligning the cached visual descriptions with\nthe original output of the text branch, TextRefiner can efficiently refine and\nenrich the learned prompts from existing methods without relying on any\nexternal expertise. For example, it improves the performance of CoOp from 71.66\n% to 76.94 % on 11 benchmarks, surpassing CoCoOp which introduces instance-wise\nfeatures for text prompts. Equipped with TextRefiner, PromptKD achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance and is efficient in inference. Our code is relesed\nat https://github.com/xjjxmu/TextRefiner"

Notably, the MLLMs are constrained\nby their limited context lengths and the substantial costs while processing\nlong videos. Although several existing methods attempt to reduce visual tokens,\ntheir strategies encounter severe bottleneck, restricting MLLMs' ability to\nperceive fine-grained visual details. In this work, we propose Video-XL, a\nnovel approach that leverages MLLMs' inherent key-value (KV) sparsification\ncapacity to condense the visual input. Specifically, we introduce a new special\ntoken, the Visual Summarization Token (VST), for each interval of the video,\nwhich summarizes the visual information within the interval as its associated\nKV. The VST module is trained by instruction fine-tuning, where two optimizing\nstrategies are offered. 1.Curriculum learning, where VST learns to make small\n(easy) and large compression (hard) progressively. 2. Composite data curation,\nwhich integrates single-image, multi-image, and synthetic data to overcome the\nscarcity of long-video instruction data. The compression quality is further\nimproved by dynamic compression, which customizes compression granularity based\non the information density of different video intervals. Video-XL's\neffectiveness is verified from three aspects. First, it achieves a superior\nlong-video understanding capability, outperforming state-of-the-art models of\ncomparable sizes across multiple popular benchmarks. Second, it effectively\npreserves video information, with minimal compression loss even at 16x\ncompression ratio. Third, it realizes outstanding cost-effectiveness, enabling\nhigh-quality processing of thousands of frames on a single A100 GPU.",

Its cache entry identifies\na unique one-hop sub-query (key) and its result set consisting of immutable\nvertex ids (value). When processing a gR-Tx, the query processor identifies its\nsequence of individual one-hop sub-queries and looks up their results in the\ncache. A cache hit fetches less data from the storage manager and eliminates\nthe requirement to process the one-hop sub-query. A cache miss populates the\ncache asynchronously and in a transactional manner, maintaining the separation\nof read and write paths of our transactional storage manager. A graph read and\nwrite transaction, gRW-Tx, identifies the impacted cache entries and either\ndeletes or updates them. Our implementation of the cache is inside the graph\nquery processing engine and transparent to a user application. We evaluate the\ncache using our eCommerce production workload and with rules that re-write\ngraph queries to maximize the performance enhancements observed with the cache.\nObtained results show the cache enhances 95th and 99th percentile of query\nresponse times by at least 2x and 1.63x, respectively.

Existing methods\nfor vision-language models (VLMs) typically rely on self-attention scores from\nlarge language models (LLMs) to identify and prune irrelevant tokens. However,\nthese approaches overlook the inherent distributional discrepancies between\nmodalities, often leading to inaccurate token importance estimation and the\nover-pruning of critical visual tokens. To address this, we propose decomposing\nattention scores into intra-modality attention (within the same modality) and\ninter-modality attention (across modalities), enabling more precise KV cache\npruning by independently managing these distinct attention types. Additionally,\nwe introduce an n-softmax function to counteract distribution shifts caused by\npruning, preserving the original smoothness of attention scores and ensuring\nstable performance. Our final training-free method,\n\\textbf{C}ross-\\textbf{S}elf \\textbf{P}runing (CSP), achieves competitive\nperformance compared to models with full KV caches while significantly\noutperforming previous pruning methods. Extensive evaluations on MileBench, a\nbenchmark encompassing 29 multimodal datasets, demonstrate CSP's effectiveness,\nachieving up to a 41\\% performance improvement on challenging tasks like\nconversational embodied dialogue while reducing the KV cache budget by 13.6\\%.\nThe code is available at https://github.com/TerryPei/CSP",

                "summary": "Training and serving long-context large language models (LLMs) incurs\nsubstantial overhead. To address this, two critical steps are often required: a\npretrained LLM typically undergoes a separate stage for context length\nextension by training on long-context data, followed by architectural\nmodifications to reduce the overhead of KV cache during serving. This paper\nargues that integrating length extension with a GPU-friendly KV cache reduction\narchitecture not only reduces training overhead during length extension, but\nalso achieves better long-context performance. This leads to our proposed\nLongGen, which finetunes a pretrained LLM into an efficient architecture during\nlength extension. LongGen builds on three key insights: (1) Sparse attention\npatterns, such as window attention (attending to recent tokens), attention sink\n(initial ones), and blockwise sparse attention (strided token blocks) are\nwell-suited for building efficient long-context models, primarily due to their\nGPU-friendly memory access patterns, enabling efficiency gains not just\ntheoretically but in practice as well. (2) It is essential for the model to\nhave direct access to all tokens. A hybrid architecture with 1/3 full attention\nlayers and 2/3 efficient ones achieves a balanced trade-off between efficiency\nand long-context performance. (3) Lightweight training on 5B long-context data\nis sufficient to extend the hybrid model's context length from 4K to 128K.\n  We evaluate LongGen on both Llama-2 7B and Llama-2 70B, demonstrating its\neffectiveness across different scales. During training with 128K-long contexts,\nLongGen achieves 1.55x training speedup and reduces wall-clock time by 36%,\ncompared to a full-attention baseline. During inference, LongGen reduces KV\ncache memory by 62%, achieving 1.67x prefilling speedup and 1.41x decoding\nspeedup.",

To address this, two critical steps are often required: a\npretrained LLM typically undergoes a separate stage for context length\nextension by training on long-context data, followed by architectural\nmodifications to reduce the overhead of KV cache during serving. This paper\nargues that integrating length extension with a GPU-friendly KV cache reduction\narchitecture not only reduces training overhead during length extension, but\nalso achieves better long-context performance. This leads to our proposed\nLongGen, which finetunes a pretrained LLM into an efficient architecture during\nlength extension. LongGen builds on three key insights: (1) Sparse attention\npatterns, such as window attention (attending to recent tokens), attention sink\n(initial ones), and blockwise sparse attention (strided token blocks) are\nwell-suited for building efficient long-context models, primarily due to their\nGPU-friendly memory access patterns, enabling efficiency gains not just\ntheoretically but in practice as well. (2) It is essential for the model to\nhave direct access to all tokens. A hybrid architecture with 1/3 full attention\nlayers and 2/3 efficient ones achieves a balanced trade-off between efficiency\nand long-context performance. (3) Lightweight training on 5B long-context data\nis sufficient to extend the hybrid model's context length from 4K to 128K.\n  We evaluate LongGen on both Llama-2 7B and Llama-2 70B, demonstrating its\neffectiveness across different scales. During training with 128K-long contexts,\nLongGen achieves 1.55x training speedup and reduces wall-clock time by 36%,\ncompared to a full-attention baseline. During inference, LongGen reduces KV\ncache memory by 62%, achieving 1.67x prefilling speedup and 1.41x decoding\nspeedup."

To address these challenges, we introduce LeanKV, a unified KV cache\ncompression framework that enhances LLM serving efficiency without compromising\naccuracy through three innovations: (1) Hetero-KV quantization, which stores\nkeys at a higher precision than values to reflect their greater impact on\nattention computations; (2) per-head dynamic sparsity, which allocates memory\nbased on token importance per head and per request; and (3) unified KV\ncompression, integrating mixed-precision quantization and selective pruning to\nenable a smooth tradeoff between model accuracy and memory efficiency. To\nefficiently support these techniques, LeanKV introduces systems optimizations\nincluding unified paging and on-GPU parallel memory management. Implemented on\nvLLM, LeanKV compresses the KV cache by $3.0\\times$ to $5.0\\times$ without\naccuracy loss and up to $11.0\\times$ with under 5% accuracy loss, enhancing\nthroughput by $1.9\\times$ to $2.5\\times$, and up to $6.9\\times$.",

The data migration between storing\ntiers of HSS is the way to achieve the cost-performance goal. The bandwidth\ncontrol is to limit the maximum amount of data migration. Most of previous\nresearch about HSS focus on studying the data migration policy instead of\nbandwidth control. However, the recent research about cache and networking\noptimization suggest that the bandwidth control has significant impact on the\nsystem performance. Few previous work achieves a satisfactory bandwidth control\nin HSS since it is hard to control bandwidth for so many data migration tasks\nsimultaneously. In this paper, we first give a stochastic programming model to\nformalize the bandwidth control problem in HSS. Then we propose a\nlearning-aided bandwidth control policy for HSS, named \\Pascal{}, which learns\nto control the bandwidth of different data migration task in an cooperative\nway. We implement \\Pascal{} on a commercial HSS and compare it with three\nstrong baselines over a group of workloads. Our evaluation on the physical\nsystem shows that \\Pascal{} can effectively decrease 1.95X the tail latency and\ngreatly improve throughput stability (2X $\\downarrow$ throughput jitter), and\nmeanwhile keep the throughput at a relatively high level.",

                "summary": "Transformers can capture long-range dependencies using self-attention,\nallowing tokens to attend to all others directly. However, stacking multiple\nattention layers leads to attention concentration. One natural way to address\nthis issue is to use cross-layer attention, allowing information from earlier\nlayers to be directly accessible to later layers. However, this approach is\ncomputationally expensive. To address this problem, we propose Transformer with\nresidual value (ResFormer) which approximates cross-layer attention through\nadding a residual connection from the values of the the first layer to all\nsubsequent layers. Based on this method, one variant is the Transformer with\nsingle layer value (SVFormer), where all layers share the same value embedding\nfrom first layer.

                    "value": "Transformers can capture long-range dependencies using self-attention,\nallowing tokens to attend to all others directly. However, stacking multiple\nattention layers leads to attention concentration. One natural way to address\nthis issue is to use cross-layer attention, allowing information from earlier\nlayers to be directly accessible to later layers. However, this approach is\ncomputationally expensive. To address this problem, we propose Transformer with\nresidual value (ResFormer) which approximates cross-layer attention through\nadding a residual connection from the values of the the first layer to all\nsubsequent layers. Based on this method, one variant is the Transformer with\nsingle layer value (SVFormer), where all layers share the same value embedding\nfrom first layer.

Furthermore, this analysis is\nperformed for each county for the years 2012 and 2022 to assess changes in the\noxidative nature and quantify regional and local contributions to ozone over a\n10-year period. All studied counties--except for Washington County--in Utah\nwere found to be VOC-limited in 2012. This shifted in 2022, with most counties\nbeing either in a transitional state or $\\mathrm{NO_x}$-limited. Local\ncontributions to ozone increased in two major counties, Cache and Salt Lake\nCounties, but decreased in Carbon, Davis, Duchesne, Uinta, Utah, Washington,\nand Weber Counties. Generally, the regional contributions to oxidant\nconcentrations decreased across the state. A summertime spike in both regional\nand local contributions to oxidants was observed. Smoke from wildfires was\nfound to increase regional contributions to oxidants and shift the local regime\nto be more $\\mathrm{NO_x}$-limited.",

All studied counties--except for Washington County--in Utah\nwere found to be VOC-limited in 2012. This shifted in 2022, with most counties\nbeing either in a transitional state or $\\mathrm{NO_x}$-limited. Local\ncontributions to ozone increased in two major counties, Cache and Salt Lake\nCounties, but decreased in Carbon, Davis, Duchesne, Uinta, Utah, Washington,\nand Weber Counties. Generally, the regional contributions to oxidant\nconcentrations decreased across the state. A summertime spike in both regional\nand local contributions to oxidants was observed. Smoke from wildfires was\nfound to increase regional contributions to oxidants and shift the local regime\nto be more $\\mathrm{NO_x}$-limited."

Although deeper and larger neural networks\ncan significantly improve performance, their substantial memory requirements\nhinder training on consumer GPUs. In this paper, we explore a memory-efficient\ntraining strategy for deep speaker embedding learning in resource-constrained\nscenarios. Firstly, we conduct a systematic analysis of GPU memory allocation\nduring SV system training. Empirical observations show that activations and\noptimizer states are the main sources of memory consumption. For activations,\nwe design two types of reversible neural networks which eliminate the need to\nstore intermediate activations during back-propagation, thereby significantly\nreducing memory usage without performance loss. For optimizer states, we\nintroduce a dynamic quantization approach that replaces the original 32-bit\nfloating-point values with a dynamic tree-based 8-bit data type. Experimental\nresults on VoxCeleb demonstrate that the reversible variants of ResNets and\nDF-ResNets can perform training without the need to cache activations in GPU\nmemory. In addition, the 8-bit versions of SGD and Adam save 75% of memory\ncosts while maintaining performance compared to their 32-bit counterparts.\nFinally, a detailed comparison of memory usage and performance indicates that\nour proposed models achieve up to 16.2x memory savings, with nearly identical\nparameters and performance compared to the vanilla systems. In contrast to the\nprevious need for multiple high-end GPUs such as the A100, we can effectively\ntrain deep speaker embedding extractors with just one or two consumer-level\n2080Ti GPUs.",

We maximize the\nsystem sum rate by deriving closed form solutions for optimal power allocation.\nSimulation results demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed model\nover other potential combinations of uplink NOMA and D2D communications."

Amidst this revolution, Digital\nTwin (DT) emerges as a transformative innovation that seamlessly integrates\nreal-world systems with their virtual counterparts, bridging the physical and\ndigital realms. In this article, we present a comprehensive survey of the\nemerging DT-enabled services and applications across industries, beginning with\nan overview of DT fundamentals and its components to a discussion of key\nenabling technologies for DT. Different from literature works, we investigate\nand analyze the capabilities of DT across a wide range of industrial services,\nincluding data sharing, data offloading, integrated sensing and communication,\ncontent caching, resource allocation, wireless networking, and metaverse. In\nparticular, we present an in-depth technical discussion of the roles of DT in\nindustrial applications across various domains, including manufacturing,\nhealthcare, transportation, energy, agriculture, space, oil and gas, as well as\nrobotics. Throughout the technical analysis, we delve into real-time data\ncommunications between physical and virtual platforms to enable industrial DT\nnetworking. Subsequently, we extensively explore and analyze a wide range of\nmajor privacy and security issues in DT-based industry. Taxonomy tables and the\nkey research findings from the survey are also given, emphasizing important\ninsights into the significance of DT in industries. Finally, we point out\nfuture research directions to spur further research in this promising area.",

Different from the existing\nmulti-antenna coded caching problems, we introduce a passive RIS (with limited\nnumber of units) into the systems to further increase the multicast gain (i.e.,\ndegrees of freedom (DoF)) in the transmission, which is done by using\nRIS-assisted interference nulling. That is, by using RIS, we can `erase' any\npath between one transmission antenna and one receive antenna. We first propose\na new RIS-assisted interference nulling approach to search for the phase-shift\ncoefficients of RIS for the sake of interference nulling, which converges\nfaster than the state-of-the-art algorithm. After erasing some paths in each\ntime slot, the delivery can be divided into several non-overlapping groups\nincluding transmission antennas and users, where in each group the transmission\nantennas serve the contained users without suffering interference from the\ntransmissions by other groups. The division of groups for the sake of\nmaximizing the DoF could be formulated into a combinatorial optimization\nproblem.

In this work, we identify\nthree main challenges that result in this overhead. 1) Inadequate I/O\nutilization. 2) GPU idleness. 3) Unnecessary I/O transmission during multi-turn\nconversations. Our key insight is that the block-based KV cache memory policy\nin existing systems, while achieving near-zero memory waste, leads to\ndiscontinuity and insufficient granularity in the KV cache memory. To respond,\nwe introduce FastSwitch, a fairness-aware serving system that not only aligns\nwith existing KV cache memory allocation policy but also mitigates context\nswitching overhead. Our evaluation shows that FastSwitch outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art LLM serving system vLLM with speedups of 1.4-11.2x across\ndifferent tail TTFT and TBT.",

In this work, we identify\nthree main challenges that result in this overhead. 1) Inadequate I/O\nutilization. 2) GPU idleness. 3) Unnecessary I/O transmission during multi-turn\nconversations. Our key insight is that the block-based KV cache memory policy\nin existing systems, while achieving near-zero memory waste, leads to\ndiscontinuity and insufficient granularity in the KV cache memory. To respond,\nwe introduce FastSwitch, a fairness-aware serving system that not only aligns\nwith existing KV cache memory allocation policy but also mitigates context\nswitching overhead. Our evaluation shows that FastSwitch outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art LLM serving system vLLM with speedups of 1.4-11.2x across\ndifferent tail TTFT and TBT."

Valleys in Utah create ideal environments\nfor extended cold-pool events. In this review, we summarize air quality\nresearch conducted in Utah over the past 20 years (2002-2022) by dividing the\nstate into six regions: Utah Valley, Summit County, Southern Utah (regions\nsouth of Utah Valley), Cache Valley, Uinta Basin, and Salt Lake Valley. We\nreview the published literature chronologically and provide a summary for each\nregion, identifying areas where additional research is warranted. We found that\nresearch efforts are heavily weighted toward the Uinta Basin and Salt Lake\nValley, with the remaining regions collectively accounting for only 20% of\nstudies. We identified the need for more source apportionment studies,\nspeciated volatile organic compound (VOC) analyses, and ozone isopleths.

We\nintroduce a system that solves this problem in two stages; we first reconstruct\nthe geometry powered by neural volumetric rendering NeuS, followed by inverse\nneural radiosity that uses the previously predicted geometry to estimate albedo\nand roughness. However, such a naive combination fails and we propose multiple\ntechnical contributions that enable this two-stage approach. We observe that\nNeuS fails to handle near-field illumination and strong specular reflections\nfrom the flashlight in a scene. We propose to implicitly model the effects of\nnear-field illumination and introduce a surface angle loss function to handle\nspecular reflections. Similarly, we observe that invNeRad assumes constant\nillumination throughout the capture and cannot handle moving flashlights during\ncapture. We propose a light position-aware radiance cache network and\nadditional smoothness priors on roughness to reconstruct reflectance.\nExperimental evaluation on synthetic and real data shows that our method\noutperforms the existing co-located light-camera-based inverse rendering\ntechniques.

In this work, we have\nidentified a key pattern: certain seemingly meaningless special tokens (i.e.,\nseparators) contribute disproportionately to attention scores compared to\nsemantically meaningful tokens. This observation suggests that information of\nthe segments between these separator tokens can be effectively condensed into\nthe separator tokens themselves without significant information loss. Guided by\nthis insight, we introduce SepLLM, a plug-and-play framework that accelerates\ninference by compressing these segments and eliminating redundant tokens.\nAdditionally, we implement efficient kernels for training acceleration.\nExperimental results across training-free, training-from-scratch, and\npost-training settings demonstrate SepLLM's effectiveness. Notably, using the\nLlama-3-8B backbone, SepLLM achieves over 50% reduction in KV cache on the\nGSM8K-CoT benchmark while maintaining comparable performance. Furthermore, in\nstreaming settings, SepLLM effectively processes sequences of up to 4 million\ntokens or more while maintaining consistent language modeling capabilities.",

Extensive experiments\non LLaMA-V1/V2, Vicuna, Baichuan, and Bloom across various benchmarks\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of HyWIA in pruning LLMs. For example, HyWIA\nsurpasses the cutting-edge LLM-Pruner by an average margin of 2.82\\% in\naccuracy across seven downstream tasks when pruning LLaMA-7B by 50\\%.",

                "summary": "Drafting radiology reports is a complex task requiring flexibility, where\nradiologists tail content to available information and particular clinical\ndemands. However, most current radiology report generation (RRG) models are\nconstrained to a fixed task paradigm, such as predicting the full ``finding''\nsection from a single image, inherently involving a mismatch between inputs and\noutputs. The trained models lack the flexibility for diverse inputs and could\ngenerate harmful, input-agnostic hallucinations.

However, most current radiology report generation (RRG) models are\nconstrained to a fixed task paradigm, such as predicting the full ``finding''\nsection from a single image, inherently involving a mismatch between inputs and\noutputs.

Recent theories suggest that loss power laws\narise from Zipf's law, a power law observed in domains like natural language.\nOne theory suggests that language scaling laws emerge when Zipf-distributed\ntask quanta are learned in descending order of frequency. In this paper we\nexamine power-law scaling in AlphaZero, a reinforcement learning algorithm,\nusing a theory of language-model scaling. We find that game states in training\nand inference data scale with Zipf's law, which is known to arise from the tree\nstructure of the environment, and examine the correlation between scaling-law\nand Zipf's-law exponents. In agreement with quanta scaling theory, we find that\nagents optimize state loss in descending order of frequency, even though this\norder scales inversely with modelling complexity. We also find that inverse\nscaling, the failure of models to improve with size, is correlated with unusual\nZipf curves where end-game states are among the most frequent states.

This framework is designed to adaptively transfer knowledge from the\nserver's LLM to clients' SLMs while concurrently enriching the LLM with\nclients' unique domain insights. We facilitate token alignment using minimum\nedit distance (MinED) and then selective mutual knowledge transfer between\nclient-side SLMs and a server-side LLM, aiming to collectively enhance their\nperformance. Through extensive experiments across three distinct scenarios, we\nevaluate the effectiveness of FedMKT using various public LLMs and SLMs on a\nrange of NLP text generation tasks.

Our extensive\nexperimental results demonstrate that all the jailbreak attacks have a powerful\neffect on the LLMs. This indicates that all LLMs fail to cover all the\nviolation categories, and they are susceptible to significant jailbreak risks,\nwith even the well-aligned Llama3 facing a maximum attack success rate of 0.88.\nAdditionally, we test jailbreak attacks under eight advanced external defenses\nand find none of the defenses could mitigate the jailbreak attacks entirely.\nOur study offers valuable insights for future research on jailbreak attacks and\ndefenses and serves as a benchmark tool for researchers and practitioners to\nevaluate them effectively."

Methods designed to remove such knowledge must do so from all prompt\ndirections, in a multi-lingual capacity and without degrading general model\nperformance. To this end, we introduce the targeted angular reversal (TARS)\nmethod of knowledge removal from LLMs. The TARS method firstly leverages the\nLLM in combination with a detailed prompt to aggregate information about a\nselected concept in the internal representation space of the LLM. It then\nrefines this approximate concept vector to trigger the concept token with high\nprobability, by perturbing the approximate concept vector with noise and\ntransforming it into token scores with the language model head. The feedforward\nweight vectors in the LLM which operate directly on the internal representation\nspace, and have the highest cosine similarity with this targeting vector, are\nthen replaced by a reversed targeting vector, thus limiting the ability of the\nconcept to propagate through the model. The modularity of the TARS method\nallows for a sequential removal of concepts from Llama 3.1 8B, such as the\nfamous literary detective Sherlock Holmes, and the planet Saturn. It is\ndemonstrated that the probability of triggering target concepts can be reduced\nto 0.00 with as few as 1 TARS edit, whilst simultaneously removing the\nknowledge bi-directionally. Moreover, knowledge is shown to be removed across\nall languages despite only being targeted in English. Importantly, TARS has\nminimal impact on the general model capabilities, as after removing 5 diverse\nconcepts in a modular fashion, there is minimal KL divergence in the next token\nprobabilities of the LLM on large corpora of Wikipedia text (median of 0.0015).",

This device can extract power from\nrandom fluctuations and can be described by a stochastic model, based on an\nunderdamped Langevin equation with white noise, which mimics the dynamics of\nthe piezoelectric material. A crucial point in the modelisation is represented\nby the appropriate description of the coupled load circuit that is necessary to\nharvest electrical energy. We consider a linear load (resistance) and a\nnonlinear load (diode bridge rectifier connected to the parallel of a\ncapacitance and a load resistance), and focus on the characteristic curve of\nthe extracted power as a function of the load resistance, in order to estimate\nthe optimal values of the parameters that maximise the collected energy. In\nboth cases, we find good agreement between the numerical simulations of the\ntheoretical model and the results obtained in experiments. In particular, we\nobserve a non-monotonic behaviour of the characteristic curve which signals the\npresence of an optimal value for the load resistance at which the extracted\npower is maximised. We also address a more theoretical issue, related to the\ninference of the non-equilibrium features of the system from data: we show that\nthe analysis of high-order correlation functions of the relevant variables,\nwhen in the presence of nonlinearities, can represent a simple and effective\ntool to check the irreversible dynamics.",

While accurate estimation of the CATE-function through flexible\nmachine learning procedures provides a tool for prediction of the individual\ntreatment effect, it does not provide further insight into the driving features\nof potential treatment effect heterogeneity. Recent papers have addressed this\nproblem by providing variable importance measures for treatment effect\nheterogeneity. Most of the suggestions have been developed for continuous or\nbinary outcome, while little attention has been given to censored time-to-event\noutcome. In this paper, we extend the treatment effect variable importance\nmeasure (TE-VIM) proposed in Hines et al. (2022) to the survival setting with\ncensored outcome. We derive an estimator for the TE-VIM for two different CATE\nfunctions based on the survival function and RMST, respectively. Along with the\nTE-VIM, we propose a new measure of treatment effect heterogeneity based on the\nbest partially linear projection of the CATE and suggest accompanying\nestimators for that projection. All estimators are based on semiparametric\nefficiency theory, and we give conditions under which they are asymptotically\nlinear. The finite sample performance of the derived estimators are\ninvestigated in a simulation study. Finally, the estimators are applied and\ncontrasted in two real data examples.",

The\ncore of our method is generating event frames from conventional intensity\nframes, and the other is a newly designed Attention Driving State Network\n(ADSN). Compared to event cameras, conventional cameras offer complete\ninformation and lower hardware costs, enabling captured frames to encode rich\nspatial information. However, these textures lack temporal information, posing\nchallenges in effectively identifying driving status. DriveGazen addresses this\nissue from three perspectives. First, we utilize video frames to generate\nrealistic synthetic dynamic vision sensor (DVS) events. Second, we adopt a\nspiking neural network to decode pertinent temporal information. Lastly, ADSN\nextracts crucial spatial cues from corresponding intensity frames and conveys\nspatial attention to convolutional spiking layers during both training and\ninference through a novel guide attention module to guide the feature learning\nand feature enhancement of the event frame. We specifically collected the\nDriving Status (DriveGaze) dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness of our\napproach. Additionally, we validate the superiority of the DriveGazen on the\nSingle-eye Event-based Emotion (SEE) dataset. To the best of our knowledge, our\nmethod is the first to utilize guide attention spiking neural networks and\neye-based event frames generated from conventional cameras for driving status\nrecognition.

However, tables and user questions in\nreal-world applications are more complex and diverse, presenting an unignorable\ngap compared to the existing benchmarks. To fill the gap, we propose a\n\\textbf{M}ult\\textbf{i}-scale spreadsheet benchmark with \\textbf{M}eta\n\\textbf{o}perations for \\textbf{Table} reasoning, named as MiMoTable.\nSpecifically, MiMoTable incorporates two key features. First, the tables in\nMiMoTable are all spreadsheets used in real-world scenarios, which cover seven\ndomains and contain different types.

This trend has spurred active research into\nquantization-aware PEFT techniques, aimed at maintaining model accuracy while\nminimizing memory overhead during both inference and training.

In\nthis paper, we propose L4Q, a method that integrates Quantization-Aware\nTraining (QAT) with LoRA. By employing a memory-optimized layer design, L4Q\nsignificantly reduces QAT's memory overhead, making its training cost\ncomparable to LoRA, while preserving the advantage of QAT in producing fully\nquantized LLMs with high accuracy. Our experiments demonstrate that this\ncombined approach to quantization and fine-tuning achieves superior accuracy\ncompared to decoupled fine-tuning schemes, particularly in 4-bit and 3-bit\nquantization, positioning L4Q as an efficient QAT solution.

Retrieval-based SD methods, one kind of\nmodel-free method, have yielded promising speedup, but they often rely on\nincomplete retrieval resources, inefficient retrieval methods, and are\nconstrained to certain domains. This paper presents a novel retrieval-based\nspeculative decoding method that adapts suffix automaton (SAM) for efficient\nand accurate draft generation by utilizing common text corpus and dynamic text\nsequence. Unlike existing $n$-gram matching methods, SAM-Decoding finds the\nexact longest suffix match, achieving an average time complexity of O(1) per\ngeneration step of SAM update and suffix retrieval. It can also integrate with\nexisting methods, adaptively selecting a draft generation strategy based on\nmatch length to generalize to broader domains. Extensive experiments on\nSpec-Bench show that our method is $18\\%+$ faster than other retrieval-based SD\nmethods. Additionally, when combined with advanced EAGLE-2, it provides an\nadditional speedup of $3.28\\%$ -- $11.13\\%$ across various-sized LLM backbones.\nOur code is available at our\n\\href{https://github.com/hyx1999/SAM-Decoding}{repository}.",

However, their substantial sizes\npose considerable challenges, particularly in computational demands and\ninference speed, due to their quadratic complexity. In this work, we have\nidentified a key pattern: certain seemingly meaningless special tokens (i.e.,\nseparators) contribute disproportionately to attention scores compared to\nsemantically meaningful tokens. This observation suggests that information of\nthe segments between these separator tokens can be effectively condensed into\nthe separator tokens themselves without significant information loss. Guided by\nthis insight, we introduce SepLLM, a plug-and-play framework that accelerates\ninference by compressing these segments and eliminating redundant tokens.\nAdditionally, we implement efficient kernels for training acceleration.\nExperimental results across training-free, training-from-scratch, and\npost-training settings demonstrate SepLLM's effectiveness. Notably, using the\nLlama-3-8B backbone, SepLLM achieves over 50% reduction in KV cache on the\nGSM8K-CoT benchmark while maintaining comparable performance. Furthermore, in\nstreaming settings, SepLLM effectively processes sequences of up to 4 million\ntokens or more while maintaining consistent language modeling capabilities.",

Prior work\nfocuses on learning policies for executing a task specified using LTL, but they\nincorporate the specification into the learning process. Any change to the\nspecification requires retraining the policy, either via fine-tuning or from\nscratch. We present a more flexible approach -- to learn a set of composable\ntask primitive policies that can be used to satisfy arbitrary LTL\nspecifications without retraining or fine-tuning. Task primitives can be\nlearned offline using RL and combined using Boolean composition at deployment.\nThis work focuses on creating and pruning a transition system (TS)\nrepresentation of the environment in order to solve for deterministic,\nnon-ambiguous, and feasible solutions to LTL specifications given an\nenvironment and a set of task primitive policies.

While current Speech LLMs excel at\nshort-form tasks, they struggle with the computational and representational\ndemands of longer audio sequences.

In SPIRAL, SpeechPrune achieves accuracy improvements of 29% and up to\n47% over the original model and the random pruning model at a pruning rate of\n20%, respectively.

Methods:\nAnalyzing publicly available text narratives of police-public interactions\nrecorded by Boston Police Department, we provide humans and IT-LLMs with\nqualitative labelling codebooks and compare labels generated by both, seeking\nto identify situations associated with (i) mental ill health; (ii) substance\nmisuse; (iii) alcohol dependence; and (iv) homelessness.

However, further research\nindicates a high influence of entity exposure during pre-training on the\nperformance of the models. With the advent of large language models (LLMs),\nthese outperform SLMs in a variety of downstream tasks. However, researchers\nare still divided if this is applicable to tasks like entity detection in texts\ndue to issues like hallucination. In this paper, we provide a novel dataset of\nuser-generated metadata and conduct a benchmark and a robustness study using\nrecent LLMs with in-context-learning (ICL). Our results indicate that LLMs in\nthe ICL setting yield higher performance than SLMs. We further uncover the\nlarge impact of entity exposure on the best performing LLM in our study."

                "summary": "The sheer scale of data required to train modern large language models (LLMs)\nposes significant risks, as models are likely to gain knowledge of sensitive\ntopics such as bio-security, as well the ability to replicate copyrighted\nworks. Methods designed to remove such knowledge must do so from all prompt\ndirections, in a multi-lingual capacity and without degrading general model\nperformance. To this end, we introduce the targeted angular reversal (TARS)\nmethod of knowledge removal from LLMs. The TARS method firstly leverages the\nLLM in combination with a detailed prompt to aggregate information about a\nselected concept in the internal representation space of the LLM. It then\nrefines this approximate concept vector to trigger the concept token with high\nprobability, by perturbing the approximate concept vector with noise and\ntransforming it into token scores with the language model head. The feedforward\nweight vectors in the LLM which operate directly on the internal representation\nspace, and have the highest cosine similarity with this targeting vector, are\nthen replaced by a reversed targeting vector, thus limiting the ability of the\nconcept to propagate through the model. The modularity of the TARS method\nallows for a sequential removal of concepts from Llama 3.1 8B, such as the\nfamous literary detective Sherlock Holmes, and the planet Saturn. It is\ndemonstrated that the probability of triggering target concepts can be reduced\nto 0.00 with as few as 1 TARS edit, whilst simultaneously removing the\nknowledge bi-directionally.

                    "value": "The sheer scale of data required to train modern large language models (LLMs)\nposes significant risks, as models are likely to gain knowledge of sensitive\ntopics such as bio-security, as well the ability to replicate copyrighted\nworks. Methods designed to remove such knowledge must do so from all prompt\ndirections, in a multi-lingual capacity and without degrading general model\nperformance. To this end, we introduce the targeted angular reversal (TARS)\nmethod of knowledge removal from LLMs. The TARS method firstly leverages the\nLLM in combination with a detailed prompt to aggregate information about a\nselected concept in the internal representation space of the LLM. It then\nrefines this approximate concept vector to trigger the concept token with high\nprobability, by perturbing the approximate concept vector with noise and\ntransforming it into token scores with the language model head. The feedforward\nweight vectors in the LLM which operate directly on the internal representation\nspace, and have the highest cosine similarity with this targeting vector, are\nthen replaced by a reversed targeting vector, thus limiting the ability of the\nconcept to propagate through the model. The modularity of the TARS method\nallows for a sequential removal of concepts from Llama 3.1 8B, such as the\nfamous literary detective Sherlock Holmes, and the planet Saturn. It is\ndemonstrated that the probability of triggering target concepts can be reduced\nto 0.00 with as few as 1 TARS edit, whilst simultaneously removing the\nknowledge bi-directionally. Moreover, knowledge is shown to be removed across\nall languages despite only being targeted in English. Importantly, TARS has\nminimal impact on the general model capabilities, as after removing 5 diverse\nconcepts in a modular fashion, there is minimal KL divergence in the next token\nprobabilities of the LLM on large corpora of Wikipedia text (median of 0.0015)."

Traditional quadrotor control approaches are limited by\ntheir reliance on flat trajectories or time-consuming optimization, which\nrestricts their flexibility. Recently, RL-based policy has emerged as a\npromising alternative due to its ability to directly map observations to\nactions, reducing the need for detailed system knowledge and actuation\nconstraints. However, a significant challenge remains in bridging the\nsim-to-real gap, where RL-based policies often experience instability when\ndeployed in real world. In this paper, we investigate key factors for learning\nrobust RL-based control policies that are capable of zero-shot deployment in\nreal-world quadrotors. We identify five critical factors and we develop a\nPPO-based training framework named SimpleFlight, which integrates these five\ntechniques. We validate the efficacy of SimpleFlight on Crazyflie quadrotor,\ndemonstrating that it achieves more than a 50% reduction in trajectory tracking\nerror compared to state-of-the-art RL baselines, and achieves 70% improvement\nover the traditional MPC. The policy derived by SimpleFlight consistently\nexcels across both smooth polynominal trajectories and challenging infeasible\nzigzag trajectories on small thrust-to-weight quadrotors. In contrast, baseline\nmethods struggle with high-speed or infeasible trajectories. To support further\nresearch and reproducibility, we integrate SimpleFlight into a GPU-based\nsimulator Omnidrones and provide open-source access to the code and model\ncheckpoints. We hope SimpleFlight will offer valuable insights for advancing\nRL-based quadrotor control. For more details, visit our project website at\nhttps://sites.google.com/view/simpleflight/.",

In response, we propose Seeker, a\nmulti-agent framework inspired by expert developer strategies for exception\nhandling. Seeker uses agents: Scanner, Detector, Predator, Ranker, and Handler\nto assist LLMs in detecting, capturing, and resolving exceptions more\neffectively.

This trend has spurred active research into\nquantization-aware PEFT techniques, aimed at maintaining model accuracy while\nminimizing memory overhead during both inference and training. Previous\nquantization-aware PEFT methods typically apply post-training quantization\n(PTQ) to pre-trained LLMs, followed by PEFT to recover accuracy loss.\nMeanwhile, this approach has limitations in recovering the accuracy loss. In\nthis paper, we propose L4Q, a method that integrates Quantization-Aware\nTraining (QAT) with LoRA. By employing a memory-optimized layer design, L4Q\nsignificantly reduces QAT's memory overhead, making its training cost\ncomparable to LoRA, while preserving the advantage of QAT in producing fully\nquantized LLMs with high accuracy. Our experiments demonstrate that this\ncombined approach to quantization and fine-tuning achieves superior accuracy\ncompared to decoupled fine-tuning schemes, particularly in 4-bit and 3-bit\nquantization, positioning L4Q as an efficient QAT solution.

This paper introduces a novel\n3-dimensional framework that encapsulates the intersection of applications,\nmachine learning methodologies, and hardware devices, particularly emphasizing\nthe role of LLMs. Instead of using multiple machine learning algorithms, our\nframework uses a single, data-centric LLM architecture that can analyze time\nseries, images, and videos.

Specifically, by modelling the\nplayers, strategies and payoffs in a \"game\" of dialogue, we create a binding\nfrom natural language interactions to the conventional symbolic logic of game\ntheory.

We focus on three\ndomains that require different negotiation strategies: scheduling meetings,\ntrading fruit and debate, and evaluate an LLM's generated language when guided\nby solvers. We see that LLMs that follow game-theory solvers result in dialogue\ngenerations that are less exploitable than the control (no guidance from\nsolvers), and the language generated results in higher rewards, in all\nnegotiation domains.

Retrieval-based SD methods, one kind of\nmodel-free method, have yielded promising speedup, but they often rely on\nincomplete retrieval resources, inefficient retrieval methods, and are\nconstrained to certain domains. This paper presents a novel retrieval-based\nspeculative decoding method that adapts suffix automaton (SAM) for efficient\nand accurate draft generation by utilizing common text corpus and dynamic text\nsequence. Unlike existing $n$-gram matching methods, SAM-Decoding finds the\nexact longest suffix match, achieving an average time complexity of O(1) per\ngeneration step of SAM update and suffix retrieval. It can also integrate with\nexisting methods, adaptively selecting a draft generation strategy based on\nmatch length to generalize to broader domains. Extensive experiments on\nSpec-Bench show that our method is $18\\%+$ faster than other retrieval-based SD\nmethods. Additionally, when combined with advanced EAGLE-2, it provides an\nadditional speedup of $3.28\\%$ -- $11.13\\%$ across various-sized LLM backbones.\nOur code is available at our\n\\href{https://github.com/hyx1999/SAM-Decoding}{repository}.",

To address this gap, we propose\nthe Visually Grounded Text-Video Prompting (VG-TVP) method which is a novel\nLLM-empowered Multimodal Procedural Planning (MPP) framework. It generates\ncohesive text and video procedural plans given a specified high-level\nobjective. The main challenges are achieving textual and visual\ninformativeness, temporal coherence, and accuracy in procedural plans. VG-TVP\nleverages the zero-shot reasoning capability of LLMs, the video-to-text\ngeneration ability of the video captioning models, and the text-to-video\ngeneration ability of diffusion models. VG-TVP improves the interaction between\nmodalities by proposing a novel Fusion of Captioning (FoC) method and using\nText-to-Video Bridge (T2V-B) and Video-to-Text Bridge (V2T-B). They allow LLMs\nto guide the generation of visually-grounded text plans and textual-grounded\nvideo plans. To address the scarcity of datasets suitable for MPP, we have\ncurated a new dataset called Daily-Life Task Procedural Plans (Daily-PP). We\nconduct comprehensive experiments and benchmarks to evaluate human preferences\n(regarding textual and visual informativeness, temporal coherence, and plan\naccuracy).

                    "value": "Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have shown promise in procedural\ntasks, but the potential of multimodal instructions augmented by texts and\nvideos to assist users remains under-explored. To address this gap, we propose\nthe Visually Grounded Text-Video Prompting (VG-TVP) method which is a novel\nLLM-empowered Multimodal Procedural Planning (MPP) framework. It generates\ncohesive text and video procedural plans given a specified high-level\nobjective. The main challenges are achieving textual and visual\ninformativeness, temporal coherence, and accuracy in procedural plans. VG-TVP\nleverages the zero-shot reasoning capability of LLMs, the video-to-text\ngeneration ability of the video captioning models, and the text-to-video\ngeneration ability of diffusion models. VG-TVP improves the interaction between\nmodalities by proposing a novel Fusion of Captioning (FoC) method and using\nText-to-Video Bridge (T2V-B) and Video-to-Text Bridge (V2T-B). They allow LLMs\nto guide the generation of visually-grounded text plans and textual-grounded\nvideo plans. To address the scarcity of datasets suitable for MPP, we have\ncurated a new dataset called Daily-Life Task Procedural Plans (Daily-PP). We\nconduct comprehensive experiments and benchmarks to evaluate human preferences\n(regarding textual and visual informativeness, temporal coherence, and plan\naccuracy). Our VG-TVP method outperforms unimodal baselines on the Daily-PP\ndataset."

In this paper, we propose\nText-Video-ProxyNet (TV-ProxyNet), a novel framework designed to decompose the\nconventional 1-to-N relationship of TVR into N distinct 1-to-1 relationships.\nBy replacing a single text query with a series of text proxies, TV-ProxyNet not\nonly broadens the query scope but also achieves a more precise expansion. Each\ntext proxy is crafted through a refined iterative process, controlled by\nmechanisms we term as the director and dash, which regulate the proxy's\ndirection and distance relative to the original text query. This setup not only\nfacilitates more precise semantic alignment but also effectively manages the\ndisparities and noise inherent in multimodal data. Our experiments on three\nrepresentative video-text retrieval benchmarks, MSRVTT, DiDeMo, and ActivityNet\nCaptions, demonstrate the effectiveness of TV-ProxyNet.

Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) address\nthis issue by incorporating human-understandable concepts into the prediction\nprocess, thereby enhancing transparency and interpretability. Since existing\napproaches often rely on large language models (LLMs) to infer concepts, their\nresults may contain inaccurate or incomplete mappings, especially in complex\nvisual domains. We introduce visually Grounded Concept Bottleneck Models\n(GCBM), which derive concepts on the image level using segmentation and\ndetection foundation models. Our method generates inherently interpretable\nconcepts, which can be grounded in the input image using attribution methods,\nallowing interpretations to be traced back to the image plane.

Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) address\nthis issue by incorporating human-understandable concepts into the prediction\nprocess, thereby enhancing transparency and interpretability. Since existing\napproaches often rely on large language models (LLMs) to infer concepts, their\nresults may contain inaccurate or incomplete mappings, especially in complex\nvisual domains. We introduce visually Grounded Concept Bottleneck Models\n(GCBM), which derive concepts on the image level using segmentation and\ndetection foundation models.
