Minimizing last-level cache misses is key to\nmaximizing in-memory index performance, making high cache locality essential.\nIn this paper, we present a practical concurrent B-skiplist that enhances cache\nlocality and performance while preserving the simplicity of traditional\nskiplist structures and concurrency control schemes. Our key contributions\ninclude a top-down, single-pass insertion algorithm for B-skiplists and a\ncorresponding simple and efficient top-down concurrency control scheme. On 128\nthreads, the proposed concurrent B-skiplist achieves between 2x-9x higher\nthroughput compared to state-of-the-art concurrent skiplist implementations,\nincluding Facebook's concurrent skiplist from Folly and the Java\nConcurrentSkipListMap.

For a\nmore complete picture of the performance, we also measure the latency of\nskiplist and tree-based indices and find that the B-skiplist achieves between\n3.5x-103x lower 99% latency compared to other concurrent skiplists and between\n0.85x-64x lower 99% latency compared to tree-based indices on point workloads\nwith inserts.",

Extensive experiments demonstrate that our\nframework achieves significant acceleration (e.g., 2.01 times speedup for\nWan2.1) while maintaining visual fidelity across comprehensive quality metrics,\nestablishing a viable method for efficient video generation."

Step-3 innovates in two key dimensions: (1) A novel\nMulti-Matrix Factorization Attention (MFA) mechanism that significantly reduces\nboth KV cache size and computation while maintaining high attention\nexpressiveness, and (2) Attention-FFN Disaggregation (AFD), a distributed\ninference system that decouples attention and Feed-Forward Network (FFN) layers\ninto specialized subsystems. This co-design achieves unprecedented cost\nefficiency: Step-3 significantly reduces theoretical decoding costs compared\nwith models like DeepSeek-V3 and Qwen3 MoE 235B, with the gains widening at\nlonger context. Step-3 achieves low cost while activating 38B parameters per\ntoken (more than DeepSeek-V3 and Qwen3 MoE 235B), demonstrating that\nhardware-aligned attention arithmetic intensity, MoE sparsity, and AFD are\ncritical to cost-effectiveness. We perform a head-to-head comparison with\nDeepSeek-V3 in its favorable scenarios. Our implementation on Hopper GPUs\nachieves a decoding throughput of up to 4,039 tokens per second per GPU under\n50ms TPOT SLA (4K context, FP8, no MTP). It is higher than DeepSeek-V3's 2,324\nin the same setup and sets a new Pareto frontier for LLM decoding.",

Additionally, we develop an adaptive layer-wise\nbudget allocation strategy that capitalizes on the strength and skewness of\ntoken importance distribution, showcasing superior efficiency compared to\nuniform allocation. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple LVLMs and\nbenchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves comparable performance to the\nfull cache while retaining only 10% of visual KV cache, thereby reducing\ndecoding latency by 29% to 66% across various batch size and prompt length of\ninputs.

Additionally, we develop an adaptive layer-wise\nbudget allocation strategy that capitalizes on the strength and skewness of\ntoken importance distribution, showcasing superior efficiency compared to\nuniform allocation. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple LVLMs and\nbenchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves comparable performance to the\nfull cache while retaining only 10% of visual KV cache, thereby reducing\ndecoding latency by 29% to 66% across various batch size and prompt length of\ninputs. Notably, as cache retention rates decrease, our method exhibits\nincreasing performance advantages over existing approaches."

Privacy-preserving ML\n(PPML) based on cryptographic primitives has emerged as a promising solution in\nwhich an ML model is directly computed on the encrypted data to provide a\nformal privacy guarantee. However, PPML frameworks heavily rely on the\noblivious transfer (OT) primitive to compute nonlinear functions. OT mainly\ninvolves the computation of single-point correlated OT (SPCOT) and learning\nparity with noise (LPN) operations. As OT is still computed extensively on\ngeneral-purpose CPUs, it becomes the latency bottleneck of modern PPML\nframeworks.\n  In this paper, we propose a novel OT accelerator, dubbed Ironman, to\nsignificantly increase the efficiency of OT and the overall PPML framework. We\nobserve that SPCOT is computation-bounded, and thus propose a hardware-friendly\nSPCOT algorithm with a customized accelerator to improve SPCOT computation\nthroughput. In contrast, LPN is memory-bandwidth-bounded due to irregular\nmemory access patterns. Hence, we further leverage the near-memory processing\n(NMP) architecture equipped with memory-side cache and index sorting to improve\neffective memory bandwidth. With extensive experiments, we demonstrate Ironman\nachieves a 39.2-237.4 times improvement in OT throughput across different NMP\nconfigurations compared to the full-thread CPU implementation. For different\nPPML frameworks, Ironman demonstrates a 2.1-3.4 times reduction in end-to-end\nlatency for both CNN and Transformer models.",

Both models\nare trained on large-scale multilingual and multimodal datasets sourced via\nresponsible web crawling, licensed corpora, and high-quality synthetic data,\nthen further refined with supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning on\na new asynchronous platform. The resulting models support several additional\nlanguages while understanding images and executing tool calls. In public\nbenchmarks and human evaluations, both the server model and the on-device model\nmatch or surpass comparably sized open baselines.\n  A new Swift-centric Foundation Models framework exposes guided generation,\nconstrained tool calling, and LoRA adapter fine-tuning, allowing developers to\nintegrate these capabilities with a few lines of code. The latest advancements\nin Apple Intelligence models are grounded in our Responsible AI approach with\nsafeguards like content filtering and locale-specific evaluation, as well as\nour commitment to protecting our users' privacy with innovations like Private\nCloud Compute."

We apply PINT to the ERA5\nWeatherBench dataset, focusing on long-term forecasting of 2m-temperature data.\nPINT incorporates the Simple Harmonic Oscillator Equation as a physics-informed\nprior, embedding its periodic dynamics into RNN, LSTM, and GRU architectures.\nThis equation's analytical solutions (sine and cosine functions) facilitate\nrigorous evaluation of the benefits of incorporating physics-informed\nconstraints. By benchmarking against a linear regression baseline derived from\nits exact solutions, we quantify the impact of embedding physical principles in\ndata-driven models. Unlike traditional time series models that rely on future\nobservations, PINT is designed for practical forecasting. Using only the first\n90 days of observed data, it iteratively predicts the next two years,\naddressing challenges posed by limited real-time updates. Experiments on the\nWeatherBench dataset demonstrate PINT's ability to generalize, capture periodic\ntrends, and align with physical principles.

Caching techniques, which leverage data reuse to reduce\ncomputation, offer opportunities to optimize the performance of LLM inference\nengines. On the one hand, the low-level key-value (KV) cache working at the\ntoken level is widely adopted, albeit it incurs significant overhead as request\nvolume grows. On the other hand, instruction-level caching, which stores full\ninstruction-response pairs, is expected to play an increasingly crucial role.\nHowever, the high variability in the content and length of instructions make it\nrare for identical instructions to recur within a short time window, presenting\nchallenges for effective caching instruction-response pairs. To address this\nchallenge, we propose InstCache, a predictive caching mechanism for LLM serving\nsystems. Leveraging the capability of LLMs, we can effectively reorder the\nrepresentation space of instruction texts and develop a sufficient level of\nspatial locality. Such spatial locality enables us to predict potential\ninstructions located in a compact region in the space, resulting in an\neffective caching system at runtime. Experimental results demonstrate that\nInstCache achieves a 2.3x higher hit rate compared to the upper bound of\ntraditional caching mechanisms on WildChat dataset and reduces the time per\noutput token of vLLM by up to 42.0% and 50.0% on LMSys and Moss datasets,\nrespectively.",

Efficient Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is\ncrucial to address these issues. However, unlike traditional models, diffusion\nmodels critically rely on the time-step for the multi-round denoising.\nTypically, each time-step is encoded into a hypersensitive temporal feature by\nseveral modules. Despite this, existing PTQ methods do not optimize these\nmodules individually. Instead, they employ unsuitable reconstruction objectives\nand complex calibration methods, leading to significant disturbances in the\ntemporal feature and denoising trajectory, as well as reduced compression\nefficiency. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel quantization\nframework that includes three strategies: 1) TIB-based Maintenance: Based on\nour innovative Temporal Information Block (TIB) definition, Temporal\nInformation-aware Reconstruction (TIAR) and Finite Set Calibration (FSC) are\ndeveloped to efficiently align original temporal features. 2) Cache-based\nMaintenance: Instead of indirect and complex optimization for the related\nmodules, pre-computing and caching quantized counterparts of temporal features\nare developed to minimize errors. 3) Disturbance-aware Selection: Employ\ntemporal feature errors to guide a fine-grained selection between the two\nmaintenance strategies for further disturbance reduction. This framework\npreserves most of the temporal information and ensures high-quality end-to-end\ngeneration.

Previous\nresearch has extensively focused on reducing cold-start latency for specific\nfunctions. However, little attention has been given to skewed production\nworkloads. In such cases, cross-function optimization becomes essential.\nWithout cross-function optimization, a cloud provider is left with two equally\npoor options: (i) Either the cloud provider gives up optimization for each\nfunction in the long tail (which is slow); or (ii) the cloud provider applies\nfunction-specific optimizations (e.g., cache function images) to every function\nin the long tail (which violates the vendor's cache constraints). HotSwap\ndemonstrates cross-function optimization using a novel pre-warming strategy. In\nthis strategy, a pre-initialized live dependency image is migrated to the new\nfunction instance. At the same time, HotSwap respects the provider's cache\nconstraints, because a single pre-warmed dependency image in the cache can be\nshared among all serverless functions that require that image. HotSwap has been\ntested on seven representative functions from FunctionBench. In those tests,\nHotSwap accelerates dependency loading for those serverless functions with\nlarge dependency requirements by a factor ranging from 2.2 to 3.2.

The performance of\nReciprocating Locks is competitive with and often better than the best\nstate-of-the-art scalable spin locks."

                "summary": "Modern Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly trained to support very\nlarge context windows. Unfortunately the ability to use long contexts in\ngeneration is complicated by the large memory requirement of the KV cache,\nwhich scales linearly with the context length. This memory footprint is often\nthe dominant resource bottleneck in real-world deployments, limiting throughput\nand increasing serving cost. One way to address this is by compressing the KV\ncache, which can be done either with knowledge of the question being asked\n(query-aware) or without knowledge of the query (query-agnostic). We present\nCompactor, a parameter-free, query-agnostic KV compression strategy that uses\napproximate leverage scores to determine token importance. We show that\nCompactor can achieve the same performance as competing methods while retaining\n1/2 the tokens in both synthetic and real-world context tasks, with minimal\ncomputational overhead. We further introduce a procedure for context-calibrated\ncompression, which allows one to infer the maximum compression ratio a given\ncontext can support. Using context-calibrated compression, we show that\nCompactor achieves full KV performance on Longbench while reducing the KV\nmemory burden by 63%, on average.

                    "value": "Modern Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly trained to support very\nlarge context windows. Unfortunately the ability to use long contexts in\ngeneration is complicated by the large memory requirement of the KV cache,\nwhich scales linearly with the context length. This memory footprint is often\nthe dominant resource bottleneck in real-world deployments, limiting throughput\nand increasing serving cost. One way to address this is by compressing the KV\ncache, which can be done either with knowledge of the question being asked\n(query-aware) or without knowledge of the query (query-agnostic). We present\nCompactor, a parameter-free, query-agnostic KV compression strategy that uses\napproximate leverage scores to determine token importance. We show that\nCompactor can achieve the same performance as competing methods while retaining\n1/2 the tokens in both synthetic and real-world context tasks, with minimal\ncomputational overhead. We further introduce a procedure for context-calibrated\ncompression, which allows one to infer the maximum compression ratio a given\ncontext can support. Using context-calibrated compression, we show that\nCompactor achieves full KV performance on Longbench while reducing the KV\nmemory burden by 63%, on average. To demonstrate the efficacy and\ngeneralizability of our approach, we apply Compactor to 27 synthetic and\nreal-world tasks from RULER and Longbench, with models from both the Qwen 2.5\nand Llama 3.1 families."

To\naddress these issues, we introduce UI-AGILE, a comprehensive framework\nenhancing GUI agents at both the training and inference stages. For training,\nwe propose a suite of improvements to the Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) process:\n1) a Continuous Reward function to incentivize high-precision grounding; 2) a\n\"Simple Thinking\" reward to balance planning with speed and grounding accuracy;\nand 3) a Cropping-based Resampling strategy to mitigate the sparse reward\nproblem and improve learning on complex tasks. For inference, we present\nDecomposed Grounding with Selection, a novel method that dramatically improves\ngrounding accuracy on high-resolution displays by breaking the image into\nsmaller, manageable parts. Experiments show that UI-AGILE achieves the\nstate-of-the-art performance on two benchmarks ScreenSpot-Pro and\nScreenSpot-v2.

To\naddress these issues, we introduce UI-AGILE, a comprehensive framework\nenhancing GUI agents at both the training and inference stages. For training,\nwe propose a suite of improvements to the Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) process:\n1) a Continuous Reward function to incentivize high-precision grounding; 2) a\n\"Simple Thinking\" reward to balance planning with speed and grounding accuracy;\nand 3) a Cropping-based Resampling strategy to mitigate the sparse reward\nproblem and improve learning on complex tasks. For inference, we present\nDecomposed Grounding with Selection, a novel method that dramatically improves\ngrounding accuracy on high-resolution displays by breaking the image into\nsmaller, manageable parts. Experiments show that UI-AGILE achieves the\nstate-of-the-art performance on two benchmarks ScreenSpot-Pro and\nScreenSpot-v2. For instance, using both our proposed training and inference\nenhancement methods brings 23% grounding accuracy improvement over the best\nbaseline on ScreenSpot-Pro."

In this work, we focus\non the specific field of chemistry and develop a Chemical Reasoner LLM,\nChemDFM-R. We first construct a comprehensive dataset of atomized knowledge\npoints to enhance the model's understanding of the fundamental principles and\nlogical structure of chemistry.

Agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well\nin isolated tasks, yet struggle with higher-order cognition required for\nadaptive collaboration. Human teams achieve synergy not only through knowledge\nsharing, but also through recursive reasoning, structured critique, and the\nability to infer others' mental states. Current artificial systems lack these\nessential mechanisms, limiting their ability to engage in sophisticated\ncollective reasoning. This work explores cognitive processes that enable\neffective collaboration, focusing on adaptive theory of mind (ToM) and\nsystematic critical evaluation. We investigate three key questions. First, how\ndoes the ability to model others' perspectives enhance coordination and reduce\nredundant reasoning? Second, to what extent does structured critique improve\nreasoning quality by identifying logical gaps and mitigating biases? Third, the\ninterplay of these mechanisms can lead to emergent cognitive synergy, where the\ncollective intelligence of the system exceeds the sum of its parts. Through an\nempirical case study on complex decision making, we show that the integration\nof these cognitive mechanisms leads to more coherent, adaptive, and rigorous\nagent interactions. This article contributes to the field of cognitive science\nand AI research by presenting a structured framework that emulates human-like\ncollaborative reasoning MAS. It highlights the significance of dynamic ToM and\ncritical evaluation in advancing multi-agent systems' ability to tackle\ncomplex, real-world challenges.",

Current artificial systems lack these\nessential mechanisms, limiting their ability to engage in sophisticated\ncollective reasoning. This work explores cognitive processes that enable\neffective collaboration, focusing on adaptive theory of mind (ToM) and\nsystematic critical evaluation. We investigate three key questions. First, how\ndoes the ability to model others' perspectives enhance coordination and reduce\nredundant reasoning? Second, to what extent does structured critique improve\nreasoning quality by identifying logical gaps and mitigating biases? Third, the\ninterplay of these mechanisms can lead to emergent cognitive synergy, where the\ncollective intelligence of the system exceeds the sum of its parts. Through an\nempirical case study on complex decision making, we show that the integration\nof these cognitive mechanisms leads to more coherent, adaptive, and rigorous\nagent interactions. This article contributes to the field of cognitive science\nand AI research by presenting a structured framework that emulates human-like\ncollaborative reasoning MAS. It highlights the significance of dynamic ToM and\ncritical evaluation in advancing multi-agent systems' ability to tackle\ncomplex, real-world challenges."

Recent advances have focused on analyzing the transition path\nensemble using the committor probability, widely regarded as the most\ninformative one-dimensional reaction coordinate. Consistency between transition\npathways and the committor function is essential for accurate mechanistic\ninsight. In this work, we propose an iterative framework to infer the committor\nand, subsequently, to identify the most relevant transition pathways. Starting\nfrom an initial guess for the transition path, we generate biased sampling from\nwhich we train a neural network to approximate the committor probability. From\nthis learned committor, we extract dominant transition channels as discretized\nstrings lying on isocommittor surfaces. These pathways are then used to enhance\nsampling and iteratively refine both the committor and the transition paths\nuntil convergence.

                    "value": "The discovery of transition pathways to unravel distinct reaction mechanisms\nand, in general, rare events that occur in molecular systems is still a\nchallenge. Recent advances have focused on analyzing the transition path\nensemble using the committor probability, widely regarded as the most\ninformative one-dimensional reaction coordinate. Consistency between transition\npathways and the committor function is essential for accurate mechanistic\ninsight. In this work, we propose an iterative framework to infer the committor\nand, subsequently, to identify the most relevant transition pathways. Starting\nfrom an initial guess for the transition path, we generate biased sampling from\nwhich we train a neural network to approximate the committor probability. From\nthis learned committor, we extract dominant transition channels as discretized\nstrings lying on isocommittor surfaces. These pathways are then used to enhance\nsampling and iteratively refine both the committor and the transition paths\nuntil convergence. The resulting committor enables accurate estimation of the\nreaction rate constant. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on\nbenchmark systems, including a two-dimensional model potential, peptide\nconformational transitions, and a Diels--Alder reaction."

The disconnect between rapid adoption and limited\nconceptual understanding highlights the need for an inquiry into this emerging\nparadigm.

To bridge this gap, we introduce MMAT-1M, the first million-scale\nmultimodal agent tuning dataset designed to support CoT, reflection, and\ndynamic tool usage.

By fine-tuning open-source multimodal models on the MMAT-1M, we observe\nsignificant performance gains.

With\nprompting alone, off-the-shelf LLMs struggle to optimize Ehrlich functions. In\nresponse, we propose LLOME (Language Model Optimization with Margin\nExpectation), a bilevel optimization routine for online black-box optimization.\nWhen combined with a novel preference learning loss, we find LLOME can not only\nlearn to solve some Ehrlich functions, but can even perform as well as or\nbetter than LaMBO-2 on moderately difficult Ehrlich variants. However, LLMs\nalso exhibit some likelihood-reward miscalibration and struggle without\nexplicit rewards.

However, the Group\nRelative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm, which relies on sparse reward\nrules, often encounters the issue of identical rewards within groups, leading\nto the advantage collapse problem. Existing works typically address this\nchallenge from two perspectives: enforcing model reflection to enhance response\ndiversity, and introducing internal feedback to augment the training signal\n(advantage). In this work, we begin by analyzing the limitations of model\nreflection and investigating the policy entropy of responses at the\nfine-grained sample level. Based on our experimental findings, we propose the\nEDGE-GRPO algorithm, which adopts \\textbf{E}ntropy-\\textbf{D}riven Advantage\nand \\textbf{G}uided \\textbf{E}rror Correction to effectively mitigate the\nproblem of advantage collapse.

                    "value": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have made remarkable progress in enhancing\nstep-by-step reasoning through reinforcement learning. However, the Group\nRelative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm, which relies on sparse reward\nrules, often encounters the issue of identical rewards within groups, leading\nto the advantage collapse problem. Existing works typically address this\nchallenge from two perspectives: enforcing model reflection to enhance response\ndiversity, and introducing internal feedback to augment the training signal\n(advantage). In this work, we begin by analyzing the limitations of model\nreflection and investigating the policy entropy of responses at the\nfine-grained sample level. Based on our experimental findings, we propose the\nEDGE-GRPO algorithm, which adopts \\textbf{E}ntropy-\\textbf{D}riven Advantage\nand \\textbf{G}uided \\textbf{E}rror Correction to effectively mitigate the\nproblem of advantage collapse.

In extreme mass-ratio inspiral binary(EMRI) systems, orbital\neccentricity is a critical parameter for PE. However, current software for for\nPE of GW often neglects the direct estimation of orbital eccentricity. To fill\nthis gap, we have developed the MatBYIB, a MATLAB-based software package for PE\nof GW with arbitrary eccentricity. The MatBYIB employs the Analytical Kludge\n(AK) waveform as a computationally efficient signal generator and computes\nparameter uncertainties via the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) and the Markov\nChain Monte Carlo (MCMC). For Bayesian inference, we implement the\nMetropolis-Hastings (M-H) algorithm to derive posterior distributions. To\nguarantee convergence, the Gelman-Rubin convergence criterion (the Potential\nScale Reduction Factor R) is used to determine sampling adequacy, with MatBYIB\ndynamically increasing the sample size until R < 1.05 for all parameters. Our\nresults demonstrate strong agreement between FIM- based predictions and full\nMCMC sampling. This program is user-friendly and allows for estimation of\ngravitational wave parameters with arbitrary eccentricity on standard personal\ncomputers.

To reliably\nidentify this sequence, RRTO integrates a novel Operator Sequence Search\nalgorithm that detects repeated patterns, filters initialization noise, and\naccelerates matching via a two-level strategy. Evaluation demonstrates that\nRRTO achieves substantial reductions of up to 98% in both per-inference latency\nand energy consumption compared to state-of-the-art transparent methods and\nyields results comparable to non-transparent approaches, all without\nnecessitating any source code modification."

One of UVEX's prime objectives is to follow up\ngravitational wave (GW) binary neutron star mergers as targets of opportunity\n(ToOs), rapidly scanning across their localization regions to search for their\nkilonova (KN) counterparts. Early-time multiband ultraviolet light curves of\nKNe are key to explaining the interplay between jet and ejecta in binary\nneutron star mergers. Owing to high Galactic extinction in the ultraviolet and\nthe variation of GW distance estimates over the sky, the sensitivity to\nkilonovae can vary significantly across the GW localization and even across the\nfootprint of a single image given UVEX's large field of view. Good ToO\nobserving strategies to trade off between area and depth are neither simple nor\nobvious. We present an optimal strategy for GW follow-up with UVEX in which\nexposure time is adjusted dynamically for each field individually to maximize\nthe overall probability of detection. We model the scheduling problem using the\nexpressive and powerful mathematical framework of mixed integer linear\nprogramming (MILP), and employ a state-of-the-art MILP solver to automatically\ngenerate observing plan timelines that achieve high probabilities of kilonova\ndetection. We have implemented this strategy in an open-source astronomical\nscheduling software package called the Multi-Mission Multi-Messenger\nObservation Planning Toolkit, on GitHub at https://github.com/m4opt/m4opt.",

One of UVEX's prime objectives is to follow up\ngravitational wave (GW) binary neutron star mergers as targets of opportunity\n(ToOs), rapidly scanning across their localization regions to search for their\nkilonova (KN) counterparts. Early-time multiband ultraviolet light curves of\nKNe are key to explaining the interplay between jet and ejecta in binary\nneutron star mergers. Owing to high Galactic extinction in the ultraviolet and\nthe variation of GW distance estimates over the sky, the sensitivity to\nkilonovae can vary significantly across the GW localization and even across the\nfootprint of a single image given UVEX's large field of view. Good ToO\nobserving strategies to trade off between area and depth are neither simple nor\nobvious. We present an optimal strategy for GW follow-up with UVEX in which\nexposure time is adjusted dynamically for each field individually to maximize\nthe overall probability of detection. We model the scheduling problem using the\nexpressive and powerful mathematical framework of mixed integer linear\nprogramming (MILP), and employ a state-of-the-art MILP solver to automatically\ngenerate observing plan timelines that achieve high probabilities of kilonova\ndetection. We have implemented this strategy in an open-source astronomical\nscheduling software package called the Multi-Mission Multi-Messenger\nObservation Planning Toolkit, on GitHub at https://github.com/m4opt/m4opt."

                "summary": "Recently, the field of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) has gained popularity as\nresearchers are trying to develop artificial intelligence capable of efficient\ncollective reasoning. Agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well\nin isolated tasks, yet struggle with higher-order cognition required for\nadaptive collaboration. Human teams achieve synergy not only through knowledge\nsharing, but also through recursive reasoning, structured critique, and the\nability to infer others' mental states. Current artificial systems lack these\nessential mechanisms, limiting their ability to engage in sophisticated\ncollective reasoning. This work explores cognitive processes that enable\neffective collaboration, focusing on adaptive theory of mind (ToM) and\nsystematic critical evaluation. We investigate three key questions. First, how\ndoes the ability to model others' perspectives enhance coordination and reduce\nredundant reasoning? Second, to what extent does structured critique improve\nreasoning quality by identifying logical gaps and mitigating biases? Third, the\ninterplay of these mechanisms can lead to emergent cognitive synergy, where the\ncollective intelligence of the system exceeds the sum of its parts. Through an\nempirical case study on complex decision making, we show that the integration\nof these cognitive mechanisms leads to more coherent, adaptive, and rigorous\nagent interactions. This article contributes to the field of cognitive science\nand AI research by presenting a structured framework that emulates human-like\ncollaborative reasoning MAS.

As\nwireless systems evolve every decade, the development of accurate and\nstandardized channel models becomes increasingly important for the development,\nevaluation and performance assessment of emerging technologies. An effort to\ndevelop a standardized channel model began around 2000 through the Third\nGeneration Partnership Project (3GPP) and the International Telecommunication\nUnion (ITU) with the aim of addressing a broad range of frequencies from sub-1\nGHz to 100 GHz. Prior efforts focused heavily on sub-6 GHz bands and mmWave\nbands, and there exist some gaps in accurately modeling the 7-24 GHz frequency\nrange, a promising candidate band for 6G. To address these gaps, 3GPP approved\na Release (Rel) 19 channel modeling study. This study resulted in several\nenhancements to the channel models, including the ability to accurately model a\nSuburban Macrocell (SMa) scenario, realistic User Terminal (UT) antenna models,\nvariability in the number of clusters, variability in the number of rays per\ncluster, a framework for capturing variability in power among all\npolarizations, near field (NF) propagation, and spatial non-stationarity (SNS)\neffects, all of which may be crucial for future 6G deployments. This paper\npresents the outcomes of this study and provides an overview of the underlying\nrationale, and key discussions that guided the validation, refinement, and\nenhancements of the 3GPP TR 38.901 channel models.",

To bridge this gap, we introduce MMAT-1M, the first million-scale\nmultimodal agent tuning dataset designed to support CoT, reflection, and\ndynamic tool usage. Our dataset is constructed through a novel four-stage data\nengine: 1) We first curate publicly available multimodal datasets containing\nquestion-answer pairs; 2) Then, leveraging GPT-4o, we generate rationales for\nthe original question-answer pairs and dynamically integrate API calls and\nRetrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) information through a multi-turn paradigm;\n3) Furthermore, we refine the rationales through reflection to ensure logical\nconsistency and accuracy, creating a multi-turn dialogue dataset with both\nRationale and Reflection (RR); 4) Finally, to enhance efficiency, we optionally\ncompress multi-turn dialogues into a One-turn Rationale and Reflection (ORR)\nformat. By fine-tuning open-source multimodal models on the MMAT-1M, we observe\nsignificant performance gains. For instance, the InternVL2.5-8B-RR model\nachieves an average improvement of 2.7% across eight public benchmarks and 8.8%\non the RAG benchmark Dyn-VQA, demonstrating the dataset's effectiveness in\nenhancing multimodal reasoning and tool-based capabilities. The dataset is\npublicly available at https://github.com/VIS-MPU-Agent/MMAT-1M.",

On the other hand, specialized solvers like\nLaMBO-2 offer efficiency and fine-grained control but require more domain\nexpertise. Comparing these approaches is challenging due to expensive\nlaboratory validation and inadequate synthetic benchmarks. We address this by\nintroducing Ehrlich functions, a synthetic test suite that captures the\ngeometric structure of biophysical sequence optimization problems. With\nprompting alone, off-the-shelf LLMs struggle to optimize Ehrlich functions. In\nresponse, we propose LLOME (Language Model Optimization with Margin\nExpectation), a bilevel optimization routine for online black-box optimization.\nWhen combined with a novel preference learning loss, we find LLOME can not only\nlearn to solve some Ehrlich functions, but can even perform as well as or\nbetter than LaMBO-2 on moderately difficult Ehrlich variants. However, LLMs\nalso exhibit some likelihood-reward miscalibration and struggle without\nexplicit rewards. Our results indicate LLMs can occasionally provide\nsignificant benefits, but specialized solvers are still competitive and incur\nless overhead.",

Comparing these approaches is challenging due to expensive\nlaboratory validation and inadequate synthetic benchmarks. We address this by\nintroducing Ehrlich functions, a synthetic test suite that captures the\ngeometric structure of biophysical sequence optimization problems. With\nprompting alone, off-the-shelf LLMs struggle to optimize Ehrlich functions. In\nresponse, we propose LLOME (Language Model Optimization with Margin\nExpectation), a bilevel optimization routine for online black-box optimization.\nWhen combined with a novel preference learning loss, we find LLOME can not only\nlearn to solve some Ehrlich functions, but can even perform as well as or\nbetter than LaMBO-2 on moderately difficult Ehrlich variants. However, LLMs\nalso exhibit some likelihood-reward miscalibration and struggle without\nexplicit rewards. Our results indicate LLMs can occasionally provide\nsignificant benefits, but specialized solvers are still competitive and incur\nless overhead."

This paper investigates the safety assessment of\nDCCL-WPT systems through three case studies: skin safety, eye safety, and\nsmall-object intrusion sensitivity. First, we establish a safety analysis model\nto quantify irradiation levels on intruding objects in the beam path, which\nsimulates intracavity beam propagation using diffraction modeling and gain-loss\ndynamics under case-specific boundary conditions. Next, we formulate an eye\nsafety evaluation tailored for DCCL-WPT systems using a human head model to\nidentify potential exposure angles and distances. Ray tracing confirms that\nintracavity beams are not focused onto the retina, making cornea exposure the\nprimary consideration (irradiance is below 0.1 W/cm2). Numerical results\ndemonstrate that DCCL-WPT achieves: i) over 600 mW charging power under\nskin-safe conditions at 5 m distance (100 mW over 16{\\deg} FoV), and nearly 50%\nlower irradiance on intruding objects compared to single-cavity systems; ii)\n150 mW charging power under eye-safe conditions with 650 mW 1064 nm output beam\npower, far beyond the typical ~10 mW eye-safe threshold; iii) high sensitivity\nto small-object intrusion, enabling hazard mitigation.

In addition, we demonstrate our framework can extend to\nlanguage pairs lacking paired ST training data or pre-trained ST models by\nsynthesizing ST models based on existing machine translation (MT) and ST models\nvia task analogies."

In this paper, we propose a\nMultiple Semantic-Guided Context Optimization (MSGCoOp) framework to enhance\nfew-shot generalization while maintaining computational efficiency.

To enrich these prompts, we introduce a semantic\nguidance mechanism that aligns them with comprehensive class descriptions\nautomatically generated by a Large Language Model (LLM). Furthermore, a\ndiversity regularization loss encourages the prompts to learn complementary and\northogonal features, preventing them from collapsing into redundant\nrepresentations. Extensive experiments on 11 benchmark datasets show that\nMSGCoOp significantly improves performance on base-to-novel generalization,\nachieving an average harmonic mean improvement of 1.10\\% over the strong KgCoOp\nbaseline.

Existing studies often focus on individual neurons, but their\npolysemantic nature makes it difficult to isolate language-specific units from\ncross-lingual representations. To address this, we explore sparse autoencoders\n(SAEs) for their ability to learn monosemantic features that represent concrete\nand abstract concepts across languages in LLMs. While some of these features\nare language-independent, the presence of language-specific features remains\nunderexplored. In this work, we introduce SAE-LAPE, a method based on feature\nactivation probability, to identify language-specific features within the\nfeed-forward network. We find that many such features predominantly appear in\nthe middle to final layers of the model and are interpretable. These features\ninfluence the model's multilingual performance and language output and can be\nused for language identification with performance comparable to fastText along\nwith more interpretability.

While recent efforts on efficient ViTs primarily focus on static\nmodel compression or token-level sparsification, they remain constrained by\nfixed computational depth for all tokens. In this work, we present MoR-ViT, a\nnovel vision transformer framework that, for the first time, incorporates a\ntoken-level dynamic recursion mechanism inspired by the Mixture-of-Recursions\n(MoR) paradigm. This approach enables each token to adaptively determine its\nprocessing depth, yielding a flexible and input-dependent allocation of\ncomputational resources. Extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K and transfer\nbenchmarks demonstrate that MoR-ViT not only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy\nwith up to 70% parameter reduction and 2.5x inference acceleration, but also\noutperforms leading efficient ViT baselines such as DynamicViT and TinyViT\nunder comparable conditions. These results establish dynamic recursion as an\neffective strategy for efficient vision transformers and open new avenues for\nscalable and deployable deep learning models in real-world scenarios.",

In this paper, we propose\niPanda, the first framework that leverages LLMs to automate protocol\nconformance testing. Given a protocol specification document and its\nimplementation, iPanda first employs a keyword-based method to automatically\ngenerate comprehensive test cases. Then, it utilizes retrieval-augmented\ngeneration and customized CoT strategy to effectively interpret the\nimplementation and produce executable test programs. To further enhance\nprograms' quality, iPanda incorporates an iterative optimization mechanism to\nrefine generated test scripts interactively. Finally, by executing and\nanalyzing the generated tests, iPanda systematically verifies compliance\nbetween implementations and protocol specifications. Comprehensive experiments\non various protocols show that iPanda significantly outperforms pure LLM-based\napproaches, improving the success rate (Pass@1) of test-program generation by\nfactors ranging from 4.675 times to 10.751 times.",

To achieve\nthis, the stochastic environment is carefully modeled as a graph, where the\nnodes represent sub-polygons of layout realizations, and the edges capture the\nvisibility overlaps between them.

In this paper, we introduce a layer-wise probing\nframework to systematically investigate the layer-wise capability of LLMs in\nsimulating personality for responding. We conduct probing experiments on 11\nopen-source LLMs over the PersonalityEdit benchmark and find that LLMs\npredominantly simulate personality for responding in their middle and upper\nlayers, with instruction-tuned models demonstrating a slightly clearer\nseparation of personality traits. Furthermore, by interpreting the trained\nprobing hyperplane as a layer-wise boundary for each personality category, we\npropose a layer-wise perturbation method to edit the personality expressed by\nLLMs during inference. Our results show that even when the prompt explicitly\nspecifies a particular personality, our method can still successfully alter the\nresponse personality of LLMs. Interestingly, the difficulty of converting\nbetween certain personality traits varies substantially, which aligns with the\nrepresentational distances in our probing experiments. Finally, we conduct a\ncomprehensive MMLU benchmark evaluation and time overhead analysis,\ndemonstrating that our proposed personality editing method incurs only minimal\ndegradation in general capabilities while maintaining low training costs and\nacceptable inference latency.

Large Language Models (LLMs), capable of retaining\ninformation long-term and analyzing both visual and textual data, are emerging\nas a potential key to deciphering the complexities of VR's evolving user\ninterfaces. In this paper, we conduct a case study to investigate the\ncapability of using LLMs, particularly GPT-4o, for field of view (FOV) analysis\nin VR exploration testing. Specifically, we validate that LLMs can identify\ntest entities in FOVs and that prompt engineering can effectively enhance the\naccuracy of test entity identification from 41.67% to 71.30%. Our study also\nshows that LLMs can accurately describe identified entities' features with at\nleast a 90% accuracy rate. We further find out that the core features that\neffectively represent an entity are color, placement, and shape. Furthermore,\nthe combination of the three features can especially be used to improve the\naccuracy of determining identical entities in multiple FOVs with the highest\nF1-score of 0.70. Additionally, our study demonstrates that LLMs are capable of\nscene recognition and spatial understanding in VR with precisely designed\nstructured prompts.

                    "value": "As the Virtual Reality (VR) industry expands, the need for automated GUI\ntesting is growing rapidly. Large Language Models (LLMs), capable of retaining\ninformation long-term and analyzing both visual and textual data, are emerging\nas a potential key to deciphering the complexities of VR's evolving user\ninterfaces. In this paper, we conduct a case study to investigate the\ncapability of using LLMs, particularly GPT-4o, for field of view (FOV) analysis\nin VR exploration testing. Specifically, we validate that LLMs can identify\ntest entities in FOVs and that prompt engineering can effectively enhance the\naccuracy of test entity identification from 41.67% to 71.30%. Our study also\nshows that LLMs can accurately describe identified entities' features with at\nleast a 90% accuracy rate. We further find out that the core features that\neffectively represent an entity are color, placement, and shape. Furthermore,\nthe combination of the three features can especially be used to improve the\naccuracy of determining identical entities in multiple FOVs with the highest\nF1-score of 0.70. Additionally, our study demonstrates that LLMs are capable of\nscene recognition and spatial understanding in VR with precisely designed\nstructured prompts. Finally, we find that LLMs fail to label the identified\ntest entities, and we discuss potential solutions as future research\ndirections."

To\nthis aim, social-coding platforms, such as GitHub, provide the infrastructure\nneeded to host and develop the code, but also the support for enabling the\ncommunity's collaboration, which is driven by non-coding contributions, such as\nissues (i.e., change proposals or bug reports) or comments to existing\ncontributions. As with any other social endeavor, this development process\nfaces ethical challenges, which may put at risk the project's sustainability.\nTo foster a productive and positive environment, OSS projects are increasingly\ndeploying codes of conduct, which define rules to ensure a respectful and\ninclusive participatory environment, with the Contributor Covenant being the\nmain model to follow. However, monitoring and enforcing these codes of conduct\nis a challenging task, due to the limitations of current approaches. In this\npaper, we propose an approach to classify the ethical quality of non-coding\ncontributions in OSS projects by relying on Large Language Models (LLM), a\npromising technology for text classification tasks.
