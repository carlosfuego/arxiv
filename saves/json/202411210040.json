In this work, we introduce Bi-Mamba, a\nscalable and powerful 1-bit Mamba architecture designed for more efficient\nlarge language models with multiple sizes across 780M, 1.3B, and 2.7B.

Extensive experimental results on language\nmodeling demonstrate that Bi-Mamba achieves performance comparable to its\nfull-precision counterparts (e.g., FP16 or BF16) and much better accuracy than\npost-training-binarization (PTB) Mamba baselines, while significantly reducing\nmemory footprint and energy consumption compared to the original Mamba model.\nOur study pioneers a new linear computational complexity LLM framework under\nlow-bit representation and facilitates the future design of specialized\nhardware tailored for efficient 1-bit Mamba-based LLMs.",

In this paper, we show new types of side channels\nthrough the file system that break this logical isolation. The file system\nplays a critical role in the operating system, managing all I/O activities\nbetween the application layer and the physical storage device. We observe that\nthe file system implementation is shared, leading to timing leakage when using\ncommon I/O system calls. Specifically, we found that modern operating systems\ntake advantage of any flush operation (which saves cached blocks in memory to\nthe SSD or disk) to flush all of the I/O buffers, even those used by other\nisolation domains. Thus, by measuring the delay of syncfs, the attacker can\ninfer the I/O behavior of victim programs. We then demonstrate a syncfs covert\nchannel attack on multiple file systems, including both Linux native file\nsystems and the Windows file system, achieving a maximum bandwidth of 5 Kbps\nwith an error rate of 0.15% on Linux and 7.6 Kbps with an error rate of 1.9% on\nWindows. In addition, we construct three side-channel attacks targeting both\nLinux and Android devices. On Linux devices, we implement a website\nfingerprinting attack and a video fingerprinting attack by tracking the write\npatterns of temporary buffering files. On Android devices, we design an\napplication fingerprinting attack that leaks application write patterns during\nboot-up. The attacks achieve over 90% F1 score, precision, and recall. Finally,\nwe demonstrate that these attacks can be exploited across containers\nimplementing a container detection technique and a cross-container covert\nchannel attack.",

The encouraging results, however, come with the\ncost of slow inference, since each denoising step requires inference on a\ntransformer model with a large scale of parameters. In this study, we make an\ninteresting and somehow surprising observation: the computation of a large\nproportion of layers in the diffusion transformer, through introducing a\ncaching mechanism, can be readily removed even without updating the model\nparameters. In the case of U-ViT-H/2, for example, we may remove up to 93.68%\nof the computation in the cache steps (46.84% for all steps), with less than\n0.01 drop in FID. To achieve this, we introduce a novel scheme, named\nLearning-to-Cache (L2C), that learns to conduct caching in a dynamic manner for\ndiffusion transformers. Specifically, by leveraging the identical structure of\nlayers in transformers and the sequential nature of diffusion, we explore\nredundant computations between timesteps by treating each layer as the\nfundamental unit for caching. To address the challenge of the exponential\nsearch space in deep models for identifying layers to cache and remove, we\npropose a novel differentiable optimization objective. An input-invariant yet\ntimestep-variant router is then optimized, which can finally produce a static\ncomputation graph. Experimental results show that L2C largely outperforms\nsamplers such as DDIM and DPM-Solver, alongside prior cache-based methods at\nthe same inference speed.

Our investigation follows a three-pronged approach involving (i)\nqueueing modeling and analysis, (ii) implementation and measurement, and (iii)\nsimulation to validate the accuracy of the queueing model. We also show that\nthe phenomenon of throughput decreasing at higher hit ratios is likely to be\nmore pronounced in future systems, where the trend is towards faster disks and\nhigher numbers of cores per CPU."

The\neffectiveness of a key-value cache relies on its ability of accommodating the\nneeded data. However, expanding the cache capacity is often more difficult than\ncommonly expected because of many practical constraints, such as server costs,\ncooling issues, rack space, and even human resource expenses. A potential\nsolution is compression, which virtually extends the cache capacity by\ncondensing data in cache. In practice, this seemingly simple idea has not\ngained much traction in key-value cache system design, due to several critical\nissues: the compression-unfriendly index structure, severe read/write\namplification, wasteful decompression operations, and heavy computing cost.\nThis paper presents a hybrid DRAM-SSD cache design to realize a systematic\nintegration of data compression in key-value cache. By treating compression as\nan essential component, we have redesigned the indexing structure, data\nmanagement, and leveraged the emerging computational SSD hardware for\ncollaborative optimizations. We have developed a prototype, called ZipCache.\nOur experimental results show that ZipCache can achieve up to 72.4% higher\nthroughput and 42.4% lower latency, while reducing the write amplification by\nup to 26.2 times.",

However, for many of\nthese applications, much of the context in the prompt is fixed across different\nuser inputs, thereby providing the opportunity to perform offline optimizations\nto process user inputs quickly, as they are received. In this work, we propose\nSqueezed Attention as a mechanism to accelerate LLM applications where a large\nportion of the input prompt is fixed. We first leverage K-means clustering\noffline to group the keys for the fixed context based on semantic similarity\nand represent each cluster with a single centroid value.

We then compute exact attention using only these important\nkeys from the fixed context, thereby reducing bandwidth and computational\ncosts. We also extend our method to use a hierarchical centroid lookup to\nidentify important keys, which can reduce the complexity of attention from\nlinear to logarithmic with respect to the context length. We implement\noptimized Triton kernels for centroid comparison and sparse FlashAttention with\nimportant keys, achieving more than 4x speedups during both the prefill and\ngeneration phases for long-context inference.

With its extended capacity, Pie\noutperforms vLLM by up to 1.9X in throughput and 2X in latency. Additionally,\nPie can reduce GPU memory usage by up to 1.67X while maintaining the same\nperformance.

It is designed to promote\nsystem scalability, enable peer-to-peer exchanges, and accelerate data\ntransmissions. To achieve these objectives, the most recent CXL protocol has\nbrought forth several innovative features, such as port-focused routing,\ndevice-handled coherence, and PCIe 6.0 compatibility. However, due to the\nlimited availability of hardware prototypes and simulators compatible with CXL,\nearlier CXL research has largely depended on emulating CXL devices using remote\nNUMA nodes. Unfortunately, these NUMA-based emulators have difficulties in\naccurately representing the new features due to fundamental differences in\nhardware and protocols. Moreover, the absence of support for non-tree topology\nand PCIe links makes it complex to merely adapt existing simulators for CXL\nsimulation. To overcome these problems, we introduce ESF, a simulation\nframework specifically designed for CXL systems. ESF has been developed to\naccurately reflect the unique features of the latest CXL protocol from the\nground up. It uses a specialized interconnect layer to facilitate connections\nwithin a wide range of system topologies and also includes key components to\ncarry out specific functions required by these features. By utilizing ESF, we\nthoroughly investigate various aspects of CXL systems, including system\ntopology, device-handled coherence, and the effects of PCIe characteristics,\nleading to important findings that can guide the creation of high-performance\nCXL systems.

                "summary": "The development of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized automated\ncode generation. However, their high demand of computation resources has\nhindered a broader deployment and raised environmental concerns. A common\nstrategy for diminishing computational demands is to cache Key-Value (KV)\nstates from the attention mechanism which is adopted predominately by\nmainstream LLMs. It can mitigate the need of repeated attention computations,\nbut brings significant memory overhead. Current practices in NLP often use\nsparse attention which may, unfortunately, lead to substantial inaccuracies, or\nhallucinations, in code generation tasks. In this paper, we analyze the\nattention weights distribution within code generation models via an empirical\nstudy, uncovering a sparsity pattern, i.e., the aggregation of information at\nspecific anchor points. Based on this observation, we propose a novel approach,\nAnchorCoder, which features token-wise anchor attention designed to extract and\ncompress the contextual information, and layer-wise anchor attention enabling\ncross-layer communication to mitigate the issue of excessive superposition\ncaused by the compression. The extensive experiments across multiple benchmark\ndatasets confirm the effectiveness of AnchorCoder, which can consistently\nachieve a significant (at least 70%) reduction in KV cache requirements, while\npreserving the majority of model's performance.",

                    "value": "The development of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized automated\ncode generation. However, their high demand of computation resources has\nhindered a broader deployment and raised environmental concerns. A common\nstrategy for diminishing computational demands is to cache Key-Value (KV)\nstates from the attention mechanism which is adopted predominately by\nmainstream LLMs. It can mitigate the need of repeated attention computations,\nbut brings significant memory overhead. Current practices in NLP often use\nsparse attention which may, unfortunately, lead to substantial inaccuracies, or\nhallucinations, in code generation tasks. In this paper, we analyze the\nattention weights distribution within code generation models via an empirical\nstudy, uncovering a sparsity pattern, i.e., the aggregation of information at\nspecific anchor points. Based on this observation, we propose a novel approach,\nAnchorCoder, which features token-wise anchor attention designed to extract and\ncompress the contextual information, and layer-wise anchor attention enabling\ncross-layer communication to mitigate the issue of excessive superposition\ncaused by the compression. The extensive experiments across multiple benchmark\ndatasets confirm the effectiveness of AnchorCoder, which can consistently\nachieve a significant (at least 70%) reduction in KV cache requirements, while\npreserving the majority of model's performance."

To address the limited resources\nof IIoT sensor devices, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted mobile edge\ncomputing (MEC) has emerged as a promising solution, providing flexible and\ncost-effective services in close proximity of IIoT sensor devices (ISDs).\nHowever, leveraging aerial MEC to meet the delay-sensitive and\ncomputation-intensive requirements of the ISDs could face several challenges,\nincluding the limited communication, computation and caching (3C) resources,\nstringent offloading requirements for 3C services, and constrained on-board\nenergy of UAVs. To address these issues, we first present a collaborative\naerial MEC-assisted ICPS architecture by incorporating the computing\ncapabilities of the macro base station (MBS) and UAVs. We then formulate a\nservice delay minimization optimization problem (SDMOP). Since the SDMOP is\nproved to be an NP-hard problem, we propose a joint computation offloading,\ncaching, communication resource allocation, computation resource allocation,\nand UAV trajectory control approach (JC5A). Specifically, JC5A consists of a\nblock successive upper bound minimization method of multipliers (BSUMM) for\ncomputation offloading and service caching, a convex optimization-based method\nfor communication and computation resource allocation, and a successive convex\napproximation (SCA)-based method for UAV trajectory control.

In this\npaper, we introduce a novel approach to optimize wireless edge content\nplacement using NTN.

In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to optimize\nwireless edge content placement using NTN, positioning NTN as a complement to\nTN for achieving optimal content broadcasting. Specifically, we dynamically\nselect content for placement via NTN links. This selection is based on\npopularity and suitability for delivery through NTN, while considering the\norbital motion of LEO satellites. Our system-level case studies, based on a\npractical LEO constellation, demonstrate the significant improvement in\nplacement speed compared to existing methods, which neglect network mobility.\nWe also demonstrate that NTN links significantly outperform standalone wireless\nTN solutions, particularly in the early stages of content delivery.

This communication\noften includes the full context of the query so far, which can introduce\nsignificant prefill-phase latency, especially with long contexts.\n  We introduce DroidSpeak, a novel framework to target this cross-LLM\ncommunication by leveraging the reuse of intermediate data, such as input\nembeddings (E-cache) and key-value caches (KV-cache). We efficiently bypass the\nneed to reprocess entire contexts for fine-tuned versions of the same\nfoundational model. This approach allows faster context integration while\nmaintaining the quality of task performance. Experimental evaluations\ndemonstrate DroidSpeak's ability to significantly accelerate inter-agent\ncommunication, achieving up to a 2.78x speedup in prefill latency with\nnegligible loss in accuracy. Our findings underscore the potential to create\nmore efficient and scalable multi-agent systems.",

                    "value": "In multi-agent systems utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs), communication\nbetween agents traditionally relies on natural language. This communication\noften includes the full context of the query so far, which can introduce\nsignificant prefill-phase latency, especially with long contexts.\n  We introduce DroidSpeak, a novel framework to target this cross-LLM\ncommunication by leveraging the reuse of intermediate data, such as input\nembeddings (E-cache) and key-value caches (KV-cache). We efficiently bypass the\nneed to reprocess entire contexts for fine-tuned versions of the same\nfoundational model. This approach allows faster context integration while\nmaintaining the quality of task performance. Experimental evaluations\ndemonstrate DroidSpeak's ability to significantly accelerate inter-agent\ncommunication, achieving up to a 2.78x speedup in prefill latency with\nnegligible loss in accuracy. Our findings underscore the potential to create\nmore efficient and scalable multi-agent systems."

While traditional content\nrecommendations are oblivious to network conditions, the paradigm of\nNetwork-Friendly Recommendations (NFR) has recently emerged, favoring content\nthat improves network performance (e.g. cached near the user), while still\nbeing appealing to the user. However, NFR algorithms sometimes achieve their\ngoal by shrinking the pool of content recommended to users.

This reduced diversity is problematic for both\nusers, who are prevented from exploring a broader range of content, and content\ncreators (e.g. YouTubers) whose content may be recommended less frequently,\nleading to perceived unfairness.

Modern LLM inference engines widely rely on\nrequest batching to improve inference throughput, aiming to make it\ncost-efficient when running on expensive GPU accelerators. However, the limited\nGPU memory has largely limited the batch size achieved in practice, leaving\nsignificant GPU compute resources wasted.\n  We present NEO, an online LLM inference system that offloads part of\nattention compute and KV cache states from the GPU to the local host CPU,\neffectively increasing the GPU batch size and thus inference throughput. To\nthis end, NEO proposes asymmetric GPU-CPU pipelining and load-aware scheduling\nto balance GPU and CPU loads and fully utilize their compute and memory\nresources. We evaluate NEO on a wide range of workloads (i.e., code generation,\ntext summarization), GPUs (i.e., T4, A10G, H100), and LLM models (i.e., 7B, 8B,\n70B). NEO achieves up to 7.5$\\times$, 26%, and 14% higher throughput compared\nto GPU-only approach on T4, A10G, and H100 GPUs, respectively, while\nmaintaining the same latency; with more powerful CPUs, NEO achieves up to 79.3%\nthroughput gain on A10G GPU.",

However, the limited\nGPU memory has largely limited the batch size achieved in practice, leaving\nsignificant GPU compute resources wasted.\n  We present NEO, an online LLM inference system that offloads part of\nattention compute and KV cache states from the GPU to the local host CPU,\neffectively increasing the GPU batch size and thus inference throughput. To\nthis end, NEO proposes asymmetric GPU-CPU pipelining and load-aware scheduling\nto balance GPU and CPU loads and fully utilize their compute and memory\nresources. We evaluate NEO on a wide range of workloads (i.e., code generation,\ntext summarization), GPUs (i.e., T4, A10G, H100), and LLM models (i.e., 7B, 8B,\n70B). NEO achieves up to 7.5$\\times$, 26%, and 14% higher throughput compared\nto GPU-only approach on T4, A10G, and H100 GPUs, respectively, while\nmaintaining the same latency; with more powerful CPUs, NEO achieves up to 79.3%\nthroughput gain on A10G GPU."

We further propose WaveRoRA, which leverages RoRA\nto capture inter-series dependencies in the wavelet domain. We conduct\nextensive experiments on eight real-world datasets.

These advancements promise to deeply benefit a vast\narray of application domains. However, due to their immense size, performing\ninference with LLMs is both costly and slow. Consequently, a plethora of recent\nwork has proposed strategies to enhance inference efficiency, e.g.,\nquantization, pruning, and caching. These acceleration strategies reduce the\ninference cost and latency, often by several factors, while maintaining much of\nthe predictive performance measured via common benchmarks. In this work, we\nexplore another critical aspect of LLM performance: demographic bias in model\ngenerations due to inference acceleration optimizations. Using a wide range of\nmetrics, we probe bias in model outputs from a number of angles. Analysis of\noutputs before and after inference acceleration shows significant change in\nbias. Worryingly, these bias effects are complex and unpredictable. A\ncombination of an acceleration strategy and bias type may show little bias\nchange in one model but may lead to a large effect in another.

                    "value": "Last few years have seen unprecedented advances in capabilities of Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs). These advancements promise to deeply benefit a vast\narray of application domains. However, due to their immense size, performing\ninference with LLMs is both costly and slow. Consequently, a plethora of recent\nwork has proposed strategies to enhance inference efficiency, e.g.,\nquantization, pruning, and caching. These acceleration strategies reduce the\ninference cost and latency, often by several factors, while maintaining much of\nthe predictive performance measured via common benchmarks. In this work, we\nexplore another critical aspect of LLM performance: demographic bias in model\ngenerations due to inference acceleration optimizations. Using a wide range of\nmetrics, we probe bias in model outputs from a number of angles. Analysis of\noutputs before and after inference acceleration shows significant change in\nbias. Worryingly, these bias effects are complex and unpredictable. A\ncombination of an acceleration strategy and bias type may show little bias\nchange in one model but may lead to a large effect in another. Our results\nhighlight a need for in-depth and case-by-case evaluation of model bias after\nit has been modified to accelerate inference."

In the weighted variant of this problem, each page has its own fetching\ncost; a substantial line of work on this problem culminated in an (optimal)\n$O(\\log k)$-competitive randomized algorithm, due to Bansal, Buchbinder and\nNaor (FOCS'07).\n  Existing work for weighted paging assumes that page weights are known in\nadvance, which is not always the case in practice.

Since it is\ncurrently not possible to infer stellar ages directly for individual RRL stars,\nour goal in this work is to search for these in association to intermediate-age\nclusters whose reliable ages can then be safely be attributed to the RRL. We\nused the Gaia DR3 Specific Object Study and OGLE IV public catalogues to search\nfor RRL stars around stellar clusters older than 1~Gyr in the Large and Small\nMagellanic Clouds. Modelling membership probabilities based on proper motion\nand photometric distance we obtained a list of 302 RRL stars associated with\nMagellanic clusters.

                    "value": "Recent works have challenged our canonical view of RR Lyrae (RRL) stars as\ntracers of exclusively old populations ($\\gtrsim10$~Gyr) by proposing a\nfraction of these stars to be of intermediate ages ($\\sim$2-5~Gyr). Since it is\ncurrently not possible to infer stellar ages directly for individual RRL stars,\nour goal in this work is to search for these in association to intermediate-age\nclusters whose reliable ages can then be safely be attributed to the RRL. We\nused the Gaia DR3 Specific Object Study and OGLE IV public catalogues to search\nfor RRL stars around stellar clusters older than 1~Gyr in the Large and Small\nMagellanic Clouds. Modelling membership probabilities based on proper motion\nand photometric distance we obtained a list of 302 RRL stars associated with\nMagellanic clusters. Of these, 23 RRL are likely members of 10 intermediate-age\nclusters: 3 and 7 in the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds, respectively.

We experiment on classic domains such as lists and strings, and\nan uncommon graphics programming domain not well represented in typical\npretraining data. We find that pretrained models are not effective at PBE, but\nthat they can be fine-tuned for much higher performance, provided the test\nproblems are in-distribution. We analyze empirically what causes these models\nto succeed and fail, and take steps toward understanding how to achieve better\nout-of-distribution generalization. Collectively these results suggest that\nLLMs make strong progress toward solving the typical suite of PBE tasks,\npotentially increasing the flexibility and applicability of PBE systems, while\nalso identifying ways in which LLMs still fall short."

This new method, which we\ncall Star Log-extended eMulation (SLM), utilizes the underlying logarithmic\nbehavior of the differential equations to enable accurate emulation of the\nnonlinear system. We show predictions for well-known phenomenological equations\nof state (EOS) with fixed parameters and with a freely-varying parametric\nQuarkyonic EOS. Our results produce a significant computational speed-up of\n$\\approx 3 \\times 10^4$ compared to high fidelity (HF) calculations using\nstandard Runge-Kutta methods, providing an efficient emulator for the numerous\nTOV evaluations required by multi-messenger astrophysical frameworks that infer\nconstraints on the EOS from neutron star mergers. The ability of the SLM\nalgorithm to learn a mapping between parameters of the EOS and subsequent\nneutron star properties also opens up potential extensions for assisting in\ncomputationally prohibitive uncertainty quantification (UQ) for any type of\nEOS.

This new method, which we\ncall Star Log-extended eMulation (SLM), utilizes the underlying logarithmic\nbehavior of the differential equations to enable accurate emulation of the\nnonlinear system. We show predictions for well-known phenomenological equations\nof state (EOS) with fixed parameters and with a freely-varying parametric\nQuarkyonic EOS. Our results produce a significant computational speed-up of\n$\\approx 3 \\times 10^4$ compared to high fidelity (HF) calculations using\nstandard Runge-Kutta methods, providing an efficient emulator for the numerous\nTOV evaluations required by multi-messenger astrophysical frameworks that infer\nconstraints on the EOS from neutron star mergers. The ability of the SLM\nalgorithm to learn a mapping between parameters of the EOS and subsequent\nneutron star properties also opens up potential extensions for assisting in\ncomputationally prohibitive uncertainty quantification (UQ) for any type of\nEOS. The source code for the methods developed in this work will be openly\navailable in a public GitHub repository for community modification and use."

In particular,\nwe focus on Operator Inference (OpInf) to build low-cost physics-based ROMs\nfrom data for such simulations. As a representative example, we consider the\n(classical) Hasegawa-Wakatani (HW) equations used for modeling two-dimensional\nelectrostatic drift-wave turbulence. For a comprehensive perspective of the\npotential of OpInf to construct predictive ROMs, we consider three setups for\nthe HW equations by varying a key parameter, namely the adiabaticity\ncoefficient. These setups lead to the formation of complex and nonlinear\ndynamics, which makes the construction of predictive ROMs of any kind\nchallenging. We generate the training datasets by performing direct numerical\nsimulations of the HW equations and recording the computed state data and\noutputs the over a time horizon of $100$ time units in the turbulent phase. We\nthen use these datasets to construct OpInf ROMs for predictions over $400$\nadditional time units, that is, $400\\%$ more than the training horizon. Our\nresults show that the OpInf ROMs capture important statistical features of the\nturbulent dynamics and generalize beyond the training time horizon while\nreducing the computational effort of the high-fidelity simulation by up to five\norders of magnitude. In the broader context of fusion research, this shows that\nnon-intrusive SciML ROMs have the potential to drastically accelerate numerical\nstudies, which can ultimately enable tasks such as the design of optimized\nfusion devices.",

We also compare with existing\nanalyses of real-world datasets, finding qualitatively different results where\nnormal distributions have been used and agreement where more robust methods\nhave been applied. A Python implementation of this model, t-cup, is made\navailable for others to use."

In this paper, considering these two\ncritical factors, we propose a SAM-guided Two-stream Lightweight Model for\nunsupervised anomaly detection (STLM) that not only aligns with the two\npractical application requirements but also harnesses the robust generalization\ncapabilities of SAM.

To be specific, one\nstream is trained to generate discriminative and general feature\nrepresentations in both normal and anomalous regions, while the other stream\nreconstructs the same images without anomalies, which effectively enhances the\ndifferentiation of two-stream representations when facing anomalous regions.\nFurthermore, we employ a shared mask decoder and a feature aggregation module\nto generate anomaly maps.

Even parity, the simplest state-tracking task, which non-linear RNNs like\nLSTM handle effectively, cannot be solved by current LRNNs. Recently, Sarrof et\nal.

We prove that finite precision LRNNs with\nstate-transition matrices having only positive eigenvalues cannot solve parity,\nwhile complex eigenvalues are needed to count modulo $3$. Notably, we also\nprove that LRNNs can learn any regular language when their state-transition\nmatrices are products of identity minus vector outer product matrices, each\nwith eigenvalues in the range $[-1, 1]$. Our empirical results confirm that\nextending the eigenvalue range of models like Mamba and DeltaNet to include\nnegative values not only enables them to solve parity but consistently improves\ntheir performance on state-tracking tasks. Furthermore, pre-training LRNNs with\nan extended eigenvalue range for language modeling achieves comparable\nperformance and stability while showing promise on code and math data.

However, limited\nattention has been paid to developing efficient LLM4SE techniques that demand\nminimal computational cost, time, and memory resources, as well as green LLM4SE\nsolutions that reduce energy consumption, water usage, and carbon emissions.\n  This paper aims to redirect the focus of the research community towards the\nefficiency and greenness of LLM4SE, while also sharing potential research\ndirections to achieve this goal. It commences with a brief overview of the\nsignificance of LLM4SE and highlights the need for efficient and green LLM4SE\nsolutions. Subsequently, the paper presents a vision for a future where\nefficient and green LLM4SE revolutionizes the LLM-based software engineering\ntool landscape, benefiting various stakeholders, including industry, individual\npractitioners, and society. The paper then delineates a roadmap for future\nresearch, outlining specific research paths and potential solutions for the\nresearch community to pursue. While not intended to be a definitive guide, the\npaper aims to inspire further progress, with the ultimate goal of establishing\nefficient and green LLM4SE as a central element in the future of software\nengineering.",

However, limited\nattention has been paid to developing efficient LLM4SE techniques that demand\nminimal computational cost, time, and memory resources, as well as green LLM4SE\nsolutions that reduce energy consumption, water usage, and carbon emissions.\n  This paper aims to redirect the focus of the research community towards the\nefficiency and greenness of LLM4SE, while also sharing potential research\ndirections to achieve this goal. It commences with a brief overview of the\nsignificance of LLM4SE and highlights the need for efficient and green LLM4SE\nsolutions. Subsequently, the paper presents a vision for a future where\nefficient and green LLM4SE revolutionizes the LLM-based software engineering\ntool landscape, benefiting various stakeholders, including industry, individual\npractitioners, and society. The paper then delineates a roadmap for future\nresearch, outlining specific research paths and potential solutions for the\nresearch community to pursue. While not intended to be a definitive guide, the\npaper aims to inspire further progress, with the ultimate goal of establishing\nefficient and green LLM4SE as a central element in the future of software\nengineering."

However, controllable\nsummarization with LLMs remains underexplored, limiting their ability to\ngenerate summaries that align with specific user preferences. In this paper, we\nfirst investigate the capability of LLMs to control diverse attributes,\nrevealing that they encounter greater challenges with numerical attributes,\nsuch as length and extractiveness, compared to linguistic attributes. To\naddress this challenge, we propose a guide-to-explain framework (GTE) for\ncontrollable summarization. Our GTE framework enables the model to identify\nmisaligned attributes in the initial draft and guides it in explaining errors\nin the previous output. Based on this reflection, the model generates a\nwell-adjusted summary. As a result, by allowing the model to reflect on its\nmisalignment, we generate summaries that satisfy the desired attributes in\nsurprisingly fewer iterations than other iterative methods solely using LLMs.",

                    "value": "Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable\nperformance in abstractive summarization tasks. However, controllable\nsummarization with LLMs remains underexplored, limiting their ability to\ngenerate summaries that align with specific user preferences. In this paper, we\nfirst investigate the capability of LLMs to control diverse attributes,\nrevealing that they encounter greater challenges with numerical attributes,\nsuch as length and extractiveness, compared to linguistic attributes. To\naddress this challenge, we propose a guide-to-explain framework (GTE) for\ncontrollable summarization. Our GTE framework enables the model to identify\nmisaligned attributes in the initial draft and guides it in explaining errors\nin the previous output. Based on this reflection, the model generates a\nwell-adjusted summary. As a result, by allowing the model to reflect on its\nmisalignment, we generate summaries that satisfy the desired attributes in\nsurprisingly fewer iterations than other iterative methods solely using LLMs."

For instance, the new\nversion of the Gregor Infrared Spectrograph instrument offers the possibility\nto observe the spectral lines at 8542 and 10830 A simultaneously for the first\ntime. The first spectral window contains the Ca II 8542 A spectral line, while\nthe Si I 10827 A transition and He I 10830 A triplet infrared lines can be\nfound in the second spectral window. As the sensitivity to the atmospheric\nparameters and the height of formation of those transitions is different,\ncombining them can help understand the properties of the solar photosphere and\nchromosphere and how they are magnetically coupled. Traditionally, the analysis\nof the Si I 10827 A transition assumes local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE),\nwhich is not the best approximation to model this transition. Hence, in this\nwork, we examine the potential of performing non-LTE (NLTE) inversions of the\nfull Stokes vector of the Si I 10827 A spectral line. The results indicate that\nwe properly infer the atmospheric parameters through an extended range of\natmospheric layers in comparison with the LTE case (only valid for the spectral\nline wings, i.e., the low photosphere), with no impact on the robustness of the\nsolution and just a minor increase in computational time.

Thanks to\nrecent observational efforts, we now have precise interferometric and\nspectroscopic constraints, as well as revised astrometric parallaxes from the\nGaia mission. Aims. We aim at determining the age of HD140283 with these\nlastest constraints, as well as quantifying the impact of systematics from\nphysical inaccuracies in the stellar evolution models. Methods. Using recent\nspectroscopic abundances from the literature, including 3D non-LTE values for\nC, O, and Fe, we compute opacity tables specific to HD140283. We then use them\nin grids of stellar evolution models coupled to a Markov Chain Monte Carlo tool\nto determine the age of HD140283. Results. With our tailored models we find an\nage of 12.3Gy. Using a solar-scaled mixture instead results in an age value of\n14Gy, in tension with the age of the universe ($13.77\\pm0.06$Gy). We also find\nthat reducing the mixing length parameter from its solar calibrated value will\nlead to an even lower age, in agreement with other recent studies. However, we\nfind no direct evidence to favour a lower mixing length parameter value from\nour modelling. Conclusions. Taking into account the specific elemental\nabundances is crucial for the modelling of HD140283, as it leads to significant\ndifferences in the inferred age.

We propose methods to distill these two\ncapabilities and evaluate their impact on reasoning outcomes and inference\ncost. We find that we can distill the problem decomposition phase and at the\nsame time achieve good generalization across tasks, datasets, and models.\nHowever, it is harder to distill the problem solving capability without losing\nperformance and the resulting distilled model struggles with generalization.\nThese results indicate that by using smaller, distilled problem decomposition\nmodels in combination with problem solving LLMs we can achieve reasoning with\ncost-efficient inference and local adaptation.",

In this paper we devise a similar strategy that breaks down\nreasoning tasks into a problem decomposition phase and a problem solving phase\nand show that the strategy is able to outperform a single stage solution.\nFurther, we hypothesize that the decomposition should be easier to distill into\na smaller model compared to the problem solving because the latter requires\nlarge amounts of domain knowledge while the former only requires learning\ngeneral problem solving strategies. We propose methods to distill these two\ncapabilities and evaluate their impact on reasoning outcomes and inference\ncost. We find that we can distill the problem decomposition phase and at the\nsame time achieve good generalization across tasks, datasets, and models.\nHowever, it is harder to distill the problem solving capability without losing\nperformance and the resulting distilled model struggles with generalization.\nThese results indicate that by using smaller, distilled problem decomposition\nmodels in combination with problem solving LLMs we can achieve reasoning with\ncost-efficient inference and local adaptation."

We then provide a derivation of ACE and use it to control\nrefusal behavior on ten different models, including Llama 3 70B. ACE combines\naffine subspace projection and activation addition to reliably control the\nmodel's refusal responses across prompt types. We evaluate the results using\nLLM-based scoring on a collection of harmful and harmless prompts. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that ACE consistently achieves more precise control\nover model behavior than existing methods and generalizes to models where\ndirectional ablation via affine subspace projection alone produces incoherent\noutputs.

                    "value": "We propose affine concept editing (ACE) as an approach for steering language\nmodels' behavior by intervening directly in activations. We begin with an\naffine decomposition of model activation vectors and show that prior methods\nfor steering model behavior correspond to subsets of terms of this\ndecomposition. We then provide a derivation of ACE and use it to control\nrefusal behavior on ten different models, including Llama 3 70B. ACE combines\naffine subspace projection and activation addition to reliably control the\nmodel's refusal responses across prompt types. We evaluate the results using\nLLM-based scoring on a collection of harmful and harmless prompts. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that ACE consistently achieves more precise control\nover model behavior than existing methods and generalizes to models where\ndirectional ablation via affine subspace projection alone produces incoherent\noutputs. Code for reproducing our results is available at\nhttps://github.com/EleutherAI/steering-llama3 ."

Recently, text-promptable segmentation\nmethods have been introduced to generate masks based on text prompts describing\ntarget objects. However, these methods assume that the object described by a\ngiven text prompt exists in the scene. This results in mask generation whenever\na related text prompt is provided, even if the object is absent from the image.\nExisting methods handle this by using prompts only for objects known to be\npresent in the image, which introduces inaccessible information in a\nvision-based method setting and results in unfair comparisons. For fair\ncomparison, we redefine existing text-promptable SIS settings to robust\nconditions, called Robust text-promptable SIS (R-SIS), designed to forward\nprompts of all classes and determine the existence of an object from a given\ntext prompt for the fair comparison. Furthermore, we propose a novel framework,\nRobust Surgical Instrument Segmentation (RoSIS), which combines visual and\nlanguage features for promptable segmentation in the R-SIS setting. RoSIS\nemploys an encoder-decoder architecture with a Multi-Modal Fusion Block (MMFB)\nand a Selective Gate Block (SGB) to achieve balanced integration of vision and\nlanguage features. Additionally, we introduce an iterative inference strategy\nthat refines segmentation masks in two steps: an initial pass using name-based\nprompts, followed by a refinement step using location prompts. Experiments on\nvarious datasets and settings demonstrate that RoSIS outperforms existing\nvision-based and promptable methods under robust conditions.",

A\nmajority of prior works have tackled this challenge by developing agents that\nphysically explore their environment to update their beliefs about the world\nstate. In contrast, humans can $\\textit{imagine}$ unseen parts of the world\nthrough a mental exploration and $\\textit{revise}$ their beliefs with imagined\nobservations. Such updated beliefs can allow them to make more informed\ndecisions, without necessitating the physical exploration of the world at all\ntimes. To achieve this human-like ability, we introduce the $\\textit{Generative\nWorld Explorer (Genex)}$, an egocentric world exploration framework that allows\nan agent to mentally explore a large-scale 3D world (e.g., urban scenes) and\nacquire imagined observations to update its belief. This updated belief will\nthen help the agent to make a more informed decision at the current step. To\ntrain $\\textit{Genex}$, we create a synthetic urban scene dataset, Genex-DB.\nOur experimental results demonstrate that (1) $\\textit{Genex}$ can generate\nhigh-quality and consistent observations during long-horizon exploration of a\nlarge virtual physical world and (2) the beliefs updated with the generated\nobservations can inform an existing decision-making model (e.g., an LLM agent)\nto make better plans.",

A\nmajority of prior works have tackled this challenge by developing agents that\nphysically explore their environment to update their beliefs about the world\nstate. In contrast, humans can $\\textit{imagine}$ unseen parts of the world\nthrough a mental exploration and $\\textit{revise}$ their beliefs with imagined\nobservations. Such updated beliefs can allow them to make more informed\ndecisions, without necessitating the physical exploration of the world at all\ntimes. To achieve this human-like ability, we introduce the $\\textit{Generative\nWorld Explorer (Genex)}$, an egocentric world exploration framework that allows\nan agent to mentally explore a large-scale 3D world (e.g., urban scenes) and\nacquire imagined observations to update its belief. This updated belief will\nthen help the agent to make a more informed decision at the current step. To\ntrain $\\textit{Genex}$, we create a synthetic urban scene dataset, Genex-DB.\nOur experimental results demonstrate that (1) $\\textit{Genex}$ can generate\nhigh-quality and consistent observations during long-horizon exploration of a\nlarge virtual physical world and (2) the beliefs updated with the generated\nobservations can inform an existing decision-making model (e.g., an LLM agent)\nto make better plans."

Our MDAgents addresses this\nneed by dynamically assigning collaboration structures to LLMs based on task\ncomplexity, mimicking real-world clinical collaboration and decision-making.\nThis framework improves diagnostic accuracy and supports adaptive responses in\ncomplex, real-world medical scenarios, making it a valuable tool for clinicians\nin various healthcare settings, and at the same time, being more efficient in\nterms of computing cost than static multi-agent decision making methods."

We developed an annotated corpus covering 4 clinical\nentities and 16 modifiers, and compared instruction-tuned LLaMA-2 and LLaMA-3\nagainst BiomedBERT in terms of performance, generalizability, computational\nresources, and throughput to BiomedBERT. Results: LLaMA models outperformed\nBiomedBERT across datasets. With sufficient training data, LLaMA showed modest\nimprovements (1% on NER, 1.5-3.7% on RE); improvements were larger with limited\ntraining data. On unseen i2b2 data, LLaMA-3-70B outperformed BiomedBERT by 7%\n(F1) on NER and 4% on RE. However, LLaMA models required more computing\nresources and ran up to 28 times slower.

As complexity increases with larger\nproblem sizes and more intricate dependencies, identifying the optimal solution\nbecome challenging.

Since its inauguration in Herrsching (Germany, 2007), the ISSS has\nbeen held in New York (USA, 2010), Glasgow (UK, 2013), Kyoto (Japan, 2017) and\nAachen (Germany, 2019). During the five-day symposium, participants from 14\ncountries gathered to discuss recent advances in space sailing, investigating\nnew concepts and designs, describing innovative hardware and enabling\ntechnologies, strategies for dynamics and control, and providing updates on\ntesting results for systems under development and future mission applications.\nAs part of the 18 sessions, almost 50 oral presentations were held and,\nsubsequently, 17 papers were submitted for review and publication. This paper\naims to give an overview of all the cutting-edge technologies, detailed\nanalysis and promising results shared with the scientific community as part of\nthe event. Following the noteworthy deployment of the world's first solar sail\nIKAROS in 2010, missions like NanoSail-D2 (2011) and LightSail-2 (2019) have\nshowcased the potential of solar sailing technology through successful\ndemonstrations. Besides highlighting advancements in present and future\nprograms, the symposium was an opportunity to reflect on objectives, design and\ntest results from research centers and universities, as well as illustrate\napplications for interstellar travel, evaluate degrading performance and\nsuggest alternative solutions for known limitations.

The results demonstrate that MPDetector can\neffectively detect inconsistency issues with the precision of 92.8%. We further\nreported 14 detected inconsistency issues to the library developers, who have\nconfirmed 11 issues at the time of writing."

This phenomenon, referred to as\nlogarithmic layer mismatch (LLM), occurs in both wall shear stress models and\nhybrid RANS/LES models. Many efforts have been made to explain and resolve this\nmismatch, including decreasing the high correlation between the wall shear\nstress and the velocity at the matching layer, modifying the subgrid-scale\n(SGS) eddy viscosity, and adding a stochastic forcing. It is widely believed\nthat the inclusion of the resolved Reynolds shear stress (or the convection\nterm) is essential to elliminate the LLM, as it prevents the overseimation of\nthe modeled Reynolds shear stress and promotes the generation of the\nsmall-scale flow structures in the near-wall region. In this work, by comparing\nthree different SGS eddy viscosity models, we demonstrate that ensuring the\ntotal shear stress conservation (TSSC) conservation is key to resolving the\nLLM. Under the TSSC framework, the effect of the convection term on LLM can be\nquantitatively assessed. Furthermore, a modified SGS eddy viscosity modfication\nmodel that adheres to the TSSC constraint is tested at different Reynolds\nnumbers ($Re_\\tau=1000, 2000, 4200$). Our results demonstrate the robust\nperformance of the present model in predicting skin friction and low-order\nturbulence statistics, even under a relatively low grid resolution ($\\Delta\nx^+, \\Delta z^+ \\lesssim 500$, $2\\leq \\Delta_x/\\Delta_{y,mat} \\leq 4$, where\n$\\Delta_{y,mat}$ is the wall-normal grid spacing in the wall-model region).",

Through practical\ncase studies, we illustrate the utility of the framework. This work offers\ndevelopers actionable insights for selecting suitable technologies in LLM-based\nsoftware system development, promoting robustness and scalability."

Unlike most\nthought-eliciting prompting methods, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), which aim\nto elicit the reasoning process in the output, Re2 shifts the focus to the\ninput by processing questions twice, thereby enhancing the understanding\nprocess. Consequently, Re2 demonstrates strong generality and compatibility\nwith most thought-eliciting prompting methods, including CoT. Crucially, Re2\nfacilitates a \"bidirectional\" encoding in unidirectional decoder-only LLMs\nbecause the first pass could provide global information for the second pass. We\nbegin with a preliminary empirical study as the foundation of Re2, illustrating\nits potential to enable \"bidirectional\" attention mechanisms. We then evaluate\nRe2 on extensive reasoning benchmarks across 14 datasets, spanning 112\nexperiments, to validate its effectiveness and generality. Our findings\nindicate that, with the exception of a few scenarios on vanilla ChatGPT, Re2\nconsistently enhances the reasoning performance of LLMs through a simple\nre-reading strategy.

The rapid-evolution of large\nlanguage models (LLMs) presents a new opportunity for material property\npredictions, complementing experimental measurements and multi-scale\ncomputational methods. We focus on predicting the elastic constant tensor, as a\ncase study, and develop domain-specific LLMs for predicting elastic constants\nand for materials discovery. The proposed ElaTBot LLM enables simultaneous\nprediction of elastic constant tensors, bulk modulus at finite temperatures,\nand the generation of new materials with targeted properties. Moreover, the\ncapabilities of ElaTBot are further enhanced by integrating with general LLMs\n(GPT-4o) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for prediction. A specialized\nvariant, ElaTBot-DFT, designed for 0 K elastic constant tensor prediction,\nreduces the prediction errors by 33.1% compared with domain-specific, material\nscience LLMs (Darwin) trained on the same dataset.

The rapid-evolution of large\nlanguage models (LLMs) presents a new opportunity for material property\npredictions, complementing experimental measurements and multi-scale\ncomputational methods. We focus on predicting the elastic constant tensor, as a\ncase study, and develop domain-specific LLMs for predicting elastic constants\nand for materials discovery. The proposed ElaTBot LLM enables simultaneous\nprediction of elastic constant tensors, bulk modulus at finite temperatures,\nand the generation of new materials with targeted properties. Moreover, the\ncapabilities of ElaTBot are further enhanced by integrating with general LLMs\n(GPT-4o) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for prediction. A specialized\nvariant, ElaTBot-DFT, designed for 0 K elastic constant tensor prediction,\nreduces the prediction errors by 33.1% compared with domain-specific, material\nscience LLMs (Darwin) trained on the same dataset. This natural language-based\napproach lowers the barriers to computational materials science and highlights\nthe broader potential of LLMs for material property predictions and inverse\ndesign."

MLLMs not only are able to\nunderstand and generate language across linguistic boundaries, but also\nrepresent an important advancement in artificial intelligence. We first discuss\nthe architecture and pre-training objectives of MLLMs, highlighting the key\ncomponents and methodologies that contribute to their multilingual\ncapabilities. We then discuss the construction of multilingual pre-training and\nalignment datasets, underscoring the importance of data quality and diversity\nin enhancing MLLM performance. An important focus of this survey is on the\nevaluation of MLLMs. We present a detailed taxonomy and roadmap covering the\nassessment of MLLMs' cross-lingual knowledge, reasoning, alignment with human\nvalues, safety, interpretability and specialized applications. Specifically, we\nextensively discuss multilingual evaluation benchmarks and datasets, and\nexplore the use of LLMs themselves as multilingual evaluators. To enhance MLLMs\nfrom black to white boxes, we also address the interpretability of multilingual\ncapabilities, cross-lingual transfer and language bias within these models.\nFinally, we provide a comprehensive review of real-world applications of MLLMs\nacross diverse domains, including biology, medicine, computer science,\nmathematics and law. We showcase how these models have driven innovation and\nimprovements in these specialized fields while also highlighting the challenges\nand opportunities in deploying MLLMs within diverse language communities and\napplication scenarios.

We further\nconduct thorough experiments to examine how different factors affect LLMs and\npropose a simple method to dynamically utilize supporting documents with our\njudgement strategy.

Therefore, how to\neffectively measure group polarization has become a critical topic. Measuring\ngroup polarization on social media presents several challenges that have not\nyet been addressed by existing solutions. First, social media group\npolarization measurement involves processing vast amounts of text, which poses\na significant challenge for information extraction. Second, social media texts\noften contain hard-to-understand content, including sarcasm, memes, and\ninternet slang. Additionally, group polarization research focuses on holistic\nanalysis, while texts is typically fragmented. To address these challenges, we\ndesigned a solution based on a multi-agent system and used a graph-structured\nCommunity Sentiment Network (CSN) to represent polarization states.\nFurthermore, we developed a metric called Community Opposition Index (COI)\nbased on the CSN to quantify polarization. Finally, we tested our multi-agent\nsystem through a zero-shot stance detection task and achieved outstanding\nresults. In summary, the proposed approach has significant value in terms of\nusability, accuracy, and interpretability.",

First, social media group\npolarization measurement involves processing vast amounts of text, which poses\na significant challenge for information extraction. Second, social media texts\noften contain hard-to-understand content, including sarcasm, memes, and\ninternet slang. Additionally, group polarization research focuses on holistic\nanalysis, while texts is typically fragmented. To address these challenges, we\ndesigned a solution based on a multi-agent system and used a graph-structured\nCommunity Sentiment Network (CSN) to represent polarization states.\nFurthermore, we developed a metric called Community Opposition Index (COI)\nbased on the CSN to quantify polarization. Finally, we tested our multi-agent\nsystem through a zero-shot stance detection task and achieved outstanding\nresults. In summary, the proposed approach has significant value in terms of\nusability, accuracy, and interpretability."

                "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance on language\ntasks but face challenges when deployed on resource-constrained devices due to\ntheir extensive parameters and reliance on dense multiplications, resulting in\nhigh memory demands and latency bottlenecks. Shift-and-add reparameterization\noffers a promising solution by replacing costly multiplications with\nhardware-friendly primitives in both the attention and multi-layer perceptron\n(MLP) layers of an LLM. However, current reparameterization techniques require\ntraining from scratch or full parameter fine-tuning to restore accuracy, which\nis resource-intensive for LLMs. To address this, we propose accelerating\npretrained LLMs through post-training shift-and-add reparameterization,\ncreating efficient multiplication-free models, dubbed ShiftAddLLM.\nSpecifically, we quantize each weight matrix into binary matrices paired with\ngroup-wise scaling factors. The associated multiplications are reparameterized\ninto (1) shifts between activations and scaling factors and (2) queries and\nadds according to the binary matrices.

Shift-and-add reparameterization\noffers a promising solution by replacing costly multiplications with\nhardware-friendly primitives in both the attention and multi-layer perceptron\n(MLP) layers of an LLM. However, current reparameterization techniques require\ntraining from scratch or full parameter fine-tuning to restore accuracy, which\nis resource-intensive for LLMs. To address this, we propose accelerating\npretrained LLMs through post-training shift-and-add reparameterization,\ncreating efficient multiplication-free models, dubbed ShiftAddLLM.\nSpecifically, we quantize each weight matrix into binary matrices paired with\ngroup-wise scaling factors. The associated multiplications are reparameterized\ninto (1) shifts between activations and scaling factors and (2) queries and\nadds according to the binary matrices. To reduce accuracy loss, we present a\nmulti-objective optimization method to minimize both weight and output\nactivation reparameterization errors.

To\naddress this challenge, we propose the first Medical Video Generation (MVG)\nframework that enables controlled manipulation of disease-related image and\nvideo features, allowing precise, realistic, and personalized simulations of\ndisease progression. Our approach begins by leveraging large language models\n(LLMs) to recaption prompt for disease trajectory. Next, a controllable\nmulti-round diffusion model simulates the disease progression state for each\npatient, creating realistic intermediate disease state sequence. Finally, a\ndiffusion-based video transition generation model interpolates disease\nprogression between these states. We validate our framework across three\nmedical imaging domains: chest X-ray, fundus photography, and skin image. Our\nresults demonstrate that MVG significantly outperforms baseline models in\ngenerating coherent and clinically plausible disease trajectories. Two user\nstudies by veteran physicians, provide further validation and insights into the\nclinical utility of the generated sequences. MVG has the potential to assist\nhealthcare providers in modeling disease trajectories, interpolating missing\nmedical image data, and enhancing medical education through realistic, dynamic\nvisualizations of disease progression.",

Distributed\nAgents in a Worldwide Network (DAWN) addresses this need by offering a\nversatile framework that integrates LLM-based agents with traditional software\nsystems, enabling the creation of agentic applications suited for a wide range\nof use cases. DAWN enables distributed agents worldwide to register and be\neasily discovered through Gateway Agents. Collaborations among these agents are\ncoordinated by a Principal Agent equipped with reasoning strategies. DAWN\noffers three operational modes: No-LLM Mode for deterministic tasks, Copilot\nfor augmented decision-making, and LLM Agent for autonomous operations.\nAdditionally, DAWN ensures the safety and security of agent collaborations\nglobally through a dedicated safety, security, and compliance layer, protecting\nthe network against attackers and adhering to stringent security and compliance\nstandards.

These advancements have led to the development\nof specialized LLM-based agents designed for diverse tasks such as coding and\nweb browsing. As these agents become more capable, the need for a robust\nframework that facilitates global communication and collaboration among them\ntowards advanced objectives has become increasingly critical. Distributed\nAgents in a Worldwide Network (DAWN) addresses this need by offering a\nversatile framework that integrates LLM-based agents with traditional software\nsystems, enabling the creation of agentic applications suited for a wide range\nof use cases. DAWN enables distributed agents worldwide to register and be\neasily discovered through Gateway Agents. Collaborations among these agents are\ncoordinated by a Principal Agent equipped with reasoning strategies. DAWN\noffers three operational modes: No-LLM Mode for deterministic tasks, Copilot\nfor augmented decision-making, and LLM Agent for autonomous operations.\nAdditionally, DAWN ensures the safety and security of agent collaborations\nglobally through a dedicated safety, security, and compliance layer, protecting\nthe network against attackers and adhering to stringent security and compliance\nstandards. These features make DAWN a robust network for deploying agent-based\napplications across various industries."

Yet the substantial memory footprint of LLMs\nsignificantly hinders their deployment. In this paper, we improve the\naccessibility of LLMs through BitMoD, an algorithm-hardware co-design solution\nthat enables efficient LLM acceleration at low weight precision. On the\nalgorithm side, BitMoD introduces fine-grained data type adaptation that uses a\ndifferent numerical data type to quantize a group of (e.g., 128) weights.\nThrough the careful design of these new data types, BitMoD is able to quantize\nLLM weights to very low precision (e.g., 4 bits and 3 bits) while maintaining\nhigh accuracy. On the hardware side, BitMoD employs a bit-serial processing\nelement to easily support multiple numerical precisions and data types; our\nhardware design includes two key innovations: First, it employs a unified\nrepresentation to process different weight data types, thus reducing the\nhardware cost. Second, it adopts a bit-serial dequantization unit to rescale\nthe per-group partial sum with minimal hardware overhead. Our evaluation on six\nrepresentative LLMs demonstrates that BitMoD significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art LLM quantization and acceleration methods. For discriminative\ntasks, BitMoD can quantize LLM weights to 4-bit with $<\\!0.5\\%$ accuracy loss\non average. For generative tasks, BitMoD is able to quantize LLM weights to\n3-bit while achieving better perplexity than prior LLM quantization scheme.\nCombining the superior model performance with an efficient accelerator design,\nBitMoD achieves an average of $1.69\\times$ and $1.48\\times$ speedups compared\nto prior LLM accelerators ANT and OliVe, respectively.",

To address\nthis challenge, we propose a skill library framework based on knowledge graphs,\nwhich endows robots with high-level skill awareness and spatial semantic\nunderstanding. The framework hierarchically organizes operational knowledge by\nconstructing a \"task graph\" and a \"scene graph\" to represent task and scene\nsemantic information, respectively. We introduce a \"state graph\" to facilitate\ninteraction between high-level task planning and low-level scene information.\nFurthermore, we propose a hierarchical transfer framework for operational\nskills. At the task level, the framework integrates contextual learning and\nchain-of-thought prompting within a four-stage prompt paradigm, leveraging\nlarge language models' (LLMs) reasoning and generalization capabilities to\nachieve task-level subtask sequence transfer. At the motion level, an adaptive\ntrajectory transfer method is developed using the A* algorithm and the skill\nlibrary, enabling motion-level adaptive trajectory transfer. At the physical\nlevel, we introduce an adaptive contour extraction and posture perception\nmethod based on tactile perception. This method dynamically obtains\nhigh-precision contour and posture information from visual-tactile texture data\nand adjusts transferred skills, such as contact positions and postures, to\nensure effectiveness in new environments. Experimental results validate the\neffectiveness of the proposed methods. Project\nwebsite:https://github.com/MingchaoQi/skill_transfer",

At the motion level, an adaptive\ntrajectory transfer method is developed using the A* algorithm and the skill\nlibrary, enabling motion-level adaptive trajectory transfer. At the physical\nlevel, we introduce an adaptive contour extraction and posture perception\nmethod based on tactile perception. This method dynamically obtains\nhigh-precision contour and posture information from visual-tactile texture data\nand adjusts transferred skills, such as contact positions and postures, to\nensure effectiveness in new environments. Experimental results validate the\neffectiveness of the proposed methods. Project\nwebsite:https://github.com/MingchaoQi/skill_transfer"

The implementation\nof ML in real-time at colliders requires very low latencies that are\nunachievable with a software-based approach, requiring optimization and\nsynthesis of ML algorithms for deployment on hardware.
