Although\nlearnable approaches like Q-Former and Perceiver Resampler have been developed\nto reduce the vision token burden, they overlook the context causally modeled\nby LLMs (i.e., key-value cache), potentially leading to missed visual cues when\naddressing user queries. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to reduce\nvision compute by leveraging redundant vision tokens \"skipping layers\" rather\nthan decreasing the number of vision tokens. Our method, VideoLLM-MoD, is\ninspired by mixture-of-depths LLMs and addresses the challenge of numerous\nvision tokens in long-term or streaming video. Specifically, for each\ntransformer layer, we learn to skip the computation for a high proportion\n(e.g., 80\\%) of vision tokens, passing them directly to the next layer. This\napproach significantly enhances model efficiency, achieving approximately\n\\textasciitilde42\\% time and \\textasciitilde30\\% memory savings for the entire\ntraining. Moreover, our method reduces the computation in the context and avoid\ndecreasing the vision tokens, thus preserving or even improving performance\ncompared to the vanilla model.

However, long-context LLM inference is challenging since the\ninference speed decreases significantly as the sequence length grows. This\nslowdown is primarily caused by loading a large KV cache during self-attention.\nPrevious works have shown that a small portion of critical tokens will dominate\nthe attention outcomes. However, we observe the criticality of a token highly\ndepends on the query. To this end, we propose Quest, a query-aware KV cache\nselection algorithm. Quest keeps track of the minimal and maximal Key values in\nKV cache pages and estimates the criticality of a given page using Query\nvectors. By only loading the Top-K critical KV cache pages for attention, Quest\nsignificantly speeds up self-attention without sacrificing accuracy. We show\nthat Quest can achieve up to 2.23x self-attention speedup, which reduces\ninference latency by 7.03x while performing well on tasks with long\ndependencies with negligible accuracy loss.

RPCool addresses this by falling back to RDMA-based\ncommunication.\n  Overall, RPCool reduces the round-trip latency by 1.93$\\times$ and\n7.2$\\times$ compared to state-of-the-art RDMA and CXL-based RPC mechanisms,\nrespectively. Moreover, RPCool performs either comparably or better than other\nRPC mechanisms across a range of workloads."

Besides, We find that many writes are duplicate, and the duplication\ncan be inter-dup and intra-dup. While inter-dup means different memory blocks\nare identical, and intra-dup means all the 4B elements in a line are the same.\nIn this work, we propose a cache-assisted GPU memory deduplication architecture\nnamed CMD to reduce the off-chip accesses via utilizing the data duplication in\nGPU applications. CMD includes three key design contributions which aim to\nreduce the three kinds of accesses: (1) A novel GPU memory deduplication\narchitecture that removes the inter-dup and inter-dup lines. As for the\ninter-dup detection, we reduce the extra read requests caused by the\ntraditional read-verify hash process. Besides, we design several techniques to\nmanage duplicate blocks. (2) We propose a cache-assisted read scheme to reduce\nthe reads to duplicate data. When an L2 cache miss wants to read the duplicate\nblock, if the reference block has been fetched to L2 and it is clean, we can\ncopy it to the L2 missed block without accessing off-chip DRAM. As for the\nreads to intra-dup data, CMD uses the on-chip metadata cache to get the data.\n(3) When a cache line is evicted, the clean sectors in the line are invalidated\nwhile the dirty sectors are written back. However, most read-only victims are\nre-referenced from DRAM more than twice. Therefore, we add a full-associate\nFIFO to accommodate the read-only (it is also clean) victims to reduce the\nre-reference counts. Experiments show that CMD can decrease the off-chip\naccesses by 31.01%, reduce the energy by 32.78% and improve performance by\n37.79%.

One remedy to this problem is the\npromising paradigm of edge computing. Through collaboration with our industry\npartner, we identify key prohibitive limitations of the current edge mindset:\n(1) servers are not distributed enough and thus, are not close enough to\nvehicles, (2) current proposed edge solutions do not provide substantially\nbetter performance and extra information specific to autonomous vehicles to\nwarrant their cost to the user, and (3) the state-of-the-art solutions are not\ncompatible with popular frameworks used in autonomous systems, particularly the\nRobot Operating System (ROS).\n  To remedy these issues, we provide Genie, an encapsulation technique that can\nenable transparent caching in ROS in a non-intrusive way (i.e., without\nmodifying the source code), can build the cache in a distributed manner (in\ncontrast to traditional central caching methods), and can construct a\ncollective three-dimensional object map to provide substantially better latency\n(even on low-power edge servers) and higher quality data to all vehicles in a\ncertain locality. We fully implement our design on state-of-the-art\nindustry-adopted embedded and edge platforms, using the prominent autonomous\ndriving software Autoware, and find that Genie can enhance the latency of\nAutoware Vision Detector by 82% on average, enable object reusability 31% of\nthe time on average and as much as 67% for the incoming requests, and boost the\nconfidence in its object map considerably over time.",

Despite several works proposing to evict unnecessary\ntokens from the KV Cache, most of them rely on the biased local statistics of\naccumulated attention scores and report performance using unconvincing metric\nlike perplexity on inadequate short-text evaluation. In this paper, we propose\nNACL, a general framework for long-context KV cache eviction that achieves more\noptimal and efficient eviction in a single operation during the encoding phase.\nDue to NACL's efficiency, we combine more accurate attention score statistics\nin PROXY TOKENS EVICTION with the diversified random eviction strategy of\nRANDOM EVICTION, aiming to alleviate the issue of attention bias and enhance\nthe robustness in maintaining pivotal tokens for long-context modeling tasks.\nNotably, our method significantly improves the performance on short- and\nlong-text tasks by 80% and 76% respectively, reducing KV Cache by up to 50%\nwith over 95% performance maintenance.

Despite several works proposing to evict unnecessary\ntokens from the KV Cache, most of them rely on the biased local statistics of\naccumulated attention scores and report performance using unconvincing metric\nlike perplexity on inadequate short-text evaluation. In this paper, we propose\nNACL, a general framework for long-context KV cache eviction that achieves more\noptimal and efficient eviction in a single operation during the encoding phase.\nDue to NACL's efficiency, we combine more accurate attention score statistics\nin PROXY TOKENS EVICTION with the diversified random eviction strategy of\nRANDOM EVICTION, aiming to alleviate the issue of attention bias and enhance\nthe robustness in maintaining pivotal tokens for long-context modeling tasks.\nNotably, our method significantly improves the performance on short- and\nlong-text tasks by 80% and 76% respectively, reducing KV Cache by up to 50%\nwith over 95% performance maintenance. The code is available at\nhttps://github.com/PaddlePaddle/Research/tree/master/NLP/ACL2024-NACL."

However, these\nstudies only focus on one or several characteristics of NVM, while failing to\nexploit its best practice by putting NVM in the proper position of the whole\nstorage stack. In this paper, we present NVPC, a transparent acceleration to\nexisting kernel file systems with an NVM-enhanced page cache. The acceleration\nlies in two aspects, respectively matching the desperate needs of existing disk\nfile systems: sync writes and cache-missed operations. Besides, the fast DRAM\npage cache is preserved for cache-hit operations. For sync writes, a\nhigh-performance log-based sync absorbing area is provided to redirect data\ndestination from the slow disk to the fast NVM. Meanwhile, the byte-addressable\nfeature of NVM is used to prevent write amplification. For cache-missed\noperations, NVPC makes use of the idle space on NVM to extend the DRAM page\ncache, so that more and larger workloads can fit into the cache. NVPC is\nentirely implemented as a page cache, thus can provide efficient speed-up to\ndisk file systems with full transparency to users and full compatibility to\nlower file systems.\n  In Filebench macro-benchmarks, NVPC achieves at most 3.55x, 2.84x, and 2.64x\nfaster than NOVA, Ext-4, and SPFS. In RocksDB workloads with working set larger\nthan DRAM, NVPC achieves 1.12x, 2.59x, and 2.11x faster than NOVA, Ext-4, and\nSPFS. Meanwhile, NVPC gains positive revenue from NOVA, Ext-4, and SPFS in\n62.5% of the tested cases in our read/write/sync mixed evaluation,\ndemonstrating that NVPC is more balanced and adaptive to complex real-world\nworkloads.

Here, the e-beam-induced transformation of precursor\nmicroparticles employing a low-energy e-beam with an acceleration voltage of 30\nkV in a scanning electron microscope is developed to increase the versatility\nand efficiency of the technique. Under these conditions, the technique can be\nclassified between e-beam lithography, where the e-beam is used to mill holes\nin or grow some different material onto a substrate, and e-beam welding, where\nmatter can be welded together when overcoming the melting phase. Modifying gold\nmicroparticles on an amorphous SiOx substrate reveals the dominant role of\ninelastic electron-matter interaction and subsequent localized heating for the\nobserved melting and vaporization of the precursor microparticles under the\nelectron beam. Monte-Carlo scattering simulations and thermodynamic modeling\nfurther support the findings.",

Here, the e-beam-induced transformation of precursor\nmicroparticles employing a low-energy e-beam with an acceleration voltage of 30\nkV in a scanning electron microscope is developed to increase the versatility\nand efficiency of the technique. Under these conditions, the technique can be\nclassified between e-beam lithography, where the e-beam is used to mill holes\nin or grow some different material onto a substrate, and e-beam welding, where\nmatter can be welded together when overcoming the melting phase. Modifying gold\nmicroparticles on an amorphous SiOx substrate reveals the dominant role of\ninelastic electron-matter interaction and subsequent localized heating for the\nobserved melting and vaporization of the precursor microparticles under the\nelectron beam. Monte-Carlo scattering simulations and thermodynamic modeling\nfurther support the findings."

Extensive testing across a wide range of\nworkloads reveals up to a 9X speedup in write-heavy workloads and up to 45%\nenergy savings due to reduced read and write I/O. Furthermore, we achieve\nsignificant reductions in median and tail read latencies of up to 89% and 85%\nrespectively."

Mainstream LLMs\ncan be grouped into two categories based on masking strategy: causal LLM and\nprefix LLM. Several works have demonstrated that prefix LLMs tend to outperform\ncausal ones in scenarios that heavily depend on historical context such as\nmulti-turn dialogues or in-context learning, thanks to their bidirectional\nattention on prefix sequences. However, prefix LLMs have an inherent\ninefficient training problem in multi-turn dialogue datasets. In addition, the\nattention mechanism of prefix LLM makes it unable to reuse Key-Value Cache (KV\nCache) across dialogue rounds to reduce generation latency. In this paper, we\npropose a novel masking scheme called Intermittent Semi-working Mask (ISM) to\naddress these problems. Specifically, we apply alternate bidirectional and\nunidirectional attention on queries and answers in the dialogue history. In\nthis way, ISM is able to maintain the high quality of prefix LLM and low\ngeneration latency of causal LLM, simultaneously. Extensive experiments\nillustrate that our ISM achieves significant performance.",

                    "value": "Multi-turn dialogues are a key interaction method between humans and Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs), as conversations extend over multiple rounds, keeping\nLLMs' high generation quality and low latency is a challenge. Mainstream LLMs\ncan be grouped into two categories based on masking strategy: causal LLM and\nprefix LLM. Several works have demonstrated that prefix LLMs tend to outperform\ncausal ones in scenarios that heavily depend on historical context such as\nmulti-turn dialogues or in-context learning, thanks to their bidirectional\nattention on prefix sequences. However, prefix LLMs have an inherent\ninefficient training problem in multi-turn dialogue datasets. In addition, the\nattention mechanism of prefix LLM makes it unable to reuse Key-Value Cache (KV\nCache) across dialogue rounds to reduce generation latency. In this paper, we\npropose a novel masking scheme called Intermittent Semi-working Mask (ISM) to\naddress these problems. Specifically, we apply alternate bidirectional and\nunidirectional attention on queries and answers in the dialogue history. In\nthis way, ISM is able to maintain the high quality of prefix LLM and low\ngeneration latency of causal LLM, simultaneously. Extensive experiments\nillustrate that our ISM achieves significant performance."

We also outline the potential of extending our method\nto value cache pruning, demonstrating ThinK's versatility and broad\napplicability in reducing both memory and computational overheads."

The second is\nknowledge-guided cache refinement, which refines pair values (i.e.,\npseudo-labels) and cache weights by leveraging knowledge distillation from\nlarge-scale vision language models.

Our analysis\nreveals that, apart from the fact that different applications may require\ndifferent retention times, the clock frequency, which is typically ignored in\nmost STT-RAM studies, may also significantly impact applications' retention\ntime needs.

KV\nstores frequently consist of heterogeneous clusters, characterized by varying\nhardware specifications of the deployment nodes, with each node potentially\nrunning a distinct version of the KV store software. This heterogeneity is\naccompanied by the diverse metadata that they need to manage. In this study, we\nintroduce MetaHive, a cache-optimized approach to managing metadata in\nheterogeneous KV store clusters. MetaHive disaggregates the original data from\nits associated metadata to promote independence between them, while maintaining\ntheir interconnection during usage. This makes the metadata opaque from the\ndownstream processes and the other KV stores in the cluster. MetaHive also\nensures that the KV and metadata entries are stored in the vicinity of each\nother in memory and storage. This allows MetaHive to optimally utilize the\ncaching mechanism without extra storage read overhead for metadata retrieval.\nWe deploy MetaHive to ensure data integrity in RocksDB and demonstrate its\nrapid data validation with minimal effect on performance.",

                    "value": "Cloud key-value (KV) stores provide businesses with a cost-effective and\nadaptive alternative to traditional on-premise data management solutions. KV\nstores frequently consist of heterogeneous clusters, characterized by varying\nhardware specifications of the deployment nodes, with each node potentially\nrunning a distinct version of the KV store software. This heterogeneity is\naccompanied by the diverse metadata that they need to manage. In this study, we\nintroduce MetaHive, a cache-optimized approach to managing metadata in\nheterogeneous KV store clusters. MetaHive disaggregates the original data from\nits associated metadata to promote independence between them, while maintaining\ntheir interconnection during usage. This makes the metadata opaque from the\ndownstream processes and the other KV stores in the cluster. MetaHive also\nensures that the KV and metadata entries are stored in the vicinity of each\nother in memory and storage. This allows MetaHive to optimally utilize the\ncaching mechanism without extra storage read overhead for metadata retrieval.\nWe deploy MetaHive to ensure data integrity in RocksDB and demonstrate its\nrapid data validation with minimal effect on performance."

Unfortunately,\nthese approaches have not been widely adopted due to the complexity of\ninitializing the material space and learning the deformation model for each\ncharacter separately, which often requires a skilled artist followed by lengthy\nnetwork training. In this work, we aim to make physics-based facial animation\nmore accessible by proposing a generalized physical face model that we learn\nfrom a large 3D face dataset. Once trained, our model can be quickly fit to any\nunseen identity and produce a ready-to-animate physical face model\nautomatically. Fitting is as easy as providing a single 3D face scan, or even a\nsingle face image. After fitting, we offer intuitive animation controls, as\nwell as the ability to retarget animations across characters.

                "summary": "Traffic forecasting is crucial for intelligent transportation systems. It has\nexperienced significant advancements thanks to the power of deep learning in\ncapturing latent patterns of traffic data. However, recent deep-learning\narchitectures require intricate model designs and lack an intuitive\nunderstanding of the mapping from input data to predicted results. Achieving\nboth accuracy and explainability in traffic prediction models remains a\nchallenge due to the complexity of traffic data and the inherent opacity of\ndeep learning models. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Traffic flow\nPrediction model based on Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate explainable\ntraffic predictions, named xTP-LLM. By transferring multi-modal traffic data\ninto natural language descriptions, xTP-LLM captures complex time-series\npatterns and external factors from comprehensive traffic data. The LLM\nframework is fine-tuned using language-based instructions to align with\nspatial-temporal traffic flow data. Empirically, xTP-LLM shows competitive\naccuracy compared with deep learning baselines, while providing an intuitive\nand reliable explanation for predictions.

                    "value": "Traffic forecasting is crucial for intelligent transportation systems. It has\nexperienced significant advancements thanks to the power of deep learning in\ncapturing latent patterns of traffic data. However, recent deep-learning\narchitectures require intricate model designs and lack an intuitive\nunderstanding of the mapping from input data to predicted results. Achieving\nboth accuracy and explainability in traffic prediction models remains a\nchallenge due to the complexity of traffic data and the inherent opacity of\ndeep learning models. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Traffic flow\nPrediction model based on Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate explainable\ntraffic predictions, named xTP-LLM. By transferring multi-modal traffic data\ninto natural language descriptions, xTP-LLM captures complex time-series\npatterns and external factors from comprehensive traffic data. The LLM\nframework is fine-tuned using language-based instructions to align with\nspatial-temporal traffic flow data. Empirically, xTP-LLM shows competitive\naccuracy compared with deep learning baselines, while providing an intuitive\nand reliable explanation for predictions. This paper contributes to advancing\nexplainable traffic prediction models and lays a foundation for future\nexploration of LLM applications in transportation. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first study to use LLM for explainable prediction of\ntraffic flows."

We show that objectives for aligning LLMs with\nhuman feedback implicitly incorporate many of these biases -- the success of\nthese objectives (e.g., DPO) over cross-entropy minimization can partly be\nascribed to them belonging to a family of loss functions that we call\n$\\textit{human-aware losses}$ (HALOs). However, the utility functions these\nmethods attribute to humans still differ from those in the prospect theory\nliterature. Using a Kahneman-Tversky model of human utility, we propose a HALO\nthat directly maximizes the utility of generations instead of maximizing the\nlog-likelihood of preferences, as current methods do.

                    "value": "Kahneman & Tversky's $\\textit{prospect theory}$ tells us that humans perceive\nrandom variables in a biased but well-defined manner (1992); for example,\nhumans are famously loss-averse. We show that objectives for aligning LLMs with\nhuman feedback implicitly incorporate many of these biases -- the success of\nthese objectives (e.g., DPO) over cross-entropy minimization can partly be\nascribed to them belonging to a family of loss functions that we call\n$\\textit{human-aware losses}$ (HALOs). However, the utility functions these\nmethods attribute to humans still differ from those in the prospect theory\nliterature. Using a Kahneman-Tversky model of human utility, we propose a HALO\nthat directly maximizes the utility of generations instead of maximizing the\nlog-likelihood of preferences, as current methods do. We call this approach\nKTO, and it matches or exceeds the performance of preference-based methods at\nscales from 1B to 30B, despite only learning from a binary signal of whether an\noutput is desirable.

Our method gathers data from sources like Wikipedia,\nexpands it with logical reasoning to create diverse test cases, assesses LLMs\nthrough structured prompts, and validates their coherence using semantic-aware\nassessment mechanisms. Our method generates test cases and detects\nhallucinations across six different LLMs spanning nine domains, revealing\nhallucination rates ranging from 24.7% to 59.8%.

Additionally, we developed evaluation metrics to gauge an LLM's\nself-learning capability. Our experiments revealed that LLMs with at least 3B\nparameters that have undergone some instruction training would be able to\nperform self-learning well.

Yet, the reason why these components are important to LLM reasoning is\nnot explored. To fill this gap, in this work, we investigate ``neuron\nactivation'' as a lens to provide a unified explanation to observations made by\nprior work. Specifically, we look into neurons within the feed-forward layers\nof LLMs that may have activated their arithmetic reasoning capabilities, using\nLlama2 as an example. To facilitate this investigation, we also propose an\napproach based on GPT-4 to automatically identify neurons that imply arithmetic\nreasoning. Our analyses revealed that the activation of reasoning neurons in\nthe feed-forward layers of an LLM can explain the importance of various\ncomponents in a CoT prompt, and future research can extend it for a more\ncomplete understanding.",

These concepts, termed as the\n\"implicit concepts\", could be unintentionally learned during training and then\nbe generated uncontrollably during inference. Existing removal methods still\nstruggle to eliminate implicit concepts primarily due to their dependency on\nthe model's ability to recognize concepts it actually can not discern. To\naddress this, we utilize the intrinsic geometric characteristics of implicit\nconcepts and present the Geom-Erasing, a novel concept removal method based on\nthe geometric-driven control.

Existing removal methods still\nstruggle to eliminate implicit concepts primarily due to their dependency on\nthe model's ability to recognize concepts it actually can not discern. To\naddress this, we utilize the intrinsic geometric characteristics of implicit\nconcepts and present the Geom-Erasing, a novel concept removal method based on\nthe geometric-driven control.

Vendors often times provide\nunstructured product descriptions consisting only of an offer title and a\ntextual description. Consequently, extracting attribute values from titles and\ndescriptions is vital for e-commerce platforms. State-of-the-art attribute\nvalue extraction methods based on pre-trained language models, such as BERT,\nface two drawbacks (i) the methods require significant amounts of task-specific\ntraining data and (ii) the fine-tuned models have problems with generalising to\nunseen attribute values that were not part of the training data. This paper\nexplores the potential of using large language models as a more training\ndata-efficient and more robust alternative to existing AVE methods. We propose\nprompt templates for describing the target attributes of the extraction to the\nLLM, covering both zero-shot and few-shot scenarios. In the zero-shot scenario,\ntextual and JSON-based target schema representations of the attributes are\ncompared. In the few-shot scenario, we investigate (i) the provision of example\nattribute values, (ii) the selection of in-context demonstrations, (iii)\nshuffled ensembling to prevent position bias, and (iv) fine-tuning the LLM. We\nevaluate the prompt templates in combination with hosted LLMs, such as GPT-3.5\nand GPT-4, and open-source LLMs which can be run locally. We compare the\nperformance of the LLMs to the PLM-based methods SU-OpenTag, AVEQA, and MAVEQA.\nThe highest average F1-score of 86% was achieved by GPT-4.

These\ninferred rewards serve dual purposes: they act as value targets for further\nrefining the process reward model and also facilitate the selection of\nhigh-quality traces for policy model self-training. We first show that the\ntree-search policy in ReST-MCTS* achieves higher accuracy compared with prior\nLLM reasoning baselines such as Best-of-N and Tree-of-Thought, within the same\nsearch budget.

Our analysis spans\nseveral measurable linguistic dimensions, including morphological, syntactic,\npsychometric, and sociolinguistic aspects. The results reveal various\nmeasurable differences between human and AI-generated texts. Human texts\nexhibit more scattered sentence length distributions, more variety of\nvocabulary, a distinct use of dependency and constituent types, shorter\nconstituents, and more optimized dependency distances. Humans tend to exhibit\nstronger negative emotions (such as fear and disgust) and less joy compared to\ntext generated by LLMs, with the toxicity of these models increasing as their\nsize grows.

The results reveal various\nmeasurable differences between human and AI-generated texts. Human texts\nexhibit more scattered sentence length distributions, more variety of\nvocabulary, a distinct use of dependency and constituent types, shorter\nconstituents, and more optimized dependency distances. Humans tend to exhibit\nstronger negative emotions (such as fear and disgust) and less joy compared to\ntext generated by LLMs, with the toxicity of these models increasing as their\nsize grows.

The\nframework consists of three phases: research idea generation, experiment\nimplementation, and implementation execution.

However, their\ncorrelation with majority-voted human ratings varied across different quality\naspects, indicating that they are not a complete replacement.

However, the effect was\nlimited to cases where human raters were scarce, and an additional human rater\nhad a more pronounced effect in all cases.

Additionally, with this LFEPP, we derive a further approximate one for\n3D Ising model, from which we infer the critical temperature $z_c\\approx\n0.21\\sim 0.22$. Furthermore, we suggest similar LFEPPs for 1D-3D Ising models\nwith an external magnetic field, although they are too complicated."

By leveraging the similarity\nbetween the learning rate in generalized posterior inference and the inverse\ntemperature in SMC sampling, the proposed algorithm efficiently calibrates the\nposterior distribution with a reduced computational cost.

Such a design forces the retriever to search over a large corpus to\nfind the `needle' unit. In contrast, the readers only need to generate answers\nfrom the short retrieved units. The imbalanced `heavy' retriever and `light'\nreader design can lead to sub-optimal performance. The loss of contextual\ninformation in the short, chunked units may increase the likelihood of\nintroducing hard negatives during the retrieval stage. Additionally, the reader\nmight not fully leverage the capabilities of recent advancements in LLMs. In\norder to alleviate the imbalance, we propose a new framework LongRAG,\nconsisting of a `long retriever' and a `long reader'. In the two\nWikipedia-based datasets, NQ and HotpotQA, LongRAG processes the entire\nWikipedia corpus into 4K-token units by grouping related documents. By\nincreasing the unit size, we significantly reduce the total number of units.\nThis greatly reduces the burden on the retriever, resulting in strong retrieval\nperformance with only a few (less than 8) top units. Without requiring any\ntraining, LongRAG achieves an EM of 62.7% on NQ and 64.3% on HotpotQA, which\nare on par with the (fully-trained) SoTA model. Furthermore, we test on two\nnon-Wikipedia-based datasets, Qasper and MultiFieldQA-en. LongRAG processes\neach individual document as a single (long) unit rather than chunking them into\nsmaller units. By doing so, we achieve an F1 score of 25.9% on Qasper and 57.5%\non MultiFieldQA-en. Our study offers insights into the future roadmap for\ncombining RAG with long-context LLMs.",

Based on our evaluation results, we draw several\nimportant findings, including: 1) no single model excels in all aspects, with\ndifferent models showing various strengths; 2) the correlation between GPT-4\nassessments and manual reviews is generally high; 3) there is a trade-off\nbetween the usability and safety of text-to-video generative models. This\nindicates that as the field of video generation rapidly advances, safety risks\nare set to surge, highlighting the urgency of prioritizing video safety. We\nhope that T2VSafetyBench can provide insights for better understanding the\nsafety of video generation in the era of generative AI."

Though existing SNN accelerators offer high efficiency in processing\nsparse spikes with dense weights, opportunities are less explored in SNNs with\nsparse weights, i.e., dual-sparsity. In this work, we study the acceleration of\ndual-sparse SNNs, focusing on their core operation, sparse-matrix-sparse-matrix\nmultiplication (spMspM). We observe that naively running a dual-sparse SNN on\nexisting spMspM accelerators designed for dual-sparse Artificial Neural\nNetworks (ANNs) exhibits sub-optimal efficiency. The main challenge is that\nprocessing timesteps, a natural property of SNNs, introduces an extra loop to\nANN spMspM, leading to longer latency and more memory traffic. To address the\nproblem, we propose a fully temporal-parallel (FTP) dataflow, which minimizes\nboth data movement across timesteps and the end-to-end latency of dual-sparse\nSNNs. To maximize the efficiency of FTP dataflow, we propose an FTP-friendly\nspike compression mechanism that efficiently compresses single-bit spikes and\nensures contiguous memory access. We further propose an FTP-friendly inner-join\ncircuit that can lower the cost of the expensive prefix-sum circuits with\nalmost no throughput penalty. All the above techniques for FTP dataflow are\nencapsulated in LoAS, a Low-latency inference Accelerator for dual-sparse SNNs.\nWith FTP dataflow, compression, and inner-join, running dual-sparse SNN\nworkloads on LoAS demonstrates significant speedup (up to $8.51\\times$) and\nenergy reduction (up to $3.68\\times$) compared to running it on prior\ndual-sparse accelerators.",

They\ncollaborate to configure each procedure with task and data-specific settings\nstep by step towards versatile solutions, and the proposed method is dubbed\nGL-Agent. By evaluating on diverse tasks and graphs, the correct results of the\nagent and its comparable performance showcase the versatility of the proposed\nmethod, especially in complex scenarios.The low resource cost and the potential\nto use open-source LLMs highlight the efficiency of GL-Agent."

We develop a\nreal-time digital twin of azimuthal thermoacoustics of a hydrogen-based annular\ncombustor. The digital twin seamlessly combines two sources of information\nabout the system (i) a physics-based low-order model; and (ii) raw and sparse\nexperimental data from microphones, which contain both aleatoric noise and\nturbulent fluctuations. First, we derive a low-order thermoacoustic model for\nazimuthal instabilities, which is deterministic. Second, we propose a real-time\ndata assimilation framework to infer the acoustic pressure, the physical\nparameters, and the model and measurement biases simultaneously. This is the\nbias-regularized ensemble Kalman filter (r-EnKF), for which we find an\nanalytical solution that solves the optimization problem. Third, we propose a\nreservoir computer, which infers both the model bias and measurement bias to\nclose the assimilation equations. Fourth, we propose a real-time digital twin\nof the azimuthal thermoacoustic dynamics of a laboratory hydrogen-based annular\ncombustor for a variety of equivalence ratios. We find that the real-time\ndigital twin (i) autonomously predicts azimuthal dynamics, in contrast to\nbias-unregularized methods; (ii) uncovers the physical acoustic pressure from\nthe raw data, i.e., it acts as a physics-based filter; (iii) is a time-varying\nparameter system, which generalizes existing models that have constant\nparameters, and capture only slow-varying variables. The digital twin\ngeneralizes to all equivalence ratios, which bridges the gap of existing\nmodels. This work opens new opportunities for real-time digital twinning of\nmulti-physics problems.",

Quantization is one of the most effective ways to make them more\ncompute and memory efficient. Quantization-aware training (QAT) methods,\ngenerally produce the best quantized performance, however it comes at the cost\nof potentially long training time and excessive memory usage, making it\nimpractical when applying for LLMs. Inspired by parameter-efficient fine-tuning\n(PEFT) and low-rank adaptation (LoRA) literature, we propose LR-QAT -- a\nlightweight and memory-efficient QAT algorithm for LLMs. LR-QAT employs several\ncomponents to save memory without sacrificing predictive performance: (a)\nlow-rank auxiliary weights that are aware of the quantization grid; (b) a\ndowncasting operator using fixed-point or double-packed integers and (c)\ncheckpointing. Unlike most related work, our method (i) is inference-efficient,\nleading to no additional overhead compared to traditional PTQ; (ii) can be seen\nas a general extended pretraining framework, meaning that the resulting model\ncan still be utilized for any downstream task afterwards; (iii) can be applied\nacross a wide range of quantization settings, such as different choices\nquantization granularity, activation quantization, and seamlessly combined with\nmany PTQ techniques. We apply LR-QAT to LLaMA-1/2/3 and Mistral model families\nand validate its effectiveness on several downstream tasks. Our method\noutperforms common post-training quantization (PTQ) approaches and reaches the\nsame model performance as full-model QAT at the fraction of its memory usage.\nSpecifically, we can train a 7B LLM on a single consumer grade GPU with 24GB of\nmemory.

Quantization-aware training (QAT) methods,\ngenerally produce the best quantized performance, however it comes at the cost\nof potentially long training time and excessive memory usage, making it\nimpractical when applying for LLMs. Inspired by parameter-efficient fine-tuning\n(PEFT) and low-rank adaptation (LoRA) literature, we propose LR-QAT -- a\nlightweight and memory-efficient QAT algorithm for LLMs. LR-QAT employs several\ncomponents to save memory without sacrificing predictive performance: (a)\nlow-rank auxiliary weights that are aware of the quantization grid; (b) a\ndowncasting operator using fixed-point or double-packed integers and (c)\ncheckpointing. Unlike most related work, our method (i) is inference-efficient,\nleading to no additional overhead compared to traditional PTQ; (ii) can be seen\nas a general extended pretraining framework, meaning that the resulting model\ncan still be utilized for any downstream task afterwards; (iii) can be applied\nacross a wide range of quantization settings, such as different choices\nquantization granularity, activation quantization, and seamlessly combined with\nmany PTQ techniques. We apply LR-QAT to LLaMA-1/2/3 and Mistral model families\nand validate its effectiveness on several downstream tasks. Our method\noutperforms common post-training quantization (PTQ) approaches and reaches the\nsame model performance as full-model QAT at the fraction of its memory usage.\nSpecifically, we can train a 7B LLM on a single consumer grade GPU with 24GB of\nmemory.

                "summary": "Context detection involves labeling segments of an online stream of data as\nbelonging to different tasks. Task labels are used in lifelong learning\nalgorithms to perform consolidation or other procedures that prevent\ncatastrophic forgetting. Inferring task labels from online experiences remains\na challenging problem. Most approaches assume finite and low-dimension\nobservation spaces or a preliminary training phase during which task labels are\nlearned. Moreover, changes in the transition or reward functions can be\ndetected only in combination with a policy, and therefore are more difficult to\ndetect than changes in the input distribution. This paper presents an approach\nto learning both policies and labels in an online deep reinforcement learning\nsetting. The key idea is to use distance metrics, obtained via optimal\ntransport methods, i.e., Wasserstein distance, on suitable latent action-reward\nspaces to measure distances between sets of data points from past and current\nstreams.

                    "value": "Context detection involves labeling segments of an online stream of data as\nbelonging to different tasks. Task labels are used in lifelong learning\nalgorithms to perform consolidation or other procedures that prevent\ncatastrophic forgetting. Inferring task labels from online experiences remains\na challenging problem. Most approaches assume finite and low-dimension\nobservation spaces or a preliminary training phase during which task labels are\nlearned. Moreover, changes in the transition or reward functions can be\ndetected only in combination with a policy, and therefore are more difficult to\ndetect than changes in the input distribution. This paper presents an approach\nto learning both policies and labels in an online deep reinforcement learning\nsetting. The key idea is to use distance metrics, obtained via optimal\ntransport methods, i.e., Wasserstein distance, on suitable latent action-reward\nspaces to measure distances between sets of data points from past and current\nstreams. Such distances can then be used for statistical tests based on an\nadapted Kolmogorov-Smirnov calculation to assign labels to sequences of\nexperiences. A rollback procedure is introduced to learn multiple policies by\nensuring that only the appropriate data is used to train the corresponding\npolicy. The combination of task detection and policy deployment allows for the\noptimization of lifelong reinforcement learning agents without an oracle that\nprovides task labels. The approach is tested using two benchmarks and the\nresults show promising performance when compared with related context detection\nalgorithms.

High-quality and timely correction of misinformation\nthat identifies and explains its (in)accuracies effectively reduces false\nbeliefs. Despite the wide acceptance of manual correction, it is difficult to\nbe timely and scalable. While LLMs have versatile capabilities that could\naccelerate misinformation correction, they struggle due to a lack of recent\ninformation, a tendency to produce false content, and limitations in addressing\nmultimodal information. We propose MUSE, an LLM augmented with access to and\ncredibility evaluation of up-to-date information. By retrieving evidence as\nrefutations or supporting context, MUSE identifies and explains content\n(in)accuracies with references. It conducts multimodal retrieval and interprets\nvisual content to verify and correct multimodal content. Given the absence of a\ncomprehensive evaluation approach, we propose 13 dimensions of misinformation\ncorrection quality. Then, fact-checking experts evaluate responses to social\nmedia content that are not presupposed to be misinformation but broadly include\n(partially) incorrect and correct posts that may (not) be misleading.

Among these challenges, one\nparticularly pressing issue is Fact-Conflicting Hallucination (FCH), where LLMs\ngenerate content that directly contradicts established facts. Tackling FCH\nposes a formidable task due to two primary obstacles: Firstly, automating the\nconstruction and updating of benchmark datasets is challenging, as current\nmethods rely on static benchmarks that don't cover the diverse range of FCH\nscenarios. Secondly, validating LLM outputs' reasoning process is inherently\ncomplex, especially with intricate logical relations involved.\n  In addressing these obstacles, we propose an innovative approach leveraging\nlogic programming to enhance metamorphic testing for detecting Fact-Conflicting\nHallucinations (FCH). Our method gathers data from sources like Wikipedia,\nexpands it with logical reasoning to create diverse test cases, assesses LLMs\nthrough structured prompts, and validates their coherence using semantic-aware\nassessment mechanisms. Our method generates test cases and detects\nhallucinations across six different LLMs spanning nine domains, revealing\nhallucination rates ranging from 24.7% to 59.8%. Key observations indicate that\nLLMs encounter challenges, particularly with temporal concepts, handling\nout-of-distribution knowledge, and exhibiting deficiencies in logical reasoning\ncapabilities.

This\nability to manipulate LLM-generated search responses provides vendors with a\nconsiderable competitive advantage and has the potential to disrupt fair market\ncompetition. Just as search engine optimization (SEO) revolutionized how\nwebpages are customized to rank higher in search engine results, influencing\nLLM recommendations could profoundly impact content optimization for AI-driven\nsearch services. Code for our experiments is available at\nhttps://github.com/aounon/llm-rank-optimizer."

In pursuit of\nthese goals, many states have implemented a range of incentive policies aimed\nat stimulating EV adoption and charging infrastructure development, especially\npublic EV charging stations (EVCS). This study examines the indirect network\neffect observed between EV adoption and EVCS deployment within urban\nlandscapes. We developed a two-sided log-log regression model with historical\ndata on EV purchases and EVCS development to quantify this effect. To test the\nrobustness, we then conducted a case study of the EV market in Los Angeles (LA)\nCounty, which suggests that a 1% increase in EVCS correlates with a 0.35%\nincrease in EV sales. Additionally, we forecasted the future EV market dynamics\nin LA County, revealing a notable disparity between current policies and the\ntargeted 80% EV market share for private cars by 2045. To bridge this gap, we\nproposed a combined policy recommendation that enhances EV incentives by 60%\nand EVCS rebates by 66%, facilitating the achievement of future EV market\nobjectives.",

In pursuit of\nthese goals, many states have implemented a range of incentive policies aimed\nat stimulating EV adoption and charging infrastructure development, especially\npublic EV charging stations (EVCS). This study examines the indirect network\neffect observed between EV adoption and EVCS deployment within urban\nlandscapes. We developed a two-sided log-log regression model with historical\ndata on EV purchases and EVCS development to quantify this effect. To test the\nrobustness, we then conducted a case study of the EV market in Los Angeles (LA)\nCounty, which suggests that a 1% increase in EVCS correlates with a 0.35%\nincrease in EV sales. Additionally, we forecasted the future EV market dynamics\nin LA County, revealing a notable disparity between current policies and the\ntargeted 80% EV market share for private cars by 2045. To bridge this gap, we\nproposed a combined policy recommendation that enhances EV incentives by 60%\nand EVCS rebates by 66%, facilitating the achievement of future EV market\nobjectives."

We propose actionable strategies to enhance\ndiversity and inclusivity in artificial intelligence research, with the\nultimate goal of fostering a more inclusive and equitable future in healthcare\ninnovation."

We contribute $\\sim 50$\noriginal and challenging problems in celestial mechanics (with REBOUND),\nstellar physics (with MESA), 1D fluid dynamics (with Dedalus) and non-linear\ndynamics (with SciPy). Since our problems do not admit unique solutions, we\nevaluate LLM performance on several soft metrics: counts of lines that contain\ndifferent types of errors (coding, physics, necessity and sufficiency) as well\nas a more \"educational\" Pass-Fail metric focused on capturing the salient\nphysical ingredients of the problem at hand.\n  As expected, today's SOTA LLM (GPT4) zero-shot fails most of our problems,\nalthough about 40\\% of the solutions could plausibly get a passing grade. About\n$70-90 \\%$ of the code lines produced are necessary, sufficient and correct\n(coding \\& physics). Physics and coding errors are the most common, with some\nunnecessary or insufficient lines. We observe significant variations across\nproblem class and difficulty. We identify several failure modes of GPT4 in the\ncomputational physics domain.\n  Our reconnaissance work provides a snapshot of current computational\ncapabilities in classical physics and points to obvious improvement targets if\nAI systems are ever to reach a basic level of autonomy in physics simulation\ncapabilities."

While open-source LLMs offer solutions to these concerns, they\ntypically underperform commercial models in RTL code generation tasks,\nprimarily due to the scarcity of high-quality open-source RTL datasets. To\naddress this challenge, we introduce OriGen , a fully open-source framework\nthat incorporates self-reflection capabilities and a novel dataset augmentation\nmethodology for generating high-quality, large-scale RTL code. Our approach\nemploys a code-tocode augmentation technique to enhance the quality of\nopen-source RTL code datasets. Furthermore, OriGen can rectify syntactic errors\nthrough a self-reflection process that leverages compiler feedback.\nExperimental results demonstrate that OriGen significantly outperforms other\nopen-source alternatives in RTL code generation. It surpasses the previous\nbest-performing open-source LLM by 12.8% and even exceeds GPT-4 Turbo in the\npass@1 metric on the VerilogEval-Human benchmark.

While open-source LLMs offer solutions to these concerns, they\ntypically underperform commercial models in RTL code generation tasks,\nprimarily due to the scarcity of high-quality open-source RTL datasets. To\naddress this challenge, we introduce OriGen , a fully open-source framework\nthat incorporates self-reflection capabilities and a novel dataset augmentation\nmethodology for generating high-quality, large-scale RTL code. Our approach\nemploys a code-tocode augmentation technique to enhance the quality of\nopen-source RTL code datasets. Furthermore, OriGen can rectify syntactic errors\nthrough a self-reflection process that leverages compiler feedback.\nExperimental results demonstrate that OriGen significantly outperforms other\nopen-source alternatives in RTL code generation. It surpasses the previous\nbest-performing open-source LLM by 12.8% and even exceeds GPT-4 Turbo in the\npass@1 metric on the VerilogEval-Human benchmark. Moreover, OriGen exhibits\nsuperior capabilities in self-reflection and error correction, outperforming\nGPT-4 by 19.9% on a benchmark designed to evaluate self-reflection\ncapabilities."

We observed that larger models outputted labels\nthat maintained or increased the inter-annotator agreement, suggesting that\nthey are within the expected variance between human raters. However, their\ncorrelation with majority-voted human ratings varied across different quality\naspects, indicating that they are not a complete replacement. In turn, using\nLLMs as a supplement to a smaller group of human raters in some cases improved\nthe correlation with the original majority labels. However, the effect was\nlimited to cases where human raters were scarce, and an additional human rater\nhad a more pronounced effect in all cases.

Such a design forces the retriever to search over a large corpus to\nfind the `needle' unit. In contrast, the readers only need to generate answers\nfrom the short retrieved units. The imbalanced `heavy' retriever and `light'\nreader design can lead to sub-optimal performance. The loss of contextual\ninformation in the short, chunked units may increase the likelihood of\nintroducing hard negatives during the retrieval stage. Additionally, the reader\nmight not fully leverage the capabilities of recent advancements in LLMs. In\norder to alleviate the imbalance, we propose a new framework LongRAG,\nconsisting of a `long retriever' and a `long reader'. In the two\nWikipedia-based datasets, NQ and HotpotQA, LongRAG processes the entire\nWikipedia corpus into 4K-token units by grouping related documents. By\nincreasing the unit size, we significantly reduce the total number of units.\nThis greatly reduces the burden on the retriever, resulting in strong retrieval\nperformance with only a few (less than 8) top units. Without requiring any\ntraining, LongRAG achieves an EM of 62.7% on NQ and 64.3% on HotpotQA, which\nare on par with the (fully-trained) SoTA model. Furthermore, we test on two\nnon-Wikipedia-based datasets, Qasper and MultiFieldQA-en. LongRAG processes\neach individual document as a single (long) unit rather than chunking them into\nsmaller units.

In\nthis paper, we propose a novel and lightweight framework Med-MoE\n(Mixture-of-Experts) that tackles both discriminative and generative multimodal\nmedical tasks. The learning of Med-MoE consists of three steps: multimodal\nmedical alignment, instruction tuning and routing, and domain-specific MoE\ntuning. After aligning multimodal medical images with LLM tokens, we then\nenable the model for different multimodal medical tasks with instruction\ntuning, together with a trainable router tailored for expert selection across\ninput modalities. Finally, the model is tuned by integrating the router with\nmultiple domain-specific experts, which are selectively activated and further\nempowered by meta expert. Comprehensive experiments on both open- and close-end\nmedical question answering (Med-VQA) and image classification tasks across\ndatasets such as VQA-RAD, SLAKE and Path-VQA demonstrate that our model can\nachieve performance superior to or on par with state-of-the-art baselines,\nwhile only requiring approximately 30\\%-50\\% of activated model parameters.\nExtensive analysis and ablations corroborate the effectiveness and practical\nutility of our method.",

This,\ncombined with the high costs of faster computing chips and interconnects, has\nsignificantly inflated High Performance Computing (HPC) construction costs. To\naddress these challenges, we introduce the Fire-Flyer AI-HPC architecture, a\nsynergistic hardware-software co-design framework and its best practices. For\nDL training, we deployed the Fire-Flyer 2 with 10,000 PCIe A100 GPUs, achieved\nperformance approximating the DGX-A100 while reducing costs by half and energy\nconsumption by 40%. We specifically engineered HFReduce to accelerate allreduce\ncommunication and implemented numerous measures to keep our Computation-Storage\nIntegrated Network congestion-free. Through our software stack, including\nHaiScale, 3FS, and HAI-Platform, we achieved substantial scalability by\noverlapping computation and communication. Our system-oriented experience from\nDL training provides valuable insights to drive future advancements in AI-HPC."

Yet, the heavy SR DNN\ninference overhead leads to severe deployment challenges. To reduce the\noverhead, existing systems propose to apply DNN-based SR only on carefully\nselected anchor frames while upscaling non-anchor frames via the lightweight\nreusing-based SR approach. However, frame-level scheduling is coarse-grained\nand fails to deliver optimal efficiency. In this work, we propose Palantir, the\nfirst neural-enhanced UHD live streaming system with fine-grained patch-level\nscheduling. Two novel techniques are incorporated into Palantir to select the\nmost beneficial anchor patches and support latency-sensitive UHD live streaming\napplications. Firstly, under the guidance of our pioneering and theoretical\nanalysis, Palantir constructs a directed acyclic graph (DAG) for lightweight\nyet accurate SR quality estimation under any possible anchor patch set.\nSecondly, to further optimize the scheduling latency, Palantir improves\nparallelizability by refactoring the computation subprocedure of the estimation\nprocess into a sparse matrix-matrix multiplication operation.\n  The evaluation results suggest that Palantir incurs a negligible scheduling\nlatency accounting for less than 5.7% of the end-to-end latency requirement.\nWhen compared to the naive method of applying DNN-based SR on all the frames,\nPalantir can reduce the SR DNN inference overhead by 20 times (or 60 times)\nwhile preserving 54.0-82.6% (or 32.8-64.0%) of the quality gain. When compared\nto the state-of-the-art real-time frame-level scheduling strategy, Palantir can\nreduce the SR DNN inference overhead by 80.1% at most (and 38.4% on average)\nwithout sacrificing the video quality.",

We introduce a\ndrama machine framework that coordinates interactions between LLM agents\nplaying different 'Ego' and 'Superego' psychological roles. In roleplay\nsimulations, this design allows intersubjective dialogue and intra-subjective\ninternal monologue to develop in parallel. We apply this framework to two\ndramatic scenarios - an interview and a detective story - and compare character\ndevelopment with and without the Superego's influence. Though exploratory,\nresults suggest this multi-agent approach can produce more nuanced, adaptive\nnarratives that evolve over a sequence of dialogical turns. We discuss\ndifferent modalities of LLM-based roleplay and character development, along\nwith what this might mean for conceptualization of AI subjectivity. The paper\nconcludes by considering how this approach opens possibilities for thinking of\nthe roles of internal conflict and social performativity in AI-based\nsimulation.",

To address this gap, in this paper, we focus on predicting the\ntype of fix that is required to remove flakiness and then repair the test code\non that basis. We do this for a subset of flaky tests where the root cause of\nflakiness is in the test itself and not in the production code.

Thus, we first propose a\nframework that automatically generates labeled datasets for 13 fix categories\nand trains models to predict the fix category of a flaky test by analyzing the\ntest code only. Our experimental results using code models and few-shot\nlearning show that we can correctly predict most of the fix categories. To show\nthe usefulness of such fix category labels for automatically repairing\nflakiness, we augment the prompts of GPT-3.5 Turbo, a Large Language Model\n(LLM), with such extra knowledge to request repair suggestions. The results\nshow that our suggested fix category labels, complemented with in-context\nlearning, significantly enhance the capability of GPT-3.5 Turbo in generating\nfixes for flaky tests.

Given\nthe intense efforts by leading labs to train and deploy increasingly larger and\nmore capable LLMs, it is critical to ask if the risk of data poisoning will be\nnaturally mitigated by scale, or if it is an increasing threat. We consider\nthree threat models by which data poisoning can occur: malicious fine-tuning,\nimperfect data curation, and intentional data contamination.

Poisoned data is hard to\ndetect, breaks guardrails, and leads to undesirable and harmful behavior. Given\nthe intense efforts by leading labs to train and deploy increasingly larger and\nmore capable LLMs, it is critical to ask if the risk of data poisoning will be\nnaturally mitigated by scale, or if it is an increasing threat. We consider\nthree threat models by which data poisoning can occur: malicious fine-tuning,\nimperfect data curation, and intentional data contamination.

However, current efforts\nprimarily concentrate on either generating the 3D avatar mesh alone or\nproducing motion sequences, with integrating these two aspects proving to be a\npersistent challenge.

To bridge\nthese gaps, our paper presents three key contributions. Firstly, we proposed a\nnovel agent-based approach named Motion Avatar, which allows for the automatic\ngeneration of high-quality customizable human and animal avatars with motions\nthrough text queries. The method significantly advanced the progress in dynamic\n3D character generation. Secondly, we introduced a LLM planner that coordinates\nboth motion and avatar generation, which transforms a discriminative planning\ninto a customizable Q&A fashion.
