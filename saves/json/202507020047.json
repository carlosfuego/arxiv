Enhancing the capacity,\ndensity, or bandwidth of these memories can unlock substantial performance\ngains; however, the recent stagnation of SRAM bit-cell scaling leads to\ninequivalent losses in compute density.\n  To address the challenges posed by SRAM's scaling and leakage power\nconsumption, this paper explores the potential CMOS+X integration of amorphous\noxide semiconductor (AOS) transistors in capacitive, persistent memory\ntopologies (e.g., 1T1C eDRAM, 2T0C/3T0C Gain Cell) as alternative cells in\nmulti-ported and high-bandwidth banked GPGPU memories. A detailed study of the\ndensity and energy tradeoffs of back-end-of-line (BEOL) integrated memories\nutilizing monolithic 3D (M3D)-integrated multiplexed arrays is conducted, while\naccounting for the macro-level limitations of integrating AOS candidate\nstructures proposed by the device community (an aspect often overlooked in\nprior work). By exploiting the short lifetime of register operands, we propose\na multi-ported AOS gain-cell capable of delivering 3x the read ports in ~76% of\nthe footprint of SRAM with over 70% lower standby power, enabling enhancements\nto compute capacity, such as larger warp sizes or processor counts. Benchmarks\nrun on a validated NVIDIA Ampere-class GPU model, using a modified version of\nAccel-Sim, demonstrate improvements of up to 5.2x the performance per watt and\nan average 8% higher geometric mean instruction per cycle (IPC) on various\ncompute- and memory-bound tasks.",

Enhancing the capacity,\ndensity, or bandwidth of these memories can unlock substantial performance\ngains; however, the recent stagnation of SRAM bit-cell scaling leads to\ninequivalent losses in compute density.\n  To address the challenges posed by SRAM's scaling and leakage power\nconsumption, this paper explores the potential CMOS+X integration of amorphous\noxide semiconductor (AOS) transistors in capacitive, persistent memory\ntopologies (e.g., 1T1C eDRAM, 2T0C/3T0C Gain Cell) as alternative cells in\nmulti-ported and high-bandwidth banked GPGPU memories. A detailed study of the\ndensity and energy tradeoffs of back-end-of-line (BEOL) integrated memories\nutilizing monolithic 3D (M3D)-integrated multiplexed arrays is conducted, while\naccounting for the macro-level limitations of integrating AOS candidate\nstructures proposed by the device community (an aspect often overlooked in\nprior work). By exploiting the short lifetime of register operands, we propose\na multi-ported AOS gain-cell capable of delivering 3x the read ports in ~76% of\nthe footprint of SRAM with over 70% lower standby power, enabling enhancements\nto compute capacity, such as larger warp sizes or processor counts. Benchmarks\nrun on a validated NVIDIA Ampere-class GPU model, using a modified version of\nAccel-Sim, demonstrate improvements of up to 5.2x the performance per watt and\nan average 8% higher geometric mean instruction per cycle (IPC) on various\ncompute- and memory-bound tasks."

Several approaches have been proposed to extend\nthe input length at test time, but training with these approaches is still\ndifficult, requiring truncation of input documents and causing a mismatch\nbetween training and test conditions. In this work, we propose CachED (Gradient\n$\\textbf{Cach}$ing for $\\textbf{E}$ncoder-$\\textbf{D}$ecoder models), an\napproach that enables end-to-end training of existing transformer-based\nencoder-decoder models, using the entire document without truncation.\nSpecifically, we apply non-overlapping sliding windows to input documents,\nfollowed by fusion in decoder. During backpropagation, the gradients are cached\nat the decoder and are passed through the encoder in chunks by re-computing the\nhidden vectors, similar to gradient checkpointing. In the experiments on long\ndocument summarization, we extend BART to CachED BART, processing more than\n500K tokens during training and achieving superior performance without using\nany additional parameters.",

Several approaches have been proposed to extend\nthe input length at test time, but training with these approaches is still\ndifficult, requiring truncation of input documents and causing a mismatch\nbetween training and test conditions. In this work, we propose CachED (Gradient\n$\\textbf{Cach}$ing for $\\textbf{E}$ncoder-$\\textbf{D}$ecoder models), an\napproach that enables end-to-end training of existing transformer-based\nencoder-decoder models, using the entire document without truncation.\nSpecifically, we apply non-overlapping sliding windows to input documents,\nfollowed by fusion in decoder. During backpropagation, the gradients are cached\nat the decoder and are passed through the encoder in chunks by re-computing the\nhidden vectors, similar to gradient checkpointing. In the experiments on long\ndocument summarization, we extend BART to CachED BART, processing more than\n500K tokens during training and achieving superior performance without using\nany additional parameters."

Recent approaches have explored KV compression to mitigate\nthis issue, but they often suffer from significant information loss at high\ncompression ratios. In this paper, we introduce Video-X^2L, which flexibly\npreserves critical video information for each LVU task. Video-X^2L involves two\nkey operations. The first one is called bi-level KV compression. During the\nMLLM's pre-filling stage, Video-X^2L generates two types of compressed KVs:\nlow-compression KVs (L-KVs) to capture fine-grained video details and\nhigh-compression KVs (H-KVs) to offer compact video representations. The second\none is called selective KV re-loading. During the MLLM's decoding stage,\nVideo-X^2L selectively re-loads L-KVs for the most critical video chunks while\nusing H-KVs for other less important ones. This allows the MLLM to fully\nutilize task-specific information while maintaining the overall compactness.\nVideo-X^2L is simple yet effective: it is free from additional training and\ndirectly compatible with existing KV-compressible MLLMs. We evaluate Video-X^2L\nwith a variety of popular LVU benchmarks, including VideoMME, MLVU,\nLongVideoBench, and VNBench. Our experiment result shows that Video-X^2L\noutperforms existing KV-compression methods by a huge advantage while\nsubstantially saving the computation cost.",

To address\nthis critical bottleneck, we propose AirCache, a novel KV cache compression\nmethod aimed at accelerating LVLMs inference. This work systematically\ninvestigates the correlations between visual and textual tokens within the\nattention mechanisms of LVLMs. Our empirical analysis reveals considerable\nredundancy in cached visual tokens, wherein strategically eliminating these\ntokens preserves model performance while significantly accelerating context\ngeneration. Inspired by these findings, we introduce an elite observation\nwindow for assessing the importance of visual components in the KV cache,\nfocusing on stable inter-modal relevancy modeling with enhanced\nmulti-perspective consistency. Additionally, we develop an adaptive layer-wise\nbudget allocation strategy that capitalizes on the strength and skewness of\ntoken importance distribution, showcasing superior efficiency compared to\nuniform allocation. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple LVLMs and\nbenchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves comparable performance to the\nfull cache while retaining only 10% of visual KV cache, thereby reducing\ndecoding latency by 29% to 66% across various batch size and prompt length of\ninputs.

Consequently, these methods often fall short compared to\nother compression techniques like pruning and quantization, and introduce\nruntime overhead such as the extra GEMM kernel launches for decomposed small\nmatrices. To address these limitations, we propose $\\tt A^\\tt 3$, a\npost-training low-rank approximation framework. $\\tt A^\\tt 3$ splits a\nTransformer layer into three functional components, namely $\\tt QK$, $\\tt OV$,\nand $\\tt MLP$. For each component, $\\tt A^\\tt 3$ provides an analytical\nsolution that reduces the hidden dimension size inside each component while\nminimizing the component's functional loss ($\\it i.e.$, error in attention\nscores, attention outputs, and MLP outputs). This approach directly reduces\nmodel sizes, KV cache sizes, and FLOPs without introducing any runtime\noverheads. In addition, it provides a new narrative in advancing the\noptimization problem from singular linear layer loss optimization toward\nimproved end-to-end performance. Through extensive experiments, we show that\n$\\tt A^\\tt 3$ maintains superior performance compared to SoTAs. For example,\nunder the same reduction budget in computation and memory, our low-rank\napproximated LLaMA 3.1-70B achieves a perplexity of 4.69 on WikiText-2,\noutperforming the previous SoTA's 7.87 by 3.18. We also demonstrate the\nversatility of $\\tt A^\\tt 3$, including KV cache compression, quantization, and\nmixed-rank assignments for enhanced performance.",

In a recent study, differences of up to a factor\nof 2 were found between the predicted survival of floating and adherent cells.\nThe present work aims to quantify the biases introduced by the simulation setup\nand the use of voxelized geometry in conjunction with the local effect model\nfor cell survival. The results show that simulated irradiation of a cell near\nthe surface with an incident beam matched to the cell dimensions results in\ndose values that are by a factor of about 50 lower than the dose to cells\ndeeper in the medium when irradiated with a Co-60 spectrum and lateral beam\ndimensions in the centimeter range. Furthermore, the number of ionizing photon\ninteractions in gold nanoparticles in a cell near the surface is lower by a\nfactor of about 2 than for cells at 5 mm and 1 cm depth. Using the average dose\nin voxels of size in the order of 200 nm for assessing cell survival with the\nlocal effect model (LEM) leads to an underestimation of the number of lesions\nfrom a single ionized AuNP by roughly two orders of magnitude and thus to an\noverestimation of cell survival. The effect of cell geometry on the survival\nrate was examined for approximate cell geometries and 100 kV x-ray irradiation,\nfor which the probability of photon interaction in gold nanoparticles is by\nmore than two orders of magnitude higher than for Co-60 irradiation. The\nresults show that the effects are negligible for 5 nm nanoparticles at the\nconcentration of AuNPs considered in preceding work. For 50 nm nanoparticles\nand thus a thousand times higher mass fraction of gold, significant reduction\nin cell survival is found, with a clear additional reduction predicted by the\nLEM as compared to the prediction based on mean dose to the nucleus.",

We observe that quantizing\nthe KV cache of different tokens has varying impacts on the quality of\nattention outputs. To systematically investigate this phenomenon, we perform\nforward error propagation analysis on attention and propose the Anchor Score\n(AnS) that quantifies the sensitivity of each token's KV cache to\nquantization-induced error. Our analysis reveals significant disparities in AnS\nacross tokens, suggesting that preserving a small subset with full precision\n(FP16) of high-AnS tokens can greatly mitigate accuracy loss in aggressive\nquantization scenarios. Based on this insight, we introduce AnTKV, a novel\nframework that leverages Anchor Token-aware Vector Quantization to compress the\nKV cache. Furthermore, to support efficient deployment, we design and develop a\ntriton kernel that is fully compatible with FlashAttention, enabling fast\nonline Anchor Token selection. AnTKV enables LLaMA-3-8B to handle context\nlengths up to 840K tokens on a single 80GB A100 GPU, while achieving up to 3.5x\nhigher decoding throughput compared to the FP16 baseline.

A critical challenge is ensuring that distributed memories remain\nsynchronized, relevant, and free from the accumulation of outdated or\ninconsequential data - a process analogous to biological forgetting. This paper\nintroduces the Co-Forgetting Protocol, a novel, comprehensive framework\ndesigned to address this challenge by enabling synchronized memory pruning in\nMAS. The protocol integrates three key components: (1) context-aware semantic\nvoting, where agents utilize a lightweight DistilBERT model to assess the\nrelevance of memory items based on their content and the current operational\ncontext; (2) multi-scale temporal decay functions, which assign diminishing\nimportance to memories based on their age and access frequency across different\ntime horizons; and (3) a Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT)-based\nconsensus mechanism, ensuring that decisions to retain or discard memory items\nare agreed upon by a qualified and fault-tolerant majority of agents, even in\nthe presence of up to f Byzantine (malicious or faulty) agents in a system of N\ngreater than or equal to 3f+1 agents. The protocol leverages gRPC for efficient\ninter-agent communication and Pinecone for scalable vector embedding storage\nand similarity search, with SQLite managing metadata. Experimental evaluations\nin a simulated MAS environment with four agents demonstrate the protocol's\nefficacy, achieving a 52% reduction in memory footprint over 500 epochs, 88%\nvoting accuracy in forgetting decisions against human-annotated benchmarks, a\n92% PBFT consensus success rate under simulated Byzantine conditions, and an\n82% cache hit rate for memory access.",

This significantly reduces\ncomputational and memory overhead. During decoding, bi-level key-value decoding\nselectively reloads either dense or sparse key-values for each chunk based on\nits relevance to the task. This approach further improves memory efficiency and\nenhances the model's ability to capture fine-grained information.

To address this, we propose Commutative\nVector Quantization (CommVQ) to significantly reduce memory usage for\nlong-context LLM inference. We first introduce additive quantization with a\nlightweight encoder and codebook to compress the KV cache, which can be decoded\nvia simple matrix multiplication. To further reduce computational costs during\ndecoding, we design the codebook to be commutative with Rotary Position\nEmbedding (RoPE) and train it using an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm.\nThis enables efficient integration of decoding into the self-attention\nmechanism. Our approach achieves high accuracy with additive quantization and\nlow overhead via the RoPE-commutative codebook. Experiments on long-context\nbenchmarks and GSM8K show that our method reduces FP16 KV cache size by 87.5%\nwith 2-bit quantization, while outperforming state-of-the-art KV cache\nquantization methods. Notably, it enables 1-bit KV cache quantization with\nminimal accuracy loss, allowing a LLaMA-3.1 8B model to run with a 128K context\nlength on a single RTX 4090 GPU.

Many prior works have proposed ways of discarding KVs from memory, but\ntheir approaches are tailored to favorable settings, obscuring caveats like\nhigh peak memory and performance degradation, and a fair comparison between\nmethods is difficult. In this paper, we propose the *KV footprint* as a unified\nmetric, which accounts for both the amount of KV entries stored and their\nlifespan in memory. We evaluate methods based on the smallest footprint they\nattain while preserving performance in both long-context understanding and\ngeneration, with context lengths of up to 128K tokens. This metric reveals the\nhigh peak memory of prior KV eviction methods. One class of methods --\n*post-fill eviction* -- has a high footprint due to being incompatible with\neviction during pre-filling. We adapt these methods to be able to evict KVs\nduring pre-filling, achieving substantially lower KV footprints. We then turn\nto *recency eviction* methods, wherein we propose PruLong, an end-to-end\noptimization method for learning which attention heads need to retain the full\nKV cache and which do not. PruLong saves memory while preserving long-context\nperformance, achieving 12% smaller KV footprint than prior methods while\nretaining performance in challenging recall tasks.

Discharge capillaries are plasma sources used in\nplasma accelerator research to provide acceleration targets, or as plasma\nlenses to capture or focus accelerated beams. They have applications for\nbeam-driven and laser-driven plasma accelerators and can sustain high\nrepetition rates for extended periods of time.

Prior work has attempted to mitigate this by caching and reusing\nfeatures within diffusion transformers across inference steps. These methods,\nhowever, often rely on rigid heuristics that result in limited acceleration or\npoor generalization across architectures. We propose Evolutionary Caching to\nAccelerate Diffusion models (ECAD), a genetic algorithm that learns efficient,\nper-model, caching schedules forming a Pareto frontier, using only a small set\nof calibration prompts. ECAD requires no modifications to network parameters or\nreference images. It offers significant inference speedups, enables\nfine-grained control over the quality-latency trade-off, and adapts seamlessly\nto different diffusion models. Notably, ECAD's learned schedules can generalize\neffectively to resolutions and model variants not seen during calibration. We\nevaluate ECAD on PixArt-alpha, PixArt-Sigma, and FLUX-1.dev using multiple\nmetrics (FID, CLIP, Image Reward) across diverse benchmarks (COCO, MJHQ-30k,\nPartiPrompts), demonstrating consistent improvements over previous approaches.\nOn PixArt-alpha, ECAD identifies a schedule that outperforms the previous\nstate-of-the-art method by 4.47 COCO FID while increasing inference speedup\nfrom 2.35x to 2.58x.

To achieve this, existing\nmethods often require intricate modifications to prompting and sampling\nstrategies. In this work, we introduce representation consistency (RC), a\ntest-time scaling method for aggregating answers drawn from multiple candidate\nresponses of an LLM regardless of how they were generated, including variations\nin prompt phrasing and sampling strategy. RC enhances answer aggregation by not\nonly considering the number of occurrences of each answer in the candidate\nresponse set, but also the consistency of the model's internal activations\nwhile generating the set of responses leading to each answer. These activations\ncan be either dense (raw model activations) or sparse (encoded via pretrained\nsparse autoencoders). Our rationale is that if the model's representations of\nmultiple responses converging on the same answer are highly variable, this\nanswer is more likely to be the result of incoherent reasoning and should be\ndown-weighted during aggregation. Importantly, our method only uses cached\nactivations and lightweight similarity computations and requires no additional\nmodel queries. Through experiments with four open-source LLMs and four\nreasoning datasets, we validate the effectiveness of RC for improving task\nperformance during inference, with consistent accuracy improvements (up to 4%)\nover strong test-time scaling baselines. We also show that consistency in the\nsparse activation signals aligns well with the common notion of coherent\nreasoning.",

Existing LLM caching techniques (like\ncontext caching and semantic caching), primarily designed for serving chatbots,\nare insufficient for agentic applications where outputs depend on external data\nor environmental contexts. We propose agentic plan caching, a novel approach\nthat extracts, stores, adapts, and reuses structured plan templates from\nplanning stages of agentic applications across semantically similar tasks to\nreduce the cost of serving. Unlike traditional semantic caching, our system\nextracts plan templates from completed agent executions at test-time, employs\nkeyword extraction to match new requests against cached plans, and utilizes\nlightweight models to adapt these templates to task-specific plans with\ncontexts. Evaluation across multiple real-world agentic applications shows that\nour system can reduce costs by 46.62% on average while maintaining performance,\noffering a more efficient solution for serving LLM-based agents that\ncomplements existing LLM serving infrastructures.",

                    "value": "LLM-based agentic applications have shown increasingly remarkable\ncapabilities in complex workflows but incur substantial costs due to extensive\nplanning and reasoning requirements. Existing LLM caching techniques (like\ncontext caching and semantic caching), primarily designed for serving chatbots,\nare insufficient for agentic applications where outputs depend on external data\nor environmental contexts. We propose agentic plan caching, a novel approach\nthat extracts, stores, adapts, and reuses structured plan templates from\nplanning stages of agentic applications across semantically similar tasks to\nreduce the cost of serving. Unlike traditional semantic caching, our system\nextracts plan templates from completed agent executions at test-time, employs\nkeyword extraction to match new requests against cached plans, and utilizes\nlightweight models to adapt these templates to task-specific plans with\ncontexts. Evaluation across multiple real-world agentic applications shows that\nour system can reduce costs by 46.62% on average while maintaining performance,\noffering a more efficient solution for serving LLM-based agents that\ncomplements existing LLM serving infrastructures."

Inference benchmarks on NVIDIA A100 GPUs reveal that MLA with r=d/2\nachieves a 1.4 times speedup over full-rank MLA while maintaining the memory\nsavings.

However, the\nsecurity of local LLMs through the lens of hardware cache side-channels remains\nunexplored. In this paper, we unveil novel side-channel vulnerabilities in\nlocal LLM inference: token value and token position leakage, which can expose\nboth the victim's input and output text, thereby compromising user privacy.\nSpecifically, we found that adversaries can infer the token values from the\ncache access patterns of the token embedding operation, and deduce the token\npositions from the timing of autoregressive decoding phases. To demonstrate the\npotential of these leaks, we design a novel eavesdropping attack framework\ntargeting both open-source and proprietary LLM inference systems. The attack\nframework does not directly interact with the victim's LLM and can be executed\nwithout privilege.\n  We evaluate the attack on a range of practical local LLM deployments (e.g.,\nLlama, Falcon, and Gemma), and the results show that our attack achieves\npromising accuracy. The restored output and input text have an average edit\ndistance of 5.2% and 17.3% to the ground truth, respectively.

                "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely deployed in a variety of\napplications, and the context length is rapidly increasing to handle tasks such\nas long-document QA and complex logical reasoning. However, long context poses\nsignificant challenges for inference efficiency, including high memory costs of\nkey-value (KV) cache and increased latency due to extensive memory accesses.\nRecent works have proposed compressing KV cache to approximate computation, but\nthese methods either evict tokens permanently, never recalling them for later\ninference, or recall previous tokens at the granularity of pages divided by\ntextual positions. Both approaches degrade the model accuracy and output\nquality. To achieve efficient and accurate recallable KV cache compression, we\nintroduce ClusterKV, which recalls tokens at the granularity of semantic\nclusters. We design and implement efficient algorithms and systems for\nclustering, selection, indexing and caching. Experiment results show that\nClusterKV attains negligible accuracy loss across various tasks with 32k\ncontext lengths, using only a 1k to 2k KV cache budget, and achieves up to a\n2$\\times$ speedup in latency and a 2.5$\\times$ improvement in decoding\nthroughput. Compared to SoTA recallable KV compression methods, ClusterKV\ndemonstrates higher model accuracy and output quality, while maintaining or\nexceeding inference efficiency.

                    "value": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely deployed in a variety of\napplications, and the context length is rapidly increasing to handle tasks such\nas long-document QA and complex logical reasoning. However, long context poses\nsignificant challenges for inference efficiency, including high memory costs of\nkey-value (KV) cache and increased latency due to extensive memory accesses.\nRecent works have proposed compressing KV cache to approximate computation, but\nthese methods either evict tokens permanently, never recalling them for later\ninference, or recall previous tokens at the granularity of pages divided by\ntextual positions. Both approaches degrade the model accuracy and output\nquality.

We introduce SPIRAL, a self-play framework\nwhere models learn by playing multi-turn, zero-sum games against continuously\nimproving versions of themselves, eliminating the need for human supervision.\nThrough self-play, SPIRAL generates an infinite curriculum of progressively\nchallenging problems as models must constantly adapt to stronger opponents. To\nenable this self-play training at scale, We implement a fully online,\nmulti-turn, multi-agent reinforcement learning system for LLMs and propose\nrole-conditioned advantage estimation (RAE) to stabilize multi-agent training.\nUsing SPIRAL, self-play on zero-sum games produces reasoning capabilities that\ntransfer broadly. Training Qwen3-4B-Base on Kuhn Poker alone achieves 8.6%\nimprovement on math and 8.4% on general reasoning, outperforming SFT on 25,000\nexpert game trajectories. Analysis reveals that this transfer occurs through\nthree cognitive patterns: systematic decomposition, expected value calculation,\nand case-by-case analysis. Multi-game training (TicTacToe, Kuhn Poker, Simple\nNegotiation) further enhances performance as each game develops distinct\nreasoning strengths. Applying SPIRAL to a strong reasoning model\n(DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B) can still lead to 2.0% average improvement. These\nresults demonstrate that zero-sum games naturally develop transferable\nreasoning capabilities, highlighting a promising direction for autonomous\nreasoning development.",

                    "value": "Recent advances in reinforcement learning have shown that language models can\ndevelop sophisticated reasoning through training on tasks with verifiable\nrewards, but these approaches depend on human-curated problem-answer pairs and\ndomain-specific reward engineering. We introduce SPIRAL, a self-play framework\nwhere models learn by playing multi-turn, zero-sum games against continuously\nimproving versions of themselves, eliminating the need for human supervision.\nThrough self-play, SPIRAL generates an infinite curriculum of progressively\nchallenging problems as models must constantly adapt to stronger opponents. To\nenable this self-play training at scale, We implement a fully online,\nmulti-turn, multi-agent reinforcement learning system for LLMs and propose\nrole-conditioned advantage estimation (RAE) to stabilize multi-agent training.\nUsing SPIRAL, self-play on zero-sum games produces reasoning capabilities that\ntransfer broadly. Training Qwen3-4B-Base on Kuhn Poker alone achieves 8.6%\nimprovement on math and 8.4% on general reasoning, outperforming SFT on 25,000\nexpert game trajectories. Analysis reveals that this transfer occurs through\nthree cognitive patterns: systematic decomposition, expected value calculation,\nand case-by-case analysis. Multi-game training (TicTacToe, Kuhn Poker, Simple\nNegotiation) further enhances performance as each game develops distinct\nreasoning strengths. Applying SPIRAL to a strong reasoning model\n(DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B) can still lead to 2.0% average improvement. These\nresults demonstrate that zero-sum games naturally develop transferable\nreasoning capabilities, highlighting a promising direction for autonomous\nreasoning development."

Random peculiar motions act as noise in the estimation of redshift,\nand constitute independent variables in the SNIa data.

We analyzed contrast-enhanced\nchest-abdomen-pelvis CT scans from 130 adults (120 kVp, TCM). Reference doses\nfor six organs (lungs, kidneys, liver, pancreas, bladder, spleen) were\ncalculated using MC-GPU and TotalSegmentator. Based on these, we trained\nScout-Dose-TCM, a deep learning model that predicts organ doses corresponding\nto discrete cosine transform (DCT) basis functions, enabling real-time\nestimates for any TCM profile. The model combines a feature learning module\nthat extracts contextual information from lateral and frontal scouts and scan\nrange with a dose learning module that output DCT-based dose estimates.

                    "value": "This study proposes Scout-Dose-TCM for direct, prospective estimation of\norgan-level doses under tube current modulation (TCM) and compares its\nperformance to two established methods. We analyzed contrast-enhanced\nchest-abdomen-pelvis CT scans from 130 adults (120 kVp, TCM). Reference doses\nfor six organs (lungs, kidneys, liver, pancreas, bladder, spleen) were\ncalculated using MC-GPU and TotalSegmentator. Based on these, we trained\nScout-Dose-TCM, a deep learning model that predicts organ doses corresponding\nto discrete cosine transform (DCT) basis functions, enabling real-time\nestimates for any TCM profile. The model combines a feature learning module\nthat extracts contextual information from lateral and frontal scouts and scan\nrange with a dose learning module that output DCT-based dose estimates.

This complexity\nincreases when comparing different age-dating methods, as they rely on distinct\nindicators and are often applicable to non-overlapping regions of the\ncolor-magnitude diagram. Moreover, many empirical calibration methods rely on\npre-determined ages, often from open clusters or asteroseismology, which only\ncover a limited parameter space. Fortunately, the age-velocity-dispersion\nrelation (AVR), in which the velocity dispersion increases with age, is a\nuniversal feature among stars of all evolutionary stages. In this paper, we 1)\nexplore the parameter space in which [C/N] and gyrochronology are applicable,\nextending beyond the domains probed by asteroseismology and open clusters, and\n2) assess whether the traditionally assumed [C/N] and gyrochronology relations\nyield ages on a consistent physical scale, after calibrating both using the\nsame AVR. We find gyrochronology can be applied to all partially convective\nstars after they have converged onto the slow rotating sequence and before they\nexperience weakened magnetic braking; [C/N] can be used to infer ages for all\ngiants with metallicity > -0.8 dex and [C/N] < -0.05 dex, and can be used as an\nage-indicator down to [Fe/H] of -1 dex if only selecting the low-$\\alpha$ disk.\nLastly, ages obtained from [C/N] and gyrochronology agree within uncertainty\nafter accounting for systematic offsets.",

In\nthis work, we propose \\textbf{ReferDINO}, a strong RVOS model that inherits\nregion-level vision-language alignment from foundational visual grounding\nmodels, and is further endowed with pixel-level dense perception and\ncross-modal spatiotemporal reasoning. In detail, ReferDINO integrates two key\ncomponents: 1) a grounding-guided deformable mask decoder that utilizes\nlocation prediction to progressively guide mask prediction through\ndifferentiable deformation mechanisms; 2) an object-consistent temporal\nenhancer that injects pretrained time-varying text features into inter-frame\ninteraction to capture object-aware dynamic changes. Moreover, a\nconfidence-aware query pruning strategy is designed to accelerate object\ndecoding without compromising model performance. Extensive experimental results\non five benchmarks demonstrate that our ReferDINO significantly outperforms\nprevious methods (e.g., +3.9% (\\mathcal{J}&\\mathcal{F}) on Ref-YouTube-VOS)\nwith real-time inference speed (51 FPS).",

In this work,\nwe introduce Test-Time Reinforcement Learning (TTRL), a novel method for\ntraining LLMs using RL on unlabeled data. TTRL enables self-evolution of LLMs\nby utilizing the priors in the pre-trained models. Our experiments demonstrate\nthat TTRL consistently improves performance across a variety of tasks and\nmodels.

Specifically, the sequence is first\nsegmented into blocks, and we introduce block-wise attention masks that enable\nthe current block to receive information from the previous or subsequent block.\nThese attention masks are combined hierarchically across different DiT-blocks\nto regulate the receptive field of DiTs. Both subjective and objective\nexperimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves performance\ncomparable to non-streaming methods while surpassing other streaming methods in\nterms of speech quality, all the while effectively managing inference time\nduring long-sequence generation.

A core challenge is the lack of large-scale real-world datasets\nannotated with diverse and fine-grained driving preferences, hindering the\ndevelopment and evaluation of personalized E2EAD models. In this work, we\npresent the first large-scale real-world dataset enriched with annotations\ncapturing diverse driving preferences, establishing a foundation for\npersonalization in E2EAD. We extract static environmental features from\nreal-world road topology and infer dynamic contextual cues using a fine-tuned\nvisual language model (VLM), enabling consistent and fine-grained scenario\nconstruction. Based on these scenarios, we derive objective preference\nannotations through behavioral distribution analysis and rule-based heuristics.\nTo address the inherent subjectivity of driving style, we further employ the\nVLM to generate subjective annotations by jointly modeling scene semantics and\ndriver behavior. Final high-quality labels are obtained through a\nhuman-in-the-loop verification process that fuses both perspectives. Building\non this dataset, we propose the first benchmark for evaluating personalized\nE2EAD models. We assess several state-of-the-art models with and without\npreference conditioning, demonstrating that incorporating personalized\npreferences results in behavior more aligned with human driving.

                "summary": "Non-invasive estimation of Li-ion battery state-of-health from operational\ndata is valuable for battery applications, but remains challenging. Pure\nmodel-based methods may suffer from inaccuracy and long-term instability of\nparameter estimates, whereas pure data-driven methods rely heavily on training\ndata quality and quantity, causing lack of generality when extrapolating to\nunseen cases.

In many experiments, especially in shock physics, radiography is the\nprimary means of observing the system of interest. However, radiography does\nnot provide direct access to key state variables, such as density, which\nprevents the application of traditional parameter estimation approaches. Here\nwe focus on flyer plate impact experiments on porous materials, and resolving\nthe underlying parameterized equation of state (EoS) and crush porosity model\nparameters given radiographic observation(s). We use machine learning as a tool\nto demonstrate with high confidence that using only high impact velocity data\ndoes not provide sufficient information to accurately infer both EoS and crush\nmodel parameters, even with fully resolved density fields or a dynamic sequence\nof images. We thus propose an observable data set consisting of low and high\nimpact velocity experiments/simulations that capture different regimes of\ncompaction and shock propagation, and proceed to introduce a generative machine\nlearning approach which produces a posterior distribution of physical\nparameters directly from radiographs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the\napproach in estimating parameters from simulated flyer plate impact\nexperiments, and show that the obtained estimates of EoS and crush model\nparameters can then be used in hydrodynamic simulations to obtain accurate and\nphysically admissible density reconstructions. Finally, we examine the\nrobustness of the approach to model mismatches, and find that the learned\napproach can provide useful parameter estimates in the presence of\nout-of-distribution radiographic noise and previously unseen physics, thereby\npromoting a potential breakthrough in estimating material properties from\nexperimental radiographic images.",

The enhanced density within the CBP produces an intensity brightening,\nbut suppresses the linear polarization. The circular polarization from such\nregions often approaches 0.1% of the intensity.

The weak field approximation (WFA) provides information on\nthe longitudinal magnetic fields in the strongest-emitting spatial intervals\nalong the LoS, and is more reliable in the regions of the CBP where the field\ndoes not change sign. This tends to coincide with the regions where there is a\nstrong correlation between the circular polarization and the wavelength\nderivative of the intensity. Considering roughly 30 minutes of time evolution,\nthe CBP signals are somewhat attenuated but are still identifiable, while the\narea where the WFA can be suitably applied remains substantial.

Our approach is structured into two key components: weather background\nediting and weather particle construction. For weather background editing, we\nintroduce an all-in-one adapter that integrates multiple weather styles into a\nsingle pretrained diffusion model, enabling the generation of diverse weather\neffects in 2D image backgrounds. During inference, we design a Temporal-View\n(TV-) attention mechanism that follows a specific order to aggregate temporal\nand spatial information, ensuring consistent editing across multi-frame and\nmulti-view images. To construct the weather particles, we first reconstruct a\n3D scene using the edited images and then introduce a dynamic 4D Gaussian field\nto generate snowflakes, raindrops and fog in the scene. The attributes and\ndynamics of these particles are precisely controlled through physical-based\nmodelling and simulation, ensuring realistic weather representation and\nflexible severity adjustments. Finally, we integrate the 4D Gaussian field with\nthe 3D scene to render consistent and highly realistic weather effects.\nExperiments on multiple driving datasets demonstrate that WeatherEdit can\ngenerate diverse weather effects with controllable condition severity,\nhighlighting its potential for autonomous driving simulation in adverse\nweather.

The\nsystem connects email communication channels with Optical Character Recognition\n(OCR) and intelligent automation, enabling non-technical administrative staff\nto delegate complex form-filling and document processing tasks using familiar\nemail interfaces. By treating the email body as a natural language prompt and\nattachments as contextual information, the workflow bridges the gap between\nadvanced AI capabilities and practical usability. Empirical evaluation shows\nthat the system can complete complex administrative forms in under 8 seconds of\nautomated processing, with human supervision reducing total staff time by a\nfactor of three to four compared to manual workflows. The top-performing LLM\naccurately filled 16 out of 29 form fields and reduced the total cost per\nprocessed form by 64% relative to manual completion. These findings demonstrate\nthat email-based LLM integration is a viable and cost-effective approach for\ndemocratizing advanced automation in organizational settings, supporting\nwidespread adoption without requiring specialized technical knowledge or major\nworkflow changes. This aligns with broader trends in leveraging LLMs to enhance\naccessibility and automate complex tasks for non-technical users, making\ntechnology more inclusive and efficient.",

While these\ncapabilities significantly expand the functional scope of AI, they also\nintroduce qualitatively novel security risks - such as memory poisoning, tool\nmisuse, reward hacking, and emergent misalignment - that extend beyond the\nthreat models of conventional systems or standalone LLMs. In this survey, we\nfirst examine the structural foundations and key capabilities that underpin\nincreasing levels of agent autonomy, including long-term memory retention,\nmodular tool use, recursive planning, and reflective reasoning. We then analyze\nthe corresponding security vulnerabilities across the agent stack, identifying\nfailure modes such as deferred decision hazards, irreversible tool chains, and\ndeceptive behaviors arising from internal state drift or value misalignment.\nThese risks are traced to architectural fragilities that emerge across\nperception, cognition, memory, and action modules. To address these challenges,\nwe systematically review recent defense strategies deployed at different\nautonomy layers, including input sanitization, memory lifecycle control,\nconstrained decision-making, structured tool invocation, and introspective\nreflection. We introduce the Reflective Risk-Aware Agent Architecture (R2A2), a\nunified cognitive framework grounded in Constrained Markov Decision Processes\n(CMDPs), which incorporates risk-aware world modeling, meta-policy adaptation,\nand joint reward-risk optimization to enable principled, proactive safety\nacross the agent's decision-making loop.",

Our\ngoal is to characterise the possible groups of companions that accompanied\nlarger known accretion events of our Galaxy, and infer where their stellar\nmaterial could be in physical and dynamical space at present day. We use the\nAURIGA simulation suite of Milky Way-like haloes to identify analogues to these\nlarge accretion events and their group infall companions, and we follow their\nevolution in time. We find that most of the material from larger accretion\nevents is deposited on much more bound orbits than their companions. This\nimplies a weak dynamical association between companions and debris, but it is\nstrongest with the material lost first. As a result, the companions of the\nMilky Way's earliest building blocks are likely to contribute stars to the\nsolar neighbourhood, whilst the companions of our last major merger are likely\nfound in both the solar neighbourhood and the outer halo. More recently\ninfallen groups of satellites, or those of a smaller mass, are more likely to\nretain dynamical coherence, for example, through clustering in the orientation\nof angular momentum. We conclude that group infall has likely shaped the Milky\nWay's stellar halo. Disentangling this will be challenging for the earliest\naccretion events, although overlap with their less-bound debris may be\nparticularly telling.",

Most existing work treats long\nvideos in the same way as short videos, which is inefficient for real-world\napplications and hard to generalize to even longer videos. To address these\nissues, we propose Flash-VStream, an efficient video language model capable of\nprocessing extremely long videos and responding to user queries in real time.\nParticularly, we design a Flash Memory module, containing a low-capacity\ncontext memory to aggregate long-context temporal information and model the\ndistribution of information density, and a high-capacity augmentation memory to\nretrieve detailed spatial information based on this distribution. Compared to\nexisting models, Flash-VStream achieves significant reductions in inference\nlatency.

                "summary": "The rapid proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has stimulated\nresearchers to seek effective and efficient approaches to deal with LLM\nhallucinations and low-quality outputs. Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is a\nkey element of machine learning applications in dealing with such challenges.\nHowever, research to date on UQ for LLMs has been fragmented in terms of\ntechniques and evaluation methodologies. In this work, we address this issue by\nintroducing a novel benchmark that implements a collection of state-of-the-art\nUQ baselines and offers an environment for controllable and consistent\nevaluation of novel UQ techniques over various text generation tasks. Our\nbenchmark also supports the assessment of confidence normalization methods in\nterms of their ability to provide interpretable scores. Using our benchmark, we\nconduct a large-scale empirical investigation of UQ and normalization\ntechniques across eleven tasks, identifying the most effective approaches.\nCode: https://github.com/IINemo/lm-polygraph Benchmark:\nhttps://huggingface.co/LM-Polygraph",

Unlike traditional VAR training with\nstatic inputs and targets, our method implements a dynamic target formulation\nbased on model outputs, enabling self-refinement. By utilizing the model's own\npredictions as inputs instead of ground truth token maps during training, we\nframe the objective as residual minimization, effectively reducing the\ndiscrepancy between training and inference procedures. Our experimental results\ndemonstrate that the proposed training approach significantly enhances the\nperformance of VAR in depth estimation tasks. When trained on Hypersim dataset\nusing our approach, the model achieves superior results across multiple unseen\nbenchmarks compared to existing generative and discriminative baselines."

This paper introduces\na five-level classification for Agent4S, outlining a clear roadmap from simple\ntask automation to fully autonomous, collaborative \"AI Scientists.\" This\nframework defines the next revolutionary step in scientific discovery."

To\nenable this self-play training at scale, We implement a fully online,\nmulti-turn, multi-agent reinforcement learning system for LLMs and propose\nrole-conditioned advantage estimation (RAE) to stabilize multi-agent training.\nUsing SPIRAL, self-play on zero-sum games produces reasoning capabilities that\ntransfer broadly. Training Qwen3-4B-Base on Kuhn Poker alone achieves 8.6%\nimprovement on math and 8.4% on general reasoning, outperforming SFT on 25,000\nexpert game trajectories. Analysis reveals that this transfer occurs through\nthree cognitive patterns: systematic decomposition, expected value calculation,\nand case-by-case analysis. Multi-game training (TicTacToe, Kuhn Poker, Simple\nNegotiation) further enhances performance as each game develops distinct\nreasoning strengths. Applying SPIRAL to a strong reasoning model\n(DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B) can still lead to 2.0% average improvement.

We evaluate this framework on a\ndataset of 314 bugs from BugsInPy using two LLMs (Llama 3.3 and GPT-4o-mini),\nand analyze fix rates across six bug types. By progressively injecting\nknowledge across layers, our approach achieves a fix rate of 79% (250/314)\nusing Llama 3.3, a significant improvement of 23% over previous work.

However, these benefits remain out of\nreach if rule extraction is manual or solely reliant on ML, as both approaches\nyield incomplete, unreliable, and/or inaccurate rules.\n  This paper formulates rule extraction as a constraint modeling problem and\nintroduces NetNomos that learns propositional logic constraints directly from\nraw network measurements. Constraint modeling in this domain is uniquely\nchallenging due to the scale of the data, the inherent learning complexity and\npassive environment, and the lack of ground truth supervision.

These generated contexts\nserve to reintroduce uncertainty, incorporate auxiliary information, and\nfacilitate interpretability. For example, in the two-sample test, we compare\nthe log-probability of strings under contexts from its own versus the other\ngroup.

The top-performing LLM\naccurately filled 16 out of 29 form fields and reduced the total cost per\nprocessed form by 64% relative to manual completion.

These large-model agents mark a paradigm shift from\nstatic inference systems to interactive, memory-augmented entities. While these\ncapabilities significantly expand the functional scope of AI, they also\nintroduce qualitatively novel security risks - such as memory poisoning, tool\nmisuse, reward hacking, and emergent misalignment - that extend beyond the\nthreat models of conventional systems or standalone LLMs. In this survey, we\nfirst examine the structural foundations and key capabilities that underpin\nincreasing levels of agent autonomy, including long-term memory retention,\nmodular tool use, recursive planning, and reflective reasoning. We then analyze\nthe corresponding security vulnerabilities across the agent stack, identifying\nfailure modes such as deferred decision hazards, irreversible tool chains, and\ndeceptive behaviors arising from internal state drift or value misalignment.\nThese risks are traced to architectural fragilities that emerge across\nperception, cognition, memory, and action modules. To address these challenges,\nwe systematically review recent defense strategies deployed at different\nautonomy layers, including input sanitization, memory lifecycle control,\nconstrained decision-making, structured tool invocation, and introspective\nreflection. We introduce the Reflective Risk-Aware Agent Architecture (R2A2), a\nunified cognitive framework grounded in Constrained Markov Decision Processes\n(CMDPs), which incorporates risk-aware world modeling, meta-policy adaptation,\nand joint reward-risk optimization to enable principled, proactive safety\nacross the agent's decision-making loop.",

Unlike prior work\nthat relies solely on the standard deviation of excess returns (adjusted for\nthe Fama-French model), which indiscriminately penalizes both upside and\ndownside risk, TinyXRA incorporates skewness, kurtosis, and the Sortino ratio\nfor more comprehensive risk assessment. We leverage TinyBERT as our encoder to\nefficiently process lengthy financial documents, coupled with a novel dynamic,\nattention-based word cloud mechanism that provides intuitive risk visualization\nwhile filtering irrelevant terms. This lightweight design ensures scalable\ndeployment across diverse computing environments with real-time processing\ncapabilities for thousands of financial documents which is essential for\nproduction systems with constrained computational resources. We employ triplet\nloss for risk quartile classification, improving over pairwise loss approaches\nin existing literature by capturing both the direction and magnitude of risk\ndifferences. Our TinyXRA achieves state-of-the-art predictive accuracy across\nseven test years on a dataset spanning 2013-2024, while providing transparent\nand interpretable risk assessments. We conduct comprehensive ablation studies\nto evaluate our contributions and assess model explanations both quantitatively\nby systematically removing highly attended words and sentences, and\nqualitatively by examining explanation coherence.

To circumvent\nthese costs, some parties may exploit existing models by using the generated\nimages as training data for their own models. In general, watermarking is a\nvaluable tool for detecting unauthorized use of generated images. However, when\nthese images are used to train a new model, watermarking can only enable\ndetection if the watermark persists through training and remains identifiable\nin the outputs of the newly trained model - a property known as radioactivity.\nWe analyze the radioactivity of watermarks in images generated by diffusion\nmodels (DMs) and image autoregressive models (IARs). We find that existing\nwatermarking methods for DMs fail to retain radioactivity, as watermarks are\neither erased during encoding into the latent space or lost in the\nnoising-denoising process (during the training in the latent space). Meanwhile,\ndespite IARs having recently surpassed DMs in image generation quality and\nefficiency, no radioactive watermarking methods have been proposed for them. To\novercome this limitation, we propose the first watermarking method tailored for\nIARs and with radioactivity in mind - drawing inspiration from techniques in\nlarge language models (LLMs), which share IARs' autoregressive paradigm. Our\nextensive experimental evaluation highlights our method's effectiveness in\npreserving radioactivity within IARs, enabling robust provenance tracking, and\npreventing unauthorized use of their generated images.",

To circumvent\nthese costs, some parties may exploit existing models by using the generated\nimages as training data for their own models. In general, watermarking is a\nvaluable tool for detecting unauthorized use of generated images. However, when\nthese images are used to train a new model, watermarking can only enable\ndetection if the watermark persists through training and remains identifiable\nin the outputs of the newly trained model - a property known as radioactivity.\nWe analyze the radioactivity of watermarks in images generated by diffusion\nmodels (DMs) and image autoregressive models (IARs). We find that existing\nwatermarking methods for DMs fail to retain radioactivity, as watermarks are\neither erased during encoding into the latent space or lost in the\nnoising-denoising process (during the training in the latent space). Meanwhile,\ndespite IARs having recently surpassed DMs in image generation quality and\nefficiency, no radioactive watermarking methods have been proposed for them. To\novercome this limitation, we propose the first watermarking method tailored for\nIARs and with radioactivity in mind - drawing inspiration from techniques in\nlarge language models (LLMs), which share IARs' autoregressive paradigm. Our\nextensive experimental evaluation highlights our method's effectiveness in\npreserving radioactivity within IARs, enabling robust provenance tracking, and\npreventing unauthorized use of their generated images."

Our system consists of three specialized agents-Planning, Execution, and\nCritique-each with its own memory bank, role, and skill set. The Planning Agent\nfunctions as the central brain, generating tasks to progress through the game.\nThese tasks are then delegated to the Execution Agent, which carries them out\nwithin the game environment. Upon task completion, the Critique Agent evaluates\nthe outcome to determine whether the objective was successfully achieved. Once\nverification is complete, control returns to the Planning Agent, forming a\nclosed-loop decision-making system.\n  As a preliminary step, we developed a battle module within the Execution\nAgent. Our results show that the battle AI achieves an average win rate of\n80.8% across 50 wild encounters, only 6% lower than the performance of an\nexperienced human player. Furthermore, we find that a model's battle\nperformance correlates strongly with its LLM Arena score on language-related\ntasks, indicating a meaningful link between linguistic ability and strategic\nreasoning. Finally, our analysis of gameplay logs reveals that each LLM\nexhibits a unique playstyle, suggesting that individual models develop distinct\nstrategic behaviors.",

                    "value": "We introduce Pok\\'eAI, the first text-based, multi-agent large language model\n(LLM) framework designed to autonomously play and progress through Pok\\'emon\nRed. Our system consists of three specialized agents-Planning, Execution, and\nCritique-each with its own memory bank, role, and skill set. The Planning Agent\nfunctions as the central brain, generating tasks to progress through the game.\nThese tasks are then delegated to the Execution Agent, which carries them out\nwithin the game environment. Upon task completion, the Critique Agent evaluates\nthe outcome to determine whether the objective was successfully achieved. Once\nverification is complete, control returns to the Planning Agent, forming a\nclosed-loop decision-making system.\n  As a preliminary step, we developed a battle module within the Execution\nAgent. Our results show that the battle AI achieves an average win rate of\n80.8% across 50 wild encounters, only 6% lower than the performance of an\nexperienced human player. Furthermore, we find that a model's battle\nperformance correlates strongly with its LLM Arena score on language-related\ntasks, indicating a meaningful link between linguistic ability and strategic\nreasoning. Finally, our analysis of gameplay logs reveals that each LLM\nexhibits a unique playstyle, suggesting that individual models develop distinct\nstrategic behaviors."

This paper proposes ChemMiner, a novel end-to-end\nframework leveraging multiple agents powered by large language models (LLMs) to\nextract high-fidelity chemical data from literature. ChemMiner incorporates\nthree specialized agents: a text analysis agent for coreference mapping, a\nmultimodal agent for non-textual information extraction, and a synthesis\nanalysis agent for data generation. Furthermore, we developed a comprehensive\nbenchmark with expert-annotated chemical literature to evaluate both extraction\nefficiency and precision. Experimental results demonstrate reaction\nidentification rates comparable to human chemists while significantly reducing\nprocessing time, with high accuracy, recall, and F1 scores. Our open-sourced\nbenchmark facilitates future research in chemical literature data mining.",

These models are typically adapted\nfrom text-based large language models (LLMs) through additional training on\naudio-related tasks. However, this adaptation process presents two major\nlimitations. First, ALLMs often suffer from catastrophic forgetting, where\ncrucial textual capabilities like instruction-following are lost after training\non audio data. In some cases, models may even hallucinate sounds that are not\npresent in the input audio, raising concerns about reliability. Second,\nachieving cross-modal alignment between audio and language typically relies on\nlarge collections of task-specific question-answer pairs for instruction\ntuning, making it resource-intensive. To address these issues, previous works\nhave leveraged the backbone LLMs to synthesize general-purpose, caption-style\nalignment data. In this paper, we propose a data generation framework that\nproduces contrastive-like training data, designed to enhance ALLMs' ability to\ndifferentiate between present and absent sounds. We further extend our approach\nto multi-audio scenarios, enabling the model to either explain differences\nbetween audio inputs or produce unified captions that describe all inputs,\nthereby enhancing audio-language alignment. We refer to the entire ALLM\ntraining framework as bootstrapping audio-language alignment via synthetic data\ngeneration from backbone LLMs (BALSa). Experimental results indicate that our\nmethod effectively mitigates audio hallucinations while reliably maintaining\nstrong performance on audio understanding and reasoning benchmarks, as well as\ninstruction-following skills. Moreover, incorporating multi-audio training\nfurther enhances the model's comprehension and reasoning capabilities. Overall,\nBALSa offers an efficient and scalable approach to developing ALLMs.",

Second,\nachieving cross-modal alignment between audio and language typically relies on\nlarge collections of task-specific question-answer pairs for instruction\ntuning, making it resource-intensive. To address these issues, previous works\nhave leveraged the backbone LLMs to synthesize general-purpose, caption-style\nalignment data. In this paper, we propose a data generation framework that\nproduces contrastive-like training data, designed to enhance ALLMs' ability to\ndifferentiate between present and absent sounds. We further extend our approach\nto multi-audio scenarios, enabling the model to either explain differences\nbetween audio inputs or produce unified captions that describe all inputs,\nthereby enhancing audio-language alignment. We refer to the entire ALLM\ntraining framework as bootstrapping audio-language alignment via synthetic data\ngeneration from backbone LLMs (BALSa). Experimental results indicate that our\nmethod effectively mitigates audio hallucinations while reliably maintaining\nstrong performance on audio understanding and reasoning benchmarks, as well as\ninstruction-following skills. Moreover, incorporating multi-audio training\nfurther enhances the model's comprehension and reasoning capabilities. Overall,\nBALSa offers an efficient and scalable approach to developing ALLMs."

Our calibration reduces the average energy estimation error to less than\n5%, substantially improving modeling accuracy and making DRAMPower a more\nreliable tool for power-aware system design and optimization on the target\nserver platform."

On the objective side, we develop a machine learning model trained\non mean opinion scores (MOS) computed via the ITU-T P.1203 reference\nimplementation, allowing accurate prediction of user-perceived video quality\nusing only network parameters such as packet loss, delay, jitter, and\nthroughput without reliance on video content or client-side instrumentation. On\nthe subjective side, we present a semantic filtering and scoring pipeline that\nprocesses user comments from live streams to extract performance-related\nfeedback. A large language model is used to assign scalar MOS scores to\nfiltered comments in a deterministic and reproducible manner. To support\nscalable and interpretable analysis, we construct a labeled dataset of 47,894\nlive-stream comments, of which about 34,000 are identified as QoE-relevant\nthrough multi-layer semantic filtering. Each comment is enriched with simulated\nInternet Service Provider attribution and temporally aligned using synthetic\ntimestamps in 5-min intervals. The resulting dataset enables operator-level\naggregation and time-series analysis of user-perceived quality. A delta MOS\nmetric is proposed to measure each Internet service provider's deviation from\nplatform-wide sentiment, allowing detection of localized degradations even in\nthe absence of direct network telemetry. A controlled outage simulation\nconfirms the framework's effectiveness in identifying service disruptions\nthrough comment-based trends alone. The system provides each operator with its\nown subjective MOS and the global platform average per interval, enabling\nreal-time interpretation of performance deviations and comparison with\nobjective network-based QoE estimates.",
