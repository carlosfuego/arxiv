Lizard addresses these limitations by introducing a subquadratic\nattention mechanism that closely approximates softmax attention while\npreserving the output quality. Unlike previous linearization methods, which are\noften limited by fixed model structures and therefore exclude gating\nmechanisms, Lizard incorporates a gating module inspired by recent\nstate-of-the-art linear models. This enables adaptive memory control, supports\nconstant-memory inference, offers strong length generalization, and allows more\nflexible model design. Lizard combines gated linear attention for global\ncontext compression with sliding window attention enhanced by meta memory,\nforming a hybrid mechanism that captures both long-range dependencies and\nfine-grained local interactions. Moreover, we introduce a hardware-aware\nalgorithm that accelerates the training speed of our models. Extensive\nexperiments show that Lizard achieves near-lossless recovery of the teacher\nmodel's performance across standard language modeling tasks, while\nsignificantly outperforming previous linearization methods. On the 5-shot MMLU\nbenchmark, Lizard improves over prior models by 18 points and shows significant\nimprovements on associative recall tasks.",

In\nthis paper, we present LONGER, a Long-sequence Optimized traNsformer for\nGPU-Efficient Recommenders. LONGER incorporates (i) a global token mechanism\nfor stabilizing attention over long contexts, (ii) a token merge module with\nlightweight InnerTransformers and hybrid attention strategy to reduce quadratic\ncomplexity, and (iii) a series of engineering optimizations, including training\nwith mixed-precision and activation recomputation, KV cache serving, and the\nfully synchronous model training and serving framework for unified GPU-based\ndense and sparse parameter updates. LONGER consistently outperforms strong\nbaselines in both offline metrics and online A/B testing in both advertising\nand e-commerce services at ByteDance, validating its consistent effectiveness\nand industrial-level scaling laws. Currently, LONGER has been fully deployed at\nmore than 10 influential scenarios at ByteDance, serving billion users.",

                    "value": "Modeling ultra-long user behavior sequences is critical for capturing both\nlong- and short-term preferences in industrial recommender systems. Existing\nsolutions typically rely on two-stage retrieval or indirect modeling paradigms,\nincuring upstream-downstream inconsistency and computational inefficiency. In\nthis paper, we present LONGER, a Long-sequence Optimized traNsformer for\nGPU-Efficient Recommenders. LONGER incorporates (i) a global token mechanism\nfor stabilizing attention over long contexts, (ii) a token merge module with\nlightweight InnerTransformers and hybrid attention strategy to reduce quadratic\ncomplexity, and (iii) a series of engineering optimizations, including training\nwith mixed-precision and activation recomputation, KV cache serving, and the\nfully synchronous model training and serving framework for unified GPU-based\ndense and sparse parameter updates. LONGER consistently outperforms strong\nbaselines in both offline metrics and online A/B testing in both advertising\nand e-commerce services at ByteDance, validating its consistent effectiveness\nand industrial-level scaling laws. Currently, LONGER has been fully deployed at\nmore than 10 influential scenarios at ByteDance, serving billion users."

Specifically, the FID\nvalues change from 30.454 to 21.690 (\\textbf{28.8}\\%), from 6.857 to 5.821\n(\\textbf{15.1}\\%), from 3.870 to 3.692 (\\textbf{4.6}\\%), and from 3.539 to\n3.451 (\\textbf{2.5}\\%) respectively.

                "summary": "The rapid advancement in large language models (LLMs) has significantly\nenhanced their ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant text,\nraising concerns about the misuse of AI-generated content and making it\ncritical to detect it. However, the task remains challenging, particularly in\nunseen domains or with unfamiliar LLMs. Leveraging LLM next-token distribution\noutputs offers a theoretically appealing approach for detection, as they\nencapsulate insights from the models' extensive pre-training on diverse\ncorpora. Despite its promise, zero-shot methods that attempt to operationalize\nthese outputs have met with limited success. We hypothesize that one of the\nproblems is that they use the mean to aggregate next-token distribution metrics\nacross tokens, when some tokens are naturally easier or harder to predict and\nshould be weighted differently. Based on this idea, we propose the Perplexity\nAttention Weighted Network (PAWN), which uses the last hidden states of the LLM\nand positions to weight the sum of a series of features based on metrics from\nthe next-token distribution across the sequence length. Although not zero-shot,\nour method allows us to cache the last hidden states and next-token\ndistribution metrics on disk, greatly reducing the training resource\nrequirements.

                    "value": "The rapid advancement in large language models (LLMs) has significantly\nenhanced their ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant text,\nraising concerns about the misuse of AI-generated content and making it\ncritical to detect it. However, the task remains challenging, particularly in\nunseen domains or with unfamiliar LLMs. Leveraging LLM next-token distribution\noutputs offers a theoretically appealing approach for detection, as they\nencapsulate insights from the models' extensive pre-training on diverse\ncorpora. Despite its promise, zero-shot methods that attempt to operationalize\nthese outputs have met with limited success. We hypothesize that one of the\nproblems is that they use the mean to aggregate next-token distribution metrics\nacross tokens, when some tokens are naturally easier or harder to predict and\nshould be weighted differently. Based on this idea, we propose the Perplexity\nAttention Weighted Network (PAWN), which uses the last hidden states of the LLM\nand positions to weight the sum of a series of features based on metrics from\nthe next-token distribution across the sequence length. Although not zero-shot,\nour method allows us to cache the last hidden states and next-token\ndistribution metrics on disk, greatly reducing the training resource\nrequirements. PAWN shows competitive and even better performance\nin-distribution than the strongest baselines (fine-tuned LMs) with a fraction\nof their trainable parameters. Our model also generalizes better to unseen\ndomains and source models, with smaller variability in the decision boundary\nacross distribution shifts.

Among\nvarious TTA approaches, cache-based methods show promise by preserving\nhistorical knowledge from low-entropy samples in a dynamic cache and fostering\nefficient adaptation. However, these methods face two critical reliability\nchallenges: (1) entropy often becomes unreliable under distribution shifts,\ncausing error accumulation in the cache and degradation in adaptation\nperformance; (2) the final predictions may be unreliable due to inflexible\ndecision boundaries that fail to accommodate large downstream shifts. To\naddress these challenges, we propose a Reliable Test-time Adaptation (ReTA)\nmethod that integrates two complementary strategies to enhance reliability from\ntwo perspectives.

Efficient Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is\ncrucial to address these issues. However, unlike traditional models, diffusion\nmodels critically rely on the time-step for the multi-round denoising.\nTypically, each time-step is encoded into a hypersensitive temporal feature by\nseveral modules. Despite this, existing PTQ methods do not optimize these\nmodules individually. Instead, they employ unsuitable reconstruction objectives\nand complex calibration methods, leading to significant disturbances in the\ntemporal feature and denoising trajectory, as well as reduced compression\nefficiency. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel quantization\nframework that includes three strategies: 1) TIB-based Maintenance: Based on\nour innovative Temporal Information Block (TIB) definition, Temporal\nInformation-aware Reconstruction (TIAR) and Finite Set Calibration (FSC) are\ndeveloped to efficiently align original temporal features. 2) Cache-based\nMaintenance: Instead of indirect and complex optimization for the related\nmodules, pre-computing and caching quantized counterparts of temporal features\nare developed to minimize errors. 3) Disturbance-aware Selection: Employ\ntemporal feature errors to guide a fine-grained selection between the two\nmaintenance strategies for further disturbance reduction. This framework\npreserves most of the temporal information and ensures high-quality end-to-end\ngeneration. Extensive testing on various datasets, diffusion models and\nhardware confirms our superior performance and acceleration.",

Previous\nresearch has extensively focused on reducing cold-start latency for specific\nfunctions. However, little attention has been given to skewed production\nworkloads. In such cases, cross-function optimization becomes essential.\nWithout cross-function optimization, a cloud provider is left with two equally\npoor options: (i) Either the cloud provider gives up optimization for each\nfunction in the long tail (which is slow); or (ii) the cloud provider applies\nfunction-specific optimizations (e.g., cache function images) to every function\nin the long tail (which violates the vendor's cache constraints). HotSwap\ndemonstrates cross-function optimization using a novel pre-warming strategy. In\nthis strategy, a pre-initialized live dependency image is migrated to the new\nfunction instance. At the same time, HotSwap respects the provider's cache\nconstraints, because a single pre-warmed dependency image in the cache can be\nshared among all serverless functions that require that image. HotSwap has been\ntested on seven representative functions from FunctionBench. In those tests,\nHotSwap accelerates dependency loading for those serverless functions with\nlarge dependency requirements by a factor ranging from 2.2 to 3.2.

Concretely, 6G will need to consider both the\nperformance and sustainability targets for the various use cases it will serve.\nMoreover, like previous generations, 6G will have various candidate\ntechnological enablers, making the design space of the system even more\ncomplex. Furthermore, given the subjective nature of the sustainability\nindicators, in particular social sustainability, there is a significant gap in\nliterature on how technical enablers and 6G System design can be linked to\nthem. Hence, in this article a novel method for 6G end-to-end (E2E) system\ndesign based on Knowledge graphs (KG) has been introduced. It considers as its\ninput: the use case KPIs, use case sustainability requirements expressed as Key\nValues (KV) and KV Indicators (KVIs), the ability of the technological enablers\nto satisfy these KPIs and KVIs, the 6G system design principles defined in\nHexa-X-II project, the maturity of a technological enabler and the dependencies\nbetween the various enablers. As part of the KG method, a novel approach for\ndetermining the key values a technological enabler addresses, has also been\nintroduced. The effectiveness of the KG method was demonstrated by its\napplication in designing the 6G E2E system for the cooperating mobile robot use\ncase defined in the Hexa-X-II project, where 82 enablers were selected.

It has long been verified that, in a static\nmagnetic field, those atomic energy levels with hyperfine interactions shift\naccording to the Breit-Rabi formula, which introduces nonlinear dependence on\nthe magnetic field. On the other hand, the corresponding Breit-Rabi dependence\non a static electric field has not been observed before due to a combination of\nexperimental challenges. Here we precisely measure the Stark shift of the\n$6s^2\\ ^1S_0\\ \\leftrightarrow\\ 6s6p\\ ^1P_1$ transition of $^{171}$Yb ($I$ =\n1/2) with cold atoms held by an optical dipole trap in a static electric field\nup to 120 kV/cm. We observe the electric Breit-Rabi effect displaying\nhigh-order ($E^4$ and $E^6$) DC Stark shifts. These effects arise from the\ninfluence of the strong electric field on hyperfine interactions.",

                    "value": "The response of an atom to external electric and magnetic fields can reveal\nfundamental atomic properties. It has long been verified that, in a static\nmagnetic field, those atomic energy levels with hyperfine interactions shift\naccording to the Breit-Rabi formula, which introduces nonlinear dependence on\nthe magnetic field. On the other hand, the corresponding Breit-Rabi dependence\non a static electric field has not been observed before due to a combination of\nexperimental challenges. Here we precisely measure the Stark shift of the\n$6s^2\\ ^1S_0\\ \\leftrightarrow\\ 6s6p\\ ^1P_1$ transition of $^{171}$Yb ($I$ =\n1/2) with cold atoms held by an optical dipole trap in a static electric field\nup to 120 kV/cm. We observe the electric Breit-Rabi effect displaying\nhigh-order ($E^4$ and $E^6$) DC Stark shifts. These effects arise from the\ninfluence of the strong electric field on hyperfine interactions."

Our key insight\nis to exploit local spatial and temporal redundancy in video data which has\nbeen overlooked in prior work. STTM first transforms each frame into\nmulti-granular spatial tokens using a coarse-to-fine search over a quadtree\nstructure, then performs directed pairwise merging across the temporal\ndimension. This decomposed merging approach outperforms existing token\nreduction methods across six video QA benchmarks. Notably, STTM achieves a\n2$\\times$ speed-up with only a 0.5% accuracy drop under a 50% token budget, and\na 3$\\times$ speed-up with just a 2% drop under a 30% budget. Moreover, STTM is\nquery-agnostic, allowing KV cache reuse across different questions for the same\nvideo. The project page is available at https://www.jshyun.me/projects/sttm.",

                "summary": "Existing safety assurance research has primarily focused on training-phase\nalignment to instill safe behaviors into LLMs. However, recent studies have\nexposed these methods' susceptibility to diverse jailbreak attacks.\nConcurrently, inference scaling has significantly advanced LLM reasoning\ncapabilities but remains unexplored in the context of safety assurance.\nAddressing this gap, our work pioneers inference scaling for robust and\neffective LLM safety against emerging threats. We reveal that conventional\ninference scaling techniques, despite their success in reasoning tasks, perform\npoorly in safety contexts, even falling short of basic approaches like\nBest-of-N Sampling. We attribute this inefficiency to a newly identified\nchallenge, the exploration--efficiency dilemma, arising from the high\ncomputational overhead associated with frequent process reward model (PRM)\nevaluations. To overcome this dilemma, we propose SAFFRON, a novel inference\nscaling paradigm tailored explicitly for safety assurance. Central to our\napproach is the introduction of a multifurcation reward model (MRM) that\nsignificantly reduces the required number of reward model evaluations.

                    "value": "Existing safety assurance research has primarily focused on training-phase\nalignment to instill safe behaviors into LLMs. However, recent studies have\nexposed these methods' susceptibility to diverse jailbreak attacks.\nConcurrently, inference scaling has significantly advanced LLM reasoning\ncapabilities but remains unexplored in the context of safety assurance.\nAddressing this gap, our work pioneers inference scaling for robust and\neffective LLM safety against emerging threats. We reveal that conventional\ninference scaling techniques, despite their success in reasoning tasks, perform\npoorly in safety contexts, even falling short of basic approaches like\nBest-of-N Sampling. We attribute this inefficiency to a newly identified\nchallenge, the exploration--efficiency dilemma, arising from the high\ncomputational overhead associated with frequent process reward model (PRM)\nevaluations. To overcome this dilemma, we propose SAFFRON, a novel inference\nscaling paradigm tailored explicitly for safety assurance. Central to our\napproach is the introduction of a multifurcation reward model (MRM) that\nsignificantly reduces the required number of reward model evaluations. To\noperationalize this paradigm, we further propose: (i) a partial supervision\ntraining objective for MRM, (ii) a conservative exploration constraint to\nprevent out-of-distribution explorations, and (iii) a Trie-based key--value\ncaching strategy that facilitates cache sharing across sequences during tree\nsearch.

However, existing semantic\ncaching frameworks rely on single embedding models for query representation,\nwhich limits their ability to capture the diverse semantic relationships\npresent in real-world query distributions. This paper presents an ensemble\nembedding approach that combines multiple embedding models through a trained\nmeta-encoder to improve semantic similarity detection in LLM caching systems.\nWe evaluate our method using the Quora Question Pairs (QQP) dataset, measuring\ncache hit ratios, cache miss ratios, token savings, and response times. Our\nensemble approach achieves a 92\\% cache hit ratio for semantically equivalent\nqueries while maintaining an 85\\% accuracy in correctly rejecting\nnon-equivalent queries as cache misses. These results demonstrate that ensemble\nembedding methods significantly outperform single-model approaches in\ndistinguishing between semantically similar and dissimilar queries, leading to\nmore effective caching performance and reduced computational overhead in\nLLM-based systems.",

Our\nmethod stores the full scene out-of-core (e.g., in CPU memory) and trains a\nLevel-of-Detail (LoD) representation directly, dynamically streaming only the\nrelevant Gaussians. A hybrid data structure combining Gaussian hierarchies with\nSequential Point Trees enables efficient, view-dependent LoD selection, while a\nlightweight caching and view scheduling system exploits temporal coherence to\nsupport real-time streaming and rendering. Together, these innovations enable\nseamless multi-scale reconstruction and interactive visualization of complex\nscenes -- from broad aerial views to fine-grained ground-level details."

It has been\nshown that the multigrid solver GMGPolar solves the 2D gyrokinetic Poisson\nequation in linear complexity and with only small memory requirements compared\nto other state-of-the-art solvers. In this paper, we present a completely\nrefactored and object-oriented version of GMGPolar which offers two different\nmatrix-free implementations. Among other things, we leverage the\nSherman-Morrison formula to solve cyclic tridiagonal systems from circular line\nsolvers without additional fill-in and we apply reordering to optimize cache\naccess of circular and radial smoothing operations. With the Give approach,\nmemory requirements are further reduced and speedups of four to seven are\nobtained for usual test cases. For the Take approach, speedups of 16 to 18 can\nbe attained.",

Hunyuan-TurboS features an\nadaptive long-short chain-of-thought (CoT) mechanism, dynamically switching\nbetween rapid responses for simple queries and deep \"thinking\" modes for\ncomplex problems, optimizing computational resources. Architecturally, this 56B\nactivated (560B total) parameter model employs 128 layers (Mamba2, Attention,\nFFN) with an innovative AMF/MF block pattern. Faster Mamba2 ensures linear\ncomplexity, Grouped-Query Attention minimizes KV cache, and FFNs use an MoE\nstructure. Pre-trained on 16T high-quality tokens, it supports a 256K context\nlength and is the first industry-deployed large-scale Mamba model. Our\ncomprehensive post-training strategy enhances capabilities via Supervised\nFine-Tuning (3M instructions), a novel Adaptive Long-short CoT Fusion method,\nMulti-round Deliberation Learning for iterative improvement, and a two-stage\nLarge-scale Reinforcement Learning process targeting STEM and general\ninstruction-following. Evaluations show strong performance: overall top 7 rank\non LMSYS Chatbot Arena with a score of 1356, outperforming leading models like\nGemini-2.0-Flash-001 (1352) and o4-mini-2025-04-16 (1345). TurboS also achieves\nan average of 77.9% across 23 automated benchmarks. Hunyuan-TurboS balances\nhigh performance and efficiency, offering substantial capabilities at lower\ninference costs than many reasoning models, establishing a new paradigm for\nefficient large-scale pre-trained models.",

Our\nevaluations show that HybridTier outperforms prior systems by up to $91\\%$\n($19\\%$ geomean), incurring $2.0-7.8\\times$ less memory overhead and\n$1.7-3.5\\times$ less cache misses."

To address this, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has been\nproposed to reduce the unreliability (i.e., hallucinations) of LLMs. However,\ndesigning effective pipelines remains challenging due to numerous design\nchoices. In this paper, we construct a retrieval corpus of over 3 million Java\nand Python related Stack Overflow posts with accepted answers, and explore\nvarious RAG pipeline designs to answer developer questions, evaluating their\neffectiveness in generating accurate and reliable responses. More specifically,\nwe (1) design and evaluate 7 different RAG pipelines and 63 pipeline variants\nto answer questions that have historically similar matches, and (2) address new\nquestions without any close prior matches by automatically lowering the\nsimilarity threshold during retrieval, thereby increasing the chance of finding\npartially relevant context and improving coverage for unseen cases. We find\nthat implementing a RAG pipeline combining hypothetical-documentation-embedding\n(HyDE) with the full-answer context performs best in retrieving and answering\nsimilarcontent for Stack Overflow questions. Finally, we apply our optimal RAG\npipeline to 4 open-source LLMs and compare the results to their zero-shot\nperformance. Our findings show that RAG with our optimal RAG pipeline\nconsistently outperforms zero-shot baselines across models, achieving higher\nscores for helpfulness, correctness, and detail with LLM-as-a-judge. These\nfindings demonstrate that our optimal RAG pipelines robustly enhance answer\nquality for a wide range of developer queries including both previously seen\nand novel questions across different LLMs",

These conditions, generally referred to as either implying or\nsatisfying coarsening at random, are inconsistently imposed across this\nliterature and, in all cases, fail to imply coarsening at random. We establish\nthe first general characterization of coarsening at random, and also sequential\ncoarsening at random, for this estimation problem. Other contributions include\nthe first general characterization of the set of all influence functions for\nthe counterfactual survival probability under sequential coarsening at random,\nand the corresponding nonparametric efficient influence function. These\ncharacterizations are general in that neither impose continuity assumptions on\neither the underlying failure or censoring time distributions. We further show\nhow the latter compares to alternative forms recently derived in the\nliterature, including establishing the pointwise equivalence of the influence\nfunctions for our nonparametric efficient estimator and that recently given in\nWestling et al (2024, Journal of the American Statistical Association).",

These conditions, generally referred to as either implying or\nsatisfying coarsening at random, are inconsistently imposed across this\nliterature and, in all cases, fail to imply coarsening at random. We establish\nthe first general characterization of coarsening at random, and also sequential\ncoarsening at random, for this estimation problem. Other contributions include\nthe first general characterization of the set of all influence functions for\nthe counterfactual survival probability under sequential coarsening at random,\nand the corresponding nonparametric efficient influence function. These\ncharacterizations are general in that neither impose continuity assumptions on\neither the underlying failure or censoring time distributions. We further show\nhow the latter compares to alternative forms recently derived in the\nliterature, including establishing the pointwise equivalence of the influence\nfunctions for our nonparametric efficient estimator and that recently given in\nWestling et al (2024, Journal of the American Statistical Association)."

Recently, the\nSegment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) framework has demonstrated remarkable\nadvancements in both image and video segmentation.

To address these\nchallenges, we introduce Memory Augmented (MA)-SAM2, a training-free video\nobject segmentation strategy, featuring novel context-aware and\nocclusion-resilient memory models. MA-SAM2 exhibits strong robustness against\nocclusions and interactions arising from complex instrument movements while\nmaintaining accuracy in segmenting objects throughout videos. Employing a\nmulti-target, single-loop, one-prompt inference further enhances the efficiency\nof the tracking process in multi-instrument videos.

Additionally, four supporting methods enable precise legal concept\nretrieval: direct code matching, semantic vector similarity, ontology path\nreasoning, and lexical segmentation. Through extensive testing, results show\nmajor improvements: sensitivity increased by 9.9%-13.8%, specificity by\n4.8%-6.7%, and citation accuracy by 22.4%-39.7%. As a result, the framework\nprovides better legal analysis and understanding of judicial logic, thus\noffering a new technical method for intelligent legal assistance systems."

Leveraging computer vision,\ndeep learning, and edge inference, the system automates the identification and\nclassification of key actions, significantly reducing decision time from\nminutes to seconds while improving consistency and transparency. Importantly,\nthe methodology is not limited to Taekwondo. The underlying framework -- based\non pose estimation, motion classification, and impact analysis -- can be\nadapted to a wide range of sports requiring action detection, such as judo,\nkarate, fencing, or even team sports like football and basketball, where foul\nrecognition or performance tracking is critical. By addressing one of\nTaekwondo's most challenging scenarios -- head kick scoring -- we demonstrate\nthe robustness, scalability, and sport-agnostic potential of 'FST.ai' to\ntransform officiating standards across multiple disciplines."

                "summary": "Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection holds significant importance across many\napplications. While semantic and domain-shift OOD problems are well-studied,\nthis work focuses on covariate shifts - subtle variations in the data\ndistribution that can degrade machine learning performance. We hypothesize that\ndetecting these subtle shifts can improve our understanding of in-distribution\nboundaries, ultimately improving OOD detection. In adversarial discriminators\ntrained with Batch Normalization (BN), real and adversarial samples form\ndistinct domains with unique batch statistics - a property we exploit for OOD\ndetection. We introduce DisCoPatch, an unsupervised Adversarial Variational\nAutoencoder (VAE) framework that harnesses this mechanism. During inference,\nbatches consist of patches from the same image, ensuring a consistent data\ndistribution that allows the model to rely on batch statistics. DisCoPatch uses\nthe VAE's suboptimal outputs (generated and reconstructed) as negative samples\nto train the discriminator, thereby improving its ability to delineate the\nboundary between in-distribution samples and covariate shifts.

                    "value": "Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection holds significant importance across many\napplications. While semantic and domain-shift OOD problems are well-studied,\nthis work focuses on covariate shifts - subtle variations in the data\ndistribution that can degrade machine learning performance. We hypothesize that\ndetecting these subtle shifts can improve our understanding of in-distribution\nboundaries, ultimately improving OOD detection. In adversarial discriminators\ntrained with Batch Normalization (BN), real and adversarial samples form\ndistinct domains with unique batch statistics - a property we exploit for OOD\ndetection. We introduce DisCoPatch, an unsupervised Adversarial Variational\nAutoencoder (VAE) framework that harnesses this mechanism. During inference,\nbatches consist of patches from the same image, ensuring a consistent data\ndistribution that allows the model to rely on batch statistics. DisCoPatch uses\nthe VAE's suboptimal outputs (generated and reconstructed) as negative samples\nto train the discriminator, thereby improving its ability to delineate the\nboundary between in-distribution samples and covariate shifts. By tightening\nthis boundary, DisCoPatch achieves state-of-the-art results in public OOD\ndetection benchmarks.

The success of these models can\nlargely be attributed to the dominant scaling law, which states that larger\nparameter sizes and data volumes contribute to better performance. Notably,\ndata scaling has been primarily driven by automatic data pipelines, which focus\non the self-instruction of LLMs. The paradigm has been taken for granted for\nquite some time, but the study of the effectiveness of scaling with these data\nhas been neglected for a long time. In this context, this work revisits scaling\nwith synthetic data and focuses on developing video-LLMs from a data-centric\nperspective. Our primary study approach involves fine-tuning pre-trained\nimage-LLMs with video data and examining learning efficiency through data\nscaling. Results from our preliminary experiments reveal a low learning\nefficiency phenomenon when simply scaling up video data samples, which, through\nour probing, can be ascribed to a lack of instruction diversity. Aiming at this\nissue, we propose a data augmentation method called Sparrow, which synthesizes\nvideo-like samples from pure text instruction data. Mixing these synthetic\nsamples with the video data enables a more efficient training scheme. Through\ncomprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed method achieves\nperformance comparable to or even superior to that of baselines trained with\nsignificantly more samples. Meanwhile, we find that incorporating these\nsynthetic samples can enhance the performance of long video understanding\nwithout requiring training on long video data.

For all but\nfour sample sources we report intra-night photometric monitoring for the first\ntime with at least one monitoring session per source lasting for a minimum of\n3.0 hours duration.

Despite notable\nadvances with recent efforts, current techniques still lag behind human\ncapabilities in handling drastic visual variations, occlusions, and complex\nscene changes. This limitation arises from their reliance on appearance\nmatching, neglecting the human-like conceptual understanding of objects that\nenables robust identification across temporal dynamics. Motivated by this gap,\nwe propose Segment Concept (SeC), a concept-driven segmentation framework that\nshifts from conventional feature matching to the progressive construction and\nutilization of high-level, object-centric representations. SeC employs Large\nVision-Language Models (LVLMs) to integrate visual cues across diverse frames,\nconstructing robust conceptual priors.

To\nrigorously assess VOS methods in scenarios demanding high-level conceptual\nreasoning and robust semantic understanding, we introduce the Semantic Complex\nScenarios Video Object Segmentation benchmark (SeCVOS).

To address this, this paper introduces Routine, a multi-step agent\nplanning framework designed with a clear structure, explicit instructions, and\nseamless parameter passing to guide the agent's execution module in performing\nmulti-step tool-calling tasks with high stability. In evaluations conducted\nwithin a real-world enterprise scenario, Routine significantly increases the\nexecution accuracy in model tool calls, increasing the performance of GPT-4o\nfrom 41.1% to 96.3%, and Qwen3-14B from 32.6% to 83.3%. We further constructed\na Routine-following training dataset and fine-tuned Qwen3-14B, resulting in an\naccuracy increase to 88.2% on scenario-specific evaluations, indicating\nimproved adherence to execution plans. In addition, we employed Routine-based\ndistillation to create a scenario-specific, multi-step tool-calling dataset.\nFine-tuning on this distilled dataset raised the model's accuracy to 95.5%,\napproaching GPT-4o's performance. These results highlight Routine's\neffectiveness in distilling domain-specific tool-usage patterns and enhancing\nmodel adaptability to new scenarios.

However, relying solely on prompts and contextual inputs often\nproves insufficient for achieving deep immersion in specific roles,\nparticularly well-known fictional or public figures. On the other hand,\nfine-tuning-based approaches face limitations due to the challenges associated\nwith data collection and the computational resources required for training,\nthereby restricting their broader applicability. To address these issues, we\npropose Test-Time-Matching (TTM), a training-free role-playing framework\nthrough test-time scaling and context engineering. TTM uses LLM agents to\nautomatically decouple a character's features into personality, memory, and\nlinguistic style. Our framework involves a structured, three-stage generation\npipeline that utilizes these features for controlled role-playing. It achieves\nhigh-fidelity role-playing performance, also enables seamless combinations\nacross diverse linguistic styles and even variations in personality and memory.\nWe evaluate our framework through human assessment, and the results demonstrate\nthat our method achieves the outstanding performance in generating expressive\nand stylistically consistent character dialogues.",

                    "value": "The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has enabled\nrole-playing language agents to demonstrate significant potential in various\napplications. However, relying solely on prompts and contextual inputs often\nproves insufficient for achieving deep immersion in specific roles,\nparticularly well-known fictional or public figures. On the other hand,\nfine-tuning-based approaches face limitations due to the challenges associated\nwith data collection and the computational resources required for training,\nthereby restricting their broader applicability. To address these issues, we\npropose Test-Time-Matching (TTM), a training-free role-playing framework\nthrough test-time scaling and context engineering. TTM uses LLM agents to\nautomatically decouple a character's features into personality, memory, and\nlinguistic style. Our framework involves a structured, three-stage generation\npipeline that utilizes these features for controlled role-playing. It achieves\nhigh-fidelity role-playing performance, also enables seamless combinations\nacross diverse linguistic styles and even variations in personality and memory.\nWe evaluate our framework through human assessment, and the results demonstrate\nthat our method achieves the outstanding performance in generating expressive\nand stylistically consistent character dialogues."

                "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in assisting developers with\ncode-related questions; however, LLMs carry the risk of generating unreliable\nanswers. To address this, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has been\nproposed to reduce the unreliability (i.e., hallucinations) of LLMs. However,\ndesigning effective pipelines remains challenging due to numerous design\nchoices. In this paper, we construct a retrieval corpus of over 3 million Java\nand Python related Stack Overflow posts with accepted answers, and explore\nvarious RAG pipeline designs to answer developer questions, evaluating their\neffectiveness in generating accurate and reliable responses. More specifically,\nwe (1) design and evaluate 7 different RAG pipelines and 63 pipeline variants\nto answer questions that have historically similar matches, and (2) address new\nquestions without any close prior matches by automatically lowering the\nsimilarity threshold during retrieval, thereby increasing the chance of finding\npartially relevant context and improving coverage for unseen cases. We find\nthat implementing a RAG pipeline combining hypothetical-documentation-embedding\n(HyDE) with the full-answer context performs best in retrieving and answering\nsimilarcontent for Stack Overflow questions.

                    "value": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in assisting developers with\ncode-related questions; however, LLMs carry the risk of generating unreliable\nanswers. To address this, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has been\nproposed to reduce the unreliability (i.e., hallucinations) of LLMs. However,\ndesigning effective pipelines remains challenging due to numerous design\nchoices. In this paper, we construct a retrieval corpus of over 3 million Java\nand Python related Stack Overflow posts with accepted answers, and explore\nvarious RAG pipeline designs to answer developer questions, evaluating their\neffectiveness in generating accurate and reliable responses. More specifically,\nwe (1) design and evaluate 7 different RAG pipelines and 63 pipeline variants\nto answer questions that have historically similar matches, and (2) address new\nquestions without any close prior matches by automatically lowering the\nsimilarity threshold during retrieval, thereby increasing the chance of finding\npartially relevant context and improving coverage for unseen cases. We find\nthat implementing a RAG pipeline combining hypothetical-documentation-embedding\n(HyDE) with the full-answer context performs best in retrieving and answering\nsimilarcontent for Stack Overflow questions. Finally, we apply our optimal RAG\npipeline to 4 open-source LLMs and compare the results to their zero-shot\nperformance.

A key challenge lies in the scarcity of\nhigh-quality, large-scale, image-text paired training data. Recently, several\nworks introduced extensive image-text datasets for RS and trained their VLFMs.\nHowever, due to the rudimentary methods used for generating captions, the\nquality of datasets is suboptimal, requiring larger volumes of training data,\nwhile only yielding modest performance improvements. In this paper, we propose\na two-stage method named MpGI(Multi-Perspective Generation and Integration) for\ngenerating high-quality text captions for RS images. Firstly, we generate\ndistinct and detailed descriptions from different perspectives using\nRule-MLLM(Multimodal Large Language Model) Relay Generation and MLLMs\ngeneration methods. Next, we utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) to integrate\nthese diverse descriptions into comprehensive captions, capturing details from\nmultiple perspectives. Finally, we have created the HQRS-IT-210K dataset,\nincluding about 210,000 RS images and 1.3 million captions. We fine-tuned two\nVLFMs using our dataset: CLIP, a discriminative model, and CoCa, an\nimage-to-text generative model. This process resulted in our proposed HQRS-CLIP\nand RS-CoCa models. Experimental results demonstrate that HQRS-CLIP surpassed\nthe previous SOTA RS CLIP model in various downstream tasks while using only\n4.2\\% of the training data. RS-CoCa outperforms other advanced approaches\nacross benchmark datasets and can generate captions for RS images that rival or\neven exceed manual annotations.

This study explores the\npotential of large language model-based architectures for speech-based\ndepression prediction in a multimodal regime that integrates speech-derived\ntext, acoustic landmarks, and vocal biomarkers. Adolescent depression presents\na significant challenge and is often comorbid with multiple disorders, such as\nsuicidal ideation and sleep disturbances. This presents an additional\nopportunity to integrate multi-task learning (MTL) into our study by\nsimultaneously predicting depression, suicidal ideation, and sleep disturbances\nusing the multimodal formulation. We also propose a longitudinal analysis\nstrategy that models temporal changes across multiple clinical interactions,\nallowing for a comprehensive understanding of the conditions' progression. Our\nproposed approach, featuring trimodal, longitudinal MTL is evaluated on the\nDepression Early Warning dataset.

Due to the significant heterogeneity of these signals, which we\nsummarize as the M5 problem, previous works only focus on small sub-problems\nand employ specialized models, failing to utilize the synergies between\nmodalities and the powerful scaling law. However, we argue that the M5 signals\ncan be modeled in a unified manner due to the intrinsic similarity. As a\nresult, we propose FISHER, a Foundation model for multi-modal Industrial Signal\ncompreHEnsive Representation. To support arbitrary sampling rates, FISHER\nconsiders the increment of sampling rate as the concatenation of sub-band\ninformation. Specifically, FISHER takes the STFT sub-band as the modeling unit\nand adopts a teacher student SSL framework for pre-training. We also develop\nthe RMIS benchmark, which evaluates the representations of M5 industrial\nsignals on multiple health management tasks. Compared with top SSL models,\nFISHER showcases versatile and outstanding capabilities with a general\nperformance gain up to 5.03%, along with much more efficient scaling curves. We\nalso investigate the scaling law on downstream tasks and derive potential\navenues for future works. FISHER is now open-sourced on\nhttps://github.com/jianganbai/FISHER",

This\npaper introduces FOGNITE Fog-based Grid In intelligence with Neural Integration\nand Twin based Execution a next-generation fog cloud framework designed to\nenhance autonomy, resilience, and efficiency in distributed energy systems.\nFOGNITE combines three core components: federated learning, reinforcement\nlearning, and digital twin validation. Each fog node trains a local CNN LSTM\nmodel on private energy consumption data, enabling predictive intelligence\nwhile preserving data privacy through federated aggregation. A reinforcement\nlearning agent dynamically schedules tasks based on current system load and\nenergy conditions, optimizing for performance under uncertainty.\n  To prevent unsafe or inefficient decisions, a hierarchical digital twin layer\nsimulates potential actions before deployment, significantly reducing execution\nerrors and energy waste. We evaluate FOGNITE on a real world testbed of\nRaspberry Pi devices, showing up to a 93.7% improvement in load balancing\naccuracy and a 63.2% reduction in energy waste compared to conventional\narchitectures. By shifting smart grid control from reactive correction to\nproactive optimization, FOGNITE represents a step toward more intelligent,\nadaptive, and sustainable energy infrastructures",

                    "value": "Modern smart grids demand fast, intelligent, and energy-aware computing at\nthe edge to manage real time fluctuations and ensure reliable operation. This\npaper introduces FOGNITE Fog-based Grid In intelligence with Neural Integration\nand Twin based Execution a next-generation fog cloud framework designed to\nenhance autonomy, resilience, and efficiency in distributed energy systems.\nFOGNITE combines three core components: federated learning, reinforcement\nlearning, and digital twin validation. Each fog node trains a local CNN LSTM\nmodel on private energy consumption data, enabling predictive intelligence\nwhile preserving data privacy through federated aggregation. A reinforcement\nlearning agent dynamically schedules tasks based on current system load and\nenergy conditions, optimizing for performance under uncertainty.\n  To prevent unsafe or inefficient decisions, a hierarchical digital twin layer\nsimulates potential actions before deployment, significantly reducing execution\nerrors and energy waste. We evaluate FOGNITE on a real world testbed of\nRaspberry Pi devices, showing up to a 93.7% improvement in load balancing\naccuracy and a 63.2% reduction in energy waste compared to conventional\narchitectures. By shifting smart grid control from reactive correction to\nproactive optimization, FOGNITE represents a step toward more intelligent,\nadaptive, and sustainable energy infrastructures"

To overcome these limitations, we propose Spatial 3D-LLM, a 3D\nMLLM specifically designed to enhance spatial awareness for 3D vision-language\ntasks by enriching the spatial embeddings of 3D scenes.

The success of these models can\nlargely be attributed to the dominant scaling law, which states that larger\nparameter sizes and data volumes contribute to better performance. Notably,\ndata scaling has been primarily driven by automatic data pipelines, which focus\non the self-instruction of LLMs. The paradigm has been taken for granted for\nquite some time, but the study of the effectiveness of scaling with these data\nhas been neglected for a long time. In this context, this work revisits scaling\nwith synthetic data and focuses on developing video-LLMs from a data-centric\nperspective. Our primary study approach involves fine-tuning pre-trained\nimage-LLMs with video data and examining learning efficiency through data\nscaling. Results from our preliminary experiments reveal a low learning\nefficiency phenomenon when simply scaling up video data samples, which, through\nour probing, can be ascribed to a lack of instruction diversity. Aiming at this\nissue, we propose a data augmentation method called Sparrow, which synthesizes\nvideo-like samples from pure text instruction data. Mixing these synthetic\nsamples with the video data enables a more efficient training scheme. Through\ncomprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed method achieves\nperformance comparable to or even superior to that of baselines trained with\nsignificantly more samples. Meanwhile, we find that incorporating these\nsynthetic samples can enhance the performance of long video understanding\nwithout requiring training on long video data.

These characteristics often reveal the limitations of conventional\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approaches. To overcome these challenges,\nwe propose Typed-RAG, a framework for type-aware decomposition of non-factoid\nquestions (NFQs) within the RAG paradigm. Specifically, Typed-RAG first\nclassifies an NFQ into a predefined type (e.g., Debate, Experience,\nComparison). It then decomposes the question into focused sub-queries, each\nfocusing on a single aspect. This decomposition enhances both retrieval\nrelevance and answer quality. By combining the results of these sub-queries,\nTyped-RAG produces more informative and contextually aligned responses.\nAdditionally, we construct Wiki-NFQA, a benchmark dataset for NFQA covering a\nwide range of NFQ types. Experiments show that Typed-RAG consistently\noutperforms existing QA approaches based on LLMs or RAG methods, validating the\neffectiveness of type-aware decomposition for improving both retrieval quality\nand answer generation in NFQA.

These characteristics often reveal the limitations of conventional\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approaches. To overcome these challenges,\nwe propose Typed-RAG, a framework for type-aware decomposition of non-factoid\nquestions (NFQs) within the RAG paradigm. Specifically, Typed-RAG first\nclassifies an NFQ into a predefined type (e.g., Debate, Experience,\nComparison). It then decomposes the question into focused sub-queries, each\nfocusing on a single aspect. This decomposition enhances both retrieval\nrelevance and answer quality. By combining the results of these sub-queries,\nTyped-RAG produces more informative and contextually aligned responses.\nAdditionally, we construct Wiki-NFQA, a benchmark dataset for NFQA covering a\nwide range of NFQ types. Experiments show that Typed-RAG consistently\noutperforms existing QA approaches based on LLMs or RAG methods, validating the\neffectiveness of type-aware decomposition for improving both retrieval quality\nand answer generation in NFQA. Our code and dataset are available on\nhttps://github.com/TeamNLP/Typed-RAG."

Confidence calibration,\nwhich estimates the underlying uncertainty of model predictions, is essential\nto enhance the LLMs' trustworthiness. Existing research on LLM calibration has\nprimarily focused on short-form tasks, providing a single confidence score at\nthe response level (macro calibration). However, this approach is insufficient\nfor long-form generations, where responses often contain more complex\nstatements and may include both accurate and inaccurate information. Therefore,\nwe introduce atomic calibration, a novel approach that evaluates factuality\ncalibration at a fine-grained level by breaking down long responses into atomic\nclaims. We classify confidence elicitation methods into discriminative and\ngenerative types and demonstrate that their combination can enhance\ncalibration. Our extensive experiments on various LLMs and datasets show that\natomic calibration is well-suited for long-form generation and can also improve\nmacro calibration results. Additionally, atomic calibration reveals insightful\npatterns in LLM confidence throughout the generation process.",

However, this approach is insufficient\nfor long-form generations, where responses often contain more complex\nstatements and may include both accurate and inaccurate information. Therefore,\nwe introduce atomic calibration, a novel approach that evaluates factuality\ncalibration at a fine-grained level by breaking down long responses into atomic\nclaims. We classify confidence elicitation methods into discriminative and\ngenerative types and demonstrate that their combination can enhance\ncalibration. Our extensive experiments on various LLMs and datasets show that\natomic calibration is well-suited for long-form generation and can also improve\nmacro calibration results. Additionally, atomic calibration reveals insightful\npatterns in LLM confidence throughout the generation process."

CREME\nfirst identifies robustness-sensitive layers by comparing hidden states between\nan original prompt and its perturbed variant. Then, it performs lightweight\nparameter editing at the identified layer to reduce performance degradation. We\nevaluate CREME on two widely used code generation benchmarks (HumanEval and\nMBPP) along with their perturbed counterparts. Experimental results show that\nCREME improves Pass@1 accuracy by 63% on perturbed prompts while maintaining\nstable performance on clean inputs, with accuracy deviations within 1%.

In this work, we introduce\n\\textbf{Diff-ANO} (\\textbf{Diff}usion-based Models with \\textbf{A}djoint\n\\textbf{N}eural \\textbf{O}perators), a novel framework that combines\nconditional consistency models with adjoint operator learning to address these\nlimitations. Our two key innovations include: (1) a \\textit{conditional\nconsistency model} that enables measurement-conditional few-step sampling by\ndirectly learning a self-consistent mapping from diffusion trajectories, and\n(2) an \\textit{adjoint operator learning} module that replaces traditional PDE\nsolvers with neural operator surrogates for efficient adjoint-based gradient\ncomputation. To enable practical deployment, we introduce the batch-based\nConvergent Born Series (BCBS)--a memory-efficient strategy for online\ngeneration of neural operator training pairs. Comprehensive experiments\ndemonstrate that Diff-ANO significantly improves both computational efficiency\nand reconstruction quality, especially under sparse-view and partial-view\nmeasurement scenarios.",

However, traditional approaches for solving\nHelmholtz equation-constrained USCT face three fundamental challenges when\nintegrating these priors: PDE-constrained gradient computation,\ndiscretization-induced approximation errors, and computational imbalance\nbetween neural networks and numerical PDE solvers. In this work, we introduce\n\\textbf{Diff-ANO} (\\textbf{Diff}usion-based Models with \\textbf{A}djoint\n\\textbf{N}eural \\textbf{O}perators), a novel framework that combines\nconditional consistency models with adjoint operator learning to address these\nlimitations. Our two key innovations include: (1) a \\textit{conditional\nconsistency model} that enables measurement-conditional few-step sampling by\ndirectly learning a self-consistent mapping from diffusion trajectories, and\n(2) an \\textit{adjoint operator learning} module that replaces traditional PDE\nsolvers with neural operator surrogates for efficient adjoint-based gradient\ncomputation. To enable practical deployment, we introduce the batch-based\nConvergent Born Series (BCBS)--a memory-efficient strategy for online\ngeneration of neural operator training pairs. Comprehensive experiments\ndemonstrate that Diff-ANO significantly improves both computational efficiency\nand reconstruction quality, especially under sparse-view and partial-view\nmeasurement scenarios."

Yet, existing automated red teaming approaches often\ntreat prompt discovery as an isolated, prompt-level optimization task, which\nlimits their scalability, diversity, and overall effectiveness. To bridge this\ngap, in this paper, we propose DREAM, a scalable red teaming framework to\nautomatically uncover diverse problematic prompts from a given T2I system.\nUnlike most prior works that optimize prompts individually, DREAM directly\nmodels the probabilistic distribution of the target system's problematic\nprompts, which enables explicit optimization over both effectiveness and\ndiversity, and allows efficient large-scale sampling after training. To achieve\nthis without direct access to representative training samples, we draw\ninspiration from energy-based models and reformulate the objective into simple\nand tractable objectives. We further introduce GC-SPSA, an efficient\noptimization algorithm that provide stable gradient estimates through the long\nand potentially non-differentiable T2I pipeline. The effectiveness of DREAM is\nvalidated through extensive experiments, demonstrating that it surpasses 9\nstate-of-the-art baselines by a notable margin across a broad range of T2I\nmodels and safety filters in terms of prompt success rate and diversity.",

However, the enormous number of model parameters makes\nfine-tuning challenging, significantly limiting their application and\ndeployment. Existing solutions combine parameter quantization with Low-Rank\nAdaptation (LoRA), reducing memory usage but causing performance degradation.\nAdditionally, converting fine-tuned models to low-precision representations\nfurther degrades performance. In this paper, we identify an imbalance in\nfine-tuning quantized LLMs with LoRA: overly complex adapter inputs and outputs\nversus low effective trainability of the adapter, leading to underfitting\nduring fine-tuning. Thus, we propose Quantized LLMs fine-tuning with Balanced\nLow-Rank Adaptation (Q-BLoRA), which simplifies the adapter's inputs and\noutputs while increasing the adapter's rank to alleviate underfitting during\nfine-tuning. For low-precision deployment, we propose Quantization-Aware\nfine-tuning with Balanced Low-Rank Adaptation (QA-BLoRA), which aligns with the\nblock-wise quantization and facilitates quantization-aware fine-tuning of\nlow-rank adaptation based on the parameter merging of Q-BLoRA. Both Q-BLoRA and\nQA-BLoRA are easily implemented and offer the following optimizations: (i)\nQ-BLoRA consistently achieves state-of-the-art accuracy compared to baselines\nand other variants; (ii) QA-BLoRA enables the direct generation of\nlow-precision inference models, which exhibit significant performance\nimprovements over other low-precision models.
